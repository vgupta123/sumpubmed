BACKGROUND
the developing maize  endosperm is a tissue primarily devoted to the accumulation of starch and proteins which, upon germination, provide nutrients for the germinating seedling. the investigation of regulatory constraints on endosperm development and on the synthesis of storage products provides an opportunity to understand the control of gene activity in eukaryotic cells  <cit> .

despite the apparent simplicity of the mature tissue, endosperm development is complex and combines several aspects regarding cell cycle regulation, cytokinesis, and cytoskeletal functions . the first 7- <dig> days after pollination , characteristically involve cell division, after which the endosperm cells enlarge and as a result of several metabolic processes acquire storage proteins and starch  <cit> . although the changes in storage reserve accumulation during maize grain maturation are well established, identifying key molecular determinants controlling carbon  flux to the grain and the partitioning of c to starch and protein remain elusive  <cit> . in fact, our understanding of how each pathway is controlled is complicated by the occurrence of multi-gene families encoding many of the enzymes in these biochemical pathways, the interconnectedness of these, and the strong influence of the environment on the amount and nature of the starch and protein synthesized  <cit> .

much of our current knowledge is based on biochemical assays of protein and enzymatic activities of starch and protein biosynthesis during caryopsis development. zeins, the most abundant protein storage component in developing endosperms, are alcohol-soluble compounds with a characteristic amino acid composition, being rich in glutamine, proline, alanine, and leucine, and almost completely devoid of lysine and tryptophan  <cit> . based on their solubility, genetic properties, and apparent molecular masses, zeins were classified into α- , β- , γ- , and δ-zeins  that are encoded by distinct classes of structural genes  <cit> . the large α-zein component, accounting for > 70% of all zein proteins, is encoded by multiple active genes clustered in several chromosomal locations  <cit> .

in this context, the analysis of maize mutants has facilitated the identification of many genes encoding starch synthetic enzymes and helped elucidate the process of starch formation  <cit> . genetics has also played an important role by discovering a series of opaque endosperm mutants and demonstrating their effects on genes mediating zein deposition  <cit> . for example, the recessive mutations opaque- <dig>  and opaque- <dig>  induce a specific decrease in the accumulation of 22- and 19-kda α-zeins, respectively.

the o <dig> mutation has been widely studied at the genetic, biochemical, and molecular level. o <dig> encodes a transcriptional regulator of the basic leucine zipper  class that is specifically expressed in the endosperm activating the expression of 22-kda α-zein and 15-kda β-zein genes  <cit> . o <dig> also directly or indirectly regulates a number of other non-storage protein genes, including b- <dig>  encoding a type i ribosome-inactivating protein, cyppdk <dig>  one of the two cytosolic isoforms of the pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase gene, and b- <dig>  encoding a heat shock protein  <dig> analogue, possibly acting as a chaperonin during protein body formation  <cit> . o <dig>  furthermore, regulates the levels of lysine-ketoglutarate reductase and aspartate kinase <dig>  <cit> . these broad effects suggest that o <dig> plays an important role in the developing grain as a coordinator of the expression of genes controlling storage protein, and nitrogen  and c metabolism  <cit> .

although the molecular basis of the o <dig> mutation is yet unknown, it was shown that this mutation, in addition to repressing the lower molecular weight α-zeins, drastically affects the development of maize endosperm due to a reduction in starch content. moreover, the high content in o <dig> endosperms of non-protein n has suggested the existence in o <dig> of a block in the synthetic route leading to proteins similar to that observed for the starch modifying gene shrunken <dig> .

to advance our understanding of the nature of the mutations associated with an opaque phenotype, we used nearly isogenic inbreds for o <dig> and o <dig> mutants, and for the double mutant combination o2o <dig>  and compared their effects on protein synthesis and amino acid composition. in this study, to provide genome-scale information about gene expression patterns, we have also compared the profiles of gene expression in these mutants by cdna microarray slides containing unique cdnas expressed during kernel development. microarray analysis provides an opportunity to examine the extent of changes in gene expression in mutants that are altered in metabolism. classifying genes based on similarities or differences in transcript profiles within genotypes can confirm existing knowledge, lead to the dissection and revelation of novel mechanisms determining nutrient partitioning, and generate new unbiased hypotheses  <cit> .

recently, large databases of expressed maize genes have been made available , and transcriptome analyses aimed at identifying genes involved in endosperm development and metabolism have been published  <cit> . additionally, this technology was recently used to investigate a common mechanism that underlies several opaque-class kernel mutants  <cit> . the highly variable gene expression patterns they obtained made it difficult to identify common pathways that lead to soft endosperm texture. our study extends their analysis by including the o <dig> mutation and the double o2o <dig> mutant, that appear useful in conjunction with the o <dig> mutation to i) identify and catalogue in endosperm the changes of genes involved in several metabolic pathways underlying the synthesis of storage reserves, ii) give new information about the effects of the o <dig> gene in endosperm metabolism in order to better understand its function in carbohydrate and protein syntheses, and iii) gain an insight into the complex gene system that integrates c and n metabolism in the developing endosperm.

RESULTS
effect of o <dig>  o <dig>  and o2o <dig> mutations on protein and amino acid compositions
to verify whether the mutants analyzed exhibited qualitative and quantitative differences in protein composition compared to wild-type, we evaluated the protein and amino acid compositions of mature endosperm of the nearly isogenic a69ywt, o <dig>  o <dig>  and o2o <dig> inbreds. zein samples prepared from mature endosperm of the previous genotypes were compared in 2d-page. in agreement with their apparent molecular masses on sds-page,  <dig> polypeptides were classified, based on their apparent molecular weight as 27-kda γ-zeins,  <dig> as 22-kda α-zeins,  <dig> as 19-kda α-zeins,  <dig> as 15-kda β-zeins, and  <dig> as a 16-kda γ-zein . the two mutations decreased both the number and the accumulation of zein isoforms detected on 2d gels as compared to wild-type. the o <dig> mutation has a major effect on the 22-kda class zeins as a complete reduction of most of these polypeptides was observed. in agreement with previous data, we confirm that the o <dig> mutation can also influence the accumulation of some members of the 19-kda class  <cit> . changes in the zein profile in a69yo <dig> seeds were less evident. the o <dig> mutation decreased the amount of both 22-kda and 19-kda α-zeins as compared to wt. however, unlike previously reported, we did not find clear evidence of a specific polypeptide suppression mediated by the o <dig> mutation  <cit> . finally, the zein pattern in the o2o <dig> background was strongly affected: the 22-kda zein profile was nearly identical to the one observed in the o <dig>  whereas polypeptides of the 19-kda zein class were decreased both in amount and number. taken together these data confirm an additive effect of the o <dig> and o <dig> mutations in reducing zein accumulation during endosperm development.

protein and non-protein compositions are in percent of dry weight. amino acid compositions are in percent of protein . * fractions z1+z <dig> of  <cit> ; ‡ fractions g1+g <dig> of  <cit> .

a,b,c numbers followed by the same letters within a row are not significantly different at p ≤  <dig>  by standard analysis of variance.

the overall amino acid compositions of the single mutants o <dig> and o <dig>  and of the double mutant combination o2o <dig>  exhibited a rather similar pattern, although variation was observed of amino acid content in comparison to the wild type endosperms. each of the single mutants had a high lys content , whereas o2o <dig> had more that  <dig> -times the amount present in the wild type. a similar shift, although less pronounced, was observed for asx, and the other essential amino acids derived from the asp pathway  as well as for gly, val, his, and arg. among the amino acids reduced in the opaque endosperm mutants were glx and leu, the most abundant amino acids found in zein proteins. the reduction of these amino acids generally was inversely related to the increase in lys, with the trend being more evident in the double o2o <dig> endosperm mutant.

microarray construction
microarray slides were assembled using clones obtained from 20-part-normalized cdna libraries representing the major events in endosperm development.  <dig>  ests were sequenced, aligned, assembled into contigs using a similarity score of 90%, and annotated using blastx software. for each contig, the cdna containing the largest transcript was identified. these, together with all singleton cdnas  were used to construct a unigene set of  <dig>  sequences. the relative contribution of each cdna library to the pool of identified ests is summarized in table  <dig>  it is notable that the distribution of ests across the original cdna libraries was not uniform. the highest proportion of the sequences could be associated with endosperm tissue, the lowest with  <dig> days old embryo. est sequences were analyzed with the blast2go software . in a first phase, homology searches using public domain non-redundant databases identified significantly homologous sequences for  <dig> % of the ests considered. these ests represented  <dig>  single hit and  <dig>  multiple hit sequences.

the different cdna libraries used and their relative contribution to the zeastar unigene est set are indicated.

in a second phase, an attempt was made to associate biological processes to each of the ests showing sequence homology using the gene ontology  and kegg databases . approximately 85% of these unigenes could be assigned a functional annotation, with the remainder  having an ambiguous or unknown function. figure  <dig> summarizes the assignment of the biological processes and molecular functions. twenty-four distinct groups were identified to establish the complex regulatory hierarchies that exist to orchestrate the dynamic metabolic, transport, and control processes occurring in developing endosperm. this classification is consistent with the many functions of maize endosperm and is comparable with that reported by other workers  <cit> . it appears that our maize endosperm gene set is rather comprehensive and provides a good representation of the entire transcriptome including genes linked to accumulation of storage products and energy supply. more specifically, a large number of transcripts appeared to be involved in carbohydrate metabolism , followed by those participating in storage protein synthesis , translation  and transcription , nucleotide metabolism , and rna processing . among physiological processes, those transcripts implicated in protein turnover , energy metabolism , electron transport , amino acid metabolism , amino acid and sugar transport , the latter being intrinsically linked to the accumulation of storage protein and starch, nucleic acid metabolism , lipid  and fatty acid metabolism , and secondary metabolites  were represented in our est collection. moreover, genes encoding for protein involved in cell wall , cytoskeleton , and stress and defence  appear related to relevant cellular processes assigned in the functional classification. finally, the assignment of other important classes of transcripts, such as dna  and protein folding , transcription regulators , and signal transducers  provides new perspectives for data mining and for studies of coordinated gene regulation in developing maize endosperm. thus, ests corresponding to the majority of genes  are represented in the maize cdna libraries constructed, and the use of the maize zeastar unigene chip to examine endosperm gene expression appeared feasible.

effect of o <dig>  o <dig>  and o2o <dig> mutations on gene expression
the development of a zeastar unigene chip made it possible to analyze the patterns of gene expression in the opaque mutants herein investigated. microarray slides containing the entire zeastar unigene set were hybridized with probes derived from endosperm tissue of normal, o <dig>  o <dig>  and o2o <dig> a69y inbreds, harvested at  <dig> dap, a developmental stage in which the synthesis of starch and storage protein is known to begin  <cit> . to reduce hybridization artefacts, all probes were labelled both with cy <dig> and with cy <dig> and used in dye-swapping experiments on series of three independent slides. the expression data obtained were assayed for consistency by performing anova tests. replicates appeared to be in general agreement; thus, we are confident that the alterations of the transcriptomes described here are consistent with the biology of endosperm development. moreover, we selected a series of thirty clones, believed of particular interest and exhibiting distinct patterns of expression, for detailed analysis, using qrt-pcr to confirm the changes in expression levels determined using the arrays. rnas isolated from the four genotypes were used as templates for amplification. the relative expression levels determined by qrt-pcr showed good agreement with those determined using microarrays . this degree of agreement is consistent to that observed for similar experiments. . therefore, only the results of microarray analyses will be presented and discussed herein.

average signal values derived from the four probes used were plotted using a logarithmic scale. figure  <dig> shows plots of wt vs. o <dig> , o <dig> , and o2o <dig>  signal values as well as o <dig> vs. o <dig>  readings. figure 3a clearly shows the prevalence of genes showing distinct expression patterns in the wt and o <dig> genotypes. conversely, the wt and o <dig> genotypes show less evident differences in expression levels . the o2o <dig> double mutant exhibits differences in expression patterns resembling those obtained for the o <dig> genotype, which, considering the low level of difference in expression level shown for the o <dig> genotype, is not unexpected. however, a plot of o <dig> vs. o <dig> expression levels, clearly shows the cumulative effect of both genotypes and reveals a large number of genes with distinct expression patterns .

among the ests considered,  <dig> % exhibited a down-regulated expression profile. the o <dig> mutation was associated with  <dig> down-regulated ests,  <dig> down-regulated ests were identified in the o <dig> background, whereas  <dig> ests showed a reduced expression pattern in the o2o <dig> background. up-regulated expression profiles were found for  <dig> % of the ests considered. one hundred and thirteen up-regulated ests were identified in the o <dig> background,  <dig> in the o <dig> background, and  <dig> in an o2o <dig> background. these results are summarized in figure  <dig>  among the ests identified,  <dig> % exhibited significant homology with sequences deposited in public databases and could be unequivocally associated with known biological processes. a complete list of differential gene expression detected in the mutant endosperms, for the various functional classes as described above, in comparison with wild-type, is available in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  while a selection of the most interesting up- and down-regulated genes is given in table  <dig> 

est codes, wt over opaque expression ratios, ec descriptions, and databank homologies are indicated.

amino acid metabolism
several ests homologous to enzymes involved in amino acid synthesis were differentially expressed in the o <dig>  o <dig>  and o2o <dig> endosperms. in particular, ests homologous to phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase , cysteine synthase , methionine synthase , s-adenosylmethionine synthetase , and a methyl transferase , all enzymes involved in the ser, gly, cys, and met pathways were negatively affected in the o <dig> endosperm. however, neither of these showed a significantly altered expression level in the o <dig> and o2o <dig> endosperms . finally, the ile, val and leu pathways were affected in all three lines. ests homologous to acetolactate synthase  and ketolacid reductoisomerase , and involved in the biosynthesis of these amino acids were significantly reduced in expression in all three backgrounds, while leucine dehydrogenase  was significantly different from wt only in the o <dig> endosperm .

ests homologous to enzymes involved in tryptophan synthesis were affected in o <dig> endosperm. tryptophan synthase  homologues showed a significant reduction of expression in o <dig> endosperms, while anthranilate phosphoribosyl transferase  and anthranilate synthase  homologous ests were found to be differentially expressed in all three mutant backgrounds. the former showed a significant reduction of its expression level, while the latter appeared up-regulated by 50% .

carbon metabolism and redox processes
maize is an autotrophic organism that only needs minerals, light, water and air to synthesize organic compounds to grow, however, endosperm is a heterotrophic organ. a large proportion of its proteins support primary metabolic processes and synthesis of more or less complex molecules such as nucleotides, amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids and secondary compounds. accordingly, alterations in the expression levels of several genes encoding enzymes involved in these processes are expected in this study.

a large set of ests exhibiting differential expression amongst the lines analyzed showed sequence homology with enzymes involved in c metabolism, including the trichloroacetic  cycle and glycolysis. in particular, seven ests homologous to tca cycle related enzymes were identified all of which were down-regulated. four of the ests were down-regulated only in the o <dig> endosperm. these are related with oxaloacetate to citrate , isocitrate to 2-oxo-glutarate  and 2-oxo-glutarate to 3-carboxy-1-hydroxypropyl-thpp and s-succinyl-dihydrolipoamide  inter-conversions. the remaining ests, which could be associated with succinate to fumarate , malate to oxaloacetate , and lipoamide to dihydrolipoamide  interconversions, were differentially expressed in all three backgrounds . furthermore, ests associated with nine steps of glycolysis and exhibiting significant lowered expression patterns were identified. phosphoglycerate mutase , pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase , and dehydrolipoamide acetyltransferase  were found in the o <dig> background only; pyruvate kinase  and fructose biphosphate aldolase  were found in the o <dig> endosperm, while ests homologous to dehydrolipoamide dehydrogenase , pyruvate dehydrogenase , and enolase  exhibited a reduced expression in all three backgrounds . furthermore, several genes involved in the redox status such as cytochrome c oxidase/reduction, thieredoxin and pyrophosphatase were strongly negatively affected in the opaque mutations, while a h+-transporting atpase and a thiosulfate sulfurtransferase were greatly increased in o <dig> and o <dig> endosperms, respectively.

starch metabolism
our profiling assays identified six differentially expressed ests exhibiting sequence homology with starch and sucrose metabolism related enzymes. ests homologous to enzymes catalyzing the inter-conversion from α-d-glucose-6p into α-d-glucose-1p , from α-d-glucose-1p into adp-glucose , from adp-glucose into starch  and from amylose into amylopectin  were down-regulated in expression in the o <dig> background only. udp-glucose to sucrose conversion  appeared down-regulated in the o <dig> background, while udp-glucose to sucrose-6p conversion  appeared down-regulated in all three backgrounds .

storage protein synthesis
as expected, storage protein synthesis was greatly affected in the mutant backgrounds analyzed. in the o <dig> background, a reduction of the 22-kda α-zein transcription pool was observed, while a concomitant increase of 10-, and 50-kda γ-zein transcripts was seen. the o <dig> endosperm showed a marked reduction of 19-kda α-zein transcription levels, as well as a reduction of 10-, 27-, and 50-kda γ-zeins. the transcription level of the 18-kda zein class appeared increased in this background. finally, the o2o <dig> endosperm showed a reduced transcription level of the 10-kda γ-, 19- and 22-kda α-, and 27- and 50-kda γ zein gene pools.

transcription and translation
a series of ests homologous to genes involved in gene transcription and translation processes showed variation in the expression patterns analyzed. in particular, three putative mads-box domain transcription factors  were identified in the o <dig> background as well as two g-box binding factors and a yabby <dig> factor, a member of the yabby family of tfs, were down-regulated in o <dig>  the o <dig> endosperm showed differential expression of a putative mads-box gene, a putative myb family transcription factor and a homologue of the ocl <dig> dna-binding homeobox protein. it was interesting to note that in the o <dig> endosperm mutant the expression of the transcriptional regulator o <dig> is significantly down-regulated. additionally, ests homologous to the jab <dig> protein  and to a putative g-box binding factor showed altered expression in the o2o <dig> background. all ests mentioned showed down-regulation. it was also evident from our data that ests encoding proteins such as histone h2a, h2b and h <dig>  h <dig>  which are involved in chromatin function, were down-regulated.

signal transduction
in the endosperm mutants, particularly in o <dig> and o2o <dig>  the amounts of several transcripts involved in signalling by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation were reduced. the repressed genes encoded putative receptor kinases, protein-kinase-like proteins, ser/thr protein phosphatases, and auxin-binding proteins. it is known that these proteins play pivotal roles in regulating and coordinating aspects of metabolism, cell growth, cell differentiation, and cell division . the switching on and off of these genes is crucial for their correct function. our results also indicate that in the o <dig> endosperms the level of transcript encoding a protein phosphatase and a small gtp binding protein rab <dig> were increased. similarly, in the o <dig> and in o2o <dig> endosperms we noted an increase in a d-type-cyclin and in a putative nitrogen-activated protein kinase, respectively.

protein synthesis, turnover, and destination
the protein synthesis machinery plays an important role in endosperm development and its biosynthesis entails the co-expression of a number of specific proteins. in the protein synthesis categories, mainly the ests encoding putative ribosomal proteins, translation initiation and elongation factors showed, to various extents, a reduced transcription level in the mutant endosperms compared to wild-type endosperm. for example, ests homologous to translation initiation factors 1β, 3α, 4α, and 5α and to elongation factor 1β were reduced in expression in all endosperm mutants considered.

potentially also very interesting is the fact that several genes involved in protein degradation  appeared repressed in the mutant endosperms, with the exception of some ests  that are activated in the o <dig> and o2o <dig> endosperms. protein degradation can be part of the normal protein turnover process, but can also play an important role in the control of endosperm development or can be part of an ubiquitin ligase complex involved in signalling via protein degradation.

fatty acids, lipid, cell wall and cytoskeleton synthesis
the expression of some genes annotated as involved in fatty acid biosynthesis and oil storage were repressed in all the endosperm mutants. among the secondary compound category involved in cell wall lignification or cell wall polysaccharide synthesis, a range of genes encoding enzymes involved in cell wall growth  involved in the synthesis of cellulose are poorly expressed in the endosperm of the mutants. considering the cytoskeleton, in both endosperm mutants the down regulation of genes involved in tubulin and actin biosynthesis were observed.

transport and stress
the transcript levels of several genes involved in amino acid, lipid, protein and membrane transport were down-regulated in the opaque mutants. furthermore, down-regulation of the various transcripts encoding temperature-stress, inducible proteins, and pathogenesis related proteins were noted in the mutant endosperms. in o <dig> endosperm a putative low-temperature and salt responsive protein and putative pi starvation-induced proteins were significantly induced, while a heat shock protein hsp <dig> and a wound-induced protease inhibitor were increased.

discussion
as highlighted before, endosperm growth and development is a complex phenomenon that may be driven by the coordinate expression of numerous genes. approaches using spontaneous and induced mutants allow the characterization of the complex underlying gene expression system integrating carbohydrate, amino acid, and storage protein metabolisms, and operating during endosperm growth and development. the current work confirms other studies carried out on the o <dig> and o <dig> mutations , in revealing considerable qualitative and quantitative differences between the endosperm protein assets of these genotypes. the mutant alleles at these loci are both recessive, and when homozygous, repress mainly the higher and lower molecular weight α-zein subunits, respectively, with an accumulation of albumins, globulins, and glutelins. the major shift in expression from zein to non-zein genes is consistent with changes in the patterns of protein synthesis in the endosperm. moreover, in the o2o <dig> double mutant, the alleles act additively and possibly independently on zein synthesis. it is very likely that the different genetic backgrounds used in the various experiments may have an impact on storage protein synthesis by considering the exceptional haplotype variability in maize genomic regions containing zein genes . our data confirm previous findings that the o <dig> and o <dig> mutations nearly double the lys content in maize endosperm and, thereby, significantly improve the nutritive quality of the grain . furthermore, we found evidence in the opaque mutants herein investigated for high levels of other essential amino acids derived from the asp pathway , as well as for arg and gly.

to better clarify the role that o <dig> and o <dig> play in endosperm gene expression and to investigate their possible interactions, we have mrna profiled wild-type, o <dig>  o <dig>  and o2o <dig> mutant endosperms. the ability to concurrently profile the expression of many genes in a tissue provides a powerful tool for comparing endosperm mutants with their wild-type counterparts to understand their functional role in metabolic processes. although changes in gene expression  do not necessarily lead to changes in protein levels or to changes in developmental processes, the importance of transcription as a control point in development is well established for both plant and animal systems  <cit> .

in this study, the profiling of endosperm transcripts was obtained with the zeastar unigene set, based on the sequence information of > <dig>  maize genes, mainly derived from maize endosperm and covering a wide range of metabolic pathways and cellular and physiological processes. the number of genes identified in our study was consistent with other reports suggesting that at least  <dig>  and  <dig>  to  <dig>  different genes could be expressed, respectively in maize and wheat endosperms cdna libraries  <cit> . these numbers were also considered a minimal estimate in a similar investigation previously reported in maize  <cit> . to validate the observed alterations in developing endosperms, we have used qrt-pcr, which confirmed that the observations regarding transcript accumulation were accurate and consistent with the findings of other laboratories undertaking similar studies . they also take into account sources of variation inherent to microarray experiments  <cit> . thus, we are confident that the alterations of the transcriptomes described here are consistent with the biology of endosperm development and are both real and significant.

in agreement with previous results regarding the analysis of a range of opaque mutants  with an affimetrix genechip, our transcriptomic analyses demonstrate that the o <dig> and o <dig> mutants here investigated are very pleiotropic and influence several metabolic processes occurring in the developing endosperm  <cit> . the degree of the pleiotropic effect varied among the mutants: o <dig> has the smallest effect on global patterns of gene expression, consistent with the relatively small differences in protein and amino acid composition in this mutant compared to the wild type. by contrast, the large changes in protein and amino acid synthesis in o <dig>  replicated also in the o2o <dig> double mutant, are associated with large changes in the patterns of gene expression.

although, the type of microarray analysis discussed in this paper does not distinguish between direct and indirect effects, making it difficult to conclude whether and how a tf interacts with a potential target gene, the analyses of the changes in the transcription profiles of the o <dig> and o <dig> mutants allow us to formulate predictions regarding the biological role of these loci in endosperm metabolism. first, our findings are consistent with the role of o <dig> as a transcriptional activator. in fact, the o <dig> protein is known to regulate the expression of genes that encode the 22-kda α-zein gene family  <cit> . moreover, it controls the expression of other non-storage protein genes . second, one of the pathways affected by o <dig> activity is amino acid biosynthesis. it has been shown that o <dig> regulates the levels of lysine-ketoglutamate reductase, aspartate kinase, acetohydroxyacid synthase, an enzyme catalyzing the first common step in the synthesis of branched chain amino acids , and cyppdk <dig>  a key regulator of the glycolytic pathway, linked to c and amino acid metabolism and to the starch-protein balance  <cit> . this associated with its structural and functional similarity to gcn <dig>  a general transcription factor regulating amino acid biosynthesis in yeast , reinforces the hypothesis that o <dig> may be indeed involved in general amino acid control in maize endosperm  <cit> . in the current study, the transcription levels of various genes encoding key enzymes involved in amino acids were significantly affected in the o <dig> mutant. o <dig> also influences the expression of some genes of the amino acids biosynthesis, but only in few cases the mrnas affected are the same that are up- or down-regulated in the o <dig> mutant, suggesting that the o <dig> and o <dig> factors act on specific target genes. among the pathways affected by o <dig> and o <dig> mutants are those leading to the synthesis of the aromatic , asp-derived, and bcaa aminoacids. these pathways are deeply interconnected both in terms of c precursor supply and of allosteric interactions  <cit> . a complex interplay of regulators controls the metabolic flow through the aromatic, asp and bcaa-pathways, which includes feedback inhibitors of regulatory enzymes  <cit> . moreover, alterations in enzymes affecting amino acid metabolism have been shown to have pleiotropic effects on free amino acid levels in plant tissues. for example, frankard et al. found that a mutation in a key enzyme in the asp-pathway, a feedback-insensitive aspartate kinase mutant in tobacco, not only has a higher level of amino acids derived from the asp pathway, but other pathways as well  <cit> . guillet et al. reported that the alteration of trp and tyr levels in transgenic tobacco leaves affects the level of trp, as well as the aliphatic amino acids met, val, and leu  <cit> . furthermore, there is evidence indicating that glutamate is an allosteric regulator of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxilase  and pyruvate kinase  generating, respectively, oxalacetate and pyruvate, that, in addition to pep, are intermediate metabolites that play a central role in plant primary and secondary metabolisms, including amino acids biosynthesis  <cit> .

our results further indicate that o <dig> and o <dig> alter gene expression in a number of enzymatic steps in the tca cycle and glycolysis pathway that are of central importance for the amino acid metabolism in developing seeds. therefore, both o <dig> and o <dig> are expected to induce multiple effects on endosperm metabolism by modulating the glycolytic and tca pathways. an alteration in the expression patterns of glycolytic and tca enzymes in developing endosperm is related to the multiple pathways and demands on central enzymes of intermediary metabolism. in addition, during endosperm development, the active use of c precursors and energy from glycolysis is required for rapid cell division, and in the accumulation phase these resources may simply be redirected to storage compound syntheses. regarding glycolysis, evidence indicates that both regulatory and structural genes influence the glycolytic pathway  <cit> . because regulators of glycolysis have not been mapped in maize, it is also of interest to compare the activity of several key enzymes in this pathway. however, a systematic characterization of such enzymes will be necessary before any inferences are warranted.

in this context a further interesting observation resulting from this study regards the altered expression of several enzyme encoding genes, e.g. pk, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and enolase, involved in pyruvate metabolism, suggesting that o <dig> and o <dig> are, likely indirectly, implied in the regulation of this metabolite. recent results, obtained by constitutive over-expression of the maize tf dof, a member of the dof  tfs unique to plants, in transgenic arabidopsis was directly associated with the pepc gene expression, leading to a marked increase in acid contents, and a reduction of glucose  <cit> . in addition, transgenic expression in potato of a pepc insensitive to feedback inhibition by malate resulted in a shift of c flux from soluble carbohydrates and starch to organic acids and amino acids  <cit> , implying the ultimate link between c and n metabolism. thus, the o <dig> and o <dig> mutation may lead to an increased level of pyruvate by down-regulating genes encoding enzymes involved in the pyruvate metabolism providing a link between c and n partitioning.

a further outcome from our work concerns the down regulation observed in the o2o <dig> double endosperm mutant, in comparison to wild-type, of genes encoding auxin-binding proteins. the phytohormone auxin regulates a wide variety of plant developmental programs through various regulatory mechanisms, including auxin-binding proteins  <cit> . for example, in maize the synthesis of a number of seed storage proteins has been shown to be subjected to regulation by phytohormones  <cit> . moreover, recent evidence indicates that a reduced accumulation of auxins in the maize defective endosperm*-b <dig> mutant, due to down regulation of pinformed <dig>  a member of the pinform family of auxin efflux carriers, leads to a reduction in dry matter accumulation in the seed  <cit> . similarly, the cell wall invertase-deficient miniature <dig>  mutant exhibits several pleitropic changes, including a reduction in kernel mass and a detrimental effect on auxin levels throughout kernel development, indicating that developing seeds may modulate growth by altering tryptophan-dependent auxin biosynthesis in response to sugar concentration  <cit> . this has suggested a potential cross talk between sugar and auxin pathways. it is tempting to speculate, on the basis of the present and previous studies on the o <dig> and o <dig> mutants, indicating a reduction in kernel mass and an altered sugar metabolism, that a drastic imbalance of the sugar metabolism in the o2o <dig> endosperm mutant may be the cause of the observed down regulation of enolase and auxin-bindin protein gene expression  <cit> . however, further research on these versatile signaling switches will be needed to clarify this point.

a close examination of the expression patterns of genes involved in sugar and starch metabolism shows that both the o <dig> and o <dig> mutations create perturbations in the hexose/sucrose metabolism. it has been reported that sugars, such as glucose and sucrose, can act as signals to trigger changes in the expression of a broad range of genes, including genes associated with c and n metabolism, signal transduction, and post-transcriptional modification of proteins  <cit> . in addition, price et al. found that a large number of stress-responsive genes were also induced by glucose, indicating a role of this sugar in the environmental response  <cit> . moreover, one group of genes consistently affected in the opaque mutants, has been implicated routinely in stress responses. hunter et al. , reported that the opaque mutations disrupt the organization of α- and γ-zeins in the protein body and lead to the increased expression of cellular stress response genes, such as those encoding molecular chaperones, cell wall proteins, and wound- and pathogen-activated proteins <cit> . in this respect, segal et al. found that rnai-mediated silencing of the genes encoding the 22-kda α-zeins caused the mature endosperm to become starchy, indicating that the reduced synthesis of 22-kda α-zeins is sufficient to create the opaque o <dig> phenotype  <cit> . although further research is needed to provide direct evidence of these relationships, the up-regulation of these genes is a strong indicator of the deleterious nature of the opaque mutations and their perturbation of endosperm cell functions.

the regulation of gene expression is central to a myriad of biological processes at the molecular level and is mainly controlled by transcription factors and signal transducers. these are of special interest since they are capable of coordinating the expression of several downstream target genes active in metabolic and developmental pathways and may provide new perspectives for data mining and for studies of coordinated gene regulation in developing maize endosperm. additionally, tfs might be a powerful tool for the modification of metabolism and hence the generation of crops having superior characteristics because a single tf frequently regulates coordinated expression of a set of key genes involved in metabolic pathways. although different regulatory mechanisms involving o <dig> have been suggested earlier on the basis of protein-protein interactions, we have identified, in addition to o <dig>  other tfs that may be useful for clarifying the interaction between o <dig> and other putative tfs, such as mad-box, myc, and yabby  <cit> . this last small plant-specific tf family contain tf family contains seven to eight members in rice and six in arabidopsis, where they were shown to be involved in establishing abaxial-adaxial polarity in lateral organs and in restricting meristem nutrition and growth  <cit> . characterization of these genes in monocots is less advanced, but mutational and expression analysis suggest that their functions have diverged between monocots and dicots, with the monocot tfs lacking a central role in specifying abaxial-adaxial cell fate  <cit> . they may represent candidates for genes primarily or secondarily involved in the control of metabolic networks, and their analysis can help to elucidate endosperm metabolism. furthermore, o <dig> is able to recruit the maize co-activators gcn <dig> and ada <dig> to modulate transcription of chimerical genes, showing that o <dig> is able to interact with proteins other than the bzip type in heterologous systems. it is worth to mention that in the current study we have observed a sizeable reduction in the o <dig> endosperm of the transcription level of o <dig> and vsf <dig> , another bzip transcriptional activator, identified in tomato and involved in vascular development  <cit> . whether o <dig> affects directly or indirectly expression of other tfs remains to be clarified. however, it is clear that the down-regulation of o <dig> noted in the o <dig> mutant is not sufficient to induce an o2-like phenotype, because changes in the transcriptome of the two mutants are different and appear to some extent additive. therefore, it is likely that o <dig> is one of the components that may cooperate with other factor in regulating o <dig> expression via direct or indirect mechanisms. finally, our results indicate alterations in the expression profile of genes encoding protein phosphatases and kinases; these proteins, in turn, provide the means to transduce internal  and external  signals into transcriptional and/or chemical responses in cells. almost no protein phosphatases and kinases from seeds have been analyzed in the opaque mutants in detail, although evidence has shown that at the post-translational level phosphorylation of o <dig> protein modulates its dna-binding affinity  <cit> . in fact, these last authors have found that o <dig> proteins exist in the endosperm cells as a pool of differentially phosphorylated forms varying in their relative abundance and in the extent of phosphorylation.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our analyses reveal that o <dig> and o <dig> are very pleiotropic regulatory factors, affecting the expression of a broad range of endosperm-expressed genes involved in several metabolic pathways. here, the use of microarrays based on cdna libraries of biological samples enriched in endosperm tissue allowed us to identify with a good level of confidence a large collection of genes differentially expressed in endosperm mutants that were not previously identified through traditional analyses and in a similar study as reported previously  <cit> . the number of genes to be affected by o <dig> and o <dig> suggests that these, and in particular o <dig>  represent an evolutionary ancient factor responsible for modeling intermediary metabolism, which has been subsequently recruited for boosting the expression of α-zeins storage products. although, by necessity this paper is descriptive and more work is necessary to define gene function and dissect the complex regulation of gene expression, the genes isolated and characterized to date give us an intriguing insight into the mechanisms underlying endosperm metabolism.
