BACKGROUND
chronic food restriction increases central sensitivity to rewarding and motor-activating effects of psychostimulants and direct dopamine receptor agonists  <cit> . corresponding adaptive changes at the cellular level include increased psychostimulant-induced da release in nucleus accumbens core  <cit> , and upregulation of d- <dig> da receptor-mediated map kinase signaling in dorsal and ventral striatum, with consequent increased activation of creb and the immediate early gene, c-fos  <cit> . changes in striatal glutamate receptor function have not been investigated but are of interest in light of findings that  psychostimulants induce striatal glutamate release  <cit> ,  amphetamine-induced activation of striatal map kinase, creb, and c-fos is attenuated by a group i metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist  <cit> , and  the augmented effects of striatal d- <dig> receptor stimulation in food-restricted rats include hyperphosphorylation of the nmda receptor nr <dig> subunit  <cit> .

the group i mglurs  are of particular interest. group i mglurs are densely expressed in striatal medium spiny neurons  <cit>  and activate phospholipase c, resulting in hydrolysis of phosphoinositides and activation of ca2+-dependent signaling cascades  <cit> . the group i mglur agonist, dhpg, increases the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase  and the transcription factor creb when infused into dorsal striatum  <cit> , as do cocaine injected systemically and the d- <dig> agonist skf- <dig> injected into the lateral ventricle  <cit> . dhpg also elicits hyperlocomotion resembling that induced by da receptor agonists, and the effect is not attenuated by the d- <dig> da receptor antagonist, sch <dig>  <cit> . it is therefore possible that glutamate and group i mglur function contribute to the changes in psychostimulant-induced behavioral responses and striatal cell signaling in food-restricted subjects. the purpose of the first experiment of this study was to compare dorsal and ventral striatal cell signaling in response to intracerebroventricular  administration of the group i mglur agonist, dhpg, in ad libitum fed and food-restricted rats. a dose of  <dig> nmol was used based on pilot work and published reports indicating that this dose is sufficient to exert behavioral effects  <cit>  and stimulate pi hydrolysis  <cit>  while being below threshold for producing convulsive behavior  <cit> . a second experiment was based on results of the first experiment and sought to elucidate the observed increase in striatal erk1/ <dig> and creb phosphorylation in food-restricted rats injected i.c.v. with saline-vehicle.

RESULTS
experiment 1
in both the caudate-putamen and nucleus accumbens erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation was increased by food restriction  and by dhpg injection . however, there was no interaction between feeding condition and drug treatment in either brain region . this analysis supports the impression  that food restriction did not actually increase the group i mglur-mediated response to dhpg; rather, increased signaling in the food-restricted group, irrespective of i.c.v. injection treatment, appears to have summated with dhpg to produce a greater net effect in the food-restricted than ad libitum fed group. an identical pattern of results was obtained for creb phosphorylation .

interestingly, akt phosphorylation was induced by dhpg but did not differ between food-restricted and ad libitum fed groups in either the cpu  or nac .

in previous studies, striatal fos-immunostaining was greater in food-restricted relative to ad libitum fed rats injected i.c.v. with d-amphetamine or the d- <dig> da receptor agonist skf- <dig>  but not saline-vehicle  <cit> . therefore, in a small sample of ad libitum fed and food-restricted subjects, brains were processed for fos-immunostaining and revealed stronger dhpg-induced staining in cpu  =  <dig> , p < .01) and nac core  =  <dig>  p < .025) but not nac shell  =  <dig> ) of food-restricted, relative to ad libitum fed, subjects .

during the period between dhpg injection and sacrifice, rats, which remained in their home cages, did not display any obvious behavioral responses to the drug.

experiment 2
in rats without lateral ventricular cannulas that received no injection treatment prior to sacrifice, erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation did not differ between feeding groups  =  <dig> ; nac: t =  <dig> ), nor did creb phosphorylation  =  <dig> ; nac t =  <dig> ).

in food-restricted rats injected with glur antagonists prior to sacrifice, neither erk1/ <dig> nor creb phosphorylation differed from that observed in food-restricted rats injected with saline-vehicle .

discussion
adding to the results of choe and wang who demonstrated dhpg-induced activation of erk1/ <dig> and creb in dorsal striatum  <cit> , the present study has demonstrated dhpg-induced activation of erk/ <dig> and creb in both cpu and nac following lateral ventricular infusion. while i.c.v. injection allows for the possibility that these effects were not directly mediated by striatal group i mglurs, the proximity of striatum to the lateral ventrical and the high density of mglurs in these structures support the likelihood of direct effects. direct effects are also supported by the observed activation of akt which mediates group i mglur signal transduction  <cit> .

as previously seen in rats challenged with the d- <dig> dopamine receptor agonist, skf- <dig>  dhpg-induced activation of erk1/ <dig>  creb and c-fos were greater in food-restricted than ad libitum fed rats. however, the pattern of results in this study – i.e. augmented erk1/ <dig> and creb activation in food-restricted rats injected with vehicle, and no difference in akt activation between feeding groups – suggests that group i mglur signaling was not enhanced. rather, a cellular-activating effect of the injection procedure was enhanced by food restriction and summated with the effect of dhpg. this response of vehicle-injected subjects was clearly a response to some aspect of the i.c.v. injection procedure because similarly food-restricted rats that were not challenged in any way prior to sacrifice displayed levels of perk1/ <dig> and pcreb that were essentially identical to those of ad libitum fed rats. furthermore, the augmented activation of erk1/ <dig> and creb in vehicle-injected food-restricted rats was not mediated by akt because akt, though activated by dhpg, did not differ between food-restricted and ad libitum fed rats injected with vehicle or dhpg.

attribution of the augmented dhpg-induced erk1/ <dig> and creb phosphorylation to a "nonspecific" response to i.c.v. injection distinguishes the group i mglur from the d- <dig> da receptor. although a modestly enhanced erk response to i.c.v. vehicle infusion was seen in the nac of food-restricted rats in the prior study, the dramatically increased activation of erk1/ <dig> and creb by skf- <dig> in cpu and nac was dissociable from any response to the injection procedure  <cit> . even mild stressors are known to stimulate da  <cit>  and glu  <cit>  release in striatum, and it is possible that food-restriction augments this physiological response or the cell signaling induced by it. because the ionotropic  as well as group i mglurs are abundant in striatum and all three receptor types mediate map kinase signaling  <cit> , corresponding antagonists were injected i.c.v. and compared to vehicle. it was reasoned that if the physiological response to the injection procedure involves one of these glurs, erk1/ <dig> and creb phosphorylation would be decreased, relative to vehicle, in the group receiving the corresponding antagonist. the mk- <dig> treatment was also a potential probe for mediation by d- <dig> da receptors because d- <dig> da agonist-induced activation of erk1/ <dig> and creb are dependent on the nmda receptor in food-restricted subjects  <cit> . results of this test did not provide support for mediation by one of the glur types. because only one dose of each antagonist was used, these results must be considered preliminary. however, considering the proximity of striatum to the lateral ventricle, and the fact that the doses used have exerted measurable cellular, physiological or behavioral effects in other studies  <cit>  there is some doubt about involvement of glurs in the effect of "injection stress".

an interesting possibility to consider is mediation of the response by brain-derived neurotrophic factor . food-restricted rats have elevated striatal bdnf levels which appear to be involved in an enhanced neuroprotective response to diverse insults  <cit> . bdnf activates striatal erk1/ <dig> which, unlike glutamate-induced activation of akt, erk1/ <dig> and creb is not blocked by a pi 3-kinase inhibitor  <cit> . it is therefore possible that an enhanced bdnf-mediated activation of erk1/ <dig> and creb in food-restricted rats represents a neuroprotective response to intraventricular infusion.

CONCLUSIONS
the present results indicate that a group i mglur agonist activates akt, erk1/ <dig> and creb in both the cpu and nac. further, activation of erk1/ <dig>  creb, and c-fos are stronger in food-restricted than in ad libitum fed rats. the augmented response is not attributed to increased group i mglur function but, instead, to an augmented response of food-restricted rats to the i.c.v. injection procedure. some evidence casting doubt on attribution of the latter response to glurs was obtained. it will be of interest to evaluate whether striatal mapk signaling in food-restricted rats is generally augmented in response to stressors or whether this response is peculiar to i.c.v. infusion. in addition, it will be of interest to evaluate whether this physiological response is mediated by bdnf and its trkb receptor.
