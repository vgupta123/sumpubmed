BACKGROUND
insects are evolutionarily successful organisms and occupy almost all habitats in nature. an efficient immune system is one of the attributes for this evolutionary success. however, unlike mammals, the insects lack an adaptive immune system. the insect immune response is comprised of cellular and humoral components. the former involves the action of haemocytes in phagocytosis of microbes, encapsulation of large pathogens and nodule formation  <cit>  whereas the latter involves activation of prophenoloxidase cascade leading to melanisation of invading microorganisms  <cit>  and synthesis of a battery of anti-microbial peptides  <cit> .

insect immunity is well studied in dipterans such as fruit flies and mosquito species  <cit> . only limited information is available on genes induced on pathogen challenge in a few lepidopteran species that include the domesticated silkmoth, bombyx mori  <cit> , cecropia moth,hyalophora cecropia  <cit>  and tobacco hornworm,manduca sexta  <cit>  and in these too the immune response pathways employed to combat pathogen infections remain to be fully characterised.

abundant genetic resources are now available for b. mori, with a  <dig> x shotgun sequence coverage of its genome and more than  <dig>  ests in dbest   <cit> . with reference to insect immunity, the ests have been obtained from baculovirus-infected b. mori cultured cells and pupae, but no large scale information on bacteria-induced immune genes is as yet available.

in this study, we have constructed and analysed an immune transcriptome following bacterial challenge of the indian tasar wild silkmoth, antheraea mylitta, an economically important lepidopteran cultivated for silk production. prior information on immune response genes in wild silkmoths is lacking except for a few peripheral studies. two proteins from a. mylitta – a lysozyme protein, 3-d structure of which is elucidated  <cit>  and a protease inhibitor have been characterized  <cit> . we chose to examine the fat body transcriptome since it is a major immune organ in insects, analogous to the mammalian liver. we generated a total of  <dig> ests, of which 31% could be ascribed to putative immune functions. we also validated the upregulation of a selected subset of genes from the immune transcriptome by semi-quantitative rt-pcr.

RESULTS
as described in materials and methods, we constructed a cdna library from fat body tissues of e. coli- challenged a. mylitta larvae and randomly sequenced a large number of inserts from the library. by running tgicl program, we obtained  <dig> clusters from a total of  <dig> ests, of which  <dig> were contigs  and  <dig> were singletons. the majority of the est clusters were  <dig> to  <dig> bp, with an average of  <dig> bp and a maximum of  <dig> bp . each of these clusters potentially represents a unique gene from a. mylitta, and our results have hence expanded the number of genes known for this organism from the handful previously known genes. the  <dig> est sequences  can be accessed at the ncbi est sequence database, dbest and the  <dig> clusters can be accessed at url mentioned in references  <cit> .

blast analysis
the different ests were classified into categories such as immune-related, housekeeping, hypothetical insect proteins, hypothetical non-insect proteins based on the homology in ncbi protein blast . of the  <dig> ests,  <dig>  showed similarity to known or putative insect immune proteins; thus, even though the cdna library was not normalized, a significant proportion  of the transcriptome was represented by putative immune-related genes. a total of  <dig> ests  were homologous to housekeeping genes and proteins involved in functions other than immunity. functional class distribution of the ests is depicted in table  <dig>  based on the sequence similarity,  <dig> of the  <dig> ests were classified as insect-specific  and  <dig> ests  were common to both insects and mammals . the number of ests showing similarity to only the mammalian proteins was  <dig> and those showing similarity neither to insects nor to mammals were as few as  <dig>  gene ontology analysis of the est sequences was also carried out and the details are provided as supplementary data .

domain search
the sequences, which could not be assigned any function based on homology search in ncbi, were searched for conserved domains in prodom database. of the  <dig> clusters that had no matches with known proteins in ncbi blast, we could assign protein domain families to  <dig> clusters based on the prodom search . the remaining sequences did not show any hits in prodom and should be further analysed by other specialized computational tools.

signal peptide and transmembrane domains
we further screened the unannotated proteins  for the presence of signal peptide and absence of transmembrane domains. this characteristic of many of the immune proteins has been utilized to screen probable immune-related genes in large-scale transcriptome studies  <cit> , although the reliability of this criterion to identify the immune related genes remains to be experimentally tested. in the present study,  <dig> out of  <dig> genes tested fulfilled these criteria and could be considered as potential immune-responsive genes. however, since all the  <dig> clusters checked are not all full-length sequences, it is possible that we may have missed some others amongst them that represent gene products harbouring signal peptide without transmembrane domain, and hence the actual number may be higher.

putative immune proteins
a total of  <dig> clusters were assigned a putative immune function based on their similarity with previously characterized immune response genes and their distribution pattern is shown in figure  <dig>  these putative immune proteins were categorized into different functional groups – i. anti-microbial proteins, ii. pattern recognition receptors , iii. proteases and protease inhibitors and iv. putative defence proteins with unknown function. a subset of these putative immune genes  is represented with the details like genbank accession numbers, putative function, e-value  etc . homologues of several other proteins, implicated in immunity such as antioxidants, ferritins, transferrins, apolipophorins and apoptotic pathway components were also found, but are not further described here.

putative anti-microbial proteins
attacin-like proteins were the most abundantly expressed transcripts in terms of est copy number in the immune transcriptome . six different types of putative attacins accounted for 34%  of the immune transcripts. a previous study had reported the presence of four types of attacins in d. melanogaster  <cit>  and a similar study in immunized pupae of h. cecropia led to the isolation of six closely related types of attacins  <cit> . second in the list of highly expressed genes were cecropin-like proteins . three types of cecropin homologues were found in the a. mylitta transcriptome and a previous study in h. cecropia had similarly shown the existence of three types of cecropins  <cit> . three types of putative lysozyme transcripts were detected, one of which was homologous to a bacteriophage t <dig> lysozyme-like protein reported in b. mori that was later named, based on functional analysis, as a peptidoglycan recognition protein  <cit> . the second was homologous to the bacteriolytic lepidopteran lysozymes known to lyse the bacterial cell wall  <cit> . the third was a lysozyme-like protein that lacks one or both of catalytic residues essential for muramidase activity. this protein has not been reported in lepidopterans before and is homologous to dipteran lysozyme-like proteins of unknown function. three types of putative lebocins and gloverins, which are the lepidopteran specific anti-bacterial genes, were also observed in a. mylitta transcriptome.

the data generated in the present study conformed to the trend of anti-microbial genes being present as multiple gene families as observed in many other insect species and highlighted the essentiality of these genes in the organism  <cit> . another interesting finding with respect to immune response was the presence of a protein identical to seroin. this protein is reported to express in the silk glands of b. mori and is known to protect the cocoon from microbes  <cit> . a homologue of anti-fungal protein, gallerimycin, previously characterized from galleria mellonella and shown to be induced by lps injection  <cit> , was also found.

putative pattern recognition receptors 
prrs in the insects bind to and detect pathogen associated molecular patterns  like lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan, β 1– <dig> glucan, lipotechoic acid etc  <cit> . the putative prrs identified in the present immune transcriptome analysis were hemolins, peptidoglycan recognition proteins , gram-negative binding proteins , lectins and mucins. a. mylitta fat body transcriptome revealed two different proteins resembling hemolin, an immune inducible protein implicated in insect immunity  <cit>  and it would be worthwhile to study the function and specificities of the different proteins of hemolin family. three types of pgrp-like proteins were found in the a. mylitta immune repertoire in the present study as compared to d. melanogaster where  <dig> pgrp genes are known to be involved in the activation of the various effector pathways in immunity  <cit> .

putative proteases and protease inhibitors
various proteases and protease inhibitors regulate the diverse immune mechanisms like melanization, phagocytosis and induction of anti-microbial peptides  <cit> . a homologue of a prophenoloxidase activating protease characterized in b. mori and m. sexta  <cit>  was also found in the a. mylitta immune transcriptome. several other classes of putative proteases like cysteine proteases, serine proteases and metallo-proteases were also identified. as many as thirteen distinct serpin-like  and twelve potential protease inhibitors were detected in the immune transcriptome. five different serpins have earlier been identified in m. sexta and shown to differ in the induction pattern upon immune challenge  <cit> . in the light of these studies, the information on serpins and protease inhibitors from the a. mylitta immune transcriptome will prove to be invaluable in further understanding of various immune pathways in insects.

putative defence proteins with unknown function
several potential new members of known protein families were identified in the present study. among the new members, one was a putative lysozyme-like protein described in the previous section. an array of putative proteinase inhibitors and proteases were also found. many of them are new, and their study would enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of proteolytic cascades in insect innate immunity. a few immunoglobulin  like molecules were identified by prodom search . ig-like molecules- hemolin  <cit>  and more recently dscam have been implicated in insect immunity  <cit>  and it would be interesting to evaluate the role of these putative ig-like molecules in insects. among the potential immune proteins, we describe below in more detail four putative defence proteins , for two of which  we have confirmed the induction upon e. coli infection by semi-quantitative rt-pcr.

dfp- <dig>  dfp- <dig> and dfp-3
we have grouped these three proteins together, as they are 70–85% similar to each other . all of them have a signal peptide and appear to be secretory proteins. dfp- <dig> was abundantly expressed in the immune transcriptome suggesting its possible involvement in immunity. in addition, these three proteins showed high similarity to immune induced unknown proteins from other lepidopterans like hyphantria cunea, samia cynthia ricini,m. sexta and lonomia obliqua  <cit>  , as also with some hypothetical proteins from other insects and vertebrates in the ncbi database . analysis by position-specific iterative blast   <cit>  revealed similarity of dfp- <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> to the vertebrate extracellular matrix proteins , stromal cell derived factor receptor- <dig>  spondin and reelin and possessed the common domain termed as 'reeler' . these ecm proteins are involved in the central nervous system signaling and immune mechanisms like 'signaling' and 'pathogen recognition'  <cit> . stromal cell derived factor/receptor complex has been shown to activate jak/stat pathway and mediate the migration and proliferation of haematopoietic cells  <cit> . recently, mindin a protein belonging to the f-spondin family has been shown to act as a pathogen recognition receptor in mice  <cit> . also, spondin has been shown to be upregulated in drosophila upon bacterial infection by microarray analysis  <cit> . the similarity of dfp- <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> to molecules involved in immune responses in vertebrates further support the immune-related role of these new proteins.

dfp-4
this protein was particularly intriguing as it showed similarity to cecropin, the insect anti-bacterial peptides in the primary sequence blast analysis. the multiple alignment of the various cecropins and dfp- <dig> is shown in figure  <dig>  based on the signalp prediction, dfp- <dig> is likely to be a non-secretory intracellular protein, unlike cecropins that are secreted into the haemolymph. cecropins are small 5– <dig> kd peptides whereas dfp- <dig> is a  <dig> kd protein with additional unrelated regions at the n and c-termini. the exact role of dfp- <dig> is not clear and needs to be investigated.

expression profile
the transcriptome under study most likely represents a plethora of e. coli-induced genes in the fat body of the tasar silkmoth. we validated  <dig> putative immune response genes by semi-quantitative rt-pcr, and their expression profiles are shown in figure  <dig>  all but two genes, a putative protease inhibitor  and a seroin gene  were upregulated upon infection. the two dfps tested, dfp- <dig>  and dfp- <dig> , were induced by both e. coli and m. luteus. dfp- <dig> was highly expressed in all the tissues with a more prominent expression in mid gut whereas dfp- <dig> was exclusively expressed in fat body . we analysed the expression pattern of the aforementioned genes in larval tissues differentially challenged with e. coli  or m. luteus  and compared with challenged or mock-challenged  tissues as negative controls. most of the genes analysed were expressed more prominently upon infection with e. coli than with m. luteus suggesting that there may be differential responses towards different pathogens. two pathways of differential immune induction have been identified in drosophila. gram-positive bacteria and fungi induce the toll pathway whereas gram-negative bacteria evoke the imd pathway  <cit> , but the degree of conservation of these pathways between drosophila and lepidopterans is not known.

CONCLUSIONS
the immune response in insects is dynamic and different effector genes are likely expressed at different time points during infection, contributing to the ability of the insects to ward off infections in spite of the absence of adaptive immunity. the current transcriptome represents genes likely expressed upon e. coli infection in the a. mylitta fat body at  <dig> hrs post infection. unexpectedly, the imd pathway components that are implicated in the activation of various effector pathways upon gram-negative bacterial infection in drosophila were not present in our transcriptome. the 24-hour post infection period may have been non-optimal for expression of some genes, and since the est library was not normalized the less abundant transcripts may have gone undetected. alternatively, it is possible that other pathways are involved in the immune induction in the moths.

the present study has increased the repertoire of lepidopteran-specific putative immune response genes by several hundred-fold. this will be a valuable resource for lepidopteran-specific immune studies in particular and insect immune studies in general.
