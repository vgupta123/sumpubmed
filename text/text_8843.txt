BACKGROUND
in the past five years differential rna-sequencing  has become an essential technology for global analysis of gene expression allowing for the genome-wide mapping of transcriptional start sites   <cit> . however, such analyses of rhizobia in symbiosis with leguminous plants are still missing. rhizobia are soil bacteria able to infect plant roots where they induce the formation of root nodules and differentiate into intracellular nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. bacteroids convert molecular nitrogen into ammonium for the benefit of the plant in exchange for photosynthetically fixed carbon. this microbe-plant interaction is economically important, since rhizobia introduce fixed nitrogen into the global nitrogen cycle and act as an ecologically safe fertilizer. a prominent, rhizobial model organism is bradyrhizobium japonicum usda  <dig>  a symbiont of the soybean plant glycine max  <cit> .

b. japonicum usda  <dig> has a large chromosome of  <dig>  mb, with most symbiotic genes clustered in the so-called symbiotic island of 680 kb  <cit> . gene-specific deletion and genome-wide transposon mutagenesis studies uncovered many genes relevant for symbiosis and identified their transcriptional regulators , while microarray-based transcriptome analyses and proteome analyses provided more comprehensive catalogs of differentially expressed genes or proteins that may play a role in the adaptation from free-living conditions to the symbiotic life style within root nodules . previous analysis of tiling microarray data obtained from cells grown in free-living and symbiotic conditions revealed strong transcription in non-annotated regions  <cit>  and validated computationally predicted small non-coding rnas   <cit> . these findings suggest that the initial genome annotation may not be complete, and that additional genes likely remain to be identified.

recent advances in rna-seq revealed high complexity of the transcriptional landscape in bacteria, dramatically changed approaches to study regulation of gene expression, and allowed for detection of virtually all non-annotated genes and loci expressed under the conditions of interest . newly detected genes typically comprise short protein-coding orfs missed in the initial genome annotation, shorter transcripts originating from internal tss , and cis- or trans-encoded srnas that are hard to detect by other methods  <cit> . previously, several trans-encoded srnas have been detected in b. japonicum usda  <dig>  <cit> , but genome-wide detection of srnas has not been performed so far in this organism.

the differential rna-seq  method  <cit>  relies on the enrichment of 5′-ends of primary, non-processed transcripts. this allows for accurate genome-wide determination of transcription start sites , and thus the primary transcriptome under specific environmental conditions. the first global tss mapping was performed manually for the relatively small genome of helicobacter pylori  <cit> . subsequently, tsss in larger bacterial genomes were mapped, in several cases aided by the use of computational methods , but global mapping of tsss is still challenging.

the detection of an authentic tss  implies the presence of a promoter in its upstream region. bacterial rna polymerase recognizes promoters with the help of sigma factors, which, based on homology and mechanism of action form two families, σ <dig> and σ <dig>  <cit> . b. japonicum usda  <dig> harbors  <dig> members of the σ <dig> family and two σ <dig> paralogs  <cit> . in exponentially growing, free-living cells, the expression of housekeeping b. japonicum genes relies on the σ70-type σ-factor rpod, which binds to conserved boxes located  <dig> and 35 bp upstream of the tss  <cit> . functions and promoter motifs were investigated for only a few of other σ <dig> family members . in symbiosis, many genes for nitrogen fixation and associated functions are under the control of σ <dig> , which enables rna polymerase to recognize promoters with conserved gg and gc boxes located at positions – <dig> and – <dig> relative to the tss, respectively  <cit> . known promoter motifs in b. japonicum were identified by analyzing dna sequences upstream of a limited number of experimentally detected tsss. a global tss map containing nearly all tsss active under certain growth conditions and thus allowing genome-wide analysis of potential promoter regions  <cit>  will greatly facilitate future studies on gene regulation in b. japonicum and related bacteria.

the aim of this study was to generate drna-seq data of b. japonicum usda  <dig> grown free-living or in symbiosis with soybean to be used for genome-wide mapping of tsss and promoters, and for identification of new genes. to perform global mapping of tsss, we developed a tss-identification tool that uses machine-learning approaches to propagate expert knowledge initially applied to a subset of the data. for identification of new protein-coding genes, we used a proteogenomics approach. furthermore, we used our condition-specific tss map to predict and map promoters by a new algorithm, which is publicly available. finally, we provide an updated and extended genome annotation with mapped promoters, tsss and terminators in the generic feature format  <dig>  and the gene bank sequence format . we expect that these data will serve as a useful resource both for detailed analysis of specific genes and for systems biology studies of the symbiosis between rhizobia and legumes, as well as for future annotations of bacterial genomes.

RESULTS
drna-seq and read mapping
to establish a comprehensive, condition-specific tss map of b. japonicum usda  <dig>  we performed drna-seq with total rna isolated from bacteria exponentially growing in oxic liquid cultures  and from soybean root nodules . following the drna-seq protocol, one half of the rna samples was treated with terminal exoribonuclease , which degrades 5′-monophosphorylated transcripts. this resulted in the enrichment of primary, 5′-triphosphorylated transcripts . the other half remained untreated . enrichment of a 5′-end in the  library indicates a tss  <cit> .

overall  <dig> , <dig> reads were obtained,  <dig> , <dig>  of which were successfully mapped to the b. japonicum genome . for the free sample, 94 % of the reads were mapped to the b. japonicum genome, while for the nod sample, only 18 % were mapped due to a large fraction of soybean transcripts . in a previous drna-seq study with the plant pathogen xanthomonas campestris, the majority of reads from both  and  libraries mapped to rrna loci . in our study, however, ribosomal rna was considerably depleted after the tex treatments: in the  libraries, 15 %  and 19 %  of the reads belonged to rrna genes, compared to 69 %  and 59 %  of the reads in the  libraries. since bacterial rrnas have processed 5′-ends  <cit> , this indicates that in our experiments the tex treatment effectively depleted processed transcripts.fig.  <dig> differential rna-seq of b. japonicum usda  <dig> and tsss mapping. a cdna reads mapped to the  <dig>  mb genome. rna was isolated from exponentially growing, free-living cells  in liquid cultures and from nodules . rna samples were treated  or not treated  with tex. as expected, there are more reads in the nod libraries mapped to the symbiotic island compared to the free libraries . all libraries were adjusted to the same scale . b categories for tss annotation based on the genomic context: gtss, tss of an annotated gene; itss, internal tss  in sense orientation; atss, antisense tss ; otss, orphan tss, all tsss which do not fall in the categories mentioned above. c venn diagram, showing distribution of the tsss among the categories gtss, itss, atss and otss



tss detection by machine learning
to map tsss, we used a support vector machine  method of machine learning. we defined candidate tss as a peak of the salience function  with matching coordinates in the  and  libraries under at least one of the experimental conditions , and applied svm independently to free and nod pairs of the  and  libraries. the svm algorithm learns a model of a tss from a small, expert-curated training set, and applies it to the whole genome, allowing for automatic tss detection in large genomes . two training sets, comprising  <dig> peaks in free and  <dig> peaks in nod, were used to derive a svm model, which was then applied to  <dig>  and  <dig> peaks in free and nod, respectively. after svm filtering, we obtained  <dig>  putative tsss in free and  <dig> in nod;  <dig> scored positively in both conditions .

additional filtering was applied to putative tsss located within coding regions of expressed genes . in total,  <dig>  tsss active in free and/or nod were retained after these filtering procedures and mapped to the b. japonicum genome . this number is comparable to  <dig>  tsss mapped in the smaller genome  of the alfalfa symbiont sinorhizobium meliloti, detected under several growth or stress conditions in liquid cultures  <cit> .

to assess the reliability of the svm-based tss mapping, we compared our data to previously published results. our data matched  <dig> out of  <dig> previously determined tsss of genes expressed under symbiotic conditions or in free-living cells, i.e., under the conditions investigated in this study . well-known examples are genes blr <dig>  and blr <dig> . as expected, transcripts of these genes were detected only in bacteroids and the respective tsss bja_tss_ <dig> and bja_tss_ <dig> were mapped at previously determined genomic positions  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig>  <cit> . known tsss induced under conditions not relevant to our study either did not pass our stringent filtering criteria , or were scored but had low peaks consistent with low expression of the corresponding genes . these and additional examples summarized in additional file 3: table s <dig> demonstrate the quality of tss mapping based on drna-seq and machine learning.

genome re-annotation and utr length determination
to assess the coding and non-coding transcript repertoire, it is convenient to group tsss in categories based on their genomic context. since the tss categorization critically depends on the genome annotation and 5′- and 3′-utr definition, we first addressed these issues in more detail. we performed genome re-annotation using integrated services of genomics analysis   <cit>  and found that it better conforms to the drna-seq data than the present refseq annotation  <cit>  . the isga annotation, in which the original gene identifiers  of the refseq annotation were preserved, was the basis of annotation files in the gbk and gff formats , in which additional features were included .

using this annotation, we explored the genome-wide distribution of distances between mapped tsss and annotated genes in order to set 5′- and 3′-utr maximal lengths for tsss classification purpose. first, we analyzed the distribution of predicted 5′-utr  lengths, i.e., the distance from a tss to the start of the downstream gene or orf. we found that 5′-utrs are typically 20–40 nt long and rarely exceed 200 nt, and thus the maximal length of the 5′-utrs was set to 200 nt . the estimation of a maximal 3′-utr length was based on the consideration that as an antisense rna should overlap with the respective mrna, atsss should be often located at a short distance from the mrna. indeed, the distribution of distances between stop codons and downstream antisense tsss showed a prominent peak at 20–30 nt downstream of stop codons . this intriguing finding suggests that rna-based regulation at the 3′-end of orfs plays an important role in b. japonicum. antisense rna overlapping the stop codon may influence translation and stability of the cognate mrna, as well as transcription termination  <cit> . for tsss classification purpose, we set the maximal length of 3′-utrs to 100 nt.

tss categorization
the mapped tsss were categorized as shown in fig. 1b. the distribution of  <dig>  tsss among the categories gtss , atss , itss  and otss  categories is shown in fig. 1c and described below. all tsss are annotated in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  and their categories, svm scores and peak heights are listed in additional file 3: table s <dig>  note that as 5′-utrs and 3′-utrs of adjacent genes may overlap, many tsss are assigned to multiple categories simultaneously. accordingly,  <dig>  tsss are listed in additional file 3: table s <dig> 

gtsss
we detected gtsss upstream of 46 % of all annotated genes. this probably underestimates the fraction of the expressed genome since many bacterial mrnas are polycistronic. assuming that all genes in an operon are expressed, if they are located downstream of a mapped tss, we estimated that at most 62 % of the annotated b. japonicum usda  <dig> genes were expressed under our experimental conditions . typically, gtsss are located 20–40 nt upstream of the start codon of an annotated gene . additionally, gtsss were annotated for  <dig> of  <dig> operons predicted to be preceded by riboswitches  <cit> ; in this case the leader regions were allowed to be longer than 200 nt. further,  <dig> gtsss mapped  <dig> to 10 nt upstream of annotated start codons, with  <dig> mapped exactly at the start codon, suggesting that they correspond to leaderless mrnas.

itsss
itsss are the most abundant category of tsss in this study . a similarly high fraction of itsss was detected in s. meliloti , while in synechocystis sp., x. campestris and h. pylori the percentage of itsss was  <dig>   <dig> and 19 %, respectively  <cit> . a tss mapping inside an annotated orf may originate from  a gtss of a gene with a misannotated start codon  <cit> ;  a gtss of an overlapping gene transcribed in the same direction or of a sub-operon; or  a monophosphorylated 5′-end of an rna degradation product that was not efficiently digested by the tex. we analyzed the distribution of itsss  and found that the vast majority of itsss is distributed uniformly in genes, thus representing genuine itss candidates. in addition, this analysis also revealed clustering in the first 30 bp  and, although less prominent, in the last 30 bp of genes  . recent studies confirmed the presence of itsss in other bacteria and suggested a mechanism for internal transcription initiation by elongating rna polymerase complexes that still contain the σ <dig> factor  <cit> . however, 53 % of the itsss map to genes or operons without assigned gtsss . according to drna-seq data, these genes are not transcribed, suggesting that the majority of the itsss does not correspond to degraded mrna. nevertheless, we cannot exclude that some of the mapped itsss represent stable degradation products of primary transcripts whose 5′-ends are degraded very quickly thereby preventing the detection of their genuine tsss.

atsss
our data suggest substantial antisense transcription in b. japonicum usda 110: 28 % of all detected tsss are atsss  and they map opposite to 29 % of annotated genes  including symbiotically important genes like nifb, nifd, nifh and nifw . we note that 52 % of annotated genes with atsss do not have gtsss and are not expressed under the tested experimental conditions , suggesting differential expression of asrnas and their complementary mrnas. previous studies in other bacteria suggested that differences in the expression patterns of genes for asrnas and cognate mrnas prevent unnecessary mrna transcription under short-term environmental changes . however, despite the widespread occurrence of asrnas in bacteria, only for a small subset of asrna physiological roles were established  <cit> .

otsss
in addition to the above tsss associated with annotated genes,  <dig> otsss were detected . 11 % of all b. japonicum usda  <dig> tsss belong to this category, compared to  <dig>  % otsss in h. pylori  <cit> ,  <dig>  % in x. campestris  <cit> ,  <dig>  % in s. meliloti  <cit>  and  <dig> to 11 % in cyanobacteria  <cit> . the category otss corresponds to non-annotated transcripts, e.g., trans-encoded, regulatory srnas  <cit> . the definition of otss depends on the threshold length set for 5′- and 3′-utrs, which differ in individual studies: here we set 5′- and 3′-utrs of b. japonicum to  <dig> and 100 nt, respectively, whereas these elements were longer  or shorter  and 50 nt ) in comparable studies with s. meliloti  <cit>  and synechocystis  <cit> , respectively. this suggests that the higher proportion of otsss in b. japonicum reflects, at least partly, differences in the utr definitions. finally, otsss and also itsss could originate from pervasive transcription, which was recently suggested to play an important role in gene regulation and genome evolution in prokaryotes and eukaryotes  <cit> .

tsss in free-living cells and in bacteroids
we used the drna-seq analysis to compare the primary transcriptome of free-living b. japonicum to that of bacteroids in soybean root nodules. of  <dig>  tsss identified in this study,  <dig>  were detected in free and  <dig> in nod, with  <dig> being detected under both conditions . this is in agreement with previous transcriptomics data  <cit>  showing that a much lower number of genes  were expressed during symbiosis compared to free-living conditions  and can be explained by the non-dividing and thus transcriptionally less active state of nitrogen-fixing bacteroids  <cit> . the data also indicate one advantage of a drna-seq approach: due to the ability to directly map reads against two reference genomes, more transcripts were identified in symbiosis by drna-seq compared to the hybridization-based microarray analysis  <cit> , where these signals cannot be separated in a similar manner.fig.  <dig> tsss in free-living cells and in bacteroids. a venn diagram showing the numbers of tsss detected in free and in nod. b diagram showing the percentage of tsss mapped to the symbiotic island or to the entire genome and belonging to one of the following three categories: detected only in nod, detected in both conditions and detected only in free. light bars, symbiotic island; dark bars, entire genome. c boxplots showing the distribution of peak heights  in nod and free for tsss mapped to the entire genome or to the symbiotic island, as indicated. peaks corresponding to tsss active in both conditions  were assessed separately in the nod and in free libraries. horizontal lines are the median values



we mapped  <dig> tsss to the symbiotic island where many genes essential for the symbiotic nitrogen fixation are located. as expected, the symbiotic island is enriched in tsss active only in nod: it spans 7 % of the genome, and contains 7 % of annotated genes and 9 % of mapped tsss, but harbors 24 % of the tsss, which were detected only in nod. despite this enrichment, most tsss in the symbiotic island were detected only in free . together with the results from fig. 1a where genes most strongly transcribed in symbiosis mapped to the symbiotic island, this suggests that tsss detected only in free and mapping in this region are preferentially weak. analysis of the distribution of peak heights both in the symbiotic island and in the entire genome indeed revealed that in the symbiotic island the heights of peaks detected only in free were much lower than the heights of peaks detected only in nod .

our drna-seq and tss mapping results are in agreement with previous microarray gene expression data  <cit> . we mapped gtsss to 68 % of the  <dig> genes previously identified as expressed in symbiosis  <cit> . moreover, tsss of numerous genes shown previously to be up-regulated during symbiosis  belong to the tsss which were mapped only in nod .

protein translation evidence for tsss data
while drna-seq data provide a global picture of transcription, proteomics data contribute direct evidence on transcripts translated into protein products  <cit> . though massive efforts are required to describe a complete condition-specific proteome , this approach would provide a best possible complementary data set to a global condition-specific tss map.

to explore additional evidence for translation of transcripts with tsss identified here, we re-analyzed existing proteomics data of b. japonicum usda  <dig> grown under free-living conditions in rich psy medium or in minimal medium  <cit> , and in symbiosis with soybean   <cit> , cowpea  or siratro   <cit> . for this, we devised a novel variant of a proteogenomics approach that relies on generating an extended protein search database guided by the tss evidence for  orfs missed in the original refseq annotation, including short orfs which are typically under-represented in genome annotations  <cit> , here taken from the isga annotation ,  orfs that are longer or shorter compared to the refseq annotation, and  evidence for proteins encoded by transcripts originating from an itss.

in conditions corresponding to our drna-seq analysis, we were able to provide evidence for  <dig> protein groups, namely  <dig> in rich medium  and  <dig> in symbiosis with soybean . this included evidence for  <dig> new orfs from the isga annotation . furthermore, we provide evidence for  <dig> shorter and  <dig> longer forms compared to the refseq annotation, and  <dig> proteins corresponding to transcripts with itsss. notably, for  <dig> proteins we detected peptides confirming that both longer and shorter forms are translated. as one example, we show the combined drna-seq and proteomics evidence for two protein isoforms of regr, a response regulator important for nitrogen fixation . both isoforms were detected in free-living and symbiotic conditions . the isga genome annotation, promoter and tss mapping, combined with proteomics data support expression of an alternative, shorter form of regr.table  <dig> proteomics and drna-seq evidence for new orfs and longer or shorter proteins than originally annotated

fig.  <dig> combined transcriptomics and proteomics evidence for shorter or longer protein forms and new orfs. a genome region of bll <dig> encoding regr . predicted promoter motifs  and tss  along with drna-seq evidence from free and nod indicated the existence of a shorter regr form , whose expression is further confirmed by proteomics evidence. unique peptides  that provide evidence for both the long and the new, shorter protein form were observed; for clarity, the remaining peptide evidence is not shown. the tss bja_tss_ <dig> preceding the long form of the regr gene was mapped at genomic position  <dig> . the shorter form of the gene is preceded by bja_tss_ <dig> mapped at genomic position  <dig>  . note the different scales of individual libraries. for further details, see legend of fig. 1a. b venn diagram with the number of novel orfs identified by a previous proteogenomics study by kumar et al.  <cit> , and our proteogenomics approach that is additionally guided by tss evidence . c venn diagram with the number of new n-termini identified by kumar et al.  <cit> , who had searched for evidence for longer proteins, and our study, that also identified shorter protein forms. for b and c, the number of orfs supported by a tss is represented by the cross-hatched lower parts of the circles



overall, when including data from symbiosis with other host plants and growth in minimal medium, we identified  <dig> proteins . among them were   <dig> new proteins , identified over all conditions, which correspond to new isga genes, and   <dig> of the  <dig> proteins encoded by genes exclusively found in the refseq annotation . this shows that no single annotation contained all proteins identified here, and supports the need to integrate protein expression evidence into the genome annotation process  <cit> . the genes of these  <dig> proteins were included in our re-annotation files .

finally, we compared the newly identified proteins with those found in a previous proteogenomics study on b. japonicum usda  <dig>  <cit> . based on integration of our global tss map data and the extensive b. japonicum protein dataset comprising  <dig> proteins detected over all conditions, we found  <dig> proteins  not identified previously  <cit>  . in addition, we provide evidence for  <dig> shorter or longer proteins , compared to  <dig> longer proteins identified in the previous study  <cit>  . these results show that integrating drna-seq data with a proteogenomics approach can provide additional value for genome annotation.

prediction of promoter motifs using the tss map
a genome-wide tss map can also be exploited to predict specific promoter motifs. most known bacterial promoters are composed of two conserved sequence motifs  separated by a spacer of conserved length, which are located at a defined distance upstream of the tss and recognized by the rna polymerase sigma subunit  <cit> . to identify such promoter motifs de novo, we developed a computational algorithm, which analyzes the upstream regions of the detected tsss. to discover promoter motifs, we described promoter sequences using “patterns”, pairs of 6-mers at certain distance upstream of a tss, separated by a spacer of conserved length . we identified 6-mers co-occurring more frequently than expected by scanning all possible 6-mers at all positions . then we separated distinct groups of overrepresented motifs by the principal component analysis . we performed this analysis for all tsss, for tsss detected only in nod, in both conditions and only in free, and for tsss of the  <dig> leaderless transcripts .fig.  <dig> promoter motifs predicted de novo based on genomic regions upstream of mapped tsss. a schematic representation of a bacterial promoter: upstream 6-mer box , downstream 6-mer box . b promoter location distribution. location is a combination of positions of an upstream box , and tsss active in nodules only . circle size is proportional to number of motifs mapping in specific positions . c four motifs  similar to typical rpod-dependent promoters were found when the regions upstream of all tsss were analyzed. d a predicted rpod-dependent promoter  with an extended downstream  box  is shown. the – <dig> and – <dig> box of the predicted pas are in bold and italics, and the gc extension of the – <dig> box is underlined. the 63 nt region upstream of the tss was transcriptionally fused to the lac operon and beta-galactosidase activity measurements in b. japonicum were performed. the introduced mutations in the gc extension are indicated. shown are results from three independent experiments with technical duplicates with error bars depicting the standard deviation. e a motif detected upstream of leaderless mrnas. f a motif similar to rpon-dependent promoters was found, when the regions upstream of tsss detected in nod only were analyzed



motifs overrepresented in the total pool of tss upstream regions map to positions – <dig> and – <dig> upstream of tsss  and are shown in fig. 4c . when upstream regions of tsss detected either in both conditions or only in free were analyzed, essentially the same motifs were found . these motifs are similar to the typical – <dig> and – <dig> box-containing promoters recognized by the e. coli housekeeping σ factor rpod  <cit> . in addition to the ttg-n-tata consensus, each of the motifs has additional specific sequence features .

the extended - <dig> box gctata of motif iii was previously found in promoters of genes involved in biosynthetic or housekeeping functions in the α-proteobacterium caulobacter crescentus  <cit> . we confirmed experimentally the functional importance of this gc extension in the predicted promoter pas of asrna asr1-blr <dig> in b. japonicum . the comparison of the empty vector control strain  to the strain containing the wild-type sequence  confirmed promoter activity in the cloned region. the activity was reduced by g → a and gc → ag mutations in the gc extension of the – <dig> box.

the cttg in the – <dig> box  and the c upstream of the – <dig> box  were found in rpoh-dependent promoters in s. meliloti  <cit> , suggesting that motif iv and/or iii could be recognized by rpoh which is another member of the σ <dig> family of sigma factors. in b. japonicum, rpoh <dig> is one of three rpoh genes, and essential for growth under standard laboratory conditions  <cit> . it is possible that rpoh2-dependent genes, which are expressed under the conditions applied for our drna-seq analysis, are associated with promoter motifs iii or iv .

the motif found by the analysis of regions upstream of leaderless mrnas has an extended – <dig> box consensus tgnta . a similar motif is present in promoters of leaderless bacteriophages genes  <cit> . when we mapped this motif back to the genome, we found it upstream of  <dig> tsss, probably due to its similarity to rpod-type motifs . consistently, both types of putative promoters, rpod-like and leaderless-like, were mapped upstream of  <dig> tsss in our experiment. though leaderless bacterial mrnas have been shown to be involved in stress defense  <cit> , no specific promoters are described in the literature for this type of genes.

the motif found by the analysis of regions upstream of tsss detected only in nod is highly similar to rpon-dependent promoters , which are characteristic for many nitrogen fixation genes  <cit> . thus our results are consistent with the important role of rpon  for nitrogen fixation and life inside the nodule  <cit> .

overall, we predicted  <dig> rpod-like and  <dig> rpon-like promoters upstream of tsss . for  <dig> tsss, the simultaneous presence of σ70- and σ 54-type promoters was detected . candidate promoter sequences and their genomic coordinates are included in the annotation files gff and gbk .

out of all tsss, 33 % are preceded by putative promoters identified in this study. this fraction ranges from 40 % for gtsss or atsss to  <dig>  % for itsss. this suggests that despite the stronger stringency for scoring itsss compared to gtss and atss scoring, and despite the observation that most itsss were mapped in genes for which no gtss was detected , many of the mapped itsss may not represent genuine tsss and should be considered more cautiously than other tss categories. to address this point, we tested the upstream regions of five itsss  for promoter activities and verified three of them : bja_tss_ <dig>  and bja_tss_ <dig>  without mapped promoters, and bja_tss_ <dig>  with a mapped promoter. these results demonstrate the existence of real tsss among the itsss without mapped promoters.fig.  <dig> promoter activities of tss upstream regions. beta-galactosidase activities of b. japonicum usda  <dig> cells harboring plasmids with transcriptional laczya reporter fusions measured in exponentially growing cultures. fifteen tsss with scores between  <dig>  and  <dig>   were tested. the number of each tested tss , its bja_tss_locus tag, peak height  and score in free and nod as well as the presence of a mapped promoter in its upstream region are indicated. na, not applicable ; no, promoter was not mapped upstream of the respective tss; *, promoter was verified by mutagenesis ; **, the tss was validated in free although it was scored only in nod. the dashed blue vertical line separates the extremely low beta-galactosidase activity values indicating no promoter activity  from the higher beta-galactodsidase activity values validating ten tsss. the dashed red horizontal line separates tsss with scores below  <dig>  belonging to the class of low confidence from the high-confidence tsss with scores above the cut-off . bjrc <dig> and bjrc <dig>  previously analyzed srnas  <cit> . for pcyp, pint, pas, 3′-ser and 3′-asr, see fig.  <dig> below



our de novo promoter motif detection algorithm allows fast and sensitive promoter prediction with very large sequence and transcriptomics data sets. the algorithm, however, did not detect conserved motifs other than the typical rpod- and rpon-like motifs, although upstream of 67 % of all mapped tsss neither of these two promoter types were identified. this may be due to three major reasons:  our tool is targeted to detect only highly abundant motifs;  unknown motifs are not sufficiently conserved to be detected by the algorithm;  to avoid false positives we have chosen a too high threshold for promoter identification. nevertheless, our approach can be applied for global detection and mapping of promoters, as is shown by our prediction of rpon-like promoters upstream of well-known rpon-dependent genes  <cit> . notably, the rpon-promoter of the symbiotically important fdxn  gene, which was originally described as an unconventional but functional rpon-dependent promoter  <cit> , was correctly predicted by our algorithm. its score of  <dig>  belongs to the highest scores together with those of the rpon-dependent genes nifd , nifb , nifh , groesl <dig> , fixa  and the iscn homolog blr <dig> ;   <cit> . this indicates that the genome-wide map of rpon-like promoter motifs is a reliable tool for further exploring the regulatory scope of rpon.

experimental tss validation and definition of a tss class of lower confidence
to validate our tss mapping, we decided to test experimentally tsss with low scores. all  <dig> tsss that were previously identified by others and mapped by our svm method have scores between  <dig>   and  <dig>  . further, the tss of rpoh <dig> had the lowest score  of a previously determined tss mapped only in free-living condition . therefore we focused our validation experiments  on tsss with maximal scores of  <dig> , with emphasis on tsss with low peak heights and/or without mapped promoters.

the results for the  <dig> tsss tested in this work are summarized in fig.  <dig>  we confirmed promoter activities upstream of  <dig> tsss . six of the  <dig> validated tsss lack mapped promoters , and thus their promoters do not match any of the consensus sequences shown in fig.  <dig>  the highest promoter activity for a tsss without a mapped promoter was measured for no.  <dig>  an otss belonging to the previously described abundant srna bjrc <dig>  <cit> , followed by no.  <dig>  an itss located in the middle of bll <dig> .

next we analyzed the score distribution of all mapped tsss, the  <dig> experimentally validated ones and the five tss that we failed to validate . we also visualized the score distribution of  <dig> gtsss assigned to  <dig> novel proteins which were identified by our proteomics approach providing independent experimental evidence for these tsss. the histogram and density plots in figs.  <dig> and  <dig> show that despite the relatively low number of proteomics-supported tsss, their scores are distributed similarly to the scores of all mapped tsss.fig.  <dig> tss score distribution in free. red, all tsss mapped in free; blue, tsss  of novel proteins  mapped in free; black crosses, literature tsss; violet crosses, tsss validated in this work; orange crosses, tsss with failed validation; vertical dashed line at  <dig> , score cut-off. a histogram of score distribution. b density plot of score distribution. the density plot allows us to compare score distributions of tsss of novel proteins to the score distribution of all tsss, despite considerable difference in number of respective tsss. a negative score means that the tss was not scored in one of the conditions

based on the results summarized in figs.  <dig> and  <dig>  we set a score cut-off of  <dig>  separating tsss of high and low confidence. the scores of all five tsss that we failed to validate were below  <dig> , and all six tsss with scores of  <dig>  or higher, which we tested, were validated . further, as mentioned above, all tsss validated previously by others have scores above this cut-off. moreover, in symbiosis the majority of the tsss of genes encoding novel proteins have scores above  <dig>  , and in free-living conditions approximately at this score value the density of tsss of novel proteins starts to be higher than the density of all tsss . thus we labeled all mapped tsss with scores below  <dig>  as “a class of lower confidence tsss” . it is important to note that this class comprises some real tsss: we validated four out of the nine tested tsss with scores below  <dig>   and 9 % of the tsss of genes encoding novel proteins have scores below  <dig> . to the tsss above this cut-off belong 86 % of all mapped tsss: 90 % of the gtsss, 82 % of the itsss, 86 % of the atss and 86 % of the otsss .

analysis of tsss preceded by weak promoters
among the tsss with the lowest promoter activities , only tss no.  <dig> has a mapped promoter . we validated this promoter by mutagenesis of the predicted – <dig> and – <dig> boxes, which completely abolished its activity . thus, we unambiguously verified bja_tss_ <dig>  a tss with a low peak height  and a low score , which belongs to the newly annotated gene bll0506_isga, which was also identified by our proteogenomics approach.fig.  <dig> validation of a tss and a promoter of the newly annotated and proteomics-supported gene bll0506_isga. a the bll0506_isga locus with cdna reads and mapped tsss  and promoters . the analyzed tss bja_tss_ <dig> with a low peak height and a low-score , and its rpod-like promoter are in dark red; non-analyzed tsss and promoter are in light red. the bll0506_isga mrna is shown as a bar with differently colored regions: grey, the annotated bll <dig> orf; dark red, the here verified 5′-utr; light red, a proposed upstream part of a longer 5′-utr. b the wild type sequence upstream of bja_tss_ <dig> containing the rpod-like promoter  and the mutated version mutp <dig>  bases subjected to mutagenesis are underlined. for other descriptions see the legend of fig. 4d. c beta-galactosidase activity measurements in b. japonicum. the wild-type and mutated versions of the 41 nt-region upstream of bja_tss_ <dig>  were transcriptionally fused to the lac operon. shown are results from three independent experiments with technical duplicates and error bars depicting the standard deviation



to provide additional support for the tsss no.  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , we decided to validate them also under additional conditions. the tsss no.  <dig> and  <dig> correspond to a sense and an antisense rnas , which overlap with the 3′-utr of ntrc , a gene encoding a regulator of nitrogen metabolism  <cit> . figure 9b shows that their promoter activities are higher in the stationary than in the exponential growth phase, suggesting a growth-stage-specific regulation which may also influence ntrc expression. tss no.  <dig> is the gtss of blr <dig>  a gene encoding a cytochrome p <dig> protein  and known to be highly expressed in nodules . the promoter activity  was similar in aerobic exponential and stationary growth phase cultures, and was slightly lower under microaerobiosis , a condition which is known to induce many symbiosis-relevant genes  <cit> . the last result is consistent with previous microarray data and suggests that blr <dig> is specifically induced in symbiosis  <cit> .fig.  <dig> promoter activities in the 3′-region of ntrc and upstream of blr <dig> under different conditions. a the 3′-region of ntrc with two convergent tsss without mapped promoters: bja_tss_ <dig> of the srna 3′-ser and bja_tss_ <dig> of the asrna 3′-asr . b the promoter activities of the regions upstream of the two tsss shown in a were measured in the exponential and stationary growth phases. c the blr <dig> locus with three tsss: bja_tss_ <dig> preceded pcyp, bja_tss <dig> preceded by pint and bja_tss_ <dig> preceded by pas . d the activities of the promoters pcyp and pint were measured in aerobic cultures grown to the exponential and stationary growth phase, and in exponentially growing cultures under microoxic conditions. for the analysis of pas, see fig. 4d. a and c show cdna reads, mapped tsss , mapped promoters , tss upstream regions with promoter activities lacking mapped promoters , a mapped terminator , mrnas  and new transcripts . b and d show the results from beta-galactosidase measurements in b. japonicum. respective 200 nt tss upstream regions were cloned in front of the lac-operon. shown are results from three independent experiments with technical duplicates and error bars depicting the standard deviation



between the tsss preceded by pcyp  and pas  we mapped an additional itss with a promoter pint , the activity of which was similar in the exponential and stationary growth phase and under microaerobiosis . the convergent arrangement of pint and pas suggests that they may influence each other and/or the expression of blr <dig>  <cit> . to address the role of blr <dig> and its asrna asr1-blr <dig> , we overproduced the asrna from a plasmid in the sense and antisense direction, both in free-living cells and in bacteroids, but this had no effect on the blr <dig> mrna level . it is noteworthy that the tsss no.  <dig> and  <dig> preceded by pcyp and pint were validated in free living conditions, but were scored only in symbiosis .

in summary, we were able to map a set of tsss with low scores and low peak heights and to predict corresponding promoters. thus, our tss map enables detection not only of highly expressed transcripts, but also of low-abundant ones.

CONCLUSIONS
we analyzed the primary transcriptome of the soybean symbiont b. japonicum usda  <dig> grown under free-living and symbiotic conditions, and provide the first genome-wide tss and promoter maps for this bacterium. tss recognition was performed with a specialized tool based on machine learning which enabled fast and sensitive global mapping of  <dig>  tsss in free-living bacteria and  <dig> tsss in bacteroids within the large b. japonicum genome. the tss map served as a basis for de novo prediction of promoter motifs with similarity to rpod- and rpon-dependent promoters by a new algorithm. the algorithm is publicly available and will be useful for de novo prediction of bacterial promoters. combining the global tss map with a proteogenomics approach proved to be a powerful solution and led to an extension of the repertoire of protein-coding genes, providing evidence for  <dig> new proteins and identifying different n-termini for  <dig> proteins compared to the existing annotation. the score distribution of previously mapped tsss, tsss validated in this study and tsss of new protein genes allowed us to define a score threshold that flags a lower confidence class of tsss. this lower confidence class contains some functional tsss of weakly expressed genes. mapped tsss and promoters were included in re-annotation files along with the proteomics evidence and predicted terminators and operons. our updated and extended annotation is a valuable resource for both future systems biology studies or for in-depth analyses of specific genes and their regulation in b. japonicum and related bacteria.
