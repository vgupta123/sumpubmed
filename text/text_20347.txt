BACKGROUND
avian infectious bronchitis  is an acute and highly contagious disease of the upper-respiratory tract caused by the infectious bronchitis virus . the virus is a member of the coronaviridae family and has numerous serotypes and strains. rapid replication combined with high mutation rate and recombination are the main causes of the observed high diversity  <cit> . the respiratory tract is the primary target organ and entry point for the virus, before further spread to kidneys and gonads. the most common symptoms of ib are related to the respiratory tract and include gasping, coughing, sneezing, tracheal rales, and nasal discharge  <cit> . feed conversion and average daily gain are affected in broilers, and infection is often followed by secondary bacterial infections. in layers, ibv causes a reduction in egg production and egg quality. today, ib is one of the most economically important diseases in the poultry industry  <cit> .

infection outbreaks are controlled by a combination of strict management practices and vaccination. the strict management practices, which include the maintenance of the housing temperature and ventilation, are essential, because ibv is highly contagious and spreads very fast. live attenuated and inactivated vaccines are widely used for control and prevention of ibv infection  <cit> . as there is little or no cross-protection between different serotypes/variants of the virus, hence vaccines should contain serotypes present in a particular area in order to induce adequate protection  <cit> . new multi-strain vaccines with the optimal antigen combination and optimal adjuvants are therefore required for future ibv control. understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the interaction between innate and adaptive immune responses to ibv infection is a crucial element for further improvements of the vaccines.

ibv infection induces a wide range of immune responses in chickens. an innate immune response is activated during the initial stages of infection in the mucosal lining of the trachea following binding of ibv virions to receptors on epithelial cells  <cit> . activation of this innate immune response may be initiated by toll-like receptor  signaling upon ibv recognition  <cit> . in addition, rapid activation of natural killer  cells has been observed one day after ibv infection  <cit>  as well as increased macrophage numbers in lungs and trachea after primary ibv infection  <cit> . in the case of the adaptive immune responses, t lymphocyte subpopulations are actively involved in the early stages of ibv clearance  <cit>  exhibiting rapid activation upon ibv infection  <cit> . furthermore, studies have shown that cytotoxic t lymphocytes  play an important role in responding to primary infections with ibv  <cit> . in addition to t cell responses, ibv specific antibodies, of all three antibody classes present in chickens, have been reported . a specific local antibody response in avian infectious bronchitis is characteristic for the response to a secondary infection  <cit> . the innate and adaptive immune systems are strongly interconnected, which is also seen in the response to ibv infection, and the connection possibly involves the serum collectin, mannose-binding lectin  as a key player  <cit> .

two chicken lines which were selected for high and low mbl serum concentrations , were used in the present study. selective breeding has been performed for  <dig> generations using the combination of two strains  as a starting population, as described by juul-madsen et al.  <cit> . the final result was two divergent lines, with mean mbl serum concentrations of  <dig>  μg/ml for the l10h line and  <dig>  μg/ml for the l10l line, respectively  <cit> . the mean mbl serum concentration for  <dig> different chicken lines representing both broilers and layers is around 6 μg/ml, but varies from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μg/ml in normal healthy chickens with protein produced in the liver as the main source of circulating mbl  <cit> . in chickens, a positive correlation between mbl serum concentrations and the severity of several infections, such as infections caused by ibv  <cit> , escherichia coli  <cit>  and pasteurella multocida  <cit> , has been observed. chicken mbl binds to ibv  <cit> , therefore it is possible that mbl facilitates innate responses such as opsono-phagocytosis, complement activation or virus neutralization, in the early stages of ibv infection. in mammals mbl has also been shown to influence induction of adaptive immunity  <cit> . in support of the role of mbl in response to ibv, kjaerup et al.  <cit>  observed considerable differences in cellular adaptive immune parameters in response to an ibv infection between lines l10l and l10h. furthermore, birds from l10h line exhibited lower viral loads and less severe damage of tracheal cilia following the ibv infection in comparison to birds from the l10l line.

the aim of this study was to characterize the spleen transcriptome of healthy birds from the two lines selected for serum mbl, and to investigate differences in molecular mechanisms behind the development of systemic adaptive immunity between the l10l and l10h lines infected with ibv.

RESULTS
animal experiment
the experimental timeline and sampling time points are as illustrated in fig.  <dig> and a full description of the experimental infection is reported by kjaerup et al.  <cit> . the birds were infected at 3 weeks of age and from day  <dig> post-infection , showed clinical signs characteristic of ibv infection, including sneezing and labored breathing. viral loads in tracheal swabs were assessed for all birds as reported in the previous paper published on the experimental infection study  <cit>  . no virus was detected in the uninfected birds at any time point throughout the experiment. viral genomes were detected in swabs from infected birds from day  <dig> to  <dig> p.i. notably, significantly lower viral loads  were observed in birds from line l10h in comparison to infected birds from line l10l  <cit> .fig.  <dig> structure and timeline of the experiment together with comparisons of gene differential expressions. the figure illustrates the experimental timeline together with the structure of the experiment. in total,  <dig> birds,  <dig> from each experimental line, l10h and l10l, were used. in addition, differential expression comparisons are shown



detection and quantification of splenic gene expression
rna sequencing data were produced from eight infected and eight uninfected birds from each of the two lines at two sampling occasions, as described in the materials and methods section. all samples passed quality control measures for raw and trimmed sequenced reads except for individual no.  <dig>  which was removed due to a very low number of sequenced reads. for the remaining birds, an average of over  <dig> million reads were obtained per sample for the  <dig> samples analyzed, with 81 % of the reads mapping to the chicken genome reference sequence, as described in the materials and methods section . in total,  <dig>  expressed genes were identified. after filtering genes with fewer than one read per million in eight samples  <cit>  , the final list contained  <dig>  expressed genes. before performing the differential gene expression analysis, further multivariate analysis was carried out on the raw and normalized gene count data to identify any discrepancies.

multi-dimensional scaling  plot on expressed genes between the two lines, l10h and l10l, showed that they differ considerably in their transcriptome profiles for both uninfected and ibv-infected birds . moreover, inter-individual variation in gene expression at week  <dig> was considerably higher than that observed at week  <dig> for both uninfected and ibv-infected birds .

birds  <dig> and  <dig> were separated from the rest on the mds plot . however, inspection of raw sequence data and mapping parameters did not identify any technical problems which would explain the observed out-grouping of these birds. in addition an interclass principal component analysis  was performed using raw and normalized gene counts. the interclass pca revealed that the birds  <dig> and  <dig> were placed outside the 95 % confidence intervals of their respective treatments . however, the pca did not identify any gene having extreme count profiles which may have contributed to the transcriptome dispersion of birds  <dig> and  <dig> with respect to their treatment groups. although there was no clear technical or biological explanation for their out-grouping, these samples were removed from further analysis.

identification of differentially expressed genes
differential gene expression analysis was performed to compare the two chicken lines  at two time points for uninfected  and ibv-infected birds . a large number of genes were differentially expressed  between l10l and l10h lines at weeks  <dig> and  <dig>  for both uninfected and ibv-infected birds .table  <dig> summary statistics of differentially expressed  genes at fdr <  <dig>

we identified  <dig>  and  <dig>  de genes for the uninfected birds between lines l10l and l10h at weeks  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . in total  <dig> genes had higher expression in l10h line and  <dig>  had higher expression in line l10l for the uninfected birds at week  <dig>  and  <dig> genes had higher expression in l10h line and  <dig> genes had higher expression in l10l line for uninfected birds at week  <dig> .

comparing ibv-infected l10h and l10l birds, we identified  <dig>  and  <dig> de genes at weeks  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . in total  <dig> genes had higher expression in line l10h and  <dig>  had higher expression in line l10l at week  <dig> and at week  <dig>   <dig> had higher expression in line l10h and  <dig> had higher expression in line l10l .

there were also status-related changes in gene expression as shown in the venn diagram . at week  <dig>  the total number of de genes in uninfected birds between the two lines was  <dig>   which is lower comparing to  <dig>  de genes in infected birds between the two lines . out of  <dig>   de genes for both uninfected and infected birds between the two lines only  <dig>  were common for two comparisons . at week  <dig>  the total number of de genes in uninfected birds between the two lines was  <dig>   which was higher comparing to  <dig>  in infected birds between the two lines . when comparing the uninfected and infected birds between the two lines,  <dig>  genes were common out of total of  <dig>  de genes for both comparisons .fig.  <dig> venn diagram of differentially expressed  genes between comparisons of uninfected and infected birds at different time points. a differentially expressed  genes between lines when the lines are uninfected  and infected . numbers in the intersection correspond to de genes that are in common between lines for uninfected and ibv infected birds at week  <dig>  b de genes between lines when the lines are uninfected  and infected . numbers in the intersection correspond to de genes that are in common between lines for uninfected and ibv infected birds at week  <dig>  numbers outside of circles represent sum of de genes presented in circles



moreover, we also performed differential gene expression analysis to compare two time points  in the two chicken lines  for uninfected  and ibv-infected birds . finally, differential gene expression analysis was also conducted to compare the two infection states  at two time points for the l10l chicken line  and the l10h chicken line . as our main aim was to investigate differences between the two chicken lines, we only presented and discussed results related to the comparisons between the two chicken lines . results for the rest of comparisons  were provided in the form of supplementary materials .

functional analysis of differentially expressed genes
an enrichment gene set analysis was carried out to identify over-represented gene ontology  “immune system process” terms using the lists of de genes from comparisons between uninfected and infected birds from the two lines at  <dig> and 3 weeks p.i. the most enriched go immune system terms between the two lines when comparing uninfected birds from the two lines and then infected from the two lines are shown in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> functional map of differentially expressed genes enriched for go immune system terms. the top categories of the go immune system terms associated with differentially expressed  genes. all categories were statistically significant . the chart fragments represent the number of genes associated with the terms as a proportion of the total number of genes within the respective go term. terms which have not been grouped are shown in grey



go immune system terms associated with genes that were differentially expressed between the two lines for uninfected birds at week  <dig> were “lymphocyte activation involved in immune response” , “activation of innate immune response” , “lymphocyte mediated immunity” , and “leukocyte differentiation”  . in total,  <dig> de genes were mapped to the go immune system terms . among the de genes, tgfb <dig> , il <dig> , fkbp1b , fas  and ptpn <dig>  had a higher expression in line l10h compared with l10l . furthermore, the line l10h had a lower expression for a subset of innate immune genes: tyro <dig> , traf <dig>  and tlr <dig>  compared with l10l .fig.  <dig> differentially expressed genes associated with the go immune system term. heatmap representation of the differentially expressed  genes associated with the go immune system terms for the four comparisons between the two lines, l10h and l10l, uninfected and infected groups at two time points, weeks  <dig> and  <dig>  the heat map is constructed using the average values of counts per millions for each group



for uninfected birds at week  <dig>  the most enriched go immune system terms were “somatic recombination of immunoglobulin genes involved in immune response”  and the “adaptive immune response based on somatic recombination of immune receptors built from immunoglobulin superfamily”  . in total,  <dig> de genes mapped to go immune system terms in this comparison . among the de genes that had a higher expression in the line l10h at week  <dig>  in the uninfected group, were il <dig>  fkbp1b, fas and ptpn <dig>  which were also seen differentially expressed between lines at week  <dig> .

comparing infected birds from the two lines, at week  <dig>  “alpha-beta t cell activation” , “activation of innate immune response”  and “leukocyte differentiation”  functions were the three most enriched go immune system terms . cxcr <dig> , ptpn <dig> and fas were among the most highly expressed genes in l10h .

the major go immune system term that was strongly enriched for in the infected birds at week  <dig> was “positive regulation of leukocyte activation”  . among the de genes with higher expression in the l10h line were cxcr <dig>  vcam <dig> , ptpn <dig> and jmjd <dig>  .

discussion
the present study used two lines, l10l and l10h, which have been divergently selected for high and low mbl serum concentration for  <dig> generations, respectively. these two lines have earlier been extensively used for immunological studies and exhibit differences in immunological parameters after being challenged with several pathogens  <cit> .

the spleen is a secondary lymphoid organ where innate and adaptive immune responses can be efficiently mounted. in addition, the avian spleen is considered to play a very important immunological role because avian lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes are poorly developed  <cit> . the transcriptome differences in the spleen between the two lines, l10l and l10h, for uninfected  and ibv-infected birds were investigated, focusing on the differential expression of immune-related genes within significantly enriched immune-related go terms. large differences in transcriptome profiles were observed between birds from the two lines, both uninfected  and following the experimental ibv challenge . this suggests that selection for mbl serum levels in the two lines had a much wider effect which goes beyond the expression of the mbl gene  <cit> . the observed transcriptome differences can probably be attributed to correlated response to selection  <cit>  or random genetic drift  <cit> . correlated selection occurs when a trait is affected by selection on a another trait and is dependent on a genetic correlation between the two traits, which is well known in animal breeding  <cit> . alternatively, random genetic drift could contribute to the observed differences, considering that the founder population of the two lines was small  <cit> .

focusing on the expression of immune-related genes: at week  <dig>  the uninfected birds showed differences in the expression of genes involved in both adaptive immunity and innate immunity-related pathways . in addition, the line l10h had a lower expression for the subset of the innate immune genes, tyro <dig>  traf <dig> and tlr <dig> at week  <dig> . tyro <dig> encodes tyrosine-protein kinase receptor  <dig>  which is involved in inhibition of tlr signaling pathways and tlr-induced cytokine signaling pathways. these two pathways influence immune-related processes, including cell proliferation/survival, cell adhesion and migration and inhibits the innate inflammatory response to pathogens  <cit> . traf <dig> encodes a cytoplasmic signaling protein, which plays a critical role in the regulation of antiviral response and viral evasion . tlr <dig> was also among the de innate immunity-related genes with higher expression in the line l10h. chicken tlr <dig> has been shown to play a part in the response to ibv infections  <cit> .

in addition to the differences in the expression profiles for a subset of innate immune genes, the two lines also differed in their expression of adaptive immune genes. uninfected birds from l10h had a higher gene expression compared to the line l10l, for tgfb <dig>  il <dig>  fkbp1b, fas and ptpn <dig>  these genes are known to be involved in a wide range of adaptive immune processes. in humans, reducing the tgf-β signaling on t cells has been shown to increase the function of cd <dig> t cells in an indirect way which results in the rapid elimination of viruses, enabling the creation of an effective memory response  <cit> . similarly, human il- <dig> plays a key role in the survival of both naïve  <cit>  and memory  <cit>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> t cells. moreover, an in vitro study showed that inhibition of fkbp1b and other cyclophilins blocked the replication of different coronaviruses, including ibv  <cit> . in analogy, uninfected birds from the l10h line had a higher expression of il <dig>  fkbp1b, fas and ptpn <dig> 

generally the uninfected  birds from the two lines exhibit different expression profiles for this subset of innate and adaptive immune genes probably resulting from the divergent selection for the mbl serum concentration. selection in animal breeding have been shown to have an extensive effect on a variety of traits including immunological  <cit> . moreover, correlated response to selection has been observed in the case where selection was performed on less complex traits such as testosterone levels  <cit> . finally, different expression profiles for the subset of innate and adaptive immune in the uninfected birds from the two lines might be due to the balance in the effect of mbl serum levels. high levels of human mbl have been mostly reported as beneficial while in case of intracellular parasitic disease the effect of mbl serum level might be opposite  <cit> . the results indicate that selection for mbl serum levels might lead to favoring specific modes of immune responses depending on the mbl function.

large differences in the expression patterns were seen between the two lines following infection with ibv and these differences involved adaptive immunity-related pathways which are associated with “alpha-beta t cell activation” , and “activation of innate immune response”  . the observed enrichment for go terms related to t cell activation is in accordance with a previous study of these lines that showed that the ibv-specific t cells are present in large numbers in the spleen after ibv infection  <cit> . at week  <dig> post infection cxcr <dig>  fas and ptpn <dig> showed higher expression in line l10h. the cxc chemokine receptors are expressed on both effector and memory t cells and play a key role in the homeostasis of memory t cells  <cit> . fas has been shown to be upregulated in the kidney of chickens challenged with ibv  <cit> . the fas/fasl pathway is an important pathway of killing for cytotoxic t cells  <cit> . similarly, ptpn <dig> has been shown to be differentially expressed in chickens following pathogen challenge, and in particular following infection with escherichia coli  <cit> .

additionally vcam <dig> and jmjd <dig> were among the adaptive immunity-related genes de between lines at week  <dig> . the vcam <dig> gene is known to be involved in the activation of t cells  <cit> . furthermore, a recent study demonstrated that jmjd <dig> regulates proliferation of memory t cells during a viral infection  <cit>  which is of great interest considering that had higher expression in the ibv-infected birds from l10h line at week  <dig> 

the results show that the two lines differ greatly in the expression of adaptive immunity-related genes following infection, which may imply the presence of different modes of gene regulation. the sampling times were chosen to access responses both in the effector phase  and memory phase  of the adaptive immune response to ibv. in accordance, at 1 week, post infection subsets of genes actively involved in t cell proliferation show differences between the lines. also, at week  <dig> immune-related gene expression profiles in response to ibv infection that differ between the lines are more related to maintenance of t cell memory. mbl is known to be involved in regulation of dendritic cell maturation as well as cytokine production  <cit> . dendritic cells, which are the main antigen presenting cells and are actively involved in regulation of adaptive immune responses, possess the receptors for mbl in mammals  <cit> . therefore, the two lines selected for different mbl serum concentration may display differences in adaptive immune responses and development of adaptive immunity as a result of differences in response to cytokine signaling from dendritic cells. other studies of the two lines, l10l and l10h, have shown that they differ in disease response parameters after being challenged with different pathogens. the l10l line has been associated with increased viral replication in the airway after an infectious bronchitis virus  infection  <cit> , reduced growth rate after an escherichia coli infection  <cit>  and greater intestinal colonization after salmonella infantis infection  <cit> . in the present experiment, significantly lower viral loads  were observed in birds from line l10h in comparison to infected birds from line l10l  <cit> . furthermore, l10h birds in the present study exhibited a less severe damage of tracheal cilia following the ibv infection in comparison to the l10l line . in the current experiment phenotypic differences in additional traits connected to adaptive immunity were observed, including numbers of circulating b cells and cytotoxic t cells  <cit> . based on these observations it seems that selection for high mbl serum concentration allows birds to cope better after being infected with a range of pathogens. therefore, the observed differences in the expression profiles for the adaptive and innate immune-related genes are a reflection of differences in disease resistance and immune responses between the lines l10l and l10h.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, large differences in the spleen transcriptome between the two chicken lines, l10l and l10h, were observed in both uninfected  and ibv-infected birds. the uninfected birds from the two lines showed differences in expression profiles for a subset of both adaptive and innate immunity-related genes, which may represent differences in preparedness to respond to an infection. following infection with ibv, the two lines showed large differences in expression of genes involved in the adaptive cellular immune response such as t cell activation and proliferation pathways and hence their ability to respond to the infection, which is reflected in the difference in pathogen load seen between the two lines.
