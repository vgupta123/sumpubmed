BACKGROUND
chagas’ disease , caused by trypanosoma cruzi, affects approximately eight million individuals in latin america  <cit>  and is emerging in non-endemic areas due to the globalization of immigration and non-vector transmission routes  <cit> . the available therapy for cd is based on two nitroheterocycles, benznidazole  and nifurtimox, and was developed more than four decades ago. both nitroheterocycles are far from ideal due to substantial secondary side effects, limited efficacy against different parasite isolates, the need for long-term therapy and their well-known poor activity in the late chronic phase. these drawbacks justify the urgent need to identify better drugs to treat chagasic patients  <cit> .

naphthoquinones account for the largest number of natural naphthalenes, holding a number of different substituents with a variety of structural motifs. they act as vital links in the electron transport chains in metabolic pathways and participate in multiple biological oxidative processes  <cit> . quinone-containing plants have been used in diverse cultures as dyes, cosmetics, and food and, especially among indian populations, for the treatment of different diseases  <cit> . naphthoquinones are considered privileged structures in medicinal chemistry due to their structural properties and biological activities  <cit> , especially against tumor cells and pathogenic protozoa  <cit> . two major mechanisms of quinone cytotoxicity have been proposed: stimulation of oxidative stress and alkylation of cellular nucleophiles, which are the mechanisms of action common to a large range of biomolecules  <cit> .

among the simple hydroxylated naphthoquinones, juglone , isolated from walnut trees , has shown a variety of biological effects, including microbicidal  <cit> , anti-inflammatory  <cit>  and antitumoral  <cit>  effects that are associated with the induction of oxidative stress. as part of our continuing program of screening natural and synthetic quinones for trypanocidal activity, in the present work we investigated the activity and mode of action of naphthoquinones and specific juglone derivatives.

RESULTS
activity on bloodstream trypomastigotes
in the present work, we initially evaluated the efficacy of sixteen  <dig> -naphthoquinones  against the infective bloodstream trypomastigote forms of t. cruzi at 37°c in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium  plus 10% fetal calf serum  . the prototype,  <dig> -naphthoquinone , was compared with other derivatives that were substituted at c- <dig> with methyl , hydroxyl , acetoxy , and bromo  groups or that were disubstituted at c- <dig> and c- <dig>  such as  <dig> -dichoro- <dig> -naphthoquinone . in addition, juglone  and its derivatives, including those brominated at c- <dig>  or c- <dig>  and 2-methyl-5-hydroxy- <dig> -naphthoquinone , were also examined. fourteen compounds displayed an ic <dig> in the range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  μm, demonstrating higher activity than bz , and the other two tested compounds were less active: nq <dig>  and nq <dig>  .

athe bromo derivatives  are named based on the core juglone  system.

among the most active compounds on trypomastigotes at 37°c, four were selected for further studies: the prototype naphthoquinone  and three juglone derivatives  . interestingly, their activity against trypomastigotes was not decreased when the experiments were performed at 4°c in culture medium, but at this lower temperature in the presence of whole blood, ic <dig> values higher than 500 μm were obtained .

activity on the proliferative forms of t. cruzi and toxicity to mammalian cells
the selected compounds  were also assayed using the proliferative forms of t. cruzi: axenic epimastigotes and intracellular amastigotes. a dose-dependent effect on epimastigotes was observed, leading to the ic <dig> values for proliferation inhibition for  <dig> to 4 days of treatment displayed in table  <dig>  comparing the four nqs, the prototype unsubstituted quinone nq <dig> was the most active against epimastigotes.

the nqs were added to t. cruzi-infected primary cultures of both peritoneal macrophages and hmcs after the removal of non-interiorized parasites. for both host cells the inhibitory effect on the percent infection was in the range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  μm. surprisingly, nq <dig> and nq <dig> caused about a  <dig> -fold decrease of infection. for both host cells, the ic <dig> values after 48 h of treatment used to calculate the endocytic index are displayed in table  <dig>  nq <dig> was the most active compound. non-infected macrophages and hmcs treated with the compounds for 2 days were tested with the mtt assay to evaluate their toxicity to mammalian cells. for hmcs, the lc <dig> values were 8 μm for nq <dig> and nq <dig> and 10 μm for nq8; nq <dig> was the least toxic quinone with values higher than 10 μm. the lc <dig> was higher than 10 μm in macrophages for all four compounds.

athe ic <dig> was calculated for the endocytic index  after two days of treatment.

ultrastructural analysis
transmission electron microscopy showed that treatment with the nqs induced important alterations in the mitochondrion of the epimastigotes, leading to swelling and the appearance of membranous structures in the organelle matrix . autophagic features, such as atypical cytosolic membranous structures  and the appearance of endoplasmic reticulum surrounding reservosomes , were detected in treated parasites. the naphthoquinones also led to intense cytosolic vacuolization , the formation of blebs in the flagellar region  and the induction of loss of the electron-density of the cytosol  . the scanning electron microscopy technique demonstrated no important morphological alterations in treated epimastigotes .

flow cytometry analysis
this technique was employed to evaluate the mitochondrial membrane potential  dissipation by labeling epimastigotes with the specific marker tmre in the presence of 10 μm fccp. the four nqs, at ic <dig> levels, induced a significant decrease in the tmre fluorescence, denoted in table  <dig> by the reduction of the iv values  from − <dig>  to − <dig> . nq <dig> at the concentration of  <dig> μm presented the most remarkable reduction in the fluorescence intensity of the marker and totally disrupted the ΔΨm of about 20% of the parasites . on the other hand, treatment with nq <dig>  nq <dig> or nq <dig> induced no alteration in the percentage of tmre + epimastigotes, a finding that was quite similar to that observed in control parasites. ros production was assessed by dhe labeling and incubation with aa, a potent ros inducer. only treatment at the ic <dig> of nq <dig> led to a discrete increase in the percentage of dhe + parasites . the other three nqs yielded the same labeling pattern as the untreated cells at every dose tested.

discussion
initially, the sixteen derivatives were assayed against bloodstream forms of t. cruzi at 37°c . the activity of nq <dig> was surprising because this compound is the nonsubstituted  <dig> -naphthoquinone. the introduction of a hydroxyl at c <dig>  is detrimental to the trypanocidal activity, which is decreased 8× in comparison with the parent quinone. among the three simple juglone derivatives, the substitution of a hydroxyl by an acetoxy or methoxy group leads to higher biological activity. the o-methylated  and the o-acetylated  juglone derivatives were  <dig> × and 40×, respectively, more active than juglone  itself. among the 2- and 3-bromojuglone derivatives , regardless of the substituent, roughly the same efficacy was observed , with the exception of nq <dig>  which displayed trypanocidal activity similar to that of nonsubstituted nq <dig>  moreover, nq <dig> and nq <dig> are very similar and, in both cases, are slightly less effective than the parent methyl ether nq <dig>  this trend is also valid among the 5-hydroxy derivatives. thus, nq <dig> and nq <dig> had similar activity but showed 3-fold higher activity than juglone itself .

the effect of the juglone derivatives was previously investigated on aedes aegypti, the vector of dengue, and on adult biomphalaria glabrata snails  <cit> . concerning the larvicidal activity, nq <dig>  nq <dig> and nq <dig> were the most active, with ic <dig> values of about 4 μm. with respect to their molluscidal effects, nq <dig>  nq <dig>  nq <dig> and nq <dig> had ranges of activity between  <dig>  and  <dig>  μm. cytotoxic assays using four human cancer cell lines revealed that nq <dig> was the most active, with ic50/72 h values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μm, whereas for juglone , this range was from  <dig>  to over  <dig>  μm  <cit> . the mechanism underlying the cytotoxicity of nq <dig> to hl- <dig> cells involved the activation of caspases leading to an induction of apoptosis independent of mitochondria depolarization  <cit> .

leaving aside the juglone derivatives, and with the exceptions of nq <dig>  previously shown by us as inactive against t. cruzi in other experimental conditions  <cit> , and of nq <dig>  all the compounds displayed ic <dig> values in the range of  <dig>   to  <dig>   μm, corresponding to a higher activity in comparison with the standard drug benznidazole, which has an ic <dig> value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm. in a study with bolivian medicinal plants, fournet and colleagues  <cit>  reported the potent effect of nq <dig> , isolated from pera benensis, against t. cruzi and different species of leishmania.

the four compounds that were most active on bloodstream forms at 37°c were assayed also at 4°c: in the absence of blood, the lytic effect on trypomastigotes was not decreased, while in the presence of whole blood, ic <dig> values higher than 500 μm were obtained. these results are consistent with previous reports on the literature regarding the inactivation of the trypanocidal activity of quinones in the presence of blood components  <cit> . comparing the susceptibility of the different developmental forms of t. cruzi to the compounds, it was observed that bloodstream trypomastigotes were more susceptible to nq <dig>  whereas epimastigotes were more susceptible to nq <dig>  intracellular amastigotes from heart muscle cells or peritoneal macrophages were at least 2-fold more resistant to treatment with nq <dig>  nq <dig> and nq <dig> 

for the subsequent investigation of the mode of action of the four selected nqs, electron microscopy and flow cytometry assays with epimastigotes were employed, never exceeding the respective ic <dig> values. treatment with these compounds led to remarkable ultrastructural alterations, especially in the mitochondrion. the appearance of different morphological features suggestive of autophagic activity and the interference in flagellar membrane fluidity with bleb formation were also recurrent alterations.

mitochondrial susceptibility to treatment with naphthoquinones and its derivatives has been extensively reported  <cit> . mitochondria of trypanosomatids parasites exhibit unique structural and functional features that are remarkably distinct from mammalian counterparts. the absence of efficient mechanisms for ros detoxification in these parasites make the mitochondrion a good target for drug intervention  <cit> , and functional evaluation of the organelle by ΔΨm measurement represents an important step for the examination of the mechanism of action of novel drugs  <cit> . here, we assessed ΔΨm by tmre labeling in epimastigotes treated with nqs. we added fccp as a control. this ionophore works as an uncoupling agent that impairs atp synthesis by dissipating the hydrogen ion gradient and consequently stopping oxidative phosphorylation  <cit> . flow cytometry revealed a decrease in the mitochondrial potential after incubation with the four nqs at their ic <dig> values, and in the case of nq <dig>  even at a concentration 4-fold lower . another parameter analyzed was the percentage of tmre + parasites. we standardized the negative populations by the addition of 10 μm fccp, which totally dissipated the ΔΨm in epimastigotes . interestingly, a reduction of about 20% in the tmre + population was also observed in nq8-treated parasites at the ic <dig>  such a decrease indicates that this naphthoquinone induces the appearance of a sub-population of parasites with metabolically inactive mitochondria.

previous reports on the effects of several natural quinones, such as lapachol and β-lapachone, against t. cruzi have reported the involvement of free radicals in the trypanocidal activity  <cit> , making the reduction of nqs by parasitic flavoenzymes a promising strategy for the development of trypanocidal drugs  <cit> . mechanistically, it was reasonable to postulate that the collapse of the ΔΨm was mediated by ros generation in the treated parasites. in this context, the fluorescent probe dhe was used for intracellular ros detection, and aa was added as a positive control because it inhibits the electron flow through the electron transport chain, leading to the accumulation of superoxide  <cit> . among the four nqs tested, only nq <dig> led to a discrete increase in the percentage of dhe + epimastigotes, giving addition evidence for the strong effect of this quinone on the parasite ΔΨm. indeed, the pool of anti-oxidant defenses in epimastigotes that includes trypanothione, tryparedoxin peroxidase and other redox enzymes leads to a protective effect in this parasite stage, as previously described  <cit> . thus, one plausible hypothesis to explain the absence of oxidative stress triggered by nq <dig>  nq <dig> and nq <dig> could be the existence of more than one mechanism of action involved in the trypanocidal activity of these compounds, leaving ros generation suppressed by the detoxification system of the parasite. possibly, the strong redox effect of nq <dig> could be associated to the presence of the acetyl group in its structure facilitating quinone reduction, as previously demonstrated by electrochemical analysis  <cit> . further experiments using different biochemical and molecular approaches must be performed to better characterize ros participation in the mechanism of action of these compounds.

electron microscopy evidence of induction of the autophagic pathway by naphthoquinones and their derivatives has also been previously reported  <cit> . the presence of large profiles of endoplasmic reticulum surrounding different cellular structures, such as lipid droplets and organelles, and the appearance of bizarre membranous structures with a myelin-like aspect are the most common characteristics. the autophagic process represents a fundamental constitutive pathway in eukaryotic cells that is responsible for remodeling cellular structures and maintaining homeostasis. in trypanosomatids, other roles for autophagy have been proposed, including in the parasite’s differentiation  <cit> . in a great variety of cell models, the loss of the balance between anabolic and catabolic processes leads to non-apoptotic death  <cit> . in the last decade, it has been demonstrated that the induction of autophagy in t. cruzi trypanosomatids is triggered by several classes of drugs, in particular naphthoquinones and their derivatives  <cit> . our transmission electron microscopy analysis suggested the involvement of endoplasmic reticulum and cytosolic membranous structures in pre-autophagosomal formation, as previously postulated by yotimitsu & klionsky  <cit> .

another ultrastructural alteration observed after the treatment with nqs was the development of blebs in the flagellar membrane, which was also previously reported after treatment with naphthoquinone derivatives  <cit>  and is commonly associated with apoptosis-like death in different cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
although the autophagic phenotype was the most frequently observed ultrastructural alteration in treated epimastigotes and bleb formation was the unique characteristic of an apoptosis-like process, a hypothesis that there is interplay between the distinct death pathways through a cross-talk signaling mechanism could not be discarded. similar mechanisms have been demonstrated for other eukaryotic cells in the literature  <cit> . especially in t. cruzi, the processes of death regulation are poorly understood and deserve further studies aimed at the development of new therapeutic agents.
