BACKGROUND
microarray technology has become a powerful tool for many scientific and diagnostic applications. in cancer research the detection of genomic aberrations is crucial for associating copy number changes with cancer phenotypes or critical genes. for array comparative genomic hybridization , several methods and platforms have been developed . microarray copy number detection systems differ in their probe origin , production , gene density , hybridization , and labeling technique . laboratories are often required to evaluate the diverse microarray formats, considering different biological questions, experimental designs, material restrictions, and resolutions or data processing challenges. comparability and reproducibility of results have always been important issues. hence, it is important to evaluate microarray platforms not only based on their production characteristics but also using a variety of analytical and statistical methods. a comparative analysis of expression platforms has previously been performed for gene expression measurements  <cit> . however, to our knowledge this is one of the first publications validating different array cgh formats using tumors as material.

in this report, we compare three major dna microarray platforms: the agilent human genome cgh microarray  <dig> k, the roma/nimblegen representational oligonucleotide microarray  <dig> k, and the illumina human- <dig> genotyping  <dig> k beadchip. oligonucleotide probes used for the agilent array cover both coding and non-coding sequences, and most reporters are located in genes . oligonucleotides in the roma/nimblegen technology are based on bgl ii cutting sites, hence reporters are more or less randomly distributed across the entire genome providing a detailed picture of the structure and organization of the complete genome . the illumina platform on the other hand provides a dense, exon-centric view of the genome . the three platforms were tested with a set of  <dig> primary breast tumor samples. the samples are part of a larger cohort of stage i and ii primary tumors  <cit> , including several distinct expression subtypes expected to present with a number of common aberrations for human breast cancer  <cit> . results achieved were validated using different graphical and statistical methods, many performed with the cgh-explorer analysis tool  <cit> . one goal of our study was to investigate to what extent platforms of different nature and design perform differently in terms of detecting aberrant structures, regarding both size and amplitude of copy number changes. the results of the analysis were evaluated to investigate whether the number of probes, density distribution, probe localization, sensitivity and aberration calling method had any effect on the overall performance of the platform. overall, we found that all platforms included in this study give a similar general picture of the dna rearrangements in the tumors, including genomic instability profiles, although some details differ substantially.

RESULTS
whole genome analysis reveals overall similarity between platforms
the overall pattern is similar for all three platforms, as confirmed by the results displayed in figure  <dig>  here, the overall frequency of amplification and deletion events in the tumor samples was estimated for the three platforms using the pcf  algorithm . analysis of copy number changes using a method based on a different principle  showed the same overall pattern . all platforms detect the same previously described common aberrations  <cit> , like high frequency of amplification of chromosomal regions 1q, 8q, 17q and deletions at 16q and 17p . figure  <dig> illustrates that the platforms reveal similar results with respect to amplification peaks, though with some minor differences in amplitude height and/or number of events, amplification region size or pattern.

additional file  <dig> shows the degree of concordance between the platforms with respect to the classification of probes as amplifications, deletions or normal. the table is based on one particular selection of detection thresholds, the relative size of the thresholds reflecting the relative scale of the log ratios of the different platforms. in all platforms, the majority of probes are classified as being normal . probes that are called as amplified  on one platform are most often called likewise or as normal on the platform considered for comparison. opposite decisions, in the sense that one platform calls an event as amplification and the other platform calls a deletion, are very rare. hence, in terms of the direction of aberrations, the platforms are in large agreement with each other. nevertheless, there is a substantial proportion of probes that are called on one platform and not on another. note that the detection thresholds used here are not optimized with respect to the number of concordant classifications of probes.

instability indices, scoring the presence of localized regions of clustered, narrow amplification peaks on a chromosome arm, were determined  for each platform in each of the  <dig> tumor samples. in all platforms, very high instability indices for chromosome  <dig> to  <dig> were found for patient  <dig>  on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  and for patient  <dig>  on chromosome  <dig> . additionally, high instability indices were detected for patient  <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  on chromosome  <dig> for patient  <dig> and on chromosome  <dig> for patient  <dig> 

differences between the various platforms due to gene density or other factors
despite the general consistency of the platforms, specific variations in frequency and/or in aberration length are visible . most of these differences are due to variance in probe location or density. probe location is depending on design , which may be based on an automatic or manual strategy. reporters are not evenly spaced in any of the platforms, accounting for differences in genome structure and natural variance in gene density. the distribution of probes for the three different platforms is illustrated for the complete genome  and in a close-up for chromosome  <dig> . of all platforms, roma/nimblegen comes closest to a uniform probe distribution, while agilent shows high local variation of number of reporters, particular for areas in 1q, 3p, 6p, 11q centromeric, 12q centromeric,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the illumina platform shows high-density islands of reporters at 6p, 11p telomeric, 12q centromeric, 17p telomeric,19p, and 19q .

interestingly, platform specific small high frequency amplification or deletion peaks were found, as indicated by  in figure  <dig>  many were nearby the centromeric or telomeric regions. the agilent platform shows unique small high frequency aberrations of amplification at 3p and of deletions at 4p, twice at 5q, and 9q, and a larger amplification increase towards the telomere of 20q. roma/nimblegen exhibits unique small high frequency deletion at 14q and an amplification at 15q. increasing the aberration detection sensitivity, some extra platform dependent unique small high frequency amplifications or deletions are observed, e.g. at 14q for the illumina platform.

we suspect some of the observed unique differences in copy number aberration calling to be of biological importance. we therefore examined examples of these features  in more detail : at chromosome  <dig>  between position  <dig> – <dig>  mb in over 75% of all samples the agilent platform identifies a region with small amplifications . two strongly amplified reporters covering the genes cacna2d <dig>  and cish  cause the amplification detection in the agilent platform. the agilent platform further detects a larger unique region with amplifications for telomeric region 20q, between  <dig> – <dig>  mb . genes in this region  include ss18l <dig> , osbpl <dig>  and lamay <dig> , a gene of potential importance as it is found in the intrinsic gene list used for the classification of breast cancer subtypes  <cit> . further, a unique short deletion is detected in over 50% of all samples using the roma/nimblegen platform for the centromeric region of chromosome  <dig>  at  <dig> – <dig>  mb , covering a region of genes including ccnb1ip <dig> , apex <dig>  and tep <dig> . interestingly, an adjacent unique region detected solely by the illumina platform in chromosome  <dig> stretches from  <dig> – <dig>  mb . unique small amplification peaks exclusively detected by one of the platforms are likely to be due to differences in reporter density, as seen for the roma/nimblegen platform at chromosome  <dig>  between  <dig> – <dig>  mb . this centromeric peak is densely covered by  <dig> roma/nimblegen reporters: however, the agilent platform has a single reporter and illumina platform provides only  <dig> reporters for this area .

discussion
microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization allows the construction of high-resolution maps of genome-wide copy number alterations. array cgh enables localization of genomic aberrations in tumors, identification of critical genes, and classification of chromosomal changes  <cit> , indicating susceptibility or activation of tumor initiation and progression  <cit> . different arrays have been used for cgh-studies starting with cdna-, followed by bac-, and more recently by high density oligonucleotide-arrays  <cit> . only few comparisons of the various array cgh platforms have been performed and those we are aware of  <cit>  were based on other platforms and/or cell lines rather than on tumor data. for example, in  <cit>  the focus is primarily on reproducibility, signal-to-noise ratio and resolution differences.

we compared the agilent human genome cgh  <dig> k oligonucleotide microarray, the representational oligonucleotide microarray roma/nimblegen  <dig> k array, and the illumina snp-cgh human- <dig>  beadchip array platforms using human breast tumor samples. whole genome analysis of called copy number alterations reveals a great overall similarity and strong correlation between platforms. however, in concordance with  <cit>  we detected a notable difference in the scale of the log ratios between agilent and the two other platforms. in their cell line study with known relative copy number,  <cit>  found markedly higher signals for the agilent  <dig> k than for the high-resolution roma/nimblegen  <dig> k. numerically, the factors detected in their study correspond well to the factor of about  <dig>  found in our tls analysis of our tumor samples. agilent  <dig> k cgh arrays have a gene oriented arrangement being enriched particularly for cancer relevant genes with local high variation of number of reporters. the combination of these two features may be the reason for the high number of specific small high frequency amplification or deletion peaks particular in the agilent platform . the roma technology, invented at cold spring harbor laboratory and by nimblegen  <cit> , is based on representative oligonucleotide probes designed for fragments of the human genome sequence, which are more or less randomly distributed across the genome. the roma/nimblegen arrays provide a gene-independent arrangement of the structure of the complete genome at a high resolution. the bead-based human- <dig>  <dig> k arrays from illumina provide an exon-centric view of the genome through their  <dig> k snp markers, of which 70% are located in gene exons or within  <dig> kb of transcripts. this platform employs an allele-specific primer extension assay using two probes  in one color channel to score single-nucleotide polymorphisms   <cit> .

it is important to be able to distinguish between real copy number variation and variation related to the technical processing and analysis of the arrays. various programs, web-based tools and statistical software packages are available for exploring and analyzing array cgh data, e.g.  <cit> , with different accuracy for the estimation of aberrations callings  <cit> . a major advantage of the aberration calling method used here , as compared to many other aberration calling algorithms, is that its mathematical form makes it easy to adjust parameters to adapt to the specific platforms to obtain an appropriate comparison.

in comparing platforms, one should be aware that higher density of probes not necessarily implies an improved effective resolution. the effective resolution of a platform, defined as the smallest genomic range for which a reliable classification can be made with respect to aberration status , clearly depends on the platform's probe density and on the platform's snr . let d denote the absolute change in true intensity log-ratio corresponding to the smallest copy number alteration that we want to be able to detect, and suppose the observed intensity log-ratios are normally distributed around the true log-ratio with standard deviation sd. then, we may define snr = d/sd. to be able to detect the smallest alteration while controlling the type i and type ii error rates, the number of probes in the region must exceed a number that scales as the inverse square of snr. thus, the effect of doubling the signal-to-noise ratio is comparable to that of increasing the probe density by a factor of four. of course, an added effect of increasing the probe density, as opposed to improving the snr, is that local aberration details may be revealed that are partly or completely absent in lower resolution scans.

the content and performance characteristics of a particular platform influence its applicability for a certain study type. we conclude that for gene detection and gene-oriented research the agilent or the illumina platform are to be preferred. on the other hand, the roma/nimblegen approach, showing a compact picture of the entire genome structure, is the method of choice for exploration of the various mechanisms leading to different types of genomic instability such as chromosomal instability  or microsatellite instability . the illumina snp-cgh arrays can be utilized for detecting loh and allelic ratios in detecting aberrations. we are aware that several newer platforms with increased reporter numbers exist. however, the aim of this study was to assess to what extent platforms of different nature and design can result in differences in detection of some copy number aberration patterns.

in general, when comparing samples hybridized to different platforms the following steps should to be taken, supposing the data have been normalized according to the platform used: fit a regression model suitable for copy number data, such as pcf, to obtain estimated log ratios for a desired set of genomic loci. parameters  should reflect the probe density and noise level. if some samples have been hybridized to both  platforms, frequency plots  should be used to estimate the difference in scale. then perform aberration calling on the basis of the above fit, compensating for scale differences when estimates are available. finally, caution should be taken when comparing the small-scale structure of aberrations, since our analysis indicates that the similarities found by different platforms in the higher-level structure are not necessarily accompanied by correspondence in the detailed structure.

CONCLUSIONS
using  <dig> breast tumor samples and adjusted analytical methods, we observed high overall concordance between the three platforms evaluated, despite substantial differences in the platform composition. both correlation and cluster analysis indicate a somewhat higher similarity in results obtained by roma/nimblegen and illumina than between agilent and the other two platforms. some short amplifications or deletions of potential biological importance were revealed by only one of the platforms. detailed examination of these sites indicated that the discrepancy was mainly due to the density and spatial distribution of probes, and other platform specific features. further studies are needed to verify on the potential biological importance of the sites. the correct platform for a particular study is dependent on the research intention, whether it is gene, genome, or genotype oriented, and on region or location of interest. a complete genomic tiling array including high density gene oriented reporters may be the ultimate goal for the study of genomic alterations in cancer.
