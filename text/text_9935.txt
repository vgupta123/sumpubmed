BACKGROUND
the huntingtin-associated protein, hap <dig>  was first identified as a protein that interacts with huntingtin protein , the causative agent of huntington's disease   <cit> . hd is a member of a family of diseases in which expanded polyglutamine  repeat regions in an otherwise functionally diverse group of proteins results in neurodegenerative disorders  <cit> . this family includes dentatorubral-palidoluysian atrophy , caused by polyq expansion in atrophin 1;  <cit> , spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy , caused by polyq expansion in the androgen receptor, ar;  <cit> , and spinocerebellar ataxias 1– <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> , caused by polyq expansions in various proteins  <cit> .

in all of these diseases, expansion of gene sequences encoding the polyq region of the individual protein results in the disease in later life  <cit> . all are associated with neuronal accumulation of nuclear aggregates containing the affected protein as well as other proteins  <cit> . although some extranuclear protein aggregates can often also be found, the nuclear accumulations are implicated in inducing the cytopathic state that leads to apoptotic loss of neurons  <cit> . in the case of hd, expansion of the polyq repeat beyond ~ <dig> residues causes an amino-  terminal fragment  to be cleaved and to translocate to the nucleus, where it becomes incorporated into neuronal nuclear aggregates  <cit> . nuclear hd aggregates typically contain proteasome subunits, chaperones, and ubiquitin  <cit> . aggregates also contain transcription factors, including the tata-binding protein , cyclic amp response element-binding protein , specificity factor  <dig> , p <dig>  and others  <cit> . one of these, tbp, is a general transcription factor that functions in initiation by all three nuclear rna polymerases  <cit> . in addition, tbp is, itself, a polyq protein that, upon expansion of its polyq repeat, forms intranuclear aggregates leading to the sca <dig> neuropathology  <cit> . although tbp is generally a low abundance protein in normal somatic cells  <cit> , the nuclear aggregates in sca <dig> accumulate to high levels  <cit> , suggesting that the pathological state is associated with increased accumulation of nuclear tbp.

although hap <dig> interacts with htt, it is unclear what role this might play in hd. recent evidence suggests that hap <dig> may protect against polyq-expansion neuropathologies  <cit> , a proposal known as the 'hap <dig> protection hypothesis'  <cit> . thus, although expanded polyq htt is abundant throughout the brain, including in the hap1-expressing hypothalamic and limbic regions in hd patients  <cit> , these areas do not accumulate htt aggregates and do not exhibit hd pathology  <cit> . moreover, evidence for a neuroprotective role of hap <dig> in sbma has been reported. thus, hap <dig> binds to ar and sbma pathology is generally not seen in neurons expressing hap <dig>  <cit> . importantly, whereas transfection of hep- <dig> cells with polyq-expanded ar results in apoptosis, co-transfection of hap <dig> abrogates this effect  <cit> .

two hap <dig> isoforms have been characterized in mice, hap1-a, a  <dig> amino acid protein, and hap1-b, a  <dig> amino acid protein, which both arise from the same gene  <cit> . the difference between hap1-a and hap1-b stems from alternative splicing in the 3' region of the pre-mrna and results in both proteins containing different c-terminal sequences beyond the  <dig> amino acid hap <dig> common region  <cit> . it is not yet clear how hap1-a and hap1-b might differ functionally, although the predominant vesicle-associated subtype is hap1-b  <cit> .

subcellular localization studies show that hap <dig> is predominantly cytoplasmic  <cit> . hap <dig> is a component of stigmoid bodies   <cit> , which are non-membrane-bound cytoplasmic inclusions found in the hypothalamus and limbic regions of the brain  <cit> . hap <dig> expression induces formation of cytoplasmic inclusions resembling stbs, here termed stigmoid-like bodies , in  <dig> human embryonic kidney carcinoma cells, hep- <dig> human larynx carcinoma cells, and mouse neuronal nie  <dig> cells  <cit> , suggesting that hap1-a directs assembly of similar cytoplasmic inclusions in neuronal and non-neuronal cell types.

in the study presented here, unbiased yeast two-hybrid screens identified hap <dig> as a protein that binds to tbp. like the hap1-interacting htt and ar proteins, tbp is the causative agent of a polyq-expansion-dependent neuropathology . moreover, like for htt and ar proteins, we found that binding of hap <dig> to tbp occurred away from the tbp polyq region. instead, interaction domain mapping studies showed that hap <dig> binds specifically to the conserved c-terminal domain of tbp . by inducing formation of green fluorescent protein-tagged hap <dig> stlbs in  <dig>  cos- <dig>  or neuro-2a cells, we show that cytoplasmic stlbs sequester some tbp while still allowing accumulation of substantial levels of tbp in the nucleus. these data suggest hap <dig> can specifically associate with tbp to prevent nuclear localization of excess tbp while not impeding normal nuclear tbp accumulation and function.

RESULTS
identification of hap <dig> as a tbp interacting protein
to identify proteins that interacted with tbp, we screened a mixture of oligo-primed placental and whole pregnant uteri cdna libraries   or a random-primed library which also consisted of 50% placental and 50% whole pregnant mouse uteri cdnas . both screens were performed using tbp-fl as the bait protein, which was expressed from the pdbleu plasmid . in screen # <dig>  ~ <dig> ×  <dig> primary transformants  were plated onto sc-l-w-h-u. from these plates,  <dig> colonies grew and were transferred to fresh sc-l-w-h-u plates and those clones that re-grew were further tested for activation of the lacz reporter gene. seven of the clones grew on sc-l-w-h +  <dig> mm 3-at, sc-l-w-h +  <dig> mm 3-at, sc-l-w-h-u, and also activated the lacz reporter gene . inserts were sequenced to identify the interacting protein. three clones encoded partial cdnas of b'-related factor  <dig> , a known tbp interacting protein  <cit> . a fourth clone encoded a nearly full-length hap1-a protein, beginning at amino acid  <dig> . the remaining three clones encoded the following proteins: an unknown protein with similarity to human sr-rich proteins   <cit> ; an unknown protein product containing similarity to chromosome segregation atpases ; and rho-associated coiled-coil forming kinase  <dig> , a serine-threonine protein kinase.

in screen # <dig>  using the random-primed prey library, ~ <dig>  ×  <dig> primary transformants were plated and tested as in screen # <dig>  out of  <dig> colonies that grew on sc-l-w-h-u, five yeast clones activated all three reporter genes , did not grow in the presence of an empty bait plasmid , and thus appeared to express a tbp-interacting prey protein. one of these clones encoded amino acids 155– <dig> of the hap1-b  protein, with only the last five amino acids extending beyond the hap1-common domain and into the hap1-b-specific region. the other four clones were identical clones of cyclic amp-dependent protein kinase regulatory protein α   <cit> . the interaction of the random-primed hap <dig> clone with tbp-fl is shown in figure 2a, sector  <dig>  the hap1-tbp-fl interaction and control protein interaction pairs are shown in figure 2a, sectors  <dig> and 7– <dig>  respectively.

interaction of hap <dig> with tbp domains
to determine whether hap <dig> interacted with the conserved tbpcore or the vertebrate-specific tbp n terminus, yeast were co-transformed with either tbp-n or tbp-c bait plasmids and the hap1155– <dig> prey plasmid. growth of all clones on sc-l-w verified the presence of both the bait and prey plasmids . in the presence an empty prey plasmid, tbp-fl, tbp-c, and tbp-n did not grow under the protein interaction selection conditions . similarly, yeast that contained either the empty bait or empty prey plasmids  did not grow on plates that selected for interaction of bait and prey proteins . the hap1155– <dig> clone interacted with the tbpcore , but not with tbp n .

the interaction of hap <dig> with htt or ar has been shown to occur away from the polyq repeat region in each protein, but to be influenced by expansion of the polyq repeat  <cit> . in two-component two hybrid screens, we found a strong interaction of hap <dig> with either the tbpcore alone  or with full length tbp protein in which the polyq region had been replaced by two glycine residues . thus, the tbp polyq region showed no measurable contribution to the interaction of hap <dig> with tbp in the yeast two-hybrid system.

all attempts at further truncating the tbpcore region to define the interaction domain on tbp disrupted the tbp-hap <dig> interaction , suggesting that the interaction might be dependent on the structural integrity of the entire tbpcore region.

interaction of tbp with hap <dig> in co-transfected cells
in mammals, protein domains resembling the tbpcore region are found only in tbp and its two homologues  <cit> . similarly, the tbp-interacting domains in hap <dig> are not found in other proteins  <cit> . thus, the tbp-hap <dig> interaction appeared to be a specific interaction between unique polypeptide domains. for verification, the interactions between tbp and hap <dig> identified by two-hybrid screens were tested by co-immunoprecipitation in mammalian cell culture. differently epitope-tagged versions of full-length tbp and hap1155– <dig> were co-expressed in transiently transfected  <dig> cells. results indicated that hap <dig> co-precipitated with tbp when both proteins were co-expressed, but was not detected using a species-matched, nonspecific antibody . in a similar experiment, epitope-tagged hap1155– <dig> co-precipitated with a gfp-tbp fusion protein , again verifying the interaction between hap <dig> and tbp in mammalian cells.

mapping the tbp-interaction domain on hap1
to identify the domain of hap <dig> that interacted with tbp, we constructed truncated versions of hap <dig> in the pdbleu bait vector . each of the hap <dig> truncated clones was tested for interaction with tbp-c and tbp-n in the two-hybrid system . we found that all clones that began at amino acid  <dig> interacted with tbp-c , but not with tbp-n . the shortest n-terminal fragment of hap <dig> that interacted with tbp encoded amino acids 157– <dig>  which suggested that a tbp interacting region was between amino acids 157– <dig> of the hap <dig> protein. the linear sequence of amino acids within tbp interacting region  <dig> is shown in fig.  <dig>  in addition, the lack of interaction between tbp-c and hap1238– <dig>  suggested that this tbp interacting region on hap <dig> required amino acids 157– <dig> 

some hap <dig> clones that encoded amino acids outside tbp interacting region  <dig> also interacted with tbp-c  but not with tbp-n . the shortest c-terminal hap <dig> clone that interacted with tbp-c encoded amino acids 473– <dig>  which suggested that a second tbp interaction domain resided between amino acids 473– <dig> of hap <dig>  this region is represented as the tbp interacting region  <dig> in fig.  <dig>  the amino acid sequences of tbp interacting domains  <dig> and  <dig> show no obvious similarity , suggesting that these are each unique interacting domains rather than redundant versions of the same domain.

intracellular co-localization of tbp and hap1
the tbp-hap <dig> interaction was unexpected because, to our knowledge, following its synthesis in the cytoplasm, all tbp localizes to the nucleus  <cit> . conversely, hap <dig> is predominantly a cytoplasmic protein  <cit> . nevertheless, the appearance of hap <dig> in tbp-interaction screens using different libraries as well as the apparent specificity of interaction with the highly conserved tbpcore region  encouraged us to test whether we could detect colocalization of these two proteins in living cells. expression vectors encoding tbp or hap1-a fused to red or green fluorescent proteins, respectively, were constructed and transfected either individually  or in combination into cos- <dig>   <dig>  or neuro-2a cells . as negative controls, other nuclear proteins were fused to the red fluorescent protein and transfected either alone or in combination with gfp-hap <dig>  specifically, we chose three representative proteins: med <dig> , a component of the mediator  <cit> , which is closely associated with tbp and the basal transcription machinery; ptip  <cit> , a dna-binding transcription factor that associates with active chromatin; and u2af <dig> , a component of the splicing machinery  <cit> .

when either red fluorescently labeled tbp, med <dig>  ptip, or u2af <dig> were transfected alone, each of these proteins localized exclusively to the nucleus where each exhibited distinct heterogenous distributions . conversely, fluorescently labeled hap <dig> was exclusively cytoplasmic, where it assembled into stlbs  <cit>  . in cells expressing both tbp and hap <dig>  however, a portion of the tbp co-localized with hap <dig> in cytoplasmic stlbs . we did not detect any hap <dig> redistributing to the nucleus with tbp. co-expression of hap <dig> with either med <dig>  ptip, or u2af <dig> did not result in any redistribution of these non-tbp nuclear proteins into stlbs . these results suggest that tbp can be sequestered in cytoplasmic stlbs in vivo via specific interactions with hap <dig>  importantly, not all tbp was sequestered in stlbs . this suggests the association did not disrupt normal nuclear localization and function of tbp, but rather, was selective for only a subset of tbp in the cells.

hap1-a has been shown to have a strong propensity toward forming stlbs in mammalian cells, whereas hap1-b has been reported to have a more diffuse cytoplasmic expression pattern  <cit> . our interaction data showed that tbp interacts with hap <dig> in the region that is common to both hap <dig> isoforms . moreover, our two-hybrid screens isolated a nearly full-length clone of hap1-a from the oligo-primed library and a shorter clone from the random-primed library that extended five amino acids past the hap <dig> common region into hap1-b sequences. the nearly full-length hap1-a clone, when fused to the dsred <dig> fluorescent protein, formed strong stlbs and sequestered a fraction of co-expressed tbp protein in all mammalian cell types tested . interestingly, the short clone of hap1-b  also assembled into stlbs and sequestered tbp protein . in combination with previous studies  <cit> , these results suggest that the hap1-a-specific c-terminal domain is not necessary for stlb assembly, but rather, the hap1-b-specific c-terminus antagonizes stlb formation .

although our two-component two-hybrid tests showed that the tbp polyq region was not required for the tbp-hap <dig> interaction , the interaction of hap <dig> with other polyq proteins has been shown to be influenced by the length of polyq repeats outside of their hap1-binding domains  <cit> . the length of the polyq region in vertebrate tbp proteins has been shown to be highly variable both between and within species  <cit> ; polyq expansion beyond  <dig> residues in human tbp causes sca <dig>  <cit> . therefore, we wished to test whether, in the context of a mammalian cell, we could detect quantitative differences in the amount of tbp that assembled into stlbs by altering the length of the polyq repeat. mutant versions of mouse tbp expression vectors were constructed that either replaced the normal 13-residue polyq region with two glycines  or expanded the region nearly four-fold to contain  <dig> consecutive q residues . when expressed alone, all three versions of full-length tbp  were exclusively nuclear . when co-expressed with hap <dig>  all three full-length tbp proteins showed partial sequestration into cytoplasmic stlbs .

to quantify the proportion of tbp proteins assembling into stlbs, we co-transfected cells with gfp-hap and either dsred2-tbp-fl, dsred2-tbp-Δq, or dsred2-tbp-q <dig> and measured nuclear and extra-nuclear tbp fluorescence . results showed that, whereas both wild type tbp and tbp-q <dig> distributed similarly between the nucleus and cytoplasm, tbp-Δq exhibited significantly less association with cytoplasmic stlbs.

discussion
hap <dig> is a predominantly cytoplasmic protein that has been implicated in contributing to various processes  <cit> . since hap <dig> has little similarity with other known proteins  <cit> , much of what is known about its function has been discovered through identification of those proteins that interact with hap <dig>  specific protein interaction sites on hap <dig> have been mapped as follows : amino acids 277– <dig>  binds with htt; full-length hap1-a binds to ar; hap277– <dig> binds with dynactin p150glued; hap1245– <dig> binds with hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate protein; hap11– <dig> binds with interrho-gef kalirin-7; hap1219– <dig> binds to gabaa receptor; hap1272– <dig> binds to ip <dig> receptor; and hap1247– <dig> binds to neurod   <cit> . here we show that a clone encoding amino acids 155– <dig> of hap <dig> bound to the tbpcore domain in yeast two-hybrid screens . we also show that tbp co-immunoprecipitated with hap <dig> in transient cotransfection assays . further, two regions within hap <dig> were shown to independently interact with tbp-c. specifically, the domains of hap that interacted with tbp are found between amino acids 157– <dig> and between amino acids 473– <dig> .

we are aware of only one study that has shown a role of hap <dig> in transcriptional regulation. in that study, hap <dig>  in conjunction with htt, was shown to function as a scaffold protein that mediates the interaction of nd with mixed-lineage kinase  <dig> in the cytoplasm, resulting in phosphorylation of nd and its subsequent translocation to the nucleus  <cit> . no evidence exists for cytoplasmic regulation of tbp activity, so we feel that it is unlikely that the tbp-hap <dig> interaction might similarly regulate gene expression in hap1-expressing cells. rather, as detailed below, we favor a model based on the 'hap <dig> protection hypothesis'  <cit> , wherein hap <dig> may help protect neuronal cells from tbp-mediated cytotoxicity.

including this report, hap <dig> has now been shown to bind specifically to three proteins associated with polyq-dependent neuropathologies: htt, ar, and tbp  <cit> . in all cases, recognition and binding of these proteins by hap <dig> is dependent on unique sequences outside of their polyq regions  <cit> . in other words, hap <dig> does not recognize an expanded polyq repeat per se, but rather, recognizes unique aspects of at least three specific proteins that have a propensity for causing polyq-dependent neuropathology. neruopathologies caused by htt, ar, and tbp are associated with nuclear accumulation of protein aggregates, which are thought to induce cytopathic effects resulting in apoptotic neuron loss  <cit> . hap <dig> is not associated with htt aggregates in hd brains and hd neuropathology is not associated with brain regions having high hap <dig> expression  <cit> . thus, although htt is expressed in many regions of the brain  <cit> , regions that overlap with hap <dig> expression are not vulnerable to neuropathology, leading to formulation of the 'hap <dig> protection hypothesis'  <cit> . similarly, although both bulbar and forebrain neurons express high levels of ar, polyq-expanded ar aggregates and neuropathology in sbma patients are not observed in the forebrain regions, which express high levels of hap <dig> and exhibit stbs, but rather, are restricted to the hap1/stb-deficient bulbar regions  <cit> . overexpression of polyq-expanded ar in hep- <dig> cells induces apoptosis; however, co-overexpression of hap <dig> suppresses apoptosis and, instead, causes formation of stlbs containing both proteins  <cit> . thus, hap <dig> binds to polyq-expanded ar though specific interactions with regions outside the polyq domain, it sequesters polyq-expanded ar in stlbs, and it protects cells from polyq-expanded ar-induced apoptosis  <cit> , strongly supporting a protective role for hap <dig> 

although it is not clear whether hap <dig> might also protect neurons from tbp-mediated neuropathology, it is intriguing that, despite ubiquitous expression of tbp in all cells of the body, most regions of the brain exhibiting high levels of hap <dig> and abundant stbs do not exhibit neuropathology in sca <dig> patients  <cit> . one exception is in the striatum, which has both stbs  <cit>  and sca17-associated neuropathology  <cit> . however, detailed analyses show that, whereas hap1/stbs are found in the medium and large neurons of the striatum  <cit> , sca <dig> is associated with loss of the small neurons  <cit> .

in the current study, we show that hap <dig> binds specifically to the tbpcore and that hap <dig> can sequester a subset of tbp into stlbs in co-transfected  <dig>  cos- <dig>  or neuro-2a cells. unlike the case for hap binding to ar , the hap1-tbp interaction in yeast or mammalian cells did not require expansion of the polyq region of tbp ; however, removal of the polyq region reduced assembly of tbp into stlbs . since the hap1-binding domains of tbp, htt, and ar are all disparate from the polyq regions in each protein , it is interesting that hap <dig> binding by all three proteins should show polyq-dependence. in transfected cells, hap1/stlbs did not clear tbp from the nucleus . instead, they appeared to sequester a subset of tbp, while still allowing substantial tbp accumulation in the nucleus. it remains unclear whether the tbp protein that accumulated in the nucleus was equivalent to that sequestered in the stlbs . one possibility is that the polyq region of each protein can influence the likelihood that that protein assumes a "state" that allows interaction with hap <dig>  for example, in the case of tbp, the subset of protein that is sequestered into hap <dig> stlbs might be mis-folded, defective in nuclear localization, abnormally associated with other proteins, or otherwise defective, thus making this protein accessible for hap <dig> binding. further studies will be required to better understand the role of the tbp polyq region in in vivo hap <dig> association.

CONCLUSIONS
hap <dig> has previously been shown to interact specifically and away from the polyq repeat region with htt and ar proteins, the causative agents of hd and sbma, respectively  <cit> . in the current study, we isolated hap <dig> as a tbpcore-interacting protein from unbiased two-hybrid screens. the interacting domains were mapped and the interactions were confirmed in co-immunoprecipitation assays. sub-cellular co-localization studies indicated that hap1-induced stlbs could sequester a subset of overexpressed tbp, but not other overexpressed nuclear proteins, away from the nucleus. although the co-localization was modeled in an overexpression system, we suspect this may be a suitable model for a hap1-tbp interaction. thus, in normal cells, all tbp goes to the nucleus where it functions in transcription initiation and a hap1-tbp interaction would not occur. only in the case of a tbp expression anomaly would there be a possible physiological situation in which a hap1-tbp interaction may be important to combat tbp-mediated cytotoxicity. in our co-localization system, the anomaly is strong overexpression of tbp in the transiently co-transfected cells; in sca <dig> patients, anomalous expansion of the tbp polyq repeat results in overaccumulation tbp, which assembles into nuclear aggregates and results in apoptotic neuronal loss  <cit> . interestingly, neurons expressing hap <dig> and possessing stbs appear to be refractory to nuclear aggregate formation and sca <dig> cytopathology . thus, we posit that hap <dig> plays a neuroprotective role in preventing nuclear aggregate formation in the presence of anomalous tbp accumulation.
