BACKGROUND
long interspersed element-1s  are non-ltr  retrotransposons accounting for ~17% of human dna  <cit> . though most l <dig> copies are functionally inactive, there are ~80- <dig> retrotransposition-competent l1s in human genome  <cit> . l1s have greatly shaped the human genome by their own retrotransposition and mobilization of non-autonomous elements  in trans  <cit> . a full-length l <dig> element is about  <dig> kb in length and contains a 5' untranslated region , two non-overlapping open reading frames , followed by a short 3' utr that ends in a poly adenosine tail  <cit> . the product of orf <dig> encodes a  <dig> kda protein  with nucleic acid binding and chaperone activities  <cit> . orf <dig> encodes a ~ <dig> kda multifunctional protein  with endonuclease   <cit> , reverse transcriptase  activities  <cit>  and a cysteine-rich domain of unknown function  <cit> . the life cycle of l <dig> begins with the transcription of the l <dig> mrna, which is exported to the cytoplasm for translation. l <dig> proteins have a strong cis-preference and are proposed to specifically associate with their encoding mrnas to form an rnp particle that re-enters the nucleus and integrates into the genome  <cit> . several lines of evidence suggest that l <dig> transposes via a mechanism known as target primed reverse transcription   <cit> , in which reverse transcription of l <dig> rna is the crucial step. results from a cell-based retrotransposition assay indicate that l <dig> retrotransposition depends on active rt function  <cit> . full-length human orf <dig> protein expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells has strong rna-dependent and dna-dependent dna polymerase activities  <cit> . until now, active l <dig> rt or orf2p had not been successfully expressed in prokaryotic hosts such as e. coli.

it is known that reverse transcriptases are susceptible to rt inhibitors classified into three types: nucleoside analog inhibitors , nucleotide analog inhibitors , and non-nucleoside inhibitors . the first two groups of inhibitors are structural analogs of natural deoxynucleotides and, upon phosphorylation to the triphosphate form in the cell, compete with dntps for access to the active site of reverse transcriptase. since all analog inhibitors lack a 3'-hydroxyl group, they act as dna chain terminators and generally have a broad spectrum of inhibitory activity  <cit> . the nnrtis, on the other hand, are structurally diverse hydrophobic chemicals that function in a distinct manner. instead of being incorporated into the nascent dna strand, they specifically bind to a "nnrti pocket" motif formed by the hiv- <dig> rt p <dig> subunit  <cit> . binding of nnrtis to this motif distorts the nearby hiv- <dig> rt catalytic site and thus blocks dna synthesis. all nnrtis specifically inhibit hiv- <dig> rt activity non-competitively without themselves being structurally modified in the cell.

recent publications have indicated that two nnrtis  effectively reduce cell proliferation and promote cell differentiation by inhibiting endogenous rt activity  <cit> . they were also found to inhibit the growth of human tumors in animal models. to explain these phenomena, it was hypothesized that endogenous rts might be involved in a mechanism controlling cell proliferation and differentiation. as the most abundant source of endogenous rts, l <dig> was assumed to be the major target of these rt inhibitors  <cit> . separately, previous studies have indicated that nucleoside analog rt inhibitors  could suppress l <dig> retrotransposition activity in a tissue culture assay  <cit> .

to directly characterize the susceptibility of l <dig> rt to various rt inhibitors, we overexpressed and purified recombinant human l <dig> reverse transcriptase in e. coli. then we tested the effect of nrtis and nnrtis on l <dig> rt directly by a cell-free rt assay. the ki values of four nrtis against l <dig> rt were determined. we also investigated the effect of these drugs on l <dig> retrotransposition frequency using a cell-based retrotransposition assay. the data from both cell free and tissue culture experiments demonstrated correlated results: all nrtis inhibited l <dig> rt activity and retrotransposition efficiency, whereas nevirapine had no significant effect on l <dig> rt in either type of assay.

RESULTS
protein expression and in vitro rt activity
human l <dig> orf <dig> encodes  <dig> amino acids and contains three functional domains. among them, the structure of en domain  has been determined  <cit> . the rt domain spans ~1/ <dig>  of the orf <dig> sequence and the cysteine-rich domain starts at amino acid ~ <dig> . we cloned the rt domain from a synthetic human l <dig> element - orfeus-hs  <cit> , which encodes the same amino acid sequence as native l1rp, with the linker regions extended to the boundaries of the en and c domains  into pmal-c2x vector  and expressed l <dig> rt as a fusion protein with an mbp tag located at the n-terminus. the protein had the expected size of ~ <dig> kda on sds-page . strong rt activity was detected in both the crude cell lysate and purified protein by homo-polymer rt assays. meanwhile, a control lysate prepared from cells transformed with empty pmal-c2x vector and purified mbp-orf <dig> protein did not show any rt activity, indicating that the rt activity was l <dig> rt-derived rather than from host cell components or the mbp tag. one unit of rt activity was defined as the amount of enzyme necessary to catalyze incorporation of  <dig> nmol dttp into poly -oligo 12- <dig> in  <dig> min at 37°c. the specific activity of purified l <dig> rt was calculated as  <dig>  unit per μg protein -oligo 12- <dig> primer/template) and  <dig>  unit per μg protein -oligo 12- <dig> primer/template).

effect of rt inhibitors on activities of different reverse transcriptases
we tested the effect of four nrtis and three nnrtis on hiv- <dig>  l <dig> and ty <dig> reverse transcriptase activities. as shown in figure 2a, b, c and 2d, all four triphosphate nrtis markedly inhibited the activities of hiv- <dig> and l <dig> rts at nm concentrations. conversely, nrtis inhibited ty <dig> rt activity at the μm level, if at all. we also found that ty <dig> rt was more sensitive to the thymine analogs than to cytidine analogs. interestingly, inhibitors azttp, ddctp and 3tctp modestly but significantly increased ty <dig> rt activity  at low concentrations.

nnrtis were previously reported to inhibit hiv- <dig> rt activity with different potencies   <cit>  and we observed similar degrees of inhibitory effects on hiv- <dig> rt here . in contrast, l <dig> and ty <dig> rts were inhibited only in the presence of high concentrations of dlv  and efv . nvp showed no inhibition at concentrations as high as  <dig> μm. amino acids k <dig>  v <dig>  y <dig>  y <dig> and g <dig> in the hiv- <dig> rt p <dig> subunit are believed to be important for binding nnrtis  <cit> . we aligned the sequences of hiv- <dig>  hiv- <dig>  l <dig> and ty <dig> rts  and found the sequences of hiv- <dig>  l <dig> and ty <dig> rts at above positions were all different from hiv- <dig> rt, suggesting that the "nnrti pocket" is absent from these rts.

kinetics of inhibition of l <dig> rt by nrtis
having determined that all nrtis inhibited l <dig> rt activity, we next studied the kinetics of inhibition of l <dig> rt by these nrtis. poly -oligo 12- <dig> and -dttp were used as template/primers and substrate to assay thymine analogs . poly -oligo 12- <dig> and -dctp were used to assay cytidine analogs . the rt assays were repeated with the same amount of template/primer in the presence of different amount of substrates and inhibitors. the results were analyzed by double-reciprocal  plots. as expected, inhibition of l <dig> rt with respect to both dttp and dctp substrates showed classic competitive behavior with no significant change of the vmax . the km value for dttp was  <dig>  μm and the apparent km values in the presence of  <dig> nm,  <dig> nm,  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm azttp were  <dig>  μm,  <dig>  μm,  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  μm respectively. the ki value for azttp against l <dig> rt was calculated as  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm . the apparent km values in the presence of  <dig>  nm,  <dig>  nm,  <dig>  nm and  <dig> nm d4ttp were  <dig>  μm,  <dig>  μm,  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  μm and the ki value for d4ttp was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm. of the cytosine analogs, the km value for dctp substrate was  <dig>  μm and the apparent km values in the presence of  <dig>  nm,  <dig> nm,  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm ddctp were  <dig>  μm,  <dig>  μm,  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  μm. the apparent km values in the presence of  <dig> nm,  <dig> nm,  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm 3tctp were  <dig>  μm,  <dig>  μm,  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  μm. the ki values calculated for ddctp and 3tctp were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm respectively . since all nrtis are competitive inhibitors against l <dig> rt with respect to their corresponding natural dntps, the ic <dig> value can be calculated as ic <dig> = ki/. the ic <dig> values of azttp, d4ttp, ddctp and 3tctp were calculated as  <dig>  nm,  <dig>  nm,  <dig>  nm and  <dig>  nm.

effect of rt inhibitors on l <dig> retrotransposition
to further evaluate the effect of rt inhibitors on l <dig> in vivo, we tested l <dig> retrotransposition in the presence of these chemicals using an established tissue culture retrotransposition assay. all transposition assays were performed using orfeus-hs that encodes wild type orf <dig> and orf <dig> proteins but transposes at a 2~ <dig> fold higher frequency  than the corresponding native human l <dig>  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  the rt inhibitors had diverse effects on human l <dig> retrotransposition. all seven nrtis decreased l <dig> retrotransposition with various potencies. azt and d4t reduced l <dig> retrotransposition efficiency to similar levels when  <dig> μm inhibitors were added to the medium, but d4t had a stronger effect at higher concentrations  . the inhibitors 3tc, ddc, and ddi strongly reduced l <dig> retrotransposition at a low concentration  and the last two completely abolished l1's transposition ability. the only ntrti we tested, bis-pom pmpa, also reduced the retrotransposition rate to almost zero at  <dig> μm. nnrtis dlv and efv inhibited l <dig> retrotransposition efficiency by ~72% at concentrations of  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm respectively. but nevirapine only decreased l <dig> transposition frequency by ~10% at all tested concentrations . retrotransposition assays at higher concentrations of dlv and efv could not be carried out due to high levels of seemingly nonspecific cell death caused by these drugs.

discussion
biochemical dissection of the l <dig> retrotransposition mechanism necessitates in vitro expression of l <dig> encoded orfs. thus far, only the function of the en domain of orf <dig> has been clearly demonstrated in vitro  <cit> , leaving the rt and cysteine-rich domains less well understood. full-length l <dig> orf <dig> protein was previously expressed in eukaryotic hosts such as yeast and insect cells with relatively low yield and purity  <cit> . we describe a fragment of the l <dig> rt expressed in bacterial cells as a highly active polymerase fusion protein. ability to detect robust activity suggests that post-translational modification by eukaryotic host is not critical to l <dig> rt activity. given the efficiency and simplicity of e. coli expression system, this will allow extensive follow-up biochemical studies of the l <dig> retrotransposition mechanism. recombinant l <dig> rt expressed in e. coli displayed strong reverse transcriptase activity with both homopolyer substrates tested though higher activity was observed with poly -oligo 12- <dig> as previously seen with l <dig> orf2p from insect cells  <cit> . furthermore, the specific activity of l <dig> rt is essentially the same as that of full-length orf2p expressed in insect cells  <cit>  although the bacterially expressed fusion protein studied here lacks the en and cysteine-rich domains. interestingly, l <dig> orf2p expressed in yeast lost 84% rt activity when amino acids 1- <dig> were deleted and 50% of activity when amino acids 952- <dig> were removed  <cit> , suggesting the importance of these two regions to its rt activity. similar requirement was reported for recombinant ty <dig> rt, which required c-terminal residues of integrase for its rt activity  <cit> . it should be noted that the previously reported l <dig> orf2p  rt activity was measured in the context of a cell-free lysate and at an extremely low level. our findings obtained from highly active and purified protein indicate that en and cysteine-rich domains are dispensable for rt function although we cannot exclude the possibility that the n-terminal mbp tag may act as a substitute for one of the two domains, helping the rt fold into active conformation. indeed, we were not successful at retaining rt activity following proteolytic removal of the mbp tag, consistent with its importance in solubility and/or activity of the protein.

expression of the highly active l <dig> rt allows in vitro biochemical comparisons of reverse transcriptases from phylogenetically related non-ltr retrotransposons and ltr-retrotransposons. direct comparison under the same assay condition revealed that l <dig> and hiv- <dig> rts are distinct from one another and have distinct interaction patterns with rt inhibitors. both rts were markedly inhibited by nrtis and displayed similar susceptibilities to d4ttp and 3tctp. compared to hiv- <dig> rt, l <dig> rt was less sensitive to azttp but more sensitive to ddctp. obvious differences were observed for nnrtis that inhibited hiv- <dig> rt activity, as expected  <cit>  but had little effect on l <dig> rt. it is notable that the recombinant ty <dig> rt was less susceptible to all rt inhibitors tested in this study. the recombinant ty <dig> rt used here is essentially the same as that used in a previous publication  <cit>  but its specific activity with poly -oligo 12- <dig> and poly -oligo 12- <dig> template/primer is several times higher than that using poly -oligo 12- <dig>   <cit> . previous studies have indicated that the guanosine analog ddgtp decreases ty <dig> rt activity by 90% when the ratio of ddgtp/gtp reaches  <dig>   <cit> . in this work ty <dig> rt activity was inhibited only when the concentrations of inhibitors were several thousand times higher than the native substrate. it is known that reverse transcriptases react differently to inhibitors using different types of template/primer. perhaps the resistance of ty <dig> rt to inhibitors is due to the different effects of template/oligo mixes, while it is also possible that adenosine and cytidine analogs are not recognized efficiently by recombinant ty <dig> rt.

the rt inhibitor azt was reported to suppress l <dig> retrotransposition in the cell-based retrotranspostion assay  <cit> . in this study we have illustrated the effect of eleven different rt inhibitors on l <dig> retrotransposition frequency, which is correlated with data obtained from in vitro rt assay. for example, azt with a higher ki inhibited the l <dig> retrotransposition less proficiently than d4t with a lower ki value, and the same pattern was observed for cytidine analogs. both thymine analogs are relatively weak inhibitors of l <dig> retrotransposition compared to hiv- <dig>  whose production is completely inhibited by 1- <dig> μm azt  <cit> . cytidine analogs  and ddi, on the other hand, have strong inhibitory effects comparable to those on hiv. this significant difference may be caused by the metabolism of these inhibitors in vivo since the triphosphate form of 3tc and ddc were found to be ten times of that of azt in the cell  <cit> . we have also tested these rt inhibitors on the retrotransposition of a highly active synthetic mouse l <dig>   <cit> . the obtained results show the same inhibition profile observed with orfeus-hs: all nrtis inhibit l <dig> retrotransposition, yet nvp doesn't inhibit orfeus-mm retrotransposition profoundly, even at high concentrations . though synthetic line- <dig> elements  were used in this study, they all encode the same amino acid sequences as wild-type l1s and their retrotransposition is fully dependent on rt function.

d transposition efficiency could not be detected due to excessive cell death

phylogenetic evidence also suggests that non-analog inhibitors are specific to hiv- <dig> rt and ineffective against other polymerases. sequence alignment of hiv- <dig> p <dig>  hiv- <dig>  l <dig> and ty <dig> rts indicates the positions important for nnrti binding are highly variable. these substitutions change not only the conformation but also the electronic charge of the nnrti binding motif, such as the replacement of lysine  by phenylalanine  by l <dig> at position  <dig>  it is known that hiv- <dig> is resistant to nnrtis because of the destruction of "nnrti pocket" motif  <cit> . various studies have indicated that substitutions at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are the most common hiv- <dig> mutants that reduce nvp susceptibility more than  <dig> fold  <cit> . in addition, nvp and efv are inactive against a variety of polymerases including amv rt, mlv rt, human dna polymerases α, β, γ and klenow fragment  <cit> . hiv- <dig> mutants resistant to efv normally have substitutions at positions  <dig> and  <dig> suggesting efv may contact a smaller surface of the rt  <cit> . this may explain our observation that efv still inhibits l <dig> rt activity but with lower effectiveness. taken together, our results above suggest that nevirapine is specific to hiv- <dig> rt and does not inhibit l <dig> rt activity both in vitro and in vivo. given this, we conclude that the reported anti-tumor function of nvp and efv is due to another mechanism distinct from inhibition of endogenous l <dig> rt activity. an alternative anti-tumor mechanism may result from the cytotoxicity of rt inhibitors since efv and dlv were found to cause massive hela cell death at concentrations of  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm respectively.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we report the expression and purification of recombinant human l <dig> rt in bacterial host cells for the first time. the protein has the same reverse transcriptase activity as the full-length orf <dig> expressed from insect cells suggesting no host specific modifications are required for rt activity. we have tested the effect of different rt inhibitors against l <dig> rt activity and retrotransposition by in vitro  and in vivo  analyses. the data presented here indicated that l <dig> rt is sensitive to nrtis but nnrtis inhibit l <dig> rt less efficiently. nevirapine, an rt inhibitor with reported anti-tumor function, has no effect on l <dig> rt activity.
