BACKGROUND
the generation of myelin during development or repair in the peripheral and central nervous systems involves complex signaling between the neuron and the surrounding glial cells  <cit> . although the correlation between axon caliber and the elaboration of myelin has been established  <cit> , recent studies have started to elucidate the molecular cues that are involved in regulation of myelin formation  <cit> . axonal neuregulin- <dig>  signaling stimulates either glial proliferation  <cit>  or induces the differentiation of nonmyelinating schwann cells and oligodendrocytes resulting in myelination depending on localization and amount of nrg- <dig>  <cit> . the explanation of these opposing activities may relate to the downstream signaling pathways activated by nrg- <dig>  for example, activation of pi3k downstream of nrg-1/erbb receptor signaling is required for myelination  <cit> . alternatively, mapk activation can also occur following erbb phosphorylation resulting in inhibition of myelination  <cit> . the details of the intracellular signaling controlling this balance between proliferation and differentiation are still being elucidated but have been suggested to involve nrg- <dig> isoform expression, type i, ii, or iii  <cit>  and proteolysis  <cit> . nrg- <dig> is cleaved in distinct regions by the β-secretase bace- <dig> or by metalloproteinase activity  <cit> . for example, nrg- <dig> type iii contains a membrane bound region both c-terminal and n-terminal to the egf domain. bace- <dig> cleaves c-terminal to the egf domain of nrg- <dig> type iii allowing access to erbb  <dig> receptors while mmp activity cleavage occurs n-terminal to the egf domain. cleavage at both sites leads to the generation of a soluble egf domain  <cit> . taveggia et. al.  <cit>  have shown that increased levels of membrane bound nrg- <dig> lead to myelination while the proteolytically processed soluble form is proliferative in the pns . recently, a role for nrg- <dig> type iii in the promotion of oligodendrocyte mediated myelination has also been shown  <cit> . mmp activity is known to be important for the proper development of multiple aspects of the neural microenvironment  <cit> . data from our laboratory suggests that during development, mmp- <dig> expression is predominantly neural and peaks in the mouse at embryonic day  <dig>  in addition, protein expression is inversely correlated with the expression of myelin-associated glycoprotein  during nerve regeneration  <cit> . given the temporally regulated pattern of expression of mmp- <dig> prior to myelination in both developmental and regenerative states, it is likely that mmp- <dig> plays a functional role in the maturation of nerves. as mmp- <dig> downregulation precedes myelination and mmp activity is known to regulate molecules related to this process , it is possible that mmp- <dig> negatively regulates the formation of myelin. this led us to hypothesize that inhibition of mmp- <dig> activity will result in increased or earlier myelination. here we show that polyclonal antibodies that recognize two distinct regions of mmp- <dig> bind recombinant mmp- <dig> and specifically inhibit its proteolytic activity. in rat primary drg co-cultures of neurons and glial cells, an in vitro model of myelination, these antibodies enhance the expression of axon associated mag, suggesting a beneficial role of inhibiting mmp- <dig> during early myelination. additionally, mmp- <dig> treatment enhances mapk phosphorylation, induces rapid phosphorylation of erbb <dig> and erbb <dig>  and reduces phosphorylation of pi3k in myelinating rat drg co-cultures, changes likely to be inhibitory to the development of myelin. finally, we demonstrate for the first time that mmp- <dig> protein levels can be found at increased levels in both mouse experimental autoimmune encephalitis  spinal cord and in human cerebellar multiple sclerosis lesions. together, these results suggest that mmp- <dig> may be a suppressor of myelination and that inhibition of mmp- <dig> may be beneficial in promotion of myelin repair.

RESULTS
mmp- <dig> added to drg co-cultures reduces development of myelin
previous data from our laboratory suggested that down-regulation of mmp- <dig> expression in the neuron was permissive for the development of myelin  <cit>  but it is unclear if aberrant mmp- <dig> expression would effect myelin elaboration. to ascertain if mmp- <dig> directly inhibits myelination, drg co-cultures were established and induced to myelinate by the addition of ascorbic acid. using this system, myelination of axons by schwann cells can be induced  <cit> . to verify that our cultures represent pns cells, s- <dig>  neurofilament, and claudin- <dig> and o <dig> staining was carried out on  <dig> day myelinated drg-derived cells to identify schwann cells, neurons, and oligodendrocytes respectively .  <dig> ± 8% of all cells were identified as schwann cells by expression of s- <dig>  less than 1% of the total cells were identified as neurons by neurofilament staining while o <dig> and claudin- <dig> positive cells were not detected. it remains possible that a small percentage of cells in these cultures are oligodendrocytes however based on morphology and staining, the cultures represent pns myelination. mmp- <dig> was included in the media at concentrations of  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> nm on day  <dig> and day three following the induction of myelination. mmp- <dig> treatment during the early stages of myelination resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of axon associated myelin associated glycoprotein , a marker of myelination, significantly reducing myelin at the  <dig> nm concentration .

polyclonal anti-mmp- <dig> antibodies bind mmp-28
peptides from regions n- and c-terminal to the active site of human mmp- <dig> were used to immunize rabbits for the generation of the polyclonal anti-mmp- <dig> antibodies ab  <dig> and pab  <dig>  antisera were purified by peptide affinity chromatography followed by protein g purification. one of the peptides was found to have the closest amino-acid homology to mmp- <dig>  while no homology was found in the other peptide to any mmps or other proteins. in binding and activity assays, mmp- <dig> was used as an mmp containing a related protein sequence and mmp- <dig> was used as a non-related mmp. to determine antibody specificity,  <dig> ng of purified human mmp- <dig>  mmp- <dig>  and mmp- <dig> were loaded on nitrocellulose membranes by sdspage followed by western blotting. both antibodies pab <dig> and pab <dig> were found to recognize the mature form of human mmp- <dig>  in samples of purified human mmp- <dig> protein but did not recognize mmp- <dig> , or mmp- <dig>  . the  <dig> kda pro-form of mmp- <dig> in the purified protein sample was detectable upon over exposure . the polyclonal antibodies were also found to cross react with rat mmp- <dig> as determined by western blot analysis of protein extracts of myelinating rat drg samples. the  <dig> kda pro-form of the protein was detectable in the d <dig> myelinating rat drg extracts. the mature form was not detected in these samples, however,  <dig> day myelinating cultures express low levels of mmp- <dig>  <cit>  compared to cultures earlier in the myelination program and the cleaved form may not be generated in these cells at this later time point. bands corresponding to the pro- and mature form of rat mmp- <dig> were detected by western blot of freshly isolated e <dig> drgs  suggesting that active mmp- <dig> is present during the early timepoints of the development of myelin in this drg model of myelination.

pab <dig> and pab <dig> inhibit mmp- <dig> proteolysis
to determine if the anti-mmp <dig> polyclonal antibodies inhibit mmp- <dig> activity,  <dig> nm mmp- <dig> was pre-incubated with pab <dig> or pab <dig> at varying concentrations for one hour at 37°c and then assessed for proteolytic activity after  <dig> hours against an artificial fluorescent pan-mmp substrate. both antibodies were found to significantly inhibit the activity of mmp- <dig> at  <dig> : <dig> and 3: <dig> molar ratio of antibody to mmp <dig> . pab <dig> inhibited mmp- <dig> by  <dig> %* at  <dig> nm and  <dig> %** at  <dig> nm while pab <dig> inhibited mmp- <dig> by  <dig> %* at  <dig> nm and  <dig> %* at  <dig> nm . when measured through  <dig> hours, enzymatic activity of  <dig> nm mmp- <dig> was inhibited in a dose dependent manner by pab <dig> or pab <dig> while the activity of human mmp- <dig>  or mmp- <dig>  was not inhibited by the addition of  <dig> or  <dig> nm pab <dig> or pab <dig>  . no inhibition was detected in mmp- <dig> or mmp- <dig> activity following  <dig> hours under any of the conditions evaluated . these data demonstrate that pab <dig> and pab <dig> are capable of specifically inhibiting the activity of mmp- <dig> against a synthetic substrate in vitro.

anti-mmp <dig> antibodies enhance myelin formation in vitro
established rat drg cultures were grown for  <dig> days under myelinating conditions, an early time point in the development of myelin in this system, at which point  <dig> nm pab <dig> or  <dig> nm pab <dig> was added and the cultures were incubated for  <dig> hours. mmp- <dig> is a secreted, membrane associated protein  <cit> , is detectable by immunofluorescence at this time point in drg co-cultures  <cit>  and is therefore expected to be accessible to anti-mmp- <dig> antibodies in this system. assessment of myelination was carried out using a fluorescently labeled antibody to myelin associated glycoprotein . in previous experiments we have found that a small percentage of axons have associated mag at this early time point. in all groups, the majority of axons did not have associated mag; however, antibody treatment resulted in increased mag expression in some axon bundles . in untreated cultures,  <dig> % ±  <dig> % of axon bundles had detectable axon associated mag staining while in pab <dig> or pab <dig> treated cultures  <dig> % ±  <dig> % or  <dig> % ±  <dig> % of bundles respectively were found to have axon associated mag expression. this equates to  <dig> * and  <dig> * fold increases for pab  <dig> and pab <dig> treated cultures respectively  .

alteration of signaling pathways after mmp- <dig> inhibition
to begin to understand the mechanism responsible for increased myelination seen in drg cultures with anti-mmp- <dig> antibodies, we evaluated the ability of mmp- <dig> to alter signaling pathways that are known to be important in the development of myelin.

drg co-cultures were induced to myelinate for  <dig> days. at this time point endogenous mmp- <dig> is reduced and a substantial percentage of cells are undergoing myelination and would be expected to have activated myelination related pathways. cells were then treated with fresh myelination media containing ngf with or with out  <dig> nm mmp- <dig>  myelination media contains ngf and is expected to activate signaling pathways including mapk and pi3k downstream of cognate neurotrophin  receptors  <cit>  but is not expected to result in phosphorylation of erbb receptors. the addition of fresh media resulted in a minor increase in phosphorylated mapk within  <dig> minutes which was enhanced in the presence of mmp- <dig> . in contrast, the phosphorylation of the p <dig> subunit of pi3k was inhibited in the presence of additional mmp- <dig> suggesting a resultant decrease in signaling responsible for the development of myelin. interestingly, both erbb <dig> and erbb <dig> were rapidly phosphorylated following mmp- <dig> treatment while the addition of fresh myelination media alone did not result in activation of these receptors. the receptors erbb <dig> and erbb <dig> are known to be involved in both myelination and proliferation  <cit>  however, the presence of mapk phosphorylation suggests a proliferative rather than myelination related response  <cit> . as the drg co-culture system contains a mixed population of cell types, we were interested in determining if the altered signaling occurred in cells involved in the ongoing process of myelination. to identify the cell type with altered signaling following mmp- <dig> treatment, immunofluorescence was performed on d <dig> myelinating drg co-cultures treated with  <dig> nm igg alone, or  <dig> nm mmp- <dig> with  <dig> nm igg, pab <dig>  or pab <dig>  phospho-erbb <dig> was not detected in igg treated control cultures or in cultures treated with mmp- <dig> in the presence of pab <dig> or pab <dig> but was detectable along axons in cells of igg+mmp- <dig> treated cultures . while it remains to be shown if the response localized to this area is within the neurons or glial cells, it is clear that the signaling changes do occur in the microenvironment of myelinating cells. the loss of erbb <dig> phosphorylation in the presence of inhibitory mmp- <dig> antibodies suggests that the proteolytic activity of mmp- <dig> is needed for the observed changes in signaling following treatment. these data indicate that mmp- <dig> alters the signaling in myelinating drg cultures, resulting specifically in increased phosphorylation of pathways associated with proliferation rather than myelination in undifferentiated schwann cells, and that pab <dig> and pab <dig> inhibit this activity. phosphorylation of these signaling pathways in myelinating cells within the context of these drg co-cultures may not be sufficient to elicit a proliferative response, however, to address this possibility drg co-cultures grown under myelinating conditions for  <dig> days were treated with  <dig> nm mmp- <dig> and analyzed for incorporation of a fluorescently labeled dna binding agent to detect any increases in dna content . no increase in cell number as measured by dna content was detected  <dig> hours after mmp- <dig> treatment. alternatively, drg co-cultures prior to myelination induction  were treated with  <dig> nm mmp- <dig> for  <dig> hours and analyzed for the presence of the proliferation marker proliferating cell nuclear antigen  . no increase in proliferation was detected under these conditions, suggesting that the alteration in signaling due to mmp- <dig> treatment may not induce proliferation in this system under these conditions.

increased mmp- <dig> protein in demyelinating lesions
to determine if mmp- <dig> is expressed in demyelinating tissues in vivo, mmp- <dig> expression in two states of demyelination was analyzed. first, demyelination in mice was induced using experimental autoimmune encephalitis  by immunizing mice with a peptide fragment of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein . this model of demyelination is a commonly used model for the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis  <cit> . expression of mmp- <dig> and mag in spinal cord sections from mice with clinical scores of greater than  <dig>  showed that mmp- <dig> was expressed within lesions of reduced mag expression and at least in part found along axons . in contrast, mmp- <dig> expression was found at a lower level in adjacent tissue with continuous mag staining. this pattern of mmp- <dig> expression was consistent in the three eae samples analyzed while mmp- <dig> was not detected in spinal cord sections from normal, age matched spinal cord sections . second, increased mmp- <dig> expression appears to occur in brain tissue of human ms patients. lesions with reduced myelination were identified in cerebellar tissue from a patient with multiple sclerosis by luxol blue staining . these regions are in areas of the cerebellum expected to be myelinated and surrounded by normal, myelinated tissue evidenced with more intense luxol blue staining. mag staining of serial sections also demonstrated loss of myelin. as expected, in regions identified as normal by luxol blue staining, mag protein is strongly expressed indicating normal myelination whereas in the identified lesion, mag was greatly reduced. within the boundaries of the identified ms lesions, mmp- <dig> was detected along individual axons while no such staining was found throughout the normal myelinated regions of the cerebellum. mag staining was not found to co-localize to these structures. as in the normal mouse spinal cord tissue, no axon associated mmp- <dig> was detected in normal human cerebellar tissue . additionally, mmp- <dig>  as detected by western blot in multiple samples, is elevated in cortex taken from ms patients compared to cortex tissue from normal brains . in the normal samples, only the mature  form of the protein was detected while in the ms samples, increased levels of both the pro-  and the mature form of the protein were detected in some, but not all of the diseased tissues. further characterization of mmp- <dig> protein expression in diseased human samples will help to clarify the extent of mmp- <dig> involvement in multiple sclerosis, however, these results demonstrate that in mouse eae and human ms tissues, an increase in axon associated mmp- <dig> can be detected.

discussion
we have shown previously that mmp- <dig> is expressed in the developing nervous system in a temporally regulated manner  <cit> . this expression is inversely correlated with the expression of mag in two models of xenopus laevis nerve regeneration and in myelinating rat drg cultures. these data suggested the possibility that mmp- <dig> may play a role in the development of myelin during normal development and in neural regeneration. here we show that exogenously added mmp- <dig> reduces myelination, that activity in vitro can be inhibited by antibodies to mmp- <dig>  and that such inhibition results in enhanced formation of myelin. specific inhibitors of mmp- <dig> are not known; therefore, we generated antibodies to two distinct regions of mmp- <dig> with the goal of developing inhibitory antibodies. the peptides used were unique to mmp- <dig> and not expected to cross react with other mmps. in addition, the locations of the epitopes were expected to be near the active site based on the known sequence of mmp- <dig>  both antibodies were shown to bind and inhibit mmp- <dig> activity but did not bind or inhibit mmp- <dig> or mmp- <dig>  mmp- <dig> is expressed by drg neurons within the first  <dig> days after initiation of myelination by ascorbic acid  <cit> . as mmp- <dig> expression is downregulated during the period of myelination in vitro as well as in vivo during nerve regeneration, it is possible that mmp- <dig> activity is antagonistic to myelination. if so, blocking its proteolytic activity may result in enhancement of the myelination program. addition of either of the two neutralizing anti-mmp- <dig> antibodies  to myelinating drg cultures resulted in an increase in axon associated mag staining. this strengthens the hypothesis that neuronal mmp- <dig> expression after the onset of myelination acts as an inhibitor of the development of myelin. it is not known if mmp- <dig> acts on the matrix of the neural micro-environment or cleaves cell surface molecules involved in signaling. illman et al.  <cit>  have shown that mmp- <dig> is membrane localized, can induce an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in lung adenocarcinoma cells and alters signaling mediated through tgf beta. we were therefore interested in the signaling changes that may be mediated by mmp- <dig> in our cell culture system and chose to evaluate changes in the erbb activated pathways as signaling downstream of erbb receptors regulates myelination. our initial observations suggest that addition of mmp- <dig> results in rapid phosphorylation of erbb <dig> and erbb <dig> and enhanced mapk phosphorylation. activation of erbb <dig> and erbb <dig> on glial cells can result in proliferative signals or myelinating signals  <cit>  and does not on its own suggest which pathway might be affected. however, erbb receptor activity in myelinating glial cells is characterized by reduced phosphorylation of mapk and enhanced pi3k phosphorylation. the enhanced mapk phosphorylation following mmp- <dig> treatment in drg co-cultures coupled with decreased activation of the p <dig> subunit of pi3k, the active signaling pathway during myelination, are consistent with mmp- <dig> activity enhancing the non-myelination pathway downstream of the erbb receptors. it is not yet clear if mmp- <dig> activity is directly involved in the generation of these intracellular phosphorylation events but there is evidence for mmp-mediated signaling within the nervous system. of particular interest, both neuregulin- <dig> and the erbb receptors are known to be processed by mmp proteolysis  <cit> . as mmp processing of nrg- <dig> leads to soluble nrg and the myelinating signal is dependent on juxtacrine signaling, it is possible that mmp- <dig> cleaves nrg- <dig> in this system and that inhibiting mmp- <dig> activity results in accumulation of membrane bound nrg- <dig>  in previous studies, we identified increased proteolysis of ncam and nogo-a following mmp- <dig> treated of embryonic rat brains  <cit> . alterations in ncam expression may be involved in the development of myelin  <cit>  and nogo-a, a component of myelin, regulates multiple aspects of glial and neural cell biology  <cit> . cleavage of either protein could potentially result in soluble biologically active fragments or loss of function through degradation. alternatively, the degradation of mag by mmp- <dig> is a possibility. previously, we showed that in vitro, at much higher doses than used in these experiments, mag may be a substrate for mmp- <dig>  <cit>  and it could be that mmp- <dig> is degrading mag expressed in the tissues as it develops until the down regulation of mmp- <dig>  the inverse expression of mmp- <dig> and mag suggests that mmp- <dig> regulation is at least temporally coordinated with the myelination program even if it relates only to the post-transcriptional control of mag. however, the correlation of mag staining within myelinated and demyelinated regions of both mouse and human nervous tissue with luxol blue staining, which stains the lipid component of myelin, suggests that mag can be used as marker of myelination even in the presence of varying levels of mmp- <dig>  when taken together with data suggesting that signaling related to the myelination program is altered when exogenous mmp- <dig> is added, these data support the use of mag reduction to represent a delay or inhibition of myelination. further work will be required to determine the essential target of mmp- <dig> action in vivo.

while the experiments performed in vitro demonstrate a role for mmp- <dig> in regulating pns myelination, we were curious if a similar role might be involved in the development or maintenance of cns myelin. we report in this study for the first time that increased mmp- <dig> expression can be detected within demyelinated lesions of mouse eae and human ms nervous system tissue. the increase in mmp- <dig> detected in both cases lends further support to the hypothesis that mmp- <dig> activity is involved in the regulation of myelin. it can not be determined from these experiments if mmp- <dig> activity in these tissues is responsible for the demyelination or if it expressed prior to or during any remyelination, however, the timing of the eae progression in the tissue  and the increased nuclei  in both tissues, suggest that these lesions may be actively demyelinating rather than undergoing the process of remyelination. while these experiments represent a small sample size and need to be followed up to determine the specific lesion types that demonstrate this altered expression, the results suggest that mmp- <dig> may be a relevant target for therapeutic intervention in ms. it is important to note that while there is consistency in mmp- <dig> expression during development in the cns and pns, and between dysmyelination states  the functional implications of altered mmp- <dig> expression in the cns may not be the same as in the pns. also remaining to be characterized is the role of activation of mmp- <dig>  mmp function is carefully controlled by cleavage of the pro- form to generate the active form of the protein. the sequence of prommp- <dig> contains a putative furin recognition sequence but the details of activation for this enzyme in vivo are unknown.

validation of the functional role of mmp- <dig> in the cns remains to be carried out. although the specific mechanism is unknown, mmp- <dig> appears to play a role in the development of myelin. we suggest that in the nervous system, signaling pathways such as activation of the erbb-mapk cascade can be altered in response to mmp-28-induced proteolysis and that continued expression of this protease results in inhibition of robust myelination. if mmp- <dig> activity plays a similar role in modulating myelination in vivo, inhibition of this protease may represent a therapeutic mechanism for enhancing remyelination in demyelinating diseases.

CONCLUSIONS
although the specific mechanism is unknown, mmp- <dig> appears to play a role in the development of myelin. we suggest that in the nervous system, signaling pathways such as activation of the erbb-mapk cascade can be altered in response to mmp-28-induced proteolysis and that continued expression of this protease results in inhibition of robust myelination. if mmp- <dig> activity plays a similar role in modulating myelination in vivo, inhibition of this protease may represent a therapeutic mechanism for enhancing remyelination in demyelinating diseases.
