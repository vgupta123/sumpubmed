BACKGROUND
spatial patterning in most multicellular organisms requires genes to both establish regions of cell differentiation and specify cellular fate. in the early drosophila embryo, for example, cells are organized into boundaries by the pair rule and segment polarity genes, then they acquire distinct fates through homeotic gene expression  <cit> . homeotic genes are also required to establish boundaries during temporal patterning, whereas heterochronic genes define the timing of the cell fate decisions within those boundaries  <cit> . one challenge in developmental biology is to identify and understand the overall developmental role of genes involved in the temporal patterning of genetic programs.

higher plants are well-suited for identifying genes involved in developmental timing because they continually produce easily distinguishable organs throughout the life cycle, whose fates are dependent on the time of emergence  <cit> . the types of leaves that emerge over time often show distinctive developmental changes that allow them to be classified into juvenile and adult leaves. later, when a plant enters reproductive development, the vegetative meristematic region switches to an inflorescence meristem that produces flower bracts with floral meristems in their axils  <cit> . genetic analysis in arabidopsis thaliana has identified a myriad of genes that converge to control the juvenile to adult leaf transitions and the switch of the vegetative meristem to reproductive development  <cit> .

unlike flowers and leaves, which form from a shoot apical meristem, the developmental relationship between embryonic leaves  and adult foliar organs is complicated by cotyledon formation during embryonic patterning. furthermore, in many plants such as arabidopsis, cotyledons switch from a storage organ to a more leaflike photosynthetic organ soon after germination. despite these complexities, single loss-of-function mutations in arabidopsis have been identified in three genes, leafy cotyledon <dig> , leafy cotyledon <dig>  and fusca <dig> , whose mutations result in the replacement of cotyledons with organs more similar to vegetative leaves  <cit> . in lec <dig> and fus <dig> mutants, genes that encode markers of late embryogenesis are reduced or missing  <cit> . by contrast, germination markers that normally proceed late embryogenesis are precociously activated. these expression patterns suggest that lec <dig> and fus <dig> may establish temporal boundaries. although little is known about how these genes contribute to temporal patterns, it is known that fus <dig> regulates and is regulated itself by the synthesis of two terpenoid hormones, abscisic acid  and gibberellins   <cit> . the ratio of these two hormones contributes to proper cotyledon patterning by regulating the rates of cell cycling  <cit> .

although extensive analyses of lec <dig>  lec <dig> and fus <dig> gene action have been carried out with respect to embryogenesis, the effects of these mutations on vegetative leaf development have not been studied extensively  <cit> . it has been shown that after germination, the first juvenile leaves of lec <dig> seedlings are shifted toward later leaf identities; however, this shift is not maintained, and successive leaves and flowering time were corrected back to a wild-type pattern  <cit> . this suggests that embryonic leaf development can have a restricted impact on future vegetative leaf identities. what remains unclear, however, is how cotyledon development impinges on later vegetative development, which is temporally and spatially distinct.

to address such questions, we decided to use a combination of controlled fus <dig> activation during vegetative development with whole-genome transcript profiling. using this approach, we discovered that fus <dig> downregulates a collection of genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis and signaling. consistent with this finding, loss-of-function fus <dig> mutants show ectopic ethylene responses at both the developmental and molecular levels. the fus <dig> plants also show precocious vegetative phase change; however, unlike the lec <dig> mutants, this change is not corrected at later adult stages. more importantly, the accelerated vegetative phase transition can be suppressed by inhibiting ethylene action either genetically or pharmacologically. thus it appears that this previously defined embryonic regulator also has roles in vegetative development. one role of fus <dig> during early seedling growth is to dampen ethylene action, which in turn contributes to a slowing of subsequent vegetative phase transitions. these results add ethylene to the list of hormones that contribute to temporal patterning in arabidopsis.

RESULTS
downstream effectors of fus3
the discovery that fus <dig> misexpression outside embryogenesis can influence vegetative leaf identity suggests that potential fus3-dependent downstream effectors can be identified through whole-genome microarray analysis  <cit> . we constructed an inducible misexpression system by transforming the fus3- <dig>  mutant with a fus3-glucocorticoid receptor  translational fusion under the control of the epidermal specific atml <dig> promoter   <cit> . transgenic seeds were germinated and grown in minimal medium  for  <dig> days, then plantlets were transferred to various concentrations of dexamethasone  to determine the minimal amount of activation needed to influence leaf identity. all concentrations of dex tested had an effect on vegetative leaf shape; increasing concentrations of dex resulted in a leaf with an increased paddle-like shape and a progressively shorter petiole . at higher than  <dig>  μm dex concentrations, the appearance of trichomes on the upper or adaxial surface of the leaves was completely inhibited . on the basis of these conditions,  <dig>  μm dex was chosen as the fus3-activating condition.

putative fus <dig> targets involved in vegetative phase transitions were identified by examining the transcriptome of seedlings that transiently activate fus <dig> using the atml1:fus3-gr dex-inducible system  <cit> . to do this, transgenic seeds from atml1:fus3-gr were germinated and grown for  <dig> days in ms. after this time, half of the seedlings were transferred to ms media supplemented with  <dig>  μm dex , and the other half were transferred to ms media supplemented with dimethyl sulfoxide   for  <dig> or  <dig> days . putative fus <dig> targets were chosen on the basis of the following criteria. genes that increased  or decreased  at least twofold in expression after two days of fus <dig> activation  compared to the control  were considered to represent candidate fus <dig> targets involved in phase transition. utilizing this regime and the average of two replicate experiments,  <dig> genes increased  and  <dig> genes decreased  in expression  as the direct result of 2-day fus <dig> activation  compared to the control . to independently verify the expression changes of the 2-day dex induction experiment, a temporal replicate experiment was performed in which fus <dig> activation was extended by transferring 5-day-old seedlings onto dex for  <dig> days . all but  <dig> of the  <dig> genes selected by the 2-day experiment exhibited similar expression ratios in the 4-day experiment, demonstrating that activation of fus <dig> results in changes in expression levels of a relatively small but reproducible gene set.

gene ontology  was utilized to categorize the activated and repressed genes by function . thirty-eight percent of genes upregulated by fus <dig> activation appear to be involved in enzymatic activity, whereas a number of repressed genes are annotated as having roles in hormone synthesis or action. for example, the cyp707a <dig> gene that encodes the cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase that catabolizes aba is repressed more than twofold by fus <dig> activation   <cit> . this observation, in conjunction with the lack of fus3-dependent induction of known aba biosynthetic genes, suggests the increased aba levels observed previously in fus <dig> misexpression lines are due to decreased aba catabolism  <cit> . a second class of hormone-related genes that are repressed by fus <dig> activation at all time points and in both replicates are either involved in ethylene biosynthesis  or ethylene response . erfs and erebps are transcription factors which contain an ap <dig> dna binding domain, whereas edf  transcription factors contain both an ap <dig> and a b <dig> dna-binding domain. indeed, transcription factors constitute a dominant category  of fus3-repressed genes .

potential downstream targets of fus <dig> would be expected to contain the ry promoter element motif catgca, to which the b <dig> domain of fus <dig> binds  <cit> . in fact, the ry sequence was found to be statistically enriched in both the up- and downregulated gene set compared to a randomized sample . together, these data strongly suggest that our experimental conditions identified a small gene set that is responsive to fus <dig>  interestingly, this set includes only a few genes that typically mark seed maturation and late embryogenesis, such as seed storage proteins and late embryogenesis abundant proteins .

fus <dig> negatively regulates a subset of genes that are responsive to ethylene
a closer inspection of our microarray data yielded additional ethylene-induced transcription factors  whose expression levels were repressed by fus <dig> . these genes did not quite meet the stringent criteria of exhibiting a twofold decrease following both 2- and 4-day periods of fus <dig> activation. of the  <dig> ap2/erebp/erf and rav/edf genes that are known to be induced by ethylene exposure, six genes  were dampened by fus <dig> activation, suggesting that fus <dig> plays a role in reducing the expression of genes involved in ethylene action  <cit> . this was verified by rt-pcr performed on acs <dig>  erf <dig>  edf <dig> and edf <dig> at  <dig> and  <dig> days of dex induction .

fus3-mediated repression of genes involved in ethylene synthesis and action predict that fus <dig> loss-of-function mutants would exhibit an inverse expression pattern of these genes. indeed, expression of acs <dig>  edf <dig> and edf <dig> genes were consistently higher in germinating fus <dig> versus wild type at all time points surveyed after imbibition, whereas erf <dig> expression increased after  <dig> hours . these results again support a negative role for fus <dig> in regulating the expression of these ethylene responsive genes during germination. the presence of the ry element in the promoters of this gene subset may mean fus <dig> directly downregulates their expression. alternatively, fus <dig> may act through ethylene synthesis or signaling to modulate their expression. to test these possibilities, we repeated the rt-pcr analysis of acs <dig>  erf <dig>  edf <dig> and edf <dig> on 2-day old wild-type and fus <dig> seedlings germinated in the presence of either an ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor, aminoethoxyvinylglycine , or an ethylene signaling inhibitor, silver ions . in both cases, the inhibitors partially suppressed the increased levels of the gene transcripts in fus <dig> seedlings compared to untreated controls . furthermore, a key transcriptional regulator of ethylene signaling, ein <dig>  <cit> , showed increased protein stability in the emerging root cells of fus <dig> compared to wild type, and this stability was eliminated by the addition of silver ions . although these results do not exclude a direct role for fus <dig> on ethylene-responsive gene transcription, it does suggest that at least part of the aberrant gene expression observed in fus <dig> mutants does require functional ethylene synthesis or signaling.

to further probe the connection of fus <dig> with ethylene action during germination, we studied the growth of dark-grown fus <dig> loss-of-function seedlings. when wild-type seedlings are germinated in the dark in the presence of ethylene, they show an exaggerated apical hook, a shortening of the hypocotyl and reduced root growth  <cit> . termed the "triple response, " this developmental assay has been extremely useful in genetically dissecting the role of various genes involved in ethylene synthesis or signaling in arabidopsis  <cit> . dark-germinated fus <dig> plantlets grown in the absence of ethylene exhibited shorter hypocotyl growth and hooked cotyledon development , which is consistent with their ectopic ethylene gene expression. moreover, these phenotypes were alleviated by the introduction of a mutation  that reduces ethylene signaling into the fus <dig> genetic background . to further differentiate ethylene synthesis and response, we repeated the experiment in the presence of the ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor avg. in contrast to the ein <dig> mutation, avg did not restore the hypocotyl length of fus <dig>  which suggests that the ectopic ethylene responses observed in dark-grown fus <dig> seedlings were not due to increased ethylene synthesis .

fus <dig> functions to repress ethylene action during germination
the heightened ethylene responses observed in fus <dig> after germination suggest that loss of this gene function might have other, uncharacterized effects on vegetative development. because fus <dig> is a regulator of embryonic leaf identity, we decided to examine the vegetative leaf identity and phase transitions of the fus <dig> loss-of-function mutant more closely. from the emergence of the first leaf after germination through to flowering, each wild-type leaf adopts a unique identity based on size and shape, and this graded growth variation is often referred to as the "leaf heteroblastic series"  <cit> . although rosette leaves always produce trichomes on the adaxial side of the wild-type leaf, trichomes on the abaxial side begin to appear on leaves only at later nodes . leaves that produce only adaxial trichomes are considered juvenile, whereas later leaves that show trichomes on both sides are regarded as adult  <cit> . also, the ratio of leaf blade-to-petiole lengths is generally lower in early juvenile leaves and becomes higher as the plant transitions to adult leaves and flowering  <cit> .

comparisons of leaf profiles between the fus <dig> mutant and wild-type plants showed that the first two leaves from the mutant plant were more similar in shape and size to the third and fourth leaves of the wild type, and that this shift continued throughout the heteroblastic series . this precocious shift was reflected in the blade-to-petiole length ratio of each individual leaf  and in the leaf trichome distribution . abaxial trichomes frequently  appeared on leaf  <dig> in fus <dig> mutant plants, approximately two leaves earlier than the wild type.

fus <dig> has functions outside embryogenesis
there are two explanations for the vegetative phenotypes of the fus <dig> mutant. possibly the altered cotyledon development during embryogenesis in the mutant advances the progression of vegetative leaf identities after germination. alternatively, fus <dig> may function in the developing vegetative meristem. we tested these possibilities directly by measuring fus <dig> transcript levels using quantitative rt-pcr . in wild-type seeds, fus <dig> transcript is detected  <dig> hours postimbibition and declines over time, as previously shown  <cit> ; it is still detectable  <dig> days after germination . to further clarify the source tissue of postembryonic fus <dig> expression, a transgenic line containing a sensitive fus3:gus transcriptional fusion was germinated and sampled over time for β-glucuronidase -dependent blue histochemical staining  <cit> . the fus3:gus line used in these experiments was previously confirmed to reliably report embryonic fus <dig> expression patterns based on fus <dig> in situ hybridization  <cit> . whole-mount preparations of seedlings showed blue staining in emerging leaf primordia from 2- to 5-day-old seedlings . a similar expression pattern was found using a fus3:gfp reporter previously described  <cit>  .

to functionally determine the effect of fus <dig> from embryonic and vegetative tissues on the precocious vegetative phase transition, we constructed transgenic plants in which fus <dig> could be activated either in the embryo or in vegetative tissue. fus <dig> was transformed with a fus3-gr translational fusion construct that was under the control of the native fus <dig> promoter . seeds produced from these lines in the absence of dex application were phenotypically indistinguishable from fus <dig> loss-of-function mutants, with approximately 95% of the seed being desiccation-intolerant after  <dig> weeks of storage . of the small number of seeds that did survive desiccation, all produced ectopic trichomes on their cotyledons, as expected. thus, in the absence of dex application, the fus3-gr fusion protein cannot rescue any of the known embryonic fus <dig> phenotypes. by contrast, in two independent experiments, approximately 50% of the seed produced by transgenic plants sprayed with  <dig> μm dex during flowering showed desiccation tolerance after  <dig> weeks of storage. of these, approximately 85% lacked ectopic trichomes on the cotyledons. the large reduction of fus <dig> seed phenotypes indicates that dex application during flowering is sufficient to rescue mutant embryos.

from the transgenic seeds that were rescued, seven independent plants were randomly selected and grown to maturity in the absence of dex, and leaf profiles were performed. leaf profiles of all these lines still displayed accelerated heteroblastic development similar to that observed in fus <dig> leaf profiles . furthermore, the lines showed the same advanced vegetative phase transition as fus <dig> with respect to both individual leaf blade-to-petiole ratios . the abaxial trichomes, however, did show a partial reversion to a wild-type profile . together, these results suggest that specifically removing embryonic fus <dig> has a limited influence on the development of the first two juvenile leaves of arabidopsis, but not on later leaves.

the inability of embryonic fus <dig> to fully rescue the precocious vegetative phase transitions of fus <dig> suggests that this gene may function outside seed development. we tested this possibility by using the fus <dig> fus3:fus3-gr transgenic lines. unlike in the previous experiment, however, we allowed transgenic lines to produce seed in the absence of dex application and then germinated the seed in the presence of  <dig> μm dex for  <dig> days. this short dex application did not influence the heteroblastic phase change in wild-type plants as measured by either the blade-to-petiole transition or the appearance of abaxial trichomes in comparison to untreated plants . by contrast, exposure of germinating fus <dig> fus3:fus3-gr transgenic seeds to dex for  <dig> days resulted in a partial  or full  shift of leaf heteroblasty back toward a wild-type profile . this rescue was partially reflected in trichome appearance  and in full-leaf measurements; in wild type, the largest leaf was leaf  <dig>  reaching a size of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cm . similarly, the largest leaf in fus <dig> fus3:fus3-gr plants treated with dex was leaf  <dig>  which reached a size of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cm . in contrast, leaf  <dig> was the largest leaf in fus <dig> fus3:fus3-gr untreated plants . in conclusion, a short pulse of fus <dig> during the first  <dig> days of postembryonic growth can influence leaf identity in juvenile leaves.

fus3-dependent vegetative phase variation requires functional ethylene signaling
loss-of-function fus <dig> mutants show advanced vegetative phase transition, increased expression of ethylene-regulated genes and phenotypes that are characteristic of increased ethylene signaling. to test if these phenotypes are related, a mutation conferring ethylene insensitivity was introduced into the fus <dig> background. the introduction of the ein <dig> mutation did suppress defects in vegetative phase change compared to the fus <dig> single mutant as measured by leaf profiles, blade-to-petiole ratios and abaxial trichome appearance . these results suggest that increased ethylene signaling does contribute to the advanced vegetative phase transition phenotype observed in fus <dig> 

to further refine the ethylene contribution, we germinated fus <dig> seeds on  <dig> μm agno <dig> for  <dig> days and transferred the resulting seedlings to soil. again, the fus <dig> phase transition phenotypes in the presence of agno <dig> were similar to those seen in the fus <dig> ein <dig> double-mutant . because in this experiment fus <dig> embryonic development occurred in the absence of the ethylene signaling inhibitor agno <dig>  any alterations in fus <dig> vegetative phase transition were due to the transient inhibition of ethylene signaling during germination. in conclusion, the inhibition of ethylene signaling during early germination is able to partially suppress the premature vegetative phase transitions observed in the fus <dig> mutant.

discussion
the fus <dig> hormonal framework
four lines of evidence suggest that fus <dig> negatively regulates ethylene action. first, gain-of-function activation of fus <dig> dampens the expression of a collection of ethylene-responsive genes, whereas a loss-of-function fus <dig> allele shows the opposite effect. second, the ectopic expression of these ethylene-responsive genes in light-grown seedlings is dampened by the addition of ethylene synthesis or signaling inhibitors. third, loss-of-function fus <dig> seedlings show common ethylene-response phenotypes in the dark which are dependent on ethylene signaling and also have increased stability of the key positive regulator of ethylene signaling, ein <dig>  finally, the precocious vegetative phase variation observed in fus <dig> mutants is suppressed if ethylene signaling is inhibited genetically or pharmacologically.

inhibition of ethylene biosynthesis does not rescue fus <dig> phenotypes in the dark, suggesting that alteration of ethylene signaling in fus <dig> is not merely a consequence of increased ethylene levels and requires functional ethylene signaling. however, genetic manipulation of fus <dig> did influence the expression of acs <dig>  encoding for an enzyme involved in ethylene biosynthesis. the altered expression of this gene might reflect a feedback response to changes in ethylene signaling. on this note, only a subset of ethylene signaling genes was regulated by fus <dig>  which suggests that the relationship between fus <dig> and ethylene is complex. many of the ethylene-responsive genes regulated by fus <dig> contain ry elements in their promoter, which suggests that this transcription factor may bind these promoters directly. a direct regulation of gene transcription may explain why the addition of ethylene inhibitors did not fully alleviate the ectopic expression of the ethylene-responsive genes. nevertheless, the negative effect of fus <dig> on the regulation of ethylene signaling adds this hormone to aba and ga as those that are dependent on fus <dig> during germination  <cit> .

coordination of the synthesis and signaling of various hormones is important in regulating overall plant growth and development, and many examples of ethylene, aba and ga interactions have been reported  <cit> . in one of the best-studied cases, initial submergence of deepwater rice plants resulted in the accumulation of ethylene, which in turn enhanced ga sensitivity of the internodes to promote rapid growth  <cit> . the addition of aba had the opposite effect by decreasing the sensitivity of internode tissues to ga  <cit> . with respect to leaf identity, interactions between ethylene and aba have also been implicated in semiaquatic plants that exhibit heterophylly  <cit> . aba induces terrestrial leaf development and ethylene stimulates the formation of submerged leaves in part by reducing aba levels  <cit> . in arabidopsis, where genetic analysis can be applied, loss of ethylene response does increase aba levels in leaves, and, conversely, arabidopsis mutants deficient in aba synthesis show increased ethylene production  <cit> . the antagonistic and seemingly common relationships between aba and ga and between aba and ethylene imply that fus <dig> acts as a control point of these multiple hormone pathways.

suppressing ethylene signaling in fus <dig> mutants partially rescued the defects in juvenile leaf identities and the accelerated vegetative phase variation of this mutant, but did not rescue the embryonic leaf identity phenotypes. perhaps this is not surprising, because there are major cellular differences beyond size and shape between embryonic cotyledons and juvenile and adult leaves. for example, genetic programs involved in storage reserves and desiccation appear to be embryo-specific. related to this is that controlled fus <dig> activation outside seed development was not sufficient to upregulate most of the standard seed-specific marker genes such as storage proteins, suggesting that other regulators are also required. the absence of seed-specific marker induction by the controlled activation of fus <dig> in seedlings is similar to results obtained by kagaya et al.  <cit> , who also utilized a transgene-based activation system. under their study conditions, vegetatively activated fus <dig> could induce ectopic seed storage gene expression only with the addition of aba. these observations are in contrast to constitutive fus <dig> misexpression experiments, which result in storage reserve accumulation in vegetative tissues. genetically reducing aba levels in plants that constitutively express fus <dig> also attenuates the ability of fus <dig> to activate embryonic programs ectopically, consistent with an aba requirement for full fus <dig> function  <cit> . it appears that there is a limited time during germination during which tissues are more sensitized to fus <dig> action. the presence of the transcription factor abi <dig> has been posited to define a 60-hour developmental window during germination during which aba can still arrest the growth of the emerging embryo and induce late-embryogenesis gene expression  <cit> . whether this 60-hour checkpoint also defines a window in which fus <dig> can reactivate late embryogenesis programming needs to be determined, but our expression studies place postembryonic fus <dig> within this developmental window.

fus <dig> and vegetative phase change
transitions from one leaf identity to the next depend on the coordination of at least two independent processes: the timing of leaf initiation and a program that determines the duration of a developmental phase  <cit> . in the latter case, the genes that define the juvenile boundary may repress the expression of adult leaf-promoting genes above a certain threshold. one prediction of this model is that these juvenile boundary regulators will decrease in activity over time to allow adult phase change to occur  <cit> . fus <dig> transcripts are detected after germination, and although they decrease, they can still be detected  <dig> days postgermination at a time when at least four to five leaf primordia have formed  <cit> . because leaf  <dig> is considered to be the first to show adult characteristics, the decreased temporal domain of fus <dig> expression correlates well with decreasing juvenile leaf identity. a simple model would suggest that the presence of fus <dig> in leaf primordia contributes to juvenile leaf identity and also that as fus <dig> activity drops, the transition to adult leaf phases can occur.

although we have shown a vegetative role for fus <dig>  embryonic expression of fus <dig> also affects the leaf identity of the first two juvenile leaves. this is similar to studies involving lec <dig>  which suggests that the identity of the embryonic foliar organs influences the identity of subsequent vegetative organs despite their different developmental origins  <cit> . unlike fus <dig> mutants, however, aberrant vegetative phase transitions in lec <dig> plants are corrected in later leaves  <cit> . the lack of a detectable lec <dig> signal after germination, as shown in public microarrays  <cit> , may explain the difference between these mutants.

in contrast to animals, plant hormones can function in many different tissues and at various times during development, resulting in various developmental outcomes. one of the mechanisms by which fus <dig> prolongs the juvenile phase appears to involve the downregulation of ethylene action, which suggests that this hormone is important in promoting adult-phase transitions . morphometric analysis of leaf growth of etr <dig> mutants have shown that this ethylene-insensitive plant produce shorter, broader leaves, which are more akin to a juvenile leaf identity  <cit> . consistent with this, the vegetative-to-floral transition in a collection of ethylene-insensitive mutants is delayed compared to the wild type  <cit> . in agreement with this, ml1:fus3-gfp plants that constitutively express fus <dig> postembryonically also show delayed flowering  <cit> . using ethylene to quicken vegetative phase transitions is consistent with the role of this hormone in promoting germination  <cit> . perhaps the short vegetative pulse of fus <dig> serves to dampen the action of this hormone after it has stimulated germination so that the leaf identities do not advance too quickly.

CONCLUSIONS
herein we provide evidence that the embryonic regulator fus <dig> also plays an important role postembryonically by negatively regulating vegetative phase transitions through repression of ethylene action. this study also implicates a role for ethylene in temporal patterning. together with previous findings showing that fus <dig> controls the embryonic-to-vegetative phase transition by modulating the aba/ga ratio, this highlights a pivotal role of fus <dig> in controlling the timing of expression of embryonic and vegetative programs through hormonal regulation. the pivotal role of fus <dig> in regulating hormone levels and responses introduces another dimension to understanding the transitions of leaf identity that occur throughout the plant's life cycle. aba and ethylene levels are also very dependent on both abiotic and biotic external signals, such as water availability, temperature and pathogen attack. hence, the phase transitions observed will be dependent not only on developmental regulators such as fus <dig> but also on environmental changes that influence hormone concentrations. in the future, it will be interesting to see if some of phenotypic plasticity observed in leaf shape can be linked not only to the relative timing of developmental regulators like fus <dig> but also to environmental conditions, both of which impinge on ethylene, aba and ga synthesis and/or signaling.
