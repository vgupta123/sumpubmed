BACKGROUND
penicillin and β-lactam antibiotic play a significant role in human medical history  <cit>  since fleming's discovery of the filamentous fungus penicillium notatum in  <dig>  <cit> . the regulation of penicillin biosynthesis has been studied for many years, together with much more proteins or pathways were discovered . the improvement of p. chrysogenum strains to obtain higher penicillin yields is a main intense objective in industrial research  <cit> .

due to the importance of p. chrysogenum, the genome sequence of low-penicillin producer wisconsin54- <dig>  which is widely used in laboratories, was sequenced and a number of genes responsible for key steps in penicillin production were identified  <cit> . the precursors for penicillin biosynthesis, genes encoding microbody proteins and transporters were found, illustrating potential for future genomics-driven metabolic engineering  <cit> . through classical mutagenesis and screening methods, product titers and productivities of penicillin have dramatically increased since wisconsin54- <dig> strain, but how low-penicillin producer strain was transformed into an efficient producer through improvement is still challenging. for commercial reasons, the improvement of p. chrysogenum strains has never been stopped. the productivity of industrial used strains is far more higher than their ancestor, and the progress was mainly obtained by classical mutagenesis and screening methods. because mutations were random, most of the genetic changes in high yield strains were unclear. although some significant structural variations   <cit>  and differential expression profiling  <cit>  have been found in high-penicillin producing strains, little is known about the underlying whole genomic changes between low-producing laboratorial strain and high-producing industrial strain.

to gain more insight into the genome structural variations of high-penicillin producing strain, we sequenced a chinese industrial strain ncpc <dig>  we also offer a comprehensive comparative genomics analysis  to find all mutations and large-scale structural variations between ncpc <dig> and the first published genome of p. chrysogenum strain, wisconsin54- <dig>  <cit> . some variations including mutations, indels and structural variations were considered for their potential biological impact for penicillin biosynthesis. our genome sequence data and analyses explore the differences between high- and low-yield p. chrysogenum strains and demonstrate the potential useful information to improve strains by direct genetic engineering tools.

RESULTS
genome sequencing, assembly and general characeristics
we sequenced the genome of p. chrysogenum ncpc <dig> using a whole-genome shotgun sequencing strategy  <cit> . owing to different sequencing technologies have various advantages and disadvantages  <cit> , we generated a high quality genome assembly using a combination of first and second generation sequencing platforms and strategies . first, we generated single-end reads using roche  <dig> pyrosequencing platform  <cit>  and mate-pair reads with 3- <dig> kb and 6- <dig> kb insert fragment sizes, using abi  <dig> and megabace  <dig> sanger sequencing platforms  <cit> , respectively. then we generated mate-pair reads with 1- <dig> kb insert fragment size using illumina hiseq  <dig> sequencing platform  <cit>  and used all mate-pair reads to join contigs into scaffolds. overall, we get 204× sequencing coverage of high quality reads for de novo assembly .table  <dig>

the estimated genome size of p. chrysogenum ncpc <dig> is about  <dig> mb.



we got a total genome size of  <dig>  mb  similar as wisconsin54- <dig>  <cit> . the length of longest contig is  <dig>  kb, which indicates fine continuity of assembly. owing to the deeper sequencing data, the contig n <dig> of ncpc <dig> is  <dig> kb which is 70% higher than wisconsin54- <dig> . the scaffold n <dig> of our genome is  <dig>  mb and the longest scaffold is  <dig>  kb, illustrating our genome is suitable for structural variations detection, especially large-scale translocations. the gene structures were predicted with a combined de novo and homology-based approach. firstly, we masked all the repeat sequences in the genome and used fgenesh  <cit>  and genemark-es  <cit>  to provide an initial set of  <dig>  predicted orfs. secondly, we took advantage of the gene prediction results of wisconsin54- <dig>  <cit>  to revise and complement our predicted genes by homology searches. at last, the former two results were integrated together, and  <dig>  protein-coding genes were predicted in p. chrysogenum ncpc <dig> genome . gc content of the genome is  <dig> % and every  <dig>  bp has one gene. the mean gene length is  <dig>  bp and most of the genes have introns.table  <dig> global statistics of the genome assembly and annotation of p. chrysogenum ncpc10086

as to gene annotation, four databases of non-redundant , interproscan  <cit> , swiss-prot/uniprotkb  <cit>  and gene ontology system  <cit>  were used to annotate  <dig>  predicted genes of ncpc <dig> . we found  <dig>  genes have homolog in nr,  <dig>  genes have protein structural domains in interproscan, and  <dig>  genes have homolog in swiss-prot/uniprotkb, and  <dig>  genes can be classified in go. there are  <dig>  genes can be annotated by all four gene annotation systems , suggesting these genes are well studied. the second large genes group is nr-specific with the number of  <dig> , which indicates functions of these genes are just beginning to be understood. the following two large groups are  <dig>  genes with homolog in swiss-prot database and  <dig>  genes with protein domain in interproscan. both of them cannot be assigned to go system, indicating functions of these genes are little known but ready for deeper investigation in some extent. there are  <dig>  genes can be assigned at least one go term for describing cellular component, biological process and molecular function classification .figure  <dig>

genome comparison analysis between p. chrysogenum ncpc <dig> and wisconsin54-1255
p. chrysogenum wisconsin54- <dig> is a low-penicillin producer strain widely used in libraries. the genome sequence of wisconsin <dig> was well sequenced in  <dig>  which is the first published genome of p. chrysogenum  <cit> . the evolutionary relationship between wisconsin54- <dig> and our sequenced high-penicillin strain ncpc <dig> is very close. here we offer a comprehensive genome comparison analysis between these two p. chrysogenum strains, and try to figure out some interesting genomics discrepancy. to access comparative genomics statistics results, we aligned all the genes of wisconsin54- <dig> to the scaffolds of ncpc <dig> to detect gene mutations. there are  <dig>  predicted genes in wisconsin54- <dig> and  <dig>  predicted genes in ncpc <dig>  and we discovered  <dig>  genes are identical between two strains, 89% for wisconsin <dig> and 87% for ncpc <dig>  which indicates these two genomes are very conservative . as to the non-identical genes,  <dig>  genes' identity are higher than 90%, part of them leading to mutations, and only  <dig> genes have less than 60% identity. in addition, we complemented  <dig> genes, which are partial in wisconsin54- <dig> and  <dig> noncoding sequence regions are redefined as protein-coding genes. using wisconsin54- <dig> genome sequence as a reference, we realigned 50× high-quality short reads of ncpc <dig> from illumina hiseq  <dig> to identify single nuclear variations . in order to differentiate sequencing errors from mutations, we used three thresholds to filter out unreliable mutation results:  we required at least five reads for each mutation;  average quality of each mutation had to be higher than 20;  there had to be at least one pair of mate-pair reads to support. we got  <dig> snvs in coding regions and  <dig>  snvs in noncoding regions. there are  <dig> snvs in intron regions,  <dig> are synonymous mutations and  <dig> are non-synonymous mutations, including  <dig> termination codon mutations. all snvs result in coding region is described as figure 2b. furthermore, we found  <dig> deletions and  <dig> insertions in exon regions,  <dig> copy number variations  with the total size of  <dig>  bp. the polymorphic genes with non-synonymous mutations are listed in additional file  <dig> figure  <dig> 
the single nuclear variations  statistics between ncpc <dig> and wisconsin54- <dig>   we discovered  <dig>  genes are identical and  <dig> snvs between two strains.  among them,  <dig> snvs take place in intron regions,  <dig> snvs are synonymous mutations and  <dig> snv are non-synonymous mutations including  <dig> termination codon mutations.



besides, we found  <dig> new genes that do not exist in the available genome sequence of wisconsin54- <dig>  <cit> . we analyzed these new genes carefully and figured out several metabolism, biosynthesis and degradation . firstly, pch125g <dig>  pch106g <dig>  pch114g <dig> genes involved in amino sugar, nucleotide sugar metabolism, n-glycan biosynthesis and oxidative phosphorylation may provide more energy in high-penicillin producer for penicillin synthesis. secondly, we found another new gene, pch106g <dig>  involved in nitrogen metabolism, which is up regulated strongly in cultures supplemented with the side chain precursor paa  in high-producing strain  <cit> . the last but not the least, the new gene, pch018g <dig>  was discovered to participate in glutathione metabolism that may boost production of penicillin. the biosynthesis of cysteine is precursor for the penicillin biosynthesis, and the genes involved in this pathway were over expressed in the high-penicillin producing strain  <cit> . as to the previous study  <cit> , the increase in the cysteine biosynthesis requires a large nadph supply, but the oxidized glutathione under oxidative stress also requires nadph, which could reduce the cysteine biosynthesis. so, we presume that glutathione metabolism may save nadph and indirectly promote the penicillin production.table  <dig> metabolism or progress involved by several "new" genes



to our best knowledge, the penicillin biosynthetic genes cluster  located at chromosome i in p. chrysogenum is the dominant core for penicillin production  <cit> , which exist in all strains, including nrrl  <dig>   <cit> , wisconsin54- <dig>  ncpc <dig>  p <dig> , as-p- <dig> and e <dig>   <cit> . three penicillin biosynthetic genes, pcbab, pcbc and pende are gathered in this cluster . copy number and fragment arrangement are key features about pbc, which could impact on the yield of penicillin. pbc was amplified five to sixteen copies in different high-penicillin producers, such as five or six copies for as-p- <dig> and twelve to fourteen copies for e <dig>  <cit>  . as to the low-productive strain wisconsin54- <dig>  pbc just has one single copy with the length of  <dig>  kb, consisting of a  <dig>  kb fragment and a  <dig>  kb shift fragment bounded by a conserved tgtaaa/t hexanucleotide  <cit>  . through reads coverage detection method, we found seven copies of pbc in ncpc <dig> with the length of  <dig>  kb, including two copies for  <dig>  kb fragment of d--eg'--f'e'--d' and  <dig>  kb fragment of e'--d'f--g, and one copy for  <dig>  kb fragment of e'--d'g'--f' . compared with the previous investigations  <cit> , one pbc fragment arrangement in ncpc <dig> is unique and has never been reported before, orange bar and blue letters shown in figure 3b. it is a  <dig>  kb "new shift fragment" in our genome. we believe the tttaca hexanucleotide and its inverse complement tgtaaa could be hot spots for site-specific recombination after mutation with nitrosoguanidine. unfortunately, the length of pbc is so long that we cannot get the full precise arrangement of these copies.figure  <dig>

the genes involved in fungal secondary metabolic pathways share a common tendency towards physical cluster, with a preference for subtelomeric regions  <cit> . the wide range of translocation is a very interesting phenomenon happened in industrial filamentous fungus, for example, aspergillus niger  <cit> . comparison with wisconsin54- <dig>  we found two large fragment translocations in ncpc <dig>  one is a  <dig> kb fragment in subtelomere  transferred to the around centromere in ncpc <dig> and the range of translocation is about  <dig> mb . to avoid the possibility of assembly error, we realigned mate-pair reads around the breakpoint of translocation and found enough reads to across the breakpoint . moreover, we did pcr identification around the breakpoint and only ncpc  has band with estimated size . this  <dig> kb fragment of translocation includes  <dig> genes from pc22g <dig> to pc22g <dig> and their mean genes size is  <dig>  bp. unfortunately, the functions of most genes are unknown except for pc22g <dig> , which encodes a regulator of nitrogen metabolite repression . we hypothesize that the translocation of pc22g <dig> may promote the nitrogen metabolism in ncpc <dig>  corresponding to the "new" gene discovered in nitrogen metabolism, which is described earlier in this article. another translocation is a  <dig>  kb fragment  transferred to scaffold <dig> of ncpc <dig> starting at position  <dig>  bp . the  <dig>  kb fragment consists of  <dig> genes from pc18g <dig> to pc18g <dig> and their mean size is  <dig>  bp. those genes associate with energy metabolism and peroxisome pathway, such as pc18g <dig>  which encodes mitochondrial adp/atp carrier, and pc18g <dig>  which encodes pex- <dig> . we also did mate-pair reads alignment around the breakpoint of translocation  and pcr identification  to certificate this translocation.figure  <dig>

at last, we focused on some genes involved in homogentisate and the regulators of penicillin biosynthesis. table  <dig> shows the comparison results of these genes between wisconsin54- <dig> and ncpc <dig>  paha gene encodes a phenylacetate 2-hydroxylase that catalyzes the first step of phenylacetate catabolism, decreasing the precursor availability for penicillin biosynthesis  <cit> . owing to a point mutation  in paha gene, the homogentisate pathway for paa catabolism has been reported to be largely inactivated but the penicillin yield is increased in wisconsin54- <dig>  <cit> . based on the comparative genomics analysis, we found paha gene was shown in a  <dig>  kb translocation, but paha gene is identical between the two strains. three other genes, pahb , pahc  and pahd , are strongly similar to paha and all of them belonging to cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases. for pahc gene, there is a mutation  causes a single amino-acid substitution at position  <dig> of the protein: an alanine residue in strain wisconsin 54- <dig> has been substituted to proline in ncpc <dig> strain . for pahd gene, we found a synonymous mutation . all the promoter sequences of these genes are all the same. pclaea gene was found as a global regulator of secondary metabolism, including penicillin biosynthesis, sporulation and pigmentation in p. chrysogenum  <cit> , which is identical in sequence in the genome of wisconsin54- <dig> and ncpc <dig> with the same copy number. due to pclaea gene encodes a velvet-like complex, we checked another velvet-like complex pcvela. its corresponding pcvela gene is a key regulator of metabolism, acting both as an activator and repressor of secondary metabolism in p. chrysogenum  <cit> . there is a mutation  in pcvela gene of ncpc <dig> causes glutamine <dig> to stop codon . through functional domain scanning, we can see that position 28- <dig> is velvet factor non-mutated.table  <dig> single nuclear variations  involved in homogentisate pathway and the regulators of penicillin biosynthesis

discussion
we sequenced the whole genome of an industal high-penicillin producing strain ncpc <dig> and provided an integral whole geome comparison results with wisconsin54- <dig>  a total genome size of  <dig>  mb was assembled with contig n <dig> of  <dig> kb and scaffold n <dig> of  <dig>  mb. the gene structures were predicted with a combined de novo and homology-based approach, and annotated by four gene annotation systems.

by whole genome comparative analysis, we observed a large number of mutations, insertions and deletions, and structural variations. there are  <dig> "new" genes that not exist in the genome sequence of wisconsin54- <dig> and some of them are involved in energy metabolism, nitrogen metabolism and glutathione metabolism. as was expected, the high-penicillin producing strain needs more energy for penicillin synthesis, sorting, transport and processing, and we confirm some new genes participate in it. one "new" gene was discovered in nitrogen metabolism, which is up regulated strongly in cultures supplemented with the side chain precursor paa  in high-producing strain  <cit> . both cysteine biosynthesis and the oxidized glutathione need nadph, if glutathione metabolism is more active, nadph could be reserved for more cysteine biosynthesis to improve the penicillin production. our "new" gene involved in glutathione metabolism may impact on this process.

the penicillin biosynthetic genes cluster  is the well-known dominant core for penicillin production existing in all strains; copy number and fragment arrangement are the key features for pbc. the high-penicillin producing strain, ncpc <dig>  has seven copies of pbc and one  <dig>  kb "new shift fragment" with unique arrangement type. the tttaca sequence and its inverse complement tgtaaa sequence could be hotspots for site-specific recombination after multiple mutations. this process may aim to repair damage from mutations by nitrosoguanidine. we found two large translocations in ncpc10086; one is a  <dig> kb fragment in subtelomere transferred to centromere including genes regulating nitrogen metabolite repression; another is a  <dig>  kb fragment consists of a mitochondrial adp/atp carrier involved in energy metabolism and peroxin- <dig> gene involved in peroxysome pathway.

due to our comparative genomics statistics results, we predicted that energy metabolism and nitrogen metabolism plays an important role in penicillin production together with glutathione metabolism and peroxysome pathway. to further analysis genes involved in those processes, we looked into two types of genes deeper, paha gene set and velvet-like complex genes. translocation, stop codon mutation, synonymous and non-synonymous mutations are found there. these variations may impact the homogentisate pathway for paa catabolism as well as global regulation of secondary metabolism, including penicillin biosynthesis, sporulation and pigmentation.

we found out many mutations and structural variations, but how many of them and how they affect the penicillin yield is still a formidable challenge. efficient approaches to narrow down the possibilities are to sequence more genomes for common variations and system biological investigation using "omic" data  <cit> . through genome resequencing and functional analysis, identification of precise mutations in strains with altered phenotypes will add insight into specific gene functions and guide further metabolic engineering efforts.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first high-quality genome of high-penicillin producing industrial stain of penicilliumchrysogenum, which can provides abundant genetic information for broad biomedical researchers. through comparative genomics analysis with low-producing strain, we found a lot of mutations, insertions and deletions, and structural variations. moreover, we showed some "new" genes not existent in the public genome sequence of wisconsin54- <dig> involved in energy metabolism, nitrogen metabolism and glutathione metabolism. most remarkably, for the penicillin biosynthesis cluster, we are surprised to find a  <dig>  kb new "shift fragment" in our high-producing strain and the type of fragment arrangement is unique. in addition, we addressed a  <dig> kb translocation including a regulator of nitrogen metabolite repression and a  <dig>  kb translocation including genes involved in energy metabolism and peroxysome pathway. our findings lay a foundation for the insights into the high-penicillin producing mechanism and metabolic engineering in the future.
