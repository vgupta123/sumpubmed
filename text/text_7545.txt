BACKGROUND
the level of cholesterol in mammals is tightly regulated by multiple homeostatic mechanisms which affect cholesterol biosynthesis, metabolism and uptake-excretion cycles. this regulation is achieved by different transcriptional factors, including sterol regulatory element-binding proteins  and different members of the nuclear receptor superfamily  <cit> . under certain conditions  cholesterol homeostasis is disrupted and can lead to atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases, gallstone formation or neurological disorders. cardiovascular diseases remain a leading cause of death in the developed world and are therefore an important research area. the central question is how different physiological processes being provoked by endogenous and exogenous sources influence cholesterol homeostasis and what the key targets of these regulations are. these findings are also of crucial importance for the development of novel hypolipidemic drugs.

each exogenous compound entering the body requires detoxification by drug metabolism enzymes from different families. this process is also regulated by members of the nuclear receptor superfamily  <cit> . recent studies have shown important crosstalk between drug metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis through nuclear receptor-mediated pathways  <cit> . however, this complex regulatory network is still far from being completely understood.

microarray technology is a powerful tool and has gained broad usage in basic and medical research. it enables systemic studies of gene expression of selected genes or of the entire genome and can lead to the discovery of new genes involved in biological processes. several commercial and academic dna microarrays are currently available. commercially available are often whole-genome arrays, which are not cost-effective for studies of a small number of selected genes  <cit> . this provides a rationale for developing small-scale arrays, enabling cost-effective studies of a limited number of genes involved in specific biochemical pathways  <cit> , thus allowing more detailed studies of specific biological processes. commercial arrays often do not include genes which may be of a particular interest to specific users  <cit> ; neither do they always offer control over probe sequences. in the development process of a small-scale custom array special care is taken in the selection of the studied genes and specifically the position of their probes. the rationale for designing custom arrays is in the ease of their adaptation, e.g. addition of new genes/probes, removal of non-working probes and modification of the geometry. owing to low production costs and small overhead with annotations the adaptations can be performed on the fly during experimentation, which is unfortunately still not the case with commercially available arrays.

we have developed sterolgene v <dig> cdna microarray as a prototype in a series of sterolgene/steroltalk cdna microarrays. these dedicated arrays enable focused studies of cholesterol homeostasis and drug metabolism in mouse and in human. we have validated the sterolgene array in studies of experimental disturbances of cholesterol homeostasis by inflammation, diet and drugs in the mouse liver. we compared the results to two commercial platforms: the agilent cdna  and the affymetrix moe430a genechip. within this paper we show that the sterolgene array performs as well as any of the two commercial platforms in terms of detection of changes in expression of genes of our interest from the cholesterol homeostasis and drug metabolism induced by the studied factors.

RESULTS
production of the sterolgene v <dig> microarray
the sterolgene array contains  <dig> mouse genes known to be involved in cholesterol homeostasis and drug metabolism. among these are members of the cytochrome p <dig> superfamily, the nuclear receptor superfamily, the abc transporters and other transporter families, genes for cholesterol biosynthesis and srebp signaling and some other genes linked to cholesterol homeostasis . the complete gene list with corresponding accession numbers is available in additional file  <dig>  the positions of probes have been selected according to a priori knowledge of each gene. probes detect all gene transcripts known at the time of design. in case of major differences between transcripts more probes per gene were selected. each gene probe is spotted in  <dig> replicas, three in two blocks. each block contains  <dig> types of positive controls  and  <dig> types of negative controls . these serve as control of quality; positive controls are also used for data normalization. level of unspecific cross-hybridization, background intensity and uniformity were used to optimize hybridization and washing protocols.

normalization of sterolgene data
normalization of sterolgene data was done using lowess fit to normalization spike in rnas according to their average intensity , where r and g represent signal intensities). figure 3a shows a ma plot of sterolgene data and a lowess curve fitted to the normalization controls. however, data from normalization controls were first adjusted according to concentrations in which normalization rnas are added to sample rnas: log <dig> ratios of concentrations are subtracted from the log <dig> ratios of measured intensities ). in figure 3c the same data as in 3a is shown but with normalization controls adjusted according to their rna concentrations. notice the difference between the normalization curves at large a values. such adjustment results in better fit of the normalization curve and consequently in more accurate normalization. figures 3b and 3d show ma plots of data normalized according to the lowess curves shown in figures 3a and 3c, respectively. notice the difference in m for genes with large a values. sterolgene data was normalized in orange software  <cit>  using a dedicated normalization widget, which was developed specifically for normalization of custom low-density arrays.

acute tnfα inflammation and fasting affect cholesterol homeostasis and drug metabolism
the sterolgene microarray was first evaluated in studies of how acute inflammation affects cholesterol homeostasis and drug metabolism. mouse liver rnas from the fasting and tnf-α/fasted experiments were hybridized to agilent  <dig> k cdna microarrays  and sterolgene arrays according to the recommended protocols. differential expression was determined by two tailed student's t-test. for sterolgene data, probability of type i error αs =  <dig>  was used. for agilent data, a complementary probability of type i error was calculated according to bonferroni correction for multiple testing , but final analysis was made using a more relaxed criteria αa =  <dig> .

using the sterolgene array we show that fasting turns off most of anabolic processes due to energy conserving shifts in the liver and we observe a down-regulation of a majority of genes. these genes code for drug metabolizing enzymes , different nuclear receptors , cholesterol biosynthesis  and transcriptional regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis  . we also observed down-regulation of alas <dig>  and cyp11a <dig>  which has previously been reported  <cit> . however, bile acid synthesis  is up-regulated by fasting. three down-regulated  and one up-regulated  gene were confirmed by rt-pcr  <cit>  .

in tnf-α treated fasted mice we observe up-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis  and down-regulation of cholesterol excretion  . however, drug metabolism is further repressed  and this also has previously been shown  <cit> . two up-regulated  and one down-regulated gene  from cholesterol homeostasis have been confirmed by rt-pcr  <cit>  .

note. three mice were used in this experiment.

with the agilent array we were not able to detect any change in cholesterol homeostasis and drug metabolism caused by tnf-α and fasting . agreement between both platforms is low with only one gene in common in tnf-α/fasted experiment  and with no genes in common in fasting experiment.

additionally, we have selected only genes that are present in both platforms  and determined their differential expression using the same p-value cut-off as for sterolgene data . the rationale behind was not to tighten the analysis conditions for agilent data just due to the fact that the agilent array contains more genes than the sterolgene array. in fasting experiment we found  <dig> genes differentially expressed  and of these cyp1a <dig> was confirmed by sterolgene and rt-pcr, actb by rt-pcr, while apoa <dig> was not confirmed by rt-pcr  <cit>  . in tnf-α/fasted experiment we found  <dig> genes differentially expressed  and of these cyp2f <dig> was confirmed by the sterolgene , and actb and apoa <dig> by rt-pcr  <cit> .

low correspondence in differential expression may be due to the fact that of  <dig> genes in common only  <dig> showed significant signal on the agilent arrays. for these genes we calculated pearson's product moment correlation coefficient between log <dig> ratios in both experiments. figure 5a shows a scatterplot of that data. though the correspondence in differential expression is low, we observed a significant correlation between the platforms , which is comparable to correlations reported by other cross-platform comparison studies  <cit> .

phenobarbital and cholesterol feeding affect cholesterol homeostasis and drug metabolism
the sterolgene array was also tested in studies of how phenobarbital and cholesterol feeding affect cholesterol homeostasis and drug metabolism. mouse liver rnas were hybridized to affymetrix moe430a genechips and sterolgene arrays according to the recommended protocols. differential expression was determined by two tailed student's t-test. for sterolgene data, probability of type i error αs =  <dig>  was used. for affymetrix data, a complementary probability of type i error was calculated according to bonferroni correction for multiple testing , but final analysis was made using a more relaxed criteria αa =  <dig> .

in phenobarbital experiment, we detected several previously known up-regulated genes   <cit>  using the sterolgene array . however, among these only cyp2b <dig> was detected using affymetrix arrays . alas <dig>  cyp2b <dig> and cyp3a <dig> were confirmed by rt-pcr .

in cholesterol feeding experiment, we detected down-regulation of the cholesterol biosynthesis  on both platforms . however, with sterolgene we additionally detected up-regulation of the following genes: drug-metabolizing enzyme gene cyp3a <dig> and nuclear receptor shp  as has been previously shown  <cit> , cholesterol transporter scp <dig> , and ldlrap <dig> . cyp3a <dig> and fdft <dig> were confirmed by rt-pcr .

additionally, we have selected only genes that are present in both platforms  and determined their differential expression using the same p-value cut-off as for sterolgene data , with the same rationale as for the analysis of agilent data. in phenobarbital experiment we found  <dig> genes differentially expressed  and of these alas <dig> and cyp2b <dig> were confirmed by sterolgene and rt-pcr, cyp2a <dig> and nr2c <dig> by sterolgene , scap by rt-pcr, while for apoa <dig> and scarb <dig> no confirmation was found .

in cholesterol feeding experiment we found  <dig> genes differentially expressed  and of these fdft <dig> was confirmed by sterolgene and rt-pcr, acss <dig>  cyp51a <dig>  nsdhl, pmvk and sqle by sterolgene , cyp26a <dig> by rt-pcr, while for ppara and scap no confirmation was found .

from the  <dig> genes that are present in both platforms we selected those that showed signal on both platforms and calculated a pearson's product moment correlation coefficient between log <dig> ratios for data from both experiments. figure 5b shows scatterplot of that data. we observed a similar correlation as for the agilent-steroltalk comparison  and comparable to correlations reported by other cross-platform comparison studies  <cit> . since more probes per gene are available on affymetrix array we included all in the correlation analysis.

discussion
systemic studies of cholesterol homeostasis and drug metabolism are still limited. in order to promote the implementation of systems biology approaches to this two research areas, we have developed the sterolgene array. it is a highly customizable tool that together with its human version allows for detailed studies of the two biological processes in mouse and in human. the main goal of this study was to evaluate the performance of the sterolgene array in typical studies of cholesterol homeostasis and drug metabolism in comparison with two commercial platforms . several recent papers discuss the comparative data between different microarrays platforms  <cit> . many of these studies calculated different correlation coefficients, measured reproducibility, but some have also taken into consideration the biological aspects of the comparison  <cit> . this approach was also undertaken in our evaluations of the performance of the sterolgene array.

we have selected different factors, such as diet, drug treatment and inflammation, where scattered information existed about their effect on cholesterol homeostasis and drug metabolism . we analyzed the data as it is commonly done in microarray experiments. in the experiment where mice were on a high-cholesterol diet, we detected genes from cholesterol biosynthesis as down-regulated using both sterolgene and affymetrix arrays. however, with sterolgene arrays, but not with affymetrix, we detected cyp3a family and nuclear receptor nr0b <dig> as up-regulated and as previously described in  <cit> . in the liver of mice treated with phenobarbital, we detected up-regulation of the cyp2b family using both sterolgene and affymetrix arrays and as previously described in  <cit> . however, with sterolgene arrays we additionally detect genes from the cyp3a family, cyp2a <dig> and alas <dig> as up-regulated and as previously described in  <cit> . analysis of affymetrix data using the same p-value cut-off as for the sterolgene data showed two additional genes  as differentially expressed in cholesterol feeding experiment, which were confirmed by another study  <cit>  where also affymetrix arrays were used. however, we were sill not able to confirm the up-regulation of cyp3a <dig> and nr0b <dig>  in phenobarbital experiment we were able to confirm the up-regulation of alas <dig> and cyp2a <dig>  but not cyp3a <dig> 

low agreement was observed between the agilent and the sterolgene arrays in detecting changes in gene expression, regardless of the selected p-value cut-off. in fasting and tnf-α/fasted experiments we were able to detect changes in expression of genes related to cholesterol homeostasis and drug metabolism with sterolgene arrays, but not with agilent arrays. in fasting experiment, we observed metabolic adaptations to energy-shortage. energy-consuming processes as are cholesterol biosynthesis and drug metabolism are down-regulated. however, treatment with tnf-α in combination with fasting reverses these adaptations and up-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis and down-regulation of bile acids synthesis is observed. this results in disrupted cholesterol homeostasis and higher levels of cholesterol present in the mouse liver. all these findings are in agreement with the hypothesis that pro-inflammatory factors such as tnf-α are atherogenic  <cit> .

cross-platform comparisons using correlation analysis showed correlations comparable to other cross-platform comparison studies  <cit> . this result, together with low correspondence in differential expression  provides strong justification for development of small-scale custom arrays. as it turned out with sterolgene data, small-scale arrays are often more sensitive than whole-genome arrays owing to the special care taken in designing probes.

though we were able to show some important correspondence between the steroltalk and both commercial platforms, our comparison has some limitations. first, we were limited by the availability of samples, resulting in low number of biological replicas used for comparisons. additional samples and other diets/treatments may provide valuable information for the comparison and further insight into the performance of sterolgene array. second, we employed t-test based classification of differential expression as this is usually the case in most biologically-oriented studies. this may result in unstable variance  estimation  <cit> . other less rigid classification methods were developed, especially for microarray data analysis where we are usually dealing with small number of measurements. although such methods might result in better correspondence between the platforms, we still decided to use a statistically-based method in order to avoid the biases that alternative approaches often introduce into results. third, lab/platform effect, which can often be higher than the biological effect  <cit>  must not be disregarded in the sterolgene-affymetrix comparison. and most importantly, gene probes are not sequence matched across the compared platforms, which in combination with different approaches to probe design and transcript variant detection can make a major contribution to low agreement  <cit> . finally, labeling step and the choice of using amplification also contribute to differences  <cit> .

one of the obstacles in conducting the comparison, but not the reason for low concordance, was the lack of annotation for probes on the commercial platforms. with all the tools available for microarray annotation there is still a large portion of probes whose annotation remain unknown and need a one by one search in the public databases. well annotated low density microarrays, such as is sterolgene, facilitate less demanding biological interpretation and confirmation of results. another problem exposed in early papers on cdna microarrays is also a high rate of incorrect clones in the cdna libraries used for their production  <cit> . for sterolgene array we have prepared our own cdna library which we confirmed by sequencing.

an important advantage of small arrays is in the design of the probes. for whole-genome arrays, probes are designed automatically with a limited attention dedicated to each gene probe. with smaller arrays, more effort and a priori knowledge is invested into their design, thus enabling more accurate detection of changes in gene expression. the costs of producing and using small-scale academic arrays are still low compared to commercial ones. this is especially true for studies where a large number of microarray experiments is planned, e.g. screening process in the development of new drugs.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that the sterolgene array is a novel tool in studies of cholesterol homeostasis and drug metabolism and can be used for more focused and cost-effective systemic studies. limited to our studies, we have shown that its performance is comparable to the two commercial platforms. its application ranges from basic research of how different factors influence these two biological processes to testing effects of new cholesterol lowering drugs. it is a tool which can be easily adjusted to novel research needs and interests. we are constantly improving the array with new genes and probes; we have recently developed the third version of the array, which contains an expanded list of genes involved in atherogenesis, circadian rhythm, inflammation and metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids, together with its human version consisting of human counterparts of most of the genes, thus allowing analysis of clinical samples.
