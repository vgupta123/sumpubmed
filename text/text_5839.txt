BACKGROUND
mammary tumors are the most common tumor type in women, and they are also the most prevalent tumors in intact female dogs . mammary tumors constitute about half of all tumors in female dogs, and approximately half of canine mammary tumors are malignant  <cit> . in humans, inheritable breast cancers have been linked with mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility gene, breast cancer  <dig> early onset , and the lifetime risk of developing breast cancer is high  in females carrying a brca <dig> mutation  <cit> . a recent study suggested that the canine brca <dig> locus could also be associated with benign and malignant mammary tumors. this study was based on a single nucleotide polymorphism analysis of an intronic marker  <cit> . in support of this notion, we previously showed loss of heterozygosity, a mechanism of brca <dig> inactivation, in a canine mammary tumor sample. furthermore, canine brca <dig> missense mutations, including some that affect brca <dig> function, were also reported in canine mammary tumors .

the brca <dig> protein is involved in homologous recombination repair via its interaction with rad <dig> recombinase, and this function suppresses tumorigenesis. brca <dig> expression levels are important for preventing tumorigenesis, because cells with decreased expression of brca <dig> have heightened sensitivity to agents that induce dna damage, such as dna cross-linking agents and ionizing radiation  <cit> . in other words, the reduced brca <dig> expression leads to tumor formation. one of the most likely reasons why brca <dig> mrna levels are reduced is a mutation in its promoter region. in humans, recent study showed that single nucleotide polymorphisms around the brca <dig> gene affected the expression levels of human brca <dig> mrna and increased breast cancer risk  <cit> .

another pathway that may reduce brca <dig> expression is nonsense-mediated mrna decay , a ubiquitous cellular mechanism that eliminates mrnas containing premature termination codons  to prevent the synthesis of potentially harmful truncated proteins  <cit> . nonsense mutations and splice variants inducing frame-shift mutations downstream of brca <dig> lead to ptc. some ptc-induced mutations in human brca <dig> were associated with nmd  <cit> .

however, in canine mammary tumors, little is known about brca <dig> expression. in this study, we found reduced brca <dig> mrna expression levels in canine mammary tumors. to determine the reason why brca <dig> expression was decreased in canine mammary tumors, we performed a mutation analysis of the canine brca <dig> promoter region and splice variants, the transcript of which may lead to ptc and nmd.

RESULTS
reduced brca <dig> expression levels in canine mammary tumors
the expression levels of tumor suppressor genes such as brca <dig> are important for preventing tumorigenesis in mammary cells. thus, we hypothesized that tumorigenesis may be associated with low levels of brca <dig> expression. we first tested the expression levels of canine brca <dig> in mammary gland and mammary tumor samples by qrt-pcr. we designed primers for exons  <dig> and  <dig>  the last two exons of canine brca <dig>  as expected, the brca <dig> expression level in canine mammary tumors was significantly lower than the level in normal mammary gland tissues .fig.  <dig> mrna expression levels of canine brca <dig> in normal mammary gland and mammary tumor samples. total rna was prepared from seven normal mammary gland and seventeen mammary tumor samples. the relative expression levels of canine brca <dig> were analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr using canine rps <dig> as an internal control. the expression level of canine brca <dig> mrna in mammary tumor samples was significantly lower than that in mammary gland samples 



mutation and promoter activity analyses in the canine brca <dig> promoter region in mammary tumor samples
one possible reason for reduced canine brca <dig> expression is a mutation in the canine brca <dig> promoter region. however, the promoter region of canine brca <dig> was never studied. therefore, we first determined the canine brca <dig> promoter region. in humans, the genomic region from-187 bp to +310 bp at the brca <dig> locus was reported as brca <dig> promoter  <cit> . the putative canine brca <dig> promoter region , which included the region corresponding to the human brca <dig> promoter, was first cloned into the non-promoter pgl <dig> vector, encoding firefly luciferase . luciferase activity in this putative canine brca <dig> region was comparable to that at the human brca <dig> promoter . thus, we concluded that this putative promoter of canine brca <dig> functioned as the true canine brca <dig> promoter.fig.  <dig> determination of the canine brca <dig> promoter region. to determine the sequence of canine brca <dig> promoter region, the region corresponding to the human brca <dig> promoter was cloned into the pgl <dig> vector. the transfection efficiency was normalized with the co-transfection and measurement of renilla luciferase activity. results shown represent mean ± sd of triplicate experiments



we next performed a mutation analysis of the brca <dig> promoter region in the canine mammary tumor samples. we sequenced the dna within this region and identified  <dig> allele types in canine mammary tumor samples . these variations were located in the putative cis-element, which corresponds to the site necessary for human brca <dig> expression . we next investigated the effects of these variations on canine brca <dig> promoter activity using a luciferase reporter assay. however, none of these variations affected the activity of the canine brca <dig> promoter with or without dna damage by x-ray irradiation .table  <dig> promoter region allele types in mammary tumor samples

detection of splice variants
another reason for decreased mrna expression is nmd, a ubiquitous cellular mechanism that eliminates ptc containing mrnas to prevent the synthesis of truncated proteins that may be detrimental to cells  <cit> . one of the causes of ptc is a frame shift mutation induced by a splice variant. we next attempted to detect brca <dig> splice variants, which may contain frame-shift mutations, in mammary tumor samples using a modified method that we reported previously  <cit> . in our previous study, we established primer sets to detect splice variants of canine brca <dig>  in this study, we chose a primer set that amplified the region encoding exons  <dig> to  <dig>  this region was chosen because splice variants have been detected for a homologous region in human brca <dig>  and we speculated that canine mammary tumors might show a similar result  <cit> . indeed, we detected two splice variants: one lacking exons 14– <dig>  and the other lacking exons  <dig> and  <dig>  the variant lacking exons  <dig> and  <dig> showed a frame-shift mutation and ptc in  <dig> out of  <dig> canine mammary tumor samples . in two mammary tumor samples , the expression level of the splice variant was comparable to that of the wild-type splicing form. surprisingly, even in the pcr products from normal canine mammary gland tissues, we detected a faint signal of the splice variants ; however, the wild-type splicing form accounted for the majority of mrna transcripts.fig.  <dig> detecting splice variants in mammary tumor and mammary gland samples. a splice variants missing exons 14- <dig> were detected in mammary tumor samples. the left panel shows the pcr products detected by 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis, and the right panel shows the dna sequence chromatogram. b splice variant missing exons  <dig> and  <dig> were detected in mammary tumor samples. the left panel shows the pcr products detected by 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis, and the right panel shows the dna sequence chromatogram. c splice variants detected in mammary gland samples. symbols are as follows: *, splice variant missing exon 12; §, splice variant missing exon 14; #, splice variant missing exons 13-16



we also sequenced exon-intron boundary region of the  <dig> mammary tumor samples where splice variants were detected, as mutations at these boundaries induce splice variants. however, there were no mutations in these regions in any of the  <dig> tumor samples analyzed.

discussion
reduced brca <dig> expression disrupts homologous dna recombination repair mechanisms, leading to tumor formation  <cit> . in this study, we compared the expression levels of canine brca <dig> in mammary gland tissue and mammary tumor samples. we found that brca <dig> expression was significantly reduced in mammary tumor samples compared to mammary gland samples. these results suggested that the low expression of canine brca <dig> may be related to mammary tumor development in dogs.

we further investigated possible reasons why canine brca <dig> expression was reduced in tumor samples: mutations in the brca <dig> promoter region and non-sense mrna decay  induced by ptcs that can form in splice variants. to do this, we first identified and sequenced the canine brca <dig> promoter region. we found that some cis-elements in human brca <dig> promoter were not conserved. this suggests that regulatory mechanisms controlling brca <dig> transcription are different in dogs or perhaps that there are unknown cis-elements in the canine and human brca <dig> promoters  <cit> . regardless the differences in cis-elements between the canine and human brca <dig> promoter region, we found that the promoter activity of the canine brca <dig> promoter was comparable with human brca <dig> promoter. a brca <dig> promoter sequence analysis of mammary tumors revealed nine promoter allele types. interestingly, these variations were located near the corresponding site of a human brca <dig> cis-element; however, none of the alleles disrupted canine brca <dig> promoter activity, including in cases with dna damage by x-ray irradiation. these results led us to conclude that the nine alleles harbored neutral mutations and that they were not associated with tumorigenesis.

we also explored whether the nmd system induced by ptcs could account for reductions in brca <dig> levels. one way to form ptcs is through splice variants. detection of splice variants is more efficient than analyzing the entire brca <dig> sequence because brca <dig> is a large gene product . we detected splice variants in  <dig> out of  <dig> canine mammary tumor samples and  <dig> out of  <dig> normal mammary gland samples. in two of the mammary gland samples, the expression level of the splice variants was comparable to that of the wild-type splicing form. because, one of the splice variants lacking exons  <dig> and  <dig> induced frame-shift and ptc, it is possible that canine brca <dig> mrna levels were reduced by these splice variants inducing ptc and the nmd system. although this splice variant would not affect the mrna levels of canine brca <dig>  the transcripts would not have nuclear localization signals located at the c-terminal and would not function in the nuclei  <cit> . because the most important function of brca <dig> is dna repair in the nuclei, another possibility is that the splice variant lacking exons 14– <dig> is associated with mammary tumors. the splice variant lacking exons 14– <dig> does not induce ptc. its transcript lacks the front part of helical domain, where brca <dig> interacts with dss <dig>  a stabilizer  <cit>  . thus, the transcript from the splice variant lacking exons 14– <dig> would be unstable and could be associated with mammary tumors.

one of variant transcripts found in mammary gland samples was missing exon 12; this variant was also reported in human brca <dig>  <cit> . exon  <dig> encodes a 96 bp region of both canine and human brca2; therefore, this particular splice variant does not induce a frame-shift mutation. human brca <dig> transcripts missing exon  <dig> did not have any effect on dna repair activity. thus, it was suggested that canine brca <dig> transcripts missing exon  <dig> did not affect its function and expression levels. the expression levels of the other two splice variants, which were missing exon  <dig> or exons 13– <dig>  were very low compared to that of wild-type transcripts. we assumed that the low expression level of these splice variants did not affect brca <dig> mrna expression. we also tried to determine the presence of mutations in the exon-intron boundary regions of the brca <dig> transcripts, which is the most likely reason for the existence of splice variants. however, we did not detect any mutations in these regions. this result suggested that the splicing machinery might not function properly, resulting in brca <dig> splice variants.

other reasons for the reduction in canine brca <dig> mrna levels are still unclear. one possible explanation may be unregulated mirna expression. recently, the discovery of some mirnas regulating brca <dig> expression levels were linked to breast cancer development in humans  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that the expression of mirnas could decrease canine brca <dig> expression at the mrna level; however, it is unknown whether the same mirna mechanism regulating human brca <dig> expression is functional in canines. further studies are needed to address this issue.

further studies are needed to reveal the correlation between canine brca <dig> transcript and protein levels in mammary tumor samples. unfortunately, in this study, we collected mammary tumor samples soaked in rnalater solution; therefore, we could only test brca <dig> mrna levels and could not determine brca <dig> protein levels by western blotting or immunohistochemistry. in future studies, mammary tumor samples should be collected in two batches: one for rna extraction and the other for western blotting or immunohistochemistry.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we showed that canine brca <dig> mrna transcript levels were significantly reduced in mammary tumor samples compared to normal mammary gland tissue. one of the reasons for reduced brca <dig> expression was nonsense-mediated mrna decay , a ubiquitous cellular mechanism that eliminates premature termination codon that can be found in splice variants. our results suggested that low brca <dig> expression in canine mammary tumors is a possible mechanism that leads to tumorigenesis. however, we still need to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate brca <dig> expression levels, and how low brca <dig> expression leads to the development of canine mammary tumors.
