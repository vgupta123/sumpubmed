BACKGROUND
the global human population is projected to be  <dig> billion by  <dig>  to meet this rapid growth of the world’s population the predicted demand for food production must increase  <dig>  fold by  <dig> . on the other hand, such increase in food production must be obtained with reduced agricultural inputs, in particular those related to nitrogenous  fertilizer, for long term sustainability of food production. reduction in n fertilizer use will bring at least two benefits: i) reduced emissions of co <dig> and gaseous n oxides from agricultural processes and ii) decrease of the food production costs, since up to 50% of the operational cost for crop productions arises from n fertilizers  <cit> . in addition, for the last 40 years crop production increased by  <dig>  fold mostly promoted by a  <dig>  fold increase in mineral n fertilizers application, which means that the n use efficiency  has declined  <dig>  fold in that time  <cit> .

an alternative to improve nue is to use plant growth-promoting bacteria , since these bacteria are able to increase root-system development and improve acquisition of nutrient including n  <cit> . azospirilla is one of the most promising pgpb genera. in latin america, hundreds of thousands of hectares have been inoculated with azospirillum-based commercial inoculants, increasing grain yields of economically important crops such maize and wheat  <cit> .

wheat  is one of the oldest and widespread crop species. with a production of approximately  <dig> million tons per year, this crop feeds more than 35% of the world’s population  <cit> . significant worldwide efforts of wheat-breeding programs, supported by modern biotechnology, have been applied to increase grain yield, nutritional content, as well as salinity-, drought- and biotic-tolerance  <cit> .

studies of plant-bacterial interactions  have been taking advantage from high-throughput techniques and also from the constant improvement of genome sequencing and annotation of both bacteria and plants  <cit> . however, there is a lack in the application of these recently established techniques in the area of plant-pgpb interaction  <cit> . furthermore, although it is well documented that pgpb, in particular a. brasilense, can increase plant productivity in several important crops, the mechanism of the plant-bacterial interaction is not entirely understood  <cit> .

here we performed a dual  rna-seq transcriptional profiling of colonized wheat roots, motivated by the idea that a better understanding of both wheat and a. brasilense gene expression might bring insights into: i) the molecular mechanisms of host response; ii) the bacterial colonization strategies; and iii) how to improve plant productivity.

RESULTS
improved growth of wheat seedlings colonized by azospirillum brasilense
a model of plant-bacterial interaction was set up under axenic conditions. surface sterilized wheat seeds were germinated on plates of agar/water and transferred to glass tubes containing 25 ml of salt solution . wheat seedlings were incubated at 26°c for 24 hours with a light cycle of 14 hours and then inoculated with  <dig>  ml of bacterial suspension containing  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu per milliliter. controls were carried out with non-inoculated wheat seedlings.

bacterial counts showed that three days after inoculation root colonization reached  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu per gram of fresh tissue , but no bacteria were recovered from surface sterilized roots indicating that the a. brasilense strain fp <dig> is an epiphytic colonizer. root mass of colonized plants increased up to 30% when compared with non-inoculated plants and the total mass of colonized plants increased by 25% compared with non-inoculated plants . wheat root size was also enhanced in colonized plants . in addition, we have analyzed colonized and non-inoculated wheat roots by cell flow cytometry: the number of cells with higher content of dna increase up to 40% in inoculated roots, indicating a higher proportion of cells in the s-phase .figure  <dig>

rna-seq transcriptional profiling
the rna-seq transcriptional analysis was carried out in two independent samples  of each treatment , yielding a total of  <dig> sequencing libraries of seedling roots, which were designated cwr <dig> and cwr <dig> libraries  and n-iwr <dig> and n-iwr <dig>  . each sample was made up of roots of  <dig> seedlings . two sequencing runs of each cwr and n-iwr cdna libraries generated  <dig> million 50 bp reads yielding more than  <dig> gigabase of sequenced data. the total of sequenced reads was first mapped to the t. aestivum ribosomal rna to clean-up the sequence data from wheat rrna . approximately  <dig> gigabase of rrna-free sequence data was then mapped to three reference datasets: 1) unigene-est of t. aestivum; 2) micrornas-databank of t. aestivum; and 3) a. brasilense fp <dig> draft genome. a total of  <dig>  expressed sequences from wheat roots and  <dig> expressed sequences from a. brasilense, both with 3-fold or higher coverage, were then quantitatively analyzed.figure  <dig> 
mapping strategy.




rna-seq transcriptional profiling: mapping strategy
after the ribosomal rna removal, the analyses of the wheat roots transcriptome profiling involved  <dig> main-steps : 1) sequential mapping of reads to different reference datasets ; 2) de novo assembly of unmapped reads; and 3) mapping of unmapped reads to de novo assembled ests. using this strategy, we were able to improve the number of mapped reads by  <dig> -fold . the removal of reads mapping to t. aestivum ribosomal rna sequences from the cwr and n-iwr libraries  was necessary to avoid expression bias, since in a first mapping trial using as reference unigene-est a high number of ests/rrna chimeras was found . the rrna-free sequences of cwr and n-iwr  were then mapped to t. aestivum unigene-ests data sequence. a total of  <dig>  ests of wheat was expressed,  <dig>  in the cwr libraries and  <dig>  in n-iwr libraries .

the unigene-unmapped sequences  were then mapped to the micrornas-dataset of t. aestivum. among the  <dig> described wheat micrornas  <cit>  fifteen were expressed,  <dig> in cwr- and  <dig> in n-iwr-libraries . the micrornas-unmapped sequences  were subsequently mapped to the a. brasilense genome sequence strain sp <dig>  <cit>  and to a draft genome of the fp <dig> strain . two hundred and twenty eight genes of the a. brasilense fp <dig> strain were identified in the cwr libraries with 3× or higher coverage and none in the n-iwr libraries. furthermore, when a less stringent coverage cut-off  was applied,  <dig> a. brasilense transcripts were identified in the cwr libraries and no expressed orf was found in the n-iwr libraries .

finally, the unmapped reads, named cwr-unm  <dig> and n-iwr-unm  <dig>  which represent reads that did not align to any of the reference sequence datasets, were used to assemble the transcripts de novo. a total of  <dig>  contigs were assembled and used as reference to map the reads of the cwr-unm  <dig> and n-iwr-unm  <dig> libraries . of the  <dig>  assembled contigs,  <dig>  had enough mapped reads  to be considered expressed;  <dig>  in the cwr libraries and  <dig>  in the n-iwr libraries .

rna-seq biological variability
biological variability was checked by pearson correlation coefficients comparing deseq-normalized expression values within the biological replicates. correlation coefficients for cwr libraries were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  , whereas biological replicates of n-iwr libraries had correlation coefficients of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  . correlation coefficient for a. brasilense-mapped reads was not calculated for n-iwr libraries since no expressed orf was found in these libraries. overall, data reproducibility in this study was high and, except for n-iwr mapped to de novo assembled transcripts, all pair correlation coefficients were ≥  <dig> .

comparison of triticum aestivum rna-seq profiles: cwr vs n-iwr
gene expression levels in the cwr  libraries are expressed as fold-differences in relation to the expression levels in the n-iwr  libraries. in the following sections, when we attribute effects on gene expression to a. brasilense colonization, we are comparing cwr libraries with n-iwr libraries.

within the  <dig>  expressed-ests  a. brasilense colonization caused changes in the expression of  <dig> ests , hereafter named as regulated-ests. of these,  <dig> ests were up-regulated and  <dig> ests were down-regulated .

to gain insight into the putative processes involved in the plant-bacterial cross-talk a gene ontology  analysis of the three go categories - biological processes , molecular functions  and cellular components  - was carried out . to determine whether any of the categories were overrepresented in the group of regulated-ests we compared the percentage of each go category in the sub-set of regulated-ests to the percentage of same go category in the sub-set of expressed-ests, and values higher than  <dig> -fold were considered overrepresented in the subset of regulated-ests. the overrepresented categories in the subset of up-regulated ests included: 1) transport activity and enzyme regulator activity ; 2) biological regulation and death ; and 3) macromolecular complex and extracellular region . while in the down-regulated sub-set these categories comprised: 1) transcription factor activity ; 2) biological regulation ; 3) macromolecular complex and extracellular region  .figure  <dig> 
gene ontology analysis. expressed and differentially expressed wheat genes were classified in the three main gene ontology categories:  molecular functions;  biological processes; and  cellular components. exp: expressed; down: down-regulated in colonized roots; up: up-regulated in colonized roots.



mrna levels by quantitative reverse transcription pcr 
quantitative reverse transcription pcr was used to confirm the differential expression of ten selected genes from t. aestivum  and four from a. brasilense . in all these genes, there were a very good correlation between rna-seq and rt-qpcr . t. aestivum gene expression was normalized according to transcript levels of pp2ac <dig>  ubcce <dig> and a beta-3-tubulin transcript and a. brasilense genes according to rpoc transcript levels. the selected genes comprised both sub-sets of regulated ests .table  <dig>

identification of differentially expressed microrna of triticum aestivum inoculated with azospirillum brasilense
fifteen wheat micrornas were found in the rnaseq data, and one of them, tae-mir <dig>  was up-regulated in the colonized roots  . mir <dig> and its predicted target, mads box transcriptional factors, are conserved in monocots. mads box transcriptional factors play key roles in controlling floral organ development in cereals during vernalization   <cit> . one other possible target for mir <dig> is an homolog of a. thaliana regulatory factor anr <dig>  which is a mads box transcriptional factor that promotes lateral roots elongation in response to nitrate supply  <cit> . seventeen ests encoding mads box transcriptional factors were expressed in the wheat roots, but no significant change in expression was noted when we compared cwr to n-iwr libraries . further investigation is required to determine the possible role of mir <dig> up-regulation in colonized roots.

azospirillum brasilense expressed transcripts in wheat roots
of the  <dig> expressed genes of a. brasilense those related to bacterial adhesion, adaptation processes and nitrogen fixation were the most recurrent . we identified several genes encoding proteins related to the initial steps of plant-bacterial interaction . the sbpa gene, which encodes an acidic a. brasilense protein induced by root exudates  <cit> , was highly expressed in the cwr-libraries. rt-qpcr analyses confirmed expression of sbpa in a. brasilense colonizing wheat roots . the protein sbpa is required for chemotaxis towards sugars  and is involved in the uptake of d-galactose  <cit> . the transcriptional regulator gbpr and the abc sugar transporters ggua and ggub were also highly expressed in the cwr-libraries. additionally, genes encoding: monosaccharides transporters, and proteins related to polysaccharides, exo-polysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides biosynthesis and transport were also highly expressed in the cwr-libraries . moreover, three genes of calcium-binding proteins , which have been associated with rhizobium adhesion on host roots  <cit> , were expressed in cwr-libraries. taken together these results suggest that the time point of the colonization picked to perform the rna-seq experiments  corresponds to the initial steps of plant-bacterial interaction, when chemotaxis, adhesion and biofilm formation are prominent processes.

interestingly, a narl-like gene was highly expressed in cwr-libraries, a result confirmed by rt-qpcr analyses . narx/narl is a classical two-component system of membrane sensor protein  and dna-binding regulator  that regulates the respiratory membrane-bound nitrate reductases in e.coli and p. aeruginosa <cit> . in addition, among the expressed genes we found seven orfs involved in production of poly-β-hydroxy-alkanoates   synthetase and phasins). this result is consistent with the finding of high amounts of intracellular phas in a. brasilense cells colonizing wheat root surface . finally, expression of a. brasilense superoxide dismutase   indicates activation of oxidative stress protection systems of a. brasilense against plant-defense oxidative burst.

a. brasilense is able to convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonium through the action of the nitrogenase complex under appropriate conditions   <cit>  and it may transfer fixed nitrogen to the associated plant. the relative high expression of nitrogenase complex genes , which was also confirmed by rt-qpcr analyses , suggest that a. brasilense adhered to wheat roots is fixing nitrogen. expression of nitrogenase complex on wheat roots has been shown using nifh:lacz fusion  <cit> .

differentially expressed wheat genes associated to plant-microbe interaction
first, we focused our analysis on the screening of the host response usually found at some stage of plant-microbe interaction. the wheat ests encoding host response proteins were grouped into three sets: 1) defense mechanism; 2) hormone imbalances and 3) secretion of phytochemicals.

defense mechanism
we looked at the wide variety of inducible defense mechanisms  usually triggered upon microbe recognition. hundreds of defense-related ests , endoglucanases, disease resistance proteins, etc.) were found among the expressed ests ; twenty-eight of those had changes in their expression in response to a. brasilense colonization . changes in expression of r-genes were found in both sub-sets of down-regulated  and up-regulated ests . in addition, ten heat shock proteins , which play roles in plant response defense and are also required to fold lrr-receptors in a signal competent state  <cit>  were found in sub-sets of up-regulated ests .

hormone imbalances in colonized plants
the phytohormones auxins and ethylene have been intensely studied in plant growth and development. three ests encoding auxin-induced proteins changed their expression in response to a. brasilense colonization . the first was a transcriptional factor ettin/arf <dig>  which mediates auxin dependent flower and fruit development by binding on auxin receptor  . an aldo-keto-reductase auxin-induced was also down-regulated  while a calmodulin-dependent auxin-induced protein saur , whose response is mediated by calcium, was up-regulated . in addition, three calmodulin-like proteins were down-regulated by a. brasilense colonization . additional investigations are required, including gene expression of aerial parts of wheat, to bring insights into the pattern of auxin-related gene expression in response to a. brasilense colonization.

a. brasilense colonization promoted an interesting decrease of expression of aco, which encodes for acc oxidase  . acc oxidase catalyzes the conversion of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate  to ethylene. although ethylene production regulation is most related to acc synthase expression, acc oxidase transcription also contributes to regulation of ethylene production  <cit> . this result suggests a decreased amount of ethylene production in inoculated wheat roots. thus, a. brasilense colonization might suppress the inhibition of root cell elongation promoted by ethylene, reflected in the improvement of root systems of colonized plants.

secretion of phytochemicals
three ests encoding enzymes related to flavonoids biosynthesis showed expression decreased in response to a. brasilense colonization: flavonol 3-sulfotransferase and two anthocyanidin -o-glucosyltransferases . flavonol 3-sulfotransferase catalyzes flavonoid sulfation, and flavonoid sulfates are supposed to be involved in detoxification of active hydroxyl groups and in sequestering of sulfate groups of plants growing under saline conditions. interestingly, anthocyanin biosynthesis is activated by nitrogen deficiency, while nitrogen compounds  repress the flavonoid biosynthesis  <cit> , raising the possibility of improvement of nitrogen nutrition of the colonized wheat roots.

wheat response to azospirillum brasilense colonization
a. brasilense colonization caused changes in the expression of  <dig> ests ranging from transporters, heat shock proteins, helicases, resistance-proteins , to cell cycle control.

close to five hundred ests encoding transporters were expressed by wheat roots; among these,  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated . in addition,  <dig> more est encoding proteins, which were grouped in transport activity by go analysis, were expressed in wheat roots  . interestingly, genes encoding a nitrate efflux transmembrane transporter  and an oligopeptide transporter  were  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, respectively, up-regulated, whilst another twenty three nitrate transporters showed no significant change in expression . however, we did not find any significant change in nitrogen content  in the hydroponic medium 3 days after wheat roots inoculation . on the other hand, two ests encoding a cytosolic form of glutamine synthetase  were up-regulated  . gs activity composes the major route for inorganic n incorporation into organic molecules  <cit> . gs <dig> expression was also shown to be up-regulated in sugar cane seedlings colonized by the pgpb gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus and herbaspirillum rubrisubalbicans <cit> .

twenty-two ests encoding proteins related to cell cycle regulation and improvement of root growth showed changes in their expression responding to a. brasilense colonization,  <dig> in the sub-set of up-regulated and  <dig> in the down-regulated ests . the higher number of up-regulated ests of this class agreed with the flow cytometry results  that showed an increased proportion of cells in the s-phase, which indicate higher rates of dna replication in colonized wheat roots.

discussion
simultaneous rna-seq analysis of wheat roots and azospirillum brasilense
to our knowledge, this is the first report of a dual rna-seq transcriptional analysis of plant-pgpb interaction . there are only few studies with the application of high-throughput techniques  in plant-pgpb interactions  <cit> , including those focused either on the host or the pgpb. on the other hand, investigation of host-pathogen interactions by dual rna-seq   <cit> ) has become feasible and expected to become the gold standard in the studies of host-microbe interactions  <cit> . further dual rna-seq quantitative studies of plant-pgpb interaction should be undertaken in order to improve knowledge of the molecular basis of plant benefits by pgpb.

although the common wheat  is one of the most important food crops in the world, the complete assembly of its genome sequence is not available. large genome , high amount of repetitive sequences  and hexaploid nature make the complete assembling of wheat genome a very hard task to be accomplished. luckily, rna-seq transcriptional profiling is a quite practical alternative to assess the functional genome of non-model organisms with no defined genome reference.

several wheat transcriptional studies have successfully applied rna-seq analyses to investigate wheat transcriptomes applying two main strategies: 1) assembling of sequenced reads into contigs  during monocarpic senescence  <cit> , and assembly of transcripts to investigate polyploidization events in common wheat  <cit> ); and 2) mapping the sequenced reads to a reference of wheat ests or to a genome of a correlated organism such as rice  .

here, we used a mixed strategy, by mapping the reads to wheat-ests and assembling of unmapped sequence reads. this strategy allowed for an improvement in the number of quantitatively analyzed genes.

a possible role of narx/narl-like operon on azospirillum-wheat root adhesion
the narx/narl operon regulates the respiratory membrane-bound nitrate reductases in e.coli and p. aeruginosa <cit> . nitrate binds to the p box element  altering narx conformation, allowing its auto-phosphorylation and subsequent phosphorylation of narl, which in turn binds to specific dna target sites resulting in activation or repression of target operon transcription  <cit> . in e. coli expression of the narxnarl operon is activated by fnr proteins under limitation of oxygen and by narl in the presence of nitrate  <cit> . interestingly, in p. aeuruginosa narx/narl plays an essential role in the biofilm through the activation of the motility regulon that controls the biofilm dispersion  <cit> . the narl-like protein of a. brasilense expressed during colonization may play a similar role in adhesion to the root surface.

triticum aestivum expression profile modulated by azospirillum brasilense colonization
nitrate transporters
plants respond to nitrate, which is the major source of mineral nitrogen for higher plants, improving its up-take and metabolism. the most prominent effect of nitrate supply is the stimulation of lateral root formation  <cit> . genes encoding a nitrate efflux transmembrane transporter  and an oligopeptide transporter of the nrt <dig> family  were up-regulated in colonized roots. nitrate efflux was reported in response to stress-generated ph acidification in a. thaliana growing in hydroponic medium  <cit> . nitrate efflux was also reported as an early signaling mechanism in tobacco plants as a response defense against crytogein, a proteinaceous elicitor from a virulent tobacco pathogen   <cit> . additional investigations are required to determine a possible role of nitrate efflux transmembrane transporter up-regulation in colonized roots.

phytochemicals and phytohormones
it is well known that secretion of phytochemicals is a critical step in plant-microbe interaction . for example, plant root exudates containing flavonoids are recognized by rhizobium and play a critical role in the legume-rhizobium symbiosis  <cit> . in addition, plant hormones  play important roles in response to biotic stress, e.g., bacterial colonization. besides their significant role in response to biotic stress, phytohormones also play essential roles in the regulation of plant growth and development  <cit> . abiotic and biotic stresses challenge plant tissues triggering ethylene production, which promotes, among other effects, inhibition of plant root cell elongation  <cit> . the acc oxidase  expression was down-regulated in colonized roots. since aco transcription contributes to regulation of ethylene production, decreasing aco expression reflects in lower amount of ethylene in wheat roots, avoiding ethylene inhibition effects in root elongation of colonized wheat seedlings  <cit> . acc oxidase expression also can be used as an indicator of osmotic stress . pepper plants  inoculated with pgpb  presented a significant decrease in aco expression when compared with the non-inoculated plants under osmotic stress promoted by peg  treatment. the decrease of aco expression might contribute to the relief of osmotic stress by these pgpb  <cit> . a decrease in endogenous ethylene levels also plays a role in bacterial-induced salinity tolerance  <cit> .

plants growing under saline conditions produce flavonoid sulfates, which might be implicated in detoxification of active hydroxyl groups and in the sequestering of sulfates groups  <cit> . even though wheat seedlings were not under a typical saline stress condition, the gene that encodes a flavonol 3-sulfotransferase, which catalyzes flavonoid sulfation, was down-regulated in colonized roots, suggesting that colonized plants are more resistant to saline stress. taken together, these results suggest that a. brasilense colonization besides promoting enhancement of the root system may play a role in plant stress tolerance, an effect previously observed in other studies  .figure  <dig> 
proposed effects of

inoculation.




improvement of nutrient up-take in inoculated wheat roots
in addition to several reports of increases in root biomass promoted by azospirillum inoculation  <cit> , here we present evidence that a. brasilense colonization improve nutrient acquisition by not only increasing the root surface area, but also by regulating the expression of nutrient transporters . supporting this hypothesis, our results suggest: 1) enhancement of root surface area followed by increased dna synthesis in root cells and up-regulation of ests encoding cell cycle regulators; 2) repression of aco expression that might reflect in lower ethylene production; and 3) up-regulation of transporters ranging from metal- to oligopeptides-transporters.

additionally, est encoding proteins related to anthocyanin biosynthesis, which is usually repressed by increased amount of nitrogen content  <cit> , were down-regulated in cwr-libraries suggesting higher amount of nitrogen content in the colonized plants. finally, the up-regulation of wheat glutamine synthetase and of a. brasilense nitrogenase strongly suggests that the pgpb colonization improves nitrogen nutrition of wheat plants.

CONCLUSIONS
simultaneous rna-seq of plant roots colonized by a. brasilense showed a remarkable change in expression of plant genes involved in transport activity, reflected in a direct effect on the up-take of nutrients, such as nitrogen. additionally, genes of categories related to dna replication and cell division were also responsive to the presence of the bacteria. these changes in gene expression are likely correlated with improvement in growth of wheat seedling colonized by a. brasilense under axenic conditions. the results reinforce the use of pgpb as an alternative to improve nutrient acquisition in important crops such as wheat. finally, genetic manipulation of the differentially expressed wheat genes may lead to the development of new cultivars with improved productivity traits.
