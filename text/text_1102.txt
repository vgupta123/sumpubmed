BACKGROUND
bacteria from the genus xanthomonas are major phytopathogens of a wide variety of plants and represent species of great agricultural and economic importance  <cit> . in general, xanthomonas species have restricted host ranges, each only specializing in the infection of a small number of plant species  <cit> . xanthomonas citri pv. citri  is a pathogenic bacterium that infects citrus plants and is the global cause of asiatic citrus canker  <cit> , resulting in significant crop losses around the world and giving x. citri pv. citri the status of a quarantine organism in some countries that do not face it  <cit> . x. citri pv. citri invades citrus plants through the stomata or wounds and attacks the plant cells with a range of different virulence factor proteins transported out of the bacterial cell by the type ii-type vi secretion systems  <cit> . both the pathogen and its host species originate from asia  <cit> .

strains of xanthomonas citri pv. citri were subdivided into different pathotypes based on their host specificity and the defense response to infection by different citrus host species. to date there have been three main groups identified, designated a, a* and aw pathotypes  <cit> . pathotype a has the broadest host range, infecting most citrus species and related genera and is the most agriculturally important of the pathotypes. conversely, a* and aw have very limited host ranges and have only been isolated from key lime  and alemow . the a* strains were isolated from key lime in several countries in asia, and were recognized as a distinct pathotype from the a strains due to their inability to develop canker lesions on grapefruit  <cit> . the aw pathotype differ from the a* strains in their ability to elicit a hypersensitive response  on grapefruit and sweet orange  <cit> . the avrgf <dig>  gene that hasn’t yet been found in the other pathotypes than aw is at least partly responsible for hr in grapefruit and sweet orange . deletion reduces the hr symptoms in grapefruit and sweet orange, but doesn’t increase the host range of the strain indicating a more complex determination of host range. transconjugation of avrgf <dig> or its homolog avrgf <dig> into a strains elicits a hr in grapefruit, indicating that it can act as a host range restriction factor, even if it isn’t the primary cause of aw host range restriction  <cit> .

identifying the underlying causes for the different host ranges of the three closely related x. citri pv. citri pathotypes may provide new targets to aid in the prevention of bacterial diseases and possibly inform new strategies to treat and manage citrus canker outbreaks. most notably, it would also allow the improvement of our understanding of how bacterial pathogens evolve in terms of host range variations when coevolving with their host in agrosystems, and more generally on plant bacterial disease emergence  <cit> . here we use ngs data from  <dig> strains of x. citri pv. citri representing the three pathotypes and selected on the basis of our current knowledge of the bacterium’s genetic diversity as well as one outgroup strain of x. citri pv. bilvae , to construct a phylogeny using aligned non-recombinant genomic regions from all strains. based on this phylogeny, we identify pathotype-specific genomic changes from the level of single base changes to the level of multi-gene islands and regions of recombination.

contig mapping
the results of the assembled contig-mapping to the strain iapar  <dig> reference are shown in table  <dig>  between  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the sequenced data was mapped to strain iapar  <dig> depending on the strain, with an average of  <dig>  %. the regions from each strain that were not mapped to strain iapar  <dig> were not included in the comparative analysis because the exact relationships between homologous regions from these unmapped regions are difficult to define. while it was possible to map some contigs from each strain onto the two plasmids from iapar  <dig>  there were no regions from the resulting alignment that were represented in all of the strain genomes or that were pathotype-specific.

recombination
regions inferred to have undergone recombination across the x. citri pv. citri clade and the corresponding ranges of genes in strain iapar  <dig> are shown in table  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  in total  <dig> regions were identified as likely being recombinant. of these, seven events are inferred to have occurred on branches leading to the different pathotypes, five that are unique to the aw pathotype and two that are unique to the a* pathotype. the five aw-specific recombination regions cover  <dig> genes in strain iapar  <dig> , many of which were conferred aw-specific residues by the horizontal transfer. in general, the level of aw-specific residues is much higher in genes in these regions than in the rest of the genome with an average of  <dig>  nonsynonymous snps per gene compared to a genome average in aw strains of  <dig>  per gene . of the five events in the aw pathotype, four of them appear to originate from x. citri pv. bilvae or a closely related bacterium. of particular interest, an a*-specific recombination event and an aw-specific recombination event coincide within the xopad gene, a type iii effector. the effect of the different recombination events is that xopad differs at many sites in a pathotype specific manner across all three pathotypes .table  <dig> regions of detected recombination in the whole genome alignment of all strains

phylogeny
the phylogeny inferred from the whole genome alignment is shown in fig.  <dig>  each pathotype in the phylogeny resolves into monophyletic groups, with the a and aw pathotypes sharing a short branch after the divergence of a*. consistent with previous amplified fragment length polymorphism and multi locus variable number of tandem repeat analysis , a* strains formed robust subclusters in relation to their geographic origin  <cit> . our phylogeny confirmed that the indian subcontinent hosts unique a strains, including the ones referred to as dapc  <dig> based on mlva- <dig>  <cit>   and strains isolated in bangladesh , which form distinct subclusters within the a clade. in addition to strains originating from this region, the dapc  <dig> lineage also included strains emerging in mali and senegal   <cit> . the strains jf90- <dig>  lg <dig> and ncppb  <dig>  previously designated as part of the a* pathotype  <cit> , share a well supported branch with the other aw strains, and are assigned as aw in our work for this reason in conjunction with containing the gene island containing avrgf <dig>  previously identified specifically in an aw strain  <cit> . a second phylogeny constructed with recombination as part of the alignment and a reduced distribution of a strains similar to that of zhang et al.  <cit>  revealed the same pathotype branching structure as in this publication with the a* and aw strains that share a branch . support for the pathotype-specific branches is very strong in both the recombination-containing and recombination-free phylogenies despite their differing topologies.fig.  <dig> phylogeny reconstructed from the whole genome alignment with removed regions of recombination. the pathotypes are colored blue , mauve  and orange  and the shared branch ancestral to a and aw is colored yelow. the number of inferred nonsynonymous , synonymous , intergenic  and nonsense  snps, gene gains and losses and gene islands are marked along each branch. the outgroup branch has been shortened  and is not to scale, to facilitate legibility of the figure



presence/absence analysis
we used orthologs identified by blast best reciprocal hits   in order to estimate the core-genome, pan-genome and number of singletons in our dataset, as well as to catalog gene presence and absence between pathotypes that are differentially present or absent in all strains of a pathotype. genes related to is elements and phages were excluded from the analysis due to their similarity, which makes orthology difficult to assign. we estimate that there are  <dig> genes in the core-genome,  <dig>  genes in the pan-genome and  <dig> singletons spread across the  <dig> x. citri pv. citri strains. we identified four gene islands that are differentially present or absent between the pathotypes . several genes previously identified as playing roles in pathogenicity or biofilm formation are found on these islands including the aw-specific avrgf <dig> gene on island  <dig> , and xrva, mobl, xac <dig>  xac <dig> and xac <dig> on island  <dig> that are absent from a*. islands 2– <dig> all contain at least one gene that is usually plasmid-associated indicating their probable origin as plasmidic.table  <dig> gene islands differentially present or absent across pathotypes

all of the islands except the aw-specific island  <dig> containing avrgf <dig> coincide with island locations identified in strain iapar  <dig> with islandviewer  <cit> . island  <dig> partially coincides with an aw-specific recombination event of unknown origin, while island  <dig> and island  <dig> fully overlap aw-specific recombination events originating from x. citri pv. bilvae. island  <dig> fully overlaps an a*-specific recombination region of unknown origin. apart from these islands and several likely pseudogene fragments , we did not identify any genes that were exclusively present or absent in a given pathotype.

ancestral character estimation
using ancestral character estimation, a total of  <dig> snps were mapped onto the four branches leading to the three pathotypes, of which  <dig> are genic and  <dig> are intergenic based on the annotation of strain iapar  <dig> . there are  <dig> nonsynonymous mutations and  <dig> synonymous mutations as well as nonsense mutations in three a and three a* genes.

among the nonsynonymous snps, there are many in genes with previously identified putative roles related to pathogenicity or biofilm formation in various xanthomonas species. specific to the a pathotype, these include genes related to secretion systems or effectors: avrbs <dig>  xopn, xopl, hrpe, hrcu, lama ; genes related to eps production and biofilm formation or regulated by dsf: rpfa, rpfb, guml, gumd, cyoc, feca ; and iron transport: fhua  <cit> . on the a* branch are nonsynonymous snp-containing genes related to secretion systems or effectors: hrpb <dig>  hrpxct, xopx, xopk, xopl, xcsg, xcsn, sece ; biofilm formation: tsr and guml ; and iron transport: fhua  <cit> . aw-specific nonsynonymous-snp containing genes include genes related to secretion systems or effectors: xopp, xopl, hpab  <cit> ; genes related to eps production and biofilm formation: gumm, gumd, tsr , organic hydroperoxide resistance gene osmc  <cit> , a xylanase xynb  <cit>  and xac <dig>  a mutant of which is biofilm defective  <cit> . finally, on the shared a/aw branch, there are nonsynonymous mutations in rpfb, and the adhesion-associated protein yaph  <cit> .

pseudogenes, frameshifts and truncations
pseudogenes, frameshifts and truncations were identified by the complementary approaches of the protein length analysis, ancestral character estimation and the presence/absence analysis . there are eight identified putative pseudogenes in pathotype a strains,  <dig> in a* strains and five in aw strains. several of the putative pseudogenes are reported to have roles in defence: the catalase catb  <cit>  and permease rard  <cit>  involved in drug resistance in the a strains and yojm  <cit> , a superoxide dismutase-like gene in the aw strains. there are also putative pseudogenes in the a* strains that are involved in pathogenicity or biofilm formation: rpfb , a regulator of pathogenicity factors, a ggdef domain-containing protein-encoding gene  <cit>  and the type iii effectors xopn and xopl  <cit> .table  <dig> pathotype-specific putative pseudogenes, genic frameshifts and truncations

cog enrichment analysis
cog categories enriched in the nonsynonymous snp, missing and recombination gene sets are shown in additional file  <dig>  the majority of cogs enriched in the gene sets appear to be involved in the transport and metabolism of various compounds. the gene set with the most enriched cogs are the missing genes from a*, which has  <dig> enriched cogs. both a* and awmissing gene sets are enriched for cogs involved in defense mechanisms, while all the missing genes that are cog-enriched in a-strains are involved in compound transport and metabolism. the most significantly enriched category in a* missing genes is transcription, involving three different transcriptional regulator genes, two of which reside in island  <dig>  amongst the nonsynonymous snp gene sets, the a/aw branch has the most enriched cogs that are mostly involved in transport and metabolism . despite having the most branch-specific nonsynonymous snps, the only enriched category for a*-specific snp genes is for genes that have not been assigned a cog. in pathotype a, the most significantly enriched cog in the snp gene set is involved in defense mechanisms, and includes the transport protein gene acrd and the multidrug efflux protein genes mexb and smeb. energy production and conversion processes are also over-represented by avrbs <dig> and glpq, genes that both contain a glycerophosphoinositol phosphodiesterase  domain  <cit> . the shared a/aw branch, has several enriched cogs. in the recombinant regions in aw, cogs for intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport and inorganic ion transport and metabolism are enriched due to the presence of the tata/tatb translocation system and two modular superoxide dismutase genes respectively.

discussion
the focus of our study is to trace the evolutionary events that led to the emergence of three pathotypes of x. citri pv. citri that may explain differences in host range and virulence between them. as each pathotype is defined by its host-range or hr on different hosts, we searched for the genomic differences that appear to be entirely present or entirely absent from a pathotype ranging from the level of single base changes to multi-gene islands . these events were placed into their evolutionary context by a phylogenetic reconstruction of all strains from non-recombinant regions of the multiple genome alignment.

detection and removal of recombinant sequences allows the construction of a phylogeny that theoretically represents the true relationship of the vertically inherited genome portions of the strains . the phylogeny shows monophyletic groups for each pathotype and suggests that the aw and a pathotypes share a branch to the exclusion of the a* pathotype. the topology agrees with the overall structure of previous aflp  <cit>  and mlva  <cit>  phylogenies of the x. citri pv. citri group. some strains studied by escalon et al.  <cit>  assigned to a*  are probably in fact aw strains based on the molecular phylogeny presented here and consistent with the hypersensitive response in grapefruit and sweet orange due to the presence of avrgf <dig>  <cit> . a recent publication  <cit>  reconstructed a tree with a different branching order of the three pathotypes to that found in our reconstruction. in the published phylogeny, the aw and a* pathotypes clade together to the exclusion of a strains. by reconstructing the relationship between the pathotypes both with  and without regions of recombination , we show that the topology from this publication is influenced by regions of recombination which were not removed before the reconstruction of the phylogeny, making it most likely incorrect. because regions of recombination violate the core assumption of common evolutionary history for all of the sites in an alignment, it is important to control for their presence when reconstructing phylogenies  <cit> . additionally, as the tests of positive selection used in the publication rely on a correct tree topology, the major result of this publication – that positive selection is the main driving force behind the evolution of citrus canker-causing xanthomonas species – is therefore uncertain.

the only widely distributed common host species for all of the x. citri pv. citri pathotypes and the outgroup x. citri pv. bilvae is key lime . based on our phylogeny, any differences in pathogenicity and host range between the a and aw pathotypes should be isolated to events occurring on either or both of the branches leading to the two groups. apart from a hypersensitive response in grapefruit and sweet orange  <cit> , which can largely be explained by the presence of avrgf <dig>  <cit> , the host range and specificity of aw is narrow and similar to that of a*  <cit> , suggesting that the larger host range of the a group has developed along the branch leading to the a pathotype alone and that the ancestor of the a and aw pathotypes had a host range and virulence similar to the aw and a* groups. less parsimonious scenarios cannot be ruled out, e.g. that aw  evolved a restricted host range from an ancestor that had a broad host range.

the four gene island regions that show differential presence and absense of genes across the pathotypes are all coincident with detected regions of pathotype-specific recombination, which suggests that these islands have been gained in certain pathotypes rather than lost in pathotypes where they are absent. in addition, the fact that all but the island containing the avrgf <dig> gene contain genes that are normally associated with plasmids  indicates a likely xenologous plasmid origin. interestingly, gene islands were also regions that contained missing genes between pathotypes. except for putative pseudogenes  all of the genes whose presence or absence is different between pathotypes are associated with regions of recombination or islands that are mostly of probable plasmid origin.

although it might be expected that genes contained on these islands could define host range, there are no genes that are present or absent exclusively in a strains. genes differentially present between the a and aw pathotypes are found on island  <dig> and island  <dig> , including avrgf <dig>  although avrgf <dig> deletion does not confer a-like host range to aw strains, indicating that the presence or absence of other factors is also necessary to explain differing host ranges  <cit> , expression of avrgf <dig> or its homolog avrgf <dig> in a strains does illicit a hr in grapefruit  <cit> . furthermore, in the case of both of these islands, a and a* strains share the same presence and absence patterns, indicating that they are likely not host range determining. despite containing genes involved in virulence and biofilm formation   <cit> , island  <dig> is also unlikely to be a key factor in host range because it is present in a and aw strains. in any case, the presence and absence differences restricted to gene islands that tend to coincide with zones of detected recombination outline the large role of horizontal transfer, plasmid insertion and recombination in the genomic evolution of x. citri pv. citri pathotypes.

in contrast to a recent analysis of x. citri pv. citri strains  <cit>  we did not identify any additional pathotype-specific genes in the a strains. to validate our results, we checked the genes that differ between that analysis and our results . overall the majority of differences are due to fragments of existing genes that appear to have been split or pseudogenized, genes that are in fact found in other pathotypes, or genes found restricted to a pathotype, but not in all member strains.

a gene region identified in a-strains  <cit>  that is involved in lps biosynthesis is a gene island that corresponds to a region of detected recombination  in our data. however, the distribution is restricted to  <dig> of the  <dig> a-strains meaning that while it may have a large effect on biofilm formation and o-antigen composition in these strains as demonstrated by sds-polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis  <cit> , it is not the key factor to different host ranges between the pathotypes as a whole.

as well as gene islands and regions of recombination, host range differences may also be caused by pseudogenization. however, caution is needed when inferring pseudogenes from frameshifts or stop codons, as ribosomal frameshifting and transcriptional realignment can lead to fully-functional transcripts and proteins despite apparent non-functional coding sequences  <cit> .

in the a pathotype, the only putative pseudogene known to be involved in virulence, is catb, a putative monofunctional catalase that may be involved in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species produced by plants during their defense processes  <cit> . an ez::tn transposon insertion in catb in x. campestris pv. campestris reduces virulence of the bacterium on its host plant  <cit> . supporting its pseudogenic nature in strain iapar  <dig>  tondo et al.  <cit>  could not detect catb product in x. citri pv. citri using rt-pcr.

although several potential pseudogenes associated with infection are found in a* strains, e.g. rpfb, xopl, xopn and a ggdef family protein , these are unlikely to be the root cause of host range differences between the pathotypes given the phylogeny and their distribution across the different pathotypes, however they may still cause differences in virulence between the pathotypes.

the pathotypes also differ by mutations and recombination events that have overwritten homologous native sequence. a large number of the molecular differences between a and aw strains comes from the five aw-specific recombination events  spanning  <dig> genes in strain iapar  <dig> . many of the genes contain one or more aw-specific nonsynonymous substitution and in several cases also contain frameshifts, truncations and indels that are specific to aw strains. interestingly, four out of the five detected pathotype-specific recombination events in aw appear to originate from x. citri pv. bilvae, as well as three other detected events, indicating a physical interaction must have occurred at some time in the past, most likely in india and probably on the common lime host. x. citri pv. bilvae has thus played a large role in the genomic evolution of the x. citri complex, specifically in the aw pathotype.

notably, one of the regions of aw recombination contains xopad, a type iii effector that has previously been noted by escalon et al.  <cit> , as being the likely subject of recombination. interestingly, the region containing xopad appears to have undergone pathotype-specific recombination in both aw and a* pathotypes, meaning that there are pathotype-specific versions in all three pathotypes. the a* and aw versions contain multiple pathotype-specific amino acid residues . furthermore, in the aw strains  a transposase from an isxac <dig> element interrupts the xopad gene at the 3′ end  <cit> . jalan et al.  <cit>  found that xopad is upregulated in xcaw <dig> compared to strain iapar  <dig>  suggesting that the is interruption may not have completely pseudogenized this gene in aw, although the truncation could potentially affect its function where it is present. deletion of xopad in a strains does not appear to affect its pathogenicity on different citrus hosts in strain iapar  <dig>  <cit> , but as it is a type iii effector and has unique versions of the gene in each pathotype it remains a good candidate for future study of pathotype-specific host range.

figure  <dig> summarizes our results focusing on genes coding for factors that differ between pathotypes in terms of snps, pseudogeneization or presence/absence and are potentially involved in host specialization, i.e. related to functions that allow virulence on a plant species but not on another or that differentiate strains that are or are not pathogenic on a given species. for example a bacterial strain would not be pathogenic if: it cannot survive on the plant surface ; it cannot detect and/or swim to openings ; it cannot inhibit and/or evade plant defenses , pathogen/microbe associated molecular patterns, detoxification, iron mobilization, molecular targets of defense mechanisms etc.); it cannot cause symptoms to disrupt plant tissues to liberate nutriments and/or exit ; it cannot uptake and/or use nutriments . more generally deficient sensing, signal transduction or regulation may be involved in the inability to cause disease.fig.  <dig> schematic representation of a selection of genes involved in pathogenicity or fitness functions that are involved in pathotype specific events. events are snps , pseudogenization , or presence in genomic islands . events marked with an asterisk are present in regions of detected recombination



in our dataset, the low level of polymorphism along any given branch of the tree  does not provide enough power to estimate selective constraints accurately in a pathotype-specific manner  <cit> . several genes contain more than one nonsynonymous mutation per pathotype or across pathotypes, making them interesting candidates as potential targets of selection.

genes that are already known to play a role in pathogenicity are also prime candidates for the evolution of host range, especially genes that have differences in an a-specific manner. these include nonsynonymous snp-containing genes involved in secretion systems, hrpe, hrcu, avrbs <dig>  xopn, xopl and lama; genes involved in regulation of pathogenicity factors, rpfa and rpfb; genes involved in biofilm formation and motility related to diffusable signal factor , eps and lps, guml, gumd and flil as well as an array of genes involved in uptake and transport of various compounds including the iron transporters feca and fhua. the rpf  genes are involved in cell-cell signalling via diffusable signal factor and in the regulation of the synthesis, polymerization and secretion of extracellular enzymes and polysaccharides  . notably, rpfb has two a-specific nonsynonymous substitutions as well as an a/aw nonsynonymous substitution and is a putative pseudogene in the a* strains. mutation of rpfb leads to loss or severe reduction of dsf activity  in x. campestris pv. campestris  <cit> . furthermore, there are at least six a-specific nonsynonymous snp-containing genes  that are reportedly regulated by dsf in x. campestris pv. campestris and x. oryzae pv. oryzae  <cit> . as they are important in cell-cell signalling as well as the regulation of pathogenicity factors and biofilm formation , the rpf genes and their regulation targets that contain snps are good candidate genes to explain the differentiation of the pathotypes in terms of their virulence and host range.

the significant enrichment of mutated, missing  or recombined genes in functional categories may also indicate possible selection acting on various bacterial systems. interestingly in a strains, the enriched missing gene functions are all involved in the transport and metabolism of various compounds . while aw and a* missing genes are also enriched for transport and metabolism functions, both pathotypes are also depleted for genes involved in defense mechanisms , and a* is depleted for genes involved in transcription , posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones , energy production and conversion , replication, recombination and repair  and cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis . furthermore the a strains are enriched for genes containing snps that are involved in defense mechanisms , energy production and conversion  and intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport , while neither aw nor a* are enriched for any functions for genes containing snps. multidrug efflux systems may be important in the pathogenicity of the bacteria, potentially by protecting the bacteria against plant antimicrobials released as a defense response  <cit> . indeed, knockout of the mexb gene along with associated mexa and oprm genes in pseudomonas syringae causes a major reduction in the bacterial populations in planta  <cit> . furthermore, it has been suggested that multidrug efflux pumps may play a role in exporting quorum sensing molecules out of the cell as well as flagellar motility which is associated with biofilm formation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this work we present a comparative genomics analysis using one previously sequenced strain and the draft genome sequences of  <dig> strains of x. citri pv. citri, and one x. citri pv. bilvae strain as an outgroup. each of the three pathotypes of x. citri pv. citri are monophyletic, and we found multiple differences between the genomes of three pathotypes of x. citri pv. citri ranging from differences in gene content, putative pseudogenization, and nonsynonymous mutations in several genes known to be involved in various aspects of pathogenicity. we find that there is extremely little variation in gene-content at the pathotype level: apart from potential pseudogenes all of the detected differences in gene content are linked to gene islands and regions of recombination, indicating that hgt and recombination have been major factors in the gene content evolution of x. citri pv. citri pathotypes in terms of both the gain and the loss of gene content and mutations. few content differences exist between a and aw strains despite aw strains having a narrow host range similar to that of a*.

our analysis of recombination detected multiple recombination events across the genomes, with seven detected events that are specifically present only in all members of a pathotype. five of the pathotype-specific events are in aw strains, and two are in a*. four of the aw-specific recombination events are inferred to originate from a bacterium related to x. citri pv. bilvae due to high sequence similarity, suggesting an interaction between the aw strain ancestor and this x. citri pv. bilvae-like strain, probably in a lime host. interestingly, our analyses demonstrated that due to two recombination events, the xopad gene displays pathotype-specific versions in all three pathotypes, making it a good candidate for further study of the host range or pathogenicity differences between the pathotypes. there are also several other notable differences of potential importance between the pathotypes that may explain differences in host range and pathogenicity, notably rpfa and rpfb genes that are involved in regulating pathogenicity factors and biofilm formation through dsf production. these genes and several of their targets contain multiple snps along different pathotype branches. we also identify several cogs that are either significantly enriched or depleted for the individual pathotypes and may suggest selection acting on certain functions in the pathotypes.

overall, our study provides insights into the genomic evolution of the pathotypes of x. citri pv. citri and provides candidates for further study into their different host ranges and virulence.
