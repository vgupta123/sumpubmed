BACKGROUND
rhesus macaque models of human genetic disease would be very useful for translational research. although mouse "knockouts" have provided much basic information regarding the effects of gene disruption, for some genes, null mutations in the mouse ortholog of a human disease gene does not result in a phenotype that completely matches the human disease. thus, there are either no or limited animal models for many human genetic diseases  <cit> . furthermore, non-human primates are often preferred for translational research due to close similarities to humans in behavior, anatomy, physiology, and genetics  <cit> .

currently, the vast majority of genetic models of human disease in mammals have utilized the mouse as an experimental animal  <cit> . this is due to the relative ease with which genetically modified animals, including loss-of-function and knock-in mutations, can be produced by transfecting es cells and creating chimeric animals with germline changes  <cit> . unfortunately, although es cells have been derived from primates including rhesus macaques, they have not been shown to contribute to chimeras.

null mutant sheep, goats, pigs and cattle have been produced using an alternative approach: gene targeting in somatic cells followed by nuclear transfer to enucleated oocytes   <cit> . gene targeting in human fibroblasts has also been achieved  <cit> . because many different experimental protocols have been applied to achieve gene targeting in mammalian fibroblasts, we wished to determine which protocols would support efficient gene targeting in rhesus macaque fibroblasts as a first step in creating null mutant rhesus macaques using scnt.

the hprt gene was the first gene disrupted in the mouse  <cit> . there were several reasons for this, including the fact that mutations in the human ortholog results in a severe neurodevelopmental disorder known as lesch-nyhans disease, and the fact that mouse hprt null es cells could be selected for by adding compounds that would kill any cells expressing the hprt protein  <cit> . moreover, hprt is located on the x chromosome; therefore disruption of only one copy of the gene in male xy cells is sufficient to generate a phenotype. unfortunately, although mice with hprt null mutations did exhibit a 50% loss of dopamine in the striatum  <cit> , they did not exhibit the same spontaneous behavioral abnormalities seen in humans with lesch-nyhans disease  <cit> . we chose to target the hprt gene in male rhesus macaque cells for three reasons: we could select for null mutant cells in culture; it would only be necessary to disrupt one allele to observe a phenotype; and because an animal model with the same behavioral deficits seen in lesch-nyhan's disease does not currently exist.

several different techniques, and combinations of techniques, were evaluated before we determined a set of protocols that resulted in efficient production of gene targeted fibroblasts in rhesus macaques. in this report, we describe what did and did not work for us. one of the important keys to our success was the use of cell cycle synchronization prior to transfection and the inclusion of a sv <dig> enhancer in the targeting construct  <cit> .

RESULTS
htert transfection of fibroblasts
in preliminary studies with rhesus fibroblasts, we had difficulty maintaining these cells in culture long enough to support gene targeting procedures due to senescence. htert transfection has been shown to prevent senescence in rhesus fibroblasts  <cit> . to extend the time that fibroblasts could be cultured, we electroporated adult male rhesus macaque fibroblasts with a construct containing a human telomerase reverse transcriptase  expression cassette . after g <dig> selection, cells were passaged continuously until after the empty vector control fibroblasts reached senescence. control fibroblasts entered senescence after  <dig> population doublings  whereas the htert-transfected cells showed no change in growth rate, no evidence of senescence, and were still dividing after more than  <dig> weeks .

to verify that the htert-transfected fibroblasts carried integrated copies of the transfected htert gene, genomic dna was extracted and pcr analysis was performed to screen for the presence of the construct . the pcr assay demonstrated that htert was likely stably integrated in the rhesus fibroblast genomic dna . to determine if htert was expressed in the rhesus fibroblasts, rna was extracted from neor cells and reverse transcribed to cdna. two sets of primers were used. one set of primers amplified a  <dig> bp fragment from the coding region. the other set of primers amplified a  <dig> bp fragment which included a portion of the tert 3' utr not included in the construct. this made it possible to use a reverse primer that would anneal to wild type tert transcript but not transcript from the construct .

we were able to further test whether the tert expressed in the transfected rhesus macaque fibroblasts originated from the introduced construct or the endogenous gene by sequencing the rt-pcr product. this was possible because pci-neo-htert contains the human tert cds, which differs from rhesus macaque tert in  <dig> positions of the  <dig> bp coding amplicon described above. sequencing of this amplicon indicated that the tert expressed in the transfected rhesus macaque fibroblasts was derived from pci-neo-htert, not the endogenous tert gene.

a second population of htert-transfected fibroblasts was also made, which we maintained under selection for  <dig> weeks. in the  <dig> gene targeting experiments represented in table  <dig>  either the first  or the second  population of htert-transfected fibroblasts were used. in general, pci-neo-htert transfected fibroblasts generated a greater average number of puror colonies than wild type fibroblasts after being electroporated with the targeting construct . after s-phase synchronization/electroporation , pci-neo-htert transfected fibroblasts returned to a proliferative state sooner than wild type fibroblasts. a total of  <dig> targeting experiments were performed with the htert-transfected fibroblasts, which yielded  <dig> colonies displaying the hprt null phenotype . an attempt to target wild type fibroblasts was unsuccessful .

transfection strategies
to compare transfection methods, rhesus macaque fetal fibroblast cells were transfected with linearized pcmv-sport-β-gal  using three commercially available cationic lipids: lipofectamine ; superfect ; and fugene <dig> . the results of these chemotransfection methods were compared with electroporation. with lipofectamine, only one β-gal positive cell out of  <dig>  was seen  <dig> days after transfection. with superfect, no β-gal expressing cells were observed  <dig> days after transfection. fugene <dig> transfection resulted in .02% β-gal positive cells  <dig> days after transfection. fugene <dig> was also less toxic to cells. in contrast, electroporation resulted in  <dig> – 5% of the transfected cells expressing β-gal after  <dig> days. these results, and a report by zwaka and thomson  <cit>  indicating that the chemical methods of transfection were not effective for gene targeting in human es cells, prompted us to focus on electroporation for our gene targeting experiments.

to achieve gene targeting in adult rhesus macaque fibroblasts, several different strategies for construct design were implemented. two promoterless constructs were engineered, one with a neomycin resistance  selection cassette and the other with a puromycin resistance  selection cassette. both contained an internal ribosomal entry site . in targeting experiments utilizing these constructs, no apparent neor or puror colonies were observed . electroporation of fibroblasts with a targeting construct containing a phosphoglycerate kinase  promoter and the neomycin cassette resulted in numerous g <dig> colonies. however, none were resistant to 6tg, indicating that the hprt gene had not been targeted .

our failure to achieve gene targeting in rhesus macaque fibroblasts using conventional approaches prompted us to consider alternative methods. mir and piedrahita  <cit>  discussed the difficulties in obtaining gene targeting in somatic cells and reported that two techniques, thymidine block of cell cycling and the inclusion of a sv <dig> enhancer sequence in a vector, dramatically improved gene targeting in somatic cells. this motivated us to test these techniques with our pci-neo-htert transfected rhesus fibroblasts.

s-phase synchronization
we performed a cell cycle analysis of adult rhesus macaque fibroblasts. cells were treated with thymidine for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours and harvested for cell cycle analysis. thymidine treatment for  <dig> hours resulted in the highest number of cells in s-phase  .

to test the hypothesis that s-phase arrested rhesus macaque fibroblasts would reduce random integration of the targeting construct, we synchronized cells with thymidine treatment and then transfected them with a targeting construct containing the neomycin resistance gene driven by the pgk promoter. this hypothesis was confirmed as we observed a  <dig> fold reduction in the rate of random integration of the targeting construct after s-phase synchronization as compared to non-synchronized cells. however, no targeted events occurred in either experiment .

the targeting vector used in this experiment did not contain the sv <dig> enhancer.

targeting construct with sv  <dig> enhancer element
an hprt targeting construct with an sv <dig> nuclear localizing dna was created . the inclusion of the sv <dig> nuclear localizing dna was previously reported to increase gene targeting in bovine fibroblasts, especially when used in conjunction with s-phase synchronization  <cit> . this construct contained a total of  <dig>  kb of homology to the hprt locus,  <dig>  kb at the short arm and  <dig>  kb at the long arm. the hprt sequence was isogenic with the fibroblasts used for targeting. the selection cassette included the puromycin resistance gene driven by the pgk promoter.

transfection and selection
we utilized the mir and piedrahita  <cit>  recommendation of  <dig> pulses of electroporation at  <dig> v, which represented a significant change from our normal electroporation parameters. after electroporation, cells that were thymidine blocked did not divide for four days; therefore, puromycin selection was not initiated until  <dig> days after electroporation. the specific sequence and timing of selection was crucial in identifying hprt-null  fibroblasts. critical parameters that were identified by dr. piedrahita  included selection on  <dig> well plates at  <dig>  cells per well  and the use of puromycin selection. selection for hprt null mutant cells was more effective when 8ag selection preceded 6tg selection.

generation of hprt null mutant rhesus macaque fibroblasts
the combination of cell synchronization and the electroporation of pci-neo-htert transfected fibroblasts with a targeting construct containing the sv <dig> enhancer resulted in targeting of the hprt locus in rhesus macaque fibroblasts . a total of  <dig> targeting experiments were performed;  <dig> colonies had the hprt null phenotype.

in order to screen for targeted clones, primers were designed that produced an amplicon if the gene was not targeted and did not produce an amplicon if the gene was targeted . nineteen of these colonies were verified by pcr to be targeted . of the remaining  <dig> colonies, one was further analyzed and found to contain an insertion of exons  <dig> and  <dig> from the targeting construct into the hprt locus, without replacement, causing a frameshift that resulted in a stop codon at exon  <dig> 

pcr analysis of genomic dna demonstrated the persistence of the pci-neo-htert in hprt targeted clones generated in experiments  <dig> and  <dig> . rt-pcr demonstrated tert expression in the hprt null clones from experiments  <dig> and  <dig> , but not experiment  <dig> 

cytogenetic analysis indicated that the hprt null clone from experiment  <dig> had an abnormal karyotype involving a balanced translocation of chromosome  <dig> . however, targeted clones from experiments  <dig> and  <dig>  were karyotypically normal.

an attempt to target wild type fibroblasts was unsuccessful.

discussion
when deciding how to disrupt a gene in a mammalian somatic cell, there are a number of choices the investigator must make. which method of transfection should be used? which type of vector design and culture conditions should be chosen to enrich for targeted cells? an additional issue which must be addressed for rhesus macaques is: how to obtain a sufficient supply of fibroblasts to successfully target a gene given that many of the transfected cells will become senescent prior to completion of selection procedures. we found that identifying the right combination of approaches to successfully disrupt the hprt gene in fibroblasts in rhesus macaques to be quite challenging.

there are three main approaches to transfecting cells for gene targeting: chemical, electroporation and viral. the success rate of these different approaches has varied greatly depending on the technique and in which lab the targeting occurred. for example, efficient gene targeting has been reported with chemical transfection methods in fibroblasts from sheep  <cit>  and pigs  <cit> . electroporation has been used to introduce targeting constructs into fibroblasts from humans  <cit> , sheep  <cit> , pigs  <cit>  and cows  <cit> . adeno-associated vectors have been used for gene targeting in human  <cit>  and cow  <cit>  somatic cells.

although we have not systematically tested all possible methods of gene targeting in rhesus macaques, we did examine a number of different methods. we initially attempted gene targeting in rhesus macaque fibroblasts using chemical methods. these attempts were unsuccessful. others have also reported difficulties with this approach for gene targeting  <cit> . we were able to achieve successful gene targeting with electroporation, but only after utilizing a sv <dig> enhancer in the targeting construct and synchronizing the cell cycle of the fibroblasts.

it is difficult to explain why gene targeting approaches that are reported to be very efficient in one lab are not successful in another. when we applied different methods of gene targeting to rhesus fibroblasts, we followed the recommended protocols for other species. in our hands, only one approach was successful for rhesus macaque fibroblasts  <cit> . it is possible that modifications of the other protocols would have resulted in success in rhesus macaques. although we did not attempt the use of viral vectors for gene targeting in rhesus macaque fibroblasts, their successful use in human and cow somatic cells suggests that this would be a possible method for performing gene targeting in rhesus macaque fibroblasts  <cit> .

fetal fibroblasts are used for gene-targeting in studies for most mammals. for rhesus macaques, obtaining a sufficient supply of such cells for experimentation is difficult. further, in our preliminary experiments with fetal fibroblasts, we found that many of these cells were becoming senescent towards the end of the selection procedures. extending the lifespan of adult fibroblasts by transfecting them with tert, allowed us to obtain a sufficient supply of cells to test various gene targeting methods and avoid senescence. it should be noted that in one of our targeted clones , htert was no longer expressed. it is possible that the construct was never integrated in this clone or that it was silenced at some point during gene targeting selection.

long term culture of somatic cells necessary for gene targeting can result in chromosomal abnormalities. in our study, a chromosomal translocation was observed in one of the targeted clones . however, we were able to produce targeted clones that did not exhibit any detectable karyotypic abnormalities . it is possible that the expression of htert in the pci-neo-htert transfected fibroblasts protected them from undergoing crisis and transformation.

the current studies provide a workable protocol for producing genetically modified non human primate  fibroblasts. however, before these cells can be used for scnt it will be necessary to remove the htert construct. htert expressing sheep fibroblasts have been shown to result in blastocysts at normal rates after scnt, but fetuses did not survive past  <dig> days of development suggesting that the htert may have negatively impacted development at this stage  <cit> . in addition, constitutive expression of htert might complicate phenotype analysis. dysregulation of tert is thought to be a contributing factor in cancer development  <cit> . thus, one approach to creating gene targeted nhps will be to introduce tert into fibroblasts, perform gene targeting, remove the tert vector, confirm euploidy and then perform scnt.

CONCLUSIONS
although many protocols have been published for gene targeting in mammalian somatic cells, most were ineffective in our hands when we attempted to disrupt the hprt gene in rhesus macaque fibroblasts. the critical parameters for successful gene targeting in primary culture of rhesus macaque fibroblasts included htert transfection, cell synchronization in s-phase and inclusion of a sv <dig> enhancer in the targeting construct. the cell lines reported here, with the removal of the tert vector, could be used for the production of null mutant rhesus macaque models of human genetic disease using scnt technology. in addition, given the close evolutionary relationship and biological similarity between rhesus macaques and humans, the protocols described here may prove useful in the genetic engineering of human somatic cells.
