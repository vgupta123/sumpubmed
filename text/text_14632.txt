BACKGROUND
like the chicken, the japanese quail belongs to the phasianidae family  <cit> . in the wild, it is a small migratory bird originating from the far east which was first raised in bird cages in japan and china around the 15th century because of its singing abilities, and later became to be known in japan as a good egg-laying bird for human consumption  <cit> . exported to north america in the 1930s, it started to be used for pilot studies in genetics and physiology and in avian research  <cit> . the japanese quail is now a well established animal model in biology and a bird used for intensive egg and meat production mainly in asia and europe, but also in the middle east and america  <cit> .

until recently, however, only a few linkage groups have been known for the japanese quail, and few genes have been mapped  <cit>  despite the large variety of traits that have been studied in the japanese quail  <cit> . the development of the first microsatellite  <cit>  and aflp  <cit>  panels and of the corresponding maps  <cit>  have made it possible to localize new genes  <cit> , which should further enhance the interest of the quail in biological research and open the way to more comparative genetic studies with chickens. maps can also be used to do a genome-wide search for quantitative trait loci  by locating qtl nearby anonymous aflp or microsatellite markers in segregating backcross or f <dig> populations. moreover, the existence of markers that cross-amplify quail and chicken dna  <cit>  makes it possible to connect both maps and to compare the qtl results for these two species, thereby getting further insight into their evolutionary relationship.

the objective of the present work was to produce the first set of qtl detected in japanese quail for growth, egg production and quality, feed consumption and other traits. for that purpose, an f <dig> experiment was carried out with two quail lines selected for early egg production  <cit>  and for high duration of tonic immobility  <cit> . the microsatellite map  <cit>  used for the detection of qtl in the present work was developed earlier from the same f <dig> individuals.

RESULTS
overall performances
1: ti = tonic immobility at 8– <dig> days of age; bt = rectal temperature at  <dig> weeks of age; bw <dig> = 5-wk body weight; fi = feed intake at  <dig> weeks of age; rfi = residual feed intake at  <dig> weeks of age; ew = egg weight at  <dig> weeks of age; yw = yolk weight; sw = eggshell weight; y/a = ratio of yolk weight over albumen weight; afe = age at first egg; en = number of eggs laid until the age of  <dig> weeks; cl = clutch length; bw <dig> = 70-wk body weight.

qtl analysis
1: cl = clutch length ; bw <dig> = 70-wk body weight ; bw <dig> = 5-wk body weight ; fi = feed intake at  <dig> weeks of age ; ti = tonic immobility at 8– <dig> days of age ; bt = rectal temperature at  <dig> weeks of age; sw = eggshell weight at  <dig> weeks of age ; ew = egg weight ; en = egg number until the age of  <dig> weeks; afe = age at first egg ; rfi = residual feed intake at  <dig> weeks of age .

2: ns = not significant.

out of the  <dig> qtl found to be chromosome-wide significant  on  <dig> of the  <dig> autosomes scanned in this work,  <dig> were genome-wide significant , and  <dig> were genome-wide suggestive . genome-wide significant qtl for early  and late  measures of body weight were only found on cja <dig>  but there was a chromosome-wide significant qtl for bw <dig> on cja <dig> and on cja <dig>  and for bw <dig> on cja <dig>  significant qtl were found for feed intake  on cja <dig> and for fi and residual feed intake  on cja <dig>  genome-wide significant or suggestive qtl for egg production characters were obtained, on cja <dig> for clutch length , and on cja <dig> for total egg number  and age at first egg . there were qtl for eggshell weight  on cja <dig> and cja <dig>  and some evidence for another one on cja <dig>  one genome-wide suggestive qtl was found for tonic immobility  on cja <dig>  and there was marginal evidence of qtl for egg weight  on cja <dig>  and for body temperature  on cja <dig> and cja <dig> 

in most cases, the genetic effect was additive and negative, indicating that the qtl allele with the lowest additive effect originated from line dd. the few exceptions were for qtl on cja <dig> and cja <dig>  among genome-wide suggestive and significant qtl, dominance was only significant for cl and sw. the reduction of the residual variance due to fitting a qtl was moderate and did not exceed  <dig> %.

chromosome cja01
interval mapping results for cja <dig> are shown in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  for all traits, the allele received from the line dd ancestry decreased the additive genotypic value. the qtl for bw <dig>  bw <dig> and fi were found at very close positions, the qtl for ti was obtained in the middle of the interval near the chicken microsatellite adl <dig>  and the other qtl were placed at both ends of the chromosome.

chromosome cja06
interval mapping results for cja <dig> are shown in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  the qtl for en and afe were found in the middle of the chromosome at very close positions. both alleles received from the line dd were favourable for egg production, with a positive additive effect on en and a negative one on afe.

chromosome cja20
interval mapping results for cja <dig> are shown in table  <dig>  in this short linkage group, the qtl for fi and rfi were found at opposite ends but, for both traits, the allele decreasing the additive value was transmitted by the line dd.

imprinting and two-qtl alternative
imprinting  was estimated for genome-wide significant qtl. it was only found to be significant for bw <dig>  and fi , on cja <dig>  with a larger effect  for sire-transmitted alleles. similarly, the two-qtl hypothesis was tested, but there was no evidence for two different qtl located on the same linkage group and acting simultaneously on the same trait.

discussion
method
the line-cross model used for qtl detection assumes that different qtl were fixed in the lines dd and lti  <cit> . this hypothesis could not be checked, but bandsharing  between the two quail origins was low   <cit>  and similar to that between highly divergent poultry lines of broilers and layers  <cit> , suggesting that the departure from the ideal situation of fixation in the parental lines was limited. moreover, the main consequence of starting from outbred f <dig> lines would only be to underestimate the qtl effects  <cit> . this might partly explain the relatively small reduction of residual variance observed  for significant qtl under the full model. using a more general approach with full/half sib models  <cit>  was also possible, but it would have required larger full-sib families  <cit>  in order to accurately estimate the larger number of parameters needed with those models.

qtl effects
the additive effects listed in table  <dig> estimated the differences between line dd and line lti alleles. for body weight and feed consumption qtl, the negative sign of the additive effects indicated that favourable alleles  originated from line dd, in agreement with the results of the zootechnical comparison between the two lines at the f <dig> generation of the present experiment  <cit> . the situation was similar for the qtl found for en  afe  and sw , since line dd was a better laying line but with lower egg  weight. surprisingly, however, the best allele for the very significant qtl found for cl was transmitted by line lti, although its average clutch length was  <dig>  d shorter than that of line dd in the f <dig> generation  <cit> . of course, an inferior line may possess superior alleles as first evidenced in early tomato qtl studies  <cit> . also, this qtl had a larger dominance effect , which could not be forecasted from information on the pure lines. it is also possible, however, that its localisation at one end of the linkage group and its effect were some artefact related to the significant segregation distortion observed at this position. the qtl allele originating from the lti line selected for extreme duration of tonic immobility  <cit>  also increased ti in the f <dig> population. its position on cja <dig> confirmed the result obtained for ti in another f <dig> experiment on the japanese quail carried out to detect stress-related traits using aflp markers  <cit> . to our knowledge, the location of a significant qtl for residual feed intake in layers is the first one in a poultry species. the qtl was located on a microchromosome with few markers, however, and it will need to be confirmed in independent genome scans, but it is already an interesting starting point for further work. finally, it was not surprising that the qtl for bt were only chromosome-wide significant in this medium-sized experiment because body temperature is highly regulated and shows very little variation , but quantitative genetic variation for bt has already been reported in the chicken  <cit> , and confirmation of these qtl would represent a very significant finding.

co-location of qtl
it is likely that the qtl for bw <dig>  bw <dig> and fi, located at  <dig> and  <dig> cm on cja <dig>  represent a single gene. indeed, body weight and feed intake are known to be highly correlated genetically  in poultry  <cit> , and the rank correlation between bw <dig> and fi was  <dig>   in the f <dig>  it is worth noting, however, that the suggestive qtl found for ti on the same chromosome was not placed near any other significant qtl. this observation was in good agreement with the absence of association between ti and all the other traits reported from factorial correspondence analysis of the same f <dig> data  <cit> . therefore, the association between stress susceptibility and production in the quail, if it exists, is not mediated significantly by major genes involved in the determinism of the duration of tonic immobility measured at a young age.

the only other instance of close location of two qtl was for en and afe at  <dig> and  <dig> cm on cja <dig>  but the rank correlation between them was only - <dig>   in the f <dig>  which does not strongly suggest that there might be also a single pleiotropic qtl at this position.

unfortunately, pleiotropy could not be tested with the software presently available.

comparison with chicken qtl
several recent reports of genome-wide scans in the chicken have described qtl for body weight  <cit> , feed intake  <cit> , egg production traits  <cit>  and tonic immobility  <cit> , but none was found for body temperature and residual feed intake in layers. a qtl was found for rfi in broilers on gga <dig>  gga <dig> and gga <dig>  however, but in studies  <cit>  which were focused on some specific chromosomal regions.

significant qtl for body weight in the chicken were only reported repeatedly on gga <dig>  <cit> , homologous to cja <dig>  and on gga <dig>  <cit> . moreover, in two out of the three chicken studies where both bw and fi were measured, qtl were found at the same position for body weight and feed intake on gga <dig>  <cit> , as on cja <dig> in the present work. in the third report  <cit> , despite the varied nature of the traits which were studied, no qtl was found at all on gga <dig>  but qtl which affected bw and ti were detected in the same region of gga <dig>  in our work, however, no qtl was found on cja <dig>  overall, then, the largest chicken and quail chromosomes might contain an important and homologous qtl for growth. regarding qtl for egg production in layers, none were found on gga <dig> which is homologous to cja <dig> on which qtl for en and afe have been detected in this work. but egg production is a complex trait because egg laying evolves with time, and it was only measured over a limited period in the works on the chicken, so the characters were not directly comparable.

the location of a qtl for tonic immobility on two homologous chromosomes in chicken  <cit>  and quail suggests that the duration of tonic immobility, a trait associated to fear response  <cit> , is, at least partly, under a similar genetic determinism in the two species. the associations found between qtl for ti and qtl for growth and egg weight on gga <dig> in the red jungle fowl layer intercross  <cit> , however, contradict the lack of association reported in our quail qtl experiment in the present paper, and reported in previous phenotypic analyses  <cit> .

some parent-of-origin effects were recently reported in the chicken  <cit> . they were detected mainly on gga <dig>  and some were found for qtl for body weight and feed intake, as in the present study. it is rather unlikely that these converging results obtained independently in two species from the family phasianidae were only coincidental. consequently, they should raise some interest in looking further for this type of effect in avian species , and, more generally, for possible imprinting-like mechanisms in birds  <cit> .

possible candidate genes
of course, only chromosomal regions could be detected in this study, but it is interesting to note that in the chicken, the gene for the insulin-like growth factor ia associated with growth  <cit> , and the gene for a receptor of serotonin which might be implicated in behaviour  <cit>  are on gga <dig> , whereas we found a qtl for body weight and one for tonic immobility on the homologous quail chromosome cja <dig>  in the same way, the agouti gene is linked to feed intake  <cit> , and a qtl for feed intake was detected on cja <dig> where an agouti-like locus was mapped in the japanese quail  <cit> . these chromosomal co-locations are only indicative, but they might deserve to be explored further.

CONCLUSIONS
for the first time with the japanese quail, a partial genome scan using microsatellites has revealed genome-wide significant qtl for major production-related traits , and qtl for other traits with wider potential interest  were also detected. few results for traits measured on both the quail and chicken are available, and comparisons between the two species are only at the beginning, but the common co-location  of qtl acting on bw and fi, and of qtl for ti are already indicative of the detailed genetic similarity between the two species that future comparative work should further explore. of course, only chromosomal regions could be detected in this study, but it is interesting to note that in the chicken, the gene for the insulin-like growth factor associated with growth and the gene for the serotonin 1f receptor implicated in behavioral traits are on gga <dig>  whereas a qtl for body weight and one for tonic immobility were found on cja <dig>  in the same way, the agouti gene is linked to feed intake, and a qtl for feed intake was detected on cja <dig> where an agouti-like locus was just mapped in the japanese quail.
