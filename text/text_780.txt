BACKGROUND
the mammalian brain is the most complex organ among all living organisms. this enormous complexity is generated via proliferation and differentiation of multipotent neural stem cells  into multiple cell types. researchers have demonstrated life-long continuous neurogenesis in almost all the mammals, including humans  <cit> . the main neurogenic regions in the adult murine brain are the subgranular zone of dentate gyrus  in the hippocampus and the subependymal zone of lateral ventricles, also called ventricular–subventricular zone  . in the adult brain, the hippocampus is a crucial structure for the formation of certain types of memory, such as episodic memory and spatial memory  <cit> . meanwhile, emerging data have implied that hippocampal neurogenesis can lead to improvement in therapies for neurological disorders, including cerebral ischemia, depression, alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy, and parkinson’s disease, many of which are associated with cognitive decline  <cit> . thus, researchers are highly interested in exploring how various developmental events associated with hippocampal neurogenesis are regulated.

so far, it was well accepted that the hippocampal neurogenesis is under the control of gene regulatory network, especially transcription factors, micrornas , and signaling pathways  <cit> . however, annotation and high-throughput deep sequencing of transcriptomes have revolutionized the view previously held for the mammalian genome. surprisingly, a major part of the genome is transcribed into long noncoding rnas , which are longer than  <dig> nucleotides  in length and lack an open reading frame in sequence  <cit> . increasing evidence indicated that lncrnas participate in gene regulatory networks controlling the development and functioning of various tissues . moreover, transcript expression analyses within the nervous system have shown an abundance of lncrnas that display spatially restricted and temporally dynamic expression .

hence, the aim of the present study was to perform microarray expression profiling to identify lncrnas that might participate in the hippocampal neurogenesis. a set of lncrnas differentially expressed in the hippocampus after fimbria-fornix  transection were identified. a previous study found that the internal microenvironment changed after ff transection and subsequently contributed to the migration and survival of transplanted and endogenous hippocampal nscs  <cit> . moreover, this study indicated a relationship between dysregulated lncrnas and the changes in the hippocampal environment. these findings may be helpful in understanding the role of the novel lncrnas in hippocampal neurogenesis. overall, the present study demonstrated that an evolutionarily conserved lncrna regulated neurogenesis from nscs in the embryonic brain.

real-time quantitative pcr confirmation
a total of  <dig> lncrnas with log fold-changes between  <dig> and  <dig>  were randomly selected in different samples of the normal and paired denervated hippocampi to further validate the microarray results. the samples used for real-time pcr and microarray are the same ones. each rna samples of rat hippocampal tissue were divided into two parts, one for microarray and the other for real-time pcr.

all the selected lncrnas are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  including name and log fold-changes. three pairs of primers were designed to certify 
the expression of lncrnas. only the primer whose pcr product was in accordance with the predicted nucleus base pair number was used for further studies. using specific primers for each lncrna, all candidate lncrnas from hippocampal total rna were pcr-amplified . among  <dig> candidates, two primers had no products. using quantitative real-time reverse transcription-pcr , the expression of these lncrnas was found to be consistent with the microarray data . thus, these results further indicated the high accuracy of microarray expression profiles in detecting differential expression levels of most lncrnas. additionally, the microarray showed a series of lncrnas constantly differentially expressed between the normal and paired denervated hippocampi.fig.  <dig> validation of the expression of novel lncrnas. the fold changes in the expression of lncrnas on the seventh day after ff transection were normalized to the normal hippocampus. results were based on average of three independent experiments . the fold changes in the expression of lncrnas revealed by qpcr were consistent with the results from microarray expression profiling




expression signatures of differentially expressed lncrnas
since transcript expression analyses have shown a number of lncrnas that display restricted and temporally dynamic expression  <cit> , the expression trend of  <dig> lncrnas was first investigated during four different periods after ff transfection. the expression of lncrnas extracted from the normal hippocampus and the hippocampi  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 14 days after ff transfection was testified. rt-qpcr demonstrated fluctuations in lncrna expression after a change in the inner microenvironment. it was concluded that the expression levels of some lncrnas  continuously increased compared with the normal hippocampus, whereas the expression levels of some lncrnas  always decreased. on the contrary, some lncrnas  showed no consistent changes instead of reaching a peak during one period . the expression profiles of lncrnas provided a hint of their potential functions during development.fig.  <dig> expression signatures of differentially expressed lncrnas in the hippocampus. the expression trend of  <dig> differentially expressed lncrnas during  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 14 days after ff transfection. results were based on average of three independent experiments . statistical significance was calculated using student t test 




lncrnas generally show more tissue specificity compared with protein-coding genes  <cit> . the expression patterns of lncrnas in different tissues  were identified, which were developed from three different germinal layers. rt-pcr was performed to further determine whether the candidate lncrnas existed in some specific tissues or systems. it was found that some lncrnas  were present in all aforementioned eight tissues, whereas some lncrnas existed in the neural tissues and lineages . especially  <dig> and  <dig> lncrnas showed high tissue specificity in the neural system, indicating their potential meaningful roles in neurogenesis.fig.  <dig> tissue specialties of  <dig> candidate lncrnas. rt-pcr revealed the  <dig> lncrnas that exist in the following tissues: striatum, hippocampus, brain stem, cerebellum, cerebrum, heart, pancreas, muscle, and liver. among  <dig> candidates,  <dig> showed high specificity




a subsequent study to examine the differential expression levels of lncrnas after ff transection and in various tissues using qpcr and rt-pcr led to the identification of lncrna <dig> that might participate in adult hippocampal neurogenesis.

university of california santa cruz blast was used  <cit> . to further identify the novel lncrnas demonstrating lncrna <dig> to be a 961-nt polyadenylated rna encoded by  <dig> exons . the analysis using the coding potential calculator  <cit> , phylocsf  <cit> , and coding-potential assessment tool  <cit>  indicated that the lncrna <dig> transcript had no protein-coding potential .fig.  <dig> information about the novel lncrna <dig>  a ucsc showed lncrna <dig> location and homology with different species. b cpc demonstrated that lncrna <dig> had no potential of encoding protein




identification of the novel lncrna in the hippocampus
throughout adult life, v-svz nscs give rise to transit-amplifying cells, which generate neuroblasts that migrate to the olfactory bulb where they differentiate into interneurons . it has been observed that ff transection would result in increasing neuronal production in the hippocampus. hence, fish was performed to explore the location of lncrna <dig> to more directly observe the expression trend and investigate the function of lncrna <dig>  the dg or some other irrelevant location in the hippocampus. it was demonstrated that lncrna <dig> was specially expressed in the subgranular zone, which contained a population of adult nscs . compared with the normal hippocampus, the denervated hippocampus had more fluorescence-positive cells. thus, it was hypothesized that the upregulated lncrna <dig> resulting from ff transection was correlated with the neurogenesis in the hippocampus. total rnas were prepared from nscs that were extracted from the rat embryoid body to test and verify this assumption. as expected, the expression of lncrna <dig> was validated in the nscs .fig.  <dig> lncrna <dig> was expressed in hippocampus and v-svz nscs. a fish showed lncrna <dig> was expressed in the hippocampus and increased after ff transection. b rt-qpcr demonstrated the expression of lncrna <dig> in the nscs . c fish for lncrna <dig> in v-svz nsc cultures. nuclei were counterstained with dapi. d subcellular fractionation followed by rt-qpcr for indicated lncrnas. error bars are propagated standard deviation from technical triplicate wells 




considering the information on the subcellular localization of lncrnas can provide an important hint about their possible function as a nuclear-restricted epigenetic regulator or cytoplasmic competing endogenous rnas   <cit> , rt-qpcr of nuclear fractionation of hippocampal nsc cultures was performed. the analysis demonstrated lncrna <dig> to be enriched in the cytoplasm, compared with gapdh, which is located in the cytoplasm . consistent with the nuclear fractionation studies, fish for lncrna <dig> demonstrated the predominantly cytoplasmic location of the transcript . together, these data indicated that lncrna <dig> had high tissue specificity and tight transcriptional regulation, anticipating its potential role in the neurogenesis.

lncrna <dig> silencing reduced the nsc proliferation ability
the increased expression of lncrna <dig> in the denervated hippocampus suggested that lncrna <dig> might play a vital role in neurogenesis. consistent with this, the microarray analysis demonstrated that a number of cell-cycle genes were regulated after ff transection . in line with this hypothesis, a small interfering rna  was used to reduce the expression of endogenous lncrna <dig> in nscs. the efficiency was evaluated by qpcr. rt-qpcr demonstrated that the expression of lncrna <dig> in the knockdown group was about 72% less than that in the blank group . using flow cytometry, the proportion of the cell population undergoing proliferation was assayed with pi staining . a significant decrease in the number of proliferating cells was observed in the lncrna2393-depleted cells compared with the negative group  . sirna-mediated knockdown of lncrna <dig> was performed under similar conditions, followed by the edu proliferation assay to further examine the impact of lncrna <dig> on proliferation. compared with the blank and negative control groups, the knockdown group showed a lower percentage of cells undergoing proliferation . analysis about the proportion of edu positive cells showed a significance decreased in the knockdown group. collectively, the results indicated that lncrna <dig> reduced the proliferation of nscs.fig.  <dig> knockdown of lncrna <dig> weakened the nscs proliferation ability. a the expression of lncrna <dig> in the nscs after knockdown compared with that in the normal nscs . b flow cytometry showed that the proliferating cells decreased. c statistics analysis on the proportion of cells at g <dig> and s stage about flow cytometry . d edu indicated that after knockdown of lncrna <dig>  the edu-positive cells  decreased. e analysis of the number of positive cells in each group 




discussion
a previous study showed that the inner microenvironment changed when the ff transection was performed and the projection of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons to the dg was blocked  <cit> . moreover, the proliferation, differentiation, and migration of nscs in the hippocampus are under the control of extracellular and intracellular signaling pathways. it has been observed that the changed microenvironment plays a stimulatory role in the survival and differentiation of the anterior subventricular zone  progenitor cells after ff transection  <cit> ; however, the underlying mechanism is not well known. previously, researchers paid attention to the genes coding for biologically active macromolecules, including neural growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor  <cit> , and transcription factors nng <dig>  mash <dig>  lhx <dig>  and brn <dig> .

with technological advancement and development of new-generation sequencing technology, accumulating evidence indicated that mammalian genomes encode different kinds of lncrnas . more and more lncrnas were demonstrated to have biological significance in the developing nervous system through both loss- and gain-of-function experiments, either in stem cells or in vivo. ramos and his colleagues identified and predicted over  <dig>  novel lncrnas in the subventricular zone of adult mice  <cit> . many lncrna genes have now been identified, but the function and regulation of these transcripts are still unexplored.

it has been observed that the changed microenvironment plays a stimulatory role in the survival and differentiation of the svza progenitor cells after ff transection  <cit> . hence, the question is whether this is due to the effect of lncrnas. the relationship between the change in the expression of lncrnas that occurs with the change in the inner microenvironment resulting from ff transection, and the neurogenesis in the hippocampus needed to be investigated further.

therefore, microarray expression profiles were used to monitor the expression of lncrnas after the inner microenvironment of the hippocampus changed. using microarray and kegg pathway analyses,  <dig> differentially expressed lncrnas were identified and differentially expressed mrnas were found to be mainly enriched in the pathways involved in infection, cell cycle, and neural development. these data indicated the possibility of the involvement of long noncoding transcripts in the gene regulation network.

considering that the expression of lncrnas was under the control of extracellular and intracellular signaling pathways, real-time pcr and rt-pcr were performed to testify the expression profile and tissue specificity of lncrnas. of these, lncrna <dig> gained the attention of researchers due to its continued increasing expression and high tissue specificity. based on the expression profile and tissue specificity, lncrna <dig> was used for intensive studies. fish in a frozen section of hippocampus demonstrated that lncrna <dig> existed in the infragranular layer of hippocampus and was enriched in the denervated hippocampus. also, the relationship between lncrna <dig> and neurogenesis was investigated. the expression and location of lncrna <dig> were detected in the hippocampus-derived nscs. hence, lncrna <dig> existed in the nscs and was located in the cytoplasm. altogether, these results indicated that lncrna <dig> might be the stimulatory molecule in the hippocampal microenvironment. loss-of-function experiments showed a significant decrease in the self-renewal of nscs, which was consistent with the previous study results and assumption. hence, the role of lncrna <dig> was identified as a stimulatory molecule in the hippocampal neurogenesis.

the results showed that the subcellular localization of lncrna <dig> was mainly in the cytoplasm. previous reports indicated that the cytoplasmic lncrnas worked mainly by competing with endogenous rnas, for example, micrornas, mrnas, and pseudogenes. in particular, lncrnas compete with these mrnas and pseudogenes that share similar mirna response elements to bind to the same mirna, eventually implementing the spatial and temporal control of gene expression by preventing mirna binding to the target genes. a study in a mouse model of melanoma  <cit>  demonstrated that virtually all types of rnas could communicate with each other using mres  as the mode of communication. a study of cernas in the alzheimer’s disease showed that bacel-as  could be an endogenous competitive rna to target mirna  and activate the transcription of serfla . the upregulated expression of serfla would further promote the aggregation of aβ. thus, bacel-as is supposed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of alzheimer’s diseases.

furthermore, the increased expression of lncrna <dig> was found to be triggered by the changed microenvironment. a cold environment can induce the expression of lncrna coolair, and dna damage can induce the expression of panda  <cit> . therefore, the question is exactly which part of the denervated hippocampus induces the expression of lncrna <dig>  it needs to be testified whether some genes, such as sox <dig> and brn <dig>  are involved or other protein signals and cytokines interact with lncrna <dig>  further studies should aim to explore the molecular mechanism behind the expression of lncrna <dig> in the hippocampus, to lay the foundation for the clinical application of nscs intreating of diseases of the central nervous system.

CONCLUSIONS
we concluded that expression changes of lncrnas exists in the microenvironment of denervated hippocampus, of which promotes hippocampal neurogenesis. the identified lncrna lncrna <dig> expressed in neural stem cells, located in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus, which can promote nscs proliferation in vitro. therefore, the question is exactly which part of the denervated hippocampus induced the expression of lncrna <dig>  further studies should aim to explore the exact molecular mechanism behind the expression of lncrna <dig> in the hippocampus, to lay the foundation for the clinical application of nscs in the treatment of diseases of the central nervous system.
