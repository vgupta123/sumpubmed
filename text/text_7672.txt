BACKGROUND
bovine enterovirus  is a single positive-stranded rna virus belonging to the genus enterovirus within family picornaviridae. the viral particle is composed of a small, non-enveloped and icosahedral virion and  <dig>  k-base genome containing a single open reading frame  flanked by untranslated regions  at the 5′ and 3′ ends. the orf encodes a single long polyprotein containing structural proteins  and non-structural proteins   <cit> .

genus enterovirus is divided into  <dig> species defined as enterovirus a–h and j  and rhinovirus a–c   <cit> . bevs belong to ev-e and ev-f  and can be distinguished from other evs by the unique secondary structure of their rna genome: a 5′-cloverleaf and internal ribosome entry site  linked by additional nucleotide sequences at the 5′utr . since the isolation of bevs from cattle in the late 1950s , studies worldwide have detected bevs not only in cattle but also in other animal species including possums, bottlenose dolphins, camels and alpacas . although bevs have been classified based on virus antigenicity determined by cross neutralization testing , the genotype based on the capsid protein  amino acid sequences are also used to classify bevs . bevs are classified into  <dig> sero-/genotypes and  <dig> sero-/genotypes in ev-e  and ev-f , respectively.

although most evs cause only mild symptoms, including hand-foot-and-mouth disease, herpangina, pleurodynia and rashes  <cit> , some members belonging to the genus enterovirus can cause severe diseases. the most well known pathogen is poliovirus affecting humans. poliovirus and some of other evs, including coxsackie virus and echovirus, can invade the central nervous system causing neurological diseases, including aseptic meningitis, encephalitis and ataxia  <cit> . in other animals, although porcine teschovirus, formerly classified as porcine enterovirus, can cause a neurological disorder known as teschen/talfan disease  <cit> , the pathogenicity of evs infecting animals are still unclear. in case of cattle, foot-and-mouth disease virus belonging to the genus aphthovirus of the family picornaviridae can cause vesicular diseases leading to a serious economic impact for farmers  <cit> ; the pathogenicity of viruses belonging to the genus enterorovirus is still unclear. several reports have claimed that bevs can cause diarrhea, respiratory diseases, reproductive diseases and infertility in cattle ; however, bevs have also been widely detected in asymptomatic cattle and their environment, and experimental infection trials of bev have failed to produce clinical signs . therefore, whether bev infection is clinically important remains unclear.

it is widely known that most viruses belonging to genus enterovirus utilize “canyon” as their binding site to cells surface receptors, which is formed by outer capsid proteins including vp <dig>  vp <dig> and vp <dig>  <cit> . several studies of other enteroviruses revealed that sequences of the vp <dig> coding region are responsible for the phenotype of viruses; some amino acid substitutions in this region altered the pathogenicity and cell tropism of the viruses . although the cell surface receptor to bev has not been identified, it is likely that the capsid proteins, including vp <dig>  may be responsible for the phenotype of bevs, as their capsid proteins also form a “canyon” on the outer side of the virion, and a strain isolated from cattle with severe symptoms contained specific amino acid substitutions in the capsid regions  <cit> . to elucidate the determinants of bev virulence in hosts, genomic information of bevs must be determined.

recently, deep sequencing techniques using high-throughput sequencers have been used to evaluate virome including novel viruses in clinical samples without viral isolation to determine total genomic information within samples  <cit> . we previously identified novel viruses infecting the intestinal tracts of livestock using high-throughput sequencers to study enterovirus, picornavirus and astrovirus in the feces of goat, swine and cattle, respectively .

previously, we reported the detection of novel kobu-like virus in japanese black cattle, using feces of calf, by metagenomics analysis. in the present study, we identified a novel bev in feces collected for that survey  <cit> . to characterize the genomic features of this virus, complete genome sequences were determined and phylogenetic trees were constructed. in addition, secondary rna structures in the 5′utr and pairwise identity were analyzed.

methods
fecal sample and virus isolation
previously, we reported the detection of a novel kobu-like virus in japanese black cattle by deep sequencing method  <cit> . during the metagenomics surveillance, nucleotide sequences with high similarity to bevs were identified in feces collected from a calf with diarrhea. this feces was collected from a 1-month-old calf with diarrhea in kagoshima prefecture  in  <dig>  no other clinical sign was observed except diarrhea. feces was collected directly from the rectum on the onset day. one gram feces was diluted with 9 ml pbs  to prepare a 10% fecal suspension and centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for 10 min. the supernatant was collected and stored at −80 °c before rna extraction and virus isolation.

the supernatant of the kagoshima sample was subjected to virus isolation. the fecal supernatant was filtered through a  <dig> -μm pore size membrane and treated with 10 μg/ml acetylated trypsin  for 60 min at room temperature before virus isolation. treated samples were inoculated into mardin-darby bovine kidney cells. blind passage was subsequently conducted three times. minimum essential medium was used as negative control .

isolated bev strains
in this study, three bevs isolated in japan, bev is1/bos taurus/jpn/ <dig>  and is2/bos taurus/jpn/ <dig> , were additionally sequenced and analyzed. these viruses were isolated from a fecal sample collected from one cow at the same time in  <dig> in the ishikawa prefecture . in addition, bev ho12/bos taurus/jpn/ <dig>  was isolated from diarrheic feces collected in hokkaido in  <dig> by as described above  <cit> .

rna extraction, cdna library construction and whole genome sequencing
total rna was extracted from  <dig> -ml supernatants of isolated viruses and 10% fecal samples using trizol ls reagent . rna samples were normalized to 10–100 ng of rna per reaction, using a qubit_ <dig>  fluorometer . the cdna library of sample rna was constructed using the nebnext ultra rna library prep kit for illumina version  <dig>   as described previously  <cit>  and sequenced using miseq  with the miseq reagent kit v <dig>  . briefly, all reads were generated as  <dig> paired end reads. each sample was multiplexed with other  <dig> samples prepared from diarrheal feces of other calves . 5′-full race core set  and 3′full race core set  were used to complement virus sequences of the 5′ end and 3′ end, respectively.

analysis of genome sequences
all nucleotide sequences determined by miseq  were converted to fastaq format on miseq reporter v <dig>  and subsequently analyzed using clc genomics workbench  <dig>  . briefly, the ends of all reads were trimmed to remove adaptor sequences located at both ends of each read. trimmed reads were assembled into contigs using a de novo assembly algorithm. contigs generated by de novo assembly algorithm were analyzed using blastn.

hypothetical polyprotein cleavage sites of the viruses were predicted by multiple alignments with other bevs and confirmed by the netpicorna  <cit> . nucleotide  sequences or amino acid  sequences were aligned using clustalw. phylogenetic trees were constructed by maximum likelihood  methods on mega <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . the mtrev24 + g + f model , rtrev + f model , rtrev + g + f model , rtrev + g + i , and wag + g + i  were employed as evolutionary models for ml method. pairwise identity was analyzed on clc genomics workbench and the secondary rna structure of the 5′utr was predicted by mfold  <cit> .

vp <dig> genome sequencing
rt-pcr was performed by using primescript one step rt-pcr kit ver. <dig>  to confirm the sequences of the contigs obtained from the kagoshima sample. three primer sets were designed based on the contig sequences of this sample. primer sequences are given in additional file 1: table s <dig>  pcr products were sequenced using a 3130xl genetic analyzer .

detection of other pathogens causing diarrhea
to confirm the presence of other pathogens in the kagoshima sample, detection of agents causing diarrhea using our real-time pcr system, referred to as “dembo-pcr,” was performed  <cit> . this system can identify  <dig> species of pathogens, including virus, bacteria and protozoa. briefly, viral dna and rna were extracted by high pure viral nucleic acid extraction kit  and bacteria and protozoa dna were extracted by qiaamp fast dna stool mini kit . nucleic acids extracted by each kit were subjected to dembo-pcr, according to a previous report  <cit> .

RESULTS
virus isolation and determination of viral genome sequences
although virus isolation using supernatants of the kagoshima feces was repeated three times, no cytopathic effect could be detected. therefore, rna extracted from the kagoshima sample collected in  <dig> and virus stocks of bev-is <dig>  bev-is <dig> and bev-ho <dig> were subjected to deep sequencing. the kagoshima sample was sequenced twice, and all reads obtained from the two runs were used to generate contigs . the results of blastn analysis revealed that bovine enterovirus f, group a rotavirus , bovine kobu-like virus and bovine picornavirus were identified with e value =  <dig>  however, rva was not detected in feces by dembo-pcr.

the total bev read counts  of the kagoshima sample were  <dig> reads , and an approximately 7400 nt contig was obtained from the integrated result with a  <dig>  average sequence read depth . the complete genome was determined using 5′ and 3′ end race methods. because amino acid sequences of vp <dig> were not similar to those of other enteroviruses by homology analysis as described below, the vp <dig> genome sequence was confirmed by directly sequencing the pcr product. as a result, sequences obtained from direct sequencing agreed with the results of deep sequencing. the genome length of bev from the kagoshima sample was 7414 nt, excluding the poly  tail. we named this bev as bev an12/bos taurus/jpn/ <dig> .

viral genomes of isolated viruses including complete orfs were also determined. the genome lengths of bev-is <dig>  bev-is <dig> and bev-ho <dig> were 7413 nt , 7394 nt , and 7350 nt , respectively. the sequences of bev-an <dig>  bev-ho <dig>  bev-is <dig> and bev-is <dig> were deposited in the ddbj/embl/genbank database under the accession numbers lc <dig>  lc <dig>  lc <dig> and lc <dig>  respectively.

pairwise identity and genome analysis
table  <dig> shows the pairwise aa  or nt  identity of bev-an <dig> to representative strains of each species belonging to bevs and other japanese bevs. deduced aa sequences encoding polyprotein, 2c + 3cd, p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  3d and four capsid proteins  were compared to each ev-e and f. bev-an <dig> possessed showed identity to ev-fs in polyprotein, 2c + 3cd, p <dig>  p <dig> and 3d than to those of ev-es. however, low aa identity  was observed in p <dig> to ev-es and ev-fs. particularly, the vp <dig> region of bev-an <dig> encoded in p <dig> showed a significantly low aa identity to other bevs . as a result of multiple alignment analysis, several motifs conserved among the genomes of genus enterovirus were detected in the genome of bev-an <dig>  in particular, the  alxaaxetg motif in vp <dig>  gxcg motif in 2a, gxxgxgks motif for ntp-binding in 2c, gxcg motif forming part of the catalytic active site in 3c, and kde  r in 3d were identified . however, the putative cleavage site at the junction of vp3/vp <dig> was a glutamine/serine for bev-an <dig>  in addition, a 6-aa insertion in the 2a region was identified at position 835– <dig> aa  in the bev-an <dig> genome. multiple alignment using aa sequences encoding polyprotein is supplemented as additional file 2: table s <dig> table  <dig> pairwise nucleotide  and amino acid  identity  of bev-an <dig> to japanese bevs, ev-es and ev-fs

detection of agents causing diarrhea by dembo-pcr
dembo-pcr was performed to identify agents causing diarrhea in calf. according to the results, only bev was detected by this test. genome of other pathogens was not identified in the fecal sample of kagoshima.

discussion
according to the species demarcation criteria for the genus enterovirus defined by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses, members of a species in the genus enterovirus should share high aa identity  and compatibility in processing, replication and encapsidation  <cit> . in addition, ev-e and f can be distinguished from other evs because of their unique secondary rna structures in the 5′utr region   <cit> . our genome analysis revealed that bev-an <dig> shared aa sequences and protease cleavage site positions with ev-fs. in addition, bev-an <dig> contained domains i* and ii* in the 5′utr similarly to other bevs. therefore, bev-an <dig> is closely related to ev-fs. however, pairwise identity analysis revealed that aa sequences in the vp <dig> region of the bev-an <dig> genome had significantly low identities to other bevs strains . furthermore, bev-an <dig> did not cluster with any other ev-e and ev-f in the vp <dig> phylogenetic tree, although its p <dig> and p <dig> regions were closely related to ev-f. the percentage of aa identity of vp <dig> is commonly utilized for species and sero-/genotype definition   <cit> . according to the classification definition, our results indicate that bev-an <dig> is taxonomically distant from previously reported bevs. therefore, we named this strain as “enterovirus k”, which is a novel species within the genus enterovirus. other japanese bevs were classified as typical bevs .

our recombination analysis could not reveal the source of mutation , although several reports suggested that recombinant viruses belonging to the genus enterovirus were generated by intra/interspecies transmission  <cit> . point mutations in the viral genome are common among picornaviruses because their polymerase lacks the proofreading ability and fidelity of amplification . in addition, vp <dig> is a capsid protein, which likely influences host immunity in infected animals  <cit> . therefore, the accumulation of mutations in the viral genome and subsequent selection by immunity in infected hosts may result in the generation of novel species.

although the complete orf and complete or partial utrs sequences of four japanese bevs were determined, the virus could not be isolated from one diarrheal feces of a calf . bev-an <dig> has mutations in vp <dig> and 2a, which are involved in the formation of the capsid protein-host receptor binding site and cell proliferation, respectively  <cit> . although critical motifs for their function including  alxaxetg and gxcg were identified in the bev-an <dig> genome, a short insertion  in the 2a protein region and non-synonymous substitution at the junction of vp3/vp <dig> were observed in the bev-an <dig> genome. because these mutations may show alter receptor binding or virus replication, further crystal structure analysis of virions should be conducted.

the vp <dig> proteins in viruses belonging to the genus enterovirus are widely known to components that form the receptor binding site  together with vp <dig> and vp <dig>  <cit> . reverse genetic analysis of other enteroviruses revealed that amino acid substitution in the vp <dig> region was responsible for the virus phenotype, such as pathogenicity and cell tropism . mutations in capsid protein genes may influence the structure of the “canyon” and receptor-binding capacity. bevs also form a “canyon” on the outer side of the virion, although the cell surface receptor for bevs is unknown. therefore, bevs may also have specific determinants for their phenotypes based on the aa sequences in the capsid protein encoding region. we also tried to investigate the prevalence of bev-an <dig>  using vp <dig> specific primers,  in  <dig> diarrheal and  <dig> non-diarrheal feces samples collected from calves in kagoshima prefecture during 2014–2015; feces from only one calf was positive, as revealed in the results. therefore, we could not analyze the relationship between bev-an <dig> and its pathogenicity. according to the results of deep sequencing, we identified bovine picornavirus- and bovine kobu-like virus in the kagoshima sample. there are reports suggesting that bovine picornavirus and bovine kobuvirus are associated with diarrhea  <cit> . however, the pathogenicity of these viruses is still unknown. there is a possibility that all viruses can cause diarrhea. to clarify the determinants of the pathogenicity of bevs, experimental infection based on reverse genetic analysis is necessary.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study identified novel bev possessing highly divergent aa sequences in the vp <dig> coding region in japan. we name this strain as “enterovirus k”, which is a novel species within the genus enterovirus. to exclude the pathogenicity of bevs, further genomic information must be accumulated.
