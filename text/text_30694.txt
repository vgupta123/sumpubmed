BACKGROUND
during development, neurons make networks of connections with other neurons by growing axons and dendrites. these neuronal out-growths are regulated by extracellular cues that signal to cells resulting in phenotypic changes. a major challenge is the identification of molecular mechanisms underlying this highly complex and interactive network in terms of the functions of genes and proteins <cit> .

currently, transcriptomic methods are widely used as an initial step in unraveling the complex signaling mechanisms underlying physiological and pathological processes and in neuronal differentiation  <cit> . gene microarray offers a high throughput platform for the analysis of the entire transcriptome to identify differentially expressed genes. reverse transcription quantitative real-time pcr , with a wider dynamic range of quantification and higher assay sensitivity and precision, is often used to corroborate microarray findings  <cit> . regardless of the method used, normalization, a critical process of adjusting the expression measurements between samples to compensate for various sources of variability in the assay, is essential to allow accurate comparisons of the results between different samples and conditions  <cit> . normalization with internal reference gene is used to control for technical and biological variations introduced during both sample preparation and detection by rt-qpcr  <cit> . it has also been shown to be suitable for the normalization of partially degraded rna samples  <cit> .

with nearly all normalization methods, the assumption that one or more reference genes are constitutively expressed at near-constant levels under all experimental conditions is implicit and the expression levels of all other genes in the sample are then scaled to these reference genes accordingly. it is common to use reference genes selected from an assumed list of "housekeeping" genes  which typically include transcripts such as gapdh and actb  <cit> . a number of studies have now shown that the expressions of these genes, in some but not all experimental conditions, are altered significantly <cit> , thus, making the choice of using these hkgs for normalization uncertain without a priori knowledge.

a variety of approaches have been employed to enable better selection of reference genes. one approach is the use of statistical algorithms, for example, genorm  <cit> , best keeper  <cit> , normfinder  <cit> , global pattern recognition  <cit> , and equivalence tests  <cit> , to evaluate the relative expression stabilities of genes from a pool of predefined lists of candidates. while this approach is certainly more robust than using the single gene methods, it too is based on potentially unfounded assumptions about which genes may be stably expressed in the conditions studied. these genes are still required to be pre-selected and incorporated into the experimental designs without any a priori evidence to support their use. an alternative and less biased approach is the meta-analysis of large scale gene expression profiles to identify stably expressed genes  <cit> . a selected number of potential references genes can then be validated experimentally and the stability of expressions analyzed by the above mentioned statistical algorithms in defined experimental settings.

to date, reference genes validated for neuronal differentiation studies have not been reported yet. the present study aims to identify suitable reference genes during chemically induced neuronal differentiation of pc <dig>  a cell-line derived from a pheochromocytoma of the rat adrenal medulla. because of its unique cellular properties, suitability for genetic and biochemical manipulations, the pc <dig> cell-line is widely regarded as a convenient alternative to endogenous neuronal cells, and serves as a commonly used model system for studies on neuronal differentiation  <cit> . for example, in response to ngf, pc <dig> cells stop dividing, elaborate neuronal processes, are electrically excitable, and have the potential to form synapses when co-cultured with muscle cells  <cit> . here, we measured the temporal expression of twenty novel candidate reference genes identified from microarray studies and the commonly used hkgs, actb and gapdh, at various stages of pc <dig> differentiation. based on two independent statistical approaches ["pairwise comparison"  <cit>  and "model based variation"  <cit> , the expressions of ribosomal protein genes rpl <dig> and rpl <dig> were found to be highly stable regardless of pharmacological treatments and stages of differentiation. the combination of the two reference genes was sufficient to allow robust and accurate normalization of differentiation related genes.

RESULTS
selection of candidate reference genes from microarray data
it has been suggested that suitable reference genes should be expressed in all experimental conditions and exhibit low coefficient of variation  in their expressions  <cit> . in order to identify such reference genes, we first analyzed the expression profiles of  <dig>  genes in naïve pc <dig> cells and those treated with ngf or gdnf and found  <dig>  genes to be expressed in all conditions . we then analyzed the top  <dig> genes with the lowest cv  with two well accepted but different statistical approaches, "pairwise comparison"  and "model based variation analysis" . the "pairwise comparison" approach assumes that a perfect pair of reference genes has a constant ratio across all experimental conditions. as such, genorm evaluates the inter-conditional variability of the ratio between each pair of reference genes and calculates a gene stability measure m for each candidate  <cit> . however, with this method, tightly co-regulated genes will appear to be stable. the second algorithm, normfinder, was employed to safeguard against such a pitfall of misidentifying expression invariant reference genes. this model-based variance estimation approach entails analysis of sample subgroups and calculates the variation of each candidate gene individually, based on both intra- and inter-group variation  <cit> . while genorm measures relative stability, normfinder measures absolute stability by decomposing the variance to biological and technical elements. with this method, the expressions of co-regulated genes can be distinguished. despite the differences in algorithms and assumptions, both statistical methods were in agreement on the identity of the twenty most stable genes , most of which are novel for the purpose of normalization studies. interestingly, thirteen of these twenty candidate reference genes were ribosomal protein genes.

microarray analysis of the expression profiles of  <dig>  genes in naïve pc <dig> cells and those treated with ngf or gdnf for  <dig>  h and  <dig> h. twenty candidate reference genes were selected based on pairwise comparison  and model based variation  analysis of the top  <dig> genes with the lowest cv. the log <dig> transformed values of the average signal intensities among the  <dig> arrays were shown as mean. thirteen of the twenty genes were ribosomal protein genes . both actb and gapdh were included for comparison but were not among the top  <dig> genes recommended by either statistical analysis.

real-time pcr validation of novel candidate reference genes
as one of the most extensively studied models for neuronal differentiation, pc <dig> cells respond to a broad spectrum of pharmacological agents, which trigger a myriad of intracellular signaling pathways leading to neuronal differentiation. in order to verify the general utility of the  <dig> selected putative reference genes  in a broader range of experimental conditions, we differentiated pc <dig> cells with other stimuli  in addition to ngf and gdnf. gdnf was applied to pc <dig> cells stably expressing gdnf family receptor alpha 1a  and co-receptor ret , which are not endogenously expressed at detectable levels in pc <dig> cells . the percentage of pc <dig> cells differentiated by the five chemical stimuli was quantified  and the axon-like features of the extended neurite were confirmed by immunocytochemical analysis with anti-neurofilament- <dig> antibody . the extent of neurite outgrowth was highly dependent on the stimuli used. ngf and gdnf stimulation induced longer neurite outgrowths than forskolin, kcl or y <dig>  total rna was collected at  <dig>  h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h from control and treated cells for each stimuli, with biological triplicates, that totaled  <dig> samples.

we analyzed the expression levels of the aforementioned twenty candidate reference genes, two most commonly used hkgs , and three genes which are well known to be regulated by ngf using rt-qpcr . the expression levels of the twenty candidate reference genes and the two hkgs span three orders of magnitude. these reference genes were expressed at comparable levels or lower than the hkgs examined. for accurate determination of inter-assay variations and primer efficiencies, flanking regions of the genes  were amplified by pcr, sub-cloned and the sequences verified. these recombinant plasmids were then linearized and served as templates to construct standard curves. all the qpcr assays showed high efficiency of amplification  and low intra- and inter-assay variations . all rna samples showed rqi values of greater than  <dig>  indicative of high quality and integrity .

stabilities of candidate reference genes and common housekeeping genes
using both genorm and normfinder, we analyzed the expression stabilities of the twenty candidate reference genes and the two commonly used hkgs across all six differentiation conditions. both statistical approaches recommended the same three ribosomal protein genes rpl <dig>  rpl <dig> and rpl <dig> as the overall best reference genes . pairwise variation analysis by genorm showed that the combination of rpl <dig> and rpl <dig> is sufficiently stable , thus excluding the need to incorporate a third reference gene rpl <dig> for normalization of target gene expression. notably, neither gapdh nor actb were recommended.

further analysis of candidate gene stabilities in each treatment group  or at specific time point  revealed that the stability rankings of candidate genes do vary among different subgroups. however, with the exception of rpl <dig> in kcl treated samples, the two genes rpl <dig> and rpl <dig> were consistently ranked among top  <dig> in all subgroups. in contrast, the stability rankings of gapdh and actb varied considerably among different subgroups and they were ranked among the least stable ones within the group of  <dig> genes in several subgroups. the data indicated that the two novel candidate genes rpl <dig> and rpl <dig> have higher expression stabilities than both gapdh and actb, and may serve as better normalizers for gene expression in neuronal differentiation of pc <dig> cells.

comparison of the normalization factors generated by different reference gene
to account for possible variations introduced during sample preparation and measurements, raw expression profiles of target genes were scaled by a normalization factor  calculated based on independent measurement of one or more internal reference genes. the variation between nfs generated by different reference genes is thus directly reflective of the variation in the final target gene expression values normalized by different reference genes. we noticed that although rpl <dig> and rpl <dig> were ranked as the overall best pair of reference genes, they were not necessarily the best pair for each treatment subgroup. to test the robustness of these two genes across different treatments, we compared the normalization factors calculated based on rpl <dig> and rpl <dig>  to that of the most stable pair of reference genes  in each treatment subgroup. similarly, we examined the differences between nftop <dig> and nfs calculated based on the commonly used hkgs, actb  or gapdh . the deviations of each nf from nftop <dig> are represented in figure  <dig> . the nfrpl19/rpl <dig> values were found to least deviate from nftop <dig> in ngf, gdnf and kcl subgroups, and had zero deviation in fsk and y <dig> subgroups as rpl <dig> and rpl <dig> were ranked top  <dig>  in contrast, nfactb and nfgapdh differed substantially from nftop <dig> in many instances, reflective of their varying stabilities across different treatments.

effect of different reference genes on the interpretation of target gene regulation
next, the possibility that using scaling factors of nfrpl19/ <dig>  nfactb or nfgapdh may substantially alter the interpretation of target gene expression regulation in ngf induced neuronal differentiation was investigated. the relative fold changes of egr <dig>  itga <dig> and cryab expressions normalized by the three nfs were compared to the values normalized by nf of the top  <dig> genes . no statistically significant differences were observed among nfrpl29/rpl10a, nfrpl19/rpl <dig>  and nfactb normalized values; whereas nfgapdh normalized fold changes were significantly different . in the case of egr <dig> and itga <dig>  the use of gapdh as reference gene resulted in the underestimation of target genes expressions, leading to false negative conclusions when a two-fold cut off was applied . on the other hand, normalization by gapdh resulted in the significant over-estimation of the down-regulation of cryab in ngf treated samples .

the clearly different expression profiles of egr <dig>  itga <dig>  and cryab when normalized to gapdh raised the possibility that gapdh expression could be regulated over the course of ngf induced differentiation. normalization of gapdh expression by the nf of the top  <dig> genes  and the nfrpl19/rpl <dig>  revealed that gapdh expression was indeed significantly elevated  in ngf-stimulated pc <dig> cells . a more detailed analysis of the kinetics of gapdh expression over time revealed that expression of gapdh indeed increased over a period of  <dig> h . as a result, the use of gapdh as a single, unverified reference gene would invariably lead to erroneous interpretation of target gene regulation.

similarly, we investigated the effect of different reference gene on normalized target gene expressions in gdnf, forskolin, kcl and rock inhibitor y <dig> treated samples. similar to the case of ngf treatment, with gdnf stimulated pc12-gfra1a/ret <dig> and pc12-gfra1a/ret <dig> cells, normalization by gapdh resulted in the underestimations of gdnf induced upregulation of egr <dig> and itga <dig> expressions; and over-estimated cryab down-regulation . interestingly, normalization by actb was found to overestimate the expression of egr <dig> and itga <dig> expressions in pc12-gfra1a/ret <dig> but not ret <dig> cells , highlighting the subtle differences between gfra1a/ret <dig> and gfra1a/ret <dig> systems.

for forskolin and rock inhibitor y <dig> differentiated samples, normalization by actb consistently led to the over-estimations of target gene expressions . depending on the time point analyzed, normalization by gapdh was shown to result in either underestimations or overestimations of target gene expressions . in kcl treated samples, no statistical significant difference was observed among nftop <dig> , nfrpl19/rpl <dig>  nfactb and nfgapdh normalized target gene expression, which suggested that all four were acceptable reference gene for this particular experimental condition .

it is thus evident that the stabilities of the two most commonly used hkgs, gapdh and actb vary across different experimental conditions during neuronal differentiation of pc <dig> cells. they were acceptable reference genes under some conditions but may significantly under- or over-estimate target gene expression under others. on the contrary, the two novel candidate reference genes rpl <dig> and rpl <dig> were stably expressed among all conditions analyzed and allowed accurate normalization of differentially regulated genes during pc <dig> differentiation. it is worthy to note that at early time points , the expressions of egr <dig>  itga <dig> and cryab did not show any significant differences when scaled with either nftop <dig>  nfrpl19/rpl <dig>  nfactb or nfgapdh . this is consistent with the observation that the expression of gapdh did not change significantly at the early time points .

discussion
twenty candidate reference genes that showed little variation but high expression in pc <dig> cells differentiated with ngf and gdnf were first selected from microarray datasets using two independent statistical algorithms. together with two well studied hkgs, the expression stabilities of these candidate reference genes were further analyzed using rt-qpcr in cells differentiated with other stimuli. from these studies, unexpectedly, rpl <dig> and rpl <dig> but not the hkgs, were identified as suitable reference genes that can be used for normalization of gene expression in neuronal differentiation of pc <dig> induced by a variety of chemical stimuli.

neuronal differentiation is a process where cells undergo enormous morphological changes, over a period of several days. it is accompanied by substantial biochemical changes including cell cycle exit  <cit> , changes in metabolism  <cit>  and alteration in structural proteins  <cit> . since the commonly used reference genes are mostly structural proteins or enzymes involved in metabolism, it is especially important to validate the stabilities of these genes during the process of differentiation. many of these studies investigated gene expression changes in pc <dig> but few have evaluated the suitability of hkgs as normalizers in this model. our microarray analysis revealed that a group of novel candidate genes was more stably expressed than commonly used hkgs actb and gapdh, suggesting that actb and gapdh may not be ideal reference genes in neuronal differentiation of pc <dig> cells.

in an effort to gain an insight into the temporal regulation of genes during neuronal differentiation, it is necessary that the reference genes used are stably expressed over a period of days. gapdh and actb have been used for normalization in more than 90% of previous reports  <cit> , often without proper validation of their stabilities. numerous publications have reported that such hkgs can be differentially expressed under various experimental paradigms and are therefore inappropriate for normalization  <cit> . however, there are also recent reports that these hkgs are stably expressed and can serve as reference genes  <cit> . most genes, including gapdh and actb, examined in this study were stable at early stages of differentiation . however, as differentiation proceeded with dramatic morphological changes and concomitant biochemical changes, the instability of expressions of gapdh and many of the genes examined was obvious. in the case of gapdh, this instability issue correlated well with the temporal increase of expression level, which peaked at  <dig> h and was sustained over a period of  <dig> h. while gapdh may still serve as a reference gene for pc <dig> cells under specific conditions, the validity of using this gene and other less stable ones should be experimentally verified. however, the two rp genes  that showed good stability in expression over the period of differentiation provided an optimal pair of reference genes for the entire period of and various experimental conditions for neuronal differentiation.

among the twenty candidate genes selected, thirteen were ribosomal protein genes, suggesting that the family of ribosomal protein genes may become yet another source of reference genes. several recent publications have validated and recommended the use of ribosomal protein genes as reference genes  <cit> , while others have reported their tissue-dependent variations  <cit> . a plausible explanation for such disparity is the large number of ribosomal protein genes present in mammalian systems , which may be stably or differentially expressed depending on the tissue type or experimental conditions. at present, relatively little is known about these mammalian ribosomal proteins, as compared to their bacterial and archael counterparts  <cit> . while bacterial ribosomal protein genes exist largely in clusters, the mammalian rp genes are dispersed throughout the genome  <cit> . some have suggested that all of these proteins are intimately involved in ribosome production and could be co-regulated. depletion of a particular ribosomal protein would generally cause a reduction of all other ribosomal proteins in the same ribosome sub-unit  <cit> . other reports have shown that some ribosomal protein genes could be regulated independent of others  <cit> . recently, extra-ribosomal functions of some of these proteins have been reported  <cit> , suggesting that they may be individually regulated. a previous study comparing random ests from naïve and ngf-treated pc <dig> cells, reported an ngf-promoted decrease in the expressions of rpl <dig>  <cit> . however, this decrease in rpl <dig> was not observed in other studies using sage  <cit>  or microarray  <cit> . similar to the latter studies, we too did not observe changes in rpl <dig> transcripts with ngf-treated pc <dig>  moreover, the sage study but not the microarray analysis reported a significant decrease in rpl <dig> expression. using both microarray and rt-qpcr, we have also shown that rpl <dig> was unchanged when the cells were differentiated. the reasons for these discrepancies are unclear and may be due to the differences in methods used. we have shown here by quantitative real-time pcr that some ribosomal protein genes, rpl <dig> and rpl <dig>  are highly stably expressed and are thus suitable reference genes, whereas others like rpl <dig> and rpl <dig> can vary significantly during differentiation.

unlike some studies that attempted to identify ideal reference genes through meta-analysis of many publically available microarray data which includes a diverse range of tissue types and experimental conditions, this study was designed to specifically identify a set of suitable reference genes for pc <dig> cells undergoing neuronal differentiation. we have performed both the microarray analysis and rt-qpcr validation on biological samples prepared with the same techniques and reagents, thus minimizing variations introduced by differences in sample preparation methods and assay platforms. we have also systematically evaluated the effect of the use of nfs of inappropriate reference gene on the expression changes of the target genes and the erroneous results they resulted in. thus, with neuronal differentiation of pc <dig> cells, scaling with the geometric means of the expressions of rpl <dig> and rpl <dig> is recommended for the accurate normalization of gene expression. whether these two genes are suitable for normalization of neuronal differentiation in other systems remains to be evaluated.

CONCLUSIONS
twenty novel candidate reference genes were identified and their expression stabilities were analyzed and compared to that of commonly used hkgs actb and gapdh. through this systematic study that included both microarray analysis and rt-qpcr, we have found two ribosomal protein genes rpl <dig>  and rpl <dig> to be stably expressed during neuronal differentiation of pc <dig> cells, induced by five different chemical stimuli, over  <dig> h. the combination of these two novel reference genes allowed robust and accurate normalization of differentially expressed genes, regardless of stimuli and stages of differentiation. in contrast, the use of an inappropriate reference gene like gapdh led to significant erroneous estimation of differentially expressed genes.
