BACKGROUND
human papillomavirus  constitute a group of over  <dig> different types. hpv infect stratified epithelia, both mucosal and cutaneous and associate with benign and malignant proliferative disorders. viral types that preferentially infect mucosal epithelia are grouped into either a low-risk group  not associated with cancer, or into a high-risk group  whose members are found in almost all cases of cervical cancer  <cit> . hpv are non-lytic, non-enveloped, icosahedral-shaped viruses with a circular, double-stranded dna genome of approximately  <dig>  kb that is functionally divided into two coding regions  and one regulatory region or lcr. the e region includes six major open-reading frames  encoding functional proteins  and oncoproteins , and the l region encodes the two capsid proteins, l <dig> and l <dig>  e <dig> is expressed in both early and late stages of the viral life cycle  <cit> .

hpv gene expression is mainly regulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels and several studies have suggested that viral dna methylation may be associated with viral gene expression and cancer progression  <cit> .

most of the work on hpv methylation has been carried out on the two main viral types involved in cervical cancer . in both genomes there is a progressive increase in methylation from asymptomatic carriers, through benign lesions and pre-malignant disease, to cancer tumors. nevertheless, there is heterogeneity of cpg methylation in viral genomes derived from clinical specimens  <cit> , and the exact role of viral dna methylation remains unclear.

furthermore, based on epstein-barr virus studies it has been proposed that viral genome methylation may enable a proportion of infected cells to survive cytotoxic t-cell immune surveillance  <cit> , and studies on adenovirus late viral genes suggest that they are more sensitive to methylation than early ones  <cit> . in the case of hpv l <dig> and l <dig> genes, they have been proposed to be preferentially recognized by the cellular methylation machinery  <cit> .

methylation is the only known covalent modification of dna in eukaryotes and plays an important regulatory role in vertebrates by silencing specific genes during development and cell differentiation. cytosine methylation occurs at the 5'-position of the pyrimidine ring, mainly within a cpg context , although methylation of cytosines in different contexts has recently been described  <cit>  and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine , a novel dna modification was reported  <cit> .

usually, the presence of m5cpg in genomic dna is associated with chromatin condensation and inactivation of gene expression. nevertheless, it is not clear whether the primary evolutionary role of dna methylation is transcriptional silencing or a host defense system against endogenous or exogenous parasitic sequence elements  <cit> .

in the genomes of higher eukaryotes, cpg dinucleotides are usually underrepresented, from one third down to 5% of their expected frequency  <cit> . the mechanism proposed to explain this underrepresentation, first recognized in prokaryotic systems  <cit> , is that cpg sites are mutagenic due to the frequent conversion of methylcytosines to thymines through deamination  <cit> .

similar to their hosts, cpg dinucleotides are underrepresented in the majority of small dna viruses, although to a lesser extent  <cit> . it has been proposed that low cpg frequencies may either allow viruses to avoid methylation by host methyltransferases and thus maximize their transcriptional efficiency, or could be a means of reducing cpg mediated immune responses  <cit> .

the general view is that cpg sites in vertebrates, grouped within clusters or islands , are mostly unmethylated in promoter regions of transcriptionally active genes, and methylated in promoter regions of transcriptionally inactive genes. in contrast, methylation in body genes seems to be evolutionarily conserved and plays an important role in tissue- or cell-specific alternative promoter regulation. furthermore, tumor cells usually show hypomethylation of the majority of the genome and methylation of cgis in promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes  <cit> .

according to gardiner-garden and frommer  <cit>  a cgi is defined as a dna fragment of at least  <dig> bp containing at least 50% of cpg's, with a cpg observed/expected  ratio of  <dig>  or higher and at least a  <dig> bp gap in between different cgis. this definition, despite its popularity, has raised many criticisms and various different proposals have been postulated  <cit> . han et al.,  <cit>  recently compared three computational algorithms for cpg island identification and, based on vertebrate gene function and other genomic factors, the takai and jones criteria performance was the best. the analysis of  <dig> cgis across the entire human chromosome  <dig> allowed researchers to identify several attributes associated with either methylation-resistance or methylation-sensitivity of cgis  <cit> .

the majority of the proposals for cgi identification and criteria to analyze methylation predisposition at cpg islands cannot be directly applied to hpv genomes because of their small size. in addition, lack of multiple promoter regions and the scarce data on methylation of different viral types make this scenario difficult.

because in our view, understanding dna methylation may benefit from our knowledge of cpg distribution along different viral genomes, we have analyzed genomic and regional proportions of cpg sites  and their arrangement into cgis, in most human papillomavirus types sequenced to date. to our knowledge, there has been no comprehensive analysis of cgis in virus genomes. we propose hypotheses about their functional roles, considering hpvs as both a single group or as subgroups in function of their preferential tropism  and their associated risk to induce cancer .

RESULTS
cpg sites are underrepresented among hpv genomes, although to a lesser extent than in their hosts
after identifying all cpg sites among  <dig> available hpv dna sequences, we calculated the expected cpg value for each viral genome. the expected number of cpg sites was calculated as the number of 'c's multiplied by the number of 'g's in the viral genome, divided by the genome size.

when we compared the cpg observed vs. the expected values for each viral type, a significant difference was clear . in addition, a positive correlation was found  indicating a similar proportion of cpgs diminishing irrespective of viral type. as anticipated, cpg sites are underrepresented in viral genomes, although to a lesser extent than in their human host genome  <cit> . the average difference between means is  <dig> % .

interestingly, most hr-hpv infecting mucosal epithelia show cpg o/e ratios below the o/e average ratio ; only five hr-hpv types  show differences slightly above the average ratio . in fact, the hr-hpvs possess the lowest average  cpg o/e ratio which means that this viral sub-group shows a deeper cpg underrepresentation. cpg o/e average ratios for lr-and cutaneous hpv types are  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.

in figure  <dig>  we can observe cpg values as a function of the expected values for all  <dig> sequenced hpv genomes. the calculated o/e ratio for each individual nucleotide among different viral genomes indicates that c  and g  are underrepresented while a  and t  are overrepresented within hpv genomes.

hpv e <dig> is the region with the highest proportion of cpgs
we calculated each pcs as the number of cpg sites divided by the total number of nucleotides in the considered sequence. then we plotted pcs for each viral region in ascending order  independently of the viral type. this means that each x axis value may represent more than one viral type.

from figure  <dig> , it is clear the e <dig> orf possesses the highest regional pcs value , and that the e <dig> region  does not show similar pcs values . in three out of  <dig> viral types, e <dig> exhibits the highest pcs values while the lcr region shows the highest pcs values in four out of  <dig> types.

regional average pcs  for individual orfs and the lcr are as follows: e <dig>   <dig>  ; e <dig>   <dig>  ; e <dig>   <dig>  ; e <dig>   <dig>  ; e <dig>   <dig>  ; l <dig>   <dig>  ; l <dig>   <dig>  ; and lcr,  <dig>  .

when hpvs are grouped in function of their preferential tropism, the e <dig> orf pcs averages are the highest when compared to any other region. in fact, e <dig> orf pcs averages are quite close, irrespective of type: for cutaneous,  <dig>  and for mucosal,  <dig> , similar to when mucosal hpvs were grouped in function of risk: low risk,  <dig>  and high risk,  <dig> . furthermore, e <dig> average pcs values are around twice the highest average pcs from any other region in each viral group/subgroup .

interestingly, o/e ratios for a  and g  individual nucleotides in the e <dig> orf, follow the same trend found in the entire viral genome, however, t  seems underrepresented and c  overrepresented, compared to whole genome values. when arc-sin transformed o/e ratios for single nucleotides in e <dig> and in the whole genome were compared, we found that the two sets of data are significantly different , even though they are significantly correlated . pcs were arc-sin transformed in order to properly use statistical procedures, as mentioned in the methods section.

hpv type distributions in function of regional proportion of cpg sites are dissimilar
hpv types were ordered in function of regional arc-sin transformed pcs  and compared to each other using a pearson linear correlation coefficient and two sided t tests. results are shown in table  <dig>  where it can be seen that  <dig> out of  <dig> are significant correlations. this means that any viral type closely maintains its relative position in function of each significant correlated couple of regional pcs. there is a lack of correlation between lcr pcs and those from the e <dig>  e <dig>  l <dig> and l <dig> regions, as well as the average of the orfs; between e <dig> pcs and those from the e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> regions; and between e <dig> pcs and that from the l <dig> region.

the distribution of cpg islands/clusters among hpvs is heterogeneous
cgi location is summarized in table  <dig> . there are in average  <dig> cgis per hpv genome  and the average island size is  <dig> bp, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp. twenty two hpv types possess a single cgi with a average size of  <dig> bp ;  <dig> types possess two cgis with a average size of  <dig> bp ;  <dig> types possess three cgis with a average size of  <dig> bp ;  <dig> types possess four cgis, average size of  <dig> bp ;  <dig> types possess five cgis, average size of  <dig> bp ;  <dig> types possess six cgis, average size of  <dig> bp ;  <dig> types possess seven cgis, average size of  <dig> bp , and just one type  possesses eight cgis with an average size of  <dig> bp . none of the viruses lack cgis, and in all cases at least one cgi belongs to the e2/e <dig> region.

hpv e2/e <dig> is the region with the highest number of cgis
we found that the viral region with the highest number of cgis  is e2/e4; each viral type possessing at least one cgi in this region. it is important to make clear that in the case of e <dig>  as in any other region, we have only taken into account those hpv types where this orf has been identified. other regions which most commonly contain cgis include the e <dig>  e <dig> and l <dig> orfs which have cgis in at least half of hpv types; the l <dig> orf and lcr regions with one cgi in  <dig> to 50% of viral types, and finally, the region where less than 25% of the viral types possess one cgi is e <dig> 

in most types, there is not an exact correspondence between whole genome cgin and regional cgin because when an island/cluster is distributed in more than one viral region, it is taken into account in every comprehended region; even if there is just one cgi in the whole genome. this applies particularly to the e <dig> and e <dig> regions because the e <dig> orf is located within the e <dig> orf, although in a different reading frame .

high-risk hpv types exhibit lesser and shorter cpg islands/clusters
when grouped by tropism, cgi average sizes and ranges are as follows: cutaneous hpv types averaging  <dig> bp ; all mucosal hpv types,  <dig> bp ; mucosal lr-hpv types,  <dig> bp , and mucosal hr-hpv types,  <dig> bp . notably, when cgi frequencies per size were compared, we found significant differences between cutaneous and mucosal hpvs  as well as between mucosal lr- and hr-hpvs . additionally, both cutaneous and mucosal viral types share an average of  <dig>  cgis per viral genome , and among mucosal types, lr-hpvs show an average of  <dig>  cgis per viral genome in contrast to hr-hpvs that show only  <dig>  cgis. when compared frequencies per number of cgi, we also found significant differences between cutaneous and mucosal hpvs  as well as between mucosal lr- and hr-hpvs .

thirty out of  <dig> cutaneous and  <dig> out of  <dig> mucosal types possess  <dig> or less cgis, and  <dig> out of  <dig> cutaneous and  <dig> out of  <dig> mucosal types possess more than  <dig> cgis. in the mucosal group,  <dig> out of  <dig> lr- and all  <dig> hr-hpvs possess  <dig> or less cgis, and  <dig> out of  <dig> lr-hpvs posses more than  <dig> cgis .

although cgis seem regionally distributed in a similar manner between cutaneous and mucosal types , there is a notable difference between the proportion of cgis among both mucosal hr- and lr-types , especially for regions e <dig> , e <dig> , l <dig> , l <dig> , and lcr . in fact, among mucosal hr-hpv types, only hpv  <dig> contains a cgi in the e <dig> region; only hpv  <dig> contains a couple of cgis in the l <dig> region, and none of the mucosal hr-hpvs contain cgis in either the l <dig> or lcr regions.

interestingly, when focusing only on regions where islands were identified , the region possessing the highest cgi number is l <dig> , followed by l <dig> , e <dig>  and lcr . oncogenes e <dig> and e <dig> as well as e <dig> and e <dig> orfs share  <dig> cgi on  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hpv types, respectively.

discussion
to our knowledge, this is the first systematic analysis of cgis, as well as of cpg site distribution performed in  <dig> hpv types. this analysis provides the main structure underlying the methylation phenomenon, guiding the identification of interesting genomic regions for future epigenetic experimental studies.

as anticipated  <cit> , we found significant differences between cpg observed and expected values among all sequenced hpv genomes. nevertheless, contrary to the notorious underrepresentation of cpg sites among eukaryotic genomes where they account for only one third down to 5% of the expected values; viral genomes have an underrepresentation of only around 50% of the expected cpg values. according to the co-evolution hypothesis, it would be expected that both human and hpv genomes exhibit similar cpg underrepresentation values. the great differences found could be related to other relevant phenomena, such as the species-specific codon usage and the genomic base composition. in fact a relationship between codon use and base composition with c+g content in hpvs was previously found  <cit> .

in this context, it seems necessary to mention that hpvs are small sized viral dna genomes that do not evolve rapidly, in contrast to other viruses. it has been calculated that approximately  <dig>  years are needed for  <dig> bp to change in these genomes  <cit> .

in a biological context, a significant correlation between cpg observed and expected values could reflect global common functional constrictions shared by most hpv types. at the same time, the aspcs inter-regional lack of correlations point to local functional constriction divergences, particularly in the e <dig> and lcr regions . nevertheless, more studies of different hpv types are necessary to confirm it.

interestingly, l <dig> and l <dig> orfs show a parallel cpg behavior. both of them possess relatively low pcs arranged mostly in cgi. the l <dig> region is sixth place in average pcs value and fourth place in island number, and l <dig> is eighth place in average pcs value and sixth place in island number. it is known that in low grade cervical lesions associated to hpv  <dig>  the viral genome is episomal, hypomethylated, and the l <dig> and l <dig> orfs are expressed in order to generate viral capsids. in contrast, most high grade cervical lesions show viral dna integrated, hypermethylated, and the l <dig> and l <dig> orfs are not expressed. in vertebrates, methylation in body genes plays an important role in tissue- or cell-specific alternative promoter regulation, such that orphan cgis are used for alternative promoter identification  <cit> . even though this is a risky idea, it is tempting to speculate that viral capsid coding orfs behave similarly and that when the cell hypermethylates them, it is possible that the l1/l <dig> region plays a role as an alternative promoter for viral genes and, when integrated, for some cellular genes.

additionally, viral oncogenes also show a parallel cpg behavior, but in an opposite manner as the capsid coding genes. both of them possess relatively high pcs values associated to few cgi. e <dig> occupies the second place according to average regional pcs values and the fifth place according to the average island number, while the e <dig> region occupies the fifth place according to regional pcs and the eighth place according to the average island number. this means cpg sites are widely distributed and suggest both regions could be sensitive to methylation, especially when the hpvs integrate in to the cell genome.

the e <dig> orf seems to be a special case because of its multiple roles during the viral cycle. it is involved in diverse cell and viral functions, especially in diminishing keratinocyte integrity  <cit> , cell cycle arrest at g <dig>  <cit> , hpv dna replication  <cit>  and expression of late proteins  <cit> , possibly through several proteolysis products from the e <dig> protein  <cit> . in fact, the e <dig> orf is expressed throughout the viral cycle  <cit> . its functions and continuous expression could impound hard functional restrictions to sequence mutations, as well as the need for a mechanism involved in avoiding methylation. the maintenance of cpg sites in cgis could be a kind of compromise to meet sequence code restrictions with the necessary expression of the e <dig> protein.

in addition to the underrepresentation of cpg sites in hpv genomes, single nucleotide proportions point to t and a increased frequencies at the expense of g and c frequencies, reinforcing the c → t mutation hypothesis as a result of cpg deamination.

nevertheless, the e <dig> region does not share the same behavior. amazingly, even when a and g proportions are similar to those from the whole genome, c frequencies seem to be increased at the expense of ts. this fact, added to the high number of cpg sites, mostly arranged into cgis, leads to the question of whether there is any mechanism to avoid c → t mutations, resulting from deamination, that affects the hpv and specially the viral e <dig> region. in fact, there exist repair enzymes that remove deaminated bases; specifically, thymine dna glycosylase  and methyl-cpg binding domain protein  <dig>  which are able to remove either uracil or thymine from g·u and g·t miss-pairings where follow-on base excision repair enzymes restore a g·c pair  <cit> .

when grouped by tropism, the cutaneous hpv group, shows the greatest cgi average size , followed by the lr-hpv group with an intermediate cgi average size  and the hr-hpv group shows the smallest average cgi size . additionally, even though cgin from both cutaneous and mucosal hpv types share similar values , it seems there is a trend toward smaller cgin in hr- compared to lr- hpvs . these data raise questions about the possible role of cgis on the interaction between virus and cells. at the same time, this suggests a possible differential susceptibility to methylation in function of either hpv tropism or associated risk. nevertheless, the only experimental studies on methylomes have been carried out on hpv types  <dig> and  <dig>  where methylation changes and high heterogeneity were observed along the viral infection phases  <cit> . in summary, those inter-group differences could be related to different viral infection epigenetic strategies.

finally, it should be interesting to examine virus targeted genes in the human genome and see what their cgi and cpg features are. we hope that our analysis of cpg and cgi distribution among hpv genomes can provide elements for rational experimental approaches related to biological and evolutionary processes of these viruses and their hosts.

CONCLUSIONS
first, we want to point out that this work is based solely on sequence feature analysis, so the results reported here may need experimental corroboration. in this study, we found that there are both significant differences and correlations between cpg observed and expected values among all sequenced hpv genomes, and that viral genomes have an underrepresentation of only around 50% compared to eukaryotic genomes where underrepresentation is from  <dig> down to 5%.

the regional analysis of cpg site distribution shows that correlations between complete genome pcs are significant, even though there is a lack of correlation between several genomic region pairs, especially those involving lcr and e <dig>  furthermore, we found that l <dig> and l <dig> orfs exhibit an opposite behavior to oncogenes e <dig> and e7; the first pair possessing relatively low numbers of cpg sites which are associated to cgi while the oncogenes possess a relatively high number of cpg sites which are not associated to cgi. we would point out that e <dig> is the region possessing the highest content of cpgs in every hpv type where an e <dig> is identified.

from the cgi analysis, the e2/e <dig> is the only region with at least one cgi in every hpv, and the main difference between this region and the complete genome is that in the e <dig> region the frequency of cs seems increased at the expense of ts. the mucosal hr-hpvs possess the shortest cgi sizes, followed by the mucosal lr-hpvs and finally by the cutaneous viral subgroup. at the same time, the mucosal hr-hpvs show a trend toward lower cgi numbers, followed by the cutaneous viral subgroup and finally by the mucosal lr-hpvs.

finally, we hope that our analysis of cpg and cgi distribution among hpv genomes can provide support for rational experimental approaches related to the biological and evolutionary processes of these viruses and their hosts.
