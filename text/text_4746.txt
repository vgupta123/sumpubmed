BACKGROUND
micrornas are small  rnas that play important regulatory roles by targeting mrnas for degradation or translational repression. micrornas were first identified in caenorhabditis elegans  <cit>  but high evolutionary conservation eventually led to the identification of micrornas in other species. this, coupled with conventional sequencing of small rna libraries, has greatly expanded the list of known micrornas. the most recent release of the microrna database, mirbase  <dig>   <cit> , contains over  <dig> microrna gene loci in a wide variety of animal, plant and viral genomes.

conventional sequencing favors identification of highly expressed species, and comparative genomics will not identify nonconserved micrornas. in order to enhance discovery of small rna species, massively parallel signature sequencing  was used to identify small rnas in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , and the results showed that the diversity of small rnas exceeded previous estimates. more recently, newer deep sequencing technologies have been used to profile micrornas in arabidopsis dicer and rdr <dig> mutants  <cit> , and others have applied this technology to various samples including human and chimpanzee brain  <cit>  and chlamydomonas reinhardtii  <cit> . these approaches have the advantage that they not only provide sequence of low abundance species, but also provide quantitative data since the frequency of sequencing reads reflects the abundance of micrornas in the population.

we previously reported on the use of deep sequencing technologies for identification of micrornas encoded by marek's disease virus , an economically important pathogenic herpesvirus of chickens  <cit> . in an extension of the pilot study, we sequenced additional reads from both mdv-infected chicken embryo fibroblasts  and uninfected cef and now report on the identification of potential novel host micrornas. in addition, the sequence of several new mdv-encoded micrornas were discovered by deeper sequencing.

RESULTS
small rna libraries
we obtained  <dig>  reads from two small rna libraries prepared from uninfected cef or cef infected with mdv. as shown in table  <dig>  a total of  <dig>  reads contained both adapters used in creating the library, and  <dig>  of these high quality reads showed an exact match to the chicken genome. a total of  <dig>  reads from the mdv-infected cef library matched the mdv genome. the presence of other small rnas  was relatively small .

1trna, rrna, mtrna, snrna

the majority  of the small rnas match to known or predicted chicken micrornas . of the  <dig> distinct gallus gallus  entries in mirbase, we found  <dig> distinct species expressed in cef. there were  <dig> matches from the mdv-infected cef library and  <dig> matches from the uninfected cef library. the infected cells showed slightly more complexity in microrna diversity, which may be in part due to the larger number of reads obtained from the infected cef library which increases the chances of revealing low abundance micrornas. there were  <dig> micrornas in the infected cells that were not found in the uninfected cefs and  <dig> micrornas found in the uninfected cefs that were not found in the infected cells. an additional eleven chicken homologs of known micrornas were identified . the size distribution of reads was not significantly different in the two libraries, and the majority of the reads had lengths of 21â€“ <dig> nt .

microrna profiling by analysis of read counts
the number of reads obtained should reflect the relative abundance and expression levels of the micrornas. after scaling for total number of reads obtained for each library, the majority of micrornas were found at similar levels in the two libraries. a few micrornas  showed a greater than two-fold difference in the number of reads between the infected and uninfected cef libraries. we found mir-29b and mir- <dig> at higher levels in the mdv-infected cells, and three of the let <dig> micrornas were found at lower levels in the mdv-infected cef compared to the uninfected cef. northern blot analysis did not detect these differences, but this could be because of the low read numbers or because of cross hybridization with micrornas with similar sequences .

data shown are micrornas with more than  <dig> reads in one library and 2-fold difference in read count, after scaling for total number of reads matching the chicken genome in each library.

the most frequently sequenced  micrornas are found at remarkably similar levels in the two libraries . consistent with findings in our pilot study  <cit> , the highest number of reads was obtained for gga-mir- <dig> and  <dig>  these are clustered on chromosome  <dig> , and in the chicken there are two copies of mir- <dig> in the cluster, which could account for the higher number of mir- <dig> reads. we also see high levels of gga-mir-125b/148a/ <dig> and  <dig> 

data shown are micrornas with more than  <dig> reads in one library and 2-fold difference in read count, after scaling for total number of reads matching the chicken genome in each library.

viral micrornas
we previously identified ten mdv-encoded micrornas in a pilot sequencing project of the mdv-infected cef library  <cit> . the deep sequencing revealed an additional seven micrornas and '*' strands . four of the new micrornas map to the previously identified lat cluster , two are in the cluster upstream of the meq gene , one is downstream of the meq gene , and one is antisense to the coding region of the ribonucleotide reductase gene . .

potential novel micrornas
about 10% of the reads matched the chicken genome but not other known small rnas and were considered candidates for novel micrornas. the presence of hairpin structures containing these reads was evaluated using rnafold  <cit> , and those present in hairpins were further filtered according to established criteria  <cit> . first, the candidate microrna is entirely within the arm of the hairpin that has the lowest free energy among all sliding windows containing the candidate microrna. second, at least sixteen of  <dig> nucleotides of the candidate microrna must match the other arm of the hairpin. third, the hairpin should not contain any large  internal loops or bulges. matches to repeats or regions of low complexity were eliminated. additional file  <dig> lists  <dig> candidate novel micrornas passing these criteria. uracil, which is preferentially found in the first position of known chicken micrornas, is also first in 48% of the candidate novels. none contain a seed sequence that is identical to already established microrna families. three of the candidates  are found in the same stem loop, making it likely that they are mature and '*' strands of premicrornas. one  is clustered  <dig> nt upstream of gga-mir-7- <dig>  and one  is immediately upstream of gga-let-7a- <dig> 

curiously, one of the potential novels  is found within the highly evolutionarily conserved coding region of dcgr <dig> , which interacts with drosha in the processing of pri-micrornas  <cit> .

the expression of several of these candidate micrornas was evaluated by northern blot analysis of different tissues . all hybridize to species the size of mature micrornas. some of the novel micrornas are expressed ubiquitously , while others show more selective expression . these micrornas show no sequence similarity to any known micrornas, with the exception of # <dig>  which is similar, but not identical to dre-mir- <dig>  and gga-mir- <dig> . the micrornas analyzed by northern blots were selected based on presence of star strand in sequencing data, presence in a cluster, or some level of sequence conservation with other species. other candidate micrornas in the list have not been evaluated.

expression of known host micrornas in mdv-induced tumors
there is a large and growing literature on microrna expression in tumors, and both up- and down-regulation have been observed, with microrna expression patterns reflecting the developmental history and lineage of neoplasms. we compared expression in mdv-induced tumors versus normal spleen tissue for selected host micrornas that were either differentially expressed based on the deep sequencing or that were interesting based on the literature. figure  <dig> shows that the expression of gga-mir-let  <dig>  199a- <dig>  26a, 181a, and - <dig> were all expressed at lower levels in tumors, compared to normal spleens, using either gga-mir- <dig> or u <dig> as a loading control; gga-mir- <dig> is slightly lower in tumors.

discussion
our deep sequencing approach to microrna discovery in the chicken confirms the expression of  <dig> known micrornas and identifies a pool of  <dig> candidate novel micrornas. the majority of the known chicken micrornas have been identified by sequence comparison with micrornas from other species  <cit> , and the expression of many has been confirmed by analysis of est data and in situ hybridization  <cit> . cloning from small rna libraries also validates the expression of micrornas. a recent study of chicken microrna cloning  <cit>  used conventional technology to confirm expression of  <dig> of the known chicken micrornas and identified one possible novel microrna. our study adds to the confirmation of expression of predicted micrornas, and greatly expands the list of potential novel micrornas in the chicken.

a large majority  of the reads from chicken cef small rna libraries matched known micrornas. similar numbers were obtained in deep sequencing of human brain  <cit> , where 80% of the reads matched known human micrornas. thus, it could be argued that we are approaching saturation of microrna discovery. however, it is possible that only highly and ubiquitously expressed micrornas have been found, and less abundant or tissue-specific micrornas may still be revealed by deep sequencing of different tissues. this is clearly the case in plants, where a large set of small rnas have been discovered by deep sequencing  <cit> . in an analysis of the human 'colorectal micrornaome', sage was used as a deep sequencing approach, and matches to  <dig> micrornas in mirbase were found, as well as  <dig> previously unrecognized microrna* strands and  <dig> candidate novels  <cit> . mpss analysis of mouse embryo small rna discovered over  <dig> potential novel micrornas, some of which are rodent specific  <cit> . we have identified a pool of  <dig> candidate novel chicken micrornas and have confirmed expression of several candidates by northern blot analysis. some are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, while others are more ubiquitously expressed. further analysis of these and other candidates with respect to temporal and tissue expression will be a first step to understanding function. overall, the deep sequencing approach to microrna discovery suggests that a significant number of novel micrornas remain to be discovered and characterized.

in addition to identifying novel chicken micrornas, deep sequencing of mdv infected cef has revealed previously uncharacterized mdv-encoded micrornas, bringing the total of mdv micrornas to  <dig>  other herpesviruses encode micrornas, and these are thought to play a role in immune evasion, apoptosis and cell cycle control  <cit> . mdv causes a well- characterized, virally induced t cell lymphoma of chickens and represents an excellent model system for analyzing the function of viral micrornas in the pathogenesis of cancer. many recent studies implicate micrornas as either tumor suppressors or oncogenes  <cit> , and host encoded micrornas can act in cis  or trans  to affect phenotypic changes  <cit> . moreover, virally infected cells are stressed, and it has been proposed that micrornas play an important role in the stress response  <cit> . a comparison of the reads of mdv-infected cef versus uninfected cef indicates that the majority of the micrornas are expressed at similar levels. however, cef are used to propagate virus, and viral infection occurs in a very small percentage of cells, thus making it difficult to observe changes when analyzing whole cultures. in addition, cef are not the in vivo target of the virus, and we might expect a more critical layer of regulation in t cells. a small set of micrornas appeared to be differentially expressed in infected vs. uninfected cells, but this was not confirmed by northern blot analysis. this lack of concordance between the two techniques is not uncommon when expression levels are very low, or when cross-hybridization with similar species can confound the results. additionally, in our system, mdv infects only a small percentage of the cells and infections vary considerably from culture to culture. this biological noise could also hamper the ability to reproduce differences noted in the sequencing data set.

the two most frequently sequenced micrornas were gga-mir- <dig> and - <dig>  which also share sequence identity in the seed region. these are located within a  <dig> nt region of chromosome  <dig>  where there are two copies of gga-mir- <dig> followed by one copy of gga-mir- <dig>  in human, mir- <dig> and - <dig> are coordinately expressed from a single primary transcript  <cit> . we see about  <dig> -fold higher abundance of ggg-mir- <dig> compared to gga-mir- <dig>  consistent with their sharing a transcript that is highly expressed in cef. computational analysis has predicted that p27kip <dig> protein, a key inhibitory regulator of the cell cycle  <cit> , is a potential target for this cluster. down regulation of p27kip <dig> by mir-221/ <dig> promotes growth and proliferation of cancer cells, and could play a similar role in dividing cef  <cit> . mir-125b and  <dig> were also abundant in our libraries. mir-125b is critical for the proliferation of some human cell lines  <cit> , and mir- <dig> is thought to function as an oncogene by decreasing apoptosis  <cit> . the high levels in rapidly dividing cef could play a permissive role in the cell cycle in cef.

our northern analysis of mdv-induced tumors shows several host micrornas that were noticeably less abundant in mdv-induced tumor tissue compared to normal spleen, consistent with previous reports of a general down-regulation of micrornas in tumors  <cit> . among those down regulated, let <dig> was particularly interesting. the let <dig> microrna is known to down-regulate hmga <dig>  <cit> , which is a small, non-histone, chromatin-associated protein that is believed to influence chromatin remodeling  <cit> . hmga <dig> is expressed robustly in undifferentiated proliferating cells, and its expression during embryogenesis and in a variety of benign and malignant tumors has been characterized  <cit> . down-regulation of let <dig> should lead to increased expression of hmga- <dig>  and such a scenario would be consistent with the cell proliferation that characterizes tumors. mir- <dig> is considered a tumor suppressor  <cit> , which acts by targeting bcl- <dig>  and repressed expression is consistent with tumorigenesis. mir-181s were down-regulated in gliobastoma compared to normal brain controls  <cit> , and mir-199a was down-regulated in hepatocelluar carcinoma  <cit> . thus, it is likely that in mdv-induced tumors, as in other tumors, many micrornas act collectively to facilitate cellular transformation and proliferation. more information on the perturbations of host micrornas will come from a deep sequencing analysis of micrornas in tumors.

CONCLUSIONS
understanding the biological function of micrornas first requires identification of all micrornas within a genome. here we have described the application of deep sequencing technology for the identification of many candidate novel chicken micrornas from a single tissue source. the application of this technology to other tissues will no doubt lead to the identification of other novel micrornas, which will improve the annotation of the chicken genome and further our understanding of this important class of regulatory molecules.
