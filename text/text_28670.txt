BACKGROUND
pr <dig> proteins belong to the huge family of pathogenesis related  proteins ubiquitous in the plant kingdom. pr proteins were first identified as defence molecules produced in response to pathogen attack and some of them actually display an antimicrobial activity. however, numerous studies have reported their induction under a great variety of abiotic stress conditions as well as possible constitutive or developmentally regulated expression  <cit> . sharing common biochemical characteristics  pr proteins are divided into seventeen different groups based on their primary structure, serological relationships and biological activity  <cit> . most of them are extracellular, but some others are found in the cytoplasm, mainly in the vacuole. pr <dig> proteins present the specificity to be free in the cytoplasm and are therefore classified as intracellular pr  proteins. they are closely related to a group of major tree pollen allergens and food allergens, that belong to the bet v 1-like superfamily  <cit> .

pr <dig> genes form multigene families with low intraspecific variation and higher interspecific variation that make them interesting phylogenetic markers  <cit> . some of them were shown to be organized in chromosome clusters  <cit> . characterised in a number of plant species, most pr <dig> genes share an open reading frame  from  <dig> to  <dig> bp interrupted by an intron of 76- <dig> bp at a highly conserved position  <cit> . this orf codes for an acidic small protein with conserved sequence features: three amino acids e <dig>  e <dig> and y <dig>  possibly involved in ribonucleasic activity and two other remarkable domains comprising the motif gxggxgxxk  that forms a p-loop supposed to have ntpase activity and the bet v  <dig> motif  characteristic of proteins from the bet v  <dig> superfamily  <cit> .

the significance of multiple close copies of a gene in a single plant species has to be clarified. in birch or yellow lupine, some pr <dig> genes are constitutively expressed while others are induced under pathogen attack, abiotic stress or during plant development, suggesting functional diversification  <cit> . a significant common feature of pr <dig> proteins is a large y-shaped hydrophobic cavity, as shown by the determination of three-dimensional structure  <cit> . this internal cavity could be responsible for the intracellular transport of apolar ligands, so diverse as fatty acids, flavonoids, cytokinins or brassinosteroids  <cit> . slight modifications of the structure and shape of this cavity would allow to bind different ligands, what could account for the diverse roles hypothesised for pr <dig> proteins in plant defence and development  <cit> .

to date, three different pr <dig> genes have been described in vitis vinifera. vvpr <dig>  was shown to be up-regulated during a pathogen interaction with pseudomonas syringae in the cultivar ugni blanc  <cit> , while the expression of vvpr <dig> , vvpr <dig>  and vvpr <dig>  was detected during somatic embryogenesis  induction in the cultivar chardonnay  <cit> . moreover, several studies showed a strong and specific production of pr <dig> proteins in v. vinifera under salt or herbicide stress  <cit> , as well as after fungal attack  <cit> .

the recent publication of the whole genome sequence of v. vinifera by the genoscope  <cit>  and the instituto agrario san michele all'adige   <cit>  makes genome scale analyses possible. using these databases, we characterised all sequences of the pr <dig> gene family of v. vinifera and monitored the expression of nine candidate genes in various tissues and conditions.

RESULTS
in silico identification of v. vinifera pr <dig> related sequences
we searched for all v. vinifera pr <dig> related sequences in the whole genomic sequence published by the genoscope. an automatic list of chromosome regions containing pr <dig> and pr10-like gene annotations was produced. after correction for mis- and redundant annotations, ten sequences with a complete orf were retained, comprising vvpr <dig>  and vvpr <dig> , previously identified  and the recently described vvpr <dig>  gene   <cit> . three additional incomplete sequences corresponded to pseudogenes. all thirteen sequences were arranged in a tandem array on the chromosome  <dig>  on both sides of this cluster, we could identify four more pr <dig> related sequences, omitted by automatic annotation. no additional sequence was retrieved by a further homology search, suggesting that all v. vinifera pr <dig> genes are grouped in this single cluster, approximately  <dig>  pb long and limited by putative genes not related to pr <dig> genes. the seventeen pr <dig> related sequences were named s <dig> to s <dig> and numbered according to their position on the chromosome regardless the strand they were located on : the twelve first  and the last one  on the minus  strand of the chromosome, and s <dig> to s <dig> on the plus  strand. vvpr <dig> , vvpr <dig>  and vvpr <dig>  respectively correspond to s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  all genoscope references and precise locations are given in the additional file  <dig>  the seventeen sequences collected from the genoscope  were compared to their counterparts in the iasma database , which are scattered on fifteen different scaffolds . each sequence was less than 2% divergent from its counterpart, highlighting a high similarity between the two genomes and databases.

characterisation and comparison of nucleotide sequences
the putative exon-intron structure of the seventeen pr <dig> related sequences was determined . each sequence is interrupted by a single intron at a very well conserved position, presenting consensus motifs at the 5' and 3' boundaries with exons . the hypothetical cds are  <dig> to  <dig> bp long. the length of exons is well conserved, except for s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  which are shortened by a premature stop codon suggesting that they are pseudogenes. in addition, s <dig> presents a single nucleotide deletion in the first exon, which induces a frame shift definitely compromising a correct translation. the structure of the fourteen sequences with a complete orf is in accordance with previous reports on vitis vinifera and other plant pr <dig> genes  <cit> .

the cds were aligned for comparison. the percentages of nucleotide similarity are given in figure  <dig>  all sequences are very similar and show at least 48% of nucleotide similarity. a very high similarity  was found between the six sequences s11-s <dig>  including vvpr <dig>  and vvpr <dig> , that are also strongly similar to s10-vvpr <dig>  , together forming a group of closely related sequences. the sequence of the pseudogene s <dig> is also remarkably similar to s <dig> . the intron sequence is more variable and the similarity percentages range from  <dig> to 100%, being very high for the seven sequences s10-s <dig> comprising vvpr <dig> , vvpr <dig>  and vvpr <dig>  on one hand, and for s <dig> and s <dig> on the other hand .

prediction of expression
in order to determine whether the newly identified pr <dig> related sequences could be functional genes, we searched for related expressed sequence tags  in the databases . consistent with the prediction of s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> as pseudogenes, no est was found to match these incomplete sequences. in addition, we found no est corresponding to s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> nor s <dig>  suggesting that these sequences would not be transcribed, at least in the tissues and conditions reported in the databases. on the contrary, numerous different ests  were found to match s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> with up to 99% nucleotide similarity. although some of them also matched the highly homologous vvpr <dig> , vvpr <dig>  and vvpr <dig> , the expression of which was reported  <cit> , other ests were closer to s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  that would therefore be expressed in varied reproductive and/or vegetative tissues. several ests corresponding to s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> were also found . although a single incomplete est  matched s <dig>  its sequence was 100% similar to the sequence of s <dig>  moreover, this est covered the last  <dig> nucleotides of the cds and 3'utr, which are usually the most varying parts of a gene sequence, suggesting that this est is a specific partial transcript of s <dig>  the ests matching s <dig> and s <dig> with up to 99% similarity and 100% coverage argue for the expression of these two sequences. using the gene finding program, a correct gene structure was predicted for the seven sequences s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  in addition to vvpr <dig> , vvpr <dig>  and vvpr <dig>  . all possess the well positioned tata-box, transcription starting site  and polyadenylation signal, defining a cds of 477- <dig> bp. no promoter was found for s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  when a manual search was performed, no tss-motif was detectable for these sequences, but a tata-box was identified for s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> at the respective positions - <dig> , - <dig> and - <dig> nucleotides. on the whole, in addition to the three well characterised v. vinifera pr <dig> genes, seven pr <dig> related sequences showed the canonical transcription signals, suggesting their possible expression, although no specific est was found to match s <dig> nor s <dig>  in contrast, s <dig> and s <dig> did not show the features usually described for effective transcription, but some specific ests were identified in the databases, indicating their probable expression. finally, s <dig> and s <dig> showed no usual transcription signals, and no est was found to match these two sequences.

blast results were obtained for the putative cds of the seventeen sequences using the vitis est database of ncbi. the number of ests indicates the number of matching results for each query. the percentage of coverage indicates the relative length of coverage of the sequence by the best matching est. the percentage of nucleotide similarity is given for the best matching est. f = flowers; l = leaves; r = roots; be = berries; bu = buds.

characterisation of deduced pr <dig> proteins and phylogenetic analysis
the nucleotide sequences with a complete orf were named according to usual nomenclature. the highly similar sequences vvpr <dig> , s <dig> and s <dig> on one hand, and vvpr <dig> , s <dig> and s <dig> on the other hand  were named vvpr <dig> -a, -b and -c, and vvpr <dig> -a, -b and -c, respectively. the other sequences were named vvpr <dig>  to vvpr <dig>  for s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  respectively, following increasing divergence from the group of vvpr <dig> -a to vvpr <dig> -c sequences. putative protein sequences were deduced from nucleotide sequences, analysed and compared. all proteins are 158- <dig> aa long , have a calculated molecular mass ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kda and a theoretical pi from  <dig>  to  <dig> , consistent with usual plant pr <dig> features  <cit> . apart from few exceptions mentioned in the figure legend, all sequences present the three characteristic amino acids thought to be implied in ribonucleasic activity: e <dig>  e <dig> and y <dig>  the characteristic p-loop motif  described in various species and corresponding to the consensus sequence gxggxgxxk, and the bet v  <dig> motif which is the signature for the pathogenesis-related proteins bet v  <dig> family  <cit> . the predictive three-dimensional structure of the deduced proteins was determined. as for pr <dig>  , all proteins would be composed of three alpha-helices and a seven-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet arranged to form a large internal hydrophobic cavity. nine short loops connect the secondary elements. this conformation is in accordance with the crystal structure determined for plant pr <dig> proteins in cherry, yellow lupine, birch and celery  <cit> . all these observations suggest correct structure and folding for the eleven putative v. vinifera pr <dig> proteins in addition to pr <dig> , pr <dig>  and pr <dig>  .

a phylogenetic tree shows the relationships between v. vinifera pr <dig> proteins and representatives of the main pr <dig> subfamilies in other plants: mal d  <dig> and pru p  <dig> subfamilies i-iv in malus domestica  <cit>  and prunus persica  <cit> , bet v  <dig> subfamilies i-iii and v in betula pendula  <cit>  and llpr <dig> subclasses i and ii in lupinus luteus  <cit>  . in each species, pr <dig> proteins tend to form one  or two clades , showing a low intraspecific and a higher interspecific variation, as previously described  <cit> . in a first clade, v. vinifera pr <dig> proteins are subdivided into two distinct homogeneous groups: pr <dig> -a to pr <dig> -c with more than 79% of amino acid identity and pr <dig>  to pr <dig>  with more than 81% of amino acid identity. these two groups of tightly phylogenetically connected proteins are closer to birch bet v  <dig> than to pr <dig> proteins of other plant species, and are undoubtedly distant from the four other v. vinifera pr <dig> proteins, pr <dig>  to pr10- <dig> 

expression of v. vinifera candidate pr <dig> genes
the possible expression of ten out of the fourteen complete pr <dig> sequences was assessed in various non-treated tissues of v. vinifera cv. chardonnay, as well as during secondary somatic embryogenesis. it was not possible to design specific primers for the detection of vvpr <dig> -b and -c and vvpr <dig> -b and -c transcripts, because of very high similarity with vvpr <dig> -a and vvpr <dig> -a transcripts respectively, even in the 5' and 3' utrs.

nine different genes were expressed in the tissues analysed, vvpr <dig>  transcripts being undetectable in any condition . moreover, vvpr <dig>  and vvpr <dig>  transcripts were only weakly detected in a few tissues.

in intact tissues, all nine pr <dig> genes were expressed, depending on the plant organ. in roots, the expression of all genes except vvpr <dig>  was detected, although vvpr <dig>  transcription was very weak. at the opposite, vvpr <dig>  transcription was high in leaves, while vvpr <dig>  and vvpr <dig>  transcripts were not detected; all other genes were expressed at varied levels. in stems, vvpr <dig> , vvpr <dig> -a and vvpr <dig>  were the only clearly expressed genes. immature flowers expressed all genes except vvpr <dig>  and vvpr <dig> . in non-treated somatic embryos, vvpr <dig> -a, vvpr <dig> -a and vvpr <dig>  transcripts were weakly detected, while vvpr <dig>  transcription was clear.

the  <dig> -d treatment of embryos used for induction of secondary somatic embryogenesis increased the expression of vvpr <dig> -a, vvpr <dig> -a, vvpr <dig>  and vvpr <dig>  but not vvpr <dig>  and vvpr <dig> . the expression of vvpr <dig>  was also weakly stimulated. on the other hand, vvpr <dig>  transcription was weakly detectable in intact embryos but not at all in tissues derived from  <dig> -d-treated embryos. vvpr <dig>  expression was not detected in non-treated or treated embryos.

discussion
we found a total of seventeen pr <dig> related sequences in the whole v. vinifera genome. thirteen unique sequences were retained from an automatic search that initially produced ninety regions, reflecting redundancy of the database as well as annotation errors partly due to wrong homology detection. a manual search allowed the recovery of four additional pr <dig> related sequences. all seventeen sequences were found in a single compact cluster on the chromosome  <dig>  plant pr <dig> belong to multigene families. there are at least five pr <dig> genes in pea  <cit> , eighteen mal d  <dig> genes in apple  <cit> , ten bet v  <dig> genes in birch  <cit> , eight fra a  <dig> genes in strawberry  <cit> , six pr <dig> genes in solanum surattense  <cit> , eight in yellow lupine  <cit> , five in rice  <cit> , and eight pru p  <dig> and pru d  <dig> genes in peach and almond, respectively  <cit> . they were shown to form physical clusters in apple  <cit>  and peach  <cit> . poplar pr <dig> genes are also supposed to be grouped on chromosomes  <cit> . tandem duplicates are frequent in plant genomes and represent up to 16% of arabidopsis genes  <cit> . such gene clusters are thought to be produced by successive single gene or small-scale duplications. we found that thirteen out of the seventeen v. vinifera pr <dig> sequences are present on the chromosome in direct orientation, suggesting that most copies were produced by unequal crossing over events, as described in arabidopsis and rice  <cit> .

following duplication, new copies of a gene may undergo modifications allowing functional diversification, which is a significant source of evolutionary novelty in plants  <cit> . however, gene duplication mostly creates copies that are rapidly lost through pseudogenisation. as a result, from numerous homologous sequences coexisting in a genome, only a part are functional genes. from the seventeen v. vinifera pr <dig> sequences, only fourteen have an intact orf. in birch, the copy number of pr <dig> genes varies from twelve to twenty-five, depending on the species, and pseudogenes represents as much as one-third of betula nigra alleles  <cit> . in v. vinifera, the pseudogenes s <dig> and s <dig> share the highest nucleotide similarity with vvpr <dig>  , suggesting that they could derive from its duplication. likewise, s <dig> is closer to vvpr <dig>   than to all other sequences and could therefore originate from its duplication. moreover, s <dig> and vvpr <dig>  are also very similar at the intron level , indicative of possible recent duplication or slow pseudogenisation.

apart from pseudogenes, sequence divergence is generally reduced in pr <dig> multigene families. pr <dig> genes within a species are generally very similar and more distant from gene copies of other plant species  <cit> . such a low intraspecific variability has been observed in passiflora  <cit>  and in the betula genus  <cit> . the different paralogs are thought to undergo strong concerted evolution which is the tendency of a family of repeated genes to jointly evolve. the close physical proximity of tandem duplicates facilitates gene conversion or unequal crossing-over events leading to concerted evolution  <cit> . the phylogenetic tree in figure  <dig> illustrates probable concerted evolution in the v. vinifera pr <dig> family. however, v. vinifera pr <dig> proteins divide into two clades interrupted by pr <dig> of other plants, indicating partial independent evolution. interestingly, the seven sequences s <dig> to s <dig> corresponding to the very homologous proteins pr <dig> -a to pr <dig> -c follow one another on the chromosome, what could favor concerted evolution and suggest strong local selection pressure. however, it cannot be ruled out that recent duplication events produced these seven very homologous sequences.

grapes, as other eudicot species, probably originate from an ancient hexaploid ancestor formed through whole genome duplication  events  <cit> . recurrent polyploidisation is tightly linked to evolution in angiosperms, providing raw materials for gene diversification and genome refinement, and coinciding with species radiation  <cit> . a wgd is followed by incomplete and asymmetric loss of gene copies and chromosome rearrangements allowing the recovery of a diploid-like state compatible with effective reproduction. in arabidopsis, it was possible to track gene pairs released by a recent specific wgd event  <cit> . only  <dig> % of gene pairs were retained from the transient tetraploid genome, the other pairs having lost a copy from one of the homeologous chromosomes. in v. vinifera, pr <dig> sequences were solely located on the chromosome  <dig>  suggesting loss of some of the triplicate ancestral copies and/or translocation on a unique chromosome. the seventeen present pr <dig> sequences are most probably due to repetitive small duplications having continuously occurred during v. vinifera evolution. subsequent mutations and possible positive selection are responsible for the observed divergence within the sequences. however, at least a part of v. vinifera pr <dig> sequences are probably subjected to concerted evolution, reducing variability and hampering the identification of putative triplicate ancestral copies.

we were able to detect the expression of nine out of the fourteen complete pr <dig> related sequences in varied non-treated and treated tissues of v. vinifera cv. chardonnay. three genes, i.e. vvpr <dig> -a, vvpr <dig>  and vvpr <dig> -a, were already shown to be expressed under pathogen attack or abiotic stress, and during somatic embryogenesis induction  <cit> , whereas expression of vvpr <dig> -vvpr <dig>  was never studied before. vvpr <dig>  transcripts were not detectable in our conditions. this sequence has no corresponding est in the databases and lacks canonical transcription signals. however, expression could be limited to very specific tissues and/or developmental stages. although specific ests in the databases suggest a probable expression of the four sequences vvpr <dig> -b and -c and vvpr <dig> -b and -c, the distinction of each transcription product would require more sensitive methods than pcr, such as cdna-aflp or sscp, which were used for discriminate highly homologous sequences in potato, polyploid cotton and barley  <cit> . the expression of vvpr <dig> , vvpr <dig>  and vvpr <dig>  is not surprising because well matching ests were found in the databases. on the contrary, no est was found to correspond to vvpr <dig> , vvpr <dig>  and vvpr <dig> , whose expression is therefore reported for the first time. interestingly, vvpr <dig> , vvpr <dig>  and vvpr <dig>  are expressed although devoid of canonical transcription signals.

we found transcripts of all nine pr <dig> genes in varying amounts, in the different non-treated tissues analysed, suggesting a role apart from defence. specific expression profiles were found in intact tissues, except for vvpr <dig>  and vvpr <dig> -a. stems and intact embryos expressed a reduced subset of pr <dig> proteins. on the contrary, immature flowers expressed a large subset of pr <dig> genes, suggesting a possible role of some pr <dig> proteins during sexual reproduction. no v. vinifera pr <dig> gene was solely expressed in calli derived from  <dig> -d-treated embryos. however, expression of several genes was enhanced in these tissues, at least weakly. somatic embryogenesis is generally obtained from tissues subjected to the auxin  <dig> -d, which acts as a stress factor able to trigger the reprogramming of plant somatic cells towards embryogenesis  <cit> . as a consequence, high amounts of defence proteins are produced following a  <dig> -d treatment, as shown in grapevine cultures  <cit> . consistent with the results reported here, we previously showed that varied pr genes including vvpr <dig> -a and vvpr <dig> -a are up-regulated during secondary somatic embryogenesis induction in v. vinifera  <cit> . vvpr <dig>  expression was also previously reported to be induced in whole plant leaves challenged with the incompatible bacterium pseudomonas syringae  <cit> . interestingly, vvpr <dig>  and vvpr <dig>  were not responsive to  <dig> -d treatment.

on the whole, various expression patterns were found for v. vinifera pr <dig> genes, indicating functional diversification and possible tissue specificity. likewise, in other plants, pr <dig> proteins show expression diversity suggesting various biological activities  <cit> . a major feature of pr <dig> proteins is their internal hydrophobic cavity with openings at the protein surface. several three-dimensional modeling studies showed that this structure is suitable for the binding and transport of diverse hydrophobic ligands as brassinolides  <cit>  or homocastasterone  <cit> . some birch and yellow lupine pr <dig> can bind diverse molecules such as cytokinins, brassinosteroids, fatty acids and flavonoids, suggesting that they could interfere with the trafficking of hormones inside the cell  <cit> . moreover, overexpression of a pr <dig> gene in pea led to a change in the ratio between cytokinins and abscisic acid, showing that the pr <dig> content could be relevant for intracellular hormone regulation  <cit> . although all crystallographic models for pr <dig> proteins share the same canonical fold, their superimposition can reveal structural differences  <cit> . remarkably, the volume of the internal cavity and of its openings can show some variability, what could influence the type of transported ligand. in yellow lupine, different shapes for the inducible llpr <dig> a and the constitutive llpr <dig> b could account for their different biological roles  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the availability of the complete genome sequence of v. vinifera allowed us to characterise the pr <dig> gene family. seventeen different pr <dig> related sequences including three pseudogenes were identified and located in a single compact cluster on the chromosome  <dig>  most probably reflecting repetitive small duplications during evolution. a phylogenetic analysis showed a characteristic low variability within the different sequences, especially within seven sequences closely located on the chromosome, suggesting probable concerted evolution. we could analyse the expression of nine genes in various tissues. different expression patterns indicate functional specialisation. several genes showed a typical stress induced up-regulation. further experiments will help to elucidate the differential regulation of v. vinifera pr <dig> gene expression.
