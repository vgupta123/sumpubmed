BACKGROUND
gossypium contains nine different genome groups comprising approximately  <dig> species whose phylogenetic relationships have been well-studied  <cit> . the a-, d-, and ad-genome groups have received special attention, as four different species  have been domesticated for their abundant seed trichomes. these species collectively provide the foundation for the textile industry worldwide, with most cotton today deriving from g. hirsutum, or upland cotton. relationships among genome groups have been quantified in several studies, and the closest living relatives of the diploid genome donors to allopolyploid cotton have been identified  <cit> . the diploid donor of the allopolyploid at genome , was a species much like modern g. arboreum or g. herbaceum, whereas the allopolyploid dt genome is derived from a progenitor similar to modern g. raimondii. these well-established relationships provide a phylogenetic framework to investigate the evolution of gene expression both in terms of domesticated fiber production and polyploidy.

microarrays are a powerful method to simultaneously measure relative expression levels for thousands of genes and they may be composed of cdna inserts, short oligonucleotides, or long oligonucleotides. the advantages and disadvantages of each of these probe types have been extensively reviewed  <cit>  we chose to create a long oligonucleotide microarray for cotton because of its low manufacturing cost, flexibility in design, homogeneous melting temperatures , and relative ease of adding probes. a small est assembly  was previously used to generate oligonucleotide probes for cotton fiber  <cit> . a larger scale est assembly  was recently produced as a community-wide effort by cotton researchers  <cit> . subsequent additions of cotton ests to genbank  have been compiled into a large est assembly   <cit> . these two assemblies constitute nearly all of the known genic sequence from cotton. similar large-scale est assemblies have been successfully used to design oligonucleotide microarrays for functional genomics investigations in model plants  and non-model plants .

here we describe the design and creation and of a publicly available oligonucleotide microarray for cotton. synthetic oligonucleotide probes were generated from the sequences of two different assemblies of cotton ests representing more than  <dig> different cdna libraries and many different tissue types and tissue treatments  <cit>  to illustrate their utility on printed microarray slides, we hybridized labeled bud and leaf cdnas from g. hirsutum, and demonstrate technical consistency of results. as many of these est sequences were derived from a fiber-specific cdna library, this array also has direct application for analysis of the fiber transcriptome.

RESULTS
microarray design
we created an oligonucleotide microarray for cotton using fiber genes in genbank, a reported est assembly of > <dig>  ests  <cit> , and a recent assembly of > <dig>  ests  <cit>  as templates for probe design. from these sequences, we designed three sets of oligonucleotide probes  and included all three sets  on a single, publicly available microarray  <cit> . the first set of  <dig>  oligonucleotide probes was designed from cotton ests with homology to arabidopsis genes with roles as regulators of chromatin, transcription, cell wall biosynthesis, and cell cycle  <cit> .

the second set of oligonucleotides probes was designed from an exemplar sequence set  <cit>  using picky v <dig>   <cit> . an exemplar sequence refers to an example gene  chosen from a clustered set of unigenes by single-linkage clustering with blastn  <cit> . picky prioritized the unique sequence of the identified oligonucleotide probes while maintaining a uniform probe-target melting temperature.  <dig>  oligonucleotides  with a relatively small range of melting temperatures  were selected from a large list of candidate probes. this list of targeted genes includes genes requested by members of cotton research community, a large number of transcription factors, and several thousand genes that had homology to arabidopsis genes  .

1oligonucleotides  were designed at texas a&m university in the former lab of dr. chen  <cit> . 2oligos designed at iowa state university from a global assembly of ests  <cit> . 3oligos designed by the institute for genomic research  from the cotton gene index  <dig>  <cit> . 4column totals are close approximations since each oligo set was designed separately. 5arabidopsis matches are based on oligo wublastx hits to the tair arabidopsis protein dataset and parsed for  <dig> aa length and 50% percent identity. 6transcription factor sub-total may be an over-estimate as biological processes and molecular function are not mutually exclusive categories. 7biological process = transcription. 8molecular function = nucleic acid binding activity, nucleotide binding activity, rna and dna binding activity, and transcription factor activity. 9putative pfam tf identified in the 2nd oligo set were in addition to those annotated by gene ontology.

the third set ofoligonucleotides probes was designed from cgi <dig>  <cit>  that contained  <dig>  unique sequences using picky v <dig> . where possible, identical picky parameters were used to design the 3rd oligonucleotide set as the 2nd set. probes that targeted the same genes as in the first two probe sets were excluded from further analysis. in total,  <dig>  additional oligonucleotides probeswere generated  and added to the previous  <dig> probe sets.

two essential considerations of microarray quality include the number of targeted genes and the broad utility of the microarray for specific tissues or treatments. regarding the first consideration, the  <dig>  genes described here include perhaps 46–60% of the total genic diversity, given that the total number of genes in the cotton genome may be approximately  <dig> – <dig>   <cit> , indeed, 44% and 40% of the oligonucleotides were designed from singletons from the first  <cit>  and second  <cit>  assemblies, respectively. however, some probes were not completely target-specific, perhaps due to imperfect est assemblies and due to separate sets of probes designed from different assemblies. approximately  <dig>  of potential non-specific homologies were identified in the recent gene index of  <dig>  unigenes  <cit>  using vmatch  <cit>  with a ~95% sequence percent identity threshold. nevertheless, most of the oligonucleotides had a single target, as designed .

regarding the second consideration, these microarray probes have a broad utility for specific tissues or treatments. for example, a detailed analysis of the second probe set revealed that ~ <dig>  probes represented genes expressed in specific tissues or under specific conditions . the number of specifically expressed genes was determined by summing the number of contigs mostly composed of ests from a single library  and the corresponding singletons. in total, 56% of the 2nd oligonucleotide set represent genes from a specific library; however, a large number of those genes  are from the two g. raimondii libraries that were prepared from heterogeneous tissues and which were more deeply sampled that most of the other cotton cdna libraries. more than  <dig>  oligonucleotides appear to target genes found only in a 7– <dig> days post-anthesis fiber library  <cit> , and  <dig> appear to target transcripts uniquely identified following cyclohexamide treatment of ovules  <cit> . these two considerations suggest that the oligonucleotides selected for the cotton oligonucleotide microarray have a broad diagnostic utility while potentially targeting tissue-specific transcripts expressed under a variety of conditions. the sequences and annotations of all the probes are publicly available via a web-based query  <cit>  or by request.

microarray hybridizations
many potential sources of error can have a large impact on microarray experiments, such as inconsistency among multiple rna extractions, reverse transcription, rna amplification, and labeling, as well as different levels of background noise for each microarray. many of these sources of error can be resolved by appropriate experimental design  <cit> . and careful laboratory technique; however, the quality of the microarray must often be assumed and often is not under the control of the investigator. we investigated the oligonucleotide performance within the first version of the cotton microarray  containing the 1st and 2nd replicated spots printed for each probe in these two sets. we found a low level of within-microarray variation, reproducible 'self vs. self' hybridizations with bud tissue, and reproducible expression differences between bud and leaf treatments. the results from the first version of the cotton microarray suggest that the current version with  <dig>  additional probes will provide an robust, reproducible platform for transcription profiling in cotton.

variation within microarrays between the two replicate features was estimated for each oligonucleotide probe, as a consequence of including two microarray features for each oligonucleotide probe in two separate sections of the microarray. the average log-adjusted difference between two replicated features was  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>   for replications  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively . the slightly positive value of the average spot differences suggests that the first pin-touch on the microarray deposited slightly more oligonucleotide probe in a slightly larger spot on the slide than the second pin-touch.

we also demonstrated the reproducibility of the microarray by quantifying the amount of variation for these newly constructed cotton microarrays between two identical pooled 'treatments' of bud rna . on the individual microarrays, there was a high degree of correlation between the cy3-labeled bud rna and the cy5-labeled bud rna . when searching for expression differences between bud and bud' rna pools, no differences were detected at a relatively liberal false discovery rate of 20% .

finally, if we test for expression differences between the leaf rna pool and each of the bud rna pools , many genes were found to be consistently differentially expressed between bud vs. leaf and bud' vs. leaf, as seen by the high correlation among the most significant p-values . if our goal was to describe differentially expressed genes between leaf and bud, we would have a large list of putatively, differentially expressed genes ; however, in this particular case, we can only claim that these genes were differentially expressed between the two amplified rna samples considered in our experiment. we intentionally did not include biological replicates because our interest was in quantifying technical variation. biological replication would be necessary to conclude that the expression differences are inherent differences between leaf and bud rather than simply differences between the particular leaf rna pool and the particular bud and bud' rna pools prepared for this experiment.

because a global assembly of ests was used to design this first version of the microarray, genes expressed in many tissues of the plants including cotton fibers, are represented. a total of  <dig>  genes were found to be differentially expressed between our leaf rna pool and our bud rna pools .  of these differences, slightly less than 10% belonged to set of probes that had no blastx hit  and were designed solely based on an estscan prediction, thereby providing an element of functional gene discovery to the microarray. of the  <dig>  hypothetical genes that were differentially expressed,  <dig> were identified by probes derived from cotton fiber cdna libraries  <cit> ; ben burr, unpublished data; candace haigler, unpublished data). this number did not include probes designed for known cotton genes, nor other genes that were removed from the analysis  that may also represent genes specifically expressed in fiber tissue.

CONCLUSIONS
here we provide a detailed report of the design of long-oligonucleotide microarrays for cotton and illustrate their technical performance. proper design of microarray experiments for discovery of gene expression profiles requires biological replication  <cit>  because our goal was not to discover nor report novel gene expression profiles in leaves or buds, we restricted our replications to pools of technical replicates in this experiment. these cotton microarrays are publicly available  <cit> , and may continue to be augmented with additional oligonucleotides designed from subsequent ests assemblies. as a tool for functional genomics, the future use of these microarrays may uncover clues to the transcriptional regulation of cotton fiber and other tissues in properly replicated experimental designs.
