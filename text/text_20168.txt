BACKGROUND
copy number variation  is defined as a segment of dna that is 1kb or larger and present at a variable copy number in comparison with a reference genome  <cit> . so far, cnv has gained considerable interests as a source of genetic variation in many species. extensive studies have been performed to identify and map cnv in humans  <cit> , model organisms  <cit>  and domestic animals  <cit> . compared with the most frequent snp marker, cnvs cover wider genomic regions in terms of total bases involved and have potentially larger effects by changing gene structure and dosage, alternating gene regulation, exposing recessive alleles and other mechanisms  <cit> . cnvs have been shown to be important in both normal phenotypic variability and disease susceptibility  <cit>  and association studies of cnvs and diseases have become popular in human  <cit> . additionally, in animals, phenotype variations caused by cnvs were also observed, for instance, the white coat phenotype in pigs caused by the copy number variation of the kit gene  <cit>  and the pea-comb phenotype in chickens caused by the copy number variation in intron  <dig> of the sox <dig> gene  <cit> . these demonstrate that cnvs can be considered as promising markers for some economically important traits or diseases in domestic animals. thus, comprehensive identification and cataloging of cnvs will greatly benefit functional analyses of genome variation.

although pig is one of the most economically important worldwide livestock as well as a suitable animal model for human disease, few studies are focused on investigating cnv in pig compared to other species  <cit> . so far, there are merely two studies on pig cnv detection reported. fadista et al.  <cit>  addressed the first account of cnv survey  among  <dig> duroc boars using a custom tiling oligonucleotide array cgh approach. ramayo-caldas et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> cnvrs in  <dig> animals from an iberian x landrace cross using porcine snp <dig> beadchips. previous studies at genome scale suggest that cnvs comprise up to ~12%, 4% and  <dig> % of human <cit> , dog <cit>  and cattle  <cit>  genome sequence, respectively. compared with abundance of cnvrs detected in other species, cnvs detected in pig is far from saturation.

currently, cnvs can be identified using different technological approaches. two major platforms, i.e., comparative genomic hybridization  array and snp genotyping array, were extensively compared by redon et al.  <cit> . although cgh array based approach has excellent performance in signal-to-noise ratios, the snp genotyping array has the advantage of performing both genome-wide association studies  and cnv detection  <cit> . cgh arrays report only relative signal intensities, whereas snp arrays collect normalized total signal intensity  and allelic intensity ratios  which represent overall copy numbers and allelic contrasts  <cit> . snp arrays use less sample per experiment compared to cgh arrays, and it is a cost effective technique which allows users to increase the number of samples tested on a limited budget  <cit> . nowadays, snp arrays have been routinely used for cnv detection in human and other organisms  <cit> , and manufacturers of snp genotyping arrays have incorporated non-polymorphic markers into their snp genotyping arrays to improve the coverage of snp arrays for cnv analyses  <cit> .

in the present study, using the penncnv software  <cit> , a genome-wide cnv detection based on the porcine snp <dig> beadchip was performed in a large sample of  <dig> pigs from four breed populations with different genetic background. our study firstly provides a comprehensive map of cnvs in the pig genome, which would be helpful for understanding the genomic variation in the pig genome and provide preliminary foundation for investigating the association between various economically important phenotypes and cnvs.

RESULTS
genome-wide detection of cnvs
overall,  <dig>  cnvs were assessed by penncnv on  <dig> pairs of autosomal chromosomes. the average number of cnvs per individual was  <dig> . by aggregating overlapping cnvs, a total of  <dig> cnvrs  across genome were identified, which cover  <dig> mb of the pig genome and correspond to  <dig> % of the autosomal genome sequence. among these cnvrs, we found  <dig> loss,  <dig> gain and  <dig> both  events. the length of these cnvrs ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> .7kb with a mean of  <dig> kb and a median of  <dig> kb. the frequencies of these cnvrs ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> %. in particular, there were  <dig> cnvrs with frequency >5%, and  <dig> cnvrs >10%. figure  <dig> summarizes the location and characteristics of all cnvrs on autosomal chromosomes. it is obvious that these cnvrs are not uniformly distributed among different chromosomes. the proportion of cnvrs on the  <dig> pairs of autosomal chromosomes varies from  <dig> - <dig> %. chromosome  <dig> harbors the greatest number  of cnvrs, whereas chromosome  <dig> has the densest cnvrs with an average distance of  <dig> .94kb between cnvrs.

in this study, samples of four populations, including  <dig> yorkshire pigs,  <dig> landrace pigs,  <dig> songliao black pigs and  <dig> the duroc × erhualian crossbred pigs, were used. large difference of cnvr numbers were found among the four populations . in the duroc × erhualian crossbred, we identified  <dig> cnvrs, which comprised  <dig> % of the total cnvrs detected herein. in yorkshire,  <dig> cnvrs were detected, corresponding to nearly half of the total number , while only  <dig>  and  <dig>  cnvrs were found in landrace and songliao black, respectively.  <dig> unique cnvrs, i.e., cnvrs detected only in one population, were detected, including  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in duroc × erhualian crossbred, yorkshire, landrace and songliao black, respectively.

a cnvrs number means the total number found in one breed.

b unique cnvr means cnvr only detected in one breed.

gene content of pig cnvrs
totally,  <dig>  genes within the identified cnvrs were retrieved from the ensembl genes  <dig> database using the biomart data management system  <cit> , including  <dig>  protein-coding genes,  <dig> mirna,  <dig> pseudogenes,  <dig> snorna,  <dig> snrna,  <dig> rrna, six miscrna and one retrotransposed gene . these genes are distributed in  <dig>  cnvrs, while the other  <dig> cnvrs do not contain any annotated genes.

in order to provide insight into the functional enrichment of the cnvs, gene ontology   <cit>  and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes   <cit>  pathway analyses were performed with the david bioinformatics resources  <cit> . the go analyses revealed  <dig> go terms , of which  <dig> were statistically significant after benjamini correction. and the significant go terms were mainly involved in sensory perception of smell or chemical stimulus, olfactory receptor activity, g-protein coupled receptor protein signaling pathway, cell surface receptor linked signal transduction, and other basic metabolic processes. there were also some enriched charts with marginal significance, which were involved in antigen processing and presentation, mhc class ii protein complex, innate immune response and adaptive immune response. the kegg pathway analyses indicated that the genes in the cnvrs were enriched in eight pathways , of which six were statistically significant after benjamini correction, i.e., olfactory transduction, systemic lupus erythematosus, linoleic acid metabolism, drug metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, and metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome p <dig> 

additionally,  <dig> qtls , affecting a wide range of traits, such as growth, meat quality, reproduction, immune capacity and disease resistance, were found in  <dig> cnvrs by comparing the overlapping of cnvrs with qtls in the pig qtldb ).

cnv validation by qpcr
quantitative real time pcr  was used to validate  <dig> cnvrs chosen from the  <dig> cnvrs detected in the study. these  <dig> cnvrs represent different predicted status of copy numbers  and different cnvr frequencies . a total of  <dig> qpcr assays , i.e. two or three for every cnvr, were performed. out of the  <dig> qpcr assays,  <dig>  were in agreement with prediction by penncnv. when counting the cnvrs,  <dig>  out of the  <dig> cnvrs  had positive qpcr confirmations by at least one pcr assay. the average frequency and size of the  <dig> confirmed cnvrs were  <dig> % and  <dig> kb respectively, which were smaller than those of the six unconfirmed ones  .

a the sus scrofa assembly   was used to indicate the position of the cnvrs.

for the cnvrs with low frequencies we tested all the positive samples, while for the cnvrs with high frequencies we tested part of them. furthermore, a certain number of random negative samples were tested as negative control for every cnvr. for the positive samples of the  <dig> confirmed cnvrs, the proportions of confirmed samples varied from  <dig> % to 100%, with an average of  <dig> %. for the negative samples of the  <dig> confirmed cnvrs, the proportions of confirmed samples  varied from  <dig> to  <dig> %, with an average of  <dig> % . additionally, the copy numbers in some cnvrs varied among individuals. for example, we found one copy loss and different copy gain  in cnvr <dig> , and one and two copies loss in cnvr <dig> .

discussion
in our study, among the four populations, the largest number of total cnvrs and unique cnvrs were detected in the duroc × erhualian crossbred population. in addition to the larger sample size, another important reason is that this population has special genetic background. particularly, erhualian is one famous chinese indigenous breed. many previous studies have indicated that chinese indigenous pig breeds have different genetic background with western commercial breeds, such as duroc, landrace and yorkshire  <cit> . therefore, there are breed-specific cnvs in pigs, which is consistent with the report in cattle  <cit> . the differences of cnv among breeds supported that some cnvs are likely to generate independently in breeds and therefore, likely contribute to breed differences.

we compared our results with two previous reports on pig cnvs . ramayo-caldas et al.  <cit>  firstly used the porcine snp <dig> beadchip data of  <dig> animals from an iberian x landrace cross to identify cnvs in pig, and detected  <dig> cnvrs by at least two programs of cnvpartition , penncnv  <cit>  and gada  <cit> . twenty-two out of the  <dig> cnvrs  are identical or overlapped with our results. using the custom tiling oligonucleotide array cgh approach, fadista et al.  <cit>  addressed  <dig> cnvrs on the ssc <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of the preliminary assembly of pig genome among  <dig> duroc boars. however, only one cnvr of them was found overlapping with our results.

the potential reasons for the different results between this study and the other two studies lie in the following aspects. firstly, the study population differed in terms of size and genetic background in different studies. a much larger sample size with broader genetic background  were included in this study in comparison with the other two studies, where only one breed or crossbreed  with very small sample size were involved. secondly, different platforms, snp genotyping array and cgh array, are different in the calling technique, resolution difference and genome coverage which contribute to the discrepancy of cnvs detected. thirdly, previous studies showed that genomic waves have a significant interfere with accurate cnv detection  <cit> . genomic wave refers to the patterns of signal intensities across all chromosomes, where different samples may show highly variable magnitude of waviness. in our study, the genomic waves were adjusted using the -gcmodel option, while it was not in the study of ramayo-caldas et al.  <cit> . the issue of low overlapping rates between different reports was also encountered in cnv studies in other mammal  <cit> .

a large amount annotated genes  are located in the  <dig> identified cnvrs. the average number of genes per mb of the  <dig> cnvrs is  <dig> , which is larger than that on the whole genome  according to the sscrofa  <dig>  assembly in ensembl . it has been suggested that cnvs are located preferably in gene-poor regions  <cit> , probably because cnvs present in gene-rich regions may be deleterious and therefore removed by purifying selection  <cit> . in contrast to it, the larger number of genes in the identified cnvrs probably reflects the fact that the porcine snp <dig> beadchip used in this study is biased toward the gene-rich regions. functional analyses, such as go, pathway and overlapping with qtls in pig qtldb, suggest that these genes entail a great variety of molecular functions, making them a promising resource for exploring the genetic basis of phenotypic variation within and among breeds. especially, consistent with cnv studies in human, mouse, cattle, and dog  <cit> , some of the enriched go terms, such as drug detoxification, innate and adaptive immunity, and receptor and signal recognition, are also present in pigs. conservation of some cnvs across different species suggests that selective pressure may tend to favor specific gene dosage changes, and genes involved in these cnvs may affect the adaptability and fitness of an organism in response to external pressures  <cit> .

most of our cnvrs were reported for the first time. in order to confirm these novel cnvrs, we selected  <dig> cnvrs for validation by qpcr, and  <dig> of them  were validated. the confirmed rate is higher than most of previously reported, such as fadista et al.  <cit>  in pigs  and hou et al.  <cit>  in cattle  but a little lower than that reported by ramayo-caldas et al.  <cit>  in pigs . in the study of ramayo-caldas et al.  <cit> , the cnvrs selected to be validated were detected by at least two programs and were of high frequency, whereas cnvrs selected to be validated herein were detected by one program, with low to high frequencies. the average proportion of the confirmed positive samples of the  <dig> validated cnvrs were  <dig> %, demonstrating that for most of the positive samples qpcr experiments agreed well with the penncnv prediction, whereas the false negative rate in the negative samples were rather high, with an average of  <dig> %. false-negative identification is common in cnv detection, and has been reported previously  <cit> . it can be explained by the stringent criteria of cnv detection, i.e., containing three or more consecutive snps and presented in at least two individuals, which were applied in order to minimize the false-positive, and thus resulted in high false-negative rate inevitably.

eight out of the  <dig> successfully validated cnvrs contain functionally important genes. three of them  include genes of olfactory receptors  family. ors are involved in odorant recognition and form the largest mammalian protein superfamily  <cit> . many studies in human and other mammals also indicate that the or genomic loci are frequently affected by cnvs  <cit> . the qpcr assays revealed that all of the three cnvrs could be confirmed by two pairs of primers. the other five cnvrs  contain many important immune-related and basic metabolic genes, including tnf receptor-associated factor  <dig> , egf containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein  <dig> , d <dig>  zinc and double phd fingers family  <dig> , cd <dig> molecule , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , ferritin, light polypeptide  and interferon regulatory factor  <dig> . the functions of these genes have been reported in pig and other species, and their detailed information was showed in table s <dig> of the additional file  <dig>  in particular, cd <dig> was the first time to be found to have copy number change not only in pigs but in human and other animals. considering the important function of genes in them, the five cnvrs are worth to be further studied.

the porcine snp <dig> beadchip was originally developed for high-throughput snp genotyping for genome-wide association studies. although cnv detection is also feasible with such panel, it is impaired by low marker density, non-uniform distribution of snps along pig chromosomes and lack of non-polymorphic probes specifically designed for cnv identification  <cit> . hence, only large cnvrs are expected to be assessed with the porcine snp <dig> array. furthermore, the sscrofa  <dig> assembly, with 4× sequence depth across the genome, is still in incomplete status, which makes it difficult to determine the boundaries of cnvrs. accordingly, multiple, neighboring, and discrete cnv events could trigger a larger call by penncnv, leading to an over-estimation of the cnv size. therefore, it is quite possible that the qpcr primers used to validate the cnvrs were designed beyond the boundaries of the cnvrs. besides these aspects, factors, such as potential snps and small indels undetected so far, could also influence the hybridization of the qpcr primers in some animals, resulting in unstable quantification values or reducing primer efficiency.

many gene families, including olfactory receptor, solute carrier, cytochrome p <dig>  mhc and interleukin, which had been reported to be influenced by cnvs in human and other mammals  <cit> , were also found to be in the cnvrs of this study. additionally, by converting the pig ensembl gene ids to their orthologous human gene, we checked whether they have been included in the human database of genomic variants . it turned out that  <dig> genes , a remarkably high proportion  of all the total number genes in the identified cnvrs, were reported to be influenced by cnvs in human.

CONCLUSIONS
we have performed a genome-wide cnv detection based on the porcine snp <dig> genotyping data of  <dig> pigs and provided the highest resolution cnv map in the pig genome so far. a total of  <dig> cnvrs were identified. validating of  <dig> cnvrs of these cnvrs by qpcr assays produced a high rate  of confirmation. we conclude that the currently available genome-wide snp assays can capture cnvs efficiently. however, it should be noticed that only large cnvrs are expected to be identified using this snp panel and the number of cnvs identified in this study is likely to be a gross underestimation of the true number of cnvs in the pig genome. follow-up studies, using improved snp arrays as well as other technologies, such as cgh arrays and next-generation sequencing  <cit> , should be carried out to attain high-resolution cnv map. association studies between cnvs and diseases have become popular in human  <cit> , and have begun in animal as well  <cit> . findings in our study would provide meaningful genomic variation information for association studies between cnv and economically important phenotypes of pigs in the future.
