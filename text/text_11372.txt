BACKGROUND
gene expression analysis plays an important role in furthering our understanding of the signalling and metabolic pathways which underlie developmental and cellular processes. real-time quantitative reverse transcription pcr  represents a particularly suitable technology platform for this purpose, thanks to its sensitivity, specificity, dynamic range and high throughput capacity  <cit> . to avoid experimental errors arising from variation in the quantity and integrity of the rna template, as well as in the efficiency of the rt reaction used to synthesize cdna, a normalization step is an essential pre-requisite. the most common way to achieve normalization is to include one, or a small number of reference genes, whose expression is assumed to be constitutive  <cit> . such genes are expressed at a constant level in all tissues independent of the growing environment  <cit> . commonly used reference genes include ribosomal rna  and a number of housekeeping genes, such as those encoding actin , tubulin , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , polyubiquitin  and elongation factor 1-α   <cit> . typically, these genes have been simply assumed to be constitutively expressed, as they are involved in basic and ubiquitous cellular processes  <cit> . however, the evidence is that transcript levels of housekeeping genes can vary considerably in response to changes in experimental conditions and/or tissue types, so that none of the commonly exploited genes can be viewed as a universal reference. instead, the onus is on the experimenter to select a panel of genes which is appropriate for the specific set of chosen experimental conditions and tissue types  <cit> . in many cases, a single reference gene is inadequate, and any such reliance is likely to produce erroneous conclusions vis-à-vis expression patterns  <cit> .

the importance of expression stability in the choice of reference genes is high enough to have prompted the development of software packages, such as genorm  <cit>  and normfinder  <cit> , to identify them  <cit> . a number of reference gene validation attempts have been reported  <cit> , and in plants specifically, these have covered both model and crop species: arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , rice  <cit> , brachypodium sp.  <cit> , wheat  <cit> , barley  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , potato  <cit> , sugarcane  <cit> , grape  <cit>  and poplar  <cit> . the a. thaliana ath <dig> array has been used to identify a set of reference genes superior to the conventionally applied housekeeping genes  <cit> , and the wider relevance of this set has been demonstrated in brachypodium sp.  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , grape  <cit>  and poplar  <cit> .

soybean is the leading legume crop, and has been used as a model plant in the context of the flowering response to photoperiod. many of these studies have used tub and/or act as a reference gene . a literature search based on the keywords "soybean" and "gene expression" produced  <dig> hits in pubmed . in  <dig> of these studies , tub was the reference gene, in  <dig> of them  act, and in six  18srrna. all of the studies surveyed used one single reference gene and no preliminary validations were performed . to date, only a limited number of statistically validated reference genes have been identified in soybean. a comparison of the performance of ten conventional housekeeping genes across  <dig> soybean samples allowed the identification of a panel of genes suitable for gene expression normalization  <cit> . however, the limited number of samples tested meant that a full representation of developmental stages and tissues/organs could not be achieved; instead, a set of new reference genes, chosen to exhibit constancy of expression over a range of experimental conditions, was mined from multiple soybean microarray datasets  <cit> . in the present report, we compare the performance of seven commonly used housekeeping genes and seven of these new reference genes across a large set of biological samples representing various developmental stages, tissues, photoperiod treatments and cultivars of soybean. the recently released soybean whole genome sequence  <cit>  has facilitated genome-wide mining for reference genes in soybean. based on sequence homology, soybean orthologs of the best three a. thaliana reference genes have been identified. a further four genes have been selected, which have shown stable expression on a micro-array platform  <cit> . our data indicate that many of these newer reference genes indeed have greater expression stability than the conventionally used housekeeping genes. as a result, the use of combinations of these reference genes should provide a more reliable means of normalizing gene expression.

RESULTS
transcription profiling of soybean reference genes
a rt-qpcr assay based on sybr green detection was carried out to examine the stability of the expression of the  <dig> candidate genes . the full sample set was included in each technical replicate to exclude any artefacts due to between-run variation. each rt reaction was repeated once, and three independent technical replicates were performed for each experiment. the expression level of the candidate reference genes are presented as quantification cycle  values . the mean cq values of the genes ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  with most lying between  <dig> and  <dig>  cyp was the most highly expressed of the set, with a mean cq of  <dig> , and hdc the least . ef1b showed the least variation , while act2/ <dig>  and tub <dig>  were the most variable. the variation in cq is illustrated as a scatter diagram in additional file  <dig> 

the variation in relative transcript quantity of the reference genes across all samples is shown as figure  <dig>  here, transcript quantities are represented as percentages, relative to the aggregated reference transcript pool of each sample. the proportion of skip <dig>  ukn <dig> and ukn <dig> transcript remained relatively constant across samples, while those of hdc and tub <dig> were rather variable, especially with respect to developmental stage and tissue type. although the expression level of ukn <dig> was fairly constant among almost all the samples, its expression was particularly low in the 2nd triofoliolate at the stage when the 3rd triofoliolate fully expanded. in contrast, the expression of hdc was particularly high in this tissue/developmental stage combination. tua <dig> expression varied widely across developmental stages and tissue types, but was largely unaffected by photoperiodic treatment or cultivar. thus, the transcript level of none of the reference genes was truly constant, rather it varied both temporally and spatially.

pcr efficiency analyses
melting curve analyses were performed following the rt-qpcr. the specificity of the amplicons was confirmed by the presence of a single peak . electrophoretic separation of the amplicons produced a single fragment of the expected size in all cases, with no visible primer-dimer products. five primer pairs were designed either to span an intron, or to target exon-exon junctions , and used to compare amplicons derived from genomic dna template with those from cdna template. this comparison demonstrated that the cdna template was free of contaminating gdna. no amplification was detectable in the absence of template. standard curves were generated using a ten-fold serial dilution of a cdna pool, and these enjoyed a linear correlation coefficient  of  <dig> - <dig> . based on the slopes of these standard curves, the estimated pcr amplification efficiencies ranged from 94% to 106% .

gene expression stability analyses
the expression stability of the set of candidate reference genes was examined by genorm software, which calculates, for each gene, a measure of its expression stability  based on the average pairwise variation between all genes tested . stepwise exclusion of the least stable gene allowed the genes to be ranked according to their m value   <cit> , as depicted in figure 3a. all the genes had an m value below the genorm threshold of  <dig> . across all the samples, skip <dig> and ukn <dig> were the most stably expressed, and hdc the least. as a result, the latter was the first to be excluded from the analysis . among the various developmental stages, skip <dig> and ukn <dig> remained the most stable, and cyp the least stable. act <dig> and ukn <dig> were the most highly ranked across the set of tissues at the various developmental stages, while act2/ <dig> was the least stable. in response to the short day  and long day  treatments, act <dig> and tua <dig> were the most stable genes, and hdc the least; while in response to blue light  and red light  treatment, tip <dig> and ukn <dig> were the most stable, and hdc the least.

to determine the optimal number of genes required for normalization, genorm was used to calculate the pairwise variation  between sequential normalization factors    <cit> . as reported by vandesompele et al , a threshold value of  <dig>  was adopted  <cit> . in the sd/ld comparison, three genes was sufficient for normalization, since the v3/ <dig> value was << <dig>  . differences in the expression stability of the candidate reference genes were less marked in the rl and bl photoperiodic treatment series, than in the other series . the v2/ <dig> value for the rl/bl comparison was  <dig> , so that tip <dig> together with ukn <dig> would be sufficient for normalization purposes. among the cultivars, the pair act <dig> and ukn <dig> produced a v2/ <dig> value of  <dig> . however, for the comparisons based on developmental stage and tissue type, four genes were necessary, since the v3/ <dig> values lay above the threshold. when all the experimental samples were considered together, the v2/ <dig> value was  <dig>  and the v3/ <dig> was  <dig> , suggesting that the addition of a fourth gene did not improve the quality of the normalization . overall, the combination skip <dig>  ukn <dig> and ukn <dig> was appropriate for all sets of samples.

stability of expression was then re-analysed using the program normfinder, which is based on a variance estimation approach  <cit> , and ranks the genes according to their stability under a given set of experimental conditions. the ranking generated by this approach was slightly different from that determined by genorm . act <dig> and ukn <dig> were still ranked the highest for tissue samples, and act <dig> and ukn <dig> the highest for inter-cultivar comparisons. hdc, cyp and act2/ <dig> ranked consistently poorly. among developmental stages, ef1b and mtp emerged as the most stably expressed  . act <dig> and tua <dig> were identified by both normfinder and genorm as being among the three most stable genes under sd and ld treatments. when evaluated across all the experimental samples, the same four genes were identified by both programs, although their rank order was slightly altered.

reference gene validation
the expression pattern of gmftl <dig>  a soybean flowering locus t  ortholog, was analysed using the selected reference genes . in a. thaliana, ft acts as a floral promoter and an integrator of various flowering pathways  <cit> . gmftl <dig> has been proposed as a flowering promoter, since its ectopic over-expression in a. thaliana is associated with an extremely early flowering phenotype . its pattern of expression was assessed at five distinct vegetative growth stages. when normalized using skip <dig>  ukn <dig>  mtp and ef1b as reference genes, transcript abundance gradually increased over time, peaking at the onset of flowering  . similar expression patterns were generated when either three or two of the most stable genes  were used for normalization . when only one reference gene was employed, its expression was also rather similar to the above patterns , but differences were evident in estimated transcript abundance, which was higher when normalized against skip <dig> than against ukn <dig>  presumably because ukn <dig> transcript level was greater than that of skip <dig> . normalization based on either of the less stable genes cyp or tub <dig> produced a picture of gmftl <dig> expression in which transcript level was constant during the vegetative growth stages . its relatively less abundant expression at the onset of flowering was a consequence of cyp and tub <dig> up-regulation during this period. it suggested that not only the stability but also the abundance of a reference gene affected the normalized results.

discussion
reference genes are routinely used as a means of quantifying gene expression. the ideal reference genes should be expressed at a constant level throughout the plant and not be influenced by exogenous treatment  <cit> . housekeeping genes, such as those involved in basic cellular processes  or cell structure maintenance , have been extensively used, but increasingly it has become apparent that their expression level is not as independent of experimental conditions as had been expected  <cit> . this implies a need to test in advance the expression stability of any proposed reference gene, a procedure which is often not followed in the literature. normalization based on several reference genes has begun to become the standard, supported by the development of software such as genorm and normfinder  <cit> . however, the prior validation of reference genes remains uncommon in plant research, although it is the norm in human and animal research  <cit> .

soybean has been used as a model plant for the study of photoperiod-induced floral induction  <cit> , but the molecular mechanism underlying this induction remains poorly understood. in soybean, act, tub and ubq are the most frequently used reference genes , but there is increasing evidence that their expression is not particularly stable under certain conditions. more recently, some alternative reference genes have emerged  <cit> . although four of these  have been shown by rt-qpcr to be stably expressed under certain limited experimental conditions, no detailed validation has to date been carried out to test their suitability in experiments involving photoperiodic treatments.

in the present study, we used more subdivided samples to make the data more representative . to our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of the expression stability of reference genes across such a large number of samples under varied light regimes  in soybean. the  <dig> reference genes in general out-performed the conventional housekeeping genes, and the poor performance of commonly used genes such as act2/ <dig> and tub <dig> was of particular note . skip <dig>  ukn <dig> and ukn <dig> were overall the most stable and were good candidates for the normalization of general gene expression. but different sets of samples had their own best reference genes . for example, act <dig> is one of best reference genes for both different tissue and photoperiod samples, whereas tip <dig> did better than act <dig> when studying samples harvesting from different quality light  and skip <dig> was the best reference for developmental material.

the weakness of act <dig> in soybean, rice, potato and sugarcane has been noted previously  <cit> , while act2/ <dig> was seen to be rather variable in a. thaliana  <cit> . however, act2/ <dig> was judged to be the most stable of a set of ten conventional housekeeping genes across  <dig> soybean samples, covering a range of developmental stages  <cit> . similarly, tub performed poorly as a reference gene in grape, potato and soybean  <cit> . ubq <dig>  which ranked poorly in the present experiments, was previously deemed unsatisfactory as a reference in soybean  <cit>  and in grape  <cit> , but enjoyed very stable expression in a. thaliana and brachypodium sp.  <cit> . ef1b was among the most stable genes both in this study and in a previous study of soybean  <cit> , while in both potato and rice, ef1α was very stably expressed under conditions of biotic and abiotic stress  <cit> . the same gene was also identified as being highly stable in its expression across tissues of rice  <cit> , but was unstable across tissues and organs of tomato at various developmental stages  <cit> . tua <dig> was identified as being highly stable across development in soybean  <cit> , while in poplar, tua was very stably expressed across different tissues  <cit> . here, tua <dig> expression was hardly affected by changes in photoperiod. globally, the best-performing genes were skip <dig>  ukn <dig>  ukn <dig> and tip <dig>  while the worst were pepkr <dig> and hdc. tip <dig> and ukn <dig> have been noted as showing stable expression across tissues and development in both tomato  <cit>  and aspen  <cit> . however, tip <dig> performed poorly during grape berry development  <cit> , and in the roots and leaves of a. thaliana plants suffering cadmium or copper stress  <cit> . in aspen cambial cells, ukn <dig> expression was too unstable for the gene to be used for normalization  <cit> . thus, overall, while certain reference genes are stably expressed in one plant species, they may not be well suited for use in others. as a consequence, prior validation of reference genes needs to be carried out under the specific experimental conditions to be applied in gene expression studies.

we report the application of various mathematical and statistical models to minimize bias in the quantification of gene expression in soybean. the first was a conventional statistical test to calculate the coefficient of variance  of cq values, which allowed an assessment of an individual gene's expression stability. but, due to its low sensitivity and reliability, this method can not clearly define the most stably expressed reference genes. the second exploited genorm software  <cit> , which showed that the stability of the various candidate reference genes varied considerably across the sets of samples . the third used the alternative program, normfinder, which ranks the reference genes according to their expression stability  <cit> . the ranking of genes as revealed by normfinder was mostly identical to that generated by genorm . except for tub <dig>  all the candidate reference genes were represented in the genevestigator database  <cit> , and most of the expression patterns revealed by genevestigator microarray data were consistent with the outputs of genorm and normfinder in the present data set .

it has been argued that co-regulation of genes may confound genorm analyses, because of the software's tendency to select the genes with a similar expression profile  <cit> . among the set of genes tested, two pairs  belong to a particular gene family, and thus may be prone to co-regulation. but the possibility that act and tua may be co-regulated is unlikely in this study , given that act <dig> and tua <dig> were consistently ranked above act2/ <dig> and tub <dig> except that tub <dig> ranked above tua <dig> in different cultivars.

the transcript abundance of many genes is, like gmftl <dig>  never very high, so any variation in their expression pattern is inevitably subtle. in this study, we normalized the expression of gmftl <dig> with a total of seven normalization factors using individual or combinations of two, three and four control genes, and got similar patterns even though the levels of the abundance were different. but normalization with the combination of more genes resulted in improved accuracy. it suggests that the number of reference genes needed to be employed is dependent on the considerations of a researcher's purpose. that is, if one just wants to show a rough expression mode of genes, one reference gene may be enough if this reference gene was confirmed as a stable expressed gene. however, if the researcher hopes to compare the expression among different samples or to accurate the expression level, more reference genes  must be taken. this may be partially explained by that the genorm threshold is not a strict cut-off and that the observed trend of changing pairwise variation values is equally informative  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we have investigated the expression of  <dig> candidate reference genes across a large number of soybean samples in an attempt to identify those most suitable for normalizing gene expression. no gene was consistently superior to the others, but most novel genes were better than the conventionally used housekeeping genes in terms of their expression stability. a combination of the three genes skip <dig>  ukn <dig> and ukn <dig> provided the most robust platform for transcript normalization across experimental conditions in this study.
