BACKGROUND
calcium  is an essential element in plant cell wall and an important nutrient for plant growth. in addition, ca2+ acts as a second messenger to regulate a variety of biological processes in response to various biotic and abiotic stimuli in eukaryotic organisms  <cit> .

calmodulin  is a major ca2+ sensor thought to interpret ca2+ signatures in plants. it is a small protein, typically comprising only about  <dig> amino acids. it bears four helix-loop-helix motifs called ef hands, each with the ability to bind ca2+ <cit> .

cam genes have been identified in several plant species. genome-wide identification of cam genes in model plant species, such as arabidopsis and rice  <cit> , has revealed that cam proteins are typically encoded by gene families. in addition, plants may contain several cam isoforms that differ in only a few amino acids, with one of the isoforms being encoded by several genes located on different chromosomes of the genome. for example, in arabidopsis, seven genes encode for four cam isoforms, among which cam <dig> and cam <dig> encode an identical protein sequence and cam <dig>  cam <dig> and cam <dig> also encode an identical protein sequence, differing in only a few amino acids from the cam1/cam <dig> isoform. the four arabidopsis cam isoforms differ from each other in only one to five amino acids  <cit> . in rice, five genes encode three cam isoforms. oscam1- <dig>  oscam1- <dig> and oscam1- <dig> encode an identical protein sequence. oscam <dig> and oscam <dig> proteins have only two amino acid differences. in addition, cam genes have been identified in other plant species, such as tobacco  <cit> , potato  <cit>  and soybean  <cit> . nevertheless, cams in many solanaceous species, including the economically important species tomato and the model species for gene silencing studies, nicotiana benthamiana, have not yet been identified or characterized. genome-wide analysis of cam gene families in other solanaceous species has also not yet been conducted.

as major ca2+ sensors, cams are multifunctional in plants. cams play important roles in regulation of growth, development and abiotic stress resistance in plants  <cit> . for example, over-expression of atcam <dig> in arabidopsis promotes photomorphogenetic growth  <cit> . a loss-of-function mutation in atcam <dig> causes a significant reduction in pollen germination  <cit> . in marigold, cam regulates adventitious root development  <cit> . over-expression of oscam <dig>  mcam <dig> and gmcam <dig> in rice, mulberry and soybean, respectively, enhances resistance to drought and/or salt  <cit> .

limited evidence has been reported for a role of cam in plant disease resistance. ectopic over-expression of the soybean cam genes, scam <dig> and scam <dig>  enhances resistance to phytophthora parasitica var. nicotianae, pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci and tmv in transgenic tobacco  <cit>  and to p. syringae pv. tomato dc <dig> in transgenic arabidopsis <cit> . over-expression of cacam <dig> promotes reactive oxygen species  and nitric oxide  generation, and increases resistance to xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria in pepper  <cit> . knockdown of ntcam <dig> expression enhances susceptibility to ralstonia solanacearum and rhizoctonia solani in tobacco  <cit> . cam may directly bind with camta3/sr <dig>  which binds to and negatively regulates eds <dig>  and thus down-regulate salicylic acid dependent defense and resistance  <cit> . different isoforms of a cam family may play various roles in the regulation of plant defense  <cit> .

taking advantage of the recent release of complete genomes of a number of solanaceous species, we performed a genome-wide identification of cam gene families in tomato, n. benthamiana and potato. through systemic phylogenetic, gene structure and expression analyses, we discovered one novel group of cam genes in solanaceous species, and demonstrated that a small set of genes encode an identical cam protein sequence, as may be typical of plants  <cit> . multiple genes encoding identical proteins may ensure redundancy for a critical life function or may be needed to produce sufficient protein product. alternatively, multiple cam genes may be evidence of a strategy of plants to efficiently evolve functional gene paralogs. finally, we provide evidence that reveals function for slcams in resistance to viral and oomycete pathogens.

RESULTS
identification of cam genes in solanaceous genomes
to identify cam genes in genomes of solanaceous species, all four arabidopsis and three rice cam protein sequences were collected and used for tblastn search against the databases from sgn . seventy three,  <dig> and  <dig> nonreduntant sequences were retrieved in tomato, potato  and nicotiana benthamiana genomes, respectively. these sequences were aligned with the canonical arabidopsis cam  with clustalx program and viewed by genedoc for the sequence identity to atcam <dig>  sequences were further analyzed by pfam  and cdd  programs to confirm presence of the ef-hand domains, a characteristic domain for ca2+ binding. genes with sequence identity of over 90% to atcam <dig> and that harbored four ef-hands were defined as cams, following precedent set previously  <cit> . the genomic, cdna and protein sequences were comparatively analyzed for all these cam candidates. we found that the cdna and protein sequences of one of the n. benthamiana cams  previously deposited in the database were incorrect due to an error in identification of the second intron. the sequences have been corrected . finally, six, four and seven full-length cam genes were indentified in tomato, potato and n. benthamiana genomes. to better reflect the orthologous relationship between the solanaceous and arabidopsis cam genes, we named the solanaceous cam members in accordance with their phylogenies and sequence similarity to individual atcams .

1 nbcam <dig> was deduced from the genomic sequence niben044scf <dig> and was the corrected form of nbs00037851g <dig> .

2 presence of a cysteine at the position of  <dig> in a cam protein was indicated as a “+”.

3 presence of a lysine at the position of  <dig> in a cam protein was indicated as a “+”.

sequence analyses showed that all solanaceous cam proteins are comprised of  <dig> amino acids . motif analysis using pfam and cdd revealed that all of the solanaceous cams carry two pairs of ef-hand domain, corresponding to two ef-hand  <dig> motifs . sequence alignment using clustalx demonstrated that members of the solanaceous cam families are highly conserved in amino acid sequence, with over 90% sequence identity . the tomato cams encoded by slcam <dig>  slcam <dig> and slcam <dig> are identical in amino acid sequence while the other three slcam proteins share 91%-99% amino acid sequence identity with slcam3/4/ <dig>  the potato stcam <dig> and stcam <dig> protein sequences are identical while stcam <dig> and stcam <dig> share 99% and 91% amino acid identity with stcam2/ <dig>  respectively. in the case of n. benthamiana cams, nbcam <dig>  nbcam <dig>  nbcam <dig>  and nbcam <dig> encode an identical protein sequence, and nbcam <dig> and nbcam <dig> encode an identical protein also. the other two nbcams exhibit 99% sequence identity to nbcam1/2/3/ <dig> . however, nucleotide sequences of the cam gene families are much more diverse in comparison with protein sequences. the identity percentage of nucleotide sequences within a cam gene family is 79%-92% for slcams, 79%-91% for stcams and 83%-98% for nbcams, respectively . notably, even the genes that encode identical cam protein sequences are not identical. for example, the coding sequences of slcam3/4/ <dig>  stcam2/ <dig>  nbcam1/2/3/ <dig> and nbcam5/ <dig> share only 88%-92%, 86%, 83%- 96% and 99%, respectively . these genes differ primarily in the third nucleotide of the amino acid coding triplets .

in addition to the cam genes described above,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> other sequences of tomato, potato and n. benthamiana respectively, were retrieved from blast searches using arabidopsis and rice cams . of these sequences,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> sequences of tomato, potato and n. benthamiana respectively, are shorter than  <dig> amino acids long and contain ef-hands but no any other known functional domain. these protein sequences were thus designated as solanaceous calmodulin-like  sequences, following the criteria used previously  <cit> . of the remaining sequences,  <dig> tomato,  <dig> potato and  <dig> n. benthamiana sequences were longer than canonical cams, having more than  <dig> amino acids, and harbor not only ef-hand domains but also protein kinase domain; these may be calcium-dependent protein kinase candidates.

gene structure and chromosome location of solanaceous cam genes
the finding that several genes encode identical cam proteins in a variety of solanaceous species prompted us to investigate gene structure and chromosome location of these cam genes in the different species. results of comparisons of genomic dna sequences with corresponding cdna sequences showed that coding sequences of cam genes are interrupted by introns. it is noteworthy that unlike arabidopsis cam genes, which carry a single intron, the number of introns varied in solanacous cam genes, with one in slcam <dig> to slcam <dig>  stcam <dig> to stcam <dig> and all seven nbcams, and three introns in slcam <dig> and stcam <dig> . interestingly, all solanaceous cam genes were disrupted by the first intron in the gly <dig> codon, similar to that previously reported for arabidopsis cams <cit> . for those genes that contain  <dig> introns, the interruption sites by the 2nd and 3rd introns were asp <dig> and leu <dig> codons, respectively. the intron that interrupted gly <dig> codon was phase  <dig> type, while the other two belonged to phase  <dig> type . in addition, generally, the sizes of the introns are significantly longer in solanaceous cams compared with arabidopsis cams, but are similar in length to rice cams .

chromosome localization analysis demonstrated that the slcam genes are located on different chromosomes of the tomato genome. both slcam <dig> and slcam <dig> are located on chromosome  <dig>  while the other four slcam genes are on four different chromosomes , respectively . information about the chromosome location of cams in other solanaceous species is not yet available.

phylogenetic relationship among solanaceous and arabidopsis and rice cam proteins
the full-length amino acid sequences of solanaceous and arabidopsis and rice cams were subjected to phylogenetic analysis. a maximum likelihood  phylogenetic tree was constructed. the cam proteins clustered into two major groups . most solanaceous cams belonged to the same group, named group i here. these included  <dig> out of  <dig> slcams;  <dig> out of  <dig> stcams and all  <dig> nbcams. all five arabidopsis and three rice cams also belonged to group i. however, two solanaceous cams, slcam <dig> and stcam <dig> segregated into another group  . it is intriguing that the solanaceous, arabidopsis and rice cams formed different groups. all arabidopsis and rice cams were contained into the same group , while the solanaceous cams were separated into two groups , among which the group ii was newly expanded . the cam genes encoding group ii proteins carry three introns while those genes encoding group i proteins contain only one , supporting the phylogenetic classification into two cam groups. these data revealed that the solanaceous species have evolved a new type of cam during the evolution.

bioinformatics prediction of potential cis regulatory sequences for slcam gene expression
the 5′ upstream noncoding sequences of the cam genes encoding identical cam proteins are not well conserved , suggesting that these genes may be differentially expressed in response to various stimuli, even though they encode identical proteins.

to obtain hints for how expression of the cam genes may be regulated, potential cis-acting elements in upstream  <dig> bp sequences of the slcam genes were analyzed. place analysis revealed that slcam gene upstream sequences carry a variety of potential cis-acting elements, including binding sites for transcription factors that are regulated by hormones such as abscisic acid , gibberellin , auxin, jasmonic acid  and ethylene . the patterns of cis-acting elements differed significantly among the slcam genes. the slcam <dig> gene promoter contained  <dig> elements that may respond to all these five hormones, while all other slcams lacked elements responsive to one or several hormones. slcam <dig> lacked cis-elements predicted to be responsive to auxin and ethylene, slcam <dig>  slcam <dig> and slcam <dig> contained elements known to be responsive to two hormones, while slcam <dig> carried only cis-elements responsive to auxin. in addition, all the slcam upstream sequences carry an abundance of w-box elements, suggesting that slcam expression may be regulated by the wrky transcription factors .

expression of slcam genes in plants was organ-specific
the six slcam genes encode four cam isoforms . to examine whether these genes are differentially expressed in developing plants and thus potentially harboring differential physiological functions, qrt-pcr analysis was conducted using slcam gene specific primers . the expression patterns of slcam genes in roots, stems, leaves, flowers and fruit organs are shown in figure 5a. results of qrt-pcr expression analysis revealed that all slcam genes were constitutively expressed in all organs examined. however, the levels of expression were distinct in the various organs. among the slcams, slcam <dig> displayed the lowest expression level in all organs. slcam <dig> also showed relatively low expression in all organs except flowers. slcam <dig> exhibited the highest transcript accumulation level in all organs except fruits. slcam <dig> was expressed modestly in roots, stems and leaves, but was highly expressed in fruits and flowers. expression profiles of slcam <dig> were similar to that of slcam <dig>  although the absolute expression level was relative lower. slcam <dig> was expressed highly in roots, fruits and flowers, and modestly in stems and leaves. thus, slcam <dig>  slcam <dig> and slcam <dig> genes, which encode an identical protein, showed different expression levels in the various organs . generally speaking, the slcam genes were expressed highest in flowers and lowest in stems .

expression of slcam genes was highly responsive to diverse stimuli
to gain further information about potential differential gene functions, slcam expression patterns in response to various plant hormones were investigated. expression data demonstrated that slcam <dig> to slcam <dig> showed similar expression patterns in response to eth, bth and ja, which was, however, different from that of slcam <dig> in expression level . expression of slcam <dig> to slcam <dig> was dramatically up-regulated with eth treatment as early as  <dig> hpt  and then maintained the elevated expression level, moderately up-regulated with bth treatment at  <dig> hpt, while strongly down-regulated with ja treatment after  <dig> hpt. expression of slcam <dig> showed a similar trend but had a significant different magnitude in response to these three hormones in comparison with slcam <dig> to slcam <dig>  slcam <dig> was very highly up-regulated at  <dig> hpt by eth and bth treatments and down-regulated to undetectable levels at  <dig> hpt by ja treatment. regarding aba treatment, the six slcam genes exhibited different responses, although the alteration magnitude was generally not as large as that in response to other tested hormones. expression of slcam <dig> to slcam <dig> was down-regulated, whereas slcam <dig>  slcam <dig> and slcam <dig> expression was up-regulated at  <dig> hpt and then down-regulated at  <dig> hpt . these data indicate that slcams might play different roles in regulation of various hormone-regulated biological processes.

to determine whether there are roles for slcam gene function in disease resistance, gene expression in response to a set of pathogens was examined. expression of slcam genes varied in response to inoculation with different pathogens . expression of slcam <dig> to slcam <dig> was significantly reduced at  <dig> h and then increased at  <dig> h after inoculation with pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc <dig> , whereas expression of slcam <dig> was down-regulated to undetectable levels since  <dig> h after inoculation . however, expression of all slcam genes was continuously up-regulated after inoculation with xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae . among the slcam genes, expression of slcam <dig> was most induced at  <dig> h after xoo inoculation . these data indicate that slcams might be involved in regulation of plant disease resistance.

collectively, in general, slcam <dig> expression was much more sensitive to hormone treatment and pathogen inoculation in comparison with expression of the other slcams.

silencing of slcam <dig> and slcam <dig> in tomato plants reduced resistance to trv and pythium aphanidermatum, but not to pst dc <dig> and xoo
to understand the function of slcams in plant disease resistance, virus-induced gene silencing  was performed for slcam <dig> and slcam <dig>  a vector containing a fragment of egfp was used as control in agro-infiltrated plants  <cit> . three weeks post agro-infiltration, plants treated with egfp-control showed no or only very weak mosaic symptoms in some leaves. however, most of the slcam2- and slcam6-silenced tomato plants displayed obvious mosaic and yellowing symptoms, which were most severe in the slcam6-vigs plants . gene expression analysis revealed that transcripts of trv <dig> replicase and trv <dig> 2b genes accumulated over  <dig> and  <dig> times higher in these plants compared with egfp-control plants .

to check whether the symptoms and viral gene transcript accumulation levels correlated with silencing of slcam <dig> and slcam <dig> genes, transcripts of these genes in the agro-infiltrated plants were quantified with qrt-pcr. result showed that slcam <dig> and slcam <dig> transcripts in the vigs-treated plants dropped to about 30% of that in egfp-control plants . these results demonstrated that silencing of the slcam <dig> and slcam <dig> genes resulted in trv viral symptoms and higher level of virus accumulation. together, these data indicate that slcam <dig> and slcam <dig> may have a role in positively regulating tomato resistance to trv.

to further understand role of slcams in disease resistance, the silenced tomato plants were inoculated with the host pathogens pst dc <dig> and pythium aphanidermatum and the nonhost pathogen xoo, and resistance was evaluated. nonhost resistance to xoo in silenced plants was similar to that in egfp-control plants, as both plants initiated hypersensitive response necrosis in infiltrated areas at  <dig> hpi, and showed complete tissue collapse within  <dig> hpi . resistance to pst dc <dig> was also not altered significantly in silenced plants when compared with the egfp-control plants. all genotypes showed necrosis at  <dig> hpi and died at  <dig> hpi . however, when inoculated with p. aphanidermatum, necrotic symptoms of the leaves of slcam-silenced plants were significantly more severe than that of egfp-control plants . the lesions in the silenced plants,  <dig>  ~  <dig>  cm in diameter, were obviously larger in size than those in control plants,  <dig>  cm in diameter . this result revealed that the slcams are necessary for enhanced resistance to p. aphanidermatum in tomato plants.

silencing of slcam <dig> and slcam <dig> in tomato plants altered expression of signaling and defense-related genes
to probe the molecular mechanisms by which slcams regulate plant resistance, we quantified the expression of two pathogenesis-related  genes pr <dig> and pr <dig>  slcngc <dig> and slcngc <dig> which encode cngc type calcium channel proteims, one glutathione transferase  gene slgstf <dig>  and an ubiquitin extension protein  gene by qrt-pcr. silencing of both slcam genes significantly reduced the expression of pr genes and slcngc <dig>  but increased that of slcngc <dig>  in slcam2-silenced plants, the expression of pr <dig>  pr <dig> and slcngc <dig> decreased by 98%, 93% and 60%, respectively, while that of slcngc <dig> increased by  <dig>  times. in slcam6-silenced plants, the expression of pr <dig>  pr <dig> and slcngc <dig> lowered by 56%, 91% and 91%, respectively, while that of slcngc17enhanced by  <dig>  times. however, silencing of the two slcam genes had differential effects on the expression of slgstf <dig> and sluep; silencing of slcam <dig> resulted in strongly enhanced expression of both genes by over  <dig>  times whereas slcam <dig> silencing reduced expression of slgstf <dig> by 29% and that of sluep by 57% . these data indicate that the regulation of cytosolic ca2+ concentration, ubiquitylation and redox status may be involved in slcam-mediated disease resistance, and slcam <dig> and slcam <dig> might employ different molecular mechanisms to regulate disease resistance.

discussion
to begin to understand the roles of cam, the conserved eukaryotic ca2+ sensor, in plants, we systemically identified the complete cam gene families in the solanaceous species tomato, potato and n. benthamiana. previously,  <dig> full-length and  <dig> partial potato cam genes were identified through screening a potato stolon tip cdna library with a chicken cam as probe  <cit> . among the five full-length potato cams, pcam <dig>  pcam <dig>  pcam7and pcam <dig> encode an identical cam sequence, while pcam <dig> encodes another cam isoform. thus these five genes encode for two distinct potato cam isoforms. in the present study, we performed genome-wide analysis for potato cam genes and identified  <dig> full-length stcam genes that we named stcam <dig> to stcam <dig>  these  <dig> genes encode  <dig> different stcam isoforms because stcam <dig> and stcam <dig> encode identical proteins . stcam <dig> is identical in sequence to pcam5/6/7/ <dig>  while stcam2/ <dig> and stcam <dig> are novel isoforms .

because of the large number of genes encoding proteins with sequence relatedness to cam, there have been attempts to define canoical cams and distinguish them from calmodulin-like  proteins. cam is one of the most conserved proteins in eukaryotes. for example, the protein sequence identity between vertebrate and plant cams is near 90%. in this study, we found that all true cams of tomato, potato and n. benthamiana had amino acid sequence identity percentages over 91%, and the sequences of cmls differed more significantly from the canonical cams with the identity percentages of lower than 80% . in addition, cam is  <dig> amino acid in lengh and carries two pairs of ef-hand motifs, as exemplified by the solanaceous cams identified in this study. we followed the criteria used in a previous analysis of the cam and cml gene families of arabidopsis <cit>  and identified cams as those proteins should include those that are composed of about  <dig> amino acids, harbor two pairs of ef-hand motifs, and share over 90% amino acid sequence identity with known canonical cams. proteins that resemble cam in that they have approximately  <dig> amino acids and four ef-hand motifs, but share less than 90% amino acid identity are defined as cam-like  proteins . using these criteria, some previously reported cams, such as ntcam <dig>  <cit>  and scam- <dig> and scam- <dig>  <cit> , are not true cams, but are likely more appropriately referred to as cmls.

a very unusual characteristic of cam gene families is that a small set of genes, usually two to four, encode identical protein isoforms  <cit> . in the solanaceous species used in this study, tomato slcam3/4/ <dig>  potato stcam2/ <dig>  n. benthamiana nbcam1/2/3/ <dig> and nbcam5/ <dig> all encode an identical cam isoform . the phenomenon of multiple genes encoding identical cam isoforms has been described in previous studies; arabidopsis atcam2/3/ <dig>  n. tabacum ntcam3/4/5/6/7/8/11/ <dig>  rice oscam1-1/2/ <dig>  soybean gmcam1/ <dig> all share cam isoforms  <cit> . natural selection is likely acting to keep these protein sequences conserved because the encoding genes are not identical in sequence. the genes differ moderately in the coding sequences , bear distinct 5′ upstream sequences , carry distinct introns with various sizes and sequences, and are located on different chromosomes . this strong conservation argues that cam plays critical roles in plant biological processes and that plants may need more than one copy of the cam gene to execute essential functions. in addition, this phenomenon may also reflect a strategy of plants to evolve functional gene paralogs. these genes can be gained through sequence exchange among chromosomes. it is likely that all the cam gene copies are functional because of the strong sequence conservation. however, it is likely that the different genes may respond differentially to stimuli since they contain different upstream sequences and introns. as an example, we found that tomato slcam3/4/ <dig> genes were expressed at different levels in plant tissues and in response to pathogens . the multiple cam genes, which encode identical protein isoforms may be related to similar situations in which there are gene families that encode similar, but not identical proteins, such as those involved in disease resistance   <cit>  and encoding gst  <cit> . in cases where multiple genes encode closely related proteins, tandem gene arrangement and/or gene cluster nearby on the same chromosome may facilitate the evolution of genetic diversity  <cit> .

another intriguing finding in this study is that solanaceous species seem to have evolved one novel group of cam genes when compared with arabidopsis and rice. phylogenetic analysis reveals that all arabidopsis and rice cam protein isoforms form one clade; however, the cams of solanaceous species separated into two groups, one of them belong to the same clade as that of arabidopsis and rice cams, while the other group members are unique . this classification of cams is supported not only by the amino acid sequence similarity but also by the gene structure data. all group i cam genes contain a single intron, while group ii cams have three introns . these data suggest the possibility that the different groups of cams may play distinct roles in plant biological processes.

roles for plant cams in growth, development and stress resistance have been widely discussed. however, a function for cams in plant disease resistance remains not fully explored. in this study, we found that silencing of two slcam genes significantly altered signaling and defense-related gene expression, and reduced the resistance in tomato to trv and the important oomycete pathogen pythium aphanidermatum . therefore, the slcams are important in viral and oomycete resistance. the molecular mechanisms by which cams may regulate disease resistance are unknown. we found in this study that silencing of slcam <dig> and slcam <dig> genes significantly reduced the expression of slcngc <dig>  but increased that of slcngc <dig>  and differentially altered the expression of slgstf <dig> and sluep genes . these results provide a hint that regulation of cytosolic ca2+ concentration, ubiquitylation and redox status may be involved in slcam-mediated disease resistance, and slcam <dig> and slcam <dig> might employ different molecular mechanisms to regulate disease resistance.

CONCLUSIONS
the cam gene families in solanaceous species tomato, n. benthamiana and potato were identified. tomato, potato and n. benthamiana genomes contain multiple cam genes of high sequence conservation. solanaceous species has evolved one new group of cam genes, with distinct gene structure. whether the different cam groups play distinct roles remains to be analyzed.

reduced expression of slcam genes slcam <dig> and slcam <dig> impaired resistance of tomato to trv and the important oomycete pathogen pythium aphanidermatum, demonstrating that these slcams play important roles in plant disease resistance to a variety of pathogens. finally, our results suggest that slcam <dig> and slcam <dig> may employ different molecular mechanisms to regulate disease resistance.
