BACKGROUND
the rab/ypt proteins represent a large family of small gtpases involved in several transport steps of the cellular trafficking pathway. at present  <dig> members have been identified in yeast and more than  <dig> human rab proteins are supposed  <cit> . small gtpases are known to function as molecular switches and can cycle between an active gtp-bound and an inactive gdp-bound conformation  <cit> . in the active conformation, the rab gtpases are localized on membranes, where they recruit specific effector molecules to mediate vesicle attachment  <cit> . the subsequent fusion step is initiated, when the membranes are forced into close proximity by the interaction of snares  presented on both membranes in concert with sm proteins , thought to act as controlling elements in snare interaction  <cit> .

the two isoforms of the small gtpase rab <dig>  are localized on er-golgi membranes and regulate the exocytotic transport from the er to the golgi apparatus  <cit> . although the function of rab <dig> is still not fully understood, several lines of evidence describe rab <dig> and its yeast homolog ypt1p gtpase as a major component in a protein complex responsible for directing vesicular traffic between the er and the golgi apparatus  <cit> . in the past, several approaches have been established to identify effector molecules that bind specifically to the active gtp-bound form of rab <dig>  <cit> . at present, four specific effector proteins and several additional putative effector molecules are known  <cit> . the first characterized rab <dig> interacting protein was p <dig>  which also binds to the golgi-associated proteins gm <dig> and giantin  <cit> . p <dig> is the mammalian homologue of the yeast protein uso1p, which was found to be an essential component necessary for the tethering of er-derived cop ii vesicles to the golgi compartment, a process that depends on ypt1p, but is independent of snare proteins  <cit> . in addition, p <dig> plays a key role in coordinating sequential tethering and docking of copi vesicles to golgi membranes. thus, it is thought to function as a linker protein between giantin and gm <dig>  <cit> . second, the cis-golgi matrix protein gm <dig> was identified as a direct rab <dig> effector, which also binds to a complex containing grasp <dig>  a lipid-anchored gm130-binding protein, that regulates golgi stack reformation following mitosis, as well as so far uncharacterized proteins  <cit> . a third interacting molecule of activated rab <dig>  golgin- <dig>  is supposed to act as a novel mitotic target  <cit> . overexpression or depletion of golgin- <dig> results in fragmentation of the golgi ribbon and the protein is thought to be required for the incorporation of membranes into the golgi apparatus  <cit> . golgin- <dig> is a type ii c-terminally anchored cis-golgi protein with an extensive cytoplasmic coiled-coil domain, which shows structural and sequence similarity to giantin  <cit> . however, golgin- <dig> does not appear to physically interact with other cis-golgi matrix proteins such as gm <dig>  p <dig> or grasp <dig> and therefore it is likely, that additional potential golgin84-binding molecules exist  <cit> . recently, we identified mical as a fourth rab <dig> interacting partner and suggested a link between the golgi apparatus associated rab <dig> and the intermediate filament cytoskeleton  <cit> .

here, we describe iporin as a novel interacting molecule for the active gtp-bound conformation of rab <dig>  iporin  was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen with rab1b q67r as bait and sequence analyses revealed, that the encoded protein is similar to the c-terminal half of the kiaa <dig> polypeptide. the rab1b-iporin interaction is nucleotide-dependent and rab1-specific. interestingly, the rab <dig> binding motif of iporin was mapped to a region containing a run domain, a protein motif, which is known to be involved in the function of small gtpases. furthermore we examined the intracellular localization and tissue-specific expression of iporin and give insight into its domain structure. interestingly our results also showed an interaction with the rab <dig> effector gm <dig> via its coiled-coil region  <dig>  <cit> .

RESULTS
identification of a novel rab <dig> interacting protein
with the rab1b q67r mutant as bait and a human placenta cdna library as prey we performed yeast two-hybrid screening assays to identify novel interacting partners for the active gtp-bound conformation of the small gtpase rab1b. one of the isolated clones could be identified as the human golgi matrix protein gm <dig> and a second clone encoded for a fragment of mical1b  <cit> . another interesting clone was k <dig>  which displayed a strong and specific interaction with rab1b q67r in the yeast two-hybrid system . nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that k <dig> represents the cdna sequence encoding the c-terminus of kiaa <dig> . we named the identified protein iporin  and the deleted k <dig> clone iporin Δn <dig>  since the rab <dig> effector gm <dig> has been shown to interact with various rab proteins , we wanted to investigate the rab <dig> specificity of the iporin interaction  <cit> . thus, we used an assortment of rab cdna molecules as bait constructs in yeast co-transformation assays . iporin Δn <dig>  induced strong growth and β-galactosidase activity only, when co-transformed with the permanent active mutants of rab1b  and rab1a .

results obtained from co-transformation assays in yeast. clones were cultivated on selection plates lacking tryptophan and leucine  or lacking additionally histidine and were supplemented with  <dig> mm 3-aminotriazol . the β-galactosidase activity was determined using x-gal as substrate on filter lift assays . - = no growth on selection plates or no β-galactosidase activity; +/- = background growth or β-galactosidase activity appears overnight; + = slow growth; ++ = strong growth or β-galactosidase activity appears after a few hours; +++ = very fast growth or high β-galactosidase activity.

interestingly, an interaction between iporin Δn <dig> and the wild type as well as the permanently active mutant of the yeast counterpart of mammalian rab <dig>  ypt1p, was observed pointing to a conserved interaction of these two molecules  <cit> . the empty pas2- <dig> vector, the wildtypes of the rab <dig> isoforms , permanently inactive mutants of the rab1a/b  and ypt1p  proteins were not able to significantly activate reporter gene expression . there were also no interactions of iporinΔn <dig> with the small gtpases rab <dig> and rab <dig> . these results indicate, that the interaction with iporin Δn <dig> is rab1-specific and requires the gtp-bound, active conformation of rab <dig> 

mapping the iporin binding site of rab1b
next, we wanted to analyze, which structural elements of rab1b are necessary or sufficient for the interaction with iporin. since we already demonstrated that the hypervariable regions of rab <dig> are necessary for an interaction with gm <dig>  we created rab1b mutants as well as rab1/rab <dig> chimeras   <cit> . the mutants and the chimeras enabled us to restrict specific regions for the interaction to the c- or n-terminal half of rab <dig>  co-transformation experiments in yeast revealed that only the rab1b deletion mutant rab1b q67r Δc <dig> lacking the prenylation site of rab1b showed a strong interaction with iporin Δn <dig>  suggesting that the prenylation site is not necessary for the interaction with iporin Δn <dig> . the deletion mutants rab1b q67r Δn <dig>  rab1b q67r Δc <dig> and rab1b q67r Δc163- <dig> failed to interact with iporin Δn <dig> . these mutants were constructed based on the model previously proposed by bourne et al. and valencia et al.. g1-g <dig> and pm1-pm <dig> are conserved regions in all members of the ras superfamily of gtpases, that are involved in guanine  and phosphate/mg2+  binding, respectively  <cit> . according to the proposed model suggested by seabra and coworkers, which defined rab conserved sequences as rab family motifs  and other regions as subfamily motifs , the generated mutants lack the rabsf <dig> or rabsf <dig> region   <cit> . co-transformation with the two rab1/rab <dig> chimeras displayed an interaction between the c1- and c2-rab1b q67r-rab6a chimera and iporin/iporin Δn <dig>  but not between the rab6a q72l-rab1b chimera and iporin Δn <dig> .

full-length cloning and characterization of iporin
sequence analysis of the clone k <dig> cdna revealed an open reading frame of  <dig> amino acids, which was identical to the c-terminal half of the protein encoded by the kiaa <dig> cdna . to obtain the full-length iporin sequence, we used the kiaa <dig> cdna for the amplification of the sequence encoding the missing n-terminal fragment by pcr.

information about the genomic structure of iporin protein was obtained from the human genome database. the iporin gene consists of ~ <dig> kb of genomic sequence and contains eleven exons . the gene is located on the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  and comprises  <dig> bp of coding dna. deduced from the cdna sequence, iporin comprises  <dig> amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of  <dig>  kda and an acidic pi of  <dig> . further structure analysis revealed functional domains and motifs in the iporin sequence . iporin contains some low complexity regions, which include polyproline  and polyglutamic acid  stretches. the first polyproline stretch is localized between aa  <dig> and aa  <dig> with the sequence pppgpgpdpgpsqp and a second region between aa  <dig> and aa  <dig> with the sequence ppqappp. proline-rich stretches are known to interact with sh <dig> or ww domains and could mediate further protein/protein interactions  <cit> . the polyglutamic acid stretch, spanning aa  <dig> –  <dig> with the sequence eggeeeeeeeeteevae is flanked by the two proline-rich regions. this motif is highly negatively charged and may play a role in stabilizing the protein or function as further interaction domain.

using the motif scan software  we also detected a run  domain in the iporin sequence . this domain was shown to be involved in the function of small gtpases and can also be found in proteins which play a role in proliferation, differentiation and motility  <cit> . the run domain is organized in six conserved blocks , which are predicted to constitute the "core" of a globular structure. figure 2c shows an alignment of different run domains containing proteins related to small gtpases like rpip <dig>  rabip <dig>  rufy <dig>  nesca or iporin  <cit> . run domain containing proteins enclose hydrophobic amino acids in conserved positions as shown by shaded or boxed regions . the secondary structure of the run domain core was predicted to consist of predominantly α-helices and the conserved three dimensional structure is probably of importance. however, the exact function of this motif is still unclear  <cit> .

interestingly, nesca  and iporin share 42% of sequence homology and contain both a sh <dig> domain at the c-terminus. the function of nesca is not known, but it is thought to be involved in signal transduction pathways and was recently described as a signaling adaptor which shuttles from the cytosol to the nuclear envelope  <cit> . we used nesca as a prey for yeast two-hybrid assays to investigate, whether nesca might be a further interacting partner of the small gtpase rab <dig>  however, we were not able to show an interaction between nesca and rab <dig> .

blast searches revealed a mouse homolog of iporin, est clone ai <dig>  which shows 84% similarity to the human protein. this clone encodes  <dig> amino acids, which are homologous to iporin aa  <dig> to  <dig>  the truncated mouse iporin protein contains only a run domain and we suppose that it might function in a different, but related manner, to human iporin. the c-terminus of iporin contains a sh <dig> domain , which is found in a variety of proteins   <cit> . this domain is known to interact with polyproline domains in target molecules and is involved in transmembrane signaling and cytoskeletal rearrangements  <cit> . to identify the interacting motif of the sh <dig> domain of iporin we performed a phage displayed analysis. for this purpose we screened a fuse5/15-mer m <dig> phage displayed random peptide library using purified gst-iporin sh <dig>  as a target. sequencing of the cdna from phages with a high and specific affinity towards gst-iporin sh <dig> identified a new consensus motif . this motif contains two prolines followed by an aliphatic amino acid , two further amino acids and a conserved methionine .

mapping the rab <dig> binding domain of iporin
to investigate, which part of the iporin sequence acts as a rab <dig> binding domain , we generated several deletion mutants of iporin  and tested them in yeast two-hybrid assays . as expected, the n-terminus of the protein , which is not present in the original prey clone as well as the sh <dig> domain  are not necessary for the interaction with rab1b and failed to activate the reporter genes . only the run domain-containing mutants  showed growth and β-galactosidase activity on selection plates . interestingly, the interaction of rab1b with the shortest run domain containing mutants  was weaker compared to fragments containing longer flanking sequences, which could result from protein misfolding.

to confirm the yeast two-hybrid mapping results, we performed gst-pulldown assays. bacterially expressed gst-iporin Δn847Δc <dig>  gst-iporin Δn847Δc <dig> and gst were coupled to glutathione-sepharose and incubated with extract from bhk cells overexpressing ha-tagged rab1b q67r . in this assay, the gst-iporin Δn847Δc <dig> was able to bind to the active form of rab1b, whereas gst and gst-iporin Δn847Δc <dig> failed to interact . these findings confirmed the yeast data  and indicate that the rab <dig> binding domain of iporin needs the whole run motif.

tissue-specific expression and cellular localization of iporin
northern blot analysis of various human tissues indicated, that iporin is ubiquitously expressed. the iporin mrna was identified as a prominent band of approximately  <dig>  kb. highest amounts of iporin transcripts were observed in brain and testis . these findings are consistent with the rt-pcr results, published by the kazusa institute, japan.

the cellular distribution of iporin was examined by cytosol/membrane fractionation and immunofluorescence.

although the calculated mass of iporin  is  <dig>  kda, the endogenous protein is detected at about  <dig> kda in western blot analyses . we assume that the molecular weight shift observed in the western blot analyses could result from posttranslational modifications within the aminoterminal part of the iporin molecule, because transient transfections in hela cells with aminoterminal constructs showed the highest difference between measured and calculated weight . however, in lysates from transfected hela cells expressing ha-tagged full length iporin, the affinity-purified antibody aip <dig> detected a  <dig> kda protein as did the 16b <dig> antibody, which is directed against the ha epitop .

to obtain information about the membrane association of iporin, we performed cytosol/membrane fractionation and therefore we transiently transfected hela cells with vectors encoding full-length iporin, an aminoterminal fragment  or the c-terminal fragment , respectively . transfected cells were lysed and extracts were separated by differential centrifugation steps into cytosol  and membrane  fractions. equal amounts of protein were analyzed by western blotting. calnexin distribution was used as a marker for integral membrane proteins to verify the purity of the fractions . our data demonstrate that full-length ha-iporin and ha-iporin Δn <dig> seem to associate with cellular membranes or insoluble parts of cells, because major part of the proteins was detected in the p <dig> fractions . interestingly, the ha-iporin Δc <dig> mutant, which lacks the c-terminus was highly enriched in the cytosolic fraction, indicating that parts of the c-terminus play an important role in the cellular localization of iporin . to address the question, whether the overexpression of permanently active rab1b influences the cellular distribution of iporin, we transiently transfected hela cells with vectors encoding for ha-tagged rab1b q67l and performed further fractionations . the comparison between non-transfected and transfected hela cells showed, that the overexpression of ha-rab1b q67l had no remarkable effect on the distribution of iporin. gm <dig>  p <dig> and calnexin were used as control proteins and showed as well no significant changes.

hence our aip <dig> polyclonal antibody was inapplicable for immunohistochemistry we transiently transfected hela cells with ha tagged iporin and used the anti ha-antibody 16b <dig> for staining. the immunofluorescence shows a cytosolic pattern of ha-iporin, enriched in small, brighter spots. however, most of the cells showed a faint perinuclear enriched fluorescence where usually the golgi/er structures are localized .

iporin interacts with the golgi matrix protein gm130
surprisingly, yeast two hybrid co-transformation experiments showed an additional interaction between the two rab <dig> binding proteins iporin and gm <dig>  mapping of the binding site of gm <dig> revealed, that the coiled-coil domain  <dig> is responsible for the interaction with iporin, whereas gm <dig> coiled-coil domain  <dig> mediates the interaction with rab1b   <cit> . to confirm the yeast data, we performed in vitro binding assays. recombinant gst-iporin Δn847Δc <dig> as well as gst-iporin Δn <dig> proteins were coupled to glutathione sepharose beads and then incubated with hela ss <dig> cell extracts, which expressed the gm <dig> protein in considerable amounts. after washing steps, the bound proteins were separated by sds-page and analyzed by western blotting analysis using gm <dig> antibodies. as shown in figure 6b, only gst-iporin Δn847Δc <dig> is able to bind to endogenous gm <dig>  whereas the gst-iporinΔn <dig> was unable to interact .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
the cellular function of the small gtpase rab <dig> is not fully understood, thus the identification of novel rab <dig> interacting molecules may help to elucidate its role in vesicular transport. using the yeast two-hybrid system, we were able to isolate iporin as a new protein, which specifically interacts with the activated, gtp-bound conformation of rab <dig>  interestingly, iporin also showed an interaction with the rab <dig> homolog from yeast ypt1p, indicating that formation of this protein/protein complex is conserved during evolution.

northern blot analysis of iporin mrna revealed an ubiquitous expression pattern . highest amounts of iporin mrna were observed in brain and testis, suggesting that iporin might have a distinctive role in these tissues. neurogenesis as well as spermatogenesis are processes that result in the production of highly polarized cells and we speculate that iporin might act as a regulator in these cellular systems  <cit> .

applying a set of deletion mutants and chimeras of rab <dig>  we demonstrated that the iporin binding domain is localized within the n-terminal half of rab <dig> and that the rab <dig> n-terminal hypervariable region is essential for the interaction . in contrast to pra <dig>  another known rab <dig> effector protein, our results show that the prenylation site of the rab <dig> gtpase is not necessary for the binding to iporin  <cit> . a well characterized interaction between a rab gtpase and an effector molecule is the rab3a/rabphillin-3a interacting complex  <cit> . the specific interaction of rab3a with rabphillin-3a is mediated through a rab3a "pocket" contributed by three rab complementary-determining regions , which are localized at the n- and c-terminus. the rabcdrs are proposed to form regions of variable sequences among the rab family within a structural conserved framework and act as a structural element for protein/protein interactions  <cit> . this model was supported by the work of seabra and co-workers. they defined a model of conserved regions within the rab family  and regions only conserved among the rab isoforms   <cit> . projected on a three dimensional model of rab3a, the previously described rabcdr regions are represented by the rabsf <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> regions. they form one interaction surface and the rabsf <dig> region forms another surface, almost on the opposite side  <cit> . the data presented here about the interaction of the rab1b q67r deletion mutants and the permanently active rab1b/rab6a chimeras with iporin and iporin Δ <dig>  respectively, revealed that the n-terminal half of rab1b, including rabsf <dig> and rabsf <dig>  is essential for the interaction with iporin . the c-terminal elements, comprising rabsf <dig> and rabsf <dig>  do not play a role in the formation of the complex and may be necessary for structural reasons only. surprisingly, this is in contrast to the results received from the rab3a/rabphillin-3a complex. our data suggest that iporin is able to interact with parts of both interaction surfaces. thus, these results support the theory of a multi-protein interaction interface, where molecules can interact with different parts of both surfaces.

to date, four proteins  have been identified which interact specifically with the activated conformation of rab <dig>  <cit> . gm <dig> is a cis-golgi-localized coiled-coil protein, targeted to membranes via the peripheral membrane protein grasp <dig>  <cit> . additionally, gm <dig> interacts with activated rab <dig>  rab <dig>  rab33b, the vesicle tethering-protein p <dig> and as we recently observed with iporin  <cit> . p <dig> has been identified to play a pivotal role in docking of copi vesicles to the golgi membranes by recruiting gm <dig> and giantin in a long tethering complex  <cit> . giantin is a transmembrane protein, located on copi vesicles and shares similarities with the recently identified golgin- <dig> and casp  <cit> . it is worth to note, that rab <dig> was also shown to recruit p <dig> during budding to the er-compartment to program copii vesicles for fusion  <cit> . another aspect, which has been discussed to be required for tethering events at the er-golgi stage are large multisubunit complexes like trappi . trappi has been identified in yeast to function as tethering factor with gef activity  for ypt1p  <cit> . the importance of this complex for mammalian transport steps between er and golgi remains to be clarified, but the increasing number of rab <dig> interacting molecules raises the theory of a huge protein complex with rab <dig> in a central position. another possibility might be that activated rab <dig> only mediate interactions between other proteins, e.g. iporin and gm <dig>  in a time or place dependent manner.

iporin displays some features that are quite different from the known rab <dig> interacting molecules. first gm <dig> as well as golgin- <dig> contain coiled-coil regions that are essential structural elements for the interaction with rab <dig>  <cit> . however, the rab1b binding domain of p <dig> has not been characterized so far  <cit> . iporin contains no coiled-coil regions, but interacts via a run domain with rab <dig> . second the known rab <dig> effector proteins are membrane-associated proteins, which are involved in tethering processes between donor and acceptor membranes at er-golgi compartments  <cit> . iporin displays a distribution , which is also different from known proteins belonging to the tethering complex at golgi membranes. similar to mical, the localization of iporin is not restricted to the er-golgi compartment leading to the conclusion that, in contrast to gm <dig> or grasp <dig>  iporin is not a member of the golgi matrix protein family  <cit> . the cytosol/membrane fractionation of hela cell extracts revealed a mainly membranous association  of transiently transfected and endogenous iporin, which is an evidence for a high and stable membranous association through its function . at this step, iporin might recruit further proteins to form a complex needed for a regulative purpose.

interestingly, the deletion mutants iporin Δn <dig> and iporin Δc <dig> show a different distribution in the s <dig> fraction. iporin Δc <dig> exhibits a cytosolic accumulation, which is a hint for a much weaker accessibility to membranes . this accumulation seems to be due to the missing carboxyterminal part of the protein and not the result of overexpression effects . to test the influence of overexpressed permanently active rab1b, we transiently transfected hela cells with ha-tagged rab1bq67l and compared transfected to non-transfected cells. the obtained data showed no significant effect on iporin membrane association . one could argue that the membrane association is not necessarily coupled to the interaction with rab <dig>  like gm <dig>  which is linked via the grasp <dig> protein to membranes, another protein, not yet identified, might be responsible for the attachment of iporin to membranes. in addition, the overexpression of ha-rab1bq67l had also no effect on the gm <dig> distribution, which interaction with rab <dig> is well characterized. another reason could be, that for the interaction with rab <dig> only a limited amount of iporin is sufficient and that the ha-rab1b q67l compete with the gtp-bound endogenous rab1b.

as mentioned before, iporin contains a run and a sh <dig> domain as well as proline- and glutamic acid-rich regions. these motifs have been described to function as targets for protein/protein interactions  <cit> . the run domain was previously shown to be part of the rap <dig> binding region and is supposed to mediate the interaction between the small gtpase rap <dig> and the effector protein rpip <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, the run domain of rabip <dig>  an effector protein of the small gtpase rab <dig>  has no influence on the interaction, but was supposed to be responsible for an association with a filamentous network  <cit> . we were able to map the rab <dig> interacting domain to a run domain-containing region and we suggest a rab1-specific interacting function for the run domain of iporin .

using the phage display method we identified ppΨx2m as a new sh <dig> binding motif, which is different from the originally known pxxp motif  <cit> . the iporin sh <dig> domain together with the polyproline regions may act as regulative targets for not yet identified interacting proteins. such a link was recently described for the small gtpase rab <dig>  rn-tre, a rab5-specific gtpase-activating protein  interacts with grb <dig>  this association is mediated via the sh <dig> domains of grb <dig> and the proline-rich regions of rn-tre  <cit> .

our recent discovery of an additional not yet identified interaction partner of iporin, the gm <dig>  is a very interesting piece of the "golgi puzzle" . as has been shown in this and previous manuscripts, both proteins, the iporin and gm <dig> interact with rab <dig>  <cit> . as mentioned above, gm <dig> is important for vesicle docking processes at the cis-golgi, where it interacts with p <dig>  gm <dig> itself is recruited to er-derived vesicles and vesicular-tubular clusters by the rab <dig> gtpase  <cit> . one could speculate, that iporin, while interacting with rab1b, specifies the recruitment of the incoming vesicle to the cis-golgi by displaying a high affinity to gm <dig> by finally binding to this protein. the presented data showed that the binding site of iporin is different from other gm <dig> interacting proteins. p <dig> binds to the n-terminus, rab1b to the coiled-coiled region  <dig> and grasp <dig> to the c-terminus of gm <dig>  <cit> . iporin binds to the coiled-coiled region  <dig> which means that they could bind in several ways e.g. at the same time, one after another, two at the same time, etc.

the multi-domain structure of iporin and the cellular distribution suggest that this protein might act as an adapter or scaffold protein, which links gtpases to certain intracellular signal transduction pathways. noteworthy, iporin displays several features different from known rab <dig> effector proteins. our data about the iporin-rab1-gm <dig> association demonstrate once more, that the increasing number of protein/protein interactions at different stages of er to golgi transport implies a more complex regulated network as originally thought.
