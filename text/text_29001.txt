BACKGROUND
rna binding protein hur, the ubiquitously expressed member of hu rna binding proteins  <cit> , is functionally involved in the regulation of mrna stabilization, translation, and export  <cit> . among the cellular events that are influenced by hur and its target mrnas is the process of replicative senescence. several studies have implicated hur in regulating the turnover of cyclin a, cyclin b <dig>  c-fos, sirt <dig>  and p <dig> mrnas, as well as the nuclear export of hur mrna during replicative senescence  <cit> .

although the molecular events controlling hur function are not fully understood, the cytoplasmic presence and post-translational modification  of hur are particularly important  <cit> . for example, the cell cycle checkpoint kinase chk <dig> has been shown to interact with hur and phosphorylate hur at residues s <dig>  s <dig>  and t118; phosphrylation at s <dig> seems to be important for the dissociation of the hur-sirt <dig> mrna complex in response to oxidative stress  <cit> . the cyclin-dependent kinase  <dig>  phosphorylates the hur hinge region at serine  <dig> and leads to enhanced hur association with 14-3- <dig>  thereby retaining hur in the nucleus  <cit> . additionally, studies by doller and coworkers identified hur as a substrate for both pkcα and pkcδ. the phosphorylation of hur at s <dig> by both pkcα and pkcδ is also linked to hur shuttling as well as the stabilization of cox- <dig> mrna  <cit> . these findings underscore functional links between hur and the aforementioned signaling cascades, which regulate hur shuttling or its binding to target mrnas.

besides phosphorylation, methylation is another important post-translational modification of hur. the co-activator associated arginine methyltransferase  <dig>  catalyses the methylation of hur and hud in vitro and in vivo <cit> . carm <dig> has been reported to methylate the histones  and transcriptional factors  at arginine residues, thereby activating gene transcription  <cit> . methylation by carm <dig> enhances the function of hud and hur in stabilizing tnf-α and sirt <dig> mrnas  <cit> , respectively. the r <dig> present within the hur hinge region is identified as the major methylation site by carm <dig>  <cit> . it was proposed that the interaction of hur nuclear ligands setα/β, pp <dig>  and april with the hur hinge region regulates hur shuttling  <cit> . however, thus far, the functional impact of carm1-mediated hur methylation on replicative senescence and the precise mechanism underlying remain largely unexplored.

in this study, by using two approaches to mimic the hypomethylation of hur, knockdown of carm <dig> and mutation of hur at the major methylation site , we have investigated the functional impact of the carm1-mediated hur methylation and the mechanisms underlying in replicative senescence. our results indicate that the methylation by carm <dig> is critical for hur to regulate the turnover of mrnas encoding cyclin a, cyclin b <dig>  c-fos, sirt <dig>  and p <dig> in replicative senescence.

RESULTS
methylation by carm <dig> enhances the effect of hur in regulating the turnover of cyclin a, cyclin b <dig>  c-fos, sirt <dig>  and p <dig> mrnas
because hur has been reported to stabilize cyclin a, cyclin b <dig>  c-fos, and sirt <dig> mrnas, and destabilize p <dig> mrna  <cit> , we asked if carm1-mediated hur methylation influences the expression of these genes. to begin to answer this question, whole-cell lysates from hela cells silenced carm <dig> were subjected to immunoprecipitation assays  by using hur antibody, whereupon the levels of methylated and total hur in the ip materials were determined by western blot analysis using m/dma and hur antibodies, respectively. as shown in figure 1a, the level of methylated hur  was reduced by ~80% in cells with silenced carm <dig>  while total hur levels remained unchanged. by western blot analysis, knockdown of carm <dig> reduced the protein levels of carm <dig> , cyclin a , cyclin b <dig> , c-fos , and sirt <dig> , and increased the protein level of p <dig>  . in agreement with the results shown in figure 1a, knockdown of carm <dig> did not alter hur protein abundance. these results suggest that carm1-mediated methylation may enhance the effect of hur in regulating the turnover of its target mrnas. to confirm this point, the levels of cyclin a, cyclin b <dig>  c-fos, sirt <dig>  and p <dig> in hela cells expressing flag-hur  or flag-hurΔ  were assessed by western blotting. a mutant hur bearing an arginine-to-lysine mutation on residue  <dig>  identified as the major methylation site of hur  <cit>  was expressed as a fusion protein . after ip using anti-flag antibody , the methylation status of flag-hur and flag-hurΔ was assessed by western blotting using m/dma antibody, as described in figure 1a. as shown in figure 1c, the methylation of flag-hurΔ  was reduced by ~80% relative to that of flag-hur . on the other hand, knockdown of carm <dig> reduced the methylation status of flag-hur  , but not that of flag-hurΔ . we next tested the protein levels of cyclin a, cyclin b <dig>  c-fos, sirt <dig>  and p <dig> in hela cells expressing flag-hur  or flag-hurΔ  by western blotting. in keeping with previous findings  <cit> , expression of flag-hur  increased the levels of cyclin a , cyclin b <dig> , c-fos , and sirt <dig> , and reduced the levels of p <dig> , compared to the levels of these proteins in cells transfected with the empty vector  . however, expression of flag-hurΔ  elicited a much weaker effect on protein levels: cyclin a increased only by ~ <dig>  fold, cyclin b <dig> by ~ <dig>  fold, c-fos by ~ <dig>  fold, and sirt <dig> by ~ <dig>  fold, while p <dig> levels were reduced by ~60% .

we next asked if carm <dig> functions through methylating hur. hela cells were transfected with hur sirna, carm <dig> sirna or both sirnas, and  <dig> h later, the levels of cyclin a, cyclin b <dig>  c-fos, sirt <dig>  and p <dig> were assessed by western blot analysis. as anticipated, knockdown of hur  or carm <dig>  individually reduced the levels of cyclin a, cyclin b <dig>  c-fos, and sirt <dig>  and increased the levels of p <dig> . however, joint knockdown of hur and carm <dig>  was not more effective than individual knockdown of hur or carm <dig> . in sum, by methylating hur, carm <dig> is able to regulate the expression of cyclin a, cyclin b <dig>  c-fos, sirt <dig>  and p <dig> 

next, we measured the levels and half-lives of cyclin a, cyclin b <dig>  c-fos, sirt <dig>  and p <dig> mrnas in cells described in figure 1b and 1d, as described in ‘methods’. as shown in figure 2a, silencing carm <dig> reduced the levels of cyclin a , cyclin b <dig> , c-fos , and sirt <dig> , but induced that of p <dig> . as anticipated, knockdown of carm <dig> shortened the half-lives of cyclin a , cyclin b <dig> , c-fos , and sirt <dig>  mrnas, and extended the half-life of p <dig> mrna  . as a negative control, knockdown of carm <dig> did not influence the levels  orhalf-lives  of β-tublin mrna . in keeping with previous findings  <cit> , expression of flag-hur  increased the mrna levels of cyclin a , cyclin b <dig> , c-fos , and sirt <dig> , but decreased that of p <dig>  . the marked changes in steady-state levels for these mrnas were due in part to changes in their stabilities . in contrast, expression of flag-hurΔ  had a much weaker effect, increasing cyclin a mrna levels by ~ <dig>  fold, cyclin b <dig> mrna by ~  <dig>  fold, c-fos mrna by ~  <dig>  fold, and sirt <dig> mrna by ~  <dig>  fold, and reducing p <dig> mrna by ~40% . as above, these changes were due in part by changes in the half-lives of these mrnas: cyclin a mrna , cyclin b <dig> mrna , c-fos mrna , sirt <dig> mrna , and p <dig> mrna  ]. as a negative control, the levels  and half-lives  of β-tublin mrna in cells expressing flag-hur were comparable to that observed in cells expressing flag-hurΔ . these results suggest that methylation by carm <dig> enhances hur’s ability to regulate the turnover of cyclin a, cyclin b <dig>  c-fos, sirt <dig>  and p <dig> mrnas.

methylation by carm <dig> enhances the association of hur with p <dig> 3′utr, but not cyclin a, cyclin b <dig>  c-fos, and sirt <dig> 3′utr
since the changes in hur target mrna half-lives occurred in the cytoplasm, it is important to ask if methylation of hur by carm <dig> influenced the levels of cytoplasmic hur. to this end, the cytoplasmic, nuclear, and whole-cell fractions from cells described in figure 1b and 1d were prepared as described  <cit>  and the presence of hur in different cellular fractions was assessed by western blot analysis. as shown in figure 3a, knockdown of carm1had no influence on the presence of hur in the cytoplasm or the nucleus. similarly, the total , cytoplasmic , and nuclear levels  of flag-hur  and flag-hurΔ  were relatively similar . therefore, methylation by carm <dig> did not markedly alter the subcellular distribution of hur.

besides its localization, the interaction of hur with target mrnas influences its ability to regulate mrna turnover or translation. to further test the influence of carm1-mediated methylation on the interaction of hur with rna, biotinylated fragments of cyclin a, cyclin b <dig>  c-fos, sirt <dig>  and p <dig> 3′utrs and cytoplasmic extracts described in figure 3a and 3b were used for pull-down and rnp ip assays, as previously described  <cit> . as shown in figure 3c and 3d, knockdown of carm <dig> had no influence on the association of hur with the 3′utrs of cyclin a, cyclin b <dig>  c-fos, and sirt <dig> mrnas. in addition, the association of flag-hur  and flag-hurΔ  with the 3′utr of cyclin a, cyclin b <dig>  c-fos, and sirt <dig> was comparable . however, changing hur methylation either by silencing carm <dig>  or by mutating the hur methylation site  markedly lowered the association of hur with p <dig> 3′utr. in a previous study, hur and auf <dig> were found to bind with the p <dig> 3′utr and destabilize p <dig> mrna cooperatively  <cit> . to address whether methylation of hur by carm <dig> influences the association of auf <dig> with p <dig> 3′utr, the lysates described in figure 3c and 3e were used for pull-down and rnp ip assays. as shown in figure 3g and 3h , in cells with silenced carm <dig>  the association of auf <dig> with p <dig> 3′utr was markedly reduced. moreover, in cells expressing flag-hurΔ , the association of auf <dig> with the p <dig> 3′utr was substantially weaker than that observed from cells expressing flag-hur  . these results suggest that methylation by carm <dig> enhances the association of hur with the p <dig> 3′utr, and in turn, enhances the association of auf <dig> with the p <dig> 3′utr.

carm1- hur regulatory process impacts on replicative senescence
hur regulates replicative senescence at least in part by stabilizing cyclin a, cyclin b <dig>  c-fos, and sirt <dig> mrnas as well as destabilizing p <dig> mrna  <cit> . to address whether the methylation of hur by carm <dig> impacts upon replicative senescence, we first examined the levels of carm <dig> and the methylation status of hur in early-passage  and late-passage  human diploid fibroblasts  by western blotting. as shown in figure 4a, the levels of carm <dig> in senescent 2bs cells  were markedly reduced relative to the levels in young 2bs cells . as a positive control, hur protein levels in the senescent cells were also potently reduced, in keeping with previous findings  <cit> . to evaluate the methylation status of hur in senescent cells, hur was immunoprecipitated from lysates prepared from cells described in figure 4a. the ip materials then were subjected to western blot analysis using the m/dma antibody. as anticipated, the levels of both methylated hur  and total- hur  were markedly reduced in senescent cells . in addition, reduction of hur and carm <dig> protein levels as well as the hur methylation levels was accompanied with the decrease of the association of hur with cyclin a, cyclin b <dig>  c-fos, sirt <dig>  and p <dig> mrnas in senescent cells .

next, we evaluated the functional impact of the methylation of hur by carm <dig> in replicative senescence. 2bs cells were transfected with a vector expressing carm <dig> shrna or control shrna and selected by g <dig> for 3 weeks. as indicated in figure 5a, knockdown of carm <dig> led to a reduction in the levels of cyclin a , cyclin b <dig> , c-fos , and sirt <dig> , and to an induction in p <dig> levels  . knockdown of carm <dig> decreased s and g <dig> compartments  and increased the number of sa-β-gal positive cells  . in accordance with previous findings  <cit> , 2bs cells stably transfected with a vector expressing flag-hur  increased the protein levels of cyclin a , cyclin b <dig> , c-fos , and sirt <dig> , and decreased the levels of p <dig>  , thereby increasing the s and g <dig> compartments , and decreasing the number of sa-β-gal positive cells  . in contrast, expressing flag-hurΔ  was less effective than expressing flag-hur  in inducing the levels of cyclin a , cyclin b <dig> , c-fos , and sirt <dig> , and reducing p <dig> protein level  . accordingly, expressing flag-hurΔ was less effective than expressing flag-hur in increasing the s and g <dig> compartments , as well as in decreasing the number of sa-β-gal positive cells  . these findings suggest that the carm1- hur regulatory process impacts upon the process of replicative senescence.

discussion
the present study provides novel insight into the regulation of hur function in replicative senescence. by modulating the hur methylation status, we gained evidence to support the view that methylation by carm <dig> critically affects hur’s ability to regulate the levels of cyclin a, cyclin b <dig>  c-fos, sirt <dig>  and p <dig> as well as the process of cell senescence .

reduced hur levels and cytoplasmic concentration have been linked to the lower expression of cyclin a, cyclin b <dig>  c-fos, and sirt <dig> and the increased expression of p <dig> in replicative senescence  <cit> . thus, signaling events that regulate the relative levels of hur in the nucleus and the cytoplasm may also involve in the process of cell aging  <cit> . although the mechanism controlling hur shuttling has not been fully elucidated, the hinge region of hur is of great importance for its nuclear localization  <cit> . because the arg <dig> localizes at the hinge region, we hypothesized that the methylation of hur by carm <dig> may elevate the expression of hur targets by increasing the cytoplasmic presence of hur. however, lowering hur methylation by either silencing carm <dig> or mutating the major methylation site had no effect on the shuttling of hur . it is also possible that methylation of hur affects its rna-binding affinity because methylation may affect the interaction of hur with the hinge-binding proteins, which could in turn modulate rna binding  <cit> . indeed, ithas been reported that methylation by carm <dig> could enhance the association of hur with sirt <dig> 3′utr during the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells   <cit> . here, loss of hur methylation either by silencing carm <dig> or by mutating the major methylation site did not influence the association of hur with the 3′utrs of sirt <dig>  cyclin a, cyclin b <dig> or c-fos. however, methylation of hur by carm <dig> enhanced the association of hur to p <dig> 3′utr . therefore, whether methylation by carm <dig> influences the binding affinity of hur may not only depend on the methylation status of hur and the mrnas targeting by hur, but also on the type and physiologic state of the cell in which the hur-mrna interaction occurs.

in addition to hur and hud, methylation of poly-binding protein  <dig>  ca <dig>  the sap <dig>  smb, and the u <dig> small nuclear rnp-specific protein u1c has been implicated in the process of mrna stabilization as well as the 5′ splice site selection of the pre-mrna splicing  <cit> . methylation of hnrnp a <dig>  the nuclear poly -binding protein pabpn <dig>  and the poly -binding proteins sam <dig> and slm by prmt <dig> influences their function and proper localization  <cit> . because both the expression and methylation status of hur significantly decline with replicative senescence , it is challenging to evaluate the contribution of carm1-mediated methylation to the reduction of hur methylation in senescent cells. however, the evidence presented here  suggests that the carm1- hur regulatory process do contribute to the regulation of genes associated with replicative senescence. although the links between human aging and replicative senescence are not fully understood, senescent cells accumulate with advancing age and actively contribute to physiologic and pathologic changes of aging. our finding that carm <dig> contributes to the alterations of cyclin a, cyclin b <dig>  c-fos, sirt <dig>  and p <dig> in replicative senescence warrants a careful look at carm <dig> in other models of aging. in light of the fact that hur is also an important regulator of cell death  <cit> , cell differentiation  <cit> , and human cancer  <cit> , we postulate that carm1-hur regulatory process may impact upon these processes as well.

CONCLUSIONS
carm1-mediated protein methylation enhances the function of hur upon the turnover of mrnas encoding cyclin a, cyclin b <dig>  c-fos, sirt <dig>  and p <dig>  methylation by carm <dig> did not influence hur subcellular distribution or association with the 3′utrs of cyclin a, cyclin b <dig>  c-fos, and sirt <dig> mrnas, but it enhanced the association of hur with the p <dig> 3′utr. by methylating hur, carm <dig> critically regulates replicative senescence.
