BACKGROUND
in multi-gene phylogenetic analyses, gene phylogenies, which represent the evolutionary histories of particular genes, commonly differ from the overall species phylogeny, which represents the evolutionary relationships of the organisms as a whole. multiple biological phenomena have been proposed to explain such incongruence, including hybridization  <cit> , deep coalescence ), recombination  <cit> , horizontal gene transfer  <cit> , and gene extinction and duplication  <cit> . clearly, the possibility that such processes contribute to observed incongruence in gene trees complicates the inference of species phylogenies from multilocus data  <cit> . most of the currently used methods for species tree estimation focus on modeling only one source of incongruence. for example, several software packages have been developed to estimate species phylogenies under the assumption that ils is the only process contributing to variability in the underlying gene trees  <cit> .

however, others have attempted to consider more than one process simultaneously. in particular, several groups have considered both hybridization and ils in a phylogenetic framework  <cit> . in this paper, we consider this problem in the case in which several individuals are sampled from each species of interest, and gene phylogenies without branch length information are used to assess the support for hybridization in the presence of ils. we do this by extending the method of meng and kubatko  <cit>  in two ways. first, we allow for the possibility of intraspecific sampling of any number of individuals within each species, and second we provide a more efficient algorithm for estimation of speciation times and times of hybridization events. the newly-developed methodology has been implemented in a perl script that is available for download from http://www.stat.osu.edu/~lkubatko/software/hybtree/.

our work is motivated by empirical studies of north american massasauga rattlesnakes , a group for which putative hybrids have been identified. massasauga rattlesnakes are currently classified into three distinct subspecies: sistrurus catenatus catenatus, found in eastern north america east of the mississippi river, s. c. tergeminus, found in the central united states , and s. c. edwardsii, found in the southwestern united states . a recent analysis of this species based on  <dig> nuclear genes and one mitochondrial gene found evidence for genetic distinctiveness of these three subspecies  <cit> , with strongest support for distinctiveness of s. c. catenatus, the eastern massasauga, from the two western subspecies. this finding is important because the eastern massasauga is a candidate for listing as a federally threatened or endangered species in the united states.

in northwest and central missouri, gloyd  <cit>  and evans and gloyd  <cit>  identified populations containing individuals that were morphologically intermediate between two subspecies  with adjacent distributions to the east and west, respectively, of these populations . although populations in this area are currently classified as s. c. catenatus  <cit>  it is unknown if these snakes are true genetic hybrids or whether their morphological intermediacy is due to other evolutionary or ecological factors. in addition to a possible hybrid origin of these populations, gibbs et al.  <cit>  provided genetic evidence based on microsatellite and mitochondrial markers that individuals in the missouri populations may be pure s. c. tergeminus individuals. here, we further examine the question of the hybrid origin of these populations by applying our newly-developed methodology to data collected from  <dig> of the genes previously used by kubatko et al.  <cit> .

we begin by first carrying out a simulation study to assess the ability of the newly proposed method to detect hybridization in the presence of ils for genetic data that mimics that available in our empirical study. we then apply our methodology to the empirical data to address the question of hybridization in the ancestry of the massasauga rattlesnakes from missouri. in addition to testing our method, we analyze both our simulated and empirical data using one of the popular methods for species tree inference, best . best explicitly models ils, but does not incorporate hybridization. we then apply both of these methods to the empirical data to address the question of hybridization in the ancestry of the massasauga rattlesnakes from missouri.

RESULTS
hybridization model
in the context of the coalescent process  <cit> , meng and kubatko  <cit>  describe a model in which, given a species tree topology and a set of gene tree topologies assumed to be correct, estimates of the proportion of hybridization, γ, may be obtained for an a priori specified hybrid population. their method additionally provides estimates of the branch lengths along the known species tree topology, and proposes a likelihood ratio test of the null hypothesis that the putative hybrid population is derived entirely from one parental species. here, we present an approach that uses this same model but with two important modifications: first, it allows for the incorporation of multiple individuals per species; second, we replace the grid search for the maximum likelihood estimates of the branch lengths and the γ parameter used by meng and kubatko  <cit>  with a search that utilizes brent's method  <cit> , an optimization technique for one-dimensional functions. for functions that are suitably parabolic near the extrema, brent's method can find extrema rapidly  <cit> . we apply brent's method iteratively until convergence criteria have been reached. further detail about each of these steps is given in the materials and methods section.

simulation study
to examine the performance of our method of assessing evidence for hybridization in the presence of ils, we first conducted a simulation study using the hybrid species phylogeny in figure  <dig> as the model tree. using the species tree in figure  <dig>  ten gene trees were simulated, with the number of gene trees derived from each parental species tree drawn from a binomial distribution with probability equal to the true proportion of hybridization . sequence data were then simulated from each gene tree. using this sequence data, the ten gene trees were estimated using maximum likelihood. these gene trees were used in our approach to estimate the proportion of hybridization of the putative hybrid species and the species tree branch lengths, and a likelihood ratio test was performed at level α =  <dig> . we then applied best to the same simulated sequence data to calculate the posterior probability of the putative hybrid species sharing its most recent common ancestor with each parental taxon. we repeated this procedure  <dig> times each for four levels of hybridization . these simulation settings were selected in order to mimic the conditions under which our empirical data were obtained. in the discussion, we comment on some limitations of these settings and speculate on how the method might be expected to perform in other situations.

the results of this simulation study are shown in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  specifically, the table gives the average values of the maximum likelihood estimates  of the hybridization parameter γ, as well as the average mles of the branch lengths in the hybrid species tree, t <dig>  t <dig>  and t <dig> , while figure  <dig> shows histograms of these parameters. standard deviations of the mles across the  <dig> replicates are also given. overall, the average estimates of γ were close to their true values, indicating that the method has good ability to estimate the contribution from each parental taxon to the hybrid species. the standard deviations indicate a fair amount of variability in these estimates, but given that the simulation study was based on a sample of only  <dig> loci, this is not unexpected. the variability can be predicted to decrease as the number of loci sampled increases, as was observed in the simulation study of meng and kubatko  <cit>  when only a single sequence per species was considered.

results of the simulation study for varying γ using the model hybrid species tree in figure  <dig>  the value of γ used to simulate the data is shown in column  <dig>  columns  <dig> and  <dig> give the mean and standard deviation  of the mles of γ over the  <dig> replicates. similarly, columns  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and  <dig> and  <dig> give the means and sds of the mles of the branch length estimates. column  <dig> gives the power of the likelihood ratio test of the null hypothesis that γ =  <dig> 

in contrast, the branch lengths were consistently overestimated by our method, especially near the node where hybridization occurred. this is at least in part explained by the fact that on some proportion of the the trials, the mle of these branch lengths was estimated to be at the pre-defined boundary of  <dig>  coalescent units . however, examination of the distribution of the estimates in figure  <dig> shows that even if these boundary cases are excluded, the mles of the branch lengths are upwardly biased. we return to this issue in the discussion.

information about the number of times branch lengths are estimated to be at the boundary in the simulated data set. column  <dig> gives the value of γ used to simulate the data. columns  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> give the number of trials  for which the mle of the particular branch length is estimated to be at the boundary.

the estimated power of the likelihood ratio test  is shown in the far right column of table  <dig>  as expected, the power of the test increases as γ increases, indicating that it becomes easier to detect hybridization as the two parental species contribute more equally to the genome of the hybrid species. we also note that when there is no hybridization , the test achieves the desired  <dig>  level.

results of the analysis of the simulated data using best  <cit> . column  <dig> gives the value of γ used to simulate the data. columns  <dig> and  <dig> give the average posterior probability  and the standard deviation of the posterior probabilities  assigned to the clade containing taxa h and p <dig> over the  <dig> trials. columns  <dig> and  <dig>  and  <dig> and  <dig>  give the app and sdpp for the clades h and p <dig>  and p <dig> and p <dig>  respectively.

empirical data
to study the possibility of hybridization in the missouri massasauga populations, we used dna sequence data for twelve of the genes analyzed by kubatko et al.  <cit> . we included four individuals of pure s. c. catenatus and four of pure s. c. tergeminus orgin, as well as four individuals of putative hybrid origin. two agkistrodon individuals were used as the outgroup taxa. the fixed phylogeny relating these taxa and showing the putative hybridization event is given in figure  <dig>  details of the loci and individuals used in the analysis are given in the materials and methods.

when we applied our method to this data set, we found that the mle of γ was identically  <dig>  indicating that the putative hybrid populations contained individuals that were entirely s. c. tergeminus in origin, with no shared ancestry with s. c. catenatus. estimated branch lengths  along the hybrid species phylogeny were t <dig> =  <dig> , t <dig> =  <dig> , and t <dig> =  <dig>  . the rapid divergence times for t <dig> and t <dig> indicate that ils is a much more likely explanation for any observed gene tree/species tree incongruence than hybridization. these results are in strong agreement with those found by gibbs et al.  <cit> , who showed using independent genetic data that putative hybrid individuals were most likely entirely s. c. tergeminus in origin.

finally, we also analyzed the rattlesnake data set using best under the same settings used in the simulation study. the posterior probability of s. c. tergeminus and the potential hybrids as a clade was  <dig> . the posterior probabilities of s. c. catenatus and the potential hybrids, and of s. c. catenatus and s. c. tergeminus each as distinct clades were low . these results are in agreement with our findings from using the model for hybridization.

discussion
our results show a striking improvement in the power of the likelihood ratio test over that observed by meng and kubatko  <cit> , suggesting that the incorporation of multiple samples per species has a significant impact on our ability to detect hybridization when it occurs. at a sample size of ten genes, they observed powers of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  at true hybridization levels of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively, which are much lower than we observed . their study showed an increase in power when the number of genes increased from  <dig> to  <dig>  and we might expect corresponding gains in power in our setting as well. however, it is not clear how the number of genes and the number of samples per taxon might interact, and this would need to be carefully examined in further simulation studies. in addition, the study of meng and kubatko  <cit>  did not simulate variability in gene trees due to estimation from sequence data. they simulated gene trees directly, rather than simulating sequence data from gene trees and using the gene trees estimated from the sequence data as the data for estimating hybridization, as we have done here. our results therefore indicate that even a small sample of genes can be used to effectively detect hybridization when intra-specific sampling within taxa is used. we hypothesize that sampling more individuals than examined in this study would increase the power of our method, though gains may diminish as the total sample size becomes large. inclusion of any number of tips per species is allowed by the perl script posted online.

while our method showed good ability to estimate γ and to test for evidence of hybridization in the presence of ils, estimation of speciation times and the time of hybridization proved to be much more difficult. one problem we encountered was that speciation times were commonly estimated to be too large . as an example, figure  <dig> shows the likelihood as a function of each of the hybrid species tree branch lengths, as well as γ, holding the other branch lengths fixed, for one of the data sets simulated with γ =  <dig> . we see that the likelihood as a function of t <dig> increases to an asymptotic level. in this data set, each gene tree topology is topologically concordant  with one of the two species tree topologies. hence, ils alone is not needed to explain the observed gene tree/species tree incongruence, as all of the observed gene trees can be adequately explained by hybridization in the absence of ils. the likelihood function is thus optimized as the probability of coalescence of all lineages approaches  <dig> along the branch with length t <dig>  which occurs as t <dig> approaches infinity. at true branch lengths of  <dig>  coalescent units, this type of data set occurs somewhat frequently under the coalescent model, particularly when the number of genes sampled is  <dig>  we would expect that species tree branch lengths could be more accurately estimated in two situations. first, one could sample a larger number of genes, which would then provide increased information about branch lengths through the opportunity to observe more incongruence in gene trees. second, shorter branch lengths in the species tree would lead to more observed incongruence among gene trees, thus again providing more information for branch length estimation.

however, even after excluding all data sets where boundary values are reached, the method still systematically overestimates branch lengths . one possible explanation for this is our optimization technique, which involves the sequential optimization of one parameter at a time. in the four-dimensional domain of a complex likelihood function, it is possible that by first optimizing γ and then each branch length in turn, we are only approaching local, rather than global, maxima. while we could implement a simultaneous optimization procedure, we have not done this primarily because such an optimization scheme cannot easily be generalized to larger problems. this is consistent with the fact that most phylogenetic algorithms for optimization of branch lengths in single gene phylogenies  find ml branch lengths by sequentially considering the branches. however, it is also possible that the optimization technique is not the issue - it may be that information from  <dig> gene tree topologies only  is not sufficient to precisely estimate species tree branch lengths. fan and kubatko  <cit>  also observed biases in the estimation of branch lengths when using only gene trees without branch length information in the inference procedure.

while the method proposed here does not use information concerning the gene tree branch lengths, methods that do incorporate gene tree branch length information to estimate times to speciation events have been developed , and this information has been used to study hybridization as well  <cit> . in general, if accurate gene tree branch length information is available, these methods would be expected to perform better than the method proposed here, because the branch lengths would provide additional information about the species-level relationships. however, misleading information concerning gene tree branch lengths could cause bias in these methods, while leaving the method we propose here unaffected. therefore, if the accuracy of branch length estimates is unknown, it would be better to use a simpler method which does not incorporate gene tree branch lengths. in particular, in cases where there has been recent, rapid divergence , gene tree branch lengths are difficult to estimate accurately, and the method proposed here provides a reasonable alternative.

our simulation settings were designed to mimic the properties of the empirical massasauga data set, and thus are limited in some ways. for example, only hybridization between sister taxa was considered, and branch lengths in the model species tree were set to  <dig>  coalescent units. in regard to hybridization between non-sister taxa, we might expect that this will be easier to distinguish from incomplete lineage sorting than a hybridization event between sister taxa would be, because mis-sorting of ancestral lineages is more common between closely related species. indeed, this is what was found in the simulation study of meng and kubatko  <cit>  when only a single individual per species was sampled. we also note that as branch lengths in the hybrid species tree increase, the amount of deep coalescence decreases since it becomes more probable that lineages coalesce in their ancestral populations. thus it is expected that the longer the species tree branch lengths, the easier it will be to distinguish hybridization from incomplete lineage sorting. this is again supported by the results of meng and kubatko  <cit>  for the case of a single individual.

our approach could be extended in a number of ways. if multiple hybridization events are suspected to have occurred, one could incorporate a separate γ parameter for each putative hybridization event. the likelihood function is easily expanded to cover these situations . the extension is especially straightforward when hybridization events occur between distinct pairs of sister taxa. complexities in calculations occur if multiple hybridization events occur along one branch in the tree, or in cases when hybridization events result from clades which have undergone hybridization events. nakhleh et al.  <cit>  have considered these kinds of situations in a parsimony framework.

when a putative hybrid taxon cannot be identified a priori, one could gain a greater understanding of gene flow between three species by iteratively using this method when each species is considered the putative hybrid. in the general case of n ingroup species and under the setting of one potential hybridization event, this would increase computational time by a factor of 3×n <dig>  this method is implemented in the script called iterate provided at the web address given above. alternatively, given a known topology for a species tree one could iteratively perform this method on each  branch of the species tree to try to detect possible hybridization events across closely related species. if each tip was in turn considered the hybrid taxon and was placed at each possible internal branch as a hybrid arising from a relationship with the sister lineage of the selected internal branch, then nn- <dig> possible relationships would need to be considered.

we found that use of the posterior probability estimated by best provided a good indication of the extent of historical hybridization on average, but that the variability was large, indicating that the method may not be very informative on a case-by-case basis. while best is only one of a collection of possible methods for estimating species trees using multilocus data, we expect that other methods will perform similarly. in particular, *beast  <cit>  also provides estimates of the posterior probability associated with clades in a coalescent-only framework, though using a different algorithm to carry out the markov chain monte carlo, and thus we expect its performance to be similar. these results highlight the need for the development of methods that explicitly incorporate hybridization into the model, such as the one we propose here.

our study provides genetic evidence that the hybrid populations of massasauga rattlesnakes in missouri are not hybrids at all, but rather entirely s. c. tergeminus in origin. although our method may not, in general, be able to discriminate between hybridization and low levels of introgression, our results are confirmed by another analysis of an independent data set  <cit>  that also came to the conclusion that the snakes in missouri are not hybrids and that their morphological variation does not coincide with patterns of genetic differentiation. as noted by gibbs et al.  <cit> , this finding has several implications for the conservation status of these snakes. first, it indicates that s. c. catenatus, which is being considered for listing as a federally threatened or endangered species in the united states, has a lower range-wide total population size than previously believed since missouri populations can no longer be included in this estimate. second, it provides additional evidence against the classification of massasauga populations in missouri as the federally-listed s. c. catenatus since multiple sources of genetic data indicate that they are in fact s. c. tergeminus. however, state protection may be warranted as s. c. tergeminus is rare within missouri  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have presented a new method for testing for hybridization or for estimating the extent of hybridization using multi-locus data with intraspecific samples among species. using simulation, we have demonstrated that our method has good ability to detect hybridization when it is present, with increases in power due to increasing equality of contributions from both parental taxa and due to sampling more lineages within each species. while our method tends to overestimate times of speciation and hybridization, we expect estimates to improve as more genes are sampled. our simulation studies also show that methods that do not explicitly model hybridization, such as best  <cit> , may not give an accurate estimates of species relationships, thus highlighting the need for development of methods, such as the one presented here, that explicitly model hybridization in the presence of ils.

when applied to an empirical data set for a hypothesized hybrid population of sistrurus rattlesnakes, we fail to reject the hypothesis that ils alone adequately explains the observed incongruence in single gene phylogenies. the estimate of the hybridization parameter indicates that the hybrid population is entirely s. c. tergeminus in origin, in agreement with the conclusions reached by gibbs et al.  <cit>  using different data and methodology. these findings have implications in missouri and elsewhere for the conservation of massasauga rattlesnakes.
