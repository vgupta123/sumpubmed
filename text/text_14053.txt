BACKGROUND
the occurrence of knotted dna molecules is common in biological systems. dna knots were first observed in vitro near four decades ago in single-stranded dna rings incubated with bacterial topoisomerase i  <cit>  and in double-stranded dna molecules extracted from phage p <dig>  <cit> . later on, dna knots were discovered in plasmids undergoing transcription and replication in bacteria with deficient topoisomerase activity  <cit> . along these findings, the development of electron microscopy for reca-coated dna molecules  <cit>  and of high resolution agarose gel electrophoresis  <cit>  allowed the identification of numerous knot types shaped into dna. knot analyses with these techniques had been very useful to infer physical properties of double stranded dna. for instance, the effective diameter of duplex dna was determined from the fraction of knotted circles found after the circularization of linear dna molecules that joined cohesive ends in free solution  <cit> . also, the specific knot types produced when dna recombinases  <cit>  and topoisomerases  <cit>  act on circular dna was informative to reconstruct the architecture of these protein-dna ensembles. however, the biological relevance and potential applications of knotted dna molecules remain to be explored. dna knots could play a role in the high order organization of chromosomes, yet they should not interfere dna replication and transcription. knotted dna molecules will be also useful to further investigate biophysical properties of constrained dna, as well as the activity of topoisomerases, recombinases and other dna interacting ensembles. to facilitate these studies, a method to produce abundant dna knots would be highly valuable. here we developed the p <dig> phage system as a convenient source of knotted dna.

the mechanisms of genome propagation by phage p <dig> had been elucidated thanks to the studies of richard calendar and colleagues  <cit> . p <dig> is a satellite phage that needs the helper prophage p <dig> for proliferation. when p <dig> infects a bacterial host lysogenic for p <dig>  the  <dig>  kb p <dig> genome is injected as a linear double-stranded dna that quickly circularizes by ligation of its terminal cohesive ends  <cit> . p <dig> uses then the machinery of p <dig> to amplify and package its own genome. contrary to phage lambda, which packages its genome from replicated linear dna multimers, p <dig> uses covalently closed dna circles as a preferred substrate for dna packaging  <cit> . each p <dig> dna circle is cleaved at the 55-bp cos sequence to produce a linear molecule with the 19-bp cohesive ends, which is actively threaded into a p <dig> capsid  <cit> . newly made p <dig> phages lead then to bacterial lysis and start a new infective cycle. these studies soon conducted to the discovery that a large fraction of dna molecules extracted from phage p <dig> were highly knotted nicked dna circles  <cit> . formation of these knots was found enhanced in p <dig> phage derivatives with genome deletions  <cit>  and in tailless-mutants  <cit> . subsequent research indicated that dna knot formation was caused by the premature circularization of the p <dig> genome inside the small volume of the phage capsid  <cit> .

p <dig> dna knots are complex, heterogeneous and can be purified in preparative amounts  <cit> . because dna circularization results from non-covalent joining of 19-bp cohesive ends  <cit> , the knots can be directly analyzed without requiring enzymatic nicking. otherwise the knots can be readily converted into covalently closed dna circles by a brief reaction with dna ligase. however, one drawback of this natural system is that knot formation is restricted to the viral dna. hence, we asked whether other dna molecules, of length and sequence different than p <dig> dna, could be packaged inside p <dig> capsids and recovered also as highly knotted forms. accordingly, we envisaged that a bacterial plasmid containing the p <dig> cos sequence  could be cleaved and threaded into a viral capsid in the course of a bacterial infection by phage p <dig> . therefore, we constructed different p <dig> cosmids and introduced them in bacteria lysogenic for p <dig>  these bacteria were then infected with p <dig> phage and the dna in newly formed viral particles was analysed. we found that cosmids as small as  <dig> kb were packaged inside p <dig> capsids. more interestingly, as well p <dig> dna, such cosmids were recovered in the form of highly knotted dna circles.

RESULTS
construction of dna cosmids for in vivo packaging in phage p4
linear p <dig> dna molecules were converted into covalently closed dna circles by annealing their terminal 19-bp cohesive ends and sealing them with dna ligase. digestion with restriction endonucleases ecor <dig> and bamh <dig> generated an  <dig> bp fragment that contained the joined p <dig> cos sequences. this fragment was inserted in several plasmids to generate p <dig> cosmids of different length, such as p4cos- <dig>  p4cos- <dig> and p4cos- <dig> . p <dig> cosmids were introduced in the e. coli strain c- <dig> and transformants were selected by ampicillin resistance. bacteria harbouring cosmids were infected with phage p <dig> vir <dig> del <dig>  which has a  <dig>  kb genome deletion that enhances its knotting probability. replicated phages released upon bacterial lysis were purified. the amounts of phage particles containing p <dig> dna or cosmid dna were then estimated by their capacity for infecting  or for delivering the cosmid  to new host bacteria, respectively. relative to the amount of infective p <dig> phages recovered, the fraction of p <dig> particles able to deliver the cosmid to new e. coli cells was 3% for p4cos- <dig>  12% for p4cos- <dig> and < <dig> % for p4cos- <dig>  therefore, p4cos- <dig> and p4cos- <dig>  but not p4cos- <dig>  appeared to be packaged in phage particles. similar experiments with other dna constructs indicated that the minimum cosmid size successfully packaged and delivered by p <dig> particles is about  <dig> kb. we ignore why shorter cosmids were not transferred by phage p <dig>  a minimum dna length is known to be required for efficient transduction in other phage systems  <cit> . too short dna molecules may preclude a correct assembly of the phage particle or may produce insufficient ejection forces to deliver the dna  <cit> .

knotting probability of cosmids extracted from p <dig> viral particles
to determine the knotting probability of packaged cosmids, dna extracted from the phage particles was examined by gel electrophoresis. when p <dig> phages were amplified in bacteria harbouring no cosmid, only p <dig> dna was recovered. because the knot distribution of p <dig> dna is broad and complex  <cit> , it produces a long smear of dna in the gel . incubation with topoisomerase ii converted these knotted forms into the unknotted nicked dna circle, easily identified as a single gel band . when p <dig> phages were amplified in bacteria harbouring p4cos- <dig>  extracted dna produced also a smear of knotted forms . following topoisomerase ii treatment, however, knotted molecules were converted into two gel bands of unknotted nicked dna circles . one band was p <dig> vir <dig> del <dig> dna  and the other band was the p4cos- <dig> cosmid , thus indicating that originally  both types of dna were knotted circles. gel band quantifications indicated that nearly 20% of the viral particles had packaged p4cos- <dig> and that its knotting probability was >95%. note that little unknotted cosmid is discernible before dna unknotting by topoisomerase ii.

similar experiments were done for cosmids p4cos- <dig> and p4cos- <dig> . when p <dig> phages were amplified in bacteria harbouring p4cos- <dig>  over 60% of resulting viral particles packaged the cosmid, which had knotting probability >95%. when p <dig> phages were amplified in bacteria harbouring p4cos- <dig>  the cosmid was not recovered in the viral particles. therefore, as predicted by the transduction assays, p4cos- <dig> fails to be packaged into p <dig> particles. larger cosmids, however, are efficiently packaged in vivo like p <dig> dna and mostly recovered as knotted circles. yet, notice that the fraction of cosmid dna recovered in phage particles does not agree with the fraction of p <dig> particles able to transduce ampicillin resistance. this discrepancy likely reflects that only phage particles containing no circularized dna, that is unknotted molecules, are able to deliver the cosmid into new host bacteria. accordingly, we had also observed that a bacterial infection with native phage p <dig>  produces a fraction of infective particles larger than an infection with p <dig> vir <dig> del <dig>   <cit> . possibly, only linear dna molecules with one of its cohesive ends interacting with the tail knob of the phage can be injected into bacteria  <cit> .

knot distribution of p <dig> cosmids
knotted dna extracted from viral particles containing p4cos- <dig> was analysed by two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis . the first dimension separated knotted circles with the same size according to their minimal crossing number  <cit> . the second gel dimension was at high voltage and segregated knotted circles from linear dna molecules  <cit> . as expected, ethidium staining of the gel  revealed two distributions of knotted molecules: one corresponded to p <dig> vir <dig> del <dig> dna; and the other corresponded to p4cos- <dig>  as confirmed by probing the gel-blot with cosmid dna sequences . as illustrated in figure 3c, in both distributions, knot populations of low crossing number were discernible as individual gel bands  migrating slightly faster than the corresponding unknotted circles . more complex knots had higher gel velocity and form a dense tail of dna . note also that dimeric forms of the cosmid were negligible in the probed gel blot. since a dimer of p4cos- <dig>  would ran almost overlapping p <dig> vir <dig> del <dig> , faint signals observed in this region may even result from unspecific hybridization with p <dig> dna . therefore, although each phage particle could hold two lengths of p4cos- <dig>  apparently only one cosmid length was usually packaged and circularized inside each viral capsid. yet, it cannot be formally excluded that that two cosmid molecules were packaged and circularized as monomers. this possibility would imply a mechanism that precludes inter-molecular annealing of their cohesive ends inside the capsid.

next, to obtain knotted cosmids free from contaminating p <dig> dna, we took advantage of the equilibrium density centrifugation of the viral particles in cesium chloride. particles containing cosmid were less dense than those containing p <dig> dna and, therefore, they equilibrated in a separated density band. phages containing the cosmid were so purified by centrifugation. gel electrophoresis conditions were then adjusted to display the cosmid knots with higher resolution . individual gel bands corresponding to the linear form , the unknotted circle , and to individual knot populations from  <dig> to  <dig> crossings were now discernible. more complex knots remained embedded in a dense tail  of higher gel velocity, which could not be further resolved with longer runs or with other electrophoresis buffers. this difficulty in separating the higher complexity forms reflected a large heterogeneity of knots types. in low voltage conditions the migration of different knots is not anymore the function of their minimal crossing number but a function of the overall compaction imposed by different knot types, which in turn is proportional to the average crossing number of ideal geometric representation of a given knot type  <cit> . regarding the minimal crossing number of analysed knots we estimate that more abundant knots have the minimal crossing number of about  <dig> while the fastest migrating forms have the minimal crossing number of about  <dig> . remarkably, the mean number of topological crossings per unit length of the cosmid knots  was comparable to that reported for p <dig> dna knots   <cit> . moreover, several landmarks of the cosmid knot distribution were analogous to those observed in p <dig> dna  <cit> . first, there was a scarcity of the achiral knot of  <dig> crossings  relative to knots of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> crossings. second, there was a single band for the two possible knot types of  <dig> crossings . longer gel runs identified this band as  <dig>  which has lower average crossing number than  <dig>  as proposed for the p <dig> genome  <cit> , these traits suggest that cosmid dna is highly writhed inside the phage capsid, so the formation of specific knot types is favoured  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
bacteria lysogenic for helper prophage p <dig> can be transformed with plasmids  containing the cos sites of the p <dig> phage . subsequent infection with satellite p <dig> phage results in bacterial lysis with the release of a substantial fraction of viral particles containing a p <dig> cosmid. such cosmids are then recovered in the form of highly knotted dna circles . the distribution of knot types is very similar to that previously reported for p <dig> dna. therefore, the packaging and knotting processes of dna inside p <dig> phage capsids are not exclusive properties of the viral genome. these findings may facilitate future studies on the structural properties of the p <dig> phage system and on the folding of dna under the effects of confinement. yet, a more immediate application of our results is the opportunity to generate complex knot distributions in dna molecules of length and sequence different than the p <dig> genome. usually,  <dig> μg of knotted cosmid are obtained from  <dig> liter of bacterial culture. such dna molecules are suitable for systematic studies on topoisomerase activities, biophysical properties of constrained dna, and the effect of dna knotting on biological transactions.
