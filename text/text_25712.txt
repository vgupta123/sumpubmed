BACKGROUND
infection with entamoeba histolytica, results in  <dig> million to  <dig> million symptomatic cases of amoebiasis worldwide each year, causing  <dig> to  <dig> thousand deaths annually  <cit> . mortality from amoebiasis is mainly due to extra-intestinal pathology, of which amoebic liver abscess  is the most common. if left untreated, ala can rupture into neighboring tissue and spread to the brain and other organs via hematological route producing serious morbidity and mortality. it is difficult to differentiate clinically the ala from pyogenic liver abscess  as well as from other space occupying lesions of liver such as hydatid cyst and liver hepatoma  <cit> .

imaging techniques like ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance although are highly sensitive to detect abscesses in the liver of varied aetiology, however fail to distinguish specifically ala from that of pla. less than one third of patients with ala have active diarrhea  <cit> . hence, stool microscopy and stool antigen detection is not very helpful for diagnosis of ala. in fact less than only 10% of ala patients have identifiable e. histolytica in stool specimens  <cit> .

laboratory diagnosis of ala is usually established by conventional antibody-based serological tests. nevertheless, the main disadvantage with antibody detection is that serum antibody levels in individuals living in endemic areas, continues to remain positive even for years after infection with e. histolytica  <cit> . the demonstration of amoebic antibodies in the serum, therefore, fails to denote the amoebic infection whether it is recent or old. furthermore, serum amoebic antibodies are not demonstrated in up to 10% of the patients with acute ala  <cit> .

the demonstration of e. histolytica trophozoite in liver abscess pus aspirates by microscopy confirms the diagnosis of ala, but in best of the laboratories, the amoebic trophozoites can be demonstrated in only 15% of the liver pus  <cit> . since the trophozoites of e. histolytica are found mainly in the periphery of the abscess diagnosis of ala by culture of liver pus for e. histolytica is also unsatisfactory  <cit> .

demonstration of amoebic antigen in the liver pus is a recent approach for specific diagnosis of the ala. a monoclonal antibody-based second generation techlab enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  kit  has been reported to be 78% sensitive for the detection of e. histolytica lectin antigen in the liver pus for the diagnosis of ala in dhaka, bangladesh  <cit> . studies conducted in various laboratories worldwide including ours have shown that polymerase chain reaction  is a sensitive and specific method for detecting entamoeba dna in stool samples and for differentiating the morphologically similar e. histolytica from entamoeba dispar and entamoeba moshkovskii  <cit> . however, only few studies using the pcr have been reported for the detection of entamoeba dna in liver abscess pus for the diagnosis of the ala  <cit> .

collection of blood or liver abscess pus is an invasive procedure, and the procedures require technical expertise and disposable syringes  <cit> . the method if not carried out under stringent conditions is associated with the risk of acquiring needle-borne infections such as hepatitis b virus and human immunodeficiency virus . therefore, of late much interest has been shown towards the use of urine as a specimen alternate to the blood for the diagnosis of some parasitic infections including malaria, schistisomiasis, kala-azar, cystic echinococcosis and neurocysticercosis  <cit> . urinary antigen for cystic echinococcosis  and neurocysticercosis has been reported for the first time from our laboratory at jawaharlal institute of postgraduate medical education and research , puducherry, india  <cit> . our laboratory has developed for the first time a counter-current immunoelectrophoresis  and co-agglutination  to detect the hydatid antigen excreted in the urine for the diagnosis of ce  <cit> , and co-a to detect cysticercus antigen in the urine for the diagnosis of neurocysticercosis  <cit> .

detection of dna in urine by pcr has been employed for the diagnosis of toxoplasma gondii, neisseria gonorrhoeae, borrelia burgdorferi, mycobacterium tuberculosis, mycobacterium leprae and chlamydia trachomatis infections  <cit> . some studies have also shown that the kidney barrier in rodents and humans is permeable to dna molecules large enough to be analyzed by standard genetic methodologies  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge till now there is no report available on detection of entamoeba dna in the urine for the diagnosis of ala. in the present study, therefore for the first time, we have evaluated a nested multiplex pcr for detection of entamoeba dna excreted in the urine for the diagnsosis of ala.

RESULTS
the quantification of dna in the liver abscess pus and urine specimen by spectrophotometric analysis showed the dna yield to be approximately  <dig> and  <dig> μg/ml respectively. the purity of dna extract from liver abscess pus and urine specimens was found to be satisfactory as the value of ratio of readings at  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm  was approximately  <dig> – <dig> .

the sequencing result of pcr product of e. histolytica from liver abscess pus and urine specimen showed 99% identities to the sequence deposited in genbank, . the result of assessment of competition of other non target dna present in liver abscess pus  and urine  specimen with target dna, showed expected amplification and no nonspecific amplification in nested multiplex pcr.

estimation of minimum number of entamoeba cells detectable by nested multiplex pcr showed that the detection limit of pcr was found to be approximately  <dig> e. histolytica cells as even  <dig>  μl of template dna from  <dig> e. histolytica cells/ <dig> μl of tris- ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid   buffer produced a positive signal.

the iha test was positive for serum antibodies in the serum of  <dig>  of  <dig> patients provisionally diagnosed as ala. the test was positive in a higher number of serum  samples of patients who had received prior treatment with metronidazole than those who had not received any prior treatment with metronidazole  and this difference was statistically significant . metronidazole treatment was initiated from a few days to several weeks before collection of the blood samples in these patients. two  out of  <dig> sera from control cases were positive for antiamoebic antibody by iha.

the techlab e. histolytica ii test was positive for e. histolytica gal/galnac lectin antigen in the liver abscess pus of  <dig>  of  <dig> provisionally diagnosed ala patients. the techlab e. histolytica ii test detected lectin antigen in  <dig>  of  <dig> liver abscess pus of patients which were collected prior to treatment with metronidazole. in contrast, the techlab e. histolytica test detected the lectin antigen in only  <dig>  of  <dig> liver pus , collected after initiation of therapy with metronidazole. the probability of e. histolytica antigen detection in liver abscess pus by elisa was found to be  <dig> times more in patients who had not received prior treatment with metronidazole  =  <dig> , 95% confidence interval  =  <dig>  to  <dig> ) than in the patients who received prior metronidazole therapy. the or was statistically significant as the 95% ci of or was more than  <dig> 

microscopy of the liver pus demonstrated e. histolytica trophozoites in  <dig> of  <dig>  liver abscess specimens, but only  <dig>  pus specimens were positive by culture for e. histolytica. all  <dig> patients whose liver pus were positive for e. histolytica by microscopy and/or culture were also positive for e. histolytica gal/galnac lectin antigen in the liver pus by the techlab e. histolytica ii test and serum amoebic antibodies by the iha test.

a total of  <dig> out of  <dig>  liver abscess pus were negative for aerobic bacteria by gram's staining and bacterial culture. twenty seven liver abscess pus specimens were positive for aerobic bacteria by gram's staining and bacterial culture. these included klebsiella pneumoniae , proteus species , enterobacter , escherichia coli  and pseudomonas . ten liver abscess pus specimens showed secondary infection of ala with aerobic bacteria by gram's staining and bacterial culture. these included k. pneumoniae , enterobacter , e. coli , group b salmonella species , enterococcus  and coagulase negative staphylococci . such secondary infection of ala with bacteria has been reported previously in the literature  <cit> .

in the present study, a total of  <dig> out of  <dig>  provisionally diagnosed ala patients were diagnosed as ala and remaining  <dig> patients were diagnosed as pla, by following the criteria mentioned in this study elsewhere.

the result of nested multiplex pcr performed on the liver abscess pus is depicted in figure  <dig>  the nested multiplex pcr test was positive for e. histolytica dna in  <dig>  of  <dig> liver abscess pus specimens . the nested multiplex pcr could detect e. histolytica dna in the liver abscess pus of all  <dig> ala patients , who were tested prior to treatment with metronidazole. in contrast, prior metronidazole treatment significantly decreased the ability of the pcr to detect e. histolytica dna in the liver abscess pus, with only  <dig>  of  <dig> liver pus samples positive . the probability of e. histolytica dna detection in liver abscess pus by nested multiplex pcr was  <dig> times more in patients who had not received prior metronidazole therapy  than in the patients who received prior metronidazole therapy. the or was statistically significant as the 95% ci of or was greater than  <dig> 

the nested multiplex pcr did not detect e. histolytica dna in a total of  <dig> liver abscess pus specimens, which included  <dig> pla and  <dig> ala pus specimens. the probability of negative nested multiplex pcr results, in these  <dig> liver abscess pus specimens due to pcr inhibitors was ruled out by the inclusion of an internal amplification control  in the nested pcr reaction.

the comparison of results of nested multiplex pcr and techlab e. histolytica ii elisa test on liver abscess pus from ala patients is summarised in the table  <dig> 

the nested multiplex pcr result on urine specimen is shown in figure  <dig>  the nested multiplex pcr was performed on urine specimen collected from  <dig> patients  and  <dig> controls. the nested multiplex pcr test detected e. histolytica dna in  <dig>  of  <dig> urine samples collected from patients with ala . the test did not detect e. histolytica dna in urine samples collected from all  <dig> pla patients and  <dig> controls.

the nested multiplex pcr test detected e. histolytica dna in the urine specimens of  <dig>  of  <dig> ala patients who were tested prior to treatment with metronidazole and in  <dig>  of  <dig> ala patients who were tested after treatment with metronidazole . all of the  <dig> ala patients, who did not receive prior treatment with metronidazole and whose urine specimens were positive for e. histolytica dna, were available for follow-up study. urine specimens were collected from these patients every week for  <dig> weeks after starting of the therapy with metronidazole; and were tested for e. histolytica dna by pcr. it was observed that  <dig> weeks after treatment with metronidazole,  <dig>  out of  <dig> urine specimens became negative for e. histolytica dna. one urine specimen became negative for e. histolytica dna after  <dig> weeks of treatment with metronidazole.

discussion
in this study, we have made an attempt to detect excretory e. histolytica dna in urine by applying nested multiplex pcr and to assess the diagnostic potential of the test for detection of e. histolytica dna in urine for the diagnosis of ala. also we have studied the kinetics of the excretion of e. histolytica dna in urine during the course of therapy with metronidazole.

in our study,  <dig> %  of ala patients were positive for antiamoebic antibody in serum by the iha. this result was similar to that reported from bangladesh where serum antiamoebic antibodies were found in 78% of ala patients  <cit> , but differed from that of the study reported from south africa, where serum antiamoebic antibodies were found in a higher 99% of ala patients  <cit> .

only two out of  <dig> ala pus samples which were positive for e. histolytica trophozoite by microscopy were positive for the amoebae by culture and the rest were negative, this may be due to the inhibition of growth by culture itself. in majority of patients, k. pneumoniae was the major bacterial pathogen responsible for pla and as secondary bacterial infection of ala. one of  <dig> ala pus specimens was positive for group b salmonella species, this patient had liver abscess with perihepatic collection, with severe sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation, finally the patient died. in this study, the anaerobic culture of liver abscess pus aspirate was not done. therefore, the possible etiology of liver abscess due to anaerobic organisms such as bacteroides remained undetermined.

in the present study, 50%  of liver abscess pus were positive for e. histolytica lectin antigen. the sensitivity of the test in our study was observed to be slightly higher than that of the study using the same techlab e. histolytica ii kit  on liver pus reported from bangladesh  <cit> . however, results of other studies using polyclonal antibody based elisa showed a very high sensitivity for the detection of amoebic antigen in the liver pus. amoebic antigen was detected in liver abscess pus in  <dig> %  of ala cases by elisa as reported from china  <cit>  and in 92% and 96% of liver pus by using immunoelectrophoresis and elisa respectively, from india  <cit> .

in developing countries like india where amoebiasis is endemic, antiamoebic drugs and antibiotics are used indiscriminately, making it difficult to obtain an accurate treatment history. most of the patients in the present study had already been treated with metronidazole at the time of collection of clinical specimens. the serum amoebic antibodies were detected in higher percentage  of ala patients treated earlier with metronidazole, but were detected in only  <dig> % of patients who did not receive any prior treatment with metronidazole. this might be due to the late antibody response during the course of the disease.

unlike serum amoebic antibody detection, e. histolytica lectin antigen was detected in liver pus by techlab elisa in a higher percentage  of ala patients, who were tested prior to treatment with metronidazole, but was detected in only  <dig> % of ala patients, who were tested after the initiation of therapy with metronidazole. this might be due to the rapid clearing of amoebic antigen from the liver pus due to killing of e. histolytica trophozoites on treatment with metronidazole.

the pcr for the detection of e. histolytica dna in liver abscess pus had a much higher sensitivity  when tested prior to treatment with metronidazole, but had a lower sensitivity  when tested after the initiation of treatment with metronidazole. this might be attributed to the clearing of e. histolytica dna from the liver abscess due to the death and lysis of e. histolytica trophozoites on treatment with metronidazole. the percentage of agreement between e. histolytica dna detection and elisa for e. histolytica antigen detection in liver abscess pus was found to be  <dig> % in the present study . the kappa statistic was found to be  <dig>  which indicates a fair agreement between the two tests.

pcr for detection of e. histolytica dna and elisa for detection of e. histolytica lectin antigen in liver abscess pus were evaluated for the diagnosis of ala . the sensitivity of pcr was  <dig> %. this was found to be significantly higher than that of elisa  using mcnemar's χ <dig> test . all  <dig> liver abscess pus aspirates diagnosed as pla were negative for e. histolytica dna by pcr and for e. histolytica lectin antigen by techlab elisa, which represents a specificity of 100%. elisa for detection of liver abscess pus e. histolytica lectin antigen demonstrated a 100% positive predictive value and a  <dig> % negative predictive value. pcr for the detection of liver abscess pus e. histolytica dna demonstrated a 100% positive predictive value and a  <dig> % negative predictive value.

in the present study e. histolytica dna was detected in the urine specimen of  <dig>  of  <dig> ala patients, who were tested prior to treatment with metronidazole and in  <dig>  of  <dig> ala patients, who were tested after treatment with metronidazole by pcr. the probability of e. histolytica dna detection in urine by pcr was  <dig> times more in ala patients who had received prior metronidazole therapy  than in the ala patients who did not receive prior metronidazole therapy. the or was statistically significant as the 95% ci of or was greater than  <dig>  this might be due to release of increased e. histolytica dna from the dying e. histolytica trophozoites when metronidazole therapy was initiated, leading to excretion of e. histolytica dna in the urine. one study has demonstrated that the dna from dying cells can cross the kidney barrier in rodents and humans and can get excreted with urine, which can be used for genetic analysis  <cit> .

pcr for detection of e. histolytica dna in liver abscess pus and urine specimen were evaluated for the diagnosis of ala . the sensitivity of pcr for urine was  <dig> %. this was found to be significantly lower than that of pcr for liver abscess pus  using mcnemar's χ <dig> test . all urine specimens from  <dig> pla patients and  <dig> control group individuals were negative for e. histolytica dna by pcr. this represents a specificity of 100% . pcr for the detection of urinary e. histolytica dna demonstrated a 100% positive predictive value and a  <dig> % negative predictive value.

as per the pcr kinetics the likelihood of amplifying smaller pcr product is more than amplifying larger pcr product. we feel that if the pcr product smaller than  <dig> bp would have been amplified, the pcr might show higher sensitivity.

e. histolytica dna in urine did not persist longer in ala patients after treatment with metronidazole as observed in the present study. three of  <dig>  urine specimens positive for e. histolytica dna became negative for e. histolytica dna within  <dig> weeks of treatment with metronidazole. this might be attributed to the reduced excretion of e. histolytica dna in the urine as a result of reduction of e. histolytica infection load following treatment with metronidazole. the effect of metronidazole in killing of e. histolytica and clearing of antigenemia in hamsters suffering from hepatic amoebiasis has been well documented in a study reported by thammapalerd et al.  <cit>  results of the present study therefore indicate that the pcr can be used to monitor excretion of e. histolytica dna in urine as a prognostic marker during therapy of ala with specific antiamoebic drugs.

in the present study, none of the liver abscess pus and urine pcr results were positive for either e. dispar or e. moshkovskii specific pcr products, which confirm the non invasive nature of these species .

the detection of e. histolytica dna and e. histolytica specific lectin antigen in the serum specimen of ala patients was not carried out in this study. a controlled prospective study to evaluate the detection of e. histolytica dna and e. histolytica specific lectin antigen in the serum specimen of ala patients has been intended to be carried out in future in our laboratory.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study for the first time shows that the kidney barrier in ala patients is permeable to e. histolytica dna molecule resulting in excretion of e. histolytica dna in urine which can be detected by pcr. the study also shows that the pcr for detection of e. histolytica dna in urine of patients with ala can also be used as a prognostic marker to assess the course of the diseases following therapy by metronidazole. the detection of e. histolytica dna in urine specimen of ala patients provides a new approach for the diagnosis of ala.
