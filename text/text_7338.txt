BACKGROUND
puccinia striiformis westend. f. sp. tritici eriks., the causal fungus of stripe rust on wheat , is a biotrophic obligate parasite. the pathogen is able to cause 100% yield loss  <cit>  with frequent yield losses from  <dig> to 70% depending on cultivars grown and favorable weather conditions  <cit> . leaf rust  and stem rust  also cause similar damage to wheat production. in addition to their economic importance, rust fungi are particularly interesting because of their complex life cycle and the specialized infection structures. a great number of cytological studies have revealed details about spore attachment, germination, appressorium formation over host stomata and host invasion as reviewed by hahn  <cit> . however, little is known about the mechanisms of biotrophic nutrient uptake  <cit> . the genetics, histology and pathology of host-rust pathogen interactions have been intensively explored over the last few decades  <cit> . the infection process of cereal rust fungi has been closely examined in several species, the molecular mechanisms of compatible and incompatible interactions between the host and pathogen, especially for the wheat-p. striiformis system, however, are poorly understood  <cit> .

for successful parasitism of a fungal pathogen in plant living tissues, it is apparent that the pathogen has evolved strategies for manipulating host cellular metabolism, morphology and development  <cit> . successful infection of a host plant by a pathogen requires the induction of a subset of pathogen genes that are essential for pathogenicity  <cit> . less clear is the role and expression of specific host genes that may be required for successful pathogen infection of the plant. this is especially true for biotrophic rust fungi because they obtain nutrients and water completely from living plant tissues. identification of both host and pathogen genes induced during a pathogen infection may provide insight into the compatible host-pathogen interaction at the molecular level.

although a gene does not have to be up- or down-regulated to play a key role in a biological process, screening for differentially expressed genes is one of the most straightforward approaches to reveal the molecular basis of a biological system. as a differential screening method, cdna-amplified fragment length polymorphism  is more stringent and reproducible than many other methods because it can amplify low-abundance transcripts  <cit> . the cdna-aflp technique is a robust, high-throughput, genome-wide expression tool for gene discovery  <cit> , where prior knowledge of sequences is not required  <cit> . this technique has been further improved to avoid the possibility of several transcript derived fragments  arising from a single gene/cdna  <cit> . the technique should be especially useful for studying genes of the stripe rust pathogen because the fungus does not have known sexual reproduction and is difficult to culture on an artificial medium, which have limited the use of the traditional genetic and molecular techniques.

the objectives of this study were to apply the cdna-aflp technique to the wheat-stripe rust pathogen interaction pathosystem, identify genes regulated during the compatible interaction between the host and pathogen, and validate the expression patterns for some of the regulated genes through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction .

RESULTS
isolation of differentially expressed genes during interaction between wheat and the stripe rust fungus
the sampling time points ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> hpi corresponded to the different stages of stripe rust fungi infection processes, including spore germination , formation of substomal vesicle , infection hyphae , and haustorial mother cells and haustoria , proliferation of intercellular hyphae and numerous haustoria in host tissues , and generation of sporogenous cells at about  <dig> hpi, as described by wang et al.  <cit> . high throughput coverage of leaf samples across time points during whole infection processes of stripe rust fungus yielded a large number of polymorphic bands using cdna-aflp analyses. the number of tdfs ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> per primer pair and their lengths were from  <dig> to  <dig> bp, depending upon primer combinations and time points. figure  <dig> shows an example of the expression patterns. a total of  <dig>  fragments were amplified with  <dig> primer combinations. the cdna-aflp fragments were highly reproducible as the band intensities were similar from the three biological replications for each time-point treatment. altered expression patterns after inoculation were detected for  <dig>  tdfs compared to the mock-inoculated plants near  <dig> hip, accounting for  <dig> % of displayed fragments. of the  <dig>  tdfs,  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig>  down-regulated exclusively, indicating that more genes were suppressed during the compatible interaction. a total of  <dig> tdfs were selected for attempted further analyses, of which  <dig> were recovered from gels, re-amplified, sub-cloned and  <dig> of them were sequenced.

gene sequence analysis
of the  <dig> tdfs sequenced,  <dig> produced reliable  sequences. each sequence was identified by similarity search using the basic local alignment search tool  program against the genbank non-redundant  public sequence database. sequences were classified into functional groups based on their homology with known proteins according to bevan's method  <cit> . sequence comparison of the  <dig> tdfs against the nr database revealed that the majority of them belonged to either no hit  or unknown proteins , and only 40% had putative functions. among those tdfs with known functions, the majority were involved in the energy, signal transduction, disease/defense and metabolism groups . all of these unigenes were submitted to genbank .

the results of blast searching database indicated that  <dig>  of the sequenced  <dig> tdfs were likely from p. striiformis, and  <dig>  were presumably from wheat, and the remaining  <dig>  were unclear about their origin because they had no hits in public genbank database. of the  <dig> tdfs,  <dig> had significant homology  at the amino acid level to p. graminis . the encoding products of these genes included glycine dehydrogenase, fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase, udp-glucuronic acid decarboxylase, atp synthase subunit alpha, nadh-quinone oxidoreductase, glycosyl transferase, vesicular-fusion protein sec <dig>  plasma membrane proteolipid, glycine dehydrogenase and conserved hypothetical proteins.

a these genes are confirmed to be of stripe rust fungus origin by sequencing.

identification of gene origins
to determine wheat or pathogen origin of the  <dig> tdfs with significant homology to genes in p. graminis, specific primers were designed for these genes to amplify genomic dna from urediniospores of the stripe rust pathogen or wheat leaves. as showed in figure  <dig>  seven  tdfs could be amplified from the genomic dna of wheat leaves, while not from the pathogen, indicating that they were wheat genes. other nine  tdfs were successfully amplified from genomic dna of the stripe rust pathogen, clearly showing that they were of p. striiformis origin. the remaining two  could be amplified from both wheat and stripe rust pathogen. sequencing analyses of the fragments amplified from both wheat and pathogen for pst_c <dig> and pst_c <dig> confirmed that the two tdfs were of wheat origin.

validation of expression patterns using qrt- pcr analyses
to investigate the reliability of cdna-aflp for detecting differentially expressed genes and verify the expression patterns observed in the cdna-aflp analyses, qrt-pcr analyses were carried out for  <dig> tdfs. these tdfs were selected based on their interesting cdna-aflp expression patterns in the time-course of the cdna-aflp experiment and homology to genes known to play a role in disease/defence, signal transduction or uncharacterized genes. the qrt-pcr analyses allowed us to monitor gene expression of both partners in the wheat-p. striiformis pathosystem at high levels of sensitivity and specificity. expression profiles of the  <dig> tdfs in wheat leaves after inoculation are shown in figure  <dig>  for each tdf, the same expression pattern was found with qrt-pcr analyses as observed in the cdna-aflp tests, except for only one tdf , presumably because of isolation of a wrong fragment.

as shown in figure  <dig>  tdfs involved in disease/defense , signal transduction , and no hits  were strongly up-regulated as early as  <dig> hpi. maximum induction of these genes occurred at  <dig> hpi and was followed by relatively constant expression. the transcripts of pst_260- <dig> and pst_143- <dig> increased by  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold, respectively. however, four genes  related to energy were down-regulated as early as  <dig> hpi. pst_c <dig> and pst_c <dig> had maximum expression occurred at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi respectively. pst_c <dig> transcript showed maximum expression at  <dig> hpi. the accumulation of transcripts of pst_267- <dig>  pst_c <dig>  and pst_c <dig> decreased after  <dig> hpi. both pst_c <dig> and pst_274- <dig> peaked as early as  <dig> hpi with maximum expression at  <dig> hpi. pst_c <dig> transcript encoding a fungal lipase was induced at  <dig> hpi. this gene peaked at  <dig> hpi and maintained high level of expression before  <dig> hpi, hereafter the expression decreased again and reached the same expression level as at  <dig> hpi by  <dig> hpi. generally, majority of the  <dig> tdfs were induced and peaked at  <dig> to  <dig> hpi. these results suggested that the selected tdfs with putative functions in disease/defence or signal transduction might be triggered rapidly and play an active role during the early compatible interaction between wheat and the stripe rust pathogen.

in order to largely eliminate possible variations caused by experimental conditions, inoculation, plant development, or other factors, parallel mock inoculation with sterile water were included for each of all time points as control. we compared expression levels of all selected genes in the mock inoculated leaf samples across all time points and found that the  <dig> wheat genes did not change their expression level significantly without infection of the rust . the results from the mock treatment at all time points support the conclusion that these genes changed their expression levels in response to the pathogen infection.

discussion
lack of sexual reproduction and transformation system for the stripe rust pathogen has limited the use of most genetic and molecular techniques in studying genes of the pathogen involved in the interactions with its host plants. interactions between the pathogen and its host plants have been studied almost restrictively by virulence analysis  <cit> . genes of the pathogen had not been reported until recently. in  <dig>  ling et al.  <cit>  constructed a full-length cdna library and reported the first group of  <dig> genes with putative functions for the stripe rust pathogen. similarly, zhang et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> genes with putative functions from a germinated urediniospore est library. these studies did not address expression changes of the rust genes. using the microarray technique, coram et al.  <cit>  identified genes involved in basal defense and different types of wheat resistance to stripe rust. however, the studies focused on plant genes using the wheat genechips and did not determine the pathogen genes involved in the compatible and incompatible interactions of the host and parasite. the present study was the first to determine expression of genes from both wheat and the stripe rust pathogen involved in a compatible interaction.

using the cdna-aflp technique, we were able to detect  <dig>  reproducible tdfs with  <dig> primer combinations. the number is within the same range as found in a previous study of the tomato-cladosporium fulvum pathosystem, in which  <dig>  tdfs were detected with all possible  <dig>  primer combinations  <cit> . the fewer primer combinations producing more tdfs in the present study could be due to the larger genome size of wheat and the stripe rust fungus than those of tomato and c. fulvum. nevertheless, the present study demonstrated that cdna-aflp is a powerful technique to study genes involved in the wheat-p. striiformis system. because aflp primers are universal, the cdna-aflp technique is applicable to any organisms or any host-pathogen systems for comprehensive transcript profiling  <cit> . in fact, the technique has been successfully employed to identify expressed genes in various plant-pathogen systems  <cit> . in comparison with microarray, cdna-aflp has low cost and does not require sequence information and expensive or sophisticated equipment. as showed in this study, cdna-aflp banding patterns are highly reproducible when compared with other techniques like differential display  <cit> .

the time points used in the present study were selected based on our detailed microscopic study of the infection process . interestingly, 48% and 35% of the differentially expressed genes showed different degrees of change between 6– <dig> and 120– <dig> hpi, respectively. in contrast, only 17% of genes were differentially expressed at 48– <dig> hpi. the expression changes of these genes corresponded quite well to the different infection stages of the pathogen. compared with the early stages of infection, the proportion of cdna derived from the fungus increased slightly and that from the plant decreased at the late stages, as the fungal biomass increased. these results were similar to the expression patterns in compatible interaction between wheat and p. triticina  <cit>  and were also supported by our histological study of compatible interaction between wheat and p. striiformis . functions could not be determined for many of the tdfs due to the fact that fungal genes were more limited in the database than plant genes. therefore, the genes of no hit are more likely from the stripe rust fungus.

in the present study, we identified  <dig> genes which were up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated in a compatible interaction. the up-regulated genes were remarkably similar to that of a recent study by coram et al.  <cit> . they reported that  <dig> genes were up-regulated in a compatible interaction between wheat  and a us wheat stripe rust pathotype , which belonged to the major categories of functions as described in the present study. the expression of these genes also peaked at  <dig> hpi. in contrast, coram et al.  <cit>  only identified two genes down-regulated for the compatible interaction. such difference might be due to the fact that the affymetrix genechip does not include all possible wheat genes. the cdna-aflp technique does not have such limitation. different wheat genotypes and stripe rust pathotypes also might contribute to the difference.

ideally, the mock treatment should be used for all time-points in the cdna-aflp experiments. however, the increase of cost and time for such experiments could be substantial as we used a large number of time points to represent all key time points of stripe rust infection. to reduce the experimental cost, only the 0-hpi treatment was included in the cdna-aflp study. thus, not all transcript changes of the  <dig> genes can be attributed to regulations by stripe rust infection. other factors such as plant growth could affect expression of some of the genes. however, we obtained a  <dig> % confirmation rate by testing  <dig> genes in experiments including the mock treatment for every time point using the qrt-pcr technique. with such a high percentage of genes showing consistent expression patterns in both cdna-aflp and qrt-pcr experiments, it is conceivable to conclude that the most of the genes identified using cdna-aflp are involved in the compatible interaction between the host and pathogen, although further studies are needed to determine their roles in the interaction.

in a plant-pathogen pathosystem, differentially expressed genes from either the plant or pathogen may interplay in the interaction. in this study, we determined the origins of  <dig> genes that had high homologies to genes of the stem rust pathogen. interestingly, 50% of the tested genes were from the stripe rust pathogen and another 50% from the wheat host. the origin for two of the genes amplified in both wheat and the pathogen were determined from wheat by sequencing the pcr fragments. similarly, some genes identified from the plant based on the blast results might be from the pathogen. this suggests that blast analysis should be used only as an indication of potential origins, but definite determination of gene origins from infected leaves should be from pcr amplifications of genomic dnas from the pathogen and host separately, and sequencing comparisons become necessary if a gene is amplified from both organisms. thus, further studies are needed to determine origins of most other genes identified in this study.

because systems for transformation and expression of stripe rust genes have not been developed and the number of putative wheat genes was large, we used bioinformatical approach to determine putative functions of genes with altered expression patterns. of  <dig> sequenced tdfs,  <dig> had relatively clear functions in various categories. these genes can help us in understanding molecular changes in the compatible interaction.

clone pst_c <dig> was predicted to encode wheat atpase. its expression was generally down-regulated upon infection. atpase was suggested to control stomatal apertures in guard cells  <cit> . the reduced transcript level of this gene in wheat leaves might indicate an attempt of the host to limit water loss by reducing stomatal openings. clone pst_c <dig> was identified as a putative expansin and its transcripts accumulated rapidly during the rust infection. expansin is a family of closely-related non-enzymatic proteins found in the plant cell wall with important roles in plant growth and response of plants to an adverse environment  <cit> . several genes including ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase , phosphoribulokinase  and carbonic anhydrase  encoding enzymes in the calvin cycle were down-regulated during the rust infection. chlorophyll a-b binding proteins  associated with photosynthesis-related functions were strongly down-regulated during the early stage of the infection. transcriptional down-regulation of photosynthesis-related genes has been reported for compatible interactions between soybean and phytophthora sojae  <cit>  and grapevine and powdery mildew  <cit> . plants infected by biotrophic fungal pathogens, such as rusts and powdery mildews, reduce their photosynthetic rates, possibly as a result of increased invertase activity that causes carbohydrate accumulation  <cit> .

a significant outcome of this study was the identification of ten tdfs with signal transduction functions, including serine/threonine kinase , receptor kinase , phosphatase  and g-protein coupled receptor . the majority of these genes were up-regulated, indicating that they are essential in plant defense as previously reported  <cit> . several genes encoding enzymes were up-regulated in infected leaves, including -beta glucanase , peroxidase  and quinone reductase . this observation was similar to cases for salt-stress induced hydrophobic peptide , protease inhibitor  and subtilisin-chymotrypsin inhibitor   <cit> . these genes have been assigned a function related to resistance in many pathosystems. this indicates the presence of a general, although weak, defense response in susceptible plants  <cit> . however, this was not the case for a disease resistance gene , encoding nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat  protein. the expression of this gene was down-regulated in the compatible interaction between wheat and the stripe rust fungus, which was in agreement with recently developed models  <cit> .

compared to tdfs of wheat origin as discussed above, relatively few genes were identified from the stripe rust pathogen, which could be due to higher abundance of wheat mrna than fungal mrna in the infected leaves. we clearly identified nine genes from p. striiformis f. sp. tritici. because expressions of these genes were altered during the infection, they should be essential for the fungus to establish a compatible interaction with wheat plants. for example, atpase was reported to reduce transpiration rates and stomatal apertures in rust fungus infections before uredia were fully developed  <cit> . the pathogen gene, tdf pst_c <dig>  has homology to a lipase in aspergillus fumigatus. although little is known about the influence of lipases during infection of plants by fungi, intracellular lipases have been shown to be involved in appressorium formation of magnaporthe grisea  <cit> . the first evidence of involvement of secreted lipases in plant infection came from comménil et al.  <cit> . eddine et al.  <cit>  reported a secreted lipase in the pea pathogen nectria haematococca. voigt et al.  <cit>  found that transformation-mediated disruption of fgl <dig> encoding a secreted fusarium graminearum lipase led to reduced extracellular lipolytic activity in culture and reduced virulence to both wheat and maize. because the lipase-like pst_c <dig> gene is from the stripe rust pathogen, its elevated expression during the infection process observed in this study suggests that the gene is important for the pathogen infection. more studies are needed to test the hypothesis and to determine the functions of the rust genes in the pathogen growth and interaction with wheat plants.

the present study was focused on a compatible interaction between the wheat and p. striiformis pathosystem to identify genes essential for establishing disease. a parallel study was undertaken to focus on incompatible interaction using the same wheat genotype and a pathotype of the pathogen avirulent to yrsu to identify genes essential for resistance and avirulence. as transformation and gene expression systems are currently under development in several laboratories, genes detected in the present study will be used in functional analysis for identifying genes involved in hypersensitive response, as done by gabriël et al.  <cit>  with the tomato-c. fulvum pathosystem.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we successfully used the efficient cdna-aflp technique to determine gene expression patterns in a compatible interaction between wheat and the stripe rust pathogen. more than  <dig>  tdfs with altered patterns of gene expressions during the plant-pathogen interaction were identified. a general correlation of gene expression with different stages of the infection process was observed. sequence analysis of  <dig> tdfs identified genes involved in various molecular events during the compatible interaction. these genes and their putative functions provide insight in understanding the wheat-stripe rust compatible interaction, and provide candidate genes for future function analysis. this study identified the first group of the stripe rust pathogen genes involved in the infection process. further research is needed to study the incompatible interaction and compare compatible and incompatible interactions to identify unique and common genes in the different interactions of the wheat-stripe rust pathosystem.
