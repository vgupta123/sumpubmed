BACKGROUND
we have previously characterized the human aβh-j-j locus, a genomic sequence which generates functionally distinct proteins  <cit> , including the enzyme aspartyl  β-hydroxylase , junctin, a structural protein of sarcoplasmic reticulum, humbug and junctate, the truncated homologs of aah calcium binding proteins  <cit> . aah catalyzes posttranslational hydroxylation of aspartate and asparagine residues in certain epidermal growth factor-like domains present in a number of proteins, such as receptors and receptor ligands, involved in cell growth and differentiation, and extracellular matrix molecules  <cit> . aah, mediates cell motility and invasiveness, an effect which is of interest because of its role in placental implantation and "receptivity" of endometrium  <cit> . humbug is a truncated homolog of aah that lacks a catalytic domain. overexpression of humbug increases intracellular calcium levels by promoting its release from intracellular stores  <cit> . the levels of humbug immunoreactivity are directly associated with colon cancer tumor grade and inversely associated with patient survival  <cit> . aah and/or humbug are over expressed in infiltrative intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, metastasized lung, breast, colon, hepatocellular carcinomas, and malignant neuroectodermal tumors  <cit> . these proteins can contribute to the malignant phenotype by increasing motility and enhancing proliferation, survival, and cell cycle progression. inhibition of aah and humbug expression could represent an attractive approach for gene therapy of infiltrating tumors  <cit> .

junctate is an integral calcium binding protein of sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane, which forms a supramolecular complex with the inositol  <dig> , <dig> trisphosphate receptor and modulates calcium entry through receptor- and store-activated channels  <cit> .

our group previously reported the identification of two promoter sequences, present within the human aβh-j-j locus , that are expected to regulate the transcription of this locus  <cit> . the generated primary transcripts undergo alternative splicing and direct the synthesis of aah, humbug, junctin, and junctate. we have previously reported the characterization of the p <dig> promoter, demonstrating that the myocyte enhancer factor  <dig>  transcription factor binds to this promoter sequence and drives tissue-specific expression, being responsible of inducing transcription during muscle differentiation  <cit> .

in additon, we have recently reported the role of sp factors in upregulating the p1-directed transcription of the aβh-j-j locus  <cit> . this was the first study about the role of the p <dig> promoter.

in the present study we focused our attention on the role of another putative regulating sequence, namely an e-box, which is located in the region of the p <dig> promoter and is required for high-level of transcription.

to characterize the expression directed by the p <dig> promoter, we have analysed the corresponding mrnas in different cell lines. furthermore, transfections of hela cells with progressively deleted reporter constructs of the -661/+ <dig> p <dig> promoter region were performed and the transcription activity of each fragment was characterized. dna/transcription factor interaction studies were performed in vitro by emsa or supershift assays, and in intact cells by chromatin immunoprecipitations. functional assays were performed by in vitro mutagenesis of the e-box binding site and by rna interference targeting usf <dig>  <cit> .

RESULTS
structure of the 5' end of the aβh-j-j locus
identification of functional region within the aβh-j-j p <dig> promoter
in order to identify putative regulatory regions located within aβh-j-j p <dig> promoter, hela cells were transiently transfected with sequentially deleted reporter constructs, containing different regions of the -661/+ <dig> p <dig> nucleotide sequence cloned into pgl3-basic reporter vector  <cit> .

the data of transient transfection and luciferase assays were normalized to renilla luciferase activity. an additional comparison was done with the pgl3-basic reporter vector. the results represented in fig  <dig> demonstrate that: i) the -661/+ <dig> promoter region exhibits high reporter gene expression in hela cells; ii) luciferase activity is higher with the reporter construct lacking the -634/- <dig> sequence, suggesting the presence in this region of cis-acting elements inhibiting transcription; iii) the expression of the reporter gradually decreases when the sequence from - <dig> to - <dig> is progressively removed. these results clearly demonstrate that the maximal luciferase activity is dependent on the -512/+ <dig> sequence , indicating the presence within this region of positive regulatory elements, responsible for the maximum level of transcription activity. in order to identify putative binding sites for transcription factors, computer-assisted analysis of the sequences was performed. the -512/+ <dig> region displays sequence homology to the following transcription factor binding sites: usf <dig> , ap- <dig> , gata-1/ <dig> , nf-e <dig>  and sp <dig> . we have previously reported the interaction of sp transcription factors to p <dig> promoter  <cit> ; we therefore analyzed the other putative binding sites by emsa, demonstrating that only the usf <dig> element is able to bind nuclear extracts.

in vitro and in vivo interaction of usf <dig> and usf <dig> transcription factors with the aβh-j-j p <dig> promoter
to determine whether the e-box site is able to interact with usf <dig> and usf <dig> transcription factors, emsa experiments were carried out using  <dig> μg of hela nuclear extracts and the p1/usfmer probe . the results obtained are reported in figure  <dig> and indicate that the p1/usfmer probe stably interacts with nuclear extracts, forming the complexes shown in figure 5a . as expected, p1/usfmer and consensus usfmer probes efficiently compete with the binding , while sp1mer and myodmer probes do not . in order to demonstrate the presence of usf <dig> and usf <dig> transcription factors in the retarded complexes, supershift analyses were performed. we incubated p1/usfmer probe and  <dig> μg of nuclear extract from hela cells with antibodies against usf <dig>  usf <dig> or both factors . our results indicate that both antibodies induce a supershift of the retarded bands. these data conclusively demonstrate that both usf <dig> and usf <dig> are able to bind to the p1/usfmer probe in vitro.

in order to verify whether usf1/ <dig> and p <dig> promoter interact in vivo, chromatin immunoprecipitation  assays were performed on hela cells. chromatin was immunoprecipitated using either usf <dig> and usf <dig> antiserum and quantitative amplification of p <dig> promoter was performed on purified dna. a representative chip assay  shows that amplification curves from samples immunoprecipitated with usf <dig> or usf <dig> antisera reach threshold  <dig> cycles early than those treated with mef- <dig> antiserum or non immune serum. in figure 6b chip results are reported as immunospecific fold enrichment in p <dig> promoter sequences relative to a negative control sequence that lacks usf <dig> binding sites. the data supports the in vivo interaction between usf <dig> and usf <dig> and the p <dig> promoter in intact cells.

mutation of the usf element of the aβh-j-j p <dig> promoter: effects on transcription
effect on p <dig> promoter activity of usf <dig> silencing obtained by rna interference
in order to demonstrate the role of proteins belonging to the usf family on the transcription directed by the p <dig> promoter of the human aβh-j-j locus, silencing of the usf <dig> gene was performed using short interfering rnas. a double stranded oligonucleotide, targeting human usf <dig> rna sequence, or a scrambled sequence , which has no significant homology to human genes and transcripts, were cloned into psingle-tts-shrna plasmid. hela cells were then transiently transfected with usf <dig> shrna vector. to detect non-specific effects, scramble shrna vector and construct lacking small hairpin dna  were used as controls. two days after transfection, total rna was extracted and used for quantitative real time rt-pcr, using primers targeting usf <dig> mrna or p <dig> promoter specific transcripts. figure 8a shows that usf <dig> mrna levels are strongly reduced following transfection with usf <dig> shrna vector. in addition figure 8b shows that usf <dig> depletion was associated with inhibition of the p <dig> directed transcription. the effects of null shrna and scramble shrna vectors were much lower or absent on usf <dig> mrna levels  and p <dig> directed transcription  respectively.

discussion
the aim of the present paper is to investigate in detail one of the two promoter sequences regulating the transcription of the aβh-j-j locus  <cit> . we isolated and identified the 5'-flanking region of the exon  <dig> of this locus. the cloned nucleotide sequence allowed us to characterize the p <dig> promoter region, which is involved in the regulation of aah and humbug expression. we have been able to identify transcripts relative to p <dig> promoter activity in all tissues and cell lines analyzed  <cit> . similar to many housekeeping gene promoters, the region under investigation lacks a tata box and an initiator element  <cit> . in contrast, this sequence is gc-rich and presents homologies with sp <dig> consensus binding site, which we previously demonstrated to play a role in transcription  <cit> . transfection experiments with progressively deleted p <dig> promoter reporter constructs in hela cells showed that maximal promoter activity is located within  <dig> nucleotides from the principal transcription initiation site , a result which confirms our previous data in hepg <dig> and rd cell lines  <cit> . computer-assisted analysis of the -512/+ <dig> region indicates the presence of sequence homologies to binding sites for usf <dig>  sp <dig> and for other transcription factors. emsa analyses demonstrated no binding activity for these identified elements with the exception of usf <dig> and sp <dig> sites  <cit> . in the present study we analyzed the dna binding activity and function of usf transcription factors on p <dig> promoter.

the first conclusion of this manuscript derives from emsa assays, supershift analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, which coherently demonstrated that usf <dig> and usf <dig> factors bind to the p1/usf site of the p <dig> promoter, both in vitro  and in intact cells .

the second conclusion is the demonstration that these interactions are functionally relevant for transcription efficiency. the relevance of the usf binding for the transcription regulation of the p <dig> promoter has been addressed by two complementary approaches:  mutagenesis of the p1/usf element and  use of a usf <dig> silencing approach.

the results obtained concurrently demonstrate that usf transcription factors and usf <dig> binding site are involved in the up-regulation of the p <dig> promoter of the human aβh-j-j gene locus. on the other hand, mutagenesis experiments point out that the residual transcription activity of the double mutant is compatible with the presence of other transcription factors participating in the regulation of the p <dig> promoter. this is in agreement with previously published results from our group  <cit>  demonstrating the presence of at least  <dig> sp binding sites and sp1/ <dig> dependent transcription activity of p <dig> promoter. in addition, it is in agreement with the experiments on progressively deleted reporter constructs indicating that the decrease of transcription associated with the -512/- <dig> deletion is higher  than that of the single mutant - <dig> p1/usfmut construct with respect to the wild type plasmid . this evidence coherently sustain the concept that other regulatory factors, in addition to usf, are involved in p <dig> promoter directed transcription of the aβh-j-j locus.

when the results presented here are taken together with those recently published by feriotto et al.  <cit> , it appears that both sp and usf dna interactions and transcription activities are involved in the regulation of this human locus  <cit> .

comparison of the p <dig> and p <dig> promoter sequences of the aβh-j-j locus reveals important differences are clearly detectable  <cit> . the most interesting result emerging from studies focused on the p <dig> promoter is that the calcium-dependent transcriptional factor mef- <dig> activates the transcription of junctin, junctate and aβh in striated muscles and brain  <cit> . neither sp <dig> nor usf binding sites were detected within the p <dig> promoter. on the other hand, p <dig> promoter, which drives the expression of aah and humbug in most tissues, contains one usf <dig> and several sp <dig> functionally active binding sites within the sequence having maximal transcription activity  <cit> . the finding that the sequences present in the upstream p <dig> promoter are significantly different from those of the p <dig> promoter is, in our opinion, of great interest.

from the practical point of view, the impact of usf proteins in the transcriptional regulation of this locus will be of future interest considering the potential contribution of aah and humbug to the infiltrating growth of neoplasms by increasing cell migration and enhancing proliferation and survival  <cit> . for instance, overexpression of humbug and aah is associated with malignant progression in human gastric cancer cells  <cit> . in addition, relevant to our study, xian et al. found that the protein expression level of aah in the hepatocellular carcinoma was parallel with the mrna expression level, indicating that the expression is regulated at the transcription level  <cit> . inhibition of aah and humbug transcription could represent an attractive approach for gene therapy of infiltrating tumors  <cit> . of course, in discussing the possible implications of targeting mrnas for usf transcription factor, careful considerations are required, due to a wide involvement of this transcription factor in the regulation of expression of several genes, including genes involved in development and cell cycle progression  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
when the results shown in the present paper are considered together with previously published reports by our research group, it can be concluded that the aβh-j-j locus contains at least two functionally distinct promoters , and multiple alternative splicing sites, leading to the synthesis of the functionally distinct proteins, aah, humbug, junctin, and junctate  <cit> . the p <dig> promoter directs aah and humbug expression in most tissues and is up-regulated by sp and usf transcription factors.
