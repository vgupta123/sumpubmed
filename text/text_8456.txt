BACKGROUND
the generation and repair of blood vessels in adult life requires the regulation of endothelial cell survival, migration, proliferation and their differentiation from lineage-committed progenitors by the coordinated action of several classes of vaso-active agents including growth factors, cytokines, and the extracellular matrix   <cit> . elucidating the molecular mediators of these signals and their mechanism of action is vital to understanding the fine regulation of neo-vessel development and maintenance.

there is growing evidence pointing to a close collaboration between growth factors and the ecm in several biological processes including vasculogenesis and post-natal revascularization. studies have shown that the response of cells to growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor , platelet-derived growth factor  and epidermal growth factor  are potentiated by integrin ligation to specific ecm glycoproteins  <cit> . in a previous report, we showed that vegf-induced endothelial cell migration was augmented by fibronectin   <cit> . we also presented evidence that the vegf/vegfr- <dig> pathway is coupled to the integrin α5β <dig> through a mechanism involving the promotion of an integrin α5β1-vegfr- <dig> signalling moiety generated as a consequence of receptor ligation by a vegf-fn complex. these events promoted the sustained activity of erk kinase, which was coupled to the migratory response. more recently, we presented data demonstrating that fn significantly enhanced vegf-mediated migration of cd34+ cells and their differentiation into endothelial cells  <cit> . in addition to the vegf pathway, in vitro studies have highlighted the importance of hepatocyte growth factor  as a pro-angiogenic mediator. hgf, also termed scatter factor, has a well-established role in tumourogenesis but may be an important mediator of neovascularization since studies show that hgf induces the expression of vegf in endothelial cells in vitro and that hgf synergises with vegf to promote capillary-tube assembly in collagen matrices  <cit> . in addition, neovascularization in the rat cornea was also elevated by co-administration of hgf and vegf compared to either growth factor in isolation  <cit> . the emerging significance of hgf as a pro-angiogenic mediator was further highlighted by a recent study of a large cohort of patients  with acute coronary syndromes and identified serum levels of hgf as a positive indicator of patients' prognosis associated with a significantly lower event rate and increased collateralization of the target vessel  <cit> . although the pro-angiogenic effects of hgf are known, the detailed mechanism of hgf action on the vascular cells, including the identity of intracellular mediators remains poorly understood.

in the present work we show that hgf forms a specific physical complex with fn and vn and that these complexes are present in degranulated platelet suspensions implicating a putative role in vivo. significantly, we show that hgf-fn and hgf-vn molecular complexes induce a unique and enhanced intracellular signal employing ras, thereby highlighting an important mechanism of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase and integrin cooperation in promoting pro-angiogenic responses.

RESULTS
identification of novel hgf binding domains on fn and vn
we recently identified binding domains on fn for vegf, which played an important role in promoting the activity of vegf  <cit> . since hgf is also an important angiogenic factor, experiments were designed to establish whether hgf had specific ecm binding partners. using a solid phase assay, we measured the binding of 125i-labelled hgf to a variety of ecm molecules immobilized on plastic wells. as shown in fig. 1a, 125i-labelled hgf bound to both fn and vn specifically with residual binding observed to either collagen- <dig> or laminin. further experiments were performed to locate the hgf binding site on the fn molecule using purified fn proteolytic fragments immobilised onto the polystyrene microtiter wells. in these experiments 125i-labelled hgf bound to the  <dig> kda n-terminal fragment and the  <dig> kda c-terminal fragment. no significant binding was observed to the  <dig> kda fragment that harbours the internal cell binding domain . to further analyse the association between hgf and fn, the interaction of hgf with the fn fragments was measured in real time by surface plasmon resonance analysis . as shown in fig. 1c &1d, hgf bound to the  <dig> kda n-terminal fn fragment immobilized on the sensor chip in a specific and saturable manner with a kd of approximately  <dig> ±  <dig> nm for a one-site model. the data shown in fig. 1d could be applied to a two-site model with equal probability showing kd values for the high and low affinity sites of  <dig> nm ±  <dig> nm and  <dig> μm respectively. hgf binding to the  <dig> kda fragment could not be measured directly by spr, as immobilization of the  <dig> kda fragment on the sensor chip appeared to mask the hgf binding site .

platelets release hgf complexed to fn and vn
to establish whether hgf-fn and hgf-vn molecular complexes occur in vivo we examined platelets, a rich source of growth factors, for the presence of these complexes. washed human platelet suspensions were stimulated with thrombin  to promote degranulation and the derived supernatants were immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed to fn or vn. the resulting immune complexes were analysed for co-precipitation of hgf . immunoprecipitation of fn from thrombin-stimulated platelet supernatants resulted in significant co-precipitation of hgf . in contrast, minimal levels of hgf was observed in samples derived from unstimulated platelet supernatants or from samples derived from thrombin-stimulated platelet supernatants when an isotype-matched control antibody was employed in the experiment. probing of the same blot with antibodies to fn confirmed that the primary precipitation of fn was responsible for the co-precipitation of hgf . in a parallel experiment, immunoprecipitation of vn also co-precipitated hgf to a similar if not greater extent than fn . these experiments demonstrate that hgf is released from platelets and is found in the form of soluble molecular complexes with both fn and vn, confirming the results of the ligand binding studies in vitro.

hgf-induced endothelial cell migration is dependent upon co-stimulation with ecm
we next sought to determine whether the responses of endothelial cells to hgf could be modulated by its ecm binding partners. in cell migration assays, human microvessel endothelial cells  were incubated with an optimal concentration of hgf alone or in combination with fixed concentrations of fn, vn or collagen- <dig> . significantly, little or no endothelial cell migration above basal levels  was observed when cells were stimulated with hgf  in the absence of ecm. a moderate migratory response of endothelial cells to hgf was observed in the presence of collagen- <dig> , which was less than 2-fold above basal levels. when hgf was co-administered with either fn or vn, endothelial cell migration was significantly enhanced by 4– <dig> fold. the differences in magnitude of the migration in the presence of these ecm glycoproteins was not related to variable degrees of cell adhesion upon the transwell filters as hgf-stimulated endothelial cells adhered equally well to ecm glycoprotein-coated transwells . the migratory response to hgf was dose responsive with a maximal response observed at a concentration of 10– <dig> ng/ml . in addition, a negligible migratory response was observed when hmvec were stimulated with these ecm molecules in the absence of hgf consistent with our previous report .

to further characterize the degree and identity of integrin involvement in the observed migratory response, we investigated the consequences of blocking integrin receptors on hmvec with specific integrin antibodies prior to hgf-ecm stimulation. antibodies directed to the integrin α5β <dig> completely inhibited hgf-fn-induced endothelial migration . in contrast, an antibody with specificity for the αv-subunit  had no inhibitory effect on endothelial cell migration. however, antibodies to the αvβ <dig> integrin  did inhibit endothelial cell migration to hgf-fn by 20% suggesting an ancillary role for this integrin in mediating hgf-fn responses. when endothelial cell migration was induced by hgf-vn complexes, the integrin dependence shifted as expected . under these conditions endothelial cell migration was predominantly dependent on αv-integrins for mediating the migratory signal with some apparent involvement of the integrin α5β <dig> . this latter effect may be a consequence of integrin signal cross-talk , as reported previously  <cit> . these experiments demonstrate that for hmvec, hgf induced cell migration is dependent upon the ligation of integrins by ecm molecules.

met associates with αvβ <dig> and α5β <dig> integrins
previous work  <cit>  has demonstrated that the physical association of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases and integrins promote enhanced cellular responses. we, therefore, postulated that the elevated cell migration induced by hgf-fn and hgf-vn in the present study could be due to a signalling mechanism involving the physical association between met and integrins on endothelial cells. as shown in fig. 3a, endothelial cell lysates derived from samples exposed to collagen- <dig>  fn or vn, in the presence of hgf, when immunoprecipitated with antibodies to integrins α2β <dig>  α5β <dig> and αvβ <dig> respectively, predominantly co-precipitated met with the integrins α5β <dig> and αvβ <dig>  in contrast, met co-precipitation with the integrin α2β <dig> was minimal for lysates derived from cells stimulated with hgf and collagen- <dig>  the level of met expression in these samples was not altered by treatment of the cells with various combinations of hgf and ecm molecules  discounting the possibility that the differences in the level of met co-precipitation was due to differences in the expression levels of its antigen. in the absence of hgf, co-precipitation of met with the integrins α5β <dig> and αvβ <dig> was minimal despite the presence of the ecm glycoprotein, indicating that ligation of the integrin with its cognate ligand was not sufficient to induce an association with met.

to elucidate the role of met activation in the formation of the met-integrin signalling complex, endothelial cells were treated with hgf in the absence of ecm glycoprotein and with hgf-fn and hgf-vn complexes and the kinetics of met tyrosine phosphorylation investigated . these experiments demonstrated that hgf in the absence of ecm glycoprotein could activate met transiently with a strong signal present at  <dig> min but absent at  <dig> hour. in contrast, cells stimulated with hgf-fn and hgf-vn showed strong activation of met at  <dig> min, which was sustained at  <dig> hour and was evident, although reduced, at  <dig> hours post-stimulation. cell lysates derived from samples stimulated for  <dig> mins were also assessed for the presence of a met-integrin complexes. as shown in fig. 3c, hgf in the absence of fn or vn did not promote a significant association of met with the integrins α5β <dig> or αvβ <dig>  however, cells treated with hgf-vn and hgf-fn for  <dig> min contained significant levels of met in a physical association with these integrins. these studies show that met activation by hgf is insufficient to promote a physical association with integrins.

hgf binding domains on fn and vn promote enhanced intracellular signals
we next investigated whether the association of met with integrins modulated hgf/ecm-induced intracellular signalling, focussing on the erk and the pi- <dig> kinase pathways. analysis of the phosphorylation kinetics of erk-1/ <dig> in response to hgf alone or hgf/ecm combinations showed distinct patterns of activation . with hgf alone, erk 1/ <dig> phosphorylation showed kinetics with a peak signal at  <dig> min post-stimulation and significant reduction by  <dig> min although phosphorylation was still apparent. a distinct activation profile was observed when cells were stimulated with hgf and collagen- <dig> , with erk 1/ <dig> levels peaking at  <dig> min and returning to near basal phosphorylation levels by  <dig> min. however, stimulation of endothelial cells with either hgf-fn or hgf-vn complexes promoted a rapid but sustained phosphorylation of erk 1/ <dig> with levels near maximal at  <dig> min post-stimulation. analysis of the activation of the pi- <dig> kinase pathway was assessed by measurement of the phosphorylation status of akt/pkb on ser <dig> . interestingly, both distinct levels and kinetics of akt phosphorylation were observed in these samples. when endothelial cells were stimulated with hgf in the absence of ecm co-stimulation, little phosphorylation of akt above basal levels was observed. however, when cells were treated with hgf plus collagen- <dig>  akt phosphorylation was rapidly detected at  <dig> min and peaked at  <dig> min with significant reduction by  <dig> min. in contrast, with cells treated with either hgf-fn or hgf-vn complexes, akt phosphorylation kinetics appeared to mirror erk 1/ <dig> phosphorylation kinetics implying a common regulatory mechanism for both pathways. as with erk 1/ <dig> phosphorylation, akt phosphorylation peaked by  <dig> min post stimulation and this level of activation was sustained even at  <dig> min. significantly, akt phosphorylation levels in these samples were elevated approximately 3-fold,  compared with the levels in observed in cells stimulated with hgf plus collagen- <dig> .

hgf/ecm-induced endothelial migration is coupled to the pi- <dig> kinase pathway
to determine the intracellular pathway that were coupled to the migratory response, hmvecs were treated with specific inhibitors of mek and pi-kinase. in cell migration assays, ly <dig> but not u <dig> inhibited endothelial cell migration induced by hgf-fn  and hgf-vn , clearly demonstrating that the pi- <dig> kinase pathway was predominantly coupled to the migratory response and not the map kinase pathway. other inhibitors of potential down stream effectors were also tested. hgf-fn stimulated cells pre-treated with pp <dig>  u <dig>  and piceatannol showed maximal migratory responses indicating that src, plcβ and syk were not components of the migratory signal .

hgf-induced endothelial proliferation is coupled to the erk-pathway
the effect of the co-administration of ecm molecules with hgf on endothelial cell proliferation was also investigated. in contrast to cell migration, hgf, in the absence of ecm molecules, induced a significant proliferative response . however, in the presence of fn or vn, hgf-induced endothelial proliferation was enhanced compared to hgf alone or in combination with collagen- <dig>  as with the migratory response, endothelial cell proliferation was dose responsive to hgf with an observed maximal response at a concentration of 10– <dig> ng/ml . chemical inhibitors were then used to determine the signalling pathways involved in hgf-induced endothelial cell proliferation. in these studies, the mek inhibitor, u <dig> significantly impaired hgf-induced endothelial proliferation  irrespective of co-stimulation with or without ecm molecules. this suggests that unlike migration, which was shown above, to be pi- <dig> kinase dependent, the erk-pathway plays an important role in mediating hgf-induced endothelial cell proliferation. while both ly <dig> and fpt-iii blocked hmvec proliferation, this appeared to be due to apoptosis . this observation is consistent with the role of pi- <dig> kinase in promoting cell survival and a role for ras in regulating pi- <dig> kinase in these cells  <cit> .

ras is a specific, upstream regulator of erk and pi- <dig> kinase pathways in cells stimulated with hgf-fn and hgf-vn complexes
the data shown above indicate that hgf-induced endothelial cell migration and proliferation were mediated by pi- <dig> kinase and erk pathway respectively. we next investigated the role of ras in regulating these two pathways induced by hgf-fn and hgf-vn complexes. since ras is a well-documented regulator of p <dig> pi- <dig> kinase and erk and as well as a down stream effector of both the met and integrin receptors, we assessed the activation status of ras by measuring the comparative levels of gtp-loaded ras after endothelial cells were stimulated with hgf in the presence and absence of ecm molecules . endothelial cells stimulated with hgf alone showed high levels of gtp-ras at  <dig> min post-stimulation and this was sustained even at  <dig> min . in contrast, cells co-stimulated with hgf and collagen- <dig> showed activation of ras at  <dig> min post-stimulation but to a significantly lower degree , with the signal diminished by  <dig> min. with hgf-fn and hgf-vn co-stimulation, gtp-ras levels were more than two-fold higher than observed when cells were co-stimulated with hgf-collagen- <dig> . significantly, gtp-ras levels were sustained at  <dig> min consistent with the observations of the activation profiles for the map kinase and pi- <dig> kinase pathways. these studies suggested that inhibiting ras in cells stimulated with hgf-fn and hgf-vn complexes would exhibit reduced migration responses. to test this hypothesis, cells were treated with the membrane permeable farnesyltransferase inhibitor fpt-iii, which inhibits ras function as a consequence of the loss of membrane localization in the absence of farnesylation. upon stimulation with hgf-fn, endothelial cells treated with fpt-iii  showed little activation of ras following hgf-fn stimulation compared to basal levels in unstimulated cells . in comparison, pre-treatment of cells with the geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor ggti  had little inhibitory effect on hgf-fn induced ras activation. the effect of these inhibitors was tested in endothelial migration assays. endothelial cells pre-treated with fpt-iii displayed a profound reduction in cell migration of 50% and 73% when stimulated with hgf-fn and hgf-vn complexes respectively compared to cells pre-treated with ggti . in contrast, fpt-iii had little inhibitory effect on migration induced by hgf plus collagen- <dig> indicating that ras has no significant role in the regulation of the migratory signal with this stimulus.

to further characterise the role of ras in regulating endothelial cell responses to hgf/ecm, the effect of the fpt-iii inhibitor on the phosphorylation levels of erk 1/ <dig> and akt was investigated. in cells stimulated with hgf alone, erk 1/ <dig> was activated and significantly inhibited by the fpt-iii inhibitor and to a lesser extent by ggti . a similar inhibitory profile was observed for cells stimulated with hgf-fn  and hgf-vn . in contrast, cells stimulated with hgf and collagen- <dig> showed no apparent reduction in erk 1/ <dig> phosphorylation levels when pre-treated with the fpt-iii inhibitor suggesting little involvement of ras in the activation of erk 1/ <dig>  these samples were also assessed for akt phosphorylation as an indication of pi- <dig> kinase activity. consistent with our observations, stimulation of hmvec with hgf in the absence of ecm did not lead to a significant activation of akt . however, in the presence of collagen, akt activation was observed but this was not affected by pre-treatment of the cells with fpt-iii implying that ras was not an upstream regulator of the activation of pi- <dig> kinase. in contrast, hgf-fn complexes promoted a 3-fold enhancement of akt phosphorylation and this was inhibited by approximately  <dig> % by treating the cells with fpt-iii . these observations suggest that the inhibition of ras activation reduces the activation of pi- <dig> kinase for cells stimulated with hgf-fn complexes and not cells stimulated with hgf and collagen- <dig>  the data would therefore predict that when hmvec are stimulated with hgf-fn and hgf-vn complexes, specific integrins are utilized to recruit ras, which in turn would regulate the activation of pi- <dig> kinase. to test this hypothesis, we immunoprecipitated integrins α5β <dig> and α2β <dig> from cells stimulated with hgf-fn and hgf with collagen- <dig> respectively and analysed these integrin immune complexes for the co-precipitation of ras. high levels of ras was specifically associated with α5β <dig> immune complexes and this appeared be independent of hgf stimulation. little or no ras was co-precipitated with the integrin α2β <dig> .

discussion
the major finding of the present report is that hgf-induced endothelial cell responses are significantly augmented through the formation of molecular complexes between this growth factor and the ecm glycoproteins fn and vn. the significance of this finding is highlighted by the observation that hgf-induced endothelial cell migration, a pi- <dig> kinase coupled response, did not occur in the absence of additional signals originating from the ecm. however, hgf-induced endothelial cell proliferation was evident in the absence of signals emanating from the ecm. these observations have led us to propose a model for the mechanisms of hgf-induced responses in endothelial cells . this model shows that hgf alone can induce endothelial cell proliferation through its receptor met via activation of the ras-erk kinase pathway . however, this signal is insufficient to promote significant cell migration for which an additional signal from the ecm via specific integrin ligation appears necessary for activation of the pi- <dig> kinase pathway . uniquely, in cells stimulated with hgf-fn or hgf-vn complexes, which promotes the association of met with integrins, an enhanced and unique intracellular signal is generated by the recruitment and sustained activation of ras, which presumably, concomitantly activates both p <dig> pi- <dig> kinase and raf . this is in contrast to the mechanism of activation of the pi- <dig> kinase pathway induced by hgf in the presence of collagen- <dig>  which is ras independent .

the model in fig. 9c is supported by the following observations. the enhanced responses of hmvec to hgf-fn and hgf-vn complexes is consistent with the observation that in these cells the activity of ras, pi- <dig> kinase  and erk 1/ <dig> phosphorylation were sustained, and in the case of ras and akt, were 2– <dig> fold higher than observed in cells stimulated with hgf and collagen- <dig> . the distinct signalling mechanisms induced by the co-activation of endothelial cells with hgf in the presence of a binding and non-binding ecm glycoprotein partner was also supported by the observation that treatment of cells with the inhibitor of ras farnesylation, fpt iii, reduced the phosphorylation of both erk 1/ <dig> and akt kinases in cells stimulated with hgf-fn but not hgf plus collagen- <dig> . furthermore, ras co-precipitated with the integrin α5β <dig> derived from endothelial cell lysates stimulated with hgf-fn complexes but not with the integrin α2β <dig> derived from cells stimulated with hgf and collagen- <dig> . these results are consistent with the pioneering work by rodriquez-viciana and colleagues who demonstrated the regulation of p <dig> pi- <dig> kinase by ras via direct molecular interaction. it is now known that the regulatory subunit of all type  <dig>  pi- <dig> kinases contain a ras binding domain that associates with activated ras   <cit> . therefore, our data and model demonstrating the sustained activation of ras and pi- <dig> kinase by stimulation of endothelial cells with hgf-fn and hgf-vn complexes is consistent with previous work showing ras to be a key regulator of pi- <dig> kinase. the identity of the ras subtypes mediating the regulation of pi- <dig> kinase in our cell system is currently under investigation.

the results of the present study both support and extend our previous observations of the enhanced endothelial cell migration induced by vegf-fn molecular complexes  <cit> . in that study, vegf binding domains identified on fn drove the formation of vegf-fn complexes that upon receptor ligation promoted the association of the integrin α5β <dig> with vegfr- <dig>  this co-receptor activation gave rise to a sustained activation of the erk kinase activity, which promoted an enhanced migratory response. similarly, the present work has shown that hgf-fn and hgf-vn molecular complexes induce the formation of met-integrin signalling complexes promoting the transduction of a unique ras-dependent signal. several studies have illustrated the significance of the cooperation between integrins and growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases in mediating cellular responses. for example, the proliferation and migration of fibroblasts in response to pdgf-bb was enhanced in the presence of vn and was accompanied by the physical association of the αvβ <dig> integrin with the pdgf-β receptor  <cit> . furthermore, it was recently demonstrated that hgf in combination with fn prolongs the survival of gm-colony-forming cells  <cit>  and enhanced the adhesion and motility of mtln <dig> breast carcinoma cells  <cit> . in addition, integrins αvβ <dig> and αvβ <dig> were shown to be necessary for mediating fgf- <dig> and vegf mediated angiogenesis respectively by the differential regulation of components of the erk kinase pathway  <cit> . however, the present study extends these observations and is, to our knowledge, the first description of a distinct signalling pathway employed by the activity of growth factor-ecm molecular complexes as opposed to growth factors and ecm proteins functioning independently through ligation of their respective receptors. the identification of a ras-dependent pathway in endothelial cells specifically activated with hgf-fn and hgf-vn complexes as opposed to hgf in the presence of collagen- <dig> is significant and correlates with met-integrin association. although the precise nature of the interaction between the met tyrosine kinase and integrins was not elucidated, the role of ras in this system appears important for the sustained and enhanced activation of the pi- <dig> kinase and erk kinase pathways.

in contrast to the migratory signals promoted by vegf-fn molecular complexes  <cit> , hgf-fn and hgf-vn complexes induce a response in endothelial cells characterized by a tight coupling of the pi- <dig> kinase pathway to cell migration. several additional pro-angiogenic mediators such as sphingosine 1-phosphate and no, or the activation of cd <dig> and eph b <dig> receptors by their counter ligands, promote endothelial cell migration through activation of the pi- <dig> kinase pathway  <cit> . in addition, hgf on its own was shown to stimulate smooth muscle cell migration in a pi- <dig> kinase dependent manner  <cit> . however, the lack of a significant migratory response, coupled with the absence of akt phosphorylation observed in the present study, suggests that in primary endothelial cells the met receptor is unable to activate pi- <dig> kinase without cooperative signals from the ecm/integrins. this observation is intriguing bearing in mind that met has been shown to activate pi- <dig> kinase in epithelial cells via recruitment and activation of gab- <dig>  which directly interacts with the p <dig> subunit  <cit> . consistent with our observation of an integrin dependency for signal transduction, trusolino et al showed that in carcinoma cell lines met induced signals were considerably amplified as a consequence of its constitutive association with the integrin α6β <dig>  intriguingly, in this system the authors showed that the role of the integrin α <dig> subunit was independent of extracellular integrin ligation since a truncated α <dig> construct lacking its extracellular portion could mediate hgf/met responses and signals to downstream effectors provided that its ability to recruit the adaptor shc was not affected  <cit> . in contrast, our studies using primary endothelial cells showed that integrin ligation was essential for generating a significant migratory signal via pi- <dig> kinase and in the case of hgf-fn and hgf-vn complexes, for promoting the association of met with the integrins α5β <dig> and αvβ <dig> respectively. indeed, met association with the integrins α5β <dig> and αvβ <dig> was dependent upon the activation of both met and integrins through ligation of their cognate ligands since tyrosine phosphorylation of met by hgf alone could not induce integrin association . these observations support the contention of a signalling mechanism requiring the formation hgf-ecm molecular complexes as a prerequisite for met-integrin association and consequent signal amplifiation as proposed in fig. 9c. however, the importance of integrin cytoplasmic domains in recruiting ras and ras-binding partners appears to reflect a common mechanism of hgf signal transduction between these cellular systems.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of the present work demonstrate an important mechanism by which integrins collaborate with growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases on endothelial cells and predict that hgf binding domains on both fn and vn may play a significant role in promoting wound healing and post-natal neovascularization. in support of this contention, hgf-fn and hgf-vn complexes were identified in the supernatants derived from degranulated platelet suspensions indicating that these complexes do exist in vivo and may be deposited at sites of vessel perturbation or injury. this observation is similar to the identification of vegf-fn molecular complexes in platelet supernatants in our previous report  <cit>  and suggests that hgf and vegf may act synergistically in vivo. indeed, recent studies have shown that hgf synergises with vegf to promote capillary-tube assembly in collagen matrices and neovascularization in the rat cornea  <cit> . furthermore, hgf positively regulates vegf expression and down regulates tsp- <dig>  an inhibitor of angiogenesis, thereby promoting angiogenesis  <cit> . it is noteworthy that the hgf binding domains for fn were located in the same proteolytic fragments as those of vegf, namely the n-terminal  <dig> kda and c-terminal  <dig> kda fragments. further studies involving the fine mapping and characterization of the binding domains for vegf and hgf on fn and vn should help decipher the mechanism of interplay between these important pro-angiogenic mediators.
