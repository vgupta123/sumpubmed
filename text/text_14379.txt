BACKGROUND
lidocaine  represents an amide local anesthetic drug which is also systemically used as an anti-arrhythmic drug
 <cit> . it has recently also gained interest as systemically used prokinetic drug in the treatment of the postoperative ileus in horses
 <cit> .

since the transdermal drug administration provides many advantages over oral treatments or injections, the approach of transdermal drug delivery systems has attracted the attention of many researchers all over the world not only in human medicine but also in veterinary research. a topically applied drug has to overcome the main skin barrier, the stratum corneum, which comprises dead corneocytes embedded in a lipid-rich domain mainly consisting of free fatty acids, cholesterol and ceramides
 <cit> . studies in humans have demonstrated the effectiveness of topically applied lidocaine for treating chronic, neuropathic, osteoarthritic and muscle related pain
 <cit> . however, after placement of a single 5% lidocaine patch on each fore leg of horses, no lidocaine was detected in blood samples up to 12 hours of patch application
 <cit> . aside from this, after topical application of a single dose of  <dig> % lidocaine cream to horses no lidocaine was detected in blood or urine samples, while it could be determined in urine samples of dogs in concentrations up to 48 ng/ml after multiple applications to canine skin
 <cit> .

the objective of the current work was, therefore, to assess the impact of chemical and mechanical permeation enhancers on lidocaine permeation through equine skin using a simple diffusion technique. first, five different chemical additives known as permeation enhancers of transdermal drug delivery  were investigated for their impact on transdermal lidocaine delivery through equine skin. second, physical penetration enhancement was performed using microneedles  in order to pre-treat the equine skin samples before lidocaine application in the best aqueous solution determined in the first experimental setup.

method
chemicals
all chemicals used for the buffer solutions in the present study were of the highest purity available and were purchased from merck, darmstadt, germany. lidocaine hydrochloride monohydrate and dimethylsulfoxide were purchased from merck as well. ethanol was obtained from applichem gmbh, darmstadt, germany. propylene glycol was purchased from riedel-de haen, seelze, germany, isopropylalcohol from lab-scan, dublin, ireland, and isopropylmyristate from sigma-aldrich, steinheim, germany.

membranes
the skin was harvested from six male and female  warmblood horses after euthanasia in the clinic for horses, university of veterinary medicine, foundation, hannover, for reasons not related to the present study. thus, an ethical approval was not necessary for our study. the skin over the thoracic region was dissected away and was frozen at -20°c up to two weeks. the average age of the horses was 14 years .

in vitro permeation
the skin was defrosted at room temperature and the hair was removed with clippers before an electrical dermatome  was used to obtain 600 μm thick skin slices. franz-type diffusion cells  with a diffusion area of  <dig>  cm <dig> and a receptor volume of approximately 12 ml were filled with phosphate-buffered saline  and were maintained at 34°c to provide 32°c skin samples. small skin pieces  were incubated in pbs for 30 minutes before mounting the skin samples with the stratum corneum side uppermost. after baseline samples  were taken from the receptor chamber, 1 ml of each test substance solution was applied onto the skin. the permeation of lidocaine out of each test solution was examined in duplicate per animal, while six horses were investigated in total. samples from the receptor chamber were taken at predefined times up to 6 hours or 22 hours.

experimental setup
to investigate the effect of different vehicles on lidocaine permeation, the following vehicles were used : pbs, ethanol , propylene glycol , isopropylalcohol , isopropylalcohol/isopropylmyristate , and dimethylsulfoxide . furthermore, the effect of microneedle pretreatment on transdermal drug delivery of lidocaine was investigated using two microneedle rollers  with different needle lengths , both of which possessed of  <dig> titanium needles in a cylindrical arrangement . the microneedle pretreatment was performed after an incubation phase in pbs for 30 minutes using skin samples which were placed on a styropor panel and fixed with needles beyond the subsequent diffusion area of the skin samples. the microneedle rollers were rolled in four axes radial
 <cit>  over the skin surface before 1 ml of the lidocaine solution in pbs was applied. sample withdrawal from the receptor chamber  was performed at predefined times with replacement by  <dig>  ml pbs. the donor chambers were covered with parafilm .

analysis
the receptor medium samples were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography utilizing a model  <dig> pump at 1 ml/min, a model  <dig> uv–vis detector at 240 nm, and a model  <dig> autosampler  for the injection of 100 μl. a reversed phase hplc column  combined with a guard column , merck, darmstadt, germany) were used at 40°c. the mobile phase comprises 78% phosphate buffer  and 20% acetonitrile, 1% triethylamine and 1% acetic acid degassed via sonication.

data analysis
an automated algorithm
 <cit>  was used to calculate the maximum flux  and the apparent permeability coefficient . values from replicated in vitro experiments  at the same individual were used as average. differences between diffusion parameters of control  and of the chemical additives/microneedle pretreated skin samples were evaluated using kruskal-wallis test followed by dunnett´s multiple comparison test . a  <dig>  significance level was adopted.

RESULTS
lidocaine was able to permeate through equine skin out of all investigated formulations . the highest permeation of lidocaine was observed after administration of lidocaine in pure pbs and 50% dmso. formulations with 50% etoh, pg, ipa and ipm/ipa diminished the permeation rate of lidocaine.

parameters describing the features of the different vehicles on in vitro permeation of lidocaine are summarized in table 
 <dig>  lidocaine in pbs showed the highest maximum flux jmax and the shortest lagtime through equine skin compared to etoh, pg, ipa and ipm/ipa. statistical significant differences were found for jmax and the apparent permeability coefficients of control vs. etoh and pg . the 6 hour-recoveries of lidocaine in 50% etoh, pg and ipa  and ipm/ipa  were significantly different from the 6 hour-recovery of lidocaine in pbs . the addition of 50% dmso resulted in a comparable lidocaine permeation data to lidocaine applied in pure pbs. although the lagtimes ranged from the mean of  <dig>  hours  to  <dig>  hours , no statistical significant differences were determined. there was no statistical significance between the different chemical additives.

discussion
although there are many reports demonstrating that alcohols may act as skin permeability enhancers as solubilizing agents with delipidisation potential
 <cit> , in the present study no enhancing effect was observed for etoh or ipa supplementation on transdermal permeation of lidocaine. permeation of lidocaine, on the contrary, was diminished to alcohol supplementation to the vehicle compared to pure pbs which served as control. there are also various reports about permeation enhancements of sulfoxides like dmso
 <cit> , which can increase lipid fluidity and promote drug partition
 <cit>  or polyols like pg
 <cit> , which are described to solvate α-keratin and occupy hydrogen bonding sites
 <cit> . ipm exhibits a direct action on the stratum corneum, permeates into liposome bilayers and increases fluidity of membranes
 <cit> , but even this aliphatic fatty acid esters diminished lidocaine permeation through equine skin  comparable to pg. only dmso supplementation to the vehicle resulted in higher permeation rates of lidocaine compared to pg, ipa, etoh or ipm/ipa, but similar permeation levels to pure pbs. thus, the investigated chemicals show no effectiveness as permeation enhancers for lidocaine through equine skin, which may be due to the physicochemical nature of lidocaine. furthermore, species react different to permeation enhancers and topically applied drugs, which has been shown e.g. for lidocaine patches in various species. 5% lidocaine patches administered to humans, cats and dogs resulted in measureable lidocaine concentrations in plasma of the examined species
 <cit> , while there was a lack of systemic absorption of lidocaine from 5 % patches placed on horses
 <cit> . furthermore, dmso supplementation to the vehicle of transdermal applied lidocaine onto guinea pig skin resulted in higher transdermal permeation rates of lidocaine
 <cit> .

interspecies differences in the success of penetration enhancement via chemical additives may be due to differences in skin morphology and biochemistry. since the main skin barrier is maintained by the stratum corneum, its histology and lipid composition is of high importance. concerning various reports about interspecies differences in these parameters
 <cit> , the lack of chemical penetration enhancement in the present study may be due to differences in the skin lipid composition of horses
 <cit>  compared with other species
 <cit> .

due to the lack of chemical additives to enhance percutaneous permeation of lidocaine through equine skin, the second part of the present study was the investigation of the impact of mechanical permeation enhancers  on lidocaine permeation through equine skin. microneedles represent mechanical permeation enhancers in order to overcome the main skin barrier, the stratum corneum. this technology has been established to perforate the skin barrier without inducing pain or bleeding, as the needles are too short to stimulate the nerves and to damage blood vessels in the dermis
 <cit> . thus, the produced holes act as shunt ways for topically applied drugs with low permeability. in agreement with recent studies, microneedles enhance transdermal drug delivery of topically applied drugs
 <cit> . after microneedle pretreatment,  <dig>  fold higher amounts of lidocaine were determined in the present study in the receptor fluid after 6 hours with a  <dig>  fold higher apparent permeability coefficient in the microneedle pretreated skin samples. furthermore, the lag-times were reduced by 23% and 50% in dependence on the microneedle lengths. consequently, from the present results it can be concluded that microneedle pretreatment results in a rapid onset of lidocaine action within the skin and in the organism, which is in accordance with recent studies about lidocaine-containing microneedle products with a rapid, safe, and prolonged local analgesic action
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrate significant differences in transdermal permeation of lidocaine dissolved in various vehicles and the high potential of microneedle pretreatment on transdermal permeation enhancement of lidocaine through equine skin.

clinical relevance
for the therapy of a postoperative ileus a plasma level of lidocaine of 1- <dig> μg/ml plasma is necessary
 <cit> . since the mean blood volume of a horse is  <dig> l
 <cit> , 50- <dig> μg lidocaine have to be in the organism in order to gain effective plasma levels. with the assumption of  <dig> % recovery in the blood  a transdermal formulation containing  <dig> - <dig>  mg/ml may be adequate to reach effective plasma levels . but therefore, several in-vivo studies in horses have to be performed.
