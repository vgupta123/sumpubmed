BACKGROUND
the dominant and widely accepted model of modern human origins proposes that our species originated in africa ~ <dig>  years ago , and after environmental and/or cultural changes, emerged into eurasia ~85- <dig> kyr along the indian ocean coast toward australasia . in terms of human mitochondrial dna  patterns, this dispersal apparently occurred relatively soon after the appearance of macrohaplogroup l <dig> in africa . the two non-african lineages  diverged shortly afterwards, either just after modern humans left africa  <cit> , or perhaps within africa slightly earlier, as suggested by an ongoing debate surrounding the early geographical origin of macrohaplogroup m  <cit> . however, beyond this broad-scale view, the settlement patterns of many individual regions are still poorly understood, although some of them are key areas for investigating our species' recent history - either because of their location , or because they contain isolated or relict populations . this is the case for madagascar. the favoured settlement model suggests that the first human groups to reach the island did so extremely recently, around  <dig> - <dig> kyr, when there is clear archaeological evidence of human occupation  <cit> . furthermore, the genetic, cultural, and linguistic characteristics of the malagasy indicate that people from both africa, and island southeast asia played a major role in the colonization of the island, ultimately resulting in a population genetically and linguistically admixed from african and southeast asian sources  <cit> . still, major issues remain unresolved regarding the origin and relative contributions of each founder population to the extant malagasy gene pool.

the earliest archaeological evidence on the island is controversial. hippopotamus bones with cut-marks and evidence of human processing from iron tools have been found in the mikea forest, in madagascar's southwest, dating to ~ <dig> kyr  <cit> . later archaeological sites, now containing pottery, have been variously dated from the 4th to the 8th centuries ad. therefore, the island seems to have been visited at least intermittently by africans prior to the arrival of austronesian-speaking maritime travellers from island southeast asia sometime around the 7th or 8th centuries ad  <cit> . this settlement pattern is further supported by dated faunal extinctions, as well as palaeoenvironmental evidence of deforestation indicated by a decrease in tree pollen and an increase in small charcoal pieces in soil sediments  <cit> .

the ethnographic evidence is equally complex. all malagasy today speak a malayo-polynesian language, also called malagasy, which is most closely related to a language spoken in the barito river basin of southeast borneo, indonesia  <cit> . malagasy contains a number of loan words of african bantu origin, but these have apparently been borrowed from the swahili/sabaki group of languages, and thus form part of the cultural exchange that took place during more recent indian ocean trade  <cit> . however, oral tribal traditions suggest the earlier presence of a people called vazimba, who spoke a non-malagasy language. pockets of people still known as vazimba exist among the island's fishermen, and their non-malagasy lexicon has also been argued to be of bantu origin  <cit> . furthermore, two groups of hunter-gatherers still live on the island - the beosy and the mikea, who inhabit the forests of southwestern madagascar, and who were recognised as having african affinity as early as the 16th century  <cit> .

this paper presents the first comprehensive study of the mtdna diversity of three malagasy speaking groups, the mikea hunter-gatherers, the neighbouring vezo fishermen, and the merina central highlanders, and reveals new details regarding the early period of madagascar's complex history.

RESULTS
analysis of mtdna from  <dig> malagasy individuals  is broadly consistent with previous genetic studies  <cit> . we see a combination of southeast asian and african lineages that are likely to trace back to the initial settlement of the island around the 7th century ad. however, our results based on complete mitochondrial genomes also revealed the presence of five novel mtdna lineages that cluster into a previously uncharacterized clade whose geographic distribution seems to be restricted to the island of madagascar . the age estimates for this clade and its main sub-branches are shown in table  <dig> 

note. sequence classification into mtdna haplogroups was based on accepted nomenclature as detailed in the materials and methods section. m* include lineages that were not complete sequenced and thus could not be assignated to currently published haplogroups.

mutation rate references:  one substitution per  <dig>  years  <cit> ;  one synonymous transition per  <dig>  years  <cit> ;  one synonymous mutation  per  <dig>  years  <cit> . founder age: ρ =  <dig> ; σ =  <dig>  with the mishmar and colleagues approach  <cit> , and ρ =  <dig> ; σ =  <dig>  with the kivisild and colleagues  <cit>  and soares and colleagues  <cit>  approaches. tmrca, 95% confidence intervals , and founder age are given in years.

of the five novel lineages one was found among the mikea hunter-gatherers  and four among the vezo fishermen  . comparative phylogenetic analysis of worldwide mtdna genomes confirmed the clustering of these five lineages into a deep-rooted branch within macrohaplogroup m, which we name m <dig>  this new branch carries all the diagnostic polymorphisms of macrohaplogroup m as well as a substantial series of mutations that separates it from the root of macrohaplogroup m . haplogroup m <dig> is characterized by  <dig> coding region mutations  and  <dig> control region mutations  . the absence of a polymorphism at  <dig> in the five m <dig> carriers indicates a back mutation, and we consider this position another basal polymorphism of haplogroup m <dig>  haplogroup m <dig> splits into two branches, m23a and m23b. the former is represented by one individual from the vezo group whilst the latter, defined by a substitution at np  <dig> encompasses all the remaining vezo lineages and is also present in the mikea.

so far we found no convincing association of m <dig> with any known m branches. none of the diagnostic coding region mutations of m <dig> overlaps with the diagnostic markers in other m haplogroups that emerge directly from the root of macrohaplogroup m . while some control region mutations  are shared by other deep-rooted m haplogroups , these positions are known to be recurrent and cannot be safely considered as linking m <dig> to other haplogroups within macrohaplogroup m. this confirms the robustness of our phylogenetic reconstruction, and the basal position of m <dig> within m.

more detailed examination of the phylogeny, geographic distribution, and molecular dating of the m <dig> lineage reveals three further key points:

 as noted before, the position of m <dig> at the root of macrohaplogroup m indicates that m <dig> is a deep branch of the human mtdna phylogeny. the length of the m <dig> branch suggests either strong genetic drift effects or that this cluster may encompass further branches yet to be identified. indeed, a relatively small proportion of mtdna variation has been surveyed in the putative areas of origin of m <dig>  therefore more extensive sampling is needed to refine the overall geographic distribution and branching structure of this clade, however, the fact that this clade has no specific link to other known branches within macrohaplogroup m suggests a deep-rooted ancestry, possibly tracing back to the out of africa event. such a deep root is also shared with many other lineages that emerged independently from the root of macrohaplogroup m. these lineages are especially prevalent in south asia  <cit> . this general pattern has been interpreted as supporting the view of a rapid dispersal of modern humans at the time of the out-of-africa exodus, followed by a long period of isolation resulting in non-overlapping distributions of derived m haplogroups in relict or isolated populations/regions along the dispersal route. thus, our results suggest that the mikea hunter-gatherers and vezo fishermen of madagascar descend, if only in very small part , from one such deep-rooted, isolated population.

 m <dig> lineages have an extremely restricted geographic distribution. a survey of all complete mtdna sequences reported in the literature  could not detect m <dig> sequences anywhere outside madagascar. moreover, the screening of control region polymorphisms that are diagnostic for m <dig> against a larger global panel of mtdna control region variants confirmed that the m <dig> control region motif is indeed rare, as only four individuals shared the  <dig> control region diagnostic mutations for m <dig> . although comparative analysis based only on the first hypervariable sequence  reveals a few more individuals that share the four hvs <dig> mutations of m <dig> , these nucleotide positions are known to be fast-mutating and recurrent, and consequently cannot be considered diagnostic of haplogroup m <dig> . interestingly, three of the four individuals sharing the  <dig> control region mutations for m <dig> are african americans who are likely to trace their ancestry to sub-saharan africans, although no m <dig> carriers have been detected on mainland africa itself . the fourth individual is from the arabian peninsula , a region placed in southwest asia which has a long history of interactions with africa, probably dating back to the dispersal of modern human along the southern dispersal route  <cit> . the modern population of dubai has a genetic composition strongly influenced by female-mediated gene flow from sub-saharan africa, as well as migration from south asian populations  <cit> , which have the highest observed levels of basal m lineages  <cit> . although we have only detected four individuals potentially affiliated to m <dig>  they are likely to descend from an african and/or southwest asian source, again placing the origin of m <dig> somewhere between these two regions. unfortunately, lacking genealogical records for these four individuals, we cannot confirm their maternal african origin, and without additional mtdna coding region information, the link with african populations remains highly speculative. however, if confirmed, this finding would suggest that the origin and dispersal of m <dig> lineages is restricted to the circum-arabia/northwestern indian ocean regions.

 despite the limitations of molecular dating  <cit> , the estimated founder age of macrohaplogroup m using the m <dig> branch considered alone is 62- <dig> kyr  . this conforms to the revised age estimate of macrohaplogroup m  <cit> , and is slightly older than the proposed date for the dispersal of anatomically modern humans from africa, as well as the population expansion accompanying it  <cit> . the time to the most recent common ancestor  of m <dig> has been estimated at  <dig>  kyr  using a recently improved control region mutation rate  <cit>  , in broad agreement with dates obtained using previous coding region mutation rates . considering that a demographic expansion may predate a geographic one, it is worth noting that the lower age estimates of m <dig>  and especially of its subclade m23b, fall clearly within the holocene . although this is broadly consistent with a late holocene date for the initial settlement of madagascar  <cit>  and the concomitant demographic/geographic expansions, the large confidence intervals add uncertainty to the dispersal date of m <dig> and leave open the possibility that this rare lineage may represent an early pre-austronesian expansion into madagascar.

the presence of the m <dig> clade among the malagasy vezo fishermen and mikea hunter-gatherers provides additional mtdna evidence upon which a better picture of the colonization of madagascar can be built. however, open questions remain, including the geographic origin of m <dig>  and the time and mode of its spread into madagascar. these outstanding issues can only be partially investigated with the currently available data. the m <dig> lineage is not present in any of the putative parental populations of the malagasy , suggesting either its absence from these populations, or that it is so exceedingly rare there that it has not yet been detected  <cit>  . indeed, relative to their genetic diversity, africans and southeast asians have not been widely sampled, although borneo  has been relatively well surveyed, and a high number of published mtdna sequences  is currently available from this area  <cit> . nonetheless, m <dig> lineages have not been identified in this region. even if m <dig> is as rare in borneo as it is in madagascar , the probability of it being detected there is high: p =  <dig> . however, the extreme population structure of indonesia  <cit>  may mean that m <dig> is restricted to populations that have not yet been sufficiently sampled, or at all.

an alternative hypothesis is that the m <dig> motif developed in situ in madagascar, either completely or partially. if this is the case, a pre-m <dig> lineage should have evolved more or less in isolation within the founder population that later participated in the colonization of madagascar.

the identification of four individuals of african and southwest asian origin who share the  <dig> diagnostic control region mutations for m <dig> pinpoints these regions as potential sources for m <dig>  whilst, the data does not allow us to make clear phylogeographic inferences regarding m <dig> origin, our results may provide some evidence of ancient contacts across the indian ocean involving africa, madagascar and south asia. the deep-rooted topology of m <dig> and its age estimate coupled with its very restricted distribution within madagascar, makes unlikely its presence in the island as a result of recent contacts, and is more in agreement with the patterns of human contacts across the arabian sea and the indian ocean, which pre-dated the austronesian expansion into madagascar  <cit> .

whilst more extensive screening of the putative parental populations in africa and south asia will help to ascertain the geographic origin and distribution of m <dig>  our initial examination of malagasy mtdna diversity suggests that the origin of m <dig> lineages may be found in the circum-arabia/northwestern indian ocean regions and that their arrival to madagascar may pre-date the austronesian settlement of the island. this lends support to oral tribal traditions stressing the earlier presence of non-malagasy speakers  and re-emphasizes the importance and complexity of the circum-arabia and indian ocean corridor since the late pleistocene.

CONCLUSIONS
the finding of a new deep branch of the out-of-africa founder m, named as m <dig>  in fishermen and hunter-gatherers from southwestern madagascar raises many questions regarding both the clade's origin and its role in the settlement of madagascar. extant data cannot provide unequivocal evidence for the origin of m <dig>  although the current distribution of macrohaplogroup m points to southeast asia as the most likely source region. additional archaeological surveys, population sampling from south asia and east africa/madagascar, and further phylogeographic analyses are necessary to ascertain the exact time and place of origin of this clade, as well as its geographic dispersal. however, this novel mtdna branch already provides a new suite of diagnostic markers to expand the search for its geographical and temporal origin.
