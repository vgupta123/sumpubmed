BACKGROUND
plant -β-glucan endohydrolases are members of the gh <dig> family of glycosyl hydrolases  <cit>   and are commonly known as cellulases. enzymes of this group will catalyse the hydrolysis of -β-glucosyl linkages in soluble cellulose derivatives, such as carboxymethyl cellulose, but most plant gh <dig> family enzymes hydrolyse crystalline cellulose very slowly, if at all. the gh <dig> enzymes will also hydrolyse cell wall polysaccharides that have contiguous -β-glucosyl residues in their chain, such as xyloglucans and -β-glucans. we therefore refer to them here as endo--β-glucanases.

plant endo--β-glucanases have been implicated in the breakdown of cell walls during processes observed in normal plant growth and development, including fruit and leaf abscission, grain germination and senescence  <cit> . the endo--β-glucanases are also detected in growing roots and shoots  <cit>  and in developing anthers  <cit> . in arabidopsis , loss of activity of an endo--β-glucanase associated with root cap sloughing results in retarded root growth  <cit> .

thus, endo--β-glucanases clearly function in cell wall degradation, but there is a good deal of evidence that points to an additional and important role for these enzymes in cellulose synthesis during cell growth. in arabidopsis , rice , tomato  and populus tremuloides, endo--β-glucanase genes affect cellulose content of the cell wall  <cit> . an endo--β-glucanase, commonly known as korrigan, has been characterized in detail and plays an important role in cellulose synthesis. mutant and t-dna insertion lines of korrigan generally have lower levels of crystalline cellulose and increased levels of pectin and non-crystalline cellulose in their walls, together with related phenotypic features such as impaired cell elongation, dwarfing and wall separation between cells  <cit> . furthermore, it has been suggested that the sub-group of endo--β-glucanases that carry transmembrane helices may be specific to cellulose synthesis rather than being involved in the hydrolysis of cellulose or non-cellulosic polysaccharides  <cit> . in this connection, the endo--β-glucanase family has been divided into three sub-families on the basis of variations in protein sequences  <cit> . the gh9a sub-family proteins have a single nh2-terminal transmembrane helix and a recognizable catalytic domain; the latter has a characteristic dagd amino acid sequence motif. the gh9b sub-family proteins only have the catalytic domain, while the gh9c sub-family includes proteins with the catalytic domain and a cooh-terminal carbohydrate binding module   <cit> . members of the gh9c group of endo--β-glucanases from rice and tomato have been shown to have a broader substrate specificity, insofar as they can hydrolyse -β-xylans and in some cases -β-mannans  <cit> .

from a more practical point of view, it has been shown that stalk strength of maize plants is correlated with cellulose content  <cit>  and that lodging of maize plants that have insufficient stalk strength to support the cob and ripening grain can cause substantial losses in yield  <cit> . if endo--β-glucanases are involved in cellulose synthesis, as suggested above, it follows that they might play an associated role in stalk strength and resistance to lodging.

in the work described here, we have examined the phylogeny of endo--β-glucanase gene families in selected grass species for which genome sequences are available. transcription patterns of the genes have been compared and suggest that groups of genes are co-expressed in different tissues and/or at different times during plant development. this has enabled groups of genes to be linked with specific functions in wall synthesis, re-modeling or degradation.

RESULTS
endo--β-glucanase gene families in the grasses have more than  <dig> members
searches for gh <dig> family genes in the cazy and gramene databases, the barley genome zipper, the brachypodium  genome sequence and a maize b <dig> bac library found a total of between  <dig> and  <dig> putative endo--β-glucanase genes in each species . evidence for homoeologues from an ancient allotetraploidy event or for segmental duplications was found in five pairs of maize genes, where the following genes had amino acid sequence identities of more than 90% and were found at two or more map locations: zmcel <dig> and zmcel7b, zmcel <dig> and zmcel <dig>  zmcel <dig> and zmcel <dig>  zmcel <dig> and zmcel <dig> and zmcel <dig>  the latter being found at three different locations on the genome. these gene numbers in the grasses are similar to arabidopsis, where  <dig> putative endo--β-glucanase genes have been identified; the majority of genes in each case fall into the gh9b group .


total gene numbers for barley, maize, sorghum, rice and arabidopsis showing sub-families as annotated by urbanowicz et al.  <cit> . one of the arabidopsis genes, atgh9b <dig>  is likely to be a pseudogene.

orthologous endo--β-glucanase genes were identified using a combination of criteria, including the similarities of their deduced protein sequences, intron splice sites and putative exon-intron boundaries, codon-based evolutionary distances and syntenic genome locations. the orthologous genes from rice, maize, barley and sorghum are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the orthologous protein sequences deduced from the gene sequences generally fall into the various clades of the phylogenetic tree shown in figure  <dig> 

.

endo--β-glucanase genes exhibit a diverse phylogeny
the unrooted parsimonious phylogenetic tree generated from the amino acid sequence alignment of the grass species and arabidopsis endo--β-glucanase genes is presented in figure  <dig>  the tree shows the diversity of the endo--β-glucanase genes in grasses and although it does not exactly reflect the three structural sub-families defined by urbanowicz et al.  <cit> , groups within these sub-families that contain endo--β-glucanases with a transmembrane helix , a cbm  or only a catalytic site  are evident . we have named the groups gh9b <dig>  gh9b <dig>  etc. most, but not all, clades include representatives from arabidopsis. notwithstanding tandem duplications of arabidopsis endo--β-glucanase genes on chromosome  <dig> and the homoeologues and duplications in maize, there would appear to be a differential loss and gain of genes between the cereals and arabidopsis that is not reflected in the numbers of genes in each sub-family.

to examine more closely the relationship between the duplications and homoeologues in maize and sorghum, a second tree, again based on amino acid sequence, was produced to assess this relationship, using rice as the out-group . the tree indicates that zmcel7b, zmcel12chr <dig> and zmcel <dig> are more closely related to their sorghum orthologues than to their respective homoeologues. this suggests they may be derivatives of the allotetraploidy event and that a sorghum ancestor was the donor. in contrast, zmcel <dig> and zmcel <dig> are more closely related to each other than their sorghum orthologue, which suggests a duplication rather than homoeology event.

sequence alignments revealed a number of variants of the putative dagd catalytic site motif, including dsgd, dggd, dagg, dggs, nasd and dggg. the dsgd and dggd variants are not found in arabidopsis and exist only in orthologous sets of genes in the grasses. thus, the dsgd motif is found in the gh9b and gh9c sub-families, while the dggd motif is found in sub-family gh9b. it is likely that these amino acid substitutions occurred after the divergence of monocots from dicots, but before separation of the grasses.

exon/intron structures are consistent with clade structures
examination of intron numbers and positions in the endo--β-glucanase genes in the grasses shows that although there are some variations in numbers of introns, in general, the intron positions and exon sizes are conserved between orthologues determined from the phylogenetic tree. in table  <dig>  predicted intron sites of representative maize endo--β-glucanases are shown in relation to selected clades from the phylogenetic tree.


“x” indicates the presence of an intron for the gene in that row.

in the case of maize sub-family gh9a and clade gh9b <dig>  common intron splice sites that are unique to these two clades provide evidence that these genes have originated from a common ancestor. this is demonstrated by the presence of intron  <dig>  which is common to all gh9a and gh9b <dig> genes only, and intron  <dig>  which is common to all gh9a and clade gh9b <dig> genes except zmcel <dig> and zmcel <dig>  as a generalisation, while clade gh9b <dig> and gh9a contain introns  <dig> and  <dig>  the remainder of the endo--β-glucanase genes contain introns  <dig> and  <dig>  a closer look at gh9c gene structure in maize indicates that intron  <dig> is not present, but it is seen in three of four rice gh9c genes. this suggests loss of the intron from the gh9c genes in maize, sorghum and barley since their separation from rice. with the exception of the cbm, the gh9c sub-family and clade b <dig> all have common exon lengths, except for the first and last exon .

endo--β-glucanase genes are distributed across the grass genome
in silico mapping of endo--β-glucanase genes in grasses for which genome sequences are available indicated that the genes are broadly distributed across the genomes. this is exemplified by the situation in maize , where endo--β-glucanase genes are found on every chromosome except chromosome  <dig>  considering that maize was once an allotetraploid it is not surprising that five maize endo--β-glucanase genes appear to be duplicated, or homoeologous. figure  <dig> shows that the position of the five matched pairs of endo--β-glucanase genes is in accordance with the estimated homoeology between the two maize antecedent genomes  <cit> . this suggests that the duplicated genes are homoeologues in all but one case, namely zmcel <dig>  the zmcel <dig> gene located on chromosome  <dig> is not homoeologous with the other two zmcel <dig> genes on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  and may be the result of a recent segmental duplication. there did not appear to be any other recent tandem duplications of endo--β-glucanase genes in maize. although several genes appear to be closely located on the map, physical distances between them are quite large and they are not closely related. for example, zmcel <dig> and zmcel <dig> on chromosome  <dig> are in fact separated by  <dig> kb and are not closely related with respect to the phylogenetic tree.


similar results were obtained for the other grass endo--β-glucanase genes . in rice, one recent tandem duplication has occurred since separation of rice from the other grasses , but recent tandem duplications were not found in sorghum and as noted above, one segmental duplication of very recent origin was found in maize.

synonymous substitution rates distinguish tandem duplications and polyploidization
to explore the rates of evolutionary change within sub-families and between orthologues, codon based pairwise synonymous  and non-synonymous  substitution rates were analysed and the ratio of dn:ds calculated as a measure of relative evolutionary pressure being exerted on a gene pair. using the numbers of synonymous changes per synonymous site  it was possible to estimate the number of synonymous changes per synonymous site per year , or ks, that have occurred since separation of maize and sorghum from rice, and rice and barley from maize. it was assumed that the antecedents of barley and rice separated from those of maize and sorghum  <dig> mya . this provided a means of estimating the number of years since separation of maize from sorghum , and barley from rice .


using the paml codeml model  <cit> , an annual substitution rate of 5– <dig>  × 10- <dig> synonymous substitutions per synonymous site per year was observed with eight maize/sorghum gene pairs. a second level of substitution containing  <dig> gene pairs was estimated at between  <dig>  and  <dig>  × 10- <dig> with a third level above  <dig> × 10- <dig> . the homoeologous pair zmcel12chr <dig> and zmcel12chr <dig> separated most recently, at around  <dig> million years ago  . the majority of orthologous genes have an estimated separation time of  <dig> to  <dig> mya . the gene pair zmcel <dig> and zmcel <dig> has an estimated separation time of  <dig> mya. this is unexpected on the basis of their very similar sequences, but reinforces the result obtained from the phylogenetic tree for the sorghum and the maize orthologues , which indicates that zmcel <dig> and zmcel <dig> are likely to have resulted from an earlier duplication event rather than the allotretraploidy event that produced the homoeologues. mutation rates in the maize and sorghum gene orthologues are generally lower than that observed for the zmcel7/zmcel7b pair . comparisons of synonymous substitution rates between maize and maize cel gene orthologues, maize and sorghum gene orthologues and barley and rice gene orthologues are shown in figure 3e, where the rates can be broadly classified into three groups, namely  <dig> - <dig> ,  <dig> - <dig>  and greater than  <dig> 

from the phylogenetic tree  it can be seen that there is no orthologue for zmcel <dig> in rice. it can be surmised that zmcel <dig> and zmcel <dig> are the result of an earlier duplication event. again using rice as the out-group, time since separation between zmcel <dig> and zmcel <dig> is estimated as  <dig>  mya. this result suggests that zmcel <dig> and zmcel <dig> are the result of a duplication event and genome rearrangement in the maize/sorghum antecedent since separation from rice, rather than the loss of a gene in rice.

clade b <dig>  shows a group of orthologues in the cereals that contain four or five genes from maize, sorghum and rice and only one arabidopsis gene. further distance analysis was done on these genes to try and identify their time of separation. for zmcel <dig> and zmcel <dig> a separation time of  <dig>  mya was estimated, while for zmcel <dig> and zmcel <dig> a separation time of  <dig> mya was estimated. these times coincide with the time of separation of rice and barley from maize and sorghum antecedents, and reinforces that duplication most likely occurred just prior to their separation.

transcript analyses required multiple methods
several methods of transcript analysis were employed across different tissues in barley and maize. these yielded a broad range of transcript levels, and it was necessary to place some boundaries on what transcript levels can be confidently ascribed to be above background levels. to this end a qpcr transcript level of < <dig>  copies per μl normalised cdna was considered low and below  <dig> copies per μl cdna was considered background. a moderate level of transcript was arbitrarily defined as between  <dig>  and  <dig>  copies per μl cdna and above  <dig>  copies was considered high. for the mpss data, less than  <dig> ppm was considered to be a background level of transcript, 5– <dig> ppm was considered low  <cit>  and above  <dig> ppm classified as high.

four groups of barley endo--β-glucanases are co-transcribed
there are only  <dig> of the  <dig> barley endo--β-glucanase genes represented on the plexdb database experiment bb3: transcription patterns during barley development  <cit> , where it is apparent that there is a good deal of variation in transcript abundance between genes and tissues . a total of  <dig> barley genes was subsequently analysed for transcript levels using qpcr, as described by burton et al.  <cit> . the tissue series comprises a set of  <dig> barley tissue cdnas that represent most parts of the plant, at various stages of development  <cit> . the results are presented in figure  <dig>  comparative analysis of transcript patterns indicated that the genes could be divided into four co-transcribed groups. group  <dig> contains hvcel <dig>  hvcel <dig> and hvcel <dig> , which are transcribed mainly in vegetative tissues, especially the leaf base and peduncle, but also, to a lesser extent, in the spike. group  <dig> contains hvcel <dig> and hvcel <dig> , for which most transcripts were found in root tip, root base and leaf base, but also in the anther at preanthesis. the third group contains hvcel <dig>  hvcel <dig>  hvcel <dig> and hvcel <dig>  all of which were transcribed in floral tissues, but also root tip . the fourth group contained hvcel <dig> and hvcel <dig> and showed significant levels of transcripts in floral tissues only . the transcript correlation data are summarized in table  <dig>  in addition, transcript data for the group  <dig> hvcel <dig>  hvcel <dig> and hvcel <dig> genes in the various tissues are presented in figure  <dig>  thus, in groups  <dig> and  <dig>  the correlation coefficients  were greater than  <dig> , and in some cases as high as  <dig> - <dig> . the groups of barley endo--β-glucanase genes described above were also co-transcribed with r <dig> values of greater than  <dig>  in a barley stem tissue series in which elongation, transition and maturation zones were assessed independently, as described by burton et al.  <cit>  .


analyses of co-transcription of the barley hvcel genes with other genes that are likely to be involved in cell wall biology were also performed . using an r <dig> value of  <dig>  as the threshold point, hvcel <dig>  hvcel <dig> and hvcel <dig>  were correlated with hvcesa <dig>  which is known to be involved in cellulose synthesis in secondary cell walls  <cit> . other genes showing strong co-transcription correlations included a fasciclin-like arabinogalactan protein , cobra  <dig>  and five glycosyl transferase genes. these included members of the gt <dig> and gt <dig> groups, together with an α-galactosyl transferase . the hvcel <dig> gene showed correlation coefficients of > <dig>  with six expansin genes and xyloglucan endotransglycosylase  <dig> , while the hvcel <dig> gene was co-transcribed with the cellulose synthase-like d <dig> gene .


the table shows endo- <dig> -β-glucanase genes that are co-transcribed with other genes involved in cell wall metabolism with correlation coefficients  > <dig> . hvfla10g2: fasciclin-like arabinogalactan protein; hvgt43-7: β-3-glucuronosyl transferase; hvgt43-1: β-glucuronosyl transferase; hvgt47-5: glycosyl transferase; hvc41552g2: glucogenic glycosyl transferase; hvc19112g2: α-galactosyl transferase; hvexp- expansin.

groups of maize endo--β-glucanase genes are also co-transcribed
the dupont-pioneer mpss database contains sequences of mrna from approximately  <dig> tissues, including preparations from ‘core tissues’ of root, mesocotyl/coleoptiles, leaf, stalk, apical meristem, immature ear, ovary, embryo, endosperm, pericarp, silk, tassel/spikelet and pollen. three genes, zmcel <dig>  zmcel <dig> and zmcel <dig> have transcripts in pollen only, whilst a large number of genes show substantial transcript levels in meristem tissues. the data for the  <dig> genes with detectable transcript in maize b <dig> stem tissues including internode meristematic tissue, rind, vascular bundles, elongating, transition and mature zones of the internode and nodal plate have been extracted. these data show that zmcel <dig>  zmcel <dig>  zmcel <dig> and zmcel <dig> have high levels of transcript across all or most stem tissues analysed and zmcel <dig>  zmcel <dig>  zmcel <dig>  zmcel <dig>  zmcel <dig> and zmcel <dig> are transcribed at much lower levels and not in all stem tissues. the average mpss data expressed as ppm in the  <dig> core tissues are shown in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

although the structure of the maize stem differs to that of barley, an attempt was made to harvest the maize stem tissue series so that it aligned approximately with the stages of maturity of the barley stem developmental series, prior to qpcr analysis of specific maize endo--β-glucanase genes. in total,  <dig> genes were successfully analysed. the zmcel <dig>  zmcel <dig> and zmcel <dig> genes are transcribed across most or all of the internode tissues examined. the zmcel <dig> transcripts are found chiefly in elongating tissues, while zmcel <dig> and zmcel <dig> have low levels of transcript, mainly in the vascular bundles during elongation and early maturation .

a transcriptional correlation analysis across the  <dig> core tissues of the mpss database showed that several sets of genes were correlated at r <dig> values greater than  <dig> . sets of genes with transcript correlations at this level include zmcel <dig>  zmcel <dig> and zmcel <dig>  with transcript in apical meristem, immature ear and ovary, with zmcel <dig> and zmcel <dig> co-transcribed in pollen. the zmcel <dig>  zmcel <dig>  zmcel <dig> and zmcel <dig> genes are transcribed chiefly in ovary and root, but, with the exception of zmcel <dig>  display only background levels of signature tag abundance. when mpss data for all stalk tissues were tested for gene correlations, only zmcel <dig> and zmcel <dig> showed a correlation of r2 >  <dig> .

a correlation matrix across the qpcr stem series transcript data showed that zmcel <dig> and zmcel <dig> were highly correlated at r2 >  <dig> , as were zmcel <dig>  zmcel <dig>  zmcel <dig>  zmcel <dig> and zmcel <dig>  these results are presented graphically in figure  <dig> 


discussion
similar numbers of endo--β-glucanase genes are found in maize , barley , rice  sorghum , brachypodium  and arabidopsis  . the phylogenetic tree shows that evolutionary distance has resulted in differential gene loss and gain between the cereals and arabidopsis . a group of genes without a cbm, but related to the gh9c sub-family as deduced from the phylogenetic tree and intron/exon structure, has expanded in all of the cereals analysed since their separation from the dicots, producing a group of genes that are cereal specific. the  <dig> genes in the maize genome include five homoeologues and duplicates, and codon-based analysis indicates that one of the zmcel7/7b, zmcel12chr2/12chr <dig> and zmcel25/ <dig> pairs may have been gained from the recent allotetraploid event, the zmcel14/ <dig> and zmcel6/ <dig> pairs may be the result of an earlier tandem duplication event prior to separation from the sorghum ancestor, while zmcel12chr <dig> is probably a segmental duplication that has occurred since allotetraploidy.in more general terms one can debate the functional reasons for these relatively large gene families for the endo--β-glucanases of the poaceae and speculate as to whether some positive selection pressure has led to the expansion of the gene families. it is likely that the duplication of genes enables plants to independently regulate individual genes in individual cells during different stages of growth and development, or in response to abiotic or biotic stresses. at this stage we do not know if any of the endo--β-glucanase genes of the poaceae can be simply classified as genetically ‘redundant’, because there are few data available as to any compensatory effects that occur when the expression of plant endo--β-glucanase genes are perturbed. another consideration is that enzymes of the gh <dig> family are often assumed to be endo--β-glucanases, but these assumptions are usually based on sequence homology rather than on rigorous substrate specificity studies. thus, it is apparent that many plant gh <dig> enzymes have some activity on -β-glucans, on xyloglucans, glucomannans and on -β-xylans  <cit>  . as a result, it is not yet clear as to whether genetic redundancy occurs in the endo--β-glucanase gene families of plants.

the number of synonymous substitutions per year  vary between the different genes of maize, barley, rice and sorghum in the endo--β-glucanase gene family, but are remarkably similar within orthologous groups . we acknowledge that times of separation as calculated using synonymous substitutions per synonymous site per year should be regarded with caution. however, using the estimate of a general divergence of cereals of around  <dig> mya, this analysis predicts that maize and sorghum separated at between  <dig> and  <dig> mya, and that rice and barley separated at around  <dig> mya. evolutionary analysis of the maize duplicates/homoeologues suggests that a sorghum antecedent provided the dna for the allotetraploid event. as found in other studies using linkage analyses, there has been retention of gene synteny of the orthologues. these estimated divergence times are consistent with those estimated elsewhere  <cit> .

the values for ks obtained here for the endo--β-glucanase genes may be compared with those estimated for the alcohol dehydrogenase  and other genes  <cit> . some endo--β-glucanase genes have estimated ks values of  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  which are similar to those published for adh <dig> and adh <dig> <cit> . however, as determined by our analyses and others  <cit> , the rate of nucleotide substitution varies between genes and, in the case of the endo--β-glucanases, three different rates could be distinguished .

although genome sequences are now available for several grasses, it is more difficult to obtain large scale, robust information on transcriptional activities of the genes of interest. here, we have used qpcr and microarray data to analyse transcript levels of selected barley endo--β-glucanase genes in different tissues and in individual plant organs during growth. the selected genes are likely to include the most highly transcribed hvcel genes, because the gene sequences originally placed on the commercial barley microarray were obtained from est databases. at the conclusion of this study a genome scaffold sequence of barley became available  and while it was possible to use this sequence to identify all the endo--β-glucanase genes in barley, it was not possible to get qpcr data for every hvcel gene in barley. comparison of transcript abundance across different platforms, tissues, and developmental stages can be problematic  <cit> . nevertheless, analysis of the sub-set of barley hvcel genes allowed groups of co-transcribed genes to be identified, and revealed striking similarities between transcription patterns of the endo--β-glucanase genes from maize and barley . whether or not these similarities can be extrapolated more generally across the grasses remains to be demonstrated.


as described in the text, both barley and maize genes showed several different transcript patterns.

barley genes were categorised into groups according to co-transcription patterns as indicated on the left hand side of the table and described in the text. on the right side of the table are the maize orthologues and their subjective groupings as described in the text. the maize orthologues of hvcel <dig> and hvcel <dig> could not be exactly determined, zmcel <dig> or zmcel <dig> are their closest orthologues as determined by phylogenetic analysis .

on the left is a summary of transcript in the tissue developmental series and the stem series for selected barley genes, which are compared with orthologous maize genes on the right of the table showing transcript from mpss data and a maize stem series.

the barley developmental series data showed four patterns of transcription that related to both tissues and transcript levels, which aided in grouping of the transcript data . despite the problems associated with comparing transcripts from various sources, the data here strongly suggest that in barley the major endo--β-glucanases involved in stem development are hvcel <dig>  hvcel <dig>  hvcel <dig>  hvcel <dig> and hvcel <dig>  moreover, transcript patterns for several of these genes were closely correlated. these five barley genes were orthologues of the maize genes zmcel <dig>  zmcel <dig>  zmcel <dig>  zmcel <dig> and zmcel25/zmcel <dig>  which are also transcribed predominantly in vegetative tissues. together with the orthologues hvcel <dig> and zmcel <dig>  whose main transcripts were found in floral and developing endosperm, these findings suggest evolutionary conservation of transcription of endo--β-glucanase genes between barley and maize. transcript patterns between other orthologues of maize and barley are not necessarily similar, which may be due to dissimilarity between the tissues compared for these two species or to some drift in activity of these genes since separation of the common ancestors of the two species.

the six orthologues just discussed are from the gh9a, gh9b <dig> and gh9b <dig> subfamilies of genes and are interesting for several reasons. in the phylogenetic analysis of the endo--β-glucanase gene family, gh9a and gh9b <dig> appear to be derived from the same ancestral gene although categorized into different sub-families on the basis of protein domain structure. furthermore, the gh9a sub-family, also referred to as korrigan, is reported to be associated with cellulose production  <cit> . in the cereals examined here, the gh9b <dig> clade has expanded from one gene to four in maize, or five genes in sorghum and rice. this expansion has occurred after the separation of cereals from the dicots, with only one equivalent orthologue in arabidopsis. high levels of transcription of five of the six genes in barley and maize stem tissues supports speculation that these genes are involved in cellulose and/or cell wall synthesis, adding to the co-transcription evidence of genes involved in cell elongation, cell wall modification and cellulose synthesis.

the role of endo--β-glucanases in cell wall synthesis or re-modelling was explored in the context of co-transcription with other genes known to have involvement in cell wall metabolism. there is evidence from several systems that implicates endo--β-glucanases in cellulose biosynthesis  <cit> . it has been variously suggested that the hydrolases remove non-crystalline regions of cellulosic microfibrils or release nascent cellulose chains from the cellulose synthase complex in the plasma membrane, but the precise role of the hydrolytic enzymes in cellulose synthesis has not been defined. here, a very strong relationship was seen between the cellulose synthase gene hvcesa <dig> and the two cellulase genes hvcel <dig> and hvcel <dig>  where a co-transcription correlation coefficient, r <dig>  of  <dig>  was calculated. the hvcel <dig> and hvcesa <dig> genes were also highly co-transcribed at r <dig> =  <dig> . from transcript and mutant plant analysis, hvcesa <dig> is believed to be involved in secondary cell wall cellulose synthesis in barley  <cit> . other genes with known secondary cell wall involvement that were co-transcribed with hvcel <dig>  hvcel <dig> and hvcel <dig> at r <dig> >  <dig> , included the cobra  <dig> gene and the fasciclin-like arabinogalactan protein gene . the cobra gene mutants have been shown to dramatically reduce cell wall thickness and cellulose levels in the walls of rice and maize stems  <cit> . involvement of cobra proteins in secondary cell wall metabolism is highly likely, although the exact nature of its involvement has not been determined. an association of fla genes with tension wood in poplar has been determined with increased transcription and expression during tension wood production  <cit> . tension wood is associated with high levels of cellulose, but is not found in the grasses.

other genes that were co-transcribed with hvcel <dig>  hvcel <dig> and hvcel <dig> included five different glycosyl transferase genes, which are also believed to play a role in cell wall biosynthesis. here, we have named the glycosyl transferase  genes according to the families described by cantarel et al.  <cit>  . they include genes encoding a putative β-glucuronyl transferase , another β-glucuronosyl transferase , a glycosyl transferase , a glucogenic glycosyl transferase  and a putative α-galactosyl transferase . the hvcel <dig> gene showed correlation coefficients of > <dig>  with six expansin genes and with the gene for xyloglucan endotransglycosylase  <dig> , while the hvcel <dig> gene was co-transcribed with the cellulose synthase-like csld <dig> gene .

thus, the hvcel <dig> gene was co-transcribed at r <dig> >  <dig>  with several genes that are associated with cell elongation. the expansin and the xet proteins have been implicated in cell wall loosening. although the expansin family proteins appear to possess no known enzymic activity, their role in wall loosening and cell elongation has been well established for many years  <cit> . moreover, endo--β-glucanases were found to enhance the loosening effect of the expansins  <cit> . the xet enzymes have also been implicated in wall modification by way of hetero-transglycosylation  <cit> . the co-transcription of the hvxet <dig> gene with expansin and hvcel <dig> genes therefore implies a role for the xet in cell wall loosening and cell elongation.

functions of the csld family of genes are not fully characterised, there have been a large number of phenotypes described for csld mutant lines. for example, rice csld mutants have aberrant stem and root tip cell walls  <cit>  and in arabidopsis, a role for csld in tip growing cells has been proposed  <cit> .

because so little is really known of the in planta activity and functions of endo--β-glucanases, it is difficult to do more than speculate on their actual roles in development. the in vitro hydrolytic activities of only a few of these genes in other species are known. while it is clear that gene transcript levels are not necessarily a measure of protein expression, they nevertheless allow us to follow the trail of endo--β-glucanase gene transcripts in maize as the cells of the stem internode divide, elongate, mature and senesce. the endo--β-glucanase, kor <dig>  is located at the cell plate in arabidopsis during cytokinesis and mutations in this gene produce cells with incomplete cell walls  <cit> . in the maize internode, meristematic tissues provide a source of cells undergoing cytokinesis and the orthologue for atkor <dig> in maize is either zmcel <dig> or zmcel <dig>  the mpss data in maize indicate that  <dig> endo--β-glucanases, over one half of the total number of maize endo--β-glucanase genes with a signature tag, are transcribed in the apical or internode meristem  <cit> .

as the cell starts to elongate it can be envisioned that further endo--β-glucanase activity is required to assist in cell wall loosening, since loss of such activity perturbs cell elongation  <cit> . during elongation, cell wall deposition will also be occurring  <cit>  and, in rice, an insertional mutation of the atkor <dig> orthologue osglu <dig> produced a dwarf plant with cells that failed to elongate fully  <cit> . combined data for the maize mpss database and stem tissue series shows  <dig> genes with transcripts in the elongating tissues, seven of which were at significant levels.

the end of elongation is followed by deposition of the secondary cell wall and an increase in cellulose content of the wall  <cit> . at this stage of development, endo--β-glucanases may be part of the cellulose production mechanism, but in vitro activity of the enzymes suggest they may also be involved in cell wall matrix modification, at least in the dicots  <cit> . in maize,  <dig> genes are transcribed in maturing tissues and could be involved in cellulose synthesis, or the modification of matrix phase polysaccharides such as -β-glucans.

in conclusion, the analyses of the endo--β-glucanase gene families from the grasses and the strong correlations observed between individual endo--β-glucanase gene transcript levels suggest that groups of orthologous endo--β-glucanase genes are required for a range of different functions in different tissues. similarly, correlations between the endo--β-glucanase transcripts and transcripts of genes encoding expansins and xets suggest that multiple cell wall-modifying enzymes are required for wall metabolism. through the specific identification of these groups of genes described here, we are now in a position to test hypotheses regarding their functions and joint participation in wall synthesis, re-modelling and degradation. from a more practical point of view, it will now be possible to test their potential role as determinants of stalk strength in maize and other commercially important cereals in attempts to reduce yield losses attributable to lodging  <cit> . it should also be possible to design new protocols and genetically tailored bioenergy crop plants in which enzymic or chemical conversion of lignocellulosic biomass is facilitated during biofuel production.

CONCLUSIONS
cell walls from the grass family are attracting renewed interest from both the private and public research sectors, particularly in the areas of renewable liquid biofuel production and human health. in the former application, lignocellulosic material of cell wall origin is the basis of biomass for second and third generation biofuels production and is commonly sourced from cereal crop residues and specialist high productivity grasses. cellulases, or more correctly endo--β-glucanases, are enzymes that have been implicated in cell wall synthesis, remodelling and degradation in plants. here we have characterized the families of genes that encode these enzymes in several members of the grass family. by examining coordinated expression of groups of the genes we have identified which members of the family are jointly involved in the various functions of the enzymes during cell wall development. in addition, our co-expression analyses have identified genes from other families that are clearly involved in cell wall modification. this broader more detailed understanding of the genetics of cell wall metabolism allows us to devise new approaches to facilitate the conversion to biofuels of lignocellulose material from grasses and cereal crop residues.
