BACKGROUND
the phenylpropanoid pathway is an important branch of the plant secondary metabolism pathways that produces many essential secondary metabolites. in this pathway, secondary metabolic products, such as lignin, flavonoids and coumarins, play important roles in plant growth, development, mechanical support, and disease resistance  <cit> . phenylalanine ammonia-lyase  is the first and key enzyme between primary and secondary metabolism, and it catalyses the biotransformation of l-phenylalanine to trans-cinnamic acid. the synthesis of many secondary metabolites, such as flavonoids, flavonols, anthocyanins, condensed tannins, lignins, coumarins, and ubiquinone occur downstream of the phenylpropanoid pathway,  <cit>  and is controlled by pal. koukol and conn reported the first plant pal in  <dig>  currently, it is known that the pal is widely found in all higher plants, a few fungi, and a single prokaryote, streptomyces, but not animals  <cit> . furthermore, pal shows potential to treat human phenylketonuria, an inborn error of phenylalanine metabolism  <cit> . several studies  <cit>  have shown that the pals from rhodotorula photosynthetic bacteria and monocot plants also utilise tyrosine in addition to phenylalanine; however, the dicot pals only utilise phe efficiently. during the past four decades, many pal genes have been cloned and studied from various plants, such as ginkgo biloba <cit> , ephedra sinica <cit> , oryza sativa <cit> , isatis indigotica <cit> , arabidopsis thaliana <cit> , jatropha curcas <cit> , and lycoris radiate <cit> , and the first crystal structure of a plant pal was determined from parsley   <cit> . pal exists as a small multigene family, consisting of 2– <dig> members; however, some species contain additional member, such as potato   <cit>  and tomato   <cit> . during the evolution of higher plants, the plant pal genes diversified into various functions in each species, such as arabidopsis thaliana <cit> . another important ammonia lyase, histidine ammonia-lyase , is found in prokaryotes and animals and plays roles in the general histidine degradation pathway. the crystal structure of hal from pseudomonas putida revealed its catalytic mechanism of novel polypeptide modification  <cit> . despite large differences in the primary sequence of proteins, pal functions as a tetramer, similar to hal in vivo. presumably, pal developed from hal when fungi and plants diverged from the other kingdoms  <cit> .

nelumbo nucifera   is a perennial aquatic plant with ornamental flowers of medicinal and phylogenetic importance. n. nucifera produces a series of important secondary metabolites, including alkaloids, flavonoids, steroids, triterpenoids, glycosides and polyphenols  <cit> . the n. nucifera secondary metabolites have a wide range of medical functions and also play important roles in the response to environmental stress, such as pathogen attack and ultraviolet damage. for example, it has been reported that benzylisoquinoline alkaloids and flavonoids from the leaves of n. nucifera are a potential candidate for hiv therapy  <cit> . nelumbo has survived since the late cretaceous, along with a number of other relicts, including ginkgo, sequoia, metasequoia, and liriodendron <cit> . it remains to be determined the mechanism by which pal evolution has allowed n. nucifera to adapt to harsh environmental stress. along with the n. nucifera genome project  <cit> , high-throughput sequencing data will provide a foundation for identifying the key genes in metabolic pathways. however, related research for n. nucifera is very limited.

in this study, three intact pal genes in n. nucifera, nnpal <dig>  nnpal <dig> and nnpal <dig> are identified by genome-wide analysis. nnpal <dig> is an ancient pal member in angiosperms. the objective of this study is to determine the evolutionary origin, gene structure, function, and expression patterns of this gene under stress conditions.

RESULTS
genomic identification and exon/intron structure analysis of the pal gene family in n. nucifera
based on whole genome sequences of n. nucifera, data mining using  <dig> arabidopsis thaliana pal homologues, atpal <dig>  atpal <dig>  atpal <dig> and atpal <dig>  as queries identify three intact pal genes, nnpal <dig>  nnpal <dig> and nnpal <dig> . nnpal <dig>  nnpal <dig>  and nnpal <dig> are located on separate virtual chromosomes, vchr <dig>  vchr <dig> and vchr <dig>  respectively. according to the position of the introns, these genes are divided into the following three types: phase  <dig> , phase  <dig>  and phase  <dig> . nnpal <dig> has two introns of phase  <dig>  whereas nnpal <dig> and nnpal <dig> have only one intron of phase  <dig> . in nnpal <dig> and nnpal <dig>  the exon/intron borders are within a conserved arginine codon . the introns of nnpal <dig> and nnpal <dig> are separated by two exons. the first exon of nnpal <dig> encodes  <dig> amino acids, whereas the first exon of nnpal <dig> encodes  <dig> amino acids. however, two introns split nnpal <dig> into three exons, which code for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, respectively . except for nnpal <dig>  the phase  <dig> intron of nnpal <dig> and nnpal <dig> is conserved, similar to other angiosperms during the evolution of angiosperms  <cit> . a phase  <dig> intron in nnpal <dig> indicates that nnpal <dig> has an evolutionary origin different from nnpal <dig> and nnpal <dig> 

using blastp to search the protein database in ncbi, we found that nnpal <dig> is more similar to the pal genes of gymnosperms  than dicots  . this is contrary to the phylogeny of n. nucifera in the plant kingdom  <cit> . however, the deduced nnpal <dig> protein has the same nine strictly conserved residues, y <dig> l <dig> s <dig> n <dig> q <dig> y <dig> r <dig> f <dig>  and q <dig>  that are found in pcpal of petroselinum crispum <cit> . a typical phenylalanine and histidine ammonia-lyase signature  also exists at position 199– <dig> .

evolutionary analysis of nnpal <dig> in n. nucifera
to understand the evolutionary process of nnpal <dig>  we use four pal members, atpal <dig>  atpal <dig>  atpal <dig> and atpal <dig>  from arabidopsis thaliana to query the phytozome database. five monocots and seven dicots that are uniformly distributed in the species tree are selected for analysis . intact pal amino acids sequences from pinus taeda are deduced from their transcripts , and pal sequences from physcomitrella patens  are selected as an outgroup. on the amino acid level, the pal phylogenetic trees are constructed using the ml , nj and bi methods , simultaneously. five different pals from pinus taeda, including pteda <dig>  pteda <dig>  pteda <dig>  pteda <dig> and pteda <dig>  are grouped into three clades as follows: pteda <dig> belongs to gymnosperm i, pteda <dig> and pteda <dig> belong to gymnosperm ii, and pteda <dig> and pteda <dig> belong to gymnosperm iii, reported previously  <cit> . except for nnpal <dig>  the other analysed pals of the dicots and monocots, including nnpal <dig> and nnpal <dig>  are placed in separate monophyletic groups with high bootstrap values of  <dig> for ml and  <dig> for nj and a posterior probability value  <dig>  for bi . as a pal in n. nucifera, the nnpal <dig> gene is clustered together with pteda <dig> and pteda <dig>  with high bootstrap and high probability values . therefore, the pal of angiosperms may not be derived from a single paralogue of a gymnosperm pal. except for nnpal <dig>  the pal clusters from the dicots and monocots are monophyletic after the split between dicots and monocots. this phenomenon suggests that duplication events are an important occurrence during the evolution of the pal gene family after the split between dicots and monocots  <cit> . however, the discovery of nnpal <dig> indicates that a different evolutionary origin may be responsible for the evolution of the angiosperm pal genes.

note: the pal gene family identified from one bryophyta , one gymnosperm , five monocotyledons  and eight dicotyledons .

isolation and bioinformatics characterisation of the full-length nnpal <dig> cdna in n. nucifera
nnpal <dig> has a unique gene structure and phylogenetic position. to determine whether nnpal <dig> became a pseudogene during evolution, isolation of the full-length nnpal <dig> cdna is performed from the transcripts of tender leaves. the partial cdna is obtained by dop-pcr with degenerate primers. a full-length cdna containing an open reading frame of 2151 bp is then produced using 5′-race and 3′-race. using blastn to search the whole genome sequence of n. nucifera, we confirm that the newly cloned ancient pal gene exactly matched the nnpal <dig> sequence.

utilising the expasy tool , the resulting cdna is determined to encode  <dig> amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of  <dig>  kda and a theoretical isoelectric point  of  <dig> . additionally, prosite  is used to identify possible posttranslational modification sites, including eight casein kinase ii phosphorylation sites, ten protein kinase c phosphorylation sites, fifteen n-myristoylation sites, three n-glycosylation sites, two tyrosine kinase phosphorylation sites and one camp- and cgmp-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site. the tmhmm server  <dig>   is used to show that the deduced nnpal <dig> protein is translated and located in the intracellular matrix. the sopma tool  is used to predict the secondary structure of the nnpal <dig> protein, and indicates that nnpal <dig> predominantly consists of alpha helices  and random coils , along with sheets  and beta turns  .

based on the crystal structure of pcpal , the swiss-model software is used to predict the three-dimensional structure of the nnpal <dig> protein. the result indicate that nnpal <dig> comprises an mio domain, core domain and shielding domain  <cit> . moreover, a highly conserved ala-ser-gly triad  <cit>  that can be converted autocatalytically is also identified within nnpal <dig> . the results of the bioinformatics prediction and structural analysis of nnpal <dig> indicate that nnpal <dig> has similar structural features to the reported angiosperm pal proteins.

purification and functional characterisation of recombinant nnpal1
to confirm the expression of nnpal <dig>  the recombinant 6-tagged protein is heterogeneously produced in e. coli bl <dig>  and eluted with a series of imidazole buffers . the size of the expressed and purified recombinant 6-nnpal <dig> protein is confirmed as ~81 kda by sds-page , which is consistent with the predicted mass of nnpal <dig>  combined with a his tag . compared to the production at 4 h and 12 h, the recombinant nnpal <dig>  is expressed maximally at 8 h. the optimal elution concentration of the imidazole buffer is 200 mm. the recombinant nnpal <dig> protein has both pal and tal activities simultaneously, although phenylalanine ammonia-lyase from dicots only utilises phe efficiently  <cit> . a study of the physicochemical properties shows that its optimal ph and temperature are ph  <dig>  and 55°c, respectively. the nnpal <dig> km values for l-phenylalanine and l-tyrosine are  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  mm, respectively.

expression profile of nnpal <dig> under stress conditions
because of the accumulation important secondary metabolites, such as alkaloids and flavonoids, these phenylpropanoid compounds from n. nucifera leaves play essential roles in stress resistance. pal is vital to the phenylpropanoid pathway that leads to the production of these secondary metabolites. the upstream cis-elements of nnpal <dig> , including the related regulatory elements, such as the myb binding site involved in drought-inducibility , auxin-responsive element , fungal elicitor responsive element , cis-acting element involved in abscisic acid responsiveness , and light responsive element  are identified. under different stress conditions, including aba , iaa , ultraviolet light, neurospora crassa  and drought, the expression of nnpal <dig> is induced in n. nucifera leaves . after 4 hours, pal expression is maximal with aba, iaa, ultraviolet light and neurospora crassa , and after 8 hours, pal expression is maximal with drought treatment. we conclude that these corresponding elements perform an important role in the response to internal and external environmental stimulus.

discussion
identification of the pal family in n. nucifera from whole genomic sequences
the genomic dna used for de novo sequencing is extracted from the clean shoots of n. nucifera. we use sixteen assembled virtual chromosomes of high quality as the resource for the pal search. in previous reports of pal from higher plants, all functionally identified pal genes  <cit>  encode approximately  <dig> amino acids and contain the characteristic conserved gtitasgdlvplsyia motif. therefore, we set the sizes of the pal family to larger than  <dig> amino acids with the gtitasgdlvplsyia signature. three pal genes, nnpal <dig>  nnpal <dig> and nnpal <dig>  are located in the well-defined regions of the assembled sequences. consistent with the phylogeny of angiosperms, nnpal <dig> and nnpal <dig> are similar to the pal from dicots. however, nnpal <dig> is similar to the pal from gymnosperms. the full-length cdna of nnpal <dig> is cloned from the rna transcripts of tender leaves using race method. nnpal <dig> is transcribed with an intact open reading frame, suggesting that it does not become a pseudogene during evolution.

nnpal <dig> from the genuine pal family of n. nucifera
n. nucifera is a perennial aquatic plant. therefore, obtaining pure tissues is a prerequisite for molecular biology experiments. an endophyte is a bacterial or fungal microorganism, which colonises inter- and/or intracellularly inside the healthy tissues of the host plant  <cit> . we are careful to remove the residues from both shoots and leaves. to confirm that nnpal <dig> is a member of the pal family of n. nucifera and not endophytes, we performed several experiments.

first, we determine the location of nnpal <dig> in vchr <dig> and extract the upstream sequence  and downstream sequence  flanking nnpal <dig> . then, we performed a discontiguous megablast search against the nucleotide collection database in ncbi to search for homologous regions. in the upstream 1–5000 bps of nnpal <dig>  we find out a highly homologous region to dicots. the sequences with the first three highest scores are uncharacterised mrna from vitis vinifera, the mrna of a tetratricopeptide repeat-containing family protein in populus trichocarpa, and an mrna of a conserved hypothetical protein in ricinus communis. in the downstream  <dig> - <dig>  bps of nnpal <dig>  we find out a homologous partial coding sequence of the gwd gene for alpha-glucan water dikinase from n. nucifera. a homologous region to dicots is also identified in the downstream  <dig> - <dig>  bps. the sequences with the first three highest scores are the mrna of a zinc finger ccch domain-containing protein 17-like in citrus sinensis and the mrna of a zinc finger family protein in populus trichocarpa . as a basal dicot, the flanking sequences of n. nucifera nnpal <dig> show homology to sequences of all the other dicots.

second, the identities between plant pals and hals and the pals of microorganisms and animals are compared. because pal has the same catalytic mechanism as hal, it is hypothesised to have developed from hal when fungi and plants diverged from the other kingdoms. hal is widely distributed among prokaryotes and animals. we extracted the prokaryote and animal hals, and only one prokaryote, streptomyces, and fungal pal from ncbi the database are identified in addition to the plant pal from our study. the identities of plant pal to the prokaryote and animal hal, streptomyces pal, fungal pal, and plant pal are approximately 18%, 18%, 25% and 64%, respectively . the conclusion that there are significant sequence difference among these pals and hals is consistent with a previous report  <cit> . similar to the other plant pals, the sequence of nnpal <dig> is much more similar to other plant pals, and distant from the pals and hals of microorganisms. phylogenetic analysis of hal and pal using the neighbour-joining method demonstrates that they form three separate clades, prokaryote and animal hal, including streptomyces pal, fungal pal, and plant pal . therefore, nnpal <dig> is not from the endophytes. based on these results, we can infer that nnpal <dig> is a genuine member of the pal family from n. nucifera, but not endophytes.

evolution of nnpal <dig> in n. nucifera during the evolution of plants
in this study, three pals, nnpal <dig>  nnpal <dig> and nnpal <dig>  are identified using the database of whole genomic sequences as a resource. in previous reports, the angiosperm pal had phase  <dig> introns at an arg codon of  <cit> , but the gymnosperm pal had no intron  <cit> . similarly, both nnpal <dig> and nnpal <dig> have only one intron of phase  <dig>  whereas nnpal <dig> has two introns of phase  <dig>  this result demonstrates that nnpal <dig> has unique gene structure that is different from nnpal <dig>  nnpal <dig> and other pal genes from angiosperms. this difference between nnpal <dig> and other angiosperm pals suggests that it is an ancient gene with a different evolutionary origin.

pal and hal are members of the lyase class i_like superfamily of enzymes, which catalyse similar beta-elimination reactions and are active as homotetramers. pal and hal diverged from each other when fungi and plants diverged from the other kingdoms . because of their similar structures, pal is derived from the his ammonia-lyase. hal is a basic enzyme, participating in a central metabolic pathway, and pal is derived from hal to fulfil specific functions.

pal is a ubiquitous higher-plant enzyme that catalyses the nonoxidative deamination of phenylalanine to trans-cinnamic acid. however, the origin and evolution of the pal gene family in seed plants  have not been determined  <cit> . currently, two major mechanisms are responsible for the evolution and functional divergence of genes. one evolutionary mechanism is called hgt  and refers to the movement of genes between different species  <cit> . hgt events occur only in plant mitochondrial genes  <cit> , and rarely in nuclear genes  <cit> . the other evolutionary mechanism is gene duplication, which is the main mechanism for evolutionary innovations and functional divergence  <cit> . based on morphological characteristics and molecular data, gymnosperms are considered ancestral to the angiosperms  <cit> . at least three ancestral duplication events of pal occurred, leading to three clades of gymnosperm pal genes, gymnosperm-i, gymnosperm-ii and gymnosperm-iii. it appears that angiosperms diverged from gymnosperm iii when only one paralogue pal gene is retained within the angiosperms  <cit> . in this study, we construct pal phylogenetic trees that include the pal gene families from pinus taeda , monocots and dicots according to the gene sequences of the sequenced species . the phylogenetic trees show that nnpal <dig> is clustered together with pteda <dig> and pteda <dig> ; however, nnpal <dig> and nnpal <dig> are clustered with dicots with high bootstrap and posterior probability values. perhaps, nnpal <dig> has a different evolutionary origin from nnpal <dig> and nnpal <dig>  except for nnpal <dig>  the other pal clusters are monophyletic after the split between dicots and monocots . however, the pal from one species is clustered together with the other species rather than with a single species. this result indicates that duplication events are important in the evolution of pal genes after the split between dicots and monocots  <cit> .

during evolution, nnpal <dig> is found to be an ancient member of the pal family that has been retained in angiosperms. a different evolutionary history for pal genes in angiosperms suggests different mechanisms of functional regulation. in the phylogenetic trees of pal , nnpal <dig> is not found where expected. interestingly, nnpal <dig> shows high homology to pteda <dig> and pteda <dig> from pinus taeda, and pinus taeda is also rich in various secondary metabolites. there may be a shared secondary metabolite produced by nnpal <dig> or pteda <dig> and pteda <dig>  moreover, this specific product may protect n. nucifera and pinus taeda from similarly extreme environments. nnpal <dig> may have been essential for n .nucifera to survive in harsh environments during the cretaceous period.

we speculate that the angiosperm pal is not of monophyletic origin. ancestral gene duplication and vertical inheritance from gymnosperms may occur during evolution from parent to offspring. in gymnosperms another paralogue of the ancient pal exists that is retained prior to the formation of angiosperms. nnpal <dig> may be derived from the product of gymnosperm-ii pal. discovering a functional nnpal <dig> indicates that angiosperm pal genes are not derived from a single gene in the ancestral angiosperm genome. however, similar modification sites and structure to other angiosperm pals suggest that nnpal <dig> can catalyse the deamination of phenylalanine to trans-cinnamic acid and is involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway.

functional characterisation and expression patterns of nnpal1
during evolution, nnpal <dig> remained functional with both pal and tal activities. compared with other pals cloned from other plants  <cit> , both the pal and tal activities of nnpal <dig> show higher km values, which can be explained as follows:  during the evolution of angiosperms, the function of the most ancient pal  is gradually replaced by a new pal;  nnpal <dig> has many posttranslational modification sites, which may be involved in the subunit turnover of nnpal <dig> in vivo <cit> , and prokaryote expression systems lack multiple protein modifications, which affect enzyme protein stability; and  the ancient nnpal <dig> has evolved a novel function required for other metabolic pathways  <cit> . the optimum ph is  <dig>  and the optimum temperature is 55°c, which is similar to other pals from higher plants  <cit> . the expression patterns are validated by real-time pcr. in response to environmental stress during the cretaceous period, n. nucifera is eventually trapped in aquatic areas of asia  <cit> . this type of environment makes secondary metabolites important for n. nucifera because they protect the species from various stimuli. pal expression is regulated by various factors at the transcriptional level. bioinformatics analysis of the upstream cis-elements in nnpal <dig> identified several related regulatory elements, such as the myb binding site involved in drought-inducibility, the auxin-responsive element , the fungal elicitor responsive element, the cis-acting elements involved in abscisic acid responsiveness , and the light responsive element in nnpal <dig> gene. all the treatments used in this study cause increases of the nnpal <dig> transcripts, which suggests that nnpal <dig> is regulated by these elements. the ancient nnpal <dig> of n. nucifera is involved in the response to stressful environments, which makes n. nucifera the representative of plants that survived from the cretaceous period  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
using comparative genomics and phylogenetic analyses, three pal members, nnpal <dig>  nnpal <dig> and nnpal <dig>  are identified. the distinction between nnpal <dig> and other angiosperm pals suggests that nnpal <dig> is not derived from a pal paralogue of a gymnosperm leading to angiosperms. we postulate that there may be another ancestral duplication event and vertical inheritance from the gymnosperms. the ancient pal nnpal <dig> from n. nucifera is characterised at both the rna and protein levels in vitro. the unique biochemical characteristics of n. nucifera may allow it to overcome the harsh environment. additionally, as a basal dicot, n. nucifera is a perennial aquatic plant with agricultural, evolutionary and medicinal importance  <cit> . polyphenolic compounds in n. nucifera have important pharmacological and physiological activities. the discovery and characterisation of an ancient nnpal <dig> provides new insight into pal evolution in angiosperms and may also lead to improved function through the genetic engineering of n. nucifera.
