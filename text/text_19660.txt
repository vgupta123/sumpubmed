BACKGROUND
in eukaryotes micrornas  are single stranded 20– <dig> nucleotide rnas that direct silencing of an mrna target by an rna inducing silencing complex . in plants most mirnas have extensive complementarity to their target mrna and induce its cleavage or translational inhibition. many of the targets encode transcription factors or signalling proteins controlling different steps of plant development. in addition, mirnas have also been identified that respond to nutrient availability or abiotic stress, suggesting an important role in plant adaptive responses. furthermore, by targeting genes encoding proteins of the mirna machinery, they regulate their own biogenesis and function .

mirnas are structurally related to the more abundant short-interfering rnas  but can be clearly distinguished by their biogenesis pathway  <cit> . in arabidopsis, it has been shown that most mirnas are encoded by independent genes transcribed by rna polymerase ii, producing a primary precursor  characterised by a stem-loop structure containing the mirna. genetic analysis has shown that the pri-mirna is processed by the rnase iii dicer-like enzyme  <dig>  to liberate mirna/mirna*  duplexes from the stem structure. the mirnas are selectively loaded into the risc whereas the mirnas* are subjected to degradation  <cit> .

identification of mirnas in different plant species has been based on the cloning of small rna fractions and/or the prediction of mirna genes in genomic sequences based on sequence similarity  <cit> . these approaches have revealed or predicted several hundred mirna genes in arabidopsis, rice and poplar, for which complete genomes are available. all the plant mirnas reported are available in the sanger mirna register  <cit> .

at present in rice there are  <dig> mirnas distributed in  <dig> families  <cit>  reported in the sanger mirbase register  <cit> . among them, only  <dig> families are conserved in arabidopsis and poplar, while the others are specific to monocots or rice. most conserved mirnas are encoded by multigene families producing identical or very similar mirnas with a high level of expression. the conserved mirnas were selected early in evolution and have important functions for plant development or adaptation to the environment  <cit> . the non-conserved mirnas are usually encoded by single loci and have low levels of expression. they appeared more recently in evolution and their function as canonical mirnas has not yet been demonstrated  <cit> .

recently, high-throughput sequencing applied to small rnas in arabidopsis  <cit> , rice  <cit>  and other plant species  <cit>  have greatly increased the number of mirna candidates. these data revealed many new “potential” mirna gene families in the different species but most of them were non-conserved phylogenetically. nevertheless, in the absence of available dcl <dig> mutants or any functional test, some of these novel potential mirnas could be difficult to distinguish from the abundant sirnas that derive from repeated or retroelement sequences or from complementary antisense rnas  <cit> .

in our laboratory we proposed to identify and characterise novel mirnas that control development in rice and monocots. to this aim, we produced four cdna libraries derived from different rice tissues that were sequenced and analysed in silico to identify potential mirna genes. these were then experimentally tested by identification of their precursor mirnas transcripts and dependence of their expression on rice osdcl <dig>  an arabidopsis dcl <dig> homolog in rice which is essential for mirna biogenesis. using these criteria, we have identified six novel mirnas expressed in rice. we predict their mrna targets and, for three of them, demonstrate cleavage at the predicted target site in vivo, suggesting their implication in an organellar function, phosphate homeostasis and regulation of a gt-like transcription factor respectively. finally we provide two examples of genes producing a single precursor encoding two mirnas, indicating that plant mirna precursors have the potential capacity to encode several mirnas and perhaps coordinate their expression.

RESULTS
identification of  <dig> novel rice mirnas
four independent cdna libraries were generated from the 19– <dig> nucleotide small rna fractions extracted from roots, seedlings, panicle and leaves . about  <dig> clones were sequenced from each library, producing overall  <dig>  sequences. the sequences were first "cleaned" to discard rrnas, snornas trnas and chloroplastic rna contaminants. the remaining  <dig> non redundant sequences were aligned using blastn with genomic sequences from oryza sativa ssp. japonica cv nipponbare anotated in tigr version  <dig> of rice genome annotation and subsequently actualised in the igsrp built  <dig> from rice annotation project database rap-db  <cit> . only sequences giving perfect matches to the genome were retained. these were analysed for potential stem-loop structures harbouring the mirna/mirna* duplex that could represent the precursor pre-mirna  <cit> . sequences mapping to highly repeated sequences annotated in rap-db  <cit>  and the retrooryza database for rice retroelements  <cit>  were discarded as they probably represent sirnas  <cit> . we also discarded most sequences matching protein-coding genes as they could represent mrna degradation products. an exception was osa-mir <dig> which is encoded in an orf but whose expression was found to depend on osdcl <dig> . from this analysis we obtained  <dig> putative mirnas mapping to different gene loci. among these,  <dig>  correspond to conserved mirnas previously described in arabidopsis thaliana and/or oryza sativa or are new paralogues of already described families. many of them were cloned multiple times in the different libraries. the most abundant were osa-mir <dig>  encoded by a large multigene family, which was cloned  <dig> times and osa-mir <dig> that we cloned  <dig> times . this is in agreement with the work that used  <dig> pyrosequencing to identify small rnas  <cit>  altogether our results on the conserved mirnas is in good agreement with previous and recent reports on rice mirna distribution and validate our cloning procedure and the quality of our library.

we also cloned three distinct classes of  <dig> nucleotide small rnas derived from predicted stem-loop structures encoding conserved  mirnas. the first category corresponds to osa-mir156h*, osa-mir393b* and osa-mir396d*. the second corresponds to a novel rna that has a  <dig> nucleotide overlap with osa-mir <dig> , highly similar to the situation reported for the osa-mir <dig> family  <cit> . the third case corresponds to osa-mir159a. <dig> , a novel mirna derived from the same precursor encoding osa-mir159a. <dig> 

in addition to osa-mir159a. <dig> we identified five other novel mirna candidates that had not been described in any previous screening . the osa-mir <dig> and osa-mir1428e were cloned twice in the seedling and panicle libraries respectively, while the  <dig> others were cloned only once. only osa-mir827a has an homolog in arabidopsis thaliana, corresponding to ath-mir <dig>  recently identified by high-throughput sequencing  <cit> , but with a two nucleotide mismatch. the other mirnas, with the exception of osa-mir159a. <dig> which is found in maize , seem specific to rice. we did not find homologues in the other monocots but this is not conclusive as complete genomic sequences are not available for the other monocots.

altogether we identified six novel mirna candidates in rice that we named osa-mir <dig> to osa-mir159a. <dig>  while this manuscript was in preparation, high-throughput sequencing also identified osa-mir <dig> but these was not described further  <cit> . we present here a detailed analysis for each of the novel mirna identified.

expression profile of novel mirnas
we analysed the expression profiles of the six novel mirnas by northern blot analysis in different rice tissues . a control for loading is shown with a probe complementary to u <dig> snrna. osa-mir <dig>  osa-mir <dig>  osa-mir827a and osa-mir159a. <dig> were detected in all tissues but with differential accumulation. osa-mir1428e had lowest level of expression and was preferentially expressed in panicles  while osa-mir <dig> was detected only in fertilised panicles.

the mirnas can be distinguished from repeat-associated sirnas, which is the most abundant class of small rnas in plants, by their dependence on dcl <dig> activity for their biogenesis  <cit> . to confirm that these are bona fide mirnas, we analysed their accumulation in seedlings from rice osdcl1ir rnai lines with reduced dcl <dig> activity  <cit> . clearly accumulation of all of them, except for osa-mir <dig>  is drastically reduced in osdcl <dig> ir plants compared to wild type plants . accumulation of osa-mir <dig> could not be checked in the osdcl1ir mutants because these plants produce small panicles, the only stage where osa-mir <dig> is expressed. also in the case of osa-mir1428e this was difficult to assess as this mirna is expressed mainly in panicles, with very little expression in seedlings . overall this analysis confirms that the biogenesis of all our predicted mirnas, except perhaps for osa-mir <dig> that could not be tested, depends on osdcl <dig> as expected for canonical mirnas.

identification and characterisation of mirna precursor transcripts and genes
remarkably, little information has been produced on mirna precursors in rice although this is essential to define a mirna gene and confirm its expression. therefore, we first searched for mirna precursors among the cdna and est libraries available in public databases by alignment of our candidate mirnas against them.

osa-mir <dig>  a canonical mirna gene structure
osa-mir <dig> is encoded by a single locus  producing a  <dig> nucleotide cdna  . this cdna has little coding capacity with the biggest orf predicted to encode a  <dig> amino acid protein with no similarity to any other protein. a stem-loop structure with the mirna/mirna* can be predicted at the 5'end of the cdna . it is highly likely that this long cdna produced by the rice full length cdna consortium  <cit>  corresponds to the primary precursor pri-osa-mir <dig> 

osa-mir1428e, a tandem mirna gene precursor
the cloned osa-mir1428e is encoded by a single locus  on chromosome  <dig> which gives a  <dig> nucleotide mrna  with no protein coding capacity. remarkably, this mrna has two osa-mir <dig> stem-loops in tandem . the cloned sequence corresponds to osa-mir1428e produced from the second stem-loop and differs by one nucleotide from osa-mir1428d .

in addition to the tandem osa-mir1428e locus, we found  <dig> other loci encoding osa-mir <dig> homologs  flanked by highly conserved genomic regions including and extending beyond the predicted stem-loop structures . remarkably none of the additional osa-mir <dig> loci had a tandem osa-mir <dig> stem-loop organisation. the high sequence conservation of these osa-mir <dig> loci suggests that they could be functional. recently three of these loci have been found expressed, encoding osa-mir1428a, osa-mir1428b and osa-mir1428c  <cit> . most of others are located in retroelement-rich regions for which there is no indication of expression, as no cdna or est has been reported from them. the only exception is osa-mir <dig>  which maps to an intron of gene os03g <dig> which gives an mrna  coding for a conserved ubiquitin-carrier protein. remarkably, the host intron for osa-mir <dig>  is  <dig> nucleotides which is much larger than the 150– <dig> nucleotide average for plant introns  <cit> . we do not know whether the intronic osa-mir <dig>  is produced in vivo, as is the case for several intronic mirnas  <cit> . in any case, the cloned osa-mir1428e can be distinguished from all other osa-mir <dig> isoforms by one or two nucleotide differences , clearly indicating that it derives by processing from the osa-mir <dig> tandem mirna precursor.

finally we also identified by blastn analysis a nearly identical tandem osa-mir <dig> gene conserved in oryza sativa ssp indica, another rice subspecies, showing that the osa-mir <dig> tandem mirna gene is conserved and could have an important function in rice .

osa-mir <dig>  a complex genomic organisation
the osa-mir <dig> sequence maps to two genomic loci . the first is in the first exon of gene os09g <dig>  which gives a  <dig> nucleotides cdna . this cdna is predicted to encode a  <dig> amino-acid hypotethical protein with no similarity to any known protein or protein motif. a predicted stem-loop encoding osa-mir2055/osa-mir2055* duplex is found in the orf region .

a nearly identical sequence to the pre-osa-mir <dig> stem-loop is found duplicated in an intergenic region of chromosome  <dig>  with no predicted gene. alignment of these sequences reveals that the pre-osa-mir <dig> stem-loop is part of an inverted duplication in chromosome  <dig> which is conserved in os09g <dig> and the expressed mrna . we used rt-pcr with specific primers to detect expression of the chromosome  <dig> pre-osa-mir <dig> locus in rice seedlings. this revealed the expected rt-pcr amplification product which was confirmed by sequencing . this indicates that the second locus on chromosome  <dig> is transcribed and could also produce osa-mir <dig> 

identification of osa-mir827a and osa-mir <dig> intermediate precursors
osa-mir827a is encoded by a single locus mapping to an intergenic region on chromosome  <dig> . no cdna or est is reported for this genomic region. therefore we used circular rt-pcr   <cit>  to clone a precursor transcript from a total rna fraction extracted from rice leaf tissue . we obtained several clones, all corresponding to a sequence of  <dig> nucleotides that folds into a stem-loop structure . our observation that rice mirna precursors are encoded by large transcripts suggests that the cloned sequence represents an intermediate precursor corresponding to pre-osa-mir827a. we were nevertheless unable to clone a larger product by crt-pcr, perhaps due to rapid processing or to a low level of accumulation of pri-mirna produced from this gene.

we confirmed that the genomic predicted stem-loop region including the cloned pre-osa-mir827a is processed to mature osa-mir827a by transient expression of arabidopsis mirna precursors in nicotiana benthamiana rdr6ir lines   <cit> . expression in rdr <dig> ir line plants is necessary to reduce production of sirnas from transfected stem-loop regions. we adapted this assay to express rice pre-mirna using the pcubi:nos expression vector that drives transgene expression from a maize ubiquitin promoter which is constitutively expressed both in dicotylodenous and monocotyledonous plants  <cit> . thus this construct could subsequently be used to transient overexpression of the rice mirna. first we verified that a canonical rice mir164a precursor was expressed in nicotiana benthamiana leaves, producing mir <dig> that could be detected by northern blot with a specific probe while no signal was detected using probes complementary to other regions of the stem-loop pre-mir <dig> .

we then used this assay to test whether the  <dig> base pair genomic region encompassing the cloned pre-osa-mir827a sequence could be processed into osa-mir827a and detected using a probe complementary to osa-mir827a. clearly the result shows that a specific signal of  <dig> nucleotides is detected in the transfected leaves, which is absent in leaves transfected with an empty vector . this confirms that osa-mir827a is produced from this genomic locus in vivo.

the osa-mir <dig> sequence maps to a single locus in an intergenic region between two distant genes . no cdna or est has been reported for this locus. again we used crt-pcr to clone the pre-osa-mir <dig> from rna fraction extracted from rice mature panicles. the cloned pre-osa-mir <dig> is  <dig> nucleotides long and perfectly folds into a predicted stem-loop . probably, this represents one of the last steps of processing from a pri-osa-mir <dig> precursor, as for pre-osa-mir827a. using the agroinfiltration assay in nicotiana benthamiana, we confirmed that the  <dig> base pair genomic fragment including the cloned pre-osa-mir <dig> is sufficient to produce osa-mir <dig> .

osa-mir159a. <dig>  a single precursor can produce two distinct mirnas
the osa-mir159a. <dig> sequence maps to a single locus in gene os01g <dig> encoding the conserved osa-mir159a. <dig>  this gene produces a  <dig> mrna , probably corresponding to the primary pri-mir159a. <dig>  the osa-mir159a. <dig> is found in the stem-loop region encoding osa-mir159a. <dig> but is  <dig> nucleotides upstream and it has a totally different sequence .

in rice the conserved osa-mir159a. <dig> is part of a multigenic family including six members. alignment shows that the osa-mir159a. <dig> sequence has perfect match only with the osa-mir159a. <dig> gene hairpin locus and can be distinguished from all other osa-mir <dig> genes by two or three nucleotide differences . northern blot analysis reveals that osa-mir159a. <dig> has the same pattern of expression as osa-mir159a. <dig> and accumulates to a comparable level . indeed the expression level of osa-mir159a. <dig> detected by northern blot is over-evaluated as the anti-sense mir159a. <dig> probe probably cross-hybridises with other members of this family. finally, as expected for mirnas, osa-mir159a. <dig> accumulation in rice depends on osdcl <dig> .

next we confirmed that the stem-loop region including osa-mir159a. <dig> could be processed to produce osa-mir159a. <dig> in planta  using the agro-inoculation assay previously described . to this aim nicotiana benthamiana leaves were transfected with a construct expressing a  <dig> nucleotide genomic sequence encompassing the stem-loop encoding both osa-mir159a. <dig> and osa-mir159a. <dig>  northern blot analysis with a mir159a. <dig> complementary probe clearly detected a stronger signal than that detected in leaves transfected with an empty vector . the positive signal detected for osa-mir159a. <dig> in control leaves is probably due to cross-hybridisation of the probe with endogenous nicotiana mir <dig> which is conserved in plants. these results indicate that rice osa-mir159a. <dig> is processed from a stem-loop precursor in the nicotiana leaves.

the osa-mir159a. <dig> complementary probe clearly detected a strong signal of  <dig> nucleotides in infiltrated leaves, which is much stronger than the background detected in leaves transfected with an empty vector . an additional signal of  <dig> nucleotides was also detected with this probe that was not detected using the osa-mir159a. <dig> probe  or when expressing other pre-mirnas . considering that this  <dig> nucleotide rna is normally not detected in rice plants  this could suggest that processing of the osa-mir159a. <dig> precursor to produce osa-mir159a. <dig> is not accurate in a heterogeneous system or could implicate another dicer distinct from dcl <dig> under our conditions, in which this stem-loop is overexpressed in nicotiana benthamiana leaves.

to further support that osa-mir159a. <dig> has a functional importance for rice we searched for osa-mir159a.2-osa-mir159a. <dig> tandem structures conserved in more distant oryza species with different genome types  <cit> . because complete genomic sequences for these oryza species are not available, we aligned by blastn the osa-mir159a. <dig> precursor with bac ends sequences from  <dig> oryza species available in omap . this produced the homolog sequences for oryza coarctata with hhkk genome and a partial sequence for oryza ridleyi with hhjj genome. the additional species, oryza officinalis with cc genome, oryza alta and oryza grandiglumis both with ccdd genomes, were amplified by pcr from genomic dna using primers designed from conserved sequences in the osa-mir159a. <dig> precursor . these fragments were cloned and sequenced. the results clearly show that, as for oryza sativa, that has an aa genome, all have retained a perfect osa-mir159a. <dig> sequence just upstream from the conserved osa-mir159a. <dig>  producing conserved stem-loop structures .

we looked for osa-mir159a. <dig> conservation in other monocots. although mirna precursor sequences show high divergence except for mirnas and mirnas* regions, we found a predicted homolog for osa-mir159a. <dig> with  <dig> mismatches in maize located  <dig> nucleotides upstream from the predicted maize mir <dig> . it is important to note that this homology among these two cdna is restricted to the region encompassing the two mirnas. this is clearly shown by dot plot analysis that shows four small diagonal fragments at the 5' end of the cdnas from both maize and rice . the maize sequence folds perfectly into a predicted stem-loop, similar to the rice osa-mir159a.2-mir159a. <dig> stem-loop precursors .

altogether these results indicate that osa-mir159a. <dig> is conserved in all oryza species and in maize, being produced by processing of the osa-mir159a.2-mir159a. <dig> tandem precursor.

target genes
to predict target genes, we carried out a screening considering basic criteria reported for mirna:mrna target functional interactions defined in plants as indicated in methods  <cit> .

for osa-mir <dig>  we found numerous predicted mrnas targets, which all encode ppr proteins . these are rna binding proteins characterised by pentatricopeptide motifs and most are addressed to mitochondria or chloroplast in plants  <cit> . we confirmed cleavage of one ppr mrna target  in rice seedlings in vivo by 5'race. in addition, two other ppr predicted targets of osa-mir <dig> were also recently validated by lu et al  <cit> . the other ppr mrna predicted targets show perfect alignment with these three validated target genes at the osa-mir <dig> recognition sites and are therefore also potential targets for osa-mir <dig> cleavage . we note that the five target genes are clustered in a  <dig> kilobase region on chromosome  <dig> . a similar situation is observed for the target ppr genes predicted on chromosome  <dig>  in which  <dig> out of  <dig> targets are clustered in a  <dig> kilobase region .

the osa-mir827a has two predicted targets encoding two distinct proteins characterised by an spx domain. this domain is associated with proteins that have been implicated in transport or sensing of phosphate or nitrogen in arabidopsis  <cit> . we confirmed by 5'race cleavage of the 5'utr of the mrna corresponding to the best candidate target encoded by os04g <dig> .

the osa-mir159a. <dig> is predicted to target os03g <dig> that encodes a gt- <dig> like transcription factor and os10g <dig> which encodes a hypothetical protein with significant similarity to gt-like transcription factors . both genes are expressed, as revealed by corresponding cdnas in databanks. we carried out 5'race analysis to test for cleavage of the gt- <dig> like transcription factor mrna in vivo and confirmed it by mapping on the predicted mirna complementary site .

the osa-mir1428e, osa-mir <dig> and osa-mir <dig> are predicted to target genes with different functions . these predicted targets are all expressed, as demonstrated by the existence of corresponding cdnas or ests in databanks. we could not validate cleavage of predicted targets for osa-mir1428e, osa-mir <dig> and osa-mir <dig> by 5'race. indeed, this is a common observation for most non-conserved mirnas, as previously reported by others in arabidopsis  <cit>  and rice  <cit> . this could be due to a very low level of expression of the targets or the instability of the cleaved product. for instance the osa-mir1428e target, os03g <dig>  which encodes a predicted protein kinase , is expressed but its expression level is very low as revealed by mpss signatures corresponding to these genes  <cit> . a similar situation is observed for osa-mir <dig>  predicted to target os04g <dig> which encodes a protein of unknown function. notably mpss data reveal expression of this gene mainly in ovaries and mature stigmata  <cit> , in agreement with the specific expression of osa-mir <dig> in panicles .

discussion
identifying novel mirnas
using a classical protocol for cloning and sequencing cdna libraries derived from small rna fractions we identified  <dig> novel mirnas in rice. these  <dig> novel candidates were selected after a stringent analysis of many thousands of sequences paying particular attention to their precursor rnas and genomic organisation. expression of five of them was shown to be dependent on osdcl <dig>  while the expression of osa-mir <dig> could not be tested in osdcl1ir mutants .

several remarks can be made on our study compared with previous work, including two recent reports using high-throughput sequencing to identify rice small rnas  <cit> . the first is that our cloning procedure is qualitatively comparable to high throughput sequencing approaches, as we cloned nearly all abundant mirna species representing conserved mirna families previously described in arabidopsis, rice or other plant species. the most abundant species in our libraries were osa-mir <dig> and mir <dig> that we cloned  <dig> and  <dig> times respectively . this is in agreement with a recent report using  <dig> pyrosequencing to identify small rnas in rice  <cit>  and differs from mpss high-throughput sequencing that identified osa-mir <dig> as the most abundant mirna in their libraries  <cit> .

remarkably osa-mir827a, a rice mirna homolog to ath-mir <dig>  had escaped identification by high-throughput sequencing in rice  <cit> . a simple hypothesis is that some conserved mirnas have low levels of expression which, coupled to a limiting cloning step cannot be compensated by high-throughput sequencing. overall this work suggests that novel mirnas, even conserved, should be still identified and expressed in plants under different biological or environmental conditions. we note that an osa-mir <dig> has been predicted that has  <dig> mismatches with ath-mir <dig>  <cit> . in fact this predicted mirna maps in a repeated cacta transposable element . moreover it is predicted to target an mrna encoding a sec <dig> cytosolic factor  <cit>  while both osa-mir827a and ath-mir <dig> target an mrna encoding an spx protein.

a different situation occurs for the non-conserved mirnas. a few of them which are abundant are regularly cloned, such as osa-mir <dig> or osa-mir <dig>  that we also cloned. nevertheless, most of them have a low level of expression and are rarely cloned in more than one library  <cit> . this makes it very difficult to distinguish these non-conserved mirna from sirnas that derive from repeated sequences or perfect hairpin structures found in retrosequences. thus, although we found many candidates fulfilling the mirnas structural criteria, we retained only those that we could detect by northern and whose expression is dependent on osdcl <dig>  the exception was osa-mir <dig> for which we could not test osdcl <dig> dependence because it is only expressed in panicles, which are extremely reduced in osdcl <dig> ir panicles. indeed, we believe that a definition of novel mirna genes will require a deep genomic analysis coupled to identification of precursor mirnas as reported here.

the rice mirna precursors are large transcripts and can encode multiple mirnas
an important contribution of this work is the identification of precursors for each of the rice predicted mirnas coupled to a fine analysis on their genomic organisation. indeed, studies on plant mirna precursors are limited and mainly restricted to a few examples in arabidopsis  <cit> . here we present potential primary precursors for osa-mir <dig>  osa-mir1428e, osa-mir <dig> and osa-mir159a. <dig> which correspond to long cdnas reported by the rice full length cdna consortium  <cit> . we did not find any reported cdnas or ests for osa-mir827a and osa-mir <dig>  we believe this is due to low levels of these mirnas coupled to the rapid processing of pri-mirna. intermediate pre-mirna species seems most stable as we could clone them for osa-mir827a and osa-mir <dig> by circular rt-pcr.

in flowering plants several mirna gene clusters have been reported but most correspond to clusters producing independent transcripts encoding a single mirnas  <cit> . the large precursors encoding plant mirnas have the potential to encode multiple mirnas, either identical or different. tandem mirna precursors are common in animals and chlamydomonas  <cit>  but are rare in moss  <cit> . in flowering plants only a few cases of tandem mirnas expressed within a common precursor have been described in detail. these correspond to mir <dig> and mir <dig> in rice and maize  <cit>  and mir <dig> in medicago truncatula  <cit> . these clusters encode similar isoforms from conserved mirnas. more recently, five tandem mirna precursor were reported in soybean  <cit> . here we provide two new examples of mirnas gene clusters in rice representing two different cases of precursors encoding tandem mirnas.

the first corresponds to the os03g <dig> gene which gives a large precursor encoding tandem copies of osa-mir1428e and osa-mir1428d stem-loop structures . we also identified a nearly identical tandem osa-mir <dig> gene in oryza sativa sp indica showing that this tandem mirna gene has been conserved in other rice subspecies . thus the osa-mir1428e/d gene is a fourth example in flowering plants producing a tandemly arrayed mirna precursor but for the first time it concerns a non-conserved mirna.

the functional significance for expressing tandem array of similar mirnas is not clear, but it has been shown for the rice/maize mir <dig> and the medicago mir <dig>  in the case of the rice osa-mir <dig> is encoded by  <dig> loci, but only one of them encodes a tandem mir156b-156c precursor  <cit> . this tandem array is functionally important as in maize over-expression of a tandem mir <dig> gene produces the corngrass <dig> heterochronic mutant  <cit> . in the case of the tandem mir <dig> gene in medicago truncatula it was shown that it is important for the control of root architecture  <cit> .

in the previous examples identical mirnas were produced from tandem stem-loop structures in a single precursor. the osa-mir159a. <dig>  which is produced from the same stem-loop encoding osa-mir159a. <dig>  represents a different case. in contrast to frequent cases of small rnas derived from the same precursor encoding the canonical mirnas that are usually interpreted as slippage of imperfect dcl <dig> processing  <cit> , osa-mir159a. <dig> is  <dig> nucleotides from osa-mir159a. <dig> and has a complete different mirna mature sequence. the existence of a functional osa-mir159a. <dig> produced from the osa-mir159a. <dig> precursor is further strengthened by the perfect phylogenetic conservation of the osa-mir159a.2-osa-mir159a. <dig> duplex in distant oryza species and in maize . finally, the transient expression of the osa-mir159a. <dig> stem-loop clearly indicated production of osa-mir159a. <dig> in agro-infiltrated leaves of nicotiana benthamiana. these observations, coupled to the observation that its predicted target is cleaved in vivo  strongly support our hypothesis that osa-mir159a. <dig> produced from osa-mir159a. <dig> precursor is a functional mirna.

osa-mir159a. <dig> should not be a unique case and there should be other examples in plants of genes encoding two or more functional mirnas located in the same stem-loop region. a hint of this situation has already been observed in arabidopsis and soybean for a few mirnas  <cit> . expression of these mirna tandem arrays could represent a mechanism to coordinate the production of various distinct mirnas to cleave their distinct mrna targets in the same temporal or developmental stage or tissue. it would be particularly interesting to assess this hypothesis and elucidate the mechanisms involved in the regulation and processing of this stem-loop to generate two mirnas.

the functional role of the predicted mirnas
we confirmed cleavage of predicted targets at the mirna complementary sites for osa-mir <dig>  osa-mir827a and osa-mir159a. <dig> by 5' race.

notably osa-mir <dig>  corresponding to recently found mirnas by high-throughput sequencing  <cit> , is predicted to target at least  <dig> genes all encoding ppr proteins. we confirmed cleavage of one of the ppr targets, while cleavage of two other predicted ppr targets was confirmed by others  <cit> . the ppr are rna binding proteins characterised by pentatricopeptide motifs and represent one of the largest families in plants including  <dig> genes in arabidopsis and  <dig> in rice  <cit> . this enormous expansion of ppr genes is specific to plants, as in other eukaryotes ppr are encoded by  <dig> to  <dig> genes  <cit> . in plants, most of them are targeted to mitochondria or chloroplasts and have been shown to control virtually all steps of organellar gene expression  <cit> . the three validated targets plus the  <dig> other predicted ppr targets of osa-mir <dig>  represent a minor fraction of the  <dig> rice ppr genes but these genes are clustered on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  this could be reflected by specific events of duplication unique to this small subset of ppr genes targeted by osa-mir <dig>  in any case osa-mir <dig> would be the first example in eukaryotes of an mirna controlling organellar biogenesis. it is tantalising to imagine that by altering osa-mir <dig> levels in rice one could identify the rna targets of the ppr proteins, most of which have as yet unknown roles  <cit> .

a distinct case is observed for osa-mir827a. this mirna is the homolog of recently reported ath-mir <dig> but differs by two nucleotides  <cit> . significantly, both the rice and arabidopsis mir <dig> are predicted to direct cleavage of mrnas encoding proteins with an spx motif. we confirmed cleavage of one of the predicted target at the mirna complementary site in the 5'utr by 5'race. it has also been shown that the predicted spx target of ath-mir <dig> is cleaved in vivo at the predicted mirna complementary site  <cit> . spx domains are found in proteins associated with nutrient transport. in arabidopsis they have been found respectively in proteins encoded by pho and nla genes controlling adaptation to phosphate  <cit>  and nitrogen  <cit> . these data strongly suggest a role of osa-mir827a and ath-mir <dig> in the response of rice and arabidopsis to phosphate or nutrient availability.

we also detected cleavage of osa-mir159a. <dig>  whose predicted target encodes a gt2-like transcription factor. previously other groups had reported small rnas produced from stem-loops encoding canonical mirnas in arabidopsis. nevertheless, no target cleavage could be shown for any of them and they are probably products of dcl <dig> slippage during processing of the precursor  <cit> . therefore, this is a very important result that strongly supports a functional role for osa-mir159a. <dig>  produced from the same stem-loop structure encoding osa-mir159a. <dig>  interestingly, the second target predicted for osa-mir159a. <dig> is also related to gt-like transcription factors, in agreement with the observation that some mirnas target transcription factors from the same family  <cit> . this also supports the hypothesis that osa-mir159a. <dig> is a functional mirna rather than a by-product of dcl <dig> slippage. our results suggest a possible significance of co-regulation of tcp and/or myb genes and gt2-like factors that are targeted by osa-mir159a. <dig> and osa-mir159a. <dig>  respectively, in rice.

for osa-mir1428e, osa-mir <dig> and osa-mir <dig> we could not detect any 5'race product to confirm cleavage of the predicted target. the lack of cleavage for predicted targets for most reported non-conserved mirnas is a common observation. this could be due to low levels of expression of mrna targets, as is the case for osa-mir1428a targets as evaluated by mpss analysis, or to instability of the cleaved product. an alternative explanation is that some of these mirna do not direct cleavage of the target but rather control its translation, as recently shown for some plant mirnas  <cit>  or its expression at another level, for instance at the transcriptional level or by controlling alternative splicing, as shown for some mirnas in animals  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
overall, we have provided compelling evidence for  <dig> novel mirnas in rice, strongly supported by their dependence on osdcl <dig>  an important point in this analysis is the identification of long pri-mirna precursors coupled to fine genomic analysis to screen the small rna sequences. this analysis, even if restricted to a small number of novel candidates, reveals great diversity in mirna genomic organisation in plants, to which should be added the intronic mirnas  <cit>  which have not been discussed here. most importantly, we show two distinct cases of single precursors encoding tandem mirnas. our analysis suggest diverse mode of the regulation of expression of mirna genes and the processing of their mirna precursors that could be important to coordinate with mrna target cleavage and on which we know very little in rice and even in other plants.
