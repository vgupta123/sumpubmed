BACKGROUND
in eukaryotic cells, the basic cellular functions occurring inside the nucleus, like transcription or dna replication, require the transport of proteins across the nuclear envelope. the nucleocytoplasmic transport of most proteins is an energy-dependent process requiring the participation of the transport receptors of the β-karyopherin family  <cit> . β-karyopherins specifically recognize the nuclear localization signals  or the nuclear export signals  in cargos to carry them through the nuclear pore complex. the binding and release of cargo proteins by karyopherins is controlled by the gtpase ran cycle  <cit> . in the import process, karyopherins bind the cargo in the cytoplasm and, once translocated into the nucleus, the binding of ran-gtp destabilizes the complex releasing the cargo. in the export process, the binding of the cargo by the karyopherins in the nucleus is stabilized by ran-gtp and, once in the cytoplasm, hydrolysis of gtp to gdp triggers the dissociation of the cargo.

the most prevalent import pathway is the classical import pathway. this pathway transports those proteins carrying classical nuclear localization signals  <cit> . these signals consist in either a short cluster of basic amino acids  or two short clusters of basic amino acids separated by 10- <dig> residues . s. cerevisiae kap <dig>  is the β-karyopherin involved in the nuclear import of proteins with classical nls. however, kap <dig> is unable to bind the cargo protein directly, but requires an adaptor protein, srp <dig> or importin α, to recognize the classical nls  <cit> . cse <dig>  another β-karyopherin involved in the classical import pathway, is needed to recycle srp <dig> to the cytoplasm once the complex kap95-srp1-cargo has been dissociated in the nucleus  <cit> . the kap <dig>  srp <dig> and cse <dig> genes are essential for cell viability. a mutation in the srp <dig> gene arrests cells at the g2/m phase of the cell cycle  <cit> . this indicates that the classical import pathway plays an essential role in cell cycle progression in mitosis.

a major control point in cell cycle progression in eukaryotic cells occurs at the end of the g <dig> phase in a process called start in saccharomyces cerevisiae. in start, yeast cells decide whether or not to initiate a new cell cycle depending on external  and internal  cues  <cit> . execution of start consists in the activation of a transcriptional program that implies the coordinated expression of a large number of genes  <cit> . a lot of those genes codify for the proteins involved in the events of budding, spindle pole body duplication and dna replication; that is, the events that are activated at this initial step of the cell cycle.

the gene expression at start depends on two transcription factors: sbf and mbf  <cit> . both factors are heterodimeric complexes formed by a common regulatory subunit, swi <dig>  and two different dna binding proteins, swi <dig> for sbf and mbp <dig> for mbf. sbf and mbf show a certain degree of redundancy  <cit> . despite this, the sbf- and mbf-depending genes can be clustered into functional categories: the expression of growth, morphogenesis and spindle pole body-related genes, as well as cln <dig> and cln <dig> cyclin genes, depend mainly on sbf, while those genes involved in the control and execution of dna replication and repair, including the clb <dig> and clb <dig> cyclin genes, are transcribed by mbf. sbf and mbf bind target promoters at the beginning of g <dig>  <cit> , but the gene expression is restrained by the association of transcriptional repressor whi <dig>  <cit> . at the end of g <dig>  the cyclin-dependent kinase cdc28-cln <dig> enters the nucleus  <cit>  and phosphorylates whi <dig>  sbf and mbf, thus promoting the dissociation of the repressor and transcriptional activation  <cit> . as a result, kinases cdc28-cln <dig> and cdc28-cln <dig> accumulate and act on whi <dig>  sbf and mbf to establish a positive feedback loop that is important for the proper execution of start  <cit> . later in the cell cycle, this transcriptional wave is inactivated by the phosphorylation of sbf by kinase cdc28-clb <dig>  <cit>  and the association of repressor nmr <dig> to mbf  <cit> .

spatial regulation adds a new step to the control of the protein function. with regards to transcription factors, this spatial regulation necessarily implies a nuclear import mechanism and, in some cases, an export mechanism that could contribute to the control of transcription factor activity. as regards start transcription factors, swi <dig> shows a constant nuclear localization in all the cell cycle stages  <cit> . however, swi <dig> and whi <dig> shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm along the cell cycle: they are nuclear from the end of mitosis to the s-g <dig> phases in the case of swi <dig>  <cit>  or to start in the case of whi <dig>  <cit> . localization of swi <dig> is controlled by an import mechanism mediated by a classical nls  <cit>  and an export mechanism that depends on karyopherin msn <dig>  <cit> . changes in swi <dig> localization are basically due to the cell cycle regulation of its nuclear import: phosphorylation of ser <dig> by cdc28-clb <dig> blocks the nuclear import during the s-g <dig> phases until the end of mitosis when the cdc <dig> phosphatase removes the phosphate group to once again allow the nuclear accumulation of the protein  <cit> . localization of whi <dig> is controlled by an import mechanism mediated by two functionally redundant classical nls recognized by karyopherin kap <dig> and an export mechanism that depends on karyopherin msn <dig>  <cit> . conversely with swi <dig>  the nuclear import of whi <dig> is not cell cycle-regulated, and changes in localization are due to a regulated nuclear export: multiple phosphorylation of specific residues drives the export until this phosphorylation is reverted by the cdc <dig> phosphatase at the end of mitosis  <cit> .

in this work we studied the role of kap <dig> in cell cycle progression. we show that inactivation of kap <dig> arrests cells at two critical cell cycle points: g2/m transition and g1/s transition. the sbf and mbf subunits swi <dig>  swi <dig> and mbp <dig> are delocalized in kap <dig> cells. as previously shown for swi <dig>  srp <dig> is also required for the nuclear localization of swi <dig> and mbp <dig>  thus, the classical nuclear import pathway plays a key role in the control of start regulators.

RESULTS
kap <dig> is involved in the start transition of the cell cycle
the classical nuclear import pathway is essential for cellular functions since the inactivation of any of its components results in loss of cell viability. studies with an srp <dig> mutant strain showed that mutant cells arrested at the g2/m transition, which indicates that this pathway plays an essential role at the beginning of mitosis  <cit> . by considering the important role of the classical nuclear import pathway, we wondered whether its inactivation would affect the regulation of other cell cycle stages. kap <dig> is an essential gene. in order to investigate its function, we constructed a conditional mutant strain that expresses the kap <dig> gene under the control of the doxycycline-regulated teto <dig> promoter. as expected, cells were unviable in ypd containing  <dig> μg/ml doxycyclyne . in a first attempt to characterize the function of kap <dig>  doxycycline was added to exponentially growing teto 7:kap <dig> cells and their terminal phenotype was analyzed after  <dig> hours. cell morphology revealed the presence of two populations of cells: approximately 80% of cells presented a large bud whose size was similar to the mother cell; the remaining 20% of cells had no bud . in agreement with this morphology, the flow cytometry analysis of dna content showed a major 2n peak and a minor 1n peak in the doxycycline-treated teto 7:kap <dig> cells. importantly, inactivation of kap <dig> caused a defect blocking entry into the s phase, as deduced from the marked decrease in the valley between the two discrete dna peaks . finally, we analyzed the nuclear morphology in the absence of kap <dig>  as expected, dapi staining revealed that kap <dig> unbudded cells contained a single nucleus . as regards cells with a large bud, conversely to what was observed in the wild-type cultures, most  of the kap <dig> large budded cells showed a single nucleus, and only 20% of them contained two nuclei. this result indicates a defect in mitosis in the kap <dig> mutant. it is noteworthy that the nucleus in kap <dig> cells is sometimes displaced from the bud neck and that approximately 8% of large budded cells segregate the dna inside the mother cells, which suggests a defect in nucleus positioning.

in conclusion, all these observations indicate that the inactivation of kap <dig> causes a double arrest in cell cycle progression. most cells accumulate with a large bud, duplicated dna and a single nucleus, indicating that the absence of kap <dig> generates a major arrest in the g2-m transition. this is in agreement with the results previously reported for the mutants in the other karyopherins of the classical import pathway  <cit> . it is noticeable, however, that a minor yet significant number of kap <dig> cells  accumulated as unbudded cells with unreplicated dna and a single nucleus, indicating a g <dig> arrest.

in order to further characterize the defect in executing start in the absence of kap <dig>  cells were synchronized at the telophase by means of a thermosensitive cdc <dig> mutant allele. after release from the arrest, progression through start was monitored by the occurrence of rebudding . as it can be observed in figure 1d, in the case of the control strain, the rebudded cells accumulated  <dig> min after release from the arrest, representing approximately 80% of the total cells after  <dig> min. conversely, kap <dig> mutant cells failed to rebud after the release, even after  <dig> min. this was not due to a defect in the recovery from telophase arrest since, unlike what was observed with the telophase-arrested cells, digestion of the cell wall with zymoliase rendered most cells unbudded . thus, the lack of rebudding indeed reflects the inability to progress through start in the absence of kap <dig> 

it is important to note that a similar result to that described for the teto 7:kap <dig> mutant strain was obtained with a teto 7:cse <dig> mutant strain , indicating that the start defect is not a specific phenotype of kap <dig> inactivation, but must relate to the complete classical import pathway function. the arrest at the g1/s transition is a novel phenotype for the mutants in this pathway and demonstrates a role of the classical nuclear import pathway in the start transition.

start transcription is impaired in the absence of kap95
at the heart of start there is a transcriptional program mediated by the sbf and mbf transcription factors whose activation is required for cell cycle initiation. we envisaged the possibility of the g1/s arrest observed in the kap <dig> mutant being due to a defect in the activation of the start gene expression, a process that necessarily involves the nuclear import of proteins. to test this possibility, the expression of a sbf-regulated gene, cln <dig>  and a mbf-regulated gene, rnr <dig>  was analyzed by northern analysis. after the inactivation of the kap <dig> gene, expression of both cln <dig> and rnr <dig> was absent . start transcription was also analyzed in cdc15-synchronized cultures. whereas in cdc <dig> control cells cln <dig> and rnr <dig> transcripts were detected  <dig> minutes after release from the arrest, cdc15kap <dig> cells failed to activate cln <dig> and rnr <dig> gene expression even  <dig> minutes after the release . these results confirm that kap <dig> cells do not activate the start transcriptional program.

it is known that the ectopic expression of cln <dig> suppresses the lethality of the mutant strains in the start transcriptional program. when a plasmid expressing cln <dig> under the control of the s. pombe adh <dig> promoter was introduced into the teto 7:kap <dig> mutant strain, the percentage of g <dig> cells significantly lowered: 24% compared to 38% for the control plasmid . this suggests that the defect in start transcription contributes to the blockage of kap <dig> mutant cells at g <dig>  however, many g <dig> cells are still present, which suggest that other functions involved in the g1/s transition are still affected. a similar result was obtained in synchronized cdc <dig> teto 7:kap <dig> cultures. as it can be observed in figure 2d, the ectopic expression of cln <dig> caused a significant increase in the percentage of rebudded cells  <dig> minutes after the release from the arrest; however, most of the cells were still unable to initiate a new cell cycle. in conclusion, these results indicate that the impaired start gene expression contributes to the blockage of kap <dig> mutant cells at g <dig> but that other affected functions in addition to the transcriptional program cause the defect in cell cycle progression through the g1/s transition.

role of kap <dig> in swi <dig> nuclear import
the previous results led us to study the control of the subcellular localization of the transcriptional machinery of start by karyopherin kap <dig>  swi <dig> shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm: it enters the nucleus at the end of mitosis until s-g <dig>  when it relocates to the cytoplasm. swi <dig> nuclear entry depends on a nls whose function is regulated by the phosphorylation state of ser <dig>  <cit> . swi <dig> nls interacts in vitro with srp <dig> and, consistently, swi <dig> accumulates in the cytoplasm in the srp <dig> mutant strain  <cit> . to confirm that swi <dig> enters the nucleus via the classical srp1-kap <dig> pathway, we studied the distribution of swi <dig> in the doxycycline-treated teto:kap <dig> cells by indirect immunofluorescence. since swi <dig> is cytosolic in the g2/m phase, the putative effect of kap <dig> inactivation on swi <dig> localization must be analyzed in the g <dig> population of cells when the transcription factor is normally nuclear. as figure  <dig> illustrates, swi <dig> accumulates in the nucleus of the wild-type g <dig> cells, but is cytosolic in the kap <dig> g <dig> cells. this result demonstrates that the swi <dig> import in g <dig> depends on kap <dig> and, therefore, on a complete classical import pathway.

characterization of swi <dig> nuclear import
swi <dig>  the dna binding subunit of the sbf transcription factor, has been intensely studied. nonetheless, little is known about the control of its subcellular localization. unlike swi <dig>  swi <dig> resides in the nucleus throughout the cell cycle, but neither the karyopherin nor the nls mediating its nuclear import has been identified. in a first approach, we examined the swi <dig> sequence and detected a putative nls between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig>  that fitted the consensus classical nls sequence perfectly . the absence of phosphorylable residues in the nls vicinity suggests that, unlike swi <dig> nls, it would not be regulated, so it would be able to constantly introduce swi <dig> into the nucleus. to test the function of this putative nls, we fused it to four copies of gfp . while the control gfp <dig> protein was located in the cytoplasm, the swi4nls-gfp <dig> chimera showed a nuclear localization throughout the cell cycle, similarly to that observed for the nlssv40-gfp <dig> positive control , which strongly suggests a constant active import of swi <dig>  in addition, the direct mutagenesis of the basic residues in the nls sequence led to a cytosolic distribution of the resulting swi4nlsi-gfp <dig> chimera. these results demonstrate that amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> of swi <dig> constitute a functional nls which is sufficient to introduce a protein into the nucleus.

the high degree of homology between swi <dig> nls and the consensus classical nls suggests that the classical import pathway could import the swi4nls-gfp <dig> protein into the nucleus. to test this dependency, we analyzed the distribution of the swi4nls-gfp <dig> protein in the absence of kap <dig>  as observed in figure 4c, kap <dig> inactivation resulted in a cytoplasmic localization of the chimera, which indicates that kap <dig> may recognize the nls from swi <dig> 

next we examined the role of the identified nls in the nuclear import of swi <dig> by analyzing the effect of its inactivation on swi <dig> localization. as endogenous levels of swi <dig> are difficult to detect by indirect immunofluorescence, we expressed swi <dig> under the control of the gal <dig> promoter to increase the amount of protein. the overexpression of swi <dig> did not alter the localization of the protein, which accumulated in the nucleus of all the cells . nevertheless, inactivation of the described nls resulted in a cytoplasmic localization of swi <dig>  therefore, this nls is necessary to drive the nuclear localization of swi <dig> 

finally, we investigated the localization of swi <dig> in the doxycycline-treated teto:kap <dig> cells. consistently with the previous result, inactivation of kap <dig> caused a homogeneous swi <dig> distribution through the cell . the same result was observed in a mutant strain in the importin α srp <dig> . all the obtained results help establish the mechanism underlining the nuclear localization of swi <dig>  swi <dig> has a unique nls between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig> which is sufficient and necessary for its nuclear import, an import that is mediated by the classical import pathway involving karyopherins kap <dig> and srp <dig>  therefore, swi <dig> is another start regulator whose nuclear localization depends on kap95-srp <dig> activity.

role of kap <dig> in the nuclear import of mbp1
mbp <dig> is the dna binding protein of the start transcription factor mbf. despite being important for start, there is no data about the subcellular localization of mbp <dig>  in a first approach, the cellular distribution of an ha-tagged mbp <dig> protein expressed at the endogenous level was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence to investigate whether the subcellular localization of mbp <dig> changes along the cell cycle. as figure  <dig> depicts, mbp <dig> fluorescence colocalized with the dapi signal in cells in all the cell cycle stages. this result demonstrates that under physiological conditions mbp <dig> is nuclear throughout the cell cycle.

next we studied the karyopherin involved in the nuclear import of mbp <dig>  by considering that mbp <dig> and swi <dig> belong to the same family of transcription factors, and the fact that they share structural similarities, we envisaged the possibility of them possibly entering the nucleus assisted by the same import route. therefore, we analyzed mbp <dig> distribution in a mutant in karyopherin kap <dig>  the immunofluorescence assays show a cytoplasmic accumulation of mbp <dig> when kap <dig> was inactivated, unlike the strong nuclear signal observed in the wild-type cells . this result indicates that mbp <dig> enters the nucleus assisted mainly by the classical import pathway. nevertheless, a faint mbp <dig> nuclear signal was observed in some kap <dig> cells, suggesting that other karyopherins might contribute to the mbp <dig> nuclear import to a lesser extent.

the fact that the nuclear import depends on kap <dig> led us to screen the mbp <dig> protein for the putative classical nls sequences. two putative classical nlss were identified in the n-terminus region of mbp1: a monopartite one  between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig> and a bipartite one  located between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig> . in order to test whether these putative nlss were in fact functional, we fused a fragment of mbp <dig> from amino acids  <dig> to  <dig>  to four copies of gfp. unlike the control gfp <dig> protein, the chimera mbp123-184-gfp <dig> localized in the nucleus , thus demonstrating the existence of at least one functional nls in this region of the mbp <dig> protein. as expected, the mbp123-184-gfp <dig> protein became cytosolic when kap <dig> was inactivated . importantly, the nuclear accumulation of mbp123-184-gfp <dig> in a srp <dig> mutant strain was also eliminated . these results confirm that the nuclear import activity in fragment 23- <dig> of mbp <dig> requires an intact classical import pathway

further characterization of mbp <dig> nls was carried out by a direct mutagenesis of the basic residues in both putative nlss, as indicated in figure 5b. the subcellular localization of the resulting mbp123-184-nls1i-gfp <dig> and mbp123-184-nls2i-gfp <dig> chimeras was analyzed. in both cases, inactivation of a single putative nls did not significantly change the location of the proteins, which were clearly detected in the nucleus. thus, neither of the two putative nlss is essential for the nuclear import of mbp <dig>  importantly, however, when both putative nlss were simultaneously mutated, nuclear localization was avoided and the mbp123-184-nls1i2i-gfp <dig> protein was located mainly in the cytoplasm. these results demonstrate that mbp <dig> contains two functional and redundant nlss, and that either of them is able to mediate the nuclear import of mbp <dig> by srp1-kap <dig> karyopherins.

discussion
two of the first karyopherins to be connected to cell cycle regulation were srp <dig> and cse <dig>  which together with kap <dig>  constitute the classical nuclear import system of proteins. the inactivation of srp <dig>  and to a lesser extent the inactivation of cse <dig>  causes an arrest in cell cycle progression at the g2/m phase  <cit> . consistently, in this work we describe how the inactivation of kap <dig> triggers a blockage at the g2/m transition. however, the inactivation of kap <dig> also originates a previously uncharacterized accumulation of cells in g <dig>  this result could indicate that kap <dig> may undertake a function in g1/s that is not shared with srp <dig>  to support this possibility, kap <dig> has been recently described to contribute to the import of proteins without requiring srp <dig> and by recognizing an import signal distinct from the classical nls  <cit> . however, the fact that the major cell cycle defect in the kap <dig> mutant also occurs in g2/m and, more importantly, the fact that we also observed g <dig> arrested cells in a teto 7:cse <dig> mutant strain, suggest that the different phenotype we observed in the kap <dig> mutant cells, compared to the previously reported phenotype of mutations srp1- <dig> and cse1- <dig>  is more likely caused by the different effect of the distinct mutant used in the classical nuclear import pathway activity. in fact, the nuclear localization of the key start regulators described in this work depends on both kap <dig> and srp <dig>  thus, our results reveal a new function of the classical import pathway in the control of the cell cycle at the start transition. nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that kap <dig> might control other proteins involved in the g1/s transition independently of srp <dig>  the fact that only a minor proportion of kap <dig> mutant cells are blocked in g <dig> could simply reflect a greater sensitivity of the g2/m transition to the reduced activity of the pathway, so the blockage of cells at this cell cycle step precludes an accumulation of cells in the g <dig> phase. this is supported by the results obtained when cells were arrested at the telophase  before inactivating kap <dig>  in this case, cells mostly accumulate in the g <dig> phase, demonstrating that kap <dig> is required for executing start.

despite the defect in the g2/m phase in the mutants in the classical import pathway having been characterized several years ago, there is no explanation for the causes of this arrest. as inactivation of srp <dig> results in longer half lives of some mitosis regulators like cyclin clb <dig>  some authors have proposed that this import pathway could affect the protein degradation machinery required for progression through mitosis  <cit> . alternatively, the inability to enter the nucleus of a key mitotic regulator required for mitosis progression could also explain the blockage at the g2/m transition. a good candidate is separase esp <dig>  the protease that triggers sister-chromatid segregation once in the nucleus  <cit> . failure to locate separase in the nucleus is expected to result in cell arrest at the metaphase, which is consistent with the terminal phenotype of the mutants in the classical import pathway. interestingly, the analysis of the esp <dig> sequence identified a consensus classical monopartite nls between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig> , which strongly suggests that the classical nuclear import pathway may be responsible for separase nuclear accumulation.

it is noteworthy that additional defects have been observed in the g2/m kap <dig> cells. first, most g2/m cells contain a single nucleus, although this is not properly located near the bud neck in a fraction of the cells. second, a small yet significant percentage of cells that escapes the blockage segregates chromosomes inside mother cells. a similar defect was observed in the cse1- <dig> mutant strain  <cit> . these observations suggest that the inactivation of the classical import pathway causes a dysfunction in the nucleus positioning and/or spindle orientation.

as previously mentioned, our results reveal a new function of karyopherin kap <dig> and the classical import pathway in the control of the cell cycle in addition to its known connection with mitosis. specifically, kap <dig> is involved in the execution of start at the initiation of a new round of division, which suggests that the classical import pathway may mediate the nuclear import of proteins controlling start. start consists in the activation of a transcriptional program, so the transcription factors involved in start are good candidates to be regulated by kap <dig>  in fact, the expression of g1/s regulated genes is impaired in the absence of kap <dig>  given the robustness of the start transcriptional program conferred by the functional redundancy between its components, we suspected that the g <dig> arrest in the absence of kap <dig> could reflect the delocalization of several start regulators. this was indeed the case since transcription factors swi <dig>  swi <dig> and mbp <dig> enter the nucleus assisted by kap <dig> and srp <dig>  it is important to note that the ectopic expression of cln <dig> does not completely suppress the g1/s arrest of the kap <dig> mutant cells. this indicates that kap <dig> must control the additional proteins besides the start transcriptional activators, whose mislocalization in kap <dig> mutant cells could contribute to the blockage of the start transition. as regards swi <dig> and swi <dig>  kap <dig> is the only importin responsible for their nuclear localization. regarding mbp <dig>  kap <dig> is the main import pathway; however, nuclear accumulation in the kap <dig> mutant strain is not completely abolished. this could be interpreted by the presence of a residual kap <dig> activity in the cells that are able to import mbp <dig>  but not swi <dig> or swi <dig>  however, the fact that the overexpression of an mbp <dig> protein in which the two classical nlss are inactivated still shows significant nuclear localization , points to the existence of a secondary import pathway besides kap <dig>  to characterize this alternative pathway, we analyzed the distribution of mbp1nls1i2i in all the β-karyopherin mutants , but the nuclear localization of mbp <dig> was not completely abolished in any of the mutant cells . this strongly suggests that several alternative minor import pathways are able to translocate mbp <dig> into the nucleus. the presence of multiple import pathways for mbp <dig> is not unique between yeast proteins. several cases of proteins imported by several β-karyopherins have been described, such as sas <dig>  the histones h <dig> and h <dig>  ribosomal proteins and ribosomal associated proteins, which enter the nucleus via pse <dig> and kap <dig>  <cit> . there is also the more dramatic case of the ho endonuclease  <cit>  and the asr <dig> protein  <cit> , whose nuclear import could be assisted by four or five different importins, respectively.

besides being involved in the import of start transcription activators, we have recently shown that kap <dig> is the importin of the start transcriptional repressor whi <dig>  <cit> . by taking into account that the nuclear import of cln <dig>  the cyclin that initiates the start transcription program when it is translocated to the nucleus, depends on a canonical classical nls  <cit> , it is conceivable that cln <dig> might also be imported by the classical import pathway. thus, it is striking that the nuclear import of the complete transcriptional machinery of the start transition is mediated by the classical import pathway. the use of the same pathway should prove advantageous for the coordinated assembling of the transcriptional circuitry. this is particularly relevant when transcriptional activators and repressors restraining its activity exist. the fact that the components of sbf, mbf and whi <dig> enter the nucleus by kap <dig> facilitates the colocalization of activators with its repressor. if each regulator entered the nucleus by distinct import pathways, the system could be more prone to unscheduled transcription and a deregulation of the g1/s transition with the detrimental consequence to cell physiology.

CONCLUSIONS
our results reveal a new function of karyopherin kap <dig> in the control of the cell cycle. in addition to its known connection with mitosis, kap <dig> is required for the execution of start at the initiation of a cell cycle. this suggests that kap <dig> may mediate the nuclear import of proteins controlling start. we have demonstrated that transcription factors swi <dig>  swi <dig> and mbp <dig>  responsible for the regulated gene expression at the beginning of the cell cycle, enter the nucleus assisted by kap <dig>  the nuclear import of swi <dig> and mbp <dig>  is also dependent on importin α srp <dig>  the nuclear localization signals in swi <dig> and mbp <dig> mediating the nuclear import of the proteins have been identified. the results described herein complete a detailed picture of the spatial regulation of the components of the essential start transcriptional program .
