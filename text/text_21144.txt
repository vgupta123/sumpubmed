BACKGROUND
osmotic stress refers to the stress on a cell induced by sudden changes in impermeable solute concentrations around a cell that affect the equilibrium with the solution inside the cell. when this happens, water molecules will move in and out of cells by diffusion via the lipid bilayer or the aquaporin channels to regain the equilibrium. the induced water flow across the cell membrane will tend to cause changes in the cell volume, specifically in the cytoplasmic volume, and will induce a number of cellular responses to maintain the homeostasis of the cell's water content  <cit> . when the solute concentration inside a cell is higher than around the cell, i.e., when under hypoosmotic stress, water molecules will flow inwards, potentially causing animal cells to swell and increasing the turgor pressure in plant and bacterial cells. alternatively when the impermeable solute concentration inside a cell is lower, i.e., when under hyperosmotic stress, water will flow outwards, hence shocking the cell. in this paper, we focus on the response system to the hyperosmotic stress caused by salt shock knowing that the general knowledge about the hypoosmotic-stress associated response system in prokaryotes is very limited. throughout this paper osmoregulation refers to osmoregulation in response to the hyperosmotic stress caused by salt shock.

during evolution, all organisms have developed mechanisms to respond to osmotic stresses  through tightly regulating a cell's osmolarity so it stays constant, a vitally important condition for cells to survive under changing environments. this regulation process is called osmoregulation. prokaryotes are known to use two basic osmoregulation mechanisms:  the salt-in-cytoplasm mechanism involves adjusting the salt concentration in the cytoplasm according to the environmental osmolarity, and  the organic-osmolyte mechanism involves accumulating uncharged, water-soluble organic compounds to maintain an osmotic equilibrium with the surrounding medium  <cit> . previous studies have found that most of the known prokaryotes use the second mechanism  <cit> , that is to use organic osmolytes such as polyhydric alcohols, sugars, free amino acids and their derivatives, and combinations of urea and methylamines  <cit>  to adjust a cell's osmolarity. it has been observed that the least salt-tolerant organisms tend to use disaccharides as the osmolytes, whereas the more halo-tolerant and halophilic species use sugar-polyols and nitrogen-containing solutes  <cit> .

typically when a cell is under hyperosmotic stress, na+ and cl- quickly move into the cell cytoplasm within several seconds; the excessive toxic na+ are actively exported by na+/h+ antiporters and the nontoxic k+ are also actively transported into the cell from the environment through its k+ antiporters or symporters to maintain the osmolarity needed by the cell in the first hour; and then transport some compatible osmolytes into the cell from the environment or synthesize them in the cell to replace the k+ surplus within the following several hours  <cit> . to date, osmoregulation has been well studied in bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli and yeast, but very little is known about how osmoregulation works in marine cyanobacteria such as synechococcus and prochlorococcus. synechococcus sp. strain wh <dig> is a model organism for organisms that are known to play a key role in global carbon fixation. since osmolytes represent an important fraction of the fixed carbon, understanding its allocation among different compounds is useful in building a predictive model of these microorganisms.

we have recently carried out a computational study aiming to predict the osmoregulation network in wh <dig> by extending and applying a computational protocol for biological network prediction that our group previously developed  <cit> . this prediction capability consists of three key steps for network prediction, namely  construction of template network models for related  organisms that have substantial experimental data and possibly known information about the target network,  prediction of operons and functional relatedness among genes in the target genome, and  mapping the template network models to the target genome through orthologous gene mapping that is consistent with the predicted operons and gene associations. this computational protocol has been used to predict the phosphorus assimilation network, the carbon fixation network and the nitrogen assimilation regulatory network in wh <dig>  <cit> . by adapting this protocol to our target model, we have constructed a  osmoregulation network for each of five selected organisms, i.e., aphanothece halophytica , corynebacterium glutamicum atcc  <dig> , escherichia coli k <dig> , persephonella marina ex-h <dig> , synechocystis sp. pcc <dig> , that have available experimental data related to osmoregulation; made computational prediction of operons as well as of gene functional relatedness in wh8102; and then predicted a model for osmoregulation in wh <dig> through mapping the template models to wh <dig> in conjunction and validating some of these predictions with experimental data.

our study has led to a number of new discoveries about osmoregulation in wh <dig>  including identification of key transporters, synthetases, signal sensor proteins and transcription regulator proteins involved in wh <dig> osmoregulation. through analyses of the predicted regulatory network, we have gained a number of new insights about wh8102:  wh <dig> likely accumulates and uses glycine betaine as the major osmolyte, and glucosylglycerol, glucosylglycerate, trehalose, sucrose and arginine as the minor osmolytes; and  σ <dig>  one of the seven types of σ subunits of the rna polymerase, probably serves as a global regulator in the osmoregulation network in wh <dig>  to the best of our knowledge, this is the first published study on construction of the osmoregulation network using computation methods for cyanobacteria or any prokaryote.

RESULTS
template networks
the osmoregulation process in prokaryotes typically consists of two components. first, under hyperosmotic stress, na+ will be exported out of the cell and k+ will be transported into the cell as a transient response; and second, some compatible osmolytes will be transported from the environment into or synthesized inside the cell to replace the k+. the selection of the osmolytes depends on the duration of the osmotic stress and the availability of the substrates and osmolytes in the surroundings. different species may prefer different osmolytes.

we have collected, through extensive literature search,  <dig> genes known to be involved in the osmoregulation network in five species, aphanothece halophytica , corynebacterium glutamicum atcc  <dig> , escherichia coli k <dig> , persephonella marina ex-h <dig> , synechocystis sp. pcc <dig> , for which the osmoregulation has been studied. the following summarizes what is known about each of the osmoregulation networks in the five species :

• a. halo has three genes encoding a na+/h+ antiporter to export na+ out of the cell  <cit>  and two synthetases known to be involved in the betaine biosynthesis from glycine, compared to the widely used betaine biosynthesis pathway from choline  <cit> .

• c. glut has a two-component system known for sensing osmotic stress  <cit>  and a transporter for uptaking betaine  <cit> ;

• e. coli has  <dig> genes known to be involved in the osmoregulation process, namely a two-component system for regulating two major porin-encoding genes  <cit> , two na+ antiporters  <cit>  and three active k+ transport systems whose activation is determined by the environmental condition  <cit> , and a number of transporters and synthetases for betaine  <cit> , trehalose  <cit> , putrescine and spermidine  <cit> , respectively. σ <dig>  one of the seven types of σ subunits of rna polymerase, is a master regulator in a complex regulatory network that governs the expression of many stationary-phase-inducible genes, and was recently proposed as a global regulator in the osmoregulation network  <cit> ;

• p. mari has two genes known for glucosylglycerate synthesis  <cit> ;

• pcc <dig> has  <dig> genes known to be involved in osmoregulation process, including two k+ uptake systems in which ktr plays a major role in k+ uptake under osmotic stress  <cit> , a na+/h+ antiporter  <cit>  and a number of transporters and synthetases for glucosylglycerol  <cit> , sucrose  <cit>  and arginine  <cit> ; and

we have used these data as the templates and mapped them to wh <dig>  and built the initial target network in wh <dig> 

the initial osmoregulation model of wh8102
by using p-map  <cit>  and blast  <cit> , we were able to map the genes from the five  template networks outlined above to  <dig> genes in wh <dig> , providing the components of our initial osmoregulation network model of wh <dig>  p-map maps a template network onto a target genome by finding the orthologous genes of the template in the target genome using both sequence similarity information and operon information  <cit> . when multiple genes from different organisms are mapped to the same gene in wh <dig>  we choose the mapping from the organism with a closer evolutionary relationship. for example, both otsa  in e. coli and ggps  in pcc <dig> are mapped to synw <dig> in wh <dig>  we have accepted the mapping from pcc <dig>  table  <dig> shows the mapped gene list, along with a numerical score for each  gene, representing the level of similarity between the two protein domain structures.

 <dig>  da: domain architecture

when mapping the template networks onto wh <dig>  we noticed that only the na+/h+ antiporter in pcc <dig> maps to synw <dig>  in wh <dig>  while na+/h+ antiporters in e. coli and a.halo do not have any hits. the three k+ uptake systems in the template organisms can only be partially mapped to wh <dig> ; and only ktrbae , is found in wh <dig> through mapping, while the other two systems, kdp and kup, could not be mapped . this mapping result seems to make sense since  it has been reported that the ktr system, not the kdp system, plays a major role in the k+ uptake under osmotic stress in pcc6803; and  the kup system functions in a low ph environment in e. coli  <cit>  while the living environment of wh <dig> has a ph value  <dig> , suggesting that kup may not be useful for wh <dig> 

a number of key osmolyte accumulation systems have been found in wh <dig> through mapping . multiple transporters and synthetases for the major osmolyte betaine  <cit>  are identified in wh8102: bett , betp  and provwx  are probably used to uptake betaine from the environment when it is available; gsmt  and sdmt  are responsible for synthesizing betaine from glycine; and betb  are likely used to synthesize betaine from proline. in addition to the major osmolyte, spsa  and spea  are two key enzymes in the sucrose synthesis pathway and arginine synthesis pathway respectively; ggtcda  are likely used to uptake glucosylglycerol, trehalose and/or sucrose, and ggpsp  are for glucosylglycerol biosynthesis; and gpgsp  are used to synthesize glucosylglycerate.

the overall initial osmoregulation model can be summarized as follows:  under hyperosmotic stress, wh <dig> first uptakes k+ possibly through the ktr system, and then accumulates the major osmolyte betaine as well as some minor osmolytes such as glucosylglycerol, glucosylglycerate, trehalose, sucrose and arginine through the flexible osmolyte accumulation systems; and  σ <dig>  may serve as a global regulator to coordinate the k+ uptake and the osmolyte accumulation processes. we have noted that some key subunits of an osmoregulation network are missing from the initial model based on template mapping alone, such as ggtb , so additional information is needed to expand and refine the model.

the expanded osmoregulation model in wh8102
we have expanded the initial network model through "guilt by association" based on co-location , co-regulation and co-evolution information that we can calculate through comparative genomic analyses. the basic idea of such association-based prediction is that if protein a is in the initial model but b is not, we will consider adding b to the model if a and b are related based on the aforementioned "co-" analyses. additional file  <dig> lists the expanded model of the osmoregulation network through execution of the following steps.

expansion based on operon prediction
it is well known that genes in the same operon are functionally related, such as enzymes catalyzing subsequent steps in a metabolic pathway, or forming a protein complex  <cit> . we added  <dig> new genes into the initial model based on operon predictions for wh <dig>  <cit>  . specifically, we added synw2165- <dig> and  <dig> since they share the same operon with synw2168- <dig> , which could be candidates for the missing subunits of the potassium transporter complex ktr , although additional experimental studies are needed to validate the prediction. synw1279- <dig>   <dig>   <dig> are added to the model since they share the same operons with ggps  and ggtcda , which are the wh <dig> candidates for ggtb  in e. coli. we noted that this prediction is also supported by phylogenetic profile-based prediction . synw0230- <dig> and synw <dig> are added since they share operons with bett  and prop , respectively, which are possible candidates for the missing betaine osmolyte transporter subunits. synw <dig> is added since it shares the same operon with gpgp , which might be involved in the glucosylglycerate synthesis pathway. synw <dig> and synw2247- <dig> are added since they share the same operon, respectively, with synw <dig> and synw <dig>  which might be used for osmotic signal transduction. synw0664- <dig> are added since they share the same operon with ktre ; and synw <dig> is added since it shares the same operon with rpod .

expansion based on predicted protein-protein interactions
protein-protein interactions, derived from large-scale two-hybrid experiments  <cit>  or predicted based on protein fusion analyses  <cit> , provide another source of information for expanding our initial network. we used the set of protein-protein interactions in wh <dig> predicted previously by our group  <cit> , which contains  <dig> interactions http://www.cs.uncc.edu/~zcsu/pathways/nitrogen/nitrogen. specifically, synw <dig>  and synw <dig>  are added into the network since they are predicted to form a protein complex with sdmt  and gdmt , respectively, which are already in the initial model. synw <dig> , synw <dig>  and synw <dig>  are added since they are predicted to form a protein complex with provwx . synw <dig> , synw <dig>  and synw <dig>  are added since they are predicted to form a protein complex with sps . synw <dig>  and synw <dig>  are added since they are predicted to form a protein complex with synw <dig>  synw <dig>  is added since it is predicted to form a protein complex with synw <dig>  synw <dig>  and synw <dig>  are added since they are predicted to form a protein complex with betb . synw <dig>  is added since it is predicted to form a protein complex with spea . synw <dig>  is added since it is predicted to form a protein complex with ktre . overall,  <dig> new proteins are added into the network based on their predicted interactions with proteins already in the network model .

expansion based on the σ <dig> regulon prediction
σ <dig> has been suggested as a global regulator in the osmotic control of gene expression in e. coli  <cit> , so we added additional genes based on orthology mapping of the σ <dig> regulon of e. coli to wh <dig>  we first tested and validated our regulon mapping method in pcc <dig>  since there are multiple microarray datasets for this organism. we first collected  <dig> genes of the σ <dig> regulon in e. coli from regulondb  <dig>   <cit> , and mapped  <dig> genes to their orthologs in pcc <dig> . to assess the reliability of our regulon mapping, we collected microarray data of pcc <dig> under hyperosmotic stress from the public domain . we found that  <dig> of the  <dig> mapped genes showed more than two-fold change in their expression levels. this result has a significant p-value  <dig>  , suggesting that our prediction is statistically significant. the possible reason for the p-value being not any lower could be that  the effect of the osmotic stress is rather local; or  the time points at which the expression data are collected do not coincide well with the timing of the relevant response process.

having demonstrated the reliability of the σ <dig> mapping on pcc <dig>  we then applied the same mapping to wh <dig>  and mapped  <dig> genes onto wh <dig> . we noticed that some genes in the initial network model, e.g., ggps , provwx , betb  and prop , are predicted as targets of σ <dig>  indicating that our mapping functions properly.

expansion based on phylogenetic profile analysis
it has been well demonstrated that genes with highly similar phylogenetic profiles are functionally related  <cit> . we used the same  <dig> bacterial genomes mentioned earlier to construct a phylogenetic profile for each gene in wh <dig> http://csbl.bmb.uga.edu/~xizeng/research/osmoregulation. using the phylogenetic profile information, we identified  <dig> genes already in our initial network and added  <dig> additional genes to our network model, as shown in figure  <dig>  specifically, envz  and ompr , provwx , and ktrba  already in our initial network are identified again. synw <dig>  synw <dig>  synw <dig>  synw <dig>  synw1526- <dig>  and synw1530- <dig> are added since they have very similar phylogenetic profiles with those of ggtcda . we believe that they may be candidates for ggtb  of e. coli, and probably involved in glucosylglycerol synthesis. synw <dig>  synw <dig>  synw <dig>  synw <dig> and synw <dig> are added since they have very similar phylogenetic profiles with those of gpgsp , and they are probably involved in glucosylglycerate synthesis.

overall,  <dig> new genes are added to the initial osmoregulation network model,  <dig> based on co-operon information,  <dig> based on protein-protein interactions,  <dig> based on σ <dig> regulon, and  <dig> based on predicted co-evolutionary relationships, among which some genes are added by more than one method. for some of these newly added genes, we have predicted their possible functional roles in osmoregulation but for others, all we can say is that we believe that they are involved in osmoregulation in wh <dig> but we do not have further information about their functional roles. experimental studies are clearly needed to elucidate the detailed functions of these genes.

validation and refinement
to validate the components in the predicted osmoregulation network and refine it based on the validation results, we have checked our predictions against  the published literature related to osmoregulation in wh8102;  whole-genome microarray gene expression data of both wh <dig> and pcc <dig>  our wh <dig> data is collected under mild salt shock , and the pcc <dig> data under multiple conditions were collected from public databases; and  protein domain architecture information from public databases.

our predicted osmoregulation model is highly consistent with the published literature. lu et al. showed experimentally that wh <dig> synthesizes betaine from glycine using synw1913- <dig>   <cit> , both genes in our initial model. a recent review by scanlan et al. summarized  <dig> wh <dig> genes known to be involved in the biosynthesis and uptake of betaine and glucosylglycerol  <cit> , all of which are in our model. notably, betab is considered missing across all cyanobacteria genomes except for trichodesmium erythraeum and crocosphaera watsonii, according to this review. we found a homolog  in wh <dig> with an e-value  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  and included this homolog in our in our model based on the significance of the e-value. clearly further experiments are needed to study its possible role relevant to osmotic stress.

we have checked our predicted genes against one microarray dataset  that we collected under mild salt shock.  <dig> wh <dig> genes show differential expressions under this condition compared to no salt shock, which is estimated at 1% false discovery rate . among the  <dig> genes that we predicted to be involved in the osmoregulation process of wh <dig>   <dig> genes show differential expressions under this condition, giving rise to a p-value of  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  which is the probability of seeing this many genes with differential expressions among  <dig> randomly selected genes out of the  <dig>  wh <dig> genes. among these  <dig> genes,  <dig> are in the initial model,  <dig> are added based on operon information,  <dig> added based on protein-protein interaction data,  <dig> added based on the regulon prediction and  <dig> added based on co-evolutionary analyses .

we also used conservation information of protein domains to validate the gene pairs predicted by p-map mapping with one gene from a template genome and the other being the mapped gene in wh <dig>  the consideration is that true orthologous genes across two  genomes should in general have the same domain architecture. for each gene in our initial network model as well as genes mapped from the σ <dig> regulon and its orthologous gene from the corresponding reference genome, we calculated a conservation score for their protein-domain architectures, having the score ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  with  <dig> representing two domain architectures being identical and  <dig> for being totally different . for  <dig> such gene pairs,  <dig> pairs have domain-conservation scores almost being  <dig>  indicating that our orthology mapping works properly. seven gene pairs did not have good domain conservation scores, possibly indicating that these gene pairs may not be correctly mapped, which include the following: synw <dig>  does not have pfpf <dig>  the trka c-terminal domain; synw <dig>  does not have pf <dig>  the cbs domain; synw <dig>  does not have pf <dig>  the sucrose synthase domain; synw <dig>  does not have the pf <dig>  the orn/lys/arg decarboxylase, n-terminal domain; synw <dig>  does not have pf <dig>  the peptidase family s <dig> n-terminal; synw <dig>  does not have pf <dig>  the lysr substrate binding domain; and synw <dig>  has two additional tandem pf <dig>  the ef hand domain.

crosstalk between osmoregulation and other pathways
we have carried out a pathway-enrichment analysis on our osmoregulation model using kobas  <cit>  in conjunction with an application of the expression data of wh <dig> .  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes in our model are mapped onto  <dig> kegg pathways , and  <dig> pathways are enriched with p-value ≤  <dig>  , including transporters, valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation, abc transporters, fatty acid biosynthesis, aminophosphonate metabolism, limonene and pinene degradation, two-component system, protein kinases, glycerolipid metabolism, urea cycle and metabolism of amino groups, lysine degradation. these enrichment results suggest that these pathways may have direct cross-talk with the osmoregulation process.

a working model for osmoregulation network
we now describe a working model for the osmoregulation network in wh <dig> based on our prediction and validation results . our model consists of  <dig> genes,  <dig> of which have predicted functional roles in osmoregulation and the remaining  <dig> are predicted to be involved in the network but without predicted functions. our overall model can be summarized as follows, which consists of the following key components and gene assignments.

 <dig>  na+ export system: synw <dig> functions as a na+/h+ antiporter to export the excessive na+ out of the cell under hyperosmotic stresses;

 <dig>  k+ uptake systems: synw <dig>  synw2168- <dig> consist of a ktr system and may play a major role in active k+ uptake under hyperosmotic stresses;

 <dig>  osmolyte accumulation systems: synw <dig> , synw1915- <dig>  and synw <dig>  are used to uptake the major osmolyte betaine if available in the environment, while synw1913- <dig>  are used to synthesize betaine from glycine when needed; synw <dig>  and synw <dig>  are used to synthesize glucosyl glycerate or mannosylglycerate from glucose; synw <dig>  and synw <dig>  are used to synthesize glucosylglycerol from glucose, while synw1283- <dig>  uptake glucosylglycerol when available in the environment; synw <dig>  is for synthesizing the minor osmolyte arginine; and synw <dig>  for synthesizing the minor osmolyte sucrose;

 <dig>  global regulator: synw <dig>  functions as a global transcription regulator possibly to bridge the k+ uptake and osmolyte accumulation processes and to coordinate osmoregulation with other biological processes; and

 <dig>  two-component signal transduction systems: synw0807- <dig>  regulate water across the outer membrane and gene responses of some osmoregulatory elements; and synw <dig> and synw <dig> may be responsible for sensing external osmotic stress and/or activating a number of genes relevant to osmoregulation, which suggests other member genes should also be relevant to osmosensing but further experiments are needed to derive more information about this.

CONCLUSIONS
from our predicted model, we found that  wh <dig> likely accumulates and uses glycine betaine as the major osmolyte, and glucosylglycerol, glucosylglycerate, trehalose, sucrose and arginine as the minor osmolytes; and  σ <dig>  one of the seven types of σ subunits of the rna polymerase, probably serves as a global regulator in the osmoregulation network in wh <dig>  we believe that this working model provides useful information to experimental biologists in their research design for further studying the osmoregulation process in wh <dig>  to the best of our knowledge, this model represents the first published study on construction of the osmoregulation network using computation methods for cyanobacteria or any prokaryote.
