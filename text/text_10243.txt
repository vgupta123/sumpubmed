BACKGROUND
proteins containing iron-sulfur clusters play essential roles in electron-transfer, catalysis and other biochemical processes  <cit> . in eubacteria and in many eukaryotes, general iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis is mediated by the multi-component isc assembly system. extensive biochemical and genetic studies  <cit>  have shown that this process occurs through the assembly of a cluster on the scaffold protein iscu  followed by its transfer to a recipient apo-protein. the efficiency of the second step is greatly increased in the presence of hsca and hscb , but the precise role of this chaperone system is not well understood  <cit> .

hscb is a  <dig> kda j-type co-chaperone protein that regulates the atp hydrolysis activity of hsca and targets iscu to its substrate-binding domain. the crystal structures of hscb from escherichia coli  <cit> , homo sapiens  <cit> , and vibrio cholerae  revealed that the cochaperone has a conserved structural core that consists of two domains arranged in an l-shaped fold. the n-terminal j-domain  is similar in structure to other j-domain fragments  <cit>  while the c-terminal domain  adopts a compact three-helix bundle. sequence analysis of hscb homologs identified a series of highly conserved residues  that form an extensive, surface-exposed patch on one face of the c-terminal domain and it was hypothesized that this region participates in functionally relevant protein-protein interactions  <cit> .

in the cell, the physiologically relevant interaction of hscb with iscu is presumed to occur when fes clusters are bound to the scaffold protein, e.g., iscu  <cit> . however, hscb interacts with both the apo- and holo-forms of iscu  <cit> , and because of the instability of cluster-bound forms of iscu, studies of the hscb-iscu interaction have employed the apo-protein. the importance of several conserved residues  was first tested by collectively replacing them with alanines in saccharomyces cerevisiae jac <dig>  <cit> . the resultant hexa-mutant showed reduced affinity for isu <dig> in vitro, but the authors did not identify specific residues responsible for this drop in affinity. moreover, the hexa-mutant did not produce a growth phenotype in yeast, which suggested that either the jac1-isu <dig> interaction was not sufficiently disrupted or that it is not essential under certain conditions in vivo.

more recently, we used nmr spectroscopy and mutagenesis techniques to study the e. coli hscb-iscu interaction  <cit> . on the basis of these results, we proposed that the iscu binding site on hscb consists of the highly conserved surface patch noted previously plus nearby residues that either are conserved only in γ-proteobacteria or are not conserved . triple alanine substitution of e <dig>  e <dig>  and e <dig> resulted in a modest  decrease in the maximal synergistic stimulation of hsca by hscb and iscu and also in a modest  increase in the concentration of iscu required for half-maximal stimulation. on the other hand, triple alanine substitution of l <dig>  m <dig>  and f <dig> had a much more detrimental effect: the maximal synergistic stimulation of hsca by hscb and iscu decreased ≅5-fold, and the concentration of iscu required for half-maximal stimulation increased ≅8-fold.

these studies left several important questions unanswered. which of the alanine substitutions are responsible for the detrimental effects reported in our previous study and are there additional residues that are critical for the stability of the hscb-iscu complex? is, in fact, the hscb-iscu interaction unnecessary under certain conditions as suggested by the jac1-isu <dig> study? in the work reported here, we used itc and nmr spectroscopy to define the individual contribution of fourteen hscb residues to the stability of the hscb- complex. our results allowed us to refine the residues of hscb critical for strong interaction with iscu to three hydrophobic residues , with a single negatively charged residue , and two positively charged residues  providing additional but smaller contributions. moreover, we suggest a pattern of alanine substitution that could prove useful in testing the importance of the hscb-iscu interaction in vivo.

RESULTS
structure and stability of alanine-substituted hscbs
using the quikchange technique and previously described expression and purification procedures  <cit> , we generated single alanine substitutions in e. coli hscb at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  all of the mutants displayed far- and near-uv cd spectra similar to wild-type hscb . in addition, mutants with an alanine substitution at position  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> displayed solution molecular masses  and thermal stabilities  similar to wild-type hscb . although hscb also displayed a solution molecular mass ≅ <dig> kda, it showed a slightly lower melting temperature  than wild-type hscb . together, these results suggest that the overall structure, oligomeric state, and stability of hscb are not affected to any significant degree by the single alanine substitutions.

affinity of alanine-substituted hscbs for iscu
to investigate whether any of the alanine substitutions perturbed the stability of the hscb-iscu complex, we used itc to determine the binding affinity of each alanine mutant for apo-iscu . under the conditions of the experiment, wild-type hscb bound iscu with an affinity of  <dig> ±  <dig> μm which approximates the previously reported value of  <dig> μm  <cit> . alanine substitutions at position  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> had no or only minor effects on the binding of hscb to iscu . in contrast, substitutions r87a , r99a , and e100a  decreased the affinity of hscb for iscu ≅ 4- to 6-fold. the most dramatic effects were observed for three hydrophobic residues in the center of the proposed iscu binding site. substitutions l92a , l96a , and f153a  decreased the affinity of hscb for iscu greater than 20-fold compared to that of wild-type protein.

1stoichiometries , association constants , heats of binding , and entropies of binding  for the interaction of wild-type and alanine-substituted forms of hscb with apo-iscu, as determined by itc. the entropic contribution was determined from the relationship, Δgb = Δhb - tΔsb, where Δgb = -rtlnka. owing to the low n values obtained with hscb, hscb, hscb, hscb, and hscb, the Δh and Δs values determined for these variants are likely only approximate. gb values cited in the text were calculated from the relationship, ΔΔgb = Δgb  - Δgb .

to investigate the effect of multiple alanine substitutions on the affinity of hscb for iscu, we also evaluated by itc the behaviour of our previously studied triple alanine mutants. the  substitution had a modest effect on the binding of hscb to iscu , and this change was almost equal to that observed for the e100a single mutant. in contrast, the effect of the  substitution was much greater than the effect of any single alanine substitution. the heats of injection for this triple mutant were very small , and fitting of the data to extract binding parameters was unsuccessful.

nmr spectroscopy of alanine-substituted hscb
as an independent means of assessing the effects of the single alanine substitutions, we used nmr spectroscopy to compare selected hscb mutants with wild-type hscb. one representative mutant was chosen from each of the three types of mutants observed in our itc studies: hscb , hscb , and hscb . the 15n-hsqc spectra of the free proteins were very similar , and larger chemical shift differences  were only observed for residues in the immediate vicinity of the alanine substitutions . the presence of a six-fold molar excess of iscu produced larger chemical shift differences among the 15n-hsqc spectra of the proteins, but the overall peak pattern of all four spectra remained very similar . together, these results indicate that an alanine substitution at position  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> does not alter the overall fold of free hscb to any significant degree and that the different forms of hscb adopt similar structures in the hscb-iscu complex.

next, we recorded a series of 15n-hsqc spectra for hscb in the presence of varying amounts of apo-iscu. we observed previously that many of the nmr signals that map to the iscu binding site on hscb are broad and unobservable in the hscb-iscu complex  <cit> . thus those hscb signals observed to shift upon addition of iscu need not all be in the contact region and may simply report on a conformational transition that accompanies iscu binding. nevertheless, their chemical shift changes report on the binding interaction and can be used to assess binding strength. therefore, we reasoned that if a substitution leaves the hscb-iscu binding strength unperturbed, the complex will be saturated to a similar extent at any given hscb/iscu ratio relative to the wild-type hscb-iscu complex. in turn, this will cause the progressive iscu-induced chemical shift changes exhibited by the mutant hscb to be very similar to those of wild-type hscb. based on our itc results, we hypothesized that hscb will show this type of behaviour. in contrast, if a substitution decreases the hscb-iscu binding strength, the complex should be saturated to a smaller extent at any given hscb/iscu ratio relative to the wild-type hscb-iscu complex. in turn, this will cause the progressive iscu-induced chemical shift changes exhibited by the mutant hscb to be smaller than those of wild-type hscb. based on our itc results, we hypothesized that hscb and hscb will show this type of behaviour.

the 15n-hsqc spectral series for each mutant was first examined to identify all peaks showing chemical shift changes during the titration; subsequently, the observed chemical shift changes were plotted as a function of iscu/hscb molar ratio, and the results were compared to those obtained for wild-type hscb. figure  <dig> shows examples of such a comparison for three well resolved peaks in the hsqc spectral series: f <dig>  v <dig>  and e <dig>  the behaviour of f <dig> is representative of the majority of peaks that experienced large chemical shift changes, while the behaviours of v <dig> and e <dig> are representative of the majority of peaks that experienced moderate and small chemical shift changes, respectively.

for hscb, f <dig>  v <dig>  and e <dig> showed a very similar pattern of progressive chemical shift changes to that observed for wild-type hscb . this indicates that at any given hscb/iscu ratio, the complex is similarly saturated whether it contains wild-type hscb or hscb. therefore, an alanine substitution at position  <dig> of e. coli hscb affects the protein's affinity for iscu only slightly. for hscb, the progressive chemical shift changes for all three residues appeared ≅ 25-50% smaller than for wild-type hscb at each hscb-iscu molar ratio examined . this indicates that at any given hscb/iscu ratio, the complex containing the mutant is less saturated than that containing the wild-type protein. therefore, an alanine substitution at position  <dig> of e. coli hscb affects its affinity for iscu to a greater extent than the d103a substitution. of the three alanine substitutions examined, the one at position  <dig> had the largest effects. the progressive chemical shift changes for f <dig>  v <dig>  and e <dig> of hscb were over 50% smaller than for wild-type hscb at each hscb-iscu molar ratio examined . this indicates that at any given hscb/iscu ratio, the complex containing the l96a mutant is much less saturated than that containing the wild-type protein or either of the other two mutants. therefore, an alanine substitution at position  <dig> of e. coli hscb produces the largest decrease in the affinity of the cochaperone for iscu.

discussion
the experiments described herein continue previous work from our laboratory on the hscb-iscu interaction. we individually replaced with alanine fourteen surface-exposed residues in the c-terminal domain of e. coli hscb, and evaluated their effects using itc and nmr spectroscopy. of the three highly conserved acidic residues , only the e100a substitution perturbed the affinity of hscb for iscu . the resultant change in the free energy of binding  was close to the experimentally determined value for a mutant with alanine substitutions at all three acidic positions, suggesting that the effects of the substitutions are additive and that the slightly decreased function of the triple mutant observed in our previous work  <cit>  is caused predominantly by the e100a substitution.

by contrast, of the four highly conserved hydrophobic residues of hscb, three make major contributions to the stability of the complex with apo-iscu . alanine substitutions at positions  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> decreased the affinity of hscb for iscu ≅ 5-fold more than the e100a substitution, and resulted in ΔΔgb values of approximately  <dig>  kcal/mol. although l <dig>  l <dig>  and f <dig> appear to be the most important residues, others  were also found to make substantial contributions to the stability of the hscb-iscu complex. on the other hand, substitutions at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> had little or no effect; this suggests that these residues are located at the periphery of the hscb-iscu interface where additional solvent molecules and the rearrangement of hydrogen bonding patterns can more easily accommodate a missing side chain  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the present results explain earlier studies of the triple mutant, hscb. of these three substitutions, l92a and f153a are the ones expected to affect the interaction with iscu, and we can estimate that they will destabilize the hscb-iscu complex by ≅  <dig>  kcal/mol. this large effect explains the very small  heats of injection observed in our itc experiments , the low level of hsca stimulation achieved by this mutant  <cit> , and the weak nmr shifts of 15n-labeled iscu when titrated with this mutant  <cit> .

our results also suggest a new pattern of alanine substitution to test the in vivo significance of the hscb-iscu interaction. if the effect of each substitution is additive, alanine substitutions at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  will destabilize the hscb-iscu complex by ≅  <dig>  kcal/mol, corresponding to a ≅ 1000-fold reduction in the affinity of hscb for iscu. while this is a large drop in affinity, it might not be sufficient to completely disrupt the hscb-iscu interaction which could explain why a growth phenotype was not seen for the corresponding jac <dig> mutant. our data suggest, however, that a triple alanine substitution at hscb positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> will destabilize the hscb-iscu complex to a much greater extent , corresponding to a ≅ 15000-fold reduction in affinity of hscb for iscu. this triple alanine substitution is expected to disrupt the hscb-iscu interaction more completely than the hexa-alanine substitution described above and could prove useful for in vivo testing of the functional significance of the hscb-iscu interaction.
