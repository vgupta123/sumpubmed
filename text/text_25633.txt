BACKGROUND
quorum sensing is an extensive system whereby bacteria can communicate not only with members of their own species, but also with other species to coordinate their behaviour in response to population density, thereby modulating the expression of specific genes in a population-density dependent manner. this phenomenon, known as quorum sensing   <cit> , and biofilm formation and swarming motility in p. aeruginosa and b. cepacia  <cit> , among others.

two main types of quorum-sensing signalling pathways have been described for gram-negative bacteria: the acylhomoserine lactone -based system and the autoinducer 2-based system, which is described below. the first ahl-based quorum-sensing system described was involved in the control of bioluminescence in v. fischeri via the luxr/i system  <cit> . luxi synthesizes the diffusible signal molecule n--l-homoserine lactone, which increases in concentration as the cell density increases. at a critical concentration, luxr first binds the signal molecule and then activates the expression of target genes. genes homologous with this system have been found in several gram-negative bacteria, although n-acyl-homoserine lactones  seem to be highly variable, both in terms of the acyl chain length and in the chemical structure of the radicals. moreover, different ahls synthases have been described in different quorum sensing signalling pathways. for instance, in v. harveyi a 3-hydroxy-c4-hsl is synthesized by the luxm synthase and received by luxn protein. the genes coding for these proteins show no homology to the previously described luxr/i quorum sensing system. the complex quorum sensing circuit also differ from other previously reported systems as stated below  <cit> . it has also to be noted that some bacteria have been shown to express enzymes that are able to interfere with ahl-based quorum-sensing systems from other species: acylases, which remove the side chain from the lactone ring from the ahls by hydrolyzing the connecting amide bond between the ring and the side chain  <cit>  and lactonases, which hydrolyze the lactone ring of the ahls  <cit> .

on the other hand, bacteria have been shown to possess a different mechanism for interspecies communication, namely the luxs  system previously described  <cit> . the luxs is an autoinducer synthase produced by many diverse bacteria, including both gram-negative and gram-positive species  <cit> . luxs encodes an s-ribosyl homocysteinase, which converts s-ribosyl homocysteine from the methyl cycle into homocysteine , as well as the autoinducer  <dig>  <cit> , a borate diester of the cyclized  <dig> -dihydroxy- <dig> -pentanedione  <cit> . the ai- <dig> system has been shown to regulate several physiological activities including pathogenicity , motility, biofilm formation, antibiotic production, and bioluminescence, among others .

vibrio scophthalmi belongs to the highly heterogeneous vibrionaceae family, which is comprised of  <dig> species, including both free-living and symbiotic species characterized by mutualistic or pathogenic relationships  <cit> . v. scophthalmi was first described in association with turbot , being the most abundant vibrio species found in intestinal bacterial populations  <cit> . it has been shown that v. scophthalmi maintains host specificity, despite showing a different phenotype pattern in 15– <dig> day-old larvae  <cit> . this fact, together with the finding that this organism is not the most abundant vibrio spp in those waters surrounding the fish, led us to hypothesise that the benefits of turbot gut colonization by v. scophthalmi could be dependent upon a quorum-sensing system that responded when a sufficient number of bacteria were present in the gut.

some symbiotic species belonging to the vibrionaceae family have been shown to regulate bioluminescence through a complicated network of quorum-sensing systems involving the lux genes. homologues to the luxr/i system have been described for v. fischeri, v. anguillarum, v. cholerae, v. logei and v. parahaemolyticus  <cit> . in v. harveyi, the quorum-sensing as stated above, is a complex circuit consising of a multichannel two-component phosphorelay signal transduction pathway. in this bacterium the luxr/i system is not present. instead, the luxm/n system works in parallel as well as the cqsa/s system with the luxs/pq to regulate a transcriptional activator, luxr .  <cit> . another complex quorum system was also described in v. cholerae  <cit> .

here we study the quorum-sensing signal synthases in v. scophthalmi, focusing on the two most common signal molecules in gram-negative bacteria described above . the expression of ahls was analyzed by thin layer chromatography  using different ahl sensor strains. recombinant v. scophthalmi strains expressing an aiia gene that coded for a lactonase were obtained and the loss of ahl production investigated. the presence of ai- <dig> synthase was analyzed by using the v. harveyi autoinducer bioluminescence bioassay  <cit>  while the luxs gene, which is known as the synthase for ai- <dig>  was detected by pcr and then sequenced.

RESULTS
identification of ahls autoinducers
the v. scophthalmi strains a <dig> and a <dig> were grown overnight in different growth media  and the supernatant was analysed for the presence of ahl-like molecules. three different signal spots were detected in the tlc assay performed with the a. tumefaciens strain ntl <dig>  , which were not present in the medium alone used as negative control, suggesting the presence of three ahl-like molecules in the supernatant of v. scophthami. the retention factor  of the three ahl-like molecules was  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  , from higher to lower rf, respectively, as a result of three independent experiments. these three ahl-like molecules detected by the a. tumefaciens sensor strain were produced with any of the employed growth medium: mlb, mtsb, mpw, and ab . moreover, as shown on fig. 1b, all three molecules were detected by tlc in the mid-exponential growth phase and maintained over the stationary phase.

in order to further characterise these molecules, different ahl standards and different sensor strains, which have been shown to detect previously described ahls, were used. the autoinducer bioassay for the detection of ahls, which employed the bb <dig> v. harveyi sensor strain, showed no induction of the luminescence signal compared with the negative control. neither signal was detected with the chromobacterium violaceum cv <dig> or the pseudomonas putida f <dig>  and p. putida f <dig>  sensor strains. this may be related to the varying sensitivities of these sensor strains to a wide range of ahls. the c. violaceum forward bioassay  <cit> , detects preferably short chain ahls, preferably hhl, although it has been also shown to detect  <dig> hydroxy-c6-hsl  <cit>  but not longer chain ahls. the p. putida f <dig>  sensor strain is sensitive to c8-hsl and p. putida f <dig>  is highly sensitive to c12-hsl, 3-oxo-c12-hsl, c10-hsl, and  <dig> oxo-c10-hsl  <cit> . the fact that it was not possible to detect any signal in the v. harveyi bb <dig> autoinducer bioassay suggests that the putative ahls from v. scophthalmi detected with the a. tumefaciens assay are sufficiently different from that of v. harveyi to be recognised.

chemical characterisation of the ahl-like molecules
detailed analyses of the ahl-like molecules detected were carried out exclusively with the strain v. scophthalmi a <dig>  since both strains presented the same tlc pattern. two different culture media, mtsb and mpw, were evaluated for growing v. scophthalmi a <dig> in order to carry out the extraction of ahls. due to the high background observed with the mtsb medium, we decided to use the mpw culture medium. only that extract corresponding to the lower rf spot resulted in a structure composition similar to an ahl, which hypothetically corresponded to an n--l-homoserine lactone . this molecule matched the empirical formula c16h29no <dig> + h+ with mass   <dig>  and an error of  <dig>  ppm . as far as we know, this constitutes the first description of an ahl in v. scophthalmi; moreover, it has proven different from those produced by other vibrio species. it was not possible to identify any recognizable ahl-like structures in the other signalling spot extracts, even after carrying out four independent extraction experiments.

the high background levels caused by other molecules in relation to the amount of ahl produced of the other two putative ahls may have hindered the detection of these molecules. however it can not be discarded that these two signalling spots that were detected with the a. tumefaciens sensor strain, but not detected by hplc coupled with mass spectrometry, might indeed not represent ahls but ahl-derived or ahl-regulated molecules, that would induce non-specifically the a. tumefaciens sensor strain, since this sensor is known to be activated non-specifically.

acylhomoserine lactone signal synthases have been studied in other vibrio species. this species have been shown to produce several ahls, which are produced by different synthases: v. anguillarum  and the 3-oxo-decanoyl homoserine lactone, synthesized by vani, a luxi homologue)  <cit> , v. fischeri   <cit> , v. harveyi   <cit> , v. vulnificus , and v. salmonicida   <cit> .

heterologous expression of aiia in v. scophthalmi
in order to confirm the presence of ahls, ahl-derived or ahl-regulated substances in the supernatant of vibrio scophthalmi, the lactonase gene aiia from the bacillus cereus strain a <dig> was subcloned into the pacyc <dig> plasmid and then electroporated into e. coli dh5α. this plasmid was subsequently transferred to the vibrio strain by conjugation. we utilized two strains for those experiments addressing heterologous expression: v. scophthalmi a <dig> and v. scophthalmi a <dig>  as measured by both, diffusion assays in agar plates and tlc, expression of the aiia gene in both strains reduced autoinducer accumulation . we constructed a control strain by conjugating the pacyc <dig> plasmid without the aiia gene. as this control strain showed no ahl reduction, we attributed the decreased ahl production in recombinant strains to heterologous expression of the lactonase gene, confirming that these three putative autoinducers possessed an ahl-like structure or were ahl-regulated.

this finding indicates not only that lactonase is expressed in the vibrio strains, but also that its activity results from the hydrolysis of ahl lactone bonds, as has been reported in other bacterial species  <cit> . we demonstrate that this lactonase is able to degrade hydroxylated ahls, such as n-3-hydroxy-c12-hsl, thereby increasing its substrate spectrum. these findings are consistent with other studies that have shown that lactonases from the bacillus genus are characterized by certain variability in their capacity to degrade different ahls  <cit> . this is true for the lactonase from the b. cereus strain, which reduced the concentrations of c6-hsl, oxo-c12-hsl and c4-hsl from p. aeruginosa to non-detectable levels  <cit> .

detection of a luxs synthase in vibrio scophthalmi
the presence of luxs activity in the supernatants from the v. scophthalmi a <dig> strain was assessed by using the v. harveyi reporter strain bb <dig> in a bioluminescence assay. two negative controls were included, consisting of the incubation medium alone, and the medium with the sensor strain. although we tested two different culture media, mtsb and the mpw, the former was discarded due to the fact that some of the components of the mtsb induced the sensor strain producing a false positive reaction. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the maximum induction level for the reporter strain was obtained in those supernatants from v. scophthalmi a <dig> grown in mpw medium, which corresponded to the late logarithmic phase. here, we recorded a maximum induction value of 35% with respect to the positive control used in this assay, v. harveyi bb <dig> 

these molecules were likely to be synthesized by the ai- <dig> synthase luxs, whose coding sequence was determined for v. scophthalmi, and which exhibited a maximum similarity to the v. vulnificus luxs gene . the coding sequence consisted of  <dig> bp, which is common to other luxs sequences from various vibrio species. this sequence was submitted to the genbank database under the accession number . a phylogenetic tree of different vibrio luxs sequences is shown on fig. 5a. the translated sequence revealed that the sequenced luxs gene carried a conserved domain common to luxs sequences found in other species, which is essential for luxs enzymatic activity . the sites 118– <dig>  nkipelney, representing a hypothetical phosphorylation site  <cit> , was also conserved. this domain has already been detected in luxs homologous sequences from escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, yersinia sp., and shigella sonnei, among others  <cit> . all of these findings support the contention that v. scophthalmi possesses a functional luxs synthase.

CONCLUSIONS
this study confirms the presence of quorum-sensing signal molecules in v. scophthalmi from the ahl-based and type  <dig> -based systems. how this bacterium interacts with other bacteria and eukaryotic cells to compete ecologically with other intestinal bacteria present in the fish scophthalmus maximus warrants further investigation. in this way, in vivo and in vitro analyses will be needed, so that we can understand precisely how these different networks are connected.
