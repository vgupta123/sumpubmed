BACKGROUND
the procalcitonin , the precursor for the hormone calcitonin , is composed of 116-aminoacids and has a molecular weight of  <dig> kda. pct was discovered by moya et al. in  <dig>  but its molecular structure was elucidated nine years later  <cit> . the primary structure of whole pct includes some relevant polycationic motifs   <cit> . in sepsis, the marked increase of pct concentration in serum has been reported  <cit> .

the role of pct as mediator of the sepsis cascade received much less attention. a pro-inflammatory activity of pct in the pathogenesis of sepsis has been suggested based on immune-neutralization findings in two animal species  <cit> . an anti-inflammatory effect of pct has been reported in very few studies  <cit> , where the scarcity of the models/outcomes used does not lead to any firm conclusion. when human recombinant pct was added to endotoxin-stimulated human whole blood, there was a marked decrease of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tnfα  <cit> . interestingly, a reduction in il-1β by administration of pct was observed in the same animal model, the septic hamster, used for the first experiment of pct immune-neutralization  <cit> .

lipopolysaccharide , the principal component of the outer leaflet of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, is recognized as the most potent microbial mediator implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis sequelae and septic shock. lipid a, the hydrophobic anchor of lps, produces most of the responses after its detection by toll-like receptor  <dig> .

some lps such as salmonella typhimurium  lps and escherichia coli  lps, are well known endotoxins of rough and smooth chemotype  <cit> . lipid a of s. typhimurium and e. coli lps is a β1′-6-linked disaccharide of glucosamine, phosphorylated at the  <dig> and 4′ positions and acylated at the  <dig>   <dig>  2′, and 3′ positions with r-3-hydroxymyristate  <cit> .

therapeutic strategies for the treatment of septic shock in humans are currently focused on neutralization of the lps molecule and its many deleterious effects  <cit> .

our previous investigations  <cit>  and studies from other researchers  <cit> , demonstrated that antimicrobial peptides, as well as other biological effective molecules sharing a polycationic structure  <cit> , are able to neutralize lps. since pct also presents two/three relevant polycationic motifs, comparable to some of the physical-chemical patterns of such antimicrobial peptides previously studied, we investigated the in vitro interaction between pct and both rough and smooth chemotype lps  <cit>  by limulus amoebocyte lysate  test. as pct was able to significantly decrease lal assay reactivity in both lpss tested, the effects of pct-pre-incubated lps on the release of cytokines in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells  were examined. for this purpose, the mononuclear cell targeting chemokine , as well as th <dig>  th <dig> and treg type cytokines were selected.

RESULTS
lps-neutralizing activity of pct
following incubation of different concentrations of pct with lps for  <dig> minutes, pct at a concentration of  <dig> pg/ml, significantly decreased the lal reactivity of  <dig> pg/ml of both the rough lps chemotype  and the smooth lps chemotype  . higher   or lower  , concentrations of pct did not produce any significant change in lal reactivity of the lps assessed.

pct effects on lps-induced cytokine release
after  <dig> and  <dig> hours incubation of human pbmc with s. typhimurium lps pre-incubated with pct, the release of tnfα, il- <dig>  il- <dig> and mcp- <dig> was simultaneously assessed with a cytokine biochip array.

lps in rpmi  <dig> medium in the absence of pct induced a substantial increase of all the cytokines evaluated in human pbmc at both time points of  <dig> and  <dig> hours as expected.

when lps was pre-incubated with pct at different concentrations, a decrease of the tnfα release was observed for both time points, this reduction was concentration-dependent at  <dig> hours . the lps-induced release of tnfα after  <dig> hours of incubation was significantly reduced by  <dig> ng/ml  and by  <dig> ng/ml  of pct in comparison to lps plus saline-treated pbmc.

following  <dig> hours of incubation, tnfα release stimulated by lps was significantly diminished when pct was used at  <dig> , at  <dig>  and at  <dig> ng/ml .

the levels of mcp- <dig> were drastically reduced after  <dig> hours for all the pct concentrations . moreover after  <dig> hours, the mcp- <dig> release significantly decreased following both  <dig>  and  <dig> ng/ml  of pct . in the same experimental setting, the lps-stimulated release of il- <dig> showed a dose-dependent inhibition by pct at  <dig> h that was significant at a concentration of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> ng/ml  of the polypeptide . after  <dig> hours, this cytokine exhibited slower kinetic. even though the release of il- <dig> by pct/lps-incubated pbmc was significantly  lower than in the supernatant of lps alone-challenged pbmc, the level of this cytokine was still quite low and perhaps not biologically relevant .

the release of il- <dig> was not affected by pct .

direct assay  of cellular viability always indicated a percentage of more than 95% viable cells in any experimental group, even after  <dig> h of pbmc incubation, which would indicate that the observed reduction in cytokine release may not be due to cellular toxicity by pct, lps or both. also cell count was carried out at beginning and at the end of each experiment and these values were not significantly different. therefore a decrease of cell number should be excluded as a possible cause of reduced cytokine release, during the experiments which involved pct.

discussion
the main and novel findings of the present study are the pct-induced decrease of bacterial lps reactivity and the reduction of lps- induced release of some cytokines/chemokines by pct in human pbmc. previous studies from our group  <cit>  and from other investigators  <cit> , demonstrated that antimicrobial peptides  and other biological effective molecules presenting a polycationic structure, can neutralize both the lal reactivity and other effects of lps including cytokine release  <cit> .

an examination of the pct primary structure reveals that relevant polycationic motifs  are present in the whole molecule. therefore, the whole pct molecule may account for binding and neutralizing the lps as well as inhibiting the lps-stimulated mediators.

other structural studies  <cit>  produced a more direct evidence that neutralization of lps follows interactions between on one hand, positively charged and hydrophobic groups of the peptide and on the other hand, phosphates and hydrophobic acyl chains of the conserved lipid a moiety. it has been demonstrated that in the lps-neutralizing peptide, the lipid a binding motif includes a cluster of hydrophobic residues encompassed by basic aminoacids  <cit> .

more recently, other authors underlined the pivotal role of a group of positively charged central residues with hydrophobic aminoacids distributed in the periphery  <cit> . the whole pct used in our study, exhibited a plausible lipid a binding sequence between pro <dig> and pro <dig> <cit> . also a putative lipid a binding sequence can be found between leu <dig> and val <dig> <cit>  as illustrated in figure  <dig> 

it has also been reported that the need for structural amphipathicity is probably not as an essential feature for lps binding/neutralization as is the proximity of certain aminoacids  within a given sequence  <cit> .

the effects of pct on lps reactivity in the lal test model suggest that pct is equally active against both rough and smooth chemotypes. the s. typhimurium strain sl <dig> exhibits a re chemotype lps  that has been previously reported as very toxic in an in vivo experimental model  <cit> . the e. coli 0111:b <dig> has a smooth chemotype endotoxin often used in studies regarding lps binding/neutralization  <cit> . therefore pct targets the lipid a portion which is a common structural feature of these lpss.

since the molecular weight of pct is approximately  <dig>  daltons and the molecular weight of deep rough lps is  <dig>  daltons, the optimal ratio 5: <dig>  associated with lps neutralization and cytokine inhibition would suggest a 1mole:1mole interaction between pct and lps, which could use any of the above mentioned interaction sites available on the pct molecule.

moreover, our results provide the first evidence of the capability of pct to significantly decrease the lps-stimulated release of the treg cytokine il- <dig> and chemokine mcp- <dig> from human pbmc. the pct-induced decrease in the release of tnfα found with this experimental model, agrees with the findings reported using a different in vitro approach  <cit> .

the late and significant decrease of lps-stimulated il- <dig> may suggest a clinically valuable role of pct in the control of this cytokine during late stages of sepsis, often associated with immunoparalysis, when il- <dig> is reported to play a pivotal role  <cit> .

pct and/or its fragment  have been shown to cause some anti-inflammatory effects in some experimental models  <cit> . in contrast, becker et al.  <cit>  reported that pct produced only detrimental effects in the host.

according to our data and data from other investigators  <cit> , in clinical/experimental sepsis the large amount of tnfα production and its detrimental effects for the host may be controlled by pct release. unlike tnfα, which mimics most of the lps-induced signs and symptoms of the sepsis  <cit> , pct did not show any detrimental effects when injected in healthy animals  <cit>  even at high dose. moreover, in septic hamster serum tnfα concentration was not affected by pct administration, which was able to significantly decrease il-1β serum level  <cit> .

a very recent publication on the in vitro effect of pct on whole blood from healthy humans revealed that most of the cytokines evaluated in the supernatant were not affected by pct. only il- <dig> exhibited a substantial increase; whereas tnfα increased to a lesser extent and il- <dig> was significantly reduced by pct. human neutrophils challenged in vitro with several concentrations of pct did not significantly change cytokine release  <cit> .

in human monocytes endogenous tnfα is crucial for subsequent il- <dig> synthesis through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms  <cit> . therefore, reduction of tnfα levels by pct may supposedly result in decreased il- <dig> synthesis. wiedermann et al.  <cit>  reported that pct was able to decrease migration of monocytes towards different chemoattractants including mcp- <dig>  moreover, n-pct has been found to reduce the expression of cd11b, a major integrin involved in monocyte chemotaxis mechanism. our data suggest a novel aspect of the pct-mediated control on monocyte chemotaxis, with a direct decrease of lps-induced mcp- <dig> by pct. based on our results, in the presence of pct, multiple mechanisms would modulate monocyte chemotaxis, reducing systemic inflammatory host response, which might follow exaggerated activation of phagocytes during sepsis  <cit> .

cellular toxicity of pct, lps or pct plus lps should not account for cytokine reduction by pct, because the direct assays of cell viability always indicated a percentage of living cells higher than 95%, even after  <dig> hours of incubation. moreover, studied cytokines would be expected to show substantial changes  with addition of pct alone, but this was not the case. the increase of mcp- <dig> released by pbmc induced by lps is ten to twenty-fold higher than in pct-stimulated pbmc. the latter is not significantly different when compared to unstimulated pbmc incubated for  <dig> h . even more importantly, the highest release of mcp- <dig> is associated to the lowest concentration of pct. also cell count was carried out at beginning and at the end of each experiment and these values were not significantly different. therefore a decrease of cell number should be excluded as a possible cause of reduced cytokine release, during the experiments which involved pct.

despite the interest and novelty of the present findings, the lps neutralization might be only one of the major modulatory mechanisms of pct on “cytokine storm” during sepsis. as the present study is based on an in vitro model, some limitations regarding the drawing of more general conclusions, the extrapolation to the in vivo activity and the potential role of pct in the therapy of systemic inflammatory diseases are acknowledged.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion our data indicate a direct lps neutralizing effect of pct, which suggests a significant pct-induced inhibition on major mediators of the th <dig>  treg and monocyte activation cascade stimulated by lps. any agent, including pct, with the capability to neutralize an early stimulus such as a bacterial product  and reduce the release of sepsis mediators deserves further investigation. these reported findings may provide new insights into biological and clinical events of the physiopathology of sepsis.
