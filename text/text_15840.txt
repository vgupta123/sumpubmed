BACKGROUND
dormancy is a complex phase of plant development that is necessary for survival under unfavorable environmental conditions. according to lang
 <cit> , dormancy is a temporary suspension of visible growth of any plant structures containing meristems and can be divided into five well-defined phases: paradormancy, endodormancy, ecodormancy, and the two transitional phases between para- and endodormancy and endo- and ecodormancy. dormancy transitions are regulated by short photoperiods and/or chilling temperatures. in pear low temperatures have been proven to control dormancy
 <cit> . several excellent studies have investigated the physiological and molecular mechanisms of bud-dormancy transitions in perennial woody and herbaceous plants, including leafy spurge 
 <cit> , poplar 
 <cit> , peach 
 <cit> , apple 
 <cit> , japanese apricot 
 <cit> , chestnut 
 <cit> , grape 
 <cit> , raspberry 
 <cit> , kiwifruit 
 <cit> , and blackcurrant 
 <cit> . these results suggested that bud dormancy involves many biochemical pathways related to photoperiod, temperature, circadian clocks, water, energy, reactive oxygen species, and hormones. several genes involved in dormancy transition have been identified, providing useful references for studying perennial plant dormancy. however, many unresolved questions remain about how many pathways are involved, how they interact, and significant differences in dormancy transition and regulation among species, genotypes, tissues, and environments.

pears  are among the world's most important perennial deciduous fruit trees and have a key feature of transition from growth to dormancy during their annual growth cycles. studies of pear dormancy have focused mainly on the physiological level, including respiration
 <cit> , carbohydrate
 <cit>  and protein metabolism
 <cit> , and chilling requirements
 <cit> . to date, few studies of pear dormancy at the molecular level have been conducted. ubi et al.  isolated two dormancy-associated mads-box  genes and studied their expression patterns during the seasonal endodormancy transition phases in japanese pear 
 <cit> . although these data highlighted the potential of molecular research to understand dormancy in this crop, they were insufficient to elucidate the molecular regulation mechanism. furthermore, with global warming, many fruit trees, including pears, growing in warm areas have suffered from inadequate winter chill and showed advanced springtime and delayed autumnal phenologies, uneven foliation and blossoming, and long blooming periods, which are unfavorable for sustainable pear production
 <cit> . therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms of pear dormancy transitions will greatly assist programs to breed cultivars with lower chilling requirements and to develop agronomic measures to cope with insufficient winter chill.

traditionally, researchers have studied target nucleotide sequences by cloning, sequencing and comparing with known sequences, annotating their functions, then verifying their functions using tools such as rnai, microarrays, and genetic transformation. these methods are very useful, but characterizing a large number of genes in a single experiment is difficult, especially with respect to specific genes. in recent years, rna-sequencing  technology based on pyro- sequencing has become the most popular and powerful tool for species that lack reference genome information. rna-seq is less costly, more efficient, and allows faster gene discovery and more sensitive and accurate profiles of the transcriptome than microarray analysis or other techniques
 <cit> . to better understand the molecular mechanisms of bud dormancy transition in pear trees, we used rna-seq technology to identify and characterize the expression of a large number of genes, especially those differentially expressed during dormancy progression.

the aim of the present study was to gain an understanding of molecular mechanisms during pear bud dormancy and establish a sound foundation for future molecular studies. we sequenced cdna libraries from lateral flower buds of ‘suli’ pear  from endo to ecodormancy stages using illumina deep-sequencing technology. approximately  <dig> m high-quality reads were obtained and assembled into  <dig>  unigenes. furthermore, four digital gene expression  libraries were constructed to compare gene expression patterns in different dormancy states using an upgraded digital gene expression system. the assembled and annotated transcriptome sequences and gene expression profiles will provide valuable resources for the identification of pear genes involved in bud dormancy.

RESULTS
dormancy status of lateral flower buds in pears
to identify differentially expressed genes  during dormancy, the dormancy status of lateral flower buds in pears must be defined. dormancy status on four collection dates was estimated using excised shoots. no bud break was observed on shoots sampled on nov.  <dig> or dec.  <dig>  but more than 50% of the buds had broken on jan.  <dig> and feb.  <dig> . lateral flower buds were determined to be in the endodormant phase on nov.  <dig> and dec.  <dig> and in the ecodormant phase on jan.  <dig> and feb.  <dig> 

illumina sequencing and de novo assembly
to obtain an overview of the pear bud transcriptome during dormancy, a cdna library was generated from rna isolated from buds pooled from nov.  <dig> to feb.  <dig>  then paired-end sequenced using the illumina platform. after cleaning and quality checks, approximately  <dig> m high-quality reads were assembled into  <dig>  contigs . the mean contig size was  <dig> bp. using paired-end joining and gap-filling, these contigs were further assembled into  <dig>  unique sequences with a mean size of  <dig> bp, including  <dig>  clusters and  <dig>  singletons. the size distributions of these contigs and unigenes are shown in additional file
 <dig>  to evaluate the quality of sequencing data, we randomly selected  <dig> unigenes and designed  <dig> pairs of primers  for rt-pcr amplification. each primer pair resulted in a band of the expected size; the identity of all pcr products was confirmed by sanger sequencing.

annotation of predicted proteins
approximately  <dig>  unique sequences were annotated based on blastx  searches of four public databases: ncbi non-redundant  database, swiss-prot protein database, kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database, and gene ontology  database . among them,  <dig>  unique sequences could be annotated with reference to the nr database. based on the nr annotations,  <dig> % of the annotated sequences had very strong homology , and  <dig> % showed strong homology , and an additional  <dig> % showed homology , to available plant sequences . the similarity distribution was comparable, with  <dig> % of the sequences having similarities higher than 80%, while  <dig> % of the hits had similarities of 18–80% . with respect to species,  <dig> % of the unique sequences had top matches to sequences from vitis vinifera, with additional hits to ricinus communis , populus trichocarpa , glycine max , and malus × domestica  .

functional classification
we used go and kegg assignments to classify the functions of the predicted pear unigenes. approximately  <dig>  sequences could be annotated using go, and  <dig>  unigenes could be categorized into three main categories: biological process, cellular component, and molecular function. to our knowledge, the apple  genome has been completed. among the organisms with completely-sequenced genomes, apple is most closely related to pear. therefore, the distribution of go annotations in the pear unigene data was compared with that of the apple genome   using blast2go. the sequences could be categorized into  <dig> go functional groups . the percentages of annotated apple genes assigned to each group generally mirrored those of pear unigenes, reflecting the similar functionalities of their genomes and further highlighting that a large diversity of pear unigenes was represented by these sequences. through sequence comparison, we observed that, although both species were highly similar, significant differences also existed between them.

there were  <dig>  unigenes  that mapped into  <dig> kegg pathways . the maps with highest unigene representation were metabolic pathways , followed by biosynthesis of secondary metabolites , plant-pathogen interactions , and plant hormone signal transduction .

dge library sequencing and mapping sequences to the reference transcriptome database
using the rna-seq technique, we analyzed changes in gene expression at four times during pear bud dormancy. four dge libraries  were sequenced to generate approximately 13– <dig> million clean reads per library after filtering the raw reads. the total number of mapped reads in each library ranged from  <dig> – <dig>  million, and the percentage of these reads ranged from  <dig> – <dig> %. among them, the number of unique match reads ranged from  <dig> – <dig>  million . to confirm whether the number of detected genes increased proportionally to sequencing effort, sequence saturation analysis was performed. a trend of saturation where the number of detected genes almost ceases to increase when the number of reads reaches  <dig> million . we evaluated the randomness of the dge data by analyzing the distribution of reads matching the reference genes
 <cit> , because nonrandom biases for specific gene regions can directly affect subsequent bioinformatics analysis. the randomness of the data was good, with reads evenly distributed throughout the transcriptome . for mrna expression, heterogeneity and redundancy are two significant characteristics. while the majority of mrna is expressed at low levels, a small proportion of mrna is highly expressed. therefore, the distribution of unique reads was used to evaluate the normality of our rna-seq data. as shown in figure
 <dig>  the distribution of unique reads over different reads abundance categories showed similar patterns for all four rna-seq libraries. the similarity distribution had a comparable pattern with more than 43% of the sequences having a similarity of 80%, while approximately 50% of the hits had a similar range .

changes in gene expression profiles among dormancy stages
differences in gene expression at four times during pear bud dormancy were examined, and degs were identified by pairwise comparisons of the four libraries, i.e. nov. 15-vs-dec.  <dig>  nov. 15-vs-jan.  <dig>  nov. 15-vs-feb.  <dig>  dec. 15-vs-jan.  <dig>  dec. 15-vs-feb.  <dig>  and jan. 15-vs-feb.  <dig> . although lateral flower buds sampled on nov.  <dig> and dec.  <dig> were both in the endodormant stage,  <dig>  genes were significantly differentially expressed between these libraries. of these,  <dig>  were down-regulated and  <dig> were up-regulated. between the dec.  <dig> and jan.  <dig> libraries, there were  <dig>  degs, with  <dig> down-regulated and  <dig> up-regulated. a total of  <dig>  degs were detected between the jan.  <dig> and feb.  <dig> libraries, with  <dig> down-regulated and  <dig>  up-regulated, although lateral flower buds sampled on both dates were in the endodormant-released stage. the greatest number of differentially-expressed genes occurred in the jan. 15-vs-feb.  <dig> comparison, followed by nov. 15-vs-jan.  <dig>  dec. 15-vs-feb.  <dig>  nov. 15-vs-feb.  <dig>  nov. 15-vs-dec.  <dig>  and dec. 15-vs-jan.  <dig> 

we analyzed the functions of the most differentially-expressed genes with the expression fold  and false discovery rate  as the threshold in the nov. 15-vs-dec.  <dig>  dec. 15-vs-jan.  <dig>  and jan. 15-vs-feb.  <dig> comparisons  based on ncbi annotations. in the nov. 15-vs-dec.  <dig> comparison, only two of the  <dig> most up-regulated genes  had defined functions in the ncbi database, and only one  of the twenty most down-regulated genes had defined functions. comparing the dec.  <dig> and jan.  <dig> libraries, three of the twenty most up-regulated genes  and one  of the twenty most down-regulated genes had defined functions. between the jan.  <dig> and feb.  <dig> libraries, three of the twenty most up-regulated genes had defined functions, including genes encoding lrr receptor-like serine, phd finger protein, and arabinogalactan-protein; none of the most down-regulated genes had defined functions.

functional classification of degs during dormancy stages
we used go and kegg assignments to classify the functions of degs in pairwise comparisons of cdna libraries during pear dormancy, specifically the nov. 15-vs-dec.  <dig>  dec. 15-vs-jan.  <dig>  and jan. 15-vs-feb.  <dig> comparisons. the deg functions were classed into three go categories. in the cellular component category, ‘plastid thylakoid’, ‘organelle subcompartment’, ‘thylakoid part’, ‘chloroplast thylakoid’, and ‘thylakoid’ were significantly enriched  in all three pairwise comparisons. ten other go terms were significantly enriched only in the dec. 15-vs-jan.  <dig> and jan. 15-vs-feb.  <dig> comparisons . in the molecular function category, only two go, terms ‘heme binding’ and ‘tetrapyrrole binding’, were significantly enriched in all three pairwise comparisons, while ‘monooxygenase activity’ was significantly enriched in the dec. 15-vs-jan.  <dig> and jan. 15-vs-feb comparisons . in the biological process category, no go terms were significantly enriched in all three pairwise comparisons, but ‘photosynthesis’, ‘photosystem ii assembly’, ‘oxidation-reduction process’, and ‘photosynthesis, light reaction’ were significantly enriched in the nov. 15-vs-dec.  <dig> and jan. 15-vs-feb.  <dig> comparisons, and ‘ribosome biogenesis’ and ‘ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis’ were enriched in the nov. 15-vs-dec.  <dig> and dec. 15-vs-jan.  <dig> comparisons .

in the nov. 15-vs-dec.  <dig>  dec. 15-vs-jan.  <dig>  and jan. 15-vs-feb.  <dig> comparisons,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  degs mapped to  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> kegg pathways, respectively. of the  <dig> degs in the nov. 15-vs-dec.  <dig> comparison,  <dig>  mapped to  <dig> pathways . remarkably, specific enrichment of unigenes was observed for  <dig> pathways involved in metabolic processes, such as phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, ether lipid metabolism, ribosome, cutin, suberine and wax biosynthesis, stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis, endocytosis, glycerophospholipid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, zeatin biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis, starch and sucrose metabolism, fructose and mannose metabolism, other glycan degradation, and pentose and glucuronate interconversions. comparing the dec.  <dig> and jan.  <dig> libraries,  <dig>  degs were identified in  <dig> pathways: ribosome, ether lipid metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, endocytosis, plant-pathogen interaction, and metabolic pathways . in the jan. 15-vs-feb.  <dig> comparison,  <dig>  degs were significantly enriched in  <dig> pathways .

clustering analysis of degs during dormancy stages
genes with similar expression patterns are usually functionally correlated. to understand the expression patterns of  <dig> genes that were significantly-differentially expressed  at different times in pear dormancy, cluster analyses of gene expression patterns in the nov. 15-vs-dec.  <dig>  dec. 15-vs-jan.  <dig>  and jan. 15-vs-feb.  <dig> comparisons were performed. these genes were arranged into seven groups . the largest group  comprised the  <dig>  genes, from cl  <dig> to unigene  <dig>  that were up-regulated from nov.  <dig> to dec.  <dig>  down-regulated between dec.  <dig> and jan.  <dig>  then up-regulated again between jan.  <dig> and feb.  <dig>  this group mainly included genes encoding proteins associated with ribosomes, such as 60s ribosomal protein, 40s ribosomal protein, translation initiation factor eif-5a, atp binding protein, and transaldolase.

the second largest group  contained  <dig>  genes, from cl  <dig> to cl  <dig>  that were down-regulated from nov.  <dig> to jan.  <dig> then up-regulated between jan.  <dig> and feb.  <dig>  this group mainly included genes encoding proteins associated with photosynthesis metabolism, such as chlorophyll a/b binding protein, photosystem i reaction center subunit iii, photosystem i reaction center subunit iv a, plastocyanin a, chloroplast oxygen-evolving enhancer protein  <dig>  ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase, cytochrome p <dig>  and magnesium-protoporphyrin ix monomethyl ester cyclase. additionally, zinc finger protein, spl domain class transcription factor, and basic helix-loop-helix domain-containing protein were encoded.

the third largest group  contained  <dig>  genes, from cl  <dig> to unigene  <dig>  that were up-regulated from nov.  <dig> to jan.  <dig>  then down-regulated between jan.  <dig> and feb.  <dig>  this group mainly included genes encoding proteins associated with oxidation-reduction reaction and resistance, such as blue copper protein, 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, cytochrome p <dig>  heat shock protein, glycine rich protein, and dehydrin  <dig> 

in group  <dig>   <dig> genes , from cl  <dig> to unigene  <dig>  were up-regulated between nov.  <dig> and dec.  <dig>  but were down-regulated between dec.  <dig> and jan.  <dig> and between jan.  <dig> and feb.  <dig>  this group mainly involved in genes encoding dehydration-responsive element-binding protein, galactinol synthase  <dig>  and ga2-oxidase.

in group  <dig>   <dig> genes , from cl  <dig> to unigene  <dig>  were down-regulated between nov.  <dig> and dec.  <dig> and between jan.  <dig> and feb.  <dig> but were up-regulated between dec.  <dig> and jan.  <dig>  these genes encoded proteins including fructose-bisphosphate aldolase cytoplasmic isozyme, tyrosine-protein phosphatase siw <dig>  glycerol-3-phosphate transporter, nac domain class transcription factor, wrky domain class transcription factor, and ap <dig> domain class transcription factor.

in group  <dig>  seven genes were down-regulated from nov.  <dig> to dec.  <dig>  but were up-regulated between dec.  <dig> and feb.  <dig>  finally, two genes  were up-regulated from nov.  <dig> to dec.  <dig>  but were down-regulated between jan.  <dig> and feb.  <dig>  of these nine genes, only 2-aminoethanethiol dioxygenase isoform  <dig> and transferase were definitely annotated.

gene expression analysis and q-pcr validation
the rna sampled at four times during bud dormancy provided templates for real-time quantitative pcr  validation. we randomly selected seven degs to demonstrate the rna-seq results . the q-pcr data for these genes were basically consistent with the rna-seq results of the four samples. linear regression  analysis showed a highly significant correlation  which indicated good reproducibility between transcript abundance assayed by rna-seq and the expression profile revealed by q-pcr data .

phylogenetic analysis of dormancy-associated mads-box  genes and their expression variations
a phylogenetic tree constructed using the nucleotide sequences of two unigenes and  <dig> other mads-box genes  revealed that cl  <dig> contig <dig> was more closely related to ppmads13- <dig> of pyrus pyrifolia, whereas cl  <dig> contig <dig> was more similar to ppmads13- <dig> of p. pyrifolia. additionally, the results revealed that the pear dam genes were more closely related to those of prunus species . however, the pear dam genes formed an independent subclade.

based on the phylogenetic analysis, we selected two unigenes  to analyze their expression variations during dormancy. the expression levels of both genes decreased with endodormancy release in lateral flower buds .

discussion
in this study, using rna-seq technology, a ‘suli’ pear cdna library and four dge libraries  were constructed and used to screen degs during dormancy. surprisingly, we obtained  <dig>  unique sequences, and of which  <dig>  could be annotated, in total  <dig>  genes, including  <dig>  clusters and  <dig>  singletons. until  <dig> may,  <dig>  there were only  <dig>  expressed sequence tags  and  <dig>  nucleotide sequences of pyrus plants deposited in genbank. several recent studies have used traditional est analyses to study dormancy in other species. horvath et al.  and mazzitelli et al.  identified nearly  <dig>  genes and  <dig> ests associated with bud dormancy in leafy spurge and raspberry, respectively, using cdna microarrays
 <cit> . leida et al.  identified nearly  <dig> ests associated with bud dormancy in peach by constructing four subtracted-cdna libraries
 <cit> . these ests participated in different metabolic pathways related to photoperiod, temperature, circadian clocks, water, energy, reactive oxygen species, and hormones
 <cit> . to our knowledge, this is the first report to use rna-seq technique to identify large numbers of genes involved in different metabolic pathways in pear bud dormancy. compared with traditional est analyses, rna-seq was less expensive, more efficient, and allowed faster gene discovery in bud dormancy studies.

through rna-seq analysis, we found that the numbers and expression profiles of degs differed at different times during dormancy. a total of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  genes were differentially expressed between nov.  <dig> and dec.  <dig>  dec.  <dig> and jan.  <dig>  and jan.  <dig> and feb.  <dig>  respectively. these results showed that the number of degs was fewer in the endodormant stage  than in the ecodormant stage , increased with endodormancy-release to reach a maximum by feb.  <dig>  hedley et al.  reported that gene activity was lowest in the early stages of dormancy and peaked around the time of bud break in blackcurrant 
 <cit> . by analyzing kegg pathways, we found degs that participated in several different pathways. some pathways  had been previously correlated to bud break in other species
 <cit> , and some like phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis, zeatin biosynthesis, ether lipid metabolism, endocytosis, and glycerophospholipid metabolism were associated with bud break for the first time in this study. these data may suggest new research directions for understanding bud dormancy.

some of the genes found in this work had been previously identified in other perennial plants. the dam genes, widely described in perennial species such as leafy spurge
 <cit> , peach
 <cit> , raspberry
 <cit> , japanese apricot
 <cit> , kiwifruit
 <cit> , and japanese pear
 <cit> , are candidates for internal factors controlling endodormancy. in this study, we also found two dam genes, and phylogenetic analysis revealed that cl  <dig> contig <dig> was more closely related to ppmads13- <dig> of pyrus pyrifolia, whereas cl  <dig> contig <dig> was more similar to ppmads13- <dig> of pyrus pyrifolia.changes in the expression of cl  <dig> contig <dig> and cl  <dig> contig <dig> decreased with endodormancy release in lateral flower buds were consistent with the findings of earlier work comparing ppmads13- <dig> and ppmads13- <dig> gene expression in lateral leaf buds of japanese pear
 <cit> , ppdam <dig> and ppdam <dig> in lateral vegetative buds and lateral flower buds of peach
 <cit> , and all pmdams  in lateral vegetative buds of japanese apricot
 <cit> . our study, along with previous studies, suggested that dam genes might play significant roles in the regulation of bud dormancy in ‘suli’ pear.

the accumulation of dehydrin  is known to be associated with freezing tolerance in plants
 <cit> . recent studies have reported that the accumulation of dhns in woody plants correlates with seasonal transitions in dormancy and cold acclimation stages during winter
 <cit> , but characterizations of dhn genes expressed during dormancy are limited. yakovlev et al.  found a reduction in the transcript levels of most of the  <dig> dhns that they cloned as norway spruce neared bud-burst
 <cit> . garcia-bañuelos et al.  reported that transcripts of apple dhn were highly expressed in bark and bud tissues when the plant was dormant and cold hardy in midwinter, but were not expressed in early spring when cold hardiness was lost and buds were growing
 <cit> . recently, several studies have identified dhn genes that were activated by aba and c- repeat binding factor  in response to abiotic stresses
 <cit> . intriguingly, in leafy spurge, aba levels were elevated during endodormancy but dropped following the transition to ecodormancy
 <cit> . horvath et al.  found that cbf genes involved in cold regulated were up-regulated during the transition from para- to endo-dormancy
 <cit> . in the present study, one gene  encoding dehydrin showed significantly higher expression during the transition from endo- to eco-dormancy; thereafter, the expression level of this gene rapidly decreased, as indicated by dge analysis and q-pcr data. based on previous studies, we speculated that dhn genes may act as signals and offer some protection for ‘suli’ pear after the end of endodormancy, when pear often encounters unfavorable environmental conditions, such as cold. therefore, more attention should be paid to aba and cbf, which activate dhn genes, in future studies of transcriptional regulation related to the pear dormancy process.

generally, sugar transport is thought to occur via h+/sugar symports that depend on a ph gradient generated by a plasma membrane h+-atpase
 <cit> . gevaudant et al.  examined expression of the four h+-atpase genes and reported that the levels of three h+-atpase gene mrnas increased, whereas the level of one h+-atpase gene decreased in vegetative buds of peach trees after dormancy release
 <cit> . mazzitelli et al.  demonstrated that the plasma membrane h+-atpase gene was highly expressed during the dormancy transition
 <cit> . our results showed that the expression of a plasma membrane h+-atpase gene  was up-regulated in pear buds during the endodormant maintenance period, down-regulated during endodormancy-release, and then up-regulated again. the expression patterns of plasma membrane h+-atpase in ‘suli’ pear were different from those of peach and raspberry buds, perhaps due to species-level or tissue-level differences.

in the present study, some genes encoding galactinol synthase , plastocyanin a , chlorophyll a/b binding protein , and s-adenosylemethionine decarboxylase  were differentially expressed. of these, chlorophyll a/b binding protein and s-adenosylemethionine decarboxylase were previously reported in other perennial plants
 <cit> . the expression levels of these genes changed significantly during the dormancy process. thus, these genes may play roles in the regulation of bud dormancy in ‘suli’ pear.

in addition, differentially-regulated transcription factors were identified in this study, including ap <dig> , zn-finger , nac , wrky , spl , and bhlh . of these, ap <dig>  zn-finger, and nac were previously reported in leafy spurge
 <cit>  and peach
 <cit> . based on dge analysis, the expression levels of the genes encoding these transcription factors significantly changed during dormancy in ‘suli’ pear.

although the molecular mechanisms associated with dormancy transitions in pear trees remain largely unknown, the present transcriptome analysis provided valuable information that could facilitate future studies on the detailed molecular functions of genes related to pear bud dormancy.

CONCLUSIONS
we obtained transcriptome data that provided comprehensive sequencing and dge profiling data for a dynamic view of transcriptomic variation during the dormancy stage in pear. physiological processes such as phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis, zeatin biosynthesis, ether lipid metabolism, endocytosis, glycerophospholipid metabolism, photosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism were all differentially regulated during bud dormancy. approximately  <dig> genes involved in many metabolic processes were significant differentially regulated during bud dormancy. genes related to bud dormancy and their expression profiles at four time-points during dormancy were analyzed further. this offered new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying pear bud dormancy. this provided a relatively complete molecular platform for future research on the progression of pear bud dormancy. to our knowledge, this work is the first to study pear bud dormancy using rna-seq.
