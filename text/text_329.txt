BACKGROUND
annexins form a family of structurally related proteins, which bind to negatively charged phospholipids in a ca2+-dependent manner  <cit> . they are characterized by a bipartite structure with a conserved c-terminal core domain and a unique n-terminal domain that varies in length and amino acid composition. the c-terminal domain is formed by either a four- or eightfold repeat of approximately  <dig> amino acids, each repeat carrying a ca2+-binding site, and is responsible for phospholipid binding. the n-terminal regions are thought to confer functional diversity to the annexin proteins  <cit> . the biochemical features in vitro were analyzed extensively, but the in vivo functions of annexins remain unclear.

annexin a <dig>  the first annexin to be described, was isolated as the agent that mediated aggregation of chromaffin granules and fusion of membranes and phospholipids in the presence of ca2+-ions  <cit> . expression studies demonstrated the distribution of annexin a <dig> in a wide variety of tissues and cells mainly enriched in the cytosol in close association with membranous structures, but it was also described in the nucleus of adrenal chromaffin cells  <cit> . the presence of an alternatively spliced cassette exon gives rise to two annexin a <dig> isoforms corresponding in molecular mass to  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda. the isoforms differ in their n-terminal domain and exhibit a tissue-specific expression pattern. the  <dig> kda isoform is present in all tissues except for skeletal muscle, where the  <dig> kda isoform is exclusively present. heart muscle, brain tissue and red blood cells contain both isoforms  <cit> . previous studies indicated that the subcellular localization of annexin a <dig> changes during myoblast differentiation. in undifferentiated cells the protein is equally distributed between cytosol and membrane fractions while in differentiated cells it is exclusively present in the membrane fraction  <cit> . reports by clemen et al.  <cit>  and herr et al.  <cit>  demonstrated roles for annexin a <dig> in shape and osmotic resistance of red blood cells, platelet aggregation velocity, and in the velocity of spreading astrocytic ca2+-waves. annexin a <dig> is also involved in the maintenance of regular cardiac electrophysiology and ca2+-homeostasis . detailed reports on appearance and distribution of annexin a <dig> during brain development are not available. in the present study we focus on the distribution of annexin a <dig> in the developing brain of mice embryos between e <dig> and e <dig>  and in the adult mouse brain.

RESULTS
annexin a <dig> is expressed in the early mouse embryo
first we examined the expression of annexin a <dig> in es cells  and the early stages of mouse embryonic development at the mrna level by northern blot analysis and at the protein level by western blotting and immunohistochemistry, respectively. northern blot analysis shows in es-cells and at embryonic days e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  and e <dig> two mrna species of  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb, which result from alternative splicing in the untranslated 3'end   <cit> . we found similar annexin a <dig> mrna levels in the four embryonic stages. reprobing with a β-actin probe verified equal loading; the appearance of a faster migrating mrna species in addition to the  <dig>  kb species is characteristic for β-actin  <cit> . on the protein level, es cells express only the smaller annexin a <dig> isoform of  <dig> kda .

immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of the protein during early development. annexin a <dig> immunoreactivity using mab 203– <dig>  which specifically recognizes both isoforms of annexin a <dig>  can be observed in the two cell types of the cylinder stage at e <dig> with a weaker annexin a <dig> expression in the ectoderm . at e <dig> annexin a <dig> can be detected in almost all tissues of the embryo . a correlation between the presence of annexin a <dig> and the origin of a cell type from one of the three germ layers is not apparent. we specifically noted the localization of the protein in the neuroepithelium of the neural fold and tube . at the subcellular level, annexin a <dig> was present in punctate structures mainly in the cytosol of all examined cells . this distribution was also observed during subsequent development.

annexin a <dig> changes its subcellular localization in the embryonic brain at e16
next we analysed the cellular and subcellular distribution of annexin a <dig> in the developing mouse brain . at e13–e <dig> in transverse sections of the embryonic brain, most of the immunoreactive cells are present in the ventricular germinative zone surrounding the lateral ventricle . a closer inspection revealed that annexin a <dig> is mainly localized in the cytosol at e <dig> . during further development the immature cells have rounded up two days later, but they retain annexin a <dig> in the cytosol at e <dig> . at e <dig> we observed the first prominent nuclear staining of annexin a <dig>  in cells of the intermediate zone , which contains neurons radially migrating towards the growing neopallium cortex  <cit>  and also glial cells forming the white matter of the adult cortex. cells located marginally in the neopallial cortex also exhibit a nuclear stain. labelling in the ventricular germinative zone is less prominent and the cytosol is no longer more strongly stained than the nucleus.

mature neurons in adult mouse brain show an intense nuclear staining of annexin a7
both annexin a <dig> isoforms are found in adult brain tissue . in general, we observed two characteristic staining patterns for annexin a <dig>  a prominent nuclear stain in neurons  and a cytoplasmic and nuclear stain in astrocytes  in all areas of the mature murine brain. in the neocortex  annexin a <dig> was strongly enriched in nuclei of neurons of all six cortical laminae . for control, in the adult brain type- <dig> astrocytes can be characterized by a positive gfap-stain . fig. 4f demonstrates the presence of nuclear annexin a <dig> in a neocortical neuron of the external granular layer  and in an astrocytic cell of the neocortical molecular layer  which additionally exhibits an intense signal in the cytoplasm and in cellular branches. a further cell type of the isocortex showed a strong immunoreactivity in both, nucleus and cytosol, and was identified as pyramidal neuron based on morphology and absence of gfap immunoreactivity. however, annexin a <dig> apparently is more enriched in the nucleus .

in the hippocampal formation we detected prominent annexin a <dig> immunostaining in the stratum pyramidalis and in the dentate gyrus and also a weak astrocytic staining . the astrocytes are mainly localized in the area between cells exhibiting nuclear annexin a <dig> staining and show the protein also in the nucleus and the cytoplasm . when we analyzed the pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus at a higher magnification we found that annexin a <dig> again mainly localized to the nuclei . polyclonal antibodies gave a similar staining pattern . the intense nuclear staining was absent in controls either stained only with the secondary antibody  or in brain sections derived from anxa7-/- mice stained for annexin a <dig> . the residual staining seen in the anxa7-/- brain is unspecific as it is also present in corresponding negative controls lacking the primary antibody. the absence of annexin a <dig> protein in brain and other tissues of the anxa7-/- mouse has been verified in  <cit> . in another actual study of the knock out mouse we detected a thickened basal membrane and a widened intercellular space. this may cause unspecific binding of the secondary antibody.

an equal staining of annexin a <dig> was also found in the cerebellum . nuclei of neurons in the stratum granulosum show the most prominent staining . in the stratum moleculare, which is poor in cell bodies of neurons, only a few dots appear which also correspond to nuclei of neurons. astrocytes are also positive for annexin a <dig> in the nuclei and cytoplasm . the signal of the pial border and the prominent stain of the white matter tracts  are due to annexin a <dig> positive astrocytes . higher magnification of the boundary layer between stratum moleculare and granulosum  revealed an annexin a <dig> signal in nuclei, but also in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane of purkinje cells . the typical pair of dendrites points to the margin of the cerebellar cortex. the specificity of the annexin a <dig> signal was further confirmed in similar brain sections of the anxa7-/- mouse . fig. 5g shows annexin a <dig> in neurites  connecting the laminae medullares with the purkinje-cell layer. most likely these are the axons of the purkinje-cells. apart from these efferent neurites the laminae medullares  contain afferent mossy and climbing fibers. thus, the intense stain of the cerebellar white matter arises from annexin a <dig> located in astrocytes and neurites.

expression of annexin a <dig> in the adult human isocortex
in the human parietal neocortex of aged individuals without any neuropathological alterations, subpial astrocytes exhibited a staining of annexin a <dig> in the cytoplasm. a nuclear presence of annexin a <dig> was limited to single astrocytes . pyramidal neurons, predominantly those of layer v exhibited annexin a <dig> at the plasma membrane of their perikaryon as well as of the apical dendrite . the neurons lacked a signal for annexin a <dig> in their nuclei. apical dendrites within the molecular layer also indicated a positive staining for annexin a <dig> . the staining pattern of annexin a <dig> in the human autopsy brain did not change after pre-treatment with trypsin.

presence of annexin a <dig> in nuclei from neuronal and astroglial cells
the nuclear localisation of annexin a <dig> in mice observed in immature cells at e <dig> and differentiated adult neurons could be only detected as a strong signal when the brain sections were pre-treated with trypsin before antibody staining. this procedure is thought to allow the antibodies to access epitopes masked by the formaldehyde fixation. methanol fixation of cultured cells led to inconsistent results. antigen retrieval in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sections employs various heating or proteolytic pre-treatment methods . these methods can result in moderate or strong specific antibody staining, but the detectability of other antigens might be decreased. moreover, the optimal pre-treatment has to be individualised for each antigen.

to verify the presence of endogenous annexin a <dig> in nuclei, we used a biochemical approach and purified nuclei from neuro-2a, pc- <dig>  and c <dig> cells and treated them with a hypotonic extraction buffer to obtain the nucleoplasm . the nucleoplasm and the remaining nuclei, from which the nucleoplasm has been extracted partially, were subjected to sds-page and western blotting. western blots probed with mab 203– <dig> showed annexin a <dig> in the nucleoplasm of neuronal  and astroglial  cell lines , however, the large isoform could only be clearly extracted with nucleoplasm from c <dig> cells. for control, antibodies against lap2α, emerin and tubulin were used to verify that the nucleoplasm  was successfully extracted and also not contaminated by nuclear membranes  or by cytoplasm . likewise, in these neuronal and astroglial cell lines annexin a <dig> had been observed in the nucleus by immunofluorescence . we noticed no difference between pc- <dig> and neuro-2a cells, however, as for the brain sections, we found an increase of the annexin a <dig> staining after pre-treatment with trypsin.

discussion
in the present study we explored the appearance of annexin a <dig> during mouse development at the mrna and protein level and focused on the central nervous system during embryogenesis. northern blot and immunohistochemistry analysis show the expression of annexin a <dig> in all embryonic tissues from day e <dig> on, the earliest day studied. differentiating cells, like the neural ectoderm, which is the origin of the cells belonging to the nervous system, show annexin a <dig> immunoreactivity mainly in the cytosol. endodermal as well as mesodermal cells exhibit a similar subcellular localization of the protein.

in the developing brain we noted a striking change in the subcellular distribution of annexin a <dig>  cells in the stratum germinativum of the neopallial cortex, which surrounds the lateral ventricle, show at e <dig> and e <dig> a staining for annexin a <dig> mainly in the cytosol. but this staining largely disappears and at the following day e <dig> we detect annexin a <dig> in the nucleus of cells in the intermediate and marginal zone of the neopallium. the different expression patterns of annexin a7-positive cells from the ventricular germinative zone to the marginal zone of the later neocortex observed in this study are similar to the developmental patterns of tenascin-c-positive astroglial precursors following the guidance of the radial glial cells  <cit> . moreover, the patterns resemble that of migrating and differentiated neurons described by berry et al.  <cit> . neurons that are generated prenatally in the proliferative ventricular layer of the neopallial cortex subsequently migrate through the intermediate zone to form the different cortical cell layers in a declining inside-out gradient of cell maturation. these observations suggested that the subcellular localization of annexin a <dig> depends on developmental stage and cell type.

in the adult brain we generally observed a nuclear localization for annexin a <dig> in neurons whereas astrocytes exhibited both a cytosolic as well as a nuclear staining. however, pyramidal neurons of the isocortex and purkinje-cells of the cerebellum exhibited a cytosolic stain of intermediate intensity including their neurites and dendrites. we have previously reported the expression of annexin a <dig> in human temporal neocortex and hippocampus obtained from neurosurgery for therapy-refractory epilepsy and found the two annexin a <dig> isoforms restricted to the cytoplasm and nuclei of astrocytes, whereas neurons lacked any signal  <cit> . the hippocampal area showed typical signs of ammon's horn sclerosis, but the adjacent temporal neocortex tissue did not show any histopathological alterations. this data is in discrepancy with our actual observation in the murine brain. to determine if this is due to different methods in immunofluorescence staining or indeed different expression patterns in mouse and human, we repeated the immunofluorescence of human brain. this time we investigated sections from human parietal cortex of autopsy brain. the astroglial expression of annexin a <dig> could be confirmed, although not all astrocytes exhibited the nuclear staining. pyramidal neurons however indicated a distinct staining of annexin a <dig> most prominent along their dendrites. the different results obtained for the neurons may be explained by the fact that we previously used frozen tissue sections or that they were derived from patients suffering from temporal lobe epilepsia. on the other hand the actual human brain tissue used was from aged patients and did not correspond to the age of the mice included in this study. in cultured cells after cell damage or apoptosis  or in cells treated with a ca2+-ionophore annexin a <dig> translocated from the cytoplasm to cellular membranes  <cit> . we therefore favor the hypothesis that annexin a <dig> in the sensitive neurons of the human autopsy brain may have similarly translocated to the cellular membrane. this property of translocation and membrane binding is common to all annexins and commercially available kits for apoptosis detection employ recombinant annexina <dig>  the presence of nuclear annexin a <dig> in murine brain was confirmed by controls using sections from the anxa7-/- mouse and by a biochemical extraction of the protein from the nucleus. both annexin a <dig> isoforms described in brain tissue seemingly are expressed by neurons and astrocytes, which was shown using total cell extracts of cultured neuo-2a, pc- <dig>  and c <dig> cells. in addition to their expression in brain, both annexin a <dig> isoforms have only been described in heart muscle and red blood cells  <cit> .

although the inactivation of the annexin a <dig> gene did not interfere with the viability and development of knock out mice  <cit> , their generation allowed us to address the role of annexin a <dig> in specific cell types  <cit> . indeed, when we analyzed primary astrocytes from an anxa7-/- mouse for ca2+-dependent signaling processes, we found that they exhibited a significantly increased velocity of mechanically induced astrocytic ca2+-waves as compared to wild type  <cit> . this led us to propose, that annexin a <dig> can act as a ca2+-buffer and is involved in ca2+-homeostasis. in neurons ca2+ ions play major roles in various physiological and pathophysiological processes  <cit> . one can speculate about an involvement of annexin a <dig> in the regulation of these ca2+-dependent processes, propositions that need further investigation. however, such roles are confirmed for heart function by studies of schrickel et al. , who described an involvement of annexin a <dig> in the maintenance of a regular cardiac electrophysiology and ca2+-homeostasis.

an altered subcellular location during embryogenesis was also reported for annexin a <dig>  the developing gray matter of the rat embryonic spinal cord exhibited primarily nuclear localization of annexin a <dig>  while immunoreactivity was lost from the nuclei in the adult spinal cord  <cit> . in contrast, our studies show a relocation of annexin a <dig> from the cytosol to the nucleus in cells of the embryonic neuronal tissue. the annexin a <dig> distribution is determined by a variety of factors. an important one appears to be ca2+, which promotes binding of annexin a <dig> to membranes and also allows aggregation of annexins  <cit> . binding partners of annexin a <dig> such as sorcin might represent additional factors  <cit> . although the members of the annexin family are generally found at the plasma membrane, in the cytoplasm or in association with the cytoskeleton, annexins a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> have been described to be localized at least partially in the nucleus  <cit> . studies with human foreskin fibroblasts demonstrated that annexin a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> are all present in the nucleus at higher concentration than in the cytosol  <cit> . raising intracellular ca2+ led to relocation of these annexins to the nuclear membrane. an important role for annexins in mediating the ca2+-signal within the nuclei of the fibroblasts was proposed. these results mirror studies with stably transfected c <dig> cells, in which high intracellular ca2+-concentrations induced a marked redistribution of annexin a <dig> from its localization in the nucleoplasm to the nuclear membrane  <cit> .

none of the annexins contains a typical nuclear localization signal and their mechanism of nuclear import remains to be elucidated. for annexin a <dig> it was shown that nuclear localization is mediated by its n-terminal region, which also contains a binding side for the s <dig> protein calcyclin  <cit> . more recently tomas and moss  <cit>  showed, that annexin a <dig> and s100a <dig> assemble at the nuclear envelope during nuclear breakdown. their role in this process is not known. in general it seems that the nuclear localization of the annexins is actively regulated. for example the nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalization of annexin a <dig> is controlled by sequestration of the anxa2/p <dig> complex modulated by phosphorylation and by a nuclear export signal found in the anxa <dig> 3– <dig> region  <cit> . one function of annexin a <dig> in the nucleus, that appears not to involve binding of p <dig>  has been suggested by its purification as part of a primer recognition protein complex that enhances dna polymeraseα-activity in vitro  <cit> . the annexins may participate in a nuclear response to initial cell stimulation or to a ca2+-transient, presumably by regulating dna replication. for annexin a <dig> such a pathway is very speculative at the moment. future studies are however directed by these findings and will concentrate on the identification of the nuclear localization signal of annexin a <dig> as well as on the role of annexin a <dig> in the nuclear compartment.

CONCLUSIONS
in this article we report the translocation of annexin a <dig> to nuclei of differentiating cells in the developing murine brain. in the adult brain annexin a <dig> generally was detected in nuclei of neurons. astrocytes, cerebellar purkinje-cells and neocortical pyramidal neurons exhibited both, annexin a <dig> in the cytosol and in the nuclei. thus, the subcellular localisation of annexin a <dig> depends on the developmental stage and the cell type. a role of annexin a <dig> as well as of other annexins in nuclei remains speculative. the results obtained by immunofluorescence were confirmed by extraction of annexin a <dig> from nuclei of neuronal and glial cell lines.
