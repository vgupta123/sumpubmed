BACKGROUND
lignin content is well known as a major factor affecting forage quality in maize. however, correlations between lignin content and forage quality can be variable according to the genetic background  <cit> . moreover, breeding for a higher digestibility of maize involves also other, so far unknown mechanisms  <cit> . correlations between maize whole plant digestibility and cell-wall  digestibility ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with average values close to  <dig> , whereas correlations between whole-plant digestibility and grain or ear content were close to  <dig>   <cit> . therefore, cell-wall digestibility is the major target for improving the feeding value of forage maize. an understanding of the molecular basis for cell-wall digestibility is crucial towards breeding of highly digestible maize.

an important first step to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cell-wall degradability is to identify causative genome regions. five major qtl clusters involved in cell-wall digestibility, located on chromosomal bins  <cit>   <dig> ,  <dig> / <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , were identified by several qtl analyses, but the genes underlying these qtl are not yet known  <cit> . a second, more recent approach is transcriptome analysis to simultaneously measure the expression of thousands of genes. in comparison with normal maize genotypes, brown-midrib  mutants show a significantly reduced lignin content, altered lignin composition, and/or a significantly higher cell-wall digestibility  <cit> . molecular mechanisms underlying cell wall digestibility in maize have been studied in three sets of maize brown-midrib isogenic lines in the genetic background of inbreds  <dig> ,  <dig> , and f <dig>   <cit> .  <dig> ests were differentially expressed in all three isogenic bm <dig> comparisons, whereas  <dig> ests were consistently differentially expressed in different bm isogenic lines in f <dig> background. moreover, gene expression studies can be conducted on phenotypically extreme lines from mapping populations. replicate pools of extreme lines can be profiled independently, so that differences in gene expression will be specific to the differing pools. this strategy was recently used to identify candidate genes for drought response qtl in rice  <cit> . thus, by synthesis of expression profiling data from bm mutants and extreme lines of a mapping population segregating for cell wall digestibility, it should be possible to identify candidate genes related to cell-wall degradability, and to construct a microarray enriched for candidate genes underlying cell wall digestibility. transcriptome analysis using such microarrays would provide a fingerprint of cell-wall metabolism in maize.

genetic and gene expression approaches have been joined in the concept of "genetical genomics"  <cit> , which aims to detect eqtl  controlling gene expression differences. often, eqtl map to the genetic position of the respective gene itself, indicating that cis changes  are responsible for the different levels of expression. in contrast, genes revealing  eqtl at positions different from the genetic position of the respective gene are thought to be regulated by, e.g., trans-acting factors controlling their expression levels  <cit> . detection of the master regulators, affecting expression levels of groups of genes, is a major feature of eqtl studies  <cit> . in plants, this strategy has been successfully applied to  <dig> maize lines in a f <dig> population  <cit>  and  <dig> poplar lines in a backcross population  <cit> , respectively. altogether, combining expression profiling with genetic analysis could enrich our understanding of regulatory networks underlying cell-wall digestibility and assist plant breeders to choose the most relevant genomic targets for improvement of silage maize digestibility.

the objectives of our study were to 1) select candidate ests for cell-wall digestibility to establish a "forage quality array", 2) identify ests differentially expressed between low and high digestible lines in a flint Ã— flint mapping population, and 3) detect eqtl using the "genetical genomics" approach.

RESULTS
selection of candidate ests in association with cell wall digestibility
in order to identify genes in association with cell-wall digestibility in maize, three sources of genetic material were used, including 1) three sets of brown-midrib isogenic lines in the genetic background of inbreds  <dig> ,  <dig> , and f <dig>   <cit> , 2) the contrasting extreme lines of fd, dd <dig>  and dd <dig> dh mapping populations, and 3) two isogenic inbreds, as <dig> and as <dig>  significantly differing in cell wall digestibility. two complementary approaches, ssh  and microarray-based expression profiling, were used to isolate and identify candidate genes in all comparisons. about 70% of the ests isolated by ssh were absent on the unigene microarray  <cit> .

the number of at least two-fold induced ests in stems from ssh and microarray analyses, respectively, were  <dig> and  <dig> in fd-pop ,  <dig> and  <dig> in dd1-pop,  <dig> and  <dig> in dd2-pop, as well as  <dig> and  <dig> in as <dig> vs. as <dig> . in fd-pop,  <dig> ests were jointly differentially expressed both in ssh and microarray experiments, as well as  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> ests in dd1-pop, dd2-pop, and as <dig> vs. as <dig>  respectively. the numbers of genes simultaneously differentially expressed in pairs of mapping populations were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively.  <dig> ests were consistently differentially expressed across the three mapping populations.

in total,  <dig> distinct ests differentially expressed in one or multi- comparisons were identified. in order to verify the most interesting of those genes at low costs, a small microarray specific for cell wall digestibility  was designed. the first selection criterion  covered jointly differentially expressed ests both in ssh and microarray experiments for each comparison . secondly,  <dig> ests were selected with a more than five-fold change in respective comparisons. thirdly,  <dig> est homologues of lignin-related genes, pal, 4cl, c3h, ccoaomt, ccr, comt, and cad, were spotted. subsequently,  <dig> ests in silico mapping to chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were chosen, since bm <dig>  bm <dig>  and bm <dig> map to these chromosomes. finally,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> consistently differentially expressed ests in  all three bm3-isogenic comparisons ,  all three isogenic comparisons in f <dig> background , and  three mapping populations, respectively, were selected. according to the above mentioned criteria,  <dig> different candidate ests were identified towards production of the forage quality array.

out of  <dig> candidate ests,  <dig> were not available for ordering, and for  <dig> ests it was not possible to obtain high-quality pcr products due to poor bacteria recovery, unspecific pcr amplification, etc. finally,  <dig> ests were included on the forage quality array. go vocabularies were assigned according to the tigr maize gene index  <cit> . 66% of these ests  could not be functionally classified. among  <dig> classified ests, the largest category was "catalytic activity"  . further ranking of classification categories was "binding" , "structural molecule activity" , and "transporter activity" .

using hierarchical cluster analysis based on the est tree, distinct expression patterns between high and low quality groups were found for most ests included on the forage quality array . using t-tests with a p value cutoff of  <dig> ,  <dig> ests were significantly different between the two groups of high and low quality lines, including  <dig> down- and  <dig> up-regulated ests in the high quality group, respectively . out of  <dig> down-regulated ests in the high quality group,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> ests were classified into "chaperone activity", "catalytic activity", and "binding", respectively, whereas  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> ests of up-regulated ests were classified into "motor activity", "catalytic activity", "structural molecular activity", "transporter activity" and "binding", respectively. according to the current annotation in the tigr maize gene index  <cit> , four ests encoded enzymes involved in lignin biosynthesis, cd <dig> , cd <dig> , aw <dig>  and cf <dig> . in addition, ai <dig>  is a homologue encoding a cellulose biosynthesis related enzyme, and bm <dig>  and bu <dig>  are putative transcription factors.

genetical genomics analysis
 <dig> extreme lines in the ff population with respect to dndf were selected to represent two contrasting high and low quality groups . the dndf mean and sd of the low quality group was  <dig> % and  <dig> , and  <dig> % and  <dig>  in the high quality group.

using interval mapping, eqtl  were detected for 20%  of the tested ests, with a maximum lod score of  <dig> . on average, these eqtl explained 39% of the genetic variation of the corresponding est expression profiles, ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. the number of eqtl per est varied from  <dig> to  <dig> with a mean of  <dig> . for 63%  ests, one to three eqtl were found. for four ests more than  <dig> eqtl were detected. 39%  ests with eqtls were significant for high and low pools as well.

maize genetic maps have been divided into  <dig> segments  of approximately  <dig> cm length  <cit> . in total,  <dig> eqtl were detected in  <dig> bins covering all chromosomes except for chromosome  <dig> . the percentage of eqtl per bin was plotted against chromosomal bins . eqtl hotspots, containing more than 5% of the total number of eqtl, were detected on bins  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> . out of those, bin  <dig>  co-localized with one of five major qtl clusters for cell-wall digestibility , which were identified on bins  <dig> ,  <dig> / <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>   <cit> .

out of  <dig> ests resulting in eqtl, for  <dig> ests bin information from the maize gdb  <cit>  and map positions from maize genome mapping project  <cit>   are known. for another  <dig> ests, only chromosomal but not bin assignment were provided from maize genome mapping project. in silico mapping information indicate that the ests were located in various linkage groups, and generally not in the genetic location of the respective eqtl. aw <dig> , bm <dig> , and ai <dig>  were co-localized with a cell-wall digestibility related qtl cluster on bin  <dig> .

discussion
power of eqtl analysis
an essential first step in qtl analysis is to assess how many samples must be collected in order to achieve sufficient power to detect a hypothetical effect. eqtl mapping is different from qtl mapping of complex inherited traits, since we expect  major eqtl due to 1) eqtl in cis , and 2) major regulatory eqtl  in trans. thus, we expect a simpler inheritance of expression patterns of single ests with only one or few eqtl involved, each explaining a comparatively large percentage of the phenotypic variation, in contrast to "true" quantitative characters such as grain yield. major eqtl should be detectable even with this very limited number of rils. in addition, this requirement is particularly salient in eqtl analysis due to the high expenses of gene-expression analyses. in plants, both  <dig> f <dig> families in maize  <cit>  and  <dig> bc <dig> families in poplar  <cit>  were used in respective eqtl analysis. in this study,  <dig> ril lines were used to detect eqtl in the ff population. because of an increased heritability when using homozygous and homogeneous ril lines as compared to segregating f2: <dig> families, an eqtl explaining 28% of the variation in rna abundance among the f <dig> population would be detected in 99% of the experiments with  <dig> ri lines, in contrast to 94% of the experiments performed with  <dig> f <dig> families  <cit> . in addition, at least 73% of the experiments with  <dig> ril lines should detect an eqtl explaining 18% of the phenotypic variance  <cit> . since 79%  identified eqtl explained more than 28% of the transcription variation of the corresponding ests and minimum eqtl explaining  <dig> % transcription variation,  <dig> extreme lines should be sufficient to detect major eqtl. however, the explained phenotypic variance by individual eqtl is very likely overestimated due to the small population size  <cit> .

genetic architecture of transcription
genetical genomics permits quantitative assessment of the proportion of gene loci  displaying co-segregation with the respective eqtl , relative to those that produce unlinked trans-eqtl  <cit> . in maize ear leaf, 34%  differentially expressed genes produced cis-eqtl with lod > <dig>   <cit> . in contrast, no in silico mapped ests were in the same location as their own eqtl in this study . accordingly, no key genes involved in lignin biosynthesis co-localized with cis-eqtl in poplar  <cit> . therefore, trans-acting factors could play a major role in regulating heritable variation of gene expression in cell wall digestibility.

only 26%  ests detected a single eqtl in the present study. for the remaining 74%, two or more eqtl were found . a similar distribution of eqtl was found in yeast  <cit> . only 3% transcripts were consistent with single locus inheritance, 18% suggested control by two loci, and >50% required at least five loci under an additive model. thus, transcriptional variation was generally found to be oligogenic rather than monogenic inherited.

a common feature of eqtl studies is the detection of "hotspots" or hubs of trans-acting eqtl: chromosomal regions that affect the expression of a much larger number of genes than expected by chance  <cit> . eqtl hotspots, containing more than 5% of the total number of eqtl, were found on bins  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  . the strong clustering in hubs of eqtl reflects highly correlated expression levels of many gene transcripts in association with cell-wall digestibility. the five hotspots could contain important transcript factors for cell wall digestibility. however, no obvious transcription factors were found among those genes currently mapped to these bin regions  <cit> . similarly, eqtl identified in yeast frequently resulted from genetic variants that altered activity of a signaling or metabolic pathway without directly altering gene transcription  <cit> . 4cl <dig>  f5h, and ccr <dig> genes involved in lignin biosynthesis map to bin  <dig>   <cit> . these genes are candidates for the eqtl found in the same genome region due to potential metabolic feedback mechanisms acting through the same enzyme in lignin biosynthesis. however, due to the limited understanding of genetic and physiological control of gene expression so far, any conclusions with regard to hotspots for gene regulation should be interpreted with caution  <cit> . kirst et al.  <cit>  found that two eqtl hubs for lignin-related genes co-localized with growth qtl on linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig> in poplar. one eqtl hotspot was co-localized with cell wall digestibility related qtl cluster  <cit>  on bins  <dig>  , implying that in this case the gene underlying qtl and eqtl are identical.

molecular mechanisms underlying cell-wall digestibility
lignin restricts the degradation of structural polysaccharides by hydrolytic enzymes, thereby limiting the bioconversion of forages into animal products  <cit> . out of  <dig> significantly differentially expressed ests between high and low quality groups , four ests encode enzymes involved in lignin biosynthesis, cd <dig> , cd <dig> , be <dig> , and cf <dig> . in agreement with the expectation of low levels of lignin, cd <dig> and cd <dig> were down-regulated in lines with high forage quality. however, be <dig> and cf <dig> were up-regulated, which might be due to the complexity of cell wall biosynthesis. the associations between one lignin characteristic  and cell wall degradability can be confounded and correlated to concurrent changes in other lignin properties  that influence cell wall degradability  <cit> . since reduced cellulose synthesis invoked lignification and defense responses in arabidopsis  <cit> , repressed ests encoding cellulose synthesis enzymes, such as ai <dig>  , could activate lignin synthesis in low quality lines. in addition, four regulatory genes, ai <dig> , bm <dig>  bm <dig> , and bm <dig> , were down-regulated in lines with high forage quality, whereas one regulatory gene, bu <dig>  was up-regulated . these regulatory genes might control cell wall digestibility spatially and temporally among the two groups of lines in the ff population. mapping of these genes will reveal, whether they colocalize with eqtl  identified in this study. furthermore, there are a number of genes, where a connection to digestibility is unclear, some of which might be false positives.

using cellular uv-microspectrophotometry, shi et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that lignin content represented by the absorbance values within the cells of sclerenchyma fiber tissue was decreasing from the periphery to the center. lignin content was lowest in s <dig>  of parenchyma cells, followed by s <dig>  cml  and cc  of sclerenchyma fibers. each cell type in the stem likely expresses a unique transcriptome. transcriptome analysis using complete stems provides average gene expression levels integrated over all cell types. in order to further understand the molecular basis of cell wall degradability, new methods, for instance, laser-capture microdissection  <cit> , are needed for efficient isolation of cc of sclerenchyma fiber from different time points to further validate  <dig> candidate genes.

application of genetical genomics to plant breeding
the use of functional genomics is contributing to many aspects of qtl analysis and cloning  <cit> . to date, most plant qtl have been cloned using a positional cloning approach following identification in experimental crosses. transcriptional profiling can quickly provide a list of differentially expressed genes between contrasting qtl genotypes. subsequently, those genes functionally related to the target trait and mapping to the qtl region can be selected as candidates. unfortunately, the number of qtl cloned to date in plants is too small to test the validity of this approach. if the difference in gene expression level between alleles is too low , the candidate genes cannot be identified using standard microarray-based transcriptome analysis  <cit> . less than 15% of ests were induced more than two-fold by microarray analyses in fd-pop  , dd1-pop  and dd2-pop , respectively. a genetical genomics approach might be better suited for detecting differences in gene expression. 23% of the ests on the forage quality array  were significantly different between low and high digestible  rils. however, this higher proportion of significantly differentially expressed genes identified by the genetical genomics approach is most likely due to successful selection of candidates by the criteria outlined above .

since most of the important agronomic traits are complex inherited traits, transcript abundance may act as an intermediate phenotype between genomic dna sequence variation and complex traits. integration of genome-wide expression profiling with linkage analysis is a new approach to identifying genes underlying complex traits. hubner et al.  <cit>  has demonstrated large-scale identification of positional candidates and regulatory pathways for previously mapped physiological qtl by genetical genomics approach in the rat. cis-acting eqtl are good candidates for physiological qtl because they show line-specific differences in gene expression that are under the control of dna sequence variants in or close to the gene itself  <cit> . similarly, eqtl identified in an intercross of inbred c57bl/6j and dba/2j mice could accurately identify transcripts in which expression was regulated by cis-acting polymorphisms  <cit> . cis-acting eqtl might be detected by additional est mapping or indirectly through the ongoing maize genome sequencing project, since so far only  <dig> of  <dig> ests resulting in eqtl were in silico mapped. trans-acting eqtl represent loci that influence expression of genes or transcripts remote from the eqtl itself. coincidental mapping of trans-acting eqtls for multiple transcripts to the same chromosomal location, as observed on bin  <dig>  , may represent a shared regulatory transcriptional control mechanism by a single gene at the eqtl. the locations of trans-acting eqtl in relation to physiological qtl, together with the locations of cis-acting eqtl, may point to genes and regulatory pathways underlying individual cell wall digestibility related qtl.

however, the scope of genetic analysis of gene expression also presents enormous technical and analytical challenges. extraordinarily large number of comparisons were involved in a genome-wide linkage scan for several hundreds or thousands of transcripts, thus technical and experimental design issues need to be addressed to handle the large data sets that are being generated, and new statistical tools are still being evaluated  <cit> . as the field of genetical genomics develops, it is expected to significantly improve our knowledge about complex traits, such as cell wall degradability  <cit> . therefore, in the future, it is conceivable that qtl cloning will increasingly rely on candidate gene information. comprehensive knowledge of the lignin pathway and cell wall biogenesis will allow plant breeders to choose the best genomic targets controlling these characters, for improving forage digestibility through genetic engineering or marker-assisted selection.

CONCLUSIONS
 <dig> candidate genes for cell-wall digestibility were validated by genetical genomics approach. although the cdna array highlights gene types , trans-acting factors or metabolic bottlenecks seem to play the major role in controlling heritable variation of gene expression related to cell-wall digestibility, since no in silico mapped ests were in the same location as their own eqtl. transcriptional variation was generally found to be oligogenic rather than monogenic inherited due to only 26% ests detected a single eqtl in the present study. one eqtl hotspot was co-localized with cell wall digestibility related qtl cluster on bins  <dig> , implying that in this case the gene underlying qtl and eqtl are identical. as the field of genetical genomics develops, it is expected to significantly improve our knowledge about complex traits, such as cell wall degradability. comprehensive knowledge of the lignin pathway and cell wall biogenesis will allow plant breeders to choose the best genomic targets controlling these characters, for improving forage digestibility through genetic engineering or marker-assisted selection.
