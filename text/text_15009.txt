BACKGROUND
genomic imprinting is the mechanism by which haploid maternal and paternal genomes carry different epigenetic marks, resulting in monoallelic transcription of a subset of genes which are expressed exclusively from either the maternal or paternal allele  <cit> . to date, over eighty imprinted genes have been identified in humans and mice  <cit> . many of these genes are known to have critical roles in embryonic development and placentation  <cit>  and have also been implicated in the regulation of postnatal behaviour  <cit> . the imprinted region on distal mouse chromosome  <dig>  shares syntenic homology with human chromosome 11p <dig> , a region associated with beckwith-wiedemann syndrome  and wilms tumor. bws is an imprinted disorder that is commonly characterized by macroglossia, organomegaly, abdominal wall defects, unusual facial features, hemihypertrophy, hypoglycemia, exomphalos, ear and renal anomalies  <cit> . roughly 5-10% of bws patients are predisposed to a variety of childhood tumours, including hepatoblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, adrenal carcinoma, with wilms tumor occurring most frequently  <cit> .

distal mouse chr <dig> contains several key imprinted genes required for fetal development, two of which are also implicated in the etiology of bws, the paternally expressed insulin-like growth factor- <dig>  gene regulated by imprinting centre  <dig>  located upstream of the maternally expressed h <dig> gene and the maternally expressed cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1c  which is regulated by imprinting centre  <dig>  located within intron  <dig> of the kcnq <dig> gene  <cit> . in addition to cdkn1c, the ic <dig> cluster contains at least eight other maternally expressed genes   <cit> . of these, ascl <dig>  cd <dig>  and osbpl <dig> have been shown to be expressed and exclusively imprinted in the placenta  <cit> . the precise functions, if any, of cd <dig>  osbpl <dig>  tssc <dig>  kcnq <dig> and slc22a <dig> in the placenta remain to be elucidated. however, the remaining genes in the cluster  have well-documented roles in placentation since knockouts of each of these genes result in drastic placental phenotypes. ascl <dig> null mice fail to form a spongiotrophoblast layer, a defect leading to embryonic lethality at e <dig>  <cit> ; phlda <dig> null mice are viable but show an expanded spongiotrophoblast and placentomegaly  <cit> ; cdkn1c mutants possess varying phenotypes including a reduced labyrinth layer, expanded spongiotrophoblast, placentomegaly and perinatal lethality  <cit> .

the mechanism of silencing of several genes both centromeric and distal to the position of the paternal ic <dig> over a large domain is not completely understood, though production and elongation of the ncrna kcnq1ot <dig> is thought to play a critical role in this process  <cit> . kcnq1ot <dig> production is accompanied by recruitment of polycomb group complexes  <cit>  and acquisition of repressive histone modifications  <cit> . these observations suggest similarities with the action of other ncrnas such as the regulation of igf2r by the ncrna airn  <cit>  and x-inactivation by xist  <cit> . the deletion of the paternal ic <dig> leads to activation of ic2-regulated genes on the paternal chromosome and +/ic2ko mice possess a growth restriction phenotype at least in part because of biallelic expression of cdkn1c  <cit> . the placentae of these animals were also reported to be smaller than their wild type litter mates  <cit> . recent studies have also shown that ic <dig> contains ctcf-binding sites which are occupied only on the unmethylated paternal allele however it is still unclear what role these ctcf binding sites might play in silencing the paternal alleles of ic2-regulated genes  <cit> . it is also not known whether the methylated maternal ic <dig> allele is important for the activation of nearby genes.

we previously described an engineered truncation of distal chr  <dig> with a breakpoint upstream of the ins <dig> gene  <cit> . the resultant  <dig> -mb deletion, called deltel <dig>  removes the entire ic2-regulated domain along with the telomeric end of the chr  <dig> domain, replacing it with an artificial telomere. when the deltel <dig> allele is paternally inherited , there is no obvious phenotype, showing absence of paternally expressed imprinted genes required for development or of a haploinsufficiency effect  <cit> . maternal transmission of deltel <dig>  however, leads to a mid-gestational lethality, consistent with the deletion of all maternally expressed genes in the ic2-regulated sub-domain, and is also accompanied by abnormal placentation including the lack of spongiotrophoblast and an expanded trophoblast giant cell layer  <cit> . despite a difference in phenotypic outcome, possibly attributable to the absence of imprinting of essential genes such as ascl <dig> in humans  <cit> , maternal inheritance of deltel <dig> provides a mechanistic model for bws, which is often associated with loss of expression of maternally expressed genes  <cit> . remarkably, we also demonstrated that the lethality observed upon maternal inheritance of this truncation can be rescued in trans by a paternally inherited ic2ko allele, which was previously shown to abolish kcnq1ot <dig> transcription and its associated epigenetic silencing  <cit> . the compound heterozygous deltel7/ic2ko pups survive to term but it is unclear whether any placental abnormalities or defects in placental imprinted gene expression remain in the double mutants. because of the importance of several ic2-regulated genes in placental function and development, we present here a characterization of the rescued deltel7/ic2ko placentae to determine whether they are comparable to their wild type litter mates and whether deletion of ic <dig> leads to a full rescue of the placental phenotype caused by the loss of maternal genes from the deltel <dig> allele. our assessment would have direct implications for bws patients, since placental abnormalities usually accompany bws fetuses  <cit> . by examining the architecture, vasculature, and imprinted gene expression of the rescued deltel7/ic2ko placentae we sought to determine whether it is possible to correct imprinting defects by restoring gene expression for a large number of genes in trans and thereby to further elucidate mechanisms of ic2-mediated epigenetic silencing.

RESULTS
loss of imprinted gene expression in deltel7/+ placentae
the ic <dig> imprinted domain of distal chr  <dig> contains at least several maternally expressed mrna genes and spans almost  <dig> kb. the entire domain is deleted in the deltel <dig> allele, a truncation of chr <dig> with a breakpoint upstream of ins <dig> and deleting the last  <dig>  mb of chr <dig> . we previously showed that maternal transmission of deltel <dig> leads to abnormal placentation and embryonic lethality at e <dig> , whereas paternal hemizygotes are viable  <cit> . we show here by immunohistochemistry for phlda <dig>  as well as quantitative rt-pcr  for the imprinted genes phlda <dig>  ascl <dig>  and cdkn1c, that at e <dig>  deltel7/+ maternal hemizygous placentae are deficient for expression of these ic2-regulated genes. placentae were assessed at e <dig> , before the embryonic lethality of the deltel7/+ embryos. we found only basal transcription levels of expression by qrt-pcr for these ic2-regulated genes in deltel7/+ placentae . wild type levels were quite varied between samples, suggesting dynamic changes in expression at this early developmental stage or effects the genetic heterogeneity present in these crosses on mixed background. note the lack of spongiotrophoblast and the expanded giant cell layer in the deltel7/+ placenta , consistent with what has been published previously regarding the deltel7/+ phenotype  <cit> .

other then the entire ic <dig> sub-domain, deltel <dig> also deletes the very distal end of chr <dig>  this region contains close to  <dig> annotated genes. unlike genes in the ic <dig> and ic <dig> domains, we find that most of these distal genes are not expressed in the placenta at significant levels . the absence of an obvious phenotype in paternal hemizygotes for deltel <dig> argues against haploinsufficiency effects in these mutants.

germline transmission from deltel7/ic2ko mice
ic <dig> is comprised of cpg-rich sequences within intron  <dig> of the kcnq <dig> gene and functions in gene silencing, at least in part, by serving as a promoter for the antisense ncrna kcnq1ot <dig>  we previously showed that paternal transmission of the ic2ko allele can rescue the embryonic lethality phenotype of deltel7/+ embryos  <cit> . the rescued deltel7/ic2ko mice are missing the genes that are normally maternally expressed  but expression of these genes is now supplied from the paternal allele, since the ic2ko allele no longer produces kcnq1ot <dig>   <cit> . we confirmed the absence of kcnq1ot <dig> expression in deltel7/ic2ko embryos and placentae by strand-specific rt-pcr . phenotypic analysis of these compound heterozygous mice therefore allows us to ask the following questions:  are all the maternally-expressed genes required for normal placental development expressed from the ic2ko paternal allele?  is the methylated ic <dig> required in the regulation of maternally-expressed genes on the maternal allele in wild type embryos?

we have previously shown that deltel7/ic2ko pups survive to term, are recovered at the expected frequency and are indistinguishable from their wild type litter mates at birth . we now report that deltel7/ic2ko males and females are fertile and pass on the mutant alleles at expected frequencies in their offspring. deltel7/ic2ko males crossed with wild type  females produce litters of +/deltel <dig> and +/ic2ko pups at roughly equal frequencies . deltel7/ic2ko females crossed with wild type males produce litters of only the ic2ko/+ genotype as expected, since the deltel7/+ genotype is embryonic lethal . mice produced from these crosses do not possess any obvious developmental abnormalities and are able to survive to adulthood. these results demonstrate that the maintenance of imprinting is faithfully recapitulated in each generation and that there are no aberrant effects of transmitting either allele in the context of the compound heterozygotes.

deltel7/ic2ko placentae exhibit normal architecture
because the deltel7/+ genotype results in abnormal placentation, we investigated the histology of several deltel7/ic2ko placentae compared to wild type litter mates to determine whether there were any abnormalities in placentation in the compound heterozygotes. hematoxylin and eosin stain  revealed no apparent abnormalities between deltel7/ic2ko and wild type placentae at e <dig> , suggesting that the deltel7/ic2ko placentae displayed normal placental architecture . to document this in greater detail, we used in situ hybridization  and immunohistochemistry  to analyze the distribution of the several lineage markers in wild type and deltel7/ic2ko placentae. neither ish for the placental lactogen-ii gene prl3b <dig> , a mid- to late gestation marker of both the giant cell layer and mononucleated trophoblast cells of the labyrinth   <cit> , nor ish for tpbpa , a marker of the spongiotrophoblast layer   <cit>  revealed any overall differences in the these layers between the two genotypes.

to determine whether there was a defect in the generation of the glycogen cell  lineage in the deltel7/ic2ko placentae, both periodic acid schiff  stain and ish for protocadherin- <dig> , a gene specifically expressed in gcs  <cit>  were performed . these analyses revealed no difference in the overall number or distribution of gcs between the two genotypes. for a detailed examination of the labyrinth, we performed ihc for laminin, a marker of the basement membrane in the labyrinth used for identifying fetal blood vessels   <cit>  and ish for the imprinted paternally expressed gene  <dig>  which is also expressed in the fetal endothelial cells that line the fetal capillaries . no abnormalities were observed in the cell lineages analyzed or in the fetal capillaries of the labyrinth of deltel7/ic2ko placentae. our results show that deltel7/ic2ko placentae are phenotypically similar to wild type litter mates for the various representative markers analyzed.

to confirm the results of these marker analyses using an independent method, we also performed expression analysis for tpbpa  and peg <dig> qrt-pcr and observed no difference between the two genotypes .

deltel7/ic2ko placentae exhibit normal vasculature
because we had no indication from our lineage marker analysis that the deltel7/ic2ko placentae had a drastically abnormal phenotype, we explored the possibility that they may possess a subtle placental phenotype. one of the most common subtle placental phenotypes is an undervascularized labyrinth, otherwise known as a "small" labyrinth  <cit> . thus in addition to examining placental architecture, we also assessed whether the vascularization of the deltel7/ic2ko placentae was perturbed using the vascular corrosion casting method  <cit> . we found no apparent differences in the overall structure and number of capillaries in the fetal vasculature of deltel7/ic2ko placentae compared to wild type litter mates at e <dig>  . moreover, morphometric analysis of the average capillary diameter revealed no overall difference between deltel7/ic2ko placentae and wild type placentae , with both having an average of approximately  <dig> microns. this measure is in agreement with the previously documented average capillary diameter in wild type placentae  <cit> .

deltel7/ic2ko placentae exhibit proper expression of imprinted genes
to determine whether deltel7/ic2ko placentae express the ic2-regulated genes from the paternal allele in a normal cell-type specific manner, we analyzed the expression of three key genes in the distal chr  <dig> region strongly associated with placentation: phlda <dig>  ascl <dig>  and cdkn1c . we chose to look at stages in which the expression level of each of the genes is high or at its highest according to our own observations as well as previously published work  <cit> . ihc for phlda <dig> on e <dig>  deltel7/ic2ko placentae revealed exclusive expression in trophoblast cells of the labyrinth, consistent with wild type litter mates. ish for ascl <dig> on deltel7/ic2ko placentae revealed exclusive expression in cells of the spongiotrophoblast layer with some expression in glycogen cells , consistent with wild type litter mates. ish for cdkn1c on deltel7/ic2ko placentae revealed high expression in gcs and low expression throughout other cell types in the labyrinth, as seen in wild type litter mates . the relative expression level of each of these genes was confirmed by quantitative rt-pcr . no statistically significant differences in expression levels between deltel7/ic2ko and wild type placentae were observed for phlda <dig>  ascl <dig> and cdkn1c at the stages analyzed . additionally, an examination of expression level of several of the other imprinted genes in the ic <dig> region  by qrt-pcr at e <dig>  revealed no significant differences between deltel7/ic2ko and wild type placentae .

discussion
placental abnormalities such as placentomegaly  <cit>  and placental mesenchymal dysplasia  <cit>  are commonly observed in mothers carrying bws fetuses. mouse models of the bws imprinted region such as the igf <dig> transgenic mouse model  <cit>  and cdkn1c null mouse models  <cit>  which accurately recapitulate several phenotypic characteristics of the human disorder, are also accompanied by severe placental abnormalities, highlighting the importance of determining whether any placental abnormalities exist in the deltel7/ic2ko mouse model. in these compound heterozygotes, ic2-regulated imprinted genes such as cdkn1c are deleted from the maternal allele and can only be expressed from the paternal chromosome because of the ic <dig> deletion. our studies have shown that rescuing the deleted ic <dig> imprinted domain results in appropriate placentation with respect to placental architecture, placental vasculature and imprinted gene expression. our findings lead us to propose that rescuing an imprinting defect can also rescue the associated placental phenotype, which may have implications for bws patients who have associated placental defects.

it has been postulated that mechanisms other than transcription and elongation of kcnq1ot <dig> may influence repression of the paternal distal chr  <dig> genes. for example, cdkn1c imprinting has previously been shown to be controlled by an element some distance away from the gene itself in a bacterial artificial chromosome  mouse model of cdkn1c, which failed to reproduce appropriate cdkn1c imprinting  <cit> . in another study, a yeast artifical chromosome  transgene containing the entire ic <dig> domain was shown to recapitulate faithful imprinting of most of the ic2-regulated genes , but loss of imprinting of ascl <dig> and tssc <dig> was observed when the yac was paternally inherited  <cit> . both of these genes lie centromeric to ic <dig> and suggests that perhaps these genes require additional control elements beyond kcnq1ot <dig> transcription on the paternal allele that are absent on the yac transgene. the results of our study differ from the above in that we have demonstrated that the absence of kcnq1ot <dig> transcription and/or deletion of other sequences in ic <dig> not only leads to full and normal expression of the paternal distal chr  <dig> genes but to a full rescue of our deltel <dig> placental phenotype, suggesting that this locus is the single most critical component in maintaining epigenetic silencing in this region. since both normal placental phenotype and placental expression of ic <dig> genes are observed in deltel7/ic2ko conceptuses, our results also suggest that the normally methylated maternal allele of ic <dig> and its potential association with methyl-cpg-binding factors is not necessary in regulating the expression of the genes analyzed.

the placentomegaly resulting from maternal inheritance of a phlda <dig> null allele has been shown to be almost completely rescued by paternal inheritance of the same ic2ko allele used in this study  <cit> , providing evidence of proper phlda <dig> expression levels from the paternal ic2ko allele. to the best of our knowledge, the deltel7/ic2ko model is the first example of rescue of a large disrupted imprinted region, not just a single gene. we demonstrate that restoration of gene expression for a large number of genes in trans is possible and our work demonstrates the potential ability to rectify placental abnormalities caused by imprinting defects. future studies include developing rnai to knock down kcnq1ot <dig> during preimplantation stages in deltel <dig> pregnant females to determine if this can rescue placental and embryonic phenotypes. such experiments would suggest that it may be possible to therapeutically target the ncrna as a step towards aiding bws patients with maternal defects at ic <dig> that result in maternal kcnq1ot <dig> reactivation.

CONCLUSIONS
the deltel <dig> deletion offers an opportunity to assess the phenotypic consequences of loss of function for a cluster of maternally expressed genes on distal chr <dig>  here we show that deletion of the kcnq1ot <dig> promoter and nearby sequences  on the paternal allele can fully rescue the placental phenotype associated with maternal inheritance of deltel <dig>  in the viable conceptuses, monoallelic expression of imprinted genes is reversed and is now provided by the non-silencing alleles on the paternal ic2ko chromosome. our results show that all the genes required for normal placentation, missing in the deltel <dig> allele are regulated by ic <dig> and the ncrna kcnq1ot <dig> on the paternal allele during normal development. the methylated maternal allele of ic <dig> is not implicated in the regulation of these genes. our work establishes the possibility of rescuing imprinted disorders such as bws in trans, by interfering with the expression or the long-range silencing function of the regulatory ncrna kcnq1ot <dig>
