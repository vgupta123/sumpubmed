BACKGROUND
anadromous fishes such as atlantic salmon  exhibit a life history strategy that includes an initial phase in fresh water  followed by migration to marine environments  <cit> . the transformation of stream-dwelling ‘parr’ to seawater  tolerant ‘smolts’ entails the orchestrated development of physiological, morphological and behavioral traits that support migration to, and subsequent survival in, pelagic marine environments. while dependent upon reaching a necessary size, the timing of this transformation in atlantic salmon is initiated by environmental cues such as photoperiod and temperature  <cit> . depending upon latitude, this transformation typically occurs at 1– <dig> years of age in wild atlantic salmon  <cit> . the months preceding migration are termed ‘smoltification’ and this stage remains incomplete prior to downstream migration; animals of this stage are termed ‘pre-smolts’. at the peak of smoltification, salmon smolts will move downstream into estuaries and then quickly enter marine environments. upon reaching sexual maturity in the ocean, adults use olfactory cues to return to their natal fw streams to spawn  <cit> . smolts that do not gain entry into marine environments will reverse some of the acquired phenotypes such as salinity tolerance, and revert to pre-smolt phenotypes that are better suited for fw environments.

in order to sustain hydromineral balance upon entry into marine environments the parr-smolt transformation is inextricably linked with the acquisition of sw tolerance. as is the paradigm for strictly marine teleosts, the ability of smolts to inhabit sw is sustained by an array of solute- and water-transporting activities in the gill, gut, kidney and urinary bladder  <cit> . inasmuch as the gill is the primary tissue for the active transport of monovalent ions, the recruitment of branchial ionocytes  that extrude na+ and cl− is essential for gaining sw tolerance. sw-type ionocytes employ ion pumps, cotransporters and channels such as na+/k+-atpase , na+/k+/2cl− cotransporter  <dig>  and cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator  <dig>   <cit> . accordingly, branchial nka activity peaks concomitantly with nkcc <dig> and cftr <dig> mrna levels when salmon achieve maximal sw tolerance . thus, the seasonal patterns of these three parameters reliably predict whether juvenile salmon will be able to sustain hydromineral balance upon exposure to sw  <cit> .

in atlantic salmon, several endocrine systems synchronize the ontogeny of osmoregulatory systems with downstream migration  <cit> . in particular, the growth hormone /insulin-like growth factor  axis exhibits enhanced activity at the peak of smoltification  <cit> . from the perspective of whole-organism performance, a connection between the somatotropic axis and salmonid osmoregulation is supported by numerous findings of improved salinity tolerance following exogenous gh and/or igf <dig> treatment . the hyposmoregulatory actions of gh are seemingly mediated by multiple molecular pathways, including: 1) branchial gh receptors , 2) the synthesis and secretion of igf <dig> from the liver, 3) the local production of igf <dig> in the gill, and/or 4) enhanced responsiveness to cortisol . irrespective of the route of action, gh and igf <dig> promote salinity tolerance by regulating branchial nka activity  <cit> , the gene and protein expression of ionoregulatory factors  <cit>  and ionocyte density  <cit> .

igfs interact with cognate binding proteins termed igf binding proteins . the coordinated production, both spatially and temporally, of igfbps permits modulation of igf bioavailability in both positive and negative fashions  <cit> . igfbps may also exert ligand-independent activities  <cit> . studies on teleost igfbps have primarily focused upon how they mediate growth responses to stressors such as food restriction, temperature, hypoxia, and handling  <cit> , while relatively few studies have investigated igfbp responses to ionoregulatory challenges . attributed to multiple whole-genome duplication events, atlantic salmon express an expansive set of  <dig> igfbp genes  <cit> . among these igfbps, igfbp <dig> −5a,−5b <dig> −5b <dig> −6b <dig> and−6b <dig> are highly expressed in the gill  <cit> . there is currently no understating of how branchial igfbp expression is modulated in preparation for ionoregulatory challenges faced by developing salmon.

given that parr-smolt transformation encompasses numerous physiological preparations underlying marine survival, and consequently recruitment, knowledge of its physiological control informs efforts aimed at restoring endangered populations  <cit> . thus, the physiology of atlantic salmon smoltification presents an important physiological context for how igfbps underlie gh/igf-mediated life-history transitions. in turn, our first objective was to assess whether igfbp mrna levels change during smoltification. we further investigated whether igfbps respond to abrupt transfer to sw, and whether such responses varied with the degree of sw tolerance. because the gill is a key tissue underlying the development of sw adaptability, we primarily focused on igfbp transcripts that exhibit significant branchial expression.

methods
animals
atlantic salmon  parr were obtained in october of  <dig> from the kensington national fish hatchery, kensington, ct, and held at the conte anadromous fish research center, turners falls, ma. individuals from this cohort were expected to smolt in the spring of  <dig> on the basis of their size  in early february  <cit> . fish were held in a  <dig>  m diameter fiberglass tank supplied with dechlorinated tap water under natural photoperiod. water temperature was maintained at 9 °c until late june; water was then maintained at  <dig>  °c until the conclusion of the experiment. fish were fed to satiation twice daily with commercial feed . all experiments were carried out in accordance with us geological survey institutional guidelines and an approved iacuc review .

experimental design
to sample juvenile atlantic salmon before, during, and after smolting, fish  of mixed sex were sacrificed on march  <dig>  april  <dig>  may  <dig> and july  <dig> at 09:00 h , with food withheld for 24 h prior to sampling. in addition, sw challenges were conducted on march  <dig> and may  <dig> at 09:00 h. sixteen smolts were transferred to a tank with recirculating sw  at 9 °c with particle and charcoal filtration and continuous aeration. food was withheld for the duration of the challenge. fish were sampled  at 09:00 h at  <dig> and 48 h after transfer to sw.

sampling
at the time of sampling, fish were netted and anesthetized in buffered ms- <dig> . blood was collected from the caudal vasculature by a needle and syringe treated with ammonium heparin. blood samples were collected within 5 min from the initial netting. blood was separated by centrifugation at 4 °c and plasma stored at−80 °c until analyses. body mass and fork length were measured for calculation of condition factor: / <dig> ×  <dig>  gill and liver tissues were collected and immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at−80 °c. four to six additional gill filaments were placed in ice-cold sei buffer  and stored at−80 °c.

RESULTS
developmental/seasonal patterns
we verified that parr-smolt transformation and subsequent loss of salinity tolerance occurred by profiling multiple morphological and ionoregulatory parameters. condition factor was significantly reduced on april  <dig>  may  <dig> and july  <dig> compared with march  <dig> . we observed progressive silvering of the body and darkening of the fin margins leading to the may  <dig> sampling . branchial nka activity was elevated in may compared with pre-smolts  and post-smolts  . branchial nkcc <dig> and cftr <dig> levels were elevated in may compared with all other sampled time points .

there was a significant effect of season on plasma gh , but no significant differences between sampling points were detected by post hoc analysis . plasma igf <dig> was elevated in july when compared with april levels .

parr-smolt transformation did not coincide with any differences in branchial ghr <dig> or igfr1a expression . both igf <dig> and− <dig> were elevated in post-smolts  compared with all preceding time points . branchial igfbp6b <dig> and−6b <dig>  were significantly elevated near the peak of smoltification  while there were no clear seasonal effects on igfbp <dig> −5a, 5b <dig> and−5b <dig> . in liver, ghr <dig> expression was elevated in april above all other time points, while igf <dig> expression was elevated above march  <dig> levels at all subsequent samplings. there were no clear seasonal effects on hepatic igf <dig>  hepatic igfbp1b <dig> and−1b <dig> were elevated in april above all other time points; igfbp2b <dig> was reduced from march  <dig> levels at all subsequent samplings .

seawater exposures in march and may
in both march and may, sw exposures elicited increases in plasma chloride at  <dig> and 48 h . the increase in plasma chloride after sw exposure was substantially greater in march than in may. there were no significant increases in branchial nka activity or nkcc <dig> after sw exposure in march or may . sw exposure induced branchial cftr <dig> expression in march, but not in may .

plasma gh levels were elevated by 48 h after sw exposure in march; gh levels did not respond to sw exposure in may . sw exposures did not elicit any changes in plasma igf <dig> . sw induced branchial ghr <dig> levels by  <dig> and 24 h in march and may, respectively . branchial igf <dig> was not responsive to sw in march or may  whereas sw induced igf <dig> in both march and may . in march, igfr1a showed modest increases in response to sw .

among the igfbps expressed in the gill, igfbp <dig> and−6b <dig> were induced by sw exposure in march , while igfbp5a,−5b <dig> −5b <dig> and−6b <dig> were diminished following sw exposure . as in march, igfbp6b <dig> was decreased following sw exposure in may . in liver, there were no clear effects of sw exposures on ghr <dig> and igf2; however, sw induced igf <dig> in may. igfbp1a <dig> and−1b <dig> were similarly induced by sw exposure in march .

discussion
the progressive increase in the salt secretory capacity of the gill during smoltification entails developmentally cued patterns of ionocyte differentiation and proliferation, in addition to altered gene transcription within these ionocytes  <cit> . knowing that the gh/igf axis directs the timing and nature of these cellular behaviors , we hypothesized that igfbps contribute to smoltification and therefore would exhibit seasonal and sw-responsive patterns of gene expression. we report for the first time that increases in igfbp6b <dig> and−6b <dig> expression coincided with parr-smolt transformation and multiple igfbp <dig> − <dig> and− <dig> isoforms were modulated following sw exposures at different stages of smolt development.

fish in this study underwent smoltification as indicated by multiple parameters. first, we observed the typical decrease in condition factor due to changes in body shape and the utilization of lipid and glycogen stores . in strong agreement with previous studies, branchial nka activity and nkcc <dig> and cftr <dig> expression concomitantly peaked in may, a hallmark of sw-type ionocyte recruitment  <cit> . the ability of juvenile salmon to maintain ionoregulatory balance upon direct transfer from fw to sw is readily employed as an operational definition of hyposmoregulatory capacity. in march  we observed relatively large increases in plasma chloride after sw exposure, whereas in may , we observed modest increases in plasma chloride after sw exposure. it is interesting that in march, when fish had not yet developed sw tolerance, only cftr <dig>  and not nkcc <dig>  was activated in parallel with chloride perturbations. the branchial epithelium of pre-smolts harbors a population of sw-type ionocytes that presumably employ cftr <dig> and nkcc <dig> in the apical and basolateral cell membrane, respectively  <cit> . within these cells, transcription of cftr <dig> may be rapidly activated by ionic/osmotic conditions , a pattern reminiscent of how chloride secretion is activated in opercular epithelia of fundulus heteroclitus  <cit> . in any event, the attendant changes in the gill with respect to ionocyte function are consistent with a developmental/seasonal increase in ion-secretion capacity.

photoperiod-induced increases in plasma gh levels coincide with atlantic salmon smoltification  <cit>  and we likewise observed a rise  in plasma gh levels in april. nilsen et al.  <cit>  observed increased plasma gh levels in sw-challenged smolts in may, whereas we observed a gh response in march. this gh response was paralleled by increased branchial ghr <dig> expression. kiilerich et al.  <cit>  similarly observed increased ghr <dig> with sw transfer, albeit in smolts transferred to sw in april. while not specifically shown in salmonids yet, gh release from the pituitary is induced by direct osmosensing in certain euryhaline species such as mozambique tilapia   <cit> . this mode of regulation is compatible with increased plasma gh levels when blood plasma conditions, such as plasma chloride and presumably osmolality, were perturbed following sw transfer. the osmoregulatory actions of gh are mediated by its capacity to increase circulating levels and local tissue production of igfs  <cit> . seasonal patterns of circulating igf <dig> in atlantic salmon smolts are variable. in some cases, increases  <cit> , decreases  <cit> , or no well-defined changes  <cit>  have been reported. while we did not observe increased plasma igf <dig> in smolts, we did observe increased hepatic igf <dig> expression, perhaps mediated by increased sensitivity to gh via upregulation of ghr <dig>  on the other hand, local igf <dig> and− <dig> expression in the gill was not elevated in may smolts, patterns important to consider in light of the igfbp responses we subsequently observed.

this is the first time branchial igfbps have been assessed in a salmonid preparing for seaward migration; we assayed igfbp <dig> − <dig> and− <dig> isoforms that exhibit robust branchial expression  <cit> . igfbp <dig> exhibited a steady rise in expression throughout spring and summer, with increased expression following sw exposure in march. the function of igfbp <dig>  at least in mammals, highly depends on the physiological context surrounding its production, and may operate as either a stimulator or inhibitor of igf1/ <dig> signaling  <cit> . the activities of a teleost igfbp <dig> were first assessed in fugu  where overexpression delayed embryonic development  <cit> . nonetheless, in atlantic salmon and sea bream , igfbp <dig> expression is implicated in mediating enhanced post-prandial/fasting muscle growth , thereby suggesting a stimulatory effect on igf activity. the concomitant increases of igfbp <dig> along with igf <dig> and igfr1a following sw exposure may reflect a transcriptional program underlying enhanced paracrine signaling in response to ionoregulatory demands.

in contrast with igfbp <dig>  igfbp5a,−5b <dig> and−5b <dig> were all reduced following sw exposure in march. similar to atlantic salmon igfbp5s, zebrafish  igfbp5a and−5b are expressed in the gill  <cit> . igfbp5a is expressed in a sub-population of zebrafish ionocytes termed “nar cells” specialized for ca2+ uptake via trpv5/ <dig> channels. igfbp5a plays an essential role in ca2+ homeostasis; igfbp5a expression is induced by low environmental  and igfbp5a knockdown inhibits compensatory increases in nar cell proliferation following reductions in   <cit> . while not yet established for atlantic salmon, ca2+ uptake across rainbow trout  gill epithelia similarly employs a trpv5/ <dig> channel expressed in ionocytes and pavement cells  <cit> . if igfbp5a is a conserved regulator of branchial ca2+ uptake, then the sw-induced reductions in igfbp5a we observed in this study may reflect the increased  of sw compared with fw, and subsequent down regulation of ca2+ uptake pathways. interestingly, dai et al.  <cit>  showed that among the zebrafish igfbp <dig> isoforms , only igfbp5b exhibits ligand-independent transactivational activity. thus, while igfbp5a,−5b <dig>  and−5b <dig> showed similar responses to sw in the current study, it is likely that they are functionally distinct from one another, but such distinctions are entirely unresolved to date.

wang et al.  <cit>  described two teleost co-orthologs of human igfbp <dig>  denoted igfbp6a and−6b. igfbp6a exhibits low expression in both zebrafish and atlantic salmon gill, with igfbp6b <dig> being highly expressed in salmon gill  <cit> . among the igfbps we assayed, igfbp6b <dig> and−6b <dig> showed seasonal increases in expression with maximum levels in may smolts. mammalian igfbp <dig> exhibits a higher binding affinity for igf <dig> versus igf <dig>  and inhibits igf actions  <cit> . similarly, zebrafish igfbp6a and−6b attenuate igf activities and embryonic growth and development  <cit> . there is currently no information on plasma igf <dig> dynamics during smoltification; however, locally produced igfbp6b <dig> and/or−6b <dig> may modulate igf <dig> activity in the gill. moreover, igfbp <dig> modulates cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis in mammalian systems  <cit> , and considering how cell turnover underlies branchial development during smoltification  <cit> , igfbp6s may similarly contribute to cell-cycle regulation in smolts. adding further complexity is the disparate regulation of the two igfbp <dig> isoforms following sw exposures. nonetheless, the seasonal patterns of both igfbp6s suggest future study of their role in the gill is warranted.

we also assayed hepatic igfbp <dig> and− <dig> isoforms because their translated products modulate endocrine igfs  <cit> . as in mammals, igfbp <dig> and− <dig> isoforms are highly expressed in teleost liver . igfbp <dig> inhibits somatic growth, development, and glucose metabolism by restricting igfs from binding igf receptors  <cit> . the only report to date of plasma igfbp dynamics in smolts  revealed an april peak in plasma igfbp <dig>  <cit> . this elevated igfbp <dig> coincided with a drop in condition factor. here, we observed  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold increases in igfbp1b <dig> and -1b <dig> expression, respectively, in april compared with march. recall that we also observed a decline in condition factor in early spring, a pattern that routinely occurs when atlantic salmon smolts, but not parr, are allowed to feed ad libitum  <cit> . reduced condition factor is due to both smoltification-related changes in body shape and the utilization of energy reserves such as lipid stores and liver glycogen  <cit> . previous work has established that gh is involved in the lipolysis that occurs during smolting, and likely interacts with cortisol to affect other catabolic changes  <cit> . when these patterns are further considered with the feeding ecology of migrating smolts  <cit> , smoltification emerges as inherently catabolic. thus, igfbp1b <dig> and−1b <dig> may be further modulating growth and metabolism as part of the metabolic demands of smolt development and in preparation for seaward migration. interestingly, we detected no seasonal changes in igfbp1a <dig>  an isoform that is sensitive to nutrient conditions  <cit> . hepatic igfbp1a <dig> was, however, induced by sw exposure, a response also seen with a 32-kd igfbp  in rainbow trout plasma  <cit> . collectively, these patterns suggest that duplicated igfbp1s allow for multifactorial control of igf signaling during development and in response to salinity change. future work should investigate whether divergent igfbp <dig> responses are aligned with contrasting sensitivities to hormones such as cortisol, thyroid hormones and insulin, which display seasonal changes and/or mediate stress responses .

with a subset of hepatic and branchial igfbps whose expression patterns parallel parr-smolt transformation now revealed, future study is warranted to resolve how these dynamics relate to changes in circulating levels of actual igfbp proteins. as the liver is regarded as a major source of circulating igfbp <dig>  <cit> , we hypothesize that plasma igfbp1b <dig> and−1b <dig> may be enhanced in early april provided that mrna levels are suggestive of protein production and secretion. moreover, with marked changes in branchial igfbp6b <dig> and−6b <dig> levels occurring in may, it should be resolved whether their translated products are retained  locally, or whether they enter circulation as endocrine factors. in any event, the development of isoform-specific detection of igfbps is the next step towards establishing how the complex expression patterns of atlantic salmon igfbps across varied tissues  <cit>  relate to local and endocrine protein levels.

CONCLUSIONS
salmonids express an especially wide array of igfbps, and our data suggest that multiple igfbps may contribute to the development of sw tolerance and associated metabolic changes that occur during the parr-smolt transformation. with igfbps such as igfbp6b <dig> and−6b <dig> showing increases coincident with smolt development, the challenge is to now identify the specific activities of these isoforms. by comparing the physiologies of anadromous and landlocked salmon populations, investigators have discerned how relaxed selection for sw adaptability affects both endocrine and ionoregulatory systems  <cit> . we propose that a similar approach, which compares igfbp expression patterns across atlantic salmon populations, will aid our understanding how igfbps operate within, and modulate, the hormonal mechanisms that drive smoltification.
