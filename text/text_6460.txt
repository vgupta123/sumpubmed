BACKGROUND
acinetobacter baumannii has been considered one of the major nosocomial pathogens worldwide, and it is included in the group of eskape bugs, in which some lineages effectively escape the action of antibacterial drugs
 <cit> . carbapenems remain the antibiotic of choice to treat a. baumannii and other gram-negative infections due to both a wider spectrum of antibacterial activity and less frequent side effects. however, their overuse and misuse have selected for nosocomial isolates presenting intrinsic and acquired multidrug resistance determinants
 <cit> . it has been considered that resistance against carbapenems is, in itself, sufficient to define an a. baumannii as highly resistant
 <cit> . the molecular basis of carbapenem resistance in this species has been ascribed to the recruitment and production of carbapenem-hydrolysing class d β-lactamases  and, to a lesser extent, of metallo-β-lactamases . in a. baumannii, the chdls can be intrinsic  or acquired 
 <cit> . although these enzymes weakly hydrolyze carbapenems, they can confer high resistance when blaoxa genes are overexpressed, as a result of their association with mobile elements, such as isaba <dig>  which carries a strong promoter
 <cit> . the blaoxa- <dig> gene, in association with isaba <dig>  is spread in a. baumannii worldwide, and it is the most prevalent oxa allele in isolates from brazil
 <cit> .

in addition to this enzymatic resistance, the loss of membrane permeability, due to alterations in specific porins, is an intrinsic carbapenem resistance mechanism in a. baumannii. the 25/ <dig> kda heat-modifiable carbapenem-associated outer membrane protein  is a porin with a β-barrel topology. this channel allows the selective uptake of amino acids and imipenem  due to its structural conformation and to the presence of an imipenem binding site
 <cit> . this site was not found in any other omp, and thus, caro protein is considered a preferred uptake channel for this antibiotic. based on variable domains of caro, this channel is classified in two groups, caroa and carob, with high affinity to imipenem. moreover, carob was showed to be twice more specific for imipenem than the caroa. in this way, caro gene alterations, as disruption by insertion sequences, changes in the primary structure - mainly in the imipenem binding site - or decreased expression, would have a dramatic impact on the entry of imipenem in the cell, thus contributing to resistance to this antibiotic
 <cit> . concerning the participation of caro porin in the resistance phenotype, few descriptive studies have only shown the presence/absence of the gene and protein, resulting in a lack of studies showing the association of the caro alleles and their expression with the resistance phenotype.

brazil is a continental country and, concerning resistance in a. baumannii, the studies have been concentrated in the southeast region
 <cit> , which could not be representative of the a. baumannii diversity as showed previously
 <cit> . therefore, the role of caroa and carob in the differential imipenem uptake, and the current diversity of caro alleles available in the genbank lead us to investigate these aspects in a set of carbapenem-resistant clinical a. baumannii strains from two brazilian states placed ~ <dig>  km apart and with distinct ecological and social contexts. moreover, the prevalence and participation of carbapenemases in this phenotype was also evaluated.

RESULTS
all the  <dig> strains were resistant to, at least, meropenem. most of the strains from both rio de janeiro and maranhão were resistant to ceftazidime, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim, amikacin and streptomycin . a considerable discrepancy was observed between strains from rio de janeiro and maranhão concerning the resistance to aztreonam, gentamicin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ertapenem, and imipenem . three/thirteen  strains from rio de janeiro were resistant to imipenem contrasting with 13/ <dig>  resistant strains from maranhão. all strains from this study were susceptible to tigecycline and colistin , and strains resistant to imipenem presented mics ≥  <dig> μg/ml.

all strains harboured the chromosomally-encoded blaoxa- <dig> gene, however, the isaba <dig> was not associated to this allele in any strain. in fact, the isaba1-blaoxa- <dig> combination is not frequent
 <cit> , although a previous study had found this association in the southern region of brazil
 <cit> . additionally to blaoxa- <dig>  13/ <dig>  strains from maranhão carried also the chdl blaoxa- <dig> gene, while only 2/ <dig>  strains from rio de janeiro  harboured this allele. spite the low prevalence of blaoxa- <dig> in ac-rj strains  and in são paulo
 <cit> , it is the most prevailing and disseminated allele in brazil. all blaoxa- <dig> from both maranhão and rio de janeiro were preceded by isaba <dig> as found in previous works from several brazilian states
 <cit> . therefore, the high imipenem resistance  presented in all strains harbouring blaoxa- <dig> can be due to its overexpression driven by the isaba <dig> promoter
 <cit> . all strains from rio de janeiro, except by ac2-rj and ac72-rj, carried blaoxa alleles of narrow resistance spectrum , none of them associated with isaba <dig>  spite its presence in ac-rj strains . the isolates were negative for mbl genes, blaoxa-58-like and blaoxa-24-like alleles. in summary, our results revealed that only oxa with carbapenemase activity  was associated with isaba <dig> in the strains analyzed here, and that all of them were resistant to carbapenems. these results are summarized in table 
 <dig> 

the hodge test was in agreement with the carbapenemase activity and the consequent carbapenem resistance, where positive results were obtained only for the strains carrying isaba1-blaoxa- <dig>  while negative results were observed for strains harbouring oxa alleles with no or a weak carbapenemase activity. thus, these results reflect the oxa- <dig> overexpression driven by the strong promoter
 <cit>  found in isaba <dig> .

a. baumannii has a clonal structure population
 <cit> , however, several unrelated carbapenem-resistant lineages have been reported in brazil
 <cit> . in the present work, macrorestriction analyses revealed eight genotypes in rio de janeiro  and six genotypes in maranhão , totalizing  <dig> clones, none of them related to the international clones. in maranhão, the majority of strains  belonged to genotype i, however in rio de janeiro there was no predominant genotype. in this study, the blaoxa- <dig> gene was distributed in several genotypes, while in são paulo this allele occurred in only one genotype
 <cit> . these findings show the diversity of clinical a. baumannii circulating in brazil. one strain of each genotype was selected as a representant to perform further analyses of caro transcription and gene sequencing .

considering caro, imipenem resistance can be influenced in three aspects: i) the occurrence of gene disruption resulting in the lack of porin formation in the outer membrane; ii) amino acid changes in both caroa and carob that could account for an altered porin with low or no affinity for the antibiotic and/or; iii) decrease expression of the caro gene that causes a low density of channels. therefore, to fully investigate these aspects, it is necessary to assess the caro nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences and its expression. however, there is a lack of this set of data when the role of caro in imipenem resistance is addressed.

here, in order to raise all these information concerning caro, we analyzed the expression of this gene by relative quantification, and the nucleotide/predicted amino acid sequences were determined to type the caro  and to evaluate gene disruption by is. the caro sequences from ac-rj and ac-ma presented substitutions without the presence of frameshifts and/or premature stop codons when compared to caro of a. baumannii atcc  <dig>  analyses of the caro promoter region showed that all strains harbour the canonical sequence as described previously
 <cit> .

the predicted amino acid sequence showed that caroa and carob were distributed among isolates from maranhão and rio de janeiro. moreover, blastx analyses revealed caro sequences with amino acid differences considering both caroa and carob, which was named here undefined caro . the undefined caro porins  presented one to five amino acid differences among each other, with 70% and 74% identity with caroa and carob, respectively. one of these, from ac6-rj, is identical to a caro previously identified in argentina 
 <cit> . ac67-ma and ac71-ma carried two new undefined caro with 98% and 99% amino acid identity, respectively, with caro sequences identified in strains from germany, united states, leban and china  . therefore, taking into account the observed caro diversity, and that the caro primary structure influence the imipenem affinity and, consequently the imipenem resistance, the impact of other isoforms on this phenotype has to be investigated.

considering the imipenem-susceptible strains, relative quantification assay revealed that ac1-rj , ac3-rj , ac10-rj , ac16-rj , and ac70-ma  had a basal transcription level of caro as atcc  <dig> . for this group of strains, the caro transcript amount and the type of caro were in agreement with the imipenem susceptibility phenotype . moreover, these strains did not produce carbapenemases. however, the caro expression did not correlate with this phenotype in the imipenem-susceptible ac60-ma and ac9-rj strains. in ac60-ma, which is highly susceptible to imipenem , the caro gene was disrupted by the isaba <dig> . therefore, the porin loss in this strain was not evoking resistance, indicating the participation of other mechanisms in the imipenem uptake. similarly, ac9-rj, susceptible to imipenem , presented a 10-fold decrease in caro expression. it can be suggested that, apparently, this 10-fold expression reduction was not enough to cause the total loss of porin formation. interestingly, ac9-rj has a porin from the carob group, which is more specific towards imipenem than caroa
 <cit> . thus, even in lower amounts of the porin, the imipenem uptake can be occurring due to caro structural conformation in this strain, explaining its susceptibility to imipenem.

considering the imipenem-resistant strains, ac2-rj , ac62-ma , ac65-ma , ac67-ma  and ac71-ma  had low caro transcript amounts . the exception was ac72-rj, which presented basal caro transcription. all of them produce the chdl oxa- <dig>  and therefore, it was not possible to establish the contribution of caro in this resistance phenotype . conversely, the imipenem-resistant ac6-rj strain , presented basal caro transcription level , and no carbapenemase production was detected . as showed above, the ac6-rj harbours an undefined caro type, presenting 70% and 74% amino acid identity with caroa and carob, respectively. therefore, these caro could have an altered imipinem binding site, influencing the antibiotic affinity, resulting in the observed resistance. in fact, this undefined caro from ac6-rj was identical to that from ab <dig> strain from argentina, which has been shown to play an essential role in the selective uptake of l-ornithine, but not of imipenem
 <cit> .

therefore, to correlate caro with imipenem resistance, not only the expression has to be considered, but also the caro primary sequence. the results obtained for ac6-rj and ac9-rj provide evidences of a possible correlation between caro isoforms and imipenem resistance/susceptibility phenotype . moreover, provean analyses revealed that the amino acid substitutions  found in the different undefined caro identified in this study had a neutral impact in protein function. these results indicate that even with this high proportion of substitutions they are not interfering with caro function and formation.

the particular role of some caro  in the imipenem affinity had been experimentally determined by catel-ferreira and colleagues
 <cit> . vashist et al.
 <cit>  indirectly showed a correlation between expression, the caro isoform and imipenem resistance based on proteomic approaches. here, we directly determined the caro isoforms by assessing the substitutions in the amino acid primary sequence and the transcription level of caro. also, vashist and colleagues showed that altered caro isoforms were upregulated while the native caro  were downregulated in carbapenem-resistant a. baumannii. these results obtained at the post-translational level contrast with ours since no correlation between the caro  and the transcription level  was observed in this study . this reflects that post-transcriptional events may be occurring during porin formation in the membrane, since in that work the authors analyzed the protein. therefore, our study is the first to infer the role of caro on imipenem resistance considering its expression and allelic diversity.

CONCLUSIONS
studies in distinct brazilian geographic regions have already shown the prevalence of oxa- <dig> among the several chdls in imipenem resistant a. baumannii strains
 <cit> . however, there is a lack of data concerning the influence of membrane permeability loss in this phenotype. we concluded that, spite of the carbapenemase production being the major carbapenem resistance mechanism in a. baumannii analyzed here, the amino acid composition of caro porins can affects more drastically the imipenem resistance than the transcription level itself. therefore, these findings highlight the possible role of caro isoforms in this phenotype.
