BACKGROUND
epstein-barr virus  is widely disseminated in the human population. upwards of 95% of the adult human population is infected with ebv  <cit> . ebv is implicated in a number of different cancers, including hodgkin’s disease  <cit> , nasopharyngeal carcinoma  <cit> , hepatocellular carcinomas  <cit> , lymphoepithelioma-like carcinomas  <cit> , some breast cancers  <cit> , and in autoimmune disorders such as sjögren’s syndrome  <cit> , dermatomyositis  <cit> , lupus  <cit> , rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> , and multiple sclerosis  <cit> . ebv was the first cancer-associated virus to be discovered when in  <dig>  <cit>  it was isolated from tumors occurring in african children . despite intense investigation for more than 50 years, the precise roles played by the virus in these diseases remains to be elucidated.

the ~170000 bp genome of ebv is a linear double-stranded dna that circularizes to form an episome in the host cell nucleus. infection occurs by entry of the ebv virion into human host epithelial cells and initially proceeds via an aggressive lytic phase. the virus migrates to b cells where it causes persistent lifelong infections marked by extended periods of latency with interspersed lytic reactivation  <cit> . ebv latency proceeds via three distinct programs, each expressing a different set of coding and non-coding viral gene products. viral latent gene products rewire b cells to evade the host immune system and propagate the virus  <cit> . in a manner not yet fully understood, this rewiring increases the tumorigenic potential of ebv-infected cells, including making infected cells resistant to apoptotic pathways that would otherwise kill cancerous cells  <cit> .

the ebv transcriptome is complex, consisting of multiple pre-mrna transcripts that undergo extensive alternative splicing events and can, at various states of infection, yield different sets of gene products  <cit> . two well-studied ebv-encoded ncrnas  are known to be expressed throughout infection  <cit> , as are subsets of as many as  <dig> different ebv-encoded micrornas   <cit> . although the precise functions of the ebers have remained obscure, they are the most highly expressed rnas in ebv-infected cells . roles in cancer have been proposed  <cit>  and the ebers are capable of inducing tumors in immune-suppressed mice  <cit> . both ebers form ribonucleoprotein complexes  <cit> , including host proteins, and adopt well-defined secondary structures  <cit> . except for the ebers, rna structure is a relatively understudied aspect of ebv virology; an analysis of rna secondary structure in ebv could enable significant advances in understanding this important human pathogen.

rna secondary structure plays important roles in many viruses, mediating functions as diverse as translation initiation  <cit> , catalysis  <cit> , viral genome packaging  <cit> , alternative splicing  <cit> , interactions with the host innate immune system  <cit> , rna lifetime/stability  <cit> , and regulation of gene expression  <cit> . the discovery of rna structure is an active area of research  <cit>  and is aided by the availability of sophisticated non-coding rna-discovery algorithms  <cit> . a successful strategy for discovering conserved rna structures is implemented in the program rnaz  <cit> . in this approach, homologous sequences are aligned and divided into fragments. for each fragment, calculated parameters that include measures of the thermodynamic stability  and conservation of secondary structure are used to make predictions based on a support vector machine  trained on known ncrnas, which generates a probability classifier  for the fragment containing conserved secondary structure. the rnaz approach has been used to discover rna secondary structures in a number of viruses  <cit> .

RESULTS
global findings
refseq genomes  from four ebv strains  and one from the closely-related  macacine herpesvirus  <dig>  were aligned using the mafft alignment program  <cit> . the average pairwise sequence identity  of the alignment is  <dig> %; the four ebv strains were close in sequence , while mhv <dig> had an apsi of  <dig> % versus ebv.

across the entire ebv genome the z-score average is - <dig>  and the average p-class is  <dig> . rnaz discovered  <dig> regions that map to known transcripts from the ebv genome  and have strong evidence of locally conserved and stable rna structure. these regions  are comprised of overlapping windows with high predicted probability of generating conserved rna structure. the average p-class for the set of predictions was  <dig>  with minimum and maximum values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . the thermodynamic z-score is an important component in determining the p-class. this parameter reflects the thermodynamic stability of the native sequence predicted structure versus that of random sequence  <cit>  . for predicted structured regions in ebv rna, the average z-score was - <dig>  with minimum and maximum values of - <dig>  and - <dig> , respectively. this analysis, however, does not account for long-range rna interactions that may occur outside the overlapped prediction windows.

identification of known ebv ncrnas
the genomic region specifying eber <dig> occurs within locus  <dig> . the structure model derived for eber <dig>  is almost identical to the model in the rfam database . a single base pair in the rfam model, between nt  <dig> and  <dig>  is shifted to form a pair between  <dig> and  <dig>  and the predicted closing au pair of this hairpin is open in the rfam model . additionally, c <dig> is in a bulge-loop in the rfam model, but the insertion of a g residue across from this nt allows a gc pair to form. eber <dig>  surprisingly, does not occur in an rnaz-predicted locus. the region containing eber <dig> was not calculated to have a favorable z-score; however, this is most likely due to the inability of the primary sequence alignment to capture the conservation of structure for this rna. eber <dig> is less conserved in sequence than eber <dig>  making primary sequence alignment difficult in this region. common helices in eber <dig> were not properly aligned, thus reducing the predicted free energy of the consensus structure, which resulted in an unfavorable z-score.

all but two of the ebv mirnas annotated in the mirbase database  <cit>  occur in rnaz-predicted structured regions. each of the mature mirna sequences, when mapped to predicted structure models, falls within a hairpin rna structure that resembles a canonical pre-mirna . for example, figure 2b shows three hairpins in locus  <dig>  which include the bart <dig>  bart <dig>  and bart <dig> mirnas. each of these hairpins places the 5p and 3p mature sequences in canonical structural contexts: the mature mirnas are offset and imperfectly base pair with each other. this is also true for the other  <dig> mature mirna sequences that fall within predicted structured regions .

finally, a reported ebv-encoded viral small nucleolar rna  also falls within an rnaz-predicted structured region . the v-snorna corresponds to nt  <dig> to  <dig>  and, in isolation, has a predicted folding free energy and z-score of - <dig>  kcal/mol and - <dig> , respectively .

in addition to the regions corresponding to eber <dig>  the v-snorna, and  <dig> loci specifying ebv pre-mirnas, there are  <dig> additional ebv regions with predicted conserved rna structure .

structure within introns
sixty predicted structured regions overlap introns. introns are a fertile source of structured ncrnas  <cit>  that play roles in a number of important biological processes: snornas  <cit> , mirnas  <cit> , and pirnas  <cit>  are expressed from introns. rna structure within introns can alter accessibility or distance between functional elements and thus regulate splicing  <cit> .

the most extensive regions of predicted structure in introns occur within a repetitive region of the ebv genome . the number of w repeats can vary, and the optimal number appears to be five to eight  <cit> . the w repeats are transcribed at the 5′ end of the long  primary transcript encoding the epstein-barr nuclear antigen  latent proteins . ebna transcripts are particularly interesting because they have high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic abundance, suggesting non-coding nuclear functions  <cit> .

six ebna proteins are expressed from mrnas produced by extensive alternative splicing. transcription of the ebna rna can occur from an upstream promoter, the c promoter , or a downstream w promoter   <cit> . early in latency iii wp is utilized, where splicing of w <dig> to w <dig> generates the start codon for ebna-lp production  <cit> ; later in latency iii there is a switch to cp where the non-coding c <dig> exon is joined to w <dig> to create the ebna-lp start codon . within the w repeats two short coding exons, w <dig> and w <dig>  which are  <dig> and  <dig> nt long, respectively, are joined to form the ebna-lp protein open reading frame  by removal of a long  and short  intron. rnaz predicts widespread conserved and stable rna structure covering 49% of the long w repeat intron. there are five predicted regions, which are identical in sequence in the w repeats : loci  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are identical; loci  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are identical; loci  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are identical; loci  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are identical; and finally, loci  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are identical. loci  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  although they are multiplied in the w repeats, are transcribed only when cp is used to initiate transcription . cp occurs just upstream of locus  <dig> and the c <dig> non-coding exon is within locus  <dig> .the first copy of wp overlaps locus  <dig>  which also contains w <dig> .

within loci  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> is a highly unusual modeled rna structure, a very long  tetraloop hairpin . the infernal package  <cit>  was used to search for additional homologous structures. three other lymphocryptovirus species , members of the herpesvirus taxonomical group to which ebv belongs , possess homologous structures. these discovered hairpins occur within the long introns of repeats homologous to the w repeats of ebv, appearing six times in mhv <dig>  and  <dig> times in cahv <dig> . three hairpin homologs are found within the partial sequence of cehv <dig> .

the apsi of these long hairpin sequences is  <dig> %, with the cahv <dig> sequence being most distant . the mhv <dig> and cehv <dig> hairpins are most similar to ebv in sequence  and structure . the ebv, mhv <dig>  and cehv <dig> hairpins are each capped with a tetraloop closed by a gc pair  and only the first nt in the loop varies . the more distant cahv <dig> hairpin, in contrast, is capped with a seven-nt loop . perhaps the identities of the capping nucleotides are of lesser importance to the function of this long hairpin than the overall conserved structure, which is marked by extensively base paired stem regions interspersed with internal  loops . internal loops may adopt interesting 2d and 3d structures; for example, the three-by-three internal loop that occurs 20 bps from the hairpin loop in ebv , may fold into a “ <dig> rrs” motif  <cit>  where the opposing internal loop nucleotides form consecutive sheared purine-purine pairs.

additionally, global thermodynamic z-scores were calculated for each hairpin : all four have very negative z-scores . thus, the structures generated by these sequences are more than six standard deviations more thermodynamically stable than random sequences with the same dinucleotide content. this indicates that evolution is acting to preserve base pairing within each sequence, as well as the striking structural homology between these viral hairpins.

very long rna hairpins that are structurally similar to the ebv w repeat hairpin have been described in humans  <cit>  and in caenorhabditis elegans <cit> . these structures are excellent substrates for adenosine deaminase acting on rna  editing enzymes, which convert adenosine to inosine . interestingly, a previous study of a-to-i editing in ebv  <cit>  found evidence for an editing site that maps to a region of the genome that we predict to be part of the long hairpin . adars act on structured rnas and have preferences for adenosines in particular sequence contexts  <cit> , allowing the prediction of potential a-to-i editing sites and of the extent of editing. the reported editing site is predicted to be moderately edited  and is modeled to be in a ca internal loop . there are additional sites predicted to be strongly edited in the ebv w repeat hairpin and in the homologous structures found in mhv <dig>  cehv <dig>  and cahv <dig> . few of these strongly predicted sites , however, have apparent conservation , which is unsurprising, as selection of adar sites may be partially stochastic  <cit> .

rna editing in introns, typically within alu inserts  <cit> , has been proposed to regulate rna splicing  <cit> . inosine can form wobble pairs with g and c residues and can contribute to rna-protein interactions: thus a-to-i editing can alter important rna-rna and rna-protein interactions  <cit> . editing can alter splicing regulatory elements or create/destroy splice sites  <cit> . perhaps editing of this long intronic hairpin also plays a role in splicing or in other functions post-splicing.

discovery of an ebv-encoded sisrna
a small rna library  was constructed using nuclear rna isolated from cultured human b lymphocytes stably infected with ebv . these cells exhibit a latency iii program of gene expression, the most transcriptionally active program, which also produces latency i and ii transcripts. nuclear rnas include not only eber <dig> and eber <dig>  <cit>  but also intronic sequences that are excised during the splicing process. unsurprisingly, the abundant eber <dig> and eber <dig> are present in the library and had the highest number of aligned rna-seq reads . a significant peak  corresponding to the v-snorna  was also observed. there was a surprisingly large peak originating from the w repeat region . this peak corresponds to reads that cover the entirety of the small intron  that separates the w <dig> and w <dig> orfs . next to the ebers, this was the largest peak observed. comparing length-normalized reads between the intron and eber <dig>  the intron is estimated to be present at 21% the level of eber <dig> or roughly on a par with eber <dig>  which is estimated to be 25% as abundant as eber <dig> . the presence of the intron in total nuclear rna samples was confirmed by northern blot  and rt-pcr . rt-qpcr then revealed that the intron is ~9-fold enriched in nuclear versus cytoplasmic rna .

*percent abundance vs. eber <dig> 

stable intronic sequence rnas have been described in xenopus oocytes  <cit>  and, interestingly, in herpes simplex virus- <dig>   <cit>  and in cytomegalovirus   <cit> . in these other herpesviruses a stable intron, known as the latency-associated transcript  in hsv- <dig>  is implicated in maintenance of latency  <cit> . the ebv sisrna  is the first of this class of ncrnas to be described in ebv. the ebv-sisrna- <dig> differs from the lat in two major respects: the lat is much larger , and the functional form of the lat is believed to be the lariat-intron splicing intermediate, whereas the ebv-sisrna- <dig> is likely to be a linear molecule. for both ends of ebv-sisrna- <dig> to have been free for ligation in the small rna library construction step, the 5′ end of the released intron could not have been sequestered in a lariat structure. this suggests that ebv-sisrna- <dig> has been acted upon by the debranching enzyme, which also linearizes intron-derived snornas during the maturation of this important class of ncrnas  <cit> .

introns homologous to ebv-sisrna- <dig> were found in other lymphocryptoviruses . the ebv-sisrna- <dig> sequence and these rnas have an apsi of  <dig> %, with the cahv <dig> sequence being most distant . in all analyzed ebv strains , the 81-nt ebv-sisrna- <dig> sequence is 100% conserved, whereas the apsi of the genome sequences of these strains is  <dig> %. within the ca-rich region an 11-nt sequence, from positions  <dig> to  <dig>  is 100% conserved in the analyzed lymphocryptoviruses . the distribution of dinucleotide frequencies in the ebv-sisrna- <dig> sequence is skewed, with ca being the most frequent, followed by ac and cc. the presence of ca-rich regions in the sisrna is interesting as such sequences are able to bind hnrnp l protein and modulate splicing  <cit> .

although ebv-sisrna- <dig> did not overlap an rnaz-predicted region, the secondary structure for this rna was modeled on the basis of the eight sequences shown in figure 6e. two small hairpins are predicted : an upstream hairpin that places the u-rich motif in a loop and a weak  hairpin in the ca-rich region. a compensatory mutation  is observed in the more stable upstream hairpin , which suggests that evolution is acting to preserve this structure. it is interesting to find evidence of a conserved hairpin that places the u-rich motif in a loop, as u-rich sequences often bind proteins  <cit>  and hairpins can pre-organize rna sequence motifs for rna-protein interactions  <cit> . the ca-rich region is likely unstructured and free to associate with other interactors.

additional putative sisrnas in ebv
other than the w repeat sisrnas, ebv possesses  <dig> additional short introns  interspersed throughout its genome. these short introns range in conservation from  <dig> % to  <dig> % apsi  and are predicted to fold into structures with a range of thermodynamic stabilities . four sequences have significantly negative z-scores  and one intron has a moderately favorable z-score  from nt  <dig> to  <dig>  these short introns also overlap with rnaz-predicted structured regions .

bnucleotide numbers for first instance of ebv-sisrna- <dig> 

particularly interesting is the sequence from nt  <dig> to  <dig>  which has the most favorable predicted folding free energy and z-score of any ebv intron . this intron occurs within the lytically-expressed bblf2/ <dig> gene, which generates part of a helix-primase complex essential for replication of the ebv genome  <cit> . the modeled secondary structure of the intron is shown in figure 7a; it forms a tetraloop hairpin that includes all of the intron sequence. this intron structure is contained within rnaz-predicted locus  <dig>  where the basal stem of the hairpin extends into coding regions by  <dig> nt  and the splice donor and acceptor are base paired within helices. a similar hairpin structure, identified by infernal, occurs in the mhv <dig> genome . rather than being joined together via splicing, mhv <dig> bblf2/ <dig> is translated from two orfs that produce bblf <dig> and bblf <dig> as separate proteins. this same intronic region in ebv partially codes for bblf <dig> in mhv <dig>  and is also present in the 5′ utr of bblf <dig> . it is remarkable that the hairpin structure has been maintained evolutionarily between ebv and mhv <dig> despite different apparent roles in protein expression: in ebv it brings splice sites closer together in space and may be processed out to form an independent structured rna, whereas in mhv <dig> it presents a stop codon in a loop and is not processed out of the mrna.

four ebv short introns have significant numbers of mapped reads in the small rna library ; however, they are lower in abundance than ebv-sisrna- <dig>  in the ebv latent membrane protein  gene, for example, there are three short introns with significant numbers of aligned read peaks . indeed, the intron encompassing nt  <dig> to  <dig> has an abundance of ~ <dig> % relative to eber <dig>  which is similar to the value observed for the v-snorna . the short introns in ebv, including those that are expressed during latency iii and those with few or no mapped reads, may represent a family of sisrnas. it will be interesting to learn if they are differentially expressed in other viral latency programs or during the lytic phase. short introns are an attractive source of small ncrnas, as they are released as by-products of pre-mrna splicing.

structure overlapping splice sites
the importance of rna structure in the regulation of splicing has been highlighted in two excellent reviews  <cit> . structure can be inhibitory, by sequestering splice sites  <cit>  or regulatory elements  <cit> , or it can enhance splicing by presenting sites in an accessible conformation  <cit>  or by bringing splice sites into closer proximity with each other  <cit> . conformational switching between accessible and inaccessible structures may also regulate splicing  <cit> .

in ebv, there are seven predicted structured regions that include splice sites . of these, three include a splice donor or acceptor, while the remaining regions include both sites. for example, in the lmp-2b gene, locus  <dig> overlaps a splice donor site , which is buried within the stem of a tetraloop hairpin; towards the 3′ end of this structure  is a putative intronic splicing enhancer . locus  <dig> spans an entire intron and includes both the donor and acceptor sites . additionally, there is a putative exonic splicing enhancer at the beginning of locus  <dig> . the modeled structure for locus  <dig>  organizes this region into a complex multibranched structure where the splice donor and acceptor sites are each in helices: the donor at the end of the basal stem and the acceptor within a hairpin loop. interestingly, each splice site occurs directly after or near a predicted uu/uu two-by-two internal loop motif, in which uu mismatches maintain stable  <cit>  helical 3d conformations  <cit> . internal loops and non-canonical pairs can present complex patterns of chemical functional groups in protein-accessible regions of a folded rna  <cit> , which may influence the binding of splicing factors. additionally, the 3d folding of this structure may bring splice sites close together .

structure overlapping coding regions
many  predictions overlap ebv coding regions, in some cases including a significant portion of an orf. in the lytically-expressed ebv fgam-synthase gene, for example, predictions cover 40% the coding nt . more dramatically, the bglf <dig> gene overlaps four predicted structured regions , which span 84% of the coding region including part of the start codon. interestingly, many viral genomes appear to be enriched for rna secondary structure  <cit> , including within coding regions  <cit> . rna structure in coding regions can have a variety of functions  <cit> , such as altering reading frames via frame-shifting pseudoknots  <cit>  or by inducing ribosomal pausing  <cit> , which can impact numerous co-translational processes  <cit> . the identification of conserved and stable rna secondary structures within ebv coding regions suggests that they may play important roles in this virus.

twenty-one predicted structured regions include translation start or stop codons. locus  <dig>  for example, includes the start codon for the latent membrane protein 2a , which is involved in the regulation of host b-cell signaling and is implicated in ebv-associated tumorigenesis  <cit> . the first  <dig> nt of locus  <dig> fall within the 5′ utr of the lmp-2a mrna . the start codon is predicted to occur within the stem helix of a multibranch loop. rna structure can play a role in regulating translation through modulating the accessibility of codons. strong rna structure at stop codons, for example, can stimulate stop codon read-through  <cit> , whereas modulation of start codon accessibility can affect translational efficiency  <cit> . perhaps the stable structure  that encompasses the lmp-2a start codon modulates the expression of this important gene.

CONCLUSIONS
bioinformatics analyses of the ebv genome revealed  <dig> regions with putative conserved rna structure. the computational screen successfully identified most of the known ebv ncrnas: eber <dig>  a virally-encoded snorna, and  <dig> mirnas. other predicted structured regions of the ebv genome occur at or near sites that suggest potential functions for rna structures. a very long hairpin structure in the w repeat region that is conserved in lymphocryptoviruses contains at least one a-to-i editing site, with possible implications for splicing. additional regions span splice sites or start and stop codons. these structure predictions may prove useful since rna and rna structures are attractive targets for chemotherapy  <cit> . the modeled rna structures are rich in internal loops, e.g. the uu/uu internal loops near two splice sites in lmp-2b, which are potentially drugable structural motifs  <cit> . rna splicing, in particular, is an attractive target for rna therapeutics  <cit> .

rna-seq data identified several putative sisrnas, including one in the w repeat region  that is abundant and localizes in the nucleus. these results lay the groundwork for future experiments to further characterize the proposed structures and to understand the functional significance of the discovered rnas and rna structures in ebv. all structural data are available in the additional files. in addition, data for the w repeat long hairpin and ebv-sisrna- <dig> will be deposited in the rfam database.
