BACKGROUND
group a streptococcus  is a human-specific pathogen producing diseases ranging from pharyngitis and impetigo to severe, invasive conditions such as necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome  <cit> . causing an estimated  <dig>  deaths annually  <cit> , gas is one of the world's most important pathogens, reflecting its wide repertoire of virulence factors that interfere with host immune clearance mechanisms  <cit> . a hypothesized gas immune evasion factor is the secreted enzyme endos, an endoglycosidase possessing a highly specific hydrolyzing activity toward the n-linked glycan of immunoglobulin g   <cit> . the igg heavy chain is n-glycosylated at asparagine  <dig> with a complex biantennary oligosaccharide that is crucial for the interaction with fc gamma receptors  on phagocytic cells  <cit> . experimentally, enzymatic deglycosylation of murine igg can decrease complement activation, binding of igg to fcγrs on macrophages, and antibody-mediated cytotoxicity  <cit> .

endos is specific to native igg, which is in contrast to many related endoglycosidases that requires denaturation of their glycoprotein substrates  <cit> . furthermore, pretreatment of igg with recombinant endos diminishes its ability to opsonize bacteria and interact with fcγrs on leukocytes  <cit> . the activity of endos on igg heavy chain glycans is well characterized and conserved among gas serotypes  <cit> . however, a potential role of endogenous endos expression by the gas bacterium in phagocyte resistance and virulence has not been elucidated. we hypothesize that endos contributes to gas virulence by hydrolyzing the n-linked glycan on igg and thereby impairing antibody mediated functions in the immune system. here we couple targeted allelic replacement mutagenesis and heterologous gene expression to study endos activity during bacterial-host cell interaction in vitro and in vivo.

RESULTS
generation of endos mutants and heterologous expression
to investigate the contribution of endos to gas and host-cell interactions an allelic replacement knockout in the m1t <dig> background was constructed and denoted  <dig> Δndos. heterologous expression of endos in a non-native endos producing gas strain, nz <dig> , was established by transformation of the endos expressing plasmid pndos. loss- and gain-of-function was confirmed by western immunoblot  and igg glycan hydrolysis assays   <cit> . as suspected no detectable endos was identified in the supernatants of the 5448Δndos strain, and heterologous expression of endos in nz <dig> was successful. in addition, higher levels of endos were observed in the overexpressing strain nz <dig>  compared to the wild-type m <dig> strain  <dig> 

neutrophil killing assay
the phagocytic resistance of gas with and without endos contribution was investigated in a human neutrophil killing assay with gas strains 5448Δndos and wild-type  <dig>  loss-of-function did not reveal significant difference in gas resistance to phagocyte killing in the m1t <dig> background . in the same m1t <dig> background, exogenous recombinant endos, rendos, or pbs was used to pretreat plasma to investigate phagocytic resistance contribution of the enzyme itself. it was found that rendos increases gas survival in the presence of neutrophils and plasma containing gas antibodies . the contribution of endos to gas virulence was also studied in the less virulent strain nz <dig>  in gain-of-function analysis. the results reveal that heterologous overexpression of endos in m <dig>  nz <dig> increased gas resistance to killing by human neutrophils .

monocyte killing assay
as with neutrophil killing assays, no significant difference in bacterial survival was detected in the monocytic killing assays when comparing m1t <dig> gas strain  <dig> to the isogenic ndos knockout strain . pretreatment of plasma with exogenous rendos resulted in a significant increase in gas resistance to killing by monocytes , as did heterologous expression of endos in the less virulent strain nz <dig> .

in vivo mouse model
many major gas virulence factors have been shown to decrease overall virulence when knocked out and studied in murine infection models  <cit> . it has also been shown that endos has activity on all subclasses of murine igg  <cit> . taken together, this led us to believe that the contribution of endos to gas virulence could be studied in vivo. however, in this murine model of infection gas strain 5448Δndos showed no significant difference in virulence compared to wild-type  <dig> .

however, when we studied the less virulent gas strain nz <dig>  overexpressing endos, it was found that strain nz <dig> showed increased virulence in vivo  compared to wild-type nz <dig>  this may be a function of the relatively high level of expression of endos in nz <dig> compared to  <dig> .

discussion
a single clone of the m1t <dig> serotype has disseminated globally during the last few decades to represent the leading cause of severe, invasive gas infections  <cit> . the unique virulence of the m1t <dig> clone has been associated with many factors including the phage-encoded dnase sda <dig>  allowing escape from neutrophil extracellular traps  <cit> , the streptococcal inhibitor of complement  protein, promoting serum and antimicrobial peptide resistance  <cit> , pro-inflammatory and phagocyte resistance properties of the m1t <dig> protein  <cit> , high level expression of the pore-forming cytotoxin streptolysin o   <cit> , and a propensity for genetic mutations in the covr/s regulatory locus promoting hypervirulence  <cit> . there exist many inherent limitations of modeling a secreted bacterial virulence factor in vitro and of the mouse as a surrogate host for gas infection studies. however, our studies do strongly suggest that the endogenous expression of endos may be redundant or dispensable for m1t <dig> gas phagocyte resistance and pathogenicity, since targeted mutation of the other factors described above do yield clear attenuation of virulence phenotypes in similar in vitro and in vivo assay systems.

conversely, pretreatment of plasma containing antibodies against gas with recombinant endos reduced opsonphagocytic killing of gas, and heterologous overexpression of endos in a less virulent m <dig> gas strain conferred increased phagocyte resistance and increased lethality in the mouse infection model. these results suggest that high level expression or local accumulation of endos in tissues could contribute to virulence in certain gas strain backgrounds or infection scenarios, a subject that could merit future analysis in larger clinical or molecular epidemiologic surveys.

endos is highly conserved among gas serotypes and can also be found in streptococcus equi and zooepidemicus  <cit> . therefore, it was somewhat surprising that we could not detect a significant contribution to gas virulence in vivo. this may be due to the limitations of the mouse model used, and the expression levels of endos during the murine infection. the expression level of this enzyme during a human infection could have an impact on gas immune cell killing resistance but this remains to be investigated. the specificity of endos activity towards igg suggests that the enzyme may have an important role in the pathogenesis of gas, yet to be discovered.

finally, whether or not gas can effectively deploy this unique enzymatic activity targeted igg n-glycosylation to promote its own survival in the host , the enzyme itself has already proven a promising lead biotherapeutic for treatment of antibody-mediated inflammatory pathologies  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that in a highly virulent m1t <dig> background, endos has no significant impact on gas phagocyte resistance and pathogenicity. however, our overexpression experiments could indicate that local accumulation or high levels of expression of endos can contribute to virulence in certain gas strains, or in other infection scenarios than the systemic infection model used in this study.
