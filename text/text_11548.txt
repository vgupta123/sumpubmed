BACKGROUND
the process by which axons cross the midline during development of the central nervous system  in drosophila is of great interest and has been the focus of much scientific research  <cit> . after neuroblast delamination and cell fate decisions, axons undergo a journey that will eventually wire them to the appropriate targets. this journey includes a series of steps, one of which is the decision to cross  the midline. four key regulators of midline crossing are known: slit, robo, robo <dig> and comm. growth cones in which the robo and robo <dig> receptors are present at the membrane sense the presence of the slit ligand and do not cross the midline  <cit> . conversely, growth cones without robo and robo <dig> at the membrane are not able to respond to the repulsive cue of slit and do cross the midline. robo levels at the growth cone membrane are regulated by comm.

a major question in midline crossing is how regulation occurs through gene expression, i.e., to what extent is transcription relevant in the control of growth cone pathways. it is well established that rapid local translation does occur  <cit> . some literature also indicates that transcription is relevant  <cit> . we designed this study of transcription during cns development to i) find relevant genes in the axon guidance process, ii) elucidate the role of transcription regulation during midline crossing in drosophila, and iii) determine whether any upstream changes are visible in axon guidance mutants. our analysis uses two whole-genome microarray data sets:  axon guidance – drosophila embryos, stage  <dig>  of axon guidance gain of function  and loss of function  mutants, and  time course – a developmental wild type time course, consisting of  <dig> non-overlapping  <dig> hour collection points . the axon guidance  data was collected as part of this study and is published here for the first time. we have thoroughly reanalyzed the previously published time course  data.

to identify clusters of co-expressed genes in each data set, we employ the hopach clustering methodology  <cit> . clustering algorithms have been successfully applied to microarray studies, but the systematic analysis of clustering output remains a major challenge. a significant obstacle is the lack of reproducibility, or even assessment of variability, of clustering results. clustering output can vary dramatically from one repetition of an experiment to another, particularly with the small sample sizes typical in microarray experiments. the r statistical package hopach  <cit>  uses a bootstrap resampling method to assess cluster variability, producing a measure of membership of each gene in every cluster. for this study, we adapted hopach to use these cluster membership values to assign genes to clusters, while allowing genes to belong to more than one cluster – a type of fuzzy clustering. this modification improves reproducibility and results in cluster output that is suitable for functional characterization. hopach is freely available and is easily used by biologists, providing a statistically sound framework for analysis of microarray data.

we characterize gene clusters with two complementary sources of annotation, the gene ontology   <cit> , and the atlas of pattern of gene expression , a component of the berkeley drosophila genome project  <cit> . apoge provides pictures of the expression pattern of each gene in the drosophila embryo and a description of the anatomical structures in which the gene is expressed. a controlled vocabulary is used by individual curators , experts who assure consistency in each call. the goals and scope of apoge are described in  <cit> . its use for characterization of microarray data has never been explored. together, go and apoge provide a rich, multi-dimensional vocabulary for annotating hopach clusters. in this study, we analyze clusters in which genes with terms related to axon guidance are significantly over represented. querying the apoge in situ database for genes expressed with specific spatial and temporal patterns provides a means to further explore the axon guidance clusters.

applying this approach, we identify striking changes in gene expression across gof/lof, as well as groups of axon guidance genes co-expressed during wild type development. these findings suggest that regulation of gene expression does in fact play a role in midline crossing. in addition, our analysis indicates that axon guidance genes may be involved in the process of hemocyte migration, and that cell cyclins are active during midline crossing. these observations are confirmed through independent rna and protein expression studies.

RESULTS
transcriptional control in axon guidance mutants
our hopach analysis of gene expression profiles from  <dig> drosophila axon guidance mutants identified  <dig> clusters of median size  <dig> . figure  <dig> shows the profiles of these clusters ordered by the hopach algorithm so that clusters close to each other contain genes with similar expression profiles. if regulation during the course of axon guidance occurs mainly through protein translation, the changes observed in a microarray study will not yield coherent groups of genes with known function in axon guidance. yet, we found several clusters significantly enriched for axon guidance genes.

we ranked clusters based on their association with relevant terms from go  and apoge  as described in the methods. the top four clusters for each term are shown in table  <dig>  cluster ag <dig> ranks first for "axon guidance", "embryonic brain" and "ventral midline". it is the cluster with the highest ranks in both the go and the apoge vocabularies. this cluster contains a number of genes well known from the axon guidance literature, such as dock, plexb, cam, cadn, caps, spen, fsket, con, rhogap19d, rac <dig>  and shot. ag <dig> is another cluster that also contains relevant genes in axon guidance mechanisms, such as trio, wasp, nedd <dig>  robo <dig>  mical, rhogapp <dig>  rhogap88c, rhogap18b, lola, side, and fmr <dig>  <cit> . a full list of genes in all of the top ranking clusters and a more detailed exploration of each cluster are available in the supplementary materials.

querying apoge, we identified a large subset of genes in cluster ag <dig> which are expressed in the commissures and midline . several genes of unknown function  share this distinctive pattern of expression with the known genes dock, gbeta, brat and cam. this similarity provides some insight into the functions of the less well characterized genes and suggests their involvement in axon guidance.

hemocyte migration
querying apoge for cluster ag <dig> reveals genes with hemocyte expression, including dgk, pyd, 103e <dig>  cg <dig>  cg <dig>  cg <dig> and cg <dig>  hemocytes are drosophila blood cells, which migrate during embryonic development  <cit> , with the direct involvement of the vascular endothelial growth factor  pathway  <cit> . hemocytes are relevant in cns development  <cit> , and it is known that mutants for pvr, a key molecule in the vegf pathway, show a longitudinal phenotype and cns condensation defects  <cit> .

the microarray data indicates that genes expressed in hemocytes are significantly upregulated in slit and robo <dig>  but not in slit.robo. this pattern is intriguing, because the axon guidance phenotype  is similar in the three mutants. motivated by this observation, we investigated whether hemocytes show any spatial defects in mutants for the slit ligand , the double mutant for slit's receptors robo <dig> and robo <dig> , and the double mutant for slit and robo . figure  <dig> is representative of the data we observe using two diffent probes ; the cns scaffold is visible by staining with the antibody bp <dig>  the robo <dig>  slit and slit.robo embryos have the same midline cns phenotype, with all axons collapsed at the midline . hemocyte expression, however, differs between the mutants. the hemocytes are absent from the middle segments in slit and slit.robo embryos , whereas the defect is not observed in the robo <dig> embryos . this raises the speculation that slit might be part of some repellent mechanism for hemocytes, with robo assuming a different role than in axon guidance. from the in situ hybridization data it is not possible to determine whether genes expressed in hemocytes are up regulated in slit and slit.robo mutants. the hemocytes are absent in the middle segments, but expression in hemocytes in other segments could be higher, leading to a higher overall expression in whole embryos. nevertheless, we can conclude that the slit and slit.robo have the same pattern, different from robo <dig>  as the microarray data suggested.

transcriptional control in time course
applying hopach to the developmental data set first published in  <cit>  results in  <dig> clusters. one of these  contains  <dig> non-differentially expressed genes . this result illustrates the ability of the hopach algorithm to place low-variability genes in a single large cluster, while forming distinct  clusters for other patterns.

the key axon guidance genes slit, comm, comm <dig> and robo <dig> belong to clusters significantly enriched for the go term "axon guidance" . the genes comm, comm <dig> and robo <dig> are all present in cluster tc <dig>  which is a small cluster  with a pattern of expression characterized by a peak around stages  <dig> to  <dig>  comm is known to be transiently expressed in the commissural axons and midline glia, simultaneously with robo  <cit> . however, the similarity in expression for comm, comm <dig>  and robo <dig> throughout the whole  <dig> hours of development has never been reported. given the exceptional similarity between the expression of these three genes it would be interesting to explore if they are controlled by the same upstream mechanism, or whether they control a common downstream mechanism. included in the adjacent clusters , hence with a very similar pattern of expression, there are other important axon guidance genes  and many genes involved in notch signaling , neur, brd, m <dig>  hlhm <dig>  hlhmgamma, dl, bib and malpha). notch involvement in axon guidance has been previously reported  <cit> . the genes spi, hh, argos, gsb, dl, slp <dig>  siz, and ems are also in these clusters and have documented phenotypes in axon guidance or the cns scaffold.

a query of apoge for genes in clusters tc <dig> to tc <dig> with midline expression similar to comm, comm <dig> and robo <dig>  yielded argos. the gene argos has been shown to be relevant in axon guidance in the visual system  <cit> , which further strengthens the possibility of a role for argos in midline axon guidance. sulfated  is expressed in cells that appear to be adjacent to comm <dig> and robo <dig> expressing cells. sulf <dig> has not been previously implicated in axon guidance. it is our future project to investigate whether either argos or sulf <dig> has a genetic interaction with comm, comm <dig> and robo <dig> 

cell cyclins
time course clusters tc <dig>  tc <dig> and tc <dig> are the most relevant clusters for the apoge terms . they do not contain axon guidance genes, but they have many cyclins, including cyca, polo, cdc <dig>  cycb <dig> cyce and ago. cell cyclins are involved in cell division and in cns development, playing an important role in neuroblast division. however, a role for cyclins has not been reported in post-mitotic neurons, the type of neurons involved in axon guidance. it is known that cyca and cyce mutants have severe defects in the commissures and longitudinal axon tracts of the cns  <cit> , and cdk <dig> controls some aspects of axon patterning in vivo  <cit> . the cyclins cyca, cdc <dig> and cycb <dig> genetically interact with each other  <cit>  and are important in the earlier stages of intense cell division  <cit> . agreeing with this role, the tc data shows high expression early in development, but suggests other functions at later stages because i) there is sustained expression well past the intense initial cell divisions, and ii) the apoge images show a similar pattern of expression for all cyclins for later stages.

co-expression of cell cyclins in axon guidance and time course data
interestingly, we also identify expression changes in cyclins in the ag data set. clusters ag <dig> to ag <dig> are a group of cell cyclin rich clusters that contain the cyclins smg, polo, cycb <dig>  swa, pim, cdc <dig>  twe, cycb, and fzy. table  <dig> shows the percentage of genes present in apoge with cell cyclin-like expression in each data set separately and simultaneously in both of them. we reason that genes belonging simultaneously to the two independent data sets' cell cyclin rich cluster space have a higher probability of being a cell cyclin or cell cyclin related gene. figure  <dig> depicts the genes from this common cluster space with cyclin-like expression. there are three types of genes in this set: i) genes with a role as cyclins , ii) genes with no known role as cyclins 2– <dig>  and uch-l3), and iii) genes with little known information . we plan to research the proposed role of the latter two groups of genes in the context of axon guidance.

cell cyclin protein and rna expression in axon guidance mutants and transgenics
the cell cyclin clusters show changes in transcript levels of several cyclins  in both mutant and transgenic embryos. most notably, the microarray data indicates that for all the robo gof, robo overexpression is always accompanied by an increase in the transcription of cyclins. hence we decided to verify if indeed cyclin rna and protein are increased in robo gof embryos. we assessed the precise location of these expression changes through in situ hybridization. to verify that changes in cyclin transcript levels correlate with changes in protein levels, we employed immunocytochemistry with various antibodies against cell cyclins. we analyzed the rna and protein patterns for cyclins  in three robo gof:  ur.mef – robo gof is overexpressed in all muscles ,  ur.yf – a stronger robo than wild-type  is overexpressed in the cns , and  frm – the cytoplasmic domain of robo is overexpressed in the cns . in agreement with the microarray data, robo overexpression in post-mitotic neurons  is accompanied with a large increase in cyclin expression both at the level of rna and protein . the increase in cyclin expression is especially clear when overexpressing robo in the muscles , making it visible in the pleural external oblique muscles  and the dorsal external muscles . these findings support the hypothesized link between cell cyclins and axon guidance.

the microarray data does not indicate a significant change in cell cyclin expression in axon guidance mutants. but in view of the robo gof results, we decided to analyze the cyclin expression in the axon guidance mutants slit, robo, and robo <dig>  consistent with the microarray data, there are no visible quantitative cyclin expression changes in these mutants. yet several major anatomical rearrangements in the cyclin expressing cells are evident. in wild type embryos, cyclin staining is visible from the dorsal side up to and at the midline. in the mutants for slit  and robo <dig> , there is a distinct gap in cyclin staining around the midline, and no dorsal cyclin-expressing cells are visible. at the midline, slit and robo <dig> mutants show wt-like cyclin staining. in robo mutants  no apparent change is observed.

CONCLUSIONS
midline crossing in drosophila is a model of choice for axon guidance, and yet we are only beginning to understand the role of transcription in the control of axon guidance. control does occur through protein translation. in such a spatially and temporally fine-tuned process, it is intuitive that transcription would also be involved. previous work in flies and mice points in this direction; the role of transcription factors is also emerging as very relevant, as reviewed in  <cit> . to investigate this topic we have undertaken a whole-genome expression study of mutants and transgenics of the key axon guidance genes. if control of midline crossing proceeds through transcription, the genetic perturbations induced in the mutants and transgenics should reveal clusters enriched for genes known to be involved in axon guidance. we also investigated the expression patterns of known axon guidance genes during normal development in a wild type microarray time course, using a previously published microarray data set.

we have found that the hopach package provides a robust, yet flexible, approach to clustering gene expression data. hopach is one of several hybrid algorithms  <cit>  which are gaining popularity in the microarray community. the extension of hopach proposed here has the advantage that all genes can be assigned to a cluster, even when all pair-wise distances cannot be stored in computer memory. also, the assignment of genes to clusters are based on bootstrap membership values, accounting directly for variability and making results reproducible  <cit> .

to characterize clusters, we recommend integrating gene annotations from multiple complementary controlled vocabularies. in this study we used go and apoge, which combine the bulk of literature knowledge with nascent efforts towards a complete genetic expression characterization in drosophila. when co-expression in microarray data is coupled with a shared rna expression pattern and/or shared terms in the go vocabulary, gene annotation via the "guilt by association" paradigm utilized so often in functional genomics becomes a much less tenuous method. for a specific cluster space, we used two independent data sets – a mutant/transgenic data set and a time course data set – and focused on genes which are co-expressed on both data sets. this approach is conceptually similar to techniques where two different axes are used, such as 2-d electrophoresis protein separation.

our analysis revealed clear co-expression of axon guidance genes in both the gof/lof data and the developmental time course. this finding indicates that transcription does in fact play a role in control of midline crossing. we identified several clusters containing many genes known to be relevant in midline crossing, but also numerous less well characterized genes. cluster ag <dig> is one of the most interesting clusters; genes such as dock, plexb, cam, cadn, caps, spen, fsket, con, rhogap19d, rac <dig>  and shot belong to this cluster. by querying apoge for spatial/temporal expression patterns of interest, we were able to immediately identify several dozen candidates for further studies. we have selected a pool of candidates meeting both of the following criteria: 1) membership in a selected axon guidance cluster , and 2) a known pattern of expression in the wild-type cns, according to apoge. in short, these genes are present in the right time and place to be involved in axon guidance, and further, their expression patterns are perturbed when the guidance process is disrupted. this candidate pool is thus a very attractive target for genetic analysis, the more so because many candidate genes are already represented by mutant stocks in publically available collections. sensitized genetic backgrounds, such as the slit and robo heterozygotes, have been successfully used in the past to identify additional genes involved in pathfinding  <cit> . we suggest using trans-heterozygote analysis to search for interactions between  candidate genes within the same cluster , and  candidate genes and key axon guidance genes 

our analysis suggests that known axon guidance genes may also be involved in hemocyte migration. cluster ag <dig> contains a significant number of genes expressed in hemocytes, the drosophila blood cells. hemocytes migrate during development, with the vegf pathway involved in the guidance process. we observed through rna expression analysis that hemocyte migration does not proceed normally in slit and slit.robo – hemocytes are absent in the central segments of the embryo. in robo <dig>  a double mutant for genes robo and robo <dig> , hemocyte migration is normal, even though the cns phenotype is the same as in slit and slit.robo. hence, we speculate that slit may function independently of its robo receptors in this context. blood vessel migration has been linked in mammals to the same molecular processes as axon guidance during recent studies  <cit> . both slit and robo have been implicated in several ways in the vascularization system of vertebrates  <cit> . since vascularization is a more recent evolutionary development than axon guidance  <cit> , it appears that some of the molecules involved in axon guidance may have been co-opted by vascularization mechanisms fairly early during evolution. prompted by the observation that numerous cell cyclin genes are present in a few clusters in our microarray data, we analyzed rna and protein patterns of cyclins in axon guidance mutants and transgenics. we examined several robo gof , because they show the strongest overexpression in the cyclin cluster of the axon guidance microarray data. we also studied the lof mutants of each of the key axon guidance genes slit, robo and robo <dig>  the overexpression of robo is accompanied with an increase in rna and protein levels of several cyclins. we also observe that cyclin expressing cells are dislocated in slit and in the double robo <dig> mutants. the cyclin expressing cells are visible away from the midline, exactly the opposite direction of the axons that are stalled at the midline in these two mutants. our results suggest that coordinated expression of cyclins may play a role in timing the midline crossing process. the role of cell cyclins might be to adequately time the developmental state of the neurons and to assure that all the multiple signaling pathways for axon guidance are working in the proper time and location, similar to the role cyclins play in the checkpoints in cell division  <cit> .

in conclusion, this study has shown that axon guidance is under transcriptional control. we have also observed that genes transcriptionally regulated in axon guidance mutants and transgenics are expressed in hemocytes, indicating that blood vessel migration may employ a mechanism involving axon guidance molecules. furthermore, our results suggest that coordinated expression of cell cyclins may play a role in timing the midline crossing process. together, these results provide new insights into the roles of axon guidance genes in vivo and demonstrate the validity of our whole genome approach as a method to study transcriptional networks in other biological systems.
