BACKGROUND
recent studies of tailed-phages have shown their enormous numbers and wide overall diversity  <cit> , but relatively few studies have had as a long-range goal an attempt to analyze the range of diversity in tailed-phages that infect a particular bacterial species or cluster of species . we are interested in the diversity of dsdna tailed-bacteriophages that infect salmonella; such analyses of enteric bacteria enjoy the major benefit of the huge amount of previous genetic and biochemical characterization of the proteins encoded by the escherichia coli and salmonella enterica "model system" phages. many members of the caudovirales  specific for salmonella species have been reported, but no careful comparison of these many phages has been done with a goal of understanding the detailed nature of the diversity of these viruses. in  <dig>  boyd recognized that s. enterica serovar typhimurium carried "symbiotic bacteriophages", which we now call prophages  <cit> . genomic sequencing has shown that essentially all salmonellae carry prophages  <cit> . some of these prophages are fully functional and some are clearly defective and no longer competent to program a complete phage lytic cycle.

temperate phages often modify the host cell surface lipopolysaccharide upon lysogenization in a process called "lysogenic conversion." salmonella phage ε <dig>  the subject of this report, is a temperate phage that was isolated in the 1950s  <cit>  that was historically important in the proof of this phenomenon  <cit> . previous studies have provided an early genetic map for ε <dig>  and identified the conversion genes as well as the virion o-antigen polysaccharide receptor-recognizing tailspike encoding gene  <cit> , and ε <dig> will only adsorb to and thus infect its salmonella enterica serovar anatum host cell if the latter carries an ε <dig> prophage  <cit> . this type of modification of surface polysaccharides has been implicated in bacterial virulence  <cit> . we report here the genome sequence of phage ε <dig> and compare it to its relatively close p22-like relatives.

RESULTS
 <dig>  analysis of the ε <dig> genome sequence
double-stranded dna from ε <dig> carrying the clear plaque mutation c <dig> was sequenced. the alterations in the clear mutant c <dig> strain were determined to affect genes  <dig> and  <dig> . the sequencing runs assembled into a single circular sequence, and its annotated genome sequence is arbitrarily opened at the 5'-end of the small terminase subunit gene according to convention with this type of phage. the genome is  <dig> bp long and is  <dig> % g+c which is somewhat lower than the host bacterium 53%  <cit> . the ε <dig> genome is predicted to contain  <dig> protein-coding genes  and genes for at least two antisense rnas, sar and q antisense rna. a complete list and description of the genes is presented in table s <dig> as additional file  <dig>  comparison of proteins predicted to be encoded by these  <dig> genes with the extant database  along with the gene order and orientation show clearly that ε <dig> is a p22-like member of the larger "lambdoid" phage group. its morphogenetic genes show a clear one-to-one relationship with those of phage p <dig>  while its early regions show a typical mosaic relationship with other lambdoid phages. of the  <dig> predicted genes, only seven  do not have a phage- or prophage-borne match in the current database; of these, gene  <dig> matches numerous bacterial genes of unknown function. space limitations preclude citation of all the molecular and genetic studies that have lead to the current understanding of the genes in the lambdoid phages .

 <dig>  the ε <dig> genes
a. early left operon
the ε <dig> early left operon contains  <dig> open reading frames, all of which have homology to genes in currently known lambdoid phages. the first gene in this operon, gene  <dig>  encodes a homolog of the highly studied λ transcriptional antitermination n protein that has high similarity in its c-terminal region  to the c-terminal regions of orthologues in other lambdoid phages, however its n-terminal  <dig> aas are at best only 62% identical to those proteins. since the c-terminal part is thought to be involved in association with host rna polymerase and the boxb-nut rna site  <cit> , it seems likely that the ε <dig> protein has a novel boxb specificity. immediately transcriptionally downstream  of gene  <dig>  genes  <dig> through  <dig> are somewhat similar to and syntenic with the parallel region of p22-like phage st64t. these include homologues of phage λ ciii  and kil  genes, which control establishment of lysogeny and inhibition of host septation, respectively. genes  <dig> through  <dig> encode the following proteins that are likely to be involved in catalyzing homologous recombination: a p <dig> type anti-recbcd protein abc <dig>  a possible endonuclease, a bacterial type single-strand dna binding protein, and a p22-type erf  protein. the putative gene 34-encoded nuclease is unusual in this context, and gene  <dig> is called a homologue of the well studied phage p <dig> erf protein only because their c-terminal  <dig> amino acids are 86% identical. parallel erf "domain swaps" have been discussed previously  <cit> , and these are consistent with the known structure of the protein  <cit> . downstream gene,  <dig>  appears to be an in-frame fusion of the n-terminus of a gene that is similar to eae found in this location in the p <dig> genome and a putative hnh homing endonuclease. interestingly, the latter is homologous to endonucleases from phage infecting gram-positive bacteria including lactobacillus phages a <dig>  and Φat <dig> . downstream genes  <dig> and  <dig> encode proteins that are identical to p <dig> eaf and orf <dig>  respectively, while genes 25- <dig> specify proteins that are closely related to those of ε <dig> genes  <dig> through  <dig>  respectively . finally, genes  <dig> and  <dig> are oriented like their p <dig> homologues and encode putative integrase and excisionase proteins that are discussed in more detail below.

b. early right operon
the ε <dig> early right operon contains sixteen genes, all but two of which are homologous to known lambdoid phage early right operon genes. the first two genes in this operon are similar to lambdoid cro and cii genes, respectively, and the next four genes,  <dig> through  <dig>  are very similar to the phage es <dig> dna replication gene region; of these, ε <dig> gp <dig> is likely the origin binding protein because of its λ gpo homology and gp <dig> is a putative helicase  <cit> . genes  <dig> through  <dig>  represent a typically mosaic lambdoid "nin region" that includes homologues of λ and p <dig> nina, b, d, e, f and z genes. only the short gene  <dig> has no known homologues and gene  <dig> only has two closely related  homologues in sodalis glossinidius prophages  <cit> . the last gene in the operon  encodes a protein that is 98% identical to the phage λ gene q antitermination protein, and the putative q protein target  in ε <dig> is identical to that of phage λ, indicating that their target specificities are the same.

c. late operon
the lambdoid phage late operons are turned on by q antitermination and encode the genes for virion assembly and cell lysis. the ε <dig> virion is indistinguishable from the p <dig> virion by negative stain electron microscopy  <cit> , and most of the morphogenetic genes of ε <dig> are closely related to those of p <dig>  the only major differences are in ε <dig> genes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the p <dig> gene  <dig> homologue is partly deleted relative to ε <dig> . homologues of genes  <dig> and  <dig> encode proteins in p <dig> that are released with the dna during injection, and  <dig> encodes the tailspike . sds polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels of the proteins of the ε <dig> virions are nearly identical to those of p <dig> except for a small size difference in the ejection protein gp <dig>  the tailspike protein and, the presence of a strong ~ <dig> kda band that is not present in p <dig> virions  <cit> . n-terminal sequence analysis of the latter band excised from such gels gave a sequence of nh2-anpnf , indicating that it is encoded by gene  <dig>  and that its n-terminal methionine is removed. this protein is 97% identical to the dec protein of phage l that has been shown to make virions more stable to magnesium ion chelation  <cit> .

d. integration
by homology with other lambdoid phages that integrate into trna genes, the putative integration attachment site  of ε <dig> is found just downstream of the int  gene within a  <dig> bp sequence that is identical to part of the trna argu gene. this strongly suggests that ε <dig> integrates into, and in the process replaces, the 3'-portion of the argu gene in the salmonella chromosome. the closest known relative to ε <dig> integrase is that of the e. coli k <dig> defective prophage dlp <dig> which is also integrated into argu  <cit> . although these two integrases are only about 80% identical in sequence, most of the differences are outside the following very similar regions: amino acids 1– <dig>  145– <dig> and 300– <dig>  these similar regions include or overlap the target specificity generating "arm binding" n-terminal  and "core binding"  domains of λ integrase  <cit> , so identical target specificity of the ε <dig> and dlp <dig> integrases is reasonable. we note that several salmonella p22-like phages that integrate into the trna thrw gene, p <dig>  st <dig> and st64t, have integrases that are about 30% different from ε <dig> 

e. lysogenic conversion
phage ε <dig> has at least six genes  that should be, by their position and experimental work on homologues in other phages, expressed from the prophage. two of these,  <dig> and  <dig>  appear to be in the same operon and downstream of the prophage repressor gene  gene , but they have no matches in the current sequence database. genes  <dig> is a homologue of the p <dig> mnt maintenance repressor gene discussed below in the context of the "ant moron". genes  <dig> and  <dig> have similarity to genes known to be involved in surface polysaccharide modification, and ε <dig> is known to perform such modifications  <cit> . genes  <dig> and  <dig> proteins are very similar to phage-encoded bactoprenol-linked glucose flippases that translocate glucosyated undecaprenyl phosphate from the cytoplasmic face to the periplasmic face of the inner membrane and bactoprenol glucosyl transferases that catalyze transfer of the glucose from udp-glucose to the above prenyl intermediate, respectively. genes in these two families are designated gtra and gtrb  <cit> , respectively. in addition, highly sequence variable but similarly sized genes encoding integral membrane proteins, called gtrc here, are found immediately transcriptionally downstream of gtra and gtrb  in similar operons in numerous other phages, prophages, and bacterial chromosomes . in the best studied cases, shigella flexneri temperate phages sfii, sfv and sfx, their similar operons are known to be responsible for enzymatic modification of the o-antigen polysaccharide to give "serotype conversion" of the bacterial host by the prophage. these downstream variable genes have in some cases been shown to be serotype-specific glucosyl transferases that add various glucosyl residues to the o-antigen backbone repeat. the first two genes, gtra and gtrb, are highly conserved and not thought to be serotype specific, while gtrc genes are serotype specific  <cit> . thus, the ε <dig> genes 20– <dig>  which appear to constitute an operon since the three genes are arranged with very little or no space between them, are almost certainly responsible for the conversion of salmonella from serotype  <dig> , <dig> to serotype  <dig> , <dig> by the ε <dig> prophage   <cit> .

the ε <dig> gene  <dig> protein is moderately similar  to proteins encoded by genes that lie in the gtrc position of several otherwise very similar operons in s. enterica genomes  and serovar typhi ct <dig> . further analysis of the currently available  database results in fifty-one "gtrc" genes, most of which lie in apparently intact operons with adjacent gtra and gtrb genes in bacterial genomes. these putative gtrc genes fall into nine different sequence types whose encoded proteins are at best 40% identical . some of these types have very little sequence similarity . gtrc type proteins gtrii, gtrv and gtrx, encoded by shigella phages , have been shown to have nine transmembrane helices  <cit> , and all of the nine types of gtrc protein in the salmonella operons are very strongly predicted to have between nine and eleven transmembrane helices . the ε <dig> gtrc protein, which is predicted to have nine or ten transmembrane segments, is a unique type. we note that a substantial majority of the  <dig> "bacterial" gtrc genes in figure 1b are adjacent to gtrb and gtra genes and reside in prophages. these include p22-like prophages in the genomes of salmonella serovars arizonae, choleraesuis, dublin, hadar, heidelberg, and paratyphi a; and; apparently defective phage p2-like prophages in serovars agona, kentucky, newport, saintpaul, typhimurium, and virchow; and, a phage λ-like prophage in serovar schwarzengrund. the fact that gtrabc operons are associated with three very different temperate phage types  suggests that these operons are evolutionarily important to the salmonella temperate phages and the hosts that harbor them. the large majority of these prophage-borne gtrabc operons appear to be intact, but in most cases functionality has not yet been demonstrated experimentally. nonetheless, it seems clear that salmonella serotype, like shigella serotype, is frequently modified by the prophages they carry. presumably, phage carry these genes because they give their prophage host  a selective advantage.

f. control of gene expression
gene  <dig> encodes a protein that is similar to other lambdoid prophage repressors. its c-terminal protease domain is about 80% identical to the repressors of phage λ and hk <dig>  for example, but its dna binding n-terminal portion is only about 50% identical to its closest known relatives in phages l, vt2-sa and ni <dig>  thus, the ε <dig> repressor almost certainly has the same reca-mediated inactivation mechanism in its c-terminal domain as phage λ  <cit> , but likely has a different operator binding specificity; the ε <dig> cro  protein, which should bind the same operators as the repressor, is ≤ 42% identical to known lambdoid cro proteins. we have identified putative pl and pr promoters , and located just upstream of these promoters is a consensus sequence wtacrawwtgtat that may represent the operator sites for ε <dig> 

the λ cii protein activates several promoters required for establishment of lysogeny. the ε <dig> homologue, gp <dig>  is weakly similar to known cii proteins in its n-terminal portion, but its c-terminal putative rna polymerase binding domain is highly similar to other cii proteins . nonetheless, there are ttgcn6ttgc/t sites in reasonable positions in the predicted repressor establishment  and gene q anti-sense  promoter sequences that suggest the target sequence for ε <dig> cii is the same or very similar to that of p <dig> and λ cii  <cit> . interestingly, there are two ttgcn6ttgc sites upstream of gtra suggesting that cii may also activate transcription of the conversion cassette in ε <dig> 

our analysis of the wildtype ε <dig> genes  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  and surrounding regions shows four differences from the c <dig> clear plaque mutant, whose genome was sequenced here. these are single amino acid changes, f46v  in gp <dig>  and k14e and n41s  in gp <dig> . the two changes in gp <dig> alter positions that should be in the n-terminal dna-binding domain according to the structure of the parallel region in the phage λ cii protein  <cit> , so the lysogeny defect in c <dig> are almost certainly due to the above changes in gene  <dig> and/or  <dig>  these findings confirm a previous complementation analysis which indicated that the c <dig> mutation was caused by a defect in two different genes  <cit> . in addition to the regulatory proteins mentioned above in this section, ε <dig> encodes unambiguous homologues of the early  and late  transcriptional antitermination proteins found in other lambdoid phages . these are discussed further below.

 <dig>  evolution and diversity of the p22-like phages that infect salmonella
a. p22-like prophages
several salmonella phages and prophages are known to have virion assembly proteins that are highly related to p <dig> and ε34; phages p <dig>  ε <dig>  st64t and st <dig>  and prophages in the fully sequenced genomes of salmonella enterica serovar paratyphi a strain atcc  <dig>  <cit>  and serovar choleraesuis strain sc-b <dig>  <cit> . these two prophages extend from genes spa <dig> through spa <dig> in paratyphi and from sc <dig> through sc <dig> in choleraesuis; we call these previously unnamed prophages "para1" and "scho1", respectively. similar prophages are present in salmonella serovars arizonae , dublin , hadar , and heidelberg  that are not analyzed here because their genomes are incomplete . figure  <dig> shows that these phages have a mosaic genome structure typical of the temperate phages . these two prophages contain apparently intact orthologues of all of the genes that are known to be essential in the very well-studied phage p <dig>  these include all of the genes required for control of phage gene expression, dna replication, virion assembly and lysis. in theory, point mutations could have inactivated nearly any of these prophage genes, but there are many examples of fully functional genes, even in quite highly degraded prophages that are very likely much older than scho <dig> and para <dig>  <cit> .

b. evolution and diversity of the late operon
the morphogenetic regions of the salmonella p22-like phages are much more like one another than they are like the parallel regions of p22-like phages that infect e. coli or s. flexneri. for example, the coat proteins  of the salmonella-infecting members of the group listed above are all >99% identical proteins except that of scho <dig> which is about 75% identical to the others. on the other hand the coat proteins of p22-like phages hk <dig> and cus- <dig> that infect e. coli  <cit>  and shigella phage sf <dig>  <cit>  are much more distantly related, with 14–28% identity to the salmonella phages. it appears that there has been little if any exchange of genetic material corresponding to the ε <dig> gene 1– <dig> region between the salmonella p22-like phages and the e. coli/shigella p22-like phages.

the virion assembly genes of the six salmonella phage genomes are very similar , with a few exceptions as follows:  very similar homologues of the phage l dec protein  are encoded by the rightmost genes of the ε <dig>  st <dig>  st64t and para <dig> genomes in figure  <dig>  but are not encoded by p <dig> and scho <dig>   unlike the other morphogenetic genes , there are significant differences in the lengths of the homologues of ε <dig> gene  <dig>  the p <dig> and scho <dig> gene  <dig> homologues have substantial internal deletions relative to the others, and their amino acid sequences have diverged substantially from the others. the role of this gene is unknown, although in p <dig> it is not essential in the laboratory  <cit> .  the tail and ejection proteins are more variable than the other virion assembly proteins . the tailspike genes show an interesting relationship in which the n-terminal head-binding domains  are all quite similar; the ε <dig> domain is the most divergent with about 75% identity to the others. the remaining c-terminal portions of the tailspikes are present in three forms  which are not recognizably similar in sequence; this receptor-recognition domain binds and cleaves the bacterial surface o-antigen polysaccharide  <cit> . atomic structures of both domains of the p <dig> tailspike have been determined, and the c-terminal domain has an unusual β-helix structure  <cit> . the c-terminal domains of ε <dig> and scho <dig> tailspikes have high β-helix predictions  <cit> , and the ε <dig> tailspike is resistant to denaturing agents and proteolysis , suggesting that they may have similar overall structures.  gene  <dig> of ε <dig>  whose protein product is ejected with the dna, is very similar to that of e. coli phage cus- <dig> , so gene  <dig> has clearly enjoyed exchange with phages that currently infect different host species. thus, even in this small sampling, it is apparent that variation is greater in the genes that are thought to interact with the bacterium during the injection process. such hyper-variation has been noticed previously in the tail fibers of long-tailed phages  <cit> , but not with the short-tailed ones. such variations are presumably the result of evolutionary sparring involving the physical interaction between the phage virions and their hosts in the first steps of infection.

two other parts of the late operon are also of interest, the lysis genes and the "moron" immediately 5' of the tailspike gene. the lysis module of lambdoid phages consists of four genes, a holin, a lysin, and homologues of λ rz and rz <dig> proteins  <cit> . there are three apparently nonhomologous types of holins and three types of lysins present in the six salmonella p22-like phages in figure  <dig>  yet each of these "lysis cassettes" functions to lyse salmonella. the second region, between the tailspike gene  and the rest of the late operon, is variable in length, has no function in morphogenesis or lysis, and contains different sets of genes in different phages. by these criteria this region fits the definition of a "moron", a  independently expressed gene or group of genes that appears to be inserted into a phage operon when that operon is compared across various related phages  <cit> . this region, which we call here the "ant moron" because it often harbors a homologue to the p <dig> antirepressor gene ant is diagrammed in figure  <dig>  in phage p <dig> this region has been studied in some depth, and it contains genes for two protein repressors , an antisense rna  which control the expression of the antirepressor  gene  <cit>  . in addition, this region in p <dig> includes genes that encode a superinfection exclusion protein   <cit>  and two genes of unknown function . the parallel ε <dig> ant moron contains an apparently functional immunity i region  and two genes  of unknown function, one of which is a homologue of gene hkcb which lies in a similar position in the e. coli phage hk <dig> genome  <cit> . the st64t, st <dig> and para <dig> have ant morons that are nearly identical to one another and contain only the mnt repressor gene and a gene of unknown function; the parallel scho <dig> region has a different gene of unknown function and what appears to be a degraded  arc repressor gene. in order to further understand the variability of the ant moron, we include ten other currently known completely sequenced non-salmonella p22-like phages and prophages in figure  <dig>  these phages all have morphogenetic genes that are syntenic to p <dig> , and they have ant moron regions that vary from its absence in sf <dig>  <cit> , apse- <dig>  <cit> , apse- <dig>  <cit>  and ϕsg <dig>  <cit>  to the p <dig>  <cit> /cus- <dig>  <cit> )/uti- <dig> /apec- <dig>  types which each contain six predicted genes.

it is curious that these different morons are present at this location in these phages, but no morons are present in any other locations in their morphogenetic gene clusters. perhaps this is the only location that can tolerate such an insertion? on the other hand, perhaps successful moron insertion is extremely rare, and since each of the ant morons has some sequence similarity to at least one of the others, it is plausible that a single ancestral moron inserted at this position in the past, and the variation that currently exists is due to more frequent insertions and deletions that modified the original insertion. from the sequence differences, it seems clear that these different morons have non-identical functions at present, and only the roles of the p <dig> version have been studied. interestingly, the p <dig> ant moron is thought to have a  role in controlling the level of tailspike protein produced during infection by affecting the frequency which plate initiated rna polymerase molecules transcribe through the ant moron into the tailspike gene  <cit> . the mnt and arc repressors may have a role in this process, so the ant morons of scho <dig>  hk <dig>  sf <dig>  apse- <dig>  apse- <dig> and ϕsg <dig> may lack this ability. the fact that the hk <dig> and scho <dig> morons have what appear to be degraded ant genes suggests that they may at one time have had a functional antirepressor gene  in this location that is no longer needed. the apparent lack of arc genes in the cus- <dig> and hs- <dig> ant type morons, in spite of the presence of putative antirepressor genes, suggests that they have a mechanism for controlling the later that differs from p <dig>  since all sixteen of the phages shown in figure  <dig> have syntenic sets of morphogenetic genes, the wide differences observed in the ant morons, ten types in sixteen genomes, indicate that this region has a much higher rate of genetic flux than the rest of the late operon.

c. evolution and diversity in the early operons
the early left  and early right  operons are highly mosaic, even among the salmonella p22-like phages that have highly similar virion assembly genes, and there is ample evidence for past genetic exchanges with other members of the larger "lambdoid" phage group. for example, p <dig>  ε <dig> and para <dig> have late antitermination genes that are 99% identical to phage λ gene q protein, and putative origin recognition dna replication proteins of ε <dig> and scho <dig> are 96% and 97% identical, respectively, to the es <dig> homologue, and the parallel st <dig> replication protein is 98% identical to the very different coliphage hk <dig> homologue . clearly some of these gpq-like and replication proteins have been exchanged independently and quite recently between the salmonella-infecting p22-like phage and members of the larger lambdoid group, since they have not had time to diverge significantly from their relatives in otherwise very different phages.

d. dna binding specificity of regulatory proteins
development of the phage life cycle depends on a number of nucleotide sequence-specific nucleic acid-protein interactions. for example, in the lambdoid phages such specificity is observed in early operon repression, replication origin binding, dna packaging, integration, and the transcriptional antiterminations that give rise to early and late transcripts  <cit> . for each of these, different specificities are known in different phages. these biologically important relationships are not indicated by different gene colors in figure  <dig> because the proteins with different specificities are nonetheless homologous to one another. overall, the extent of diversity that is required to alter the nucleic acid binding specificity is not known , and of course laboratory examples are known in which single amino acid changes can alter specificity. nonetheless, it seems reasonable to estimate that proteins with more than 90% sequence identity might be expected to have the same, or at least similar, target specificity. table  <dig> shows the comparison of these six proteins in the p22-like salmonella phages. only the packaging specificity appears to be the same in all six phages. the other five proteins show between two and five different predicted specificities . for example, each of the six repressors is very different in sequence from the others, except those of st64t and st <dig>  which are identical. and the late antitermination proteins  of these six phages are likely to have the specificities of phages λ or sf <dig>  except st <dig> which is an apparently "new" type. it is interesting to note that among the six ε <dig> proteins in table  <dig>  three are predicted to have specificities that do not to exist in previously analyzed phages. thus, it seems that current analyses are yet close to having a complete list of the sequence  types for these important proteins. this subset of these phages' genes also shows clearly that recent shuffling of these genes has occurred within the salmonella p22-like phages. for example, para <dig> encodes repressor and dna replication proteins that are 100% and 97% identical to those of st <dig> and st64t, respectively, while both of these proteins are very different from each other in st <dig> and st64t. similarly, para <dig> has a phage λ  type late antitermination protein, indicating another difference from phages st <dig> and st64t. we cannot deduce the directionality of these exchange event, or whether there were intermediary phages, but clearly these genes have been exchanged among these three phages so recently that one protein has not changed at all and the other only changed 3% since their last common ancestor.

 <dig>  on each line, the table indicates  the experimentally-determined specificty according to the prototypical phage with that specificty. if two proteins have ≥ 92% amino acid sequence identity, the specificty is predicted to be the same, and the percent amino acid sequence identity to the prototypical protein is given in parentheses. if two unstudied proteins have <92% amino acid sequence identity their specificity is predicted to be different and one was arbitrarily chosen to be the prototype .

 <dig>  the trna gene into which phage integrates is shown below the int protein comparisons.

 <dig>  has 72% overall amino acid sequence identity to its phage hk <dig> homologue, but amino acids 74– <dig> are very similar to the hk <dig> protein .

 <dig>  both have 82% amino acid sequence identity to its phage sf <dig> homologue; it is not known if proteins with this level of difference could have the same target specificity.

 <dig>  n-terminal domain only . the whole ε <dig> and scho <dig> putative replication origin recognition proteins  are 96% and 97% identical to the phage es <dig> homologue  <cit> . their n-terminal regions are 94% identical to phage λ gpo amino acids  <dig> through  <dig>  and the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids have been shown to bind the origin  <cit> .

 <dig>  shown experimentally to have the same specificity as λ gpq  <cit> .

 <dig>  phages sf <dig>  hk <dig> and λ do not infect salmonella, but the indicated salmonella phage protein is predicted to have the same specificity as one of these phages.

CONCLUSIONS
we determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the salmonella p22-like lambdoid phage ε <dig>  and found that it has novel predicted specificities for host polysaccharide modification enzymes, virion receptor binding, integration, early transcriptional antitermination protein and prophage repressor. we used its sequence to help understand the previously unanalyzed sequences of two salmonella prophages. these sequences, along with the previously known phage p <dig>  st64t and st <dig> genome sequences, give a much clearer picture of the variation among this rather closely related group of salmonella phages. in spite of this very close relationship, genome mosaicism is found to be prevalent in the early regions of their genomes.
