BACKGROUND
biotech industries are becoming more and more successful in providing enzymatic solutions to an ever increasing number of industrial processes. the combination of high-throughput screening methods and the low cost of full genome sequencing has greatly sped up the process of identifying and isolating genes that match the criteria for a given industrial process. besides being able to catalyze the enzymatic reaction in the industrial process, the enzymes must also be able to survive the often harsh industrial conditions. one of the frequently required capabilities of an industrial enzyme is the ability to function at high temperatures in either an acidic or alkaline environment. enzymes with such properties can either be designed in silico or by high-throughput screening of microorganisms. high-throughput screening is often the first choice because optimization of an existing enzyme to an industrial process is much simpler than in silico design. the high-throughput screening is performed at conditions made to mimic the industrial process in order to find existing enzymes already able to cope with the industrial environment. again, these study enzymes are often found in microorganisms that are able to grow in extreme conditions. by taking advantage of the many published and freely available genomes, it is often possible to make an educated guess of which microorganisms would be interesting to screen for a certain enzyme. screening of such microorganisms will often provide an extensive battery of enzymes optimized for the selected screening conditions.

a soil screening conducted by novozymes a/s resulted in the discovery of a novel strain of alicyclobacillus . the thermoacidophilic bacterial strain was isolated at low ph  and high temperature . the genus was identified by  <dig> s rrna analysis and showed a significant phylogenetic distance from the previously known strains of alicyclobacillus . the strain was deposited in the dmsz bacteria collection as alicyclobacillus sp. dsm  <dig>  a gene for a putative g <dig> peptidase was identified in a gene library screening for secreted enzymes using transposon assisted signal trapping   <cit>  of alicyclobacillus sp. dsm  <dig> .

the peptidase showed significant sequence similarity to the peptidase family g <dig>  <cit> , a family otherwise thought to be limited to the filamentous fungal species of the ascomycota phylum  <cit> . the characterized proteins known to be part of the g <dig> family are aspergilloglutamic peptidase  from aspergillus niger  <cit> , scytalidoglutamic peptidase  from scytalidium lignicolum  <cit> , acid peptidases b and c  from cryphonectria parisitica  <cit> , penicillium marneffei acid proteinase   <cit> , talaromyces emersonii glutamic peptidase  <dig>   <cit>  and bcacp <dig> from botryotinia fuckeliana  <cit> .

based on sequence homology, five bacterial and a single archaeal protein have been annotated as putative g <dig> peptidases at the merops peptidase database, but biochemical characterizations have not been carried out to confirm their function  <cit> . structural homology to fungal g <dig> peptidases and conservation of the catalytic residues indicate that pepg <dig> from alicyclobacillus sp. dsm  <dig> could be a bacterial g <dig> peptidase. in order to further examine its properties, we have amplified pepg <dig> from alicyclobacillus sp. dsm  <dig> genomic dna and heterologously expressed it in b. subtilis. following purification, pepg <dig> was characterized according to its physical properties, such as ph and temperature optimum and the effects of various protease inhibitors were determined. based on these results, we suggest that pepg <dig> can be annotated as a g <dig> peptidase.

RESULTS
phylogenetic analysis of peptidase family g1
previously, only g <dig> peptidases derived from filamentous fungi have been characterized and the peptidase family g <dig> was thought to be limited to filamentous fungi - more precisely fungi from the ascomycete phylum  <cit> . as the number of sequenced genomes increases, more and more hypothetical proteins are annotated based on sequence similarities to previously characterized proteins or protein signatures. the merops peptidase database   <cit>  has assigned sixty-six open reading frames  to family g <dig> with the majority being derived from ascomycetes. sixty of the orfs are from ascomycetes but six are supposedly non-peptidase homologs lacking one or both catalytic residues, thereby bringing the total number of ascomycete peptidases down to fifty-four. the g <dig> peptidases are found in the following ascomycete orders: eurotiales, pezizales, sordariales, leotiales, diaporthales, dothideales and pleosporales, with the vast majority of g <dig> peptidases originating from the eurotiales order . of the remaining six orfs in peptidase family g <dig>  five are from bacteria and one is from archaea. in addition, blast searches at ncbi identified one more archaeal and three more bacterial g <dig> peptidase homologs. a bootstrapped unrooted maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree  showed a clear distinction between ascomycete and bacterial/archaeal pepg <dig> peptidases. the ascomycete cluster a can be subdivided into two major clusters, termed b and c . all g <dig> peptidases derived from the eurotiales and leotiales orders had at least one paralog in each major cluster, as indicated in additional file  <dig> table s <dig>  this strongly indicates that gene duplication took place before species differentiation in the eurotiales and leotiales. each species, primarily in the eurotiales, contains numerous paralogs  <cit>  , which appears to be the result of extensive gene duplications within the species as many of the paralogs exhibit very high sequence similarity. the bootstrap confidence levels of the internal nodes of the ascomycete clusters were in general above  <dig> , indicating that the members of the different clusters are grouped correctly together. as expected, the bacterial and archaeal peptidase g <dig> orthologs were found to cluster separately from the ascomycetes, supported by a bootstrap confidence value of  <dig>  . the archaeal g <dig> peptidases were clustered together, but do not appear to be as divergent from the bacterial g <dig> peptidases as could be expected. a plausible explanation could be that "housekeeping genes" from archaea are bacterial in origin  <cit> , although this assumption is still heavily debated. another possibility could be that the introduction of g <dig> peptidases into archaea was facilitated by ancient horizontal gene transfer events. low bootstrap values prevent deduction of the mutual relationship between the bacterial g <dig> peptidases from the generated maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree, except for the observation that bacterial g <dig> peptidases from proteobacteria  and firmicutes  fall into two different clusters . several attempts to improve the confidence levels of the bacterial/archaeal part of the phylogentic tree, including restricting the phylogenetic analysis to the most conserved regions of the sequences, were unsuccessful. on the other hand, no significant changes in the layout of the phylogenetic tree were observed by using only the most conserved regions, indicating that the present layout of the phylogenetic tree is acceptable. a possible explanation as to why the bootstrap values could not be improved may be due to the highly divergent amino acid sequences, illustrated by the low sequence homology between both the bacterial orthologs  and the bacterial and fungal orthologs .

catalytic residues and secondary structure of pepg1
before the determination of the crystal structures of agp and sgp, several attempts at elucidating the catalytic residues of g <dig> peptidases were carried out. site-directed mutagenesis of conserved acidic residues was completed and the mutated enzymes were evaluated based on their catalytic activity. it is also known, that both agp and sgp are expressed as precursor proteins which are autocatalytically processed into mature proteins in acidic conditions. by selecting both mutants unable to catalyze the conversion of precursor into mature protein, and those lacking peptidase activity, a glutamine  and a glutamate  were believed to be the active site residues of g <dig> peptidases  <cit> . the almost simultaneous publications of the near identical crystal structures of sgp and agp verified the site-directed mutational studies and confirmed that the catalytic dyad in g <dig> peptidases consists of a glutamine and a glutamate residue  <cit> .

an alignment of all g <dig> peptidases from the merops database and pepg <dig> showed that the catalytic dyad was strictly conserved in pepg <dig> and all family g <dig> members, both characterized and putative. a simplified alignment showing the bacterial/archaeal members and the characterized fungal members are shown in figure  <dig>  the overall sequence similarities are, in general, low between the fungal and bacterial/archaeal peptidases, ranging from 24% to 30% amino acid identity. the crystal structure of sgp  <cit>  revealed seven highly conserved motifs clustered on the upper β-sheet surrounding the active site and substrate-binding sites. the presence and high conservation of these motifs in both pepg <dig> and the other non-fungal putative members of g <dig>  strongly suggest that these enzymes are related members of fungal g <dig>  most mutations found in the motifs are conservative and therefore the general tertiary structure and function of the regions should be unaffected. sgp has three disulfide bridges, however not all are conserved in other g <dig> peptidases  <cit> . one is unique for sgp and of the two others, the most highly conserved one is located between c <dig> and c <dig>  but is missing from eapc. the third disulfide bridge is specific to sgp and eapb and not found in any of the other fungal peptidases shown in the phylogenetic tree . none of the conserved cysteines are present in any of the bacterial or archaeal g <dig> homologs . disulfide bridge formation appears to have no direct effect on enzymatic activity but could result in more stable proteins as disulfide bridges are known to stabilize proteins at high temperatures  <cit> .

the structure determinations of agp and sgp revealed a previously undescribed fold, comprised of a β-sandwich with two seven stranded antiparallel β-sheets  <cit> . protein structure prediction of pepg <dig> using phyre  <cit>  identified agp and sgp as the closest homologs to pepg <dig> and predicted that pepg <dig> had all fourteen β-sheets needed for the two seven stranded antiparallel β-sheet fold unique for g <dig> peptidases. no significant structural homology was found towards other proteins. to further examine the pepg <dig> structure, a three-dimensional model structure was generated using the swiss-model structure homology-modeling server  <cit> . a model structure encompassing residues 65- <dig> of pepg <dig> was obtained , corresponding to the mature pepg <dig> enzyme without the signal peptide. the structural template for the model structure of pepg <dig> was sgp , which has  <dig> % sequence identity to pepg <dig>  stereochemistry of the backbone structure was evaluated by ramachandran maps. out of a total of  <dig> residues, only  <dig> were found in the disallowed and generously allowed regions. the procheck  <cit>  overall g factor, evaluating all torsion angles and bond lengths, was - <dig> , indicating a good-quality model  <cit> . the two antiparallel β-sheet fold was present in the pepg <dig> homology model, but two of the β-sheets were missing from the upper section . the missing β-sheets are not believed to influence the catalytic activity of g <dig> peptidases. the active site residues, q <dig> and e <dig>  were found to be solvent exposed on the concave surface of the upper β-sheet. both the orientations of the individual antiparallel β-sheets and the positions of active site residues in the pepg <dig> model are almost identical to the published structures of agp and sgp  <cit> . the high structural similarity strongly supports that pepg <dig> is a g <dig> peptidase.

sims et al  <cit>  showed that g <dig> proteins carry several characteristic protein signatures. investigation of the putative bacterial and archaeal g <dig> peptidases  identified three out of four protein signatures. the missing protein signature, pr <dig>  is composed of five sequence motifs , of which four of them roughly correspond to the conserved motifs surrounding the active site  <cit>  . a manual alignment of the pr <dig> protein signatures to pepg <dig> showed that, although not all residues are conserved, the changes are mostly conservative. the pr <dig> signature is based on an alignment of agp, sgp, eapb and eapc <cit> . the few sequences used for generating the pr <dig> protein signature strongly restricts the allowed residue deviations  and would account for why the protein signature was not identified in the bacterial and archaeal g <dig> peptidases.

identification and expression of pepg1
the gene for a putative g <dig> peptidase was identified in a gene library screening for secreted enzymes using transposon assisted signal trapping  <cit>  of alicyclobacillus sp. dsm  <dig> . the gene encoding pepg <dig> was pcr amplified from genomic dna of alicyclobacillus sp. dsm  <dig> and integrated by homologous recombination into the chromosome of b. subtilis mb <dig>  the signal peptide of pepg <dig> was replaced with a subtilisin-signal peptide for improved secretion in the b. subtilis host. signalp cleavage site prediction for pepg <dig> was l33da-sp  <cit> . expression of pepg <dig> was tested in three different liquid medias at two different temperatures. fermentation was continued for up to six days. the highest peptidase activity at ph  <dig> , 50°c towards azcl-collagen was observed after five days of growth in ps-i media. degradation of azcl-collagen resulted in the formation of a blue halo. the diameter of the halo was used as a rough measurement of activity.

purification of pepg1
purification of pepg <dig> was performed as described in the material and methods section. a troublesome and unexpected high affinity of pepg <dig> to the ion exchange column used in the final purification step, resulted in only a partial elution of pepg <dig> . fractions were analyzed for acid peptidase activity and as shown in figure  <dig> pepg <dig> was eluted continuously in a broad peak and not a sharp peak as expected. increased nacl concentrations were required to elute the remaining pepg <dig> . fractions with acid peptidase activity were pooled and analyzed by sds-page. a single polypeptide band of  <dig> kda was observed in the pooled fractions , very similar to the molecular weights of about  <dig> kda for agp and sgp <cit> . the total amount of purified protein was  <dig> mg/l. n-terminal sequencing was carried out on the purified protein and the following sequence n62fgwsasnwxgy, corresponding to the mature pepg <dig> peptidase, confirmed that the purified protein was pepg <dig> 

characterization of pepg1
pepg <dig> exhibited peptidase activity towards azcl-collagen, azcl-casein and bovine serum albumin. azcl-collagen was used for the characterization of pepg <dig> because of its higher stability at the experimental conditions  compared to azcl-casein and bovine serum albumin. g <dig> peptidases are characterized by optimal enzymatic activity at low ph  <cit> . peptidase activity for pepg <dig> was observed at ph values from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with a broad optimum ph range centered around ph  <dig>  at 37°c . the activity profile of pepg <dig> fits very well with the ph optimum of sgp, pmap- <dig> and tgp <dig>  <cit> . 60°c, at ph  <dig> , was found to be the optimal temperature for pepg <dig> proteolytic activity . temperature and ph optima fit the optimal growth conditions of the known thermophilic bacteria of the genus alicyclobacillus, more precisely 35-60°c at ph  <dig> - <dig>   <cit> . pepg <dig> was found to be a very stable protein, in regards to both the ph and temperature stability. prolonged incubation at ph values of up to  <dig> had only minor effects on peptidase activity. even at a ph of  <dig>  the residual activity was still more than 50% . incubation at 70°c for up to one hour caused some reduction in pepg <dig> activity, but more than 60% activity was retained after one hour incubation at 70°c . it was surprising that despite the lack of disulphide bridges, pepg <dig> had higher thermal stability than sgp. the single cysteine residue present in pepg <dig> is located in the n-terminal signal peptide and is removed from pepg <dig> after conversion of pepg <dig> into its mature form. sgp lost most of its activity after incubation at 70°c for fifteen minutes, despite its three disulfide bridges otherwise known to stabilize proteins at high temperatures  <cit> . an explanation for the higher stability of pepg <dig> could be due to the presence of a large number of electrostatic interactions and/or hydrophobic interactions, which are known to stabilize proteins at high temperatures.

effects of protease inhibitors and divalent cations on pepg <dig> activity
many aspartic peptidases are strongly inhibited by the microbial derived inhibitor, pepstatin  <cit> . however, a hallmark feature of the g <dig> peptidases is their insensitivity towards pepstatin. therefore, studies of pepg <dig> sensitivity towards four catalytic class-specific inhibitors, pepstatin, edta, pmsf and e- <dig> butane, n--l-leucyl)-agmatine, were performed in order to further characterize pepg <dig>  no significant inhibition was observed in the presence of the aspartic, serine and cysteine inhibitors, pepstatin, pmsf and e- <dig>  furthermore, pepg <dig> insensitivity towards edta suggests that metal ions are not required for activity . similar resistance to protease inhibitors are seen in fungal g <dig> peptidases  <cit> . insensitivity towards the aspartic peptidase inhibitor pepstatin, is a characteristic feature of g <dig> peptidases and supports the assignment of pepg <dig> to the g <dig> family.

relative activity is relative to the activity of pepg <dig> without inhibitor present.

oda and murao  <cit>  showed that by incubating sgp for  <dig> min with the divalent cations cu2+ and mn2+, a 50% increase in enzymatic activity occurred. studies were performed with various divalent cations, including cu2+ and mn2+, but only cu2+ had an effect on pepg <dig> enzymatic activity .

pepg <dig> activity in citric acid buffer ph  <dig>  was set at  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
here we report the first characterization of a non-eukaryotic glutamic protease from the bacteria alicyclobacillus sp. dsm  <dig>  alignment of pepg <dig> with the known members of peptidase family g <dig> showed that the catalytic dyad, q <dig> and e <dig>  was conserved which indicates that the enzymatic mechanism is comparable to the fungal enzymes of this family. in addition, the crystal structure of sgp identified seven highly conserved motifs of the polypeptide chain clustered around the active and substrate-binding site of sgp  <cit> . these motifs are highly conserved in pepg <dig>  furthermore, protein structure prediction of pepg <dig> by phyre  <cit>  found sgp and agp to be the closest homologs, which was supported by homology modeling of pepg <dig>  very high structural similarities were observed between the homology model of pepg <dig> and the crystal structures of agp and sgp  <cit> . a number of protein signatures have been linked to g <dig> peptidases and three out of four are present in pepg <dig>  despite the otherwise low sequence homology between pepg <dig> and the fungal g <dig> peptidases. the fourth signature could be identified by manual alignment and annotation of pepg <dig>  the above bioinformatic studies of pepg <dig> clearly support the entry of pepg <dig> into the peptidase family g <dig> 

to further validate the identity of pepg <dig>  pepg <dig> was cloned into the expression host b. subtilis. following expression and purification of pepg <dig>  the ph and temperature optima of the peptidase and its stability were tested. in agreement with all g <dig> peptidases, pepg <dig> exhibited highest activity in acidic conditions. pepg <dig> was found to be resistant towards serine, cysteine, metallo and aspartic class-specific inhibitors, including pepstatin. insensitivity to pepstatin is a hallmark feature of all g <dig> peptidases.

blast searches of the pepg <dig> sequence at ncbi identified several other putative bacterial g <dig> peptidases. if disregarding pepg <dig> homologs from related alicyclobacillus species, new pepg <dig> homologs are found in the bacterias amycolatopsis mediterranei, geobacillus sp. and catenulispora acidiphila along with archaeal homologs from acidilobus saccharovorans and picrophilus torridus. all of these homologs are between 40-50% identical to pepg <dig> and the active site residues, q and e, that together form the catalytic dyad  <cit> , are conserved in all homologs. the in vivo function of g <dig> peptidases in bacteria and archaea is presently unknown. the majority of the fungal species secreting g <dig> peptidases are pathogens  <cit> , in which the peptidases are most likely used to facilitate host tissue penetration and colonization by degrading structural proteins of the plant cell wall  <cit> . the habitat of many of the microorganisms secreting g <dig> peptidases is soil or in some cases more extreme habitats, such as high temperature acidic environments. an obvious function could be scavenging as suggested by fütterer et al, who sequenced and annotated the genome of the thermoacidophilic archaea, picrophilus torridus  <cit> .

the characterization of pepg <dig> presented in this manuscript along with the demonstrated presence of putative g <dig> peptidase homologs in an increasing number of non-fungal organisms strongly suggests that the non-fungal peptidase g <dig> homologs assigned to the merops peptidase family g <dig> are correctly annotated.
