BACKGROUND
p <dig> is a transcription factor that shares significant homology with the tumor suppressor protein p <dig> and mediates cellular functions such as cell cycle arrest, differentiation, senescence and apoptosis  <cit> . alternate promoter usage and splicing give rise to p <dig> variants differing at the n and c-terminus, p <dig> α and β forms being the predominant transactivation competent forms  <cit> . p <dig> and p <dig> bind common response elements and transactivate an overlapping set of target genes, though with differing efficiencies  <cit> . p <dig> knockout mice exhibit severe neurological, inflammatory and pheromonal defects but lack spontaneous tumor formation  <cit> . forced expression of p <dig> activates target genes like p <dig>  bax, igf bp <dig>  cycling, mdm <dig>  caspase- <dig>  etc and promotes apoptosis in both p <dig> positive as well as negative cell lines  <cit> .

cellular p <dig> protein is maintained at very low levels and activation is controlled at transcriptional as well as post-translational levels. p <dig> is induced in response to a range of dna damaging agents as well as during differentiation of many cell types  <cit> . multiple mechanisms like post-translational modifications, protein-protein interaction and sub-cellular compartmentalization regulate transactivation potential and apoptosis inducing property of p <dig>  <cit> . several viral and cellular proteins interact with p <dig> and regulate its activity  <cit> . while some of the interacting proteins enhance transactivation potential of p <dig> by stabilizing it  <cit> , others inhibit transactivation property of p <dig>  <cit> . p <dig> is also known to interact with and cooperate with other transcription factors to regulate gene expression  <cit> . interaction with c-abl through sh <dig> domain in response to dna damage results in phosphorylation at tyr <dig>  stabilization and activation  <cit> . c-abl can also activate p <dig> map kinase to phosphorylate p <dig> leading to its stabilization  <cit> .

src family kinases  are non receptor tyrosine kinases involved in the regulation of diverse cellular functions like proliferation, differentiation, survival, adhesion, motility and angiogenesis  <cit> . apart from a catalytic domain, they possess sh <dig>  sh <dig> and sh <dig> domains required for sub-cellular targeting and protein interaction and therefore have cellular functions dependent on catalytic activity as well as protein interaction domains  <cit> . hck is a sfk showing restricted expression in hematopoietic cells of myeloid and monocytic lineage and in embryonic stem cells  <cit> . it exists as two isoforms , which arise due to alternate translational start sites  <cit> . hck is activated in response to cytokines and is an important component of signaling pathways in activated macrophages  <cit> . hck levels increase during differentiation of monocytes and it plays a role in phagocytosis, adhesion, respiratory burst, granule secretion and apoptosis  <cit> . several proteins like cbl, stat- <dig>  wasp, wip, elmo, ack <dig> and c3g interact with hck through its sh <dig> domain  <cit> 

the mechanisms that regulate stability and pro-apoptotic activity of p <dig> are distinct from those used by p <dig> and regulation by tyrosine phosphorylation has been shown only for p <dig>  <cit> . though initial studies described tyr- <dig> as the major site of phosphorylation by cabl, it has been shown that several other tyrosine residues are also targeted  <cit> . but thus far, no other tyrosine kinase has been described to phosphorylate or regulate p <dig> activity. hck interacts with c-abl and they modulate each other's activity  <cit> . given the role of sfks in mediating survival and apoptotic pathways in cells, we investigated the role of hck in regulating p <dig> activity and function. our results identify p <dig> as a novel interacting partner and substrate of hck, and that hck regulates p <dig> through kinase dependent as well as independent functions. we also provide evidence for functional interaction between p <dig> and hck leading to regulation of p <dig> induced apoptosis.

RESULTS
hck interacts with p73α
we explored the possibility of p <dig> interacting with hck in vivo in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. p <dig> was detected in hck immunoprecipitates from cells expressing both hck and p <dig>  but not in cells expressing p <dig> alone suggesting their interaction in mammalian cells . p <dig> has polyproline sequences that could serve as interacting motifs for sh <dig> domain containing proteins. to determine whether hck and p <dig> form a complex through sh3-polyproline mediated interaction, in vitro binding experiments were carried out using glutathione-s-transferase  fusion proteins. recombinant fusion protein of gst with sh <dig> domain of hck  bound to glutathione sepharose beads was incubated with lysates of cos <dig> cells transfected with p73α and p73δ. p73δ is the shortest isoform which lacks the entire c-terminus including the sam domain <cit> . p73α and p73δ bound to gst-sh3-hck and not with gst alone . further, recombinant fusion protein of sh <dig> domain mutant  disabled for interaction  and gst-sh3-hck were incubated with lysates of cos <dig> cells transfected with p73α. p73α bound to gst-sh3-hck and not to gst or gst-msh3-hck  . it has been shown that upon dimethyl sulfoxide  treatment of hl- <dig> cells, both mrna and protein levels of p73α increase in a time dependent manner  <cit> . hck levels are also known to increase under these conditions  <cit> . to examine whether endogenous p <dig> interacts with hck under these conditions, we subjected lysates of differentiated hl- <dig> cells to immunoprecipitation using hck antibody. western blotting with p <dig> antibody showed that p73α was co-immunoprecipitated with hck and not with control antibody . our results suggest that endogenous hck and p <dig> interact under physiological conditions.

hck co-expression results in phosphorylation of p73
since p <dig> interacted with hck, the possibility of p <dig> being a substrate of hck in vivo was explored. cos <dig> cells were transfected with ha-p73α expression construct with and without hck and whole cell lysates subjected to western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. when p <dig> was co-expressed with hck, phosphotyrosine was seen on the polypeptide corresponding to p <dig> in mobility as detected by reprobing the blot using p <dig> antibody . cells transfected with p <dig> or hck alone did not show any corresponding phosphotyrosine containing peptides. phosphorylation of p <dig> was dependent on kinase activity of hck since co-expression of a catalytically inactive mutant kd-hck  did not show tyrosine-phosphorylated polypeptide at the corresponding position . to confirm phosphorylation of p <dig> more directly, p <dig> was immunoprecipitated from cells expressing p73α and hck. phosphorylated p <dig> could be detected in immunoprecipitates of p73α with hck over-expression whereas it was not observed with over-expressed kd-hck . hck also phosphorylated p73β, dependent on its kinase activity . these results suggested that hck expression could induce tyrosine phosphorylation of p73α and β in vivo. to check whether hck phosphorylation on p <dig> is a direct event, in vitro phosphorylation assay was carried out. recombinant gst and gst-p73α bound to glutathione-sepharose beads were incubated with purified hck enzyme and γ32p atp. proteins were analyzed by sds-page, stained and the gel dried for phosphor imaging. hck phosphorylated gst-p73α and not gst alone . protein expression was visualized by commassie staining of the gel prior to exposure . this result showed that hck could directly phosphorylate p73α.

endogenous p <dig> gets tyrosine phosphorylated upon activation of hck
treatment of myelomonocytic cell lines with mercuric chloride  has been shown to specifically activate hck, and has been used to identify substrates of hck  <cit> . treatment of hl- <dig> cells with dmso showed an increase in protein levels of both p73α and hck . to find out whether endogenous p <dig> gets tyrosine phosphorylated upon activation of hck, hl- <dig> cells were differentiated for  <dig> hours with dmso and then subjected to hgcl <dig> treatment. the lysates were immunoprecipitated with p <dig> and control antibody. it was observed that endogenous p <dig> gets tyrosine phosphorylated upon activation of hck as determined by western blotting with phosphotyrosine antibody . the left panel of fig. 2e shows the western blots of whole cell lysate  with phosphotyrosine, p <dig> and hck antibodies.

hck phosphorylates p73α predominantly on tyr28
to identify the site of phosphorylation on p73α by hck, different tyrosine mutants were constructed by pcr based site directed mutagenesis in which tyrosine residues that are predicted targets for src family tyrosine kinases  were mutated to phenylalanine. cos <dig> cells were transfected with p73α or y28f-p73α, y121f-p73α, y309f-p73α, y355-356f-p73α in the presence of hck and whole cell lysates subjected to western blotting with ptyr, p <dig> and hck antibodies. all the mutants except y28f-p73α showed phosphorylation comparable to that seen on wt-p73α . y28f-p73α was compromised considerably in phosphorylation by hck . this was not due to lower level of expression because p <dig> and hck were comparable as determined by reprobing the blot with anti-p <dig> and anti-hck antibody . c-abl is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase which phosphorylates p73α on y <dig> residue and activates it  <cit> . hck induced phosphorylation of y99f-p73α as well as wt-p73α while y28f-p73α was particularly compromised in phosphorylation . c-src co-expression also resulted in p73α phosphorylation predominantly on y <dig> residue whereas expression of kd src did not result in p <dig> phosphorylation . taken together, our results suggest a novel site  of phosphorylation on p73α by src family kinases, which is different from c-abl mediated phosphorylation of p <dig> on y <dig> residue.

hck co-expression stabilizes p73
to determine whether hck affects p <dig> protein levels, hela cells were transfected with p73α alone or with hck and whole cell lysates subjected to immunoblotting with anti p <dig> antibody. co-expression of hck but not kd-hck showed higher p73α protein levels . hck also increased the protein levels of y28f-p73α, which suggested that increase in p73α protein level is not dependent on y <dig> phosphorylation. the same blot was probed for hck and gfp that was used as transfection efficiency control . these results suggest that hck could increase the p <dig> protein levels in a kinase dependent manner. to examine whether p <dig> increase seen upon co-expression with hck is due to effect on its stability, levels of p <dig> protein were determined in the presence of cycloheximide. p <dig> levels dropped significantly by  <dig> hours of cycloheximide treatment but did not change significantly when co-expressed with hck  suggesting that hck increases p <dig> protein stability.

sub-cellular localization of hck and p73
since hck is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase known to localize to plasma membranes, golgi and in the cytoplasm  <cit>  and p <dig> shows nucleo-cytoplasmic exchange, we investigated sub-cellular distribution of p73α upon co-expression with hck by biochemical fractionation of transfected cos <dig> cells. phosphorylated p73α was present predominantly in cytosolic fraction upon hck over expression . when co-expressed with hck, there was  <dig> -fold increase in cytosolic p <dig> as compared to the cytosolic fraction of p73α transfected alone  suggesting that p <dig> is stabilized in the cytosolic fraction. surprisingly, we observed that a fraction of hck localized to the nucleus. cross-contamination of the fractions was ruled out by probing for tubulin and parp.

unlike other src family kinases such as src, lyn and fyn  <cit> , no evidence is available for nuclear localization of hck. it was therefore important to evaluate that presence of hck in the nucleus is not a feature of exogenously expressed protein. we determined the sub-cellular distribution of endogenous hck in a myeloid cell line hl- <dig>  as shown in fig. 5b, endogenous hck distributed to both nuclear and cytosolic compartments as evidenced by sub-cellular fractionation. to confirm that sub cellular fractions were not contaminated, the fractions were analysed by western blotting for calnexin  and parp . the presence of endogenous hck in the nucleus was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence assay. hl- <dig> cells were differentiated with  <dig> ng/ml of 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate , which allows cells to adhere to the coverslips. after  <dig> hours, cells were fixed and immunostained with hck antibody and analysed by confocal microscopy. the middle section passing through the nucleus was analysed for determination of hck localization. as shown in fig. 5c, endogenous hck localized to the nucleus. the cells were also stained without primary antibody for control.

hck suppresses transactivation of p <dig> targets
since interacting proteins and modifications affect the transactivation ability of p <dig>  we determined if hck co-expression influences p <dig> activity. we first compared the ability of hck and c-abl to regulate p <dig> activity using pg <dig> construct that has multiple binding sites for p <dig>  c-abl enhanced p73β activity but hck co-expression resulted in inhibition of its activity . this effect of hck was also tested using ipaf promoter. ipaf, an activator of caspase- <dig>  was recently identified as a p <dig> target gene induced by dna damage and was shown to play a role in p <dig> mediated apoptosis  <cit> . p73α even at low level  could strongly transactivate expression of a reporter gene cloned downstream of the ipaf promoter . it was found that hck repressed activation of ipaf promoter reporter construct by p73α . coexpression of kinase dead  mutant of hck was also able to repress p73α-mediated transactivation similar to wild type  hck when tested using ipaf reporter construct . overexpression of hck also repressed p73α-induced transactivation of mdm <dig> promoter, which was independent of kinase activity of hck, as co-expression of kd mutant of hck repressed p73α mediated transactivation similar to wt-hck .

functional sh <dig> domain of hck is required for inhibition of p <dig> transcriptional activity
since hck inhibited the transcriptional activity of p73α isoform in a kinase-independent manner, we explored the possibility of the involvement of sh <dig> domain. towards this end, a critical tryptophan was mutated to alanine . this mutation in hck abolished the binding of sh <dig> domain to proline rich sequences of proteins as well as enhanced its kinase activity  <cit> . w93a-hck  was transfected in the presence and absence of p73α along with ipaf-cat reporter construct. msh3-hck was not able to inhibit p73α mediated transcriptional activity of ipaf promoter whereas wt-hck showed inhibition , suggesting that this inhibition is dependent on functional sh <dig> domain of hck. to analyse if this property was unique to hck, the effect of src on ipaf-promoter transactivation was examined. hela cells were transfected with p73α  and c-src or hck  along with ipaf-cat promoter  and cell lysates subjected to reporter activity assay. c-src inhibited p73α mediated transactivation by  <dig> % as compared to hck which inhibited the activity by 60% . these results suggest that hck is a more potent inhibitor of p <dig> induced ipaf-promoter transactivation as compared to c-src indicating the difference in properties between the two members of src family kinases.

the effect of hck on p <dig> induced endogenous gene expression was examined by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptional -pcr analysis in hela cells. hck and msh3-hck were transfected with p73α in a ratio of  <dig> : <dig> and total rna prepared. these conditions were used to ensure that all p <dig> expressing cells also co-express hck. ectopic expression of p73α resulted in an increase in endogenous ipaf mrna levels, and co-expression with wt-hck resulted in inhibition of expression . co-expression of msh3-hck with p73α did not inhibit p73α induced ipaf mrna levels . this was also observed with endogenous mdm <dig> mrna levels where coexpression of wt-hck inhibited mdm <dig> gene expression significantly and msh3-hck coexpression with p73α did not inhibit p73α induced mdm <dig> mrna levels. these results suggested that functional sh <dig> domain of hck is indispensable for repression of p <dig> transcriptional activity. we assessed the ability of hck to regulate expression of puma, a well-known target of p <dig>  rt-pcr analysis showed that p73α expression upregulates expression of puma in hela cells. upon co-expression of hck with p73α, puma expression was not altered under the conditions where ipaf gene expression was repressed . this result shows that hck may regulate endogenous p <dig> targets selectively.

inhibition of p73α induced apoptosis by hck
p73α expression induces apoptosis in osteosarcoma cell line saos <dig> that is p53-/-  <cit> . we wished to determine whether repressive effect of hck on p <dig> activity is reflected also in its ability to suppress apoptosis. we examined the effect of hck expression on p73α-induced apoptosis in saos <dig> cell line. p73α was overexpressed with and without hck and cells were scored for apoptosis after immunostaining for p <dig> and hck expression. p73α alone induced apoptosis in 33% of expressing cells but co-expression with hck resulted in apoptosis of only 15% of expressing cells . a functional sh <dig> domain in hck was required for inhibiting p73-induced apoptosis since the w93a-hck construct did not show any inhibitory effect. this property was independent of hck kinase activity as seen by the ability of kd hck to inhibit p73-induced apoptosis . the morphology of single and dual expressing cells is shown in fig. 7b. further, to assess downstream events of apoptosis, cleaved caspase- <dig> levels were determined by immunostaining. a large number of p73α expressing cells showed increased staining of cleaved caspase- <dig>  which is a hallmark for apoptosis . co-expression of hck along with p73α showed significant reduction in number of cells expressing cleaved caspase- <dig>  whereas msh3-hck coexpression did not affect the number of cells with cleaved caspase- <dig> in saos <dig> cells .

the effect of hck on p <dig> induced ipaf gene expression in saos- <dig> cells was examined. when hck was co-expressed with p73α, ipaf expression was reduced significantly . this repression was independent of kinase activity of hck but dependent on functional sh <dig> domain of hck . we determined the effect of y28f-p73α mutation on its ability to transactivate gene expression. expression of p73α or y28f-p73α mutant in saos <dig> cells resulted in an increased expression of ipaf gene as determined by rt-pcr . co-expression of hck suppressed p73α-induced as well as y28f mutant-induced expression of ipaf mrna . to determine whether some other target of p <dig> is affected by y28f mutation, we analysed the induction of 14-3-3σ mrna   <cit>  by p73α as well as by y28f mutant . induction of 14-3-3σ mrna was seen upon expression of p73α as well as y28f mutant. interestingly, there was no suppression of p73α or y28fp73α mutant induced 14-3-3σ mrna by hck . these results suggest that the suppressive effect of hck on p73-induced gene expression is promoter specific as was also observed in hela cells.

since hck inhibited p <dig> induced promoter activation as well as gene expression, this study was also extended to check the ability of hck to inhibit apoptosis induced by cisplatin, an anti cancer drug known to mediate apoptosis by activation of p <dig>  <cit> . saos <dig> cells were transfected with gfp, wt-hck or msh3-hck and immunostained for expressing cells after cisplatin treatment. quantitation of apoptosis in expressing and nonexpressing cells showed that hck expression protected 47% of cells from cisplatin induced apoptosis . neither gfp expression nor mutant sh <dig> hck expression inhibited this apoptosis. the protein levels of p73α, hck and msh3-hck were also determined upon cisplatin treatment which is shown in fig. 8b. the morphology of hck expressing cells is shown in fig. 8c.

yap interacts with hck and is required for p73-induced activation of ipaf promoter
in an attempt to elucidate the mechanism by which hck inhibits p <dig> activity in a target specific manner, we tested the possible involvement of yap, a molecule that binds to and selectively regulates p <dig> dependent transactivation  <cit> . yap was first identified as the src family kinase yes, interacting protein  <cit> . we explored the possibility of yap interacting with hck in vivo in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. yap was detected in hck immunoprecipitates from cells expressing both hck and yap and not with control antibody . the ability of hck to interact with yap was tested in vitro using gst fusion proteins. yap interacted with gst-sh3-hck domain and not with gst-msh3-hck domain .

the role of yap in p73α mediated ipaf promoter transactivation was determined by knock down of yap using rnai strategy. yap shrna i, ii, iii and control shrna i and ii were transfected with gfp-yap in hela cells in the ratio of 4: <dig> and whole cell lyastes subjected to immunoblotting with gfp antibody. yap shrna i, ii and iii inhibited the expression of gfp-yap by 90%, 85% and 71%, respectively, as compared to control shrna i . as can be seen in fig. 9c, , transfection efficiency was comparable as determined by gfp blot which was used as an efficiency control. to check the role of endogenous yap in p73α-induced ipaf promoter transactivation, yap shrna i, ii and control shrna i were transfected with and without p73α along with ipaf-cat promoter construct and cat assays performed after  <dig> hours of transfection. yap shrna i and ii significantly inhibited p73α mediated ipaf-promoter transactivation  . these results suggest that endogenous yap is required for p73α-induced activation of ipaf promoter.

discussion
the present study identifies p <dig> as a substrate and interacting partner of the src family kinase, hck. in vitro studies using a gst fusion protein suggest that p73α could interact directly with sh <dig> domain of hck. hck represses the transcriptional activity of p73α. this repression was observed under conditions where c-abl co-expression showed enhanced transactivation by p <dig> indicating that c-abl and hck have opposing influence on the function of p <dig> as a transcriptional activator. this repression was independent of the catalytic activity of hck but required its sh <dig> domain. the effect of hck on p <dig> activity was also observed at the level of endogenous ipaf and mdm <dig> gene expression but did not influence two other known targets of p <dig>  puma and 14-3-3σ. the selective regulation of p <dig> targets by hck suggests a distinct role for hck in vivo with respect to modulation of expression of certain genes. apoptosis induced by exogenously expressed, as well as endogenous p <dig>  was inhibited by hck, dependent on its sh <dig> domain protein interaction function. this property of hck may therefore be a consequence of its ability to repress target gene induction by p <dig> 

hck mediated inhibition of p <dig> activity may be effected by direct interaction between these two proteins in vivo, or by the involvement of a hck interacting protein that is required for p <dig> dependent transcriptional activation. endogenous as well as exogenously expressed hck has earlier been shown to localize to plasma membrane, golgi, secretory granules, nongranular membranes and cytosol  <cit> . most intracellular functions of src family kinases have been attributed to their localization to the plasma membranes and cytosolic compartments. more recently tyrosine kinases involved in receptor mediated signaling pathways have been shown to be present in the nucleus and their role in influencing activity of transcription factors has been described  <cit> . our results suggest that both exogenously expressed as well as endogenous hck is present to some extent in nuclear compartment of cells. these observations raise the possibility that the inhibition of p <dig> transcriptional activity by hck is mediated at least in part by the fraction of hck present in the nucleus. cytoplasmic sequestration of p <dig> by hck is not likely to explain inhibition of p <dig> activity by hck because the level of p <dig> in the nucleus  does not decrease upon co-expression of hck. hck interaction with p <dig> directly could alter its ability to bind or transactivate a set of targets selectively.

our results also show that hck interacts with yap, a transcriptional co-activator, which imparts target selectivity to p <dig>  since yap was required for maximal activation of ipaf promoter by p <dig>  it is possible that hck mediates repression of p <dig> transcriptional activity through its ability to interact with yap. based on the ability of p73δ to interact with hck and not with yap  <cit> , we can infer that hck and yap bind to different sequences on p <dig>  formation of multimolecular complex, whereby both hck and yap interact with p <dig>  could be responsible for hck causing selective repression of p <dig> target genes. since hck can bind to yap or to p <dig> through its single sh <dig> domain, an alternate possibility is that its interaction with yap may alter the ability of yap to transactivate p <dig> targets.

phosphorylation of p <dig> by c-abl at y <dig> results in its activation  <cit> . our study shows that hck predominantly targets a tyrosine in the transactivation domain . this difference in target site beween hck and c-abl rules out the possibility of hck expression resulting in p <dig> phosphorylation through activation of c-abl, although hck is known to activate c-abl  <cit> . this modification  did not influence the activity of p <dig> because y28f mutant showed the same level of activation of ipaf promoter as wt p <dig>  hck inhibited ipaf gene expression induced by p73α as well as y28f mutant. we also demonstrated that this modification is not a unique property of hck, since c-src expression also resulted in predominant phosphorylation of p <dig> at y <dig>  in addition, hck also targets other tyrosine residues  because y <dig> mutant was not totally deficient in phosphorylation.

p <dig> stabilization has generally been shown to reflect in an increase in its activity  <cit> . our study showed that over- expression of hck results in stabilization of p <dig> protein, dependent on its kinase activity, but this does not lead to an increase in p <dig> activity. similarly, it has been reported earlier that interaction of p <dig> with mdm <dig> results in p <dig> stabilization but inhibition of p <dig> transcriptional activity  <cit> . our results also show that activation of endogenous hck results in tyrosine phosphorylation of p <dig>  p <dig> protein levels increase upon differentiation of mylemonocytic cells . under these conditions of differentiation, hck levels and activity are also known to increase. hck activity mediated signaling may therefore contribute to enhanced protein levels of endogenous p <dig> upon differentiation. upon cell fractionation, we observed that hck co-expression enhanced p <dig> protein levels only in the cytosolic fraction, but not in the nuclear fraction. phosphorylated p <dig> was essentially seen in the cytosolic fraction. p <dig> localized to nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments may have independent cellular functions just as does p <dig>  <cit> . since phosphorylation at y <dig> by hck does not appear to play a significant role in its stability, it is likely that other mechanisms contribute to p <dig> stabilization dependent on the kinase activity of hck. recently, fyn, a src family kinase was shown to negatively regulate itch by tyrosine phosphorylation, impairing its ubiquitinating activity  <cit> . since itch regulates cellular p <dig> levels by causing its degradation  <cit> , it is also possible that sfks may indirectly regulate p <dig> by preventing its degradation. we have yet to determine the role of p <dig> stabilized by the kinase activity of hck in the cytoplasmic compartment.

sfks modulate diverse signaling cascades dependent on their ability to interact with and phosphorylate various target proteins. in some contexts kinase and adaptor functions can act independently to effect downstream signaling. it therefore, appears that stabilization, which is catalytic activity dependent and suppression of apoptosis, which is sh <dig> domain interaction dependent, are independent effects of hck on p <dig>  the functional significance of y <dig> phosphorylation of p <dig> is not clear at present and would require further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our results show that the tyrosine kinase hck interacts with p73α physically and functionally. hck and c-src phosphorylate p73α at tyr- <dig>  a novel site of phosphorylation located in the transcriptional activation domain. transcriptional activity of p <dig> towards certain target genes is selectively inhibited by hck independent of its kinase activity. hck-sh <dig> domain mediated interactions play an important role in the inhibition of p73-dependent transcriptional activation of target genes as well as apoptosis.
