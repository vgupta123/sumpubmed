BACKGROUND
electrophoretic mobility shift assay , developed by fried and crothers  <cit> , and garner and revzin  <cit> , is a popular method used for detection of protein-dna interactions  <cit> . it is highly sensitive and may be used to obtain qualitative as well as quantitative information in determination of protein binding parameters of various dna molecules  <cit> . in traditional emsa, a dna oligonucleotide or a restriction fragment, generally within the size range of 20– <dig> bp  <cit> , is radiolabeled and complexed with purified protein or mixture of proteins . this complex is separated from the naked dna by using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  under native conditions. because of the "caging" effect within the gel matrix  <cit> , the dna-protein interactions can be stabilized and the corresponding shifted complexes can be detected as discrete bands. although in some cases, complexes may dissociate and do not produce detectable shifted bands.

previously, two similar high-throughput methods were developed for the identification of protein binding regions using a large population of fragments derived from dnas  ranging in size from  <dig> kb to  <dig>  kb  <cit> . these methods are relatively laborious because, in addition to the initial two-dimensional page separation step, they require several additional steps  for fragment identification.

here we describe an alternative and straightforward strategy which is based on a principle of the selection method, known as selex  <cit>  and uses a combination of native  and denaturing page for the identifications of protein binding regions in long  fragments of genomic dna. with this strategy, unique protein binding fragments, which give rise to shifted bands, can be "fished out" and identified. moreover, dna fragments which dissociate from the complexes during electrophoresis may be also identifed.

methods
cells and nuclear extract preparation
rat pheochromocytoma pc- <dig> cells   <cit>  were grown in a humidified 5% co <dig> incubator at 37°c in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium  supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum and  <dig> u/ml of penicillin and streptomycin. all cell culture reagents were purchased from gibco, invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, usa. for nuclear extract preparation, pc- <dig> cells were washed with  <dig> × pbs  and lysed in ice-cold buffer containing  <dig> mm tris-hcl ,  <dig> mm nacl,  <dig> mm edta,  <dig> mm dtt, 10% glycerol  <dig> % np- <dig> supplemented with  <dig> mm pmsf and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail  . nuclei were pelleted by low speed centrifugation at  <dig> rcf for  <dig> min and proteins were extracted with the high salt buffer as described in  <cit> .

digestion of genomic dna and size selection of fragments
a  <dig>  kb bamhi fragment of rat genomic dna derived from the 5' region of neurotrophin receptor  gene was cloned into bluescript ks vector  and digested with restriction enzyme bsuri or alui . the fragments obtained were separated on a 1% low gelling temperature agarose  together with the dna molecular weight marker  run in parallel lane. two fractions, with approximate sizes of fragments 30– <dig> bp and 300– <dig> bp, named low  and  molecular weight fractions, respectively, were cut out and allowed to diffuse into te  at 37°c for 8– <dig> h. these fractions were further concentrated by precipitation with ethanol  in the presence of  <dig>  m naoac  at room temperature. after centrifugation, the dna pellets were dissolved in te at concentration of  <dig> ng/μl.

labeling of dna fragments
fragments  were 3' end-labeled with  <dig> μci of dctp  using  <dig> unit of klenow polymerase  in a  <dig> μl reaction volume containing  <dig> mm tris-hcl ,  <dig> mm mgcl <dig> and  <dig> mm dtt. to favor 3'end-labeling of blunt-ended fragments by 3'-5' exonuclease and 5'-3' polymerase activities of klenow fragment, the reaction was first incubated in the presence of dctp at 37°c for  <dig> min. then all unlabelled dntps were added to a final concentration of  <dig>  mm for each and the reaction was continued for  <dig> min. finally, the reaction was terminated by phenol extraction, 32p-labeled fragments were precipitated with  <dig>  volumes of ethanol in the presence of  <dig>  m nh4oac and dissolved in te at a concentration of  <dig> ng/μl.

emsa
32p-labeled fractions of fragments  were incubated with pc- <dig> nuclear extract  in  <dig> mm hepes-koh at ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm kcl,  <dig>  mm edta,  <dig>  mm dtt,  <dig> % glycerol, poly   at room temperature for  <dig> min. after addition of 20% glycerol , samples were subjected to electrophoresis on a 3% polyacrylamide gels run with  <dig> mm tris-borate buffer, ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm edta at room temperature for  <dig> h. the following electrophoresis reagents were used tris , boric acid , acrylamide , n,n'-methylene bisacrylamide  and edta  from sigma, st. louis, mo, usa

labeled fragments and their shifted complexes with proteins were visualized in wet  or dried gels by phosphoimaging using personal molecular imager fx system . shifted bands or zones were located, cut out from the preparative gels and the corresponding labeled fragments were allowed to diffuse into te as described above. fragments were concentrated by ethanol precipitation, dissolved in sample buffer containing 90% formamide and  <dig> mm edta and treated at 95°c for  <dig> min.

denaturing page
emsa-positive shifted fragments, together with 32p-labeled l and h molecular weight fractions of fragments and appropriate dna marker were subjected to electrophoresis on a  <dig> cm-long 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing  <dig> mm tris-borate buffer, ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm edta and  <dig> m urea. after electrophoresis, gel was transferred to the whatman  <dig> mm paper, dried and radioactive fragments were visulized by phosphoimaging.

sequence analysis and fragment identification
sequence of the  <dig>  kb bamh <dig> fragment derived from the rat p75ntr 5' region was obtained from the genbank®   <cit> . restriction mapping with bsuri and alui, and identification of shifted fragments corresponding to protein-dna complexes were carried out using dnaman software package  version  <dig>  .

RESULTS
a strategy for the detection of protein binding regions in genomic dna
based on a traditional emsa and selection of dna fragments containing protein binding regions from the population of restriction fragments , we have developed a strategy for the detection of protein binding regions in long  fragments of genomic dna . this strategy consists of the following steps: fragmentation of genomic dna with a frequent-cutter restriction enzyme recognizing a  <dig> bp sequence, isolation of the l and h molecular weight fractions of fragments, 32p-labeling with klenow fragment, emsa, elution of the shifted fragments and their identification by denaturing page . the main difference from the traditional emsa is that instead of using a single labeled oligonucleotide or restriction fragment, a large number of fragments  are used in a single experiment. however, because smaller fragments may give rise to complexes which may be masked by longer fragments, a prior separation of l and h molecular weight fractions of fragments is necessary. after localization and elution of the shifted bands  from the preparative emsa-gel, identification of the corresponding protein-bound fragments is carried out by high resolution page. generally, each shifted dna fragment can be identified when running it in gel in parallel with the initial pool of labeled fragments of known size . however, if two fragments of the same size are present among the shifted fragments, their identity may be revealed by the presence or absence of a diagnostic restriction enzyme site, determined from a separate experiment.

determination of the protein binding regions in the 5' region of rat neurotrophin receptor  gene
to test the strategy, based on a combination of native and denaturing page, we used a  <dig> bp fragment corresponding to the nucleotide positions - <dig>  to - <dig> of the upstream  region of the rat p75ntr gene . fig. 3a shows the preparation of l and h molecular fragment fractions . as determined by in silico restriction analysis, bsuri generated  <dig> fragments in l and  <dig> in h molecular range. similarly, alui generated  <dig> and  <dig> fragments in l and h molecular fractions, respectively . representative fractions  were selected for further analysis. fig.  <dig> shows the results obtained by using these fractions in emsa and denaturing page experiments. in the case of bsuri l fraction, a band with reduced mobilty was identifed as a  <dig> bp fragment derived from a region - <dig> to - <dig> bp relative to the transcriptional start site  of the p75ntr gene . however, in the case of alui h fraction, a smear was observed in emsa gel . a zone covering most of this smear was cut out and analyzed on a denaturing gel . this zone contained fragments from  <dig> to  <dig> bp in length . comparison of the band intensities between lanes + and -, corresponding to the incubations with and without nuclear proteins, revealed enrichment of two fragments  <dig> and  <dig> bp  suggesting that these fragments contain binding sites for nuclear proteins.

therefore, this result shows that dna fragments which dissociate from the complexes during electrophoresis and produce a smear can be identified by denaturing page.

it is important to note that fragments with sizes greater than  <dig> bp tend to have nonspecific interactions with proteins and thus may be shifted more frequently than smaller fragments . despite this fact, enrichment of certain fragments in the shifted zone clearly suggests that these may contain regions involved in sequence specific dna-protein interactions. consistent with this conclusion, the  <dig> bp alui fragment overlapped with the emsa-positive  bsuri  <dig> bp fragment detected earlier . to confirm that the fragments identified here contain binding sites for nuclear proteins, an emsa was carried out using individual fragments that overlapped with the identified ones . this experiment showed that all three fragments produced specific shifted products.

practical considerations
previously, two highly similar methods have been developed for the detection of protein binding sites in different dnas derived from plasmid, bacteriophages , e. coli chromosome or human genome  <cit> . these methods are based on two-dimensional page and allow simultaneous analysis of a large collection of fragments . however, some dna-protein interactions may remain undetected because of low affinity or the low concentration of an individual fragment in a large population of fragments  <cit> .

the strategy developed in this study may be suitable for the initial analysis of genomic  regions extending up to  <dig> kb in length, revealing protein binding regions that can be further analysed using dnase footprinting  <cit>  and promoter activity tests. it is important to note that nonspecific interactions can frequently occur between proteins and longer  dna fragments used in emsa. nonspecific binding may be reduced if higher concentrations of competitor poly  are used . therefore, for fragments > <dig> bp, higher concentrations  of competitor must be used. it is recommended that the sufficient concentration of competitor is determined experimentally for each fraction of fragments or individual fragment and nuclear extract.

one of the limitations of traditional emsa is that some complexes do not withstand the conditions and may produce a smear during electrophoresis. however, as shown here, if the area of the smear is cut out from the gel and the fragments are analyzed, it is possible to identify the fragments undergoing dissociation from the "fragile" complexes . alternatively, if the emsa gel is run at low temperature  or at low voltage, it may be possible to stabilize protein dna interactions and increase the chance of getting shifted fragile complexes  <cit> .

the strategy described here has several advantages over traditional emsa. it can be performed with a mixture of fragments, thus increasing the length of the dna fragment that can be analysed in a single experiment. it is based on a simple identification of fragments on a denaturing gel and may be used for the detection of labile interactions . in principle, the method described by chernov et al  <cit>  may be also applied to smaller fragments  with an additional improvement, i.e without the need of ligation and pcr. however, it is uncertain whether dna fragments dissociating from the complexes during electrophoresis can be detected with their method.

nevertheless, our strategy has also some limitations. firstly, the 3'-end labeling with 3'-5' exonuclease and polymerase activities of klenow fragment, is relatively inefficient and produces labeled fragments with different specific activities  <cit> . also, fragments with g-c-rich structures at their termini are somewhat resistant to 3'-5-exonuclease of klenow fragment and thus are difficult to label in some cases. secondly, some protein binding sites may be digested with the selected restriction enzymes. thirdly, gel-elution of fragments based on diffusion alone is time consuming. these limitations, however, can be overcome by end-labeling fragments with bacteriophage t <dig> dna polymerase, using restriction enzymes with different recognition specificities  and applying quick gel-elution methods  <cit> . it is worth to mention that our previous experience with two commercial gel extraction kits  has shown that certain purified restriction fragments do not produce mobility shifts if isolated at high temperature , i. e. using a step necessary for dissolving the gel slice . this is apparently because of the changes in fragment conformation/kinking introduced at high temperature . therefore, the diffusion of fragments may be preferred at least for some dna fragments.

in summary, the strategy developed here may be easily applied to any genomic fragment with known sequence for which protein binding regions are searched. finally, selection of restriction enzymes with different recognition sequences may be used to expand the fragment coverage and to narrow down the location of protein binding sites.

CONCLUSIONS
we have described a strategy for the detection of protein binding regions in long fragments of genomic dna. contrary to the previously described high throughput detection methods  <cit> , which can be used to detect high affinity protein binding from the large population of dna fragments, our strategy uses intermediate  number of fragments and detects low as well as high affinity binding regions. moreover, as shown here, dna fragments undergoing dissociation from the dna-protein complexes during electrophoresis can be identified by this strategy. our results also stress the importance of testing different poly  concentrations to reduce nonspecific interactions between longer restriction fragments and proteins. we believe that the strategy described here is suitable for the initial analysis of genomic regions  and can be complemented by dnase footprinting and promoter activity tests in the later stages of study.
