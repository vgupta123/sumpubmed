BACKGROUND
sugarcane smut is a devastating disease in sugarcane growing areas globally. the characteristic symptom of the disease is a black or gray growth that is referred to as a “smut whip”  <cit> . sugarcane smut is caused by the fungus s. scitamineum, a bipolar species  <cit>  with two mating type strains mat- <dig> and mat- <dig>  <cit>  producing haploid sporidia by budding. the compatible sporidia fuse to develop pathogenic dikaryotic hyphae, which grow within the stalk of sugarcane and form diploid teliospores to complete the pathogenic life cycle  <cit> . the teliospores are disseminated by wind or rain splashes and germinate to form four sporidia, and initiate next round of life cycle by mating. the sexual mating process of s. scitamineum is similar to the maize pathogen ustilago maydis, which is regulated by two unlinked mating type loci, a locus and b locus . the bi-allelic a loci that encode a pheromone/pheromone receptor system that is responsible for recognition of the opposite haploid sporidia and formation of conjugation tubes  <cit> . the b locus composed of the be and bw genes, encoding a heterodimeric transcription factor to maintain the dikaryotic filament and promote subsequent penetration of the host plant, after fusion of the sporidia .

it has been reported that in u. maydis, the be/bw transcription factor acts through a regulatory cascade to affect various pathways in triggering pathogenic development, including cell cycle regulation, mitosis and dna replication  <cit> . however, the physiology of s. scitamineum mating is largely unknown, due to unavailability of genome sequence and effective method of genetic manipulation, previously. recently, with the genome sequencing performed by que et al.  <cit>  and taniguti et al.  <cit> , and optimizing of the atmt transformation procedure for s. scitamineum  <cit> , investigation on s. scitamineum differentiation and pathogenesis on molecular level becomes feasible. recently, we identified and characterized a b-locus homolog in s. scitamineum, and found that it is essential for sexual mating and filamentous growth  <cit> , but the underlying mechanism remained unclear. given that b-locus encodes a homeodomain transcription complex, comparative transcriptome analysis may provide useful clues to possible b-locus target gene and functional study of such candidate gene may reveal the molecular basis of b-locus regulating s. scitamineum sexual mating and/or filamentous growth. therefore, we carried out transcriptome analysis with wild-type mat- <dig> and ssΔmat-1b mutant, and with mating and non-mating mixtures of s. scitamineum haploids. our study identified several potential target genes of b-locus encoding transcriptional factor, that are likely involved in s. scitamineum sexual mating and/or filamentous growth, and further reveals two critical endogenous/environmental cues: nutrient and redox homeostasis, for mating and/or filementous growth in s. scitamineum.

methods
growth conditions and strains used in this study
teliospores of sugarcane smut were collected from the fields in guangdong province of china , and no specific permissions were required for sampling diseased plants in this location. haploid colonies of mat- <dig> and mat- <dig> were isolated from these teliospores by serial dilution and plating on yepsa medium, as previously described  <cit> . synthetic complete dextrose  medium is consisted of  <dig>  %  yeast nitrogen base without amino acids,  <dig>  % complete amino acids powder, and 2 %  glucose  <cit> . synthetic complete  medium was formulated as scd medium without addition of glucose  <cit> .

rna extraction and sequencing strategies
trizol reagent  was used for total rna extraction from haploid mat- <dig> and ssΔmat-1b mutant. mat- <dig> and mat- <dig> haploids were mixed and plated on yepsa medium for 24 h before total rna extraction with trizol reagent. similarly, ssΔmat-1b and mat- <dig> haploids were mixed and inoculated on yepsa medium for 24 h before total rna extraction.

libraries were constructed following illumina manufacturer’s protocol of the “truseq rna sample prep v <dig> low throughput ” kit. paired-end sequencing was performed on the illumina hiseq™ <dig>  reads were analyzed by fastqc  and low quality bases , illumina adapters and poly-a tails were removed using the ngs qc toolkit v <dig> . <dig>   <cit> .

transcriptome assembly and annotations
de novo short read assembly was performed using tophat and cufflinks softwares  <cit> . the assembled reads were mapped to the complete genome of s. scitamineum ssc39b strain  using tophat and bowtie <dig>  <cit> .

unigene generated by de novo short read assembly was aligned to ncbi nr database , swissprot database , and kog database , respectively. unigene encoding proteins with high similarity  to the known proteins in aforementioned databases were used to annotate the corresponding unigene. go annotation was performed by blast2go software  <cit>  and the database http://www.geneontology.org/. kegg annotation was performed with the database http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html  <cit> .

transcriptome analysis
differential transcript accumulation among treatments  was observed using bowtie <dig>   <cit>  and express  <cit> . the gene expression level is calculated by using fpkm method   <cit> . baggerley’s test and the false discovery rate  with a significance level of ≤ <dig>  and the absolute value of log2ratio ≥ <dig> was set as the threshold to judge the significance of gene expression difference.

go enrichment analysis was performed as firstly mapping all degs  to go terms in the database , calculating gene numbers for every term, then using hypergeometric test to find significantly enriched go terms in the input list of degs, based on go::termfinder . p value was calculated using the following formula: p=1−∑i=0m−1min−mn−inn 

where n is the number of all genes with go annotation; n is the number of degs in n; m is the number of all genes that are annotated to certain go terms; m is the number of degs in m. the calculated p-value goes through bonferroni correction  <cit> , taking corrected p-value ≤  <dig>  as a threshold. go score was calculated as follows: enrichmentscore=mnmn.

kegg database is used to perform pathway enrichment analysis of degs. the calculating formula is the same as that in go analysis. here n is the number of all genes that with kegg annotation, n is the number of degs in n, m is the number of all genes annotated to specific pathways, and m is the number of degs in m.

RESULTS
unigenes identification and gene annotation
our rnaseq analysis produced a total length of  <dig>  mb  for all the transcripts, out of 2g clean sequencing data, representing about  <dig> x coverage of the transcriptome. compared to previous published genomic sequence of s. scitamineum  <cit> , the total length of sequence is slightly low, likely due to the fact that only transcripts  were anchored and sequenced in this study. de novo assembly of transcripts was performed as described in methods. we identified  <dig> unigenes in total, with length from 145 bp to 16628 bp . most of the identified unigenes are of 200–2000 bp , and gc content is within the range of 50–60 % . the unigenes were mapped to nr, swissprot, and kog database for annotation, as listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> table  <dig> unigene statistics

transcriptome analysis identified differentially expressed genes between mating and non-mating strains/conditions
in this study, we compared two sets of non-mating vs mating strain/condition, with an aim to identify the genes related to s. scitamineum mating and likely regulated by b-locus. differentially expressed genes  were identified in the ssΔmat-1b mutant compared to the wild-type mat- <dig> strain, as well as in the non-mating mixture, ssΔmat-1b x mat- <dig>  compared to the mating mixture of mat- <dig> x mat- <dig>  degs of significance  in the haploid and mating set were listed in additional file 2: table s <dig> and additional file 3: table s <dig> respectively. in total, there are  <dig> degs identified in the ssΔmat-1b mutant, among which  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated . under mating condition, a total of  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in the non-mating mixture, with  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated . by comparing the up- and down-regulated genes in these two conditions, we found that  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes were common in non-mating haploid and mating mixture. we listed in table  <dig> for those with annotation in swissprot database.table  <dig> degs statistics

among the  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes listed in table  <dig>  we noticed that genes encoding components of signaling pathway, e.g. mapk cek <dig>  and hog <dig> , gtpase-activating protein bem2/ipl <dig> , or histidine kinase  were up-regulated with deletion of b-locus. also, proteins involved vesicular trafficking  or metal-nicotianamine transporter ysl <dig> were possibly repressed by b-locus transcriptional factor . another transcriptional factor, rfx <dig>  and an rna helicase were potentially repressed by b-locus too . this result indicates that b-locus may negatively regulate some signaling pathway and repressed transcription of a set of downstream genes, directly or indirectly, after sexual mating induced and during filamentous growth. on the other hand, genes induced, directly or indirectly, by b-locus include several other transcriptional factors, e.g. athb- <dig>  <cit> , mkl/myocardin-like protein  <cit> , short stature homeobox protein  <dig> . b-locus may also induce regulators involved in biosynthesis, including polyol transporter  <dig>  rhamnolipids biosynthesis 3-oxoacyl- reductase, mfs-type transporter, and several hydrolases or glucoamylase, during mating and/or filamentous growth . pka and mapk signaling pathway were found to be involved in b-locus regulating sexual mating and/or filamentous growth in u. maydis  <cit> . here in our study, we also identified component of mapk pathway, cek <dig> and hog <dig>  that was potentially regulated by s. scitamineum b-locus, but not among those identified in u. maydis. our finding indicates that s. scitamineum b-locus may regulate small molecular  transport, vesicular trafficking, biosynthesis, stress-response mediated by mapk signaling , and a cascade of transcriptional network, during mating and/or filamentous growth. the candidate genes listed in table  <dig> are of great interest in our future investigation, in terms of elucidating physiology and molecular mechanism of s. scitamineum differentiation and pathogenesis.

identification of starch/sucrose metabolism and hog <dig> mapk pathway in fungal mating
as an international standard gene functional classification system, gene ontology , offers a dynamic-updated controlled vocabulary, as well as a strictly defined concept to comprehensively describe properties of genes and their products in any organism  <cit> . therefore go enrichment analysis of the aforementioned degs may further reveal the functional relevance of b-locus regulating genes and s. scitamineum mating. enriched go  in the haploid and mating sets were listed in additional file 4: table s <dig> and additional file 5: table s <dig> respectively, and schematically represented following three ontologies  as in fig.  <dig>  among them, we noticed that the genes involved in membrane transport, oxidation-reduction process and atp-binding were overall differentially regulated in non-mating haploid , as well as in non-mating mixture . however, some particular genes associated with the membrane transport process  were up-regulated, while some others, enriched in the same go term, were down-regulated, in both non-mating haploid and non-mating mixture . similar situation occurred for oxidation-reduction process  as well as atp-binding . on the other hand, atp catabolic process  was up-regulated in both ssΔmat-1b mutant and ssΔmat-1b x mat- <dig> mixture , indicating that s. scitamineum mating may repress atp catabolism. in summary, go terms enrichment analysis further verifies that metabolism, biosynthsis, transmembrane transport and redox homeostasis would be tightly regulated by b-locus during s. scitamineum mating and/or filamentous growth.fig.  <dig> go-enrichment of degs. left panal: ssΔmat-1b mutant vs wild-type mat-1; right panal: ssΔmat-1b x mat- <dig> mixture vs mat- <dig> x mat- <dig>  go terms were catalogued as biological process, cellular component, and molecular function



genes usually interact with each other to play roles in certain biological functions. pathway-based analysis helps to further understand the biological functions of unigenes. kegg-enrichment analysis thus was carried out to identify significantly enriched metabolic pathways or signal transduction pathways in degs comparing with the whole genome background  <cit> . enriched kegg terms were listed in additional file 6: table s <dig> and additional file 7: table s <dig>  for ssΔmat-1b vs wild-type mat- <dig> and the non-mating mixture of ssΔmat-1b x mat- <dig> vs wild-tyype mat- <dig> x mat- <dig>  respectively. among the enriched pathways, we observed that starch and sucrose metabolism pathway  was commonly found in both haploid and mating sets. the predicted outcome of differentially regulation of this pathway was that glucose production would be reduced, while accumulation of  <dig> -β-glucan would be increased , in ssΔmat-1b or non-mating mixture. another commonly up-regulated gene, hog <dig> , was also found in enriched kegg pathway  in both ssΔmat-1b or non-mating mixture . hog <dig> mediates osmo- and oxidative stress response in yeast and fungi , and is important for mating capacity in candida albicans  <cit> . we infer that carbohydrate metabolism as well as redox homeostasis may play important roles in s. scitamineum mating, and be subjective to regulation  by the b-locus.

starch/sucrose metabolism and hog <dig> mapk pathway may regulate s. scitamineum mating
to verify the involvement of starch/sucrose metabolism and hog <dig> mapk pathway in s. scitamineum mating, we tested the growth of the wild-type mat- <dig>  mat- <dig> and ssΔmat-1b mutant, as well as mating mat- <dig> x mat- <dig> mixtures, under osmotic and oxidative stresses. the results showed that ssΔmat-1b was more resistant to oxidative stress, compared to the wild-type mat- <dig> as well as mating mixture . however, wild-type mat- <dig> also showed higher resistance to h2o <dig> when cultured alone but not in mating condition . osmotic stress imposed by 500 mm nacl repressed the filamentous growth in the mating mixture of mat- <dig> x mat- <dig> . however, the colonial growth was indistinguishable between the wild-type mat- <dig> and ssΔmat-1b mutant strain, under the same osmotic stress . on the other hand, the yepsa medium supplemented with high concentration  of glucose repressed filamentous growth in the mating mixture of mat- <dig> x mat- <dig> . in contrast, glucose-depleted medium  was more favorable for filamentous growth in mating mixture of mat- <dig> x mat- <dig>  compared to the scd medium containing 2 % glucose . as  <dig> -β-glucan is an effective anti-oxidant, the significant enhancement of hog <dig> transcripts in non-mating haploid/mixture may be an indirect consequence of elevated intracellular oxidative level in non-mating s. scitamineum haploid and mixture. furthermore, we tested the effect of anti-oxidant, glutathione  on colonial and filamentous growth of haploid and mating strains. all the strains were more resistant to gsh on sc  medium compared to scd  medium . this indicates that the glucose may indeed be utilized for synthesis of anti-oxidant  <dig> -β-glucan, therefore depletion of glucose resulted in more resistance to gsh, another anti-oxidant. overall, these results indicate that glucose may play a negative role in promoting s. scitamineum mating and/or filamentous growth, and the b-locus encoding heterodimeric transcriptional factor may regulate starch/sucrose metabolism on transcriptional level. we further predicted, based on transcriptome analysis, that the b-locus encoded heterodimeric transcriptional factor may regulate s. scitamineum mating and/or filamentous growth by promoting synthesis of  <dig> -β-glucan  and meanwhile repressed the stress response signaling pathway mediated by hog <dig> mapk. a working model, adopted and modified from b-locus regulatory network proposed in u. maydis  <cit> , is depicted in fig.  <dig> .fig.  <dig> starch/sucrose metabolism and hog <dig> mapk pathway are likely involved in s. scitamineum mating, and subject to regulation of the b-locus. a serially diluted cells of mat- <dig>  mat- <dig>  mat- <dig> x mat- <dig>  and ssΔmat-1b, were spotted onto yepsa medium supplemented with  <dig>  mm hydrogen peroxide or 500 mm nacl. b cells of mat- <dig>  ssΔmat-1b, mat- <dig> x mat- <dig>  and ssΔmat-1b x mat- <dig>  were spotted onto yepsa medium with or without 10 %  of glucose. c serially diluted cells of mat- <dig>  ssΔmat-1b, mat- <dig> x mat- <dig>  and ssΔmat-1b x mat- <dig>  were spotted onto scd or sc medium, with 1 mm or 5 mm gsh

fig.  <dig> proposed model. be and bw proteins derived from opposite mating type form functional transcriptional complex to activate or repress class  <dig>  target genes. class  <dig>  indirect targets, are in turn activated or repressed by products encoded by class  <dig> targets. starch/sucrose metabolism genes as well as hog <dig> may be indirectly repressed by the be/bw transcriptional complex, during mating. b-repressed glucose metabolism gene may promote production of glucose, which may repress mating and/or filamentous growth. meanwhile, glucose production may lead to elevated intracellular oxidative level, and thus induce hog <dig> mapk pathway, which also negatively regulates mating and/or filamentous growth. overall, b-locus may act in shutting down mating/filamentous growth inhibitors, including high level of glucose and hog <dig> mapk signaling



discussion
investigation on molecular mechanism on s. scitamineum mating and/pathogenicity was impeded due to lack of s. scitamineum genome sequence, until  <dig>  when que et al., published the first genome sequence of the pathogen  <cit> . more recently, a brazil group published a complete genome assembly of s. scitamineum, as well as the fungal transcriptome profiles revealing the candidate genes unique to interaction with sugarcane  <cit> . such genomic and transcriptome analyses have provided enormous convenience for functional study of mating and pathogenic genes in s. scitamineum. in current study, we conducted transcriptome analysis and comparison between mating vs non-mating haploid/mixture, which present useful information on the b-regulated gene expression cascade during s. scitamineum mating and/or filamentous growth. our transcriptome analysis predicted  <dig> unigenes , which is similar to the predicted genome sizes of the three published s. scitamineum strains . the gc-content of our identified unigenes is ranged from  <dig> to 60 %, peaking at 55 % , which is also consistent with the gc-content of these three genome projects . these data suggest that our de novo assembly of transcripts in s. scitamineum is valid for the identification of degs as well as go and kegg enrichment.

our transcriptome analyses identified  <dig> degs in ssΔmat-1b mutant compared to the wild-type mat- <dig>  and  <dig> degs in non-mating  mixture compared to mating  mixture. among them,  <dig> annotated genes  were common in these two sets of comparisons, thus are most likely associated with mating/filamentous growth and subject to regulation by be/bw heterodimeric transcription factor.

in the enriched kegg pathway, we noticed that sucrose/starch metabolism pathway was altered in the ssΔmat-1b mutant in a way that intracellular glucose is predicted to be reduced and  <dig>  β-glucan elevated. also, glucoamylase encoded gene was identified as potentially b-locus induced . our results  showed in contrast to our prediction, that elevated glucose level repressed, but not promoted, filamentous growth and/or mating. we infer that the timing  for detecting glucoamylase transcription might not be suitable, when at this time point the transcripts started translating into proteins. therefore, the apparent low level of glucoamylase in non-mating sets would reflect active glucose production, and b-locus may actually repress glucoamylase during mating and/or filamentous growth. we further hypothesize that glucose may be channeled to synthesis of  <dig> -β-glucan during s. scitamineum filamentous growth after mating and likely regulated by b-locus, through repression of glucoamylase. as  <dig> -β-glucan is an anti-oxidant, its production may relief the cell from endogenous oxidative stress therefore hog <dig> was not induced in wild-type condition. in b-deletion condition, glucose level may elevated and therefore repress filamentous growth; meanwhile the reduced <dig> -β-glucan level resulted in endogenous oxidative stress and induction of hog <dig> as a response. ssΔmat-1b mutant was slightly more resistant to h2o <dig>  likely due to hyper-induced hog <dig>  our hypothesis was supported by the observation that glucose-depleted medium  promoted filamentous growth in the mating mixture of mat- <dig> x mat- <dig> spores . it has been reported that glucose plays an important role in asexual/sexual sporulation in other pathogenic/filamentous fungi, including magnaporthe oryzae  <cit> , u. maydis  <cit> , and fusarium graminearum  <cit> . also, glucose was reported to suppress mating competency in candida albicans  <cit> . our results fit well with the established notion that glucose promotes unicellular spore/cell production while represses filamentous growth, thus acting as a switch between dimorphic transition.

another interesting observation from common degs and kegg enrichment is that the stress-activating mapk signaling pathway mediated by hog <dig> was significantly up-regulated, in both ssΔmat-1b mutant and ssΔmat-1b x mat- <dig> mixture. one possibility is that, elevated glucose production in ssΔmat-1b haploid resulted in reduced production of  <dig>  3-β-glucan, which is also known as an anti-oxidant. as a result, hog <dig> was transcriptionally induced in response to elevated intracellular oxidative level. alternatively, hog <dig> may be repressed by the be/bw transcriptional complex, directly or indirectly, during mating. our tests showed that ssΔmat-1b is less sensitive to oxidative stress. meanwhile, repression on colonial growth caused by anti-oxidant gsh was more prominent with presence of glucose. overall, these results suggest that hog <dig> mapk signaling may be repressed by the be/bw transcriptional complex. such observation is consistent with the reported function of the hog <dig> ortholog in candida albicans that negatively regulates its mating capacity  <cit> . however, we are not aware of whether sshog <dig> is one of the direct targets  genes of the be/bw transcriptional complex, or among the indirect  targets, as no obvious b-locus binding site  was predicted in the promoter region of sshog <dig> 

it has been reported in u. maydis that go categories “cell cycle”, “chromosome” and “dna metabolic process” were significantly enriched as b-down-regulated genes  <cit> . however, we observed that “dna replication” was enriched as up-regulated go terms in non-mating mixture , and mitosis regulator cek <dig>  <cit>  and gap bem <dig> that related to mitosis  <cit>  were up-regulated in non-mating sets, which may also account for the failure of mating, with deletion of b-locus in mat- <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
overall, our transcriptome analysis contributes to prediction of candidate genes of the regulatory cascade of s. scitamineum b-locus, in terms of mating and/or filamentous growth after recognition of opposite sex mediated by the a-locus. in future, further investigation on such candidate genes would help elucidate molecular mechanism of s. scitamineum mating, including but not limited to, b-locus regulating cell fate decision, morphogenesis, carbon/nitrogen metabolism, mitosis, stress  response, etc. this would certainly enrich our knowledge in fungal sexual differentiation and/or pathogenesis, and likely of great potential towards development/design of anti-fungal pathogen strategy.
