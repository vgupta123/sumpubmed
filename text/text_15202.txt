BACKGROUND
the chicken egg is formed in the hen's left ovary and oviduct. the ovary supports the accumulation of egg yolk proteins and maturation of the ovum . after ovulation, the yolk enters the oviduct, where albumen, eggshell membranes and the eggshell are sequentially deposited in the different segments of the hen's reproductive tract  . the hen manufactures a cleidoic egg  <cit> , which is a completely self-sufficient and aseptic biological package for the extra-uterine development of the avian embryo. this adaptation implies that the egg must contain all components required for the complete extra-uterine development of a fertilized ovum into a viable chick in  <dig> days. to ensure this dynamic challenge, the egg must possess a broad range of biological activities and natural defenses  <cit> . the avian egg contains vitamins, minerals and proteins , yolk lipids and calcium salts  necessary for the development of the embryo. furthermore, the chicken and egg have been an important basic food for humans worldwide for millennia. the egg has a high nutritive value from a well-balanced source of amino acids that are easily assimilated  <cit> . when faced with physical and/or microbial aggression, the egg has two major defensive mechanisms--a chemical protection system composed of yolk, albumen and eggshell matrix proteins that provide antimicrobial protection  <cit> , and the intact eggshell that acts as a physical barrier to protect against bacterial invasion  <cit> .

the eggshell itself is a complex bioceramic material formed in the uterus  segment of the chicken's oviduct. it consists of inner and outer eggshell membranes, an intermediate calcified zone composed of mammillary and palisade layers, and an outer cuticle layer . organic components and ions required for eggshell mineralization are secreted by the uterus into the acellular milieu of uterine fluid, which bathes the egg during its  <dig> hour travel through the hen's oviduct. the eggshell is composed of calcium carbonate  deposited onto the eggshell membranes that are pervaded with organic matrix, which itself is a complex mixture of proteins, glycoproteins and proteoglycans  <cit> . the organic matrix plays a major role in assembly of the bioceramic layer and in determination of its mechanical properties. therefore, identification of the protein complement of the uterus is the first step toward a more complete understanding of the diverse biological functions of the avian eggshell.

matrix proteins are traditionally studied using a variety of biochemical and molecular techniques. these classical approaches have allowed identification of ten proteins  that belong to three functional groups. firstly, three egg white proteins, ovalbumin  <cit> , lysozyme  <cit>  and ovotransferrin  <cit>  are found in the eggshell. secondly, eggshell contain ubiquitous proteins including osteopontin, a phosphorylated glycoprotein present in bone and other hard tissues  <cit> , and clusterin, a secretory glycoprotein that is also found in the egg white  <cit> . thirdly, several matrix proteins are unique to shell calcification and only secreted in regions of the oviduct where eggshell calcification occurs. ovocleidin- <dig>  was the first eggshell protein purified from the shell  <cit> . this secretory protein  is a c-type, lectin-like phosphoprotein  <cit>  that occurs in glycosylated  and nonglycosylated  forms in the shell matrix  <cit> . ovocleidin- <dig>  was the first eggshell matrix protein to be cloned  <cit> . oc- <dig> forms the protein core of a 120- <dig> kda dermatan sulfate proteoglycan called ovoglycan  <cit> , which is found throughout the compact calcified eggshell  <cit> . ovocalyxin- <dig> , a  <dig> kda uterine-specific protein, is concentrated in the outer calcified region and in the cuticle of the calcified shell  <cit> . ovocalyxin- <dig>  is a  <dig> kda protein found only in the shell gland  where eggshell calcification takes place  <cit> . uterine ocx- <dig> message levels are strongly up-regulated during eggshell calcification. ocx- <dig> is predominantly localized in the inner part of the shell and homologous to innate immune response proteins  <cit> . ovocalyxin- <dig>  is another eggshell specific protein that was recently cloned and characterized  <cit> .

although many major proteins in the egg have been identified, we need a more complete and detailed picture of the genes encoding all proteins required for eggshell formation. the availability of the chicken genome sequence  <cit>  and recent development of high-throughput genomic and proteomic assays provide powerful tools for a more complete characterization of egg components  <cit> . a major advance in understanding the complex nature of the eggshell and its assembly in the hen's oviduct came from the work of mann et al.  <cit> , who used a focused proteomics approach to identify  <dig> proteins contained within the eggshell.

the present study provides an original description of the oviduct transcriptome in the laying hen and a repertoire of functional genes that are highly expressed in the uterus during eggshell calcification. our approach provides the first global description of highly expressed uterine genes and their putative secretory proteins that are deposited in the eggshell. these functional components ensure proper eggshell formation, which provides a natural physical barrier and robust antimicrobial protection for the developing chick embryo or the edible egg.

RESULTS
identification of uterine specific genes
we have used our custom del-mar  <dig> k chicken integrated systems microarray  <cit>  to analyze gene expression in different segments of the hen's oviduct during formation of the eggshell. oviducal tissue samples were collected at  <dig> hr post ovulation from the magnum , the white isthmus  and the uterus . a total of  <dig> genes were over-expressed  in the uterus when compared to the magnum . when global gene expression in uterus was compared to that of the white isthmus ,  <dig> genes were over expressed in uterus. we found  <dig> over-expressed uterine transcripts that were unique to the ut/ma contrast and  <dig> over-expressed uterine transcripts that were unique to the ut/wi contrast . a total of  <dig> highly expressed uterine transcripts were common between the two contrasts , which indicates that these uterine genes are highly expressed in the hen's oviduct during calcification of the egg.

the del-mar  <dig> k chicken cdna microarray is composed of  <dig>  cdna inserts, which correspond to  <dig>  unique genes. these cdna were selected to represent an integration of four physiological systems  from our collection of ~ <dig> k est clones  <cit> . our array represents  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singlets from our original assembly of a chicken gene index  <cit> . consequently, there is some redundancy of genes represented on the array, where the  <dig> uterine transcripts corresponded to  <dig> unique cdna sequences . if we raise the significance threshold to greater than  <dig> -fold difference,  <dig> genes were over-expressed in the uterus compared to the magnum, whereas  <dig> transcripts were higher in the uterus than the white isthmus. the number of genes over-expressed still remains high even if we consider a greater than 2-fold change as cut-off, where  <dig> transcripts were over-expressed in the uterus compared to magnum and  <dig> transcripts expressed higher in the uterus than the white isthmus.

verification of gene expression by qrt-pcr analysis
of  <dig> genes that were over-expressed in the uterus by microarray analysis,  <dig> genes were selected for verification of transcript abundance using quantitative real time pcr  . these  <dig> genes were chosen to represent a wide range of gene expression . normalized expression levels of genes over-expressed in the uterus were compared to that of the magnum and white isthmus. log <dig> ratios of gene expression  were compared to expression levels obtained using microarray analysis. over-expression of these genes in the uterus was confirmed by qrt-pcr analysis for  <dig> of the  <dig> measurements. however, the expression of cathepsin a  was slightly lower in the uterus compared to isthmus, although the microarray data showed slightly higher  expression in the uterus. in the majority of cases, the amplitude of gene expression was higher with qrt-pcr analysis than with microarray analysis. however, the amplitude was lower for mannosidase  in both contrasts , while dentin matrix protein- <dig> , podocalyxin , and zinc finger protein  <dig>  were lower in the ut/wi contrast. the qrt-pcr analysis confirmed that expression of  <dig> genes selected for verification was significantly higher  in the uterus when compared to the magnum . when compared to isthmus, uterine expression was higher  for three other genes: ovocalyxin- <dig> , alpha-2-antiplasmin  and ovocalyxin- <dig> . although the abundance of 18s rna from each tissue was not significantly different, the normalization process increased variability of gene expression across three tissues. this variability could explain the absence of statistical differences for other genes in the uterus versus white isthmus contrast. nevertheless, microarray analysis shows many genes over-expressed in the uterus when compared to either the magnum or white isthmus.

functional annotation of uterine-specific genes
the  <dig> uterine gene sequences were annotated with assembled contigs and singletons and compared to translated proteins in public databases. as a first approach, we used the bioinformatics pipeline developed by syst√®me d'information d' analyse du genome des animaux d'elevage   <cit> . the sigenae est assemblies produce contigs from partial cdna sequences found in public databases. the  <dig> over-expressed uterine transcripts correspond to  <dig> chicken contigs present in the sigenae database. among these, some contig sequences were redundant and after removal of the redundancy,  <dig> unique transcripts were identified. these  <dig> transcripts correspond to  <dig> unique chicken unigene entries  <cit> . the  <dig> remaining sequences have no hits in the unigene database and therefore correspond to unknown genes that are differentially expressed in the uterus of the laying hen.

the sigenae bioinformatic tools were also used to identify proteins encoded by these uterine transcripts. similarity searches between contig sequences and uniprotkb entries were performed with an expected  value of 10- <dig> as threshold. we found that the  <dig> transcripts highly expressed in the uterus were related to  <dig> proteins with a unique uniprotkb id. among these,  <dig> were chicken  proteins, while three additional proteins were issued from other birds . a large majority of proteins was identified by homology to human , mouse , rat , bovine , other mammalian species , or other species .

gene ontology  term enrichment of uterine genes
gene ontology  terms are widely used for global interpretation of the function of proteins encoded by genes revealed by microarray analysis. expression analysis systematic explorer  software  <cit>  was used to compare go terms significantly enriched in the uterus transcriptome by comparison to the total go terms represented on the del-mar  <dig> k cdna microarray. go terms were assigned with the best ease score  and high enrichment value . the go terms were then classified in various groups according to biological functions .

*go term categories: cellular component , biological process  and molecular function . go term enrichment was analyzed using ease software http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/ease.

the most prominent proteins are involved in mineral transport and ion transfer in the uterus during formation of the eggshell. the terms hydrogen ion transporting atp synthase activity, rotational mechanism , atp synthesis coupled proton transport , hydrogen ion transporting atpase activity, rotational mechanism , and proton-transporting two-sector atpase complex  are related to proteins controlling atpase activity and encode four different atp synthases. this group also included the go: <dig>  composed of six genes coding an atp synthase, a sodium/potassium transporting atpase and a sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium atpase. nine genes refer to ions transport , encoding alpha-adducin , , purinergic receptor p2y , , a glutamate  receptor subunit zeta- <dig> , , a serine/threonine-protein kinase , which controls sodium and ion transport, sodium/potassium-transporting atpase, the ameloride-sensitive sodium channel subunit alpha . sodium ion transport term  include sodium/potassium-transporting atpase alpha  and beta  and the ameloride-sensitive sodium channel subunits alpha  and gamma . finally, the term go:  <dig>  contains  <dig> genes encoding  <dig> transport proteins, which include adp/atp translocase  <dig> , probable calcium transporting atpase , sodium/potassium-transporting atpase , a sodium- and chloride-dependent creatine transporter  and several miscellaneous proteins.

another group of importance was composed of uterine genes encoding ion binding proteins, which are essential for the mineral phase interactions during eggshell calcification. forty genes encode  <dig> proteins that selectively interact with metal ions , and  <dig> calcium ion binding proteins . among this last group of calcium ion binding proteins, annexin , desmoglein- <dig> , egf-like domain-containing protein  and mannosidase  transcripts were highly expressed in the hen's uterus during egg shell calcification. these genes had the highest expression levels, which were  <dig> - to  <dig> -times higher than the mean normalized intensity of all uterine genes. it is notable that amongst the  <dig> uterine specific transcripts, man1c <dig> was the most abundant normalized intensity and the greatest difference  compared to the two other oviduct segments . another group of binding proteins includes three different proteins, which interact selectively with biologically-active vitamin b <dig> .

go terms for structural molecule activity , protein polymerization , and protein complexes  are related to protein translation, maturation and post-translational modifications. lyase activity  is related to proteins, which catalyze cleavage of c-c, c-o, c-n and other bonds by ways other than hydrolysis or oxidation. five genes encode four different proteins related to synaptic transmission and nervous control of uterine activity. finally, two terms , are composed of  <dig> transcripts corresponding to  <dig> different proteins involved in regulation of gene transcription.

putative secreted eggshell proteins
our cdna microarray analysis has identified  <dig> highly-expressed uterine transcripts. the next hurdle is to determine which genes encode the numerous biologically-active proteins secreted by the hen's uterus during eggshell formation. genes encoding uterine proteins can be divided in two general groups:  <cit>  intracellular proteins involved in metabolism of the uterus and transporters of mineral precursors for the eggshell, but not secreted into the oviduct lumen and  <cit>  the extra-cellular proteins, which are secreted into the oviduct and deposited in the eggshell. to solve this problem, we have examined the eggshell "secretome". our initial approach was a comparison of the translated protein sequences from the  <dig> over-expressed uterine transcripts  with the eggshell proteins identified by recent proteome surveys  <cit> . a total of  <dig> genes over-expressed in uterus encode proteins revealed by the earlier proteomic analysis . in a second approach, the  <dig> proteins derived from the uterine genes were analyzed using signalp  <cit>  to evaluate the presence of a signal peptide sequence required for protein secretion.

based on the presence of conserved signal sequences, we estimated that about 14% of the genes over-expressed in the uterus encode  <dig> proteins possessing a signal peptide. the potential function of these  <dig> proteins was examined by bioinformatic analysis using multiple genomic resources  . finally, the isoelectric point and amino acid composition were determined in silico to establish which ones are negatively charged in the uterine fluid, since this property would favor an interaction with the calcite crystal during the calcification process. the biochemical properties  of some putative secreted proteins are presented in table  <dig>  we found nine basic proteins and a higher proportion of acidic proteins . among the acidic proteins, calnexin ), endoplasmin , peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase , nucleobindin , follistatin-related protein  <dig>  and calsyntenin- <dig>  have calcium binding properties. the acidic group also contains three proteins with immunoglobulin-like domains: neuroplastin , icos ligand  and beta-2-microglobulin . two additional proteins have antimicrobial properties . finally, beta-amyloid protein  and tissue factor pathway inhibitor  <dig>  are known inhibitors of serine proteinases.

discussion
the eggshell is a sophisticated dynamic structure essential for successful reproduction of birds. its architecture allows the diffusion of gases  between the developing embryo and the external environment. it also functions as a natural mechanical barrier to protect egg contents from the physical and microbial environment. its integrity and strength is therefore critical for survival of the developing embryo and for consumers to ensure that table eggs are free of pathogens. the exceptional mechanical properties of the shell are the result of interactions between eggshell minerals  and organic macromolecules , which comprise the organic matrix, a key factor required for shell calcification  <cit> . although the chicken eggshell is a very effective protective system, bacteria can penetrate the egg or enter the uterus via retrograde movement of fecal fluid from the cloaca prior to eggshell formation. antimicrobial protection is a function that has been most commonly ascribed to numerous egg white proteins that possess antimicrobial properties  <cit> , although this role was also described for the eggshell matrix. partially purified eggshell matrix exhibits antimicrobial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus  <cit> , which cannot be solely explained by the presence of lysozyme  <cit> , ovotransferrin  <cit>  and ovocalyxin- <dig>  <cit> --three principal antimicrobial proteins identified in the eggshell. in such a context, the identification and characterization of organic matrix components has stimulated numerous studies recently reviewed  <cit> .

in the present study, we have used transcriptional profiling of the hen's oviduct to identify genes that are differentially expressed in the uterus during eggshell calcification. egg proteins are sequentially deposited in the magnum, white isthmus and uterus as the forming egg passes through the hen's oviduct . the entire oviduct originates from the same population of cells  <cit> , which specialize at sexual maturity into specific regions  responsible for the deposition of egg white , eggshell membranes  and calcified shell  as the egg and its shell are formed. consequently, the comparison of gene expression in the uterus where the eggshell is formed with two other segments of the oviduct  should reveal genes encoding proteins involved in supplying mineral and organic precursors that participate in eggshell formation. using this unique approach, differential expression of genes should reveal specific functions of each specialized region that secrete egg components. our study revealed a total of  <dig> highly expressed transcripts that correspond to  <dig> different genes  and  <dig> proteins. forty-five transcripts have no match in nucleotide or protein databases and are considered as unknown genes present in the chicken genome.

previous studies have shown that the organic matrix is made of unique proteins including ovocleidin- <dig>  <cit> , ovocalyxin- <dig>  <cit> , ovocalyxin- <dig>  <cit>  and ovocalyxin- <dig>  <cit>  . these four proteins are preferentially expressed in the uterus during eggshell calcification. a single cdna insert corresponding to ovocalyxin- <dig> was present on our array but not expressed in the oviduct tissue. in contrast, the other three specific eggshell matrix genes were expressed only in the uterus as expected. osteopontin , a phosphorylated glycoprotein found in bone, kidney and various body secretions is over-expressed in epithelial cells of the uterus during eggshell calcification  <cit> . spp <dig> was over expressed in the uterus in our microarray study as indicated by a  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold higher expression when compared to magnum and isthmus, respectively. sixteen additional genes, over-expressed on microarrays were validated using qrt-pcr. genes selected for qrt-pcr verification represent a wide range of fold differences  in uterine genes with low levels , intermediate levels , high levels  and very abundant levels  in the uterus when compared to either the magnum or isthmus. from the  <dig> samples used in the microarray analysis,  <dig> laying hen oviduct samples were over-expressed in uterus. only a single sample, corresponding to the lowest fold change , could not be validated by qrt-pcr.

there are few reports of global gene expression in chickens, while only one paper is related to the hen's reproductive tract  <cit> , where oviduct gene expression was compared in mature versus juvenile birds using a custom  <dig> k cdna microarray. consequently, the over expressed genes were related to the dramatic changes due to the sexual maturity and the onset of egg production. in contrast, our samples were collected from mature hens during active calcification of the eggshell . therefore, our transcriptional analysis was focused on the uterus  during deposition of the eggshell. this approach allowed us to establish for the first time, the uterine transcriptome and  <dig> activated genes potentially related to eggshell deposition and associated cellular pathways. the functions of the  <dig> novel uterine transcripts were investigated using gene ontology  annotation. the go terms of the over-expressed genes in the uterus were compared to all go terms represented on the  <dig> k array. the most over-represented proteins  were related to ion transport which occurs during calcification  <cit> . our transcriptional analysis has confirmed proteins previously identified as transporters and revealed new ionic transporters involved in supply of minerals needed for building the eggshell . in addition, a go term revealed a higher expression of proteins involved in synaptic transmission . this observation could be related with the activation of muscle contraction and mobility of the uterus during rotation of the egg to facilitate calcification and/or final expulsion of the completed egg  <cit> . our study has also demonstrated high abundance of genes involved in protein synthesis during the eggshell formation.

the uterus synthesizes both intracellular and extracellular proteins, which are secreted into the uterine fluid where the mineralization takes place. we paid particular attention to the extracellular proteins, which form the eggshell matrix and consequently are suspected to be involved in mineralization or chemical protection of the egg. our first approach was to compare proteins encoded by uterine genes with those identified by proteomics. indeed, proteomics is an important high-throughput methodology, which enabled the identification of  <dig> proteins in the calcified eggshell  <cit> . our study confirmed uterine expression of  <dig> previously characterized eggshell proteins and transcripts for several new proteins not yet characterized in the eggshell. this limited number is partly due to the fact that some eggshell proteins are also expressed in other tissues along the oviduct. consequently, these proteins are present in the eggshell, although but not revealed by our transcriptional analysis. the main advantage of the proteomics method is the ability to identify minute amounts of biologically active proteins in tissue or fluid. the eggshell proteome contains a complex mixture of uterine-derived proteins, additional proteins derived from degraded cells or basement membranes and those issued from the upper oviduct   <cit> . the number of eggshell proteins identified by mass spectrometry  is 4- <dig> times greater than those found in other egg compartments   <cit> . consequently, it is likely that the eggshell also passively incorporates proteins produced in the upper oviduct. to determine which proteins are potentially secreted by uterine cells and then deposited in the shell, we examined the presence of a signal peptide in  <dig> protein sequences obtained from the  <dig> highly-expressed uterine transcripts. a total of  <dig> proteins with signal peptide sequences were identified using several protein-centric databases  . these proteins were classified according to their biological function in the eggshell. the first group contains proteins involved in the biomineralization of the shell. for example, osteopontin  is a protein found in both bone and eggshell  <cit> . the role of spp <dig> in mineralization of the chicken eggshell has been described in detail  <cit> . abnormal expression of spp <dig> in the shell gland  is related to abnormalities and cracks in the eggshell  <cit> . also included are ovocleidin- <dig> , ovocalyxin- <dig>  and ovocalyxin- <dig> , which are three eggshell matrix proteins specific to uterine tissue  <cit> . their presence is unique to the calcified shell and their expression limited to the uterus. ocx- <dig> contains a brichos domain and consequently, could play a role as molecular chaperone. a similar role is also proposed for endoplasmin , a protein from the heat shock protein  <dig> family. chaperone proteins in uterine fluid could play an important role in proper folding of the eggshell matrix, which is the crucial template for eggshell calcification. several additional proteins involved in protein folding were identified in the  <dig> proteins possessing a signal peptide sequences. among these, four proteins  were previously identified in eggshell proteomic survey  <cit> . these four proteins contain immunoglobulin-like  domains involved in cell-cell recognition, cell-surface receptors and immune responses  <cit> . the ig-like domain is one of the most common protein modules found in a variety of mammalian proteins including sandwich-like proteins, which are crucial for protein folding and conformation  <cit> . lysosomal alpha manosidase  plays also a role in protein folding and it is the most abundant uterine gene revealed by our microarray analysis. in the recent eggshell proteome survey  <cit> , five proteins correspond to man2b <dig>  man2b <dig> is a glycoside hydrolase, that participates in the metabolism of glycoproteins, maturation of n-glycans and in protein folding  <cit> . its role is related to calnexin , an acidic protein  also identified as a putative uterine secretatory proteins, which have not been previously found among eggshell proteins. canx is a molecular chaperone, which assists in protein folding. canx binds only glycoproteins that have been folded by enzyme . consequently, these two proteins could be involved in metabolism of glycoprotein and proteoglycan, which are part of the eggshell matrix and thought to interact with calcite crystals and influence the texture of the mineralized shell and its mechanical properties  <cit> .

slit, an axon guidance molecule involved in the embryonic development  <cit>  was identified among our  <dig> secreted proteins  and in the earlier eggshell proteomic analysis  <cit> . slit <dig> encodes a large extracellular matrix protein composed of leucine rich repeat motifs, which provide a structural framework for protein-protein interactions. in addition, slit protein contains a domain corresponding to epidermal growth factor  with a repeat pattern involving a number of cysteine residues thought to be important for the three-dimensional structure of proteins. consequently, we believe that slit might be involved in folding of the eggshell matrix. it is also notable that slit has a calcium-binding site at the n-terminus of egf-like domains. calcium-binding properties often are a prerequisite for matrix proteins involved in calcium biomineralization. consequently, slit could interact with calcium to favor crystal nucleation and morphology of crystals by interacting with some crystal faces of calcite. the ordered deposition of calcium carbonate  determines the texture of biominerals found in a large variety of calcified structures  <cit> . amongst the  <dig> putative secretatory proteins, we have identified ten additional calcium-binding proteins; some of them were not previously characterized in the eggshell. these calcium binding proteins are endoplasmin , slit <dig>  slit <dig> , nucleobindin- <dig> , follistatin-related protein- <dig>  and fk506-binding protein  <dig> ; all contain calcium-binding ef-hand domains. calcium is also a ligand of calsyntherin- <dig> and mannose-binding protein c , which could also interact with calcium during eggshell fabrication. another interesting secretatory protein is podocalyxin , a sialoprotein, which was first identified in the renal glomerular podocytes  <cit>  and more recently as a selectin ligand that facilitates metastasis  <cit> . because of its high net negative charge, podxl could interact with calcium carbonate during the calcification of the eggshell.

we also identified dentin matrix protein- <dig>  as a secreted uterine protein. dmp <dig> is a calcium-binding protein that plays a role in dentin mineralization. this protein is a member of the fam <dig> family corresponding to secreted proteins that regulate differentiation and function of hematopoiesis cells  <cit> . this protein was predicted as secreted and was found in the recent proteome survey  <cit> . we also paid a particular attention to bmp-binding endothelial regulator protein  and chordin . bmper is a secreted protein known to interact with bone morphogenetic proteins  and bmp2/ <dig> antagonists in humans  <cit> . chrd was first identified for its involvement in dorsalization of tissue in embryos. it is also a secreted protein, which binds bmp- <dig> - <dig> and - <dig>  <cit> . bmps are members of the tgf-Œ≤ superfamily of proteins and are known to induce the formation of new cartilage and bone following its ectopic implantation  <cit> . studies in mollusks and coral suggest a role of bmps in biomineralization  <cit> . although bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> cdnas were not present on our microarray, we used qrt- pcr to show higher level of expression  of bmp <dig> in the uterus  when compared to the magnum . therefore, it is likely that bmp <dig> is present in the uterine fluid and contributes to eggshell formation.

the second group of proteins, secreted in the uterus with a putative protective role, has antimicrobial properties. antimicrobial proteins are found in the various compartments of the egg , where they protect the egg against bacterial invasion, keeping the egg free of pathogens. previous studies have shown that the eggshell matrix exhibits antimicrobial activity  <cit> . three antimicrobial proteins  have been identified in the eggshell  <cit> . our study has identified additional antimicrobial proteins secreted by the uterus, particularly proteins that contain ig-like domains , which are related to the immune responses  <cit> . of particular interest are amyloid beta a <dig> protein  and beta-amyloid protein  <dig> isoform , which contain an amyloid extracellular domain and a heparin-binding domain. heparin-binding proteins have basic domains, which might antimicrobial by binding to lipolysachharide   <cit> .

our study has also revealed over-expression of avian Œ≤-defensin  <dig>   in the uterus. the avian Œ≤-defensins  are small cationic non-glycosylated peptides  with a three-stranded Œ≤-sheet structure connected with a Œ≤-hairpin loop that protect against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . in mammals, Œ≤-defensins are involved in innate immunity and are capable of evading pathogen resistance mechanisms. in birds, avbd <dig> is highly expressed in the trachea, esophagus and crop, while lower expression is found in skin, liver, testis and vas deferens  <cit> . our transcriptional analysis indicates that avbd <dig> is also expressed in the chicken uterus, where this antimicrobial peptide could contribute to the aseptic environment of the hen's oviduct. this idea is supported by the appearance of avbd1- <dig> in cultured vaginal cells following salmonella enteritidis or lps exposure  <cit> .

the third group of candidate proteins is proteases and antiproteases, which are involved in blood coagulation, cell migration and proliferation, innate defense and gamete maturation. we have identified three proteases: cathepsin a , glioma pathogenesis-related protein  <dig>  and beta-secretase  <dig> . previous work has shown that proteolytic activity present in uterine fluid varies according to the stage of the calcification  <cit> . proteases could have a specific and controlled role during the calcification process, by either degrading proteins or regulating processing of proteins into mature forms. for example, ctsa has important roles in protein catabolism and in posttranslational processing of proteins and peptides, which ensures their stability and proper maturation  <cit> .

seven over-expressed genes encoding uterine antiproteases were identified in our study. amyloid beta a <dig> protein , follistatin-related protein  <dig>  tissue factor pathway inhibitor  <dig>  and beta-amyloid protein  <dig> isoform , all contain a kunitz/bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor domain. alpha2-antiplasmin  belongs to the serine protease inhibitor  family. bmp-binding endothelial regulator protein  contains a trypsin inhibitor like cysteine rich domain; and tissue metalloproteinase inhibitor  <dig>  belongs to the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase  family. proteases inhibitors could locally regulate the proteolytic activity of the uterine proteases or have an antimicrobial action by inhibiting bacterial proteases  <cit> . besides their potential role in physical and chemical defense of the egg, the proteases and anti-proteases are likely to participate in embryonic development. the embryo gradually mobilizes calcium from the eggshell to ensure bone formation; therefore, active release of proteases or anti-proteases is needed for normal development. interestingly, several proteases and anti-proteases identified in our work  have been described in other species as major agents of neurite outgrowth and cell survival  <cit> , whereas serpinf <dig>  timp <dig> and tfpi <dig> are implicated in angiogenesis and morphogenesis  <cit> . additionally, fstl <dig> is a regulator of early mesoderm patterning, somitogenesis, myogenesis and neural development in the chick embryo  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
global gene expression profiling of the hen's oviduct during eggshell formation has revealed a large number of differentially expressed genes. our study took advantage of tissue sampling from specialized segments of the oviduct that sequentially form different egg components and a bioinformatic analysis of the differentially expressed genes and their encoded proteins. this transcriptome approach enabled identification of more than  <dig> over-expressed genes in the uterus that are involved in providing precursors of the eggshell or proteins secreted into uterine fluid for fabrication of the eggshell and chemical protection of the egg. our approach complements earlier focused proteomic analysis of the eggshell  <cit>  that revealed more than  <dig> eggshell proteins, albeit less than 10% of the identified proteins were common to both strategies. the characterization of all proteins in the eggshell is a prerequisite for exploration of functional properties and regulation of uterine proteins involved in fabrication of the eggshell. additional biochemical studies are needed to confirm the biological activity of these putative proteins and to understand their roles in providing nutrients and protection for the developing embryo. our study could lead to improvements in the hygienic quality of this important human food and reveal novel proteins that might be useful for pharmacological applications. in addition, genes involved in the physical or chemical defense of the egg against pathological agents, are functional candidates for a marker assisted selection to improve egg and eggshell quality. furthermore, identification of all protein components in the egg will allow optimization of the egg's defense system and, consequently, contribute to reduce risk of food-borne diseases.
