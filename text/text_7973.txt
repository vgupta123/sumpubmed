BACKGROUND

mycoplasma hominis is an opportunistic human pathogen and resides on the mucosal surfaces of the cervix or vagina in  <dig> to 53% of sexually mature women; its presence is somewhat lower in the urethra of males. the presence of m. hominis is associated with clinically diverse diseases including; urogenital diseases, postpartum fever  <cit> , pneumonia  <cit> , meningitis, post-operative wound infection, post-organ transplant infection  <cit>  and septic arthritis. the capacity of m. hominis to cause disease has been proven by induction of preterm labour and development of foetal chronic lung disease following experimental in utero administration of m. hominis to pregnant macaque monkeys  <cit> .

understanding pathogen epidemiology and transmission is important in preventing future infections and comprehending the transmission chains. there is currently no standardised method of molecular typing for m. hominis and due to the fastidious growth requirements of mollicutes, genomic typing is unlikely to be available for routine practice for the foreseeable future. current discriminatory methods for typing of m. hominis to improve understanding of epidemiology of infection and genetic diversity are not in clinical use. several molecular typing mechanisms have been developed for m. hominis including: restriction fragment length polymorphism  analysis, amplified length polymorphism   <cit>  and random amplified polymorphic dna   <cit> . these techniques have displayed poor reproducibility , require specialist equipment, time, and large quantities of biological material to perform the test. differing typing schemes based on sequence analysis of the p <dig>  p120’ and vaa genes do not give concordant results  <cit> . multiple locus variable-number tandem-repeat  analysis  has successfully been used to subtype other mycoplasma species. however, the high genetic heterogeneity of m. hominis restricted the test’s use to individual studies, and was too discriminatory for large epidemic studies  <cit> .

multi-locus sequence typing  analysis of the diversity of housekeeping genes that are considered to be under less selective pressure than other genes have been successfully employed for several bacterial species including mycoplasmas such as m. bovis  <cit> , m. agalactiae, m. hyorhinis  <cit>  and m. hyopneumoniae  <cit> . sogaard et. al examined six house-keeping gene sequences to investigate evidence of genomic recombination in m. hominis and revealed a high degree of variability between these genes  <cit> . however, the authors did not utilise the data to create a genotyping scheme. the aim of this study was to develop an mlst scheme based on analysis of m. hominis genomic sequences to derive the minimum number of genes required to accurately reflect genomic phylogeny.

RESULTS
pan-genome
raw genomic sequence reads from 18 m. hominis clinical isolates  were assembled and scanned against a database of hidden markov models  representing gene coding families constructed using four complete genomes published on ncbi: atcc  <dig> , pg <dig> , sprott , and af <dig>  . on average, m. hominis pan genome clustering was able to detect  <dig>  genes per sample, which is comparable to the mean number of genes found in the four reference genomes . the m. hominis pan-genome contained total of  <dig> genes  with  <dig> genes  present across all samples and the reference strain atcc <dig> at least once. the shoulders in the pan-genome frequency distribution are likely to correspond to the genes found in the specific phylogenetic clades, fig.  <dig>  the number of alleles per gene family is normally distributed with mean of  <dig> alleles per gene, fig.  <dig>  this is as expected given the relatively long phylogenetic distance from the reference genome observed in the whole genome snp tree . no hyper-variant, large copy number genes, such as transposases and integrases, were detected in the pan-genome data analysis.table  <dig> details of m. hominis isolates. isolates originating from the same patient sample are indicated by boxes

core-genome mlst
a subset of genes found across all samples are likely to be highly conserved and carry little phylogenetic signal. conversely, a small subset of genes could be carrying phylogenetic signal that is similar to the species as a whole, and therefore can be used as a proxy for whole genome evolution. in order to identify genes that carry increased discriminatory potential, leave-one-out analysis was performed. this involved removing one gene at a time from the set of  <dig> core genes and constructing a phylogenetic tree using the remaining alleles from  <dig> genes. the resulting phylogenetic tree was compared with the phylogeny derived using whole genome variants . of the  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes  conferred the same phylogenetic topology as the whole genome tree whilst  <dig> genes  disrupted the phylogenetic relationship of the samples to varying extent. these results suggest that these  <dig> genes are necessary in reconstructing the correct relationships between the isolates included in this study, fig.  <dig>  to assess the sufficiency of these genes to replicate the topology, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using only these  <dig> genes , confirming that these  <dig> genes were necessary and sufficient for tree reconstruction. these genes are considered the minimum gene set to construct a core-genome mlst scheme for m. hominis as they are present in all reference genomes and the  <dig> sequenced m. hominis strains, and are each required to reconstruct the whole genome topology.fig.  <dig> core gene mosaic for m. hominis: allele mosaic of  <dig> genes found to be necessary and sufficient for reproducing phylogenetic relationships observed in the maximum likelihood tree constructed with whole genome snp data. each colour in a column represent an allele, identical colours in the same column correspond to the same allele. however, colours may be repeated between columns




7-gene mlst schema
analysis indicated that 48c7 =  <dig> , <dig> total combinations of allelic profile could be derived from the genomic data of  <dig> isolates; exhaustive search of a large search space like this is not computationally tractable. subsets of target genes were selected in order to reduce the size of the search space for further analysis and contained three sets of genes; genes that caused lowest overlap with the whole genome snp tree in leave-one-out analysis , manually selected genes for their biological function , and combination of the above two sets . two sets of genomic data from m. hominis isolates originating from two single patient samples were included, patient 1: mh <dig> and mh <dig>  patient 2: mh <dig> and mh <dig>  these isolate pairs were used to identify which gene sets conferred identical mlst profiles for these lineages. the reduction in the selected target genes resulted in  <dig> possible combinations of the three gene category subsets. all combinations were analysed for phylogenetic topology closest to that obtained with genomic snp analysis. fifteen combinations were identified to produce the highest and identical topological similarity of  <dig>  among all tested combinations and three schemas  were found to confer the highest similarity to the whole genome snp tree. all  <dig> phylogenetic trees classified mh <dig> and mh <dig> into a different subtree from the original whole genome analysis. in addition, trees from schemas b and c classified mh <dig> into a different topological position. three selected schemas had overall very similar topology to the original whole genome snp tree representing two general clades and correct bifurcations. schema a correctly placed mh <dig> as outer most group to that clade, whereas schemas b and c incorrectly placed the ancestry of mh <dig>  the branch length of the whole genome snp tree could not be reproduced as shorter sequences with different number of snps were used. overall the three schemas almost completely reproduced the phylogenetic relationship found using whole genome snp data.table  <dig> three proposed 7-locus mlst schemas for m. hominis: the three schemas contain variations of  <dig> genes that confer phylogenetic relationships similar to those found using whole genome snps. schemas b and c show higher marginal diversity in hunter-gaston diversity indicex than schema a. whereas, schema a shows lowest dn/ds ratio among the three

7-gene in-silico pcr
although full gene schemas can be used for in-silico mlst predictions using existing software, e.g. srst <dig>  <cit>  it is desirable to have a typing technique based on short  pcr fragments. a set of primers  was designed to minimise polymorphisms in primer binding sites, while maximizing information content required to approximate to whole genome snp based phylogeny. tree topologies from sequence products from all schemas were compared to the topologies of trees using full length genes and whole genome snps. schema ashowed the highest similarity to the topology observed in whole genome snp tree, similarity score  <dig> . schemas b and c showed lower similarity scores  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively.table  <dig> pcr primers: proposed pcr primers to be used to amplify the  <dig> mlst loci

diversity of mlst genes and determination of synonymous sequence changes
the hunter-gaston di was calculated for each schema and showed that all three schemas have discriminatory power of  <dig>  st per m. hominis strain . all three mlst schemas are close together in terms of their diversity index indicating that there was no optimal combination of seven genes. indeed, the schemas only differ by two genes . however only scheme a correctly positioned mh <dig> 

genes under negative selective pressure are more suitable targets for an mlst schema as they are actively conserved in the host, especially where the organism exhibits a high level of genetic diversity. for each of the three proposed mlst schemas the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous  changes were calculated using the nei and gojobori method  <cit>  . all genes in all three mlst schemas have a dn/ds ratio of <  <dig>  schemas a, b and c all contain genes under moderate negative selective pressure: schema a gene- <dig> and gene-519; schema b gene- <dig>  gene- <dig> and gene-519; and schema c: gene- <dig> and gene- <dig>  the remaining genes have dn/ds ratio below  <dig>  indicating strong negative selection. overall, schema a appears to contain, on average, a more strongly selected gene set , than the other two schemas .

seven gene mlst stability
stability of the genes for all three schemas was assessed in two m. hominis strains. whole genome sequencing was performed following short-term passage  in liquid culture and compared to the original sequence. none of the genes showed allelic variation in the two strains examined .fig.  <dig> mlst genes stability analysis: allele mosaic of the  <dig> genes included from all three schemas shows no variation between alleles for the samples undergone  <dig> passages 




recombination analysis
genomic sequences of the m. hominis strains were assessed for predicted regions of variation arising from homologous recombination. recombination analysis was undertaken using gubbins. the tree derived using whole genome snps and used in leave-one-out analysis was used as a starting tree for gubbins. multiple potential areas of recombination were identified across all genomic m. hominis data included in the study . in particular, high levels of recombination were predicted in the phylogenetic clade containing the reference strain atcc  <dig>  with multiple recombination events predicted at the same loci.fig.  <dig> prediction of recombination in the m. hominis isolates: regions of variation in the genomes of the  <dig> clinical m. hominis isolates and the prototype strain atcc  <dig> which are predicted to have arisen by homologous recombination are shown in the panel on the right. red blocks indicated recombination predicted to have occurred on internal nodes, blue indicates taxa-specific recombination, isolates are ordered according to the phylogenetic tree displayed on the left




discussion
assessment of the pan-genome assembled for m. hominis revealed  <dig> core genes. previous examination of mycoplasma species pan-genome identified a core-genome of only  <dig> genes ; however, this was an inter-species analysis and lower levels of conserved gene than observed in this study is to be expected. of the entire pan-genome, the core genome represents 55% of all genes. this level of similarity between m. hominis strains is in stark contrast to m. pneumoniae where over 99% identity has been observed between the genomes  <cit> . congruence of the m. hominis pan-genome to other mycoplasma species was assessed by comparison to m. pneumoniae  and u. parvum serovar  <dig> . pereyre et al. have done a similar analysis and presented  <dig> genes to be orthologous between the three species  <cit> . no significant hits to any of the genes in the m. hominis pan-genome were identified, suggesting that m. hominis is a distant relative to these mycoplasma species, sharing little sequence similarity in the coding genes. while pereyre et al. found  <dig> genes in common; that similarity was based on low percentage identity between the genes. for example, dnaa genes from u. parvum  and m. hominis  only share 29% identity as reported by blast alignment. whereas, the method used in this study was directed towards high similarity, therefore biased against finding significantly conserved genes. high degree of diversity is concordant with mycoplasma species phylogeny based on 16s rrna sequences  <cit> . kokotovic et al. and busch et al. have shown high level of intra-species variability within m. hominis by examining clinical isolates using aflp and rflp analysis  <cit> .

to determine stability of the proposed genes for the seven gene mlst schemas, sequences were compared before and after short-term passage in two m.hominis strains . genes found to be genetically variable after short-term passage would be unsuitable candidates for an mlst schema. from the set of  <dig> genes, required to replicate whole genome sequence snp phylogeny, one gene  was found to have acquired mutations and was therefore not suitable for use in the mlst schemas. genomic stability was only assessed in two m. hominis strains, it is likely that further instability would be identified upon assessment of a larger number of strains. sequence heterogeneity has been well documented for m. hominis  <cit>  and therefore it is essential that the stability of the genes chosen for the three mlst schemes is further assessed.

recombination has previously been examined for m. hominis; however, only a limited number of genes were examined  <cit> . nevertheless, analysis revealed inter- and intra-genic recombination in m. hominis and recombination was proposed as a method for the high intra-species variability of m. hominis. in addition, examination of m. pneumoniae, m. genitalium, m. pulmonis and ureaplasma urealyticum indicated a large number of repeats within the genomes of these organisms suggesting the existence of a large potential for recombination. in concordance with this, a large number of predicted recombination sites were identified in this study. this could be due to the diversity of the isolates from the reference used for mapping. the reference is on average  <dig> snps from the isolates and each isolate is on average  <dig> snps from each other isolate, indicating a large degree of diversity.  <dig> isolates used in this study, although adequate for inferring phylogenetic relationship, do not represent the full temporal and geographic diversity of the m. hominis species and future analysis of a larger data set may reveal the true extent of recombination in this species. currently, with the potential for a large number of recombination events, discriminatory methods that rely on phylogenetic trees have limitations. in this case, the phylogenetic tree is influenced to a greater extent by horizontal transfer of genetic material, rather than vertical inheritance from the parental strains.

the development of mlst schemes has been important both individually and epidemiologically for pathogenic bacteria. at the level of an individual patient, this approach allows discrimination between relapse or persistence and new infection. in this study, m. hominis strains originating from the same patient specimen were used to determine gene sets that conferred identical mlst profiles for these strains. furthermore, identical mlst profiles can be used to identify sexual transmission of m. hominis infections or horizontal transmission between mother and baby and may also be used in cases of post-transplant infection. other methods including mlva typing of m. hominis isolates from two mother-neonate pairs resulted in the identification of identical mlva types in each case studied, confirming mother-to-child transmission  <cit> . this study describes mlst schemes with a di of  <dig>  st per m. hominis strain, revealing a genetic heterogeneity among this species.

genomic sequencing may eventually displace traditional mlst based on multiple gene target pcr and sequencing. however, lack of local/international capability of genomic sequencing technology, specialised culture requirements of mycoplasmas and volume of biomass required to obtain sufficient high quality dna for analysis is unlikely to lend whole genome sequencing analysis to provide practical clinical guidance for this bacterial species and other fastidious organisms. the major advantage of utilising pcr-based mlst, relative to whole genome sequencing, is the ability to conduct pcr amplification directly on clinical samples. the advent and improvement of metagenomics processes and analysis may eventually supersede this; however, practical use on infections with mycoplasmas and mixed strains is not yet tested. a phylogenetic analysis of a mixed population of m. hominis strains would not be possible directly on a clinical sample; however, this may be feasible on infections originating from a clonal m. hominis infection

CONCLUSIONS
this study has utilised bioinformatics analysis of m. hominis genomic sequence to identify a minimum set of  <dig> genes required to recapitulate the relationships observed in the whole genome phylogeny of m. hominis constructed using snp data. following this, three sets of seven genes were identified that could be used to construct an mlst typing schema. due to availability and costs of whole genome sequencing and the challenges in obtaining adequate m. hominis dna, the use of whole genome sequence analysis to provide clinical guidance is impractical for this bacterial species as well as other fastidious organisms. furthermore, this study has identified pcr primers and found schema a to have the highest topological similarity to the phylogenetic tree constructed using whole genome snps. the results presented here, provide a novel approach for the development of mlst schemes that accurately represent genomic phylogeny for use in epidemiology and transmission studies.
