BACKGROUND
in denmark, bovine viral diarrhea  is considered an exotic disease  <cit> . an eradication program was initiated in  <dig>  <cit>  and in the period from 2007– <dig>  only  <dig> out of approximately  <dig> dairy herds were diagnosed with bvd by bulk tank milk  testing. all dairy herds were screened quarterly by btm, while beef herds were screened at abattoir by blood sampling. if the btm is classified as positive, individual animals are tested to find at least one antibody positive . if the positive herd status is confirmed, all non-antibody positive animals are tested to detect the viremic animals and persistently infected  cattle are eliminated  <cit> .

the bvd virus  can cause uterine infections in pregnant cows, abortions, stillbirths or weak calves . cows exposed to bvdv in the first 120 days of pregnancy, can give birth to calves, which become pi  <cit> . pi cattle shed the virus in large amounts throughout their lives, while other transiently infected  animals shed the virus in small amounts for 2– <dig> weeks and become lifelong immune .

because the danish dairy herd size has increased remarkably since the eradication program started  <cit> , an evaluation and eventual optimization of the danish bvd surveillance system was considered necessary by the danish cattle federation. an optimal early-warning system based on btm testing should detect newly infected herds as soon as possible. early-warning surveillance systems are those aimed to detect the “unexpected threats” in a timely way  <cit> . hence an early-warning system should be based on a) the risk that some herds become infected and b) the time needed to detect antibodies in btm. the latter is known to depend on the herd size and on the threshold prevalence of antibody positive milking cows, at which the btm can be classified as positive with the antibody elisa used  <cit> .

the time from the introduction of a pathogen into the country, until it is detected by the surveillance activities, can be defined as “high risk period”   <cit> , or “timeliness”  <cit> . in this study we use the former term, to emphasize the fact that the longer the time required for detection the higher is the risk the pathogen is spread from the first case herd to other danish herds.

the probability of detecting a pathogen in a given time period has been called “temporal sensitivity”  <cit> .

in two previous studies we estimated the detection time for bvd in danish dairy herds  <cit>  and the annual probability of bvd introduction into the danish dairy population  <cit> . here we considered danish dairy herds and beef herds as two distinct populations in the country, as in foddai et al.  <cit> , and we evaluated the bvd surveillance system for the danish dairy population .

hence, the aims of the present study where  to evaluate the temporal sensitivity of the danish bvd surveillance system  with fixed hrps, according to different routes of bvdv introduction into danish dairy herds ,  to investigate surveillance optimization, by taking into account the risk of bvdv introduction to the country, the herd size, and the antibody elisa used on btm; and  to estimate  the confidence in low herd prevalence  and in complete freedom from bvd .

methods
to estimate the temsse of the danish surveillance system, we developed a stochastic scenario tree model  . inputs for the model were obtained by data analysis , risk assessment  and modelling of within-herd bvd dynamics . thereafter, the estimated temsse was used to calculate the negative predictive value  of the surveillance system   <cit> , which represented the confidence in low herd prevalence  or in complete freedom from bvd  according to the design prevalence used. finally, a sensitivity analysis  was carried out to investigate the impact of each input parameter on the output.fig.  <dig> stochastic scenario tree representing the bvd surveillance system for danish dairy herds. prpimpocattle and prpnoimpocattle = proportion of dairy herds within the impocattle and noimpocattle category, respectively. epiimpocattle and epinoimpocattle = effective probability of infection for the impocattle and noimpocattle category. ptrimpocattle and ptrnoimpocattle = probability that the threshold prevalence is reached within the milking paddock at  <dig> or 365 days from bvdv introduction within herds of the impocattle and noimpocattle category. se = expected sensitivity of the antibody elisa used  on btm, when the threshold prevalence of seropositive milking cows is reached



stochastic scenario tree methodology used to estimate the temsse
the sensitivity of national veterinary surveillance systems  can be evaluated through use of stochastic scenario tree models . information from different surveillance sources can be combined into an overall sse estimate, taking into account  the prevalence of infected herds in a country ,  the prevalence of infected animals within a herd ,  the relative risk  of infection in the population´s strata, and  the sensitivity  of the diagnostic test used  <cit> .

thus the sse represents the probability that a population, infected with the assumed ph and pu, is correctly classified by the surveillance system . furthermore, in the methodology by martin et al.  <cit>  it is usually assumed that the specificity of the surveillance system is 100 %. thus, if a positive sample is found, further confirmatory testing is made in the herd to avoid false positive results. in this study, we made the same assumption.

we developed a stochastic scenario tree  in an excel spreadsheet  using the software @risk  <dig> . the model was run using  <dig>  iterations and latin hypercube sampling.

the ph was set at  <dig>  % , or as  <dig>  %, indicating that we aimed at detecting the first infected herd. the  <dig>  % ph is similar to the limit set by the world animal health organization  to substantiate officially free status for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis   <cit> , which can be considered a disease similar to bvd, in terms of transmission routes. in fact, ibr is also caused by a virus, which can be transmitted between cattle herds and countries by moved animals, contaminated semen, embryos, and fomites  <cit> . furthermore, these very low design prevalences used in this study give conservative temsse estimates, as the lower the disease prevalence between herds the more difficult it is to detect the disease.

pu was here defined as the threshold prevalence of antibody positive milking cows, at which the btm was classified positive by the elisa used . with “fast” spreading pathogens, it can be assumed that pu is quickly reached. in contrast, bvdv can be considered, in some cases, as a “slowly” spreading virus, especially if it is introduced into large herds through ti animals  <cit> . therefore, a long time could elapse before pu is reached within a herd and before such a herd is detected by the surveillance system . for that reason, we estimated the temporal sensitivity of the surveillance system  for two different elisas, with a hrp of  <dig> or 365 days. those two time intervals lead to temsse testing quarterly  or testing one year after bvdv introduction into the danish dairy population , respectively. the effect of introducing one pi calf or one ti milking cow into naïve danish dairy herd, on the final temsse was also investigated.

moreover, dairy herds were divided into two levels of risk: herds with import of live cattle  or without  , based on a previous study  <cit> .

input parameters used in the stochastic scenario tree
we used data from the last trimester of  <dig>  when approximately  <dig> herds  delivered milk and were tested in the btm. hence, we considered a single surveillance component, which includes the whole population of danish dairy herds.

the steps needed for a bvd positive dairy herd, to give a positive btm value are represented with nodes in the scenario tree in fig.  <dig>  the first node divided the population of tested dairy herds into the two risk categories: noimpocattle and impocattle. thus, the proportion of dairy herds in each risk category was represented by prpnoimpocattle and prpimpocattle, respectively .

the probability that a herd was infected with bvd was represented by the effective probability of infection in the category  . the epij for each herd category “j” was obtained by multiplying the between-herds design prevalence  with the adjusted relative risk  of infection  <cit> . the relative risk estimates of each category  were adjusted to maintain the specified relativity  and yet average to one over the whole population  <cit> .

the noimpocattle category was used as risk reference category with rrnoimpocattle =  <dig>  while for the impocattle category we set rrimpocattle = rimpocattle/rnoimpocattle. where, the numerator and denominator represented the risk of bvd introduction for the impocattle and noimpocattle category, respectively .

thereafter, the arr for the noimpocattle category was estimated as:  <dig> arrnoimpocattle=1prpnoimpocattle+rrimpocattle×prpimpocattle 

while, the arr for the impocattle category was:  <dig> arrimpocattle=arrnoimpocattle×rrimpocattle 

furthermore, the component unit sensitivity was calculated as the weighted sum of the probabilities with a positive outcome at the end of each limb of the stochastic scenario tree . therefore, at the assumed ph, the overall probability  that at least one btm positive herd was detected in the btm surveillance system was:  <dig> temsse=1‐1‐prpnoimpocattle×epinoimpocattlexptrnoimpocattle×se+prpimpocattle×epiimpocattle×ptrimpocattle×sen 

where, ptrnoimpocattle and ptrimpocattle represented the probability that the threshold prevalence of seropositive cows  was already reached within the milking group at the day of btm testing , in noimpocattle or impocattle herds, respectively.

the se was the sensitivity of the test used on the btm sample. we assumed that the test´s se could be achieved, when the threshold prevalence was reached. a similar approach was used by graat et al.  <cit>  for ibr. when the threshold prevalence was not reached, we assumed that the btm of an infected dairy herd was classified as negative.

data analysis
descriptive data analyses were carried out using the freeware r . data from  <dig>  on herd size, milk deliverance, imports/exports of live cattle, imports of semen and embryos, were obtained from the danish cattle federation for all danish dairy cattle herds.

moreover, for both herd categories, we estimated the percentage of imported goods from countries without or with endemic bvd . we made this distinction on the bvd status of the sending countries, because it could affect the risk of introducing bvdv into the danish cattle population  <cit> .table  <dig> results of data analysis for herds with import of cattle  and without

c the number of hoof trimmers visiting cattle herds abroad  during a one-year period was a pert distribution , while the number of times each hoof trimmer crosses the border  was pert  . the annual number of hoof trimmer visits, which could lead to bvdv introduction into each category, was assumed proportional to the herds present in the category and was estimated by: a * b * prpimpocattle and a * b * prpnoimpocattle



dthe epij reported in the table was calculated using ph  <dig>  %. when we used ph  <dig>  % the epij was  <dig>  for the impocattle category and  <dig>  % for the noimpocattle



risk assessment per herd category
the annual risk of bvdv introduction in each risk category  was calculated by use of a stochastic model, which was previously developed by foddai et al.  <cit> . results of the data analysis  were fed into such a model.

for the noimpocattle category, we included the following sources of infection: import of semen and embryos, visits by contaminated trucks used abroad, and visits by hoof trimmers practicing in cattle herds in denmark and in other countries. for the impocattle category, we included the same bvdv introduction routes plus imports of live cattle.

information on truck visits and hoof trimmers was based on the previous study  <cit> . the overall annual number of truck visits, which could lead to introduction of bvdv into danish dairy herds, was previously estimated to  <dig>  <cit> . for each of the two herd categories, we assumed that the number of truck visits at risk occurring in a year  was proportional to the number of exports from the category .

the annual number of hoof trimmer visits, which could lead to bvdv introduction into each category, was also estimated  and was assumed to be proportional to the number of herds present in each category.

for other variables , we used the same assumptions and input values described in foddai et al.  <cit> .

hence, the risk of bvdv introduction in the impocattle category  was estimated using five published stochastic scenario trees  <cit> , which represented: live-animal imports , semen imports , embryo imports , truck visits  and hoof trimmers practicing across borders . thus, information from the five trees was combined in eq.  <dig>  as:  <dig> rimpocattle=1‐1‐panim×1‐psem×1‐pemb×1‐ptruck×1‐ptrim 

the risk  of bvdv introduction into the noimpocattle category was estimated using the same formula  without the term .

modelling the within-herd bvd dynamics to estimate the ptr values
the prevalence of antibody positive milking cows was assumed to increase over time  <cit> . the probability  of reaching the threshold prevalence  needed for bvd detection by btm testing within a fixed hrp, was estimated using a stochastic simulation model; which was previously developed to simulate within-herd bvd dynamics and to estimate the detection time in danish dairy herds, according to the elisa used on btm  <cit> .

the ptr is affected by the route of bvdv introduction to the herd , the herd size, the threshold prevalence of the antibody elisa used, and the time elapsed between bvdv introduction and day of testing . thus, the ptr was calculated as the number of model iterations out of  <dig>  where the threshold prevalence was reached, at  <dig> or 365 days after the introduction of one pi calf or one ti milking cow, into a naïve danish dairy herd. a total of  <dig> iterations appeared sufficient to simulate the within-herd disease dynamics in the study by foddai et al.  <cit> , where the model was validated using data from a recently infected danish dairy herd.

the estimation of ptr was carried out for the minimum, most common, and maximum herd size within each herd category. thereafter, the ptr values were used in the stochastic scenario tree  in a pert distribution  to represent the variability, between herds of different sizes within each risk category.

in the noimpocattle category, the herd size was minimum  <dig>  median  <dig> and maximum  <dig> cows . for the smallest herd we did not run the simulation model, because we considered the threshold prevalence as reached soon, after the first infectious animal was introduced into the herd. therefore, for this herd size we used ptr 100 %. in the impocattle category, the herd size was minimum  <dig>  median  <dig> and maximum  <dig> cows.

furthermore, in foddai et al.  <cit> , it was assumed that on average danish dairy herds have around  <dig> cows,  <dig> heifers and  <dig> calves. here, we used the same herd structure with a similar ratio of heifers/cows and calves/cows  . all other parameters were kept unchanged from foddai et al.  <cit> , e.g. we used the same values for: the bvdv transmission rates within a cattle herd , the inter-calving period, the probability of abortion, the culling rates, the dry period, the age at first calving, and the lactation length per individual cow .table  <dig> herd parameters used in the simulation model by foddai et al.  <cit> 


a the median number of cows was set according to danish data , for herds with imports of cattle  and without . according to a previous study  <cit> , usually, danish dairy herds have around  <dig> cows. in that case the number of heifers  and calves  present in the herd corresponded to  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  %  of the number of cows. we used similar  heifers/cows and calves/cows ratios in the herd sizes of the two risk categories


b unchanged from foddai et al.  <cit> 



threshold prevalence and sensitivity of the elisas used for btm testing
in a previous study  <cit> , the svanovir®bvdv-ab elisa   was shown to detect bvd by btm testing, significantly earlier than the danish blocking elisa  <cit> , which has been traditionally used in denmark. as a part of this study, we therefore wanted to evaluate the surveillance system with the two different elisas, both used to test btm samples for antibodies against bvdv.

the threshold prevalence has been estimated at 50 % for the danish blocking elisa  <cit>  and at 6 % for the svanovir elisa  <cit> . those thresholds were used in the stochastic simulation model by foddai et al.  <cit> , to estimate the ptr for each herd size .table  <dig> ptr values in herds of different size within each herd category 


ptr iterations out of  <dig> , where the threshold prevalence of antibody positive milking cows was reached in a herd, using the stochastic simulation model by foddai et al.  <cit>  and according to test used  sampling day , and bvdv introduction route 



with a cut-off blocking %  of  <dig>  the sensitivity  of the danish blocking elisa on btm is 100 %  <cit> , while for the svanovir elisa, the se has been estimated between  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %  <cit> . in the latter case, a uniform distribution ranging between those two extremes was used in the se input .

negative predictive value of the surveillance system
the scenario tree methodology  is usually used to substantiate freedom from a disease or from a pathogen  at country/area level. for that purpose, the negative predictive value  of the surveillance system is estimated to represent the confidence that a country, classified as free from a pathogen by the system, is truly free. in that case, the design prevalence  represents a hypothetical level of infection in the country. if a single positive unit is found, the country would lose the “free status”.

in our study, we estimated the npv of the surveillance system to show the pfree, but we also estimated the confidence  that the prevalence of infected herds is below the ph. in the latter case, we did not exclude that in reality few positive herds could be present in the country.

thus, to estimate plow we used the temsse based on ph =  <dig>  %, while to estimate pfree the temsse was obtained using ph =  <dig>  %. the npv of the surveillance system was:  <dig> plow=1‐priorpinf1‐priorpinf+priorpinf×1‐temsse 

where plow  is the confidence that the prevalence of infected herds was below the assumed design prevalence  <dig>  %  at the beginning of the surveillance period, since no bvd cases have been detected with the investigated hrp.

priorpinf is the probability that the country was “infected” with the assumed design prevalence, at the beginning of the surveillance period. this input was set to 50 %, which corresponds to a conservative uninformed prior  <cit> .

moreover, the priorpinf was adjusted  , by taking into account the probability of bvdv introduction from abroad :  <dig> priorpinfadj=priorpinf+pintro−priorpinf×pintro 

the annual median pintro for danish dairy herds has been estimated as  <dig>  %   <cit> . this pintro was used in eq.  <dig> as a pert distribution, for the scenarios with 365 days. with scenarios of 90 days the pintro was divided by  <dig> 

thus, plow and pfree were estimated for each infection scenario , hrp  and elisa used.

sensitivity analyses
the importance of each input parameter was investigated by using the regression mapped values in @risk and the amount of change in the output due to a plus  <dig> standard deviation for each input was estimated.

the reference scenario was defined as: all dairy herds tested with the danish blocking elisa  one year after introduction of a pi calf into a single dairy herd , since pis are the main source of bvdv spread between and within herds  <cit> .

RESULTS
output of data analysis
the imports of live animals, doses of semen, embryos, and the visits of trucks and hoof trimmers are shown per herd category in table  <dig>  the percentage of goods imported from endemic countries is also shown for each category.

in  <dig> cattle were imported to eight dairy herds, which represented the impocattle category. on the other hand, the annual quantity of imported semen and embryos, as well as the estimated numbers of trucks and hoof trimmer visits were remarkably higher for the noimpocattle category than for the impocattle category.

risk estimates per herd category
the median annual risk of bvdv introduction in the noimpocattle category  was  <dig>  % , while in the impocattle category  it was  <dig>  % .

based on those findings, the relative risk of bvdv introduction in the impocattle category  was calculated as the ratio between the two median risk estimates . thus, the rrimpocattle was simulated from a pert distribution with minimum  <dig>  mode  <dig>  and maximum  <dig> , to calculate the arrnoimpocattle  and the arrimpocattle .

ptr values according to infection scenario, herd size, hrp and elisa
the ptr values were higher: i) in small herds than in large herds, ii) for bvdv introductions through one pi calf than through one ti milking cow, and iii) with hrp of 365 days than with hrp of 90 days. moreover, the svanovir elisa had higher ptr values than the danish blocking elisa .

in the impocattle category, the ptr ranged from 0 %, e.g. when a pi calf or a ti cow was introduced into the largest herd , and the btm was tested 90 days later with the blocking elisa; to  <dig>  % when one pi calf was introduced into the smallest herd , and the btm was tested one year later with the svanovir .

in the noimpocattle category the ptr ranged from 0 %, e.g. when a pi calf or a ti cow was introduced into the largest herd , and the btm was tested 90 days later with the blocking elisa; to 100 % when one infectious animal was introduced into a herd of a single cow .

temporal sensitivity and negative predictive value of the surveillance system with ph =  <dig>  %
if bvdv was introduced into at least  <dig> dairy herds , with the danish blocking elisa , the median temsse ranged from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  %. the related median plow estimates were  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively .table  <dig> temporal surveillance sensitivity with related confidence in low herd prevalence and in freedom from disease


temsse median temporal surveillance system sensitivity, plow confidence in low herd prevalence, pfree confidence in complete freedom from bvd. estimates are reported as median % , according to elisa used , and hrp  after the introduction of  <dig> persistently infected  calf or  <dig> transiently infected  milking cow into  <dig>  or  <dig>  danish dairy herd



using the same ph, with the svanovir elisa, the median temsse ranged from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  %. the related median plow estimates were  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively .

usually, the blocking elisa gave lower temsse and plow estimates than the svanovir. for instance, when one pi calf was introduced into at least eight dairy herds and a hrp of 90 days was used, the median temsse and the plow were  <dig>  and  <dig>  percentage points  higher for the svanovir elisa .

only in the scenario where one ti cow was introduced to the herds and a hrp of 90 days was used, the median temsse and the plow were slightly higher  for the blocking elisa. with a hrp of 365 days the opposite situation was observed, and the temsse and the plow were remarkably higher for the svanovir  than for the blocking elisa .

temporal sensitivity and negative predictive value of the surveillance system with ph =  <dig>  %
if bvdv was introduced into a single dairy herd , and all danish dairy herds were tested with the blocking elisa, the median temsse ranged from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  %. the related median pfree estimates were  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively .

using the same ph, with the svanovir, the median temsse ranged from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  %, while the related pfree estimates were  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively .

also in this case, usually, the temsse and the related pfree were higher in the surveillance system based on the svanovir elisa. for instance, when one pi calf was introduced into a dairy herd and a hrp of 90 days was used, the median temsse and the pfree were  <dig>  and  <dig>  percentage points  higher for the svanovir elisa than for the blocking elisa .

output of sensitivity analysis
according to the sensitivity analysis, the input with the highest impact on the estimated temsse was the ptr distribution used in the noimpocattle category . when this input was increased with  <dig> standard deviation the temsse increased between  <dig> and  <dig>  %. the second input in order of importance was the ptr distribution used in the impocattle category . in that case, the increase caused on the temsse ranged between  <dig> and  <dig>  %. the other inputs caused a change lower than  <dig>  %.

for the pfree, the most important input was still the ptrnoimpocattle. increasing such an input with one standard deviation caused an increase in the pfree between  <dig> and  <dig>  %. the second most important input was the annual  probability of bvdv introduction  into the danish dairy population. increasing the pintro of  <dig> standard deviation caused a decrease in the pfree between  <dig> and  <dig>  %. all the other inputs caused a change lower than  <dig>  %.

discussion
a new approach – including the high risk period in the stochastic scenario tree methodology
to evaluate the bvd surveillance system in danish dairy herds, we followed the concepts from martin et al.  <cit> . additionally, we estimated the temporal surveillance system sensitivity  and the related negative predictive value , to substantiate the confidence  in complete freedom from bvd , and the confidence  in low herd prevalence .

the way we adapted the scenario tree model allowed us to estimate the temsse. thurmond  <cit>  suggested that the sensitivity for an assay should not be considered as constant, since it is affected by the different disease states. this means that the sensitivity of the test is affected by the time elapsed since a herd  became infected. in our case, the transition state herd sensitivity of the elisa used on btm, was conditioned upon the immune status of the milking herd. that status varied in time according to hrp, test used, bvdv introduction route  and herd size. uncertainty, due to all these variables was included in our temsse estimates , by using the ptr parameter  in the scenario tree , between the infection node “herd infection status” and the detection node “elisa”.

in this way, we could evaluate if the surveillance system can actually function as an early-warning system, or if optimization was needed, to increase the probability of detecting infected herds  within the aimed time period.

to our knowledge, this is the first study, where the impact of the hrp is included in the evaluation of a surveillance system using stochastic scenario trees. we believe that this approach should be considered, especially when early-warning surveillance systems are established for slowly spreading diseases, as is the case of bvd in large dairy herds after introduction of ti animals  <cit> .

temporal sensitivity and confidence in low herd prevalence 
conclusions on surveillance sensitivity and disease status at national level should be related to a specific time period, when the pathogen could have been introduced into the country. hence, in our case, the temsse and plow/pfree should be related to the period when the bvdv could have been introduced into the danish dairy herd.

between december  <dig> and december  <dig>  no dairy herds have been found positive in denmark. therefore, we can assume that very few  or no dairy herds were infected in the country at the beginning of 2012 and became btm positive. currently, there is no regulated between-herds design prevalence to substantiate bvd status at country level  <cit> . thus we considered ph =  <dig>  % as a reasonable cut-off level. such design prevalence has been set up by the oie to substantiate officially free status from ibr  <cit> , which has been eradicated from denmark  <cit> .

if bvdv was introduced by a pi calf in at least  <dig> dairy herds, the median probability of detecting at least one of these herds after one year by btm testing, would be > 95 % with both elisas. according to the european food safety authority  this could be considered as an acceptable level of confidence   <cit> . the confidence in low herd prevalence  would be high as well . this means that if the aim of the surveillance system was to substantiate on annual basis that the prevalence of herds infected by at least one pi animal is < <dig>  %, there is no need to replace the danish blocking elisa with the svanovir elisa.

on the other hand, if the objective of the surveillance system was to detect bvd by 90 days after introduction of a pi calf in  <dig>  % dairy herds, then the svanovir elisa could be preferred, because only that test showed median temsse and plow higher than 95 % . pi animals are usually considered to be the major sources of bvdv spread  <cit> , between and within cattle herds, and considering bvdv introductions by those animals could therefore be sufficient.

as we showed with the ptr values , outbreaks due to ti cows can occur with low probabilities, and if the objective of the surveillance system is to detect bvd after introduction of a ti cow in  <dig>  % dairy herds, the svanovir elisa could be used, although in that case, the median temsse and the plow would be < 95 % .

confidence in complete freedom from bvd 
with ph =  <dig>  % , the temsse and the related pfree were <95 %, with both elisas .

hence, if we apply those findings to the btm testing made in the fourth trimester of  <dig>  with the danish blocking elisa, it can be concluded that the probability of detection and the confidence in complete freedom from bvd, one year after one single herd was infected by a pi calf were very low .

however, if the svanovir elisa had been used, under the same infection and hrp scenarios, the temsse and the related pfree would have been higher than with the danish blocking elisa .

impact of herd size, hrp and elisa on the temsse and its related plow/pfree
in this study, we found that, if one ti cow was introduced to the herd and a hrp of 90 days was used, the temsse and the related plow/pfree were similar or slightly higher for the blocking elisa than for the svanovir . under the same infection scenario, when a hrp of 365 days was used, the contrary was observed. this was due to the fact that, with an hrp of 90 days, detection occurred with both tests in the noimpocattle herd with one cow . with the svanovir, the ptr was >0 % also in the impocattle herd with  <dig> cows and in the noimpocattle herd with  <dig> cows . however, the se of the svanovir elisa on btm was assumed to be lower  <cit>  than the se of the danish blocking elisa  <cit> .

thus, when 1) the herd size is very small , 2) the threshold prevalence of the test used is low, and consequently 3) the ptr is around 100 %, the temsse would become more dependent on the se of the test used on btm, than on the ptr. then there is less need to consider the threshold prevalence of the test used and the ptr parameter  could be removed. in fact, in very small herds, even a high threshold prevalence of 50 % can be reached in a short hrp with very high probability .

when the danish bvd eradication program was launched in  <dig>  the average herd size was  <dig> cows  <cit> , while currently it has increased to approximately  <dig> cows  <cit> . hence, in the ´90s detection could occur with the danish blocking elisa, even testing quarterly and especially if a pi was introduced to the herd. in the current situation, this is more difficult, since the size of danish dairy herds is continuously increasing  <cit>  and the hrp  have higher importance than in the past. thus, the ptr needs to be used in the evaluation of the current surveillance system. with larger herds, tests that can detect a lower prevalence of seropositive animals, in a short hrp and with higher ptr should be preferred. this is the case of the svanovir compared to the blocking elisa. using the former, a higher temsse would be achieved.

with those points in mind, it can also be noted that, once the threshold prevalence has been reached, increasing the btm testing frequency would increase the costs related to the higher number of samples tested, but also the probability of detection . in contrast, using a higher btm testing frequency, before the threshold prevalence is reached in the milking group, would be inefficient. in the latter case, changing the test , could increase the temsse without increasing the costs of the surveillance system .

importance of disease epidemiology and infection scenario
in this study, we showed that the temsse was higher for hrp of 365 days than for hrp of  <dig>  this was due to two main reasons: a) the longer the time an infectious animal is kept in the herd, the higher the probability that such an animal causes an outbreak with seroconversion of several milking cows, and b) within the first 90 days from bvdv introduction, no new pi calves could be born in the herd from recently infected cows .

the first observation is also valid for other diseases, while the second is peculiar to the epidemiology of bvd. in fact, pi calves are born from pi cows or from susceptible cows, which become infected within the first four months of pregnancy  <cit> . in the latter case, pi calves will be born in the herd at least 5 months after introduction of the first infectious animal , because the cattle pregnancy lasts around 280 days.

when pis are present in a herd, the immunization of other herd mates occurs quicker than when only ti animals are present  <cit> . in fact in simulation studies, it is usually assumed that the within group transmission rate of tis is approximately  <dig> times lower than in pis, and that only the latter are able to spread bvdv between animals groups   <cit> . thus, detection of bvd infected herds by btm testing becomes more likely  in the presence of pi cattle, since the number of newly infected animals per unit of time is very high.

these observations are in accordance with our results. in most of the iterations where we introduced a ti and the within herd bvdv spread was simulated, the outbreak died out, before the threshold prevalence was reached. thus, in those scenarios, the temsse was low  due to the low ptr values .

therefore, the approach proposed in this study, allowed us to evaluate the danish bvd surveillance system taking into account all the main epidemiological characteristics of the disease.

information from sensitivity analysis
in the sensitivity analysis, we confirmed that the ptr is an important parameter to consider, when the temporal sensitivity of the surveillance system is estimated.

moreover, we showed how an increase in the probability of bvdv introduction into the danish dairy population  could cause a decrease in the pfree. testing imported animals at the border, could reduce the pintro and could increase the confidence in freedom , as previously argued for bovine tuberculosis  <cit> .

limitations of the study
our estimates  could be considered as conservative, since we assumed that herds became infected by introduction of one bvdv positive animal only . in reality, more infected animals could be introduced to one herd at the same time leading to higher values of ptr and temsse.

moreover, the ptrs were estimated for three herd sizes within each herd category. a more precise modeling for all herd sizes would have required to run the simulation at least  <dig> times, to determine the ptr for each dairy herd size . because this was not feasible, to include uncertainty, we set the ptr values as pert distributions within each risk category .

in the model used for the risk assessment  <cit> , we did not include veterinarians visiting infected cattle herds abroad. this was based on interviews with farmers and vets, who stated that the veterinary equipment and medicines used in herds outside denmark were not used in danish herds  <cit> .

finally, in line with foddai et al.  <cit>  we assumed that detection by btm testing could occur when a fixed threshold prevalence of antibody positive milking cows was reached within a herd, and that, these cows had similar milk production and antibody levels in milk. in reality, this is not always the case, and thus, we used a simplification. further studies could investigate how the sensitivity of the elisa used on btm samples changes per day ), according to prevalence of seroconverted milking cows, their individual milk production and antibody titer.

CONCLUSIONS
using the svanovir elisa on btm, would increase the temporal sensitivity and the related confidence in bvd freedom , compared to the current situation, where the danish blocking elisa is used. those results could be considered to optimize the bvd surveillance system in danish dairy herds and to substantiate freedom from disease in the danish dairy population. moreover, in this study, we showed a novel idea on how to include the effect of the high risk period within the stochastic scenario tree methodology. by using this approach surveillance systems of different animal diseases could be evaluated and optimized as early warning systems.
