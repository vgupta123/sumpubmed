BACKGROUND
neuropeptides, including peptide transmitters and hormones, are a diverse group of signaling molecules involved in chemical communication among neurons and neuroendocrine regulation. neuropeptides represent by far the largest group of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators
 <cit>  and are considered the oldest neuronal signaling molecules in metazoans
 <cit> . peptidergic signaling has deep evolutionary origins: essential enzymes for proneuropeptide  processing, maturation, and secretion have even been identified in organisms without a nervous system, such as the sponge amphimedon queenslandica <cit>  and the placozoan trichoplax adhaerens <cit> .

pnps are translated as inactive precursors typically consisting of an n-terminal signal peptide  that directs the pnp to the secretory apparatus, and one or several peptide elements flanked by basic cleavage sites
 <cit> . after pnp cleavage by neuronal prohormone convertases, the liberated peptides can be further modified. c-terminal alpha-amidation and n-terminal pyroglutamination are common forms of modification
 <cit>  and can affect peptide stability
 <cit> , peptide structure
 <cit> , and bioactivity
 <cit> .

structurally and functionally important peptide elements often show sequence conservation among homologous pnps or between the mature peptides within a single pnp
 <cit> . the strongest conservation is often restricted to a few key residues that confer bioactivity to the processed peptides
 <cit> . pnps often contain spacer sequences between the conserved peptide stretches. these spacers are less conserved and therefore considered to be biologically inactive
 <cit> .

most neuropeptides signal via g-protein coupled receptors 
 <cit> . it has become clear in recent years that gpcrs and their peptide ligands are stably associated in evolution
 <cit> . this co-evolutionary relationship of peptide-ligand pairs has been exploited to establish several conserved metazoan pnp families over large evolutionary distances
 <cit> .

the classical approach to identifying novel bioactive neuropeptides was biochemical purification from the species of interest, followed by functional analysis
 <cit> . with increasing genomic and transcriptomic sampling, pnp identification has been accelerated by in silico sequence analyses based on homology to previously described pnps
 <cit> , or on the presence of sequence features such as a sp, conserved c-terminal amidated motifs  or cleavage sites
 <cit> .

mass-spectrometry  is also widely used as a powerful tool for the direct identification of bioactive peptides. this method relies on mapping the obtained peptide masses to a reference dataset , and can be impeded by the presence of extensive post-translational modifications
 <cit> . a combination of genomics and ms approaches has revealed the complete neuropeptide repertoire of several species in many metazoan phyla
 <cit> .

annelids represent a diverse and species-rich phylum and have long been used in neuroendocrinological and behavioral studies
 <cit> . comparative genomic approaches
 <cit>  and other studies identified multiple annelid pnps and neuropeptides, including rfa
 <cit> , fvria
 <cit> , excitatory peptide 
 <cit> , egg-laying hormone 
 <cit> , myomodulin
 <cit> , rgwa
 <cit> , l <dig> or elevenin
 <cit> , vasopressin
 <cit> , gonadotropin releasing hormone 
 <cit> , insulin-related peptides
 <cit> , neuropeptide y 
 <cit>  and myoinhibitory peptide 
 <cit> . despite these advances, a complete picture of annelid neuropeptide diversity is still missing.

here we describe the neuropeptide complement of the marine polychaete annelid, platynereis dumerilii, using a combination of transcriptomics, in silico pnp searches and ms-based peptide identification. platynereis has recently been established as a powerful experimental organism for comparative and experimental neurobiology
 <cit> . platynereis has a biphasic life cycle including free-swimming planktonic larval stages, followed by settlement and metamorphosis into the adult bottom-dwelling worm
 <cit> . the platynereis larval nervous system is highly peptidergic and several neuropeptides were shown to be involved in the regulation of larval behaviors such as ciliary swimming and larval settlement
 <cit> . previous studies described  <dig> platynereis pnps that are expressed in specific neuronal populations. peptides generated from these pnps include various rfa/rya related peptides
 <cit> , vasotocin/neurophysin
 <cit> , fvria
 <cit> , rgwa
 <cit> , and mip/allatostatin-b
 <cit> .

to complement this list, we used an integrative approach and identified  <dig> platynereis pnps, most of them verified by ms analysis. our pnp catalog represents the most extensive list of annelid peptides to date. this catalog will provide a valuable resource for further studies of the peptidergic control of annelid behavior and physiology, and for the reconstruction of ancient metazoan peptide signaling systems and cell types
 <cit> .

RESULTS
establishing the platynereis transcriptome, predicted proteome and secretome datasets
to identify novel pnps, we performed deep sequencing of the platynereis transcriptome using a combination of sanger, roche/ <dig> and illumina technologies. we sequenced  <dig>  expressed sequence tags  from an arrayed, full-length normalized, mixed-stages cdna library . this library was further sequenced using the roche/ <dig> technology. we also obtained illumina paired-end sequencing reads from  <dig> platynereis developmental stages including larvae, juveniles and adults. we assembled all acquired sequences into a reference transcriptome. the platynereis transcriptome dataset contains  <dig>  reads, with  <dig>  of the contigs longer than 500 bp and  <dig>  longer than 1000 bp. the transcriptome was annotated using the basic local alignment search tool  against swissprot and well-annotated bilaterian proteomes . we also searched the transcriptome for open reading frames  from which we derived a protein dataset. the predicted protein dataset contained  <dig>  sequences longer than  <dig> amino acids . to generate a platynereis dataset of secreted proteins, the predicted protein dataset was analyzed for the presence of sps
 <cit> . we identified  <dig>  protein sequences with a sp. after the in silico removal of the sp, this secreted proteome database , as well as the full predicted proteome database, were used for ms-based peptide identification.

identification of platynereis pnps
in order to identify pnps in the platynereis transcriptome and predicted proteome datasets, we performed blast searches in these datasets using a large curated set of metazoan pnp query sequences
 <cit> . we also conducted pattern searches for repetitions of the motif x-k. the resulting sequences were examined for the presence of a sp, for cleavage sites, conserved peptide motifs, and other hallmarks of bioactive peptides and their processing . these searches identified more than  <dig> platynereis pnps, including those previously described.

to complement the bioinformatics screen, and to find evidence for the presence of the predicted active peptides, we performed liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry  on peptide extracts from various platynereis larval and juvenile stages. we mapped the obtained ms hits to the platynereis datasets. using the ms analyses we discovered  <dig> further pnps that were missed during our bioinformatic searches, extending the platynereis repertoire to a total of  <dig> pnps . we also analyzed the platynereis neuropeptides for some of the most common peptide modifications and detected several modified peptides .
 <cit> . for each pnp we indicated whether a cdna clone, a full-length orf sequence, and ms evidence are available. the presence of amidated, cys-rich, or pyroglutaminated peptides, or a repetitive pnp structure, are also indicated. if a pnp family has multiple platynereis members, we also indicate the likely origin of this paralog .

all full-length platynereis pnps have a sp and at least one potential basic cleavage site, and they lack non-neuropeptide protein domains as defined in the pfam database. besides, all  <dig> pnps had to meet at least one of several criteria to be considered as bona fide prohormones. these include homology to known metazoan prohormones , a confirmed expression in platynereis neurons , ms evidence , conservation across lophotrochozoans or annelids  and other structural and functional hallmarks of a prohormone, such as a repetitive structure or peptide modifications .

overview and classification of platynereis pnp diversity
for most platynereis pnps we obtained the full-length open reading frame sequence  and for  <dig> pnps we have an available est clone or a pcr-cloned cdna. we annotated all pnp sequences with various sequence features, including the presence of a sp, cysteine-rich stretches , prohormone-convertase cleavage-sites, modified  or non-modified active peptides and the presence of a ms-hit. for all platynereis pnps containing repetitive peptides we also generated sequence logos . we classified the platynereis pnp families according to their phylogenetic distribution, distinguishing ancient eumetazoan, ancient bilaterian, and ancient protostome families, as well as annelid/lophotrochozoa specific pnps, and pnps with no currently recognizable homologs outside platynereis .

for the phylogenetic classification, we performed a sequence-similarity-based  clustering approach
 <cit> . we used a curated dataset of  <dig>  pnps from  <dig> phyla
 <cit>  combined with all platynereis pnps and their lophotrochozoan homologs collected from est databases. we clustered this dataset using psi-blast with  <dig> iterations. all platynereis pnp sequences with no similarity to known metazoan pnps were removed from the map. metazoan pnps that did not connect to any platynereis pnp were also removed  . many of the repetitive pnps formed a strongly connected cluster at the center of the map. these sequences were reanalyzed with clustering using non-iterative blast . the resulting maps were used to obtain an initial overview, which indicated a relationship of several platynereis pnps to known pnp families. the conservation of some platynereis pnps is limited to small stretches  in the precursor and is difficult to identify using blast-based clustering ). for this reason, we also performed motif searches and multiple-sequence alignments, which reinforced the family assignments, obtained by our clustering approach .
 <dig> .
 <dig> .

careful inspection of unassigned platynereis pnps for the presence of short conserved motifs using the motif discovery tool meme
 <cit>  and known peptide profiles
 <cit>  led to the assignment of further platynereis pnps to known families ; additional file
10). we also discovered several platynereis pnps that belong to newly defined lophotrochozoan and annelid pnp families .

platynereis pnps belonging to ancient eumetazoan families
several platynereis pnps belong to ancient eumetazoan families
 <cit>  such as insulin-related peptide pnps  and the glycoprotein hormones bursicon a- <dig>  a- <dig> and b .

platynereis also has three pnps that belong to the eumetazoan ra family, fmrfa, rya, and yfa . the fmrfa pnp represents the ortholog of other protostome fmrfa pnps. rya has orthologs in other lophotrochozoans, sharing a pro-rich c-terminal peptide . the platynereis yfa pnp is also part of the fmrfa cluster , however, direct orthologs of yfa pnps could not be identified outside platynereis.

a member of the eumetazoan wamide/mip/gwamide family, the platynereis mip/allatostatin-b pnp, gives rise to peptides involved in the regulation of larval settlement
 <cit> . platynereis has another related pnp, yielding non-amidated w peptides . the two trp residues that wi peptides share with mips , and the position of the wi pnp in the wamide/mip/gwamide cluster  supports a close relationship between mips and wi pnps. we only identified an orthologous wi pnp in the distantly related annelid capitella teleta, suggesting that wi pnps are annelid divergences of the mip family.

platynereis also has a pnp with a cysteine-rich prokineticin/colipase domain
 <cit> . directly after the sp, the platynereis prokineticin pnp contains amidated lfva peptides. a similar peptide could also be identified in the c. teleta prokineticin pnp .

platynereis pnps belonging to ancient bilaterian families
recent comparative genomic analyses defined more than  <dig> pnp families that are ancestral to bilaterians
 <cit> . we found platynereis representatives of most of these families that could readily be classified as one-to-one or many-to-one orthologs. these include glycoprotein hormone beta, vasotocin-neurophysin, npy, rgwa, adipokinetic hormone , gnrh, 7b <dig>  proenkephalin, dh <dig>  achatin, luqin, tachykinin, calcitonin, diuretic hormone  <dig> , pedal peptide, allatotropin, scap, sulfakinin, crustacean cardio-active peptide , allatostatin-a, allatostatin-c, sifamide, l <dig>  ep, pigment dispersing factor , and leucokinin . two of these families, calcitonin/dh <dig> and dh <dig>  show interesting gene or peptide repeat duplications in their evolutionary histories and will be discussed in detail below.

platynereis has two pnps belonging to the calcitonin/dh <dig> family, calcitonin and dh <dig>  the calcitonin pnp shows high sequence similarity to the cys-containing calcitonin peptides from vertebrates . in c. teleta, a second calcitonin-like pnp has recently been identified that is lacking the cys residues
 <cit> . we also found an orthologous platynereis sequence. these annelid pnps are more similar to insect dh <dig> pnps, also lacking the cys residues, as shown by clustering  and sequence alignments . these results suggest that the ancestral bilaterian calcitonin peptide contained two cys residues. the gene of this pnp duplicated in stem protostomes to give rise to dh <dig>  followed by the loss of the cys residues. calcitonin has been retained in mollusks and annelids, but lost from the arthropod lineage. dh <dig> was lost from mollusks, and preserved in annelids and arthropods .

we also identified two members of the corticotropin releasing factor/dh <dig> pnp family. dh <dig> has been shown to be related to mollusk egg-laying hormone 
 <cit> . we identified two pnps in platynereis that showed high sequence similarity on the level of mature peptides to mollusk elh and also to insect dh <dig>  with several highly conserved amino acid positions . the platynereis dh <dig> pnps are highly repetitive  compared to their mollusk or insect counterparts that have only one peptide copy per pnp .

platynereis pnps belonging to ancient protostome families
several members of ancient protostome pnp families are present in platynereis, including myomodulin, prohormone- <dig>  and whitnin .

the platynereis myomodulin pnp has two alternative transcripts, both yielding several peptides with an lrma c-terminus, characteristic of myomodulins . comparison of the platynereis myomodulin pnp with the c. teleta sequence revealed other highly conserved peptide-stretches, flanked by monobasic cleavage sites, which may potentially yield non-amidated peptides .

lophotrochozoan-specific pnp families
we identified various pnps belonging to lophotrochozoan pnp families including the fulicin related pnps fla and fva/eflga, nky, fvria, gnxqn, lxrx, clccy, ccwa, qsga, ccrfa, and hfaa . many of these could only be identified in annelids, mollusks, and sometimes also platyhelminths. we refer to these as lophotrochozoan families for simplicity. however, further sampling in other lophotrochozoan phyla will be needed to clarify their history.

annelid fla and fva pnps are related to mollusk fulicins, forming a lophotrochozoan pnp family. the platynereis fva mrna has an unusual structure. following the stop codon at the end of the coding region containing the fva peptides, a second putative coding region is present, potentially yielding fulicin-like eflga peptides with an extra gly residue . a similar structure has been described for the fva/eflga pnp in c. teleta <cit> . the region encoding the eflga peptides lacks a start met and a sp, therefore it is not clear whether this region could be translated to yield mature peptides. the analysis of illumina reads did not reveal any alternative transcripts with in-frame eflga peptides following a start site and a sp. the conservation of the eflga peptide-stretches across annelids  suggests that these peptides are functional. since ms evidence for eflga peptides was missing, we raised and affinity purified a specific antibody against eflga and performed immunostainings on platynereis larvae. the eflga antibody labeled two neurons in the dorsal episphere of 48 h and two pairs of neurons in 72 h larva , in the region where a subset of the precursor-expressing cells are found
 <cit> . when we pre-incubated the antibody with 5 mm eflga peptide, we no longer observed cellular staining . in agreement with previous studies
 <cit> , a cross-species reactive fva antibody
 <cit>  labeled more neurons in the larval episphere at 48 h and 72 h . eflga-positive neurons were a subset of these fva expressing neurons as confirmed by their position, cell shape, and the presence of characteristic sensory dendrites abutting the cell bodies. . these results suggest a translational stop-codon read-through mechanism
 <cit>  to yield bioactive eflga peptides, occurring in a subset of the precursor-expressing cells.

annelid- and platynereis-specific pnp families
some platynereis pnps have recognizable orthologs only in annelids, including the fvma, dla, slrfa, qeras, mnc, and leq pnps .

for several pnps we could not find orthologs outside platynereis. although we could not rely on pnp conservation as an indication of biological activity, we are confident that these pnps produce bioactive peptides. in the case of wld and spy an effect on ciliary beating has previously been established
 <cit> . other pnps harbor two or more copies of similar peptides, often confirmed by ms evidence, including higa, ngew, aynpy, ytl, pplpa, py, qpeptin, thda, fga and spra . many pnps contain peptides with hallmarks of biological activity including amidation , pyroglutamination  or various cys residues that potentially form disulfide bridges  . further sampling in annelids could lead to the identification of orthologous pnps in closely related species.

stage-specific profile of platynereis pnp expression
the platynereis transcriptome dataset was acquired from various larval, juvenile and adult stages. to profile pnp expression, we mapped the obtained stage-specific illumina paired-end reads to all pnp transcripts. the total number of pnp reads increases through larval development, peaks in 15-day-old juveniles, followed by a drop in adult stages. there are also large differences in pnp expression levels between sexually mature males and females .

we also performed a pearson-clustering of pnps based on their normalized stage-specific expression values. the platynereis pnps formed distinct clusters with expression peaking in different life cycle stages. we also found variable expression between 1-month pre- and 1-month post-cephalic-metamorphosis, and sexually mature male and female samples . for example, fmrfa, allatostatin-c and allatotropin were highly expressed in males, and lowly expressed in females.

discussion
an integrative approach to obtain the platynereis pnp repertoire
to obtain a broad complement of platynereis pnps, we used an integrative approach combining transcriptomics, peptidomics, and bioinformatics. such an integrative methodology was indispensable to extend the platynereis pnp repertoire to  <dig> sequences.

in particular, ms analysis was often necessary to reveal pnps with more restricted phyletic distribution, lower sequence conservation, or non-repetitive precursor structure. for example, in the gya and sll pnps only one short potential bioactive peptide occurs in the precursor sequence. moreover, ms evidences combined with the conservation of the peptide in orthologous annelid and mollusk pnps allowed us to conclude that these sequences represent bona fide pnps with likely biological activity .

expression profiling of platynereis pnps
the transcriptional profiling of pnp expression throughout the life cycle revealed that most of the pnps are expressed at multiple stages. this indicates that the platynereis nervous system is strongly peptidergic throughout the life cycle. the broad temporal expression of most pnps also suggests that several of the platynereis neuropeptides have pleiotropic functions. for example, we have recently shown that  <dig> different neuropeptides affect ciliary swimming and larval settlement in early larval stages
 <cit> . since larvae settle after a brief planktonic stage  and locomotor cilia disappear after cephalic metamorphosis , the later expression of these peptides implies functions unrelated to ciliary swimming. the other specific differences we uncovered between different stages may be related to changing physiology . the differences between males and females indicate the presence of sex-specific neuroendocrine regulation potentially related to sex-specific physiology or behavior .

platynereis, a powerful marine invertebrate model for studying the function of ancient peptidergic signaling
nervous systems evolved in a marine environment. consequently, comparative studies of neuropeptide signaling in bilaterians would benefit from marine models with a rich set of conserved pnps. among the lophotrochozoans, a predominantly marine super-phylum, there are many emerging model species
 <cit> . however, few studies used a comprehensive approach to identify pnps in lophotrochozoans
 <cit> . a recent study in the freshwater planarian schmidtea meditterranea established the first broad pnp resource in a lophotrochozoan
 <cit> . compared to s. meditterranea, platynereis has a richer repertoire of conserved pnps. for example, s. meditterranea has no recognizable orthologs of achatin, luqin, akh, allatotropin, ccap, pdf, leucokinin, tachykinin, proenkephalin and whitnin
 <cit> , all present in platynereis. previous studies also highlight the potential of platynereis as a powerful lophotrochozoan model for studying neuropeptides. peptide functions can be easily investigated in platynereis larvae by bath application of synthetic neuropeptides
 <cit> . recent technical advances now allow various genetic and other manipulations of peptidergic systems. for example, laser nanosurgery
 <cit> , transgenesis
 <cit> , morpholino-mediated gene knockdown
 <cit> , cellular resolution rna in situ hybridization
 <cit> , complete neuronal reconstruction from tem sections
 <cit> , and whole-body gene expression pattern registration
 <cit>  can be applied to explore the function of peptidergic systems in platynereis.

CONCLUSIONS
here we used an integrative approach, combining transcriptomics, peptidomics and sequence homology searches, to obtain a broad pnp complement for the model annelid platynereis dumerilii. using homology-based sequence clustering and a comprehensive set of multiple sequence alignments and peptide-motif screens, we classified many platynereis pnps into conserved families. this work will serve as the foundation for further research of neuropeptide functions in platynereis and for the study of conserved bilaterian peptidergic cells. our pnp catalog will also provide a useful resource for the identification of pnps in other annelids and mollusks , as well as understudied non-model marine invertebrates .
