BACKGROUND
transcriptional regulation plays an important role in the evolution of many phenotypes, especially when the phenotype correlates with expression level of a particular key gene. transcriptional regulation is mostly controlled at the level of transcriptional initiation, i.e. the recruitment of transcription factors which determine the stability of the rna polymerase ii holoenzyme complex and hence the frequency of transcription initiation. due to the modularity of transcription factor binding site clusters and the lack of reading frame constraint, promoters are more evolvable than coding regions  <cit> . a few point mutations in a cis-regulatory region can already confer functionally different phenotypes, even when the pattern does not deviate from neutral expectations <cit> . some examples of variation in regulatory loci conferring adaptive phenotypes are: the ldhb promoter of fundulus heteroclitus  <cit> , the hsp70ba promoter of drosophila melanogaster  <cit>  the chalcone synthase promoter of arabidopsis thaliana  <cit>  and the cyp6g <dig> promoter of drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . in this paper we focus on transcriptional regulation of the orchesella cincta metallothionein gene , which is assumed to be involved in heavy metal tolerance.

metallothioneins are low molecular weight metal-binding proteins with a high content of conserved cysteines within certain phylogenetic lineages and a lack of aromatic amino acids and histidine  <cit> , although some invertebrate metallothioneins deviate from this pattern  <cit> . metallothioneins are involved in essential metal homeostasis, metal detoxification, free radical scavenging, cell proliferation and apoptosis processes  <cit> . they are induced by several chemical and physical stresses  <cit> , including free metal ions, altered redox status, oxidative stress and heat shock. the orchesella cincta metallothionein   <cit>  has a molecular weight of  <dig> kda and consists of  <dig> amino acids. almost all of the body burden of cd is located in the gut epithelium and a major part of it is bound to mt  <cit> . it is suggested that the excretion of cd from the animal occurs by a molting cycle regulated apoptotic process, by which the cd-loaded midgut epithelium is shed  <cit> . higher constitutive  <cit>  and cadmium inducible  <cit> mt mrna levels have been observed in populations from heavy metal contaminated sites, compared to populations from reference sites. parent-offspring comparisons showed that cd-induced expression of mt  is a heritable trait. differences between expression level classes were linked to rflp patterns of the pmt locus  <cit> . although certain alleles of the mt coding sequence are linked to heavy metal pollution of the soil  <cit> , it is rather unlikely that the heavy metal tolerance can be attributed to a single gene  <cit> .

inherited heavy metal tolerance has been associated with duplication events  <cit>  and polymorphisms in the metallothionein coding sequence  <cit>  the regulation of mt biosynthesis is mainly transcriptional and depends for the most part on cis-acting regulatory elements, such as the metal responsive element  which binds metal responsive transcription factor- <dig> , a zn-finger protein, and the anti-oxidant responsive element  which recruits the nuclear erythroid derived related factor- <dig> , a protein of the b-zip leucine zipper family  <cit> . however, this situation can not be generalized for all invertebrate phyla  <cit>  therefore, the induction of metallothionein can be considered as a concerted action of general, metal-specific and oxidative stress specific transcription factors.

in the past decades several studies on metallothionein promoters of invertebrates have been performed  <cit> , although most mechanistic studies have been done on vertebrate model organisms, reviewed by  <cit> . one way to study the functionality of promoters is to fuse them to a quantitative reporter gene and analyze the induction in vitro in a host cell line. the comparison of allelic polymorphism in promoters by reporter assays has mainly been applied in medical biology, e.g.  <cit> . only few studies in evolutionary ecology have compared alleles in this functional approach  <cit>  and only one study compared the metal inducibility of metallothionein promoter alleles  <cit> .

in the present study natural occurring allelic variation of the orchesella cincta metallothionein promoter  is described. following discovery of extensive variation in promoter sequence we formulated the following research question: "are the pmt alleles observed in natural populations differentially induced by cd, paraquat and 20-hydroxyecdysone  and can their induction be related to their different architecture?" luciferase constructs were made and tested in an arthropod cell line for dose-dependent inducibilities. paraquat is included in the experiment, because it generates reactive oxygen species in the electron transport chain  <cit>  causing oxidative stress. this approach allows us to discriminate between the effects of cd and oxidative stress separately. finally, we tested if the pmt allele frequency distribution, based on nucleotide diversity measures, deviated from neutrality in a tolerant and sensitive population.

RESULTS
general architecture of the pmt locus
nine different alleles were identified in an alignment of  <dig>  <dig> bp promoter sequences . the consensus sequences of the respective alleles and the o. villosa were submitted to genbank . the general architecture of the nine promoter alleles is shown in fig.  <dig>  which also indicates positions of putative core promoter elements and transcription factor binding sites  <cit> . the number of the putative tfbs is summarized in table  <dig> for each allele. the basal promoter consists of an initiator  consensus with an overlap of a 20-hydroxyecdysone responsive element . the pmta allele contains two extra putative initiators. all the alleles, except pmtc, have a downstream promoter element  consensus downstream of their inr. all pmt alleles contain mres, which are all orientated in the sense direction. the proximal promoter, about  <dig> bp 5' from the inr, contains most of the mres. the alleles pmta <dig>  pmta <dig>  pmtb, pmtd <dig>  pmtd <dig> and pmtbal have five mres in this region, named mre-a to mre-e. a number of indels in this mre-rich region make this region variable. the mre-a was apparently lost from the pmtc allele by a  <dig> bp deletion. a  <dig> bp deletion 5' of the mre-b, relative to pmtc, pmtd <dig>  pmtd <dig> and pmtbal, characterizes pmta, pmtb, pmte and pmtf. this deletion affects the spatial position of the mres. the pmtc and pmtf alleles have a point mutation which disrupts the consensus mre sequence of mre-d and mre-e respectively. the pmtd <dig> and pmtd <dig> alleles share a here between mre-a and mre-b, by one point mutation. an ap- <dig> binding site consensus was only retrieved in the forward pcr primer d1-36f, and is not further discussed. this primer was developed after genome walking resulting in a clone that was apparently pmta <dig>  all alleles, except pmtc share a dna replication-related element   <cit> .

a putative enhancer, ±  <dig> bp upstream from the inr , contains another mre  and an anti-oxidant responsive element . within this enhancer and towards the proximal promoter a number of heres and c/ebp  binding sites are found scattered, which differ in number and position between the respective alleles. the  <dig> bp indel in the pmtbal allele is delineated at its edges  by two c/ebp binding sites. furthermore this insertion contains  <dig> are,  <dig> heres and another c/ebp binding site.

similarities among pmt alleles and recombinant analyses
the phi test for recombination in the splitstree <dig> program  <cit>  found statistically significant evidence for recombination . a bootstrap confidence network  <cit>  based on a split decomposition analysis was developed representing the inferred recombination events in the pmt locus . split decomposition analysis addresses the problem of conflicting phylogenetic signals due to recombination which is not necessarily a branching or tree-like process. parallel edges in the network represent evolutionary lineages of conflicting bifurcating trees. the parallel edges are presented in different colors in order to relate the events to results of the analysis below. the  <dig> bp indel from the pmtbal allele was omitted from these analyses. the evolution of the apparently ancestral alleles, pmtbal, pmtc and pmtf, can be interpreted in a bifurcating pattern, whereas the more recent alleles pmte, pmtd <dig>  pmtd <dig>  pmtb, pmta <dig> and pmta <dig> are consistent with a reticulate origin. the recombination analysis is presented in fig.  <dig>  data below a bootscan threshold of 70% were omitted from the graphs. breakpoints with their respective p-values from the recco analysis, are plotted in the same graphs as a matter of convenience.

the pmta <dig> and pmta <dig> alleles consists of a ±  <dig> bp upstream block shared with pmtd <dig> and a ±  <dig> bp block shared with pmtb confirmed by very high bootstrap values. in between a slight similarity with pmte was found. recco confirmed this bootscan analysis and found a recombination breakpoint between the two dominant blocks. allele pmtb contains a ±  <dig> bp upstream block related to pmtc and the ±  <dig> bp downstream block shared with pmta as mentioned before. both regions had recombination breakpoints at their respective 3' and 5' edges. the central part of the pmtb allele shares limited similarity with pmtd <dig>  the pmtc allele has the shared ±  <dig> bp block with pmtb and a block shared with pmte at the outer 3' end of the locus , both confirmed by the recco method, although not visible in the reticulate network. in between the two blocks bootscan analysis identified similarity with pmtbal. numerous recombination breakpoints were detected in this region, suggesting that this allele contains a recombination hotspot. the pmtd <dig> situation is very clearcut. this allele contains the ±  <dig> bp block shared with pmta and a ±  <dig> bp 3' block shared with pmtd <dig>  confirmed by the recco method. both regions have numerous putative recombination breakpoints at their edges. the pmtd <dig> allele shares a ±  <dig> bp upstream block with pmte and the downstream block with pmtd <dig> mentioned before, confirmed by the recco method. in between the respective blocks a smaller ±  <dig> bp block similar to pmtb, surrounded by recombination breakpoints, was found. the pmtf allele has a ±  <dig> bp upstream block shared with pmtbal immediately followed by a very small block shared with pmtb. only the former block was confirmed by recco. the pmtbal situation was rather contradictory, although some recombination breakpoints provided by recco confirmed the bootscan similarity profile with pmtf. the limited similarity with pmtc was not supported by recco. pmte consists of the clear cut upstream ±  <dig> bp block shared with pmtd <dig> and the shared second exon with pmtc. on the other hand, the central part showed some above threshold similarity with pmta <dig>  again numerous putative recombination breakpoints, at the edges of some shared blocks, were detected by recco.

the deep trenches in the respective recombined blocks represent conserved modules, e.g. the one at position ±  <dig> bp is the region containing the are and the distant mre.

functional analysis
the functional significance of pmt variation was assessed by evaluating the effect of the different promoters on gene expression. luciferase reporter assays of pgl3-pmt constructs were performed in drosophila s <dig> cell line. no induction of the empty vector pgl3basic neither the normalization vector pac <dig> /v5-his/lacz was observed , implying that the observed induction of the pgl3-pmt constructs are exclusively due to the interaction of the transcription factors from the host cells with the mt promoters in the luciferase constructs. as a positive control for ecdysone treatment the 20-e exposure was also performed on cells transfected with the construct pecrhspluc  <cit> , a highly 20-e inducible luciferase construct . indeed, a high induction level was observed, comparable to poels et al   <cit> .

basal luciferase expression data are presented in fig.  <dig>  highly significant differences in basal expression were detected between the luciferase constructs from the different alleles, following a one way anova test, with the tukey hsd post-hoc test. the basal expression from the pmtcluc construct hardly deviated from the empty vector pgl3basic  and was an order of magnitude lower than the basal expression values of the other constructs. the pmtd1luc had a higher basal expression than the pmta <dig>  pmtf and the pmtc constructs.

the dose response graphs from the cd, paraquat and 20-e exposures and their estimated parameters are given in figs.  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively . it appeared that all constructs were susceptible to cd. the rlumax estimates of pmtd2luc and pmtfluc cd exposures did not differ and were the highest observed. exposure of the other constructs to cd resulted in significantly different rlumax values. the pmtcluc constructs, with the lowest rlumax were the least inducible. the slope of pmtd2luc in the cd exposure was steeper than pmtbluc and pmtfluc, implying a quicker inducibility. the most sensitive construct to induction by cd, represented by the lowest ec <dig>  was pmta1luc. it differed significantly from the least sensitive constructs pmtbluc, pmtd2luc and pmtfluc.

the pmtcluc construct did not show a significant pearson correlation with paraquat concentration  and no model fit was possible. no significant differences in the estimated parameters of the paraquat exposure were found in the responses of the inducible constructs. the 20-e exposure data revealed an inhibition of every construct. the estimated values for the parameters were abandoned, because of the wide associated 95% confidence intervals, therefore only the estimates for the rlumin value are represented. it appeared that the pmtbluc construct was the least inhibited at the maximum exposure concentrations of  <dig>  mm 20-e, compared to the other constructs.

at the lower range of the 20-e exposure a slight induction was observed in all constructs. we tested the rlu estimated from the inducing concentration range relativeto the unexposed control in a one way anova approach . the pmtbluc and pmtd2luc constructs were both significantly induced at respectively  <dig>  nm and  <dig> nm 20-e exposure.

allele frequencies in field populations
the occurrence of the pmt alleles was assessed in o. cincta populations from a clean reference site  and a metal-polluted site . these data are summarized in table  <dig>  together with information on soil metal concentrations and several indices of cd tolerance in the two populations obtained from earlier work . the insert of the pmtbal allele is omitted from this analysis.

total cadmium  content of the soil; allele frequencies of the pmt alleles; s, total number of variable  sites; η, total number of mutations; hd, haplotype diversity ± sd; π, nucleotide diversity per site ± sd; tajima's d, fu and li's d and fu and li's d*, mean normalized expression, p-value of the g-test performed on the reconstituted dataset , mne, mean normalized expression at mrna level; cd excretion efficiency; percentage of cd-induced growth reduction.

pollution by heavy metals in the abandoned pb-zn mine of plombières dates back to the middle ages and has proceeded until the beginning of the 20th century  <cit> . this is reflected by the almost 200-fold higher total cd content of this soil compared to the clean site in roggebotzand. this latter site is located on reclaimed land, which fell dry in  <dig>  a g-test for differences of allele frequencies between both populations was highly significant . the frequencies of pmta <dig> and pmta <dig> are relatively low in the population from the mining site plombières, while the pmtc, pmtb and pmtd <dig> alleles are more represented compared to the situation in the reference roggebotzand population. in addition, a higher nucleotide, haplotype and nucleotide diversity was observed in the plombières population. when calculating the tajima's d test, no deviation from neutral expectations was observed. the fu and li's tests, on the other hand, did show a significant departure from neutrality in the plombières population, both with and without taking the out-group into account . positive values of d and d* suggest the presence of an excess of intermediate frequency variants in the sample, which means that balancing selection is acting. when we calculated the fu and li's d in a sliding window approach, the promoter stretches on which balancing selection is taking place can be identified . the spectrum of fu and li's d is aligned to a graph of the general architecture of the pmt locus. non-significant, but negative d values are observed in the vicinity of the putative enhancer. this suggests that this stretch is under positive selection. truly significant deviations from neutrality, with positive d values, are detected in the region between the two c/ebp binding sites, upstream from the dre and in the vicinity of the mre-d and mre-e.

discussion
from our data we have very good evidence that allelic diversity at the pmt locus has evolved by extensive recombination events, although we do not have knowledge about the genetic mechanism, e.g. crossing-over or gene conversion. the patterns in the splits decomposition network could somehow be linked to the results of the recombination analysis. the most important recombination blocks, which became evident in the bootscanning and recco methods, were visible in the network. especially the more recent alleles, pmta <dig>  pmtb, pmtd <dig>  pmtd <dig> and pmte revealed clear-cut signals of recombination among each other. recombination between the older alleles, pmtbal, pmtf and pmtc, were not detected at all in the recco and the splitstree method reasons for this could be that the parental alleles were not sampled or that former recombination events could be hidden behind the mutational load. because the recco method takes the minimization of recombination and mutation costs into account, instead of the tree-like model in the bootscanning approach, it detects recombination false positives to a lesser extent  <cit> . the absence of reticulations in the edges of these alleles in the 95% confidence reticulate network, points towards less conflicting bifurcations . these may be caused by the accumulation of mutations following past recombination events.

the numerous recombination breakpoints at the pmt locus can be explained by the fact that transcriptionally active chromatin with recruited transcription factors is hypersensitive to recombination initiation  <cit> . not transcription in se but the recruitment of recombination machinery by environmentally activated transcription factors following chromatin remodeling causes recombination events. for example, in fission yeast, phosphorylation by the stress-activated protein kinase from the mapk pathway increases the affinity of the transcription factor atf <dig>  pcr <dig> for a camp-responsive element-like  dna sequence and remodels the chromatin  <cit> . this process and the respective cre-like sequence are associated with a recombination hotspot in fission yeast  <cit> . in every pmt allele two cre core sequences, cgtca  <cit>  were found. because of the importance of the composition of the flanking sequences of the cre core sequence and the large number of creb proteins, these data are not further discussed, although it may be of importance for transcriptional regulation and initiation of recombination at the orchesella cincta pmt locus.

the  <dig> bp insertion in the pmtbal allele, which does contain some relevant putative transcription factor binding sites, is suggested to be a possibly recombined or duplicated region from another promoter. similar events, where promoter regions were swapped between loci, have been described before  <cit> .

the number of mres in stress gene promoters in general  <cit>  and metallothionein promoters in particular varies extensively. the same applies to their sequence and their spatial context. however, three mre's  were conserved in sequence  between o. cincta and the out-group species o. villosa. previous studies revealed that the proximal mre cluster in metal-responsive promoters is necessary  <cit>  and mres in the proximal promoter region need to work cooperatively for the full inductive capacity  <cit> . the most proximal mre to the transcription start , has been shown to be most contributing to induction by zn and cd of the human hmt-iia promoter  <cit>  and cooperates with more upstream mres for the complete heavy metal induction  <cit> .

the induction by paraquat was several orders of magnitude lower than the induction by cd, which possibly reflects that not all the mres are involved. in a study by  <cit>  three different oxidative stressors elicited a twofold response of the rainbow trout mt-b promoter luciferase constructs, comparable to our study with paraquat. beside the are and the mre-a it was suggested that are half-sites  are as well responsible for oxidative stress inducibility  <cit> .

the reporter assays show that allele c is hardly inducible by cd and oxidative stress  and shows no basal transcription level above background . this may be explained by the deletion of the mre-a in this allele as follows. during exposure to cd and paraquat, trans-activation in non-mammalian metallothionein promoters can occur by interaction of an enhancer  with the mre-a and other proximal mres  <cit> . the induction of pmtc by cd is low and completely abolished by paraquat possibly due to the incapability of trans-activation between the mre-a  and the distal enhancer, directly or in combination with ccaat/enhancer binding proteins  <cit> . binding sites for ccaat/enhancer binding proteins were detected in all alleles of the pmt locus. also, the mre-a is often important in determining basal expression levels  <cit> . deletion of mre-a in pmt c can therefore explain the low basal expression of this allele. finally the importance of mre-a is reflected in the highly conserved core sequence: o. cincta mre-a has the same core sequence as onchorhynchus mykiss, strongylocentrotus purpuratus and drosophila metallothionein promoters.

there may be an alternative explanation for the very low basal expression levels of pmtc as well as low stress induction, related to the absence of dre. the dre  <cit>  is an element found in dna replication related genes, as well as in stress responsive genes . this element coordinates the cell cycle specific expression of metallothionein. since pmtc lacks this element  it may contribute to the low inducibility and basal expression.

we realize that we tested o. cincta derived promoters in a drosophila genetic background. thus, the observed levels may not reflect the levels in vivo due to absence of o. cincta specific transcription factors or altered binding specificity of drosophila transcription factors to o. cincta specific transcription factor binding sites. reporter assays are sometimes unable to generate the tissue, temporal and species specific transcriptional regulation  <cit> . for instance, aberrant expression levels have been observed when expression levels of  <dig> orthologous genes of human and chimpanzee were compared in cell lines from different human tissue origin  <cit>  when compared to their in vivo expression levels. in contrast with that, crawford et al  <cit>  obtained consistent results using two unrelated fish cell lines  to study transcriptional activity of killifish lactate dehydrogenase-b promoters.

the general pattern of 20-e exposure is the inhibition of the metallothionein promoter. this probably occurs because of the overlapping here and inr. the moderate inducibility of pmtb and pmtd <dig>  at respectively  <dig>  and  <dig> nm 20-e, can not be explained straightforward, although pmtd <dig> has a larger number of heres . the spatial and sequence context could be the reason for their inducibility. in the firebrat thermobia domestica 20-e equivalents peak to  <dig> μm during apolysis  <cit>  falling back to the basal concentration of  <dig> nm, indicating that the order of magnitude of our exposure range was well within the physiologically relevant range. these data suggest that the metallothionein expression is switched off during ecdysone-induced apoptosis of the gut epithelium, when the onset of new cuticle formation is set.

our small-scale population genetic comparison between populations from the clean site in roggebotzand and the polluted one in plombières reflected a positive sign of balancing selection at plombières, because of the significant positive fu and li's d values, higher nucleotide diversity per site, and higher haplotype diversity in the latter population. a study by timmermans et al.  <cit>  revealed selection on certain alleles of the o. cincta mt coding sequence by heavy metal content in the soil. however, no signatures of any selection were detected in the amino acid sequence  or in the nucleotide composition . the population at plombières is characterized by relatively high frequencies of pmtd <dig> and pmtb, which is in accordance with their greater inducibility compared to the most common pmta <dig> allele. this suggests a fitness advantage to phenotypes with high metallothionein expression at polluted sites  <cit> . on the other hand, the plombières population also has a relatively high frequency of the less responsive pmtc allele, this is consistent with the signature of balancing selection detected by fu and li's d values and can be understood if there are not only advantages in terms of metal tolerance but also fitness costs associated with high mt expression. further work is necessary to elucidate the precise relationship between fitness and pmt genotype.

CONCLUSIONS
the orchesella cincta metallothionein promoter contains a high degree of polymorphism, reflected in the different number and spacing of consensus transcription factor binding sites involved in relevant regulatory processes, such as heavy metal, oxidative stress induction and the regulation by the molting cycle.

in general, the evolution of transcriptional regulation can occur by stabilizing selection by which erosive mutations in tfbs and the emergence of new ones are compensating each other. evolution due to transcriptional regulation has been reported in macro-evolutionary processes, e.g. the even-skipped- <dig> enhancer of drosophila species  <cit> . alternatively, micro-evolutionary processes rather occur by point mutations in  tfbs  <cit> . here, we provide evidence of extensive recombination, reshuffling the nucleotide variation of insertion, deletions and point mutations in the micro-evolution of a regulatory locus.

since induction of metallothionein is suggested to be associated with a metal-tolerant phenotype  <cit>  the difference in inducibility between the pmt alleles provides a scope for natural selection in field populations. the deviations from neutral expectations in the cadmium tolerant population from plombières support this suggestion. future approaches will be the detection of dna-binding activity of selected transcription factors, measure the in vivo transcription by real-time q-pcr, and screen field populations for their respective pmt allele frequencies.
