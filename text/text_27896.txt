BACKGROUND
trypanosoma brucei infects a wide range of larger mammals across sub-saharan africa. t. brucei and some other species of the african trypanosomes have evolved a population survival strategy in the mammalian host based on the generation and clonal expansion of new antigenic variants at a rate fast enough to prevent recognition of the whole population by the host immune response. most indigenous wild host species are tolerant to trypanosome infections exhibiting low parasitaemias with limited display of patent symptoms  <cit> . similar tolerance has been selected for in some indigenous breeds of cattle  <cit>  although infection reduces productivity  <cit> . in contrast, indigenous breeds of cattle from outside the range of the tsetse fly  and introduced animals such as western european dairy breeds, horses and dogs, are susceptible and can have severe clinical symptoms  <cit> . although t. brucei can both establish and maintain an infection in a mammalian host, it is unclear whether an infection acquired early in life persists for the lifetime of the host, say  <dig> to  <dig> years, or whether the host is repeatedly superinfected by an increasing number of strains as a result of constant exposure to infected tsetse flies.

antigenic variation in trypanosomes is dependent on a protective protein coat that covers the entire surface of the trypanosome  <cit> . the coat is composed of a single protein, the variant surface glycoprotein , that protects the plasma membrane from complement and invariant cell surface proteins from recognition by host immunoglobulins  <cit> . an infecting population expresses a series of vsgs from a large reservoir of vsg sequences in the genome  <cit> . different vsgs are antigenically distinct due to extreme variation in sequence but have a conserved structure, presumably necessary for their function as a protective barrier  <cit> . t. brucei vsgs are composed of a combination of one n-terminal domain of ~ <dig> residues and one or two c-terminal domains of  <dig> to  <dig> residues each  <cit> . the n-terminal domains have been categorized into three types, a, b and c, according to two features of the primary structure: the location of conserved cysteine residues and the presence of a heptad repeat in a region known to form a coiled coil  <cit> . the c-terminal domains have been divided into six types,  <dig> to  <dig>  based on the location of conserved cysteine residues and the sequence of the c-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor addition signal  <cit> . there appears to be no restriction on domain combinations and similar n-terminal domains have been found with different c-terminal domains  <cit> .

the structure of the genomic reservoir of vsgs was determined as part of the genome project  <cit> . there are between  <dig> and  <dig> potential vsg sequences in the genome; however, only  <dig> % encode functional vsg open reading frames  and of the remainder  <dig> % encode an orf for a vsg with atypical primary structure;  <dig> % are disrupted vsg orfs containing frame shifts and/or stop codons and the remainder are fragmentary vsg orfs. around  <dig> % of the vsg sequences lie at telomeres of large, intermediate and mini-chromosomes but the majority are present in subtelomeric tandem arrays  <cit>  the telomeric vsg genes are under represented in the genome sequence and the final percentage encoding functional vsg genes will probably increase to  <dig> to  <dig> % as telomeres are sequenced. the genome is diploid with the exception of the sub-telomeric and telomeric vsg sequence arrays which differ between homologous chromosomes to such a great extent that the arrays are effectively haploid  <cit> .

the rate of switching expression from one vsg to another is <  <dig>  per cell generation, and so most trypanosomes are eventually cleared by the host immune system as they do not switch vsgs  <cit> . however, the rate of switching is high enough to maintain the infection provided the reservoir of immunologically novel vsgs is not exhausted. thus, the long term persistence of an infection will be dependent on the size of the utilisable vsg reservoir. given the large number of potential vsg sequence donors in the genome  <cit> , the potential number of different vsgs may be thousands. more than  <dig> vsgs were serially expressed by a single t. brucei clone  <cit> . the only reported experiment to address exhaustion of the vsg repertoire used the related species t. vivax and found that clonally infected goats eventually self cured after one to two years  <cit> .

some vsgs are present in the genome as multiple copy families of closely related sequences  <cit> . however, the majority of genomic vsg sequences are single copy genes distantly related to other vsgs  <cit> . it is not known whether vsg sequence repertoires are expanding and/or diverging. here, an analysis of eighteen expressed vsg genes is presented. the vsgs are all derived from field samples of t. brucei collected in the tororo district of uganda. the vsgs contain the same primary structural features as found in previously characterised vsgs. close homologues of fourteen of the vsgs are present in the genome sequence of t. b. brucei treu <dig> isolated in kiboko, kenya and equally close homologues of fourteen are present in the genome sequence of t. b. gambiense dal <dig> isolated in daloa, côte d'ivoire, west africa. comparisons of three homologues from each of the isolates showed that sequence divergence between homologous vsgs is concentrated in regions of the gene encoding the part of the n-terminal domain involved in direct interactions with host immune system.

RESULTS
eighteen novel vsg cdna sequences were obtained from eight field isolates from zebu cattle or pigs; twelve were trypanosoma brucei brucei and six were the human-infective t. b. rhodesiense. all the isolates were originally collected in the tororo district of uganda in an area where t. b. rhodesiense is endemic and hundreds of kilometers from the region where the second human infective subspecies t. b. gambiense is endemic in north west uganda  <cit>  . the identifiers and database accession numbers for each of the vsgs described in this paper are given in table  <dig> 

most of the vsgs expressed by field isolates are present in the genome sequences of both t. brucei brucei treu <dig> and t. brucei gambiense dal <dig>  the table shows the name of the vsg from the tororo district, whether it is from t. b. brucei  or t. b. rhodesiense  and the domain type combination. the most similar vsg in the genome sequences of t. b. brucei treu <dig> and t. b. gambiense dal <dig> is then given, the cut off for inclusion was sequence identity of >  <dig> % over the whole of the vsg. in some cases the sequence was from manual assembly of individual sequencing runs into contigs and these are available in the supplementary material and are marked h after the identifier. the 'intact vsg' column indicates whether the vsg sequences in the genome encode a potentially functional vsg orf . the 'database entry complete' column indicates whether the sequence contig or sequence read spanned the entire potential orf. the endpoints of identity column indicates where, within the vsg amino acid sequence, the high percentage identity ended: ss, n-terminal signal sequence; hinge, linker between the two domains; ctd, c-terminal domain.

the field isolate vsgs have typical domain structures
the tororo vsgs was analysed to determine which n-terminal and c-terminal domain types they contained. the identification of domain types was based on the location of conserved cysteine residues  <cit> . all the vsgs from tororo contained a typical vsg domain structure and fell within previously characterized vsg types. n-terminal domain types a and b and c-terminal domain types  <dig> and  <dig> predominated . the same is true for the collection of expressed vsgs previously sequenced, for example  <cit> , and for the vsg sequences present in the t. b. brucei treu <dig> genome  <cit> . thus, the tororo vsgs have typical vsg primary structures.

close homologues of the tororo vsgs are present in both east and west african t. brucei genomes
the degree to which t. brucei isolates from different geographic regions share a common vsg repertoire is not known. the tororo vsg sequences were used to identify any homologues in the genome sequences of t. b. brucei treu <dig>   <cit> , isolated from a tsetse fly in kiboko, kenya  <cit>  and the unfinished genome sequence of t. b. gambiense dal <dig> clone  <dig> mhom/ci/86/dal <dig>  isolated in daloa, côte d'ivoire, west africa  <cit>  . for t. b. brucei treu <dig>  the chromosome assemblies, genome survey sequence assemblies and individual sequence reads were screened and for t. b. gambiense dal <dig>  both contigs and individual sequence reads were screened.

'closely related' was arbitrarily defined as two vsg homologues having greater than  <dig> % amino acid sequence identity. seventeen out of eighteen tororo vsg had a closely related vsg sequence in either one or both of the tbb <dig> or tbgdal genome sequences; fourteen in the tbb <dig> genome and fourteen in the tbgdal genome . the twenty eight vsg sequences identified in the two genome sequences were examined. in all but one case the genomic copy encoded an incomplete vsg open reading frame , either with a frame shift, and/or a premature stop codon and/or the absence of a contiguously encoded c-terminal domain. the small number of intact vsg orfs  is a reflection of the low percentage of intact vsg orfs in the tbb <dig> genome  <cit> . the tororo vsgs had a single closely related homologue in the tbb <dig> or tbgdal genome sequences and were not part of a large vsg multigene family, the next closest homologue having less than  <dig> % amino acid sequence identity. there was one possible exception that was difficult to analyse due to partial sequence in the genome database . this result was unexpected as although  <dig> % of vsgs are single copy genes families the remaining  <dig> % are members of multigene families  <cit>  . the tororo vsgs were represented in each of the two genome sequence databases at a frequency of  <dig> % . this provides an indication that the genome of the tororo isolates contains many vsg genes in common with the both the tbb <dig> and tbgdal genomes. using a chi squared test there is a  <dig> % probability that the tororo isolates and each of the genome strains have greater than  <dig> % of vsg genes in common. thus, the vsg repertoires of the tororo isolates and each of the tbb <dig> and tbgdal genomes are probably largely common.

of the twenty eight genomic vsg sequences, two from tbb <dig> and four from tbgdal were incomplete as the end of the available genomic sequence  fell within the homologous tororo vsg orf . the remaining twenty two genomic vsg sequences were used to investigate the extent of the sequence identity with the tororo vsgs. an end point of sequence identity was apparent as a sudden decrease in sequence identity to background levels. in all cases , the identity extended for the entire region encoding the mature vsg n-terminal domain. in the majority , the 5' endpoint of identity occurred outside the vsg orf and in the remainder  the sequence identity ended within the region encoding the n-terminal signal sequence. the 3' endpoint of sequence identity usually occurred within the region encoding the c-terminal domain , occasionally in the hinge between the two domains  or outside the region encoding the orf . thus, the genomic vsg sequences shared identity with the expressed vsgs over a region encoding the entire n-terminal domain but in nearly all cases this did not extend to include the complete c-terminal domain.

the ugandan tororo vsgs have diverged to a similar extent from the vsgs present in the east african t. b. brucei treu <dig> and west african t. b. gambiense dal <dig> genomes
the amino acid sequences of the n-terminal domains were used to measure the similarity between the tororo sequences and the genomic vsgs. the reading frame of some of the genomic vsg sequences was adjusted to maximize the amino acid sequence identity of the genomic vsg with the tororo vsg by permitting shifting from one frame to another. of the twenty eight genomic vsg sequences originally identified, twenty four encoded a complete n-terminal domain ; the remaining four were incomplete due to an end in the available genome sequence as opposed to a loss of identity . of the twenty four vsg n-terminal domain sequences identified from the genomes, half  encoding an intact and apparently functional vsg n-terminal domain without frame shifts or premature stop codons.

the n-terminal domains of the vsgs expressed by field isolates have similar percentage identities to homologues from t. b. brucei as to homologues from t. b. gambiense. the 'ntd orf intact?' column indicates whether the genomic homologue encoded an n-terminal domain that was apparently functional and the percentage identity is over the whole n-terminal domain or all the available sequence .

the percentage identity between the amino acid sequences of the n-terminal domains of the tororo vsgs and the closely related vsgs from either of the two genome sequences was determined by pairwise comparisons . twenty eight pairwise comparisons were made; twenty four comparisons between tororo vsgs and the complete n-terminal domains identified in one or other of the genomes, and four partial sequences from one or other of the genomes were included as each encoded more than half a vsg n-terminal domain.

identity varied from the arbitrary lower cut off of  <dig> % up to  <dig> %; the majority  were more than  <dig> % identical and the average identity was  <dig> % for comparisons between the tororo vsgs and tbb <dig> homologues and  <dig> % for comparisons between the tororo vsgs and the tbgdal <dig> homologues . a second observation from this analysis is that the percentage identity between any one tororo vsg and each of the two genomic vsgs tended to be similar, for example the identities  for vsg buteba  <dig> are  <dig> % and  <dig> % and for vsg buteba  <dig> are  <dig> % and  <dig> %. the similarity in rate of divergence is shown as the difference between the two percentage identities in table  <dig> 

the divergence between some homologous vsgs is consistent with selection for antigenically novel vsgs
it was possible to identify six tororo vsgs that had homologues in both tbb927and tbgdal with >  <dig> % identity in the n-terminal domain . these six vsgs were used for three way comparisons of amino acid sequence . of the six, vsg buteba  <dig> was chosen for detailed analysis as it was the only one with a type a n-terminal domain which allowed a more certain structure-based alignment and comparison with the known structure of vsg mitat <dig>   <cit> . the vsg buteba  <dig> n-terminal domain sequence was plotted against an arbitrary scale of the degree of variation at individual positions in the alignment of the three homologues . in addition, the solvent accessibility of individual residues in vsg mitat <dig>   was calculated to provide a guide to the accessibility of residues in the buteba  <dig> homologues . the divergence in sequence of the vsgs was concentrated in the region that was both solvent accessible and at the top of the vsg , this part of the vsg is believed to provide the primary targets of host immunoglobulins on living trypanosomes  <cit> . the second region of the vsg that is solvent accessible  is at the base of the structure is not accessible to antibodies on the living trypanosome  <cit>  and has not diverged as much is sequence.

a similar analysis was performed for the other five triplets of related vsgs . these five vsgs all have type b n-terminal domains and although there is firm evidence that they adopt a similar tertiary structure to type a vsgs  <cit>  they are less well characterized. the analysis showed that the differences between the members of each triplet were more evenly distributed throughout the primary structure than for the buteba  <dig> family. the average variation at each residue was calculated for the three structural parts of the vsg: the n-terminal coiled coil, the surface-exposed loops and the remained of the n-terminal domain. there was more variation per residue on average in the surface-exposed loops  then in either the coiled coil  or in the remainder of the domain  .

discussion
the main observations in this paper are:  the majority  of field isolates of t. b. brucei and t. b. rhodesiense from long-term infected domestic animals in tororo in south eastern uganda expressed vsgs that have close homologues  in one or both of the available t. b. brucei treu <dig>  and t. b. gambiense dal <dig>  genome databases.  the tororo vsgs have diverged to a similar extent from homologues in the tbb <dig> and tbgdal genomes despite the geographic and genetic separation of the t. b. gambiense isolate.  comparison of the tororo vsgs with the homologues in both tbb <dig> and tbgdal genomes indicates the diverged sequence is concentrated in the parts of the vsg that are predicted to be recognized by immunoglobulins on the living trypanosome.

two observations made in the course of the comparison of the tororo vsgs with the two genome sequences are relevant to the origin and maintenance of vsg repertoires in the t. brucei genome. first, most of the tororo vsgs were represented in both the east african tbb <dig> and the west african tbgdal genome sequences. this indicates that the current vsg repertoires in the three geographic locations evolved from a common ancestral repertoire. the overlap in repertoires reported here is likely to be less than the real overlap as vsg sequences are missing from both the tbb <dig> and tbgdal genome databases due to under representation of mini-chromosomes and telomeres in the tbb <dig> genome database  <cit>  and possibly under representation in the tbgdal whole genome shotgun sequences. second, the tororo vsgs have diverged to a similar extent from the homologous vsgs in each of the tbb <dig> and tbgdal genomes. this observation was surprising as t. b. gambiense has diverged from east african t. brucei ssp. and is distinguishable by a range of genetic markers  <cit> , reviewed in  <cit> . this greater divergence of t. b. gambiense is not visible as a greater divergence of vsg sequences in the tbgdal genome. in addition, west african t. b. gambiense produces a different disease pathology to east african t. b. rhodesiense in humans, the data here hint that this difference is not caused by or reflected in differences in the vsg repertoire but the number of sequences analysed in insufficient to draw any conclusions.

approximately  <dig> % of vsgs are encoded by single copy genes in the tbb <dig> genome  <cit>  . so, the finding that nearly all the tororo vsgs had single copy homologues in the tbb <dig> and tbgdal genomes was unexpected. it possible that more homologues will be identified as vsg multicopy gene family members as more minichromosome and telomeric sequence becomes available. however, another possibility is that the vsgs were isolated from long term infected domestic animals and were represented by single copy vsg genes as they are expressed late in an infection  <cit> .

genetic exchange within a population and particularly meiotic recombination has the effect of homogenizing gene sequences. the ancestral vsg repertoire was presumably a product of genetic exchange within t. brucei. the subsequent divergence of vsg repertoires could have arisen if the trypanosomes from the three locations, kenya, uganda and cote d'ivoire, ceased meiotic genetic exchange of telomeric and sub-telomeric vsg genes at approximately the same time without affecting genetic exchange of other genes in the central parts of chromosomes which undoubtedly continues  <cit> . the model that vsgs are excluded from meiotic recombination suggests that subsequent to the appearance of the vsg repertoire an evolutionary step occurred that blocked meiotic crossovers occurring within the subtelomeric arrays of vsg genes so that reciprocal exchange between vsg arrays became rare, possibly through the failure of the arrays to pair in meiotic prophase. it is important to note that a failure to pair homologues during meiosis would not affect the vsg gene conversion events integral to antigenic variation during mitotic cell cycles. this latter model is consistent with the finding that the sub-telomeric tandem arrays of vsg genes are so different as to be considered haploid in contrast to the remainder of the chromosomes which are diploid  <cit>  and that much of the difference in size between homologues can be explained by differences in the size of vsg gene tandem arrays  <cit> . the haploid vsg arrays permit a larger vsg repertoire per diploid genome and the exclusion of the arrays from genetic exchange would favour vsg divergence in different strains. a second possibility is that the cessation of genetic exchange between the west and east african isolates is explained by geographic separation. a similar explanation for the divergence of the east african isolates is more problematic but could have resulted from an unidentified ecological change imposing a barrier to free movement of infected mammals and/or infected tsetse flies. in contrast to vsgs, there is very little amino acid sequence variation in genes from the central parts of chromosomes. in a comparison of tbgdal with tbb <dig> using an array of twenty genes in the central part of chromosome  <dig> all twenty tbb <dig> genes had >  <dig> % amino acid sequence identity with the tbgdal genes .

the most likely selection pressure for the divergence of individual vsgs in different strains is to favour superinfection of a host by a second trypanosome strain. if this is the case then the divergence between homologous vsg should be sufficient to produce antigenically distinct trypanosomes. how different do two vsgs have to be to produce antigenically non-cross reactive trypanosomes? this has only been investigated once through a serendipitous experiment in which trypanosomes expressing the vsg antat <dig> b switched to the vsg antat <dig> . trypanosomes expressing vsg antat <dig>  were protected from antibodies to vsg antat <dig> b  <cit>  yet the two vsg n-terminal domains have  <dig> % identity and the value rises to  <dig> % if an insertion in the antat <dig>  sequence is excluded from the comparison . the identity between the tororo and genomic vsg n-terminal domains had a range of  <dig> to  <dig> %, so it is likely that many of the vsg homologues have evolved to be antigenically distinct when present on the trypanosome surface.

the observed difference in the rate of divergence of different vsgs  is consistent with earlier observations on the variation in vsgs in different stocks  <cit> . experiments based on immunological cross reactivity of rabbit antibodies present after infection with a trypanosome clone  <cit>  concluded that each strain had a characteristic set of vsgs expressed early in an infection and a limited number were shared between isolates. experiments based on nucleic acid hybridisation  <cit>  showed that some vsgs were present in all stocks, others in some stocks and some that were stock-specific. the problem in interpreting these results is that it is difficult to connect nucleic acid hybridisation with immunological cross-reactivity. however, the differences in vsg repertoires found are consistent with different rates of divergence observed here where some vsgs have diverged to become strain-specific whereas others are still recognisable as closely-related homologues.

the sequence divergence between the two antat vsgs described above is mostly in the surface-exposed loops of the vsg  and in the long coiled coil . the surface loops probably contain the b-cell epitopes  <cit>  and the coiled coil may contain t-cell epitopes  <cit> . a similar pattern of sequence divergence has been reported for the eight members of the vsg mitat <dig>  gene family present in a single genome from the t. b. brucei lister  <dig> isolate  <cit> . it was proposed that the divergence of vsg family members provided a reservoir of sequences for the combinatorial production of novel mosaic vsgs. however, unlike the large vsg mitat <dig>  gene family, nearly all the genomic vsg sequences identified here are single copy. thus, it is unlikely that the sequence divergence observed between strains is due to sampling members of a multigene family but represents differences between homologues in different strains.

in the comparisons between the tororo and tbb <dig> and tbgdal genomic vsgs, the divergence was more prevalent in the surface-exposed loops but also occurred elsewhere . the regions of variation in the coiled coil are not solvent exposed  and although the divergence may be simply sequence drift, it is possible that the variable regions are involved in a more subtle interaction with the host t-cell response. overall, the sequence divergence in the vsg n-terminal domains is consistent with selection for the generation of antigenically novel vsgs and that each strain has evolved or is evolving its own repertoire of vsgs. such a divergence in vsg repertoires would allow superinfection of hosts by different strains and possibly a partially immune host by the same strain. a consequences would be that any vaccine based on a large number of vsgs from a single strain is unlikely to offer complete protection against a different strain.

a second possibility to explain the higher prevalence of sequence variation in the surfaceloops is that that region of the vsg polypeptide is more tolerant of sequence variation than the remainder of the vsg polypeptide. however, the ratio of synonymous to non-synonymous changes to codons was the same in the coiled coil and in the surface loops providing evidence that both structural elements have a roughly equal tolerence for mutation overall . this observation is consistant with the model that the whole vsg structure is tolerant of sequence variation, as is witnessed by the vsgs sequences present in the genome, and different vsgs can vary over their entire amino acid sequence.

CONCLUSIONS
most of the expressed vsgs from tororo had closely related homologues in the tbb <dig> and tbgdal genomes indicating that genomic vsg repertoires probably contain a common set of vsg homologues. the ugandan tororo vsgs had diverged to a similar extent from homologues in the east and west african isolates indicating that the divergence probably started before the geographic dispersal of the strains and may indicate a reduced genetic exchange between vsg arrays. the location of divergence between vsg homologues was not random but was more prevalent in positions consistent with selection for the production of antigenically novel vsgs and thus strain-specific vsg repertoires. a consequence of strain-specific vsg repertoires is that any vaccine based on large numbers of vsgs from a single strain would only provide partial protection against other strains.
