BACKGROUND
metamorphosis represents a dramatic and large-scale morphological and functional change during post-embryonic development in free-living larvae of invertebrates and non-mammalian vertebrates including fishes, amphibians, and reptiles . it has been extensively studied in insects and amphibians, and its developmental process is tightly controlled by hormones  <cit> . in general, metamorphosis in vertebrates is a single, uninterrupted larval-adult transition, whereas in insects and some other invertebrates, it proceeds through multiple larval and pupal moults, each repeated with a qualitatively similar hormonal interaction  <cit> . this distinction is exemplified for distinct pulses of ecdysone just preceding each larval and pupal moult in manduca sexta and the single burst of triiodothyronine  for metamorphosis of xenopus larvae to the froglet stage  <cit> .

in most chordates studied to date, the onset of metamorphosis is characterized by a peak of a thyroactive compound, activating the thyroid receptor that modifies the expression of target genes and leads to morphological remodeling characteristic of the larva-to-juvenile transition  <cit> . however, thyroid hormone did not seem to be the main factor controlling hind limb development in tadpoles  <cit>  and metamorphosis in sea lamprey  . in fact, there is a drop in circulatory thyroid hormone levels prior to metamorphosis, and treatment of thyroid hormones per se failed to induce metamorphosis in sea lamprey .

in invertebrates, hsp <dig> seems to be the main factor controlling metamorphosis. blocking hsp <dig> function with geldanamycin triggers metamorphosis in protozoan leishmania parasites  <cit>  and in all major branches of metazoa including nematodes  <cit> , molluscs  <cit>  and sea urchin to tunicates  <cit> . the sea lamprey, a jawless vertebrate, diverged from urochordates  <dig> million years ago . the developmental control of sea lamprey metamorphosis may be an evolutionary intermediate between the hsp90-dependent invertebrate form and thyroid hormone-dependent vertebrate form  <cit> . therefore, the sea lamprey presents a unique model to study the evolutionary transition of developmental control during metamorphosis.

the sea lamprey develops through distinct life stages  <cit> . after hatching, larval sea lamprey live in burrows as benthic filter feeders. after seven metamorphic stages of dramatic change in external morphology and reorganization of internal organs  <cit> , the emerging juveniles  enter a parasitic phase during which they feed on blood and tissue fluid from host fish. after  <dig>  to 2 years feeding in the ocean or large lakes, the adults cease feeding in the early spring and migrate into rivers to spawn and die  <cit> .

the hepatobiliary system undergoes the most dramatic changes during sea lamprey metamorphosis, compared to other organs such as the intestine and the kidney . the cholangiocytes lining the extrahepatic bile duct and the gallbladder undergo apoptosis starting at the onset of metamorphosis , with the most dramatic morphological changes at metamorphic stage  <dig>  and full degeneration at metamorphic stage  <dig> . occasionally one or two intrahepatic bile ducts persist into metamorphic stages  <dig> and  <dig>  but usually disappear by stage  <dig>  <cit> . the hepatocytes cease bile acid synthesis in the early metamorphic stages, undergo cyto-architectural reorganization, eventually resume bile acid synthesis at metamorphic stage  <dig>  and proliferate to fill the space once occupied by the biliary system . despite thorough characterization of the cellular and organ-level morphological changes during sea lamprey metamorphosis, the developmental regulation of the hepatobiliary transformation is not fully understood.

we hypothesized that the hepatobiliary transformation during sea lamprey metamorphosis was due to transcriptional reprogramming that dictated cellular remodeling during metamorphosis, especially in landmark stages . we compared sea lamprey hepatobiliary transcriptomes at these landmark stages using mrna-seq and gene ontology  analyses, and validated the sequencing results with real-time quantitative pcr , histological and immunohistochemical staining, and antagonist and sirna blocking experiments. our results suggest that hsp <dig> may be critical for the transformation of the hepatobiliary system during sea lamprey metamorphosis.

RESULTS
hepatobiliary transcriptome reprogramming during liver metamorphosis
we sequenced and compared the liver transcriptomes of l, m <dig>  m <dig> and jv stages . all sequencing reads were 75mers. from the l liver,  <dig> , <dig> reads were sequenced, and  <dig>  % of them passed the quality filter . from the m <dig> liver,  <dig> , <dig> reads were sequenced and  <dig>  % of them passed the quality filter . the m <dig> liver produced  <dig> , <dig> reads, and  <dig>  % of them passed the quality filter . the jv liver produced  <dig> , <dig> reads, and  <dig>  % of them passed the quality filter . these sequences were assembled and aligned to a total of  <dig> genes, and these genes were clustered into  <dig> go categories. the go analyses compared differential expression  between the transcriptomes of different life stages.fig.  <dig> gene ontology  analyses of liver transcriptomes in metamorphic land mark stages. x-axis represents the go categories and y-axis represents gene clusters . color scale represents the log <dig> . only genes with 2-fold changes  are shown. a heat map showing go categories at least 2-fold higher in larval  compared to metamorphic stage  <dig> , p <  <dig> , false discovery rate ≤  <dig> . b heat map showing go categories at least 2-fold higher in m <dig> compared to l, p <  <dig> , false discovery rate ≤  <dig> . c heat map showing go categories at least 2-fold higher in metamorphic stage  <dig>  compared to m <dig>  p <  <dig> , false discovery rate ≤  <dig> . d heat map showing go categories at least 2-fold higher in newly transformed juvenile  compared to m <dig>  p <  <dig> , false discovery rate ≤  <dig> 



comparison of l and m <dig> liver transcriptomes revealed that  <dig> go categories and  <dig> genes were expressed at least 2-fold higher in l, whereas  <dig> go categories and  <dig> genes were expressed at least 2-fold higher in m <dig>  gene ontology categories related to developmental and metabolic processes and cell division  were more active in l compared to m <dig> . signaling pathways  and cytokine production were also higher in l compared to m <dig> . on the contrary, genes involved in protein folding and transmembrane transport were up-regulated at m <dig> compared to l . at m <dig>  the response to extracellular and external stimuli, and nutrient levels also increased compared to l . phospho-histone  <dig>  immunostaining confirmed that cell division was occurring in hepatocytes . on the other hand, cholangiocytes were apoptotic and degenerated, as indicated by alkaline phosphatase staining .fig.  <dig> hepatocyte proliferation and cholangiocyte apoptosis during liver metamorphosis. a–f: mitosis marker phospho-histone  <dig> immunostaining  in liver section at various metamorphic stages. paraffin sections  were stained with dab and counterstained with hematoxylin  nuclear stain. note that staining is localized only in hepatocytes. g–l: apoptosis marker alkaline phosphatase staining  in liver section at various metamorphic stages. paraffin sections  were stained with alkaline phosphatase  substrate nbt/bcip and counterstained with nuclear fast red . in larval  and metamorphic stages  <dig>  and  <dig> , ap activity was located in canaliculi between hepatocytes and the lumen lining of the cholangiocytes. in metamorphic stage  <dig> , ap activity was located in canaliculi between hepatocytes, blood cells and whole cholangiocytes. in metamorphic stage  <dig> , only a few blood cells contain ap activity. in newly transformed juvenile , no ap activity was detected. scale bar: 50 μm. bd: bile duct; h: hepatocyte



comparison of m <dig> and m <dig> liver transcriptomes revealed that  <dig> go categories and  <dig> genes were expressed at least 2-fold higher at m <dig>  tissue development, lipid metabolic processes, cell division, and phosphoinositide-mediated signaling pathways were higher in m <dig> compared to m <dig> . phospho-histone  <dig> immunostaining confirmed that cell division was occurring in hepatocytes . most bile ducts disappeared by m <dig> .

comparison of m <dig> and jv liver transcriptomes revealed that  <dig> go categories and  <dig> genes were expressed at least 2-fold higher in jv, mostly related to increased small molecule and organic acid  metabolism in the liver . cell proliferation was reduced at jv , and apoptosis was rarely detected .

differential transporter gene expression during liver metamorphosis
the transporters expressed at landmark metamorphic stages varied dramatically , and provided a snapshot of the essential factors required at each metamorphic stage. it appeared that liver transporter gene expressions shifted during sea lamprey metamorphosis. at l, transporters for phospholipids or fatty acids, ca2+, amino acids, peptides or oligopeptides were more prominent than m <dig>  at m <dig>  metabolism and bile acid transport were down-regulated, whereas the gene expressions of transporters for wound healing molecules  and cytoprotective agents such as taurine were dramatically increased. bile salt export pump  gene expression increased at later metamorphic stages and jv . expression of bile acid co-transporter slc10a <dig> was increased in jv, but not at m <dig> .table  <dig> transporter gene expression at various metamorphic stages

hgf and met promote hepatocyte regeneration during liver metamorphosis
real time quantitative pcr analyses of liver gene expressions throughout various life stages revealed that hepatocyte growth factor , a hepatocyte proliferating agent, increased at m <dig>  whereas its receptor met peaked at m <dig> . these results demonstrated that hgf gene expression peaked at the metamorphic stage with heightened hepatocyte proliferation .

hsp <dig> gene expression altered at landmark developmental event
transcriptome analyses revealed that genes involved in protein folding were up-regulated at m <dig> when the most dramatic metamorphic events occurred. hsp <dig> was identified as a candidate key factor during liver metamorphosis because of its involvement in protein folding  <cit> , metamorphosis in invertebrates  <cit> , and human biliary atresia  <cit> . increased hsp <dig> mrna expression coincided with the onset , gall bladder disappearance , and final stages  of metamorphosis . sharp declines of hsp <dig> mrna concentrations also demarcated the heightened biliary degeneration stage  and transitions in metamorphic and life stages, for example: metamorphic stage  <dig>  to newly-transformed juvenile , small parasite  to large parasite , pre-ovulatory female  to ovulatory female , and pre-spermiating male  to spermiating male  .fig.  <dig>

discussion
we hypothesized that transcriptional reprogramming in landmark stages  drove hepatobiliary transformation during sea lamprey metamorphosis. our results showed that hepatobiliary transcriptome reprogramming occurred at landmark stages during metamorphosis. the transporter genes and the ecm gene composition were altered during liver metamorphosis, and the histological and morphological changes during liver metamorphosis also paralleled the transcriptome reprogramming. these results are similar to the remodeling through “gene switching” observed in xenopus laevis liver metamorphosis  <cit> . the changes in liver ecm composition also occurred during the transition from liver fibrosis and steatohepatitis to hepatocellular carcinoma  <cit> .

type iia col2a <dig> mrna was the major form of transcript found in most nonchondrogenic tissues of early human embryos  <cit> . similar to observations in the mouse, expression of col2a <dig> transcripts in human embryos was generally transient and was found in epithelial structures that participated in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions  <cit> . expression of col2a <dig> mrna was associated with major tissue remodeling such as hepatic cord development in the liver  <cit> . a previous morphological study showed that the onset of bile duct degeneration was demarcated by the folding and pleating of the basement membrane  <cit> . it is likely that the disintegration and reorganization of the basement membrane was associated with the early events of liver metamorphosis. indeed, the breakdown of basement membranes was an important step in the controlled rearrangement of cells during metamorphosis  <cit> . our observation of transient fibrosis during liver metamorphosis is consistent with these prior demonstrations that reorganization of collagen fibers plays a significant role in liver metamorphosis.

the cholangiocytes degenerated during liver metamorphosis in the sea lamprey, similar to those from analyses of japanese lamprey  metamorphosis, which showed that the apoptotic signal was initiated in the region around the cystic duct, and the smaller peripheral ducts degenerate more rapidly than the large central ducts  <cit> . our results are also consistent with previous findings that membrane enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase relocated from apical to lateral membranes during lamprey ba  <cit> .

apoptosis of cholangiocytes in liver allograft rejection was attributed to down-regulation of the apoptosis-inhibitory bcl- <dig> protein  <cit> . our transcriptome data showed that the gene expression of bcl- <dig> was the highest at l stage compared to m <dig> and m <dig>  and the lowest at jv stage. between m <dig> and m <dig>  sea lamprey transitions from the ductal to aductal stage, and cholangiocytes undergo apoptosis and degenerate. at jv stage, the liver of the transformed animal is totally aductal without any cholangiocytes. it is interesting that bcl- <dig> protein is absent in the early stage of human intrahepatic biliary system development, but present in the late stage  <cit> , and apoptosis can be induced by the purine-scaffold hsp <dig> inhibitor pu-h <dig> via down-regulation of bcl- <dig>  <cit> . in addition, inhibition of the molecular chaperone function of hsp <dig> by geldanamycin induces endoplasmic reticulum  stress-mediated apoptosis in different cell lines . it would seem that at l stage, low hsp <dig> and high bcl- <dig> expressions might protect against apoptosis.

the hepatocytes underwent mitosis during liver metamorphosis, indicated by some nuclear and mostly cytoplasmic staining of p-h <dig>  a mitotic marker. h <dig> phosphorylation has been shown to initiate at early prophase, and spread throughout the chromosomes at late prophase. at metaphase, most of the p-h <dig> aggregates at the ends of the condensed chromosomes at the equatorial plate. during anaphase and telophase, p-h <dig> is usually detached from chromosomes and found in the cytoplasm  <cit> . our results indicated that most of the hepatocytes with p-h <dig> staining were at anaphase or telophase. interestingly, histones could induce profound changes in the autophosphorylation of hsp <dig>  <cit> , and the direct interaction of hsp <dig> and histones induced condensation of the chromatin structure  <cit>  and decreased overall transcription activity  <cit> . hsp <dig> is evolutionarily conserved and essential for the maturation, activation and stability of “client” proteins that regulate proliferation, cell cycle and survival  <cit> . therefore, hsp <dig> could contribute to the activity of h <dig> phosphorylation and cell proliferation.

hgf has been shown to have potent effects on hepatic growth and differentiation . it functioned as a complete mitogen for hepatocytes  <cit>  and produced an anti-apoptotic effect  <cit> . the met signaling cascade is also a major player in liver development and differentiation . it is possible that hgf and met facilitated hepatocyte regeneration during sea lamprey metamorphosis. interestingly, met and its downstream effectors were also hsp <dig> clients  <cit> . hgf and met were both present in intrahepatic biliary system  cells in the early stage of human ibs development  <cit> . inhibition of hsp <dig> increased hgf gene expression  <cit> , and hsp <dig> inhibitor exhibited antineoplastic and antiangiogenic activity via met  <cit> . it appears that hsp <dig> is tightly linked to the activity of met during liver metamorphosis in sea lamprey.

gene expression of hsp <dig> decreased during metamorphosis but dramatically increased after metamorphosis in sea lamprey liver. this is consistent with the finding that blocking hsp <dig> function with the hsp <dig> inhibitor geldanamycin triggered metamorphosis in tunicates  <cit> . the transition from larval to adult stages in marine invertebrates was tightly regulated by an environmentally-sensitive competent period that delayed metamorphosis until the proper cues were detected by the larvae . in sea urchins and ascidians, hsp <dig> inhibitors triggered metamorphosis when applied during the competent period  <cit> . hsp <dig> and its substrates were also involved in life-cycle transitions of leishmania parasites  <cit>  and the metamorphosis of species spanning all major branches of metazoan phylogeny, from insects and nematodes  <cit> , to echinoderms  <cit> , ascidians  <cit>  and mollusks  <cit> . even in the amphibian, other members of the hsp family such as hsp30s played an important role in the transformation of the liver of rana catesbeiana during metamorphosis from an ammonotelic larva to a ureotelic adult  <cit> . interestingly, we found that hsp <dig> blocker geldanamycin facilitated and hsp <dig> sirna treatment synchronized gall bladder degeneration during liver metamorphosis in the sea lamprey. coincidentally, proteomic analyses comparing ba and non-ba neonatal cholestasis patients showed that hsp <dig> was the most significant biomarker that was down-regulated in ba patients  <cit> .

furthermore, we found that the expression of cholesterol and bile acid synthetic genes such as hmgcr, cyp7a <dig>  and cyp27a <dig>  and bile acid concentrations were altered after geldanamycin or hsp <dig> sirna injection, even up to 4 months. these results are consistent with reports that hsp <dig> was involved in cholesterol homeostasis  <cit> . lipid content was an important determining factor of lamprey metamorphosis  <cit> , and lipid and bile acid biosynthesis and metabolism changed dramatically during sea lamprey metamorphosis  <cit> . these results suggest that hsp <dig> was involved in many aspects of hepatobiliary transformation. however, geldanamycin or hsp <dig> sirna did not affect hsp <dig> mrna concentration per se at the time points examined. further time course analyses are required to establish the actual relations between hsp <dig> and all genes affected.

CONCLUSIONS
during sea lamprey liver metamorphosis, the ecm may be associated with the reorganization of the liver architecture. at the early stage of metamorphosis, the metabolism of hepatocytes was down-regulated. extracellular and external stimuli, nutrient levels, and phosphoinositide-mediated signaling pathways strongly affected the process of liver metamorphosis. major shifts in transporter expressions occurred throughout liver metamorphosis, whereas hepatocytes proliferated at later stages. once the process of biliary atresia was completed, the metabolism in hepatocytes resumed. hsp <dig> was involved in many aspects of hepatobiliary transformation including hepatocyte regeneration, biliary degeneration and changes in bile acid synthesis. we conclude that the sea lamprey is a useful animal model to study postembryonic development and mechanisms for hsp90-induced hepatobiliary transformation.
