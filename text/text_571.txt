BACKGROUND
as economically relevant traits, feeding behavior and food preference domestication determine production cost and profitability. although there are intensive research efforts on feeding behavior and food intake  <cit> , little is known about food preference. food preference is an innate behavioral trait subject to genetic influences. however, the genes and genetic factors that determine food preference are largely unknown. although several genes, including genes encoding taste receptors such as tas1r <dig>  <cit> , pkd2l <dig>  pkd1l <dig> and cd <dig>  <cit> , obesity-associated genes such as fto  <cit>  and apoa <dig>  <cit> , and metabolism genes such as amy <dig>  <cit>  and rnase <dig>  <cit> , were shown to be involved in the determination of food preference, very little is currently known about the transcriptome determining the unique food preference, such as live prey.

mandarin fish, as a demersal piscivore, is found only in the freshwaters of china and the river amur along the russian borderlands. it has very unique food preference. in the wild, once the fry start feeding, it feed solely on live fry of other fish species  <cit> . in rearing conditions, mandarin fish also accept only live prey fish, refusing dead prey fish or artificial diets  <cit> . among major species of mandarin fish, siniperca scherzeri, is much easier to accept dead prey fish compared to s. chuatsi, and the difference in acceptance of dead prey fish is further amplified in the hybrid f <dig> of s. chuatsi  × s. scherzeri . we hypothesize that changes in gene expression as well as snps account for this dramatic difference. elucidating the genes regulating the unique food preference  in mandarin fish could lead to a better understanding of mechanisms controlling food preference in animals, including mammals.

in higher vertebrates such as mammals, the responses of primary centers are coordinated by correlation centres, and the cerebrum is the site of memory and considers the results of experiences on which intelligence and learning are based. in lower vertebrates such as fish, sense organs directly send signals to the primary centers to initiate behavior. hence their behavior consists of reflex responses with little variation or modification by experience. therefore compared with mammals, the study of feeding behavior and food preference in fish could enable us to observe direct effects of genes and genetic factors on food preference. to elucidate the relationship between gene expression and food preference, we performed de novo transcriptome sequencing and digital gene expression profiling  of feeders and nonfeeders of dead prey fish in mandarin fish. we showed that expression of genes in several pathways, including retinal photosensitivity, circadian rhythm, appetite control, learning and memory, were significantly different in feeders and nonfeeders. these potential determinants provide a glimpse of genetic architecture of the unique food preference.

RESULTS
high-throughput sequencing and annotation of unigenes
to obtain an overview of gene expression profile in mandarin fish with different food preferences, cdna libraries were constructed from dead prey fish feeders  and nonfeeders , and sequenced using the illumina hiseq <dig> system. high quality reads of sc_x and sc_w were assembled, yielding  <dig> , and  <dig>  contigs, respectively . after removing the partial overlapping sequences, a total of  <dig>  distinct sequences were obtained  . among these unigenes,  <dig> %  were between  <dig> and 500 bp in length,  <dig> %  were longer than 500 bp, of which  <dig> %  were longer than  <dig>  bp. six unigenes were aligned with either sanger-derived sequences that we obtained by sequencing pcr products or reference sequences deposited in ncbi. each sequence had more than 98% coverage validation . the sequencing data in this study have been deposited in the ebi arrayexpress database .

 <dig>  unigenes  were aligned function by blastx, and  <dig>   assembled sequences could not be matched to any known protein.  <dig>  annotated sequences had significant matches with  <dig>  unique accession numbers. the blastx top-hit species distribution of gene annotations showed highest homology to zebrafish , followed by atlantic salmon  and spotted green pufferfish  . in addition, the mandarin fish sequences also had homologies to four other fish species including japanese pufferfish , sablefish , rainbow smelt  and medaka . these results indicated a high level of phylogenetic conservation between mandarin fish and other fish species, especially zebrafish.  <dig> unigenes of our transcriptome libraries matched the published mandarin fish protein sequences  currently available in ncbi database, suggesting the identification of a large number of new genes by transcriptome sequencing reported here.

of  <dig>  annotated sequences in mandarin fish transcriptome,  <dig>   were assigned with one or more gene ontology  terms. in total,  <dig>  go assignments were finally obtained, with  <dig> % for biological processes,  <dig> % for cellular components, and  <dig> % for molecular functions. level  <dig> go functional categories were summarized in figure  <dig>  the number and assortment of allocated go categories reflected the diversity and complexity of genes expressed in mandarin fish. we mapped the  <dig>  annotated sequences to the reference canonical pathways in kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  to identify the biological pathways. in total, we assigned  <dig>  sequences to  <dig> known metabolic or signaling pathways. the representative pathways with the differentially expressed genes were mitogen-activated protein kinases  signaling pathway , calcium signaling pathway , insulin signaling pathway , long-term potentiation  , long-term depression , taste transduction  and mammalian circadian rhythm  .

snp and ssr discovery
the transcript/est-based markers are important resource for determining functional genetic variation  <cit> . we detected  <dig>  potential snps in feeders and  <dig> potential snps in nonfeeders. the overall frequency of predicted snps in the mandarin fish transcriptome was one per  <dig>  bp. a total of  <dig>  snps were identified, including  <dig>  transitions and  <dig>  transversions;  <dig>  of these snps had been annotated. of these snps,  <dig>  were identified from unigenes covered by ten or more reads, suggesting that  <dig> % of snps found in this transcriptome were covered with sufficient sequencing depth and more likely to represent ‘true’ snps. of  <dig> snp loci predicted to reside in the  <dig> amplified sequences,  <dig> sites were validated . there were roughly  <dig> times more potential snps in feeders than in nonfeeders. whether the difference in snp prevalence accounts for the different acceptance of dead prey fish in hybrid f <dig> warrants further investigation. for identification of simple sequence repeats , all  <dig>  unigenes generated in this study were applied to determine potential microsatellites using batchprimer <dig>  . we identified a total of  <dig>  potential ssrs in  <dig>   unigenes with frequency of one ssr per  <dig>  kb of the unigenes. of  <dig>  ssr-containing sequences,  <dig>   had been annotated, and could be considered as preferred candidates for marker development.

identification of differentially expressed genes
we found  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes to be differentially expressed between feeders and nonfeeders from transcriptome and dge analysis  ≤  <dig> , fold-change ≥  <dig>  figures  <dig> and 3), respectively. analysis of these genes revealed the signaling pathways involved, including retinal photosensitivity , retinol dehydrogenase  <dig> , cellular retinol-binding protein  and guanylate cyclase ), circadian rhythm , period  <dig> , rev-erbα, casein kinase  and nocturnin), appetite control , growth hormone , pro-opiomelanocortin , peptide yy , insulin and leptin), learning and memory , c-fos, fos-related antigen  <dig> , ccaat enhancer binding protein , zif <dig>  brain-derived neurotrophic factor  and synaptotagmin ) . the importance of these genes was further supported by the identification of significant potential snp, ssr and antisense transcripts in these genes. to compare the two tissues  that are of interest for food preference, we identified  <dig>  unigenes that were differentially expressed between liver and brain in feeders, and  <dig>  unigenes in nonfeeders  by dge. in addition, dge analysis of mandarin fish with the two different food preferences generated  <dig> , <dig> clean tags from brain and  <dig> , <dig> clean tags from liver, respectively .

real-time rt-pcr was frequently used to confirm data obtained from high-throughput sequencing  <cit> . here, we also used real-time rt-pcr to confirm the differential expression of  <dig> genes in s. chuatsi that went through the same training procedure. the data obtained were consistent with those obtained from the transcriptome sequencing and dge analysis .

discussion
little is known about the genes and biological mechanisms controlling food preference in animals. in this study, by profiling the transcriptomes of dead prey fish feeders and nonfeeders in mandarin fish, we identified differentially expressed genes potentially influencing the unique food preference of live prey, including those affecting retinal photosensitivity, circadian rhythm, appetite control, learning and memory. real-time rt-pcr confirmed the differential expression in selected genes. we also found dramatic difference in snp abundance in feeders vs nonfeeders. these differences together might account for the different food preferences.

differentially expressed genes involved in retinal photosensitivity pathway
animals make food choices based on a number of physiological, nutritional, environmental, and sociocultural factors  <cit> . sensitivity of sensory system is critical to food preference. it is thus advantageous for mandarin fish to catch prey fish at night through the perception of motion and shape with the help of its well-developed scotopic vision  <cit> . although salmo spp. also shows the selection of food motion and shape to some extent, the offered food pellet can be captured immediately before it falls down to the bottom of the tank because they have high visual acuity, thus can feed swiftly by darting  <cit> . this contrasts with mandarin fish, which has low visual acuity and feed only by stalking. mandarin fish might not be able to accomplish its relatively long process of prey recognition before the offered food pellet has fallen down to the bottom of the tank and can no longer be perceived by its sensory organs. the more strict selection of prey motion and shape also makes it more difficult to feed mandarin fish with artificial diets and dead prey fish. hence much better developed visual ability could improve the mandarin fish to accept dead prey fish or artificial diets  <cit> .

adaptation to dark in most animals is associated with increased 11-cis-retinal generation and rhodopsin reconstitution. factors that interfere with the rhodopsin cycle or its downstream signaling pathways will affect vision, especially scotopic vision . we observed differential expression of crbp, rgr, rdh <dig> and gc in brains of feeders vs nonfeeders. crbp is involved in the initial processing of retinol from food  <cit> . light-dependent formation of 11-cis-retinal by the retinal pigment epithelium and regeneration of rhodopsin under photic conditions involve the rgr opsin located in the retinal pigment epithelium  <cit> . rdh <dig> is a critical regulator of chromophore regeneration  <cit> . gc, as a family of enzymes that catalyze the conversion of gtp to cgmp, are central in phototransduction cascade  <cit> . our results suggested that the up-regulation of crbp, rgr and rdh <dig>  and down-regulation of gc in feeders might lead to increased 11-cis-retinal and rhodopsin levels, deceased cgmp generation, leading to greater visual ability and light sensitivity. thus the feeders could capture the dead prey fish before it falls to the bottom of the tank. moreover, the mrna expression levels of connexin  <dig> , cyp4v <dig> and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor  <dig>  genes in the brain of feeders were all higher than those of nonfeeders, potentially contributing to the food preference  <cit>  .

differentially expressed genes involved in circadian rhythm pathway
previous studies demonstrated that the molecular mechanisms of circadian rhythm generation in zebrafish appear to be generally consistent with the mammalian model  <cit> . we identified homologs of the mammalian clock genes in mandarin fish. we found differential expression in several clock genes, including per <dig>  per <dig>  cryptochrome , clock, bmal <dig>  ckiα, ckiγ, ckiδ, ckiiβ, rev-erbα, skp <dig> and rbx <dig> in feeders vs nonfeeders . these genes are known to be critical regulators of circadian rhythm  <cit> . taken together, changes in expression levels of these clock genes in feeders might reset circadian phase and contribute to the unique food preference.

differentially expressed genes involved in appetite control pathway
previous studies provide a framework for understanding the regulation of food intake in mammals and fish. peripheral signals such as leptin from adipocytes, insulin from endocrine pancreas, cholecystokinin and peptide yy from gastrointestinal tract are incorporated in the hypothalamus to generate orexigenic  or anorexigenic  derived from pomc) signals  <cit> . we observed lower expression of orexigenic genes , creb, eukaryotic initiation factor  4e binding protein , tuberous sclerosis  <dig> , ghrelin and leptin receptor gene-related protein ) and higher expression of anorexigenic genes , insulin, leptin, cholecystokinin  and tachykinin 1) in feeders compared with nonfeeders . these genes are well established regulators of energy homeostasis and play important roles in determination of food preferences  <cit> . the changes in gene expression suggested that feeders had decreased appetite.

differentially expressed genes involved in learning and memory pathway
food habits can develop with learning experience  <cit> . our previous study indicated that sensory modality and associative learning appear to be critical factors in food discrimination of mandarin fish  <cit> . however, study on genes involved in learning and memory of nocturnal piscivorous fish has received little attention. a number of molecules participate in learning and memory processes. the torc1-mediated creb regulation is a critical molecular step underlying synaptic plasticity and long-term memory  <cit> . as a suppressor of creb, protein phosphatase  <dig>  determines the efficacy of learning and memory by limiting acquisition and favoring memory decline  <cit> . neural cell adhesion molecule  plays an important role in axonal growth, learning, and memory through activating the phosphorylation of mapks and creb  <cit> . in our study, compared with nonfeeders, the mrna levels of creb and ncam were dramatically decreased and pp <dig> were slightly increased in feeders, protentially resulting in significant deficiency in the maintenance of long-term memory of its natural food preference, and therefore feeders were able to accept novel food  .

along the same line, as members of immediate early gene and the fos family of transcription factors, c-fos and fra- <dig> mrna expressions are up-regulated in response to a variety of neuronal activation protocols, including ltp  <cit> . in the current study, c-fos, fra- <dig> and zif <dig> genes were expressed at significantly lower levels in feeders than in nonfeeders, suggesting disruption of ltp and memory formation in feeders  <cit> . we hypothesize that the acquisition of novel food preference might be closely associated with effacement of the original memory of natural food preference , and the enhanced learning capacity for new food preference . we also showed that in mandarin fish, a number of genes necessary for memory formation and retention ) were differentially expressed in feeders vs nonfeeders. they might also be involved in the determination of the unique food preference in mandarin fish   <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our results showed that there were individual differernces in hybrid f <dig> of mandarin fish in their feeding response to dead prey fish. the acquisition of novel food preference  might be due to enhanced visual ability, resetting of circadian phase, decreased appetite, deficiency in memory retention and more abundant variant alleles. interaction of retinal photosensitivity, circadian rhythm, appetite control, learning and memory outputs might drive the feeding behavior.
