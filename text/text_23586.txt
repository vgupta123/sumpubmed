BACKGROUND
pseudomonas aeruginosa is a known common pathogen in respiratory tract infections. these diseases are usually chronic, such as pulmonary infections in intubated patients and for patients with cystic fibrosis , bronchiectasis, diffuse panbronchiolitis  <cit>  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . one reason why treating these infections is difficult is the production of biofilms by p. aeruginosa  <cit> . organisms in the biofilm become more resistant than planktonic bacteria to physical and chemical attacks, such as by chemotherapeutic reagents. discovering substances that inhibit biofilm formation and/or disrupt established biofilms is essential for treating these diseases.

n-acetylcysteine  is a mucolytic agent that has anti-bacterial properties. nac also decreases biofilm formation by a variety of bacteria  <cit>  and reduces the production of an extracellular polysaccharide matrix, while promoting the disruption of mature biofilms  <cit> . the effect of nac on p. aeruginosa biofilms has not been extensively studied, and a better understanding of bacterial responses to nac may facilitate its use as a biofilm inhibitor. thus, we investigated the effects of nac for  anti-bacterial properties,  detachment of biofilms,  viable cells in biofilms and  production of extracellular polysaccharides  by p. aeruginosa.

RESULTS
susceptibility of p. aeruginosa strains to nac and the in vitro interactive effects of nac and ciprofloxacin
twenty p. aeruginosa strains were isolated from respiratory samples. the minimum inhibitory concentrations  of nac for  <dig> p. aeruginosa isolates were  <dig> to  <dig> mg/ml, and mics for another  <dig> isolates were >  <dig> mg/ml. the combination of nac and ciprofloxacin demonstrated either synergy  or no interaction  against the p. aeruginosa strains; antagonism was not observed.

interpretations of biofilm production
using the criteria of stepanovic et al, p. aeruginosa strains were divided into the following categories:  <dig>  were weak biofilm producers;  <dig>  were moderate biofilm producers;  <dig>  were strong biofilm producers.

effects of nac on biofilms of p. aeruginosa pao <dig> and quantitative analysis using comstat software
as shown in figure  <dig>  biofilms were observed using confocal laser scanning microscopy  and three-dimensional images were reconstructed by olympus fv10-asm <dig>  software. a gfp-plasmid was inserted into pao <dig>  which allowed the detection of live bacteria by fluorescence. observed by clsm, pao <dig> grew in a characteristic pattern with a lawn of bacterial growth on the surface. these results showed that nac disrupted and inhibited pao <dig> biofilms, fluorescence and thickness decreased after exposure to nac, and there was an nac dose-dependent effect. almost no fluorescence was detected after  <dig> mg/ml nac treatment, indicating that very few to no live pao <dig> were present. decreased gfp detection levels were associated with increasing concentrations of nac in each fixed scanning area .

when analyzed using comstat software, p. aeruginosa biofilms showed significant structural differences in the presence of the nac regimen . the biomass, substratum coverage, average thickness, maximum thickness and surface area of the biomass all decreased for biofilms grown in the presence of nac. the surface to volume ratio and roughness coefficients showed the opposite trends.

viable cell counts after treatment with nac combined with cip
results for viable cell counts in biofilms are shown in table  <dig>  nac had an independent anti-microbial effect on biofilm-associated p. aeruginosa at  <dig>  mg/ml . compared with the control, there were significant differences at ciprofloxacin  of  <dig> mic,  <dig> mic or  <dig> mic . nac-ciprofloxacin combinations consistently decreased viable biofilm-associated bacterial counts relative to the control. this combination was synergistic at nac of  <dig>  mg/ml and cip of 1/2mic .

effect of nac on extracellular polysaccharides  production
eps production by p. aeruginosa decreased significantly in the presence of nac. the amount of eps produced by p. aeruginosa decreased, on average, by as much as  <dig> % and  <dig> % in the presence of  <dig>  mg/ml and  <dig> mg/ml nac, respectively.

discussion
nac is considered a non-antibiotic drug that has anti-bacterial properties. in  <dig>  parry and neu  <cit>  found that nac had the characteristics to inhibit the growth of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae and enterobacter clocae. p. aeruginosa was more susceptible than most of the other tested microorganisms , p. aeruginosa strains were inhibited synergistically by nac and carbenicillin or ticarcillin. roberts and cole  <cit>  found that 2%-5% of nac was anti-bactericidal against p. aeruginosa, the effect of the carbenicillin on p. aeruginosa was augmented by low concentrations of nac, and the mic of the organisms to carbenicillin was reduced from  <dig> μg/ml to  <dig> μg/ml in the presence of one per cent nac. the mechanism for the anti-bacterial effect of nac may be that it acts by competitively inhibiting amino acid  utilization or, by virtue of possessing a sulfhydryl group, may react with bacterial cell proteins. our results are consistent with those of roberts and cole, as most of the p. aeruginosa strains were inhibited at concentrations <  <dig> mg/ml of nac, and a higher percentage of synergistic combinations with nac was observed with ciprofloxacin . this means that nac and ciprofloxacin may be used together to treat p. aeruginosa infections.

due to its ability to produce a biofilm, p. aeruginosa is responsible for some chronic pulmonary infections, such as those in cystic fibrosis , bronchiectasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . it also implicates that the infections are associated with endotracheal tubes  <cit> . p. aeruginosa eventually causes infections in most patients with cf, and once a chronic infection is established, eradication of p. aeruginosa strains is nearly impossible. patients with bronchiectasis who are colonized by p. aeruginosa exhibit more advanced diseases and more severe impairments of pulmonary function compared with those who remain free of colonization  <cit> . some observations suggest that p. aeruginosa is a more common cause of infection as copd advances  <cit> . recently, martínez-solano et al.  <cit>  showed that patients with copd were usually infected with at least  <dig> p. aeruginosa clone that remained in the lungs for years. during chronic infection, each clone diversified, and isolated from samples of infected lungs tended to produce more biofilm compared with the isolation from blood samples. the structure and physiological characteristics of a biofilm confer an inherent resistance to anti-microbial agents. the mics of anti-microbial agents can be increased 100- to 1000-fold when bacteria grow in biofilms as compared to planktonic bacteria  <cit> . therapy almost always fails to eradicate the bacteria in biofilms. therefore, it is important to search for an effective drug to eradicate the biofilm.

previous studies have shown that nac could decrease biofilm formation by a variety of bacteria  <cit>  and that it inhibited bacterial adherence, reduced the production of extracellular polysaccharide matrix, while promoting the disruption of mature biofilms, and reduced sessile cell viability  <cit> . olofsson  <cit>  studied the biofilms of  <dig> bacterial strains isolated from a paper mill. these results showed that eps production decreased significantly in the presence of nac . although the growth didn't affected the most of tested bacteria, the average reduction in the amount of eps produced was 58% ± 20%; the presence of nac reduced the number of attached multi-species community bacteria by as much as 76% ± 46%. there is only one article demonstrated the inhibitory effect of nac on p. aeruginosa adherence and biofilm formation in vitro by the number of viable cell counts previously, and also revealed that ciprofloxacin/nac combination showed the highest ability to inhibit biofilm synthesis and disrupt preformed mature biofilms  <cit> . in our research, inhibitory effects of drugs on biofilms not only determined by the viable count technique, but also were imaged using clsm and quantified biofilm structures by comstat program, eps production in the presence of nac also be examined quantitatively. clsm can provide three-dimensional, noninvasive inspection and computer reconstruction of mature biofilms without appreciable distortion of architecture in a manner similar to computer-assisted tomography and magnetic resonance imaging methods. comstat comprises some features for quantifying three-dimensional biofilm image stacks  <cit> . biomass represents the overall volume of the biofilm, substratum coverage reflects how efficiently the substratum is colonized by bacteria of the population, the surface area of biomass is the area which summation of all biomass voxel surfaces exposed to the background, the surface to volume ratio is the surface area divided by the bio-volume which indicates how the biofilm adapts to the environment, roughness provides a measure of how much the thickness of the biofilm varies, and it is also an indicator of biofilm heterogeneity. our results showed that nac dispersed the biofilms formed by p. aeruginosa. by visual inspection of clsm images, nac disrupted and inhibited pao <dig> biofilms, fluorescence and thickness decreased after exposure to nac and there were dose-dependent effects. biofilms were nearly detached at  <dig> mg/ml nac. using comstat software, the pao <dig> biofilm biomass decreased and its heterogeneity increased gradually in direct proportion to the nac concentration. nac also had an independent anti-microbial effect on biofilm-associated p. aeruginosa at  <dig>  mg/ml  and had a synergistic effect with cip. bacterial exopolysaccharides are the main component of the biofilm, which creates an efficient scavenging system for trapping and concentrating essential minerals and nutrients from the surrounding environment. our research showed that the amounts of eps produced by p. aeruginosa strains were also significantly inhibited by  <dig>  and  <dig> mg/ml of nac. taking into account the results given above, nac may be a potent agent for treating p. aeruginosa biofilms associated infections, and can be used in combination with ciprofloxacin.

stafanger  <cit>  studied the effect of peroral nac in patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic pulmonary p. aeruginosa infection, a significant improvement of the spirometric values was proved after nac treatment in the patients with peak expiratory flow rate below or equal to 70% of predicted normal values. stey  <cit>  reviewed the publications on the effect of oral nac in chronic bronchitis, eleven randomized controlled nac trials were analysed , concluded that oral nac reduced the risk of exacerbation and improved symptoms in patients with chronic bronchitis compared with palcebo. but the benefit it achieved still remains unclear. we are not sure whether it took into account the other elements such as anti-bacterial activities and detach biofilms or not? it needs further study.

nac can be administered by nebulization or direct instillation, orally or intravenously. the concentrations tested in our study are much higher than those reach in serum when administer by an intravenous or oral route. nevertheless, it may be possible that using local respiratory application  obtains useful concentrations to disrupt biofilms and control biofilm-associated infections of p. aeruginosa.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our results suggest that nac has anti-bacterial properties against p. aeruginosa and may detach p. aeruginosa biofilms. it may be a new strategy for the treatment of biofilm-associated chronic respiratory infections, although it would be appropriate to conduct in vivo animal models and clinical studies to confirm this.
