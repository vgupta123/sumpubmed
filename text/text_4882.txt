BACKGROUND
bacterial blight , caused by xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae , is a devastating rice disease worldwide  <cit> . the development and deployment of resistant cultivars carrying major resistance  genes has been the most effective approach for bb management  <cit> . however, rapid resistance loss in rice varieties carrying a single r gene is a problem for breeders  <cit> . sustainable control measures for bb require a better understanding of resistance mechanisms in rice  <cit> .

during the co-evolution between hosts and microorganisms, plants evolved a repertoire of r genes to defend themselves against pathogens by mounting effective, fine-tuned immune responses  <cit> . like arabidopsis, rice has evolved a two-layered innate immune system that includes pathogen-associated molecular pattern -triggered immunity  and effector-triggered immunity   <cit> . pti, the first layer of defense, is governed by pattern recognition receptors  that recognize highly conserved pamps, triggering a relatively weak immune response that restricts colonization by invading organisms. to circumvent pti, adapted pathogens can deliver effector molecules directly into the plant cell. through co-evolution with pathogens, plants have accordingly developed intracellular immune receptors  that can recognize the presence of certain pathogen effector molecules and trigger eti  <cit> . in contrast to pti, eti, the second layer of defense, is a rapid and robust response, usually associated with localized programmed cell death , referred to as the hypersensitive response , which is defined as a localized and rapid cell death response at sites of pathogen attack  <cit> .

functional genomic surveys of pathogen effectors have indicated that these proteins are highly diverse in sequence, as well as in molecular function  <cit> . however, the cognate r proteins in plants are structurally conserved. the numerous r proteins identified in arabidopsis thaliana and in rice  have typically consisted of a variable amino terminus, a nucleotide-binding site  domain in the middle, and a leucine-rich repeat  domain at the carboxyl terminus. nbs-lrr type r genes in monocots, such as rice, usually carry a putative coiled-coil  domain at the n-terminus  <cit> .

serving as a model system to elucidate the interactions between pathogens and monocotyledon plants,  <dig> r genes,  <dig> dominant and  <dig> recessive, conferring resistance to bb have been registered  and identified  <cit> , and six genes, xa <dig>  xa <dig>  xa <dig>  xa <dig>  xa26/xa <dig>  and xa <dig>  have been cloned . the first class of r genes contains receptor kinases, including the cloned xa <dig> and xa <dig>  <cit> , but the molecules produced by xoo that are recognized by xa <dig> and xa <dig> have not yet been characterized. xa <dig> represents the second major class of r genes, the nbs-lrr group. the gene for the elicitor signal from the pathogen has not been identified for xa <dig>  however, some genes encode diverse proteins that are expressed and trigger eti after the recognition of the pathogen-delivered transcription activator-like  effector genes avrxa <dig>  <cit> . recently, there have been great advances in understanding the recognition between the r protein in rice and effector in xoo including xa <dig> and avrxa <dig>  <cit> , xa <dig> and avrxa <dig>   <cit> , and xa <dig> and talc9b/avrxa <dig>  <cit>  however, research on how the r proteins trigger signal transduction cascades leading to hr in rice is still obscure.

xa <dig> is a novel dominant r gene with a broad-spectrum hypersensitive response  to xoo  <cit> . in this study, we compared transcriptome profiling by rna sequencing  and identified differentially expressed genes  in a rice introgression line  h <dig> compared with its parents. our results elucidated some interesting molecular mechanisms underlying bshr mediated by r proteins in rice.

RESULTS

plants of h <dig>  its recurrent parent huang-hua-zhan , and its donor parent psbrc <dig>  were inoculated with xoo phillipines’ race 9b  at the tillering stage to evaluate their resistance reactions. h <dig> carrying xa <dig> displayed light brown along the wounded edges of clipped leaves at 3 days post-inoculation  and localized brown necrosis became more apparent at  <dig> dpi, exhibiting a typical hr. in contrast, a susceptible chlorotic symptom was visible on hhz- and p28-infected leaves at  <dig> dpi, and water-soaked lesions rapidly spread along the clipped sites at  <dig> dpi. h <dig> was highly resistant to pxo <dig> with an average  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cm lesion length  at  <dig> dpi. the two parents were highly susceptible to pxo <dig>  with the lls from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cm .figure  <dig>

dna fragmentation rates of hhz and h <dig> were detected after inoculation. dna fragmentation was observed in both hhz and h <dig> at  <dig> dpi , and more fragmented dna was observed in h <dig> than hhz at  <dig> dpi. notably, the dna in hhz was degraded at  <dig> dpi because of necrosis, whereas the dna in h <dig> showed no changes, owing to the cessation of cell death.

gene expression profiling of three rice genotypes under inoculation and non-inoculation conditions
the total rna from the inoculated leaves of h <dig>  hhz, and p <dig> at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi  and their corresponding non-inoculated controls  were paired-end sequenced using illumina sequencing technology. a total of  <dig> – <dig>  million reads of 100 bp in length were generated for each sample, and the number of mapped reads was in the range of  <dig> – <dig>  million, with the matching ratio in the range of  <dig> – <dig> % . the high-quality reads from individual libraries were mapped to the rice genome, and more than  <dig>  mapped unique genes per library were determined simultaneously. the unique matching reads were used for further analysis. the high correlation  between rna-seq and qrt-rcr expression values indicated that there was a high level of agreement between the approaches .table  <dig>

the expressed genes in all samples were subjected to a cluster analysis. as shown in additional file 2a: figure s <dig>  the three genotypes at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, as well as the control, were separated from each other. the three control samples clustered into a group, and the inoculated samples clustered into another group, suggesting that most of the expressed genes had similar expression patterns in response to pxo <dig> infection, even in different genotypes. the inoculated h <dig> and hhz clustered into a group, consistent with their similar genetic backgrounds, and samples at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi were in different subgroups, indicating that the gene expression responses to pathogen infection were dynamic.

to investigate the intrinsic differences in gene expression between the resistant and susceptible genotypes, the expression levels of genes in h <dig> were compared with those in hhz and p <dig> under the non-inoculation condition. there were  <dig>  degs identified between h <dig> and p <dig>  and  <dig> degs between h <dig> and hhz . between hhz and p <dig>  there were  <dig>  degs because of the larger genetic difference between these two lines than between h <dig> and its parents. the genes with higher basal expression levels in h <dig> compared with hhz were mainly functionally enriched in oxidoreductase activity, lyase activity, carboxylic acid metabolic process, response to stress, and cofactor binding .

degs between the resistant and susceptible genotypes after inoculation with xoo
to determine the differences in the transcriptomes of the three genotypes responsive to xoo infection, degs in the resistant genotype h <dig> were compared with its susceptible parents hhz and p <dig> at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi. in total,  <dig>  degs were found in h471-1dpi compared with hhz-1dpi. similarly,  <dig>   degs in h471-1dpi compared with p28-1dpi were identified. additionally,  <dig>  and  <dig>   degs were identified when h471-2dpi was compared with hhz-2dpi and p28-2dpi, respectively . there were  <dig> genes in common between h471-1dpi and hhz-1dpi, and h471-1dpi and p28-1dpi. additionally, there were  <dig> in common between h471-2dpi and hhz-2dpi, and h471-2dpi and p28-2dpi . a hierarchical average linkage cluster analysis displayed the degs of the three genotypes in two genetic background-dependent clusters. the six samples of h <dig> and hhz were in a cluster, and the three samples of p <dig> were in another cluster. the degs in h471-1dpi and h471-2dpi, hhz-1dpi and hhz-2dpi, h471-ck and hhz-ck were in three different subgroups , and the  <dig> degs in h <dig> compared with hhz under inoculation conditions represent the transcriptomic profile resistant to bb mediated by xa <dig> .figure  <dig>

these  <dig> degs could be classified into two groups based on their expression patterns before and after the xoo inoculation of h <dig>  the first group contained  <dig>  degs, which were differentially expressed under both non-inoculation and inoculation conditions. among them,  <dig> genes were differentially up-regulated in h <dig> compared with hhz after inoculation, whereas  <dig> genes were differentially down-regulated after inoculation . the first group is functionally enriched in defense response, protein amino acid phosphorylation, and apoptosis-associated proteins by go analysis . the second group contained  <dig> degs that were responsive to xoo infection at a minimum of one time point after inoculation. among them, only one significant go term , characterizing nine degs, was identified. these nine disease r genes included three up-regulated and six down-regulated genes responsive to xoo infection .

degs related to protein kinases in h <dig> and hhz respond to xoo infection
protein kinases play central roles in signal recognition and the subsequent activation of plant defense mechanisms during pathogen infection. in this study,  <dig> genes encoding protein kinases were differentially expressed in h <dig> compared with hhz, and  <dig> were responsive to xoo infection . among these degs, three types of receptor-like protein kinases  were identified. the first group was composed of five genes encoding cysteine-rich receptor kinases , which were differentially expressed in h <dig> compared with hhz at  <dig> dpi . among them, two genes encoding cysteine-rich rlk  <dig>  were up-regulated, whereas the other three genes  were down-regulated. the second group was composed of two genes encoding the lrr protein kinases  , which were up-regulated in h <dig> compared with hhz after inoculation with xoo, and six genes encoding lrks , which were down-regulated in h <dig> compared with hhz after xoo inoculation . of these, the expression of loc_os08g <dig> was induced by xoo infection, while the expression levels of the other four genes  were inhibited in h <dig> at  <dig> dpi. the final group of rlks consisted of seven genes encoding wall-associated kinases , which were differentially expressed in h <dig> compared with hhz at  <dig> dpi. of the differentially expressed waks, oswak <dig>  was up-regulated in h <dig> compared with hhz at  <dig> dpi, while the other six genes  were down-regulated. these genes were all located in the introgressed fragments of chromosome  <dig> in h <dig> .

in addition to rlks, two genes encoding calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases  were differentially expressed in h <dig> at  <dig> dpi. one gene  was up-regulated, and the other  was down-regulated .

degs involved in phytohormone signaling pathways in response to xoo infection
plant hormones, such as salicylic acid , jasmonate , gibberellic acids , ethylene, and brassinosteroids , act as signals to trigger and mediate a diverse array of plant immune responses  <cit> . in this study, six genes related to sa, ja, or ethylene were up-regulated or down-regulated in h <dig> after inoculation with xoo. however, none of them showed significantly different expression levels between h <dig> and hhz after xoo inoculation. . however, a ga receptor, gid1l <dig> , a br signaling gene, osserk1/osbak <dig> , and a gene related to br biosynthesis , were up-regulated in h <dig> compared with hhz after xoo infection .table  <dig>

differential expression of transcription factors  and genes possibly related to post-transcription regulation in h <dig> and hhz
tfs are master regulators of gene expression and play key roles in the large-scale transcriptional reprogramming of plants in response to pathogen attacks. in this study, eight degs, five up-regulated and three down-regulated, encoding tfs in six families were identified in h <dig> compared with hhz after infection by xoo. four of the genes were induced and one gene was inhibited by xoo infection . five out of the eight tf genes, including loc_os03g <dig> , osiro <dig> , osmads <dig> , oswrky <dig> , and loc_os07g <dig> , were up-regulated in h <dig>  two tfs belonging to the co-like family  and one tf belonging to the wrky family , were down-regulated in h <dig> . numerous studies in rice have indicated that wrky tfs play complicated roles in plant defense signaling. for example, oswrky <dig> and oswrky <dig> overexpression lines are more resistant to magnaporthe grisea  <cit> . plants overexpressing oswrky <dig> display enhanced resistance to virulent xoo  <cit> , and oswrky <dig> is a negative regulator of both pti and eti  <cit> . interestingly, in this study the expression levels of multiple wrky tfs related to defense response were similar in infected h <dig> and hhz . the up-regulated oswrky <dig> in h <dig> compared with hhz at  <dig> dpi was also not responsive to xoo infection, while oswrky <dig>  which was down-regulated in h <dig> compared with hhz, was inhibited by xoo infection .table  <dig>

pentatricopeptide repeat  genes target effectors to the correct site on the correct transcripts, and are thus involved in many post-transcriptional processes  <cit> . in this study, three genes encoding pprs were significantly expressed in infected h <dig> compared with hhz .

defense-related degs in the resistant and susceptible genotypes
the  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated r genes in h <dig> compared with hhz after xoo inoculation are shown in figure  <dig> and additional file 10: table s <dig>  respectively. hierarchical clustering revealed that the two samples of h <dig> infected by xoo clustered into one of two major subgroups, suggesting that h <dig> activates the expression of r genes more rapidly than its susceptible parents .figure  <dig>

 pxo <dig> inoculation. in the color panels, each horizontal line represents a single gene and the color of the line indicates the normalized expression level in a specific sample: high expression level in red, low expression level in black. the red and green bars on the right side of the heat map indicate the up-regulated and down-regulated genes, respectively, in h <dig> compared with hhz after xoo inoculation. the underlined gene id indicates that h <dig> includes the allele from donor parent psbrc <dig>  at this locus.



the  <dig> r genes up-regulated in h <dig> compared with hhz included four genes belonging to the nb-arc domain-containing protein family , three genes encoding disease resistance proteins containing lrr/nbs-lrr domains , and three genes encoding pathogenesis-related proteins   . a further analysis indicated that four  of the up-regulated r genes in h <dig> were co-localized in the introgressed regions , implying roles in xoo resistance.

prs, which are involved in plant resistance to pathogens, are commonly induced in plants resistant to pathogens of viral, fungal, and bacterial origin  <cit> . for example, pr10/bet v <dig>  which is induced in hot pepper  by incompatible interactions with xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria, may function as a ribonuclease. subsequent phosphorylation of capr10/bet v <dig> increases its ribonucleolytic activity to cleave invading viral rnas, and this activity is important to its in vivo antiviral pathway  <cit> . besides the three up-regulated genes encoding prs, the expression of three genes  encoding the pathogenesis-related bet v i family protein were inhibited in xoo-infected h <dig> 

notably, two nbs-lrr class genes  were induced in h <dig> after inoculation with xoo . loc_os05g <dig> encoded a homolog resistant to phytophthora  <dig> in arabidopsis, which positively regulates the phytophthora brassicae-induced oxidative burst and enhances expression of defense-related genes  <cit> . loc_os11g <dig>  encoding a cc-nbs-lrr disease resistance protein, was expressed at a higher level in h <dig> compared with its parents before xoo inoculation and was only induced by xoo infection in h <dig> . notably, loc_os11g <dig> was the only deg out of  <dig> up-regulated r genes located in the  <dig> -kb region  on chromosome  <dig> harboring the xa <dig> gene based on our previous fine mapping  <cit> , suggesting it was the most likely candidate gene of xa <dig> 

putative immunity mechanism of broad-spectrum resistance mediated by xa39
to explore the putative molecular networks related to the broad spectrum bshr in h <dig>  loc_os11g <dig>  was subjected to a co-expression analysis under biotic stress using the pearson correlation coefficient  cutoff of  <dig>  in the rice oligonucleotide array database   <cit> . in total,  <dig> genes overlapped with the  <dig> degs in h <dig> compared with hhz after xoo inoculation, and they were used to construct the putative genetic network related to pcd or hr that is mediated by xa <dig> . in this network, the genes could be separated into four groups according to their putative functions. group a was enriched in hormone signaling pathways and included loc_os08g <dig> , loc_os07g <dig> , and two genes, loc_os11g <dig> and loc_os11g <dig> . bak <dig> is required to initiate pti in arabidopsis  <cit> . the xa <dig> candidate gene loc_os11g <dig> , and the other two co-expressed r genes were classified into group b. in rice, a broad-spectrum panicle blast-resistance gene encodes a cc-nbs-lrr protein  <cit> . the only gene, loc_os01g <dig>  in group c, which encoded a bhlh family tf, was involved in transcriptional regulation. group d included two genes involved in ion transport  and  <dig> genes encoding proteins of unknown functions.figure  <dig>

candidate gene loc_os11g <dig>  out of all the degs in the rice introgression line h <dig> compared with recurrent parent huang-hua-zhan  after pxo <dig> inoculation, genes co-expressing with loc_os11g <dig>  were subjected to a co-expression analysis under biotic stress using the pearson correlation coefficient  cutoff  <dig>  in the rice oligonucleotide array database   <cit> . co-expression networks were constructed based on the pairwise pcc of genes with a cutoff of  <dig>  in road. four sub-groups, indicated with letters from a to d, were identified as their putative functions. the thickness of the edges is proportional to the pairwise pccs, and the full and dotted edges indicate positive and negative pccs, respectively, between the two genes in road. different shapes with different colors indicate different groups of genes based on the functional annotation. the full and open shapes indicate the genes were up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, in h <dig> compared with in hhz after pxo <dig> inoculation.



discussion
the bshr phenotype of rice il carrying xa <dig> is different from that of its parents. it is possible that a rare unequal rearrangement event, insertion, or deletion has occurred, which causes the novel resistance  <cit> . in our previous study, two genes encoding cc-nbs-lrr disease resistance proteins, loc_os11g <dig> and loc_os11g <dig>  were mapped in the  <dig> -kb region harboring the xa <dig> gene on rice chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . in this study, loc_os11g <dig> was differentially up-regulated in h <dig> compared with its parents, suggesting that the hypothetical mechanism of xa <dig> might involve this gene.

among  <dig> r genes resistant to bb, xa <dig> and xa <dig> exhibit similar bshr, with lls shorter than 1 cm  <cit> . xa <dig>  which is discussed as a putative prr, and the signaling network mediated by xa <dig> have been studied extensively  <cit> . xa21-containing rice lines also have broader resistance spectra, but the lls were longer than 5 mm when inoculated with xoo strains possessing strong virulence, including pxo <dig>  this is in accordance with pti playing a pivotal role in the defense against a broad spectrum of potential pathogens, but triggering a relatively weak immune response in contrast to eti  <cit> . to date, it has been reported that xa <dig> can be recognized by the tal effector talc9b/avrxa <dig> and triggers resistance to xoo  <cit> ; however, the signaling network leading to hr still remains to be elucidated. in this study, the comparative transcriptome profiling of h <dig> and its parents provided several interesting insights into the molecular mechanisms of bshr in rice.

first, the resistance mediated by xa <dig> might not be related to ion fluxes and oxidative bursts. the signal-specific activation of plant prrs by pamps leads to a series of cellular processes, including ion fluxes, oxidative bursts by the production of reactive oxygen species , activation of downstream mapk cascades, transcriptional changes, and the production of antimicrobial compounds, such as pr and phytoalexins  <cit> . in this study, six genes encoding prs were differentially expressed; however, there were no significant differences in the expression levels of the representative prrs of pti, genes related to oxidative burst, or downstream genes related to cell death due to ion fluxes and ros in h <dig> compared with hhz after inoculation with xoo . this suggests that hypersensitive cell death at sites of xoo infection did not result from the signal-specific activation of prrs in h <dig> 

second, ga and br signaling pathways may be involved in bshr mediated by xa <dig>  it is generally accepted that sa plays a major role in activating defenses against biotrophic pathogens, whereas ja is usually associated with defenses against necrotrophic pathogen attacks  <cit> . grewal et al.  <cit>  reported that ja and ethylene signaling were involved in the early defense of rice cells, and four overlapping genes related to ja or ethylene were up-regulated or down-regulated in h <dig> after inoculation with xoo . however, none of them showed a significantly different expression level between h <dig> and hhz after xoo inoculation . interestingly, several genes related to ga and br signaling were differentially expressed in h <dig> compared with its parents. in rice, it was inferred that the ga regulator osserk <dig> positively regulates immunity mediated by xa <dig> and xa <dig>  <cit> . loc_os11g <dig>  encoding a cc-nbs-lrr protein, is structurally related to xa <dig> and xa <dig>  and osserk1/osbak <dig> is the closest paralog to osserk <dig> in rice. interestingly, we found that there was a strong co-expression of loc_os11g <dig> and osserk1/osbak <dig> . in rice, slr <dig> , a key regulator of ga signaling, functions in disease resistance to xoo as a positive regulator through cross-talk with the ja signaling pathway via the ga receptor gid <dig>  <cit> . in this study, there were no significant differences in the expression levels of slr <dig> and gid <dig> between h <dig> and hhz; however, the ga receptor gid1l <dig> was differentially co-expressed with loc_os11g <dig>  the br signaling-related gene osbak <dig>  and br biosynthesis-related gene loc_os03g <dig> were expressed at higher levels in h <dig> compared with hhz after xoo infection . the activation of br signaling inhibits pti by the bak1-independent recognition of the fungal pamp chitin  <cit> . although the type of immunity activated by xa <dig> remains a mystery, the differential expression levels of these hormone regulators suggests that there might be cross-talk between the xa39-mediated signal transduction cascades and the ga/br signaling pathway.

finally, diverse categories of degs related to signal transduction and regulation were identified. waks span the plasma membrane, allowing cells to recognize and respond to their extracellular environment  <cit> . cpks can regulate downstream components of complex immune and stress signaling networks as positive or negative regulators  <cit> . for example, oscpk <dig> is involved in both salt-stress tolerance and blast disease resistance in rice  <cit> . several crks are reportedly associated with resistance to pathogen infection and activation of pcd in arabidopsis  <cit> , barley  <cit> , and wheat  <cit> . in this study, degs encoding lrks, waks, cpks, and crks were identified at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, indicating that a series of signaling events was regulated by complex communications at the early stage of infection in h <dig>  tfs in several families such as wrky, mads box, and nac are involved in biotic and abiotic stresses, as well as pathogen invasion  <cit> . in this study, besides the two tfs in the wrky family, tfs in b <dig>  bhlh/osiro <dig>  m-type, hrt-like, and co-like families were differentially expressed in h <dig> compared with their parents, suggesting that functions of diverse tfs in plant resistance remain to be elucidated.

hr accompanying pcd at the site of attack is an effective defense strategy against pathogens and nematodes that feed on live plant cells  <cit> . however, unlike the nucleotide binding oligomerization domain -like receptors  and lrr-containing proteins in animals, which are known to trigger cell apoptosis through the activity of caspases that activate proinflammatory cytokines  <cit> , plants lack the homologous caspases. the hypothesis that r-protein-mediated pcd might involve the perturbation of multiple cellular processes came from a report showing that in a. thaliana, the resistance conferred by the r protein rpp <dig> against the obligate biotroph hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis is not mediated by a single gene, but rather by multiple downstream genes that encode proteins   <cit> . the degs identified in this study, which might be involved in perception, signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and defense-related genes, will be studied to determine their functions and to understand the molecular networks involved in the bshr mediated by r genes in rice.

CONCLUSIONS
the bb r gene xa <dig>  which is able to trigger a resistance response to xoo characterized by pcd in rice plants, activates degs encoding proteins with diverse functions leading to brhr. these results provide novel insights into the regulatory networks of plant resistance mediated by r proteins.
