BACKGROUND
bovine tuberculosis , caused by mycobacterium bovis, has been reported to be endemic in the zambian traditional livestock sector  <cit> , with relatively high prevalence being recorded in areas within and adjacent the kafue basin  <cit> . prevalence rates at individual animal level vary from  <dig> % in low prevalence settings to  <dig> % in high prevalence settings, whilst herd level prevalence vary from  <dig> % in low prevalence settings to  <dig> % in high prevalence settings  <cit> . recent survey data suggest that areas of high prevalence settings exist within the country  <cit> . one such area being the kafue basin of zambia, were the livestock/wildlife interface forms a unique risk platform in terms of spread of infectious diseases among animals   <cit> .

btb is one of the most common abattoir findings during meat inspection and a significant reason for organ condemnation  <cit> . the lack of abattoirs in most districts, coupled with the high cost of mechanized transport, entails cattle travelling long distances "on the hoof", sometimes passing through two or more districts before reaching the abattoirs. this kind of animal movement has been identified as the major hindrance in the control of most economically important diseases of livestock in zambia  <cit> . similarly, strains of mycobacterium bovis may be spread across districts due to these uncontrolled animal movements. however, there is no information with regards to the molecular epidemiology of btb in zambia.

molecular typing techniques have contributed greatly to the knowledge of inter-bovine and interspecies transmission of bovine tuberculosis  <cit> . the most widely used dna typing techniques for m. bovis include is <dig> in restriction fragment length polymorphism  typing  <cit> , spacer oligonucleotide typing   <cit>  and variable number of tandem repeat  typing  <cit> . rflp is less desirable because it requires large amounts of dna, is not based on polymerase chain reaction , is time consuming, and poorly resolve strains of m. bovis owing to low copy numbers of is <dig> elements  <cit> . both vntr and spoligotyping are pcr based, easy to perform, require little amounts of dna, and can be used even with non-viable organisms. spoligotyping has been more widely applied in part because it is fast and more importantly the technique can simultaneously detect and differentiate m. bovis from m. tuberculosis strains  <cit> . in addition, spoligotyping patterns can be easily compared with results from other countries by use of a freely accessible international data base  <cit> .

the objective of this study was to determine the genetic diversity and relatedness of btb isolates from cattle in zambia.

RESULTS
out of the  <dig> carcasses examined,  <dig>  tissues and organs from the carcasses had gross characteristic lesions suggestive of tuberculous lesions. when subjected to culture on pyruvate enriched lowenstein jensen media, only  <dig>  of the tissues resulted in discernable colony growth with properties suggestive of mycobacteria but only  <dig>  samples were acid-fast positive by smear microscopy. out of this number,  <dig> isolates yielded interpretable spoligotypes of m. bovis with all the six major districts around the kafue basin contributing at least one isolate each; namwala , lusaka , mumbwa , monze , mazabuka , choma  . all isolates lacked the spacers  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and also from  <dig> to  <dig>  a characteristic feature that distinguishes m. bovis from m. tuberculosis  <cit> .

ten different spoligotypes were distinguished . twenty-seven isolates belonged to one cluster with more than 95% similarity ; they all have spacers  <dig>  4– <dig>  11– <dig>  17– <dig> and 25– <dig>  inside the cluster, one predominant spoligotype was found in  <dig>  of the isolates tested. it was found in animals originating from  <dig> of the  <dig> study districts. the second most prevalent spoligotype was found in isolates from three districts; c <dig> from namwala, c <dig> from choma and c <dig> from mumbwa . three isolates in the cluster, c <dig> and c <dig> from namwala and c <dig> from lusaka are closely related to each other with only spacer  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> being different .

four isolates, c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  showed a low degree of similarity with the other  <dig> isolates. isolate c <dig> from monze district and c <dig> from namwala are clearly distinct from the rest; c <dig> is lacking all the spacers from  <dig> to  <dig> .

in terms of geographic variability, namwala district had a total of  <dig> spoligotypes of which  <dig> isolates  were only present in the namwala district .

based on the global spoligotype patterns diversity provided by the international data base on spoligotyping, http://www.mbovis.org,  <dig> % of the isolates have spoligo patterns that have been described in other countries . the predominant spoligotype, widely dispersed geographically , was found in the international data base to have a pattern with a spoligotype number sb <dig> with the corresponding hexacode of 6f-5f-5f-7f-ff- <dig>  five out of the six study districts had this predominant spoligotype, and namwala district accounted for 30% of spoligotype sb <dig>  the second most predominant spoligotype had a pattern named sb <dig> with a corresponding hexacode of 6f-4f-5f-7f-ff- <dig>  isolates c <dig> was named sb <dig> with a hexacode number of 6f-5f-5f-7f-ff- <dig>  isolate c <dig> was sb <dig> with a hexacode number of 2f-5f-5f-6f-ff- <dig> and isolate c <dig> was sb <dig> with a hexacode number of 00-00-00-0f-ff- <dig>  the distribution of these spoligotypes on the international data base is shown in table  <dig>

discussion
our results do not agree with what has been found in other parts of africa  <cit> , where more than 40% of the animals with tuberculous lesions had non-tuberculous mycobacteria . in this study, only two animals had mycobacteria other than m. bovis. however, our findings tie up with a similar study conducted in algeria  <cit> . whereas excluding the differences in bacterial species as accounting for these observations  <cit> , strain isolation has been found to be dependant on the specific type of media used  <cit> . the usage of specific culture media such as stonebrink has been shown to increase the recovery and discrimination of strains on culture  <cit> . however, in this study, the use of lowenstein jensen media with pyruvate enrichment may to a lesser extent account for the low numbers of ntms although not conclusively established. this study is the first of its kind in zambia to describe the molecular typing of m.bovis isolates from indigenous cattle breeds originating from high prevalence settings.

characterization of m. bovis strains based on different geographical locations by districts or region is pivotal in understanding the molecular epidemiology of btb  <cit> . it further helps in understanding the dynamics of disease dispersion which are difficult to appreciate through traditional epidemiological investigative tools. however, through the use of modern molecular epidemiological tools such as spoligotyping, we have been able to demonstrate the presence as well as the specific existing strains of mycobacterium bovis in zambian cattle. the technique has shade more light on the strain diversity, distribution and relatedness within zambia and globally. two dominant spoligotypes were identified representing the majority of isolates analyzed. these findings intimate a degree of homogeneity among m. bovis isolates in zambia. however, when distinguishing between unrelated strains through the application of the hunter-gaston discriminatory index  <cit> , the spoligotyping technique in this particular case was found to have a good discrimination power. the index indicated that 98% of the strains had an equal chance of having different spoligo patterns if randomly sampled.

of the  <dig> m. bovis isolates that yielded interpretable spoligotypes,  <dig> different patterns were detected. based on the global spoligotype patterns diversity provided by the international data base on spoligotyping, http://www.mbovis.org,  <dig> % of the isolates have been described. the predominant spoligotype that was widely dispersed geographically was found on the international data base to have a pattern with a spoligotype number sb <dig>  this spoligotype is similar to the spoligotype of the vaccine strain bcg type, and previously described in france, belgium, south africa, the netherlands, sri lanka, spain, japan, portugal, russia, iran, denmark, china and brazil http://www.mbovis.org <cit> . the second most predominant spoligotype had a pattern previously numbered sb <dig> and has been described from france. these predominant patterns, sb <dig> and sb <dig>  differ only by a single spacer . the most common spoligotype, sb <dig>  has a considerable degree of geographical dispersion in zambia, being detected in  <dig> out of the  <dig> districts, and has further been shown to be common in other countries including continental europe  <cit> . this finding of strains from europe may suggest the introduction of the disease by early european settlers to africa, a finding that has been highlighted by different workers  <cit> . the finding of sb <dig> in south africa strongly infers to this probability, when tracing the early migration routes of colonial settlers to zambia. in our current study,  <dig> %  of the isolates had spoligotypes that were unique to zambia. these spoligotypes were newly described considering that no previous information of their registration on the international data base existed. these patterns  reveal deletion events that could have lead to new spoligotype patterns evolving, as was the case in portugal  <cit> . however, more detailed studies need to be conducted to fully ascertain this assertion.

the sharing of grazing land in the kafue basin in zambia between cattle and kafue lechwe antelopes , considered as wildlife biological reservoir hosts for btb, might explain the high prevalence levels found in this setting  <cit> . underlying factors in sustaining the infectious agent depend on the temporal and spatial distribution between the source of infection and the susceptible animals, which also are a function of the duration of interaction between the agent, the susceptible host and its environment  <cit> . the underlying factors for btb transmission between the lechwe antelopes and cattle are reported to be optimal in the kafue basin  <cit> , although further investigations at molecular level will be necessary to elucidate this relationship.

the tracing of livestock movement patterns from their areas of origin to major abattoirs is important in understanding possible disease dispersion patterns. cattle traders trek for days from areas within and around the kafue basin to abattoirs in the nearby districts <cit> . in our study, we observed that identical and closely related strains were also found in other districts. these findings suggest the sharing of strains between districts, a finding which is important when determining btb localization or spread.

namwala district   <cit>  was found to have more isolates than any other district. the practice of allowing trekking animals to spend one or more nights in different kraals during the journey to abattoirs may partially be responsible for the dissemination of the infectious organisms. this pattern of animal movements may to a greater extent be responsible to the observed dispersion of spoligotype patterns suggestively, based on our results from the namwala district zones to other surrounding districts. however, these results need to be interpreted with caution considering limitations related to the survey period and sample size related to limited resources and time constraints. this makes the results a bit difficult to interpret when inferring to the entire region given the representativeness of the sample size. in addition, the spoligotyping technique has weaknesses in that it has a low discriminatory power  <cit>  which may result in low specificity of some patterns with a possibility of grouping strains that might not be identical when typed by other methods. however, the results obtained in this study give an indication of m. bovis strains in cattle with an insight in the likely role that cattle movements have on the dissemination of the disease.

these findings are useful in assisting policy makers when considering the formulation of control measures for btb in zambian cattle. it is important for policy makers to base their control polices on researched scientific evidence. this study has highlighted that unrestricted cattle movements to abattoirs may play a major contributory role in the dissemination of btb. thus policy makers should consider building abattoirs in all areas of high cattle production and further formulate a policy that will stop cattle movements "on the hoof" which will compel cattle owners to use trucks when transporting animals to abattoirs.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has described spoligotypes of m.bovis in zambian cattle for the first time, and has identified five spoligotypes that are specific to the country. the observation of an overlap in the spoligotype pattern sb <dig> in  <dig> of the  <dig> districts suggests a possible common source of infection.
