BACKGROUND
double labeling is a powerful tool in microscopy, and there are many pairs of fps that can be used for dual labeling in wide field and confocal microscopy. however, most two-photon microscopes are fitted with only one expensive, femtosecond laser, making dual-imaging with fluorescent proteins  difficult. the difficulty stems from the fact that a single excitation wavelength rarely produces well-separated fluorescence emission spectra. one solution is to use spectral unmixing of overlapping emission profiles. a drawback of this method is that it requires multiple detectors, which results in a loss of speed and sensitivity. a more traditional approach has been to find a pair of fps with similar absorption wavelengths and large differences in their stokes shifts  such that a single excitation wavelength can produce well-separated emission spectra. recently, kawano et al. have proposed the use of the egfp/mkeima combination at excitation wavelengths  where the lowest-energy, or long wavelength transitions of their chromophores overlap  <cit> . the discrimination of fluorescence signals is possible thanks to the extremely large  stokes shift of mkeima  <cit> . the applicability of this approach is limited because large differences in stokes shifts are not common among fp pairs, and mkeima and egfp have relatively low two-photon absorption efficiency, or cross sections, at the optimal wavelength of excitation   <cit> .

recently, we performed a detailed characterization of the two-photon absorption  properties of a series of orange and red fps over a wide range of wavelengths   <cit> . the spectra reveal optimal wavelengths for excitation, new excitable two-photon transitions, and the best absorbing and brightest fps in the series for use in two-photon laser scanning microscopy   <cit> . one of the proteins, tagrfp  <cit> , has a high two-photon cross section in the range of 700- <dig> nm  <cit> . the two-photon absorption at this range of wavelengths is due to a higher-energy, or short wavelength transition of the tagrfp chromophore and is within the range of the mode-locked ti:sapphire lasers commonly found on commercially available two-photon microscopes.

we reasoned that if we could identify a fp with a strong lowest-energy, short wavelength transition, in the same  <dig> -  <dig> nm region, it would provide an ideal partner with tagrfp for two-photon dual-color imaging. in search of this partner fp we have collected 2pa spectra for a series of recently developed blue, teal, and green fps  <cit> . these proteins are photostable, ph insensitive, have relatively high quantum yields and extinction coefficients, and work well in fusion tags .

RESULTS
the fps studied have the advantage that the longer wavelength 2pa band of their chromophores lies within the tuning range of commercial ti:sapphire lasers commonly used in tplsm. all of the fps exhibit relatively high 2pa efficiency . inspection of figure  <dig> and table  <dig> reveals that the fps in the ebfp series  have very similar cross section values of the order of  <dig> gm at ~ <dig> nm. because of its high quantum yield and photostability  <cit> , ebfp <dig> should be well-suited for tplsm. the proteins in the mtfp series, g <dig>  g <dig>  and mwasabi, all of which contain the egfp phenolate chromophore, have significant differences in their cross section values and optimal wavelengths of excitation. out of this series, mtfp <dig> has the highest cross section, σ <dig> ~ <dig> gm, and g <dig> the lowest, σ <dig> ~ <dig> gm. mtfp <dig>  absorbs at the shortest wavelength,  <dig> nm, and g <dig> at the longest wavelength at  <dig> nm. for imaging applications mtfp <dig> and mwasabi may be preferred due to their high quantum yields and photostability  <cit> . two fps, mkalama <dig> and mametrine, contain the gfp phenol chromophore. mkalama <dig> has a cross section of ~ <dig> gm at  <dig> nm and absorbs fairly well at longer wavelengths. mametrine absorbs optimally at  <dig> nm and has a cross section of  <dig> gm. for comparison, mcerulean and ecfp , whose 2pa peaks also lie within the range of common ti:sapphire lasers, have cross section values of ~ <dig> gm at  <dig> nm.

unlike many of the orange and red fps  <cit> , the higher-energy electronic  transitions of the proteins studied here are weaker than the lowest-energy electronic  transitions, and only the ebfp series, ecfp, and mcerulean demonstrate moderate resonant enhancement of the blue side of the s0→sn band. these results agree with quantum chemical calculations of the 2pa transitions present in these chromophores  <cit> . note that the data shown here were collected only at wavelengths where the fluorescence signal showed a quadratic dependence on laser power, indicating that only two-photon absorption contributed to the signal.

these spectra reveal that mkalama <dig> is particularly well suited as a partner with tagrfp in two-photon dual-color imaging. figure  <dig> shows the 2pa spectra of tagrfp  and mkalama <dig>  grouped together with their corresponding fluorescence emission spectra . for reference, the different electronic transitions present in the fp chromophores are marked with arrows. the lowest-energy electronic  transition of mkalama <dig> overlaps significantly with a higher-energy electronic  transition of tagrfp. at an excitation wavelength of  <dig> nm, tagrfp possesses a cross section of ~ <dig> gm and two photon brightness of ~ <dig> gm, and mkalama <dig> a cross section of ~ <dig> gm and two-photon brightness of  <dig> gm. note also that the fluorescence emission spectra are well separated with a  <dig> nm spread between the peaks, despite neither fp having a large stokes shift . figure  <dig> shows a jablonski diagram depicting the electronic transitions in the mkalama <dig> and tagrfp chromophores upon excitation with  <dig> nm light. note that fluorescence only occurs from the s <dig> state  <cit>  and the emitted photons differ significantly in energy. when the excitation laser is tuned to  <dig> nm, it should excite both fps, and band pass filters should make it possible to detect the two different emissions simultaneously. to test this approach, we transiently expressed tagrfp and mkalama <dig> in different hek <dig> cells and mixed them. figure  <dig> is an image of that mixture excited at  <dig> nm with  <dig> -  <dig> nm and  <dig> -  <dig> nm emission filters. to quantify the ability to detect each signal independently, we plotted each pixel in the image . because of the red shoulder in the mkalama <dig> emission spectrum there was some cross talk such that very bright blue signals were detected slightly by the red detector.

CONCLUSIONS
freed from the constraint of having to find fp pairs with large differences in stokes shifts it is now possible to use fps with higher two-photon cross sections and two-photon brightness. the higher excited state revealed in the tagrfp spectrum  <cit>  makes it possible to couple this bright two-photon probe with mkalama <dig> such that a single wavelength can excite both optimally. the blue emission of mkalama <dig> is a limitation to this approach because of potential scattering and absorption in deep tissue imaging applications. this limitation, however, is balanced by the advantages of two photon excitation and access to multicolor imaging with only one laser. further, the method of exploiting the different excitable transitions of fps for simultaneous imaging is highly extensible, and one can easily imagine finding fp pairs with favorable properties such as further red shifted excitations and emissions, , greater photostability, and higher two-photon brightness.
