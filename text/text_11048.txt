BACKGROUND
embryonic stem cells  are able to self-renew and differentiate in vitro, giving rise to all the cell types of the embryo, thus mimicking the events that take place in vivo during the early stages of development. while enormous progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms that sustain esc pluripotency  <cit> , the processes governing the exit of escs from the pluripotent state and the early steps of differentiation are still not well understood. it is well established that activation of the erk and gsk3β pathways is necessary for lineage commitment of escs  <cit> , and that mapk phosphatases have an important role in the downregulation of erk signaling  <cit> . recent results indicate that redistribution of βhlh transcription factor  tfe <dig> from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, driven by folliculin/fnip <dig> and tsc <dig>  is necessary for the exit from the pluripotent state  <cit> . another βhlh tf, tcf <dig>  primes escs for differentiation by downregulating nanog and inducing otx <dig>  <cit> . of particular interest is the role of otx <dig>  this tf, alone and in combination with oct <dig>  regulates a complex array of genes that marks the very early steps of exit from pluripotency and the acquisition of early post-implantation epiblast cell state  . induction of otx <dig> expression and its engagement to genomic loci occur very early during the exit of mouse escs from the ground state of pluripotency, indicating that otx <dig> acts as a pioneer to engage and activate silent enhancers. however, while accumulation of otx <dig> clearly contributes to its own activity, how otx <dig> engages new enhancers and stably associates with them remains unclear.

the high-mobility group  family of proteins form an abundant, heterogeneous, non-histone component of chromatin. hmga members of this family are highly expressed during embryogenesis and their expression becomes more restricted as fetal development progresses, with low or undetectable expression in adults  <cit> , and becomes abundant in malignant cells in vitro and in vivo, where they have been extensively studied  <cit> . the high expression of hmga proteins during embryogenesis suggests that they fulfill important roles in development. indeed, it has been recently reported that the hmga1/hmga <dig> double knockout  mice showed high embryonic lethality  <cit> .

hmga proteins lack transcriptional activity per se, but act by orchestrating the assembly of transcription factor complexes also known as enhanceosomes  <cit> . they preferentially bind to a/t-rich sequences in close proximity to, or overlapping with, the binding sites of sequence-specific tfs and favor the formation of multi-subunit protein-dna complexes by modifying the chromatin structure in an atp-independent fashion  <cit> . one example of the function of hmga proteins is that of the ifn-β gene promoter. upon viral infection, the transcription of the ifn-β gene depends on the recruitment of several tfs, including nfkb, to an enhancer region positioned in the ifn-β gene promoter. the assembly of this complex is dependent on the interaction of hmga <dig> with an a/t-rich sequence present in the promoter  <cit> . another well-studied example of the role of hmga in enhanceosome formation is that of the il-2rα gene. in this case, hmga <dig> is upregulated upon stimulation of t cells and binds to a/t-rich sequences in the il-2rα gene promoter. this recruitment induces a chromatin remodeling that allows several tfs, like elf- <dig>  stat <dig> and others, to interact with their cognate cis-elements, which become accessible only as a consequence of hmga1-dna interaction  <cit> . in the case of the il-2rα gene promoter, and also in the case of the α-b-crystallin gene  <cit> , hmga proteins interact with a/t-rich sequences positioned on the surface of, or close to, positioned nucleosomes which hamper the binding of sequence-specific tfs. one of the effects of hmga seems to be that of removing the nucleosomal constraints that prevent the formation of the tf-dna complexes  <cit> .

here, we show that hmga <dig> accumulates upon the induction of mouse esc differentiation and its suppression interferes with the transition of escs into the epiblast-like state. hmga <dig> gene transcription is regulated by otx <dig> and accumulating hmga <dig> cooperates with otx <dig> in the pioneering activity that allows the switching on of new enhancers that regulate change in the gene expression program that ultimately governs the exit from the pluripotent ground state of escs.

RESULTS
hmga <dig> suppression interferes with esc differentiation
the screening of  <dig>  shrnas interfering with  <dig>  independent transcripts, aimed at searching for factors involved in the differentiation of escs  <cit> , allowed us to identify, among numerous factors that hamper esc differentiation, the hmga <dig> gene. using an esc line in which gfp is under the control of the nanog gene promoter, we found that, at 8 days after the induction of differentiation, the number of undifferentiated cells, thus still expressing gfp, was significantly higher in hmga <dig> knockdown  cells than in control shrna-transfected cells, while the number of differentiated β3-tubulin positive cells was decreased . to measure the effects of hmga <dig> suppression, we induced the differentiation of the e14tg2a esc line through the formation of serum-free embryoid bodies . as shown in fig. 1b, wildtype  sfebs express differentiation-specific markers, like the neural precursor marker sox <dig>  starting around day  <dig> of differentiation, while the inner part of the sfebs contains small groups of cells that express stemness markers like oct <dig> and nanog. the silencing of hmga <dig> with sirnas caused an evident change in the sfeb phenotype, which showed a decreased number of sox <dig> positive cells and a great increase of cells that continue to express pluripotency markers . according to the results of immunostaining, at 4 days of differentiation, sfebs derived from hmga <dig> kd cells showed higher levels of oct <dig> and nanog mrnas than control sirna-transfected cells . furthermore, rex <dig> and klf <dig>  specific markers of undifferentiated escs, which are switched off as soon as escs differentiate  <cit> , were still significantly expressed in hmga <dig> kd cells . in another mouse esc line, mpi, the silencing of hmga <dig> affected differentiation, with a phenotype very similar to that observed in the e14tg2a line: the stemness markers remained elevated up to 4 days after the induction of differentiation, while the neural precursor marker sox <dig> failed to accumulate to the levels observed in the cells transfected with the control sirnas .fig.  <dig> hmga <dig> suppression interferes with embryonic stem cell  differentiation. a escs expressing gfp under the control of nanog gene promoter were transfected with the control shrna  and two different shrnas targeting hmga <dig>  which induced a significant decrease of the hmga <dig> protein. knockdown cells were induced to differentiate into neurons. after 8 days of differentiation, cells were harvested and the number of gfp expressing cells was measured by facs, subtracting the fluorescent background of parental differentiated e14tg2a escs. the histogram shows the percentage of gfp-positive cells in the indicated samples as mean ± sem . *p < <dig> . the efficiency of neuron formation was evaluated at 10 days of differentiation by staining the cells with a neuro-specific antibody . scale bars: 250 μm. b analysis of the phenotype induced by hmga <dig> suppression during neuroectodermal differentiation of escs. escs were transfected with the indicated sirna, and induced to differentiate through serum-free embryoid body  formation for  <dig> and 4 days. sectioned sfebs were then subjected to immunostaining to analyze the presence of stemness  and neuroectodermal  markers. scale bars: 100 μm. the histograms represent the percentage of oct4-, nanog-, and sox1-positive cells counted in more than six independent fields. *p < <dig> , **p < <dig> . the efficiency of hmga <dig> silencing by sirna was measured by western blot. c qpcr analysis of the expression changes of oct <dig>  nanog, rex <dig>  and klf <dig> in differentiated escs upon suppression of hmga <dig>  data represent mean of three independent experiments  ± sem. *p < <dig> . **p < <dig> . d mpi escs were transfected with a control sirna or a specific hmga <dig> sirna and induced to differentiate into sfebs. at 4 days of differentiation, sfebs were collected and the expression of the indicated markers was analyzed by qpcr and western blot. data represent mean of three independent experiments  ± sem. *p < <dig> . e qpcr analysis of the expression of oct <dig>  nanog, rex <dig>  and klf <dig> in undifferentiated escs upon suppression of hmga <dig>  data represent mean of independent experiments  ± sem. *p < <dig> . f representative images of the double staining of undifferentiated escs with nanog  and hmga <dig>  antibodies. the arrows indicate cells expressing hmga <dig>  which corresponds to cells expressing the lowest level of nanog. scale bars: 20 μm



hmga <dig> kd does not significantly modify the expression of stemness markers in undifferentiated cells. however, a slight increase in nanog expression upon hmga <dig> kd was always detected after 24 hours of sirna transfection . co-immunostaining of wt escs with nanog and hmga <dig> antibodies confirmed the wide spectrum of nanog expression, which varied from very high expression to barely detectable levels, according to the metastable state of undifferentiated escs  <cit> . these experiments showed rare hmga <dig> positive cells  that correspond to cells expressing very low levels of nanog . these results indicate the existence, in undifferentiated escs, of a small sub-population of ‘low’ nanog cells that co-express hmga <dig> 

all these results indicate that most cells in hmga <dig> kd sfebs have a phenotype more similar to undifferentiated escs, marked by the expression of oct <dig>  nanog, rex <dig>  and klf <dig>  than to differentiated cells, thus suggesting that hmga <dig> kd interferes with the first phase of differentiation, i.e. the transition of escs from the pluripotent ground state into the epiblast-like state.

hmga <dig> suppression interferes with the transition of escs into epilcs
to explore this possibility in a more homogenous system, we induced esc differentiation in culture conditions that stabilize the epilc state  <cit> . as expected, around day  <dig> after the induction of the differentiation in wt cells, rex <dig>  klf <dig>  oct <dig>  and nanog decreased, and fgf <dig>  oct <dig>  specific markers of the epiblast, accumulated . the silencing of hmga <dig> results in a less pronounced accumulation of fgf <dig>  oct <dig>  while rex <dig> and klf <dig> remained significantly expressed . in addition, oct <dig> and nanog levels were higher in hmga <dig> kd epilcs than in control cells . the ectopic expression of the hmga <dig> cdna, insensitive to silencing, rescued the accumulation of the epiblast markers and the downregulation of esc-specific stemness markers . in summary, these results indicate that, following the induction of differentiation, hmga <dig> kd cells remain more similar to undifferentiated escs than to epilcs, thus suggesting that hmga <dig> is necessary for the exit of escs from the pluripotent ground state.fig.  <dig> hmga <dig> suppression interferes with the transition of embryonic stem cells  into epiblast-like stem cells . a qpcr analysis to compare the expression levels of the indicated genes in escs versus epilcs. data are reported as means  ± sem of biological replicates. b comparison of the gene expression changes of esc  and epilc  markers in escs and epilcs upon hmga <dig> silencing. data are reported as means  ± sem of biological replicates . c western blot analysis to measure the expression level of oct <dig>  nanog, and hmga <dig> in epilcs derived from escs transfected with the indicated sirnas. d gene expression changes as a consequence of hmga <dig> knockdown in epilcs transfected with gfp  or hmga <dig> under the control of the β-actin gene promoter. qpcr data are reported as mean of relative mrna expression ± sem of biological replicates . *p < <dig> , **p < <dig> , ns: not significant



hmga <dig> null induced pluripotent stem cells  fail to exit from the pluripotent ground state
to study esc differentiation in the absence of hmga <dig>  we generated ipscs from embryonic fibroblasts  of hmga <dig> ko embryos. we found that the absence of hmga <dig> resulted in a reduced reprogramming efficiency, as demonstrated by the decreased number of alkaline phosphatase positive colonies compared to ipscs derived from wt mefs  and by the decreased number of nanog-positive cells . undifferentiated hmga <dig> ko ipscs grown under 2i conditions appeared indistinguishable from the wt ipscs, with a normal pattern of expression of pluripotency markers . by using the cfse proliferation assay, we found that the proliferation rate of hmga <dig> ko ipscs, grown in undifferentiated or differentiated conditions, was not distinguishable from that of wt ipscs . however, when we induced hmga <dig> ko ipscs to differentiate as sfebs by removing the two inhibitors, we observed an almost complete block of differentiation. in contrast to the high number of sox1-positive cells observed in differentiated wt ipscs, almost all hmga <dig> ko cells remained positive to oct <dig>  with only rare cells expressing sox <dig> . furthermore, western blot analyses showed that both oct <dig> and nanog are higher in sfebs from hmga <dig> ko ipscs than in those derived from wt ipscs, and confirmed the absence of sox <dig> induction . accordingly, mrna levels of rex <dig> and klf <dig> remained elevated, while those of pax <dig> were not induced . this phenotype was consistent among several independent hmga <dig> ko ipsc clones and is maintained at least until 8 days of differentiation, the time required for neuron formation in wt cells .fig.  <dig> induced pluripotent stem cells  derived from hmga <dig> knockout  embryonic fibroblasts  are unable to properly differentiate. a ipsc clones derived from wildtype  and hmga <dig> ko  mefs and grown under 2i + leukemia inhibitory factor  conditions are induced to differentiate into neuroectoderm through serum-free embryoid body  formation for 4 days. sectioned sfebs were stained for neuroectodermal  and stemness  markers. scale bars: 100 μm. b western blot analysis to evaluate the expression of the indicated proteins in 4 day-differentiated sfebs derived from different wt and hmga <dig> ko ipsc clones and qpcr analysis of the indicated mrnas. qpcr data are reported as means of relative mrna expression ± sem of two biological replicates for each of the indicated wt or hmga <dig> ko ipsc clones. c the expression of the endodermal marker gata  <dig> was evaluated by qpcr in wt and ko hmga <dig> ipscs after 4 days of differentiation as sfebs. qpcr data represent mean ± sd  for each of the indicated wt or hmga <dig> ko ipsc clones. d different clones of wt and hmga <dig> ko ipscs were induced to differentiate into cardiomyocytes through the hanging drops method. histogram reports the percentage of embryoid bodies showing rhythmically contracting areas  on day  <dig> of differentiation. e immunofluorescence analysis showing the extent of the areas positive for the cardiac ventricular marker myosin mlc2v or the stemness marker oct <dig> in wt and hmga <dig> ko ipscs differentiated for 13 days through the hanging drop method. f the expression of the stemness markers was measured by qpcr analysis in wt and hmga <dig> ko ipscs differentiated for 13 days through the hanging drop method. qpcr data represent mean ± sd  for each of the indicated wt or hmga <dig> ko ipsc clones. g the expression of oct <dig> and nanog was analyzed by western blot in wt and hmga <dig> ko clones induced to differentiate into epilcs. the relative expression of the indicated genes was measured by qpcr analysis in epilcs obtained from wt and hmga <dig> ko ipsc clones. qpcr data represent means of independent experiments  ± sd for each of the indicated wt or hmga <dig> ko ipsc clones. h the relative expression of pax <dig>  sox <dig>  and gata <dig> was measured by qpcr analysis in sfebs obtained from wt and hmga <dig> ko ipsc clones, stably transfected with an hmga <dig> or gfp  under the control of β-actin gene promoter. qpcr data represent the mean of three independent experiments  ± sem for each of the indicated wt or hmga <dig> ko ipsc clones. *p < <dig> . the expression levels of endogenous hmga <dig>  and of the transfected form  are reported in the western blot. i the relative expression of fgf <dig> and oct <dig> was measured by qpcr analysis in epilcs obtained from wt and hmga <dig> ko ipsc clones, stably transfected with hmga <dig> or gfp  under the control of β-actin gene promoter. qpcr data represent mean ± sem of three independent experiments  for each of the indicated wt or hmga <dig> ko ipsc clones. *p < <dig> . j wt and hmga <dig> ko ipscs, transfected or not with hmga <dig> cdna, were induced to differentiate into cardiomyocytes through the hanging drops method. the histogram reports the percentage of embryoid bodies showing rhythmically contracting areas  on day  <dig> of differentiation



the absence of hmga <dig> also impairs the formation of other lineages. indeed, we found that the appearance of gata <dig>  a marker of endoderm, is significantly compromised in hmga <dig> ko sfebs . moreover, as reported in fig. 3d,e, the absence of hmga <dig> resulted in an almost complete failure of the expression of cardio-specific myosin and of the generation of beating cardiomyocytes. this phenomenon is again accompanied by a sustained expression of stemness markers .

subsequently, we studied the phenotype of hmga <dig> null ipscs induced to differentiate into epilcs. in these conditions, the hmga <dig> ko resulted in an almost complete block of differentiation as demonstrated by the observation that, compared to wt cells, oct <dig>  nanog, and rex <dig> are still expressed at high levels and the accumulation of fgf <dig>  oct <dig>  and dnmt3b was strongly reduced . to address whether hmga <dig> re-expression in hmga <dig> null ipscs could rescue the differentiation ability, we generated hmga <dig> ko and wt ipsc clones stably transfected with hmga <dig> or gfp, as a control. as shown in fig. 3h,i, the re-expression of hmga <dig> rescued the expression of the neuroectodermal differentiation markers pax <dig> and sox <dig> and the endodermal marker gata <dig>  when the cells were differentiated as sfebs, and of the epiblast markers fgf <dig>  oct <dig>  and dnmt3b, when the cells were induced to differentiate into epilcs. hmga <dig> re-expression in hmga <dig> null ipscs also rescued the ability of the cells to differentiate into cardiomyocytes .

altogether, the results described above demonstrated that hmga <dig> is necessary for the transition from escs into epilcs.

otx <dig> controls hmga <dig> gene expression in epilcs
several recent papers have demonstrated that otx <dig> plays a key role in the exit of escs from the pluripotent ground state . the analysis of the phenotype of otx <dig> ko escs  confirmed that otx <dig> is required to allow proper esc differentiation and in particular the transition from escs into epilcs  <cit> . the possibility that these two proteins may functionally interact is further supported by their expression profiles: during sfeb differentiation, oct <dig> and nanog levels rapidly decline, becoming undetectable at day  <dig>  while otx <dig> increases at day  <dig>  maintains high levels of expression up to day  <dig> and, at later time points, decreases at both the protein and mrna levels . hmga <dig> protein is undetectable by western blot in undifferentiated escs, appears soon after induction of differentiation of escs into sfebs , accumulates up to day  <dig>  and subsequently decreases. similarly, the transition of escs into epilcs was accompanied by the accumulation of hmga <dig> . in both cases, the induction of otx <dig> slightly precedes that of hmga <dig> fig.  <dig> otx <dig> controls hmga <dig> expression in epiblast-like stem cells . a phenotypic analysis of otx <dig> knockout  and wildtype  differentiated embryonic stem cells . the indicated markers were analyzed by qpcr at 4 days of differentiation as serum-free embryoid bodies  or into epilcs. qpcr data represent the means of independent biological replicates  ± sem. *p < <dig> , **p < <dig> . b western blot analysis of undifferentiated and differentiated escs. expression levels of hmga <dig>  oct <dig>  and otx <dig> were measured in undifferentiated escs, during neuroectodermal differentiation through sfebs and in epilcs. c expression profile of otx <dig>  oct <dig>  and hmga <dig> mrnas at the indicated time points during esc differentiation analyzed by qpcr. data represent mean ± sd from two independent biological replicates . d otx <dig> mrna levels in undifferentiated escs and in sfebs at day  <dig> transfected with control or hmga <dig> sirnas. data represent mean ± sd from two independent biological replicates . e oct <dig> and otx <dig> expression in sfebs at  <dig> and 4 days of differentiation derived from escs transfected with the indicated sirnas. f wt and otx <dig> ko escs were induced to differentiate into sfebs for 4 days. the expression of hmga <dig> was analyzed by qpcr. data represent mean of three independent experiments  ± sem. **p < <dig> . g hmga <dig> protein levels were measured in wt and otx <dig> ko undifferentiated escs and 4-day differentiated sfebs. h otx <dig> association with the genomic region upstream hmga <dig>  chip-qpcr analysis of otx <dig> binding to the genomic region upstream the transcriptional start site of hmga <dig>  in epilcs. qpcr data represent mean of four independent experiments  ± sem



the suppression of hmga <dig>  which strongly affects the gene expression profiles of differentiating escs , had no effects on the expression profile of otx <dig>  during differentiation, otx <dig> accumulates in hmga <dig> kd cells to the same extent as in wt cells . conversely, we observed that hmga <dig> mrna and protein were decreased in otx <dig> ko sfebs . by examining previously published chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing  data where otx <dig> gene targets were analyzed, we found that hmga <dig> is one of the candidate targets  <cit> . chip experiments in wt epilcs allowed us to observe that otx <dig> binds to a region upstream of the transcriptional start site in the hmga <dig> gene, confirming the previously published chip-seq data . inspection of this dna sequence demonstrated the presence of a bona fide cis-element for otx <dig> that could be responsible for the regulation of this gene upon differentiation of escs. these findings can explain, at least in part, the changes in expression of hmga <dig> during the first steps of differentiation.

hmga <dig> assists otx <dig> in the pioneering of new enhancers
during the transition from escs to epilcs, many gene promoters are bound by otx <dig> alone or by otx <dig> and oct <dig>  <cit> . the presence of otx <dig> both in escs and epilcs suggests that otx <dig> is likely to require additional factors to access its cognate cis-elements. of note, one of the best documented functions of hmg proteins is to assist the engagement of transcription factors to inducible gene promoter regions, thus leading to the formation of the so called enhanceosomes. this function requires the association of hmg proteins with the minor grove of a/t-rich dna sequences, close to or overlapping with the cis-elements targeted by specific tfs. no clear consensus binding sequence has been found in the published chip experiments of hmga <dig> association to chromatin in a human tumor cell line  <cit>  except for a/t-rich stretches. the otx <dig> consensus binding motif contains 4– <dig> consecutive a = t pairs  <cit> . thus, we looked at the possible interaction of hmga <dig> with otx <dig> binding sites. we first assessed, in stabilized epilcs derived from e14tg2a or wt ipscs, the association of hmga <dig> with several loci included in the published list of otx <dig> chip-seq targets and we found that hmga <dig> was always associated with otx <dig> binding sites such as, for example, enhancers of the hells, slc16a <dig>  plekha <dig>  fgf <dig>  and myrf genes . we then examined whether hmga <dig> suppression by rnai affects the expression of otx <dig> targets and found a decreased expression of all the genes analyzed . similarly, in hmga <dig> ko ipscs the expression of otx <dig> target genes was greatly decreased .fig.  <dig> hmga <dig> is involved in the regulation of otx <dig> target genes upon the exit of embryonic stem cells  from the pluripotent ground state. a chip-qpcr analysis of the association of hmga <dig> to gene targets of otx <dig> in wildtype  epiblast-like stem cells . the negative control  corresponds to the region  <dig>  kb upstream of the hmga <dig> transcriptional start site. qpcr data represent means of three independent experiments  ± sem. b chip-qpcr analysis of the association of hmga <dig> to gene targets of otx <dig> in wt induced pluripotent stem cells  induced to differentiate. qpcr data represent means of two independent experiments  ± sd. c the relative level of the indicated mrnas was measured by qpcr in epilcs derived from escs transfected with si ctrl and si hmga <dig>  qpcr data represent mean of three independent experiments  ± sem. *p < <dig> , **p < <dig> . d qpcr analysis of the expression of the indicated genes in wt and hmga <dig> ko ipsc clones differentiated into epilcs. qpcr data represent means of two independent experiments  ± sd for each of the indicated wt or hmga <dig> ko ipsc clones



these results suggest a close relationship between otx2-dependent gene regulation and the availability of hmga <dig> bound to otx <dig> cis-elements. therefore, we asked whether hmga <dig> cooperates with otx <dig> by influencing its capacity to engage new enhancers. to address this possibility, we explored whether suppression of hmga <dig> affects binding of otx <dig> to its cognate loci. chip experiments, performed in epilcs derived from hmga <dig> kd cells, showed that the binding of otx <dig> to selected targets is significantly decreased . when we tested hmga <dig> null cells, the binding of otx <dig> to its targets was greatly decreased or almost completely abolished .fig.  <dig> hmga <dig> is necessary for the pioneering activity of otx <dig> in the engagement of new enhancers during the transition from embryonic stem cells  into epiblast-like stem cells . a otx <dig> association with the indicated genes upon hmga <dig> silencing. escs transfected with si ctrl or si hmga <dig> were induced to differentiate into epilcs and the otx <dig> binding to the enhancers of indicated genes was measured by chip-qpcr. data are presented as mean ± sem of independent biological replicates . *p < <dig> , **p < <dig> . b chip-qpcr analysis of the binding of otx <dig> to the enhancers of the indicated genes in epilcs derived from wt and hmga <dig> ko induced pluripotent stem cell  clones. qpcr data represent mean of two independent experiments  ± sd for each of the indicated wt or hmga <dig> ko ipsc clones. c otx <dig> mrna and protein expression levels in wt and ko ipscs induced to differentiate into epilcs. qpcr data are means of three independent experiments  ± sd



the decreased binding of otx <dig> to cognate cis-elements in hmga <dig> kd and ko cells did not depend on a lack of induction of otx <dig>  indeed, as shown in fig. 6c, the behavior of otx <dig> upon the induction of differentiation was identical in wt and in hmga <dig> ko cells. furthermore, the ability of otx <dig> to associate with chromatin in undifferentiated conditions  was not modified by the suppression of hmga <dig> .

in wt cells, the binding of otx <dig> was accompanied by the activation of the enhancers, as demonstrated by the increased acetylation of h3k <dig>  while in hmga <dig> ko cells, the decreased binding of otx <dig> resulted in decreased levels of h3k27ac . therefore, the decrease or the absence of hmga <dig> reduces the engagement and the activation of new enhancers by otx <dig>  upon the induction of differentiation. we also explored the effects of hmga <dig> ko on an otx2-independent enhancer, present upstream of the oct <dig> gene  <cit> , which is activated upon the exit from the naïve state. as shown in fig. 7b, the absence of hmga <dig> caused a decrease of the oct <dig> enhancer activation, as demonstrated by the reduced levels of h3k27ac marker, although hmga <dig> is not associated with this enhancer in wt cells. this phenomenon is likely a consequence of the phenotype caused by the suppression of hmga <dig>  i.e. a general impairment of the transition into the epiblast-like state.fig.  <dig> enhancer activation in wildtype  and hmga <dig> knockout  cells. a the activation of the indicated enhancers was analyzed by measuring the levels of h3k27ac by chip-qpcr in undifferentiated and differentiated wt and hmga <dig> ko induced pluripotent stem cells . qpcr data represent means of two independent experiments  ± sd for each of the indicated wt or hmga <dig> ko ipsc clones. b the levels of h3k27ac on oct <dig> enhancer were measured by chip-qpcr in undifferentiated and differentiated wt and hmga <dig> ko ipscs. the right panel reports the chip of hmga <dig> that demonstrates the absence of binding to the oct <dig> enhancer in epilcs. qpcr data represent means of two independent experiments  ± sd for two wt ipsc clones

differentiation of mouse escs implies the exit from the pluripotent ground state and the transition into the epiblast-like state. here, we show that hmga <dig>  a chromatin-associated protein, is necessary for the transition of mouse escs from the naïve pluripotent state into the epiblast-like state. while several results have indicated a clear role of hmga <dig> in hematopoietic  <cit> , stromal  <cit> , and neural  <cit>  stem cell function, and although hmga <dig> is expressed at the highest levels in mammalian embryos, the physiological role of this protein in the early steps of development was still unclear  <cit> . the results of this work assign a precise role to this protein: in hmga <dig> kd escs and ko ipscs, the induction of differentiation markers is decreased or completely abolished, while pluripotency markers continue to be expressed. the results we show also demonstrate that the function of hmga <dig> concerns with the earliest step of esc differentiation, i.e. their transition into epilcs, because hmga <dig> kd and ko prevents the accumulation of fgf <dig>  a marker of epilcs. mechanistically, we demonstrate that hmga <dig> is required for and directly involved in the engagement and activation of new enhancers by otx <dig>  recent results have demonstrated that oct <dig> and otx <dig> are responsible for the regulation of genes that characterize the exit from the pluripotent ground state  <cit> . therefore, upon the induction of esc differentiation, oct <dig> activates the transcription of the otx <dig> gene and, in turn, otx <dig> accumulates and starts the engagement of new enhancers, including that controlling the transcription of the hmga <dig> gene. hmga <dig> favors the pioneering and/or the stable association of otx <dig> with the new enhancers, and supports a positive feedback loop that sustains the otx2-dependent transcription of the hmga <dig> gene itself . the precise mechanism through which hmga <dig> affects the dna binding capacity of otx <dig>  and in turn its pioneering of new enhancers, remains to be addressed. one possibility is that hmga <dig> affects dna and/or the chromatin state, thus favoring the engagement and/or the stable association of otx <dig> to its cis-element. most information on the function of hmga proteins derives from the study of hmga <dig>  in several cases, hmga <dig> interacts with a/t-rich sequences close to or overlapping with the binding elements of tfs. one example is that of the inf-β gene promoter, where hmga <dig> binds to a/t-rich sequences overlapping with the nf-kb and atf- <dig> cis-elements, thus favoring the formation of an enhanceosome  <cit> . these sequences are often located on the surface of, or close to, positioned nucleosomes that hamper the binding of sequence-specific tfs. one of the effects of hmga <dig> seems to be that of favoring the removal of nucleosomal constraints that prevent the formation of tf-dna complexes  <cit> . the crucial role of hmga <dig> in transition from escs into epilcs is also supported by the observation that, when we generated ipscs from hmga <dig> ko mefs, the efficiency of the reprogramming was significantly reduced. this observation is in agreement with recent results indicating that hmga <dig> overexpression facilitates the efficient conversion of somatic cells into human induced neural stem cells  <cit> . one possible explanation of these phenomena is that hmga <dig> favors the expansion of ipscs rather than their generation. however, our results clearly show that hmga <dig> ko ipscs have the same proliferative capacity of the normal ipscs. on the other hand, several results, including those presented in this paper, show that hmga <dig> has a crucial role in chromatin remodeling assisting the engagement of new enhancers by some transcription factors. thus, it cannot be excluded that, according to our observations in esc differentiation, hmga <dig> could also favor the transition from an enhancer occupancy specific of differentiated cells towards that of less differentiated cells, thus favoring reprogramming.

the differentiation defects observed in hmga <dig> ko ipscs appear more pronounced compared to those of otx <dig> ko escs. indeed, we have observed that the differentiation of otx <dig> ko escs into epilcs does not lead to an impairment of the epiblast marker dnmt3b . accordingly, buecker et al.  <cit>  found that otx <dig> ko escs grown in 2i + lif conditions and differentiated into epilcs show a minor phenotype with defects in the expression of only certain epiblast-associated genes. our experiments demonstrated that hmga <dig> ko ipscs grown in 2i + lif conditions show a more pronounced phenotype when differentiated into epilcs, with significant defects of the induction of several epiblast markers . these differences in the differentiated phenotypes of otx <dig> ko escs and hmga <dig> ko ipscs suggest that hmga <dig> may also have otx2-independent functions.

CONCLUSIONS
herein, we demonstrate that the chromatin-associated protein hmga <dig> plays a crucial role in the exit of escs from the pluripotent ground state. hmga <dig> suppression prevents esc differentiation by interfering with the function of the otx <dig> tf. this phenomenon is due to a direct involvement of hmga <dig> in the engagement and/or stable association of otx <dig> with new enhancers upon the induction of esc differentiation. indeed, hmga <dig> directly binds to the otx <dig> cis-element and, in the absence of hmga <dig>  otx <dig> fails to engage and, thus, activate its target enhancers.
