BACKGROUND
the mammalian sex chromosomes  differentiated from a pair of autosomes  more than  <dig> million years  ago, before the divergence of monotremes from other mammals  <cit> . the physiological and biological differentiation of proto-sex chromosomes began with the emergence of two or more sex-determining genes, including sry  and rbmy , on one of the proto-sex chromosomes, the proto-y chromosome. the tight linkage of sex-determining genes on the proto-y chromosome is required for normal development of male characters or male determination  <cit> , and the suppression of homologous recombination produced the tight linkage of male-sex-determining genes on the proto-y chromosome. through suppression of homologous recombination, nucleotide substitutions accumulated on each chromosome, leading to the emergence of x- and y-specific regions on each sex chromosome. eventually, the increased divergence between the x and y chromosomes led to a complete cessation of recombination between them, leading to the rapid degradation of the y chromosome. this degradation arises primarily from the loss of a mechanism that avoids the accumulation of deleterious mutations on the y chromosome  <cit> .

lahn and page  <cit>  first proposed a scenario to explain the process of sex chromosome differentiation. the extent of nucleotide divergence per synonymous site  for  <dig> x-y pairs of genes in humans or squirrel monkeys varied greatly from  <dig>  at arse/arsep to  <dig>  at sry/sox <dig>  in addition, the ks of the  <dig> pairs decreased with position on the x chromosome from the long arm tip to the short arm tip. based on this variation, the  <dig> pairs were classified into four distinct categories, or strata. stratum  <dig> contains three genes with ks >  <dig> , stratum  <dig> contains two genes with ks of approximately  <dig> , and strata  <dig> and  <dig> comprise seven genes with ks = ~ <dig> , and ks = ~ <dig> , respectively. the ks values in strata  <dig> and  <dig> suggest that recombination between x and y chromosomes ceased before the divergence of monotremes from other mammals for stratum  <dig>  and before the divergence of marsupials and eutherian mammals for stratum  <dig>  the observed ks values of ~ <dig>  and ~ <dig>  also suggest that stratum  <dig> formed before the mammalian divergence and that stratum  <dig> formed in the primate lineage after the divergence of prosimian and simian primates. to confirm whether this step-wise divergence between x and y chromosomes is observed in other non-coding regions on the x and y chromosomes, iwase et al.  <cit>  compared nucleotide sequences in the distal half of the short arm of the human x chromosome with a homologous region on the y chromosome. this analysis revealed a step-wise change in the p-distances and confirmed the scenario of sex chromosome differentiation proposed by lahn and page  <cit> . however, some p-distances within stratum  <dig>  where the p-distance is ~ <dig>  on average, were significantly lower    <cit> . this low p-distance region has been reported independently in other studies  <cit> . the region is ~ <dig> kb long and encompasses the kalx to vcx <dig> genes in humans . the cause for this low p-distance has been argued to be gene conversion  <cit> .

kalx, which is one of the genes responsible for kallmann syndrome  <cit> , is located on the x chromosome, and is composed of  <dig> exons, encompassing a 210-kb region. the gene encodes an extracellular matrix glycoprotein of ~ <dig> kda which is called anosmin- <dig> and is expressed in the kidneys and in multiple embryonic tissues  <cit> . anosmin- <dig> is conserved in a wide range of animals, from nematodes to humans  <cit>  suggesting the functional importance of the protein. a deletion in or of the kalx gene results in an x-linked recessive form of kallmann syndrome, whose typical symptoms are anosmia, small genitalia, and sterility. the defective gene product prevents the migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone  neurons and olfactory neurons to the hypothalamus  <cit> . a homolog of kalx, kaly, is located on the long arm of the y chromosome, but because of deletions and nonsense mutations the gene is a pseudogene  <cit> . since kalx and kaly are in the middle of stratum  <dig>  the two genes began to differentiate after simian primates diverged from prosimians  <cit> .

vcx and vcy form a relatively small gene family, with four members of vcx and two of vcy being identified in humans. each member of the vcx gene family has three or four exons and is  <dig> ~ <dig> bp in length, whereas vcy genes have two exons and are  <dig> bp long. all members of vcx and vcy are expressed exclusively in male germ cells  <cit> . vcx and vcy sequences show a high degree of sequence similarity within each gene family as well as between genes on the x and y chromosomes  <cit> . sequence identity within vcy is due to frequent gene conversion between palindrome arms  <cit> .

the purpose of this study was to examine the evolutionary mechanism that produces the low p-distance region within stratum  <dig> in non-human primates. to this end, we compared nucleotide sequences of corresponding regions between x and y chromosomes of several primates. the analysis showed that relatively frequent gene conversions between the x and y chromosomes have occurred independently in each of the primate lineages. this frequent gene conversion is argued to be a result of genomic structure, such as repetitive elements at the boundary of the region.

RESULTS
comparison of genome sequences reveals low p-values in stratum 4
window analysis of p-distances between x and y chromosomes in chimpanzees shows a low p-distance region on the x chromosome that corresponds to a similar low p-distance region on the x-chromosome in humans. with the exception of the centromeric region containing kalx or kaly , the corresponding regions show similar p-distances in the two species. the sub-region values are ~ <dig> kb with p =  <dig> , ~ <dig> kb with p =  <dig> , and ~ <dig> kb with p =  <dig> , and the boundaries of the chimpanzee sub-regions are almost identical to those in humans . a part of the kal coding region, however, differs between the two species. in chimpanzees, a region covering the middle of intron  <dig> to the 3' flanking region of kalx shows a divergence with kaly of p =  <dig> . an adjacent region shows an identical nucleotide sequence , whereas the corresponding regions in humans have values of p =  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . it should be noted that the boundaries of the above two sub-regions differ between the two species . in addition, the organization of the kaly gene  also differs between the two species: human kaly has a large deletion containing introns  <dig> to  <dig>  whereas chimpanzee kaly retains all exons and introns, with the exception of exon  <dig>  which is also deleted in human kaly.

the entire rhesus monkey kaly is not available from data obtained in the present study or sequence databases, but the available kaly sequence shows a deletion from intron  <dig> to  <dig> . in the  <dig> kb sequence obtained in the present study the p-distance between kaly and kalx is ~ <dig> , while in a  <dig>  kb region including exon  <dig> and the 3' flanking region the value is ~ <dig>  . we also found an inversion on the x chromosome from intron  <dig> to exon  <dig> with a length of ~ <dig>  kb in rhesus monkeys. the low p-distance region in rhesus monkeys, chimpanzees, and humans shows some species-specific patterns of p values, suggesting that the timing of gene conversion between x and y chromosomes is species-specific in each of the lineages leading to the three species.

gene conversion in humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus monkeys
the formation of a low p-distance region in the middle of stratum  <dig> is likely due to gene conversion between the x and y chromosomes. therefore, we examined how often and where in the kal genes these conversions occurred. first, to determine the position of the most recent conversion between kalx and kaly in humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus monkeys, we examined the boundary of the low p-distance region by phylogenetic analysis. we constructed  <dig> phylogenetic trees for  <dig> kb-fragment windows with a sliding overlap of  <dig> kb. based on the topologies of these trees, the kal coding region was classified into two sub-regions: one encompassing exons  <dig> to  <dig>  and the other encompassing exons  <dig> to  <dig> . the region from intron  <dig> to  <dig> was not included in the analysis because of independent deletions in the kaly gene of humans and rhesus monkeys. the phylogenetic trees of region a show the history of stratum  <dig>  recombination between x and y chromosomes ceased before the divergence of old world monkeys and hominoids  and no further exchanges occurred. therefore, sequences from the three primates show the reciprocal monophyly of kalx and kaly. in contrast, region b shows rather species-specific clustering, suggesting independent gene conversion in these species.

second, to determine the timing of the most recent conversion in these lineages, the per-site nucleotide divergence  on the branches leading to the x and y chromosome sequences in regions a and b were calculated. since the nucleotide substitution rates of the x and y chromosomal genes differ  <cit> , d values on the x and y chromosomes are estimated separately on the tree . the average d value on the lineage leading to kalx  and kaly  in rhesus monkeys and hominoids from a common ancestor of these species is given by dx =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and dy =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for region a, and dx =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and dy =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for region b. the values of dx and dy in region a are similar to those in region b. this is consistent with the gene conversion that does not affect species divergence. the divergence re-estimated using both sequences in regions a and b gives dx =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and dy =  <dig>  ±  <dig> . assuming a divergence time between rhesus monkeys and hominoids of  <dig> myr  <cit> , the average substitution rate of kalx and kaly is  <dig>  ±  <dig>  × 10- <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  × 10- <dig> per site per year, respectively. based on these substitution rates, the timing of gene conversion in region b for rhesus monkey x and y chromosomes was estimated to be 17~ <dig> myr ago and that for hominoids was 19~ <dig> myr ago . gene conversion between the x and y chromosomes could also be observed in other hominoid species, such as gorillas and gibbons.

gene conversion in other primate species
to test whether gene conversion can be observed in other primates, specifically gorillas, gibbons, new world monkeys, and ring-tailed lemurs, the chromosomal positions of kalx and kaly in the genomes of these primates were confirmed by fish with dapi  staining of the chromosomes. a single copy of kal was detected on the x and y chromosomes of each species, with the exception of lemurs . the observation is consistent with the origin of stratum  <dig> in simian primates. we sequenced the low p-distance  <dig> kb region, encompassing exon  <dig> to exon  <dig> of the kalx and kaly genes from gorillas and gibbons. however, kaly gene sequences were not available for ring-tailed lemurs or new world monkeys. based on the obtained sequences, phylogenetic trees were constructed separately for regions a and b using the ring-tailed lemur kalx as the out-group  in both trees. the phylogenetic tree of region a shows again a typical topology of stratum 4: recombination between x and y halted after the divergence of prosimian and simian primates, producing the reciprocal monophyly of kalx and kaly of simian primates. in region b, in contrast, the clusters were taxon-specific. this result suggests that multiple gene conversions occurred in region b, at least three times; once in the common ancestor of chimpanzees, gorillas and humans, once in an ancestor of gibbons, and once in the lineage of rhesus monkeys. in addition, new world monkey kalx appears as an out-group of catarrhini  kalx and kaly, reflecting an ancient gene conversion between x and y in the stem lineage of catarrhini.

to understand whether or not there are hot spots of conversion in the b region, we analyzed the  <dig> kb region in detail. we investigated a total of  <dig> nj trees with a sliding window width of  <dig> bp and an overlap of  <dig> bp for the b region. based on the topologies of the  <dig> trees, the b region was further classified into seven sub-regions, each of which shows signatures of gene conversion . region i shows at least three conversion events: one in gibbons, another in the stem lineage leading to humans, chimpanzees and gorillas, and the third in humans. similarly, conversions occurred twice in region ii, once in region iii and in region iv, twice in region vi, and once in region vii. in total, at least  <dig> gene conversions were detected. however, no conversion has occurred in the a region since the divergence of catarrhini from new world monkeys. these observations strongly imply that the entire b region is prone to gene conversion and that some factors that enhance gene conversion may be present at the boundary between the a and b regions.

gene conversion between kalx and kaly in white-handed gibbons
numerous  independent inter-chromosomal gene conversions between kalx and kaly have occurred during primate evolution. the direction of gene conversion was inferred from the phylogenetic analysis. among the conversions, five were from kaly to kalx and the remaining five were in the opposite direction. we also identified an example of ongoing gene conversion from y to x chromosomes in white-handed gibbons. the alignment of four kalx and two kaly sequences from four  white-handed gibbons  indicates that the  <dig> bp sequence starting from the end of exon  <dig> in one of the kalx alleles  is identical to a kaly sequence . since these kalx and kaly sequences differ by eight substitutions, it is unlikely that all eight substitutions are the result of recurrent substitutions on a particular region of the kalx allele sequence. this observation is likely an example of a recent gene conversion in this region in a non-human primate.

repetitive elements in the region
to infer the molecular mechanism for the frequent gene conversions in the b region, repetitive sequences such as line, sine, and simple repeats, which are known to be involved in sequence exchanges, were searched for at the boundary of the low p-distance region of humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus monkeys. line- <dig>  retrotransposons represent at least 17% of the human genome  <cit> , and the number of these elements in the low p-distance region does not differ from the average over the entire lengths of the x and y chromosomes. kalx and kaly, however, share l <dig> elements  near the boundary  of the low p-distance region in intron  <dig>  although human kaly lacks the line due to a large deletion encompassing introns  <dig> to  <dig> 

the line element shared among primate kalx and kaly has been annotated as line3a. this line element is likely to have been inserted before the formation of stratum  <dig>  and it has been a breakpoint for gene conversion. an alignment and phylogenetic analyses of the line3a sequences revealed the boundary between regions a and b was located in the sequence and the phylogeny of line3a showed a reciprocal monophyly in the 5' half of the x and y sequences but a species-specific clustering in the 3' half of the x and y sequences . this data suggests the occurrence of at least two independent gene conversions  in a similar position in line3a.

vcx and vcy
the low p-distance region in stratum  <dig> ranges from kalx to vcx <dig> in human and chimpanzee sequences . frequent gene conversions between paralogs on the same chromosome are well known among the vcx and vcy genes. in particular, gene conversion between vcy genes is due to the p <dig> palindrome in humans and chimpanzees  <cit> . in contrast to kal sequences, vcy sequences are only available for humans and chimpanzees. this lack makes it very difficult to infer inter-chromosomal gene conversions between vcx and vcy in non-human and non-chimpanzee primates. the most recent gene conversions between vcx and vcy in humans and chimpanzees are estimated to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  myr ago, respectively . we identified four vcx sequences in the new world monkey genome , although no one-to-one orthologous relationship with the four human vcx sequences was detected, suggesting species-specific gene duplications or frequent gene conversions within the vcx genes on the x chromosome in new world monkey.

discussion
repetitive sequences in the converted region
gene conversion is an event in genetic recombination that occurs at high frequencies not only in germ cells through meiotic division but also in somatic cells through mitosis. recombination occurs between molecules possessing similar nucleotide sequences and is a common repair mechanism for nucleotide lesions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. recombination is initiated by a double-strand break in one gene followed by the repair of this gene by copying the sequence of a similar gene. in the process of this repair, a "holliday structure" is constructed and depending on the resolution of this structure, the result is called either gene conversion or crossing over  <cit> . however, it is still not clear whether gene conversion between paralogs on the same or different chromosomes proceeds by the same mechanism.

an l <dig> element may play an important role in the repair process. although the mechanism is not yet well defined, double-strand breaks at chromosomal line elements can be repaired by gene conversion with another line element in cis or trans  <cit> . such conversion is often responsible for disease-causing genetic rearrangements  <cit> . in fact, han et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> cases of human-specific deletions associated with recombination between l <dig> elements that have resulted in an approximately  <dig>  mb reduction in the amount of human dna within the past few million years.

in the present study, we identified a line element at the boundary of the low p-distance region and found that the boundary was located within this line element . further, we observed frequent deletions in the primate y chromosome in the low p-distance region. these observations provide evidence of the significant role of repetitive elements, such as a line, as a source of instability in the region.

at the telomeric end, in contrast, we found a truncated or segmented palindrome, which included three of the four vcx members. this palindrome on the x chromosome has a relatively long loop and short arms. palindrome arms, which contain vcx gene family sequences, may have facilitated frequent exchanges with palindrome arms on the y chromosome  <cit> .

history of kals and kallmann syndrome
a sizeable body of evidence has accumulated to show that, although gene conversion has been an important driving force in human genome evolution, it can also be a cause of inherited diseases  <cit> .

identical kalx and kaly sequences were located on a pair of ancestral chromosomes before the cessation of recombination in stratum  <dig> . both kalx and kaly were subjected to mutations following the establishment of stratum  <dig>  however, selection pressure removed deleterious mutations from kalx, whereas mutations accumulated on kaly which subsequently became a pseudogene. later, frequent gene conversions resulted in partial homogenization between kalx and kaly, resulting in a reduced number of nucleotide differences between the two genes.

since kaly is a pseudogene and kalx is functional, the direction of genetic exchange should be mostly from kalx to kaly. gene conversion from kaly to kalx can potentially destroy the functional kalx gene, resulting in kallmann syndrome. thus, the conversion from y to x chromosome after the formation of stratum  <dig> could lead to kallmann syndrome. in primate evolution, gene conversion from kaly to kalx actually occurred as frequently as that from kalx to kaly . guioli et al.  <cit>  proposed that exon  <dig> in kalx was replaced homologous segment in kaly. this replacement would result in the loss of function in authentic kalx and cause the syndrome, suggesting that the translocation of kaly onto the x chromosome may be the cause of this replacement. however, the authors did not examine sequences downstream of exon  <dig> or whether the kalx in individuals with kallmann syndrome is the result of a translocation or the result of gene conversion. the present study raises the possibility that the novel molecular characteristics may indeed affect kalx function.

CONCLUSIONS
genomic sequence analysis revealed a low p-distance region in the middle of stratum  <dig> on the x chromosome of primates. this low p-distance was probably caused by ectopic gene conversion in the course of primate evolution and was independently observed in several primate species. phylogenetic studies of the region revealed at least ten gene conversions within a relatively small ~ <dig> kb region, suggesting the presence of a hot spot for conversions. the examination of primate genome structures reveals the presence of structures that may enhance conversion in the region: large repetitive elements at the centromeric end and a segmented palindrome at the telomeric boundary of this region. this conversion may be one of the causes of kallmann syndrome.
