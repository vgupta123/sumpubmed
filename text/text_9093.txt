BACKGROUND
in the cells of higher eukaryotes, recognition of virally-derived rna intermediates produced during replication activates signalling cascades that trigger the production of interferons  and other cytokines, which in turn mediate innate immunity and modulate subsequent adaptive immunity  <cit> . the innate immune system utilizes pattern-recognition receptors  to detect conserved molecular patterns on certain types of molecule that are not produced by the host but are characterisitic of invading microorganisms  <cit> . there are two categories of prrs involved in the induction of type i ifns: toll-like receptor  and rig-i-like receptors . the transmembrane-anchored tlr family members, present on cell surfaces or in endosomes, bind extracellular viral components  <cit> . in contrast, the initial detection of intracellular viral nucleic acids occurs via a tlr-independent pathway in which two rna helicases, retinoic acid inducible gene-i  and melanoma differentiation-association gene  <dig> , are able to sense viral rna in the cytoplasm  <cit> .

rig-i and mda <dig> are functionally-related cytosolic proteins that each contain two n-terminal caspase activation and recruitment  domains and a dexd/h-box rna helicase domain. these rlrs are activated by different types of rna molecules produced as by-products of virus replication, such as double stranded rna or uncapped rna bearing 5' triphosphates, which are not found in uninfected cells  <cit> . the c-termini of rig-i and mda <dig> function as regulatory repressor domains, deletion of which results in constitutive signalling to the ifn-β promoter  <cit> . upon binding of dsrna  to the helicase domain, rig-i and mda <dig> are presumed to undergo structural alteration and multimerization, thereby unmasking the cards and enabling them to recruit downstream signal transducer proteins. the tandem n-terminal card domains of rig-i or mda <dig> are able to act as dominant activators: overexpression of either of these tandem domains results in the induction of ifn production without viral infection  <cit> . rig-i and mda <dig> signalling results in the activation of ikkε and tbk- <dig>  two serine/threonine kinases that phosphorylate irf <dig> and irf <dig>  <cit> . upon phosphorylation, irf <dig> and irf <dig> translocate to the nucleus and subsequently induce ifn-α and ifn-β gene transcription  <cit> .

the adaptor protein that acts as an intermediate between rig-i/mda <dig> detection of viral rna and downstream activation events was discovered by four groups in  <dig> and given four different names: ips- <dig>   <cit> , mavs   <cit> , visa   <cit>  and cardif   <cit> . ips- <dig>  is a  <dig> kda protein containing an n-terminal card domain, a proline-rich region and a transmembrane domain that targets it to the outer mitochondrial membrane  <cit> . overexpression of ips- <dig> activates the ifn-α, ifn-β and nf-κb promoters, requiring interactions of the kinases tbk <dig> and ikkε with ips- <dig> for the activation of these promoters  <cit> . the proline rich region interacts with a number of signalling molecules including traf <dig>  traf <dig>  <cit> , rip <dig>  fadd  <cit>  and traf <dig>  <cit> , suggesting that ips- <dig> plays a role in tlr3-mediated pathways in addition to tlr-independent, rig-i/mda5-mediated signalling  <cit> . it has also been demonstrated that both the ips- <dig> card and c-terminal mitochondrial membrane-targeting domains of ips- <dig> are essential for ifn-β induction  <cit> . ips- <dig> has been identified as a target for the ns3/4a protease of hepatitis c virus , which cleaves ips- <dig> from the mitochondrial membrane and abolishes its ability to signal to the ifn-β promoter  <cit> .

the card domain of ips- <dig> interacts with the n-terminal regions of rig-i or mda <dig> most probably through homotypic card-card associations  <cit> , and both card domains of rig-i are required for the interaction with ips- <dig> card  <cit> . in the case of mda <dig>  it has been shown that dihydroxyacetone kinase  binds to the card domains of mda <dig>  suggesting that dak acts as a negative regulator of mda <dig> that is released upon a conformational change induced by viral rna binding, allowing the mda <dig> card domains to bind to ips- <dig> card  <cit> . in the case of rig-i, it has been shown that the second card region can be ubiquitinated, and that the level of ubiquitination correlates with the signal transduction activity of rig-i, and may facilitate its interaction with ips- <dig>  <cit> . other proteins are known to bind to ips- <dig> card to regulate signalling, as it has been shown that the atg5-atg <dig> conjugate, a key regulator of the autophagic process, interacts with ips- <dig> card and the card domains of rig-i thereby blocking interferon production  <cit> .

cards are members of the death domain  superfamily, which also includes the death domain, death effector domain and pyrin domain subfamilies  <cit> . members of the dd superfamily play a critical role in the assembly of oligomeric signalling complexes in apoptotic and inflammatory processes. in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway for example, release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm induces apaf- <dig> to recruit caspase- <dig> via a card-card interaction  <cit> . as a first step towards understanding the structural basis of the mode of action of ips- <dig>  we report the crystal structure of the human ips- <dig> card domain to a resolution of  <dig> Å. the ips- <dig> card domain shares homology with the first card domains of mda <dig> and rig-i , which allows homology modelling of these related cards that, together with the second card domains, are known to interact with ips- <dig> card.

RESULTS
structure overview
the crystal structure of an engineered chimera , in which human ips- <dig> card is fused to the c-terminus of mbp, was solved to  <dig> Å resolution. ips- <dig> card was crystallized as an mbp fusion construct as untagged ips- <dig> card exhibited poor solubility and stability. crystallization required a short linker region between mbp and ips- <dig> card, as has been successful in a number of other chimeric fusion protein structures, for example an mbp-homeobox domain chimera   <cit> , an mbp-argonaute <dig> paz domain chimera   <cit>  and an mbp-nedd8-activating enzyme e <dig> subunit chimera   <cit> .

the asymmetric unit contains one molecule of mbp-card comprising residues 2– <dig> of mbp, a  <dig> amino acid linker , and residues  <dig> to  <dig> of human ips- <dig>  but with a mutation from pro to ala at position  <dig> introduced during the cloning. the mbp and ips- <dig> card components of the fusion protein form two distinct domains . the  <dig> amino acid linker forms a helix that connects the final helix of mbp to the first helix of ips- <dig> card.

ips1-card exhibits the characteristic topology of the dd superfamily, comprising six tightly packed α-helices arranged in a greek-key motif . helix  <dig>  often severely kinked in card structures, is divided into two smaller helices: h1a, from residues  <dig> to  <dig> and h1b, which is a short  <dig> helix encompassing residues  <dig> to  <dig>  helix  <dig> extends from residues  <dig> to  <dig>  the last three residues of which also form a  <dig> helix. the remaining four helices comprise residues  <dig> to  <dig> , residues  <dig> to  <dig> , residues  <dig> to  <dig>  and residues  <dig> to  <dig> . the loops between the helices are well defined.

comparison with other card structures
several other card structures have been determined to date: nmr structures are available for raidd card  <cit> , nod <dig> card  <cit>  and iceberg card  <cit> . crystal structures of ced- <dig> card  <cit> , nod <dig> card  <cit>  apaf- <dig> card  <cit>  and a complex of apaf- <dig> card with procaspase- <dig> card  <cit>  have been solved. all of these cards belong to proteins involved in apoptotic pathways.

the superposition of representative card structures with ips- <dig> card is shown in fig.  <dig>  the closest structural homologues are apaf- <dig> , the prodomain of procaspase- <dig>  and several monomers of the oligomeric death domain complex . there are two main differences in secondary structure that separate ips- <dig> card from these cards. helix  <dig> in ips- <dig> card is truncated relative to the other known cards, a feature which is accompanied by a shortening of the loop interconnecting h <dig> and h <dig>  by contrast, h <dig> is about  <dig> residues longer in ips- <dig> card relative to the other card structures with h <dig> and h <dig> connected by only a single glycine residue.

surface characteristics
the surface of human ips- <dig> contains two highly charged patches . helices h1a, h <dig> and h <dig> form a flat surface that is largely positively charged due to lys <dig>  lys <dig>  arg <dig>  arg <dig>  arg <dig>  his <dig>  arg <dig> and arg <dig>  on the opposite side of the molecule, a negatively charged patch covers the surfaces helices h <dig> and h <dig> and their preceding loops. residues contributing to this acidic region are asp <dig>  glu <dig>  glu <dig>  asp <dig>  asp <dig> and glu <dig> 

the sequence alignment of ips- <dig> cards from a number of species is shown in fig.  <dig>  the positions of residues contributing to the charged patches are indicated. in the negatively charged patch, residues glu <dig> and glu <dig> are conserved, asp <dig> is always an asp or glu, glu <dig> is always a glu or gln, whereas asp <dig> and asp <dig> are not conserved. residues lys <dig>  arg <dig>  arg <dig> and arg <dig>  present in the positively charged patch, are conserved across the ips- <dig> family, and although arg <dig> is not conserved, the preceding residue is an arginine in all other species.

interestingly, the structure possesses a largely conserved surface tryptophan residue, trp <dig>  that interrupts the positive patch. this residue is disordered in the human ips- <dig> card structure, the major conformer  has its whole face exposed to solvent and stacks against phe <dig>  which is either phe or his in other ips- <dig> cards. in the other conformer  the tryptophan side chain is fully exposed which in turn exposes phe <dig> face-on to solvent. also contributing to this hydrophobic patch is tyr <dig>  largely conserved across the ips- <dig> cards, except for horse where it is a phenylalanine.

modelling mda5/rig-i card domains
the annotations in the protein sequence databases relating to the boundaries of the card domains are not always an accurate reflection of the true boundaries. for example, the ips- <dig> card domain is indicated as running from residue  <dig> to  <dig>  whereas the crystal structure clearly shows that it runs from  <dig> to  <dig>  using the consensus secondary structure prediction within phyre  <cit> , the first and second card domains of human mda <dig> are likely to encompass residues  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig>  respectively, assuming a similar six-helical bundle topology. similarly, the two human rig-i card domains are likely to span residues  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig>  the first card domains of human mda <dig>  and rig-i  share greater amino sequence identity, 25% and 22% respectively, to ips- <dig> card than to any other card domain of known structure, for example mda5card <dig> shares 15% identity with apaf- <dig> card. several hydrophobic amino acids are conserved across the ips- <dig>  rig-i and mda <dig> card domains , and form part of the hydrophobic core of the ips- <dig> card structure, which puts constraints on the relative orientations of the helices h <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig>  models of mda5card <dig> and rigicard <dig> were therefore constructed using homology modelling. relative to ips- <dig> card, mda5card <dig> has two extra residues in the loop connecting h1b and h <dig>  and three extra residues, including a tryptophan, in the loop between h <dig> and h <dig> . it was assumed that mda5card <dig> contained a kink between h1a and h1b as seen in ips- <dig> card and all other card structures, even though secondary structure prediction suggested a continuous helix. rigicard <dig> is predicted to be similar to mda5card <dig> except for a longer h <dig>  a shorter h4–h <dig> loop and a much shorter h <dig> 

the mda5card <dig> model suggests that h1b is a  <dig> or 7-residue long α-helix, in contrast to the four amino acid  <dig> helix seen in ips- <dig> card. the surface of the mda5card <dig> model shows that this helix is highly positively charged, containing residues arg <dig>  arg <dig> and lys <dig> . this together with arg <dig> and arg <dig> at the end of h <dig> and arg <dig> on h <dig> , create a highly-positively charged region on the surface of mda5card <dig> . the remainder of the molecule carries a mixed charged profile with a mainly overall negative charge due to acidic residues conserved across all species at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the surface views of mda5card <dig> in fig.  <dig> are in the same orientations as the ips- <dig> card in fig.  <dig> and illustrate the very different charge profiles of the two molecules. the rigicard <dig> model suggests a very different charge profile to mda5card <dig> , in particular the surface is predominantly negatively-charged in the regions of h <dig> due to residues glu <dig> and glu <dig>  conserved across all rig-is, and h <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig> due to residues glu <dig>  glu <dig>  asp  <dig> and glu  <dig>  conserved across all rig-is.

the sequence identity between the first card domains of human mda <dig> and human rig-i is 23%, and between the second card domains is 20%. the identity between the two card domains of mda <dig> is 22% and between the two rig-i card domains is 19%. as shown in fig.  <dig>  there is no obvious conservation of charged residues between the helicase card domains. helices  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are predicted to be of similar length, with a conserved glycine between h <dig> and h <dig>  but the extent of h <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig> appear highly variable. the variability of the second card domains of mda5/rig-i precluded their modelling in this study. it has been shown that the second card domain of rig-i can be ubiquitinated at several lysines , and that in particular ubiquitination at lys <dig> in human rig-i may facilitate its interaction with ips- <dig> card  <cit> , although lys <dig> is not conserved across species, and is a glutamine in rat and mouse rig-i.

card-card associations
the crystal structure of the caspase-recruitment domain of apaf- <dig> in complex with the prodomain of procaspase- <dig> is the only card-card complex structure determined to date  <cit> . complex formation is mediated by electrostatic interactions between a negatively-charged convex region on apaf- <dig> card  and a positively-charged concave surface on procaspase- <dig> , which are reinforced by van der waals and h-bond interactions. the oligomeric piddosome complex revealed an assembly of  <dig> death domains that form a set of dd interactions classified into three types  <cit> . a type i interaction involves residues in h <dig> and h <dig> of the first dd interacting with residues of h <dig> and h <dig> of the second dd, with both polar and hydrophobic interactions at the interface. the apaf- <dig> card:procaspase- <dig> card interaction is an example of a type i association. a type ii interaction involves h <dig> and the h4–h <dig> loop of the first dd interacting with the h5–h <dig> loop and h <dig> helix of the second dd, with the interaction mainly involving charged residues. a type iii interaction involves residues in h <dig> of the first dd interacting with residues near the h1–h <dig> and h3–h <dig> loops of the second dd, with the interaction being a mixture of polar, charged and hydrophobic  <cit> .

assuming that the card-card associations of ips- <dig> with mda5/rig-i conform to one of the three types described above, then the basic face of ips- <dig> card with the hydrophobic patch involving trp <dig> and tyr <dig> may associate via a type i interaction with the h <dig> and h <dig> regions of one of the card domains of the helicases. similarly, the negatively-charged region of ips- <dig> card involving h <dig> and its preceding loop may associate via a type ii interaction with the h <dig> and h <dig> regions of the other helicase card domain.

CONCLUSIONS
the crystal structure of the card domain of ips- <dig> has been determined to  <dig> Å resolution as part of a fusion construct with maltose-binding protein that allowed solubilization and crystallization. the structure is that of a typical member of the death domain superfamily, comprising a six-helix bundle with a greek-key motif topology. the surface charge distribution, conserved across ips- <dig> from a variety of mammalian species, shows an asymmetric distribution typical of card domains with positive and negative areas on opposite sides of the protein that are probably involved in electrostatically-driven homotypic card-card interactions. one unusual feature that probably explains the lack of solubility of non-tagged ips- <dig> card is a disordered tryptophan  that exposes its whole face in the centre of the flat, positively-charged surface of the protein involving helices h <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig>  this tryptophan is conserved in most species, suggesting that one card-card association made by ips- <dig> involves a type i interaction with helices h <dig> and h <dig> of one of the helicase card domains.

homology modelling of the first card domains of mda <dig> and rig-i based on the structure of ips- <dig> card suggests that they have a completely different surface charge profile compared to ips- <dig> card, and in comparison with each other. alignment of the card domains of mda <dig> and rig-i, together with secondary structure prediction and location of conserved residues suggests that although the dual card domains of rig-i and mda <dig> interact with the ips- <dig> card domain, they may do so in quite different ways that may, of course, also involve the peptide linking the two card domains. in the case of rig-i, the interaction may also involve ubiquitin at lys <dig> in some species. this apparent variability in card-card interactions between the helicases and ips- <dig> suggests a differential signalling mechanism for the two helicases. a detailed understanding of this recognition will only come with the elucidation of the complex of ips- <dig> card with the card domains of both helicases.
