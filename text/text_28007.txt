BACKGROUND
oilseed rape  is one of the most important oil crops producing multi-purpose oil for food and biofuel in many parts of the world. in  <dig>  biodiesel production accounted for 7% of the global vegetable oil supplies, in which 68% were used for biofuels in the eu  <cit> . as the global requirements for rapeseed oil are growing rapidly, increasing the oil content and improving the oil composition are important ways to meet the demands of agricultural feed stocks.

the fatty acid composition of rapeseed oil is considered to be genetically more variable than any other major vegetable oils  <cit> . rapeseed oil is a mixture of seven main fatty acids  <cit> . fatty acid biosynthetic pathways are generally controlled by multiple genes and considered as quantitative traits regulated by qtls. so far, a number of qtls controlling oil composition were identified in b. napus. ecke et al. identified two qtls for erucic acid distributed on chromosomes a <dig> and c <dig>  <cit> . four qtls for erucic acid distributed across chromosomes a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig> and c <dig> were reported and three of these coincided with qtls for the accumulation of oil content  <cit> . burns et al. observed  <dig> qtls affecting composition of  <dig> fatty acids, and seven also affected oil content  <cit> . hu et al. identified two qtls for oleic  and linolenic acids , respectively  <cit> . one to eight qtls were detected for seven individual fatty acids by zhao et al., and eight of these also affected oil content  <cit> . recently, smooker et al. identified  <dig> qtls for five major fatty acids  <cit> , and yan et al. detected a total of  <dig> qtls for six fatty acids, which were most clustered on chromosomes a <dig>  a <dig> and c <dig>  <cit> .

the allotetraploid b. napus has two progenitor species, b. rapa and b. oleracea, which shared their last common ancestor with a. thaliana about  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . both a high degree of sequence similarities and chromosomal colinearities between brassica species and arabidopsis were reported  <cit> . parkin et al. reported  <dig> conserved blocks within the arabidopsis genome shared with b. napus  <cit> , and schranz et al. proposed a set of  <dig> conserved chromosomal blocks in b. napus  <cit> . furthermore, all the genome sequence of b. rapa, b. oleracea and b. napus have been released  <cit> . it is feasible to predict the arabidopsis orthologous genes for specific agronomic traits within the brassica genome. for example, a number of candidate genes were mapped to cis of qtls for flowering time by in silico mapping  <cit> , and a total of  <dig> lipid-related candidate gene loci were located in the cis of six qtls for seed oil content  <cit> . in fact, many important genes involved in fatty acid metabolism were identified in arabidopsis, such as fab <dig>  fad <dig>  fad <dig> and fae <dig>  <cit> , and the orthologs of these genes in b. napus were also reported and mapped. bnafad <dig> was mapped on a <dig>  a <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> chromosomes  <cit> , and one major qtl bnaa.fad <dig> a located on a <dig> was responsible for high c18: <dig>  <cit> . bnafad <dig> was mapped on a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  <cit> , and two major qtls bnaa.fad <dig> b and bnac.fad <dig> b were both responsible for low c18: <dig>  <cit> . bnafae <dig> was mapped on both a <dig> and c <dig>  <cit> , and two fae <dig> homologous genes on a <dig> and c <dig> linkage groups were also found by qiu et al.  <cit>  and fourmann et al.  <cit> . collectively, although genes or qtls for fatty acid biosynthesis have been identified, the genetic network for all these metabolic pathways in b. napus needs to be elucidated.

in arabidopsis, more than  <dig> enzymatic reactions and at least  <dig> genes are involved in acyl-lipid metabolism  <cit> . li-beisson et al. gave metabolic pathways associated with the biosynthesis and degradation of acyl-lipids in arabidopsis  <cit> . the genome of polyploid b. napus may typically contain six distinct alleles for each gene present in arabidopsis  <cit> , the fatty acid biosynthesis and the gene regulation in b. napus might have a more complex pathway than that in arabidopsis. though much attention was given to genes and regulatory factors involved in acyl-lipid metabolism in arabidopsis  <cit> , similar questions concerning the genetic basis of fatty acid biosynthesis in b. napus remain open, mainly due to the lack of integrative studies at a population scale. moreover, the interaction of genes involved in acyl-lipid metabolism has not yet been studied based on co-location of mapped candidate genes with qtls in b. napus. to determine these key steps in relevant complex metabolic pathways of acyl-lipids in b. napus, it is first necessary to identify qtls or genes associated with fatty acids composition.

in this paper, we describe the genetic bases of seed fatty acid composition through qtl mapping in b. napus. the aims of this study were as follows:  to add knowledge concerning qtl mapping of the fatty acid composition in b. napus;  to predict candidate genes of major qtls for different fatty acids’ biosynthesis by comparative genome analysis; and  to construct a regulatory pathway for fatty acids metabolism in b. napus.

RESULTS
variation and single qtl analysis of fatty acid composition in the ‘tapidor’ × ‘ningyou7’ cross  dh population
means of all traits measured from the tn dh population over six environments were close to the mid-parent values . there was a wide range of variations and transgressive segregations for the concentration of each fatty acid . the population appeared to have a normal or near-normal distribution for c16: <dig>  c18: <dig>  c18: <dig>  c18: <dig>  c20: <dig>  c22: <dig> and fas , suggesting complexity of their genetic networks. however, c18: <dig>  c20: <dig> and c22: <dig> showed bi-modal distributions, indicating that they might be controlled by few major genes with a relatively large effect. the distribution patterns of  <dig> fatty acids’ compositions showed that they were genetically stable but also affected by environment. the correlation between different fatty acid compositions showed great differences . erucic acid  content was highly and positively correlated with the level of c20: <dig>  c20: <dig> and c22: <dig> , but was negatively correlated with other fatty acids , especially c18: <dig>  . c18: <dig> showed a high positive correlation with c16: <dig> and c18: <dig>  and moderate positive correlation with c18: <dig> and c18: <dig> , but showed a high negative correlation with other fatty acids .table  <dig>

bthe software used to detect qtl. w, winqtlcart_ <dig> ; q, qtlnetwork_ <dig> .


cthe environment in which the qtls are detected.

the qtl with bold indicates that no candidate genes are located in the confidence interval of this qtl in the present study.



individual saturated fatty acids were only analyzed in three environments . for c16: <dig>   <dig> qtls were detected across seven chromosomes . among these qtls, seven  were detected by two types of software. the additive effect ranged from − <dig>  to  <dig> , and explained  <dig> – <dig> % of pv . for c18: <dig>   <dig> qtls distributed across seven chromosomes had − <dig>  to  <dig>  additive effect and explained  <dig> – <dig> % of pv . three of them  were environment-specific qtls detected only in one environment. a total of  <dig> qtls controlling c20: <dig> explained  <dig> – <dig> % of pv . nine qtls on five chromosomes for c22: <dig> were detected, and three were environment-specific, their additive effect ranged from − <dig>  to  <dig> , and explained  <dig> – <dig> % of pv . in 09d, 09 w <dig> and 09 w <dig>  all saturated fatty acid compositions were considered as one trait named fas, and a total of  <dig> qtls were detected with additive effect ranged from − <dig>  to  <dig>  and explaining  <dig> – <dig> % of pv .

for the other four unsaturated fatty acid components, phenotypic data were obtained from six different environments, except for c20: <dig> from three environments . twelve qtls for c18: <dig> were distributed across seven chromosomes and their additive effect ranged from − <dig>  to  <dig>  and explained  <dig> – <dig> % of pv . nine qtls on six chromosomes were associated with c18: <dig>  with the additive effect ranging from − <dig>  to  <dig>  and explaining  <dig> – <dig> % of pv . twenty-one qtls on  <dig> chromosomes were significantly associated with c18: <dig>  which had − <dig>  to  <dig>  additive effect and explained  <dig> – <dig> % of pv . for c20: <dig>   <dig> qtls were detected across a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> in three environments . six of them were found in two or more environments, and the remaining four were only in one environment. nine qtls were observed for c22: <dig> distributed across a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  and singly explained  <dig> – <dig> % of pv .

co-localization of mapped candidate genes of b. rapa and b. oleracea with single-locus qtl
a total of  <dig> molecular markers were mapped to the new version of the tn map. this map covered a total length of  <dig>  cm with an average marker interval of  <dig>  cm. the length of the  <dig> linkage groups varied from  <dig>   to  <dig>   cm . thirty-four synteny blocks  and  <dig> insertion fragment islands  were identified between arabidopsis pseudochromosomes and tn dh genetic linkage groups by the in silico mapping approach . more than twenty-nine thousand homologous genes were found to underline the cis of  <dig> qtls associated with the concentrations of  <dig> different fatty acids, by comparative analysis between the linkage map of tn dh and the genome of arabidopsis . among them, a total of  <dig> key genes involving fatty acid metabolism were used as candidate genes in the present study . a number of important genes were found, such as fab <dig>  fad <dig>  fad <dig> and fae <dig>  but also five regulatory factors, lec <dig>  lec <dig>  fus <dig>  wri <dig> and abi <dig>  as the polyploid b. napus genome may typically contain six loci for each gene present in arabidopsis, these  <dig> genes were found to have  <dig> homologous genes mapped on the tn dh linkage map in total, including  <dig> key genes of  <dig> homologs underlying the cis of  <dig> qtls . all of the qtls with cis containing homologous genes were separately compared to the physical genomic regions of b. rapa  and b. oleracea . to compare with the b. rapa genome,  <dig> qtls containing candidate gene distributed on the a genome of the tn dh linkage map were used for analysis, accounting for  <dig> % of the total qtls on the a genome. in total,  <dig> genes in b. rapa matched those in arabidopsis underlying  <dig> qtl cis . for the c genome of the tn dh linkage map,  <dig> qtls were detected and  <dig>  of them contained candidate gene in arabidopsis. comparison of the candidate genes showed  <dig> genes in b. oleracea matched those in arabidopsis underlying  <dig> qtl cis . for example, on the c <dig> linkage group,  <dig> candidate genes  of arabidopsis were located in the cis of eight qtls, and  <dig> candidate genes of b. oleracea were found based on the candidate genes of arabidopsis, including the regulatory factor abi <dig> of previous studies .figure  <dig>

epistatic qtls and interaction analysis of candidate genes for fatty acid compositions
qtlnetwork_ <dig>  and genotype matrix mapping ver <dig>   software were used to identify the epistatic interactions for fatty acid compositions. twenty-four pairs of epistatic qtls involving  <dig> loci were identified by qtlnetwork_ <dig>  for  <dig> measured traits , with 1– <dig> epistatic qtl pairs for each trait. the proportion of total pv explained by all epistatic qtls was  <dig> – <dig> % for each trait. among  <dig> epistatic qtls, two, three and  <dig> were nn, an and aa interactions, respectively. a total of  <dig> loci interactions were identified by gmm, including  <dig> pairs of digenic and  <dig> pairs of trigenic interactions . by comparing the epistatic interactions by gmm and single qtl based on common markers,  <dig> pairs of epistatic interactions were associated with qtls. some of the epistatic qtls affected the level of more than one fatty acid composition. for example, the interactions of two loci associated with qtls qa8- <dig> and qc3- <dig> were detected by both types of software, which controlled different fatty acid compositions . this indicated that epistatic interactions were very important for fatty acid metabolism in b. napus.

for c16: <dig>  four pairs of epistatic qtls were detected by qtlnetwork_ <dig> , explaining  <dig> – <dig> % of pv. the interaction between qtl qa8- <dig> and qc9- <dig> explained  <dig> % of pv . the genes oleo <dig>  acc <dig>  fae <dig>  lpat <dig> and ats <dig> were underlying the qtl ci of qa8- <dig>  while lec <dig>  lec <dig>  acc <dig>  tag <dig>  kasiii and ats <dig> were underlying the ci of qc9- <dig> . a total of  <dig> significant loci interactions were identified for c16: <dig> by gmm, containing one pair with digenic and  <dig> pairs with trigenic interactions, most of these trigenic interactions have loci underlying three qtls of cis, including qtls qa8- <dig>  qa8- <dig> and qc3- <dig> . a number of homologous genes were mapped to the ci of qa8- <dig>  including lec <dig>  lec <dig>  acc <dig>  kasiii, fad <dig>  gpat <dig>  bccp <dig>  acbp, pdat, and ats <dig>  but only one homologous gene cyca <dig> for qc3- <dig> was found . all the results above suggested that the potential of these gene interactions increased the level of c16: <dig>  similar to c16: <dig>  a series of pairs of epistatic qtls and loci interactions for another nine traits were identified by qtlnetwork_ <dig>   and gmm , and numerous important genes underlying qtl cis were identified . for example, for c18: <dig>  c18: <dig> and c18: <dig>  besides the trigenic interaction of qtls qa8- <dig>  qa8- <dig> and qc3- <dig>  the interactions between qtls qc3- <dig> and qa8- <dig> were also identified, and fae <dig> was underlying the ci of qc3- <dig> 

cytoscape_v <dig> . <dig> software was used to investigate the interaction of candidate genes that were observed from the single and epistatic qtl results and the gene interaction network was constructed. the results revealed that the whole network incorporated  <dig> nodes and  <dig> edges, that could be divided into three sub-clusters: the five regulatory factors  and the genes that were directly affected by only one regulatory factor , the genes affected by two or more regulatory factors  and the genes indirectly affected by regulatory factors . the a cluster consisted of  <dig> nodes and  <dig> edges in total. the five regulatory factors formed a tightly intra-linked group, with each regulatory factor under the influence of at least two other regulatory factors, and lec <dig> and lec <dig> were especially affected by all other four regulatory factors. in addition to the five regulatory factors, bccp <dig> and cac <dig> were underlying the qtl cis. bccp <dig> was associated with qtls qa3- <dig> and qa8- <dig>  which affected c16: <dig>  c18: <dig> and c20:0; cac <dig> was associated with qtl qc9- <dig> and affected c18: <dig>  these two genes were both regulated by wri <dig>  the b cluster was composed of seven nodes and  <dig> edges, in which the genes were affected by at least two regulatory factors. sep <dig> and lfy in this group were directly affected by all five regulatory factors. lfy was linked to other eight genes , and two of them  were well-known important genes involved in fatty acid synthesis. the c cluster included  <dig> nodes and  <dig> edges, and  <dig> genes were detected to underline the qtl cis. fatb associated with qtl qa8- <dig> was notably affected by both fae <dig> and fad <dig>  and fatb also affected another eight genes  that were underlying the qtl cis. the network mentioned above indicated that the genes involved in fatty acid synthesis were directly or indirectly affected by regulatory factors.figure  <dig>

construct of a potential controlling pathway of fatty acids in b. napus
among the  <dig> genes of arabidopsis located in the cis of  <dig> qtls in b. napus,  <dig> were shown to have roles in  <dig> different pathways . among them,  <dig> genes were involved in at least one of the five pathways, including biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, fatty acid metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis and alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, with  <dig>  nine, nine, eight and six candidate genes, respectively . the potential pathway for fatty acid synthesis in b. napus, which included  <dig> genes and the five regulatory factors mentioned above, was constructed by combining the main pathways that involved interaction of candidate genes as well as knowledge of fatty acid regulatory pathways in arabidopsis . the candidate genes in the deduced pathways could be divided into three types: genes associated with the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway , the phospholipid synthesis and other pathways  and the triacylglycerol and fatty acid degradation .figure  <dig>

the diagrams of the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway in the plastid and the cytosol/endoplasmic reticulum could be divided into four categories: genes participating in early stages of fatty acid synthesis, fatty acid elongation and desaturation, triacylglycerol biosynthesis and regulators of fatty acid biosynthesis. at least  <dig> enzymes were involved in the plastidial fatty acid synthetic pathway  <cit> . accase was a major control point of the pathway among these enzymes  <cit> , and four subunits of accase were detected  and assigned to  <dig> qtls: acc <dig> was assigned to seven qtls: qa3- <dig>  qa5- <dig>  qa8- <dig>  qa8- <dig>  qa9- <dig>  qc3- <dig> and qc9-3; bccp <dig> to qtls qa3- <dig> and qa8-6; cac <dig> to qtl qc9-4; and cac <dig> to qtls qa4- <dig>  qa8- <dig> and qc6- <dig> . downstream from accase, fatty acids were constructed and elongated by each cycle with four reactions . in step  <dig>  two genes emb <dig> and at1g <dig> were found underlying the cis of one  and four qtls , respectively. candidate genes of kasiii  and fab <dig>  in step  <dig> and fab <dig> in step  <dig> were also observed. this suggested that all these candidate genes in qtl cis could affect the traits through their action in early stages of fatty acid synthesis.

most c18:0-acp produced by elongation was desaturated by the stearoyl-acp desaturase in step  <dig>  and fab <dig>  and at5g <dig>  were found. some important candidate genes were found to be associated with fatty acid elongation and desaturation; for example, fae <dig> and cer <dig> appeared in step  <dig>  fae <dig> was associated with qtls qa1- <dig> detected by c18: <dig> and qa8- <dig> with all  <dig> traits, and qc3- <dig> with nine traits but not c18: <dig>  cer <dig> was assigned to qa4- <dig>  qa5- <dig>  qa10- <dig> and qc9- <dig>  which were detected with c16: <dig>  fas, c18: <dig> and c18: <dig>  respectively.

triacylglycerol synthesis could be divided into four main steps  <cit> . dhap could be reduced to g3p catalyzed by gpdh, and gpdhc <dig>  and sdp <dig>  were revealed in this step. from g3p to pa of steps  <dig> and  <dig>  fatty acids were sequentially transferred from coa to positions  <dig> and  <dig> of g3p catalyzed by gpat and lpat, respectively. gpat was composed of  <dig> subunits  <cit> , seven of which except for gpat <dig>  gpat <dig> and gpat <dig> were observed in this step. among them, gpat <dig>  gpat <dig> and gpat <dig> were associated with qtl qa8-2; gpat <dig> with qtls qa3- <dig>  qc3- <dig> and qc5-1; gpat <dig> with qtls qa4- <dig>  qa8- <dig> and qc6-1; gpat <dig> with qtls qa8- <dig> and qa10-3; and ats <dig> with qtls qa3- <dig>  qa5- <dig>  qa8- <dig>  qa8- <dig>  qa9- <dig> and qc9- <dig> . lpat was a main enzyme in step  <dig> with five subunits  <cit> , and lpat <dig>  lpat <dig>  lpat <dig> and lpat <dig> were associated with four , two , one  and four  qtls, respectively. lpp <dig> was associated with qtls qa3- <dig> and qc5- <dig> that catalyze dephosphorylation of pa to release dag in step  <dig>  step  <dig> was the final step of tag synthesis and tag <dig> , at3g <dig>  and pda  were observed in this step. many genes or qtls involved in one step indicated that the fatty acid synthesis in b. napus was very complicated.

besides those genes that had direct activities in catalyzing fatty acid synthesis, some regulators  underlying qtl cis were also found . the interaction analysis indicated that wri <dig> directly affected bccp <dig> and cac <dig>  and indirectly affected fab <dig> and fatb in early stages of fatty acid synthesis regulation, while wri <dig>  lec1/ <dig>  fus <dig> and abi <dig> all indirectly affected fae <dig>  fad <dig> and fad <dig>  which played important roles in later modifying and transporting processes. lec <dig> and lec <dig> were underlying the cis of five qtls  and six qtls , respectively. both lec <dig> and lec <dig> affected nine fatty acid compositions, except for c18: <dig>  in different environments. fus <dig> located in the ci of the qtl qc7- <dig> that was only associated with c18: <dig>  wri <dig> located in the cis of qtls qa4- <dig>  qa5- <dig> and qa10- <dig> was associated with c16: <dig>  fas and c18: <dig>  respectively. abi <dig> was associated with three qtls  and affected the levels of c18: <dig>  fas, c18: <dig>  c18: <dig> and c20: <dig> . moreover, the epistatic effects of major gene–gene interactions were also identified in fatty acid synthesis . for example, the major genes fatb, fae <dig>  fad <dig> and fad <dig> were all under the influence of each other and all could affect the gene tag <dig> in the final step of tag synthesis, and then affected the level of different fatty acids . all these findings indicated that the regulatory pathway of fatty acid synthesis was a complex network, controlled by a large number of genes and also affected by gene–gene interactions.

potential phospholipid synthesis , and triacylglycerol and fatty acid degradation , were also predicted in b. napus based on knowledge of acyl-lipid metabolism in arabidopsis  <cit> . g3p was converted to dag3p by sequential acylation reactions in steps  <dig> and  <dig>  which was regulated by gpat and lpat, and the homologous genes involved in the two steps were very similar to the genes in steps  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. then dag3p was converted to pc or pe by a series of enzyme reactions. in the pathway of triacylglycerol and fatty acid degradation, a number of homologous genes were also found, and the six genes in step  <dig> were the same as the genes in step  <dig>  moreover, gene lpi <dig>  which functioned in degradation of tag to mag, affected the level of nine traits but not c20: <dig> 

in addition to the  <dig> qtls with candidate genes mapped in the cis, the remaining  <dig> qtls also affected the concentrations of one or two fatty acids. qtl qa4- <dig> on chromosome a <dig> with additive effect on traits c16: <dig> and c18: <dig> might be assigned to step  <dig>  with potential ketoacyl acp synthetase activity. qtl qc5- <dig> might be assigned to step  <dig> with a similar function to fad <dig>  as the qtl had a consistent additive effect on traits c18: <dig> and c18: <dig>  qtl qc9- <dig> might be a pleiotropic locus with a similar function to fae <dig> as it had an additive effect on traits c18: <dig> and c22: <dig>  the remaining  <dig> qtls only had additive effects on one trait. based on the premise that plastidic synthesis and modification should result in consistent qtl effects on products in any of the individual sets of saturated fatty acids  <cit> , qa7- <dig>  qa7- <dig> and qc9- <dig> affected c16: <dig>  and qa1- <dig> and qa6- <dig> affected c18: <dig>  which allows us to assign these qtls tentatively to early stages of synthesis. the other  <dig> qtls may be assigned to desaturation and elongase steps, as they affected c18: <dig>  c20: <dig>  c20: <dig>  c22: <dig>  c22: <dig> and fas. generally, it is important to take into account all the preceding synthetic and modification steps where a qtl could be identified for a particular fatty acid  <cit> ; however, assigning a specific enzyme activity to these qtls is relatively complex.

discussion
a total of  <dig> qtls and a large number of pairs of epistatic loci for  <dig> fatty acid compositions were identified using qtl analysis. then  <dig> homologous genes were mapped in the cis of  <dig> qtls. qtl mapping and interaction analysis of candidate genes enabled the construction of a regulatory pathway that controlled the different concentrations of fatty acids in b. napus.

single qtl mapping of each fatty acid concentration showed that qtls on a <dig> and c <dig> were highly correlated. qtl qa8- <dig> on a <dig> affected concentrations of all  <dig> types of fatty acids, and explained pv of individual fatty acids ranging from  <dig> % for c20: <dig> to  <dig> % for c20: <dig>  and qtl qa8- <dig> affected seven fatty acids; meanwhile, both qtls qc3- <dig> and qc3- <dig> on c <dig> affected nine fatty acids but not c18: <dig>  all these results revealed that these qtls were major qtls, consistent with previous studies  <cit> . for the two qtls on c <dig>  the alleles from ‘ningyou 7’ conferred higher levels of c20: <dig>  c20: <dig>  c22: <dig> and c22: <dig>  but had negative effects on levels of c16: <dig>  c18: <dig>  c18: <dig> and c18: <dig>  the group c16: <dig>  c18: <dig>  c18: <dig> and c18: <dig> were positively correlated with each other, and likewise for the group c20: <dig>  c20: <dig>  c22: <dig> and c22:1; however, the two groups showed a negative correlation . the fact that qtls clustered in certain linkage groups and controlled different traits with opposite effects, corroborated strongly with the significant positive and negative correlations among the fatty acids analyzed. besides the two major qtls on a <dig> and c <dig>  another  <dig> qtls also affected more than one fatty acid. moreover, the number of qtls associated with a single fatty acid in the present study ranged from nine  to  <dig> , and a total of  <dig> qtls for all  <dig> traits detected were more than that from previous studies  <cit> , with a number of new qtls for different fatty acids. no qtls for c16: <dig> were found on a <dig>  a <dig> and c <dig> previously  <cit> , suggesting that the  <dig> qtls on these chromosomes in the tn population were all new qtls. the unsaturated fatty acids were synthesized as a result of the fatty acid desaturation pathway, starting from c18:0; however, only a few qtls for c18: <dig> were detected in previous studies. zhao et al. identified two qtls for c18: <dig> on a <dig> and a <dig>  <cit> , smooker et al. identified one qtl on a <dig>  <cit> , and burns et al. detected four qtls respectively on a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig>  <cit> . herein,  <dig> qtls across seven chromosomes were detected, and the qtls on a <dig> , a <dig> , c <dig>  and c <dig>  were new. qtls for c18: <dig> were identified on  <dig> chromosomes except a <dig>  a <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  <cit> . in the present study, there were  <dig> qtls associated with c18: <dig> across seven chromosomes, nine of which also affected other fatty acids. qtls for c18: <dig> were identified on  <dig> chromosomes except a <dig>  a <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  <cit> , indicating that the two qtls  for c18: <dig> on c <dig> were new. there were  <dig> qtls for c18: <dig> identified here, and three qtls  mapped on a <dig> and one qtl  on c <dig> were new qtls, but the former  <dig> qtls were distributed across  <dig> chromosomes excluding a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  <cit> . many qtls for c22: <dig> were identified on  <dig> chromosomes excluding a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  <cit> . two major qtls associated with c22: <dig> on a <dig> and c <dig> chromosomes were observed in the present study, which was consistent with previous studies  <cit> , and two new qtls  were mapped on a <dig> and a <dig> chromosomes .

generally, additive effects are considered as the main factors contributing to variations in quantitative traits  <cit> . however, epistatic effects can also play an important role in complex traits in b. napus  <cit> . epistatic qtls was found to explain pv ranging from  <dig> % for c18: <dig> to  <dig> % for c20: <dig> , showing similar trends to previous studies  <cit> . moreover, interactions among  <dig> loci were identified by gmm, including  <dig> pairs of digenic and  <dig> pairs of trigenic interactions . a number of candidate genes were mapped to the cis of these qtls. these results showed that epistasis may substantially contribute to variation in oil concentration in different crops.

the regulatory pathway constructed in this study was based on qtl information and the interaction of candidate genes associated with the single and epistatic qtls of  <dig> fatty acids, as well as previous knowledge concerning brassica species and arabidopsis  <cit> . a large number of important genes were found to be candidate genes for the processes of fatty acid metabolism. among the  <dig> genes and five regulatory factors detected,  <dig> genes  affected more than one trait, and fae <dig> and ats <dig> affected nine  and  <dig> traits, respectively. previous studies found that fae <dig> affected oil composition in several steps of seed fatty acid synthesis and modification pathways in b. oleracea  <cit>  and b. napus  <cit> . in b. napus, the orthologs of fad <dig> and fad <dig> were mapped in different linkage groups of the genome. bnafad <dig> loci were mapped in linkage groups a <dig>  a <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  <cit> , and bnafad <dig> located in different linkage groups was found to be responsible for the high c18: <dig> level  <cit>  and erucic acid content  <cit> . it seemed clear that a major functional variant of fad <dig> orthologs in the a genome was located on linkage group a <dig>  but unclear whether fad <dig> loci were present in the brassica c genome  <cit> . the ortholog of fad <dig> was identified in the control of c18: <dig> level in b. napus, and a specific marker of fad <dig> was located in the ci of the qtl for c18: <dig> in linkage group a <dig>  <cit> . in the present study, fad <dig> was located in three qtls cis: qa3- <dig> by c16: <dig> and c18: <dig>  qc3- <dig> by c20: <dig>  and qc5- <dig> by c18: <dig> and c20: <dig> using in silico mapping. the homologous genes of fad <dig> were mapped in the cis of seven qtls: qa3- <dig> by c16: <dig> and c18:1; qa5- <dig> by c18: <dig> and fas; qa5- <dig> by c18: <dig> and c18:3; qa8- <dig> by c18: <dig>  c18: <dig>  c20: <dig>  c20: <dig>  c22: <dig>  c22: <dig> and fas; qa10- <dig> by c18:0; qc3- <dig> by c20:0; and qc5- <dig> by c18: <dig> and c20: <dig>  taken together, these findings increased the understanding of the important genes affecting the processes of fatty acid metabolism in b. napus.

despite the multiple studies on the function of several important genes in fatty acid biosynthesis  <cit> , the regulatory mechanism of the pathway is still not well understood in b. napus. five regulatory factors  were involved in the process concerning the fatty acid biosynthetic pathways, which might correspond to new important findings in this study. both lec <dig> and lec <dig> could act as positive regulators upstream of abi <dig> and fus <dig> in the control of seed maturation  <cit> , and several studies revealed that these four regulatory factors might have a function in regulation of fatty acid metabolism  <cit> . wri <dig>  which acted downstream of lec <dig>  controlled expression of a subset of genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis  <cit> , and overexpression of wri <dig> caused an increased tag level in both seeds and leaves of arabidopsis  <cit> . in this study, each of the five regulatory factors was under the influence of at least two other regulatory factors, and lec <dig> and lec <dig> were especially affected by all four other regulatory factors . moreover, all five regulatory factors were associated with c18: <dig>  but none affected c18: <dig>  conversion of acetyl-coa to malonyl-coa by acetyl carboxylase  is one of the most committed steps in fatty acid biosynthesis  <cit> , and reduction of accase activity caused a decrease of fatty acid content in the range of  <dig> – <dig> % in transgenic seeds of oilseed crops  <cit> . most of the enzymes involved in de novo fatty acid synthesis seemed to be affected by wri <dig>  <cit> , and only wri <dig> of the five regulatory factors had a direct impact on transcription levels of genes in the plastidial fatty acid synthetic pathway  <cit> . as a result of the interaction analysis of candidate genes, two genes cac <dig> and bccp <dig>  which encoded subunits of accase, were found to be under the influence of wri <dig>  in the process of fatty acid elongation and desaturation, no candidate genes were shown to be under the influence of the five regulatory factors in this study . among the targets of the five regulatory factors, lfy might represent a key factor mediating the regulatory action of elongation and desaturation processes, as it was directly affected by all five regulatory factors and also regulated important downstream genes, including fad <dig>  fae <dig> and fatb, and these three genes regulated a series of downstream genes . lfy was arguably the most important floral meristem identity gene, which encoded a plant-specific transcription factor and controlled multiple aspects of floral morphogenesis  <cit> . it was striking that lfy played an important role in the regulatory pathway of fatty acid metabolism, and is worthy of future study.

overall, these results provided important new insights into the regulatory model for the control of oil synthesis in b. napus and enhanced our understanding of the fatty acid synthesis pathways.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study,  <dig> individual qtls and a large number pairs of epistatic interactions contributing to fatty acid biosynthesis were identified. by using in silico mapping analysis,  <dig> homologous genes of a. thaliana that could be involved in fatty acid metabolism within the cis of  <dig> qtls were found. after qtl mapping and candidate gene analysis, a potential regulatory network controlling fatty acid metabolism was revealed in b. napus. our results provided new insights into the regulatory model for the control of oil synthesis in b. napus.
