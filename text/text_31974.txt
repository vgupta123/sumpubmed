BACKGROUND
eukaryote genomes contain repetitive dna sequences that can be classified into two groups: tandemly repeated sequences  and dispersed sequences . microsatellites  are tandem repeats of a dna motif, one to six bases long, showing high levels of polymorphism based on changes in the repeat number. they are highly abundant and considered selectively neutral sequences and almost randomly distributed in the mammalian genome  <cit> . in spite of the wide applications of mss and their importance in genetic and evolutionary studies, the mechanisms of the genesis of these sequences are still not fully understood. it is thought that point mutation is the dominant source of generation of short repeat mss before slippage becomes the dominant mechanism  <cit> . however, based on the close association described between retroposons and mss in several mammalian species , a completely different mechanism for ms generation has been proposed: it is thought that retrotranscripts undergo 3' polyadenylation – similar to mrna polyadenylation  <cit>  – prior to their incorporation into the genome, and that the extension of this preexisting repeat can generate a-rich mss  <cit> . nevertheless, this mechanism would not explain the recent observations  that mss can also be associated with both 5' and internal regions of some retroposons. an explanation for the latter association is the mechanism described by wilder and hollocher  <cit>  which implies the conversion of an existing sequence with high cryptic simplicity located in dipteran mini-me elements into tandemly repeated dna. the importance of repeat elements as ms sources is still unclear. whereas nadir et al.  <cit>  proposed alu elements as the preferential source for the origin of human mss, morgante et al.  <cit>  showed a significant association between mss and the single/low-copy fraction of the plant genome.

in mammals, most retroposons can be classified into three basic types: sines, lines, and ltr  elements, with sines being the most abundant. sines are 80– <dig> bp long genomic repeats, apparently originating from trna . a typical sine is flanked by short direct repeats and consists of three regions: a trna-related region, which contains an internal promoter for rna polymerase iii; a central family-specific or trna-unrelated region; and an a-rich tail . in carnivores, the trna-derived sines , also known as can-sines, are thought to derive from trnalys  <cit> . they are also characterized by a polypyrimidine region  in their central region, and a polyadenylation aataaa signal and the rna polymerase iii tttt or tctt terminator in the a-rich tail  <cit> . the trna-related region is more conserved than the unrelated part and the rna polymerase iii promoter is the most conserved, while poly-y and a-rich tail are highly variable both in sequence and in length  <cit> . at first, it was thought that trna sine distribution was limited to doglike carnivores . however, recent works  <cit>  have detected the trna sine in the genome of several species of catlike carnivores  but not beyond carnivores.

in this study we constructed a comprehensive database of carnivore ms clones from genbank to explore the role of interspersed repeats in the generation of repeat arrays. we focused on trna sines which constitute the best characterized and most abundant interspersed repeat element in the carnivore genome. we observed two modes of ms genesis in two regions of trna sines in which mss have repeatedly evolved. this observation led us to hypothesize that sines generating mss could explain part of the different repeat array content and distribution among and within genomes. we also demonstrated that mss associated with trna sines were more complex and had less potential instability than those not associated. the observations reported here therefore have practical implications since the use of mss related with trna sines calls for special attention from the designing of experiments to the interpretation of results.

RESULTS
database description
we obtained a non-redundant database of  <dig> ms-containing clones for a total length of  <dig>  bp representing  <dig> species from  <dig> of the  <dig> carnivore families . the mephitidae family was not included. however, there was a clear overrepresentation of domestic cat , contributing  <dig> % of the total number of clones and  <dig> % of total length, and domestic dog , with  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. each one of these two distantly related species is representative of the two major clades of carnivores: feloidea and canoidea superfamilies. the rest of the species contributed less than 8% of the two values, number of clones and sequence length.

identification and characterization of interspersed repeat elements
repeatmasker masked  <dig>  clones; of these,  <dig> contained trna sines,  <dig> lines,  <dig> ltr elements,  <dig> mirs , and  <dig> dna transposons. it was possible for the same clone to contain more than one kind of interspersed repeat. in the  <dig> trna sine-containing clones, we found  <dig> trna sines of which  <dig> were full-size. thirty-two clones therefore contained two sines, in  <dig> of which they were oriented in the same way. we also explored the non-masked clone sequences using pairwise comparisons with blast to search for potentially new repeat elements but no new elements were found.

we obtained a rough estimate of the number of trna sine copies per haploid genome for those species with the highest number of clones . we estimated  <dig> * <dig> trna sines in cat,  <dig> * <dig> in dog,  <dig> * <dig> in badger,  <dig> * <dig> in giant panda, and  <dig> * <dig> in spotted hyena.

repeat motifs associated with interspersed repeat elements
a sputnik search in our database for mss revealed  <dig> repeat arrays in the  <dig> clone sequences. table  <dig> shows the most abundant  repeat motifs. we identified  <dig> out of the  <dig> possible motifs from monomer to pentamer. the  <dig> % of the repeat arrays were dinucleotides and  <dig> % were tetranucleotides, while mono-, tri- and pentanucleotides each accounted for less than 5% of the total. none of the representatives of the n ms family, which are mainly located either within or very close to coding sequences  <cit> , was found. all tri-, tetra- and pentanucleotides have an a in their repeat unit.

when sputnik was applied to the masked clones, we found that  <dig> and  <dig> out of the  <dig> repeat arrays were associated with trna sines and other repeats, respectively. out of  <dig> repeat motifs,  <dig> were not represented in the masked sequences, but this could be due to their low abundance in the whole database .

implications of trna sines for the genesis of mss
overall, the abundance of motifs differs among databases . when pairwise comparisons were conducted, there were no significant differences in motif abundance between non-masked and other repeats clones  but there were significant differences between trna sine and the other two databases .

the trna sine clones had a highly significant lack of ac repeats  and an abundance of ag  and aaat  repeats compared with the combined values of the other two databases . to know in detail how these differences were produced, we classified mss in relation to the location in the trna sine clones . again, we found high significant differences in the overall motif distribution within the trna sine clone sequence  and in pairwise comparisons among the different regions: poly-y, a-rich tail and other parts . poly-y region had a highly significant abundance of ag repeats  and the a-rich tail had a high number of a , aaag , aaat , and aaaat  repeats. in addition, both regions showed a lack of ac repeats . no mss were found in any other parts of the sine sequences.

these results were based on the  <dig> trna sine-containing clones but only  <dig> of these  had both poly-y and a-rich tail . in the other clones, these regions were either not clearly distinguishable  or there was only a fragment of the trna related region . taking into account only those clones containing sines with both regions, we observed that  <dig> % of the poly-y and  <dig> % of the a-rich tail generated mss. in these clones,  <dig> mss were found to be distributed as follows:  <dig> % in poly-y,  <dig> % in a-rich tail, and  <dig> % downstream from the sine. in a detailed analysis of the sine sequence , the poly-y tract produced  <dig> repeat motifs, which were mainly ag  repeats. on the other hand, a-rich tail produced a higher motif diversity , although these were limited to a-rich mss. thus, although only  <dig> clones had both regions, these differences in distribution of mss among databases were mainly produced by poly-y region which concentrated  <dig> % of the ag and only  <dig> % of ac repeats found in the whole database and by the a-rich tail which concentrated  <dig> % of the aaat and only  <dig> % of ac repeats found in the whole database.

to discard that the observed significant tendencies were a result of the bias in species composition, we repeated the same statistical analyses with three different subsets of data: one containing only domestic dog clones, the second including cat clones, and the third compiling clones from other carnivore species. in all cases we observed the same tendencies corroborating that our findings are a common pattern in carnivores. the abundance of motifs among the databases and the statistics for these three subsets are shown in the supplementary material table 2– <dig> . we also repeated all the following analyses for these subsets.

implications of trna-sines for ms instability
although we could not measure ms polymorphism, repeat array length correlates well with ms instability. overall, dimers and tetramers presented highly significant differences in size frequency distributions . in general, the most common allele for dimer distribution was shifted further from the minimum ms size than tetramers . when comparing dimer distribution between mss in non-masked clones and poly-y region – which mainly produced dimers  -, we observed that poly-y region became more truncated and had shorter alleles . for tetramers, the shape of size frequency distribution is similar in both databases but a-rich tail – which mainly produced tetramers  – had usually shorter alleles than non-masked clones . mean array length can be used to summarize the location of the frequency distribution, although this does not capture the entire spectrum of variation in these non-normal distributions . on average for dimers, arrays in non-masked clones and poly-y region had  <dig>  and  <dig>  repeats, respectively. for this class, poly-y region contained significantly shorter arrays than non-masked clones . on average for tetramers, arrays in non-masked clones and a-rich tail had  <dig>  and  <dig>  repeats, respectively. for this class, the a-rich tail generated significantly shorter arrays than non-masked clones . as we did for the other analyses, we also repeated these comparisons for the three subsets, except for tetramer within cats, which have a small sample size . we obtained the same results with one exception . we did not find significant differences when comparing tetramer mss contained in non-masked clones and a-rich tail within dog but this is explained by an outlayer length value . when this value is removed from the analysis, differences become statistically significant .

it is important to note that these comparisons do not represent assessments of orthologous loci, they represent one randomly chosen allele from each of many microsatellite loci within a species. thus, the observed length variation among our trna-sine clones may be due to variation among trna-sine family or subfamily sequences. however, slippage occurs in mss located in poly-y and a-rich region, generating length variability within species after the insertion of the sine. this can be observed in published trna-sine clones containing a single variable ms in either poly-y and a-rich tail   <cit> , american marten , wolverine , and american badger   <cit> ; catlike: spotted hyena   <cit> , asiatic lion   <cit> , and small indian mongoose   <cit> ).

implications of trna-sines for ms complexity
to elucidate whether the contiguous existence of poly-y and a-rich tail or similar structures in other interspersed repeats may be a source of compound mss, we compared the presence of this kind of mss among databases. out of  <dig> non-masked clones,  <dig> contained compound arrays. the number of compounds was not significantly different from that calculated from the trna sine  and other repeats  databases. even when we calculated the number of compounds in the trna sines database taking into account only clones with both poly-y tract and a-rich tail, there were no significant differences between databases . moreover, we did not find any significant increase in the number of compound mss in the sine database when we changed the number of non-repeat nucleotides separating two adjacent arrays . however, the presence of these two regions  should imply a source of multiple arrays in the same clone. the number of clones with multiple arrays in trna sine sequences was  <dig> which was significantly higher than the number calculated for non-masked sequences  and for other repeats .

on the other hand, of the  <dig> repeat arrays in non-masked clones,  <dig> were imperfect and this number was not significantly different from the number calculated for trna sines  and for other repeats .

the same tendencies were apparent when the three species subsets were analysed separately .

discussion
our database was generated from ms-containing clones of carnivore species which are generally used in population genetics and individual identification studies. these mss had been isolated following the traditional method, which is known to produce a nonrepresentative sample of the genome. two common procedures repeatedly used in traditional ms isolation that may cause biases in our database are: i) the use of sau3ai restriction enzyme to fragment genomic dna, and ii) the use of ac probes to screen the libraries. however, and despite the biases inherent in isolation methods, the drawn conclusions are still pertinent or in some cases even reinforced .

sau3ai recognizes sites that are well-conserved in dispersed repeats , and in the b-box of the trna polymerase iii promoter of our trna sines. as a result, the sines found in our databases were often truncated , conserving the 5' end in  <dig> cases and the 3' end, including the poly-y and a-rich tail regions, in  <dig> cases. we found  <dig> full trna sines which could be used as phylogenetic markers. this fact has led some authors  to state that the use of sau3ai may result in bias towards the isolation of repeat-associated mss. however, such a bias could not exist taking into account the high frequency of cutting owing to the restriction recognition site for sau3ai  is only four nucleotides in length.

the preferential use of n probes for library screening was reflected in the repeat motif content of our database where 58% were ac repeats, clearly overrepresented  <cit> . however, in this work we have demonstrated that ac repeats are not statistically associated with trna-sines – only  <dig> % of the ac repeats in the whole database were located within the sine sequence. similar results have been found in humans where more than 80% of ac repeats are not associated with alu sequences  <cit> . using ac probes would therefore reduce the final number of sines captured in the ms isolation process.

our trna sine copy estimates per haploid genome in dog  were very similar to the values obtained from the dog genome sequence . it seems then reasonable to think that the values we obtained for the other carnivore species  may also be realistic approximations. even in the case where the above mentioned biases do apply – probably reducing trna sine captured -, it is unlikely they would produce a difference of an order of magnitude with published estimates .

we also observed that poly-y  and a-rich tail  regularly gave rise to mss. the different repeat motifs derived from these regions  suggested two mechanisms for ms generation. the first mechanism was illustrated by the a-rich tail and it has already been well described in human alu sequences  <cit> . this mode of genesis implies the presence of a pre-existing ms and subsequent modifications by point mutation and slippage events. it has been suggested that the pre-existing ms could arise from the incorporation of the retrotranscript with an extended polyadenylated tail, a feature which may also serve to guide their retroposition in the genome  <cit> . although the pre-existing ms was an adenine tract, this evolved into more complex structures where we observe certain variability in the repeat motif, mostly centered in a rich ms .

the second mechanism is based on the fact that the poly-y region has a nucleotide composition highly biased towards pyrimidines. it could therefore be defined as a site with high cryptic simplicity  <cit> , which is a dna sequence biased in nucleotide composition and made up of short sequence motifs that, initially, are not tandemly repeated. the functional significance of this structure currently remains unknown, but its presence in these elements makes the sine an important source of ms genesis. generation of mss at this site depends on base substitutions that create a tandemly duplicated motif, and on subsequent slippage mutations to increase the number of copies. thus, a few c ↔ t transitions, the most frequent substitutions, are enough to transform cryptic simplicity sequences into tandemly repeated dna. the initial bias in the base substitution was reflected in the repeat motifs generated,  <dig> % of which were ags. this tendency for invariability and the greater number of mss produced by the poly-y region suggest that slippage mutation is active during the early stages of ms genesis. this ms-generating mutation process has also been shown in an internal region of the mini-me elements of dipterans  <cit> . the poly-y region has also been found to be specific of other mammalian sines, such as rabbit c repeat  <cit> , rodent dip  <cit> , bat ves  <cit> , and insectivore tal, eri- <dig> and eri- <dig>  <cit> , showing that the action of the two mechanisms that generate mss are not exclusive to the trna sines.

it is known that different ms motifs, motif classes and even abundances are not equally represented in species belonging to different groups  <cit>  or even within the genome of any one particular species  <cit> . these differences are still not well-understood and it has been hypothesized that they may be caused by species-specific differences in the dna synthesis and repair machinery  <cit> , selection  <cit> , or base composition  <cit> . although trna sines are not the only source of mss in carnivore genomes, these elements could explain part of the differences in the distribution of mss within a particular genome due to their high abundance and their preference for insertion at specific sites – such as around the r bands  <cit>  and clustering or insertion into other mobile genetic elements  <cit> . they could also explain differences among phylogenetically distant species or groups, since the interspersed repeat families generating mss may be lineage specific. along these lines, our results would indicate that trna sines have a significant effect on the overall distribution of some repeat motifs in carnivores, especially ag and aaat repeats.

the strong association between repeat elements and mss has been largely used for different purposes, such as: i) to develop new, codominant multiplex marker technologies such as s-sap  <cit>  or inter-alupcr  <cit> ; ii) to build ms-enriched libraries by amplifying sau3ai inserts with a conserved sine primer and a flanking vector primer  <cit> ; iii) to discover new sines, especially in species for which little information is available concerning their repeat element content  <cit> ; and iv) to discover new sine loci which could be used to reconstruct phylogenies  <cit> . in this study we detected  <dig> completed sines whose flanking regions are targets for primer design and could be used as phylogenetic markers.

in spite of these applications, mss associated with interspersed repeats not only distort estimates of the genomic distribution of mss useful for genome mapping  <cit> , but also entail some methodological disadvantages. firstly, genotyping with mss associated with repeat elements is very hard. placing one of the pcr primers within a highly repeated element might cause weak amplification, high background and difficulty in locus-specific amplification  <cit> . moreover, if the primers were designed up- and downstream from the repeated element, the expected large size of the pcr product might cause problems in the resolution of the amplified products  <cit> . our results also showed that potential instability in mss associated with trna sines was lower than in non-associated mss. several studies  have shown that ms mutation rate increases with an increasing number of repeat units; this is considered the single most important factor affecting the mutation rate. the isolation of non-masked ms clones is therefore advisable on account of their high potential informative content. it has been argued that point mutations break up perfect repeats and reduce the mutation rates of mss  <cit> . since there are not significant differences in the number of imperfect repeat arrays among databases, the higher content of short repeat arrays in mss associated with trna sine cannot entirely be attributed to imperfections. finally, most of the applications involving mss as genetic markers are based on variations in the length of the pcr product, which is expected to vary according to single-step changes in the number of repeats. however, it has been shown that poly-y is responsible for variation in length in the ms flanking region within species . this is probably due to the fact that cryptically simple sequences are susceptible to undergo slippage in a similar manner to mss, but at lower rates  <cit> . we also detected a larger number of clones with multiple mss in the trna sine database owing to the presence of poly-y and a-rich tail. this may also explain the non-neutral observation of ms clustering  <cit> . both cases mentioned preclude the basic assumptions of ms mutational models. as a result, the interpretation of the data obtained from mss associated with trna sines may induce erroneous conclusions. thus, we propose avoiding the use of ms associated with interspersed repeats as genetic markers.

CONCLUSIONS
in this report we have shown how trna sines, the most abundant carnivore and a lineage-specific sine, are clearly responsible for generating an important fraction of carnivore mss. more specifically, we have demonstrated that not only the a-rich tails but also an internal region  of these elements regularly expand into lengthy mss via two different mechanisms: the expansion of pre-existing tandem repeats and the conversion of sequences with high cryptic simplicity into tandemly repetitive dna. the ms genesis in trna-sines is not only involved in complex patterns, such as multiple repeated arrays and length variation in the flanking regions, and is responsible for shorter repeat arrays, but may also explain differences in ms distribution among and within species genomes. the mechanism we have described in trna sines may also be generalized to other interspersed repeats. based on the negative effect of the association between mss and interspersed repeats, we recommend avoiding the use of these mss as genetic markers. we suggest applying computer tools after initial sequencing in order to detect interspersed repeats in ms-containing clones and taking special attention when designing isolation methods .
