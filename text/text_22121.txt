BACKGROUND
heterologous expression of recombinant proteins in escherichia coli can result in the production of insoluble inclusion bodies. recent statistics show that less than half of the m. tuberculosis  proteins expressed in e. coli are soluble  <cit> . therefore, the non-pathogenic bacterium mycobacterium smegmatis is often used as an alternative, more closely related host for the expression of mycobacterial proteins. furthermore, m. smegmatis may also provide mycobacterium-specific chaperones, which can help correct folding of mtb proteins  <cit> .

during nickel affinity purification, it has been observed that a protein of  <dig> kda is co-purified with polyhistidine-tagged recombinant proteins while using m. smegmatis as an expression system. this contaminant was previously identified as the hsp <dig> chaperone groel <dig> of m. smegmatis  <cit> . the protein sequence of groel <dig> shows a histidine-rich c-terminus , which is likely to be the reason for the observed nickel sepharose binding  <cit> .

unlike most other bacteria, mycobacteria possess two hsp <dig> chaperone groel genes, one of which is arranged in the bicistronic groesl operon  <cit> . m. smegmatis also encodes a third hsp <dig> protein , which is more distantly related to groel <dig>  and groel <dig>   <cit> . although groel <dig> of m. smegmatis can be found in the same operon as groes, an arrangement indispensable for the chaperone function in bacteria, its histidine-rich tail is distinct from the more typical glycine-methionine-rich c-terminal region found in groel <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, groel <dig> is an essential gene and exists in all actinobacteria, in contrast to groel <dig>  <cit> . recently, it has been shown that groel <dig> and groes are expressed more strongly than groel <dig>  which might have arisen from a difference in stability of the predicted post-transcriptionally cleaved mrnas for groes and groel <dig>  <cit> . consistent with the current chaperone model in mycobacteria, one chaperone, here groel <dig>  would act as the main house keeping chaperone in m. smegmatis, with the other chaperones  adopting more specialised functions. indeed, groel <dig> of m. tuberculosis was recently identified as being associated with nucleotides, suggesting a role as a dna chaperone, while groel <dig> of m. smegmatis was found to have a role in mycolic acid biosynthesis during biofilm formation  <cit> .

the co-purification of groel <dig> with histidine-tagged recombinant proteins can be particularly problematic since native groel <dig> is expressed at relatively high levels, meaning that in the case of a low yield of recombinant protein, groel <dig> may well compete with the protein of interest for binding sites on nickel affinity beads. minimal sample manipulation is recommended during protein purification to improve efficiency. therefore, additional steps required to remove groel <dig> can result in a significant loss of the protein of interest.

in this article, we describe an m. smegmatis expression strain containing a mutant version of groel <dig>  termed groel1Δc, which consists of a groel <dig> gene without a coding sequence for the histidine-rich c-terminal tail. we show that groel1Δc is a functional protein, which no longer co-purifies when using nickel affinity purification and we provide evidence that proteins purified from this strain are correctly folded, active and that they behave identically to those purified from the original expression strain. taken together, our data demonstrate that m. smegmatis groel1Δc is a competent protein expression strain, which allows the efficient removal of the troublesome contaminant groel <dig> without the requirement of additional purification steps.

methods
bacterial strains and media
the e. coli strains dh5α  and hb <dig>  were used for cloning of expression constructs and the target substrate to generate the mutant version of groel <dig> using standard procedures  <cit> . transformants were selected in luria broth containing the appropriate antibiotics.

m. smegmatis mc <dig> was used as the parent  strain for the groel1Δc strain. both m. smegmatis strains were maintained in middlebrook 7h <dig> or 7h <dig> medium supplemented with  <dig> %  glycerol, 10% adc,  <dig> %  tween- <dig> and the appropriate antibiotics.

for biofilm formation,  <dig> ml of biofilm media was inoculated with  <dig> μl of saturated culture and incubated at 30°c without disturbance  <cit> .

for the expression of the recombination proteins in m. smegmatis in order to create the mutant form of groel <dig>   <dig> % succinate  was added as a carbon source to 7h <dig> medium supplemented with  <dig> %  glycerol,  <dig> %  tween and the appropriate antibiotics. expression of his-tagged recombinant proteins in m. smegmatis was performed in 7h <dig> medium supplemented with  <dig> %  glucose as carbon source. acetamide was added to a final concentration of  <dig> %  at  <dig>  od <dig> and at  <dig>  od <dig> for the expression of the recombination proteins and his-tagged recombinant proteins, respectively.

plasmids, constructs and oligonucleotides
all plasmids and constructs are summarised in table  <dig> and oligonucleotides are listed in table  <dig>  pjv <dig> was used to express the recombination proteins  <cit> . pyub <dig> was used for the preparation of the target substrate to create the groel1Δc strain  <cit> . pgh <dig>  harbouring a δγ resolvase, was used to generate an unmarked deletion  <cit> . using the primer pairs msmeg1583-f <dig>  & msmeg1583-r <dig> and msmeg1583-f <dig> & msmeg1583-r <dig> , two  <dig> bp fragments, homologous to the fragments +1067/+ <dig> and +1621/+ <dig> relative to the translational start of msmeg <dig>  were amplified and subsequently ligated aflii-xbai  and hindiii-spei  into pyub <dig>  creating pen <dig> 

restriction sites are presented in bold face. cttaag = ecori, tctaga = xbai, ccatgg = ncoi, tcatga = bsphi

aagctt = hindiii, actagt = spei.

for the expression of m. tuberculosis proteins in m. smegmatis, the pmynt expression vector was used . pmynt/acps, pmynt/acca <dig> and pmynt/accd <dig> were made as follows: pcr was performed with primer pair rv2523-f & rv2523-r for acps, acca3-f & acca3-r for acca <dig> and accd5e5-f & accd5e5-r for accd <dig> and the resulting fragments were digested with ncoi-hindiii and inserted into ncoi-hindiii digested pmynt.

creation of the groel1Δc mutant
the groel1Δc mutant was created using the mycobacterial recombineering method  <cit> . pen <dig> was digested with aflii and spei to create the linear target substrate, which was introduced into mc <dig> electrocompetent cells, expressing the recombinase genes on pjv <dig> and in this way creating hygromycin-resistant transformants. the hygromycin-resistance cassette was removed using δγ resolvase, expressed on pgh <dig>  generating an unmarked deletion  <cit> .

southern blot analysis
genomic dna  was isolated as described  <cit> , digested with the appropriate enzymes, separated on a  <dig> % agarose gel and transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane . for dna probe labelling, hybridisation and detection, the dig high prime dna labelling and detection starter kit  <dig>  was used.

growth curves
bacterial growth was followed by measuring the optical densities at a wavelength of  <dig> nm as a function of time. cultures were prepared with 7h <dig> expression medium  glucose as carbon source) in identical triplicates for each strain. duplicate samples were taken every  <dig> hours for  <dig> hours. when the optical density at  <dig> nm exceeded  <dig> , samples were diluted in order to remain within the linear range of the detector.

protein expression and purification
all methods related to protein expression in m. smegmatis were carried out as described  <cit> . protein-protein complexes from operon-encoded proteins were expressed using the native operon structure  <cit> . in brief, pellets from  <dig> ml cultures were dissolved in  <dig> ml lysis buffer containing  <dig> mm tris-hcl ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm nacl,  <dig>  m urea with protease inhibitor cocktail  and  <dig> mg/ml dnase i . resuspended cells were sonicated four times, each for  <dig> min  at  <dig> min intervals to prevent overheating, using a bandelin vw <dig> probe at 45% amplitude. the supernatant was collected after centrifugation  for  <dig> h at 4°c, filtered through a  <dig>  μm filter and loaded onto a nickel affinity sepharose  column. after washing with  <dig> column volumes of  <dig> mm tris-hcl ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm nacl and  <dig> mm imidazole, proteins were eluted in  <dig> mm tris-hcl, 100- <dig> mm nacl and 250- <dig> mm imidazole and subjected to size exclusion chromatography using either a superdex  <dig>  column  or, for large protein complexes, a superose  <dig>   with  <dig> mm tris-hcl ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm nacl and  <dig> mm dtt as buffer. the collected protein samples were analysed by sds-page and concentrated accordingly.

circular dichroism  spectrum analysis
cd measurements were performed on a jasco j- <dig> spectropolarimeter. prior to measurement, samples were dialysed into  <dig> mm potassium phosphate,  <dig> mm nacl, ph  <dig> . spectra were recorded between  <dig> and  <dig> nm in a  <dig> mm cuvette with machine settings as follows:  <dig> nm bandwidth,  <dig> sec response,  <dig> nm data pitch,  <dig> nm/min scan speed, cell length of  <dig>  cm. each curve presented is the average of three separate measurements.

coupled enzyme assay
enzymatic activity of the accd5-acca <dig> complex was estimated by a coupled enzyme assay that follows the rate of atp hydrolysis spectrophotometrically  <cit> . the production of adp during the reaction was coupled to pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, and the oxidation of nadh was probed at  <dig> nm. the assay mixture contained  <dig> units of pyruvate kinase,  <dig> units of lactate dehydrogenase,  <dig> mm nahco <dig>   <dig> mm atp,  <dig>  mm phosphoenol pyruvate,  <dig>  mm nadh,  <dig>  mg/ml bsa,  <dig> mm k2hpo <dig> ph  <dig>  and  <dig> mm mgcl <dig> and varying concentrations of propionyl-coenzyme a. reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme to the assay mixture and were maintained at 30°c. data were acquired using a tecan infinite m <dig> microplate reader. the kinetic parameters km and vmax were determined by fitting the mean velocities versus the substrate concentration to the michaelis-menten equation of enzyme kinetics using nonlinear regression analysis, executed by the program prism  <dig> .

RESULTS
creation of the groel1Δc strain
currently, the role of groel <dig> in protein folding is uncertain. a closer look at the structure of e. coli groel  <cit>  indicates that, although the c-terminal region of the protein is not easily accessible, pointing towards the central cavity of the wheel-like structure adopted by oligomeric groel, the extreme c-terminal  <dig> amino acids are absent from the model. similarly, the groel structure of paracoccus denitrificans also lacks these residues  <cit> . these observations suggest that the c-terminal region of groel is highly flexible and could reach out of the central cavity, allowing in this way m. smegmatis groel <dig> to bind nickel affinity beads. additionally, as native groel <dig> from m. tuberculosis is oligomeric  <cit> , nickel binding would require only one accessible histidine-rich region. therefore, we decided to change only the last eleven amino acids of the protein, rather than to make a full knock out strain, in order to minimise changes to the expression strain. a precise chromosomal deletion of fragment 1588- <dig>  relative to the translational start of groel <dig> , was created using the mycobacterial recombineering technique  <cit>  . southern hybridisation  was used to verify that correct homologous recombination had taken place in the hygromycin-resistant and the unmarked deletion strain . the latter strain, in which the hygromycin resistance cassette has been removed, has the c-terminal eleven residues of groel <dig>  containing seven histidines, replaced by six non-histidine residues, which are part of the "scar" sequence left behind after removal of the resistance cassette . the stop codon of this recombinant version of groel <dig> is taa, which although rare, is recognised in high g+c mycobacteria  <cit> . this unmarked deletion strain, referred to as m. smegmatis groel1Δc, is used in all further experiments.

ojha et al. reported that the last  <dig> amino acids of groel <dig> are essential for the formation of mature biofilms  <cit> . therefore, to test the functionality of the groel1Δc protein, we compared biofilm formation in both the wild type and groel1Δc strains. both strains were able to form mature biofilms after an incubation time of  <dig> days at 30°c, indicating that groel1Δc is indeed fully functional . taking into account the data from ojha et al., our results could suggest that either the amino acids important for biofilm formation are upstream of those removed in the groel1Δc protein, or that removal of the last  <dig> residues may affect the folding of at least a part of groel <dig>  additionally, as this newly created strain was constructed for the overexpression of mycobacterial proteins, its growth in 7h <dig> expression medium was compared to the original expression strain m. smegmatis mc <dig> . we observed no significant differences in growth between the two strains, with both reaching an od <dig> of between  <dig> - <dig>  after approximately  <dig> hours, at which time expression is usually induced.

groel1Δc is absent during nickel affinity purification of proteins expressed in m. smegmatis groel1Δc
to demonstrate the absence of groel1Δc as a contaminant when using the m. smegmatis groel1Δc expression strain, we determined the expression and purification efficiency of our strain in comparison to the wild type strain using five different constructs, representing a variety of different protein molecules, including the mycobacterial proteasome, the cfp10-esat <dig> complex, the accd5-acca <dig> dodecameric acyl-coa carboxylase complex and the holo-acyl-carrier protein synthase . additionally, we also used the empty pmynt vector, to check for groel <dig> binding in the absence of a his-tagged protein. all constructs were transformed into both m. smegmatis mc <dig> and groel1Δc and the resulting transformants were cultured in 7h <dig> expression medium and induced by the addition of acetamide to a final concentration of  <dig> mm. eighteen hours after induction, the cells were collected by centrifugation, lysed and the soluble protein fraction was passed over a nickel affinity column, with the elution fraction being analysed by sds-page . while groel <dig> was visible in samples purified from m. smegmatis mc <dig> , the protein was noticeably absent in five out of six protein samples isolated from the groel1Δc strain . due to the fact that accd <dig> has a similar size to groel <dig>  we were unable to determine its presence or absence in samples of the purified acyl-coa carboxylase complex by sds-page. therefore, samples isolated from gel  were analyzed by mass spectrometry . while numerous peptides from both groel <dig> and accd <dig> could be identified from gel slices deriving from the mc <dig> strain, only accd <dig> peptides could be detected in the sample obtained from the groel1Δc strain . likewise, maldi-tof mass spectrometry was performed on the other protein samples, verifying the absence of groel <dig> peptides in the protein samples derived from m. smegmatis groel1Δc .

proteins purified from m. smegmatis groel1Δc behave identically to those purified from the wild type strain
m. smegmatis encodes three forms of the hsp <dig> chaperone groel: msmeg <dig> , msmeg <dig>  and msmeg <dig>  however, the precise molecular function of each protein remains unclear. changing the last  <dig> amino acids of groel <dig> does not alter growth but does result in a strong defect in biofilm formation  <cit> . to confirm that the newly created recombinant version of groel <dig> has no effect on the correct folding and, ultimately, the function of the proteins expressed in m. smegmatis groel1Δc, a number of different proteins and protein complexes have been expressed and analysed.

in the previous section, we have shown that it is possible to express and purify potentially challenging protein complexes, such as the proteasome complex prca-b and the cfp10-esat <dig> complex, from the recombinant groel1Δc strain. these data imply that the proteins isolated from the groel1Δc strain are correctly folded, since we were able to observe all components after purification. in both examples, complex formation requires direct protein-protein interactions between subunits of the complex as only one subunit is his-tagged.

taking our analysis one step further, we directly tested the structural and functional properties of proteins isolated from the groel1Δc strain. we used the five expression constructs described above and transformed them into both m. smegmatis mc <dig> and groel1Δc. proteins were expressed and purified using a nickel affinity column as described above. accd <dig> and acca <dig> protein samples were mixed in a 1: <dig> stoichiometry to form the high-molecular-weight accd5-acca <dig> complex. size exclusion chromatography was performed on all samples as a final purification step.

circular dichroism  spectroscopy is a powerful tool used to visualise the secondary structure properties of protein samples. we observed that the four protein samples isolated from groel1Δc gave virtually identical cd spectra to those purified from the wild type strain , implying that they are correctly folded. furthermore, the cd spectra of the cfp10-esat <dig> complexes, showing a protein with high helical content, are comparable to those collected previously  <cit>  and are in line with the x-ray structure, which consists of a four-helical bundle complex   <cit> .

additionally, we have demonstrated carboxylase activity of the acyl-coa carboxylase accd5-acca <dig> complex, isolated from groel1Δc, using an enzyme-coupled reaction . using propionyl-coa as a substrate, accd5-acca <dig> showed carboxylase activity with a km =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm and a vmax =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm min- <dig> mg- <dig>  data which are similar to the parameters determined using the accd5-acca <dig> complex isolated from e. coli  <cit> , indicating that the accd5-acca <dig> complex isolated from groel1Δc is a functional carboxylase. carboxylase activity requires the α-subunit of the carboxylase to be post-translationally biotinylated  <cit> , implying that the subunits of this large megasynthase are folded correctly and, in the case of the α-subunit, correctly post-translationally modified, when isolated from groel1Δc.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed an m. smegmatis expression strain that allows efficient expression and purification of mycobacterial proteins, multi-subunit protein complexes and post-translationally modified proteins while concomitantly removing the troublesome contaminant groel <dig> and consequently increasing the speed and efficiency of protein purification. the m. smegmatis groel1Δc strain is particularly suitable for laboratories performing in vitro activity assays and structural studies on mycobacterial proteins and protein complexes.
