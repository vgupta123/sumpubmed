BACKGROUND
the giant panda , as one of most widely recognized conservation icons in the world, was once distributed over southern and eastern china and extended to northern burma and northern vietnam. unfortunately, habitat loss and fragmentation, low genetic diversity and small population size all lead to current endangered status of this rare species. the estimated  <dig> giant pandas survive only in a fraction of their historical range, six completely isolated mountain ranges  <cit> . in order to protect this rare species, considerable efforts were made in different research fields. however, the panda genome still remains unknown. one goal of this study is to construct a bacterial artificial chromosome  library for the giant panda in order to provide a new tool for panda genome physical mapping.

genes of major histocompatibility complex  form one of the most important genetic systems for infectious disease resistance in vertebrates  <cit> . mhc-encoded genes have been demonstrated to be associated with susceptibility to numerous infectious  <cit> , take part in mate choice of vertebrates  <cit>  and control the compatibility between mother and fetus during pregnancy  <cit> , making the mhc a research field of considerable biological interest.

the giant panda mhc remains relatively little known. furthermore, the limited references were published by our research group:  the giant panda mhc was located on chromosome 9q by fluorescence in situ hybridization  <cit> ;  the levels of genetic variation for the mhc class ii drb and dqa loci in the giant panda were low, only  <dig> drb alleles and  <dig> dqa ones survived in current populations  <cit> . on the other hand, it has been reported that the giant pandas are particularly susceptible to infectious disease and parasites, such as 100% for ascariasis and 20% for ticks, resulting in a  <dig> % mortality rate from ascariasis  <cit> . as a result, exploring genetic characteristics of multiple mhc loci in the giant panda has become more and more essential. however, the number of mhc genes in the giant panda keeps unknown all the time.

based on an increasing number of published data from human, horton et al. divided the human mhc into five physically adjacent subregions: extended class i , classical class i , class iii , classical class ii , and extended class ii   <cit> . the hla class ii cluster comprises the classical class ii genes  and the non-classcial class ii gene   <cit> . based on multiple suits of mhc data from different mammals, scientists have found that the mammalian mhc classical class ii subregion generally contains dr, dq, dp, dm and do genes and the organization of the classical class ii  is relatively conserved  <cit> . additionally, some genes within extended class ii subregion, such as col11a <dig> and daxx, are strongly conserved in vertebrates from bony fish to human in the evolutionary spectrum  <cit> . due to complete lack of genomic and mapping resources, the mhc studies for the giant pandas become more tedious and difficult. as a result, another goal of this study is to construct a contig spanning the whole classical class ii and part of the extended class ii regions  based on the giant panda bac library.

RESULTS
we successfully constructed a deep coverage, large-insert and publicly available hind iii bac library for a female giant panda. the giant panda bac library consisted of  <dig>  clones arrayed in  <dig>  96-well plates. to estimate the average insert size of the library,  <dig> clones were selected randomly and tested by pulse field gel electrophoresis  . the insert size was calculated using the totallab 1d gel analysis program. the results showed that the average insert size was  <dig> kb. about of  <dig> % non-insert clones were observed in the  <dig> clones tested . according to the published data on haploid c values  of the carnivora  <cit> , assumed a similar genome size with the size of family ursidae, the giant panda bac library constructed here had  <dig> -fold genome equivalents. theoretically, the probability of any giant panda gene being found in this library should be about 99%.

in order to enable a rapid and efficient screening of the giant panda bac library by pcr,  <dig>  clones were divided into  <dig> superpools, each consisting of  <dig> clones . in the following steps,  <dig> plates involved in a superpool were arrayed in a  <dig> Ã—  <dig> matrix and 4d-pcrs were performed  <cit> . a total of  <dig> giant panda gene loci were utilized in 4d-pcr for coverage testing . two or more positive clones  were found for these  <dig> loci, with an average of  <dig>  positive clones per locus . the pcr screening results were thus in agreement with an expected  <dig> -fold genomic coverage of the library.

*to avoid false-positive results, individual positive clones were verified by the second round pcr. all the pcr products of positive clones were sequenced three times.

compared the giant panda bac library with other mammalian bac libraries  <cit> , the average insert size of the panda bac library was relatively small. in this study, we separated the partial digestion hmw dna with two size-fractionated methods as described by osoegawa et al.  <cit>  and further removed the trapped small fragment by concentration with modification procedures. in general, difficulties in cloning are encountered when attempting to increase the size of the cloned fragments. removing small restriction fragments is vital for constructing a high-quality bac genomic library. although the small fragments could be eliminated more efficiently by pfge, small dna fragments are subject to remaining trapped in or co-migrated with the desirable-size fragments  <cit> . hence, the primary reasons of large dna molecules unable to be cloned into bac vectors are probably due to damage to larger dna molecules during the process of preparation and purification and subsequent preferential cloning of smaller dna molecules  <cit> .

in order to construct a bac clone-based contig map of giant panda mhc class ii region between btnl <dig> and daxx loci, we designed ten sets of mhc primers based on homologous class ii mhc genes  <cit>  and partial mhc sequences of giant pandas , which were from btnl <dig>  dra, drb, dqa, dob, lmp <dig>  dmb, dma, col11a <dig>  and daxx genes, respectively. all the positive bac clones were end-sequenced for designing primers but some ones failed to implement library screening. two bac clones  were subject to shotgun sequencing to recruit new end sequences. all the sequences were analyzed first using repeatmasker  <cit>  in order to avoid that repetitive elements were designed as primers, which is of great importance for subsequent library screening. similarly, only gene-specific primerpairs could be employed to verify overlapping between bac clones. in the present study, the ten suits of gene-located primers were all from unique regions as shown in mammals such as btnl <dig>  dob, lmp <dig>  dmb, dma, col11a <dig> and daxx, or from single loci as validated by population investigation like dra , drb  <cit>  and dqa  <cit> . therefore, these specific primers will help to assemble the bac contig map of mhc class ii region without confusing.

using above-mentioned locus-specific primers , we screened the giant panda bac library and obtained a number of pcr positive bac clones. the subsequent sequencing results showed that the amplified sequences from genes btnl <dig>  dob, lmp <dig>  dmb, dma, col11a <dig>  daxx and dra were identical, suggestive of homozygotes at these loci. differently, the primerpairs of drb and dqa both obtained two different sequences, indicative of heterozygotes at these two loci. despite the library coverage testing revealed that the numbers of positive drb and dqa clones were  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively , the number of drb or dqa alleles was only two for these positive bacs, consistent with the characteristics of one locus as described previously  <cit> . furthermore, the two drb alleles and the two dqa ones in this study were not new but repeated previous alleles reported by wan et al.  <cit>  and by zhu et al.  <cit> , demonstrating that both drb and dra primerpairs were able to exclusively amplify one locus. however, caution is required when asserting that the giant panda possesses only one drb or only one dqa. in our pre-experiments we employed other two sets of exon 3-located drb and dqa primers  and both obtained about  <dig> positive bac clones, presenting three and four different sequences for the drb and dqa primers, respectively. the results of pre-experiments indicated that the giant panda probably had not less than one drb or one dqa locus. considering the requirement of correct contig assembly and inter-loci confusion of the exon 3-located primers, we finally abandoned these two suits of exon 3-located primers and adopted the two exon 2-located primerpairs, which had been proven to be one-locus-amplified in our colleagues' studies  <cit> .

based on the screening results of locus-specific primers, we obtained multiple bac clusters of genes. each bac clone was subject to end-sequencing and primer design in order to analyze bac overlapping and achieve a minimum tiling path of the panda mhc class ii region. as for the bacs were connected simultaneously to the flanking bac clones, the minimal overlapping was acquired by comparing dna fingerprinting patterns. according to the results of amplification of end-specific primers , subsequent sequencing and dna fingerprinting, we finally achieved the minimum tiling path of the panda mhc class ii region, which was composed of  <dig> bac clones  and whose  <dig> clone members were all fingerprinted again for ultimate comparison . the minimal tiling path was depicted in a contig spanning about  <dig> kb , which shows all identified clones with minimized inter-clone overlapping for the giant panda mhc class ii region. although it seems that no obvious overlapping is present among the clones 692b <dig>  1561b <dig>  1262b <dig> and 186a <dig> in figure  <dig>  their clone connections based on bac end primers were clearly reflected on figure  <dig> 

comparisons of the mhc class ii region of human hla with dog dla and cat fla showed that the region from btnl <dig> to daxx was relatively conserved  <cit> , having a similar organization: btnl <dig> ~ dr ~ dq ~ dob ~ dm ~ doa ~ dp ~ col11a <dig> ~ daxx. nonetheless, both dla and fla lost some genes and shrank the dp genes into small pseudogenes  <cit> , resulting in the regions between btnl <dig> and daxx of dla and fla were shortened from  <dig> kb of hla to  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb , respectively. the giant panda mhc class ii region presented not only arrangement characteristic of mammalian mhc class ii loci; containing btnl <dig>  dr, dq, do, dm, col11a <dig>  and daxx , but also shortening feature of carnivore mhc class ii; being approximately  <dig> kb long. worthy of pointing out, we designed multiple sets of primers for both dpa and dpb based on the homologous counterparts of human, dog and cat but all failed to amplify the dp genes , suggesting that the giant panda probably possesses highly variable dp genes  or completely lacks dp region. for example, cattle, goat and sheep possess ruminant-specific dy  instead of dp   <cit> . as a consequence, the structure, organization, amount, and exact order of giant panda mhc class ii genes will be unavailable until the contig is sequenced finally.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study reported the construction and characterization of a  <dig> -fold giant panda genomic bac library with an average insert size of  <dig> kb. the library has been demonstrated to be of good quality by the isolation of multiple bac clones containing  <dig> known genes. the giant panda bac library thus provides a useful platform for physical mapping, genome sequencing or complex analysis of targeted genomic regions. the giant panda mhc class ii region was relatively conserved with the counterparts of human, dog, cat and other mammalian mhc class ii region. the  <dig> kb sequence-ready bac contig map of the giant panda mhc class ii region from btnl <dig> to daxx offers a powerful tool for further studies on the giant panda mhc class ii genes. consequently, we hope that the research works reported here could accelerate different aspects of giant panda studies in order to protect this rare species more effectively.
