BACKGROUND
leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by a group of digenetic protozoan belonging to the genus leishmania. it is transmitted by the bite of an infected female phlebotomine sand fly belonging to the genus lutzomyia in the new world and phlebotomus in the old world  <cit> . leishmaniasis is endemic in  <dig> countries and causes more than  <dig>  million cases per year with more than  <dig> million people at risk  <cit> .

leishmaniasis presents a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations that ranges from cutaneous leishmaniasis  that affects tissues near the sand fly bite to mucosal leishmaniasis  that is characterized by a progressive ulceration at the nares and nasal septum to the lethal visceral leishmaniasis  that disseminates to visceral organs causing hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and even death  <cit> .

the l.  braziliensis complex is one of the most important leishmania group in the new world  <cit> . it comprises two closely related species  peruviana and l.  braziliensis)  <cit> , although there is some controversy regarding their status as distinct species  <cit> . as currently defined, l. peruviana is an endemic species in peru with a limited distribution range within the andean and inter-andean valleys with some narrow areas of sympatry with l.  braziliensis  <cit> .

l.  peruviana causes cl and has been isolated from peridomestic mammals including dogs, mice and opossums, revealing its zoonotic status  <cit> . l.  braziliensis is widely distributed in south america, although primarily in the amazon basin, and is referred as an anthropozoonosis  <cit> . l.  braziliensis infections have a substantially higher potential to manifest as ml than any other new world leishmaniasis species, including l.  peruviana  <cit> . however, the parasite genetic factors that contribute to the differences in the pathogenesis of these two species are not well known.

next generation sequencing has provided several advantages for characterizing species-specific traits across the genomes of several organisms. in leishmania it has allowed to rapidly and comprehensively analyze a wide range of mutation types, including gene copy number variations  and aneuploidy  <cit> . recently, cnv and expansions in tandem gene arrays have been proposed as a mechanism to increase gene expression with numerous species-specific gene amplifications  <cit> . these studies have suggested that extensive variation among duplicated tandem gene arrays plays a role in higher expression of their products and a diversification process in amplified genes  <cit> . moreover, analysis of the chromosomal content from different cells within the same isolate have led to conclude that leishmania presents a mosaic structure that may contribute to gene expression changes in response to environmental alteration modulating parasite phenotypes  <cit> .

in this study, we have conducted a comparative genomics analysis of two l.  peruviana isolates against the reference genome m <dig> of l.  braziliensis. comparative assessments have shown important differences in chromosome and gene copy number between both species. these analyses may serve to improve our understanding of parasite variation between these two closely related species that could be linked to their different disease phenotypes and to provide further insights into their status as distinct species.

RESULTS
genome assembly
we used a combined de novo and reference based assembly approach  to generate a draft genome for each strain. l.  peruviana mapped reads showed an overall  <dig>  % mapping rate for pab- <dig> and  <dig>  % for lem <dig> against l.  braziliensis. median genome coverage estimated from mapped reads into  <dig>  single copy genes was of  <dig>  and  <dig>  for pab- <dig> and lem <dig>  respectively.

the l.  peruviana assemblies resulted in  <dig>  and  <dig>  megabases that were generated from  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs in pab- <dig> and lem <dig>  respectively. the resulting ordered assemblies consisted of  <dig> pseudo-chromosomes, due to the split of chromosome  <dig> in the l.  braziliensis m <dig> reference genome  and a pseudo-chromosome containing unordered scaffolds .

the overall identity between l.  braziliensis and l.  peruviana calculated with mummer  <cit>  confirmed the close relationship between l.  braziliensis and l.  peruviana , and a closer relationship between the two l.  peruviana isolates .

snp and indel comparisons
variants were identified following filtering for quality, read depth and haplotype score as described in the methods.

comparisons identified  <dig>  and  <dig>  variants between l.  braziliensis and l.  peruviana pab- <dig>  and l.  peruviana lem <dig> , respectively. of these;  <dig>  variants were shared between the two l.  peruviana isolates. in contrast, the two l.  peruviana isolates showed fewer variants among them . this finding is consistent with the high similarity obtained with mummer <dig> between both l.  peruviana isolates and the greater difference with l.  braziliensis.

our results show that there is significant genetic differentiation between l.  braziliensis and l.  peruviana while intra l.  peruviana variation is substantially lower. for comparison, a previous comparative study between l.  infantum and l.  donovani reference genomes found that  <dig>  nucleotide changes differentiate between these closely related species  <cit> , comparable to what we describe here for l.  braziliensis and l.  peruviana.

we then focused on the  <dig>  variants from l.  braziliensis that were shared by the two l.  peruviana lines. of these;  <dig>  snps were located in  <dig>  coding dna sequences  . of these,  <dig>  snps  were synonymous mutations and  <dig>   were non-synonymous mutations. additionally, eight snps mutating the annotated start codon  and  <dig> mutating the annotated stop codon were found . most genes with high counts of snp are hypothetical proteins, kinases and trafficking proteins stressing the need to characterize the function of these variable proteins .table  <dig> top ten high snp count genes in two l.  peruviana isolates

analysis of potential diagnosis targets that could accurately differentiate l.  peruviana from l.  braziliensis resulted in  <dig> genes with high snp density regions between both species . while most of these genes are hypothetical proteins, they could serve to design better molecular diagnosis tools to discriminate between these closely related species.

two l.  braziliensis pseudogenes  appeared to be functional in l.  peruviana. lbrm. <dig>  codes for an x-pro, dipeptidyl-peptidase, serine peptidase and has orthologs in other leishmania species from the old and new world suggesting that it could be functional in l.  peruviana. peptidases have an important role in parasite survival, invasion, metabolism and host-parasite interaction  <cit> , highlighting the importance of confirming coding function of this potential gene. lbrm. <dig>  codes for a putative pteridine transporter and shares 84 % identity with a folate/biopterin in l. infantum. it has been shown that leishmania are pteridine auxotrophs and rely on a network of folate and biopterin transporters. pteridine levels have a strong influence on metacyclogenesis in l.  major  <cit> .

chromosome copy number variation
chromosome numbers were estimated by the average read density to each chromosome, and normalized to an assumed overall genome ploidy of 2n. normalized chromosome copy number clustered around “disomy” although with significant departures from non-integral values evident for some chromosomes . this finding is particularly important since the l.  braziliensis m <dig> strain is mostly trisomic  <cit> .fig.  <dig> chromosome copy number in l. . peruviana. chromosome copy number variation in l.  peruviana. a pab-4377; b lem- <dig>  boxes represent the estimated copy number for each chromosome and standard deviation from the three methods. mean genome ploidy is indicated by a dotted red line



the most pronounced departure from disomy occurred in chromosome  <dig>  which presented a read depth between tetrasomy to hexasomy in pab  <dig> and trisomy in lem <dig> . in both isolates, read depth was evenly distributed along the entire sequence of chr <dig>  arguing against region-specific amplification .fig.  <dig> chromosome  <dig> normalized read depth. normalized read depth for supernumerary chromosome  <dig>  a pab-4377; b lem- <dig>  estimated ploidy indicated by a dotted red line. blue lines represent normalized read depth for each position at the chromosome



in both samples, chromosomes 1– <dig> and  <dig> appear to be closer to monosomy. this characteristic has also been estimated for chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> of l.  mexicana  <cit> . interestingly, the pattern of aneuploidy involving chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in lem <dig> and  <dig> in pab- <dig> is different from the median ploidy of the rest of the chromosomes in both samples. these chromosomes appear to have intermediate read depth between disomic and trisomic profiles, suggesting a mosaic ploidy within the cell population .

it has been suggested that mosaic aneuploidy could be a mechanism of rapid parasite adaptation in response to environmental changes within its host  <cit>  and it has been shown to occur in closely related strains  <cit> . however, its origin in leishmania remains to be investigated  <cit> .

a second approach for assessing chromosome number is based upon allele frequencies. for disomic chromosomes, heterozygous snps should cluster around 50 %, while trisomic chromosomes should show two peaks at  <dig> and 67 % and tetrasomics at  <dig>   <dig> and 75 %,  <cit> .

allele frequency counts for each predicted heterozygous snp further confirmed the overall disomic tendency  and the highly heterogeneous structure within the cell populations with chromosomes presenting mixtures of allele profiles .fig.  <dig> normalized allele frequency distribution. normalized allele frequency counts for l.  peruviana. a pab-4377; b lem- <dig>  blue dots show normalized counts at heterozygous positions for all disomic chromosomes. mean count at each allele frequency is indicated by a red line. cumulative percentage between  <dig>  and  <dig> heterozygous frequencies support disomic tendency of most chromosomes



chromosomes with discordance between read depth analysis and their allele frequencies included chromosome  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> that presented a tetrasomic or a mixture of trisomic and disomic patterns in pab- <dig> .

in lem <dig>  chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> did not have a marked allele frequency pattern and chromosome  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> presented discordance between read depth and allele frequencies . additionally, chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> presented mixtures of disomy and monosomy that corresponded with their estimated read depth .

discordance between allele frequency and read depth may be explained by cells presenting a high variation in their ploidies due to chromosome mosaism as has been previously suggested  <cit> .

interestingly, chromosome  <dig> that has been identified as supernumerary in both isolates appears to have disomic pattern . this chromosome has been previously described as supernumerary in all leishmania species  <cit> . it may be possible that this chromosome accumulates mutations in disomic alleles as has been reported in other chromosomes with the same pattern in l.  mexicana  <cit> .

ontology analysis in the supernumerary chromosome  <dig> showed that this chromosome is enriched in genes involved in iron metabolism and other related molecular functions . iron sulfur proteins  are crucial for life since they mediate oxidation-reduction reactions during mitochondrial electron transport and are involved in the synthesis of amino acids, biotin and lipoic  <cit> .table  <dig> ontology analysis for chromosome 31



biosynthesis of fe-s proteins is highly dependent on iron regulation in the cell  <cit> . interestingly, ferrous iron transporters located in chromosome  <dig> have been described in leishmania and they appear to be important for growth, replication and pathology, further stressing this connection  <cit> .

a sustained copy number increase in chromosome  <dig> among all leishmania species  <cit>  could serve as a mechanism to facilitate iron uptake and increase gene dosage of fe-s proteins in an oxidative stressed environment.

gene copy number variation
expanded tandem gene arrays and dispersed genes appear to be a major source of inter and intra-species variation in leishmania  <cit> . the tandem duplicated gene arrays analysis showed a total of  <dig> and  <dig> expanded arrays in pab- <dig>  and lem <dig> , respectively, relative to the l.  braziliensis reference genome .fig.  <dig> gene copy number variations in l.  peruviana. mapping of expanded genes in both l.  peruviana isolates. a, b tandem duplicated gene arrays in pab- <dig> and lem- <dig>  respectively. outer circle shows gene arrays as red with numbers indicating the calculated array expansion. disomic chromosomes are shown in blue and supernumerary chromosomes in orange with outer numbers describing each chromosome. colored lines map the location of duplicated arrays in their respective chromosomes. c, d dispersed duplicated genes in pab- <dig> and lem- <dig>  respectively. histogram and numbers represents the total number of gene expansions in each chromosome



in both samples,  <dig> tandem arrays were shared showing that gene array expansions may vary across strains from the same species . the most expanded gene arrays in both isolates belonged to a group of tate dna transposons , nadh-dependent reductases , heat shock protein  <dig>  and hypothetical proteins among others .

the same analysis in l.  braziliensis m <dig> resulted in  <dig> tandem gene arrays from which only three arrays were shared with l.  peruviana . interestingly, amastin surface protein arrays that are present in l.  braziliensis seems to be not expanded in l.  peruviana.

amastins have been shown to be highly expressed in the amastigote life stage and appear to mediate host-parasite interactions allowing infection and survival  <cit> . while the effect of this variation remains to be confirmed, these differences may be related with different host interactions in both species.

we found  <dig> and  <dig> dispersed duplicated genes in pab- <dig> and lem <dig> with  <dig> expansions in common . most expanded genes include thioredoxins, nadh-dependent fumarate reductases and several hypothetical proteins.

we did not detect an increase in copy number in gp <dig> genes in l.  peruviana as has been previously shown in l.  braziliensis  <cit>  reinforcing a previous finding of gp <dig> copy number differences between these species  <cit> .

the zinc-metalloprotease gp <dig> stands out as a major virulence factor in leishmania presenting different roles in the vector and mammal host that aim to protect parasites from host immune responses and promote infection  <cit> . therefore, deletion of some gp <dig> genes in l.  peruviana could affect parasite-host interactions and influence its distribution and clinical manifestation with lack of mucosal development.

the marked intra-species difference in dispersed duplicated genes shows that extensive variation in gene copy number can occur between isolates belonging to the same species and supports the hypothesis that chromosome and gene cnv act as a mechanism of rapid parasite adaptation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
extensive chromosomal and gene copy number variations have been described in leishmania and were proposed as a mechanism of rapid parasite adaptation to different environments and pressures in the host. our study shows that there are major differences regarding gene copy number variations and aneuploidy even between closely related leishmania species.

although highly similar to l.  braziliensis, l.  peruviana presents a different set of expanded gene arrays that can result in different expression profiles between both species. moreover, high snp and indel counts as well as extensive variation in chromosome and gene copy numbers between l.  peruviana and l.  braziliensis support maintaining the classification of both organisms as closely related but distinct species.

further analysis including a greater number of l.  peruviana and l.  braziliensis isolates and the use of transcriptomic data are needed to assess if these differences are conserved across isolates of l.  peruviana and reveal how tandem gene arrays and cnv affect genome expression.
