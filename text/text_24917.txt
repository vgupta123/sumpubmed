BACKGROUND
ripening processes of many kinds of fruit involve various biochemical and physiological changes, such as softening, enrichment of pigments, organic acids and nutrients , and development of aroma and flavor. these changes make fruits attractive for the human diet. for climacteric fruits, autocatalytic ethylene production and an increase in respiration occur during ripening, and ethylene has been well characterized as necessary for the coordination and completion of ripening  <cit> . at the onset of ripening, expression patterns of numerous genes involved in these ripening-associated phenomena are upregulated in a highly synchronized fashion, indicating that ripening is controlled by a highly systematic and sophisticated transcriptional mechanism. therefore, much attention has been paid to how fruit ripening is regulated because ripening regulation is not only of agricultural importance but also of scientific interest in terms of the regulation of biological developmental processes. however, a substantial portion of the genetic regulatory mechanism controlling the process remains unclear.

the tomato  is the most advantageous model plant for the study of fruit ripening due to its climacteric ripening nature, availability of the genome information and many suggestive mutations concerned in ripening  <cit> . among the ripening mutations, ripening inhibitor  is a well-characterized mutation that inhibits such characteristic phenomena observed during ripening as lycopene accumulation and softening, resulting in non-ripe fruit  <cit> . the rin mutation also inhibits autocatalytic ethylene production during ripening; thus, the wild-type gene on the rin locus has been regarded as a regulator responsible for the onset of ripening by acting upstream of both ethylene- and non-ethylene-mediated ripening control. the rin locus has been isolated and found to encode two mads-box transcription factors, rin and mc , and rin is apparently responsible for the regulation of fruit ripening  <cit> . molecular characterizations have revealed that rin is expressed during ripening specifically, that the gene product exhibits transactivation activity and that rin has the ability to bind to the specific dna sequences known as c--rich-g  box, which is a typical binding sequence for mads-box proteins  <cit> .

to identify genes associated with ripening phenomena, the genes whose expressions are affected by the rin mutation have been extensively investigated. in ethylene biosynthesis and signaling, the transcription levels of the genes encoding 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid  synthase  <dig> , acc synthase  <dig> , acc oxidase  <dig>  and ethylene receptor protein  <dig>  increase dramatically during ripening, but their transcriptions are inhibited by the rin mutation, indicating that these genes are responsible for the elevation of ethylene level and for ethylene signaling during ripening  <cit> . the rin mutation also inhibits upregulation of the genes involved in cell-wall modifications, such as polygalacturonase , β-galactosidase  <dig> , endo--β-mannanase  <dig>  and α-expansin  <dig> , all of which are assumed to be concerned with softening and the shelf life of fruit  <cit> . ripening-associated upregulation of the gene for phytoene synthase  <dig> , which is a rate-limiting enzyme for carotenoid production including lycopene in ripening tomatoes, and the gene for β-fructofuranosidase , which catalyzes hydrolysis of sucrose in ripening fruit, is also affected by the rin mutation  <cit> . in addition, a dna microarray assay revealed that a large number of genes upregulated during ripening were suppressed by the rin mutation  <cit> . these results apparently indicate that the rin protein is a transcriptional regulator triggering the onset of ripening by inducing the expression of these ripening-associated genes. three pathways for the transcriptional regulation of ripening-associated genes by rin are possible. the first pathway is that rin binds to the promoter of target genes and directly regulates their expression. the second is that rin induces ethylene production at the onset of ripening and ethylene-induced genes are consequently transcribed. the third is that rin induces some transcription factors directly, and subsequently the transcription factors induce the ripening-specific gene expressions. it is expected that these three pathways act in parallel and regulate the expression of the large number of ripening-associated genes, although the elements of these transcriptional cascades remain largely unknown except that rin binds to the promoter of leacs <dig>  <cit> .

to learn more about these pathways, we have developed chip-based analyses for fruit ripening. chip, a technique to collect target dna sequences of a protein of interest as protein-dna complexes  with an antibody for the protein, is a powerful tool used to ascertain interactions of transcription factors with dna in vivo  <cit> . comprehensive chip-based approaches have been used for identifying potential target genes of a few floral homeotic mads-box transcription factors in plants  <cit>  but have not been applied for analysis of fruit ripening to date. here, we report identification of the in vivo rin-binding sites in the putative promoters of several ripening-induced genes through chip-based analyses using ripening tomato fruit. in addition, we screened novel rin-binding sites containing carg boxes and found a candidate gene possibly regulated by rin. the results offer insights into the characteristics of rin in the transcriptional regulation at the onset of ethylene production and cell-wall modifications, and in the autoregulation of rin itself during ripening.

RESULTS
in silico search of carg boxes in the promoters of ripening-induced genes
the rin mutant lacks expression of leacs <dig>  leacs <dig>  tbg <dig>  leexp <dig>  leman <dig> and psy <dig>  and shows decreased expression levels of leaco <dig>  etr <dig>  pg and inv, while these genes are highly upregulated in the wild-type fruit  <cit> , indicating that all of these genes are regulated directly or indirectly by rin. to detect potential rin-binding sequences, a possible carg-box motif   <cit>  was searched against the promoters of these genes . the motif includes three groups of carg-box sequences: srf-like   <cit> , mef2-like   <cit> , and intermediate   <cit> . a motif search revealed that all the genes except leacs <dig> and leexp <dig> have at least one typical carg-box sequence in their promoters . instead, the promoter of leexp <dig> was found to contain no typical rin target motif, but rather two atypical carg-box sequences, catttatatg and caatttaaag . the promoter of leacs <dig> was also found to carry no typical but three atypical sequences of caaatataag, caattttaag and ctagttaaag . we also further analyzed these atypical carg-box sequences in the leexp <dig> and leacs <dig> promoters as well as analyzing the possible carg boxes.

binding of rin to the carg boxes in the ripening-induced gene promoters in vivo and in vitro
to distinguish the genes directly regulated by rin, we applied the chip assay. chromatin was prepared from ripening tomato fruits harvested at the pink coloring stage and was then immunoprecipitated with the anti-rin antibody. the resulting immunoprecipitated dnas  were assayed by quantitative-pcr analyses  for the regions containing the putative rin-binding sites described above, and then enrichment levels of the regions were evaluated. the qchip-pcrs were carried out with a few considerations as follows:  when two or more carg-box sequences were closely located , they were treated as one site and tested together with a pair of primers designed to include them both ;  in the case of pg, the two closest sites to the protein-coding region were tested ;  the five carg-box sites found between the closest and the farthest sites in the promoter region  of leaco <dig> were excluded from the test because they were considered to be similar to an ltr-type retrotransposon   <cit>  whose replicates are dispersed throughout the genome, preventing site-specific amplification, and because the farthest site  from the protein-coding region of leaco <dig> could not be examined by primer pairs of reasonable length.

the result of qchip-pcr revealed significant enrichment of all the carg boxes in the iped dna pools relative to the total chromatin dna pools   except inv  and exp1-a . in particular, acs2-a, acs2-b, acs4-b, acs4-c, tbg4-b, exp1-b, man <dig>  rin-a and rin-b were extremely enriched to  <dig> -,  <dig> -,  <dig> -,  <dig> -,  <dig> -,  <dig> -,  <dig> -,  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, respectively . furthermore, acs4-a, pg-b and tbg4-a were moderately enriched to  <dig> -,  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, respectively . these enrichments were not observed in the immunoprecipitated dna prepared with the pre-immune serum  , indicating specific binding of rin to these  <dig> carg boxes in vivo. other carg boxes  showed relatively lower enrichment .

to identify the rin-binding sequences within the enriched regions, the binding of rin to the carg-box sequences in the promoters of leacs <dig>  leacs <dig>  tbg <dig>  leexp <dig>  leman <dig> and rin were examined by in vitro gel retardation assay. results showed that dna fragments containing the carg boxes were retarded in all the sites for these genes due to binding to the rin protein , although the signal intensity for atypical carg-box sequences that include the three leacs <dig> sites and exp1-b appeared to be lower than that of the typical sequences, based on the ratio to the free dna . in contrast, by introducing mutations within the target sequences, the retardation was drastically inhibited in all target sequences except for acs4-c . these results indicate that rin specifically recognizes the carg-box sequences of the respective sites. in acs4-c, the dna fragment containing the mutated carg box was retarded similarly to the normal sequence , which is likely due to the unexpected generation of a sequence similar to the carg box via base substitution . this result indicates that rin could bind to a wide spectrum of carg-box sequences although in vitro rin shows lower preference for the atypical motifs than for the typical carg boxes.

genome mapping of dna fragments recovered by chip and in silico detection of carg-box sequences
to identify novel binding sites of rin, we cloned the dna fragments recovered by chip using the anti-rin antibody. of the iped dna clones,  <dig> were sequenced and mapped on independent genomic regions of the tomato . the average length of the  <dig> cloned fragments was  <dig> bp . to detect potential rin-binding sequences, a possible carg-box motif   <cit>  was subsequently searched against the genomic regions. the search detected a total of  <dig> possible carg boxes from  <dig> regions . these boxes could be further categorized into four groups . because none of these regions has yet been reported to be bound by rin, we considered them as novel potential rin-binding sites and subjected them to further analyses.

binding of rin to the novel carg-box sites in vivo and in vitro
to examine the binding of rin to the carg-box sites within the cloned fragments, we monitored their enrichment levels in the iped dna pools by qchip-pcr. results showed that the dna fragments of four sites, 009f,  <dig>  073f and 133r, were significantly enriched to  <dig> -,  <dig> -,  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold in the iped dna pools, respectively, compared with those in the input chromatin dna. such significant enrichment was not observed in the pi-treated dna , indicating that enrichment depends on the presence of the anti-rin antibody, i.e., these sites are specifically bound by rin in vivo. compared with these four sites, the other eight sites examined here showed relatively lower enrichment .

the binding of rin to the four sites was also examined by in vitro gel retardation assay. results showed that the mobility of dna fragments containing the normal carg-box sequences was delayed in all the sites by binding to the rin protein . this retardation was not detected at any site when mutation-introduced target sequences were used , indicating that rin binds specifically to these carg boxes.

genes in the flanking regions of the rin-binding carg boxes and their expression
to detect potential target genes of rin, we analyzed the 5-kb genomic regions flanking the four carg boxes. a blast search of each flanking region of 073f and 133r using the sgn unigene set identified two potential genes corresponding to tomato ests, sgn-u <dig> and sgn-u <dig> for the former region, and sgn-u <dig> and sgn-u <dig> for the latter region . gene predictions revealed that the carg-box of 073f was located at the promoter region of the gene for sgn-u <dig> , while the carg-box of 133r overlapped both the 5'-untranslated region  and the protein-coding sequence for sgn-u <dig> . by contrast, no est was detected in the flanking 5-kb regions of 009f and  <dig> 

if these four genes are under the transcriptional regulation of rin, their expression pattern should be associated with that of rin. to examine this, we analyzed their expression in normal and rin mutant tomato fruits together with the expression of the rin gene. similar to previously reported observations  <cit> , the rin mrna level was extensively increased in normal fruit at the ripening stages  compared with the pre-ripening stage , but not in the rin mutant at the corresponding stages . among the genes found around the rin-binding sites, sgn-u <dig> showed an increased mrna level with ripening in normal fruit, but no such increase was observed in the mutant fruit. this expression pattern seemed to coincide with that of rin although sgn-u <dig> was expressed also in the g stage to some extent and its level was relatively lower  than that of rin at the ripening stages . unexpectedly, however, other genes examined did not exhibit the expression pattern associated with rin .

discussion
selectivity of target sequences of rin for tomato genome
based on our analyses to identify direct target genes of rin, we successfully identified a number of sites to which rin binds in the genome of ripening fruit cells by screening the promoters of the genes that are highly upregulated during ripening and also within the dna fragments prepared by the chip with the anti-rin antibody. results for the rin target sites provide insight into how rin selects target genes within the tomato genome.

our previous in vitro assays demonstrated that rin can bind to sequences of c6g, and that the preferential binding sequence is 'ccaatag'  <cit> . here, we demonstrated that a number of the ripening-associated genes contain these typical binding sites in their promoters and that rin actually binds to these sites. in contrast, however, the promoter of leacs <dig> contains no typical rin-binding sequences but does contain three atypical carg-box sequences, caaatataag , caattttaag  and ctagttaaag  . similarly, the promoter of leexp <dig> also contains one atypical carg-box sequence, caatttaaag. chip assays demonstrated that these four atypical sites were enriched within the iped dna at a high level comparable to the sites within the promoters of leacs <dig> and leman <dig> that contain the typical binding sequences. this result indicates that in vivo rin binds to a wider spectrum of carg-box sequences within the genome than previously expected based on in vitro assay.

this ability of rin to bind with a wide range of carg-box sequences in vivo suggests that other factors might be necessary for rin to target only the ripening stage-specific genes. the binding site selectivity of rin might be affected by chromatin structure  that controls the interaction of rin with target dnas in living cells. as another possibility, the selectivity of rin might be increased by a tetramer- or higher-order multimer formation with other mads-box proteins. for instance, in the 'quartet model' of floral organ specification, mads-box proteins in floral organs form four combinations of tetramers that determine the identity of the different floral organs  <cit> . in this model, two dimers comprising the tetramer should recognize two different carg-box sites, which confer higher selectivity of binding sites on transcription factor complexes  <cit> . in fact, egea-cortines et al. have proved that tetramer formation of mads-box proteins dramatically increases the dna-binding affinity  <cit> . in this study, we found that the cis-elements of leacs <dig>  leacs <dig>  tbg <dig> and rin contain two carg-box sites enriched at a significant level by chip using the anti-rin antibody. these results suggest that rin functions as a component of a tetramer that interacts with two binding sites of the target sites, just like the 'quartet model' transcription factor complexes. rin possesses the ability to form a homodimer or heterodimers with other tomato mads-box proteins belonging to the apetala1/fruitfull subfamily  and ag subfamily   <cit> . because rin belongs to the sepallata  family among plant mads-box group proteins  <cit> , rin might mediate interactions between other mads-box proteins, similar to sep proteins, which have been shown to mediate interactions between floral homeotic mads-box proteins  <cit> .

in this study, we identified novel rin-binding sites from a screening of iped dna. at the regions flanking those sites, however, we found only one gene that is upregulated during ripening. although we cannot exclude the possibility that the rins binding to the other sites might regulate the genes located far from the sites , the bindings are likely not to activate any transcriptions. similar observations were previously reported in the investigation of transcription factors of sep <dig> through chip with solexa sequencing , which showed that several percent of thousands of peaks are located far from protein-coding gene loci  <cit> . these facts mean that rin-binding sites might not be restricted only to the promoter region of the rin-inducible genes, but might include other genomic regions with carg box-like sequences. if so, the binding of rin at the cis-elements is necessary but not sufficient to induce the gene expressions required for fruit ripening, and certain factors are necessary for the specific transcriptional regulation by rin. an assay using a yeast system revealed that rin activates the transcriptional activity of an rna polymerase that binds to the flanking genomic region  <cit> , suggesting that the transactivation activity of rin requires other transcriptional machinery at the rin-binding sites. higher-order multimer formation and other transcriptional machinery might allow rin to induce specific gene expressions during ripening.

autoregulation of rin and the promising direct target genes of rin
our analysis revealed that rin binds to the carg-box sites in its own promoter in vivo, strongly suggesting that rin autoregulates its own expression. the existence of this autoregulatory mechanism can explain how the rapid increase in the mrna level of rin at the onset of ripening is controlled  <cit>  , i.e., it is expected that autoregulation apparently controls the expression of rin in a positive manner during ripening due to the transcriptional activation activity of rin  <cit> . autoregulation is frequently observed in plant floral homeotic mads-box genes such as deficiens  and globosa , arabidopsis apetala <dig> , pistillata , ag and embryogenetic agl <dig>  <cit> . positive or negative feedback loops in autoregulation maintain their expression in the development of floral organs or embryos after the initial induction. in tomatoes, tomato agamous-like  <dig>  is possibly autoregulated  <cit> . the autoregulation of rin might help to maintain its sufficiently high expression in ripening fruit, and consequently effectively regulate the expressions of direct target genes involved in the ripening process.

we also demonstrated here the direct interaction of rin with the promoters of the genes involved in ethylene synthesis, leacs <dig> and leacs <dig>  in vivo by chip. in the ethylene biosynthetic pathway, the conversion of s-adenosyl-l-methionine  to acc by acc synthase is a known rate-limiting step  <cit> . leacs <dig> and leacs <dig> regulate a massive increase in ethylene production of fruit associated with ripening, which is defined as system  <dig> ethylene production in contrast to system  <dig>  which produces ethylene constitutively at a low level within pre-ripening fruits  <cit> . recently, yokotani et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that ethylene production during ripening  consists of both autocatalytic and ethylene-independent systems and that transition from system  <dig> to system  <dig> occurs mainly via limited expression of leacs <dig> and leacs <dig>  both of which are controlled by ethylene-independent developmental factors. our finding strongly suggests that rin directly regulates leacs <dig> as well as leacs <dig>  and this finding is consistent with those of previous reports  <cit> . meanwhile, direct regulation of leaco <dig> and etr <dig> expression by rin cannot be confirmed at present due to relatively lower enrichment levels of the carg boxes in their promoters in this study. in addition, a hd-zip homeobox protein lehb- <dig> directly regulates the expression of leaco <dig> during fruit ripening  <cit> , suggesting that rin may not be involved in the direct regulation of leaco <dig>  however, we cannot exclude the possibility that rin regulates the expression by binding to carg boxes in the transposable element-like sequence in the leaco <dig> promoter that could not be examined in this study. regardless, our results certainly suggest that rin contributes to the initiation of ethylene production at the onset of ripening through upregulation of leacs <dig> and leacs <dig> 

we also demonstrated here the direct interaction of rin with the promoters of ripening-induced genes, pg, tbg <dig>  leexp <dig> and leman <dig>  in vivo using chip. this finding strongly suggests the direct transcriptional regulation of these genes by rin, similar to its regulation of leacs <dig> and leacs <dig>  previous studies have shown that the expression of pg in tomato fruit is regulated by ethylene and that the promoter contains cis sites highly similar to the ethylene-responsive regions of the e <dig> and e <dig> genes  <cit> . however, oeller et al.  <cit>  previously revealed that pg expression during ripening is induced in an ethylene-independent manner, consistent with our view that rin directly regulates the pg expression. these facts suggest that both pathways  are effective in controlling the pg expression during ripening. furthermore, previous analyses with suppression or overexpression of the four genes revealed that these genes are involved in cell wall modification but not enough to independently soften fruit  <cit> . these facts and our results therefore suggest that rin induces expression of the genes involved in cell wall modification simultaneously during ripening, enabling the gene products to soften fruit in a cooperative manner.

chip revealed novel rin-binding carg-box sites and a possible rin-regulating gene
we successfully identified four novel rin-binding carg-box sites from ripening tomato fruit by chip. this led to the detection of the genes near the carg boxes. among these genes, sgn-u <dig> is possibly regulated by rin during ripening due to the rin-associated expression pattern. this gene encodes a protein similar to trx y <dig>  which serves as an oxidoreductase and is an activator of plastidal peroxiredoxin q   <cit> . prx q plays a role in peroxide detoxification, redox signaling and defense against pathogens  <cit> . when it decomposes peroxides, trx y <dig> is used as an electron donor  <cit> . from these observations, we assume that rin participates in these phenomena in ripening fruit via activation of trx y <dig> expression. however, the involvement of trx y <dig> in the ripening process needs further clarification because no functional evidence of such involvement or of the apparently irregular position of carg-box 133r as a cis-acting element has been reported. more extensive chip-based analysis will lead to comprehensive identification of the target genes of rin and will thus help clarify the transcriptional regulation of gene expression for fruit ripening.

CONCLUSIONS
ripening of climacteric fruits is genetically controlled by intricate transcriptional cascades through ethylene and non-ethylene-mediated regulation. in this study, parts of the cascades involving rin are revealed.

qchip-pcr analysis of ripening tomato fruit and gel retardation assay demonstrated that rin binds to the carg boxes in the promoters of the genes involved in cell-wall modification  and system- <dig> ethylene biosynthesis  in vivo and in vitro. this suggests that rin controls fruit softening and ethylene production by the direct transcriptional regulation of the cell-wall-modifying genes and acs genes, respectively. the control of ethylene production by rin during ripening means that rin is also indirectly responsible for ethylene-inducible ripening processes together with an ethylene-mediated control. in addition, the presence of autoregulation of rin itself is also suggested in this study, and thus explains how a rapid increase in the rin transcription level occurs at the onset of fruit ripening.

sequence analysis of the iped dnas from ripening tomato fruit, qchip-pcr analysis and gel retardation assay revealed four new carg-box sites bound by rin. of these four sites, the site 133r has a gene sgn-u <dig> that encodes trx y <dig> and shows a rin-dependent expression pattern, suggesting that it is possibly regulated by rin.

a series of binding analyses of rin revealed that rin can bind to a wider variety of carg boxes in vivo than the consensus sequence previously determined in vitro. this implies the presence of other factors necessary for rin to target fruit-ripening specific genes.
