BACKGROUND
thymic stromal lymphopoietin  was first identified as a growth factor in the conditioned medium supernatant from the z210r. <dig> thymic stromal cell line to support b cell proliferation in vitro  <cit> . tslp is now known to play a key role in the initiation of asthma  <cit> . tslp shares il-7rα with il- <dig>  tslp signaling is mediated by a heterodimeric receptor complex, which consists of the interleukin- <dig> receptor α chain  and a unique tslp-binding receptor , to transmit proliferative signals in cells  <cit> . il- <dig> binds to a heterodimeric receptor complex, the il-7rα and the cytokine receptor common gamma chain , which is shared by il- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  both tslp and il- <dig> can activate the transcription factor stat <dig>  in the il- <dig> receptor complex, il-7rα binds to jak <dig> and γc binds to jak <dig> upon addition of il- <dig>  however, none of jak kinases have been reported to be phosphorylated by the binding of tslp to its receptor  <cit> . previous studies showed that y <dig> in the il-7rα cytoplasmic domain provides a docking site for pi-3k and stat <dig> and is required for a proliferative signal by il- <dig> signaling  <cit> . further, the tyrosine residues of γc are not required for il-7-mediated cell proliferation  <cit> . isaksen and colleagues observed that the lone tyrosine residue of the mouse tslpr cytoplasmic domain is required for tslp-mediated cell proliferation using chimeric receptors composed of the human gm-csfr α chain extracellular domain fused to the mouse tslpr transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains and the human gm-csfr β chain extracellular domain fused to the mouse il-7rα transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains  <cit> . brown et al. showed that anti-il-7rα antibodies inhibited tslp-mediated proliferation of pre b-leukemia  <cit> , indicating that both il-7rα and tslpr contribute to tslp-dependent cell proliferation.

we aligned the protein sequences of il-7rα and tslpr cytoplasmic domains and observed that y <dig> and y <dig> of human il-7rα and y <dig> of human tslpr were conserved across the species examined while y <dig> of human il-7rα was not conserved. because the role of tyrosine residues in the context of the 'native' form tslp receptor complex in tslp-mediated cell proliferation has not been previously investigated, we took a systematic approach to evaluate the role of cytoplasmic tyrosine residues of tslp receptor complex in mediating tslp-induced cell proliferation. our data show that the cytoplasmic tyrosine residues of either human il-7rα or human tslpr can mediate tslp-induced cell proliferation and that mutation of all the four cytoplasmic tyrosine residues of human il-7rα and human tslpr to phenylalanine residues is required to abolish tslp-dependent cell proliferation.

RESULTS
most, but not all, cytoplasmic tyrosine residues of il-7rα and tslpr are conserved across species
tyrosine residues in cytokine receptor cytoplasmic domains play important roles in mediating cytokine signaling and are mostly conserved across species. we aligned the amino acid sequences of il-7rα and tslpr cytoplasmic domains from various species. figure 1a shows an alignment of the il-7rα cytoplasmic domains. the membrane-proximal domains and c-terminal regions harboring two tyrosine residues are conserved among all il-7rα chains while the regions in between vary to some extent. the il-7rα cytoplasmic domains in mus musculus, rattus norvegicus, and gallus gallus have four tyrosine residues while the il-7rα cytoplasmic domains in homo sapiens, pan troglodytes, macaca mulatta, canis lupus familiaris and bos taurus only harbor three tyrosine residues. as indicated by red arrows in figure 1a, the two tyrosine residues in the c-terminal region of the il-7rα chains are conserved while other tyrosine residues in the variable region are not conserved . figure 1b shows an alignment of the tslpr cytoplasmic domains. as observed in the case of il-7rα, the membrane-proximal domains and c-terminal regions harboring one tyrosine residue are conserved in all tslprs while the intervening regions are variable. tslpr cytoplasmic domains in homo sapiens, mus musculus, rattus norvegicus and canis lupus familiaris have only one tyrosine residue while the tslpr cytoplasmic domain in bos taurus harbors two tyrosine residues. interestingly, the tyrosine residue in the c-terminal region of the tslpr cytoplasmic domains across species is also conserved . because tyrosine residues play an important role in mediating the signaling by cytokine receptors and are conserved in the il-7rα and tslpr cytoplasmic domains, we wanted to examine the role of these tyrosine residues in tslp-dependent cell proliferation.

the lone cytoplasmic tyrosine residue in tslpr is not required for tslp-dependent cell proliferation
cytokines il- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> share the common receptor subunit γc that shows high homology to tslpr. it has been reported earlier that these cytokines do not require the tyrosine residues of the γc cytoplasmic domain to support cell growth  <cit> . in contrast, isaksen and colleagues reported earlier that the single tyrosine residue of the mouse tslpr cytoplasmic domain is critical for tslp-dependent cell proliferation  <cit> . because the study was based on a chimeric receptor system, we sought to study the role of tyrosine residues in tslp signaling in the context of the native tslp receptor complex. tslp requires the heterodimeric tslp receptor complex - il-7rα and tslpr - to transmit signals . reche et al. have shown that coexpressed human tslpr and il-7rα receptor subunits respond to human but not mouse tslp  <cit> . we retested the requirement of the receptor complex for human tslp-mediated signaling in an il- <dig> dependent mouse cell line, ba/f <dig>  which also expresses endogenous murine tslpr. a retroviral system was used to generate ba/f <dig> cells that express wild type htslpr and/or wild type hil-7rα. as shown in figure 2b, only ba/f <dig> cells expressing both hil-7rα and htslpr, but not those expressing hil-7rα or htslpr alone could proliferate in response to human tslp. cell surface expression of human tslpr and human il-7rα was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis using anti-human tslpr and anti-human il-7rα antibodies . these results again confirmed the requirement of hil-7rα and htslpr for human tslp action allowing us to use this system for a systematic analysis of the requirement of tyrosine residues.

human tslpr contains only one cytoplasmic tyrosine residue  very close to the carboxyl terminus . to determine whether this residue is required for tslp-mediated cell proliferation, it was replaced by a phenylalanine residue . a ba/f <dig> cell line expressing both htslpr  and hil7rα  was established using retrovirus-based infection. as shown in figure 2d and 2e, mutation of this tyrosine residue failed to abolish the proliferative response to tslp. on day  <dig> of culture,  <dig> ng/ml tslp induced ~25% more proliferation in ba/f <dig> cells expressing htslpr /hil-7rα  than ba/f <dig> cells expressing htslpr /hil-7rα   . to examine this in greater detail, we carried out a dose response study . we observed that in contrast to what was observed at  <dig> ng/ml, ba/f <dig> cells expressing the htslpr /hil-7rα  pair grew at a slower rate  than ba/f <dig> cells expressing the htslpr /hil-7rα  in response to low doses of tslp . there was no statistical difference between the two at  <dig>  ng/ml and  <dig>  ng/ml. the cell surface expression of human tslpr and human il-7rα was similar across the cell lines as confirmed by facs using anti-human tslpr and anti-human il-7rα antibodies . nevertheless, in contrast to a previous report using a chimeric receptor system  <cit> , our data showed that the lone tyrosine residue in the tslpr cytoplasmic domain is not required for tslp-dependent cell proliferation. our findings suggest that studies about tslp-mediated signaling pathways should be carried out in the context of the native tslp receptor complex. intriguingly, these data suggest that y <dig> in the htslpr cytoplasmic domain may play an inhibitory role in tslp signaling in response to high doses of tslp while playing a positive role at lower doses.

the cytoplasmic tyrosine residues in il-7rα are required for il- <dig> but not tslp-dependent cell proliferation
like tslp, the receptor complexes for il- <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are all heterodimers. previous studies showed that y <dig> of the human il-4r is essential for il- <dig> mediated proliferation  <cit>  and that y <dig> of the human il-7rα is required for il- <dig> induced cell growth  <cit> . it has also been shown that il- <dig> requires y <dig> of the il-9r to transmit proliferative signals and activate stats  <cit>  and that y <dig> of the il-21r is critical for maximal il-21-mediated proliferation  <cit> . the human il-7rα contains three tyrosine residues in its cytoplasmic domain. because the cytoplasmic tyrosine residue of human tslpr is not required for cell proliferation and cytoplasmic tyrosine residues are critical for cytokine receptor signaling, we wanted to determine the requirement of the tyrosine residues in the il-7α cytoplasmic domain for tslp-dependent cell proliferation. we replaced the cytoplasmic tyrosine residues in il-7rα with phenylalanine residues to generate il-7rα mutants. first, we generated three individual mutants of human il-7rα- y401f, y449f and y456f. three ba/f <dig> cell lines expressing the wild type tslpr along with the three mutated il-7rα were established using retrovirus-based infection. interestingly, none of the three mutations in the human il-7rα cytoplasmic domain abolished the proliferative response to tslp administration . the individual mutations, y401f , y449f  and y456f , even led to an enhanced proliferative response at  <dig> ng/ml of tslp. however, at lower doses of tslp, y449f  and y456f , exhibited a diminished response . because the three tyrosine residues in hil-7rα may play redundant roles in supporting cell proliferation, we mutated all of them to phenylalanine residues  and transduced this mutant receptor into ba/f <dig> cells along with wild type human tslpr. strikingly, the mutation of all three cytoplasmic tyrosine residues of the human il-7rα to phenylalanine residues was still unable to abolish the proliferative response to tslp . the cell surface expression of mutant or wild type hil-7rα and htslpr was similar as evidenced by facs .

because the role of tyrosine residues in human il-7rα cytoplasmic domain in proliferation induced by il- <dig>  which requires il-7rα and γc , was established in a chimeric receptor system  <cit> , we revisited this issue in ba/f <dig> cells. ba/f <dig> cells expressing the wild type or mutant human il-7rα  and the wild type human γc were established and evaluated for cell proliferation upon addition of human il- <dig>  in contrast to what we observed with tslp, mutation of the three tyrosine residues in il-7rα completely abolished ba/f <dig> cell proliferation in response to il- <dig> , which is consistent with previous reports  <cit> . cell surface expression of human il-7rα and human γc were similar by facs using anti-human il-7rα and anti-human γc antibodies . taken together, our data show that the cytoplasmic tyrosine residues in il-7rα are required for il- <dig> but not tslp-dependent cell proliferation.

tslp-dependent cell proliferation requires the presence of at least one tyrosine residue
we next wanted to test whether any combination of mutation of tyrosine residues in il-7rα or tslpr could affect tslp-induced cell proliferation. for this, we generated three additional cell lines, htslpr /hil-7rα , htslpr /hil-7rα  and htslpr /hil-7rα . as shown in figure 5a, c and 5e, none of these combinations abolished cell proliferation in response to tslp. as observed previously for individual tyrosine residues in il-7rα, combining them with tslpr tyrosine mutants still led to a diminished response at low doses of tslp  .

to test if any tyrosine residues were required for tslp-induced proliferation, we mutated all tyrosine residues in the tslp receptor complex /il-7rα ). as shown in figure 5g and 5h, this abolished the ability of the human tslp receptor complex to drive cell proliferation. taken together, our data suggest that tslp signaling requires at least one tyrosine residue to support cell growth while all the four tyrosine residues in human tslp receptor complex play various roles in tslp-mediated cell proliferation.

stat <dig> phosphorylation requires at least one cytoplasmic tyrosine residue in the human tslp receptor complex
both human and mouse tslp can induce stat <dig> phosphorylation  <cit> . we examined whether tslp-induced phosphorylation of stat <dig> requires any of the cytoplasmic tyrosine residues of human tslp receptor complex. as shown in figure  <dig>  while tslp induced stat <dig> phosphorylation in cells expressing wild type receptors and those expressing htslpr /hil7rα , no phosphorylation was detectable in cells expressing htslpr /hil7rα . our data suggest that tslp-induced stat <dig> phosphorylation requires at least one cytoplasmic tyrosine residue in the human tslp receptor complex. we also examined jak <dig> phosphorylation in cells expressing wild type and various mutant receptors and failed to detect any tyrosine phosphorylation induced by tslp  in agreement with previous reports  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
here we report that mutation of all four cytoplasmic tyrosine residues in the tslp receptor complex abolishes the proliferative response to tslp as well as stat <dig> phosphorylation. mutation of individual tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of human il-7rα or tslpr was not sufficient to abolish this proliferative response although it did impair the response at low doses of tslp . intriguingly, these mutations led to an increase in the proliferation rate in response to high doses of tslp . further experimentation will be required to elucidate the mechanistic basis of the signals that are mediated by the tslp receptor complex. in this regard, it is interesting to note that the cytosolic tyrosine residues in il-7rα seem to be dispensable for tslp, but not il- <dig>  signaling.
