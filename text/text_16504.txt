BACKGROUND
the human malaria caused by plasmodium falciparum has been one of the major infectious diseases in the world causing illness in  <dig> to  <dig> million people leading to  <dig> to  <dig> million deaths annually  <cit> . in addition, it is putting huge economic burden on affected countries particularly in asian and african subcontinents. in order to develop effective drugs and vaccines against this parasite it is important to identify novel potential drug/vaccine targets. parasite secretes an array of proteins within the host erythrocyte and beyond to facilitate its own survival within the host cell and for immunomodulation. these proteins secreted by parasite can serve as potential drug/vaccine targets. the identification of secretory proteins of plasmodium falciparum has got limited success, since experimental identification of these proteins is rather difficult due to complex nature of parasite.

in silico prediction of secretory proteins is need of time in the era of genomics where thousands of genomes have been completely sequenced including those of p. falciparum   <cit> . it has been shown in past that secretory proteins of eukaryotes have signal sequence at n-terminus, which can be used to predict its secretory nature. one of the commonly used programs for predicting secretory proteins of eukaryotes is targetp  <cit> . though targetp is successful for eukaryotic protein but fails to predict known p. falicparum secretory proteins like pfemp <dig>  the reason of failure of targetp for p. falciparum is due to its complex life-cycle that alternate between vertebrate and invertebrate. thus it is not possible to use subcellular localization methods developed either for eukaryotes  <cit>  or prokaryote  <cit>  for localization of p. falciparum proteins. there is a need to develop organism specific methods  <cit> . recently, two groups independently identified the signal  or motif  in secretory proteins of p. falciparum partly responsible for proteins export from parasite to erythrocyte  <cit> . however, a number of well known and experimentally documented secretory/erythrocyte membrane associated proteins lack these motifs, thus emphasizing the existence of multiple pathways that operate in parallel  <cit> . with the completion of plasmodium genome sequence, the challenge is to combine experimental and bioinformatics tools in order to develop algorithm with high predictive value for secretory proteins of malaria parasite.

in general, two important reasons for failure of these motif based methods are; i) all secretory proteins do not necessarily have signal peptide particularly those secreted by non-classical pathways and ii) location of signal is not conserved in protein, since it may be found on either n-terminal or c-terminal or in middle of proteins  <cit> . in order to overcome these limitations several groups have developed methods based on amino acid composition or dipeptide composition of proteins  <cit> . recently two web servers  have been developed, which provides key steps important for predicting secretory proteins  <cit> . though composition based methods have been developed for eukaryotic or prokrayotic proteins but till date no method has been developed for p. falciparum specific proteins. it has been demonstrated in past that organism specific methods perform better than general methods  <cit> . thus there is need to develop method especially for predicting secretory proteins of p. falciparum.

in this paper, we describe a method developed for predicting secretory proteins of malaria parasite. first, amino acid sequence of a protein has been converted into fixed length patterns by computing various type of composition like amino acid, dipeptides. then machine-learning technique support vector machine  has been used to discriminate secretory and non-secretory protein. for the first time in this study, evolutionary information has been used for predicting secretory proteins. the evolutionary information in form of pssm profile was obtained from psi-blast search against "nr" databases. a web server has also been developed for predicting secretory proteins of malaria parasite.

RESULTS
analysis of amino acid composition
we analyzed the amino acid composition of both secretory and non-secretory proteins. as shown in figure  <dig>  the frequency of occurrence of amino acid alanine, cysteine, isoleucine, lysine, glutamine and threonine are higher in secretory proteins than non-secretory proteins, while composition of aspartic acid, phenylalanine, glycine are higher in non-secretory proteins than secretory proteins. there is a major difference of composition of asparagines in non-secretory protein  than secretory protein. this means secretory proteins can be discriminated from non-secretory proteins based on their amino acid composition. it has been shown in previous studies that secretory proteins have signal sequence at n-termini). thus it is important to compare composition of various parts of secretory and non-secretory proteins separately. as shown in figure  <dig>  n-terminal composition of two type of protein is quite different; magnitude of biasness is much higher than compositional biasness of whole protein. similarly, composition of c-termini of secretory and non-secretory proteins is quite different . in comparison to it, difference in composition of central region of secretory and non secretory proteins was low .

composition based svm models
it was observed that amino acid composition of secretory proteins was somewhat different from that of non-secretory proteins. thus a svm based classifier was developed using amino acid composition where amino acid composition was used as input vector of dimension  <dig>  different kernels and parameters of svm were tried. the performance of our method on different thresholds is shown in table  <dig>  we got accuracy of around 84% with mcc  <dig>  with nearly equal sensitivity and specificity. this model correctly predicts 76% secretory proteins at 96% specificity using rbf kernel. it has been observed that localization methods based on dipeptide composition perform better than amino acid composition based methods  <cit> . this is because dipeptides also provides information about local order of residues in addition to amino acid composition. for present study we developed svm based method using dipeptide composition where dipeptide composition was used as input vector or dimension  <dig>  as shown in table  <dig>  we obtained maximum accuracy of  <dig> % with mcc  <dig>  using dipeptides based svm model. the svm model based on dipeptides composition performed better than svm model based on amino acid composition.

split amino acid composition
it has been observed that secretory proteins have signals either at n or c terminus. in order to utilize the compositional biasness in terminus of secretory and non-secretory proteins, we developed svm models using split amino acid and dipeptides composition. as shown in table  <dig>  we got maximum accuracy  <dig> % and  <dig> % using split amino acid and dipeptides composition respectively. this is slightly better than accuracy achieved using whole composition. we found best performance with  <dig> n-terminal,  <dig> c-terminal and remaining protein.

pssm based svm models
in past, multiple sequence alignment information in form of position specific scoring matrix  has been used for developing methods  <cit> . in this study, pssm has been used for predicting secretory proteins. first we created pssm profile for each protein using psi-blast search against nr database with three iterations, at cut-off  <dig> . secondly, we computed a vector of dimension of  <dig> from pssm matrix. finally a svm model was developed using pssm and we achieved maximum accuracy of  <dig> % with mcc  <dig> . in addition this model was able to correctly predict 73% secretory proteins at specificity 100%. this clearly demonstrates that pssm provide more information than single sequence and is useful for predicting secretory proteins.

pseudo amino acid composition 
in past pseaac has been widely used for classifying the proteins and subcellular localization methods. thus we also tried to develop svm models using simple pseaac. in this study we have computed pseudo amino acid composition using pseaac  <cit> . we found that the performance of pseaac based model is better than model based on amino acids or dipeptides composition. however, performance is poor than our pssm based model . we tried two characters hydrophobicity and pi and performance of which was nearly same.

benchmarking
in order to compare performance of our method with existing methods, we predicted proteins used in this study using existing methods. firstly, we applied plasmoht that is based on motif and specially developed for predicting secretory proteins in plasmodium  <cit> . in order to use plasmoht one need to provide plasmodb id, as all proteins in our dataset are not from plasmodb database so it could not be applied on all the proteins  <cit> . this method correctly predicted  <dig> out of  <dig> secretory proteins . plasmoht fails to predict  <dig> secretory proteins since all secretory proteins do not have conserved signal motif. it also correctly predicted  <dig> out of  <dig> non-secretory proteins obtained from plasmodb. it was not possible to apply plasmoht directly on  <dig> non-secretory proteins obtained from swiss-prot as plasmoht need plasmodb id. thus, we manually examined the swiss-prot entries and found  <dig> entries have orfname  in field gene name. six swiss-prot entries out of  <dig> have two or more than two orf names . we examined  <dig> proteins for which single plasmodb id was available and found that two proteins had plasmoht motif. it means plasmoht correctly predicted  <dig> out of  <dig> non-secretory proteins. in total plasmoht correctly predicted  <dig> out  <dig> non-secretory proteins. we were not able to locate plasmodb id for all proteins extracted from swiss-prot, which may be due to number of reasons i.e. modified form of protein; mutated proteins or protein fragments. secondly we applied commonly used method for predicting secretory proteins targetp on our dataset, it correctly predicted  <dig> out of  <dig> secretory proteins   <cit> . it also correctly predicted  <dig> out of  <dig> non-secretory proteins. in summary, we achieved sensitivity  <dig> %, specificity  <dig> % and accuracy  <dig> % using targetp on our dataset. thirdly, we evaluated performance of two commonly used subcellular localization methods pa-sub and wolf psort on our dataset  <cit> . pa-sub first extract the features of similar sequences to query sequence from swiss-prot then it uses machine learning model for predicting subcellular location of query protein  <cit> . wolf psort converts protein amino acid sequences into numerical localization features; based on sorting signals, amino acid composition and functional motifs such as dna-binding motifs. after conversion, a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier is used for prediction  <cit> . performance of both methods is shown in table  <dig>  both methods fail to predict secretory proteins of p. falciparum.

discussion
plasmodium falciparum during its asexual stage within the host erythrocyte remodels the host cell displaying several dramatic changes, which affects membrane rigidity surface antigenicity and permeability. these changes aid in the pathogenesis and also help the parasite survival within null host cell by nutrient acquisition  <cit> . it has been estimated that an array of parasite derived antigens are expressed on infected cell membrane  <cit> . however, only a few protein such as pfemp- <dig>  rifin and stevor family proteins have been conclusively proven to be on the surface of infected erythrocyte membrane. the search of parasite derived proteins within the host cell and infected membrane surface remains one of the most warranted areas in malaria research for understanding the pathogenesis of disease, and to find out potent vaccine candidate molecule. recently, two independent groups  <cit>  have done in silico prediction of proteins exported into the host erythrocyte  based on the plasmodium export element   <cit>  and the vacuolar transport signal   <cit>  motifs. these motifs were identified by bioinformatic analysis of aligned n-terminal sequences from proteins known to be exported from the parasitophorous vacuole  into the erythrocyte. whereas hiller et al.  <cit>  used reiterative alignments to search for motif while marti et al. <cit>  used a search protocol based on the presence of signal sequence  on exon i. both reported motifs contains a short stretch of alternating charged and hydrophobic amino acids separated by uncharged amino acids located a short distance downstream of the ss. functional role of pexel/vts motif has been demonstrated by gfp fusion with ss followed by live fluorescence imaging and mutational analysis of pexell/vts motif. however, pexel/vts dependent protein trafficking cannot be typified due to over and possible incorrect timed expression of chimeric gfp fusion protein  <cit> . moreover resa-gfp chimera containing pexel/vts was reported to be mistargeted to lumen of parasitovorous vacuole  <cit> . besides well known exported proteins the predicted protein also includes several proteins for which export into the erythrocyte had not previously been shown, including several heat-shock proteins, kinases, phosphatases and putative transporters  <cit> . but one of the major limitation of the prediction based on pexel/vts motif is that it could not predict proteins lacking pexel/vts motif but experimentally demonstrated to be exported into the erythrocyte, such as p. falciparum skeleton-binding protein , membrane-associated histidine-rich protein  and coat protein ii, all of which seem to be associated with vesicles and/or maurer's clefts  <cit> . moreover, the above-mentioned motif based methods gets setback in case of members of the vir supergene family , proteins predicted to be expressed on the erythrocyte surface  <cit>  since none of these have ss or pexel/vts motifs. unlike many parasite-encoded proteins exported into the erythrocyte, pfemp <dig> lacks an ss. although both groups were able to identify a conserved sequence with biophysical characteristics similar to those of the more classical pexel/vts, by creating mini-pfemp <dig> reporter constructs consisting of their respective pfemp <dig> pexel/vts motif, gfp or yfp and the conserved c terminus of pfemp <dig> . but the location of pexel/vts in pfemp <dig> is contradicting. marti et al.  <cit>  described the motif to be located ~16– <dig> amino acids in from the n terminus, whereas hiller et al.  <cit>  reported the motif to be ~ <dig> amino acids further downstream, within a semi-conserved duffy-binding-like  domain. this discrepancy in the location of pexel/vts motifs points to an ambiguity for the existence of identical and universal motif for exported proteins predicted to be exported into erythrocyte. although florens et al.  <cit>  have predicted about  <dig> hypothetical proteins of the parasite to be located on infected erythrocyte surface using multidimensional protein technology , but their groups have not proposed any universal method for prediction. nevertheless, the literature strongly advocates the existence of multiple pathways that are cumulatively responsible for the export of parasite proteins in erythrocytes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the bioinformatics approach used in this study is standard approach, which is commonly used for predicting subcellular localization of proteins. in addition evolutionary information in form of pssm has been used first time for predicting secretory proteins in malaria parasite. our model is equally applicable to wide range of secretory proteins where most of method fails. one of the major advantage of method describes in this study is that it is based on complete sequence rather than on small region/motif. the server developed for predicting secretory proteins will be very useful for researchers working in the field of malaria.
