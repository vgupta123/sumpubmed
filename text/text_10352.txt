BACKGROUND
transcriptional regulation is a fundamental mechanism by which all cellular systems mediate the activation or repression of genes, thereby setting up striking patterns of gene expression across diverse cellular conditions - e.g. across cell-cycle phases  <cit> , normal vs cancer states  <cit>  or stress conditions  <cit> . such regulation of gene expression is executed by the concerted action of transcription factors  that bind to specific regulatory dna sequences associated with target genes  <cit> . deciphering the roles of tfs is a significant challenge and has been the focus of numerous studies, with great interest being recently shown in cancer  <cit> . for example, bar-joseph et al.  <cit>  identified periodically expressed cell-cycle genes in human foreskin fibroblasts to understand their differential regulation between normal and cancer conditions. nebert  <cit>  surveyed tf activities in cancer, emphasizing the roles of tfs as proto-oncogenes  that serve as accelerators to activate the cell cycle, and as tumour suppressors  that serve as brakes to slow the growth of cancer cells. darnell  <cit>  classified tfs having cancerous or oncogenic potential into three main kinds - steroid receptors , resident nuclear proteins activated by serine kinase cascades , and latent cytoplasmic factors normally activated by receptor-ligand interaction at the cell surface . darnell  <cit>  also discussed the signalling pathways of these tfs  as potential drug targets in cancer. karamouzis and papavassiliou  <cit>  discussed rewiring of transcriptional regulatory networks in breast tumours focusing on subnetworks of estrogen receptor  and epidermal growth factor receptor  family members.

most studies focus on transcriptional regulation of individual target genes. however, diseases such as cancer are a result of the combined effect of multiple genes. gene products such as proteins seldom act in isolation, but instead physically interact to constitute complexes that perform specialized functions  <cit> . studying protein complexes therefore provides an aggregative or "systems level" view of gene function and regulation than studying individual proteins . here we integrate large-scale protein-interaction  and gene-expression datasets to examine the differential regulation of complexes across cancer conditions.

an initial analysis
we compiled a list of protein complexes by clustering a network of human ppis. co-functional  proteins are encoded by genes showing high mrna co-expression  <cit> . therefore, we quantified the "functional activity" for each of these complexes by aggregating pairwise co-expression values between their constituent proteins. analysis for two pancreatic-tissue conditions viz normal and ductal adenocarcinoma  tumour revealed significant changes in co-expression for these complexes between the two conditions. for example , chuk-erc1-ikbkb-ikbkg showed a change in co-expression, interestingly coinciding with changes in its transcriptional regulation by the nfκb-family of tfs. this complex constitutes the serine/threonine kinase family, while the tfs play essential roles in nfκb signalling pathway   <cit> , which are implicated in pdac  <cit> .

based on these observations, here we seek to understand differential co-expression of complexes and its relationship with differential regulation by tfs between cancer conditions. therefore we:

• devise a computational model to identify complexes showing significant differential co-expression and the tfs regulating these complexes; and

• apply the model on two case studies - normal vs pdac tumour and brca <dig> vs brca <dig> familial breast tumour conditions - to decipher their roles in these tumours.

in summary  we compute co-expression values for each of the complexes under different cancer conditions. we then introduce a log-linear model to relate changes in co-expression of complexes to changes in their regulation by tfs between these conditions. we apply the model to identify influential tfs and complexes and validate their roles in cancer.

RESULTS
experimental datasets
ppi data: we gathered homo sapiens ppis identified from multiple low- and high-throughput experiments deposited in biogrid   <cit>  and hprd   <cit> . to minimize false positives in these ppi datasets, we employed as scoring scheme iterative-cd  <cit>   to assign a reliability score  to every interaction, and then discarded all low-scoring interactions  to build a dense high-quality ppi network of  <dig> interactions among  <dig> proteins .

gene expression data: we have performed one of the largest gene expression profiling analyses of familial breast tumours  and stratified them based on brca mutation status as brca1-, brca2- and non- brca1/ <dig> tumours  <cit> . among these, brca <dig> and brca <dig> tumours are phenotypically most different  <cit>  and we consider these two for our analysis here; our dataset contains  <dig> brca <dig> and  <dig> brca <dig> expression samples . in addition, we also gathered expression samples from pancreatic tumours - normal and pdac matched  - from the badea et al. study  <cit>  .

sporadic breast tumours constitute 93-95% of all breast tumours and most studies classify these into the four molecular subtypes, luminal-a, luminal-b, basal-like and her2-enriched  <cit> . broadly, basal-like tumours do not express the er, pr and her <dig> receptors, and exhibit high aggressiveness and poor survival attributed to distant metastasis, compared to luminal tumours. however, much less is known about familial tumours , although studies  <cit>  have noted that brca <dig> tumours are predominantly basal-like while brca <dig> tumours are more hetergeneous and may be her2-enriched or luminal-like.

pancreatic tumours, on the other hand, are more uniform with pdac accounting for most  pancreatic tumours and is predominantly characterized by dysfunctioning  of the kras oncogene and of the cdkn2a, smad <dig> and tp <dig> tumour-suppressor genes  <cit> .

transcription factors: we gathered  <dig> tfs from vaquerizas et al.  <cit> , manually curated from a combined assessment of dna-binding capabilities, evolutionary conservation and integration of multiple sources. benchmark complexes: for independent validation, we used manually curated human complexes from corum  <cit> , a total of  <dig> complexes of which we used  <dig> having size at least  <dig> 

benchmark genes and tfs in cancer: for validation we used known  genes  from cosmic  <cit>  and known tfs  in cancer from  <cit> .

analysis of ppi networks highlights considerable rewiring between tumour conditions
by integrating ppi and gene expression datasets  we obtained two pairs of conditional ppi networks - normal-pdac for pancreatic and brca1-brca <dig> for breast tumours. figure  <dig> shows the co-expression-wise distribution for protein pairs in these networks. normal vs pdac displayed striking differences in these distributions , reflecting considerable rewiring of ppis. pdac showed significant loss in co-expression for both positively co-expressed as well as negatively co-expressed interactions compared to normal, indicative of both disruption as well as emergence of interactions in the tumour. such rewiring has also been noted in earlier studies  <cit> .

strikingly enough brca <dig> vs brca <dig> tumours also showed significant differences in ppi distributions  , reflecting considerable differences in ppi wiring between the two breast tumours. brca <dig> tumours displayed higher co-expression compared to brca <dig> tumours, ∼ <dig> ppis with higher correlations.

david-based  <cit>  functional analysis of these rewired interactions  showed significant  enrichment for the biological process  terms - cell cycle, chromatin organisation, dna repair and rna splicing, indicating considerable rewiring in core cellular processes responsible for genome stability. among these were interactions involving the tumour suppressors tp <dig> and smad <dig> in pdac, which are known genes mutated in the tumour, and the dna double-strand break  repair proteins bre and brcc <dig> along with brca <dig>  brca <dig> and tp <dig>  in breast tumours.

analysis of complexes highlights disruption to core cellular mechanisms in tumours
matching of complexes using tj =  <dig>  and δ =  <dig>   resulted in a total of  <dig> and  <dig> matched complexes  for normal-pdac and brca1-brca <dig> conditions, respectively . the co-expressionwise distributions  revealed significant differences for both normal vs pdac as well as brca <dig> vs brca <dig> conditions , indicating that rewiring in ppi networks had considerable impact on these complexes. overall, we noticed considerable drop in co-expression for pdac vis-a-vis normal, whereas brca <dig> tumours showed higher co-expression vis-a-vis brca <dig> tumours . these differences were larger towards the higher co-expression ranges which correspond better to active complexes , indicating that cellular functions were considerably impacted in these tumours. these observations were reproducible using an independent set of complexes from corum  and were significantly  greater than expected by random .

we next divided the set of matched complexes  m into two subsets:

• m′ - those with higher co-expression in normal vis-a-vis pdac, or higher co-expression in brca <dig> tumours vis-a-vis brca <dig> tumours; and

• m″ - those with lower co-expression in normal vis-a-vis pdac, or lower co-expression in brca <dig> tumours vis-a-vis brca <dig> tumours.

• Δc represents the  change in co-expression of complexes between conditions, that is, increase or decrease in co-expression of complexes from normal to pdac or brca <dig> to brca <dig> tumours.

• m′ - complexes with co-expression for normal >pdac tumour or brca <dig> >brca <dig> tumour. m″- complexes with co-expression for pdac tumour >normal or brca <dig> >brca <dig> tumour.

in the classical work on "hallmarks of cancer", hanahan and weinberg  <cit>  describe seven to ten key distinguishing hallmarks of tumour cells, among which are limitless replicative potential and self-sufficiency in growth signals. cellular mechanisms including cell cycle and ddr are considerably weakened in tumour cells, but these cells survive on last-standing mechanisms  to continue proliferation. this is due to the activation of compensatory or back-up mechanisms. although these compensatory mechanisms cannot completely substitute for the weakened or disrupted ones, these are sufficient to enhance the survival of tumour cells  <cit> . our analysis reflect such compensatory trends - a fraction of complexes showed increase in co-expression, but the increase was not as steep as the decrease for the remaining faction. however, a straightforward gene ontology analysis is too general to delineate the roles of the two factions because both originate from the same or similar processes. we therefore investigated a few specific cases .

examples of compensatory mechanisms and validation for roles in cancer
normal vs pdac tumour : dsb-repair functionality is severely impacted in pdac  <cit> , with inactivating mutations in rad <dig> and nbs <dig> attributed to loss of dsb-repair functionality increasing the risk of pancreatic cancer  <cit> . dsbs are detected by the mre11-rad50-nbs <dig>  and ku70/ku <dig>  complexes in the hr and non-homologous end-joining  pathways, respectively. in hr, the repair process involves recruitment of the brca1-a complex  to sites of dsbs. we observed a decrease in co-expression for all the three complexes, indicating considerable weakening of the dsb machinery. on the other hand, we noticed an increase in co-expression for the single-strand break  and mismatch  repair complexes xrcc1-polb-pnkp-lig <dig> and msh6-mlh1-mlh2-psm2-pcna, respectively. the xrcc <dig> complex is responsible for ssb repair through sister chromatid exchange following dna damage by ionizing radiation, while the msh <dig> complex is involved in the recognition and repair of mispairs. together these observations suggest the activation of ssb and mmr machinery compensating for the loss in dsb-repair machinery; such a functional relationship has been observed previously between dsb and ssb repair pathways  <cit> .

the nfκb signalling pathway has been strongly implicated in kras signalling and pancreatic tumorigenesis  <cit> . consistent with this, we noticed considerable changes in co-expression for several nfκb complexes including the nfκb1/rel family, which plays important roles in programmed cell death and proliferation control and is critical in tumour initiation and progression  <cit> . the calcium-binding proteins s100a <dig>  s100a <dig> and s100a <dig> are known to modulate p <dig> activity  <cit>  and their over-expression has been associated with metastatic phenotype of pancreatic cancer  <cit> . the inactivation of the ras-associated rassf1a and rassf <dig> complexes, which act as tumour suppressors  <cit> , is frequent in pancreatic cancer  <cit> . the complex ddx20-gemin4-ppp4c-ppp4r <dig> associated with the smn , and snap23-stx4-vamp3-vamp <dig> associated with vesicular transport, docking and/or fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane   <cit> , support tumorigenic invasion of neural cells in pancreatic cancer  <cit> .

brca <dig> vs brca <dig> tumours : we observed a lower co-expression for the mmr complex mlh1-msh6-msh2-pms2-pcna in brca <dig> tumours compared to brca <dig> tumours; we think this is due to the parallel roles of brca <dig>  brca <dig> has a key role in dsb repair, and brca1-deficient cells have defects in the two dsb repair pathways hr and nhej  <cit> . brca <dig> associates with pcna and the mismatch repair proteins msh <dig>  msh <dig> and mlh <dig> to form the basc complex, a genome-surveillance complex required to sense and repair dna damages  <cit> , thereby also playing a role in the mmr pathway. on the other hand, brca <dig> has been associated with functions only in hr  <cit> . therefore, we suspect that although mmr pathway is compensatorily activated in response to dsb-repair deficiency, brca <dig> tumours exhibit a weaker mmr pathway compared to brca <dig> tumours because of the direct involvement of brca <dig> in the mmr pathway.

the dss <dig> complex consisting of brca <dig>  dss <dig> and the integrator subunits mediates the 3'-end processing of small nuclear rnas  <cit> , and brca <dig> deficiency could result in a reduced stability of this complex. the expression of replication factor c complex  is indicative of proliferative potential  of brca <dig> tumours. we noticed over-expression of this complex in brca <dig> compared to brca <dig> tumours.

finally, a considerable number of cancer genes from cosmic classic were represented in complexes showing changes Δc ≥  <dig>  , suggesting that differential co-expression of complexes is a strong indicator of tumorigenic processes.

relating changes in co-expression complexes to their transcriptional regulation
we computed pearson and spearman rank coefficients between changes in co-expression of complexes and their transcriptional regulation as follows. for each complex-pair {ss, tt} ∈ m, we measured its change in correlation Δc, and the total change in its regulation by tfs ff, ∑Δr= ∑f=1kΔr,ff) . this resulted in  <dig> complex-tf pairs in pancreatic and  <dig> in breast with non-zero Δc and Δr. note that we lose at most 13% of complexes  as a result of our requirement that tfs interact with at least one complexed protein . we observed positive pearson and spearman coefficients which were supported by corum complexes . the spearman coefficients were higher than pearson in both cases, indicating a non-linear relationship; this supports our use of a log-linear model .

all coefficient values are positive, and spearman coefficients were higher than pearson, indicating a non-linear relationship between Δc and ΣΔr.

analysing influential tfs in pancreatic and breast tumours

tfs are ranked based on their overall influence  for normal vs pdac and brca <dig> vs brca <dig> tumours. the normalized-γ values are obtained by dividing the γ values by the maximum |γ&pipe;. the significance  was computed against  <dig> background influence values, each generated from  <dig> random shuffles of gene symbols in the expression dataset. the adjusted p-values for differential expression  analysis - whether up-  or down-  regulated from normal to pdac and from brca <dig> to brca <dig> tumours - were computed using limma  <cit> .

ns: not significant at p < <dig> . #genes tested in each case: ∼  <dig> 

differential expression analysis using limma  <cit>  for normal vs pdac indicated that most of the influential tfs were significantly up- or down-regulated . but, a few influential tfs did not show such differential expression, for example heat shock factor- <dig> . investigation into the complexes regulated by hsf <dig> revealed considerable changes in co-expression for the cysteine-aspartic acid protease  family including casp10-casp8-fadd-fas , documented in corum  <cit>  under the functional category ' <dig> .02: apoptosis'. caspases are involved in signal transduction pathways of apoptosis, necrosis and inflammation   <cit> , and the role of hsf <dig> in regulating caspases thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer has been investigated  <cit> .

in the case of brca <dig> vs brca <dig> tumours, only four of the influential tfs  were identified as differentially expressed. these four tfs are er targets. brca <dig> tumours, being predominantly basal-like, do not express er and therefore show lower expression of er targets compared to brca <dig> tumours, which are predominantly luminal-like and express er  <cit> . additionally, joshi et al.  <cit> , using a pathway-based analysis, have noted over-representation of esr <dig>  gata <dig>  myc, xbp <dig>  foxa <dig> and msx <dig> in luminal tumours, and nfκb <dig>  c/ebpβ, foxo <dig>  jun, pou2f <dig> and foxo <dig> in basal-like tumours. we also found higher expression of the nfκb-signalling tfs in brca <dig> tumours - the complex nfκb1-nfκb2-rel-rela-relb composed entirely of nfκb tfs, showed a higher correlation in brca <dig> tumours than brca <dig> tumours. this is consistent with earlier findings  <cit>  that er-negative tumours  display aberrant expression of nfκb which makes these tumours highly aggressive.

these observations also suggest that differential expression is not sensitive enough to identify all the genes  involved in tumours. many of the tfs may not be differentially expressed themselves, but are differentially co-expressed with their target genes. one such possible situation occurs when the tfs themselves are not mutated or  silenced, but their target genes are.

finally,  <dig> of  <dig> tfs in pancreatic, and  <dig> of  <dig> tfs in breast tumours were among the  <dig> cancer tfs listed in  <cit> . david-based functional analysis of tfs showed significant enrichment for several pathways in cancer , in particular the jak-stat pathway , a known driver pathway in cancer  <cit> .

discussion
we had observed considerable ppi rewiring via differential co-expression analysis . in figure  <dig>  we now show the ppi network for normal vs pdac with interactions weighted by the differential co-expression values. figure 7a highlights the largest component , which shows an overall decrease in co-expression. a considerable number of genes in this component are targets of ubiquitination  and sumoylation   possibly causing their inactivation. however, there are several pockets showing increase in co-expression. interestingly some of the genes topologically central to these pockets are known drug targets in pdac , e.g. plk <dig>  <cit>  and anax <dig>  <cit> . similarly pelp <dig> which interacts directly with stat <dig> and is responsible for cell proliferation and survival in several tumours  <cit> , is likewise an identified drug target in pdac  <cit> . a similar analysis in brca <dig> vs brca <dig> tumours highlighted increase in ppi co-expression around the mitotic regulators cdk <dig>  cdc <dig> and cks1b and the histone deacetylases hdac <dig> and hdac6; these are known drug targets for which inhibitors have been developed  <cit> .

we clustered this normal vs pdac network using mcl  both with and without the weights as input, and we observed that most clusters predominantly constitute only one kind of interactions, either those showing increase or decrease in co-expression - of the  <dig> clusters of sizes ≥  <dig>  in  <dig> at least two-thirds of the interactions show a decrease, and in  <dig> at least two-thirds of the interactions show an increase. among these, plk <dig> belonged to a cluster in which all interactions showed an increase . similarly, in the brca <dig> vs brca <dig> network, cdk <dig> and cks1b belonged to a cluster that showed an increase for all its interactions. these observations suggest that identifying clusters  that show increase in co-expression could identify new therapeutic targets in cancer.

CONCLUSIONS
proteins seldom act in isolation, but instead interact to constitute specialized complexes driving key processes. we integrated ppi and gene-expression datasets to perform a large-scale unbaised evaluation of complexes in pdac and familial breast tumours. these complexes showed considerable changes in expression, in particular decreases and countering increases, reflecting compensatory processes coming into play in the tumours. these complexes enable us to explain the possible underlying mechanisms, which is otherwise difficult only by analysing individual genes. these complexes are driven by the concerted action of influential tfs, which themselves work in cooperative and counteractive ways. network-based analysis shows that complexes could have therapeutic potential in cancer.
