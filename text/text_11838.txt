BACKGROUND
micrornas  are a class of small non-coding rnas frequently present as small clusters spanning some kilobases in the genome, that negatively regulate gene expression by targeting mrnas due to sequence complementarity, thereby inducing transcript degradation and/or translational inhibition  <cit> . a single mirna shows complementarity to hundreds or thousands of different transcripts, an ability which gives mirnas the potential to act as central regulatory nodes in gene co-expression networks  <cit> , thereby modulating and providing stability to complex biological processes involving several interconnected signaling pathways such as aging. in recent years, specific mirnas that regulate different aspects of the aging process were identified  <cit> . several mirnas were described to be significantly up- or down-regulated with age, both in invertebrate and vertebrate species  <cit> , some micrornas influence lifespan and/or predict longevity in invertebrate models  and one of these  regulates functional heart aging in mammals  <cit> . microrna- <dig> family members  were shown to be upregulated during normal aging in the central nervous system  of different vertebrate species such as fish  <cit> , mice , monkeys  <cit>  and humans  <cit> . moreover, mir- <dig> appears upregulated in klotho-deficient mice  <cit> , a model of premature aging, and progeroid mouse model zmpste24
–/–  <cit> .

in mammals, the mir- <dig> family is present as two distinct genomic clusters that are both ubiquitously expressed and are particularly enriched in the cns  <cit> , specifically in mature neurons  <cit> . mutant mice lacking both clusters do not present evident abnormalities at birth, but they rapidly accumulate defects during post-natal development and die within 6 weeks  <cit> . mice lacking only one cluster , thus retaining residual mir- <dig> activity, reach adulthood, display an ataxic phenotype, a mild loss of purkinje cells in the cerebellum, and die around 9 months of age  <cit> . a similar cerebellar phenotype is induced by knock-down of mir- <dig> in adult rodents  <cit> . on the other hand, up-regulation of mir- <dig> protects neurons against apoptosis during neuronal maturation, forebrain cerebral ischemia and stroke by targeting pro-apoptotic members of the bcl- <dig> family . interestingly, the mir- <dig> family was found to target beta-site app-cleaving enzyme  mrna and to be downregulated in sporadic alzheimer’s disease  <cit> . all these data indicate that mir- <dig> plays a protective role in neurons and reduced mir- <dig> activity in adult life has detrimental effects.

iron is an element required for multiple fundamental biological processes such as mitochondrial atp generation, dna replication and synthesis of heme, myelin and dopamine  <cit> . while iron is an essential micronutrient, it also represents one of the most powerful sources of oxidative damage. indeed, intermediates of oxygen reduction, including h2o <dig> and superoxide, are potent oxidants in the presence of fe2+ and their reactions with fe2+ form hydroxyl radicals, which cause cytotoxicity primarily due to lipid peroxidation  <cit> . this, along with the evidence that iron accumulates in several tissues with age , supports the prevailing opinion that age-dependent iron accumulation contributes to the aging process by increasing oxygen reactive species production, which over time causes extensive mitochondrial and cellular dysfunction  <cit> . consistently, dietary iron supplementation reduces lifespan and accelerates age-dependent protein aggregation in c. elegans  <cit> . instead, reduced iron absorption increases longevity in flies  <cit>  and iron chelant therapy reduces oxidative stress in worms  <cit> .

iron responsive proteins  and their binding sites in mrnas  constitute an iron sensing system that tightly regulates intracellular iron homeostasis by post-transcriptional regulation of key genes involved in iron uptake, storage, export and utilization  <cit> , thus strongly influencing the energy production and redox status of cells. irp <dig> is particularly enriched in the cns and it appears to play a preeminent role in the regulation of intracellular iron homeostasis within the cns  <cit> . indeed, alteration of irp <dig> alone, but not of irp <dig> alone, induces iron imbalance and iron-mediated toxicity in neurons  <cit> . despite the central role of irps in regulating iron homeostasis, little is known as to their regulation during aging and whether their altered expression contributes to the age-related decline. it is known, however, that downregulation of transferring receptor, a direct target of irps, is among the most robust transcriptional markers of aging  <cit>  .

here, we investigated the role of mir- <dig> during adult life in the short-lived turquoise killifish nothobranchius furzeri﻿﻿ . this is the shortest-lived vertebrate that can be cultured in captivity and has emerged as model organism to study vertebrate aging. its aging is characterized by an exceptionally short lifespan of 4– <dig> months , age-dependent cognitive decline, and expression of age-related phenotypes at the molecular, cellular, and integrated level  . in particular, genome-wide transcript regulation patterns during aging are similar in n. furzeri and humans  <cit>  and mir- <dig> is upregulated during n. furzeri aging  <cit> . it therefore represents an ideal model to investigate how a perturbation of mir- <dig> expression affects aging. we generated a transgenic line with neuronal specific mir- <dig> loss of function and analyzed genome-wide transcript regulation by rna-seq to compare the perturbations induced by mir- <dig> loss with those induced by aging.

RESULTS
mir- <dig> is up-regulated with age in neurons and is negatively-correlated with expression of its targets
we searched the killifish genome  <cit>  for mir- <dig> members and found three distinct mir- <dig> genomic clusters referred to as pri-mir- <dig>  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> . each cluster contains two mir- <dig> mature members, mir-29a is contained in all clusters paired with mir-29b or either of two novel mir- <dig> family members that we provisionally refer to as mir-29d and mir-29e . all of these mirnas share the same seed sequence, but differ in their 3′ ends. thus, we tested whether all three clusters exhibit an age-dependent transcriptional regulation by rt-qpcr. we found that all clusters are actively transcribed; however, one is expressed at much higher level  and also shows the largest age-dependent up-regulation, increasing its expression more than  <dig> times between  <dig> and 27 weeks of age . to assess the impact of mir- <dig> on global age-dependent gene expression, we took advantage of combined rna-seq and mirna-seq data from n. furzeri brain at five ages  <cit>  and considered all protein-coding genes with rapid age-dependent decay in expression . this gene set was enriched for genes containing a mir- <dig> binding site as predicted by miranda  <  <dig> , fisher’s exact test). in addition, mir- <dig> targets showed an excess of negative correlation with mir- <dig> expression as opposed to non-targets . these data suggest that mir- <dig> is a regulator of age-dependent gene expression, as previously reported in the prefrontal cortex of humans and macaques using similar methods  <cit> . since one mir- <dig> primary transcript shows much higher expression than the other two, we focused our investigation on this cluster and used in situ hybridization to define its expression domains in the adult n. furzeri brain. it is intensely expressed in the periventricular gray zone of the optic tectum  and in the granular cell layer of cerebellum , where it is co-localized with the neuronal marker huc/d, thereby confirming the neuronal expression of mir- <dig> originally reported in the mouse  <cit> .fig.  <dig> mir- <dig> is up-regulated with age in neurons. a genomic organization of mir- <dig> family in n. furzeri. three different clusters were isolated  encoding four different mature members mir-29a, b, d, e. in red, seed sequence is reported, single nucleotide differences in blue. b age-dependent expression of mir- <dig> primary transcripts  in the brain of n. furzeri. the relative expression was evaluated by rt-qpcr, data were normalized on tata binding protein , pri-mir-29- <dig> results much more expressed than the other clusters and shows a clear age-dependent up-regulation . c correlation of mir- <dig> with its predicted targets. blue bars show the distribution of pearson’s correlation coefficients between mir-29a and its predicted target. light-blue bars show the distribution of correlation values extracted from a bootstrap . d, e pri-mir-29- <dig> expression pattern in n. furzeri brain. d pri-mir-29- <dig> signal  and huc/d expression  in the optic tectum . pri-mir-29- <dig> shows a nuclear staining and a co-localization with neuronal marker huc/d along the periventricular gray zone , white arrows show neurons in the optic tectum  negative for pri-mir-29- <dig>  scale bar = 50 μm. cerebellum overview picture  shows a clear and strong expression of pri-mir-29- <dig> just in the granular cell layer , it is instead absent in the purkinje cell  and molecular layer . scale bar 100 μm




genetic repression of mir-29
we generated transgenic zebrafish and n. furzeri overexpressing a competitive mir- <dig> inhibitor and evaluated the global effects of mir- <dig> antagonism on gene expression in adult life. we used a well-established strategy by fusing to the egfp cds a 3′-utr bearing seven repetitions of a mir- <dig> binding site to generate a transcript that scavenges endogenous mir- <dig> . as a first step, we tested whether mir-29-sponge mrna was directly targeted by mir- <dig> family members by co-injecting its mrna along with rfp control mrna and mir- <dig> mimics into zebrafish embryos. at 24 hours post-fertilization , injected embryos were dissociated and the relative egfp/rfp fluorescent ratio in dissociated cells was measured by fluorocytometry  . a strong repression of egfp signal was induced by mir- <dig> mimics . we further generated a transgenic zebrafish line where mir-29-sponge expression was controlled by  <dig>  kb of d. rerio actin beta  <dig> promoter tg  to evaluate the biological activity of sponge- <dig> in vivo. for this purpose, we took advantage of the extremely low expression of mir- <dig> during the first 2 days of embryonic development  <cit>  and injected increasing doses of mir-29a or mir-29b mimics  both in wild-type and in tg zebrafish embryos. both mimics induced similar effects in wild-type embryos and 200 pg of mimic were sufficient to induce overt morphological defects like brachyury, microcephaly, and microphthalmia. the percentage of defective embryos induced by mir- <dig> mimics was much lower in the tg line . to assess the effects of sponge- <dig> on gene regulation, we injected doses that were not inducing morphological defects  and analyzed two well-validated mir- <dig> targets: elna <dig>  and col11a1a , both highly expressed in embryos and bearing in their 3′-utr four and two predicted target binding sites, respectively . we observed a dose-dependent down-regulation of these transcripts in wild-type, but not in tg injected embryos . all these data support the notion that genetically modified fish with stable sponge- <dig> overexpression counteract mir-29-induced gene regulation in vivo. since pri-mir-29- <dig> is mainly expressed in neurons, we decided to antagonize mir- <dig> activity specifically in neuronal cells and evaluate the effects on global gene expression. to this end, we isolated from zebrafish genomic dna a  <dig>  kb fragment of the neuronal specific promoter dre-kif5aa , thus generating the transgenic line tg. this kif5aa promoter fragment was sufficient to maintain the expression of egfp-sponge- <dig> throughout life both in zebrafish and n. furzeri. since zebrafish life expectancy is about 5 years  <cit> , we decided to generate a stable line in the short-lived turquoise killifish in order to more rapidly investigate the consequences of mir- <dig> depletion during adult life. to this end, we used the mzm- <dig> strain with a median lifespan of approximately 7 months  <cit> . n. furzeri f <dig> fish exhibited a stable expression over time  and a double labeling with egfp and huc/d proved the neuronal specificity of the expression pattern . we did not observe any macroscopic defect, but did observe a reduced fertility and reduced post hatch survival, which limited the number of animals that could be analyzed. it should be noted that a full knock-out of mir- <dig> is postnatally lethal in the mouse  <cit> , so reduced viability is expected and the fact that some transgenic fish reached adulthood could be due to the incomplete antagonism of mir- <dig> by

mir- <dig> antagonism mimics aging-induced gene regulation in n. furzeri brain
we analyzed the global gene expression profile in f <dig> sponge- <dig> transgenic fish through rna-seq. our previous rna-seq analysis of transcriptome regulation during aging in the turquoise killifish brain showed that the most relevant change in global gene expression occurs between  <dig> and 12 weeks  <cit> . here, we decided to compare the expression profile of 12-week-old transgenic fish with 12-week-old wild-type fish, using four biological replicates for the experimental group. we detected  <dig> differentially-expressed genes . kegg pathway analysis revealed an over-representation among up-regulated genes of terms involved in energy production processes such as oxidative phosphorylation and tca cycle as well as ribosome biogenesis, lysosome, phagosome, and endoplasmic reticulum functions and downstream p <dig> effectors  and an overrepresentation among down-regulated degs for terms involved in biosynthesis and catabolism of biomolecules, extracellular remodeling, circadian rhythm and the following pathways: jak-stat, mapk, wnt, and notch . several of these pathways were previously reported to be regulated in the n. furzeri brain during aging . remarkably, the majority of these pathways showed the same direction of regulation during aging and in response to mir- <dig> antagonism  and only a minority showed opposite directions of regulation . moreover, in a longitudinal study of n. furzeri, baumgart et al.  <cit>  reported that a higher expression of genes belonging to the oxidative phosphorylation, phagosome, lysosome, ribosome biogenesis, and rna transport pathways is negatively correlated with lifespan. on the other hand, higher expression of extracellular matrix-receptor interaction genes is positively correlated with lifespan  <cit> . therefore, our results indicate that mir- <dig> antagonism induces an up-regulation of those pathways negatively correlated with lifespan , with the exception of rna transport and spliceosome pathways and a down-regulation of the only pathway positively correlated with lifespan . among up regulated degs, we found  <dig> genes negatively correlated and  <dig> positively correlated with lifespan ; among down-regulated degs, we found  <dig> genes negatively correlated and  <dig> positively correlated with lifespan . we interpret these data as a signature of accelerated aging. to corroborate our hypothesis, we compared the effects of aging and mir- <dig> antagonism at the individual gene level. we intersected the sets of degs of sponge- <dig> transgenic fish and aging . the intersection contains  <dig> genes  and  <dig>  show the same direction of regulation in aging and mir- <dig> sponge . of those,  <dig> are up-regulated  and  <dig> are down-regulated  in both conditions . only  <dig> genes  showed opposite regulation:  <dig> down-regulated in sponge- <dig> and up-regulated during aging  and  <dig> with the opposite behavior . furthermore, we assessed the expression profile of genes with a conserved predicted binding site for mir- <dig>  to this end, we retrieved a list of d. rerio  <dig> predicted targets  from targetscanfish  <dig>   <cit> . out of those,  <dig> genes were degs in kif5a: sponge-29 n. furzeri fish;  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated . a total of 22/28 n. furzeri ortholog up-regulated genes exhibited a conserved binding site . for 10/ <dig>  the mir- <dig> predicted binding site was conserved also in the mouse and human orthologs and for  <dig> of these an interaction with mir- <dig> was observed also by cross-linking immunoprecipitation -seq . among these, we found genes involved in epigenetic reprogramming , dot1-like, histone h <dig> methyltransferase , enhancer of polycomb homolog  <dig> ), glutamate metabolism ), and igf <dig> signaling ), consistent with the known biological actions of mir- <dig> reported in the literature. curiously, among the down-regulated degs, we found well-known mammalian mir- <dig> targets such as ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase  <dig> , dna -methyltransferase 3ab , and collagen type iv alpha  <dig>  . thus, we examined the effect of aging on conserved mir- <dig> predicted targets. of  <dig> up-regulated targets, 6/ <dig> are type  <dig> genes  and 12/ <dig> were not regulated by aging, indicating that those mir- <dig> could directly influence their expression by regulating transcript stability. on the other hand 4/ <dig> up-regulated targets and 9/ <dig> down-regulated targets were type  <dig> and type  <dig> genes , i.e., showed the same direction of regulation during aging and in response to mir- <dig> antagonism, indicating that, for these genes, the global effect of mir- <dig> depletion on aging-dependent gene expression is prevalent over the target-specific effect of mir- <dig> fig.  <dig> mir- <dig> antagonism partially recapitulates aging. a, b kegg pathway overrepresentation analysis on degs . the red and black asterisks indicate categories of degs regulated with age in the brain . red colored asterisk indicates categories that exhibit the same direction of regulation in both aging and tg. black colored asterisk indicates those with opposite regulation. gray plus and minus symbols represent categories that positively and negatively correlates with lifespan respectively  c venn diagram illustrating the intersection between up and downregulated degs in sponge- <dig> and genes positively and negatively correlated with lifespan, respectively . d venn diagram illustrating the intersection between degs during aging and degs in sponge- <dig>  e correlation analysis of fold-changes of genes in the intersection shown in . pie chart represents the fraction of genes coherently or incoherently regulated by aging and sponge-29




mir- <dig> affects iron homeostasis via regulation of irp2
the observed transcriptomic signature of accelerated brain ageing induced by mir- <dig> antagonism is likely due to dysregulation of multiple pathways. however, kegg pathway analysis retrieved a consistent overrepresentation of terms related to energy production processes, in particular mitochondria processes such as oxidative phosphorylation and tca cycle. further, among type- <dig> genes, i.e., genes normally downregulated during aging but up-regulated in sponge- <dig> transgenic fishes, we noticed genes that have a key-role in the regulation of iron homeostasis or heme synthesis such as transferrin , transferrin receptor , the ferroxidase ceruloplasmin , and the heme transporter scl22a <dig>  since iron is a key-molecule for mitochondria activity and energy production and iron imbalances have profound implications in the aging-induced dysfunctions and lifespan extension  <cit> , we supposed that this specific process may contribute to the accelerated aging phenotype observed upon mir- <dig> loss of function. the dysregulation of tfr1a is particularly interesting for at least three different reasons:  trf1a is the primary carrier responsible for iron import,  its expression is much higher in neurons than in glial cells in vivo  <cit> , and  a meta-analysis of microarray studies identified tfrc  as the gene with the most robust age-dependent downregulation across multiple tissues and mammalian species and it is considered as part of a common transcriptional signature of aging  <cit> . we therefore investigated the presence of possible mir- <dig> binding sites in mrnas coding for genes involved in iron homeostasis and noticed the presence of an 8 nt seed sequence in the 3′-utr of the iron-responsive element binding protein  <dig>  mrna that is conserved across vertebrates . accordingly, both miranda  <cit>  and targetscan  <cit>  retrieved ireb <dig> mrna as a target for mir- <dig> in both fishes and mammals. in addition, starbase supports a physical interaction of mir- <dig> and ireb <dig> 3′-utr in human and mouse  <cit> . the ireb <dig> gene encodes for the protein irp <dig> that, along with irp <dig>  is considered a master regulator of intracellular iron homeostasis. to demonstrate a direct regulation of ireb <dig> mrna by mir- <dig> in fishes, we isolated the 3′-utrs of ireb <dig> from zebrafish and n. furzeri cdna and fused either of them with the egfp coding sequence to generate a reporter construct; 100 pg of each reporter mrna were co-injected in fertilized zebrafish embryos in combination with the same amount of control mrna encoding for the red fluorescence protein  and 100 pg of dre-mir-29a or dre-mir-29b mimic. control embryos were injected with the same mixture omitting the mirna mimics. at  <dig> hpf, 30– <dig> injected embryos were digested and cell fluorescence was analyzed by cytofluorimetry to assess the relative egfp/rfp fluorescence ratio. for both 3′-utrs, the normalized egfp fluorescence was significantly reduced in the presence of mir- <dig> mimics . for both constructs, a mutation of three nucleotides in the putative target sequence of the 3′-utrs abolished repression . in addition, we performed a luciferase assay in the human hek293t cell line to demonstrate direct targeting of ireb <dig> 3′-utr by mir- <dig> in mammals. mir- <dig> decreased luciferase activity of a reporter containing mouse ireb <dig> 3′-utr and repression was abrogated by mutation of three nucleotides in the putative binding site . given the direct interaction between mir- <dig> and ireb <dig>  we tested whether ireb <dig> expression is reduced during aging. the variations in ireb <dig> expression are not significant at the level of mrna, but are significant at the protein level . to investigate the impact of ipr <dig> downregulation, we analyzed the age-dependent expression of mrnas coding for its direct targets: tfr1a, scl11a <dig>  fth1a, and slc40a <dig> . consistently with irp <dig> downregulation, expression of transferrin receptor  and the solute carrier transporter 11a <dig>  gene, directly involved in intracellular iron delivery, decreased with age . on the other hand, transcripts coding for ferritin heavy chain  and ferroportin , genes required for iron storage and discharge, were not significantly regulated . specific age-dependent downregulation of intracellular iron delivery genes is likely a direct result of iron accumulation, as the same specific regulation was observed in mammals  <cit> . to directly demonstrate iron accumulation during normal aging, we quantified brain non-heme iron concentration using a colorimetric assay  <cit>  in fish of five age groups: at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 39 weeks. these age steps correspond to sexual maturity , young adult stage , median lifespan , and exceptional survivors . from  <dig> to 39 weeks of age, non-heme iron amount increases almost 10-fold in fish brains . this datum was corroborated by histochemical pearl’s staining with dab intensification on brain sections. increased labelling was apparent both in gray and white matter of 39-week-old fish . in mammals, iron loading negatively regulates irp <dig> by inducing cytosolic fbxl <dig> accumulation that in turn induces irp <dig> proteasomal degradation. since iron accumulates during aging, we would expect to observe an age-dependent fbxl <dig> up-regulation along with irp <dig> reduction but neither fbxl <dig> mrna nor its protein were significantly modulated by age . thus, the observed age-dependent downregulation of irp <dig> cannot be mediated by fbxl <dig>  but could be mediated by mir- <dig>  we therefore quantified the expression of irp <dig> and tfr1a in brains of wild-type and tg fish at young adult  stage. both proteins were found up-regulated in sponge- <dig> lines compared to control animals . in addition, we analyzed the regulation of irp <dig> over time in fish overexpressing mir- <dig> sponge and found no significant reduction over time as opposed to the clear age-dependent regulation observed in wild-type fish . finally, we tested in zebrafish embryos whether mir- <dig> overexpression represses tfr1a expression by microinjecting <dig> and 150 pg of mir- <dig> mimic in wild-type and tg embryos. no significant ireb <dig> mrna downregulation was observed , but a significant reduction of tfr1a mrna was observed in wild-type embryos but not in tg embryos .fig.  <dig> mir- <dig> family targets ireb <dig> mrna. a presence of a putative binding site for mir- <dig>

overall, these data strongly indicate that mir- <dig> is responsible for age-dependent downregulation of irp <dig> in neurons that, in turn, reduces tfr1a expression. as a proof of principle that mir- <dig> could exhibit a conserved regulation of iron homeostasis also in mammals, we evaluated the expression of mir- <dig> and iron management genes during post-natal development in the mouse brain. a dramatic up-regulation of mature mir- <dig> members during the first 2 months of postnatal life was already described  <cit> . we tested whether mir- <dig> increase correlates with ireb <dig> and tfr1a downregulation. using rt-qpcr, we quantified the expression of both mir- <dig> primary transcripts in postnatal day  <dig>  and p <dig> mouse cerebral cortex. both increased their expression more than  <dig> times  while ireb <dig>  tfr1a, and scl11a2/dmt <dig> were significantly downregulated . in addition, during the preparation of this manuscript, papadopulous et al.  <cit>  reported that mice lacking one locus for mir- <dig> show up-regulation of ireb <dig>  lending further support to a direct regulation of irp <dig> expression by mir- <dig> in vivo.

neuronal-specific overexpression of irp <dig> leads to mitochondria damage and pervasive oxidative stress  <cit> . therefore, we assessed iron content and histochemical markers of damage in the sponge- <dig> transgenic line. non-heme iron content was significantly increased as compared to wild-types at age 12 weeks . to assess whether increased iron induced oxidative stress we analyzed lipofuscin, an autofluorescent pigment that is primarily composed of cross-linked protein residues, generated by iron-catalyzed oxidative processes  <cit> . lipofuscin deposition was quantified in the periventricular grey zone of the optic tectum, a brain region composed by tightly packed neuronal somata and that shows a strong expression of mir- <dig>  and was significantly increased in the sponge- <dig> line as compared to wild-type . finally, gliosis was assessed as a nonspecific reactive change of glial cells in response to neuronal damage. increased immunoreactivity for the glial markers gfap and s100β was observed .

our data indicate that mir- <dig> upregulation with age reduces irp2-tfr1a axis in neurons thereby reducing intracellular iron delivery and limiting iron-mediated neuronal damage.

to study the effects of iron on expression of mir- <dig> in neurons we employed murine stem-cell derived telencephalic neurons in vitro  <cit> . incubation of murine neurons with either fe or fe-dextran induced an up-regulation of mir- <dig> . we then induced acute iron overload in adult fish by parental injection of 350 μg per gram of weight of fe-dextran and monitored brain iron concentration and mir- <dig> expression up to 3 days post-injection . iron significantly accumulated in the brain  <dig> hpi  reaching a maximum at 8– <dig> hpi to slowly decrease . we observed a delayed and significant increase of both the prevalent mir- <dig> primary transcript and mir-29a mature form, following the injection, starting at  <dig> hpi and reaching its maximum at  <dig> hpi . in addition, iron overload caused up-regulation of mir- <dig> also in liver and muscle , suggesting a systemic effect. we then asked whether physiological steady-state levels of iron influence mir- <dig> expression by injecting i.p. 30 μg/g of the iron chelant deferoxamine . at  <dig> hpi, brain iron amount was reduced by 25% , we did not aim for stronger reduction of iron since this can have serious negative consequences on physiology. we monitored pri-mir-29- <dig> expression at  <dig>   <dig> and 72 hours after dfo injection and did not detect any differences despite reduced iron levels , suggesting that lowering iron below physiological levels does not regulate mir- <dig>  finally, we replicated the iron-overload experiment and, after 4 hours, administered dfo. delayed chelation of iron significantly reduced pri-mir- <dig> up-regulation .fig.  <dig> iron overload induces mir- <dig> up-regulation in neurons and brain. a, b modulation of mir- <dig> family members in murine neurons derived from mescs incubated respectively with a  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or 200 μg/ml of fe-dextran or with b  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or 100 μm of feso <dig> for 72 hours , n =  <dig> independent experiments performed in duplicates for each condition. c time course of non-heme iron amount  and pri-mir-29- <dig> expression level in fish brain  following intraperitoneal  injection of 350 μg/g of iron dextran, control animals were injected with saline solution. grey line represents iron amount, blue line represents pri-mir-29- <dig> relative expression level , n =  <dig> biological replicates for each point. d relative expression of mir- <dig> primary transcripts  in liver, brain and muscle 48 hours following i.p. injection of 350 μg/g of iron dextran. data were normalized on tbp expression and control animals relative expression was considered as baseline , n =  <dig> biological replicates. e expression of mature n.fu-mir-29a at 48 hours after iron injection quantified by rt-qpcr , n =  <dig> biological replicates for each time point, u <dig> was used as normalization control. f non-heme iron quantification 24 hours after deferoxamine  i.p. injection, control animals were injected with saline solution , n =  <dig> control animals and n =  <dig> dfo injected animals. g time course of pri-mir-29- <dig> expression level  following i.p. injection of 30 μg/g of dfo, one-way anova p =  <dig> , n =  <dig> biological replicates for each time point. h modulation of pri-mir-29- <dig> expression in fish brain  after iron overload and in combination with administration of 30 μg/g of dfo, control animals were injected with saline solution , n =  <dig> biological replicates. for all the graphs, mean ± standard errors of means are reported




our results suggest that iron amount affects mir- <dig> expression; however, since the delay between mir- <dig> increases and iron-overload, we consider that intracellular events triggered by iron increase and not iron directly are responsible for up-regulation of mir- <dig> 

discussion
here, we report the first case of modulation of neuronal aging by a mirna in a vertebrate species. neuronal-specific mir- <dig> loss of function induces accelerated expression of aging phenotypes both at the global gene expression level and the histological level. age-dependent up-regulation of mir- <dig> is conserved among different vertebrate species and different tissues. with our work, we show that, in fish,  mir- <dig> is expressed in mature neurons as previously shown in mice,  a robust negative correlation between expression of mir- <dig> and its targets is observed during adult life, as previously shown in primates  <cit> , and  mir- <dig> loss of function has detrimental effects, as previously observed in mammals both in physiological  <cit>  and pathological contexts such as ischemia  <cit> , cancer  <cit> , thymus involution  <cit> , and inflammatory response  <cit> . therefore, mir- <dig> upregulation appears to be an evolutionary conserved aging signature that provides an advantage in opposing aging-induced dysfunctions. this hypothesis is further supported by the observation that mir- <dig> is upregulated in a mouse model of progeria  <cit> . in addition, during killifish aging, mir- <dig> is upregulated also in liver, skin  <cit> , and heart . consistently, mir- <dig> is reported to be upregulated in several tissues in aging mammals as well . thus, mir- <dig> upregulation appears to be a common aging mechanism across different tissues.

these data also lead to the general concept that part of age-dependent gene regulation is adaptive and protective. indeed, a recent study showed that out of  <dig> conserved genes that are down-regulated with age in nematode worms, fish, and mice,  <dig> cause life extension when experimentally down-regulated in the worm  <cit>  and it was previously shown that mir- <dig> is upregulated with age in fruit fly and its overexpression is life-extending while the knock-out is life-shortening  <cit> .

although we did not investigate the molecular mechanism underlying age-dependent mir- <dig> upregulation, here we observed that mir- <dig> loss of function leads to increased iron deposition in the adult killifish brain and that, in turn, acute iron loading induces mir- <dig> upregulation in brain, liver, and muscle. in this respect, it should be noticed that age-dependent iron accumulation was observed in several organisms such us c. elegans, d. melanogaster  <cit> , mice  <cit> , primates  <cit> , and humans  <cit> . in mammals, iron increase is observed in several tissues, such as brain, heart, muscle, liver, skin, kidney, and spleen, and it appears to be a robust aging hallmark. however, our data also demonstrate that mir- <dig> does not respond immediately to an acute increase iron concentrations, but with a delay of 2 days. we therefore speculate that age-dependent accumulation of iron-mediated damage might represent the stimulus that triggers mir- <dig> upregulation during aging.

further, we report that mir- <dig> regulates irp <dig> expression directly and antagonism of mir- <dig> abrogates age-dependent repression of irp <dig> in neurons, which is very likely the cause of increased iron accumulation in the brain of the sponge- <dig> line. in fact, irp <dig> is an rna-binding protein that acts as master regulator of intracellular iron availability in the brain, influencing both the energy production and the redox status of the cell. similarly to mir- <dig>  irp <dig> in enriched in the cns. within the cns, different cell types  express iron management genes at different levels due to differences in their iron requirement and utilization. for instance, neurons express high levels of tfr1a and low levels of ferritin which, on the other hand, is strongly expressed in astrocytes and microglia  <cit> . indeed, the neuronal-specific expression of tfr1a reflects their high-energy metabolic rate, while the relative low ferritin expression suggests that, as opposed to astrocytes, iron storage is negligible as compared to iron usage by mitochondria and other metabolic processes. moreover, neuronal restricted expression of mitochondrial ferritin in the mammalian brain further supports this consideration  <cit> . in addition, in rodents, the highest neuronal iron consumption seems to occur during perinatal development and coincides with neuronal maturation and myelin synthesis  <cit> ; subsequently, neuronal iron demand decreases along with tfr1a mrna expression. due to the low cytosolic iron storage capacity of neurons, a small increase in iron loading may result in mitochondrial iron accumulation and significant changes in the mitochondrial redox status. thus, modulation of tfr1a expression is crucial for redox status homeostasis in neurons. in fact, our work revealed that mir- <dig> increases in aging reduce irp <dig> and tfr1a levels, therefore limiting excessive intracellular iron delivery and protecting neurons from iron-mediated toxicity. although irp <dig> simultaneously regulates several iron-management genes, neuron-specific loss-of-function of mir- <dig> results in a significant modulation of tfr1a, but not of cytosolic fth1a nor of scl40a <dig>  suggesting that neurons might regulate iron homeostasis primarily through modulation of tfr1a. since expressions of fth1a, scl40a <dig>  and fbxl <dig> – all linked to cytosolic iron – were stable during aging, we speculate that iron might accumulate primarily in the mitochondria causing mitochondrial dysfunction and that this effect is exacerbated by mr- <dig> knockdown. our hypothesis is supported by the up-regulation of energy production pathways such as oxidative phosphorylation and tca cycle in the sponge- <dig> line and by the direct demonstration that irp <dig> upregulation induces mitochondrial iron accumulation in human lung cells  <cit> . moreover, la vaute et al.  <cit>  showed that irp2-deficient mice exhibit neurodegeneration linked to cytosolic iron accumulation in gray and white matter. deficiency of irp <dig> increases the expression of the iron storage protein ferritin and reduces the expression of the transferrin receptor leading to functional iron deficiency and therefore neuronal death. the same team reported a markedly reduced activity of mitochondria complex i and ii as a consequence of iron starvation  <cit> , and galy et al.  <cit>  reported that correct mitochondria iron supply requires irp <dig> in mouse liver. all these data indicate that an important function of irp <dig> is to control mitochondrial iron homoeostasis, thereby preventing iron starvation. our work integrates this view, identifying a novel mechanism of irp <dig> regulation, mediated by mir- <dig> that contributes to the prevention of iron-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.

a direct relation between aging and iron homeostasis was reported also by klang et al.  <cit> , showing that dietary iron supplementation significantly accelerates the onset of aging-related phenotypes, reduces the lifespan expectancy and increases the age-dependent protein aggregation in ﻿c. elegans﻿. strikingly, tca cycle and oxidative phosphorylation proteins are the most enriched proteins in the iron-induced aggregates. conversely, the sponge- <dig> lines exhibited up-regulation of the same categories at the transcript level. overall, these data suggest two important considerations:  the transcriptional up-regulation of tca cycle and oxidative phosphorylation proteins in response to mir- <dig> loss-of-function represents a compensatory response to iron-induced damage of mitochondrial protein. up-regulation of these categories is therefore a marker of compromised mitochondrial functionality and of accelerated aging. consistently, baumgart et al.  <cit>  showed that increased expression of oxidative phosphorylation genes  negatively correlates with killifish lifespan.  iron accumulation compromises mitochondrial activity, corroborating the observation that age-dependent iron accumulation occurs primarily in the mitochondria and that mir- <dig> might promote mitochondrial integrity through regulation of iron homeostasis.

CONCLUSIONS
age-related damage accumulation is an inescapable condition that tends to change cellular homeostasis; on the other hand, cells tend to maintain their homeostasis inducing a progressive and adaptive response in order to counteract this inevitable process and preserve their physiological functions. age-dependent up-regulation of mir- <dig> is part of this adaptive response and its deficiency leads to exacerbation of aging-induced damage , partly due to impaired iron homeostasis.fig.  <dig> schematic model of mir- <dig> action in brain aging. during aging an accumulation of iron in neurons occurs. this induces expression of mir- <dig> that in turn represses expression of irp- <dig> thereby limiting iron uptake. this mechanism counteracts aging-related damages. mir- <dig> may also counteract effects aging-related phenotypes by additional mechanisms, for example modulation of pro-apoptotic bcl- <dig> family members  <cit>
