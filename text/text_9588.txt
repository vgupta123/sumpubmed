BACKGROUND
unicellular marine photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms represent much of the untapped genetic diversity reservoir of our planet
 <cit> . their ecological importance in the global carbon cycle
 <cit>  and their biotechnological potential as possible sources of biofuels and dietary «omega-3» lipid food supplements, have fostered several genome projects to gain knowledge into their diversity and metabolic potential
. ostreococus tauri is the smallest photosynthetic eukaryote known and its genome was the first marine green algal genome to be sequenced. it has a simple cellular organization with a single mitochondrion and a single chloroplast
 <cit> , all orchestrated by a 13 mb haploid nuclear genome
 <cit> . its compact genome, ease of culture and genetic transformation by homologous recombination promoted o. tauri as an ideal model for cell biology
 <cit> . it has been successfully used to gain knowledge into fundamental cellular processes such as the cell cycle
, the circadian clock
, lipid
 <cit>  and starch synthesis
 <cit> , as well as the mechanisms of genome evolution
.

high throughput technologies approaches are revolutionizing research on phytoplanktonic eukaryotes
 <cit> . illumina, among the market leaders for low cost nucleotide sequencing
 <cit> , has been broadly adopted for sequencing phytoplanktonic eukaryotes. to what extent this approach delivers worthy genome sequence therefore merits critical appraisal. comparative studies to assess the quality of de novo assemblies are scarce and suggest that assembly quality varies widely from one species to another and from one assembler to another
 <cit> . even fewer studies have been made to evaluate the quality and accuracy of de novo scaffolds
 <cit>  , as the major limiting step is the availability of a high quality reference genome sequence to benchmark an assembly resulting from processing short reads.table  <dig>

 <dig> the number of scaffolds was greatly reduced compared to the number of contigs.



dna was extracted from the o. tauri strain in  <dig>  and in  <dig>  and  <dig> millions paired-end dnaseq reads were generated from each extraction. these datasets were used to compare the output of three de novo assembly algorithms. the resulting assemblies were benchmarked against the o. tauri sequenced genome to estimate their quality and the percent of the genome covered. combined with rnaseq data, this data led to a significant improvement of the reference genome sequence by resolving  <dig> gaps corresponding to 460 kb and resulting in a remarkable improvement of the  <dig> protein coding genes models.

genetic selection pressures differ between organisms that grow in the wild, that are subject for example to limiting environmental conditions  and in the laboratory, where mutations favouring growth in culture are expected to become fixed over time
 <cit> . previous studies on a few genes have revealed amino-acid differences that result in marked differences in the phenotype of the s. cereviseae lab strain as compared to wild strains
 <cit> . more recently, illumina sequencing allowed scientists to track  <dig> mutations in yeast during three experiments selecting for increased growth rates in a constant environment
 <cit> . the o. tauri strain has been maintained in laboratory culture conditions since its isolation in 1995
 <cit> . the comparison between the  <dig> and  <dig> sequence data enabled us to investigate genome stability of o. tauri over approximately  <dig> generations of lab subculturing.

methods
data
we used the o. tauri whole genome sequence as a reference , sequenced on two bac and five shotgun libraries
 <cit> . the scaffolding was improved by using information about the location of each contig in a bac library hybridized to macroarrays
 <cit> , leading to  <dig> scaffolds representing a total of  <dig>  mb, corresponding to  <dig> chromosomes. the reference genome assembly contained  <dig> gaps as a consequence of low coverage .

the culture used for the reference genome sequence came from a natural sample of o. tauri isolated  <dig> in the thau lagoon
 <cit>  and maintained by serial subcultures using 50 ml plastic tissue culture flasks in 20 ml k medium at 20°c under  <dig> μe s-1 m- <dig> constant light in banyuls sur mer. every  <dig> to 3 weeks the cells reach a stationary phase  and 20 μl  is sub-cultured in fresh k media. this culture was cloned in  <dig> on agar plate and the cloned culture was maintained in the lab.

dna extraction was performed on the  <dig> and the  <dig> culture as previously described
 <cit> . genomic dna of the ot strain from  <dig> , from the same extraction sample that was used for sanger sequencing, and  <dig>  was randomly sheared into ~250-bp fragments. the libraries created from these fragments were sequenced on an illumina gaiix system at the joint genome institute. the sequencing experiment produced  <dig> millions and  <dig> millions 76 bp paired-end reads with an average insert size of  <dig> nucleotides. the alignment of these paired-end reads against the reference genome sequence , produced an average coverage of  <dig> and  <dig> reads per reference base pair in ot- <dig> and ot- <dig>  respectively. both  <dig> and  <dig> cultures were non-axenic and contained bacteria, as judged from the presence of bacterial contigs in the assemblies
 <cit> . as the ot- <dig> dataset corresponded to a clonal strain, this dataset was used for analysis of de novo assemblers and genome update. the clonal strain resequenced in  <dig> has been submitted to the roscoff culture collection under accession number rcc <dig>  the illumina dataset have been deposited in the sra archive under accession numbers: srx <dig> and srx <dig> 

de novoassemblies of o. taurigenome
we used  <dig> de novo assemblers velvet
 <cit>  , abyss
 <cit>   and clcbio  . these tools have a de-bruijn graph based algorithm and are well suited for short paired-end reads. during the scaffolding step, the number of paired-end reads required to join  <dig> contigs into a scaffold was set to  <dig> for both velvet and abyss. as there is no scaffolding step for clcbio we used sspace
 <cit> . among the assemblies build with different k-mer sizes, the assembly with the highest weighted median length, n <dig>  was kept for comparison between assemblers. the quality of de novo assemblies was assessed in terms of contiguity and correctness on scaffolds with a size greater than 500 bp. to remove bacterial sequences, contigs with less than 70% nucleotide identity  with available mamiellales genome sequences were eliminated
 <cit> . these comprised: bathycoccus prasinos, micromonas pusilla, micromonas rcc <dig>  ostreococcus rcc <dig> and ostreococcus lucimarinus and ostreococcus tauri. contiguity statistics were the number of scaffolds, the n <dig>  the assembly size and the percentage of the reference genome covered by the scaffolds .

assessing assembly error rates of de novoscaffolds
scaffolds were aligned against the reference genome using nucmer from mummer v <dig> 
 <cit>  with default options except for "-maxmatch -l  <dig> -banded -d 5". a minimum exact-match anchor size was set to 30 bp and a minimum combined anchor length to 65 bp per cluster. following salzberg et al.
 <cit> , we discarded alignments with less than 95% identity, or more than 95% overlap with another alignment using delta-filter. from these alignments we tallied the correctness statistics using dnadiff
 <cit>  from mummer v <dig> . the output was filtered by removing all regions corresponding to repeated elements . the correctness statistics are: the number of mis-joins  as defined in salzberg et al.
 <cit> . a mis-join is defined when subparts of a scaffold align on two different chromosomes , on the same chromosome in a different order  or are inverted compared to the reference . the error rate was computed as the mean number of mis-joins per scaffolds and as the proportion of scaffolds having at least one mis-join. to assess precisely how coding sequences  were represented in de novo assemblies, we calculated the percent of aligned bases in the cds from dnadiff after a nucmer alignment of the scaffolds against the cds sequences. the number of complete cds  present in the assembly was obtained from the show-coords files .

improving a historical reference genome
gap closing was performed in  <dig> steps using the ot- <dig> dataset  de novo assembly,  image and  pcr sequencing  crac. de novo scaffolds recruitment to close gaps in the reference genome sequence was done as follows. de novo scaffolds were aligned onto the reference genome sequence using blastn. if the scaffold aligned onto the reference over 200 bp with 95% identity and with at least 50 bp on each side of a gap, the sequence of the scaffold was used to close the gap. as de novo assemblers may discard some informative low copy reads, we also used raw reads to improve the reference genome with two further steps. in a second step, we performed local iterative de novo assemblies using image
 <cit>   and the  <dig> millions paired-end reads. we divided the genome into  <dig> super-contigs corresponding to n =  <dig> gaps and chromosomes . image aligned the 41 m paired-end reads illumina dataset against these super contigs using bwa . image subsequently gathered paired-end reads for which only one of the paired reads mapped at the end of one of two super contigs separated by a gap. if at least  <dig> paired-end reads were gathered, image performed a local assembly of these paired-end reads to elongate contigs iteratively.

since the publication of the first version of the genome, primers have been designed manually to fill additional gaps, especially around coding regions. dna from pcr were sent to sequencing platforms and this enabled  <dig> additional gaps in the updated genome version to be closed.

as a last step we used crac, a sensitive mapping method that uses a k-mer profiling approach of reads onto a reference genome
 <cit> . crac first collects for each k-mer in the read its locations on the genome and its support , then analyses both the variation of location and of support within the read: this enables the precise detection of deletions, insertions or translocations with dna-seq data. this enabled us to extract paired reads that align on two different scaffolds and that could have been omitted in the previous approaches. we manually checked the positions mapped by these paired end reads on the reference genome and performed a manual assembly when possible. this enabled the filling of  <dig> additional gaps and the identification of two errors in the assembly that corresponded to inversions of one scaffold relative to its neighboring scaffolds.

the mapping of the illumina reads onto the reference  enabled the identification of nucleotide insertions/deletions  variants compared to the reference genome sequence. a base in the reference was considered to be incorrect if at least a minimum of  <dig> reads scored the nucleotide differently . the incorrect nucleotide was then changed to the most occurring nucleotide if occurring in more than 90% of dna reads. previous analysis on snp-calling on o. tauri mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes enabled us to estimate empirically that these coverage thresholds corresponded to 100% correct snp predictions
 <cit> . we applied the same cut-off for insertion/deletion correction of the reference genome sequence.

genome evolution between  <dig> and 2009
ot- <dig> and ot- <dig> reads were aligned on the reference genome with bwa with default parameters
 <cit> . we used custom c scripts to scan the pileup files to call variants. there were  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> sites covered by a minimum of  <dig> reads and a maximum, which was chosen as  <dig> for ot- <dig> and  <dig> for ot- <dig> reads were retained for the analysis of the ot- <dig> , to discard low covered regions and possible duplicated regions in the reference genome. candidate substitutions were identified when 99% of the ot- <dig> reads were consistent with the reference nucleotide and 99% of the ot- <dig> reads were consistent with the variant. this led to  <dig> candidate substitutions. in order to confirm each of these substitutions, we designed primers  to sequence 100 bp each side of the substitution in the ot- <dig> and the ot- <dig> samples. the position of the substitution within the gene and the type of mutations  was obtained from manual inspection of the alignments of the  <dig> and  <dig> coding sequences. we used tmhmm to identify transmembrane domains 
 <cit> . the information about the gene families  within sequenced green alga and land plants genomes, corresponding to the genes containing non-sense or frameshift mutations, were retrieved from the pico-plaza database
 <cit> . the absence of a homologous gene was further confirmed by a tblastn against the genome sequence.

to investigate copy number variations between  <dig> and  <dig>  we analysed the coverage over 50 bp windows along the chromosomes. whenever we found a two fold or higher increase in coverage  with the ot- <dig> reads, it was compared with the ot- <dig> coverage.

updated genome sequence annotation
rnaseq data was obtained from cells grown under diurnal ld cycles . as most genes are expressed rhythmically in these conditions
 <cit> , we isolated rna every 3 hours over a 24 hours cycle and pooled the samples for sequencing. rna was extracted using the rneasy-plus mini kit  following the manufacturer's instructions. contaminating dna was removed using rq <dig> rnase-free dnase . poly-a rna was isolated and paired-end librairies were generated following the protocol from the illumina mrna-seq sample prep kit. sequencing was carried out on a single lane of illumina giix and 76 bp paired-end reads were obtained.

rnaseq data was used to guide the annotation procedure using the annotation pipeline developed at gent university. similar scripts can be downloaded from
https://mulcyber.toulouse.inra.fr/projects/eugene/. the updated genomic sequence of o. tauri was annotated by using the eugene
 <cit>  gene finding system. both eugene  as well as splice-machine
 <cit>  were specifically trained for o. tauri datasets. this pipeline integrates homology information derived from proteins sets of other microalgae from the mamiellophyceae family; bathycoccus prasinos rcc <dig> , micromonas pusilla rcc <dig> and ccmp1545
 <cit> , ostreococcus lucimarinus
 <cit> , ests and full-length transcripts from ostreococcus tauri that could be collected from ncbi, and all junctions present from mapping the present rnaseq dataset. given the high density of the gene content in o. tauri, no rnaseq assembly was performed aiming at obtaining additional  transcripts. a trial-assembly of the rnaseq resulted in too many concatenated transcripts due to overlapping utrs. a final thorough manually curation of the predicted gene models was performed by the authors using the orcae interface
 <cit> .

RESULTS
de novoassemblies of o. tauri’sgenome
we generated de novo assemblies of the o. tauri genome using  <dig> million paired-end 76 bp illumina reads from the ot- <dig> strain. the three different assembly algorithms produced between  <dig> to  <dig> scaffolds, with a weighted median size length  of  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp . the total assembly size varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb and corresponds to  <dig> to 96% of the complete genbank reference genome sequence. among the three assemblies, abyss and clcbio produced assemblies with better contiguity; they had fewer scaffolds  with greater n <dig>  and both covered 96% of the genbank reference genome sequence. abyss produced the longest assembly of  <dig>  mb, closest to the expected o. tauri genome size. the alignment of the de novo assembly generated by abyss on to the o. tauri reference genome sequence is presented in figure

the coding sequence representation in these assemblies, measured as the percentage of coding sequence base pairs in the original assembly that align against a de novo scaffold is  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>   . this is significantly higher than that observed for intergenic regions . the number of cds included from start to stop codon within a scaffold was  <dig>  for velvet,  <dig>  for abyss and  <dig>  for clcbio.

to estimate the impact of sequencing depth on reference genome coverage and de novo assembly, we randomly sampled paired-end reads from our dataset to produce seven subsets corresponding to a  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> fold sequencing depth. the different sampled paired-end reads sets were aligned against the reference genome using bwa and reassembled de novo. the obtained scaffolds were aligned against the reference genome using nucmer. figure 
 <dig> shows the relationship between raw reads and scaffolds genome coverage, and sequencing depth. coverage changed from  <dig> % to  <dig> % when the sequencing depth decreased from 250x to 10x. it decreased more dramatically for de novo assembly, from 95% for sequencing depth greater or equal to 80x, down to 69% for a sequencing depth of 10x. this suggests that  <dig> fold sequencing depth is optimal for de novo genome assembly with this approach.figure  <dig>

improving a historical genome sequence
the reference genome contained  <dig> gaps, of which  <dig> could be resolved using de novo assembly and  <dig> could be further resolved by image
 <cit> . in depth analysis of the remaining reads using crac identified  <dig> adjacent contigs linked by paired reads, of which  <dig> could be fixed, while two indicated clear assembly errors in the reference genome. these errors consisted of two inversions in the reference assembly. fixing these two inversions closed  <dig> additional gaps. additional  <dig> gaps were filled by pcr sequencing effort. the analysis of the alignment of the raw reads onto the updated genome sequence confirmed that the  <dig> still remaining gaps could not be joined by paired-end reads, as expected if they correspond to regions larger than 100 bp, or if the illumina library did not contain the corresponding sequence. the  <dig> remaining gaps have a random distribution across the chromosomes . the updated genome sequence is thus  <dig> , <dig> nucleotides long,  <dig>  kb longer than the historical reference genome sequence
 <cit> . alignment of paired-end reads against the reference genome sequence enabled  <dig> single nucleotides and  <dig> indel differences to be identified and corrected in the updated genome sequence.

genome evolution between  <dig> and 2009
comparison of the ot- <dig> and ot- <dig> datasets enabled us to identify  <dig> nucleotide substitutions,  <dig> deletions and  <dig> insertion that had occurred in this strain between the  <dig> and  <dig> cultures . all except the insertion were confirmed by independent sanger sequencing on the ot- <dig> dna and the ot- <dig> dna. the predicted insertion in the first 145 bp of chromosome  <dig> could not be amplified because of its proximity to the telomere ccctaaa repeats. one substitution is synonymous,  <dig> are non-synonymous and one corresponds to a nonsense mutation . in total, two substitutions result in the introduction of a stop codon in a coding sequence . this may lead to a gene knockout, or alternatively, cause a shorter protein by initiation of translation from a downstream methionine . for both genes, the entire genomic region is covered by rnaseq data.

the analysis of read coverage over 50 bp windows along the chromosomes led to the identification of two large duplicated regions encompassing 80 kb on chromosome  <dig> and 30 kb on chromosome  <dig> . local peaks on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> correspond to the region containing the rrna operon  and a single gene with unknown function, ostta18g <dig> . using coverage to estimate the number of gene copies, we predicted that there are  <dig> copies of the ribosomal gene « operon » and  <dig> copies of the ostta18g <dig> gene. however, there is no evidence for copy number variations between  <dig> and  <dig> as no coverage variations have been identified between ot- <dig> and ot- <dig> table  <dig>

discussion
there have been several concerns about the sequence quality of de novo assembled genomes using next generation sequencing technology
 <cit> . here we use the compact 13 mb genome of a haploid eukaryote to assess the quality of de novo illumina pe genome sequences generated with three widely used assemblers. velvet, abyss and clcbio show moderate differences in contiguity and quality, providing a genome sequence fragmented into  <dig> to  <dig> scaffolds of a median length from  <dig> to 14550 bp . random sampling of paired-ends reads enabled us to estimate that a 80-fold coverage is required to obtain an assembly of 95% of the complete genome sequence . the assemblies had low levels of mis-assembly with values per scaffolds ranging from  <dig> %  to under  <dig> % . these values are close to the lower mis-assembly values obtained in other species .

which sequences are lacking in the de novogenome assembly and in the reference genome sequence?
the comparison of the de novo assemblies with the reference genome enabled us to investigate the features of sequences absent from the de novo assemblies. these sequences tend to contain significantly more intergenic regions. this is in line with previous studies showing an increased coverage in exons
 <cit> . this may be due to the higher proportion of low complexity sequences in intergenic regions, as these produce assembly forks that stop the contig elongation in the assembler
 <cit> . another assembly-independent reason is the lack of reads in the library for these regions. the genome sequence with no read coverage had an average gc content of 80%, consistent with an underrepresentation of extreme gc sequences in illumina sequencing data
 <cit> . reciprocally, de novo assemblies closed  <dig> gaps  in the historical genome sequence, these resolved gaps had an average length of 386 bp.

genome evolution under laboratory conditions between  <dig> and 2009
o. tauri was isolated in  <dig> from the thau lagoon in the nw mediterranean sea and conserved in the lab since. when introduced into the lab, organisms may evolve as a consequence of selection for better growth and as a consequence of the loss of selective pressures that are present in the wild
 <cit> . in this study, the comparison of the dnaseq data from  <dig> and  <dig> gave us an insight into the genome evolution of a lab-adapted strain. there is no evidence for copy number variations and our analysis revealed  <dig> substitutions,  <dig> deletions and possibly one insertion, suggesting a high level of genome stability within this timeframe, which corresponds to approximately  <dig> generations. these substitutions occur within  <dig> protein coding genes and one intergenic region . interestingly,  <dig> substitutions and one deletion occurred in the same gene  annotated as a membrane receptor related to the glutamate-like receptor gene family . glr are homologs of mammalian ionotropic glutamate receptors, glutamate-activated ion channels involved in rapid synaptic transmission. their initial discovery in arabidopsis thaliana raised intriguing questions about the physiological functions of neurotransmitter-gated channels in plants and provided an insight into why plants make chemicals that act on human brain
 <cit> . the function and ligand of plant glr is an intense area of research  and they are hypothesized to be potential amino acid sensors. the deletion induced a frameshift and splits the gene into one  <dig> aa and one  <dig> aa open reading frames, thus shortening one of the ligand fixation regions predicted to be outside the cell . in the second gene annotated as a membrane protein , the open reading frame was shortened from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids. high throughput transcript analysis in s. cerevisiae suggests that 60% of genes have transcript isoforms, with several cases of downstream methionine initiation
 <cit> . while we do not know the extent of transcriptional heterogeneity from isoform profiling in o. tauri, the substitutions we report here may have been either compensated by the initiation of the gene from a downstream methionine or may have caused a knock out of this gene. while ot06g <dig> has homologous genes in the two other ostreococcus spp. genomes sequenced, the orthologous gene family of ot12g <dig> does not include any gene from the species o. lucimarinus, suggesting that this gene is dispensable if knocked out. subculturing produces a bottleneck of  <dig>  <dig> cells per subculture, a population size that should be sufficiently large to prevent the fixation of deleterious mutations as a consequence of drift, suggesting that these substitutions between the strains are either neutral or advantageous in the lab environment. kvitek and sherlock
 <cit>  have tracked mutations in one strain of s. cerevisiae evolving in a constant environment and provided evidence that many of the mutations led to the loss of signalling pathways that usually sense a changing environment. when these mutant cells were faced with uncertain environments, the mutations proved to be deleterious. consistent with this, the knock-out of two transmembrane genes may lead to altered perception of environmental signals, but this is difficult to test experimentally without knowledge of the signalling pathways that might be affected.

CONCLUSIONS
although the de novo assemblies are fragmented in nature, we show that less than 5% of the genome is lacking from any de novo assembly. we took advantage of this data to improve the reference genome sequence of this model marine alga significantly and we show that only  <dig> substitutions have occurred within  <dig> generations of lab culture.
