BACKGROUND
phylogeographical patterns of marine faunas are complex and affected by multiple biotic and abiotic factors, and it is in the long-term interest of marine ecologists to understand the roles of these factors in determining the distribution and genetic structuring of species. glacial-interglacial climate fluctuations during the pleistocene led to changes of sea level  <cit>  and then caused habitat contractions or expansions  <cit> , which impeded gene flow of marine species and resulted in genetic divergence. following the glacial retreat, demographic expansion occurred in most marine taxa  <cit> . postglacial exchanges of propagules may erase the signals of historic isolation. accordingly, the biology of the species , availability of suitable habitat and ocean current regimes, which determine the contemporary level of gene flow, would significantly contribute to promote, maintain or homogenize the genetic divergence created by glacial periods. suitable habitat is assumed to have a significant impact on the phylogeographical distribution of coastal species  .

the impacts of ocean currents on larval dispersal are variable. sometimes oceanic currents can promote larval dispersal and enrich population connectivity . however, converging ocean currents may also pose a potential barrier to gene flow to some extents  <cit> . additionally, a river outflow carrying large amount of sediments and freshwater discharge can influence physical and chemical characteristics  of estuarine and coastal water, which control the biotic dynamics in estuary and coastal ecosystems  <cit> . this has significant impacts on the dispersal of marine taxa .

the marginal seas in the northwestern pacific have changed dramatically in area and configuration, particularly during the pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles  <cit> . three of the marginal seas, namely the south china sea , the yellow sea  plus the east china sea , and the sea of japan , served as three independent glacial refugia and resulted in vicariant divergence in marine fauna . on the other hand, the lack of genetic structuring in some sympatrically distributed taxa was attributed to their postglacial colonization of these regions  <cit> . yet, these hypotheses were not rigorously tested using comprehensive phylogenetic data because most of the studies performed in the region were based on a single marker  and largely biased to commercial species, of which the effect of anthropogenic introduction for aquaculture purposes was unknown. hence, additional investigation using both mitochondrial and nuclear markers was advocated  <cit> .

the yangtze river represents another critical factor in the gene flow of coastal species in china. the yangtze river, the fifth largest river in the world in terms of volume discharge, brings huge amounts of water  into the east china sea annually  <cit> . when the freshwater discharge reaches its maximum in spring and summer, yangtze river plume can extend eastward or northeastward to the jeju island   <cit> , and it can dramatically change surrounding ocean currents  <cit>  and salinity of the upper layer of the kuroshio current  <cit>  . moreover, sediment discharges from the yangtze and other nearby rivers have formed the yangtze river delta with an area of more than 3 × 104 km <dig>  <cit> . the ~600 km long coastline from lianyungang, jiangsu province  to shaoxing, zhejiang province  is mainly salt marsh  <cit> . this together with the yangtze river discharge is assumed to form a contemporary dispersal barrier for marine species that require a hard substratum  or with larvae that cannot tolerant decreased salinity, including the gastropod cellana toreuma  <cit> , the bivalve cyclina sinensis  <cit>  and the macroalga sargassum hemiphyllum  <cit> . however, studies on other coastal fauna did not detect any genetic split across the yangtze river  <cit> . therefore, more comprehensive study is required to test for the influence of this barrier.fig.  <dig> maps of the coastal currents and sea surface salinity of the yangtze river estuary . a in winter, the china coastal current  flows from north to south along the china coast. b in spring and summer, the  flows northward into east china sea  and turns eastward parallel with the taiwan warm current. 1: china coastal current; 2: yellow sea warm current; 3: tsushima warm current; 4: kuroshio current; 5: taiwan warm current; 6: south china sea warm current. inset: sea surface salinity of the yangtze river estuary in winter  and summer   <cit> 



to detect causations  of phylogeographic break of intertidal and subtidal rocky shore communities, a multi-species genetic analysis of several intertidal and subtidal species along the chinese coast was performed. we combined new sequences with previously published sequences from the chinese coast to construct a database of mitochondrial and nuclear dna from four species, including three rocky-shore species  and one muddy-shore species . these species possess different habitat preferences, reproductive seasons and breeding modes , which provide insights into the responses of intertidal and subtidal species to multi-factors.table  <dig> summary of life history features of four intertidal and subtidal species. the life history features include period of spawning, larval type and larval duration for four intertidal species

dong et al.  <cit>  had suggested that the two populations of c. toreuma from ys have significant higher haplotype and nucleotide diversity as compared to the populations from ecs and scs. re-analysis of published data of s. horneri revealed that the difference between populations from ys and populations from ecs/scs was significant in nucleotide diversity , but not in haplotype diversity . for a. pectinata, however, there were no significant difference between populations from ys and populations from ecs in both haplotype diversity and nucleotide diversity.

the global Φst analysis of mtdna and nuclear dna in s. japonica exhibited values of Φst significantly different from zero , indicating a significant spatial genetic structure. pairwise Φst analysis of coi and its sequences among locations showed that significant genetic differentiation  between locations from the ys and locations from the ecs and scs . pairwise Φst values were also calculated among different groups. the ys group was significantly different from the ecs group and the scs group, and the difference between the ecs group and the scs group was low and non-significant , which is similar to the results obtained from c. toreuma  <cit> .table  <dig> pairwise genetic distances  among locations of siphonaria japonica. pairwise Φst values for nuclear sequence its and mitochondrial sequence coi of siphonaria japonica are given in the upper and lower diagonals, respectively. *p <  <dig> ; **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig>

one-group amova indicated that the genetic variation among all samples was negative and insignificant in a. pectinata , but positive and significant in c. toreuma and s. horneri . at location level, re-analysis of pairwise Φst showed that there were no significant differences between all eight locations in a. pectinata . however, there existed significant difference between locations from ys and locations from the ecs and scs   in s. horneri. at group level, the ys group was significantly different from the ecs group and the scs group and the difference between the ecs group and the scs group was low and non-significant in s. horneri . however, there was no significant difference between the ys group and the ecs group for a. pectinata .

under the grouping criteria mentioned above, amova analysis for coi of c. toreuma showed that there were significant genetic variations among groups  and within locations  . amova analysis for coiii of s. horneri showed significantly high variations among locations within groups  and variation within locations . the variance among groups was relatively low and insignificant . for coi sequences of a. pectinata, variance components at all three levels were non-significant .

the haplotype networks of other three species  showed a pattern which did not exhibit obvious subdivision according to geographical locations .

demographic analysis

mismatch distribution analysis showed a unimodal distribution for both northern group and southern group of coi in s. japonica, suggesting rapid demographic expansion . the tau value  can provide a rough estimation of the time when rapid population expansion began. using a substitution rate of 1 % per million years  <cit> , the time of demographic expansion for northern group and southern group was estimated as ~440 ka  bp and ~190 ka  bp, respectively . the bsps indicated that the northern group had a slightly increase of population size since 475 ka bp, but the most distinct demographic expansion happened around 200 ka bp . the southern group exhibited a gentle growth in population size from ~225 ka bp , when the earth was at an interglacial stage . the inconsistent estimates of demographic expansion could be the difference between modeling an expansion with pairwise differences in the mismatch distribution analysis versus the coalescent theory in the bsp analysis.fig.  <dig> mismatch distributions of the observed haplotypes for each species. the histograms are the observed frequencies of pairwise divergences and the line refers to the expectation under the sudden population expansion model. all coi sequences of s. japonica were divided into two putative groups: northern group and southern group, according to the phylogenetic analyses . reference: cellana toreuma, dong et al.  <cit> ; sargassum horneri, hu et al.  <cit> ; atrina pectinata, liu et al.  <cit>

a posterior simulation-based analogue of akaike’s information reiteration through mcmc  test for northern group revealed that the expansion model favored over the other two models , and the bsp showed a demographic expansion. the constant size model was the best-fitting demographic model for southern group  which exhibited a similar pattern to the bsp.

although mitochondrial sequences in both c. toreuma and s. horneri showed a significant value of Φst, we reconstructed their demographic history with mismatch distribution and bsp because, no spatial subdivision of haplotypes of mitochondrial sequence existed in the network . the bsp analysis showed that the population size of c. toreuma had an extremely gentle increase since 260 ka bp , and the population size of s. horneri experienced a very slow increase since 194 ka bp with the mutation rate of  <dig>  % my− <dig> . the population size of a. pectinata increased significantly since 232 ka bp with the mutation rate of  <dig>  % my− <dig> . mismatch distribution analysis showed that the shapes of mismatch distribution were unimodal  and the time of demographic expansion for c. toreuma, s. horneri and a. pectinata were  <dig>  ka  bp,  <dig>  ka  bp and  <dig>  ka  bp respectively . therefore, the demographic expansion of the two groups of s. japonica and other three species significantly predated the last glacial maxima .

aicm tests for c. toreuma and s. horneri showed that the constant size model was a better fit to the data than the bsp and expansion models . it was not surprising for these two rocky-shore specie as they both showed relatively flat bsps. the expansion model was strongly favored for a. pectinata that showed a significant demographic expansion in bsp.

gene flow
siphonaria japonica
because the present study mainly focused on the gene flow across the yangtze river estuary, locations of each species were divided into ys group and escs group to detect the possible phylogeographical break. in the present studies of s. japonica, contrasting patters of gene flow between mitochondrial and nuclear markers were suggested . for the mitochondrial sequences, there is southward gene flow from ys to escs  =  <dig> - <dig> ), but little gene flow northwards from escs to ys  =  <dig> - <dig> ). the its analyses, however, indicated there was almost no gene flow in a southward direction from ys to escs  =  <dig> - <dig> ), compared with a high gene flow from escs to ys  =  <dig> - <dig> ).

re-analysis of published data showed that significant higher southward gene flow could be observed in c. toreuma  =  <dig> - <dig> , fig. 2c) and a. pectinata  =  <dig> - <dig> , fig. 2e). on the contrary, there is almost no gene flow in a southward direction  =  <dig> - <dig> , fig. 2d) in s. horneri, while large gene flow can be observed from escs to ys  =  <dig> - <dig> ).

discussion
phylogeography in intertidal and subtidal species along the china coast: northern and southern differentiation
significant population differentiation existed among northern  and southern groups  of siphonaria japonica, cellana toreuma and sargassum horneri respectively, indicating that there is a genetic break between northern and southern populations of rocky-shore species. for mitochondrial and nuclear sequences of s. japonica, pairwise Φst analyses among different locations indicated that yellow sea locations were significantly different from locations from the east china sea and the south china sea . when these locations were divided into three groups  based on their geographic locations, the Φst values between the ys group and the other two groups  were significant for limpet s. japonica and macroalga s. horneri. this result is similar to results for the limpet c. toreuma, and suggests that the yellow sea group is relatively isolated from the other two groups. amova analyses for coi and its of s. japonica and for coi of c. toreuma showed that genetic differentiation among ys and escs groups accounted for a high proportion of the molecular variance among groups , which suggested that populations were mainly grouped according to the yangtze river estuary. phylogenetic analysis showed that two putative groups existed in coi of s. japonica, which also demonstrated a genetic break around the yangtze river estuary. a geographic genetic break can also be detected by changes in gene diversity between populations. significant difference in genetic diversity between locations from ys and locations from ecs/scs for these three rocky-shore species supported the suggestion that a genetic break existed between ys and ecs/scs groups.

in contrast to the rocky-shore species, no obvious population structure for the muddy-shore species  was found based on the results from amova analysis and pairwise Φst values. the absence of genetic difference between ys and ecs groups as detected for the muddy-shore species was similar to previous studies of rapana venosa  <cit> , tegillarca granosa  <cit>  and cyclina sinensis  <cit> .

during the pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles, areas and configurations of the marginal seas have changed dramatically in the west pacific  <cit> . when the sea level fell about 120-140 m over the past ~  <dig> kyr  <cit> , the yellow sea  and the east china sea  were reduced to an elongated trough, the okinawa trough, and the south china sea  became a semi-enclosed gulf  <cit> . ecs and scs were separated by a land bridge which connected taiwan and the continent  <cit> . previous comparative phylogeographical studies in marginal seas of the northwestern pacific have suggested that historical isolation between scs and ecs plays important roles for the present-day distribution of genetic variation of coastal species such as some fishes, crustaceans and muddy/sandy shore mollusks  <cit> .

multi-factors controlling the population genetic differentiation of rocky-shore species
the contrasting phylogeographical patterns between rocky and muddy intertidal species indicates that substrate plays important roles in the phylogeographical patterns of intertidal species. from lianyungang, jiangsu province to shaoxing, zhejiang province, the absence of appropriate habitats  could hamper the settlement of rocky intertidal species and consequently genetic exchange between yellow sea and east china sea populations. the negative impacts of a lack of appropriate substrate on genetic connectivity have been reported in other intertidal fauna. for instance, the existence of long stretches of sandy beach serves as a barrier to dispersal between cape st lucia and zinkwazi beach in the limpet s. nigerrima in southeast africa  <cit> . recently, a genetic analysis of s. japonica specimens collected from yangguang island , an artificial island between zhoushan  and lianyungang , was carried out and revealed that this location is genetically similar to the location in zhoushan. these results indicate that colonization of some rocky intertidal species can happen across the barrier if suitable habitat is provided . in contrast, as seen above, the species living in muddy substrate appear unaffected by the salt marsh around at the yangtze river estuary.

freshwater discharge influences hydrological condition nearby estuary and may have some impacts on gene flow between the yellow sea and east china sea. during spring and early summer, the spawning season of s. japonica, the taiwan warm current  and the china coast current  in ecs and scs flowing northward  <cit>  transport pelagic larvae from scs to ecs. however, the freshwater discharge from the yangtze river will cause deflection of the east china sea coastal current. the size and distance of deflection is more prominent in spring and summer due to the increased amount of surface runoff in the rainy season  <cit> . in spring and summer, the plume of water from the yangtze river discharge shifts in a northerly direction in parallel with the twc with a clockwise deflection . when it reaches its maximum flow, the yangtze river discharge affects surrounding hydrological conditions  <cit>  and causes a decline in the salinity of the upper layer of the kuroshio current  <cit> , which could influence the northward transport of larvae into the yellow sea. dong et al.  <cit>  also suggested that unique haplotype and higher genetic diversity in ys group were mainly contributed to the ocean current and freshwater discharge during the spawning season of c. toreuma. the impact of freshwater discharge on the phylogenetic distribution of marine species has been widely observed in previous studies. for example, the outflow from the amazon river has been invoked as a major factor for the biogeographic break between brazilian and caribbean faunas .

although the same phylogeographic break around the yangtze river estuary was observed for two rocky intertidal limpets , haplotype networks of these two limpets were different. the haplotype network of c. toreuma is a single star-like network  <cit>  and s. japonica presents a relatively complex network with two putative groups . c. toreuma lays its eggs into sea water directly and the length of the pelagic larval stage varies between 4– <dig> days in congenerics  <cit> . s. japonica deposits gelatinous egg ribbons containing numerous small eggs on the rocky shore, and then the eggs develop into planktotrophic veliger larvae within ~15 days. the veliger larvae of s. japonica could at least maintain in the plankton about seven days . therefore, the discrepancy of phylogeographic patterns between s. japonica and c. toreuma could be associated with their different reproductive modes and larval dispersal capabilities. the high dispersal capability of the brown macroalga s. horneri could be partly attributed to low variance among groups based on the amova analysis. s. horneri can breed by both sexual reproduction and asexual reproduction, and can form floating mats which can drift about 1–5 months after being detached from the substratum .

historical demography of intertidal and subtidal species along the china coast
even though the expansion model and the constant size model received strong support over the bsp for the putative northern and southern groups in s. japonica, respectively, evidences from the mismatch distribution analysis and the bsp suggested northern group and southern group had different timings of population expansion events. the expansion time of northern group  was earlier than that of southern group . this corroborates recent evidence of the existence of a northern refugium in the northwestern pacific observed in other marine organisms . in northwestern pacific, south china sea  and east china sea  are widely accepted as southern glacial refugia . thus, new evidences of the existence of a northern refugium in this area may be helpful to illustrate the influence both of past populations in glacial refugia and of contemporary gene flow in shaping current phylogeographical patterns in the future studies. furthermore, the population sizes of these four species were persistent through the last glacial maximum . recent meta-analyses of demographic history of intertidal rocky organisms in the northeastern pacific  <cit>  and northwestern pacific  <cit>  also converged on similar finding that majority of the species were not extirpated entirely by the lgm and regional persistence maybe more prevalent.

at the contemporary level, migrate analyses revealed that migration rates were unbalanced between escs and ys groups of s. japonica. however, the inferred direction of gene flow using alternatively mitochondrial or nuclear markers was contradictory. coi analyses suggested that southward migration rate was almost ten times the northward migration rate. its sequences suggested the northward migration rate was significantly higher . discordances between nuclear and mitochondrial data in animal biogeographic studies are not uncommonly reported  <cit> . adaptive introgression, demographic disparity and sex biased migration are commonly invoked as potential explanation of discordance observed  <cit> . sex biased gene flow appears unlikely for this hermaphroditic limpet with planktonic larvae transported by ocean current while adaptive introgression is difficult to test based on the present data. the mitochondrial genes have a higher mutation rates and smaller effective population size than the nuclear genes, and hence considered to be more informative in shallow relationships. besides, the high imbalance between immigration and emigration rates in other three species  could be associated with historical refugia and suggested the likely existence of sources and sinks at metapopulation level. recent studies emphasize the need of multi-locus data for accurate estimation of various population parameters  <cit> . as a result, more data are required to determine the underlying mechanism leading to the discordance, and our results emphasize the importance of employing multi-locus data in biogeographic study.

biogeography of intertidal species in china
the phylogeographic barrier of rocky intertidal species around yangtze river estuary will possibly disappear under the coupled impacts of climate change and human activities. firstly, northward shift of rocky intertidal species is ubiquitous in the scenario of climate change . the coastal sea surface temperature  and extreme hot days have continued to increase from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . the increasing temperature will potentially force the northward shift of intertidal species along china coast; secondly, land reclamation has resulted in about 55 % loss of coastal wetland in china from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> , and large numbers of artificial structures provide hard substrates in areas where these are generally absent and act as stepping stones to connect the yellow sea populations and east china sea/south china sea populations; finally, about  <dig>  dams constructed in the yangtze river catchment from the late  <dig> to  <dig> have a storage capacity of 22 % of the annual water discharge  and result in a strong decrease of sediment and freshwater discharge in spring and summer  <cit> . the changing hydrological condition around the yangtze river estuary could enhance the possibility of larval dispersal across it. overall, the potential northward shift of rocky intertidal species will change the biogeographic pattern along the chinese coast and adaptive management should be considered for future management of rocky intertidal ecosystem in china.

CONCLUSIONS
a significant phylogeographic break, occurring around the yangtze river estuary, was observed for populations of rocky-shore species along the china coast. substrate, ocean current and freshwater discharge are suggested as major factors determining the contemporary structure of rocky-shore species by limiting north–south dispersal of planktonic larvae. in addition, historical events and life history characteristics can also influence the contemporary phylogeographic distribution of intertidal and subtidal species. however, human activities are changing the habitat of intertidal species. large-scale land reclamation activities can change the sedimentary substrate, and so provide suitable hard substrates for colonization by rocky-shore species. on the other hand, numerous dams constructed in the yangtze river catchment decrease the riverine sediment supply to the sea and will impact on the environment of the yangtze delta and the nearby coastal ocean.
