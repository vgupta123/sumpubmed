BACKGROUND
lactic acid bacteria  have been used for centuries in industrial and artisanal food and feed fermentations as starter cultures and are important bacteria linked to the human gastro-intestinal  tract  <cit> . phylogenetically they form a relatively compact group of mainly gram-positive, anaerobic, non-sporulating, low g+c content acid-tolerant bacteria  <cit> . the genera that comprise the lab belong to the order lactobacillales, and are primarily lactobacillus, pediococcus, lactococcus, streptococcus and  leuconostoc, while some peripheral genera are enterococcus, oenococcus, aerococcus, and carnobacterium. interestingly, even within such a compact group, vastly divergent phenotypes have been reported, providing indications of high flexibility and adaptation of these species to their living environments  <cit> .

extracellular and surface-associated proteins play a most important role in many essential interactions and adaptations of lab to their environment  <cit> . by definition these proteins are either exposed on  or released  from the bacterial cell surface. on a genome scale these proteins form a subset of the proteome which contains both the exoproteome  <cit>  and part of the surface proteome  <cit> , but excluding the integral membrane proteins  and the proteins that are intrinsic to internal side of plasma membrane . this subset of the proteome belongs to what desvaux et.al have defined as "secretome"  <cit>  and is known to mainly be involved processes such as:  recognition, binding, degradation and uptake of extracellular complex nutrients,  signal transduction,  communication with the environment and  attachment of the bacterial cell to specific sites or surfaces, e.g. to intestinal mucosa cells of the host  <cit> . hence, genome-scale comparative analysis of these secretome  proteins may provide an understanding of the molecular function, evolution, and diversity of different lab species and their adaptation to different environments.

here we report a comparison of the predicted secretomes of  <dig> sequenced genomes of lab representing  <dig> different species . the secretome clusters of orthologous protein families  were extracted by combining homology clustering methods with protein subcellular location  prediction. the comparative analysis of lacogs shows many niche-specific protein families that can be used as leads for future experiments.

RESULTS
construction of the secretome protein clusters 
in this study we focus on those proteins that are predicted to be wholly or largely on the outside of the cell, regardless of the translocation systems. these proteins form a sub-proteome of what desvaux et.al defined as the "secretome"  <cit>  by excluding the translocation systems, the integral membrane proteins, and non-protein products. although we adapt this term "secretome" to describe our protein subset of interest, we must specify that in our analysis the term "secretome" refers to only the proteins that are released from the cells to the extracellular milieu , and the proteins that remain cell-surface associated, but nothing else.

ideally, a comparative secretome analysis should be performed on the experimentally validated sub-proteomes or on in silico predicted secretome proteins with the highest possible accuracies. however, it is well-known that wet-lab proteomic studies are extremely costly and can lead to many false predictions of subcellular location, while all the currently available in silico protein scl predictors have only 80%-93% prediction accuracy  <cit> . therefore, instead of clustering predicted extracellular proteins directly, we designed an alternative process which firstly groups all proteins in the sequenced lab genomes into ortholog groups  and afterwards extracts the secretome groups by using genome-scale scl predictions . in this way, the wrongly predicted secretome proteins could be reduced because homologous proteins with similar functions and domains always tend to have the same scl, and vice versa  <cit> .

the lactobacillales-specific clusters of orthologous groups of proteins  previously generated by makarova et.al  <cit>  were used as the basis for protein clustering into protein families. in total  <dig>  lacogs were formed by adding  <dig> recently sequenced lab genomes to the makarova et. al. set. subsequently, a genome-scale scl prediction was performed on all proteins in the  <dig> genomes . by combining the scl prediction and lacogs, and after manual curation , we defined  <dig> secretome lacogs  composed of  <dig> proteins, representing  <dig> % of the complete genome dataset and 93% of all predicted secretome proteins in these  <dig> genomes. we defined thirteen general functional classes for these proteins, and the distribution of these clustered secretome proteins over the classes and lacogs is shown in figure  <dig>  an additional  <dig> putative secretome proteins could not be grouped into these lacogs, comprising  <dig> proteins that had only a distant homolog in non-lab, and  <dig> proteins that had no homolog in any sequenced bacterial genomes, which we termed the extracellular "orfans" .

although the lab genomes vary in size, the size of the secretome as a fraction of each genome was fairly consistent , as well as the distribution of proteins over different scls. the n-terminally anchored proteins with no signal peptidase cleavage site are the most abundant kind among all predicted secretome proteins. a striking feature of numerous secretome proteins, and particularly surface-associated proteins, is that they are large and consist of many different domains , and domain compositions . in fact, this variation in domain composition has been used in constructing and sub-dividing the lacogs and separating sub-families of homologous proteins. distinct combinations of domains provide hints for functions of these extracellular proteins in cell-wall metabolism, cell-wall binding and their communication with the environment .

false predictions and pseudogenes
the preliminary secretome clusters were curated manually and corrected based on expert knowledge, e.g. for false-positive and false-negative predictions, incorrect gene starts, pseudogenes, etc. examples of proteins of known intracellular function, but with consistent false-positive extracellular scl prediction are listed in additional file  <dig>  sheet s <dig>  in most cases the mis-prediction was caused by an Î±-helix-like n-terminal sequence in these proteins , leading to the prediction as a signal peptide by locatep. a further improvement was made by finding and removing those lacogs that have proteins which are anchored in the cell membrane with a single n-terminal transmembrane helix, but with the rest of the protein inside the cell   <cit> . by aligning proteins within these lacogs we found that these proteins do not have positively charged residues preceding the n-terminal hydrophobic helix, but exclusively have a positively charged residue immediately downstream of the transmembrane helix . hence such features could be used for further development of a model for scl prediction of n-terminally anchored proteins by locatep.

nearly  <dig> pseudogenes were identified, but this is probably an underestimate. in most cases this was due to gene frameshifts, and occasionally to n- or c-terminal truncation of genes. most of these genes could be concatenated to encode larger proteins with high similarity to known proteins in the lacogs. many of these pseudogenes were initially predicted to encode intracellular proteins by locatep, but after concatenation these proteins are predicted to be extracellular and/or contain domains of extracellular functionalities. an example are the proteins encoded by adjacent genes lsa <dig> and lsa <dig> in l.sakei 23k which were annotated as hypothetical proteins. the concatenated protein showed high similarity to proteins in lacog <dig> which were exclusively cell-surface protein csc complex family members  <cit> . in total  <dig> concatenated pseudoproteins were made with  <dig> protein fragments , while  <dig> pseudogenes could not be combined .

the lab-secretome database
the lab-secretome database http://www.cmbi.ru.nl/lab_secretome was constructed to store and browse all the predicted extracellular proteins and lacogs. an overview page summarizes all predicted secretomes, lacogs, distant homologs in non-lab species and the orfans, with hyperlinks to the corresponding html pages to help users to browse the whole database . the lab-secretome database can be queried in many ways, e.g. by bacterial species, protein subcellular location, protein accession identifiers, lacog numbers, protein functional classes, and pfam domain accession codes or domain functions . visualization includes a description of lacog members and function, protein functional domain composition, and multiple alignments with notification of corrected start codons, pseudogenes and concatenated proteins . a blast function, utilizing the blastp  <cit>  program, enables users to query the clustering information of their proteins of interest to the extracellular proteins and families that are already in the database . an automatic updating scheme for the lacogs  was designed to ensure that the need for manual curation is minimized when adding new bacterial genomes to the database.

overview of the extracellular protein families
ubiquitous/essential lacogs
only  <dig> lacogs were found to be fully conserved among all  <dig> lab secretomes, or only lacking in  <dig> genome , e.g. the absence of an atp-dependent protease from lacog <dig> in p. pentosaceus .

most of these lacogs contain proteins with universal functionalities involved in cell-wall metabolism, secretion, transport and dna uptake . only one conserved family  contains proteins of as yet unknown function, but presumably essential as they are conserved in all genomes.

most common functionalities in the secretomes of lab
among all  <dig> secretome lacogs with known or presumed functions, almost half of them contain proteins which are involved in cell-wall metabolism, e.g. the muramidase, lysin, lysozyme and beta-lactamase families . many of these enzyme families are further subdivided into different lacogs based on variations in sequence homology and protein domain compositions, and some may represent species/niche-specific subfamilies. one example is the subdivision of proteins with an nlpc/p <dig> family domain  into  <dig> separate lacogs . these proteins vary in length from ~ <dig> to ~ <dig> amino acids, all with the nlpc/p <dig> domain in the c-terminal part. in only one of these subfamilies , all  <dig> members have 1- <dig> copies of lysm domains  in their n-terminal part, indicating extra binding functions to the cell-envelope. a similar domain architecture is found in one of the four n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase subfamilies , which has an enzymatic c-terminal domain and 0- <dig> n-terminal sh <dig> domains , known to bind to proline-rich regions of proteins. in the pepdidoglycan hydrolase subfamilies lacog <dig> and lacog <dig> the enzymatic domain is located at the n-terminus and can be followed by different kinds, combinations and numbers of binding domains such as lysm, sh <dig> or surface layer domain  . these examples all illustrate that the many types of extracellular enzymes involved in cell-wall turnover have different mechanisms to attach to components of the cell surface.

niche-specific lacog families
1/l. acidophilus complex specific
the acidophilus "complex" including the species l. acidophilus, l. johnsonii, l. gasseri, l. delbrueckii ssp bulgaricus and l. helveticus has long been regarded as a phylogenetic subgroup  <cit> . about  <dig> lacogs appear to be specific for these species . their proteins include an abc-type phosphate/phosphonate transport system , the aggregation promoting factor   <cit> , a putative competence protein  and several families of s-layer proteins, which may reflect the special binding function that these s-layer proteins generally share in these acidophilus complex species  <cit> . interestingly, twenty of these acidophilus complex-specific lacogs contain only extracellular proteins of unknown function, and it should be challenging to focus on experimental determination of their function.

2/gi-tract specific
if we consider the lab species l. acidophilus, l. johnsonii, l. gasseri, l. reuteri, and l. salivarius to be specifically found in the gi-tract, then we can identify  <dig> lacogs which are not found outside of this group, of which  <dig> families contain only proteins of unknown function . one mucus-binding protein family  was found to be specific for these gi-tract lab, and contains  <dig> proteins from l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. johnsonii. all four proteins are larger than  <dig> amino acids, contain a signal peptide with ysirk domain  and appear to be anchored to the peptidoglycan by an lpxtg cell-wall anchor . each protein has 5- <dig> copies of a mucus-binding domain, as defined by boekhorst et al  <cit> , showing their particular role in binding to mucus components in the gi-tract  <cit> . the  <dig> d structure of this domain of  <dig> residues has recently been determined and shows similarity to the functional repeat found in a family of immunoglobulin-binding proteins  <cit> .

3/plant-associated specific
twelve lacogs appear to be specific for the group of plant-associated species leuconostoc, oenococcus, l. plantarum, l. brevis, and p. pentosaceus, of which  <dig> familes contain only proteins of unknown function . one of these  includes  <dig> homologous proteins from l.brevis, l.plantarum, o.oeni and l. citreum, which show a high sequence similarity to each other, but the protein from l. plantarum has a much longer serine-rich spacer between the n- and c-terminal domains. a similar domain structure differing in a long serine-rich spacer is seen in the  <dig> hypothetical proteins from l. plantarum and l. brevis in lacog <dig> 

4/dairy lab specific
a few protein families were found only to occur in the secretomes of the dairy lab s. thermophilus, l. lactis and e. faecalis . these proteins have functional properties that may be relevant to the dairy niche, e.g. lacog <dig> contains abc transporter substrate-binding proteins for polar amino acids, and could possibly be required for growth in milk  <cit> . the l. lactis strains have a single copy of this gene, while the s. thermophilus strains all have  <dig> consecutive genes encoding paralogs of this amino acid-binding protein. all dairy streptococcus and lactococcus strains contain a single gene encoding a beta-lactamase  which may play a role in destroying penicillin that these strains may encounter in milk  <cit> . a putative chitinase  is found exclusively in e. faecalis and in l. lactis strains.

species-specific and strain-specific lacogs
up to  <dig> lacogs were found to be species-specific or strain-specific . the distinction is not so clear yet because for some species several strains were sequenced  while for many species only a single strain was sequenced to date. most of these families are made up solely of hypothetical proteins with highly conserved sequence . l. casei and l. lactis have the highest number of species-specific lacogs, indicating that they may have more unique extracellular functions. examples of species-specific extracellular proteins are the prga/prgb/prgc surface proteins of e. faecalis  <cit> , an alpha-amylase  in l. lactis strains, a phospholipase a <dig> family enzyme  in l. casei strains, a cyclo-nucleotide phosphodiesterase  in s. thermophilus strains, and a mucus-binding protein  in l. delbrueckii strains.

extracellular proteins not in lacogs: orfans and proteins with only distant homologs in non-lab
about  <dig> putative extracellular proteins could not be classified into lacog families, and comprise  <dig> proteins that have only distant homologs in non-lab species and  <dig> orfans that are species-specific . while the orfans are nearly all hypothetical proteins of unknown function, the distant homologs also contain proteins with a variety of known functions, such as extracellular enzymes , substrate-binding proteins of transporters, miscellaneous binding proteins and specific bacteriocins. the uniqueness of these proteins suggests that most species or strains have a few unique extracellular proteins that are not found in other sequenced lab, and may encode unique functions that are related to their environmental niche. quite a few of the proteins of unknown function are predicted to be lipid-anchored and therefore may represent substrate-binding proteins of uncharacterized transporters.

specific enzyme families
lab possess a variety of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes and transglycosylases which presumably relate to interactions with their environment, e.g. for degradation of growth substrate polymers. these enzymes have been clustered and sub-divided into protein families  based on specific domain compositions . for instance, the subtilisin-like serine proteases , known to be important for growth on protein substrates  <cit> , were clustered into  <dig> lacogs: the first family  is composed of  <dig> proteins containing a protease-associated pa domain  inserted in the catalytic domain which forms a lid structure that covers the active site, whereas the other family  was only found in l. casei and l. acidophilus, and contains subtilisin-like serine proteases without the pa domain. putative transglycosylases, also referred to as aggregation-promoting factors  <cit> , are divided into three subfamilies , and have a highly conserved c-terminal domain  <cit> . furthermore, there are several families of hydrolases of unknown function . the extracellular alpha/beta hydrolases with a duf <dig> domain  are subdivided into four families, two of which are highly populated  and found in nearly all lab, suggesting that they have an essential, but as yet unknown, function.

specific binding-protein families
many extracellular proteins contain known domains for binding to macromolecular substrates. in addition to domains for binding to the cell wall of the producing cell , several other domains are found which are related to binding to host macromolecules  . some of these annotations derive from in vitro binding studies and may not reflect in vivo functions. in lab, mucus-binding domains  are found in many proteins and are thought to play a role in binding to the host gi-tract mucus layer  <cit> . an enormous variety is found in the size of these mucus-binding proteins and in the number of mucus-binding domains. we have made a preliminary separation into  <dig> different subfamilies of mucus-binding proteins based on protein size, sequence homology, domain composition and phylogeny . the three largest subfamilies are  lacog <dig> containing  <dig> members from different lab but not from l. acidophilus group members,  lacog <dig> with  <dig> members, found in many lab, and  lacog <dig> which includes  <dig> proteins. the proteins of lacog <dig> contain solely the mucbp domains as defined by pfam , while the proteins of the other two lacogs possess multiple copies of the larger mub domains as defined by boekhorst et al.  <cit>  . many mucus-binding proteins of l. acidophilus group members contain an n-terminal sirkxxxgxxs-containing signal peptide  which was earlier reported as a typical characteristic of the l. acidophilus mub proteins  <cit> , and may relate to a specific function in sorting or folding  <cit> . furthermore, it is striking that many large genes encoding mucus-binding proteins are pseudogenes . while it is unlikely that these are all due to sequencing errors, it is not clear yet whether these are truly pseudogenes, or possibly may encode functional proteins after transcription with strand-slipping  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
lactic acid bacteria  occur naturally in many different fermentation environments such as plant, meat, dairy and cereal. overall similarities have been identified among the genomes of many lab species  <cit> . however, bio-diversity has also been reported frequently, showing that subtle variations in presence or absence of proteins and functional domain composition might lead to important traits during bacterial adaptation to their living environments  <cit> . our comparative research on extracellular and surface-associated protein families has provided a more solid basis for this hypothesis. universal families have been identified which are apparently essential for survival of all lab, but also species-specific protein families. besides the clustered proteins with known functions, many families of hypothetical proteins and unique proteins  were found.

protein clustering supports niche-dependent features of specific subgroups of lab  and could aid in linking bacterial phenotypes to genotypes. the distinct sub-families of the different lacogs have provided clues for adaptation of the bacterial cells to their living environment, such as the gi-tract. the result of this study can be used as leads for experimental work on the molecular evolution, diversity, function and adaptation of bacteria to specific environments.

our clustering methods and database structure were designed in a way that allows adoption to other groups of bacteria than lab. the analysis results are stored in a queryable database which provides vivid browsing functions for users, and will be updated regularly to guarantee the continuation of the service to the biology community. our clustering information into families could definitely help in checking the quality of newly sequenced genomes and for genome annotation.
