BACKGROUND
the study of the process through which pigs convert food comparatively into fat and lean tissue  has many potential applications and implications. from an agricultural perspective, pork is the primary source of meat protein worldwide  and global consumption has doubled over the last ten years . the increasing global population and the constant increase in meat consumption in developing countries, especially east and southeast asia, bring an unprecedented challenge to the pig breeding industry who are charged, in part, with feeding this growing number of people  <cit> . furthermore, market forces demand the tailoring of meats to specific populations and cultures. pig breeding companies constantly focus their efforts on either producing lean or fat animals or specifically targeted traits e.g. intramuscular fat in their products  <cit> . while fatness is inexorably linked to diet, genetic factors undoubtedly have an influence and marker assisted selection regimes, aimed at increasing or decreasing growth of fat or lean tissues selectively, require further sophistication. pork producers aim to improve genetically advanced breeding stock by improving both the food conversion ratio  and the residual feed intake of each slaughter pig, as well as producing higher yielding carcasses with significant improvement in lean meat percentage  <cit> . such sophistication could be advanced further through a deeper understanding of the genetic control of fatness.

the pig is generally considered an excellent model organism for the study of many aspects of human physiology and disease states including cancer, diabetes,  <cit>  maternal aggression  <cit>  and obesity  <cit> . obesity, excess fat accumulating in the tissues  <cit> , can lead to a variety of illnesses including coronary heart disease, stroke and cancer  <cit> . study of the role of genetic variation in the fatness of pigs therefore can have biomedical implications for the understanding and control of one of the biggest killers in the western world, through the identification of orthologous genes and their variants.

it addition to chromosomal level genomic changes, normal genetic variation at the sequence level includes insertions and deletions   <cit> , single nucleotide polymorphisms  and copy number variants . snps are the most frequent genetic variation between humans  <cit> . snps are usually biallellic and the least abundant allele ) usually occurs at in at least 1% of the population  <cit> . snps are commonly found in non-coding regions, however generally do not reside within genes  <cit> . snps act as markers linked to phenotypically relevant loci and they therefore function as powerful tools in non-hypothesis driven research  <cit> . certain snps have been causally linked with monogenic traits . examples of such traits include achondroplasia  <cit>  and sickle cell anaemia  <cit>  as well as variants located near the mc4r gene, which are known to influence fat mass, weight and risk of obesity, with mutations of this gene being a cause of monogenic severe childhood onset diabetes). it is the association of snps with polygenic and multifactorial traits however, that has received the most attention in recent years. that is, post-genomic technologies such as snp microarrays have permitted genome wide association studies  for thousands of traits in humans. such studies include research into complex diseases in humans such as breast cancer  <cit> , type  <dig> diabetes   <cit> , crohn’s disease  <cit> , parkinson’s disease  <cit> , coeliac disease  <cit>  and obesity. some examples of obesity gwas in humans include research into early onset extreme obesity. one particular study provided proof of principle for the concept that gwas are useful in detecting genes relevant to complex phenotypes. in this case a human snp array comprising of  <dig>  snps from  <dig> extremely obese young german samples and  <dig> healthy lean german controls. fifteen significant snps were determined,  <dig> of which were associated with the fto gene, suggesting that it strongly contributes to early onset obesity  <cit> . to date however, the studies of snps associated with fatness in pigs have been limited in comparison to the number of human studies  <cit> . indeed, there are few gwas in the pig in relation to phenotypic traits. popularly studied traits in the pig, apart from fatness include boar taint  <cit> , body composition and structural soundness  <cit> , however such studies are also still in their infancy; this perhaps reflects the fact that a snp microarray  for the pig has only been developed within the last 4 years. although these studies have provided much insight into the molecular biology of many traits, more are necessary in order to fill gaps in our knowledge of fatness, as it is a multifactorial, complex trait. the agricultural sector stands to benefit financially from such research and there are potentially biomedical applications if orthologous human genes can be associated with obesity, especially if gwas can be performed in a low-cost manner by means such as use of selective genotyping. selective genotyping, i.e. use of individuals at the extreme ends of a phenotypic spectrum provides an effective means of performing gwas on a large population by sampling small numbers of animals and has its theoretical basis in the early 1990s  <cit> . most recently applied to identify snps associated with back fat thickness in pigs used for italian dried ham  <cit> .

cnv regions  are segments of dna  to several megabases  in size  <cit> ) that vary in copy-number by comparison with reference genomes  <cit> . it is thought that 12% of the human genome contains cnvrs  <cit>  that are heritable in normal individuals. around  <dig> % of genome content in people who are unrelated is thought to vary in copy number  <cit> . specific algorithms for cnv detection from snp chip raw data include ‘penncnv’, ‘gada’  <cit> , ‘conan’  <cit> , ‘cnvpartition’ and ‘quantisnp’, the last  <dig> of which have been used in this study. comparative analyses of the above have suggested a preference for quantisnp  <cit> . the study of cnvs has been pioneered in humans and catalogues of human cnvs are now available  <cit> . significant associations of cnvs with human disease are numerous as cnvs are thought to be able to influence gene expression and may also play a role in affecting metabolic traits. these include susceptibility to hiv <dig>  <cit> , a role in auto immune disease and lupus glomerulonephritis  <cit> . cnvs are strongly correlated with gene, repeat and segmental duplication content  <cit>  and play a significant role in the development of complex traits. a recent study showed that  <dig> cnvs are significantly associated with the mechanisms for the control of a number of metabolic traits in mice. indeed mouse chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> all have cnvrs in regulatory regions influencing body weight  <cit> . wang et al.  <cit>  used penncnv on snp chip data in humans to study obese individuals with ‘never overweight’ controls. the authors determined that in a study of over  <dig> individuals, large cnvs and rare deletions were associated with the risk of moderate obesity  <cit> . moreover, cnvs contained candidate obesity genes including a  <dig>  mb deletion disrupting nap1l <dig>  as well as a  <dig>  mb deletion disrupting ucp <dig>  and il <dig> . such studies for the determination of cnvrs in pigs however are, to date, limited to only  <dig>  the first focussed on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in which  <dig> cnvrs were identified  <cit> , with the second identifying  <dig> cnvrs genome wide  <cit> . the third, published in  <dig>  used a sample size of  <dig> pigs, across  <dig> pure-bred lines, yorkshire, landrace and songliao black as well as a cross-bred line, duroc-erualian. penncnv was the chosen platform, with  <dig> cnvs identified, genome wide, from information from the illumina snp <dig> platform  <cit> . chen and colleagues also used penncnv to analyse porcine cnvs; they found  <dig> cnvrs containing a total of  <dig> cnvs, from  <dig> populations. hotspots for these cnvs included areas on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  with the duroc breed having the most cnvs found per individual  <cit> . a study in  <dig> using array comparative genomic hybridisation  on  <dig> pigs from several different breeds  highlighted  <dig> cnvrs  <cit> , whilst wang and colleagues used penncnv to glean cnv information from data derived from the illumina porcine snp <dig> beadchip, finding  <dig> cnvs in a total number of  <dig> pigs  <cit> .

studies in the pig have not before however, studied the effect of cnvs on specific traits, with few using quantisnp or cnvpartition.

given the above, it is clear that, despite the need to understand the genetic control of fatness in pigs, both from an agricultural and biomedical standpoint, very few genes have hitherto been associated with fatness and/or leanness in this species. the availability of the porcine 60 k snp chip  allows us to ask whether there are snps and/or cnvrs significantly associated with defined fatness phenotypes in different pig breeds. to date, we are aware of only one gwas and no cnv searches that have addressed this question. fontanesi and colleagues  <cit>  looking at a single breed and finding gene ontology terms associated with nervous system development and regulation. with this in mind, in this study, we performed a gwas using selective genotyping to sample a population of over  <dig>  animals from  <dig> breeds identifying both significant snps and extracting quantitative information from the raw data to identify also cnvs.

RESULTS
snp analysis
selective genotyping permitted the generation of statistically significant results using estimated breeding values  from animals in the upper and lower 5th percentiles. after snp chip interrogation, a total of  <dig>  snps were eliminated from the analysis from the original  <dig>  due to either the minor allele frequency  being < <dig> , snps being located on the sex chromosomes or those that deviated from hardy weinberg equilibrium .  <dig>  snps were taken further for analysis. the results shown in figure  <dig>  are the manhattan plots obtained for the  <dig> breeds. this figure displays the results from an additive model with significant snps at the 5% genome wide level;  equal to  <dig> )) . an example of a chromosome that had significant clustered snps present in chromosome  <dig>  is shown in figure  <dig>  clustering of other snps near a snp of interest reinforces its significance. for the  <dig> breeds, duroc, titan and sllw, a total of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> snps  were considered to be significant, all of these being breed specific. the most significant snps were located on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  and  <dig> and  <dig> . following gene ontology, genes that either had an association with fatness  or those that resided within a gene  are shown in table  <dig>  table  <dig> shows snps that were deemed as significant in this study, but without genes upstream or downstream that were associated with fatness. significant snps that were located either up or downstream from genes and implicated in the fatness phenotype in the duroc breed, were marc <dig> downstream from nts on chromosome  <dig> , asga <dig> upstream from fabp <dig> on chromosome  <dig> , inra <dig> upstream from sst on chromosome  <dig>  and asga <dig> upstream from nr3c <dig> located on chromosome  <dig> .  <dig> other significant snps identified in the duroc breed, resided in the genes tecta, epas <dig>  tmprss <dig>  adam <dig>  mx <dig>  hsf <dig>  mpzl <dig>  camk1d, dock <dig>  ccdc <dig>  dennd2d and tex <dig>  only  <dig> significant snp  was found to be located within an intronic region of a gene for the titan breed. this gene was spag <dig>  known to be involved in maintenance of the structural integrity of the central apparatus of the sperm axoneme. there were no genes implicated with fatness found in the titan breed. significant snps in the sllw breed were identified in  <dig> chromosomes,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  whilst there were no genes identified either up or downstream from significant snps, that could have been directly implicated with a fatness phenotype, other significant snps that resided within genes included alga <dig> in the gene tinag , inra <dig> and alga <dig> both in the gene dst  and dias <dig> in the gene glo <dig> . the only gene that had a snp located within a coding region in any of the  <dig> breeds was glo <dig>  after analysis using the ensembl variant effect predictor, the amino acid at position  <dig> displayed a synonymous substitution, with the residue leucine not being modified after the snp change. all significance levels for all snps in all breeds are depicted in figure  <dig>  it was interesting to note that the duroc breed had many more snps associated with a fatness phenotype than any of the other breeds analysed with these snps having a higher level of significance also.

table shows the position of significant snps either associated with genes implicated in a fatness phenotype  and snps within genes, discovered through the interrogation of the illumina snp <dig> beadchip. the chromosomal position, position of the snp in relation to the gene , downstream or upstream), snp code and the breed in which the gene was identified are also shown.

cnv analysis
in terms of cnv analysis,  <dig> example of the output from quantisnp is shown in figure  <dig> for titan chromosome  <dig>  all red lines on this figure depict cnvs discovered in ‘fat’  pigs and green lines depict those found in ‘lean’  pigs. in order to distinguish between levels of significance , a darker line  indicates a high log bayes factor , and therefore a higher level of significance, while a paler line indicates samples with a log bayes factor of between  <dig> and  <dig> . lines above the x-axis in the middle of the figure, indicate gains in copy number whilst lines below are losses. the chromosome position in mb is shown below the graph. the start and ends of the putative cnvs are defined on the chip and through reference to the published porcine genome sequence. the total number of cnvs detected was higher from quantisnp  than from cnvpartition . of the total  <dig> cnvs detected in  <dig> or more animals ,  <dig> were unique to quantisnp ,  <dig> were unique to cnvpartition and  <dig> were detected by both . generally, there were  <dig> times more losses found by both programs than gains. in order to determine whether regions of the genome differ in dna copy number in statistically different numbers of ‘fat’ and ‘lean’ animals, mann whitney u tests  were performed; samples with a p value of ≤ <dig>  were considered significant. the statistical results for significant cnvrs can be found in table  <dig>  that shows cnvs present in more than  <dig> animals, for both cnv detecting algorithms. the estimated copy number and the number of animals in which the cnvs were found is shown. each cnv was assigned a cnv id;  <dig> s <dig> represents a cnv on chromosome  <dig>  from the sllw breed, assigned the number  <dig>   <dig> cnvrs contained genes that their ontology suggested could play a role in fatness, shown in table  <dig>  these cnvs were  <dig> d <dig>  and  <dig> d <dig> . 98% of the cnvs overlapped coding sequence. in the sllw breed, cnvpartition results covered  <dig> % of the genome, while quantisnp determined a  <dig> % coverage. cnvpartition and quantisnp results for the duroc breed indicated genome coverage of  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively, with the percentage coverage in the titan breed being  <dig> %  and  <dig> % . the distribution of the cnvs can be found in the additional file 1: figure s <dig>  here, the positions of the cnvs are noted with respect to a standard porcine ideogram . it is depicted whether the cnvs  are losses or gains by the position, left or right of the chromosome respectively, in which breed they were observed  and in how many animals each cnv was observed . results from both quantisnp and cnvpartition are given side by side.

table shows significant cnvs  tests, present in more than  <dig> animals for both quantisnp and cnvpartition. the chromosome and start and end of each of the cnvrs, is given. the estimated copy number of the sequence and the number of animals in which each was observed is also provided. each cnv was assigned a ‘cnv id.’ for example ‘ <dig> s2’ denotes that the cnv is on chromosome  <dig>  it is from sllw breed and it has been assigned the number ‘2’. duroc and titan cnvs were assigned the letter d and t respectively.

discussion
the results presented demonstrate the applicability of selective genotyping when using a gwas approach. unlike the most recent similar study  <cit>  the breeds under investigation are ones marketed extensively worldwide and clearly display breed specific differences. for gwas data to be used in practical applications, it is essential that the snps discovered as associated with fatness and leanness  are segregating in the population in question. to this end, in any association study, the benefits must outweigh the costs; here we have provided evidence of a low-cost approach to gwas by using ebv data for animals in the upper and lower 5th percentiles. it is also essential that the relevant samples are archived and readily accessed. storage of large numbers of blood or dna samples in freezers is expensive and space consuming. here we demonstrate that amplifying dna from archived blood spots can overcome this problem. finally, we demonstrate that cnv information can be derived from the raw snp chip data, providing the opportunity for studies of dna copy number and its association with commercially and biologically relevant traits.

snp discovery and gene ontology
in the current study, we identified a total of  <dig> snps in the sllw breed,  <dig> in duroc breed and  <dig> in titan breed significantly associated with fatness or leanness as defined by ebvs for back fat. the reasons why duroc had so many more than the other two  is not clear. we are not aware that duroc is any more genetically diverse – one possible explanation is a technical one in that the chip itself was made from a duroc pig and the results may reflect ascertainment bias. snps were identified that were either contained within, or  <dig>  mb up or downstream of genes whose ontology terms strongly implicated them in a fatness phenotype as follows: nts , is involved in energy homeostasis, a complex physiological process most probably related to fatness  <cit> . genes such as nts have been shown to be involved in both central and peripheral signals affecting feed intake  <cit> . sst  was first isolated from the hypothalamus of sheep as a  <dig> amino acid peptide in  <dig>  <cit> ; sst plays a vital role in the regulation of growth and development in vertebrates, particularly muscle growth. it is known to be one of the most important genes involved in both the regulation of animal growth, metabolism and development through its negative role on growth, as it acts as an inhibitor of growth hormone release  <cit> , inhibition of cell proliferation as well as affecting nutrient absorption in the alimentary canal  <cit> . a study focussing on a polymorphism in sst and its association with growth traits in chinese cattle was published earlier this year that has been correlated with improving the establishment of meat production performance by breeding of new beef cattle  <cit> . fatty acid binding protein  <dig> , which was mapped to chromosome  <dig> in  <dig>  <cit> , was also found to be significant in the duroc population in this study. it has been shown that fabp <dig> is associated with type ii diabetes therefore suggesting an association of variants between fatness and type ii diabetes susceptibility  <cit> , as well as the role of fabps in fat absorption and in the development of metabolic syndrome  <cit> . glo <dig>  was a gene of particular interest highlighted throughout this study due to the fact that it was the only candidate gene isolated in this gwas that had a snp residing within the gene itself. glo <dig> is a candidate gene that is thought to be involved with fatness; a study that focussed on a qtl for carbohydrate and total energy intake on chromosome  <dig> in mice showed that genes  involved in fat metabolism were decreased in carbohydrate preferring mice  <cit> . a gwas performed in  <dig> discovered specific alleles that interestingly were associated with both increased back fat and better leg action  <cit> . these genes included mthfr, wnt <dig>  apoe, bmp <dig>  gnrhr and oxtr.

the results presented have also been compared to a recent gwas performed in a specific sire line large white breed used in dried italian ham production  <cit> . the genes which fontanesi and colleagues found to be associated with significant snps by gene ontology, did not overlap with ones found in this study, however interesting insights were made, possibly indicating that neuronal genes may play a role in fat deposition in the pig. this concurs with one of the genes we found to be associated with fatness, neurotensin, widely distributed throughout the central nervous system that may be a neuromodulator or neurotransmitter.

technical issues pertaining to gwas
there are several factors to consider when interpreting gwas for example, in replication of such studies, the consistency of the results vary  <cit> . some genes are reproducibly found in follow-up studies, such as genes related to diabetes including the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ . this was of particular interest as the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha, was found in a cnv which was significant in this study. replication problems involved in replication of gwas have been widely reported  <cit>  also mentioning that small sample sizes can be problematic. inconsistent results have been reported in obesity studies  <cit> , which suggests that many results may be population dependent.

one possible criticism of the results presented here is the relatively small sample size used. we would argue that this might have been more of a problem had we considered the data as a binary trait . we believe that there is no loss of power  by adopting selective genotyping, indeed we suggest that use of this approach , in fact, retains most of the power of the calculations. if the ebvs are calculated from a larger number of individuals then it removes a source of environmental variation and potentially provides a more accurate estimate of the genetic effect . as darvasi and colleagues showed, selective genotyping is very effective to retain the power of the experiment while reducing the cost of genotyping  <cit> . there is no evidence that selective genotyping would bias results, thereby increasing the number of false positives, providing that an appropriate significance threshold is calculated to account for multiple testing. a similar approach was recently published in this journal by fontanesi and colleagues  <cit>  have demonstrated that selective genotyping is very effective to retain the power of the experiment while reducing the cost of genotyping. given this information, we were able to derive data from a  <dig> + animals, thereby avoiding a high false positive rate. admittedly we might miss qtl with relatively small effects, however part of the point of the exercise was to discover traits that were most biologically significant and thus commercially relevant.

cnv analysis
the cnv information presented is, one of few such studies in pigs and has identified  <dig> candidate cnvs. it is worthy of note however that further studies involving deep sequencing, array cgh and or qpcr would be required to confirm the extent to which the data presented here represent physical changes on dna copy number. nonetheless we have demonstrated that use of snp chips can identify “putative” cnvs that warrant further investigations. our attempts to confirm some of the results are mentioned below. only  <dig> putative cnvs that were discovered contained genes that, as implied by their ontology terms, might be involved in fatness. both programs identified cnvr <dig> d <dig> whereas quantisnp only called cnvr <dig> d <dig>  in cnvr <dig> d <dig>  a copy number loss  was observed in both fat and lean animals, however the number of animals that displayed a loss was significantly greater in lean animals  compared to fat animals . this is particularly interesting, due to the fact that  <dig> of the genes located within this putative cnvr was mchr <dig>  known to regulate feeding behaviour. it has been shown that mice lacking mchr <dig> eat less and are therefore leaner  <cit> . pparα, involved in metabolic control of the expression of genes encoding fatty acid oxidation enzymes  <cit> , is also located in this putative cnvr. cnvr <dig> d <dig>  again displayed a greater number of samples with a loss in copy number in ‘lean’ compared to ‘fat’ animals . genes contained within this cnvr include sodium/glucose transporters and co-transporters, responsible for glucose absorption across the brush border of gastrointestinal tract cells; similar gene families have also been identified in other pig cnvr studies  <cit> . when comparing the data produced from this study to other published work, there were  <dig> losses identified by quantisnp that were also found by fadista et al.  <cit> . seven overlapping cnvrs were also found when comparing our data to ramayo-caldas et al.  <cit> , however there were discrepancies in calling whether these were gains or losses.

a total of 83% of the  <dig> putative cnvs identified were unique to quantisnp, 6% were unique to cnvpartition and 11% were detected by both programs. one possible reason for these discrepancies is that each of the programs made use of a different algorithm in order to detect putative cnvs. cnvpartition, the plug-in available for illumina’s genome studio, produces  <dig> of  <dig> possible outputs assuming  <dig> copy number states; a homozygous deletion, heterozygous deletion, dizygous , trizygous  and finally tetrazygous . this algorithm models log r ratios  and b allele frequencies  as a bivariate gaussian distribution. in contrast, quantisnp is based on a hidden-bayes objective markov model  that considers the number of copies in both the hidden and observed states. quantisnp uses a filtering process by which any cnvs called with a log bayes factor of less than ten were removed whereas cnvpartition does not. taking this into consideration it is surprising that quantisnp called more cnv regions than cnvpartition, however this could suggest that the algorithm used by the cnvpartition software is more accurate at calling cnvs. generally, there were more losses found by both programs than gains. a paper published this year discussed new freely available software called parsecnv. this is a cnv call association software that uses cnv information to create snp statistics from information in the penncnv format  <cit> ; this would be an interesting future study to perform on this data.

qpcr was attempted in order to verify the results produced from both cnvpartition and quantisnp, however, after numerous attempts, results did not give adequate consistency in order to calibrate the system and therefore make it possible to verify the putative cnv calls by independent means. as discussed in a study published in  <dig>  there are several reasons as to why cnvr prediction varies between qpcr analysis and in silico analysis of data. the  <dig> x sequence depth of the sus scrofa genome build  <dig> and low probe density of the porcine snp <dig> beadchip makes it difficult to determine the genuine boundaries of cnvrs. this can therefore lead to an over-estimation of the real size of the region. snps and indels also have the ability to affect the hybridisation of qpcr primers and true cnvr boundaries may be polymorphic between analysed animals  <cit> . array cgh could also be used as an alternative platform to derive cnv information from and compared to data produced in this study. there have been several such studies performed  <cit>  including one in pigs  <cit> . whilst this would be an interesting comparison, it is possible that similar amplification problems might be experienced.

CONCLUSIONS
the combination of a cost effecting selective genotyping-based gwas, data from  <dig> widely consumed pig breeds, the derivation of data from archived blood spots and the simultaneous mining of both snp and cnv data are the unique aspects of this study. the discovery of novel snps and cnvs associated with fatness are, potentially of value to the pig breeding industry and shed light on the aetiology of fatness in mammals . however they demonstrate the phenomenon of breed-specificity and thus highlight the need for the study of multiple populations to verify genotype - phenotype correlations.
