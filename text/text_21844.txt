BACKGROUND
the use of mtdna, microsatellites, snp arrays and whole genome sequencing has revealed some of the genetic changes underlying the generation of phenotypic diversity under domestication. specifically a small set of genes associated with phenotypic traits related to morphology, coat texture, color and behavior have been identified that are common to breeds sharing a similar phenotype . other studies have also provided insight into the selective forces at play during the process of domestication , admixture with wild relatives  <cit> , or the population structure purebred and village dogs .

structural variation refers to genomic alterations in the dna content  greater than  <dig> bp in size  <cit> . although fewer studies of structural variation have been performed in dogs compared to studies using snps or microsatellite loci, some examples of copy number variants  that affect phenotype have been identified  <cit> . to date, four large-scale surveys of structural variation in dogs have been carried out using array comparative genomic hybridization  , providing the first catalog of cnvs in the dog genome and candidate cnvs for breed-specific traits. however, very limited knowledge exists on the evolution and timing of cnv events.

a variety of genetic mechanisms affect cnv dispersion in humans  <cit> , the most common mechanism being non-allelic homologous recombination , which involves the misalignment and crossover between regions of extended homology during both meiosis and mitosis. in humans, the zinc-finger protein prdm <dig> is implicated in the cnv formation by nahr  <cit> . the inactivation of this gene in the canid lineage  <cit>  suggests that genomic features that promote the formation of cnv in canids might differ from the majority of mammals. recently, axelsson et al.  <cit>  suggested that gc peaks represent novel sites of elevated recombination and genome instability in dogs, and berglund et al.  <cit>  proposed that these gc peaks were associated with the generation of many cnvs by nahr events. however, the resolution of breakpoint in berglund et al. was limited by the low density acgh they used which precluded a fine-scale characterization of the regions. high-resolution approaches should provide new insight on the molecular mechanisms for cnv formation and dispersion in the genome. in addition, the analysis of outgroup species is needed in order to understand the origin and evolution of cnvs and their possible role in the origin of phenotypic diversity in domestic dogs. specifically, the study of these loci in wolf-like canids, including the gray wolf , the species from which domestic dogs derived, is needed to refine the assessment of ancestral states and variants that have appeared after domestication.

in this work, we designed a high density custom 720k probe acgh chip to systematically genotype  <dig>  cnvs derived mainly from modern dog breeds  <cit>  in a new panel of  <dig> purebred dogs, one dingo ,  <dig> gray wolves from eleven genetically distinct populations worldwide , one red wolf , one coyote  and one golden jackal . this expanded dataset of wolf-like canids, combined with a probe density higher than in previous studies, allowed us to perform the first high resolution characterization of cnvs in wolf-like canids and identify cnv break points over at a longer time-scale.

RESULTS
distribution and genomic effects of cnvs
to investigate cnvs in wolf-like canids we genotyped  <dig> canids  for  <dig>  cnvs previously typed in  <dig> dogs by nicholas et al.  <cit>  who compiled all the cnvs previously reported, mainly in modern dog breeds  <cit>  . we assessed the performance of our cnv genotyping using a two-stage procedure. in a first discovery stage, we identified cnvs using a conservative approach based on the combination on two methods: a reversible jump hidden markov model  <cit>  and the procedure described in  <cit> . in the second stage, we genotyped our samples for each of these discovered cnv regions .

we used three approaches to estimate false discovery rate and assess data quality. first, we performed two self-self hybridizations with a boxer  and a wolf from iran. this analysis called only  <dig> and  <dig> cnvs, respectively, suggesting a low false discovery rate similar to that obtained by  <cit> . second, we included  <dig> putative single copy control regions used by nicholas et al.  <cit>  on the acgh chip. across  <dig> control regions analyzed , our algorithm only called  <dig> cnvs, suggesting a lower false discovery rate  than obtained by  <cit> . third, quantitative pcr  was perfomed using taqman assays on  <dig> canids  to further validate  <dig> cnv regions . in all the cases the qpcr validate the cnv regions. assuming the qpcr results represent the correct copy number of individuals, we estimate a false positive rate of  <dig> and a false negative rate of  <dig> % in the calling in the acgh data, confirming the conservativeness of threshold for calling cnvs in the acgh data.

we found a total of  <dig> cnvs distributed in  <dig> of the  <dig>  regions analyzed . many of the regions analyzed  did not show any cnv in our dataset probably due to several reasons. first, not all the previously reported cnvs had the same level of support. in fact, only  <dig> % of the original  <dig>  regions previously analyzed were labeled as “high confidence cnvs”  and we found cnvs in our dataset in almost 75% of these regions. second, the design of the array was based almost exclusively on modern dog breeds  and a high proportion of the cnvs were identified in just one individual each . since we only genotyped  <dig> purebred dogs, many of these cnvs may not have been detectable.figure  <dig>

summary of cnvs genotyped per sample


*unique are defined as cnv that are present only in one sample.

of the  <dig> cnvs regions that we identified,  <dig>  were shared between dogs and wild canids. dog-specific cnvs were  <dig> %  of the total but the design of the array and the different number of samples analyzed  suggests this was an underestimation . these  <dig> derived cnvs may have originated after domestication but most of them  were present in only one dog, so likely arose later in the evolutionary history of dogs. selection could have fixed some of these variants in some breeds or alternatively, given the small effective population size of breeds, strong genetic drift and founder effect might have overcome the possible negative effects of cnvs. consequently, we analyzed whether these  <dig> cnvs were enriched for genes, compared to the  <dig> non-dog-specific regions  or to the total  <dig>  regions . although not all intergenic variants may be neutral , our randomization test suggested that those  <dig> cnvs might not be under strong selection since we did not find any enrichment in the number of genes in dog specific regions compared to non-dog-specific regions  or the total  <dig>  regions  . similarly, no gene ontology category was overrepresented in dog-specific or in the whole set of  <dig>  cnv regions.

in relation to overall cnv diversity, the sample with lowest cnvs identified was the boxer, probably because the reference was also a boxer. in the same way, we also found more cnvs in wolves than in dogs . in order to quantify the differences between dogs and wolves, we calculated allele frequencies for each cnv in dogs and wolves using the em algorithm  <cit> . from these allele frequencies, we estimated the expected heterozygosity  for each polymorphic cnv and the average for dogs and gray wolves. since the number of wolf samples analyzed was higher , we estimated the random expectation averaging he for  <dig>  groups of  <dig> randomly selected gray wolves and found that the structural variability in dogs and gray wolves are very similar . domestication is associated with a very large reduction in the population size in dogs . however, we do not see a similar reduction of cnv variation in dogs in our acgh data, most likely because of the ascertainment bias in the design of the array, which is expected to result in higher levels of cnv variation in dogs.

in agreement with previous studies , we found more losses than gains both in dogs and wolves. this is partly attributable to technical biases, because in acgh experiments copy gains are more difficult to genotype than losses  <cit> . since in acgh experiments losses and gains are relative to the reference genome it is not possible to separate duplications and deletions without an outgroup. we used data from wolf-like canids to determine the ancestral state and thus identify duplications and deletion in dogs. we considered a post-domestication cnv event any gain or loss present in dogs but not in any wolves. we found  <dig> and  <dig> post-domestication duplications and deletions, respectively. it has been suggested that gene deletions are more likely to be deleterious than duplications and therefore more likely to be purged by purifying selection. however, we did not find an enrichment in genes in the  <dig> regions with duplications in dogs compared to the whole set of  <dig>  cnv regions , while we found gene enrichment in the  <dig> regions with deletions  suggesting a potential relaxation of purifying selection in dogs. this is consistent with previous studies which have described a relative increase in the proportion of non synonymous substitutions in the dog genome, suggested to be the result of a relaxation of the purifying selection in dogs  <cit> . this could be due to changes in the way of life of dogs and, specially, to the reduction of their effective population size compared to the population size of the ancestor species, the gray wolf, during domestication.

analysis of cnv breakpoints
taking advantage of our higher acgh resolution, we could define cnv breakpoints within  <dig> bp and analyze their nucleotide composition. gc-peaks were defined as  <dig> bp windows or greater centered in  <dig> kb windows with more than 50% increase in gc-content  <cit> . we found an even clearer enrichment of peaks of gc-high regions close to the breakpoints compared to previous results  <cit> . the enrichment rapidly decays outside breakpoints  . we next recorded the nucleotide fine-scale gc-content around the breakpoints in sliding windows of  <dig> bp . we found a small increase in gc-content about a kb outside the breakpoint, although there seemed to be a small local decrease in gc-content exactly at the breakpoint. however, our ability to locate the exact position of the breakpoints fluctuated over a few hundred bp given the probe distribution in the arrays  and the cnv callers tended to have some uncertainty in the transition probes at the breakpoints. assuming some uncertainties in the identification of the breakpoints, we still found local peaks around  <dig> kb from the breakpoint that could indicate some common motif, whereas the observed increase in gc-content within the cnvs could indicate the effects of biased gene conversion which increases gc-content in duplicated sequences.figure  <dig>

we next searched for stretches of perfect homology between breakpoint pairs defined using the  <dig> bp windows. the longest stretch of perfect homology was recorded for paired breakpoints. the mean length was  <dig>  bp. the pairs were then randomly redistributed on the same chromosome to evaluate statistical significance, with a mean of  <dig>  bp using a wilcoxon rank sum test. we found a small but significant increase in homology between breakpoint pairs compared to a random expectation, supporting nahr as a main mechanism for formation of cnvs in canids. an even stronger effect is supported when increasing the breakpoint size to  <dig> kb to include the peculiar gc-pattern seen one kb away from the break; the homology stretch then increased to  <dig>  bp vs.  <dig>  bp expected by chance .

we finally searched for regions of overlap between breakpoint windows and repeats using the repeatmasker track. the repeat families simple repeats and l <dig> repeats were enriched in breakpoint windows . when we divided l <dig> repeats according to their age, recent l1s were more enriched than older ones , although not as pronounced as previously observed . statistical enrichment of l <dig> repeats varied with breakpoint size in a fashion where enrichment increased with window sizes up to  <dig> kb and slowly decreased with larger window sizes. therefore cnv breakpoints tend to have young l <dig> repeats nearby, although they are not overlapping.

candidate cnv selected during dog domestication
regions under selection early in dog domestication should be highly differentiated from those in the gray wolf, whereas regions selected during breed formation should show differentiation signals between dog breeds. previous studies have focused on these later regions. to select the most differentiated regions between dog  and wild canids we calculated vst for each polymorphic region as previously described  <cit> . the distribution of vst showed that most of the regions  had low  vst , and the average vst  was lower than the fst obtained from snp data  <cit> . similarly, the estimates of fst for purebred dogs obtained from cnv data were also lower than the estimates obtained from snp data  <cit> . this low estimate could be due to the smaller number of samples analyzed. however, we found regions with an estimate of vst several-fold higher than the average. for instance, within the  <dig> most differentiated regions, the lowest vst is  <dig>   and the average vst is  <dig> .figure  <dig>

st; dogs are represented in red. the cnv region  overlaps with the pde4d gene .



of the  <dig> candidate genes in the most differentiated regions , three genes are related to growth . the cnvs that include the crtc <dig> gene have higher copy number in dogs  than in gray wolves. it has been shown that crtc3−/−m ice maintained on a normal chow diet appear more insulin-sensitive than controls and also have 50% lower adipose tissue mass than control mice despite comparable physical activity  <cit> . incidence of overweight and obesity in dogs exceeds 30%, and several breeds are predisposed to this heritable phenotype  <cit> . however, perhaps the most striking example of potential divergence in function is for the pde4d gene . for this region, all wild canids present the same genotype , whereas most of the studied dogs  present losses. mice that are deficient in this isoenzyme exhibit delayed growth with a 30-40% decrease in body weight at 1– <dig> weeks after birth  <cit> . although growth rate returned to normal after  <dig> weeks, the weight of the adult mice remained lower than normal due to a decrease in muscle and bone mass and internal organ weight  associated with a decrease in circulating insulin-like growth factor i  levels. the igf <dig> gene is a strong genetic determinant of body size across mammals and a single igf <dig> allele is a major determinant of small size in dogs  <cit> . consequently, cnvs near these genes may affect gene expression of this body size associated gene, or act as tag for sequence changes in the gene or its promoter that affect expression. in dogs, six genes explain ~50% of standard breed weight and it is hypothesized that these large-effect variants are superimposed on a subtler size-regulation system inherited from wolves  <cit> . wolves vary substantially in size, with weights ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kg in europe alone  <cit> . on the other hand, pde <dig> inhibitors also facilitate hippocampal long-term potentiation in addition to improving cognitive performance in multiple animal models and reverse memory impairments in genetic mouse models of human disorders  <cit> . in particular, pde4d−/− mice exhibited enhanced earlylong-term potentiation following multiple induction protocols  <cit> .table  <dig>

interestingly, among the  <dig> candidate genes, six other genes also are implicated in neurological function in other mammalian species  . the synaptic regulator slc6a <dig> is a particularly interesting candidate since human genetic studies indicate that a cnv including this gene is associated with autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia  <cit> . one of the most unique behavioral traits of dogs relative to wolves is their social-communicative skills with humans. domestic dogs are more skillful than chimpanzees and wolves at using human social clues to find hidden food in the object choice paradigm . this trait likely enabled domestication and facilitated the rapid evolution of genes expressed in the brains of dogs  <cit> .

it is relevant that, among the  <dig> genes within highly differentiated cnv regions between dog and wolf  <dig> of them are related to two functions, typically associated with the process of domestication. however, further functional studies are needed to disentangle the complete role of these genes in the dog domestication process.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we make use of previously reported cnvs in modern dog breeds to explore the evolutionary origin of these sites by using a novel panel of wolf-like canids.

this expanded dataset, combined with our custom-designed higher density array, allowing us to determine the ancestral state and polarize the process of cnv formation in dogs. we identified some candidate genes within cnv regions that are highly differentiated between dogs and wolves, which provide insights into the role of structural variation in the process of dog domestication and in diversification of phenotypes observed among dog breeds. in general our results add significantly to resolution of structural variation and breakpoints in canids. however, ascertainment bias is a problem for the interpretation of cnv patterns in wild canids and analyses of cnvs based on whole genome sequencing will be highly beneficial to evaluate the evolution and impact of structural variability in the process of domestication.
