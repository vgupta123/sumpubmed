BACKGROUND
small ubiquitin-like modifier  proteins are small proteins with an approximate size of  <dig> kd. they have a high structural similarity with ubiquitin, while sharing up to only 20% sequence identity. in spite of this structural similarity, sumo proteins have an unstructured stretch of 10- <dig> amino acids at their n termini, which is not seen in ubiquitin proteins  <cit> . sumo proteins are expressed ubiquitously in the eukaryotic kingdom, and they show high evolutionary conservation rates  <cit> . some of the organisms, such as c. elegans and d. melanogaster, have only one sumo gene, while plants and vertebrae have multiple sumo genes with different properties. human genome has  <dig> distinct and slightly different sumo paralogs, named sumo1- <dig>  of these, sumo1- <dig> can be found in almost every tissue in humans; however, sumo <dig> has been mainly seen in kidneys, lymph nodes and spleen . additionally, proteomic studies showed that sumo <dig> and sumo2/ <dig> have partially overlapping sets of target proteins. of these identified target proteins, nearly one-third are putative transcription regulators while the other two-thirds are composed of signalling molecules, nuclear envelope proteins, and cell membrane proteins .

sumo proteins are inactive when they are synthesized and they become activated after the cleavage of a c terminal peptide  by sentrin-specific proteases, exposing an invariant gly-gly motif  <cit> . after this cleavage, sumo proteins become ready for the sumoylation process and attachment to a target protein.

sumoylation pathway involves a sumo-protease enzyme, the activating enzyme e <dig>  the conjugating enzyme e <dig> and the mediator enzyme e <dig> . ubc <dig> plays the key role in the pathway as it recognizes the sumo binding motif, which generally has the consensus motif of Ψkxe/d   <cit> . two main extensions of this motif has been proposed in literature . the first one is phosphorylation-dependent sumoylation motif , in which a phosphorylated serine and a proline residue is present after the conventional binding motif . the second extended motif is the negatively charged amino-acid dependent sumoylation motif . the common theme for both motifs is that the negative charge next to the basic sumo consensus site enhances the sumoylation  <cit> . however, having one of these motifs is not a complete indicator of sumoylation. it has been argued that subcellular localization and/or appropriate sequence presentation may also be of significance in determination of a sumoylation site. hence, accurate identification of structural context of the target protein becomes the main issue, as the structural context seems to dictate the sumoylation  <cit> . additionally, it has been argued that other post-translational modifications may have effects on sumoylation, such as acetylation can act as a preparation step for sumoylation, which was the case for histone h <dig>  <cit> .

rapidly progressing research on sumoylation showed that sumoylation can alter the target's localization, intra/intermolecular interactions, and resulting roles in protein stability, protein-dna binding activity, transcriptional regulation, sub-nuclear targeting, nucleocytoplasmic translocalization, chromosome segregation and various indispensable roles in mitosis  <cit> . in addition to these vital cellular processes, sumoylation is linked with ever increasing number of diseases, such as alzheimer's, parkinson's, huntington's, multiple sclerosis and cancer . however, identifying sumoylation sites experimentally is a labor-intensive process, which may also result in false negatives due to the reversible and dynamic nature of sumoylation. on the other hand, basic motif matching based computational methods are predestined with a certain classification accuracy, as approximately 26%  of the known cases do not contain the identified consensus motif . hence, developing a reliable in silico sumoylation prediction method that has a better accuracy based on sequence derived features, bears a significant importance for the understanding complex diseases, cellular processes and epigenetic mechanisms.

in order to overcome this challenge, various sophisticated methods have been introduced into literature. one of the earliest predictors of sumoylation was sumoplot  <cit> , which is mainly based on consensus motif matching and substitution of the consensus amino acid residues with amino acid residues that have similar hydrophobicity. following sumoplot, sumopre  <cit> , a probabilistic model that optimizes the entropy of the motif, was published. another method, sumosp  <cit>  based on  <dig> algorithms originally introduced for prediction of phosphorylation sites, group based scoring   <cit> , and another statistical method named motifx  <cit> . sumosp was updated to sumosp  <dig>  a year later  <cit> . meanwhile, bauer et al.  <cit>  has developed another method, based on sequence window representations with amino acid composition, evolutionary information, relative solvent accessibility and secondary structure. seesumo  <cit> , a recently published method, was mainly based on random forest and svm training of biological sequence features obtained from aaindex and evolutionary information of sequence windows. lastly, sumohydro  <cit>  is mainly based on input feature vectors based on various representations, including, but not limited to, traditional binary encoding, the composition of k-spaced amino acid pairs , position specific scoring matrix, six-letter, nine-letter, and 'hydrobinary' encoding. among these methods, sumoplot, sumosp  <dig> , seesumo, and sumohydro have active web servers that can be used to predict sumoylation sites in a protein. although these methods have comparable prediction performances, they are not sufficient for understanding the complete picture of sumoylation mechanism.

in this study, we have investigated efficacy of various physicochemical properties of lysine centered sequence windows in sumoylation site prediction. we have introduced the use of new properties, such as lysine conformational flexibility and disorder. the sumolated lysine should be flexible to interact with the sumo protein and disorder information may shed light on the mechanism of interaction. this is because lysines in ordered structures may encounter some degree of difficulty in sumoylation depending on their structural location. we also used the position of the lysine with respect to the vicinity to either termini, as well as the previously used properties, such as hydrophobicity, amino acid volumes and direct sequence information. by using fine-tuned support vector machines  we have been able to achieve a robust performance displayed by 5-fold cross validation results with matthew's correlation coefficient, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of  <dig> , 73%, 98%, 97%, respectively. here we have presented the statistical analysis of sumoylated sites, details of this new method, its overall performance, and in depth benchmark experiments with  <dig> previously published methods and a simple consensus motif regular expressions scanner.

RESULTS
dataset and statistical analysis
the training set consisted of  <dig> positive sites conforming to the consensus motif,  <dig> positive sites  not conforming to the consensus motif,  <dig> negative sites conforming to the consensus motif, and  <dig> negative sites not conforming to the consensus motif . similarly, the test set was composed of  <dig> positive sites conforming to the consensus motif,  <dig> positive sites not conforming to the consensus motif,  <dig> negative sites conforming to the consensus motif and lastly,  <dig> negative sites not conforming to the consensus motif .

a total of  <dig> experimentally verified sumoylation sites were divided into  <dig> categories.  <dig> of the positive sites formed the training set, in which  <dig> sites conformed to the consensus motif and  <dig> did not conform to the consensus motif. remaining  <dig> positive sites formed the independent testing set, in which  <dig> conformed to the consensus motif and,  <dig> did not conformed to the consensus motif.

most of the sumoylated sites are identified by the existence of the consensus motif Ψkxe/d . we have created sequence logos for observing amino acid distribution of consensus positive sites , non-consensus positive sites , consensus negative sites , and non-consensus negative sites . in consensus positive sites, central lysine residue predominantly flanked by glutamic acid residue in c-terminal side. on the other hand, in consensus negative sites, central lysine is almost equally flanked by glutamic acid or aspartic acid in c-terminal site. these slight differences have been shown to be insufficient to predict all the sumoylation cases. therefore, there should be other factors facilitating sumo binding to the target protein or more subtle differences in amino acid preferences that cannot be represented with sequence logos. in this section, we discuss statistical differences between sumoylated sequence windows and non-sumoylated sequence windows.

we have performed three different statistical comparisons: positive windows vs. negative windows, consensus positive windows vs. non-consensus positive windows, and consensus negative windows vs. non-consensus negative windows . separate chi-square tests of independence were performed for each amino acid presence in the each position of the sequence window . for the hydrophobicity and estimated volume, non-parametric mann-whitney u tests were performed. out of  <dig> different statistical tests for the first strategy,  <dig> yielded significant results with p <  <dig> .  <dig> out of  <dig>  statistically significant features were also retained in feature selection . among those, we have explored only a portion of statistically significant features in this section due to space limitations. the rest of the statististical testing results with their descriptive statistics, p-values, and their test statistics can be found in the additional file  <dig> 

 <dig> out of  <dig> features has been selected based on 10-fold classification performance. features are ranked using relieff  <cit>  algorithm, implemented in weka  <cit> . details of statistical testing can be found in methods section. for assessing significance, adjusted p-value cutoff of  <dig>  is used. feature name explanations can be found in methods section and figure 2a.

the proportion of glutamic acid at one amino acid after lysine , a consensus motif feature, was  <dig>  in positive windows, whereas it was  <dig>  in negative windows. this difference in proportions was found to be significant, χ²  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> . this result also can also be supported by sequence logos in figure 2b-e.

a depletion of positive amino acid residues in particular positions of sequence windows has been observed in sumoylated cases. for instance, the proportion of an extra lysine located  <dig> residues after central lysine  was  <dig>  in positive windows, and  <dig>  in negative windows. the difference was found statistically significant, χ²  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> , with yates' correction. similarly, the proportion of an extra lysine residue presence just before the central lysine residue  was  <dig>  in positive windows, whereas it was  <dig>  in negative windows. this difference was found to be statistically significant as well, χ²  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> . same depletion pattern was also observed for the arginine presence in exactly same locations in the sequence windows. the associated proportions were  <dig>  in positive windows, and  <dig>  in negative windows for arginine presence two residues after central lysine residue . this difference was found to be significant, χ²  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> , with yates' correction. for the presence of arginine residue just before central lysine , the proportions were  <dig>  in positive windows and  <dig>  in negative windows. this proportion difference was also found to be significant, χ²  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> , with yates' correction. a similar pattern can be seen for histidine presence in second position after central lysine  as well  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> , with yates' correction).

an interesting result was the presence of proline at the end of the sequence window . the proportions were  <dig>  in positive windows and  <dig>  in negative windows. the difference of these proportions was found to be significant, χ²  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> . this position was argued to be important in controlling the acetylation-sumoylation switch on the lysine residue and it has been documented that acetylation is antagonizing the sumoylation . in fact, an extension to the consensus motif was identified for cross-play between sumoylation and acetylation: Ψkxep  <cit> . this result gives rise to two questions. the first one is what the proportion of shared targets between acetylation and sumoylation is. the second question is whether the presence of proline residue at this specific position also favors sumoylation. this can be due to some kind of structural similarity of acetylation and sumoylation enzymes as they may recognize the same lysine residue as a target.

most striking differences we have observed were in flexibility and disorder. as they have never been systematically explored in sumoylation context, our findings may be of help in understanding the sumoylation process. the proportion of conformationally flexible central lysine residue was found to be  <dig>  in positive windows, whereas it was  <dig>  in negative windows. this difference in proportions was found to be significant, χ²  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> . similarly, disorder  was found to be significantly different between positive and negative windows , χ²  =  <dig>  p <  <dig> . these results may suggest that in order for sumoylation to occur the corresponding lysine residue should be flexible enough to be captured by sumoylation enzymes and sumo binding. another interesting result on disorder was proportional difference between consensus positive sites and non-consensus positive sites . a chi-square test of independence was performed to determine how consensus and non-consensus positive sites differ from each other. apart from various amino acid preferences, the proportion of disordered central lysine residues  was  <dig>  in consensus positive sites, whereas it was  <dig>  in non-consensus positive sites. this difference was found to be significant, χ²  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> , which may suggest a mechanistic difference between consensus site sumoylation and non-consensus site sumoylation.

the third strategy resulted in several amino acid preferences on various positions of the sequence window. however, we have omitted the details of those for the sake of brevity and they can be found in the supplementary material. we would like to also note that statistical testing results should be taken with caution. especially, some of the amino acid preferences may be declared significant only due to frequency differences, not to an underlying biological principle.

prediction performance and feature selection
sumosu is a new method developed on an already existing dataset, with a new set of sequence based features, by employing support vector machines. in order to improve prediction performance; kernel, c-values, γ, and window size were optimized for this problem specifically . feature selection has resulted in  <dig> optimal features  from a total of  <dig> features. the ranked list of top  <dig> features with their statistical analysis results can be found in table  <dig>  the complete list of selected features is presented in additional file  <dig>  using optimized parameters and selected features, sumosu was able to identify sumoylated sites accurately. in order to test the stability of our method, we have implemented three evaluation strategies: self-consistency test, where training dataset was used as both training and test dataset, 10-fold cross-validation, and 5-fold cross-validation. four different evaluation measures have been calculated for assessing performance of stated strategies: accuracy, specificity, sensitivity and matthew's correlation coefficient  . using 5-fold cross-validation, sumosu achieved a prediction accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and matthew's correlation coefficient of 97%, 98%, 73% and  <dig> , respectively. prediction performance has also been assessed with 10-fold cross validation and self consistency test with a reference of a regular expressions scan . consistent high mcc values indicated the robustness of this new developed method. however, mcc values may be affected by imbalance of specificity and sensitivity. therefore, we have investigated the area under roc curve , which is not affected by on the imbalance of class distributions. average auc of  <dig> repeats for both 5-fold and 10-fold cross-validation was shown to be as  <dig>  . roc curves and consistent high auc indicated that, sumosu, is actually a stable prediction method.

an average of  <dig> repeats are reported for 5-fold and 10-fold cross validation tests. standard deviations were less than  <dig> , so they were not reported. regular expressions scan is done by searching k. pattern in the sequence window centering the lysine residue.

we further examined the performance of our prediction method for predicting non-consensus sites of sumoylation. self-consistency results indicated that our method was able to predict about 12%  of non-consensus sumoylation sites correctly; however, it was not able to predict any of the non-consensus sumoylation sites in the test data . on the other hand, prediction accuracy of negative sites following consensus motifs was higher for the training set  and test set . these results also support the results stated in table  <dig> and they show that our method outperforms a simple regular expression matching of the Ψkxe/d motif. however, it also gives rise to the question of how these non-consensus sites are processed in the sumoylation pathway and how the prediction of this non-consensus sites can be further improved.

additionally, in order to assess the contribution of conformational flexibility and disorder to the prediction performance, we have performed 5-fold cross validation and self-consistency tests with and without these features . results showed a slight decrease in sensitivity only. this may be the result of dependence of sequence-based prediction of conformational flexibility and disorder, which may already be included in the sequence based features.

conformational flexibility and disorder features  were eliminated from dataset one by one and together. self-consistency and 5-fold cross validation tests were performed. an average of  <dig> repeats are reported for 5-fold cross validation tests. standard deviations were less than  <dig> , so they were not reported.

overall, the results showed that sumosu was able to provide a robust prediction performance showed by different assessment strategies.

comparison with other methods
our proposed method, sumosu, has been extensively benchmarked against a set of existing methods: sumopre  <cit> , sumohydro  <cit> , seesumo  <cit> , and sumosp <dig>   <cit> . sumosu implements a machine learning approach to sumoylation site prediction, similar to seesumo and sumohydro. however, it is the first method that employs conformational flexibility, disorder and amino acid volume information in prediction, which may have an impact on sumoylation tendency. we have also compared our proposed method with a simple regular expressions scan of the consensus motif, k..

initially, we have compared our method with a regular expressions scan. since there is no chance of performing a cross-validation analysis with motif matching, we choose self-consistency as a comparison strategy. while our self-consistency results were 97%, 98% 75%,  <dig>  for accuracy, specificity, sensitivity and mcc respectively, regular expressions scan resulted with 96%, 97%, 72%,  <dig>  for the same evaluation measures respectively. our method showed better results in all of the evaluation measures, and significantly exceeded mcc of a simple regular expressions scan for the training data. for the independent test data, when we set sumosu  sensitivity equal to regular expressions sensitivity value, sumosu exceeded regular expressions scan specificity  and accuracy  with a specificity of 97% and an accuracy of 96%. also, while regular expressions scan resulted with an mcc of  <dig>  for test data, sumosu resulted with  <dig>  for this threshold.

sumopre is a statistical method for sumoylation site prediction. it has been trained on a smaller dataset, consisted of  <dig> positive sites, and  <dig>  negative sites. as their web server is not available as of publication date of this article, we have only used measures published in their article to compare with our model. when self-consistency was used as a testing strategy, sumopre resulted with 97%, 98%, 74%,  <dig>  for accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and mcc respectively. on the other hand, our method performed better in terms of sensitivity  and mcc  with a higher dataset of  <dig> positive sites and  <dig>  negative sites.

we have tested our model using an independent dataset in order to compare with other existing methods. we have employed the same independent set as sumohydro, which has stated that this set does not contain any residues that have used for any of the training sets of previous methods. in comparison, we have set three thresholds on svm decision values as previous methods did: low, medium and high. these thresholds has been set as - <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. svm decision values represent distance of the samples to the separating hyperplane. higher decision values imply deeper points or more confident decisions.

as shown in table  <dig> sumosu showed the best performance on accuracy and specificity for all thresholds, while seesumo-rf exceeded its performance on sensitivity for the medium and high thresholds and sumosp <dig>  for the low threshold. however, when we set the sensitivity of sumosu  equal to the sumosp <dig>  sensitivity for the low threshold, we have observed an accuracy of 94%, a specificity of 95% and a mcc of  <dig> , indicating a better accuracy, specificity and mcc than sumosp <dig>  at the same sensitivity level. additionally, if we set the sensitivity of sumosu  equal to the sensitivity of seesumo for the medium and high thresholds, sumosu exceeds seesumo performance in three evaluation measures with an accuracy of 96%, a specificity of 97%, and a mcc of  <dig> ; and an accuracy of 96%, a specificity of 97% and a mcc of  <dig>  for the medium and low thresholds respectively.

the values of accuracy , specificity , sensitivity , and matthew's correlation efficients  are obtained from chen et al.  <cit>  as the exact same independent dataset was employed in this study. thresholds for sumosu was set as - <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for low, medium and high, respectively.

as it can be seen from the aforementioned comparisons, threshold selection significantly affects the performance of sumosu in the independent test set and it seems that sumosu favors the negative predictions due to class imbalance, which can be solved with appropriate thresholds. all these results show that the proposed method, sumosu, compares favorably to the most used sumoylation predictors.

discussions
in the present study, we have developed a highly robust new method to predict sumoylation sites with the use of various sequence features and flexibility/disorder information. in order to get rid of redundant features, we have performed a feature selection procedure using relieff  <cit> . we have also analyzed the data to identify statistically sound differences between positive and negative sites, revealing various amino acid preferences and biochemical differences. particularly, our study included conformational flexibility and disorder for the first time to our knowledge in sumoylation site prediction, and we have found that these properties statistically significantly differ in positive and negative sites . although they are not highly effective in improving classification performance, this finding supports the argument of macauley et al.  <cit>  as conformational flexibility may be a general feature of the regions in sumoylation target lysines. they have summarized that some of the characterized sumoylation sites, such as in histone h <dig>  iκbα, p <dig>  and c-jun, are located in unstructured flexible regions  <cit> . however, they have also included some exceptions to this flexibility argument, such as well structured pnt domain of tel and the ring domain of pml  <cit> . similarly, lin et al. argued that sumo- <dig> target binding sites are likely to be located in flexible or unstructured regions  <cit> . additionally, they have identified an important surface in substrate recognition, adjacent to the conjugation active site on a sumo e <dig> enzyme, ubc <dig>  which has also high flexibility in the picosecond to nanosecond and microsecond to milisecond time scales  <cit> . when these findings are considered together, it can be argued that both the enzyme surface and the target lysine residues should be conformationally flexible enough to interact and facilitate sumoylation. in fact, it has been shown that the target lysine residue needs to reach into catalytic pocket of ubc <dig>  <cit> , which may suggest the importance of flexibility in target lysine residue motion. hence, in the light of specific examples, it can be argued that conformational flexibility or disorder may also be effective in general identification of sumoylation sites. additionally, it should be noted for disorder that our analyses indicated that consensus positive sites are more disordered than non-consensus positive sites . this fact may be useful for distinguishing consensus negative sites from positive ones. ultimately, there may be not be a universal mechanism for sumoylation but instead several distinct mechanisms are in place for sumoylation. therefore, clustering of sumoylated sites depending on the flexibility of the site and deriving new features to develop separate classifiers for different clusters may better explain the mechanism, which will be the primary focus of a future study by our group.

in addition to conformational flexibility and disorder, one of the main reasons of the robustness of sumosu was the employment of sequence information, hydrophobicity information, and estimated amino acid volumes. effectiveness of hydrophobicity along with position-specific sequence information has been shown in various studies before  <cit> . our study confirmed these findings and supports xu et al.  <cit>  and others in the argument that sumoylation significantly depends on local sequence composition. incorporating hydrophobicity information is also biologically sensible, as hydrophobic patches may be effective in sumoylation site recognition as they were in non-covalent sumo interactions . similar to previous predictors, we have observed that most of the prediction accuracy is provided by the primary sequence and hydrophobicity information. also, estimated sub-window volumes may indicate "accessibility" of the central lysine to recognition. they may also represent a degree of mechanistic preferences of sumoylation enzymes while approaching to a protein for target recognition.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a new method to predict sumoylation sites by employing support vector machines, which has shown its performance with mcc, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy equal to  <dig> , 73%, 98%, and 97%, respectively for 5-fold cross-validation. we have also performed statistical analyses to identify possible amino acid preferences or other biological factors that may affect the sumoylation site recognition. our prediction method suggests a sequence and hydrophobicity-dependent recognition affected by conformational flexibility, disorder, or sub-window volume difference. future work lays in developing a web service for sumosu to make it accessible to the biological research community.
