BACKGROUND
the mammalian retina is an excellent paradigm to study both differentiation and maturation of neurons from common precursor cells  <cit> . several transcription factors are clearly essential for photoreceptor development, and their mutations cause retinal degenerations: nrl, crx, otx <dig>  trβ <dig> , and nr2e <dig>  <cit> . nrl, crx and nr2e <dig> are present in photoreceptor progenitors quite early  when they influence photoreceptor type. while present in photoreceptor progenitors, they are not associated with the rhodopsin  promoter in vivo, until these neurons begin to mature and rho is expressed  <cit> . regulators of photoreceptor-specific gene promoters appear to form a transcriptional complex supported by their multiple protein-protein interactions. nrl and crx can interact directly with each other, and they synergize to activate the rho promoter in vitro  <cit> . likewise, nr2e <dig> interacts with crx, and supports crx-mediated activation of rod-specific gene promoters, and repression of cone-specific gene promoters  <cit> .

through efforts to map protein interactions involved in regulating retinal gene expression, fiz <dig> was found as a protein that interacts with nrl, and co-purifies with nrl from nuclear extracts  <cit> . while fiz <dig> mrna is found in most human and mouse tissues, fiz <dig> protein content is lower in immature postnatal mouse retina and its concentration increases ten-fold  as retinal neurons mature to full functionality  <cit> . immunohistochemistry has revealed increasing fiz <dig> concentration in photoreceptors, the inner plexiform layer, and the ganglion cell layer  <cit> . functionally, fiz <dig> can synergize with nrl and crx to increase the activation of the rho and pde6b  promoters in vitro  <cit> .

is fiz <dig> recruited to the regulatory protein complex on the rhodopsin promoter in vivo? to address this question, we wanted to determine the subcellular localization of fiz <dig> in the neural retina at the ultrastructural level. we utilized transmission electron microscopy  with nano-gold labeling to accomplish this goal. to determine if fiz <dig> is part of the protein complex, with nrl and crx, on photoreceptor specific gene promoters in vivo, we employed electrophoretic mobility shift assays  with retinal nuclear extracts, and chromatin immunoprecipitation  assays.

knowing that members of these transcriptional complexes  are typically involved in several protein-protein interactions, we carried out a set of assays to determine if fiz <dig> could interact with crx. these included yeast two-hybrid assays, gst pull-down assays, co-immunoprecipitation assays, and promoter activation assays with two test opsin promoters . lastly, we employed quantitative chip  assays to compare the association of fiz <dig> with the rho gene in immature retina  versus mature retina . a novel technique to directly monitor the transcriptional state of the rho gene, based upon the presence of transcriptionally active rna polymerase-ii within the gene, was adapted successfully for tissue analysis.

we report that fiz <dig> is present in the nucleus of rod and cone photoreceptors as well as other mature retinal neurons. fiz <dig> is part of the regulatory protein complex associated with active rod- and cone-specific gene promoters, but only in photoreceptor cells. furthermore, fiz <dig> can bind directly to crx, and modify crx's activation potential at two opsin  promoters in vitro. q-chip revealed that fiz <dig> association with the rho gene increases in maturing photoreceptors and this correlated with a greater amount of actively transcribing rna polymerase-ii moving through the rho gene.

methods
studies were carried out with the approval of oakland university's animal care and use committee and washington university's animal studies committee. this research complied with the statement for the use of animals in ophthalmic and vision research, as adopted by the association for research in vision and ophthalmology.

nano-gold labeling and transmission electron microscopy
nano-scale immunogold labeling was performed according to previously described methods that yield good sensitivity with mouse neural retina  <cit> . fixation, resin type, and sectioning, were optimized to preserve sufficient retinal morphology, with minimal masking of antigen. mouse retinas, immature  and mature , were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in  <dig>  m phosphate buffer  for  <dig> hours and washed with phosphate buffered saline  over night. retinas were dehydrated with ascending n, n-dimethyl formamide and infiltrated with lowicryl-k4m   <cit> . samples were oriented in gelatin capsules and polymerized under uv light for  <dig> hours. thin sections  were cut using an rmc ultra microtome mt  <dig> and picked up on formvard-coated grids. grids with retinal sections were floated with  <dig> drop of saturated sodium meta periodate for  <dig> hour at room temperature and washed with pbs containing  <dig> % tween- <dig> . samples were incubated with  <dig>  m glycine solution for  <dig> minutes and washed with pbs-t . samples were blocked for non-specific protein binding with 5% normal goat serum in pbs-t for  <dig> hour and incubated with anti-bfiz <dig> antibody , a rabbit igg made to target domain-ii-iv of fiz <dig>  that was affinity purified and specific for fiz <dig> in immunoblots of mammalian retina  <cit> . after washing with pbs-t , samples were incubated with nanogold-fab'goat anti-rabbit-igg nano gold , 1: <dig> in pbs-t,  <dig> hour at 37°c . samples were washed with pbs-t  and post-fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde in pbs for  <dig> minutes. after washing with pbs-t  followed by distilled water, nano-gold particles were enhanced with silver, and samples were double stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate  <cit> . digital photographs of samples were captured using a philips morgani™- <dig> transmission electron microscope, fitted with fei electron optics .

co-immunoprecipitation  from bovine retina nuclear extracts
preparation of bovine retina nuclear extract and co-ip were accomplished as previously described  <cit> . briefly, bovine retinal nuclear extract  was incubated with anti-bfiz <dig> or anti-crx polyclonal antibodies overnight at 4°c with gentle mixing. both antibodies were specific for fiz <dig> or crx in immunoblots of neural retina. anti-bfiz <dig> was the rabbit igg, targeted to domain-ii-iv of fiz <dig> . anti-crx was an affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibody  targeting amino acids 119– <dig> of mouse crx   <cit> . the immunoprecipitates were recovered with protein a-sepharose , washed with pbs, 1% triton x- <dig>  and proteins subjected to sds-page and immunoblotting with the appropriate antibodies: anti-bfiz <dig>  or anti-crx . blots were visualized using the ecl plus detection reagents .

chromatin immuno-precipitation 
basic chip pcr assays were performed as described previously  <cit> . the mouse strains used were: c57bl/6j  referred to as wild-type, and c57bl/6j-pdebrd <dig> le/pdebrd <dig> le  referred to as "rodless/coneless"  <cit> . fiz <dig> associated chromatin was immunoprecipitated from wild-type retina using anti-bfiz <dig> antibody which is specific for fiz <dig> protein in immunoblots of mouse retina. chip dna was analyzed by pcr with primers targeting the proximal promoter regions of the following genes: rho, pde6b, m-opsin, s-opsin, rbp <dig>  and alb  <cit> . primer sequences are listed in the table  <dig>  input chromatin dna served as a positive control, while pre-immune serum, no antibody and no dna  samples served as negative controls. follow up chip assays compared fiz <dig> association with gene promoters in retinas from wild-type and rodless/coneless mice. the antibody was anti-fiz1-i, an affinity-purified rabbit igg that targets a conserved peptide  in domain-i , and detects the same band as anti-bfiz <dig> on immunoblots . chip dna was analyzed by pcr, targeting the several photoreceptor-specific promoters: rho, pde6b, m-opsin, s-opsin, and rbp <dig>  analysis included the mglur <dig> promoter, as a non-photoreceptor neuron control.

electrophoretic mobility shift assays 
emsa was performed with a gel-shift assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions . nuclear extracts from bovine retina were prepared as previously described  <cit> . short double-stranded oligonucleotides, for probes, were synthesized for three conserved cis-elements from the mammalian rhodopsin proximal promoter region that are known to bind nrl or crx: the nrl-response element, nre,  <cit> ; the crx-binding element, bat- <dig>   <cit> ; and the crx-binding element, ret- <dig>   <cit> . these probes were end-labeled with t <dig> polynucleotide kinase  and atp . 32p-labeled probes  were incubated with retinal nuclear extract  in binding buffer  for  <dig> minutes at 21°c. for competition controls, unlabeled  probe  was incubated with nuclear extracts for  <dig> minutes at room temperature before addition of 32p-labeled oligonucleotide. for fiz <dig> antigen-antibody tests, antibody to fiz <dig>  or control  was added after the incubation of 32p-labeled oligonucleotide with nuclear extracts. the samples were loaded on a pre-run  4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel  in  <dig> % tbe, at  <dig> volts for  <dig> hours. after electrophoresis, the gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film  for autoradiography.

yeast two-hybrid assay
the bait plasmid, phyblex/zeo-bfiz <dig> was prepared by sub-cloning domains ii-iv of bovine fiz <dig> into the phyblex/zeo vector . the pact2-bcrx vector provided expression of gal4-ad-crx protein. transformation of l <dig> yeast and interaction assays were previously described  <cit> . bait strains were prepared with the vectors: phyblex/zeo-bfiz <dig> , phyblex/zeo-laminin , and phyblex/zeo . bait strains were transformed with the desired prey-vector: pact2-bcrx  or pact <dig> .

gst pull-down assays
the bacterial expression plasmid, pdest15-bfiz ii-iv, for preparation of gst-bfiz <dig> on glutathione-sepharose was described previously  <cit> . for a gst control, pdest15-gst was utilized; a construct prepared by removal of fiz <dig> sequence from pdest15-bfiz ii-iv. 35s-crx was prepared using the tnt quick coupled transcription/translation kit  with 35s-methione  and pcdna <dig> /hisc-bcrx as template. gst pull-down assays were carried out as previously described using glutathione-sepharose-bound gst or gst-bfiz <dig> protein  in binding buffer . after washes, the bound proteins were denatured in  <dig> μl of 2× sds sample buffer , subjected to sds-page, and processed for fluorography .

m- and s-opsin promoter activation assays
transfection and promoter activation assays were performed as previously described  <cit> . cv <dig> cells  were incubated at 37°c, 5% co <dig>  in mem-alpha with 10% fbs, and penicillin/streptomycin. expression plasmids for bovine crx  and bovine fiz <dig>  were described previously  <cit> . the reporter, mop250-luc, contained the human m-opsin promoter  sub-cloned into the pgl3-basic vector   <cit> . the reporter sop552-luc, contained a mouse s-opsin minimal promoter  <cit>  sub-cloned into the pgl3-basic vector . transfection mixes contained  <dig> ng/ml  of a reporter plasmid  and  <dig> ng/ml of the renilla luciferase construct, prl-cmv . triplicate samples  were co-transfected with expression vectors for crx  and fiz <dig> . firefly- and renilla-luciferase activities were measured with dual-reporter luminescence reagent,  <dig> h post-transfection . experiments were repeated three times, and were analyzed independently using anova with tukey-kramer post-analysis  <cit> . fold activation was relative to the background with empty expression vectors, set as 1-fold.

quantitative chip  assays of fiz <dig> and pol-ii binding
q-chip was performed on normal p- <dig>  and p- <dig>  mouse retina to compare fiz <dig> association with the rho promoter . by p- <dig>  about 85% of rod photoreceptor cells have been "born", and express nrl and crx, but these immature neurons have not synthesized their phototransduction proteins or their outer-segment structures. an increase of fiz <dig> protein association with the rho proximal promoter region should result in a proportional increase in the amount of promoter dna fragments recovered by chip. real time pcr can be used for quantitative comparison of the dna recovered , and thus comparison of the amount of fiz <dig> binding  <cit> . a non-translated region of chromosome  <dig>  was included as a control. chip was performed with antibody to fiz <dig> . the active state of the rho gene was also measured by q-chip with an antibody to the phospho-serine- <dig> ctd  of rna-polymerase-ii . serine- <dig>  in the rna polymerase-ii ctd is phosphorylated in the transcriptionally active form of the enzyme  <cit> . furthermore, the target amplicon for the pol-ii-s <dig> q-chip assays was situated within intron-ii of the rho gene. this location is over  <dig> kb downstream of the rho promoter region, to ensure measurement of actively transcribing pol-ii. primers used for real-time pcr are listed in table  <dig>  amplicons were also placed to avoid highly repetitive dna sequences, as determined from mouse genomic data  <cit>  with the ucsc genome browser .

ct values from triplicate real-time pcr assays were transformed using a standard curve of genomic dna with known copy numbers, to obtain precipitated copy numbers for each gene test region. to determine the relative pcr efficiency, between different gene regions, triplicate assays were run using non-precipitated genomic dna . copy numbers of dna detected were then normalized for the amount of chromatin input, the proportion of chip dna used for q-pcr, and then for relative primer efficiency. final results were scaled as copies of dna detected per  <dig> cells .

RESULTS
tem-immunogold labeling of fiz <dig> in mature retinal neurons
to visualize the subcellular location of fiz <dig> in neural retina, transmission electron microscopy  with nano-gold labeling was performed on p- <dig> and p- <dig>  mouse neural retina. photoreceptors in the p- <dig> retina lack outer-segments and the increased expression of genes required for light detection and visual transduction  has just started at this time. retinal neurons are not mature at this time and synaptogenesis has not yet occurred. the retina becomes functional by p- <dig>  when rhodopsin content has almost reached its adult maximal level. outer segments  are present at this time, and continue to elongate slightly to about p- <dig>  fixation and the type of embedding resin were optimized to minimize the antigen masking that occurs in typical plastic embedding for tem-based morphology analysis. stage p- <dig> and p- <dig> neural retina samples were processed simultaneously throughout the complete procedure.

regions of the adult mouse neural retina are illustrated by the light micrographs in figure 1a, b. the ganglion cell layer , inner nuclear layer , and the outer nuclear layer  form the three major cell layers in the mature tissue. the photoreceptor inner segments  and outer segments  are restricted to the outer-most layer of the neural retina. note that rod photoreceptor nuclei in the onl are extremely compact compared to neurons of the inl and gcl. most of the photoreceptor nuclei represent rods, while about 3–5% are cones. rod nuclear cross-sectional areas are almost entirely densely staining chromatin. cone nuclei are localized on the outer-most edge of the onl layer, viewed here just below the is, and display a much smaller proportion of densely staining cross-sectional area in comparison to rod nuclei. examples of a rod  and cone  nucleus are indicated in a higher magnification in figure 1b.

nano-gold labeling of fiz <dig> protein was visualized by tem in the adult  retina . fiz <dig> protein was present in cell nuclei of the onl , inl and gcl layers. both rod and cone photoreceptor nuclei were positive for fiz <dig> labeling, which was throughout the nucleus . fiz <dig> was also detected in the inner-segment region of photoreceptors , but was absent from the outer-segments . fiz <dig> antibody also labeled cell nuclei in the gcl and inl . negative controls, using the same fiz <dig> antibody pre-blocked with a six-fold molar excess of antigen, displayed a loss of fiz <dig> labeling .

p- <dig> neural retina was processed simultaneously as a source of tissue that has at least 10-times lower endogenous fiz <dig> protein content compared to adult neural retina . consistent with this, the lower level of fiz <dig> at this stage of retinal development was not detectable with the nano-gold tem method as used. this was the case for neurons in all layers present: the gcl, inl and onl . photoreceptor inner and outer segments were not present at the p- <dig> stage of ocular development.

co-ip of fiz <dig> and crx from retinal nuclear extracts
to investigate if native fiz <dig> complexes with crx in neural retina, co-ip experiments were carried out with bovine retina nuclear extract. co-ip with the crx antibody identified a band corresponding to fiz <dig> . the full size gel format was used to separate fiz <dig> from the heavy igg band on immunoblots. co-ip with pre-immune serum served as a negative control and identified the igg heavy chain of the precipitating antibody. the reverse experiment was also performed, as co-ip with the fiz <dig> antibody, which identified a band corresponding to crx on mini-gel immunoblots .

chromatin immunoprecipitation of fiz <dig> at photoreceptor-specific gene promoters
to determine if fiz <dig> is present in the regulatory protein complex on the chromatin of photoreceptor genes in neural retina, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation  from wild type mouse retina with an antibody specific to fiz <dig> . results show that fiz <dig> is associated with the proximal promoter regions of several genes that are known targets of crx and nrl . these included the rho, pde6b, m-opsin, s-opsin, and rbp <dig>  gene promoters. control chip assays, minus antibody or minus input dna, were negative. additional negative controls with the pre-immune serum igg further demonstrated the specificity of the positive results obtained with the fiz1-antibody. assays did not detect any association of fiz <dig> on the liver specific alb  gene promoter.

to determine if the association of fiz <dig> with these gene promoters was specific to photoreceptor neurons, additional chip experiments were carried out using another antibody to fiz <dig>  that recognizes a conserved epitope sequence in domain-i of mouse, human and bovine fiz <dig> . neural retina tissue from two mouse strains, rodless/coneless and wild-type, were compared. rodless/coneless mouse retinas still possessed non-photoreceptor neurons of the inner nuclear layer  and the ganglion cell layer ; only the outer nuclear layer  was absent. fiz <dig> occupied the promoter regions of photoreceptor-specific genes in wild-type mice, but not in rodless/coneless mice . fiz <dig> did not occupy the promoter region of mglur <dig>  which is expressed in bipolar cells, in either retina type. these results suggest that fiz <dig> association with photoreceptor-specific gene promoters is specific to photoreceptor neurons.

fiz <dig> presence in nrl/crx protein complexes bound to their responsive dna motifs
to determine if fiz <dig> is part of retinal nuclear protein complexes that bind to dna elements recognized by nrl and crx, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays  using bovine retina nuclear protein extract and 32p-labeled probes derived from conserved nrl- or crx-responsive elements from the mammalian rho proximal promoter region  <cit> . previous emsa results showed that bovine nuclear extracts produced two major shifted bands on a probe containing the nrl-response element   <cit> . the nre probe sequence and the nrl binding site are shown in figure 5-a. in our assay, this probe was shifted in a characteristic pattern as previously published <cit> . the higher shifted dna-protein complex known to contain nrl <cit>  was efficiently removed by incubation with affinity-purified antibody  specific for fiz <dig> , after complexes were allowed to form . control igg  did not remove any of the native protein-dna complexes. as previously seen by rehemtulla et al.,  <dig>  competition with cold probe was more effective on diminishing the higher shifted complex. these results suggest that fiz <dig> is a part of the nrl protein complex bound to nre.

likewise, emsa was performed with two other probes, bat- <dig> and ret- <dig>  <cit> , derived from the rho promoter containing core sequences bound by the crx homeodomain  . bat- <dig> has two elements that closely match the consensus binding sites for the k50-type hd   <cit> , while ret- <dig> has only one low affinity site for crx. our emsa assays with both of these probes produced characteristic patterns reported previously with recombinant crx-hd  <cit> .

direct interaction of fiz <dig> with crx
since proteins known to complex with photoreceptor-specific promoters display multiple protein interactions, we wanted to determine if fiz <dig> is capable of direct binding to crx. we used two different methods: yeast two-hybrid and gst pull-down assays. using the yeast two-hybrid method, l <dig> yeast cells were sequentially transformed with the desired bait- and prey-vector combinations. potential protein interactions were evaluated with two interaction reporters: growth on minus-his medium  and expression of β-galactosidase . double transformants with lexa-bfiz <dig> + gal4ad-bcrx were positive for interaction by growth on minus-his plates and by β-galactosidase filter lift assay. control combinations for non-specific interactions were negative with both reporters .

gst pull-down assays confirmed the direct interaction of fiz <dig> and crx . 35s-crx was tested for binding to glutathione-sepharose-gst-bfiz <dig> compared to the glutathione-sepharose-gst control. assays contained equivalent amounts of gst and gst-bfiz <dig>  35s-crx bound to glutathione-sepharose-gst-bfiz <dig> when compared to glutathione-sepharose-gst.

fiz <dig> interaction potentiates crx-mediated promoter activation
to determine if fiz <dig> interaction with crx could have any effect upon crx-mediated activation of a test promoter, we employed a co-transfection luciferase-reporter assay system. two test promoters were selected that represent photoreceptor-specific promoters that are capable of activation by crx alone  <cit> . cv- <dig> cells were transfected with m- or s-opsin reporter plasmids  and expression plasmids for nrl, crx and fiz <dig>  fiz <dig> significantly altered the crx-mediated activation of both test promoters. for the m-opsin promoter, crx alone caused a  <dig> -fold activation relative to empty vectors  . neither fiz <dig> nor nrl alone had significant effect compared to empty vectors. fiz <dig> combined with crx increased the activation of the m-opsin promoter, to 6-fold, relative to empty vectors . the effect was to more than double crx's activation potential.

crx alone activated the s-opsin promoter 7-fold  . fiz <dig> and nrl alone had no significant effect. as for the m-opsin test promoter, fiz <dig> combined with crx more than doubled crx's activation of the test promoter .

association of fiz <dig> with the rhodopsin gene correlates to the increased presence of transcriptionally active rna polymerase-ii in vivo
chip results indicated that fiz <dig> is present at several photoreceptor-specific promoters in vivo; therefore, we next asked if the quantity of fiz <dig> present at the rho promoter is increased in adult neural retina  compared to p <dig> neural retina? rho is a fundamental marker of photoreceptor maturation; therefore, q-chip analysis was performed to compare the binding of both fiz <dig> and actively transcribing rna-polymerase-ii  at the rho gene. fiz <dig> chip amplicons targeted the rho proximal promoter region, while pol-ii-s <dig> chip amplicons targeted a site within intron- <dig> of the gene.

the relative quantity of fiz <dig>  associated with the regulatory protein complex on the rho promoter, was significantly elevated  in p- <dig> neural retina compared to p- <dig> neural retina . fiz <dig> association with this regulatory complex was significantly higher than for the untranslated control region  in both p- <dig> and p- <dig> neural retina. in this untranslated control region, there was no difference in the relative association of fiz <dig> comparing p- <dig> to p- <dig> neural retina.

the relative binding of transcriptionally active rna polymerase-ii , monitored at a position about  <dig> kb downstream from the rho transcriptional start site, was significantly higher in the mature neural retina. pol-ii-s <dig> association was 23-fold higher on chromatin from p- <dig> neural retina compared to p- <dig> neural retina . there was no significant difference in the association of pol-ii-s <dig> in the untranslated control region  comparing p- <dig> to p- <dig> neural retina.

discussion
several lines of initial evidence have suggested that the fiz <dig> protein can exist in both the cell's nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments in cultured cells and in neural retina  <cit> . we desired to visualize fiz <dig> location in the neural retina at the subcellular level. current improvements to tem-immunogold techniques, particularly the use of smaller nano-gold antibody conjugates and silver-enhancement, provide clear visualization of nano-gold particles and lower background in electron micrographs of mammalian retina  <cit> . ultra-thin sections also expose the dense chromatin matrix of the very compact nuclei of photoreceptor cells in the outer-nuclear layer.

nano-gold tem micrographs show that fiz <dig> protein is present in the nuclei of all mature neurons in the ganglion, inner-nuclear and outer-nuclear layers . this included nuclei of both rod and cone photoreceptors. labeling of fiz <dig> was present throughout the entire area of photoreceptor nuclei. while previous immunofluorescence study showed a distribution of nrl throughout rod-photoreceptor nuclei in human retina  <cit> , the photoreceptors of nocturnal species  have compact nuclei with an inverted pattern of chromatin density. in mouse, dense chromatin fills the central nucleus, leaving lower density chromatin at the periphery. evidence is mounting that this periphery corresponds to euchromatin, where active photoreceptor-specific genes are located. fluorescent labeling of the mouse rho gene has demonstrated a location in the periphery of most photoreceptor nuclei  <cit> .

some immunohistochemistry reports show detection of crx throughout photoreceptor nuclei   <cit> , while immunofluorescence labeling with confocal imaging shows an intense peripheral labeling for crx  <cit> . immunofluorescence of nr2e <dig> in the mouse retina also shows an intense labeling in the nuclear periphery  <cit> . mice expressing a fusion protein of gfp with otx <dig>  another transriptional activator present in photoreceptors, display a ring-like distribution of the gfp tag in their photoreceptors  <cit> . it is clear that this region correlates with the expression of active genes in mouse photoreceptors.

recent reports also indicate that nrl and crx have roles in the transcriptional repression of cone-specific genes in addition to their roles as transcriptional activators of rod-specific genes. the ectopic expression of nrl in mouse cone progenitors, results in the conversion of cone-precursors to rod photoreceptors  <cit> . crx is also present on cone-opsin promoters in rod photoreceptor cells, and nr2e <dig> inhibits the crx-mediated activation of cone-opsin promoters, in vitro <cit> . the later could explain why nr2e <dig> deficient mice develop extra cone-opsin expressing photoreceptors in the form of hybrid cone-rod photoreceptors  <cit> . as such, nrl and crx, two transcription factors that can bind fiz <dig>  could recruit fiz <dig> to both euchromatin and heterochromatin regions of mouse photoreceptors.

significant labeling of fiz <dig> was also present in the inner segments of photoreceptors in mature retina. the packing of photoreceptor cells to high density is facilitated by the location of ribosomes and mitochondria in the inner-segments. as the location for much of the protein synthesis in photoreceptors, many proteins should be present in this region. we did not detect fiz <dig> by immunogold staining in ultra thin sections of p- <dig> retina, which is likely due to the low sensitivity of this particular technique and a much lower level of fiz <dig> protein in p- <dig> retina. this is consistent with previous findings, showing that fiz <dig> concentration in immature neural retina is less than 10% of that found in the mature tissue  <cit> . the inability to detect this lower level of fiz <dig> does not indicate that fiz <dig> is absent. the more sensitive q-chip analysis confirmed this. fiz <dig> association with the rho promoter at p- <dig> was much lower than at p-25; however, the level of fiz <dig> at p- <dig> was detectable above the background, as represented by an untranslated control region on the same chromosome .

previously we have shown that fiz <dig> could alter activation of a rho test-promoter, suggesting that fiz <dig> could have some direct or indirect interactions with crx in addition to nrl  <cit> . crx is present in all rod and cone photoreceptors, placing fiz <dig> in a biologically relevant location for interaction with crx. our co-ip experiments from bovine retina nuclear extract, confirmed that native fiz <dig> and crx could be isolated as part of the same nuclear protein complex. co-ip with antibody to fiz <dig> captured crx from nuclear protein preparations. conversely, antibody to crx co-precipitated fiz <dig> 

peng and chen  have reported that nrl, crx and nr2e <dig> are part of the transcriptional complex on several photoreceptor-specific genes in vivo, including rho, pde6b, rbp <dig>  m-opsin and s-opsin  <cit> . our chromatin immunoprecipitation results indicated that fiz <dig> is also associated with the proximal promoter regions of these genes. our results here, and those previously reported, indicate that fiz <dig> can alter the activation potential of nrl and/or crx at four of these promoters in vitro: rho, pde6b, m-opsin, and s-opsin. additionally, chip analysis found that fiz <dig> occupies the regulatory complex of photoreceptor-specific genes in wild-type retina, but not in rodless/coneless mice . this result indicates that fiz <dig> recruitment to the regulatory protein complex at photoreceptor-specific genes is an event specific to adult photoreceptors. while fiz <dig> is present in bipolar and ganglion cells, it is not associated with photoreceptor-specific gene promoters in these neurons.

our emsa results indicate that fiz <dig> is also a component of retinal nuclear protein complexes that can bind to the nrl-binding element , and the two crx-binding elements . nrl binds to an extended ap- <dig> like element, the nre, in the rho gene's proximal promoter region  <cit> . the crx homeodomain can bind to two promoter elements, bat- <dig> and ret- <dig>  that flank the nre  <cit> . historically, the ret- <dig> element was used in a yeast 1-hybrid survey to discover crx from a bovine retina library  <cit> .

rehemtulla et al., demonstrated that the nre probe is shifted into two major complexes with bovine nuclear protein extract, and the higher shifted complex can be removed by antibody to nrl  <cit> . in our tests here, fiz <dig> antibody was also able to remove the larger probe/protein complex. while this element is relatively short and will be covered by nrl, stable protein-protein interactions could involve non-dna binding proteins in the overall complex. fiz <dig> is capable of direct and stable interaction with nrl in vitro; therefore, fiz <dig> may associate with the nre element indirectly through its interaction with nrl. this would be consistent with the fact that the higher shifted band, diminished by incubation with antibody to fiz <dig>  is also disrupted by antibody to nrl  <cit> .

similarly, it is conceivable for fiz <dig> to associate indirectly with crx-binding sites  by association with crx. bat- <dig> has two core elements that can bind the k50-type hd of crx  <cit> . consistent with the presence of two potential binding sites, chen et al., have demonstrated that the bat- <dig> probe can be shifted into two major bands by recombinant crx-hd  <cit> . the bat- <dig> site is crucial for crx mediated activation of the rhodopsin proximal promoter  <cit> .

here, using bovine retina nuclear extract, two major shifted bands were also seen, similar to the pattern reported for recombinant crx-hd. it is possible that these major shifted bands represent the association of one and two molecules of crx. in our case, a third higher shifting faint band was removed after complex formation by treatment with fiz <dig> antibody, while the two major bands remained. this suggests fiz <dig> was not required for formation of the smaller complexes.

in contrast to bat- <dig>  the ret- <dig> probe contains one k50-type hd binding element, and shifts to a doublet band with bovine retina nuclear extract  <cit> . our emsa here, with bovine retina nuclear extract, also resulted in a single major shifted complex. this intense band was efficiently removed by fiz <dig> antibody, suggesting the presence of fiz <dig>  the disruption of only a higher shifting faint band with the bat- <dig> probe, suggests that there could also be a different affinity for fiz <dig> between a crx dimer and monomer. this is interesting in the context of the rho promoter, where the potential crx-dimer binding site  and the monomer-binding site  flank the nre site.

what could be the benefit of two different crx-binding sites in such a small region? there is evidence that several other proteins interact with crx at the rho promoter, including nrl, nr2e <dig> and baf  <cit> . two crx binding elements, binding in different stoichiometry, may provide a mechanism to have different crx molecules participating in different protein interactions.

our co-ip and emsa results indicated that fiz <dig> might interact directly with crx; therefore we explored this with yeast two-hybrid and gst pull-down assays. both assay methods confirmed the ability for a direct and stable interaction of fiz <dig> and crx in vitro. this suggests that fiz <dig> has at least two interaction partners in photoreceptor neurons  that could recruit it into transcription factor complexes on photoreceptor specific genes. multiple protein-protein interactions are consistent with our knowledge of other proteins that complex at the rho promoter. crx participates in interactions with nrl and nr2e <dig>  resulting in activation of rod genes and repression of cone genes  <cit> . nr2e <dig> also has multiple interactions, including crx and the circadian clock protein nr1d <dig>  <cit> .

while we previously demonstrated that fiz <dig> could modify nrl's transactivation potential at a pde6b test promoter, it only modified transactivation potential at the rho promoter when both nrl and crx were present  <cit> . to examine fiz <dig> effect on crx, we used two test promoters that are activated by crx, but not nrl: m- and s-opsin  <cit> . alone, fiz <dig> effect on the activation of either promoter was insignificant compared to empty vectors. however, fiz <dig> was able to modify crx's transactivation potential at both test promoters by over 100% of the activity seen with crx alone. it is possible that fiz1's presence could influence the overall activation potential of promoter complexes involving crx.

the scale of fiz1's effect on crx-mediated activation is biologically significant. mature photoreceptors must continue to precisely regulate the average expression of genes like rho to maintain viable photoreceptors. in mouse neural retina, rhodopsin mrna levels vary at least 25% in a circadian fashion, to coordinate with the rhythm of outer-segment formation  <cit> . heterozygous knockout of rho reduces its average expression by 50%, which results in a slow degeneration of photoreceptors. likewise, transgenic mice with elevated expression of normal rhodopsin, also have a slow photoreceptor degeneration  <cit> .

developmentally, the increased availability of fiz <dig> does concur with maturation of the neural retina and the activation of many photoreceptor-specific genes. while mrnas for m- and s-opsin are detected a few days earlier than for rho  <cit> , the initial formation of photoreceptor outer-segments of both rods and cones begins in the maturation period. this increases the demand for all three opsin proteins as well as pde6b, arrestin, and other phototransduction proteins.

test promoters are not perfect models for native gene promoters in their chromatin context, and fiz <dig> can promote or inhibit nrl/crx mediated activation of the rho promoter in vitro, depending on the relative amount of fiz <dig> compared to nrl and crx  <cit> . with this in mind, it would be premature to state unequivocally whether fiz1's role is that of promoting activation of these promoters in vivo, or if it may have a role in maintaining a precise level of their expression in the mature retina.

our chip analysis indicates that fiz <dig> is part of the regulatory protein complex on genes that become more active in adult photoreceptors. rho is a fundamental marker of photoreceptor-specific gene expression; its expression increases dramatically as photoreceptor neurons mature to the adult state  <cit> . is there an increase in the relative quantity of fiz <dig> recruited to the rho promoter complex in the adult retina? this would be expected if a prior association of nrl and crx recruits fiz <dig>  relative association of fiz <dig> at the rho promoter region was 7-fold greater in adult neural retina , as compared to the immature tissue  when only a small fraction of photoreceptor precursors are starting to express rho.

the increased association of fiz <dig> at the rho promoter also correlated with a 23-fold increase in the amount of actively transcribing pol-ii in adult neural retina  compared to the immature tissue . the total pol-ii associated with the rho proximal-promoter region increases during maturation of the mouse retina  <cit> . while the presence of pol-ii in the promoter region often correlates to transcription, it is possible for a gene to be pre-loaded with inactive pol-ii, as recently reported for many genes in human embryonic stem cells  <cit> . our assays here specifically monitored actively transcribing pol-ii  in intron- <dig>  about  <dig> kb downstream of the rhodopsin gene's transcription start site.

the increased expression of several photoreceptor genes, during maturation of photoreceptors, certainly involves regulation at the level of transcription. rhodopsin and arrestin mrna levels increase dramatically during this process, and this is documented in mammalian species that complete retinal development postnatal  or prenatal   <cit> . a previous study of bovine retinal development, using nuclear run-on assays, suggested that elevated transcription has a prominent role during this maturation period  <cit> . our quantitative measurement of transcriptionally active pol-ii within the rho's transcript region, confirms that the amount of activated pol-ii enzyme is elevated.

CONCLUSIONS
recently, peng and chen  demonstrated that crx and nrl are not present on the rhodopsin promoter until the start of rho expression, even though both transcription factors are abundant in rod-precursors before this time  <cit> . this suggests that additional factors are involved with the formation of a stable regulatory protein complex on these promoters as the retina matures to the adult state. our results suggest that fiz <dig> is one of the additional proteins recruited by nrl and crx to these transcription factor complexes, and both its bioavailability and association at the rho promoter are increased substantially as the neural retina matures. while fiz <dig> does not appear to be a direct transcriptional activator, it can significantly alter the crx-mediated activation of cone opsin promoters in vitro.

in a mouse hematopoietic cell line, engineered to over express flt- <dig>  and fiz <dig>  fiz <dig> association with flt- <dig> was reported to increase upon receptor activation. while the downstream consequences are not known, those studies also found fiz <dig> to be present in both the cytoplasm and nucleus  <cit> . our results here showing fiz <dig> recruitment to gene promoter complexes, suggest a potential role in signal transduction between receptors and genes. while the expression of fiz <dig> is ubiquitous in mammals, the reported interactions thus far are tissue specific. additional tissue-specific interactions await discovery for organs not yet explored regarding fiz <dig> function. the data gathered so far justifies the production of animal models for over and under expression of fiz <dig>  which will be required to explore its tissue-specific functions.

q-chip was successfully applied to neural retina tissue to directly detect an increase in the transcriptionally active form of rna-polymerase-ii moving through rho's transcriptional region. this analysis provides a novel way to directly quantify the activation state of a gene in the context of neural development, and is applicable to any gene of interest. finally, we note that the presence of fiz <dig> in the nuclei of all mature retinal neurons suggests that fiz <dig> may also be recruited to non-photoreceptor specific genes that become active in the adult retina. further studies to find more target genes for the fiz <dig> protein will shed light on this possibility.
