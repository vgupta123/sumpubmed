BACKGROUND
enterococci are part of the human gastrointestinal tract microbiota but some species within the genus are also significant opportunistic nosocomial pathogens  <cit> . enterococcal infections can be difficult to treat because of their intrinsic and acquired resistance to many classes of antibiotics, including what are often considered last-line agents such as vancomycin and daptomycin  <cit> . the difficulties associated with treatment, coupled with the risk of cross transmission to other patients, make enterococcal infections a significant infection control issue in hospitals  <cit> .

enterococci that are resistant to vancomycin are collectively referred to as vancomycin-resistant enterococci   <cit> . vancomycin resistance is conferred by the presence of one of nine different gene clusters, although the majority of vre strains possess either the vana or vanb operon  <cit> . enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis are the two enterococci most frequently causing human infections, however vancomycin resistance has become increasingly common predominately in e. faecium, in the past two decades  <cit> . the first reported cases of vre occurred in europe and the uk in the 1980s and vre has since been reported in hospitals worldwide  <cit> . in australia, the first known case of vre was reported at the austin hospital in  <dig>  <cit> . vre has since emerged australia-wide and a number of australian hospitals have experienced vre outbreaks, predominantly involving colonization in the clinical environment  <cit> . in contrast to the united states where vana-type resistance predominates, vanb-type vancomycin resistant e. faecium are the most important cause of vre infections in australia  <cit> .

molecular epidemiology of e. faecium has been based primarily on pulsed field gel electrophoresis  and multi-locus sequence typing   <cit> . mlst has revealed the emergence of related lineages called clonal complex  <dig> , which comprise strains associated with hospital infections across at least five continents  <cit> . many of these hospital strains have acquired resistance to ampicillin and quinolones, and their genomes contain a high number of mobile genetic elements that distinguish them from community-acquired and non-pathogenic strains  <cit> .

we have previously reported on a significant increase in cases of e. faecium bacteraemia at a major australian hospital. mlst of the e. faecium isolates collected from bacteraemic patients over a 12-year period revealed a replacement of cc <dig> sequence type  <dig>  strains, with emergent cc <dig> st <dig> isolates  <cit> . a survey evaluating the incidence of vre and vancomycin-susceptible enterococci  in australia from  <dig> to  <dig>  conducted by the australian group on antimicrobial resistance  in collaboration with participating microbiology labs, showed a marked increase in vre rates throughout australia. reflecting the very same trends observed at austin health, the majority of these australian vre strains not only possessed the vanb gene but were also st <dig>  <cit> . in our initial study we compared partially assembled genome sequences for representative st <dig>  and st <dig>  vre isolates and showed  <dig> kb of unique dna differentiating the two  <cit> . we also recently established and analysed the complete genome sequence of e. faecium st <dig> aus <dig> as a basis for a more thorough genome comparison  <cit> .

in this current study, genome and phenotype comparisons were performed to explore in more detail the differences between  <dig> st <dig> and  <dig> st <dig> e. faecium isolates to help explain the emergence of st <dig> and its success as an opportunistic hospital pathogen. we fully assembled and annotated the genome of e. faecium st <dig> aus <dig>  the first complete st <dig> reference sequence, and compared it with the recently fully assembled and annotated genomes of st <dig> aus <dig> and st <dig> isolate tx <dig>  <cit> . growth rates and biofilm formation were also measured for a collection of st <dig> and st <dig> isolates, and virulence was assessed in the greater wax moth  invertebrate model.

RESULTS
enterococcus faecium aus <dig> genome summary
the genome of e. faecium aus <dig> is comprised of a single circular chromosome  with a gc content of  <dig> %,  <dig>  protein-coding dna sequences ,  <dig> trna genes, and  <dig> rrna operons. comparisons of an in silico ncoi map of the fully-assembled aus <dig> chromosome sequence against the aus <dig> ncoi optical map confirmed the accuracy of the chromosome assembly . aus <dig> also harbors six circular plasmids, aus0085_p <dig>  aus0085_p <dig>  aus0085_p <dig>  aus0085_p <dig>  aus0085_p <dig> and aus0085_p <dig>  with lengths of  <dig>  bp,  <dig>  bp,  <dig>  bp,  <dig>  bp,  <dig>  bp,  <dig>  bp respectively.

comparative genomics of aus <dig> e. faecium
the chromosome features for st <dig> e. faecium aus <dig> were compared with st <dig> e. faecium aus <dig> and another recently closed e. faecium genome, tx <dig> . chromosome alignments indicated significant conservation of genome architecture between the three isolates. the large chromosome inversion seen in aus <dig> is not present in aus <dig> and tx <dig> . dna comparisons and ortholog cluster analysis showed that e. faecium aus <dig> possesses at least  <dig> chromosomal segments spanning approximately  <dig> kb that are not present in both aus <dig> and tx <dig>  and an additional four regions spanning  <dig> kb that are absent in aus <dig> but present in tx <dig>  these aus <dig> ‘specific’ regions include four distinct prophage, and loci involved in metabolic functions such as carbohydrate utilization and metal ion transport. a complete list of aus <dig> genes not present in aus <dig> or tx <dig> is provided see .

to refine this comparative analysis, whole genome sequence reads obtained from an additional  <dig> st <dig> and  <dig> st <dig> previously described hospital isolates were mapped to the aus <dig> chromosome. seven distinct regions of difference were identified, spanning  <dig> kb and  <dig> genes found in all  <dig> st <dig> isolates but absent from the st <dig> collection . the majority of these genes encoded proteins with functions related to metabolism including riboflavin biosynthesis , gene regulation , metal ion transport  and phosphotransferase systems  .

read-mapping also permitted delineation of a core genome, revealing  <dig> , <dig> bases,  that were present in all  <dig> e. faecium genomes. pairwise comparisons of the aus <dig> core genome sequence with the core genomes of the other isolates uncovered  <dig> variable nucleotide positions . a distance matrix was prepared and a robust phylogeny was inferred by both split decomposition analysis and neighbor-joining methods that highlighted the substantial nucleotide differences between st <dig> and st <dig> isolates . a reticulated phylogeny was observed by split decomposition, indicating likely recombination among this collection of e. faecium . these substantial clone-specific differences were then confirmed by independent in silico analysis. de novo assembly with gene and protein prediction of the  <dig> e. faecium genomes , followed by ortholog clustering that also included aus <dig> and aus <dig> based on mlst category, confirmed the same  <dig> st203-specific genes as identified by read-mapping . the two mlst groups shared  <dig> genes, while there were  <dig> genes specific to the st <dig> isolates .

*indicates strains that are vancomycin-susceptible isolates, which therefore do not possess the van operon.

the aus <dig> genome is largely comprised of mobile genetic elements
like aus <dig> and tx <dig>  a large proportion of the genome for aus <dig> is comprised of mobile genetic elements. a total of  <dig> insertion sequence elements , representing twenty different types of ises, were identified. the copy numbers of the ises varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  the most frequently occurring ise differed between aus <dig>  and aus <dig> . four distinct prophage were identified in aus <dig> including, phienfa <dig> , phienfa <dig> , phienfa <dig>  and phienfa <dig> . the aus <dig> prophage are distinct to the prophage regions present in aus <dig> and tx <dig>  although as demonstrated in figure 1c, many of the cds that make up phienfa <dig> also appear in the other two genomes, which suggests this prophage is reasonably conserved. interestingly, the two crispr-associated proteins present in the prophages phienfa <dig> and phienfa <dig> in aus <dig> are not present in aus <dig>  and no other crispr loci were detected in aus <dig> 

the tn1549-like vanb-containing transposon in aus <dig> is distinct from aus0004
a single copy of a tn1549-like transposon, encoding vanb-type vancomycin resistance, was present in the aus <dig> chromosome, inserted within a signal peptidase i gene  between nucleotide positions 723825– <dig>  which is different from the insertion site in aus <dig> . comparisons of tn <dig> between aus <dig> and aus <dig> revealed a conserved  <dig> kb core . however, tn <dig> in aus <dig> is significantly larger, containing an additional  <dig>  kb with  <dig> cds that appear to encode another conjugative transfer system . when tn <dig> excises from its chromosomal location, it can take 4– <dig> bp of flanking sequence from the donor dna that is then incorporated in the recipient at the site of insertion  <cit> . different donor sequences  were observed between aus <dig> and aus <dig>  which together with the different form of tn <dig> indicate a different source of this transposon for each isolate . the van locus in aus <dig> was differentiated from the aus <dig> version by  <dig> non-conservative amino acid substitutions that may impact function located within the histidine kinase domain of vans  and the n-terminal substrate-binding domain of vanb . interestingly, the vancomycin minimal inhibitory concentration  for aus <dig> was  <dig> mg/l compared with  <dig> mg/l for aus <dig> 

additional plasmids in aus <dig> contribute to the aus0085-specific genome
aus <dig> harbors six plasmids, compared to three plasmids in aus <dig>  the increased number of plasmids adds an additional  <dig> kb to the aus <dig> genome, with plasmid sizes ranging from  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  kb. table  <dig> contains a summary of the predicted functions of plasmid cds. comparisons of the plasmid sequences in aus <dig> against the genome sequences from other enterococci show that the majority of sequence and cds in the aus <dig> plasmids are also present in plasmids from e. faecium , e. faecalis and other enterococcal species as well as other species from other genera such as staphylococcus and streptococcus. plasmid comparisons between aus <dig> and aus <dig> reveal that aus0085_p <dig> is highly related  to aus0004_p <dig>  a  <dig>  kb plasmid present in aus <dig>  although aus0085_p <dig> is  <dig>  kb longer. additionally, aus0085_p <dig> is closely related to aus0004_p <dig>  the smallest plasmid aus0085_p <dig> , which has no other cds other than that encoding the replication initiation protein, possesses three regions  that share significant sequence identity  to the cryptic plasmid pri <dig>  <cit> .

*f.o.i features of interest.

a total of  <dig> cds, which represents one-third of the cds that makes up the  <dig> kb plasmid sequence in aus <dig>  are not present in aus <dig>  and some of these genes are candidates to explain the growth and antimicrobial susceptibility differences between st <dig> and st <dig> isolates. with the exception of efau085_p <dig>  which encodes a hypothetical protein that is found only in aus <dig>  all the other aus <dig> cds that do not appear in aus <dig> are present in the genomes belonging to other e. faecium isolates or other enterococcal species. among the plasmid cds that have been assigned a function, several encode important features that enhance the survival of aus <dig>  notably, the aade-sat4-apha gene cluster, reported in a number of multidrug-resistant e. faecium and e. faecalis strains, is present on plasmid aus0085_p <dig>  the genes in the aade-sat4-apha cluster confer resistance to three different antibiotics, streptomycin, streptothricin and kanamycin, respectively  <cit> . however, sat <dig> is disrupted by an ise  and is therefore unlikely to be functional. the aade and apha genes are intact. streptomycin mics differed as predicted between aus <dig> and aus <dig>  with values of  <dig> mg/l and  <dig> mg/l respectively.

other aus <dig> plasmid cds that encode important features that are absent in aus <dig> include a pts-lactose uptake system  on aus0085_p <dig>  a bacterial extracellular solute-binding protein on aus0085_p <dig> and additional toxin-antitoxin systems on plasmids aus0085_p <dig> and aus0085_p <dig>  interestingly, aus0085_p <dig> possesses a citrate lyase complex , which has been previously described in various firmicutes including e. faecium and e. faecalis <cit> . however, this locus may be non-functional as citc and citg are predicted pseudogenes. additionally, the other auxiliary genes required for producing an active citrate lyase appear to be absent from aus0085_p <dig> 

cds associated with virulence
the same putative enterococcal virulence factors identified in aus <dig> were also present in aus <dig>  while the sequences of the genes encoding hemolysin  and collagen-binding adhesin  were nearly identical to the corresponding genes in aus <dig> . the enterococcal surface protein  encodes a  <dig> aa protein with a likely role in colonization  <cit> . the aus <dig> esp gene  has an additional  <dig> bp representing an extra copy of one of its 3′ tandem repeats compared to the aus <dig> ortholog.

bacteriocins are small protein pore-forming toxins produced by certain bacteria that can prevent the growth of closely related strains  <cit> . we therefore compared the bacteriocin gene content of aus <dig> with aus <dig> to see if additional bacterioicin-like genes might explain the emergence of aus <dig>  however genome comparisons showed no novel bacteriocins in aus <dig> and both isolates shared the same complement of three bacteriocin genes , although their genome location varied. for example a gene encoding a lactococcin 972-like protein is present on aus <dig> plasmid p <dig>  but on the chromosome in aus <dig> .

e. faecium st <dig> isolates grow more quickly than st17
to determine whether there were any differences in growth rates between different isolates, which might be linked to the additional metabolic genes or the lactose metabolism pathway identified in the genome for st203-representative strain aus <dig>  we conducted growth curve experiments to compare doubling times between the st <dig> and st <dig> strains. exponential phase doubling times were calculated and a significant difference  was observed between st <dig>  and st <dig> isolates  . the doubling times for the two sequenced strains were not different; aus <dig> possessed an average doubling time of  <dig>  minutes while average doubling time for aus <dig> was  <dig>  minutes.

e. faecium st <dig> aus <dig> and aus <dig> out-competes st17
we next took advantage of the high-level gentamicin resistance of aus <dig> and aus <dig> and performed co-culture experiments to assess whether these representative st <dig> isolates could outcompete st <dig> isolates. as indicated by the relative competitive fitness index  , both st <dig> isolates out-competed the st <dig> isolates, aus <dig> and aus <dig>  by approximately the same factor. statistical analysis showed all comparisons were significantly higher than the threshold rcfi value of  <dig>  aus <dig>  aus <dig> and aus <dig> possessed similar doubling times of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  minutes respectively. however, compared to the other strains, aus <dig> took, on average, two hours longer to reach stationary phase, and aus <dig> had a significantly faster doubling time of  <dig>  minutes.

biofilm formation is not an e. faecium clone-specific trait
the ability of e. faecium to form biofilms is thought to be an important phenotype with respect to virulence traits such as colonization, environmental persistence and antibiotic resistance  <cit> . we therefore performed biofilm assays to determine whether a difference in biofilm formation abilities distinguished the two st clones. three e. faecium st <dig> strains aus <dig>  aus <dig> and aus <dig> showed enhanced biofilm-forming capacity compared to the other isolates  but no relationship with sequence type was observed .

virulence is a heterogeneous phenotype in both the st <dig> and st <dig> strains
we examined survival rates of g. mellonella larvae after inoculation with st <dig> and st <dig> e. faecium. the kaplan meier plots were analysed to compare virulence between isolates see . based on observations made during the experiments, isolates were considered virulent if all larvae within a group died within three days of inoculation. virulence varied independent of sequence type . however, excluding aus <dig>  which exhibited small colony variant morphology, the st <dig> strains isolated from  <dig> onwards, killed g. mellonella larvae within three days. larvae inoculated with small colony variant strains aus <dig>  aus <dig> and aus <dig> exhibited increased survival rates. the number of bacteria present in the larvae at the time of death was also quantified, with values ranging from  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/ml to  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/ml. substantial variations were observed in cfu, even in larvae that had been inoculated with the same isolate, suggesting that differences in growth between different sequence types does not explain the rate at which the larvae are killed.

discussion
nosocomial outbreaks of e. faecium are now dominated by st <dig> in australia, and this st has also been responsible for nosocomial outbreaks in germany and china  <cit> . however, surprisingly little is known about this group of clones or why it emerged almost simultaneously in several hospitals and australian states. additionally, the apparent shift from st <dig> e. faecium to st <dig> observed at the austin hospital is reflected in a previous study that examined the population structure of e. faecium. hospital isolates can be categorized into two groups   <cit> , with st <dig> isolates belonging to bap3- <dig> and st <dig> isolates belonging to bap2- <dig>  these observations correlate with the trends observed at the austin hospital and in hospitals around australia, where strains belonging to bap3- <dig> dominated from  <dig> to  <dig>  and have been replaced with bap2- <dig> isolates from  <dig> onwards  <cit> .

in this report, we have fully assembled and annotated the genome of strain aus <dig>  to our knowledge, this is the first complete st <dig> e. faecium genome sequence. comparisons with the only two other complete e. faecium genomes, st <dig> aus <dig> and st <dig> tx <dig>  were performed to understand the genetic basis behind the emergence and increase in st <dig> vre. comparative analysis revealed  <dig> kb of sequence present only in aus <dig>  these regions of difference spanned eight chromosomal segments in aus <dig>  and four of the six plasmids harbored by this isolate. genome comparisons were extended to a collection of st <dig> and st <dig> isolates and this reduced the amount of st <dig> ‘unique’ dna to six chromosome regions. inferred functions from genes within these regions suggest additional metabolic capabilities for the st <dig> strains, particularly in carbohydrate utilization and metal ion transport. additional st203-unique metabolic genes include a riboflavin biosynthesis gene, dihydrofolate reductase and a fructose phosphotransferase system . pts are numerous in both gram-positive and negative bacteria, and facilitate the transport, uptake and metabolism of carbohydrates. a recent functional study showed that deletion of e. faecium ptsd, which encodes a sugar-specific membrane-associated eiid subunit of a pts gene cluster common to hospital isolates and absent in commensal isolates, compromises the ability of e. faecium to colonise the intestinal tract of mice under antibiotic treatment  <cit> . the results from this study and our observations here, showing two putative pts loci present in all st <dig> but absent from st <dig> , underscore the likely important contributions of pts systems , as well as other metabolic functions, in defining the success of a strain within a host and possibly the clinical environment.

approximately 24% of the aus0085-specific genes  are found on the six plasmids, highlighting the importance of these elements in shaping the aus <dig> genome and the potential for their transmission to other clinical e. faecium isolates. aus0085_p <dig> possesses genes with predicted lactose functions that might allow for utilization of alternative carbohydrate sources. enterococci in humans and other animals colonize the gastrointestinal tract and consequently, they compete with the gut microbiota for nutrients and resources  <cit> . the presence of additional metabolism genes might therefore confer a survival and growth advantage to st <dig> in this environment. a functional genomic study recently conducted investigating carbohydrate metabolism in streptococcus pneumoniae revealed a 20-minute increase in doubling time in a lactose pts system mutant, suggesting that the additional lactose utilization pathway in aus <dig> might similarly promote the growth of st <dig>  <cit> . plasmid aus0085_p <dig> possesses an intact version of the aade and apha genes, which confer resistance to streptomycin and kanamycin respectively. streptomycin susceptibility testing revealed a 20-fold increase in the mic of aus <dig>  compared to aus <dig> . the apha kanamycin resistance gene also confers resistance against gentamicin, which likely explains the high-level gentamicin resistance observed in aus <dig>  clinical isolates that exhibit high levels of resistance against gentamicin are often treated using streptomycin. resistance against streptomycin in aus <dig>  probably conferred by aade, is therefore a concern.

the genome comparisons also revealed significant insights into the acquisition of the vancomycin resistance-conferring transposon in the representative genomes. several transposons that are responsible for mediating vanb-type resistance against vancomycin have previously been described in enterococci: tn <dig>  tn <dig> and tn <dig>  the  <dig> kb tn <dig> shares high sequence homology to the  <dig> kb tn <dig> <cit> . previous studies investigating the acquisition of vancomycin resistance have provided some clues to the sources and mode of transposon transmission, but there remains much to be determined  <cit> . while vancomycin resistance in both aus <dig> and aus <dig> is conferred by the van operon associated with a tn1549-like conjugative transposon, thorough transposon comparisons revealed substantial differences between the transposon length, sequence and site of insertion. the additional genes with a possible role in conjugation may consequently affect transposon transmission and spread. these variations show that aus <dig> and aus <dig> acquired their transposons from different donors. non-synonymous nucleotide changes within the van locus coincide with the extent of vancomycin resistance in aus <dig>  with antimicrobial susceptibility testing showing a 20-fold increase in the vancomycin mic for aus <dig> compared to aus <dig>  the e251g substitution within the histidine kinase domain of vans and the c101f change within the n-terminal substrate-binding domain of vanb are both candidates for further exploration to test their role in the increased resistance to vancomycin displayed by aus <dig> 

the differences between the transposons in the st <dig> and st <dig> isolates not only relate to function but also provide important insight into the transmission and sources for acquisition of transposons in clinical e. faecium strains. the location of the van locus on mobile elements permits spread via horizontal gene transfer as well as clonal spread. it is important to establish the exact mechanisms that lead to the acquisition of antibiotic resistance, particularly in hospital-adapted strains, in order to understand the emergence of vre and to prevent the spread of resistance to vse or other bacterial species. while both aus <dig> and aus <dig> possess transposon insertion sites that differ from those previously described as preferred integration sites  <cit>  , further analysis may reveal common insertion sites that distinguish the st <dig> and st <dig> isolates. identifying these sources for transposon and vancomycin-resistance acquisition may potentially lead to diagnostic differences that can be exploited prevent vre infection through the elimination of the sources.

we have also characterized some of the phenotypic differences between st <dig> and st <dig> e. faecium. the isolates we selected to study came from a previously described st <dig> outbreak, which reported the displacement of resident st <dig> e. faecium vre with st <dig>  given the significant number of additional metabolic genes in aus <dig>  experiments assessing the rate of growth were performed to determine whether the additional genes yielded improved growth. comparisons of  <dig> st <dig> and  <dig> st <dig> isolates highlighted significantly increased growth rates and competitive fitness for st <dig> that may be factors contributing to the emergence of this clone in our hospital. notably, aus <dig> possessed a prolonged lag phase compared to the other strains, and the delay in reaching exponential phase is likely to be due to its abnormal gc skew pattern arising from imbalanced replichores  <cit> .

st <dig> and st <dig> comparisons of virulence using g. mellonella larvae demonstrated a range of virulence phenotypes in larvae inoculated with isolates from either clonal group. a potentially interesting difference was observed with the st <dig> strains isolated from  <dig> onwards, killing g. mellonella faster than earlier isolates of either sequence type. genome comparisons however revealed few differences between the known virulence factors in aus <dig> and aus <dig>  both genomes contained genes encoding virulence factors such as hemolysin and enterococcal surface protein . esp appears very important for the ability of e. faecium to colonize the host  <cit> . variations in its length, such as observed here, may alter function and explain the difference in g. mellonella virulence we observed between aus <dig> and aus <dig>  variation in esp expression  <cit> , as well as the potential of using the apparent variability of esp to discriminate between different st <dig> and st <dig> strains, were not explored here and remain to be investigated. we currently are trying to understand global differences in gene expression between aus <dig> and aus <dig> using rnaseq and the completed reference genomes.

CONCLUSIONS
the extent of variability between the three e. faecium genomes compared here highlights the significant roles played by mobile genetic elements in shaping the evolution of this species. the additional  <dig> kb in st <dig> aus <dig> with genes that likely confer additional metabolic functions and antimicrobial resistances, help explain the emergence of this clone. these observations coincide with the, on average, faster growth and increased competitiveness of st <dig> compared to st <dig>  while this study has provided several insights into differences that distinguish the st <dig> from st <dig> e. faecium strains, differences in the expression of particular genes also require investigation. in this respect, the completed aus <dig> genome represents an important resource as a reference for read-mapping applications such asrnaseq for exploring the e. faecium transcriptome, or for high-resolution molecular epidemiology to better understand the factors behind the emergence of this opportunistic nosocomial pathogen.
