BACKGROUND
eels  change their habitat several times during their life cycle and undergo two distinct metamorphoses that involve morphological, physiological and behavioural changes  <cit> . eels are catadromous teleosts which are probably spawned in the blue water of the sargasso sea  <cit> , possibly at depths of < <dig> m  <cit> . the embryo becomes a leptocephalus  and spends 1- <dig> years  <cit>  drifting with the gulf stream into the north atlantic. leptocephali travel the ~ <dig> km to the european continental shelf with its more green coastal water, where they metamorphose into glass eels, one of two juvenile forms. as elvers  and then as yellow eels , they travel up european rivers and spend 6- <dig> years in a yellow/brown stained fresh water environment, where they grow and mature as a freshwater species. subsequently, mature eels must cross the atlantic ocean to return to the sargasso sea to spawn. both just prior to and during this migration they undergo 'silvering', usually described as a second metamorphosis but which is more correctly a pubertal event  <cit> , when they become sexually mature adult fish. as sexually mature european eels have never been caught, it is thought that they become fully mature either on the last part of their journey or on reaching their destination. during this life cycle, the photic environment of the eel changes considerably, moving from blue deep sea to green coastal waters, into yellow/brown shallow freshwater and back to blue deep sea again.

many fish alter their complement of visual pigments during development and this can be attributed in most cases to environmental changes during the life cycle  <cit> . shallow dwelling fish with access to a wide visual spectrum usually express a full complement of visual opsins, a rod pigment and four cone pigments. deeper dwelling benthic  species which have limited or no access to down-welling sunlight have dispensed with many or all of the cone opsins and retained only rod photoreceptors. these often have very extended or multiple layered outer segments for maximal photon catch of attenuated sunlight or bioluminescence  <cit> . eels experience more changes to their photic environment than most fish species, and are known to switch the rod visual pigment  on maturation from a "fresh water" form to a "deep-sea" form  <cit> . wavelength sensitivity is also affected by a change in the ratio of vitamin a1- and a2-derived chromophores used to produce rhodopsin  and porphyropsin   <cit> . maturation is also accompanied by an increase in rod domination in the retina  <cit>  arising from the proliferation of rod progenitors  <cit> .

the retinae of most larval teleosts which later undergo a metamorphic event , contain only cone photoreceptors; with rods being added later after metamorphosis  <cit> . it had been thought that eels were the exception to this rule  <cit> , but work by omura  <cit> , showed that cones are present in very early  leptocephali. omura also showed that older leptocephali  possess a pure rod retina from which the cones must have been lost  <cit> . however, in postmetamorphic glass eels, the retina contains both rods and cones  <cit> . eels are therefore known to change the photosensitivity of their rod photoreceptors as well as the photoreceptor composition of the retina during their life cycle. two spectrally distinct cone classes have been identified  <cit>  but the classes of cone opsin expressed, the timing of cone development, and the distribution of cone types in the retina are largely unknown. this study sets out to determine when changes in cone opsin expression might occur.

RESULTS
cone opsins
microspectrophotometric  analysis of the retinae of glass, yellow and silver eels  <cit>  demonstrated the presence of two types of cones, a middle wavelength-sensitive  class and a short wavelength-sensitive  class. the former was found at all three developmental stages but showed a variable λmax that arose from changes in the proportions of the a <dig> pigment rhodopsin and the a <dig> pigment porphyropsin that were present. the λmax of the pigment as a pure rhodopsin was estimated to be at  <dig> nm, consistent with the values found by other workers, allowing for differences in chromophore ratio  <cit> . in contrast, the sws class was found only in yellow and silver eels. again, the exact wavelength varied slightly according to the proportions of rhodopsin  and porphyropsin  present, with an estimated λmax for pure rhodopsin of  <dig> nm.

to identify the opsin genes responsible for the pigment present in these mws and sws cones, eel retinal cdna was used. only two opsin sequences were obtained which corresponded by blast analysis to the rh <dig> and sws <dig> opsin coding sequences present in other species. no fragments corresponding to either the lws or sws <dig> opsin genes were found.

the identity of these sequences was further confirmed using phylogenetic analysis. as shown in figure  <dig>  the rh <dig> and sws <dig> eel sequences are placed into clades with orthologues from other species. the sequences have been deposited in genbank with accession numbers of fj <dig> for rh <dig> and fj <dig> for sws <dig> 

peak sensitivities of cone pigments
to correlate the expressed cone opsin genes with the cone classes identified by msp, full-length eel rh <dig> and sws <dig> sequences were expressed and regenerated with 11-cis-retinal, the λmax values were obtained by spectrophotometry. as shown in figure  <dig>  the rh <dig> sequence resulted in a pigment with a λmax value of  <dig> nm, identical therefore to the value obtained by msp for the mws cones. the sws <dig> sequence gave a pigment with a λmax of  <dig> 6nm, which is somewhat red-shifted compared to the value of  <dig> nm obtained by msp for the sws cones. such differences may be encountered when comparing between in vitro and in situ λmax values and it was concluded therefore that the mws and sws cones express the rh <dig> and sws <dig> pigments respectively  <cit> .

spatial and temporal development of cones classes
in situ hybridisation  was performed with rh <dig> and sws <dig> sense and anti-sense probes. these were derived from the 5' or 3' utr and coding region of the rh <dig> cdna, and gave a positive signal in a large proportion of cells in the cone layer. using the 3' end of the sws <dig> coding sequence a positive signal to the anti-sense probe was observed in a sub-set of cone cell bodies . no signal was obtained for either of the sense  probes.

as is usual for fish retinae, the cone cells are arranged as a continuous monolayer situated above the outer limiting membrane, between the outer nuclear layer  and the rod outer segments themselves . the signal indicating the presence of rh <dig> opsin mrna transcript can be seen in all cone cells in the glass eel, and in the majority of cone cells in the yellow and silver eels. the sws <dig> probe also highlighted cones in the monolayer. however, in contrast to the mws cones, sws2-containing cells were restricted to the retinae from older eels, with none in any of the glass eels , a few in the elvers/small yellow eels , but were present in all the larger yellow fish  and in all silver eels . the spatial frequency of the sws cones is also lower than the mws cones, with each sws cone sited at discrete spacings compared to the continuous monolayer of mws cones. the distance between sws cones varied widely , from a value of  <dig> in  <dig> found in several mid-sized yellow eels, to  <dig> in  <dig> cells in one of the silver eels. most mid-sized yellow eels measured showed average mws cone spacings of  <dig> ±  <dig>  μm; whilst for the sws cones, the same fish gave values of  <dig> ±  <dig> μm. the silver and very large yellow eels were more variable . for mid-sized yellow eels, this was a linear spacing of approximately one in every 6- <dig> cones, equivalent to an array frequency of approximately  <dig> in  <dig> 

relative levels of opsin expression
cone pigments
quantification of the levels of rh <dig> and sws <dig> opsin transcripts by qpcr are in general agreement with the findings of the in situ hybridisation experiments, as is shown in figure 4a. the level of rh <dig> opsin mrna was slightly lower in glass eels than in yellow and silver eels, where the levels were very similar. a surprising finding was the presence of expressed sws <dig> opsin mrna in glass eels when no sws2-containing cones were evident by in situ hybridization staining. across all three stages, the level of sws <dig> message was substantially lower than rh <dig> message, consistent with the relative paucity of sws2-containing cones compared to mws cones.

rod pigments
it has been previously shown  <cit>  that the sexual maturation of both the european and american eel is accompanied by an increase in rod domination of the retina and a shift in absorbance maxima of the rod photoreceptors to a shorter wavelength; this shift is the result of a switch in expression in rod opsin from the "freshwater"  to the "deep sea"  form  <cit> . the presence of this switch was confirmed by qpcr  where expression of the dso form, although just detectable in glass and yellow eels, is significant only in silver eels where it represents around 60% of the total expressed rod opsin. the levels of the fwo form show a significant increase from glass to yellow stage, and this level is maintained in the silver eels despite the simultaneous expression at a higher level of the dso form.

the ratio of cone to rod opsin expression reflects the rod dominant nature of the eel retina. even at the glass eel stage, a ratio of rod to cone  opsin mrna expression is 17: <dig>  and this rises to 30: <dig> in yellow eels and to 121: <dig> in silver eels . morphologically , rods contribute an increased proportion of the retina in yellow eels compared to glass eels, with an approximate doubling in the thickness of the outer nuclear layer. this increase does not however continue into the silver eel stage, so the substantial increase in the rod to cone opsin ratio seen at this stage is likely to reflect an increase in the relative production of rod opsin mrna during the switch over from fwo to dso forms.

discussion
we have demonstrated here that the european eel  changes opsin gene expression more times during its lifetime than had previously been reported. it was shown by omura  <cit>  that cones cells are present in very early leptocephali; whilst older leptocephali possess a pure rod retina  <cit> . it was also shown by hope et al.  <cit> , and quantified by zhang et al.  <cit> , that rod photoreceptors start to express the dso form of rod opsin as the animal undergoes puberty  before migration from fresh to salt water. glass eels have a mixed retina with rh <dig> opsin expressed in cones  <cit> , indicating that they have already made a change from the pure rod retina of the leptocephali. this probably occurs as they move from the deep sea into the shallower waters of the continental shelf and estuaries. a second change in cone opsin expression then occurs as they either move into the rivers or remain longer in the estuaries. instead of a monolayer of cone photoreceptor cells expressing only the rh <dig> pigment, occasional sws <dig> opsin-expressing cones appear within the monolayer. it could not be determined whether an rh <dig> opsin-expressing cone changes to express sws <dig> opsin ; or if new cones which express the sws <dig> pigment are inserted at intervals into the monolayer. the result appears as an array of sws-expressing cones interspersed within the mws cone monolayer.

the results of the qpcr experiments did not fully confirm the findings of the in situ hybridisations on the varying amounts of sws <dig> cone opsin in the different life stages of the eel. whilst no cells containing sws <dig> opsin mrna were detected by in situ hybridisation in the glass stage eels, sws <dig> opsin sequence was detected in these samples by qpcr, which is commonly believed to be a more sensitive detection method. from the in situ hybridisation results, sws <dig> opsin expression did not appear to start until well into the yellow stage , and continued at a similar level into the silver stage. however, qpcr, suggested that the levels of sws <dig> opsin expression in the yellow and silver eel was only about  <dig> to 5-fold higher than in the glass eel stage, as can be seen in figure 4a. a possible explanation for this could be that sws <dig> opsin message is transcribed as a default at a very low level by all cone cells, but at too low a level to be detected by in situ hybridisation. it is thought that expression of the sws <dig> opsin gene is the default pathway for mouse cone cells  <cit>  and it could be that the sws <dig> message is the default in eel cones. in this case, after the eel reaches a certain size, the sws <dig> opsin transcript is turned off in most cells which continue to express rh <dig> opsin and are spectrally identifiable as mws cones, but is upregulated in specific cells which then become detectable by in situ hybridisation as sws2-expressing cells and by microspectrophotometry as sws cones. the calculated transcription copy numbers suggested that the level of rh <dig> expression was approximately 40-fold higher for all stages than that for sws <dig>  which is in good agreement with the apparent 30-fold fewer sws <dig> opsin-expressing cells seen by in situ hybridisation.

there are two possible mechanisms for the changes in opsin gene expression. the most probable mechanism is that the existing cone cell changes the opsin type it is expressing. this is already known to occur in the rod cells of eels when they switch from expression of fwo to expression of dso  <cit> . it has also been shown to occur in rainbow trout  <cit> , where single cones change from expression of sws <dig> to sws <dig> opsin. alternatively, newly generated photoreceptors expressing the sws <dig> opsin could be generated from müller glial-associated retinal progenitors that can function as multipotent retinal stem cells  <cit>  and inserted into the photoreceptor layer  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we have shown that european eels express only two classes of cone opsin, rh <dig> and sws <dig>  the rh <dig> class is expressed in young animals, whereas the sws <dig> opsin is expressed only by older animals. spectral analysis of in vitro expressed pigments demonstrates that their absorbance peaks correspond to the values obtained by in situ msp for the mws and sws cones. this was further confirmed by in situ hybridization where it was shown that a class of rh2-expressing cones is present as a monolayer in the retina at the glass eel stage. the sws2-expressing cones appear later at the yellow eel stage as occasional cells within this monolayer. the presence of two cone classes at the later stages of pre-pubertal development is consistent with a relatively broad-spectrum light environment present in the rivers and estuaries that the eels occupy prior to full sexual maturation and migration into the deep ocean.
