BACKGROUND
recent discoveries highlighting the metabolic pliability of plant lignification indicate that lignin can be engineered to dramatically alter its composition. perturbing single or multiple genes in the monolignol pathway of angiosperms can lead to dramatic shifts in the proportions of normal monolignols  and pathway intermediates polymerized into lignin  <cit> . the malleability of lignification is further illustrated in some angiosperms by the pre-acylation of monolignols with acetate, p-hydroxybenzoate, or p-coumarate  <cit>  and the oxidative coupling of ferulate and diferulate xylan esters into lignin  <cit> .

recent efforts in lignin bioengineering are primarily aimed at manipulating the normal monolignol biosynthetic pathway  <cit> , but in the future apoplastic targeting of phenolics from other metabolic pathways may provide exciting opportunities for designing lignin that is less inhibitory toward polysaccharide hydrolysis and fermentation or easier to remove by biological or chemical pretreatments. recent model studies with maize cell walls demonstrated that partial substitution of coniferyl alcohol with coniferyl ferulate  dramatically enhanced the alkaline extractability of lignin and the enzymatic hydrolysis of fiber  <cit> . based on these results, bioengineering of plants to copolymerize coniferyl or sinapyl ferulate with monolignols is being pursued as a means for enhancing biomass saccharification or pulping for paper production.

to identify other promising avenues for lignin bioengineering, we are conducting a series of experiments to assess how the inclusion of phenolics derived from various metabolic pathways may alter lignin formation and the utilization of plant cell walls. one path to explore is reducing the hydrophobicity of lignin to permit greater penetration and hydrolysis of fiber by polysaccharidases. lignin hydrophobicity could be modulated by the incorporation of phenolics with extensive sidechain or aromatic ring hydroxylation  or substitution with hydrophilic groups . another approach would be to incorporate phenolics with o-diol functionality . the presence of o-diols provides an intramolecular pathway to trap lignin quinone methide intermediates which form cross-links between lignin and structural polysaccharides  <cit> ; such cross-links appear to limit the enzymatic hydrolysis of cell walls  <cit> . another route, first illustrated by our work with coniferyl ferulate  <cit> , would be to incorporate readily cleaved bi-phenolic conjugates  to facilitate lignin depolymerization during pretreatment of biomass for subsequent saccharification.

in this study, we used a well-characterized biomimetic cell wall model  <cit>  to explore how various monolignol substitutes influence the formation of lignin and the enzymatic degradability of cell walls. degradability was assessed by monitoring gas production during the in vitro hydrolysis and fermentation of cell walls by rumen microflora and by the analysis of residual nonfermentable polysaccharides . because gas production is directly linked to structural carbohydrate hydrolysis and fermentation by rumen microflora  <cit>  and highly correlated with biomass fermentation to ethanol  <cit> , our findings should have broad application in plant selection and engineering programs aimed at improving the utilization of fibrous feeds by livestock and cellulosic biomass for biofuel production

cell wall lignification
nonlignified primary cell walls  isolated from maize cell suspensions  <cit>  were stirred in  <dig> ml of homopipes buffer  containing  <dig> units of glucose oxidase . glucose  was added dropwise to cell wall suspensions over  <dig> min and then stirred for  <dig> min to generate h2o <dig>  for dimerizing ferulates by wall-bound peroxidases. cell walls were then artificially lignified by adding a two-component mixture of coniferyl alcohol  <dig>  and sinapyl alcohol  <dig>  or three-component mixtures of coniferyl alcohol  and sinapyl alcohol  with one of the following monolignol substitutes: dihydroconiferyl alcohol  <dig> , guaiacylglycerol  <dig> , methyl caffeate  <dig> , caffeoylquinic acid  <dig> , methyl ferulate  <dig> , feruloylquinic acid  <dig> , epicatechin  <dig> , epigallocatechin  <dig> , or epigallocatechin gallate  <dig> . the monolignol mixtures and glucose , prepared in  <dig>  ml dioxane and  <dig> ml of water, were added dropwise to the cell wall suspensions over a ~ <dig> h period.

in a separate study, nonlignified primary cell walls  isolated from maize cell suspensions  <cit>  were stirred in  <dig> ml of homopipes buffer  and h2o <dig>  was added dropwise over  <dig> min to dimerize ferulates by wall-bound peroxidases. after stirring for an additional  <dig> min, cell walls were artificially lignified with coniferyl alcohol  <dig>  or lignified with a two-component mixture of coniferyl alcohol  with one of the following monolignol substitutes: ethyl ferulate  <dig> , feruloyl ethylene glycol  <dig> , 1-o-feruloyl glycerol  <dig> ,  <dig> -di-o-feruloyl glycerol  <dig>  or  <dig> -di-o-feruloyl threitol  <dig> . separate solutions of monolignol mixtures  and h2o <dig>  were added dropwise to the cell wall suspensions over a ~ <dig> h period. in this experiment, a higher proportion of dioxane was used to prepare all monolignol solutions because feruloyl ethylene glycol and  <dig> -di-o-feruloyl glycerol were observed to have poor solubility in water.

in both studies, treatments were replicated twice in independent experiments and nonlignified controls were stirred in a solvent mixture similar to the final makeup of the lignification reaction media. cell wall peroxidase activity at the end of monolignol addition was visually assessed with guaiacol-h2o <dig> staining  <cit> . following additions, cell walls were stirred for an additional  <dig> h, pelleted  and twice resuspended in  <dig> ml of water for  <dig> min, and pelleted  to remove low molecular weight dehydrogenation products. the cell wall pellets were then resuspended in  <dig> ml of 9: <dig>  acetone:water for  <dig> min, collected on glass-fiber filters  and washed with  <dig> ml of acetone:water to remove non-bound lignins. after repeated washing with acetone, cell walls were set overnight in a hood to evaporate off acetone and then dried at 55°c and weighed.

cell wall analyses
acid-insoluble klason lignin in cell wall samples  was determined in duplicate by a two-stage hydrolysis in  <dig> m h2so <dig> at 25°c for  <dig> h followed by  <dig>  m h2so <dig> at 100°c for  <dig> h  <cit> . whole cell walls  from selected lignification treatments were sonicated in dmso-d <dig> with pyridine-d <dig> and subjected to gel-state 2-d nmr using a bruker-biospin   <dig> mhz avance spectrometer equipped with an inverse gradient 5-mm tci cryoprobe, as previously described  <cit> .

gas production during microbial hydrolysis and fermentation of cell walls  at 39°c in  <dig> ml sealed bottles was monitored with pressure transducers for  <dig> h following addition of  <dig>  ml of phosphate-bicarbonate buffer,  <dig>  ml of reducing agent, and  <dig> ml of diluted rumen inoculum  <cit> . filtered inoculum was prepared with a 1: <dig> ratio  of rumen fluid and blended buffer-extracted rumen solids collected from two holstein cows fed a total mixed ration of corn silage, corn grain, alfalfa hay, soybean meal, and supplemental vitamins and minerals  <cit> . blank-corrected gas production data from two to four independent fermentation runs were fitted with a dual-pool logistic model to estimate the kinetics of microbial hydrolysis and fermentation of cell walls  <cit> . freeze-dried residues remaining after cell-wall degradation by rumen microflora were dissolved in  <dig> m h2so <dig> at 25°c for  <dig> h and analyzed for np by the phenol-sulfuric acid assay  <cit>  with corrections for inoculum contamination and sugar recovery. the recovery of sugars from np was estimated by running unfermented nonlignified cell walls through the  <dig> m h2so <dig> dissolution/phenol-sulfuric acid assay procedure.

statistical methods
data for monolignol treatments were subjected to an analysis of variance by proc glm according to a randomized complete block design with two replications  <cit> . if f-tests were significant , then differences among monolignol treatment means were tested by the lsd procedure . unless otherwise noted, all reported treatment differences were significant at p =  <dig> .

RESULTS
cell wall lignification
previous work demonstrated that artificial lignins formed in primary cell walls isolated from maize cell suspensions are structurally similar to those naturally formed in grasses  <cit> . in the current study, isolated maize cell walls containing bound peroxidases were artificially lignified with normal monolignols  added alone or in combination with various phenolic monolignol substitutes 3- <dig>  each monolignol substitute comprised about one-third by weight of the precursor mixture, a shift in lignin composition comparable to that often observed in mutant or transgenic plants with altered lignin biosynthesis. after dissolution in a minimal volume of dioxane, normal monolignols and most monolignol substitutes readily formed aqueous solutions, but ethyl ferulate  <dig> and polyol esters, especially feruloyl ethylene glycol  <dig> and  <dig> -di-o-feruloyl glycerol  <dig>  precipitated unless a high proportion of dioxane  was used.

at the conclusion of lignification, guaiacol staining indicated weak residual peroxidase activity following addition of normal monolignols with monoferuloyl esters, very weak to no activity with diferuloyl esters, but good activity for all other treatments . while peroxidase activity is gradually lost during lignification  <cit> , partial substitution of monolignols with mono- or especially diferuloyl esters greatly accelerated this process. among possible inactivation pathways  <cit> , active site attack by ferulate phenoxy radicals or enzyme precipitation due to sorption or cross-linking to polymeric products are most plausible given the extremely high substrate preference of maize peroxidase for ferulate esters  <cit> , the bi-phenolic cross-linking capability of diferuloyl polyol esters, and their aforementioned poor aqueous solubility.

based on klason lignin analysis, inclusion of feruloylquinic acid  <dig>  methyl caffeate  <dig>  or especially caffeoylquinic acid  <dig> considerably depressed lignin formation while methyl ferulate  <dig> readily copolymerized with monolignols to form wall bound lignin . methyl and quinic acid esters of ferulic and caffeic acids are plant extractives, of which caffeoylquinic acid  and feruloylquinic acid are especially abundant in coffee and some other beverages and foods  <cit> . to tentatively investigate the cause of depressed lignification, cell walls from selected treatments were subjected to gel-state 2d nmr. spectra of cell walls lignified with normal monolignols  or monolignols plus feruloylquinic acid  both contained only correlations of guaiacyl units  and syringyl units ; the absence of ferulate correlations in the latter spectrum suggests that feruloylquinic acid was not incorporated into wall bound lignin. it must, however, be pointed out that correlations of native cell wall ferulates comprising ~10% of the lignin polymer are also missing from spectra of control cell walls . thus extensive polymerization of ferulates into a wide array of coupling products  <cit>  may sufficiently disperse their correlations or coalesce them with adjacent guaiacyl correlations to render them undetectable in our 2d nmr experiments. in any case, it seems that depressed lignin formation with these monolignol substitutes was associated with the presence of quinic or caffeic acid moieties. highly hydrophilic quinic acid moieties might hinder the association and copolymerization of hydroxycinnamate radicals with hydrophobic lignin polymers, but this or alternative mechanisms require further study. peroxidase-generated radicals of caffeate can undergo homo-dimerization or cross-coupling reactions with ferulate and sinapate  <cit> , but in the current study any coupling products involving caffeate apparently did not become incorporated into polymeric wall-bound lignin. alternatively, poor incorporation of caffeate into lignin may be due to its tendency to form quinones, which avoid radical coupling reactions characteristic of monolignols  <cit> ; to our knowledge oxidative coupling reactions between caffeate and monolignols have not been reported and call for additional study.

cell walls were lignified with a binary mixture of coniferyl alcohol  and sinapyl alcohol  or trinary mixtures of ca and sa with dihydroconiferyl alcohol , guaiacylglycerol , methyl caffeate , caffeoylquinic acid, , methyl ferulate , feruloylquinic acid , epicatechin , epigallocatechin , or epigallocatechin gallate .

in contrast to caffeate, klason lignin analysis suggested other benzene diol or triols  readily formed copolymer lignins with monolignols . indeed, the incorporation of catechins into lignin is illustrated by diagnostic 2d gel nmr contours for epigallocatechin gallate  the catechins, which are precursors of vacuolar-deposited tannins in plants, readily undergo radical homo-coupling reactions  <cit> . their coupling reactions with monolignols are, however, unknown and require further study. dihydroconiferyl alcohol  <dig> and guaiacylglycerol  <dig>  differing in sidechain hydroxylation, were also extensively copolymerized into lignin. these phenylpropanoids are known to cross-couple with monolignols via their phenolic ring to form endgroups in softwood lignins  <cit> .

in contrast to feruloylquinic acid, klason lignin analysis indicated excellent incorporation of other feruloyl esters involving ethyl  <dig>  ethylene glycol  <dig>  or glycerol  <dig> groups , despite their tendency to accelerate peroxidase inactivation. as noted previously with hydroxycinnamate-monolignols esters  <cit> , diferuloyl polyols  <dig> and  <dig> depleted peroxidase activity and depressed lignification, but they became substantial components of lignin based on diagnostic ferulate correlations in nmr spectra . oxidative coupling reactions of feruloyl polyol esters have not been reported, but they would likely form a wide array of ferulate, diferulate, and ferulate-monolignol structures similar to those previously observed with ethyl ferulate, ferulate-monolignol conjugates, and various ferulate-polysaccharide esters  <cit> .

cell walls were lignified with coniferyl alcohol  or binary mixtures of ca with ethyl ferulate , feruloyl ethylene glycol , 1-o-feruloyl glycerol ,  <dig> -o-diferuloyl glycerol , or  <dig> -o-diferuloyl threitol .

cell wall hydrolysis and fermentation by rumen microflora
because maize cell walls used in our lignification experiments were fully disaggregated and extremely thin , they exposed a large surface area that could be quickly colonized by rumen microflora  <cit> . furthermore, rumen microflora produce a diverse array of hydrolases capable of rapidly degrading essentially all organic components except lignin  <cit> . together, these factors allowed us assess how lignin alterations affect cell wall degradation at the molecular level, free from other confounding constraints that also hinder cell wall degradation such as the anatomical structure of plant tissues or the use of enzyme preparations lacking key hydrolase activities  <cit> . in addition to measuring residual np at the endpoint of digestion, we continuously monitored gas production by rumen bacteria to estimate lag time before fermentation commenced as well as the rate and extent of cell wall fermentation. although the production of fermentation gasses by rumen bacteria is substrate dependent  <cit> , our use of a common source of cell walls for all lignification treatments insured that shifts in gas production mirrored the enzymatic degradation of cell walls.

as in a previous study  <cit> , cell walls exhibited a biphasic production of fermentation gasses that was best described by a two-pool logistic model with two discrete lag times. for nonlignified cell walls, gas production for both pools commenced after a lag of < <dig>  h, but the primary pool had roughly a 5-fold greater rate and extent of gas production than the secondary pool . nonlignified cell walls were extensively degraded, leaving only  <dig> mg/g of np. based on the polysaccharide composition and fermentation characteristics of primary maize walls, we previously speculated the larger pool represented rapidly degraded noncellulosic polysaccharides, while the smaller pool represented slowly degraded cellulose  <cit> . the relative rate and extent of gas production for these pools were, however, strikingly similar to two fiber digestion pools observed in graminaceous crops  <cit> , which undoubtedly possess a markedly different structural polysaccharide makeup than our primary maize cell walls. clearly, further work is warranted to reveal the exact structural nature of the rapidly and slowly degraded pools in grass cell walls.

in both experiments, total gas ab declined 24% and np increased by ~ <dig> mg/g when cell walls were artificially lignified with normal monolignols  to a klason lignin content of  <dig> mg/g . lignification with normal monolignols had little effect on lag l <dig>  but rate k <dig> and gas production a for the large rapidly degraded pool decreased by  <dig> and 24%, respectively. conversely for the smaller pool, lignification with normal monolignols dramatically increased lag l <dig> by  <dig>  to  <dig>  h and decreased gas production b by  <dig> to 70%, with comparatively minor effects on rate k <dig>  although effects on the rapidly and slowly degraded pools differed, the overall impact of lignification was to obstruct cell wall hydrolysis and fermentation by rumen bacteria. similar findings were previously reported in studies utilizing coarsely ground grass stems and isolated tissues from grasses  <cit> . thus, lignification is an impediment to the enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation of cell walls at both the molecular and tissue level in plants.

in the first experiment, substituting one-third of normal monolignols with methyl caffeate  <dig>  caffeoylquinic acid  <dig>  or feruloylquinic acid  <dig> strikingly improved total gas ab and reduced np for lignified cell walls, primarily through increasing rate k <dig> and gas production a from the large rapidly digested pool . these monolignol substitutes also reduced lag times for both pools, particularly lag l <dig> of the small slowly digested pool. the impact of these shifts on gas production from cell walls lignified with feruloylquinic acid is shown in figure  <dig>  these monolignol substitutes also lessened gas reduction per unit lignin  and nonfermentable polysaccharide accumulation per unit of lignin , indicating that factors in addition to reduced lignin content contributed to enhanced cell wall hydrolysis and fermentation . caffeate, like other benzene- <dig> -diols, might internally trap lignin quinone-methide intermediates  <cit>  to limit the cross-linking of lignin to polysaccharides and enhance the enzymatic hydrolysis of cell walls  <cit> . incorporation of hydrophilic caffeoyl or quinic acid moieties into lignin might also enhance penetration or limit irreversible binding of hydrolytic enzymes to the lignocellulosic matrix, but identifying actual causative factors requires further study.

while not conclusively shown by the kinetics of gas production, reductions in np and npal indicated a modest improvement in cell wall hydrolysis occurred when one-third of normal monolignols were substituted with guaiacylglycerol  <dig>  epigallocatechin  <dig>  or epigallocatechin gallate  <dig> . in contrast, dihydroconiferyl alcohol  <dig> had no effect, while incorporation of epicatechin  <dig> and especially methyl ferulate  <dig> adversely affected cell wall hydrolysis and fermentation  by decreasing rate k <dig> and gas production a and ab, and by increasing np, grl, and npal. among the catechins, those with  <dig> ,3-triol functionality enhanced cell wall hydrolysis and fermentation, primarily by increasing rate k <dig> and gas production ab and by decreasing lag l <dig>  np, grl, and npal--again implicating reduced hydrophobicity or cross-linking as playing a role--but underlying mechanisms await revelation. in contrast, increased sidechain hydroxylation of incorporated phenylpropanoids  slightly increased cell wall hydrolysis as indicated by modest reductions  in np or npal.

in the second experiment, substituting one-third of a normal monolignol  with various monoferuloyl esters did not alter cell wall hydrolysis and fermentation . but within the monoferuloyl ester treatments, increases in ester group hydroxylation slightly increased rate k <dig> and a reduced lag l <dig>  np and npal. incorporating  <dig> -di-o-diferuloyl threitol  <dig> and particularly <dig> -di-o-feruloyl glycerol  <dig> into lignin, however, modestly increased rate k <dig> and reduced both np and npal compared to cell walls lignified solely with coniferyl alcohol. while having relatively small effects on the inherent degradability of non-pretreated cell walls, incorporation of diferuloyl polyol esters  could substantially boost pretreatment efficacy for removing lignin prior to biomass saccharification. other biomimetic model studies by our group recently demonstrated the potential for bi-phenolic conjugates to improve cell wall delignification and saccharification  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
to identify new targets for lignin bioengineering, we artificially lignified maize cell walls with normal monolignols and a variety of phenolic monolignol substitutes normally associated with other plant metabolic pathways. lignification with normal monolignols severely impeded structural polysaccharide hydrolysis and fermentation by rumen microflora at the molecular level in cell walls. inclusion of feruloylquinic acid, methyl caffeate, or caffeoylquinic acid with normal monolignols considerably depressed lignin formation and substantially improved cell wall hydrolysis and fermentation. in contrast, epicatechin, epigallocatechin, and epigallocatechin gallate readily formed copolymer lignins with monolignols as did the phenylpropanoids dihydroconiferyl alcohol and guaiacylglycerol. cell wall fermentability was moderately enhanced by catechins with  <dig> ,3-triol functionality, while inclusion of phenylpropanoids with extensive sidechain hydroxylation had little impact. mono- or diferuloyl esters with various aliphatic or polyol groups readily formed copolymers with monolignols, but their tendency to accelerate peroxidase inactivation slightly diminished lignin formation in some cases. relative to cell walls lignified with normal monolignols, copolymerization of mono- or diferuloyl esters into lignin had negative to weakly positive effects on cell wall hydrolysis and fermentability, which were in part dependent on the quantity of lignin formed and the degree of ester group hydroxylation. overall, monolignol substitutes improved the inherent degradability of cell walls by depressing lignin formation or possibly by reducing lignin hydrophobicity or cross-linking to structural polysaccharides. some monolignol substitutes, chiefly readily cleaved bi-phenolic conjugates like epigallocatechin gallate or diferuloyl polyol esters are expected to greatly boost enzymatic saccharification of cell walls following chemical pretreatment. in a forthcoming paper, we will examine the impact of the aforementioned monolignol substitutes on the enzymatic saccharification of intact and chemically pretreated cell walls. in subsequent model studies, we will examine these and other monolignol substitutes in greater detail to identify promising bioengineering targets for improving plant fiber utilization.
