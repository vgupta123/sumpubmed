BACKGROUND
proteolysis - the specific and limited cleavage of proteins by enzymes called proteases - represents an important mechanism for post-translational control in all living organisms  <cit> . granzymes  belong to a unique class of serine proteases which are known to mediate critical roles in the innate immune response against virus-infected or tumor cells through the induction of apoptotic cell death  <cit> . consequently, the enzymes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several chronic inflammatory and cardiovascular disorders. granzymes are released into the cytoplasm of the target cells through endocytosis of cytolytic granules released by cytotoxic t cells or natural killer cells  <cit> . once released into the target cells, granzymes go on to cleave specific cellular proteins and activate multiple signaling pathways leading to apoptotic cell death. of the five human subtypes discovered to date , granzyme b has been the most well studied. like caspases, granzyme b recognizes specific tetrapeptide sequence motifs  and cleave proteins after aspartate residue at p <dig>  <cit> . besides cleaving specific proteins regulating apoptotic cell death, granzyme b has been reported to cleave proteins across a wide spectrum of other functional classes, ranging from nuclear and cytoskeletal components to membrane receptors and viral proteins  <cit> .

to date, more than  <dig> granzyme b substrates have been characterized and many more are expected to be identified  <cit> . while systematic experimental discovery and validation of bona fide substrates are necessary for elucidating the granzyme b degradome, many of the processes are often time consuming and laborious. for these reasons, computational prediction of substrates could be immensely helpful in generating initial hypotheses and experimental leads. while a wide range of computational methods have been applied for substrate prediction of related proteases such as caspases  <cit> , only a limited number are available for prediction of granzyme b substrates. peptidecutter  <cit>  is a general protease substrates cleavage prediction server which predicts for potential granyzme b cleavage sites using preferential tetrapeptide cleavage  specificities derived from in vitro combinatorial library studies by thornberry et al.  <cit> . backes et al. developed the grabcas software which extended the use of the in vitro specificities by incorporating position-specific scoring matrices and accounting for conserved residues at p1' and p2' positions  <cit> . more recently, barkan et al. advanced the field through the application of the support vector machines  method on a set of experimentally verified cleavage sites using both sequence and structural features  <cit> .

in this paper, we have compiled a dataset of  <dig> experimentally verified granzyme b cleavage sites and found distinctive patterns of residue conservation and position-specific residue propensities which could be useful for in silico prediction using machine learning algorithms. we trained a series of svm classifiers employing bayes feature extraction to predict cleavage sites using sequence windows of diverse lengths and compositions. the svm classifiers achieved accuracy and aroc scores between  <dig> % to  <dig> % and  <dig>  to  <dig>  respectively on independent test sets. we applied our prediction method on the chikungunya viral proteome and identified several regulatory domains of viral proteins to be potential sites of granzyme b cleavage, suggesting direct antiviral activity of granzyme b during host-viral innate immune responses. a web server, together with reference datasets and supplementary materials, can be accessed at http://www.casbase.org/grasvm/index.html.

RESULTS
sequence analysis of granzyme b cleavage sites
using peptide combinatorial libraries, thornberry and co-workers had previously identified the presence of distinctive sequence specificities governing protein cleavage of both caspase and granzyme b substrates  <cit> . in particular, specific tetrapeptide sequences upstream of the cleavage site  of granzyme b targets serve as recognition sites for protein cleavage. the tetrapeptide “iepd” was identified as the optimal tetrapetide cleavage sequence in vitro. however, emerging data on granzyme b substrates suggest that the in vivo cleavage specificities are far more diverse, with numerous substrates possessing cleavage specificities extending beyond the tetrapeptide sequence  <cit> .

we compiled a comprehensive dataset of  <dig> unique granzyme b cleavage sites extracted from experimentally verified substrates as reported in literature. data was extracted from the substrates list compiled in barkan et al.  <cit> , as well as the proteomic studies by van damme et al.  <cit> . in addition to the p4p <dig> cleavage site sequences, segments of different lengths and compositions centered on the p <dig> position were selected. in all, eight groups of sequences were obtained - p2p2’, p4p <dig>  p4p2’, p4p4’, p6p6’, p8p8’, p10p10’ and p14p10'. we further extracted an equal number of “non-cleavage” sites by randomly selecting non-annotated tetrapeptide sequences  on the substrates. on the p10p10’ dataset, we computed px  of each amino acid at the different residue positions along the 20-mer sequence. px was computed as the ratio of the frequency of occurrence of a particular residue in the cleavage site sequences over the same residue in the non-cleavage site sequences at the particular position.

as shown in table  <dig>  measurements of average px in the p10p10’ sequences indicate an unusually high enrichment for the negatively charged amino acids asp and glu with average px scores of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. conversely, there are significantly lower propensities for the positively charged amino acids . in addition, the large hydrophobic residue trp is also weakly represented among the cleavage site sequences, with average px of  <dig> . to further quantify position-specific residue propensities, we plotted a sequence logo using the p10p10’ sequences and constructed a heatmap of px scores from the same dataset . at p <dig> position, asp is expectedly the most conserved residue, with notable presence of glu, asn and ser as alternatives. interestingly, pro and cys residues are more conserved in the cleavage sites compared to the non-cleavage sites at p <dig> position, while p <dig> is dominated by the acidic residues asp and glu. the p <dig> position showed significant propensities for the branched-chain amino acids leu, ile and val. remarkably, the most prominent feature distinguishing cleavage site sequences from non-cleavage site sequences appear to be the extended stretches of acidic residues  upstream and downstream of the cleavage site. downstream of the cleavage site, it is further observed that small amino acids such as gly, ser, ala and leu are highly enriched at p1’ and p2’. these results indicate that cleavage sites of granzyme b substrates and the flanking upstream and downstream sequences have unique position-specific residue propensities. these composite signatures could be incorporated into machine learning algorithms for the development of accurate computational prediction models.

svm prediction of granzyme b cleavage sites
to account for these unique signatures of residue conservation and position-specific propensities for in silico prediction, we developed svm prediction models incorporating the bayes feature extraction  approach as described in shao et al. <cit> . vector representation using the bfe approach was shown to significantly improve performance in several bio-computational problems - such as the prediction of protein methylation sites  <cit> , caspase cleavage  <cit>  and linear b-cell epitopes  <cit>  - over simple binary encoding schemes. in bfe, feature vectors encoded in a bi-profile manner comprising of positive position-specific and negative position-specific profiles. these profiles were generated by accounting for the frequency of occurrence of each amino acid at each position of the sequences in the positives pool  and negatives pool  respectively. here, we trained a series of svm classifiers on sequence windows of diverse lengths and compositions  using simple binary encoding and bfe schemes . datasets were segmented into training and independent test sets comprising of  <dig> positives/ <dig> negatives and  <dig> positives/ <dig> negatives respectively. using the rbf kernel, 10-fold cross-validation was implemented to acquire the optimal set of c and γ parameter values. svm classifiers were subsequently trained on the entire training set using the optimized parameters and evaluated on the independent test sets.

as given in table  <dig>  the p4p <dig> classifier utilizing simple binary encoding  registered an accuracy of  <dig> % and aroc of  <dig>  on independent testing. the other classifiers observed consistent improvement in accuracy and aroc as the sequence window extends beyond p4p <dig> to include the flanking upstream and downstream residues, achieving the best scores of  <dig> % and  <dig>  respectively with the p8p8’-svm classifier. the p4p <dig> classifier utilizing bfe scheme  attained an accuracy of  <dig> % and aroc of  <dig>  . in a similar fashion, prediction performance improved steadily as the sequence window is extended beyond p4p <dig>  achieving the best accuracy of  <dig> % with the p8p8’-bayes classifier and the best aroc of  <dig>  with the p10p10’-bayes and p14p10’-bayes classifiers. interestingly, in both feature representation schemes, prediction performances did not significantly improve with sequences longer than p8p8’. this could be due to that fact that much of the information specific for differentiating cleavage sites from non-cleavage sites are encoded within the sequences situated closer to the cleavage sites, as evidenced by the unique residue propensities discussed earlier. in addition, accuracy and aroc scores across most sequence lengths and compositions were generally higher for classifiers trained using the bfe scheme, with the greatest improvements observed when longer sequences  were employed.

next, we compared our prediction method with grabcas  <cit>  and the svm models developed by barkan et al.  <cit> . as the grabcas algorithm primarily focuses on the detection of specific tetrapeptide motifs, we applied the algorithm on our p4p <dig> independent test set which contains only the tetrapeptide cleavage site sequences. using the recommended cut-off score of  <dig> , grabcas predicted only  <dig> out of  <dig> cleavage sites correctly . on the same dataset, our p4p1-svm and p4p1-bayes classifiers respectively predicted  <dig> out of  <dig>  and  <dig> out of  <dig>  cleavage sites correctly. the weaker sensitivity scores observed for grabcas could be due to the utilization of position-specific scoring matrices  which are derived from a small, out-dated set of in vitro cleavage specificities and the absolute requirement of asp residue at p <dig> on the cleavage sites. to further evaluate the performance of the pssm-based algorithm in our context, we constructed pssms derived from our entire dataset of cleavage sites, and found that the aroc scores of the pssm-based predictors were generally poorer than our svm-based classifiers . in barkan et al., the best svm classifier recorded a true positive rate  of  <dig>  and false positive rate  of  <dig>  at the critical point on the receiver operating characteristic  curve when tested on an independent test set. in our svm method, several classifiers encoded using the bfe scheme registered better prediction performance when measured by the same metrics; p10p10’-bayes with tpr of  <dig>  and fpr of  <dig> , as well as p14p10’-bayes, p8p8’-bayes and p6p6’-bayes with tprs of  <dig>  and fprs of  <dig> .

prediction of granzyme b cleavage of chikv proteome
to investigate the applicability of our computational method, we applied the svm classifiers on the proteome of the chikungunya virus  and analyzed for the presence of hitherto undiscovered granzyme b cleavage sites. chikv is a member of the alphavirus family and has been known to be transmitted to humans via the bite of the virus-borne aedes mosquito  <cit> . acute infection of chikv results in symptoms such as abrupt fever, skin rash and arthralgia. as chikv epidemics have been re-emerging in recent times, there have been concerted efforts directed toward developing relevant vaccines and drug therapies. during viral infections, granzyme b has been reported to mediate downstream cleavage of critical host regulatory proteins, leading to the induction of the apoptotic cell death, and hence disruption of viral propagation  <cit> . although granzyme b-induced apoptotic cell death has long been considered the de facto mechanism for killing virus-infected cells, emerging evidence suggest that the enzyme could exert direct antiviral activity through cleavage of the viral proteins  <cit> . for these reasons, it is intuitive to speculate if the chikv proteome may be directly regulated by granzyme b activity in this manner and if cleavage of specific chikv proteins will potentiate the host innate immune responses against viral infectivity.

four non-structural and four structural proteins of the chikv proteome  were predicted for granzyme b cleavage sites using the p8p8’-bayes classifier. since the majority of experimentally verified cleavage sites were known to be cleaved after the asp residue, we have restricted our prediction scans to only cleavage sites containing asp residue at p <dig>  as shown in table  <dig>  we found potential granzyme b cleavage sites in all chikv proteins except the structural proteins e <dig>  e <dig> and 6k. a significantly larger proportion of these sites were found in the non-structural proteins nsp <dig>  nsp <dig>  nsp <dig> and nsp <dig>  as compared to the structural proteins e <dig> and capsid. as the alphaviral non-structural proteins are known to be involved in viral survival and replication, we would expect the cleavage of these proteins by granzyme b to abrogate viral survival mechanisms at different points of the viral reproduction cycle  <cit> . indeed, the cleavage of nsp <dig> protein at asp- <dig> and asp- <dig>  which are both localized within the methyltransferase domain, could lead to inhibition of the mrna capping during rna synthesis. conversely, the cleavage of nsp <dig> helicase domain at asp- <dig> and asp- <dig>  as well as the rna polymerase domain at asp- <dig>  asp- <dig>  asp- <dig> and asp- <dig> on the nsp <dig> protein could hinder viral rna synthesis and translation. in addition, cleavage of the capsid protein at asp- <dig> and asp- <dig> within the protease domain might lead to prevention of auto-cleavage of the immature capsid protein from the viral structural polyprotein.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we constructed a comprehensive database of experimentally verified granzyme b cleavage sites for analysis and development of prediction methods. we discovered that flanking sequences of cleavage sites possess distinctive residue composition and position-specific propensity patterns which could be helpful in discriminating the cleavage sites from non-cleavage sites in silico. we have rigorously tested svm classifiers employing simple binary encoding and the bayes feature extraction schemes to predict granzyme b cleavage sites. results also show that the best classifiers are more effective than existing algorithms. we applied our prediction method on the chikungunya viral proteome and identified several regulatory domains of viral proteins to be potential targets of granzyme b cleavage, suggesting a direct antiviral function of granzyme b during host-viral innate immune responses. to complement experimental research, we have implemented our prediction method on a web server which is freely accessible at http://www.casbase.org/grasvm/index.html. in the immediate future, we will be exploring the influence of cleavage site secondary structures, solvent accessibilities and other physicochemical properties on protease-substrate cleavage specificities, as well as their potential for enhancing the performance of our svm prediction models. computational prediction of granzyme b substrates will complement on-going experimental efforts and refine our understanding of the biochemistry of this fascinating protease and its relatives.

materials and methods
datasets
we extracted a pool of  <dig> unique, experimentally verified cleavage sites from literature.  <dig> sequences were derived from proteomic experimental studies conducted by van damme et al.  <cit> , with the remaining  <dig> from systematic in vitro and in vivo experiments as compiled in barkan et al.  <cit> . we further extracted sequence segments of different lengths flanking the p <dig> cleavage sites. in all, eight datasets were constructed: the tetrapeptide cleavage site sequences  and sequences containing residues extended to p <dig> and p10' . these sequences were assigned as positive examples for analysis as well as for development of the svm method. an equal number of “non-cleavage sites” or negative examples were obtained by randomly extracting p <dig> residues on the substrates. sequence segments of the aforementioned lengths and compositions were obtained as detailed earlier. all datasets of positive and negative sequences  were subsequently subjected to homology filtering using the cd-hit clustering algorithm  <cit>  where sequences bearing more than 85% sequence identity with any other sequence in the dataset were eliminated. the final datasets comprised of  <dig> positive and  <dig> negative sequences . for analysis, all  <dig> positives and  <dig> negatives from the p10p10’ dataset were used. for svm model development, datasets were partitioned into training and test sets consisting of  <dig> positives/ <dig> negatives and  <dig> positives/ <dig> negatives respectively.

sequence analysis
the relative position-specific residue propensity px was computed as the ratio of the frequency of occurrence of a particular amino acid in the cleavage sites pool to its frequency of occurrence in the non-cleavage sites pool at a specific position on the sequence. using the p10p10’ dataset, px scores were calculated for every amino acid at each of the twenty residue positions and visualized on heat maps. additionally, we constructed a sequence logo representation of the positive sequences from the p10p10’ dataset using weblogo  <cit> .

svm vector representation
to encapsulate sequence information for svm training and testing, input vectors were constructed using simple binary or bi-profile bayes features encoding. for simple binary encoding, each amino acid is represented by a vector of  <dig> dimensions, comprising of binary values of zeroes and ones. for example, alanine was represented as  <cit>  and cysteine as  <cit> . hence, in this case, a 20-mer sequence will be represented by a vector of  <dig> dimensions . detailed description on bi-profile vector encoding using bayes features is available in shao et al.  <cit> . in short, feature vectors contain information from both positive position-specific and negative position-specific profiles. these profiles were generated by accounting for the frequency of occurrence of each amino acid at each position of the sequences in the positives pool  and negatives pool  respectively. therefore, a 20-mer sequence  would be represented by a feature vector of  <dig> dimensions , containing information of the residues in both positive  and negative  spaces. for all sequence representations, p <dig> residues were excluded from the feature vectors.

svm model development
to train and test the svm models, we used the libsvm package provided by chang and lin  <cit> . for details on the svm method, readers are advised to consult the article by burges  <cit> . in short, svm is grounded on the structural risk minimization concept from statistical learning theory. a set of training examples  can be encoded by the feature vectors xi  with resultant classes yi ∈ {+ <dig> -1}. the svm algorithm trains a classifier by representing the input feature vectors, using a kernel function in the majority of cases, onto a high-dimensional space, and then selects a discriminating hyperplane that separates the two classes with maximal margin and the least error. the decision function for classification of unseen examples is defined as:  

where k  is the kernel function, and the parameters are resolved by maximizing the following:  

with the following constraints:  

c is the regularization variable that directs the trade-off between margin and classification error. we used the radial basis function  kernel and performed grid-based optimization for γ, which controls the capacity of the rbf kernel, and c using 10-fold cross-validation. in 10-fold cross-validation, the training set was randomly partitioned into ten subsets where one of the subsets was used as the test set while the other subsets were used for training the classifier. the trained classifier was evaluated using the test set. this procedure was repeated ten times using different subsets for testing, hence making sure that all subsets were utilized for both training and testing. the optimized γ and c values were applied towards training the entire training set to generate the svm classifier for independent testing on an out-of-sample test set. graphical plots of optimization results are provided in additional file  <dig> 

evaluation of model performance
a set of statistical variables were established to evaluate the performance of the svm classifier for the prediction of granzyme b cleavage sites:

 true positives , for the number of correctly classified cleavage sites.

 false positives , for the number of incorrectly classified non-cleavage sites.

 true negatives , for the number of correctly classified non-cleavage sites.

 false negatives , for the number of incorrectly classified cleavage sites.

sensitivity  and specificity , which measures the capability of the model to correctly classify the cleavage sites and non-cleavage sites respectively, were computed as well:    

to measure the overall model performance, we computed accuracy :  

in addition, we plotted the receiver operating characteristic curve  and computed the area under the curve  for threshold independent evaluation. to compare against the prediction model developed by barkan et al., we further determined the critical points on the rocs of our svm classifiers, which are defined as the points where the roc curves intersect the lines connecting coordinates  and  on the graphs.
