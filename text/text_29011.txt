BACKGROUND
human astroviruses  have been shown in several epidemiologic outpatient studies to be an important cause of viral gastroenteritis in infants and young children. hastv have been associated with outbreaks in day-care centers for children and adults  <cit> . the incidence of astrovirus infections has been estimated at between 5% and 10% in children with gastroenteritis  <cit> . the reported frequency of infection by astrovirus was 8% during the winter season  in beijing  <cit> .

astroviruses are among the most resistant viruses; they show resistance against different physical and chemical agents, they are able to maintain their infectivity at 60°c for  <dig> min, and they are resistant to treatment at ph  <dig>  <cit> . astroviruses spread via the fecal–oral route, through direct personal contact, or via contaminated food and water, and they have been reported to affect otherwise healthy people exposed to astrovirus-contaminated food or water  <cit> . however, the number of reports on astrovirus detection is relatively low.

several detection methods have been developed to detect the presence of astrovirus in clinical isolates, raw sewage samples, groundwater and surface water, including cell culture  <cit> , enzyme immunoassay and nucleotide sequencing  <cit> , and pcr-based assays  <cit> . all of these methods are effective and accurate in detecting the virus infection in the laboratory. however, these methods have some intrinsic disadvantages such as the requirement for expensive equipment and reagents, and being laborious and time consuming, and are thus unfavorable for use on a wide scale. a detection method that is not only rapid and sensitive, but also simple and economical to handle, is needed for practical application.

to meet these requirements, a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification  reaction was developed as an alternative method. the lamp assay is a rapid, accurate and cost-effective diagnostic method that amplifies the target nucleic acid under isothermal conditions, usually between 60°c and 65°c  <cit> . hence, only simple equipment such as a heating block or a water bath is required. the final products of the rt-lamp reaction are dna molecules with a cauliflower-like structure and multiple loops consisting of several repeats of the target sequence  <cit> . lamp has been applied for the specific detection of aquatic animal viruses such as foot-and-mouth disease virus  <cit> , singapore grouper iridovirus  <cit>  and h1n <dig>  <dig> virus  <cit> .

the lamp reaction results in large amounts of pyrophosphate ion byproduct. these ions react with mg2+ ions to form the insoluble product, magnesium pyrophosphate. because the mg2+ ion concentration decreases as the lamp reaction progresses, the lamp reaction can be quantified by measuring the mg2+ ion concentration in the reaction solution  <cit> . hydroxynaphthol blue  is used for colorimetric analysis of the lamp reaction. the hnb dye-based assay has a remarkable advantage compared with other color-based assays  <cit>  in that hnb is mixed prior to amplification. the need to open the assay samples to add the dye is thereby omitted, thus reducing the risk of cross-contamination.

hastv is classified into eight distinct antigenic serotypes, hastv 1– <dig>  with serotype  <dig> predominating in most countries  <cit> . hastv- <dig> was also identified as the predominant serotype in china  <cit> . wei et al.  <cit>  developed a one-step, real-time reverse-transcription lamp  method with a turbidimeter targeting the 5’ end of the capsid gene for rapid and quantitative detection of hastv- <dig> from stool specimens. in our study, rt-lamp with hnb for specific, rapid and sensitive detection of hastv- <dig> in water samples was developed. to our knowledge, this is the first report of the application of rt-lamp with hnb to hastv- <dig> 

RESULTS
optimized lamp reaction
the lamp reaction was performed using plasmid dna as template to determine the optimal reaction conditions. the optimal concentrations of betaine and mg2+ ion in the lamp reactions were 1 mmol·l- <dig> and 4 mmol·l- <dig>  respectively . the amplicon was formed at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 66°c, with the optimal temperature for product detection being 65°c. thus, 65°c was used as the optimum temperature for the following assays. although we could detect well-formed bands at 60 min, the reaction time was extended to 90 min to ensure positive detection of lower concentration templates in the system.

naked-eye observation of lamp products using hnb
the lamp reaction was incubated in a conventional water bath at 65°c for  <dig> min, followed by heating at 80°c for  <dig> min to terminate the reaction. the ability to detect astrovirus lamp products using hnb was examined. positive amplification was indicated by a color change from violet to sky blue, as shown in figure 1b, and verified by agarose gel electrophoresis  and white precipitates . the positive color  was only observed with the reference virus, whereas none of the control viruses showed a color change.

specificity and sensitivity of the lamp assay
the sizes of the lamp fragments digested with the restriction enzyme, econ <dig>  were analyzed by electrophoresis, and the results showed agreement with the predicted sizes of  <dig> and  <dig> bp . the specificity of the lamp assays was examined with two other enteric viruses: rotavirus and norovirus. the results of the lamp assay were positive for astrovirus and negative for rotavirus and norovirus .

the reaction was tested using  <dig> μl of 10-fold serial dilutions of in vitro rna transcripts  and compared with pcr assays. the detection limit of lamp using astrovirus rna was  <dig> ×  <dig> copies·μl- <dig> , and the lamp reaction followed by colorimetric analysis could be completed within  <dig> minutes. similarly, the detection limit of pcr was also  <dig> ×  <dig> copies·μl- <dig>  but followed by gel electrophoresis required about  <dig> h for completion .

evaluation of rt-lamp assay with reclaimed water samples
comparative evaluation of rt-lamp with routine rt-pcr was performed to examine astrovirus in  <dig> reclaimed water samples. five samples  were positive and the frequency of astrovirus detection was  <dig> %  with rt-lamp . in contrast, four samples  were positive and the frequency of astrovirus detection was  <dig> %  with rt-pcr . this may indicate that the astrovirus rt-lamp assay is slightly more sensitive than rt-pcr for the detection of astrovirus in water samples with very low viral titers.

discussion
this study demonstrated that the lamp method described here for astrovirus detection is highly sensitive, and can detect as few as  <dig> ×  <dig> copies·μl- <dig> of astrovirus template rna. the detection limit of the rt-lamp assay with hnb for pandemic influenza a h1n <dig> virus was approximately  <dig> copies in a  <dig> μl reaction mixture  <cit> . detection of target dna by lamp compared with detection by pcr was at least equivalent or more sensitive  <cit> . this was confirmed by results showing that the detection limit of lamp was as sensitive as the currently used pcr assays for the detection of astrovirus.

though dna plasmid is served as template for optimizing virus detection assays in some cases  <cit>  since rna molecules are not stable in vitro. however, plasmid dna is not fully representative of rna viruses such as astrovirus. and rna transcripts in vitro will be better served as a template for the optimization of this assay. we completed the sensitivity analysis using in vitro rna transcripts, which will provide important comparative reference to other laboratories doing similar research.

in this study, we only compared the specificity of the reaction for astrovirus, rotavirus and norovirus because the reported frequencies of infection by rotavirus, astrovirus and norovirus are 59%, 8% and 6%, respectively, in beijing  <cit> . astrovirus, rotavirus and norovirus are the top three viruses associated with diarrhea. regarding the specificity among different serotypes of astrovirus, a similar study using primers from the same conserved capsid protein  gene of hastv- <dig> indicated that the lamp assay had a high degree of specificity for hastv- <dig>  <cit> . in future experiments, we will synthesize the target sequences of hastv 2- <dig> and transcribe them in vitro. the resulting rna segments will then be used to investigate cross-reactivity with the hastv-1-specific lamp primers.

the use of hnb for visual inspection of lamp amplification products was a simple and effective technique, with no gel electrophoresis and staining with ethidium bromide required. hence, lamp is a superior method in terms of its economic feasibility and safety. the hnb dye-based assay has a remarkable advantage compared with other color-based assays because  opening the reaction tube is not required to determine whether the reaction is positive or negative ;  the detection sensitivity is equivalent to that of sybr green assays; and  the positive/negative result of the lamp reaction can be easily judged with the naked eye  <cit> . this colorimetric assay is superior to the existing colorimetric assays for lamp with regard to reducing contamination risks, and is helpful in high-throughput dna and rna detection  <cit> . thus, rt-lamp with hnb dye was shown to be a sensitive and simple assay for detection of many viruses  <cit> . although quantitative detection is difficult, inspection with the naked eye was simple and rapid. therefore, it may facilitate the application of lamp as a field test  <cit> .

using the lamp assay, we were able to detect astrovirus in various environmental water samples with a simple water bath. a water bath is the only equipment needed, and is used for both the dna preparation and nucleic acid amplification. with no complicated equipment and technical training, lamp is very simple to perform and offers advantages compared with other techniques  <cit> . additional studies, including improvements in sensitivity and validation of visual testing with a larger number of water samples, are necessary before this method can be applied widely for routine testing both in the laboratory and in the field. the simplicity, ease of use and cost-effectiveness of this method makes it an attractive assay for the rapid screening of human astrovirus.

CONCLUSIONS
the lamp technique described in this study is a cheap, sensitive, specific and rapid method for the detection of astrovirus. the rt-lamp method can be simply applied for the specific detection of astrovirus and has the potential to be utilized in the field as a screening test.
