BACKGROUND
protein phosphorylation is a ubiquitous post-translational modification, which controls several cellular processes in cell signaling networks. cellular protein phosphorylation is catalyzed by protein kinases, which are one of the largest gene families in eukaryotes. the disruption of cellular protein phosphorylation events causes several diseases, including cancer and diabetes, and kinase inhibitory molecules may have potential uses in targeted molecular therapy to combat certain diseases. the human genome encodes  <dig> protein kinases, which are divided into nine groups based on their sequence similarities, including one tyrosine kinase family and eight serine/threonine kinase families  <cit> . several protein kinases have local substrate specificities that are determined by the amino acid sequence surrounding the phosphosite as a kinase motif. the techniques used for protein phosphorylation analysis have advanced rapidly since the development of high-throughput phosphoproteomic analysis, which has yielded extremely large phosphopeptide datasets . techniques and algorithms have also been developed for bioinformatics analysis that combine large-scale phosphoproteomics datasets with other information from a wide variety of life science databases to predict signal transduction networks, thereby leading to a better understanding of cellular functions  <cit> . however, it is difficult to extract useful information related to cellular functions based on phosphosites alone because it is necessary to understand both the kinase protein and the functional change in its substrate protein caused by phosphorylation. thus, a large number of phosphosites have been reported, but only a small number of kinase–substrate relationships have been identified. therefore, several studies have attempted to develop methods to predict these relationships .

previous analyses of intracellular signaling networks used methods that subtract the subnetworks identified in various conditions, such as cell cycles and ligand stimulation, or in different species  <cit> . similarity methods such as evolutionary comparative analyses of phosphosite sequences have been used for phosphorylation signaling network analysis . the position of a phosphosite in a protein is affected by both its primary structure and the corresponding kinase, which may be changed by evolutionary processes  <cit> . in general, the amino acids in a protein have evolved at a constant rate from yeasts to humans. in the present study, we assume the evolutionary order of model organisms on the basis of the evolutionary distances from the viewpoint of humans, as described previously  <cit> . phosphorylated serine/threonine amino acids have an evolutionary rate similar to that of other amino acids and they exhibit rather low conservation  <cit> . however, proteins with constrained specific amino acid sequences, such as r-x-x-s/t, rather than a phosphorylated serine alone, are likely to be evolutionarily conserved  <cit> . these conserved motifs probably play important roles in cellular functions . thus, comparative evolutionary analyses based on sequence evolution are powerful tools for extracting phosphorylation signals that are directly linked to cellular functions. previous comparative evolutionary analyses of phosphorylation have focused on conserved sites for exploring the important signaling networks that are considered to be essential for cellular functions  <cit>  and for the rewiring of signaling networks  <cit> .

however, focusing on highly conserved sites would not allow us to extract the highly evolutionarily conserved signaling networks that are essential for cellular functions because additional signal transduction pathways have been acquired throughout evolution; therefore, low conservation sites are also important in cellular functions. however, it is also well known that several low conservation phosphosites do not have physiological functions. previous comparative analyses could not distinguish these differences; therefore, we developed a method for investigating evolutionary patterns to determine the peripheral components that have been acquired throughout evolution. we analyzed a large number of phosphosites and simplified the complex phosphorylation signaling networks. the same motifs located in different proteins are likely to be phosphorylated by a kinase that belongs to a closely related protein family and these motifs may be useful for identifying candidate kinases responsible for phosphorylation  <cit> . thus, we identified motifs as putative signaling modules added during specific evolutionary processes. we demonstrate that our method is a useful tool for analyzing and understanding intracellular signaling networks, thereby determining the regulatory mechanisms of cellular processes.

RESULTS
extraction of phosphomotifs
previous studies attempted to construct phosphomotifs for each kinase  <cit> . however, these studies focused on less than half of the known kinases, and the phosphomotifs are still not available to facilitate a comprehensive analysis of phosphorylation. by contrast, the information related to phosphosites has been updated and an analysis based on bioinformatics was published recently. to investigate the evolution of phosphomotifs, we extracted phosphomotifs from publicly available databases for phosphosites. phosphomotifs comprise the downstream and upstream regions that together form a phosphosite  <cit> . we extracted three types of phosphomotifs, i.e., x-x-x-x-x-ps/t/y, x-x-x-ps/t/y-x-x-x, and ps/t/y-x-x-x-x-x, from  <dig>  phosphosites in phosphositeplus  <cit> . we calculated the similarity scores between them by adding the score in the blosum <dig> substitution matrix at each sequence position, as described previously  <cit> . the sequence pairs with a similarity score > <dig> were clustered using the mcl  <cit>  to generate motifs that corresponded to three motif sequence patterns. thus, we obtained  <dig> clusters and manually extracted  <dig> phosphomotifs by identifying the conserved amino acids in each cluster . these motifs covered 77%  of the phosphosites used in the clustering analysis. they also included 57%, 51%, and 68% of all the serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues, respectively, obtained from all human proteins.

comparative evolutionary analysis of the phosphomotifs
we investigated the evolutionary conservation of the phosphosites in each motif to elucidate the physiological roles of the identified motifs. to analyze the evolutionary conservation, we selected model organisms with rich genome information, i.e., saccharomyces cerevisiae , schizosaccharomyces pombe , caenorhabditis elegans , drosophila melanogaster , danio rerio , canis familiaris , mus musculus , pan troglodytes , and homo sapiens . we obtained orthologous gene sets from kegg oc  <cit>  for the nine species. we constructed multiple sequence alignments of phosphoproteins in each orthologous group and identified species where a known phosphosite was conserved in a motif. we counted the number of proteins with phosphomotifs . in addition, we counted the conservation of the serine/threonine/tyrosine residues observed in all human proteins as potential phosphosites. the number of conserved residues between evolutionarily neighboring species increased to a maximum of only approximately 30% between the fish and dog in the case of serine/threonine residues, and approximately 32% between the worm and fish in the case of tyrosine residues . using the conservation rates of known and potential phosphosites, i.e., serine/threonine/tyrosine residues observed in all human proteins, we defined a conservation index to estimate the evolutionary conservation of phosphomotifs. the conservation index was calculated as the sum of the differences between the conservation rate of a known phosphomotif and that of the corresponding known and potential phosphomotifs in all species . this conservation index represented the conservation of a motif relative to the average amino acid conservation.

our  <dig> motifs included similar motifs, where only one or several amino acids differed. we investigated the correlation between the motif structures and the evolutionary conservation of our phosphomotifs, and we generated a network of motifs on the basis of their structural similarities . we observed that the motifs with proline adjacent to serine/threonine  were found often in mapk phosphomotifs with a low level of conservation, whereas the motifs  with an arginine residue upstream of the phosphosite were often observed in the phosphomotifs of agc kinases, and they were highly conserved. it is well known that the phosphomotifs used as substrates by kinases are related to the directional characteristics of kinases  <cit> . to investigate the correlations between the conservation indices and kinase families of our motifs, we extracted the known kinases from phosphositeplus; figure 1b shows the correlations. we observed that 86% of the kinases that phosphorylated the low conservation s/t-p motifs belonged to the cmgc family. however, 69% of the rxs/t motifs and 65% of the rxxs/t motifs were phosphorylated by the agc kinase family. these results suggest that the phosphorylating enzymes correlated with the motif structures and conservation level. to characterize the phosphomotifs, we investigated the protein–protein interactions with the motifs using known protein interaction information from biogrid  <cit>  and string  <cit> . the number of edges in an interaction network that contained the phosphomotifs was  <dig>  times larger than that in a randomized dataset , which suggests that proteins with a phosphomotif are likely to be connected with each other.figure  <dig>

figure 2a shows the conservation of the phosphomotifs and their conservation indices. we identified two different patterns for the phosphomotifs with high conservation indices. one was highly conserved in all species and its evolutionary conservation curves exhibited a relatively linear pattern. the other was highly conserved in humans and specific species where the evolutionary conservation curve exhibited a sigmoid pattern . we designated the former pattern as “linear” motifs and the latter as “sigmoid” motifs. it is assumed that the conservation of motifs exposed to evolutionary pressure will be dramatically higher among closely related species, thereby yielding sigmoid conservation patterns.figure  <dig>

the conservation of known phosphosites decreased slightly from humans to yeasts in a similar manner to the conservation of serine/threonine residues as if the motifs had not been exposed to evolutionary pressure. however, the motifs subjected to evolutionary pressure had a sigmoid-type pattern with dramatic changes among species . this suggests that the phosphorylation of motifs with sigmoid patterns is essential after speciation and that they originated from functional differences between species and their ancestral species . we extracted sigmoid-type motifs on the basis of a threshold value using the average rates of transitions and their standard deviations , which identified motifs  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> as those that increased after worm speciation; motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> for the fly; motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> for the fish; motifs  <dig> and  <dig> for the dog; and motif  <dig> for the mouse . to visualize the conservation relationship among known phosphosites and their motifs, we generated sequence logos  <cit> . the sequence logos confirmed that evolutionarily conserved phosphosites also contained highly conserved flanking regions . in addition, we investigated the conservation of phosphosites and the proteins containing these sites , which detected the conservation of phosphosites related or unrelated to protein conservation.

protein networks of highly conserved motifs in humans and the worm
we observed that motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were highly conserved in the fish and humans. motifs  <dig> and  <dig> shared eight sequences with quite similar sequence logos. these phosphomotifs were located within a kinase domain and they exhibited high conservation . in addition, the phosphosites in these motifs were highly conserved in the worm in known phosphomotifs and in the same motifs identified in all proteins . motifs  <dig> and  <dig> were observed in  <dig> serine/threonine kinases, i.e., 56%, 25%, and 11% in the agc kinase, camk, and ste kinase families, respectively . for motif  <dig>  we observed that 70%, 15%, and 15% were assigned to the tyrosine kinase, s/t kinase, and non-kinase families, respectively. we found that cmgc proteins could be aligned with agc and camk proteins in the sequence regions without motif  <dig> . the phosphosites in agc kinase family proteins with motifs  <dig> and  <dig> have been reported to be phosphorylated by pdk <dig>  a serine/threonine kinase  <cit> . we compared motifs  <dig> and  <dig> with the phosphomotifs for pdk <dig>  we confirmed that there was a highly conserved position of five amino acids downstream of the phosphorylated serine/threonine sites . in addition, the loss of pdk <dig> was lethal in species ranging from yeasts to mouse, which demonstrates that pdk <dig> is essential for the fundamental cellular activities . the results suggest that a number of orthologous groups may be substrates for pdk <dig>  which increased after worm speciation. of these phosphorylated motifs,  <dig> motifs were conserved in the worm, whereas three, two, and one sequences were conserved in the fly, fish, and fission yeast, respectively. most examples of motifs  <dig> and  <dig> were located in serine/threonine kinase domains, whereas most examples of motif  <dig> were located in tyrosine kinase domains recognized by tyrosine kinases such as the eph receptor, ptk, and btk . kinases that phosphorylate motif  <dig> have not been reported.figure  <dig>

c2h <dig> zinc finger proteins from highly conserved motifs in humans and the fly
motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were observed to be highly conserved motifs in species ranging from the fly to humans. motifs  <dig> and  <dig> shared most of the proteins related to each motif, although these motifs were different. motifs  <dig> and  <dig> also shared several of these proteins. a network of  <dig> proteins obtained from these motifs was extended using interaction information obtained from biogrid and string, similar to figure 2b, but only nine proteins were connected by known interaction information . we investigated the domain structures of these motifs using pfam search and observed that all phosphomotifs were related to a zinc finger motif . the c2h <dig> motif is a structure where two cysteines and two histidines chelate zinc and proteins and has multiple tandem zinc finger motifs that can bind to dna  <cit> . the c2h <dig> motifs were observed primarily in transcription factors, and over  <dig> c2h <dig> motifs have been identified in the human genome  <cit> . we detected  <dig> c2h <dig> motifs in our dataset. it has been reported that zinc finger proteins with c2h <dig> motifs regulate development and cell differentiation  <cit> . this motif was conserved in species ranging from the fly to humans, where a serine between cysteines and histidines, a threonine immediately downstream of the second histidine, and a tyrosine two amino acids upstream of the first cysteine in the c2h <dig> motif were phosphorylated.

to investigate the conservation of phosphosites in human c2h <dig> motifs, we produced the sequence logos of known c2h <dig> motifs. we observed that the tyrosines in motifs  <dig> and  <dig> and the threonines in motifs  <dig> and  <dig> were highly conserved in each motif .figure  <dig>

four phosphomotifs that increased after fly speciation were related to a c2h <dig> motif; therefore, we investigated whether the evolutionary conservation of the phosphomotifs and all c2h <dig> motifs were correlated . we observed that the number of c2h <dig> motifs increased after fish speciation, whereas the conservation of phosphomotifs increased after fly speciation, which suggests two different hypotheses: proteins that possess c2h <dig> motifs without phosphomotifs have increased selectively since fish speciation, and proteins with a c2h <dig> motif related to phosphorylation have been duplicated since fish speciation. to test these hypotheses, we investigated the frequencies of all the phosphomotifs. in the human genome,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> phosphomotifs were observed in motifs  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. the human genome contained a total of  <dig> phosphomotifs and 56% of them were related to motif  <dig>  which was considerably higher than the number of c2h <dig> motifs that increased in the fly. this suggests that proteins in the human genome with c2h <dig> motifs have been duplicated from the proteins that increased since fly speciation. the increase in c2h <dig> motifs in fish may reflect an increase in retroelements because the c2h <dig> motifs in zinc finger proteins have been evolutionarily duplicated by retroelements  <cit> . thus, we investigated the sequence differences between all c2h <dig> and phosphorylated c2h <dig> motifs. we extracted a sequence that started two amino acids upstream of the first cysteine until the last histidine as the overall c2h <dig> motif. the c2h <dig> motif sequences were classified into three groups depending on their lengths, i.e.,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> amino acids. we observed that 94% of the c2h <dig> motifs belonged to these three groups, where 90% of these were 23-amino acid c2h <dig> motifs . these three c2h <dig> motifs differed from the 23-amino acid-type motif in terms of the presence of only one and two amino acid insertions between the histidines in the 24- and 25-amino acid-type c2h <dig> motifs, respectively, and there were no other amino acid changes . we investigated the differences between all c2h <dig> motifs and the phosphorylated 23-amino acid c2h <dig> motifs. the 1st tyrosine was present in  <dig> % of all the 23-amino acid c2h <dig> motifs, and the 24th threonine was present in  <dig> % of the c2h <dig> motifs. therefore, these two amino acids could be universal in c2h <dig> motifs.

c2h <dig> zinc finger motifs are fundamental functional motifs in species ranging from yeasts to humans. we generated sequence logos for all c2h <dig> motifs coded by organisms from yeasts to humans . in the first sites of motifs  <dig> and  <dig>  a fraction of the tyrosines had increased throughout evolution, although phenylalanines dominated in yeasts. it has been reported that a phosphorylated threonine in motifs  <dig> and  <dig> affects the interactions between the c2h <dig> motif and dna sequences, thereby regulating the cell cycle  <cit> . these previous reports indicate that comparative motif analysis is a powerful tool for extracting biologically important phosphomotifs. we focused on motif  <dig>  for which the regulation of phosphorylation has not been reported. to investigate whether the phosphorylation of motif  <dig> is related to the functions of c2h <dig> motifs, we generated oligo sequences that mimicked c2h <dig> motifs, i.e., 2×c2h2-yf, where we replaced y with f in motif  <dig>  and 2×c2h2-sn, where we replaced s with n in motif  <dig>  which had the smallest evolutionary effect as a control sequence, based on the znf <dig> sequence containing a phosphorylated c2h <dig> motif for motifs  <dig> and  <dig> . 2×c2h <dig> labeled with mcfp was transfected into cos cells, and 2×c2h <dig> localized to the nucleus and cytosol. 2×c2h <dig> was not likely to have localized to the nucleus because of the loss of the scan domain and nls  <cit> . as a control, we observed localization when fluorescent proteins were co-expressed. m1venus-2×c2h <dig> was highly localized to the nucleolus compared with mcfp. we compared the localization to the nucleolus of 2×c2h <dig> and 2×c2h2-yf . we observed that the yf mutant was localized to the nucleolus at a higher level compared with the wild type. this suggests that the phosphorylation of motif  <dig> in the wild type inhibits localization to the nucleolus and that the tyrosine in motif  <dig> regulates the localization of c2h <dig> motifs because the yf mutant exhibited strong localization to the nucleolus.

regulatory pathways of rna splicing and insulin signaling based on highly conserved motifs in humans and the fish
motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were highly conserved in species ranging from humans to the fish. to explore whether the phosphomotifs were correlated with specific physiological protein functions in the motifs described above, we performed functional enrichment analysis based on gene ontology   <cit>  for proteins with known phosphosites . motif  <dig> increased after fish speciation, and the results suggested that it was correlated with cell migration and insulin signaling proteins. in addition, motif  <dig> appeared to be present in proteins related to rna processing and rna splicing. we observed that  <dig> proteins included these motifs and their functional categories were classified using uniprot annotation information . in addition, motif  <dig> was observed in several rna splicing components. motif  <dig> was observed in adapter proteins that play a role downstream of the growth factor signals, such as insulin signaling. approximately half of the proteins with these five motifs were classified into three functional groups: insulin signaling molecules, rna splicing-related factors, and cytoskeleton regulation factors. subsequently, we investigated the connectivity of these motifs in molecular interaction networks. the number of proteins with known phosphomotifs was considerably small, and it was difficult to assign correct biological functions using a network that only connected them; therefore, we produced an interaction network related to proteins, including phosphomotifs, using known interaction information from biogrid and string. the interaction networks reconstructed using each motif that increased after fish speciation included signal transduction, rna splicing, and cytoskeleton-related proteins . we obtained an interaction network with  <dig> edges using  <dig> protein nodes. the 14-3- <dig> proteins in this network had significantly more interactions compared with a randomly generated network with the same number of nodes . the network reconstructed using these five motifs had a network structure where 14-3- <dig> kinases linked three pathways: splicing, cytoskeleton regulation, and insulin signaling. the 14-3- <dig> family proteins bind to phosphoserine-containing proteins and motifs phosphorylated by agc and camk family members  <cit> . in humans, seven subfamilies of the 14-3- <dig> protein family have been reported, and they dramatically increased after fish speciation, whereas only two are known in the fly. the 14-3- <dig> proteins may be involved in protein phosphorylation signaling, and the evolution of 14-3- <dig> proteins and phosphomotifs may be correlated. in addition, it has been reported that insulin signaling pathways induce neuronal survival via alternative splicing of the protein kinase cdii isoform  <cit> . the splicing-related proteins and signal modules of the insulin signaling-related proteins that emerged after fish speciation may have co-evolved.figure  <dig>

addition of the signaling network of phosphomotifs with sigmoid conservation patterns to the core signaling network led to the acquisition of new cellular functions
the phosphomotifs that appeared after fish speciation were components of the signaling networks related to fundamental functions such as the cytoskeletal regulation, signaling, and splicing. these networks are common signaling networks, but it is considered that these functions have probably been conserved since before fish speciation. these results suggest that the motifs that have increased since fish speciation may be related to the expansion of the signaling networks. thus, we investigated the conservation of all known phosphosites in our motifs using human proteins from these signaling networks.

in addition, we analyzed the conservation of known phosphorylations observed in cytoskeleton, signaling, and splicing-related proteins, as well as all human phosphoproteins. we observed that the conservation of phosphosites related to insulin signaling proteins and cytoskeletal proteins increased greatly between the speciation of the fish and fly compared with the conservation of all phosphorylations . however, the conservation of spliceosomal protein phosphorylation was the same as the average among all human proteins. spliceosomal proteins comprise the core component proteins  of the spliceosome and common proteins that regulate splicing by interacting with the core component proteins  <cit> . we compared the conservation of phosphosites in each complex  and found that the core components that catalyze splicing were more highly conserved than all common proteins. by contrast, the common components exhibited a high increase after fish speciation . the common components included splicing regulatory factors for heterogeneous nuclear rnp  and serine-arginine-rich  proteins. these proteins are related to the regulation of alternative splicing. alternative splicing is well known to have increased after the emergence of vertebrates  <cit> . thus, the components of the network isolated on the basis of this analysis may affect the diversity of alternative splicing. these results suggest that physiologically important signaling proteins such as spliceosomal proteins expanded during multiple stages of evolution.figure  <dig>

we investigated whether the motifs with the sigmoid pattern are related to the expansion of signaling networks. the sigmoid motifs appeared since the worm; thus, we defined the core signaling network as a network that comprised proteins with phosphosites conserved from the yeast to humans. in addition, the network of proteins that interacted with the core signaling network was defined as the additional network that expanded during evolution after the yeast . using these networks, we extracted a network that comprised proteins with the sigmoid-type motifs . most of the proteins with sigmoid-type motifs appeared to be in the additional network. to validate this bias toward the additional network among the sigmoid-type motifs, we compared it with the random networks. as a result, we found that the proteins with the sigmoid-type phosphomotifs were significantly more likely to be located in the additional network . in the fly, a small number of proteins with sigmoid -type phosphomotifs were present in the network because most of these proteins are functionally unknown zinc finger proteins and the interactions among them are still unknown. however, both of the proteins related to the fly were present in the additional network, and we could not find them in the core signaling network. these results suggest that the sigmoid-type phosphomotifs could be related to the expansion of the core signaling network.

furthermore, to investigate the relationship between phosphomotifs and their biological functions, we enriched the phosphomotifs based on their go biological functions. in general, motifs that increased after speciation events distant from humans were more likely to have correlated functions, whereas motifs that increased after the emergence of mammals lacked correlations with any functions . these results suggest that the conserved patterns of the phosphomotifs are closed in networks with similar functions.

discussion
in this study, we performed comparative analyses of phosphosites using a wide variety of methods and extracted physiologically important phosphorylations on the basis of their evolutionary conservation. our approach has the advantage that it allowed us to analyze the species with increased phosphomotifs based on their evolutionary conservation patterns, whereas it is difficult for conventional methods to handle these evolutionary patterns because they focus only on phosphosite residues. in addition, our analysis using phosphomotifs allowed us to predict the kinases responsible for regulating the networks. we extracted  <dig> motifs, including known motifs, which we subjected to a comparative evolutionary analysis. these motifs covered approximately 60% of the serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues observed in the human genome, regardless of the presence/absence of phosphorylation. the remaining 40% residues may not have been covered because of the systematic bias in the phosphorylation information obtained from publicly available databases. most of the phosphorylation data stored in databases has been produced by large-scale phosphoproteomic analyses. large-scale phosphoproteomic analysis is a recently developed technology and it is focused primarily on cell growth-related proteomics. the motifs we used included several motifs phosphorylated by cmgc family members related to kinases that regulate cell growth. the efficiency of connecting proteins with the same phosphomotif was  <dig>  times higher than that of randomized protein sets, which suggests that our selections of motifs had biological significance. however, the sigmoid-type motifs isolated in this study lacked high connectivity. thus, the connectivity of sigmoid-type phosphorylations may have been affected less by evolutionary selection, and it may have been determined by other factors. our approach is similar to the isolation of signaling pathways using chromatography based on the conservation of phosphomotifs under the effects of evolutionary pressure . we isolated motifs that exhibited dramatic changes between species in separate networks and detected the conservation rates based on nine species, which ranged from yeasts to humans. this analysis showed that the phosphorylation networks acquired by humans since distant speciation events include additional network modules and core signaling networks. this suggests that the added networks are involved with specific functions such as kinase activity regulation  and control of the localization of zinc finger proteins , thereby facilitating the spread of information through kinase cascades and transcriptional regulation . the additional phosphorylation networks were more complex in species closer to humans. the signaling networks added after fish speciation involved alternative splicing-related factors, cytoskeleton regulatory factors, and insulin signaling regulatory factors. each network was connected via 14-3- <dig> proteins; therefore, it is assumed that they cooperate with, or are regulated by, closely related kinase family members. furthermore, specific functional networks could not be obtained for species close to humans, which was obvious in the enrichment analysis . this was probably because the additional networks were small and they were regulated by diverse signals in species closer to humans. we also observed evolutionary changes relative to humans. it may be possible to increase the number of networks if we use species that are more distant from mammals and increase the total number of species.figure  <dig>

in this study, we validated the conservation of motifs and reconstructed pathways based only on known phosphosites. however, there may be differences in the evolutionary conservation of the motifs from all proteins and those that are already known to be phosphorylated. we used  <dig> , <dig> serine/threonine/tyrosine residues in this study. however, we only used  <dig>  residues with known phosphorylations in the comparative analysis, which comprised only  <dig> % of all residues. to isolate more reliable networks, we performed an analysis that was limited to the known phosphosites, although the number was considerably small. recently, the volume of phosphosite information has increased dramatically because of the development of phosphoproteomic techniques based on mass spectrometry. these large-scale datasets should allow us to isolate larger numbers of more reliable signal transduction networks.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we identified  <dig> phosphomotifs from publicly available phosphosite information and developed a method for detecting conserved phosphomotifs among species. we found that the highly conserved phosphomotifs in a specific species were related to important cellular processes. our study suggests that the phosphorylation networks acquired during evolution have added signaling networks to the core signaling networks. our method can be helpful not only for screening functionally important phosphosites but also for the classification of molecular networks added throughout the evolutionary process.
