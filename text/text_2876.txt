BACKGROUND
cytoskeletal networks  play important roles in many fundamental processes in eukaryotes including cell growth, cell division and development of organisms  <cit> . understanding cytoskeleton organization, dynamics and functions is an active area of research in biology. molecular motors that organize and remodel cytoskeleton and transport various cellular components  play fundamental roles in all aspects of cell and developmental biology of eukaryotes  <cit> . high throughput genomic sequencing projects have greatly facilitated the identification of the full complement of molecular motors in several phylogenetically diverse species ranging from simple unicellular to complex multicellular organisms  <cit> .

molecular motors that function on cytoskeletal networks belong to three groups: kinesins, dyneins and myosins. these motors utilize energy derived from atp hydrolysis and transport cargo unidirectionally on one of the filamentous cytoskeletal tracks  in the cell. both kinesins and dyneins use mts as tracks for motility whereas myosins use actin filaments   <cit> . kinesins constitute a superfamily of mt motor proteins ubiquitous in all eukaryotic organisms  <cit> . in the mid 1980s, the first kinesin was discovered in squid giant axons as a "novel force generating protein" involved in vesicular transport  <cit> . since then, an explosion of research has centered upon the continual discovery, classification and functional characterization of the kinesin superfamily. members of the kinesin superfamily have a highly conserved motor domain of ~ <dig> amino acid residues, which contains atpase and mt binding activities, located at the n terminus, c terminus or internally  <cit> . a short neck region that often contains family-specific features and is adjacent to the motor domain works in concert with the catalytic core to produce movement  <cit> . in addition, many kinesins have a less conserved coiled-coil region that is important for dimerization and a non-conserved tail domain that is thought to interact with specific cargo. all kinesins bind mts and perform a variety of force-generating tasks such as movement of chromosomes, vesicles, organelles and rna protein complexes, spindle formation and elongation, activation of protein kinases, movement of loosely bound rafts of soluble cargo, and mt polymerization and dynamics  <cit> .

since the motor-domain sequence is conserved in all kinesins, it has been used to search completed eukaryotic genome sequences for encoded kinesins. based on phylogenetic analyses of known kinesins using the conserved motor domain sequences, fourteen families designated as kinesin- <dig> to kinesin- <dig> are recognized  <cit> . members of most families have an n-terminal motor domain whereas one family  has an internal motor and one family  has a c-terminal motor. kinesins move unidirectionally on mts. kinesins with the n-terminal motor show plus end motility whereas the c-terminal motors move toward the minus ends of mts  <cit> .

while a "complete" inventory of arabidopsis kinesins has been reported, functional studies of plant kinesins are limited to a few loci  <cit> . several plant kinesins have been shown to function in mitosis, meiosis and/or cytokinesis  <cit> . kcbp, a c-terminal minus-end-directed calmodulin-binding kinesin of the kinesin- <dig> family, is involved in trichome morphogenesis and cell division  <cit> . this kinesin is negatively regulated by calmodulin as well as another novel calcium-binding protein  with a single ef hand  <cit> . an internal kinesin of the kinesin- <dig> family in arabidopsis is also involved in trichome morphogenesis  <cit> . atfral, an n-terminal kinesin family member is involved in oriented deposition of cellulose myofibrils; mutants show aberrant deposition of cellulose microfibrils in secondary walls of fibers that are less organized when compared to the wild type  <cit> . two arabidopsis kinesins are targeted to mitochondria whereas another kinesin interacts with geminivirus replicating protein  <cit> . an interesting prospect of mt and microfilament crosstalk has recently been exemplified by studies with a plant-specific kinesin  from cotton. this member of the kinesin- <dig> family has a calponin homology domain, which appears to be important in mediating dynamic interaction between actin filaments and mts  <cit> . the motility properties of only a few plant kinesins have been analyzed  <cit> .

thus far, genome-wide analysis of kinesin encoding genes in plants was performed only with one plant species , which uncovered  <dig> kinesins. the number of kinesins in arabidopsis is the largest as compared to human, mouse and other completed genomes  <cit> . recently, genome sequences of six phylogenetically divergent photosynthetic eukaryotes  have been completed. in addition, genomes of seven other non-plant systems including giardia, which may represent the deepest known branch in the eukaryotic lineage  have also been sequenced. the availability of these genome sequences offers opportunities to address a number of important questions related to kinesin evolution and function. these include: i) do other plants, like arabidopsis, have a large repertoire of kinesins? ii) are there any kinesin families that are specific to plants or a particular lineage? iii) how many kinesin families are represented in all eukaryotes? iv) what is the evolutionary relationship among plant kinesins and between plant and non-plant kinesins? v) what is the full complement of kinesins in early-derived simple unicellular photosynthetic eukaryotes as well as in organisms that represent early diverging eukaryotic lineages? vi) how have these kinesins contributed to evolution of kinesins in the most recent complex multicellular flowering plants? vii) do plant kinesins have any domains that are unique to plants? and viii) what is the contribution of gene duplications and losses to kinesin evolution? to address these questions, we have mined  <dig> kinesin sequences from  <dig> phylogenetically diverse species. we have performed comprehensive analyses with this data set and inferred gene trees using bayesian and parsimony methods. our gene-tree analyses included  <dig> sequences from photosynthetic eukaryotes and  <dig> from non-photosynthetic systems. many of these sequences were not included in any previous analyses. although flowering plants have the largest number of kinesins, three or four of the  <dig> kinesin families are not represented in flowering plants whereas three of them may not be present in any photosynthetic eukaryote. results presented here also indicate that flowering plants have the most kinesins primarily due to expansion of the kinesin- <dig> and kinesin- <dig> families. our gene-tree analysis revealed seven of the ten families found in flowering plants are represented in a simple unicellular chlorophyte alga. ten of the  <dig> families are represented in giardia lamblia , an early derived eukaryote, suggesting that most families were already present early in the evolution of extant eukaryotes. plant kinesins have several domains that are not shared with non-plant systems suggesting functional specificity and diversification in plants.

RESULTS
kinesins in photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic eukaryotes
in this study we have analyzed genome sequences of  <dig> eukaryotic species, which represent almost all major lineages  of eukaryotes  <cit> , for kinesins. species were selected so as to include most of the eight major lineages in the consensus phylogenetic tree presented by baldauf  <cit> . inclusion of representative members of non-plant groups is expected to help us identify plant-specific kinesins. of the eight major eukaryotic lineages  <cit> , only one lineage  was not sampled in our analysis because none of the species in this lineage has been fully sequenced. among the  <dig> species analyzed, seven represent phylogenetically divergent photosynthetic eukaryotes that belong to monocots , dicots , a chlorophyte alga , a red alga  and a diatom . so far, kinesins have been analyzed only in one plant  system  <cit>  whereas the genome sequences of six other photosynthetic eukaryotes have been completed recently. the red  and green  algae were included in our analysis because they are inferred to be early derived members of the lineage that gave rise to modern heterokonts and embryophyta  <cit> , respectively. inclusion of these species allows for the analysis of evolutionary relationships between kinesins of algae and flowering plants. the  <dig> non-plant species sampled include opisthokonts, amoebozoa, alveolates, heterokonts, discicristates and excavates. we have included members  of three extant lineages that diverged before the plant-animal split  <cit> . in addition, giardia is thought to be a member of the earliest extant branch on the eukaryotic tree based on the phylogeny inferred from several different genes, as well as a proteome-based eukaryotic phylogeny  <cit> . it would be interesting to see how many kinesin families were present before the divergence of plants, animals and fungi as it is likely that these families would represent a "basic set" of kinesin motors  <cit> . we have also included dictyostelium discoideum, which is believed to have diverged after the plant-animal split but before the divergence of fungi from animals  <cit> .

as detailed in the methods section, we have used a variety of approaches to systematically analyze the completed genome sequences of  <dig> species to identify the kinesins. a total of  <dig> kinesins were identified and used in our phylogenetic analysis. table  <dig> shows the number of kinesins in each of these species and lists the databases used in our searches. the details of the kinesins including gene ids, gene organization, domain and family information for each species, except arabidopsis, are presented in tables  <dig> to  <dig> and additional files  <dig> to  <dig>  the details of arabidopsis kinesins were reported previously  <cit> . the number of kinesins varies considerably among species. in general flowering plants have the highest number of kinesins . arabidopsis still has the largest repertoire of kinesins  <cit>  amongst the completed plant genomes, with p. trichocarpa next  <cit> . oryza sativa ssp. japonica and o.s. indica have  <dig> and  <dig> kinesins, respectively. some changes in this number may occur as refinement of newly sequenced genomes proceeds. not only does arabidopsis have the most kinesins of all plants; it has the most of all  <dig> species analyzed . it is surprising to see the large difference in kinesin number between the two species of early-derived unicellular photosynthetic eukaryotes . the green alga, c. reinhardtii, has about five times  <cit>  the number of kinesins as the red algae, c. merolae, which has the least number of kinesins  of all species sampled. dictyostelium discoideum, the social soil amoeba, has  <dig> kinesins. this is consistent with what one would expect from a free living amoeba that must search for its food and be active in cytoskeletal motility, in addition to being able to shift from a unicellular state to a multicellular fruiting body by coordinated aggregation of individual cells  <cit> . another interesting species with many kinesins is the intracellular immune system pathogen l. major. this parasite has the most kinesins among non-photosynthetic eukaryotes . leishmania has a considerably larger repertoire of kinesins than the amoeboid parasite, many of which appear to have evolved by multiple gene duplications . even though cis-splicing machinery exists in this parasite, its  <dig> kinesins are all translated from single exon genes . the reason why this parasite has so many kinesins is an interesting prospect to consider. how many of these kinesins are actually functional remains to be seen. whether or not these kinesins function in facilitating leishmania-host-cell interaction is currently unknown.

construction and analyses of kinesin gene trees
we used  <dig> kinesin motor domain sequences in our gene-tree analysis. the alignment of amino acid sequences was performed using dialign-t  <cit> . dialign-t represents an improvement over dialign  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  in that it is less liable to favor short sequence fragments of high similarity over longer fragments of lower similarity  <cit> . in contrast to programs such as clustal x  <cit> , which perform global alignments, dialign finds regions of local similarity without necessarily aligning the entire sequences with one another  <cit> . because dialign does not perform alignments following a guide tree, the alignments produced were expected to be relatively robust to artifacts that may be introduced when aligning divergent sequences in a pairwise manner  <cit> . dialign has been shown to perform well relative to other alignment programs in aligning conserved domains within rapidly evolving  regions  <cit> . four kinesin trees were constructed with motor domain amino acid sequences using both the parsimony and bayesian approaches. for each approach, amino-acid-characters and amino-acid-plus-gap-characters were used. the dialign-t alignment , data matrices  used to construct the tree and two parsimony and one bayesian trees  are available online.

the abbreviated unrooted bayesian tree for the amino-acid-plus-gap-characters analysis is presented in fig.  <dig> as our best estimate of the relationships within the kinesin gene family. the expanded view of kinesin subfamilies is presented in figures  <dig> to  <dig>  this analysis was favored over those that did not incorporate gap characters because it incorporated all available characters from the motor domain and is, therefore, favored by the total-evidence criterion  <cit> . furthermore, inclusion of the gap characters increased both the number of clades resolved  and average branch support  in both the bayesian and parsimony analyses, which is consistent with the general patterns found by simmons et al.,  <cit> . the bayesian analysis was favored over the parsimony analysis because the inferred bayesian tree is more resolved than the parsimony tree and the additional resolution is largely congruent with previous analyses with respect to resolution of the  <dig> kinesin families. the other three gene trees from both bayesian and parsimony analyses are available as supplemental data .

each branch of the bayesian tree in fig.  <dig> indicates the posterior probability from the amino-acid-plus-gap-characters analysis at the upper left of the branch. to allow for inspection of the support for each branch provided by the other analyses, the posterior probability from the amino-acid-characters-only analysis is at the upper right of each branch, the parsimony jackknife support from the amino-acid-plus-gap-characters analysis is at the lower left, and the parsimony jackknife support from the amino-acid-characters-only analysis is at the lower right. if a branch was unresolved in one of these other three analyses, it is indicated by "-" at the respective location. if a branch was contradicted in one of these other three analyses, it is indicated by underlined red font at the respective location with the single highest posterior probability or jackknife support value for the contradicting clade shown.

conflict between parsimony and bayesian trees
there were three cases of well supported, conflicting resolution in which both bayesian trees were contradicted by both parsimony trees. first, in the parsimony trees pt  <dig> was well supported as nested within the second kinesin- <dig> clade, whereas it was well supported as nested within the kinesin- <dig> clade in the bayesian trees. aside from this single sequence, the kinesin- <dig> and kinesin- <dig> clades were largely congruent in all four trees . the parsimony resolution is supported by the kinesin-10-specific domains that pt  <dig> has, whereas the sequence lacks the kinesin-14-specific domains. therefore, we favor the parsimony resolution of pt  <dig> as a member of the kinesin- <dig> family . second, in the parsimony trees tp  <dig> was well supported as the sister group of tp  <dig>  whereas the clades of  and  were well supported in the bayesian trees with the former clade resolved with the kinesin- <dig> family . there are no additional domains of tp  <dig> or tp  <dig> to distinguish between these alternative resolutions. third, in the parsimony trees ps  <dig> was unresolved in the main polytomy, whereas it was well supported as nested within the kinesin- <dig> clade in the bayesian trees . the bayesian resolution is supported by the kinesin-3-specific domain that ps  <dig> has.

to test for long-branch attraction  <cit>  in the parsimony analyses between pt  <dig> and the second kinesin- <dig> clade, the amino-acid-plus-gap-characters parsimony jackknife analysis was repeated after eliminating all nine other sequences in the second kinesin- <dig> clade  <cit> . however, this explanation was not supported because pt  <dig> was unresolved in the main polytomy rather than moving to within the kinesin- <dig> clade. likewise, to test for long-branch attraction in the parsimony analyses in the second case of conflicting resolution, the parsimony jackknife analysis was repeated after eliminating tp  <dig>  however, this explanation was not supported because both tp  <dig> and ps  <dig> were unresolved in the main polytomy rather than being resolved as sister groups. therefore, we were unable to discard either of the two alternative hypotheses regarding the relationships of tp  <dig> and tp  <dig>  because ps  <dig> was unresolved in the main polytomy on the parsimony trees, it was not possible to apply this test to it.

many new kinesins are not grouped into recognized kinesin families
all  <dig> currently recognized kinesin families  <cit>  are represented in our inferred gene tree . all members in each family are presented in figs.  <dig> to  <dig>  however, 11% of the sequences  were not resolved among the lineages corresponding to previously recognized families . most of these kinesins are from leishmania, giardia, phytopthora, chlamydomonas and thallassiosira. these sequences may represent novel kinesin families and/or early-derived members of the  <dig> recognized kinesin families that are not resolved as such in our inferred gene tree. several clades that are not part of the known families contained members from two eukaryotic groups, indicating that they are not unique to one of the eight main eukaryotic lineages  <cit> . a strongly supported clade of ten kinesins  from flowering plants were not resolved into any of the  <dig> kinesin families. however, these formed a distinct clade  with strong support values from all four analyses. interestingly, the members of this group also have an armadillo domain that is not present in any invertebrates or vertebrates .

at least three of the  <dig> kinesin families are absent in flowering plants
the distribution of kinesin families in the  <dig> species sampled is shown in fig.  <dig>  some families  are present in almost all of the main eukaryotic lineages. although flowering plants have the largest number of kinesins, at least three of the  <dig> families are conspicuously absent in flowering plants. it is unclear whether either three or four  of these  <dig> families are absent in flowering plants because of the entirely unresolved flowering-plant clade . members of kinesin- <dig> form either homo- or heterodimers and are present in ciliated and flagellated cells and function in organelle-intraflagellar transport  <cit> . interestingly, the flagellated unicellular photosynthetic eukaryote chlamydomonas has one kinesin- <dig>  which is also involved in intraflagellar transport  <cit> . since flowering plants lack cilia or flagella in their life cycle, this family of kinesins is lost in this lineage. it would be interesting to see if the land plants that have ciliated/flagellated cells in their life cycle  retained this family of kinesins. unfortunately, genomes of plants that belong to these groups have not been sequenced to address this. members of the kinesin- <dig> family are involved in organelle transport. the kinesin- <dig> family is expanded in animals with seven members in humans, the largest of any family. interestingly,  <dig> of the  <dig> leishmania kinesins are grouped within the kinesin- <dig> family and this grouping is strongly supported by both bayesian analyses. it appears that lineage-specific duplication of genes contributed to expansion of this family. the fork-head-associated  domain present in vertebrate members of this family is absent in all kinesin- <dig> members of leishmania, suggesting that the acquisition of this domain occurred after the divergence of the leishmania and animal lineages. the kinesin- <dig> family, which is also involved in transport of vesicles, is underrepresented in plants. it was previously speculated  <cit>  that there might be a higher plant kinesin-1/khc family member but it was not conclusive. it appears that arabidopsis and o. sativa have one kinesin-1/khc gene and the diatom has two, whereas there may not be a kinesin- <dig> in chlamydomonas. overall, cargo-transporting kinesins are either absent  or underrepresented  in flowering plants. the cargo-transport functions of some of these kinesins are either not needed in flowering plants or performed by members of other families of kinesins or cargo transporting myosins, which are expanded in plants  <cit> . although kinesin- <dig> family members are absent in flowering plants, they are present in two photosynthetic eukaryotes . it appears that this family is lost in flowering plants. the functions of the kinesin- <dig> family are unknown  <cit> . members of the kinesin- <dig> family function in signal transduction and contain a few highly divergent kinesins and are absent not only in plants but in many other lineages  <cit> .

forty indica kinesins have orthologs in japonica and three of these  are duplicated in indica only. the duplications found in indica may have occurred recently or japonica sequence may not be complete. in addition, two kinesins in indica  have no counterparts in japonica whereas one kinesin in japonica  has no counterpart in indica, suggesting that either a specific kinesin is lost in one cultivar or it is due to differences in unsequenced gaps in the genome of these two rice cultivars.

two families  are vastly expanded in plants
kinesin- <dig>  the c-terminal motor family, and the kinesin- <dig> family have greatly expanded in plants through gene duplication. kinesin- <dig> is a diverse family containing eukaryotic representatives from almost all major eukaryotic groups; therefore, the members of this family are likely to play important evolutionarily conserved cellular roles. kinesin- <dig> family members show minus-end motility and perform multiple functions in cell division and organelle transport  <cit> . kinesin- <dig> is the largest family of kinesins in flowering plants . flowering plant kinesins in this family contain several domains that are not present in non-plant kinesins. in the kinesin- <dig> family, there are several subfamilies in which the motor domain is located in the middle or at the n or c terminus. it is interesting to observe the many plant-specific kinesin duplications . based on the inferred phylogenetic relationships among the plant species sampled  <cit> , we infer a minimum of nine duplications in the top clade of flowering-plant lineage  prior to the divergence of monocots from dicots, seven duplications within the dicot lineage, and one duplication within the monocot lineage . because the green and red algae kinesin- <dig> sequences are resolved as sister to the upper kinesin- <dig> flowering-plant clade, we also infer that there was a plant-specific duplication prior to the divergence of the red and green algae. one of the two copies was then lost in both the red and green algae lineages, yet retained in the flowering-plant lineage.

the first subfamily of the kinesin- <dig> family has plant-specific kinesins that are shared by the both the green and the red algae . members of flowering plants in this group have a calponin-homology  domain that is not present in green or red algae, suggesting that this domain was gained in the flowering-plant lineage . the second group that is well supported by all four analyses only includes kinesins from flowering plants . interestingly, members of these two top most groups have an internal motor domain instead of the c-terminal motor domain for which this family is named. another group that is restricted to the plant kingdom deals with the n-terminal flowering plant-specific group in the kinesin- <dig> family . perhaps the n-terminal and internal motor groups in the family could have arisen in flowering plants by domain shuffling of a c-terminal motor. the members of the seventh group with a c-terminal motor contain a myosin tail homology  <dig>  region and talin-like region  that are not present in any non-plant kinesins. the last large subfamily of the kinesin- <dig> family is reflective of true c-terminal motors in plants, diatoms, animals and protozoans . from this analysis it appears that the kinesin- <dig> family is composed of multiple subfamilies instead of the two previously reported kinesin-14a and kinesin-14b families  <cit> . based on the location of the motor and the presence of other domains, there could be up to eight subfamilies within the kinesin- <dig> family . there appears to be several dicot- and monocot-specific duplications in plant kinesins of this family. several of the subfamilies resulted primarily due to the emergence of novel kinesins in the plant lineage. the members of this family with the c-terminal motor domain have been shown to be minus-end motors  <cit> . although plant motors with a c-terminal domain translocate toward the minus-end of mts  <cit> , it is not known if the internal and n-terminal plant motors are also minus-end motors. the functions of several arabidopsis kinesin- <dig> family members that contain the motor domain at the c terminus , n terminus  and kca <dig> ) or in the middle  have been analyzed. several of these  are involved in some aspect of cell division  <cit> , suggesting that the plant kinesins of this family play important roles in cell division. the cotton homolog of arabidopsis katd localizes to cortical mts and microfilaments and interacts directly with f-actin  <cit> . grimp/kca <dig> interacts with a geminivirus replication protein and localizes to segregating chromosomes and spindle poles  <cit> . both grimp/kca <dig> and kca <dig> interact with a cyclin-dependent kinase , which controls cell cycle progression, and localizes to mts and phragmoplast  <cit> , suggesting a role for these also in cell division. the fact that plants have unique mt arrays such as the preprophase band and phragmoplast that play critical roles in plant cell division, lack centrosomes to organize mts to establish a bipolar spindle  <cit>  and have no  dyneins,  <cit> , which are also minus-end motors, suggests that plants would require novel kinesins to perform these plant-specific roles and to cover the functions performed by dyneins in animals. in addition, several reports indicate that plants transport macromolecules  and viruses form cell to cell through plasmodesmata  <cit> . such transport activities may also require kinesins. hence, it is possible that the expansion of kinesins in plants accounts for the need for plant-specific motors in flowering plants.

kinesin-7/cenp-e is the second largest kinesin family in plants and one clade  contains kinesins from only photosynthetic eukaryotes with a green algal kinesin as a sister group to those from the flowering plants. the flowering-plant-specific clade is strongly supported by both bayesian and parsimony analyses. hence, multiple members in a species in this clade  are inferred to have arisen by at least six gene duplications in the flowering-plant lineage prior to the divergence of monocots from dicots, five in the dicot lineage, and one in the monocot lineage. the functions of two members of this clade have been reported. kinesins encoded by at1g <dig>   <cit>  and at3g <dig>   <cit>  encode functionally related motors. loss-of-function mutants of these kinesins revealed their role in cytokinesis  <cit> . interestingly the nack <dig> activates a map kinase   <cit> . the second clade in this family also contains flowering plants, amoebozoa and heterokonts, but not opisthokonts . two arabidopsis members of this group are targeted to mitochondria  <cit> , implying an unknown function for these kinesins in this organelle. the third group contains kinesins from flowering plants and amoebozoa. members of these groups are inferred to be more closely related to one another than to the small, animal subfamily. because of extensive duplication in the cenp-e family in plants, the members of this family may have been recruited to perform plant-specific functions. in animals, members of this family function in capturing kinetechore mts. studies with some members of plant kinesins that belong to kinesin- <dig> indicate their role in cytokinesis and some unknown function in mitochondria  <cit> . overall, our analyses indicate that there was tremendous diversification in kinsin- <dig> and kinesin- <dig> families in flowering plants.

seven of the ten kinesin families in flowering plants are present in chlamydomonas
chlamydomonas, a member of chlorophyte algae, represents the sister group of the flowering plants given our taxon sampling  <cit> . hence, the analysis of kinesin families in this species should provide some insights into evolution of kinesins in flowering plants. chlamydomonas, despite the fact that it is unicellular, has  <dig> kinesins . twenty of these were grouped into nine recognized families whereas the remaining three are ungrouped . kinesin- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> families are absent in chlamydomonas. of the ten kinesin families present in flowering plants, seven are present in chlamydomonas . three families  of flowering plants are inferred to have been lost in the chlamydomonas lineage. two families  that are present in chlamydomonas were lost in the flowering-plant lineage. one of these families  is involved in intraflagellar transport. as mentioned above, the absence of flagella/cilia in flowering plants may have resulted in the loss of this family.

the red alga  has only five kinesins that belong to four families  whereas the diatom  has  <dig> kinesins  that fall into nine known kinesin families with four kinesins unresolved . although the green alga and the diatom have nine families, unlike chlamydomonas, the diatom has kinesin- <dig> and kinesin- <dig> but may not have members of the kinesin- <dig> or kinesin- <dig> families. remarkably, kinesin- <dig> is the largest family in all photosynthetic eukaryotes. among the  <dig> recognized families, only four  were shown to be present in all photosynthetic eukaryotes . the absence of myosins and dyneins in the red alga  suggests that kinesins play important roles in this species  <cit> .

giardia, an early-derived eukaryote, has ten of the fourteen kinesin families
in giardia there are  <dig> kinesins . this is more than half the number of kinesins found in humans  <cit> . however, giardia has no recognizable myosin  <cit> , suggesting that kinesins perform most of the transport functions. sixteen of the  <dig> kinesins in giardia were resolved into ten known families whereas the remaining eight were unresolved . if giardia is indeed part of the earliest derived extant lineage of the eukaryotes and therefore existed prior to the plant-animal split  <cit>  the ten families with representatives in giardia are inferred to represent the basic set of kinesin families in early eukaryotes. the families that are not represented in giardia are kinesin- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  hence, these families may have emerged later in eukaryotic evolution through gene duplication. four of the ungrouped kinesins in giardia did not group with kinesins from other species whereas the remaining four grouped either with leishmania or chlamydomonas kinesins . many of the domains found in flowering plants and animals are not present in giardia .

other kinesin families in plants
all flowering-plant kinesins from the kinesin- <dig> family form a well-supported clade as the sister group of a chylamydomonas sequence . two chlamydomonas kinesins in this family did not group with flowering plants, though this resolution was not supported in the parsimony analyses . a member of this family is involved in cell wall deposition  <cit> . kinesin- <dig> family motors function in cell division and spindle formation  <cit> . all flowering-plant kinesins of the kinesin-5/bimc family form a well-supported clade sister to the single chlamydomonas sequence . plant members of this family, like their animal counterparts, are likely to function in cell division  <cit> . members of the kinesin- <dig> family that function in cytokinesis in animals are not inferred to have undergone any gene duplications in plants . there is only one kinesin of this family in each of the flowering plant species analyzed here and none in the green or red algae. since cytokinesis in plants is quite different from animals  <cit> , it appears that members of other kinesins families perform this function. kinesin- <dig> members are found in plants, fungi and animals. oryza and arabidopsis have two kinesin- <dig> genes whereas populus has one . the non-plant members function in nuclear migration and mitochondrial transport. the function of plant members of this family remains unknown. plant kinesins associated with the kinesin- <dig> family were resolved as two separate clades from the main polytomy  indicating that two copies of kinesin- <dig> were present in flowering plants prior to the divergence of monocots from dicots.

the kinesin- <dig> family members function in organelle transport  <cit> . this family includes kinesins from both plants and animals. there are multiple members of this family in each flowering plant species. the flowering plant members formed two distinct clades, one as a sister group to chlamydomonas, with the red algae sequence as sister to both . based on this resolution, we infer at least one gene duplication after the divergence of red and green algae from one another yet prior to the divergence of green algae from flowering plants, three duplications in the flowering-plant lineage prior to the divergence of monocots from dicots, and two duplications within the dicot lineage. two plant members of this group localize to a plant-specific structure called the phragmoplast  <cit> . members of the kinesin- <dig> family, most of which have internal motors, transport vesicles and have mt depolymerizing activity  <cit> . plant members of this family also form a distinct clade with the chlamydomonas kinesin as a sister group . these internal-motor plant kinesins are distinct from the other internal-motor plant kinesins  in the kinesin- <dig> family.

domain analysis
domain analysis was performed on all eukaryotes used in this study as described in the methods section. the most prevalent domain is the coiled-coil region; almost every kinesin sequence analyzed has a coiled-coil prediction . among the kinesins analyzed here, about  <dig> known functional domains  are found. fig.  <dig> shows the list of functional domains and their presence in various species. a schematic diagram of kinesins depicting all the domains in the green alga, red alga and diatom are shown in fig.  <dig> whereas domain figures of populus and one species of oryza are shown in figs.  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. domains in arabidopsis kinesins were reported previously  <cit> . various known domains in non-plant systems are indicated in additional files  <dig> to  <dig>  interestingly, not a single domain is present in all kinesins. instead, most domains are restricted to a particular lineage  suggesting that most of these are gained later in evolution and have novel functions. this is also supported by the fact that in giardia most of these domains  are absent. some domains such as myosin tail homology domain  <dig>  and band  <dig>   are restricted to green algae and flowering plants . although myth <dig> and band  <dig>  domains are present in several animal proteins including some myosins, they are not found in non-plant kinesins. interestingly, in arabidopsis the myth <dig> and band  <dig>  are present in one kinesin and are not present in any other protein encoded in the genome  <cit> . we have previously shown that myth <dig> and talin-like regions are involved in binding to mts  <cit> , suggesting that it may be involved in cross-linking and/or bundling mts. it was recently shown that myth <dig> and band <dig>  in myosins also bind mts  <cit> , hence these domains are likely to function in cross-linking actin and mt cytoskeleton and/or transfer of cargo between two different cytoskeletal elements.

calponin homology  and kinesin-related  domains are found in flowering plants but not in green and red algae or heterotrophs . there are several kinesins with one ch domain and a kr domain in each flowering plant analyzed here . all ch domain kinesins belong to the kinesin- <dig> family and were resolved as the first clade in this family . the only other protein family that has the ch domain is fimbrin. plant fimbrins have four copies of the ch domain and bind f-actin. the ch domain is a protein module of about  <dig> residues found in cytoskeletal and signal transduction proteins either as a single copy or multiple copies in tandem. proteins with a tandem pair of ch domains cross-link f-actin, bundle actin or connect intermediate filaments to cytoskeleton  <cit> . proteins with a single copy are involved in signal transduction  <cit> . although plant kinesins have only one ch domain, recently it was shown that a kinesin with this domain interacts with f-actin, suggesting that the kinesins with this domain may be involved in interaction between actin and mt cytoskeleton  <cit> . the function of the kr domain is not known. however, the kinesins with this domain associate with the phragmoplast  <cit>  and belong to the kinesin- <dig> family . several flowering-plant kinesins and one non-plant  kinesin have armadillo/betacatenin-like  repeats that are known to mediate protein-protein interactions. diverse proteins contain arm repeats that form a superhelix of helices and function in intracellular signaling and cytoskeletal regulation. although none of the vertebrate and invertebrate kinesins have an arm, a kinesin- <dig> family-associated protein called kap <dig> in animals contains the arm repeat  <cit> 

animal kinesins have some domains that are not found in photosynthetic eukaryotes. these include fork-head associated , pleckstrin homology , cap-gly domains and wd- <dig> repeats. the fha domain is known to interact with phosphothreonine in proteins. cap-gly is a glycine-rich domain of about  <dig> amino acids that is found in cytoskeleton-associated proteins . the wd- <dig> repeats are also short  motifs that often terminate in trp-asp  dipeptide and facilitate the formation of multi-protein complexes. two of these domains  are present in several protozoans , suggesting that these domains may have been present in kinesins in the most recent common ancestor of all extant eukaryotes.

the only domain common to both plants and animals  is the helix-hairpin-helix  dna binding motif in the kinesin- <dig> family that functions in chromosome segregation . a member of this family has been shown to bind dna , which could be due to poor quality of the gene models.

genome duplication in flowering plants may have contributed to the expansions of kinesins in this group
whole genome duplications are believed to be a driving force for genome evolution in angiosperms since many modern diploids appear to be ancient polyploids  <cit> . in arabidopsis, the duplicated segments represent about 58% of the genome and several kinesins are present in the duplicated regions  <cit> . in oryza,  <dig> pairs of duplicated segments cover  <dig> % of the mapped super-scaffolds  <cit> . to visually represent the number of o. sativa ssp. japonica kinesins that fall within these segmental duplicated regions, an approximated chromosome map was generated according to the genomic map presented by guyot and keller,  <cit> . figure  <dig> depicts the distribution of kinesins across the  <dig> oryza chromosomes. roughly  <dig> of the  <dig> japonica kinesins are within duplicated segments. chromosome  <dig> has the most kinesin genes , whereas chromosome  <dig> has none. the remaining chromosomes contain one or more kinesin encoding genes. the duplicated region in the long arm of chromosome  <dig> contains three kinesins ; the corresponding duplicated block on chromosome  <dig> has only two , which could be suggestive of a gene loss event. the duplicated block on the short arm of chromosome  <dig> also may have experienced a gene loss event as it is bereft of any kinesins, whereas its counterpart on the long arm of chromosome  <dig> contains a single  kinesin.

intron/exon organization of kinesin genes
information on the presence of introns in kinesins of all species analyzed here is presented in tables  <dig> to  <dig> and additional files  <dig> to  <dig>  all kinesins in chlamydomonas and flowering plants have many introns whereas introns are absent in kinesin genes of red alga, giardia and leishmania. because of the large number of introns in kinesin genes of most species, the diversity of kinesin motors may increase by alternative splicing of kinesin pre-mrnas. although the extent of alternative splicing of kinesin pre-mrnas in plants is not known, there are examples in animals where alternative splicing of some kinesins results in generation of isoforms with different domains and with distinct functions  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
flowering plants have the largest number of kinesins among all species yet sequenced. gene duplication and functional diversification of specific families  appears to have contributed to the high number of kinesins in flowering plants. addition of novel domains to kinesins in lineage-specific groups contributed partly to the functional diversification of kinesins. the kinesin- <dig> family, which typically contains a c-terminal motor, has many plant kinesins that have the motor domain in the middle or at the n terminus as well as at the c terminus. the presence of most kinesin families of flowering plants in chlamydomonas indicates that these families were retained in both lineages. since plants have no or few dyneins, it appears that the kinesin family of mt motors has expanded in plants. despite the large number of kinesins in flowering plants, three or four of the  <dig> recognized families are absent. the vast expansion of some kinesin families in flowering plants suggests that they are likely to perform plant-specific functions. many kinesins in leishamania, giardia and chlamydomonas were not resolved with known kinesin families and may represent novel kinesin families and/or early-derived members of the  <dig> recognized kinesin families that are not resolved as such in our inferred gene tree. lineage-specific domain architecture in the plant and opisthokont lineages and absence of these domains in kinesins of other eukaryotes suggests acquisition of these domains more recently. the gene-tree analysis presented here is important for understanding kinesin evolution and should provide a framework to study cellular roles of kinesins. the challenge ahead is to elucidate the functions of individual kinesins and their regulation.
