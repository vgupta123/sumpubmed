BACKGROUND
c-ets <dig> was identified as a proto-oncogene based on v-ets in the genome of the avian leukemia retrovirus e <dig>  and is the founding member of the ets family of transcription factors  <cit> . elevated ets <dig> expression has been observed in many invasive and metastatic solid tumors  <cit>  and over-expression of ets <dig> is sufficient for transformation of nih3t <dig> fibroblasts  <cit> . in adults, expression of ets <dig> becomes restricted primarily to lymphoid tissues  <cit> , and mutation of ets <dig> in mice leads to defects in maturation of lymphocytes  <cit> . ets <dig> interacts with tlx to cause the critical maturation arrest in t cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia  <cit> . induction of ets <dig> in solid tumors triggers neovascularization and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition  that drives tumor invasion  <cit> . ras pathway signaling is critical for normal development, and constitutively activating ras mutations in tumors short-circuit the pathway leading to growth factor-independent cell proliferation, neovascularization and emt  <cit> . ets <dig> is phosphorylated and activated by erk phosphorylation when the ras pathway is engaged  <cit> , and this induction of ets <dig> is a mediator of ras-initiated emt. accordingly, a downstream target of ets <dig> is the emt transcription factor zeb <dig>  <cit> , which is required for maintaining epithelial vs. mesenchymal balance in vivo  <cit> . when induced in response to ras mutation, zeb <dig> causes transition to an invasive mesenchymal phenotype  <cit> . a key sensor of mutant ras is the rb <dig> family of cell cycle regulators, whose activation in response to ras mutation represses zeb <dig> and blocks emt  <cit> .

recent studies have found that ets is repressed by mir- <dig> family members  <cit> . mir- <dig> also represses zeb <dig>  but in a double negative loop zeb <dig> binds the promoters of mir- <dig> family members and represses their expression  <cit> . such findings raised the possibility that zeb <dig> might feedback to induce ets <dig> via its repression of mir- <dig>  and that rb <dig> might also influence ets <dig> expression via its regulation of zeb <dig>  here, we examined potential linkage between rb <dig>  ets <dig>  and zeb <dig>  although rb <dig> can interact with genes in a cell cycle-dependent fashion to regulate proliferation, it is also found constitutively at other genes including pro-apoptotic factors and mutation or inactivate of rb <dig> is required for induction of such genes  <cit> . we found here that rb <dig> is present constitutively at the ets <dig> promoter and removal of an rb1-e2f complex using a dominant negative-e2f led to induction of ets <dig>  thus, rb <dig> directly diminishes the level of ets <dig> expression. we also provide evidence that zeb <dig> induces ets <dig>  and we show that an additional and major effect of rb <dig> on ets <dig> expression is mediated through rb repression of zeb <dig>  we link the effect of zeb <dig> to its regulation of mir- <dig>  which in turn target ets <dig> 

taken together, our results provide evidence of an amplification loop consisting of ets <dig> and zeb <dig>  which is mediated by mir- <dig> and regulated by rb <dig>  we also show that zeb <dig> and ets <dig> are expressed together at the invasive edge of k-ras-initiated mouse lung adenocarcinomas, and there is a significant correlation between expression of ets <dig> and zeb <dig> in human lung adenocarcinoma. like ets <dig>  zeb <dig> is important for thymocyte differentiation, and zeb <dig> mice show a reduction in thymocytes  <cit> . importantly, we demonstrate that mutation of zeb <dig> eliminates ets <dig> expression in thymocytes, demonstrating dependence of ets <dig> expression on zeb <dig> in thymocytes, and thus potentially linking the zeb <dig> phenotype in t cell differentiation to a lack of ets <dig> expression.

methods
cells and cell culture
rb family triple knockout  mouse embryo fibroblasts and control wild-type fibroblasts have been described and were a kind gift from t. jacks and j. sage  <cit> . three independent tko and wild-type isolates were used with similar results. mouse zeb <dig> wild type and mutant fibroblasts were isolated from crosses of mice heterozygous for zeb <dig> and genotyped as described  <cit> . the human osteosarcoma u2os cells expressing iptg-inducible p16ink4a were described previously  <cit> , as were the u2os cells expressing both iptg-inducible p16ink4a and dn-e2f-mer  <cit> . u2os cells were cultured with 1 mm iptg in the medium for either one or three days to induce p16ink4a, or with  <dig> nm tamoxifen  for one day to induce mer-db-e2f expression. for combined treatments, cells were treated with iptg for one day, and then oht was added along with the iptg for an additional day. all the above fibroblast cells were cultured in dmem medium with 10% fetal bovine serum  and antibiotics at 10% co <dig> and 37°c.

zeb <dig> shrna construct and lentivirus preparation
we have described the lentiviral shrna knockdown of zeb <dig> protein and mrna in detail previously  <cit> .

immunohistochemistry
mouse embryos and adult lung tumor tissues were fixed with 10% formalin, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned at 5 μm. primary antibodies for zeb <dig> , cd <dig> , e-cadherin , ets <dig>  and the secondary antibodies are detailed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the slides were mounted with coverslips using anti-fade medium permount with dapi  and viewed under a zeiss fluorescent microscope.

k-rasla <dig> mice
housing and handling of all mice was in accordance with procedures approved by the university of louisville institutional animal care and use committee . k-rasla <dig> mice  <cit>  in a c57bl <dig> background were obtained from jackson laboratory. pcr genotyping was as described previously  <cit> .

human lung adenocarcinoma microarray analysis
no human tissue was utilized in this study. the processed microarray data were used from previously published work  that contains  <dig> samples of human lung adenocarcinomas sequenced for mutations in k-ras and egfr and patient matched control lung tissue  <cit> . the expression levels of zeb <dig> and est <dig> mrnas were selected for calculating pearson correlation score.

chromatin immunoprecipitation  assay
chip assays were based on the upstate protocol  using formaldehyde to crosslink genomic dna of wild-type mef cells. the chromatin was sheared to an average length of 300–500 bp. monoclonal antibodies for rb , e2f <dig> , e2f <dig> , and polyclonal antiserum for zeb <dig>  were used for immunoprecipitation. equal amounts of anti-igg or pre-immune serum were used as controls. the sequence of primers for ets <dig> promoter and the expected size of the pcr products are show in additional file 2: table s <dig>  chip pcr reactions were similar to those described below for real-time pcr, but with additional 1% bsa and 1% dmso, and the pcr programs usually had a higher annealing temperature  and longer extension time .

protein extraction and electrophoretic mobility shift assay 
the cultured adherent wild-type mef cells were scraped off and lysed in the lysis buffer  on ice for 20 minutes, followed by 10-minute centrifuge at  <dig>  g, the supernatant was thereafter collected as non-denatured protein extract immediately for the gel shift assay. based on the sequence alignment of both human and mouse ets <dig> promoters, an aligned 24-bp short sequence  with a putative e2f site  is selected for synthesis of the double-strand oligos with and without artificial mutation of the e2f site . twenty μg of the above crude protein lysate was mixed with  <dig> pmol of each of the double-strand oligos in a 10-μl protein-dna binding buffer , and incubated at rt for 40 minutes. the binding reactions without protein lysate or oligos were served as background controls. all the binding reaction samples were separated on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel in  <dig> × tbe buffer at constant 200 v and rt for 20 minutes. the finished gel was stained with  <dig> × diluted sybr green  in  <dig> × tbe buffer at rt for 20 minutes, and then visualized under uv light.

rna extraction and real-time pcr
total cellular rna was extracted using trizol solution . using primer <dig> , primer sets were designed to generate 150– <dig> base pair pcr products that bridge two separate exons. primer sequence, melting temperature , and pcr product sizes are listed in additional file 2: table s <dig>  first-strand complementary dna  synthesis was carried out in 20-μl reactions containing 1-2 μg of total rna, 500 ng random hexamers, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 500 μm dntp mix,  <dig> u rnaseout™ ribonuclease inhibitor, and  <dig> u m-mlv reverse transcriptase, at 37°c for 1 h according to the manufacturer’s protocol . real-time quantitative pcr was performed in 25-μl reaction volumes containing  <dig> -μl aliquots of cdna, gene-specific primer pairs, and sybr green i fluorescent dye , in an mx3000p real-time pcr system , according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the pcr cycle parameters were set at 95°c for 20 sec, 60°c for 30 sec, and 72°c for 30 sec, for a total of not more than 45 cycles. the fluorescent intensity of sybr green was monitored at the end of each extension step; relative amounts of the target cdna was estimated by the threshold cycle  number, and normalized to two internal control genes, β-actin  and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase . three independent samples were analyzed for each condition and/or cell type, and each sample was compared in at least  <dig> independent rt-pcr amplifications.

microrna detection
the quantitative rt-pcr to detect mirnas is as described  <cit> . briefly, polyadenylation of at least 5 μg of the total rna was completed by poly polymerase kit  in a 20 μl of reaction volume according to manufacturer’s instruction. the polyadenylated rna was thereafter directly utilized for cdna preparation using a reverse transcription kit  and an adaptor primer  12vn*-3′) in a 40 μl of reaction volume. real-time quantitative pcr was performed using a universal primer  and a mirna-specific primer  as described above.

RESULTS
the rb <dig> family represses ets <dig> expression
mutations in ras trigger activation of rb <dig> and tumor suppressing oncogene-induced senescence  <cit> . thus, mutation or inactivation of the rb <dig> pathway, which is a hallmark of cancers, is critical for ras-initiated tumor formation. ets <dig> is phosphorylated and activated by erk in response to ras signaling  <cit> , and in turn ets <dig> induces cyclin e and cdk <dig> to drive cell cycle progression  <cit> . therefore, we wondered if rb <dig> might repress ets <dig>  indeed, mutation of rb <dig> in primary cultures of mouse embryo fibroblasts  led to induction of ets <dig>  and ets <dig> was further induced when all three closely related rb <dig> family members  were mutated to generate triple knockout  mefs . these results suggest that ets <dig> is under repression by the rb <dig> family.figure  <dig> 
ets <dig> is under repression by the rb <dig> family. mutation of rb <dig> in primary cultures of mouse embryo fibroblasts  led to significant  induction of ets <dig> mrna, and ets <dig> mrna was further very significantly  induced when all three closely related rb <dig> family members  were mutated to generate triple knockout  mefs. real time pcr results normalized to actin mrna are shown.



e2f1-rb <dig> binds the ets <dig> promoter and constitutively repressed the gene
we used chromatin immunoprecipitation  assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay  to determine whether rb <dig> is bound to the ets <dig> promoter and whether removal of its putative binding site of e2f family, the rb <dig> dna binding partner, diminishes the binding. rb <dig> does not bind directly to dna, but it can be tethered to promoters through interaction with the e2f family of transcription factors  <cit> . some e2fs  contain a transactivation domain, while other e2fs lack a transactivation domain . binding to rb <dig> blocks the transactivation domain of e2fs, but rb <dig> also interacts with epigenetic modifiers to form an active repressor  <cit> . both human and mouse ets <dig> promoters have two major similar regions that each contains a perfectly aligned consensus e2f binding site . chip assays showed that rb <dig> and e2f <dig>  but not e2f <dig>  were bound to the ets <dig> promoter in vivo , while emsa demonstrated that mutation of the putative e2f site reduced the specific binding of the crude protein lysate to the target dna oligo in vitro , suggesting that rb1-e2f <dig> complex specifically binds to the putative e2f site of the ets <dig> promoter. next, we wondered if rb <dig> was acting at the ets <dig> promoter to block transactivation by e2f, or if rb <dig> was serving as an active repressor. previously we described a dominant negative  form of e2f consisting of the dna binding domain fused to a mutant estrogen receptor . following hydroxyl-tamoxifen  treatment, dn-e2f-mer is translocated to the nucleus where it displaces e2f and e2f-rb <dig> complexes from promoters. in the same cell, an iptg-inducible p <dig> gene is also included to assemble e2f-rb complexes at target genes following iptg treatment  <cit>  . if e2f were serving a transactivation function at the ets <dig> promoter, then dn-e2f-mer would cause repression, but if an e2f-rb <dig> complex were serving as a constitutive repressor, dn-e2f-mer would cause induction. we found that following tamoxifen treatment, dn-e2f-mer caused induction of ets <dig>  demonstrating that e2f1-rb <dig> at the promoter is constitutively repressing ets <dig> . rb <dig> activity is regulated in a cell cycle dependent fashion by cyclin dependent kinases  that hyperphosphorylate the protein blocking its interaction with e2f  <cit> . cdk inhibitors such as p <dig> block the activity of these cdks and cause accumulation of constitutively active rb <dig> which associates with e2f at the promoter of target genes  <cit> . many genes such as rrm <dig> are dependent upon phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of rb <dig> during the cell cycle and these genes are further repressed when rb <dig> is activated by expression of p <dig> , but other genes such as ntf <dig> that are constitutively repressed by rb1-e2f are not further repressed by activation of rb <dig> through expression of p <dig> . we previously described expression of p <dig> driven by an iptg-inducible promoter  <cit>  . as with ntf <dig>  we found that induction of p <dig> had no effect on repression of ets <dig> . taken together, these results suggest that e2f-rb <dig> is present constitutively at the ets <dig> promoter, where it reduces the level of ets <dig> expression in a cell cycle-independent fashion.figure  <dig>

zeb <dig> repression of the mir- <dig> family is linked to induction of ets1
zeb <dig> is a target of the mir- <dig> family, but in a negative loop zeb <dig> feeds back to repress transcription of mir- <dig> family members  <cit> . because mir- <dig> has been shown to target ets <dig>  <cit> , we wondered if zeb <dig> might also affect expression of ets <dig>  indeed, we found that mutation of zeb <dig> in mefs led to a gene dosage-dependent increase in expression of ets <dig> . we did not detect zeb <dig> at the ets <dig> promoter in chip assays  and induction of ets <dig> coincided with induction of mir- <dig> as zeb <dig> alleles were mutated , suggesting that it is induction of mir- <dig> when zeb <dig> is mutated that is causing induction of ets <dig>  it is of note that further down-regulation of zeb <dig> in zeb <dig> null mef cells had little effects on mir- <dig> expression , possibly due to  <cit>  the level of zeb <dig> protein in het mef cells is low enough to relieve the repression on mir- <dig> family, further decrease in zeb <dig> expression in null cells will not increase in mir- <dig> expression accordingly or/and  <cit>  it is also possible that zeb <dig> might down-regulate other unknown factor that positively regulates expression of mir- <dig> family at the same time and thereby makes the regulation network more complex. taken together, these results suggest an amplification loop between ets <dig> and zeb <dig>  where ets <dig> increases transcription of zeb <dig>  and zeb <dig> in turn represses mir- <dig> to further elevate ets <dig> figure  <dig> 
zeb <dig> induces ets <dig> expression, and it mediates much of the effect of rb <dig> on ets <dig> expression. 
zeb <dig> mutation leads to a gene dosage-dependent downregulation of ets <dig> expression. real time pcr is shown and results are normalizaed to β-actin mrna when the western blots show similar result accordingly. 
zeb <dig> mutation leads to a gene dosage-dependent induction of mir- <dig> family members. real time pcr is shown. 
rb <dig> family mutation leads to induction of mir- <dig> family members, and this induction is reversed by lentiviral knockdown of zeb <dig> .  zeb <dig> is induced along with ets <dig> as rb <dig> family members are mutated. and, knockdown of zeb <dig> reverses most of the induction of ets <dig>  real time pcr is shown.



rb <dig> family repression of zeb <dig> is a major component of inhibition of ets <dig> by rb1
even though an rb1-e2f complex binds to the ets <dig> promoter to reduce its expression, it is of note that rb <dig> also represses zeb <dig>  <cit> , leading us to ask whether rb <dig> repression of zeb <dig> was also contributing to the rb1-dependent downregulation of ets <dig>  as we demonstrated previously  <cit> , mutation of rb <dig> family members led to induction of zeb <dig> and this induction of zeb <dig> was accompanied by repression of mir- <dig>  and, as shown above, ets <dig> . knockdown of zeb <dig> in the tko mefs using shrna lenvirirus, as described previously  <cit> , eliminated much of the induction of ets <dig> , suggesting that induction of zeb <dig> and repression of mir- <dig> as rb <dig> family members are mutated is contributing significantly to the upregulation of ets <dig>  these results suggest that rb1-e2f binds the ets <dig> promoter to limit its level of expression, but it is induction of zeb <dig> and in turn repression of mir- <dig> when the rb <dig> family activity is lost that is responsible for most of the induction of ets <dig> 

ets <dig> and zeb <dig> are expressed at the invasive front of k-ras initiated mouse lung adenocarcinoma
ras pathway signaling causes erk-dependent activating phosphorylation of ets <dig>  <cit>  and the resulting induction of zeb <dig> is thought to be an important factor in ras-initiated emt   <cit> . induction of zeb <dig> leads to transition to a migratory mesenchymal phenotype and can been seen at the invading front of tumors  <cit> . we examine expression of ets <dig> and zeb <dig> in k-ras initiated mouse lung adenocarcinomas . activation of an oncogenic k-ras allele by recombination in somatic cells is sufficient for spontaneous lung cancer in k-rasla <dig> mice  <cit> . in this mouse model regions of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia  becomes evident in bronchial airways, and this hyperplasia expands to initiate formation of subpleural precancerous adenomas. foci of adenocarcinoma in situ begin to appear within these precancerous lesions as the first evidence of transition to malignancy, and these adenocarcinomas subsequently expand and invade into surrounding lung tissue where e-cadherin is expressed . in this model, rb <dig> is a major barrier to tumor initiation, and it is inactivated by cdk hyperphosphorylation in these tumors  <cit> . neither ets <dig> nor zeb <dig> were expressed in precancerous aah or adenomas, but both were expressed at the invasive edge of adenocarcinomas .figure  <dig>

correlation between ets <dig> and zeb <dig> in human lung adenocarcinomas
to check if ets <dig> also follows zeb <dig> expression in human lung adenocarcinomas, we examined microarrays of  <dig> human lung adenocarcinomas  <cit>  and compared expression of ets <dig> and zeb <dig> mrnas. we found a significant correlation between expression of ets <dig> and zeb <dig> mrna in these tumors . taken together, these data with mouse and human lung adenocarcinomas are consistent with the amplification loop we described above for ets <dig> and zeb <dig> figure  <dig> 
correlation between ets <dig> and zeb <dig> mrna expression in human lung adenocarcinomas. a pearson plot is shown. see methods for description of the microarray data base analysis.



mutation of zeb <dig> eliminates ets <dig> expression in differentiating thymocytes
although the correlation between ets <dig> and zeb <dig> in lung adenocarcinoma seen above is consistent with an amplification loop between ets <dig> and zeb <dig>  these results are also consistent simply with the previously documented induction of zeb <dig> by ets <dig>  <cit> . therefore, we next asked whether ets <dig> expression is dependent upon zeb <dig>  mutation of zeb <dig> and ets <dig> both lead to defects in thymocyte differentiation  <cit> . zeb <dig> mice show a decrease in the number of thymocytes , and we found that this zeb <dig> mutation eliminated ets <dig> expression in the thymocytes . these results demonstrate that ets <dig> expression in thymocytes is dependent upon zeb <dig>  and further confirm the linkage between the two transcription factors in the defects leading to thymocyte differentiation.figure  <dig>

discussion
mutation in the ras pathway leading to growth factor independent signaling is frequent in tumors  <cit> . one consequence of ras mutation is emt, and this appears to be mediated at least in part by erk phosphorylation and activation of ets <dig> and in turn ets <dig> induction of the emt transcription factor zeb <dig>  <cit> . the ras pathway is under surveillance by the rb <dig> tumor suppressor family, and mutation or inactivation of the rb <dig> family is a hallmark of cancer required for progression of tumors with a ras pathway mutation  <cit> . one consequence of rb <dig> activation in response to ras mutation is to suppress emt. our results suggest that e2f-rb <dig> binds constitutively to the ets <dig> promoter and limits the level of expression, but a second major impact of rb <dig> on ets <dig> expression is mediated through rb <dig> repression of zeb <dig>  <cit>  and in turn induction of mir- <dig>  which targets ets <dig>  we propose that ets <dig> and zeb <dig> form an amplification loop that is dependent upon zeb <dig> repression of mir- <dig> and regulated by the rb <dig> family . we present evidence correlating expression of ets <dig> and zeb <dig> in invasive lung adenocarcinoma, suggesting that this amplification loop is evident in invasive lung cancer. importantly, we demonstrate that zeb <dig> is required for ets <dig> expression in differentiating thymocytes providing evidence that zeb <dig> is critical for ets <dig> expression in vivo in the thymus. beyond regulating expression of zeb <dig> and emt, ets <dig> also induces expression of cyclin e and cdk <dig> to drive cell cycle progression  <cit> . rb <dig> pathway mutation or inactivation is closely linked to unrestricted cell proliferation  <cit> , and our results suggest that one component of this unrestricted cell cycle progression might be upregulation of zeb <dig> and in turn ets <dig> when the rb <dig> pathway is lost. interestingly, two separate transcriptional functions have been ascribed to zeb <dig>  zeb <dig> binds to dna through a series of zinc finger domains, and a c-terminal domain binds to the co-repressor ctbp to repress transcription  <cit> . the n-terminal domain of zeb <dig> binds smads and the transcriptional co-activator p <dig>  and zeb <dig> acts as a scaffold for assembly of an active smad-p <dig> complex at promoters of tgf and bmp-responsive genes  <cit> . two different mutations of zeb <dig> have been examined—a gene knockout and a mutation that deletes the n-terminal smad-p <dig> binding domain  <cit> . knockout of zeb <dig> leads to lethality at the end of gestation, with cleft palate, skeletal defects, disrupted epithelial vs. mesenchymal balance and diminished thymocyte differentiation  <cit> . interestingly, deletion of the n- terminal domain of zeb <dig> eliminates cleft palate and other skeletal defects, but the thymocyte differentiation defect persists  <cit> . these results imply that ctbp-dependent transcription repression of mir- <dig> family members by zeb <dig> is important for regulation of ets <dig> and for thymocyte differentiation.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
our results provide evidence of an rb1-dependent ets1-zeb <dig> amplification loop that is important in both cancer and in normal development of the thymus.
