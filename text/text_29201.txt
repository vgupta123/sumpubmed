BACKGROUND
protein-protein interactions have been well studied by both lab experiments and computational simulations  <cit> . understanding protein interactions is crucial for designing drugs and finding drug targets. while knowledge of protein interactions and their molecular pathways have been discovered experimentally, limited information about structures of the known protein complexes could be elucidated. in addition, due to the transient or obligatory associations, not every protein complex could be experimentally crystalized. therefore predicting the complex formation using in silico method, e.g. protein-protein docking, has become an important complement with the in vitro studies in investigating protein-protein interactions.

due to the compromise of protein flexibility against limited computational resources, most current protein docking algorithms are driven under the assumption of rigid docking, i.e. one of the protein partners remains rigid during the complex associations  <cit> . hence, results of the rigid docking often require further refinement to obtain optimal structures of the protein complexes. however, this refinement stage is computationally intensive  <cit> .

although the rigid docking has successfully predicted formations of many protein complexes, it often fails if the proteins undergo conformational changes  or their interactions are influenced by the solvent  <cit> . in fact, rigid docking results contain high false positive rates caused by a failure to locate the correct predictions from the other incorrect ones. therefore, if the refinement is a crucial step that every protein docking algorithm needs to perform, it is important to improve the number of correct predictions while limiting the number of false positives that need to be refined in order to achieve better computational efficiency.

re-ranking technique used in protein docking is an effective approach to discriminating the correct predictions from the others  <cit>  by re-locating them in the top higher ranks than those of the incorrect and false positives. for examples, the re-ranking algorithm zrank  <cit>  aims for a more accurate and quick re-ranking of the rigid docking predictions from zdock . unlike zdock <dig> , the scoring function of which consists of grid-based discrete functions derived from both the receptor and the ligand  <cit> , the scoring function developed in zrank includes a linear sum of the potential terms  and does not require the grid-based presentations before the scoring  <cit> . zrank therefore does not significantly affect the overall complexity of the initial docking algorithm, marking it an important improvement in terms of computational efficiency because it can compute quickly and effectively the scores of each of the predicted protein complexes while there is no fast fourier transform  technique required. in particular, zrank achieves noticeable improvement by improving the rankings of the top  <dig> conformations for most of the cases in the protein complex benchmark  <dig>   <cit>  and benchmark  <dig>  over the initial docking programs zdock  .

another re-ranking technique using an implicit solvent model  implemented in a rigid docking program f2dock also shows better performances by locating more correct predictions in higher ranks  <cit>  than the conventional initial rigid docking. f2dock applies a gb model to estimate the changes in the solvation energy  at the protein surfaces of protein complexes, and uses this Δesol value to re-rank the docking predictions  <cit> . the f2dock gb re-rank showed better results for two out of  <dig> types of protein complexes  than those of the initial rigid docking zdock <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . the estimation of the Δesol in the gb model is dependent on the polarization energy, which represents the electrostatics changes due to the solvent. however this estimation neglects the conformational changes upon the complex formation  <cit> . therefore biases may be expected due to the rigidity of the protein backbones and side-chains.

although each of the techniques approaches from different angles of employing potential energy terms, they both interpret the solvent effect using the energy-based scoring functions and show significant improvement as compared to the initial docking algorithm zdock <dig> . <dig>  it is observed that the inclusion of water effect into the protein interactions is taken into account  <cit> . however, the water is yet presented implicitly. this is not always true for all the protein complexes, especially for antigen/antibody complexes.

water molecules are often found in protein-protein interfaces. despite quick exchanges between interfacial water and the bulk solvent, some water-mediated interactions contribute directly to the stability of protein formation and specificity of protein recognitions  <cit> . for examples, antigen/antibody interfaces are prone to less hydrophobic while the enzyme/inhibitor interfaces are more hydrophobic. however, studies have shown that both types of complexes contain either wet or dry interfaces  <cit>  and that wet interfaces with water-filled cavities maintain the close pack of the structures and facilitate the protein interactions via water-mediated hydrogen bonds or indirect interactions  <cit> . although water plays an important role in protein interactions, inclusion of the water in current protein docking and re-ranking algorithms is only implicit due to the limited computational resources. in other words, the water molecules are not actually presented in the protein-protein interactions in those computational models.

hence in this work, combining two objectives of simultaneously improving the ranks of the correct predictions and explicitly presenting the water influence on the protein interactions, we proposed a new re-ranking algorithm via an energy-based scoring function, namely ifacewat. the ifacewat was implemented based on the interface atomic contact energy  of the initial rigid docking algorithm zdock <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  and on derived energies of water-involved interactions at the protein interfaces. it was expected that when accounting exclusively for the water-mediated interactions and taking advantages of shape complementarity, we could elicit some extent of protein flexibility at the protein interfaces, especially for the antigen/antibody complexes, which could not or be limitedly achieved by some current initial rigid docking algorithms.

RESULTS
the proposed re-ranking algorithm is a combination of various potentials and energy terms, especially employing the interface atomic contact energy  of the initial docking algorithm zdock <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  to evaluate both the protein recognitions and water mediated effect at the protein interfaces . the algorithm, namely ifacewat, was used to estimate the number of near native structures  and re-rank those hits, which were among the predicted complexes generated by the initial rigid docking algorithm zdock <dig> . <dig> . the re-ranking process was performed for each complex in the dataset of  <dig> cases of antigen/antibody, enzyme/inhibitor, and other types, and then followed by comparisons with the ranking results of the initial rigid docking algorithm zdock and those of two other current re-ranking techniques zrank  <cit>  and f2dock  <cit> .

the ifacewat improves significantly the rank of the near native structures as compared to the initial rigid docking, especially for antigen/antibody complexes
a dataset extracted from the latest protein-protein benchmark  <dig>   <cit>  is used in this work. it includes non-redundant structures of protein-protein complexes of enzyme/inhibitor , antibody/antigen , and other types  . results of the initial dockings by zdock showed that  <dig> out of  <dig> cases of this dataset, including  <dig> antigen/antibody,  <dig> enzyme/inhibitor, and  <dig> other complexes, obtained at least one near native structure among  <dig> predictions. in our results, a near native structure called a "hit" was defined as the complex structure, the ligand orientation of which obtained a root mean square deviation  less than  <dig> Å. the value of rms ≤  <dig> Å is commonly used to indicate how deviating the predicted ligand orientation is as compared to the original ligand orientation in the corresponding crystalized structure. for this comparison, we used "success rate" to evaluate the performances .

the success rate reflects how well the technique can rank the correct predictions in the top ranks, and therefore it shows how effective the technique can discriminate the correct structures from the incorrect and false positive ones. it is important to achieve the higher ranks for the correct predictions because those top ranked predictions would then undergo further refinement using more intensive computing, e.g. molecular dynamics simulation.

 success rate=# cases that obtain at least 1 hit in the top 100 predictions# total cases of the particular complex type 

comparisons of the success rate between zdock and the ifacewat indicated that the ifacewat improved the ranks for most of the complexes classified either by physicochemical properties  or by capri-defined difficulty level   <cit> . except for the difficult cases, in which both the methods achieved a tight percentage of 90% , the ifacewat showed better ranking outcomes, and was therefore expected to discriminate better the correct from the false positive predictions.

in addition, it was demonstrated in figure  <dig>  that the ifacewat outperformed zdock for a/ab complexes . the improvement was due to including interfacial water effect and the flexibility of the interfaces, which are the two important characteristics of the antigen/antibody interactions . for examples, in the two antigen/antibody cases of   and   the ifacewat improved significantly both the number of hits and ranks of the hits . for both these two cases, while there was only one hit that could be generated, the ifacewat could detect it and ranked it in the top  <dig>  but zdock could find none. furthermore, for several difficult complex cases, while both the methods could find the same numbers of hits, the ifacewat ranked the first hit in the better ranks . noticeably, the ifacewat found  <dig> hits more for the difficult case of  .

it was also observed that the ifacewat could detect more near native structures than zdock . especially for the type ab , while zdock was able to locate only one hit of  <dig> complex , the ifacewat found  <dig> hits for  <dig> cases  out of  <dig> cases and ranked the first hit as rank  <dig> for all these  <dig> cases.

compared to zrank, the ifacewat performed equivalently well for both the antigen/antibody  and enzyme/inhibitor complexes , yet slightly better for some medium and difficult cases .

to demonstrate further the performance comparisons among the three methods, we used the complex conformations that obtained the best rms for the top  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> predictions . it was indicated that, for either types of complex classification , the ifacewat outperformed zdock in locating the best rms conformations . for the top  <dig> ranks, the two methods were equivalent although the ifacewat had shown better performance particularly for complex type ab . when the number of predictions increased to  <dig>  the trend was clearer for all the types, especially for medium and difficult cases .

as comparing with zrank, the trend was also more pronounced when the number of predictions increased, especially for the medium and difficult cases . however, both the methods performed equivalently well in locating the best rms conformations for antigen/antibody cases, yet sometimes zrank was found with slightly better performance .

comparisons of the ifacewat and f2dock
while the ifacewat was being developed, there was another re-ranking method independently developed and published in march  <dig> and included in the f2dock package  <cit> . the f2dock applies generalized born model to estimate the changes in solvation energy of the protein interfaces, and also considers separately the characteristics of protein complexes.

there are different implementations between the ifacewat and f2dock in ways of defining the near-native structures and re-ranking them  <cit> . for examples, while f2dock defines the "hit" based on rms of the interface-involved residues , the "hit" in the ifacewat is defined with the rms of the whole ligand orientation against ligand position in the crystalized structures . therefore, to obtain a fair comparison, we evaluated the relatively significant improvement of the success rate  achieved by each of the methods as compared to the initial docking program zdock .

it was observed in figure  <dig> that different implementations of the role of water in the scoring function might result in different performances between the two techniques. in particular, the ifacewat performed better for some antigen/antibody cases  and also for some medium and difficult cases . both the methods account for the water effect, but while the f2dock approximates the changes of solvation energy only  <cit> , the ifacewat includes the free energy change of the complex interfaces by applying solvated rotamers, subsequently accounting for the side chain and backbone flexibility of the proteins; especially for some of difficult cases that required induced conformational fit during the protein associations.

the f2dock on the other hand performed better than the ifacewat in some enzyme/inhibitor cases . this might be the result of considering the energy to form the cavities that were frequently observed in the enzyme and inhibitor interactions.

unlike f2dock, a strict constraint of hit numbers is set in the ifacewat implementation to ensure that the first hit needed to acquire the rank as high as possible. in fact, the ifacewat estimates the numbers of hits that are considered only among the numbers of near-native structures in the ground truth. for example, for the case of  , there was only  <dig> hit generated according to the ground truth . the constraint was set to the case that only the conformation ranked at the top- <dig>  would be considered as a hit by the ifacewat. and this hit was the first and the only hit according to the method. other conformations out of this window length of ranking  would not be considered as hits found by the ifacewat although their conformations obtained rms ≤  <dig> Å. on the other hand, f2dock considered any conformations with interface-rms ≤ 5Å as hits found  <cit> .

as a result, some first hits found by f2dock obtained low ranks, e.g. for the case of  , the first hit was ranked at rank  <dig> by f2dock, but ranked at rank  <dig> by the ifacewat. however, for the  case above f2dock did not obtain any hit .

the ifacewat presented the water-mediated hydrogen bond network in the complex interfaces
in this work, the solvent effect is explicitly presented in the complex interfaces during the re-ranking. complement with the interface atomic contact energy  of the initial docking zdock, the water contribution via the energies of protein-water dispersion and water-mediated hydrogen bonds fulfills the overall picture of water-facilitating interactions between the protein partners, particularly in the antigen/antibody complexes.

especially, the ifacewat is strictly constrained in defining the hit to locate the near native structures of protein complexes in as high ranks as possible . together with the inclusion of the interfacial water, the ifacewat improves not only the number of hits found but also the ranks of the first hit, which represents the best complex predicted and the nearest to the corresponding original protein complex . among the protein cases that were improved in ranking the first hit as compared to the initial docking zdock, structural observations of their complex interfaces revealed the presence of the hydrogen bond network, which was mediated by the interfacial water . for the antigen/antibody case of , while the initial docking could not locate any hit, the ifacewat found the best hit  and ranked it as the top- <dig>  the interface of this protein complex contained  <dig> water molecules, two of which contributed to the hydrogen bond network that bridged the protein interactions between the interfacial residues. similarly, in the cases of   and  , it was observed that the interfacial water molecules also formed the mediated hydrogen bonds that connected the protein chains .

the ifacewat improved the rank of the first hit for either with- or without water-containing structures
our results of the re-ranking show that the ifacewat also improves the number of near native structures and their ranks for several protein complexes that do not contain interfacial water . in fact, the re-ranking effectiveness of the ifacewat maintains for such cases because it takes into account the free energy change of the protein complex interfaces .

"-" represents "not applicable" for the corresponding cases. for examples, in the first case , it is found that ifacewat improves the number of hits , but does not improve the rank of the first hit . also noted in this table that ∆ginterface value is only shown for the first hit of the case, in which the rank of the first hit is improved by the ifacewat.

in addition to highlighting the contributions of water in the interfaces, the ifacewat accounts for the interactions occurring at the complex interfaces by including the free energy change as the last potential term . re-ranking observations of some complex structures that do not contain water indicated that the contribution of the free energy change Δginterface helps improve significantly the rank of the first hit.

among the components that were integrated in this Δginterface term, the energies of side chain- and backbone-involved hydrogen bonds contributed noticeable portions in the overall value of the Δginterface and helped determine the influence of side chain flexibility in the interfaces. except for the complex   in table  <dig> the interactions occurring at the interfaces of the other non-water protein complexes were induced by significant conformational changes  <cit> . therefore, it was expected that taking into account these energy contributions would help distinguish the good-binding complexes from the others. for examples, in the two cases obtaining the first hit at top- <dig> rank, i.e.  and , the free energies Δginterface were - <dig>  kcal/mol and - <dig>  kcal/mol, respectively. their break-down of the hydrogen bond-involving energies of - <dig>  kcal/mol and - <dig>  kcal/mol, respectively, indicated the sufficient contributions of the hydrogen bonds in the protein interactions. however, those energies were ignored by the initial docking algorithm zdock.

similarly, for some water-containing complex cases, the first hit of which was ranked top- <dig> by the ifacewat, the free energies of the complex interfaces also obtained significantly low values . particularly, in  <dig> cases of antigen/antibody complexes, i.e.   and  , the ifacewat located the first hit at rank  <dig> while zdock could not find any hit. therefore, it was suggested that including the consideration of the flexibility of protein side chains during the protein associations improved the discrimination of good binding complexes from the others, thereby improving the rank of the first hit or the best near native structure of the protein complexes.

free energy change  plays the most important role in the ifacewat scoring function
the ifacewat scoring function includes various potential terms of the complex-binding score and the protein interactions at the interfaces . the contributions of these terms are evaluated given a set of weights , each of which reflects an independent influence of each potential onto the overall f score . as discussed more in detail in this section, the free energy change  contributes the most among the four potential terms, especially in antigen/antibody complexes . the free energy change  is used to evaluate the interactions occurring at the complex interfaces, therefore determining the more favorable bound complex conformations .

to evaluate the contribution of each potential term, "leave-one-parameter-out" experiments were performed. in those experiments, each potential contribution i was alternately disabled, i.e. wi =  <dig> , while the others were used to calculate the total f score and estimate the number of the found near native structures . resulting observations show that the contribution of the free energy change  plays the most important role among the potential terms. when w <dig> =  <dig>  the protein-protein interactions that occurred at the interfaces were mostly ignored and the side chain flexibility was limited , consequently leading to the noticeable drop of the total number of hits found , especially for the antigen/antibody complexes . differences of antibody conformations between the two types  might explain the decrease of the number of hits. for the antigen/bound-antibody structures , interactions of the antibody and its possible substrate might have re-oriented the conformation of the antibody itself, substantially leading to conformational changes before it interacts with the antigen. the significant drop of the number of hits in type a implied that the free energy change Δginterface provided significant influence to determine the number of near native structures for the antigen/unbound-antibody complexes.

further, results of both the experiments  with w <dig> =  <dig> showed the significant decrease of the number of hits of the types a and ab. results of the enzyme/inhibitor complexes also indicated the similar decreasing trend, especially when both the first potential term  and the free energy change  were disabled in experiment # <dig>  the results of which significantly became worse. in the experiment # <dig>  numbers of hits obtained for each complex type were  <dig> % , ~50% , ~30% , and  <dig> %  as compared to the results of experiment # <dig>  similarly, results of the experiment # <dig> reinforced the important role of the free energy change  in the ifacewat scoring function, particularly for the antigen/antibody complexes. decrease of the number of hits therefore implies the increases of the false positives when the unfavorable complex conformations are not detected.

it was observed in table  <dig> that restriction of the combinations of shape complementarity, electrostatics and desolvation also contributed significantly to the decrease of the number of hits for the type a complexes. when w <dig> =  <dig> in the experiment # <dig>  except for type a , most of the complexes obtained only around >70%  of the number of near native structures as compared to the experiment # <dig> results. comparisons of the two experiments # <dig>  and # <dig>  again revealed the different influences of both shape complementarity and free energy change on protein complexes of different physicochemical properties. although the shape complementarity surprisingly affected much on the complexes type a  as shown in experiment # <dig>  ignoring the contribution of the free energy change  resulted in more decrease of hits . a similar decreasing trend was observed in type ab in experiments # <dig> and # <dig> as well as in the experiments # <dig> and # <dig>  on the other hand, the shape complementarity showed more predominant role in determining the number of hits in the enzyme/inhibitor  complexes.

it was also observed in the antigen/antibody complexes that the effect of water molecules was clearer on the complexes of type ab than on the complexes of type a. as discussed above, interactions of the antigen with the bound-conformation of the antibody might result in more spacious interfaces where the space could be occupied by the water molecules, thereby increasing the effect of water onto the protein interactions at the complex interfaces of type ab. hence, when w <dig> =  <dig> , especially if there existed water molecules at the complex interfaces, this might cause the decreases in the number of hits in type ab, but not in type a.

optimal weights w <dig>  w <dig>  w <dig>  w <dig> of the proposed scoring function
we performed various experiments to investigate the dependency of different potential terms on physicochemical properties of the protein complexes . it was indicated that interactions between the enzymes and the inhibitors were driven mostly by hydrophilic and planar residues and that methods based on the atomic contact energy did not likely work well in predicting interactions of antigen/antibody complexes. because the dataset used in this work contained different types of protein complexes, i.e. antigen/antibody , antigen/bound-antibody , enzyme/inhibitor , and others , it was expected that contributions of the four potential terms in the equation  <dig>  would be diverse. therefore, we estimated the weights w <dig>  w <dig>  w <dig>  and w <dig> of the proposed scoring function  differently according to the different complex types.

after a number of iterations  to estimate the weights using monte carlo method, the sets of weights  obtained for each complex type are  for type a,  for type ab,  for type e and  for type o.

among the four weights evaluating the interactions of the protein complexes, w <dig> is set negative to maintain the positive f scores . the free energy change Δginterface represents the interactions of the protein partners at the interfaces. it is considered as a complementary potential terms to either  the scoreiface, which favors the shape complementarity of the two molecules, or  the complex flexibility due to the trade-off of the rigid docking. the more negative Δginterface will favor the more stable interactions  and also reflects the difficulty level that drives the two molecules to interact with each other, e.g. w <dig> = - <dig>  for type a/ab as compared to w <dig> = - <dig>  for type e/o.

in fact, different sets of weights implicitly reflect different physicochemical properties between the antigen/antibody and enzyme/inhibitor complexes. in addition to the noticeable difference of w <dig> between the two types, the weight of the first term w <dig> also indicates the susceptibility to shape complementarity of type e/o  over the other type a/ab . the enzyme-inhibitor interactions are characterized as geometrical matching or shape complement whereas the antigen and antibody interactions are known as "induced fit" and require conformational changes during the associations. these properties however could not be totally interpreted using rigid docking although some "soft" docking techniques were applied .

while there are no significant differences of weight values between type e and o , noticeable difference of weights is observed between type a and ab cases of antigen/antibody complexes. especially, the lennard-jones repulsive energy contributes more dominantly in type ab  than in type a . structural observations reveal that steric constraints of the antibody conformations between the unbound  and bound  might lead to the difference. interactions of the antigen with the antibody bound-conformation  might have formed more spacious interfaces where there is room for the presence of water. in fact for the ab structures, interactions of the antibody and its substrate might re-orient the overall conformational packing and therefore expose more hydrophilic regions on its surface; consequently forming hydrophilic cavities when interacting with the antigen. increase of the hydrophilicity in those cavities might facilitate occupation of one or more water molecules, substantially increasing the water effect onto the interfacial free energy change of these ab complexes.

the ifacewat maintained sufficiently the computational efficiency yet improved ranking of the first hit
the ifacewat scoring function was developed as a re-ranking technique using explicit interfacial water to further discriminate the correct predictions from the other incorrect and false positive ones of an initial docking algorithm, particularly in improving the results of predicting complex formations for antibody/antigen complexes.

the nature of the rigid initial docking is to keep the receptor rigid and allows limited flexibility of the ligand in order to achieve computational efficiency due to the large sizes of both the molecules. however, at the same time, it limits the ability of finding the correct bindings of the protein complexes as well as increases the probability of generating the false positive ones. this leads to a need of structural refinement to optimize the conformations of the protein complexes and further eliminate the decoys. nonetheless, such a process, e.g. using energy-based evaluation by md simulation, for the refinement purposes requires intensive computation, especially for the antibody/antigen complexes. therefore, for this work the ifacewat is expected to reduce as many as possible false positives that need not to be refined before heading to the refinement steps, but still maintain the computational efficiency.

results of re-ranking time  by the ifacewat  indicate that the ifacewat is able to maintain sufficient timing  to re-rank  <dig> conformations of each protein complex. among the complexes, two antigen/antibody complexes, i.e.  and  took the longest re-ranking time using the ifacewat. while the ifacewat ranked their first hits as the top- <dig>  the initial docking zdock could not locate any hits.

let tdi be the md simulation time for each conformation that would undergo the structural refinement and assume that each of them would take an equivalent time. in the cases of  and , there would be 2000*tdi computational time needed for the md simulation to find the near native complex structure. however, after being re-ranked by the ifacewat, only 1*tdi simulation time would be needed to obtain at least one near native structure of the protein complex because this conformation was found at the top- <dig>  similarly for other complexes, which obtained the higher rank for the first hit, the speed of md simulation would be significantly improved if the structures underwent the refinement stage .

CONCLUSIONS
the re-ranking algorithm ifacewat improves the initial rigid docking results by increasing not only the number of near-native structures found but also the ranks of the correct predictions. in fact, most of the near-native structures are ranked at the top- <dig> 

the ifacewat achieved a success rate of  <dig> % for antigen/antibody complexes, which was 10% better than zdock <dig> . <dig>  as compared to another re-ranking technique zrank, the ifacewat obtained success rates of  <dig> %  and 90%  respectively for medium and difficult cases. when comparing with the current re-ranking method in f2dock, which employs a generalized born  model in its energy-based function, it was shown that the ifacewat performed equivalently with or even better than the gb-rerank f2dock, especially for the antigen/antibody complexes. our results showed that the improvement of those cases was facilitated by taking into account some extent of protein side chain flexibility when the proteins interacted, especially for those of difficult cases that required induced conformational fit during the protein associations.

although the ifacewat achieved a high success rate of  <dig> % for antigen/antibody complex, 60% for enzyme/inhibitor, and more than 90% for medium and difficult cases, the method was restricted to improve particularly the result of the rigid docking algorithm zdock <dig> . <dig> and especially for the antigen/antibody complexes. in the near future, we will be further developing the algorithm to apply for other shape complementary-based docking algorithms to achieve better robustness.
