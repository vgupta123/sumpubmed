BACKGROUND
the global use of energy crops as renewable fuels and alternative sources of farm income is of great importance to current ecological and economic issues. switchgrass , a warm-season perennial native to the prairies of north america, has been identified by the u.s. department of energy  for development into an herbaceous biomass fuel crop  <cit> . switchgrass ranges from quebec to central america and, like maize, is a c <dig> species, fixing carbon by multiple metabolic pathways with high water use efficiency  <cit> . currently, there are breeding programs focusing on high yield, high cellulose content, and low ash characteristics  <cit> . primarily used for summer forage, hay, and conservation plantings  <cit> , switchgrass is an ideal biomass energy source because of its moderate to high productivity, stand longevity, high moisture and nutrient use efficiency, excellent pest and disease resistance, low cost of production, compatibility with current harvesting and haying equipment, soil restoring properties, erosion control, and adaptability to marginal soils in most agricultural regions in north america.

given the inherent advantages of utilizing switchgrass as a biofuel feedstock, genetic improvement of switchgrass for more cost-effective biofuel conversion is a possibility that should be pursued. feedstock traits that can be improved through breeding and biotechnology approaches include enhanced biomass yield, modified lignin production to make sugars in switchgrass more accessible, improved plant biotic and abiotic tolerance, and a long list of new potential uses for primary or co-products. all of these trait enhancements call for genomic tools development. establishment of integrated physical and genetic maps for switchgrass will make it possible to map value added traits useful to breeding programs and to isolate important target genes using map based cloning.

improved genetics and agronomics will certainly further enhance energy sustainability and increase biofuel yields from switchgrass. however, realizing the full genetic potential of this species is currently hampered by our lack of knowledge about its evolutionary history, closest relatives, and multiple polyploidy states. in spite of the economic and agricultural importance of switchgrass, few genomic resources exist. there are currently no reports of trait mapping in switchgrass  <cit> , and est and genomic microsatellite markers are just beginning to be developed  <cit> . the first publicly available switchgrass genetic map possesses only  <dig> rflp markers distributed over eight homology groups  <cit> . a more recent work employing est-ssr, genomic ssr and est-sts markers led to the construction of genetic maps of two lowland switchgrass genotypes. each map coalesced into  <dig> linkage groups arranged into nine homoeologous pairs  <cit> . advances in sequencing and genotyping technology that have been made in the last decade will allow leapfrogging into the latest technology that should enable the application of marker assisted selection techniques such as whole genome selection. these modern breeding methods could dramatically reduce time and cost of cultivar development by reducing the amount of phenotypic analysis that is required especially in early cycles of selection. availability of an accurate genome sequence will facilitate this vision.

it has been observed that switchgrass cultivars can have different numbers of chromosomes  <cit> . the reported polyploidy series in switchgrass ranges from diploid  to duodecaploid   <cit> . to date, all lowland ecotypes examined are tetraploids , while upland ecotypes are tetraploids, hexaploids, or octaploids  <cit> . in  <dig>  dna content  for several tetraploid plants from lowland cultivars was measured and found to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg per nucleus in average  <cit> , so the effective genome size is ~ <dig> mb for alamo derived genotypes. to date, genomic sequencing efforts on other large, repeat-rich, plant genomes such as wheat , barley , maize , and sorghum  have been hindered by genomic complexity resulting in sequence assembly problems  <cit> . this is even more pronounced in outcrossing plants such as poplar   <cit> . a recent report indicated that sequencing the switchgrass genome to an 8× coverage using  <dig> ×  <dig> bp of mate pair information with  <dig> sequencing technology would cost ~$ <dig> million usd  <cit> . it has also been suggested that with this depth and type of sequencing in hand, retrotransposon families and highly repetitive regions would not be resolved well  <cit> . it has been suggested that a high quality physical map with enough resolution of homoeologous genomes would ensure assembly and sequencing of a minimum tiling path of large-insert clones, and the physical map would also make it possible to determine haplotypes over extensive regions  <cit> .

here, we present the first switchgrass bac library with a glimpse into switchgrass genome structure and complexity as revealed by comparative sequence analysis of two homoeologous bac assemblies derived from a genomic region that harbors orthologs of the rice osbri <dig> locus, a low-copy gene that encodes a putative protein kinase with a high similarity to bri <dig>  a brassinosteroid  receptor in arabidopsis, which has been shown to be associated with plant biomass in rice  <cit> . our data support a trend toward autopolyploidy and demonstrate the feasibility of using hicf fingerprinting to resolve the homoeologous chromosomes of the two distinct genomes in switchgrass, providing a robust and accurate bac-based physical platform for this polyploidy species. these genomic resources and sequence data will lay the foundation for deciphering the switchgrass genome and lead the way for an accurate genome sequencing strategy.

RESULTS
switchgrass bac library construction and characterization
a bac library of p. virgatum was constructed by partial digestion of nuclear dna with ecori and contains  <dig>  clones stored in  <dig> plates . the library covers the effective switchgrass genome approximately  <dig> times based on a genome size of  <dig>  gigabases, and is publicly available via the clemson university genomics institute . to estimate insert size and distribution of the switchgrass bac library,  <dig> bacs were selected at random and analyzed by noti digestion and pfge . clones that appear to be partially digested were not used in insert size calculation. the results indicated that 95% of the clones contained inserts, and the insert size ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> kb with an average of  <dig> kb .

identification and assembly of bacs containing switchgrass orthologs of the rice osbri <dig> gene
the genotype of the p. virgatum we used for bac library construction is tetraploid. to verify whether or not switchgrass is an autopolyploid, and to examine how well the homoeologous bacs can be distinguished and correctly assembled, we set to study individual genes and their surroundings at the genome level by analyzing related bac clones in the constructed library. to this end, we screened the bac library with a rice brassinosteroid insensitive  <dig>  homolog  <cit> , osbri <dig>  bri <dig> in arabidopsis and osbri <dig> in rice encode ubiquitously expressed putative receptor kinases. they are both single copy genes and involved in various aspects of plant growth and development. disruption of bri <dig> and osbri <dig> both led to plant dwarfism, greatly impacting plant biomass production  <cit> .

we screened  <dig>  bac clones with the single-copy rice gene, osbri <dig> that resulted in  <dig> positive clones,  <dig> of which showed strong signal intensity and  <dig> showed moderate to weak signal strength. to further confirm that the  <dig> clones showing strong hybridization signals with osbri <dig> probe contain switchgrass orthologs of osbri <dig> gene, two pairs of pcr primers were designed based on sequence of the conserved region of the rice osbri <dig> gene. pcr analysis of the switchgrass osbri <dig> homolog using dna from the  <dig> identified bac clones resulted in two distinct amplification patterns. the clones e <dig> and e <dig> gave rise to a pcr product with the primer pair of s <dig>  s <dig>  but not with the primer pair of s <dig>  s <dig>  on the contrary, the clones d <dig>  d <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> gave rise to a pcr product with the primer pair of s <dig>  s <dig>  but not with the primer pair of s <dig>  s <dig> . sequencing of the two pcr products indicated that they are different osbri <dig> orthologs with high homology . sequencing of representative bac clones from both groups  revealed differences in various positions of the s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> primers between osbri <dig> and its switchgrass counterparts in two bacs . it is therefore tempting to speculate that switchgrass osbri <dig> orthologs are single-copy genes, residing in the two homoeologous genomes in the autotetraploid switchgrass, and the two groups of bacs represent dna fragments from homoeologous regions surrounding osbri <dig> orthologs. to examine this possibility, all  <dig> identified bacs were subsequently subjected to restriction patterning to determine the extent of shared overlap by high information content fingerprinting   <cit> . bac fingerprinting assembly at 1e- <dig>  tolerance of  <dig>  resulted in three contigs, of which two corresponded to the two different groups of clones initially revealed by pcr analysis of the osbri <dig> orthologs, i.e., d <dig>  d <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> were in contig  <dig>  whereas e <dig> and e <dig> were in contig  <dig> . a third contig, contig  <dig> was composed of  <dig> bacs identified with moderate hybridization signals that did not produce any positive pcr amplicons when analyzed using primer pairs of s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  s <dig> respectively.

bac sequencing and assembly
to gain insight into switchgrass osbri <dig> orthologs and their surrounding sequences in the two homoeologous genomes, a consensus bac from each of the two mapped fingerprint contigs, contig  <dig> and contig  <dig>  was sequenced to an 8× coverage, assembled, and finished according to the bridging shotgun method and the bermuda standards for finishing. sequencing of the bac 48e <dig>  from the contig  <dig>  and 65j <dig>  from the contig  <dig> resulted in a total length of  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp, respectively. sequence data from the two osbri1-containng bac representatives not only allow for comparative genomic analysis of the switchgrass genome but also provide references to validate assembly of contigs and evaluate switchgrass genome using additional molecular approaches.

validation of the two switchgrass homoeologous contigs spanning the regions containing the osbri <dig> orthologs
to confirm correct chromosomal locations and genome assignments of the  <dig> switchgrass bac clones assembled into two homoeologous contigs spanning the regions containing the osbri <dig> orthologs , twelve pairs of primers were designed based on the sequences of the two bac clones, 48e <dig>  and 65j <dig> , and utilized for pcr with dnas from the  <dig> osbri <dig> ortholog-containing bacs . presence or absence of pcr amplicons in each of the  <dig> bacs mapped to the two contigs should confirm correct contig assembly, and therefore the genome and homoeologous chromosomal assignment. as demonstrated in figure  <dig> and summarized in table  <dig>  the presence or absence of pcr amplicons for each of the  <dig> bacs match the patterns as predicted from the physical maps, thus supporting contig assembly obtained by bac fingerprinting . these initial data indicate the feasibility of using hicf fingerprinting to resolve the homoeologous chromosomes of the two distinct genomes in switchgrass, providing a robust and accurate bac-based physical platform for this polyploidy species.

assessment of the tetraploid switchgrass genome by southern analysis
sequencing data from the two switchgrass osbri <dig> ortholog-containing bacs provide information about restriction sites surrounding the osbri <dig> orthologs. to further confirm that orthologs of the osbri <dig> are indeed single-copy genes in switchgrass, we conducted southern analysis of switchgrass genomic dna using the rice osbri <dig> gene as probe. dna was digested with three enzymes, bamhi, psti and xhoi, and rice genomic dna was used as positive control. hybridization of osbri <dig> to bamhi- or psti-digested rice genomic dna both resulted in one single band of expected size as predicted from rice genomic dna sequence . when xhoi-digested rice genomic dna was probed by osbri <dig>  two bands of expected sizes  were revealed . an additional band of >  <dig> kb was also observed most probably due to incomplete digestion of genomic dna . similarly, switchgrass genomic dna digested with various restriction enzymes led to the same patterns as predicted from the sequences of the two bac clones, and no additional hybridization signals were detected . hybridization of bamhi-digested genomic dna with heterologous probe, osbri <dig> revealed three bands of ~ <dig>  kb,  <dig>  kb, and  <dig>  kb as well as an additional band of >  <dig> kb , in agreement with the pattern predicted from the sequences surrounding the osbri <dig> orthologs in the two bac clones, 48e <dig>  and 65j <dig>  . hybridization of psti-digested genomic dna with heterologous probe, osbri <dig> revealed three bands of ~ <dig>  kb,  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb as expected , one additional predicted dna fragment of  <dig> bp was not observed in this blot because it had run out of the gel during electrophoresis, which was confirmed in a separate southern hybridization experiment . in the case of dna digested by xhoi, southern hybridization resulted in three bands of predicted sizes of ~ <dig>  kb,  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb . the fourth band of  <dig> bp had run out of the gel during electrophoresis, which was confirmed in a separate southern hybridization experiment . thus, southern analysis results strongly suggest that the switchgrass osbri <dig> orthologs exist as single-copy genetic loci, residing in two homoeologous genomes, and that the tetraploid switchgrass is autopolyploid.

homoeology and extent of fractionation between switchgrass bacs
the two switchgrass bacs sequenced in this study were identified based upon their hybridization to the same osbri <dig> probe and position in different bac fingerprint contigs . those experiments do not provide sequence level evidence that these two bacs are indeed homoeologous  and are derived from two ancestral genomes. the bac to bac alignment can be visualized in figure 7a and 7b as a dot plot or percent identity plot, respectively. using all  <dig> blastn  <cit>  alignments greater than  <dig> bp in length,  <dig>  nucleotides overlap between the two bacs with an average percent identity of 94%. both switchgrass bacs map to the same orthologous region in rice  suggesting that they came from a common ancestral position . in addition, the repeat density for these two bacs is highly similar  also suggesting that they come from similar genomic regions.

discussion
a critical tool for the genomic enablement of any plant species with a large, complex genome is the availability of a deep-coverage, large-insert  library that can serve as the centrepiece for the generation and integration of genome-level information. bac libraries serve as the platform for physical mapping, positional cloning, integration of genetic maps, comparative studies, and whole-genome sequencing. we constructed the first switchgrass bac library consisting of  <dig>  clones with an average insert size of  <dig> kb using genomic dna from a lowland ecotype, alamo derived genotype that has been demonstrated to be superior in biomass production . the switchgrass bac library totals  <dig> × coverage of the total nuclear content of this tetraploid switchgrass genotype and  <dig> × coverage of each of the two genomes.

polyploids are common in seed plants with the majority of them being allopolyploids. polyploidy plays an important role in plant genome evolution  <cit> . it has been suggested that the tetraploid switchgrass lowland ecotypes behave as an autopolyploid with complete or near complete disomic inheritance and specific bivalent pairing of chromosomes in groups of four at meiosis  <cit> . our data using two sequenced bac clones suspected to reside on homoeologous genomes, support a trend toward autopolyploidy and the feasibility of resolving the homoeologous genomes in switchgrass using high information content fingerprinting. saini et al.  <cit>  demonstrated this when the polyploidy nature of glycine max was assessed by bac-based fingerprinting, integration of genetic markers, and whole-genome/bac-end sequence. in soybean, 5-10% sequence divergence is necessary to separate the homoeologs by hicf fingerprinting  <cit> . this group used bac-end sequences from three minimum tile paths to examine the extent of polyploidy-like regions within contigs, and the extent of correlation between the polyploidy-like regions inferred from fingerprinting and the polyploid-like sequences inferred from whole genome shotgun sequence matches  <cit> . the result improved whole genome sequence contig and scaffold building methods by sequence assessment and physical location. in order to fully understand the origins of the polyploid switchgrass, whole genome sequencing of related taxa and fluorescent in situ hybridization techniques should be used.

in an effort to assess the possibility of bac-based physical mapping in polyploidy plant species, luo et al.  <cit>  assembled contigs of fingerprinted clones in an in silico merged bac library composed of single-chromosome libraries of two wheat homoeologous chromosome arms, 3as and 3ds, and complete chromosome 3b. an average of  <dig> % or more clones from a single chromosome arm was achieved, indicating a very high fidelity of contig assembly and the negligibly low level of incorporation of clones from homoeologous chromosome arms into a contig during contig assembly. this result strongly suggests the feasibility of contig construction and physical mapping using global bac libraries in polyploidy species.

in the current project, we identified  <dig> clones positive for the osbr <dig> homologue by dna hybridization to the bac filters. using hicf, we assembled a bac clone based physical map of the rice homologue osbri <dig> genomic region in switchgrass and sequenced a consensus bac from each of the homoeologous contigs for comparative analysis. of the  <dig> positive clones,  <dig> and  <dig> showed strong and moderate signal intensity, respectively. upon further analysis of the homoeologous contigs, both switchgrass bacs map to the same orthologous region in rice suggesting that they came from a common ancestral position. the degree of intragenomic alignment and preservation of gene order relative to all the four grass genomes suggest that the  <dig> bacs are homoeologous yet have undergone significant fractionation. the degree of fractionation can be qualitatively seen in the alignment of orthologous regions in rice and three additional grasses . for example, it appears that the sub-genome from which 48e <dig>  was derived has lost at least two rice genes  whereas these genes were maintained in the genome from which 65j <dig>  was derived yet this genome has lost loc_os1g <dig>  these comparative genomic data, degree of sequence divergence, and physical map evidence suggest that the two switchgrass genomes are similar enough to discover homoeologous segments yet divergent enough to make it difficult to select indistinguishable bacs from a bac library.

to our knowledge, this is the very first report using one gene, osbri <dig> to comprehensively characterize switchgrass genome organization from various aspects demonstrating the feasibility of using hicf to resolve the homoeologous chromosomes of the two distinct genomes in this species. next step would be to extend the analysis using multiple loci covering large genomic regions to further validate the data presented in this study.

bac-based whole genome physical mapping has recently evolved into the second generation arena and advancement in resolution  suggests more robust contig builds. for example, van oeveren et al. studied the feasibility of using a next-generation sequencing-based strategy, the whole-genome profiling  for physical mapping  <cit> . de novo contigs assembly by wgp technology in arabidopsis thaliana ecotype columbia resulted in high quality physical map, which was confirmed using the columbia reference sequence. the application and simulation of this technology in other plant genomes seem to suggest its scalability to complex genomes  <cit> . although it remains unclear if next generation physical mapping can resolve homoeologous genomic segments, high-throughput next-generation sequencing-based technologies could potentially lead to more robust solutions towards highly reliable physical map construction, therefore worth exploring. in either case, a heuristic bac by bac sequencing approach from a minimum tiling path of the switchgrass genome should work.

CONCLUSIONS
we have constructed a large insert bac library from a tetraploid switchgrass genotype that contains about  <dig> genome equivalents with an average insert size of  <dig> kb. the feasibility of contigs assembly, and eventually physical map construction from fingerprinted bac clones in a polyploid species was studied. results from comparative analysis of bacs containing orthologs of the rice osbri <dig> locus demonstrated that orthologous clones from homoeologous chromosomes can be unambiguously distinguished from each other, and correctly assembled to respective contigs. thus, the data obtained from this research not only provide genomic resources and sequence data for further analysis of switchgrass genome, but also lead the way for an accurate genome sequencing strategy.
