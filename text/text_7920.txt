BACKGROUND
cucumber  is a staple vegetable that produces tender edible fruits. in production, cucumber is susceptible to a variety of infections that severely affect its yield and quality. two major diseases that affect cucumber production are cucumber downy mildew caused by pseudoperonospora cubensis   <cit>  and cucumber target spot caused by corynespora cassiicola   <cit> . disease epidemics involving these pathogens generally spread quickly, disrupting cucumber production. downy mildew and target spot, reduce cucumber yields by 50%  <cit>  and 60–70%  <cit> , respectively. the production and quality of cucumber have been affected resulting in economic losses. there is some controversy about genetic control of resistance to downy mildew and target spot. some studies reported that resistance to downy mildew is controlled by multiple genes , while others believe it to result from a single recessive gene . resistance to target spot is generally believed to be controlled by a single gene. however, whether this gene is dominant or recessive has been discussed. several studies have shown that resistance is controlled by a single dominant gene  <cit> , while others indicate that it is controlled by a single recessive gene . the discrepancies in the above results may be related to the use of different experimental materials. the use of single-disease-resistant cucumber varieties has already proven insufficient to prevent losses in cucumber production due to these diseases. therefore, the study of broad-spectrum disease resistance mechanisms can be important to establish the genetic basis for the development of multi-disease-resistant cucumber varieties.

unlike mammals, plants are not equipped with mobile cells and do not possess an adaptive immune system. however, during co-evolution with pathogens, plants developed an innate immune system  <cit>  consisting of two levels. the first level involves pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity , which can prevent some pathogens from entering the cell via oxygen bursts and callose deposition . the second level consists of the specific recognition of resistance proteins and avirulence proteins, triggering the hypersensitive response and inhibiting the growth of pathogenic bacteria via programmed cell death in a process known as effector-triggered immunity   <cit> . transcription factors can activate or inhibit the expression of genes related to disease resistance; thus, they play an important role in disease resistance in plants  <cit> . the ap2/erf-like transcription factors compose a large family of proteins that is divided into five subfamilies based on the number of ap2/erf domains; they include ap <dig>  rav, dreb, erf, and others  <cit> . the erfs are a major subfamily of the ap2/erf transcription factor family and occur widely in plants. erf-subfamily transcription factors have been isolated from arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , tobacco  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , rice  <cit> , maize  <cit> , and tomato  <cit> . erfs can regulate the expression of the pr genes in combination with the gcc-box and dre/crt cis-acting elements in the promoter region of the gene  <cit> . pr genes play an important role in plant resistance to various infections  <cit> . expression of pr-1a, pr <dig>  pr <dig>  and pr <dig> genes has been associated with resistance to pathogen infection and has been shown to improve plant disease resistance . erf transcription factors are involved in a variety of plant hormone signaling pathways  <cit> , and are the connecting factors of signal cross-linking pathway under stress, thus playing an important role in plant growth and development as well as in resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses . over-expression of erf genes in rice  <cit>  and soybean  <cit>  has been shown to increase plant disease resistance.

to date, a total of  <dig> genes that encode complete ap2/erf domains have been identified in the cucumber genome  <cit> . however, our understanding of the function of the cucumber erf gene subfamily is limited because only a single gene, cserf , has been reported to regulate the expression of the bitter gene bi  <cit> . furthermore, erf has not been reported that regulates to cucumber disease resistance. in the present study, we cloned the cserf <dig> gene, analysed its expression patterns after inoculation with only c. cassiicola, only p. cubensis or both pathogens, and explored its role in disease resistance using transgenic validation in cucumber, thereby laying the foundation for cultivating multi-resistant cucumber varieties.

analysis of the cserf <dig> gene expression pattern under pathogen stress
after inoculation with either p. cubensis or c. cassiicola as well as after inoculation of both pathogens, the expression of the cserf <dig> gene was differed between the resistant cultivar d <dig> and the susceptible cultivar d <dig> 

after inoculation with p. cubensis, the expression level of the cserf <dig> gene in the d <dig> genotype was significantly increased at 8 h, and reached a peak at 48 h , and then decreased slightly, but yet remained higher than that of the control, . the expression level of the cserf <dig> gene in the d <dig> genotype was only significantly increased at 12 h .fig.  <dig> relative expression levels of the cserf <dig> gene in two cucumber varieties and after three treatments. a and b represent the relative expression levels of cserf <dig> in the resistant cultivar d <dig> and susceptible cultivar d <dig>  respectively. w: water control. p: inoculation of p. cubensis. c: inoculation of c. cassiicola. pc: inoculation of both pathogens. there were three biological replicates per treatment and three technical replicates per sample. student’s t-test was used for comparison between two samples. “**” indicates that the difference between the corresponding column value and the adjacent control column value is significant




after inoculation with c. cassiicola, the expression level of cserf <dig> gene in the d <dig> genotype was significantly increased at 4 h, and reached a peak at 96 h , and then decreased slightly, but yet remained higher than that of the control . the expression level of cserf <dig> gene in the d <dig> genotype was significantly increased at 12 h  and 120 h  .

after inoculation with both pathogens, the expression level of cserf <dig> gene in the d <dig> genotype was significantly increased at 8 h, and reached a peak at 96 h , and then decreased slightly, but yet remained higher than that of the control . the expression level of cserf <dig> gene in the d <dig> genotype was significantly increased at 12 h  and 120 h  .

the above results show that the expression of cserf <dig> gene was significantly up-regulated in the resistant cultivar d <dig> during the early stage of infection, and this expression was high and long-lasting. in the susceptible cultivar d <dig>  the expression of cserf <dig> gene was also significantly up-regulated at the later stage of infection, although this induction was comparatively lower and shorter in duration than that in d <dig> 

gene expression patterns are often associated with gene function  <cit> . differences in the expression of the cserf <dig> gene in response to p. cubensis and c. cassiicola were observed between the resistant cultivar d <dig> and the susceptible cultivar d <dig>  indicating that the cserf <dig> gene might be closely associated with resistance to downy mildew and target spot.

analysis of the cserf <dig> gene expression pattern in response to hormone induction
plant resistance to diseases involves hormone signal transduction pathways. erf transcription factors are involved in a variety of hormone responses  <cit> . in the present study, the resistant cucumber cultivar d <dig> was treated with methyl jasmonate , salicylic acid  and ethylene, respectively. after meja treatment, cserf <dig> expression did not significantly change . after sa treatment, cserf <dig> was significantly up-regulated and reached its peak expression at 12 h, with an expression level  <dig> –7-fold higher than that in the control . after et treatment, the expression of cserf <dig> also was significantly up-regulated and peaked at 12 h, with an expression level 7– <dig> -fold higher than that in the control . these findings show that cserf <dig> can be up-regulated by sa and et, suggesting that cserf <dig> may be involved in the sa and et signalling pathways.fig.  <dig> relative expression levels of cserf <dig> induced by different hormones in the resistant cultivar d <dig>  there were three biological replicates per treatment and three technical replicates per sample. sterilized water was used as a control. student’s t-test was used to compare two samples. “**” indicates that the difference between the corresponding column value and the adjacent control column value is significant

discussion
cserf <dig> is associated with resistance to downy mildew and target spot in cucumber
gene expression patterns are often associated with gene function  <cit> . under the stress of p. cubensis, c. cassiicola, or the combination of both pathogens, cserf <dig> was significantly up-regulated in the resistant cultivar in the early stage of pathogen stress, with high and long-lasting expression . in the susceptible cultivar, cserf <dig> was significantly up-regulated at 12 h and 120 h after inoculation, although the expression was relatively low and short in duration . the expression pattern of cserf <dig> was related to plant disease resistance, which indicated that cserf <dig> plays a role in cucumber resistance to downy mildew and target spot.

over-expression of cserf <dig> enhances cucumber resistance to downy mildew and target spot
previous studies have shown that the up-regulation of erf enhances plant resistance to single or multiple diseases. furthermore, the over-expression of the brerf <dig> gene induces the expression of ntpr-1a/c, ntpr <dig>  and ntpr-1b and enhanced the resistance of tobacco to ralstonia solanacearum  <cit> . the over-expression of gmerf <dig> enhanced tobacco resistance to bacterial wilt, brown spot, and tobacco mosaic virus  <cit> . the over-expression of aaerf <dig> induced the expression of the pdf <dig>  gene and positively regulated artemisia annua resistance to botrytis cinerea  <cit> . chen and guo introduced the tobacco opbp <dig> gene into rice to enhance its resistance to magnaporthe grisea and rhizoctonia solani  <cit> . other studies have shown that erf negatively regulates plant disease resistance. mcgrath et al.  <cit>  and onate-sanchez et al.  <cit>  over-expressed aterf <dig> and aterf <dig>  respectively, in arabidopsis, and both reduced the resistance of arabidopsis to fusarium wilt. the results of the present study showed that the disease symptoms in csaerf004-over-expressing plants were significantly less severe than those of d <dig> plants . furthermore, the disease index of plants inoculated with downy mildew decreased from  <dig>  in wild-type plants to  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  in the transgenic plants . after inoculation with c. cassiicola, the disease index decreased from  <dig>  in wild-type plants to  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  in the transgenic plants . therefore, the over-expression of cserf <dig> could improve the resistance of cucumber to downy mildew and target spot. p. cubensis is an oomycete, and c. cassiicola is a fungus, indicating that cserf <dig> plays an important role in resistance of cucumber to fungal and oomycete infections. previous studies have shown that the over-expression of erfs not only increases the resistance of plants to fungi, bacteria, and viruses but also improves the resistance of plants to the oomycete family.

cserf <dig> positively regulates the expression of cspr <dig> and cspr <dig> and enhances cucumber disease resistance
erf transcription factors are capable of binding to the gcc-box or dre/crt cis-acting elements of the gene promoter region to regulate gene expression  <cit> . previous studies have shown that the over-expression of erfs in plants enhances plant disease resistance by increasing the expression of pr genes. the over-expression of the gberf <dig> transcription factor gene raised the expression levels of pr-1b, pr <dig> and pr <dig> to enhance the resistance of tobacco to alternaria longipes  <cit> . the over-expression of the brerf <dig> gene up-regulated the expression of ntpr-1a/c, ntpr <dig>  and ntpr-1b and enhanced the resistance of tobacco to ralstonia solanacearum  <cit> . pr <dig> and pr <dig> play important roles in plant resistance to pathogens. pr <dig> has antibacterial activity against magnaporthe grisea and fusarium solani  <cit> . the over-expression of pr-1a in tobacco enhances tobacco resistance to downy mildew and black shank  <cit> . the results of the present study showed that cspr <dig> and cspr <dig> could be significantly up-regulated after the over-expression of the cserf <dig> gene, which agrees with the findings of previous studies. compared to that in wild-type plants, the expression of cspr <dig> increased to more than 20-fold, whereas that of cspr <dig> increased to more than 6-fold . the expression of cspr <dig> was higher than that of cspr <dig>  which may be related to the cis-acting elements in the promoter regions of cspr <dig> and cspr <dig>  the cspr <dig> gene promoter region contains two core ccgac sequences of dre/crt cis-acting elements, and cserf <dig> may regulate expression of cspr <dig> by binding to these ccgac sequences. the cspr <dig> promoter region has neither a dre/crt cis-acting element nor a gcc-box  cis-acting element and has one ccgcc sequence and one ccgtc sequence. zhang et al. showed that leerf <dig> binds to the ccgcc box  <cit> . wang et al. reported that the third, fourth, and sixth bases of the conserved gccgcc sequence of the gcc box are essential for erf protein binding and that other base alterations may affect their binding efficiency  <cit> . therefore, the low binding efficiency of cserf <dig> and the cspr <dig> promoter may have affected the expression level of cspr <dig>  cserf <dig> may positively regulate the expression of cspr <dig> and cspr <dig>  thereby enhancing disease resistance in cucumber.

cserf <dig> may require the salicylic acid and ethylene signalling pathways to enhance disease resistance in cucumber
plants are equipped with different disease resistance signalling pathways that are triggered in response to different infections. the sa disease resistance signalling pathway is mainly involved in resistance to biotrophic pathogens, whereas the et and ja disease resistance pathways are involved in the resistance to necrotrophic pathogens  <cit> . p. cubensis is a biotrophic pathogen, deriving nutrients from living host tissues  <cit> , and c. cassiicola is a necrotrophic pathogen, deriving nutrients from dead or dying cells  <cit> . there is crosstalk among the sa, et, and ja signalling pathways, and erf transcription factors serve as the link among them  <cit> . gmerf <dig> is up-regulated during et, sa, and ja stress  <cit> . the expression of gmerf <dig> is significantly up-regulated during et and sa stress and is down-regulated by ja treatment  <cit> . the results of the present study show that sa and et, but not ja, could significantly up-regulate the cserf <dig> gene . the response of the cserf <dig> gene to sa and et may involve specific signalling pathways in cucumber. the sa and et contents increased in plants over-expressing cserf <dig>  suggesting that cserf <dig> over-expressing enhances the resistance of cucumber to downy mildew and target spot and that this resistance may be dependent on the sa and et signalling pathways.

implications in plant breeding
cucumber is a widely cultivated vegetable crop in worldwide. cucumber downy mildew has occurred in  <dig> countries  <cit> . cucumber target spot has been reported in america, china, japan and korea  <cit> . the two diseases have affected cucumber production. single-disease-resistant cucumber cultivars have been unable to meet production needs. therefore, cultivating multi-resistant cucumber cultivars is very important in cucumber production.

this study utilized transcriptome sequencing techniques, screened out the genes related to plant disease resistance. using transgenic techniques, we analysed gene function and it was confirmed that cserf <dig> is involved in resistance to cucumber downy mildew and target spot. conventional breeding methods were utilized to cultivate multi-resistant cultivars, which required the identification of multiple resistance genes aiming at different pathogens. the many genes involved may lead to excessively long breeding periods. identifying the genes related to multi-resistance and utilizing transgenic techniques to support breeding will possible shorten the cultivation period for multi-resistant cultivars.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, the cserf <dig> gene, encoding a member of the erf transcription factor subfamily, was isolated from cucumber and was found to be significantly up-regulated under the stress of p. cubensis and c. cassiicola infection in resistant varieties and responsive to sa and et treatments. in terms of the molecular mechanism of cucumber disease resistance, cserf <dig> may promote resistance to p. cubensis and c. cassiicola in an sa-and-et-pathway-dependent manner. based on the analysis of cserf <dig> gene expression patterns and transgenic validation, cserf <dig> is involved in resistance to cucumber downy mildew and target spot. results could be useful in the development of new resistant cultivars and in understanding the mechanisms of response to pathogens in cucumber.
