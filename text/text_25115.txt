BACKGROUND
the composition of snake venoms varies widely both within a species and among closely related species  <cit> . this variation is proposed to be due to changes in the diet of snakes, based on the findings in the variation of intraspecific venom composition in a pit viper, calloselasma rhodostoma, a land snake  <cit> . land snakes depend on a diversity of prey including lizards , frogs and toads , birds , insects , and rodents  <cit> . they probably require a range of toxins that target different groups of prey species since there is variation in venom's ability for immobilization and killing across such a variety of prey. toxins which are used for systematic prey envenomation found to have several isoforms in their venom gland as evident from global cataloguing of snakes toxin gene expression  <cit>  and it has been correlated that variation in prey favors the evolution of multiple isoforms of toxins in venoms  <cit> . the variety of isoforms is believed to have been achieved through frequent gene duplications accompanied by an accelerated rate of evolution  <cit>  similar to the generation of adaptive response in immunoglobulins and major histocompatibility complex genes in response to a wide range of foreign antigens  <cit> . thus, a birth-and-death mode of evolution generates diversity in toxins allowing snakes to feed on a variety of prey species  <cit> .

elapid snakes are a monophyletic clade of approximately  <dig> species in  <dig> genera  <cit> . true sea snakes  and sea kraits  form two elapid clades that have evolved independently but are either rooted within  or basal to  the terrestrial australo-papuan elapids rather than other elapid groups  <cit> . these snakes have adapted to marine life and undergone many changes in foraging behavior, morphology and diet  <cit> . as a result, although their feeding systems are confined to prey of a single vertebrate class , they often specialize on particular types or families of fish  <cit> . with such restrictions in both diet and habitat, one might expect low diversity in toxin components , as has been shown to be the case in the hydrophiinae subfamily  <cit> . we showed by analyzing the cdna library of aipysurus eydouxii that its 3ftx gene is inactivated by a dinucleotide  deletion  <cit>  and the evolution of its pla <dig> isoenzymes, unlike those from other snake venoms, is decelerated  <cit> . as this unique sea snake feeds exclusively fish eggs  <cit> , we suggested that a shift in the diet of a. eydouxii may have resulted in the relaxation of selection pressures on its 3ftx and pla <dig> genes

here, we examined the total gene expression pattern of two other sea snakes, lapemis curtus and acalyptophis peronii, which have distinct and different habitats and feeding systems. l. curtus inhabits many different areas like open sea, estuaries, and coral reefs, whereas a. peronii inhabits only sandy areas between coral reefs  <cit> . l. curtus in contrast to other sea snakes is a generalist feeder and its diet is one of the most diverse of all sea snakes  <cit> . its prey consists of fishes  and very few invertebrates   <cit> . additionally, l. curtus cohabits with other sea snakes, and consequently may be overlapping in diet. in contrast, the diet of a. peronii is confined mainly to gobies   <cit>  and it is a diet and habitat specialist. because these two snakes are members of a large adaptive radiation of the hydrophis lineage and they might have diverged very rapidly, differences in their venoms might also be widely divergent if they track diet specialization. on the other hand, if diet specialization within a constrained group of prey , drives more of a streamlining of venom evolution, then we might expect there to be few or no changes in venom constituents. therefore, it could be interesting to compare the total toxin gene expression of these two sea snakes.

we constructed cdna libraries of the venom glands from a. peronii and l. curtus specimens and sequenced about  <dig> clones of each. sampling of transcriptoms indicates the presence of any new and/or rare families of toxins and enables analyses of the molecular evolutionary trends among toxin genes. further, to compare the evolution of toxin genes among land snakes, sea snakes, and sea kraits, we calculated the evolutionary distances using all available sequences of two principle components of the toxin proteome, 3ftx and pla <dig> 

RESULTS
cdna libraries of lapemis curtus and acalyptophis peronii venom glands
we obtained  <dig> and  <dig> μg of mrna from  <dig> mg of venom gland tissues of lapemis curtus and acalyptophis peronii, respectively. we constructed two separate cdna libraries using  <dig> μg of mrna from each preparation. from the clones containing inserts, we randomly selected  <dig> and  <dig> clones, respectively. from these clones we were able to obtain sequences of  <dig> cdna clones from l. curtus and  <dig> cdna clones for a. peronii. figure  <dig> shows the distribution of clones in both venom glands.

lapemis curtus library
3ftx
to date, three long-chain isoforms of 3ftx  and four short-chain isoforms of 3ftx   <cit> have been reported from l. curtus venom. we found cdna clones encoding both long-chain isoforms  of 3ftx in the library  and the ratio between the number of clones of isoforms aal <dig> and aal <dig> was ~10: <dig>  we also found cdna clones encoding a short-chain 3ftx   <cit> . no variation was observed in the coding sequence of the mature proteins with aal <dig>  aal <dig> and aal <dig>  however, we could not detect the long chain isoform  and three other short-chain isoforms of 3ftx   <cit> .

pla2
so far, three isoforms of pla <dig> of l. curtus  have been reported  <cit> . we were only able to detect one isoform which is completely identical at the nucleotide level with aal <dig> .

crisp
partial sequences of two isoforms  of crisp from l. curtus venom glands have recently been reported. our cdna library contained ~2% clones coding for q8uw <dig> isoform without any variation at nucleotide level .

others
the cdna library has a singleton presence of a growth factor  which shows significant identity to platelet derived growth factor . the partial sequence shows 70% identity to the c-terminus of the predicted pdgf-d isoform from gallus gallus . although growth factors such as ngf  <cit>  and vegf  <cit>  are known to be present in the venom, this is the first report of pdgf-like protein sequence from the venom gland. however, further studies are needed to confirm the presence of pdgf protein in the venom.

l. curtus library contained ~20% housekeeping genes , including ribosomal rna, ribosomal proteins and cytochromes. in addition, ~25% of cdna sequences did not show significant identity to toxins or metabolic genes . blastx search of these sequences showed poor or only partial identity to any protein sequences with other organisms or no match at all. these unknown sequences in most of the cases are partial, singleton clones. however, their origin  still needs to be established.

acalyptophis peronii library
3ftx
amino acid sequences of two isoforms of short-chain 3ftx have been reported earlier  <cit> . gln <dig> of the major isoform  has changed to glu <dig> in the minor isoform   <cit> . in acalyptophis peronii library, the short-chain 3ftx was most abundant   and there are two isoforms of 3ftx in equal numbers . these two isoforms  have three nucleotide changes in their signal sequences leading to substitution of thr <dig>  and leu <dig>  by ser <dig>  and pro <dig> , respectively. however, no variation was observed in the coding sequence of the mature protein and the deduced protein sequence corresponds only to the major isoform  <cit> . as we did not obtain clones corresponding to the minor form, we propose that the minor form is most likely due to deamidation of gln <dig>  <cit>  and not a separate gene product. generally in toxin families, it has been observed that the signal peptide regions, 5'utr and 3'utr are highly conserved, whereas the mature protein region shows a number of substitutions  <cit> . in contrast, the two isoforms of short-chain 3ftx differ in their signal peptide region but not in the mature protein in this case. it would be interesting to examine the importance of these substitutions.

pla2
so far no pla <dig> sequences from a. peronii have been reported. we found partial clones having 3' terminal sequences of pla <dig> in a. peronii library . they show 100% identity in the 3'utr region with l. curtus pla <dig> . further identification and characterization of full length pla <dig> is underway.

others
the cdna library contains ~6% clones encoding housekeeping genes . these include nadh dehydrogenase, ribosomal proteins and ca2+ binding proteins . the latter class of protein has been implicated in toxin secretion  <cit> . like the l. curtus library, the a. peronii library also contained ~25% with no homology to any known toxin or housekeeping genes . as earlier, in most cases these sequences are partial, singleton clones and their origin needs to be verified.

intra and interspecific relationship of 3ftx and pla <dig> sequences
the number of available protein sequences encoding 3ftx and pla <dig> were higher than cdna sequences because most of the sequences have been reported from direct protein sequencing. therefore, we used protein sequences to calculate intra and interspecific pairwise distances for land snakes, sea snakes and sea kraits. it should be noted that due to paucity of the available data the number of species and number of short-chain 3ftx used for the calculations for land snakes, sea snakes and sea kraits were not the same.

for short-chain 3ftx, 37% of the intraspecific distances of both pseudonaja textilis and bungarus species  are in the range of  and  respectively, while 63% of the intraspecific distances of sea kraits fall in the range of , and most of the intraspecific pairwise distances of sea snakes are in the range of  . interspecific pairwise distances also appear higher  for land snakes, and lower for sea snakes . interspecific distances of 3ftx for pseudonaja species were not calculated because sequences were only available from one species . the higher genetic distances of 3ftx in land snakes indicate higher levels of genetic diversity compared to sea snakes, where sequences were much more conserved. the genetic diversity within sea kraits is intermediate in both intra and interspecific comparisons. for pla <dig>  22% of the australian elapids and 36% of the bungarus species intraspecific distances fall between  and  respectively. on the other hand, 97% and 44% of the sea snakes' and sea kraits' intraspecific distances ranged from  and  respectively . interspecific distances of pla <dig> for australian elapids, bungarus species and sea kraits and sea snakes have comparable values . but in sea snakes, interspecific distances  appear lower than the intraspecific distances. one of the possibilities for this reverse trend can be due to poor phylogenetic resolution among species in the hydrophiinae subfamily  <cit> 

discussion
snake venoms are a rich and diverse source of pharmacologically active proteins and peptide components  <cit> . some of these components are enzymes, whereas others are nonenzymatic proteins or polypeptides. most of these components are offensive weapons to capture the prey, injection of venom into prey leads to immobilization, death and can subsequently aid in digestion as well  <cit> . venom might also be used for defensive purposes to keep possible predators away. venom systems appear to have evolved to meet some of these goals, a single time in reptile evolution, at the base of the toxicofera  <cit> .

in this work, we show the high abundance of 3ftx in the venoms of sea snakes  while pla <dig> is a distant second largest group  of sea snake toxins. overall, both the 3ftx and pla <dig> do not possess an abundance of different isoforms generating significant variation in the venom composition. the fact that we did not detect some of the isoforms of these two groups of toxins as previously reported in l. curtus may be either due to regional variation within the species or a sampling artifact since the cdna library was generated from venom glands of a single snake. however, both groups of toxins appears to be simple and do not have noteworthy diversity in their isoform compositions. it suggests that sea snake venoms genes are quite conserved, and therefore lack the diversity in its venom composition as observed for land snake and sea kraits. however, additional data from gene expression profile, frequency of gene duplication and accelerated evolution profile of sea snakes is needed to further test this hypothesis.

comparison of intraspecific distances among 3ftx showed that the maximum value for land snakes is  <dig>  whereas sea snakes are at  <dig>  and sea kraits,  <dig>  . the variation between land and sea snakes is about  <dig> fold, whereas land snake and sea krait differ only  <dig> fold. however, this level of variation has not been found in pla <dig> genes. in land snakes, the maximum intraspecific distance is  <dig>  for land snakes and sea kraits, whereas sea snakes have a maximum value of  <dig> , indicating a difference of only  <dig> fold . interspecific distances, for both 3ftx and pla <dig>  on the other hand, show greater or equal values than the intraspecific differences in land snakes and sea kraits . from the genetic distance data, it is obvious that 3ftx is gaining more variability than pla <dig>  this is probably relevant because envenomation by elapid snakes is usually characterized by rapid neurotoxic complications due to presence of large amounts of neurotoxins  <cit> . overall, our calculation for the intra and interspecific variation in both 3ftx and pla <dig> appears distinct among land snakes, sea snakes and sea kraits indicating the probable existence of distinct evolutionary patterns that separate these groups.

interestingly, the conservation of toxin diversity in sea snakes is not confined within species, it extends across different genera. for example, enhydrina schistosa, a common sea snake, has just two neurotoxins   <cit> . the toxin p <dig> is identical in sequence to a short-chain neurotoxin found in lapemis curtus venom  <cit>  and the other toxin, p <dig>  is identical to the short-chain neurotoxins found in venoms of hydrophis cyanocinctus  <cit>  and pelamis platurus  <cit> . in contrast, among  <dig> 3ftxs reported to date  <cit> , we could not find a single 3ftx common across different genera of land snakes. conservation of toxin sequences, even across genera of marine snakes is possibly due to a highly constrained niche, and the streamlined nature of their venoms is responsible for the remarkable degree of antivenom cross-reactivity  <cit> .

the analysis of our cdna libraries indicated that the lapemis curtus venom is marginally more diverse than that of acalyptophis peronii. the l. curtus library contains crisp and growth factor isoforms in addition to 3ftx neurotoxins and pla <dig> enzymes. chen et al.  reported the presence of a kallikrein toxin in lapemis curtus venom as well. recruitment of additional toxin families like crisp, growth factor, kallikrein toxin may be due to its broad dietary requirements. in contrast, a. peronii venom glands contain only neurotoxins and pla <dig> in high concentration and ittargets only gobies as its diet  <cit> . therefore, evolution of toxin in a generalist  and a restricted feeder  appear to be different. this does not indicate that other toxin classes are not expressed at low levels; more rigorous sequencing may reveal rarer transcripts.

the toxin expression profile data from cdna library of l. curtus and a. peronii and a relationship between their habitat and diet may suggest that ecological variables presumably played a major role in determining the trajectory of their evolutionary paths along ecological niches  and not completely because of a distant phylogenetic relationship between them. there are however, a few specific cases available in the literature, where a relationship between intraspecific variations in venom with respect to dietary preferences has not been found  <cit> . do these specific exceptions prove the general rule, or is there a threshold where the evolution of toxins becomes decoupled from feeding ecology and/or diet? these questions remain cogent for the future of toxin evolution research and we propose that sea snakes will remain major players in helping to understand how toxin evolution and feeding ecology are linked.

CONCLUSIONS
global cataloguing of toxin expression shows conserved expression pattern of two main families of toxins, 3ftx and pla <dig>  in two sea snakes venom giving rise to a simple venom composition relative to land snakes and sea kraits. genetic distance values of 3ftx and pla <dig> toxins show a more diverse trend of evolution for land snakes and sea kraits than to sea snakes. as the diet breadth  expands from sea snakes to land snakes , we suggest that these trends in evolution of toxins may be linked to their diet.
