BACKGROUND
despite the success of breeding programs for increasing lean mass, the rate of postnatal death in european “commercial” pig breeds  has remained high at approximately 10-20% per litter and is therefore a major economic concern to the swine industry  <cit> . the neonatal piglet has body energy reserves of around  <dig> kj, mainly in the form of glycogen located in the liver and muscle with little white adipose tissue  and currently little evidence for brown adipose tissue  <cit> . consequently the neonatal pig is reliant on a regular supply of milk to prevent hypoglycaemia, a major cause of neonatal death  <cit> . consequently each dam requires a daily intake of up to  <dig> kj per day to maintain a positive energy balance and support the nutritional requirements of her litter  <cit> .

one strategy to reduce neonatal mortality is to add saturated fat to the maternal diet during gestation to promote glycogen and fat deposition in the fetus  <cit>  and to promote pre-weaning survival of piglets by improving their energy status  <cit> . however, there is evidence in both human and animal studies to suggest that consumption of a high-fat diet increases the risk of developing insulin resistance, sometimes without an increase in fat mass  <cit> .

the ability to suckle effectively during the first week of postnatal life is critical to piglet survival, highlighting the importance of physical mobility and therefore appropriate muscular development  <cit> . formation and contractile differentiation of muscle fibres in the pig, as in most large mammals including humans and sheep, occurs in distinct developmental stages during gestation  <cit>  and can be influenced by external factors, including the maternal and postnatal nutritional environments  <cit> . primary myofibres begin to differentiate at around 35 days gestation, followed by secondary and tertiary fibres and by the first days of postnatal life this process is permanently inhibited  <cit> . between 75 days gestation until 8 weeks of postnatal life, each fibre develops its own metabolic phenotype, which is associated with muscular maturation  <cit> . however, during the first 7 days of postnatal life, due to improvements in fatty acid metabolism, there is a rapid maturation in the piglets’ skeletal muscle fibre types and growth which requires high levels of protein synthesis  <cit> . between  <dig> and 26 days  protein synthesis declines rapidly  <cit> . this maturation is characterised by a rise in glycogen storage, leading to an increase in glycolytic metabolism, gene expression plus the activation of enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism  <cit> . these metabolic changes induce fibre hypertrophy and increase muscular strength – both changes are necessary to increase body weight and facilitate mobility and food intake  <cit> . modifications in myofibre development during the first weeks of postnatal life could therefore have important implications for subsequent muscular metabolic capacity. the n- <dig>  and n- <dig>  polyunsaturated fatty acids  are considered to be “essential” as they cannot be synthesised by mammalian cells  <cit> , these fatty acids are a crucial component of the phospholipid membrane of skeletal muscle fibres. whole animal and in vitro studies have highlighted the importance of essential fatty acids in muscle development; improved muscle development, maintenance and function was observed in cattle fed an n- <dig> pufa supplemented diet and n- <dig> pufa supplementation of l <dig> skeletal muscle cells also activated differentiation  <cit> . previous work conducted by our research team, in which we compared the hepatic development of new-born large white pigs with the slower growing meishan breed, revealed that these essential fatty acids have a major role in hepatic development during gestation and postnatal growth and metabolism  <cit> . the ratios of n- <dig> and n- <dig> fatty acids within the membrane of skeletal muscle have been implicated in glucose homeostasis  <cit> . to examine the underlying metabolic and developmental changes during early life, the present study compared two maternal isocaloric gestational diets, a standard commercial diet  or palmitic acid  supplemented diet  upon the biceps femoris, a mainly glycolytic muscle, of 7-day-old offspring, when energy requirements are at a peak. given the impact of fatty acids on muscle development outlined above, we hypothesise that increases in maternal fat intake during gestation would accelerate the biceps femoris’ maturation from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism; increase energy usage and related parameters of muscular development, including myofibre hypertrophy as well as produce differential fatty acid profiles.

discussion
the objective of this study was to explore the potential consequences of fat supplementation of the maternal diet during gestation on skeletal muscle composition in the neonate – a period of intense energy use in the pig. we have demonstrated that the transition from oxidative to glycolytic muscular metabolism was enhanced in offspring born to fat supplemented sows. this was accompanied with changes in muscle phospholipid composition; namely an increase in arachidonic acid and a decrease in α linolenic acid leading to an increase in the n6/n <dig> ratio and an increased neonatal growth rate in the absence of any effect on offspring birth weight.

we hypothesise that muscle metabolism was reset in utero as a consequence of an increased supply of energy from the mother ultimately leading to improved glycolytic and lipogenic capacity, thereby promoting myofibre development during early lactation. although neither individual skeletal muscles nor total muscle mass was assessed due to the limited space and time available during pig sampling within a normal commercial pig unit, we have previously shown that total muscle mass is not influenced by body weight after one week of age  <cit> . the progeny of fat supplemented sows may have experienced an improvement in the utilization of linoleic acid for conversion to arachidonic acid potentially activating prostaglandin production, an essential pathway for muscular development, although we did not observe differences in expression of cyclo-oxygenase   <dig> or  <dig> in the muscle from offspring  <cit> . to date, much of the developmental programming research involving increased fat consumption has investigated the effects of maternal obesity  <cit>  but has not examined the effects of macronutrient replacement in an isocaloric manner in a large mammal, such as the pig. only limited amounts of fatty acids cross the porcine placenta, so their contribution to fetal and muscular development is normally minimal  <cit> . our dietary manipulation may have promoted a more efficient mobilization of maternal body fat, reflected by the raised maternal hdl which would allow a constant supply of glucose to the growing fetuses  <cit> , for which glucose is a primary substrate for myogenesis  <cit> . piglets born to mothers exposed to a fat supplemented diet grew faster up to 7 days and exhibited a proportional expansion of myofibres and a metabolic maturation toward glycolysis, in the biceps femoris similar to the findings of jean and chiang  <cit> . histological analysis, however, failed to indicate which muscle fibre types were affected but decreased lipid staining was found within fibres located in the periphery of the fascicule, in parallel to a substantial increase in muscular glycogen, suggesting more efficient muscle metabolism  <cit> . although we cannot exclude reduced carbohydrate having a role in regulating the changes observed, as summarised in a systematic review of animal studies  <cit>  which have adopted fat feeding to mothers, our findings are supportive of the concept that fat is the main nutrient responsible.

enhanced whole-body growth requires extra nutrition in order to meet the increased metabolic demands, especially within skeletal muscle  <cit> . an increase in nutrient flux would reset the cellular ratio of nad+ to nadh thereby potentially increasing the concentration of nadh, which in turn, would inhibit activity of icdh to decrease the influx of glycolytic metabolites through the mitochondria, these findings were observed in the fat supplemented offspring  <cit> . additionally, the increase in mrna expression of genes for proteins involved in glycolysis, such as eno <dig> and pgam <dig>  together with greater glut- <dig>  and ldh enzymatic activity are all indicative of greater glucose consumption  <cit> . other indicators of muscular development, such as the muscular protein content, total triglyceride content and the mrna expression of glut- <dig> were unaffected, emphasising that other components of muscle metabolism were unaffected.

can maternal diet modify the muscular incorporation of essential fatty acids in the neonate?
we also observed differential effects of maternal fat supplementation upon muscle fatty acid composition of the offspring, in particular n- <dig> and n- <dig> fatty acids. these essential fatty acids are crucial components of the cellular membrane, affecting structural and regulatory properties that need to adapt to changes in fatty acid supply  <cit> . there is indirect evidence of a different pattern of muscular incorporation of two essential fatty acids, arachidonic acid  and α-linoleic acid . both of these fatty acids are involved in several metabolic pathways associated with muscular development and insulin signalling  <cit> . α-linolenic acid itself can repress the actions of arachidonic acid, it appears likely that reduced α-linolenic acid is responsible for the increased proportion of arachidonic, and may facilitate further muscle growth  <cit> . the fatty acid composition of skeletal muscle is also influenced by lipid binding proteins such as lpl and cd36/fat, which allow circulating triglycerides to be hydrolyzed and free fatty acids to be accumulated  <cit> . expression of both these genes was increased in fat supplemented offspring, suggesting these processes were enhanced.

CONCLUSIONS
isocaloric replacement of starch with palm oil in the diet of pregnant sows has no effect on birth weight but does promote the ability of offspring to differentiate and develop muscle fibres of the biceps femoris by increasing glycolytic capacity  <cit> . this pattern of growth is sustained by an increase in cellular energy uptake and usage as well as differential activation of elongases and desaturases, that could affect myofibre metabolism  <cit> . these adaptations, which remain to be quantified in the long-term, may be useful to improve piglet survival.
