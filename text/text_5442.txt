BACKGROUND
many prevalent species of parasitic nematodes - such as ascaris lumbricoides, which infects over a billion people  <cit> , or necator americanus, the most geographically widespread of the human hookworms  <cit>  - migrate through host lungs as larvae. lung tissue is ruptured as the larvae burst out of the blood vessels to enter the alveolar spaces. although this process is typically asymptomatic in humans, it can also be associated with acute respiratory distress or longer term complications  <cit> . for example, infection with lung-migrating helminths has been associated with bronchial hyper-reactivity and other asthma symptoms among children in china  <cit>  and brazil  <cit> .

the rodent parasite nippostrongylus brasiliensis  has proven a valuable laboratory model for nematode migration through the host body. in mice, l <dig> larvae injected into the skin migrate via the lungs to the small intestine, where the parasites develop into adults  <cit> . peak abundance of nb larvae in the lung occurs around  <dig> days post-infection  in many strains of mice  <cit> . the lung migratory stage of nb is associated with a strong local type  <dig> inflammatory response that includes t-helper  <dig> cells, eosinophils and basophils  <cit> . alternatively-activated macrophages  have also been identified as a major component of the pulmonary response to nb infection  <cit> . aamφ are characterised by il-4/il-13-dependent production of chitinase and fizz/resistin family members  including relmα , the chitinase-like protein ym <dig>  and arginase- <dig>  <cit> , and all three proteins are consistently observed in the nb infected lung  <cit> . arginase- <dig> is the counter-regulatory enzyme to inos and can thus act to suppress no production and type  <dig> effector function. arginase- <dig> also has well documented roles in tissue repair  <cit>  and has recently been implicated as an anti-nematode effector molecule  <cit> . the functions of relmα and ym <dig> are less well understood but, like arginase- <dig>  they have been strongly implicated in the response to injury  <cit>  and have putative roles in the repair process, including extra-cellular matrix deposition and angiogenesis  <cit> . however, recent data have shown that relmα and macrophage-derived arginase can also negatively regulate th <dig> effector responses and thus limit the pathology associated with overzealous repair  <cit> .

although not formally proven, the association of arginase- <dig>  relmα, and ym <dig> with the tissue repair process suggests that in the context of nematode infection, chaffs, potentially produced by aamφ, may be required to orchestrate the repair of damage caused by larval migration in order to restore lung integrity. two recent papers have highlighted the potential for nb migration to damage the lung with potentially long term consequences  <cit> . both studies document haemorrhaging of lung tissue and sustained increases in airway hyper-responsiveness. a striking novel observation in these studies is that nb causes disruption of the alveolar architecture that is consistent with pulmonary emphysema many weeks after infection. dysregulated, aamφ-mediated repair of the damage caused by the nematodes may be responsible for such detrimental outcomes  <cit> .

helminths with lung migratory stages are often co-endemic with type 1-inducing parasites such as malaria  <cit> . given the potential for cross-regulation between type  <dig> and type  <dig> immune responses, we wished to use mouse models to investigate the consequences of co-infection for the pulmonary type  <dig> immune responses induced by nematode migration. we chose to focus on nb and a rodent malaria, plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi , that induces a potent type  <dig> immune response and non-lethal infection  <cit> . we challenged hosts simultaneously with these two acute infections, thus demanding polarized, conflicting immune responses at the same point in time. in addition, we expected nb-pcc co-infection to induce conflicting responses in the same anatomical location, because malaria-infected red blood cells  of many species, including pcc, adhere to endothelial cells of the microvasculature of the lung  <cit> . furthermore, malaria itself has been shown to cause lung injury  <cit> . thus, we expected the lung and draining  lymph nodes to be potential sites of strong interactions between nb and pcc. the idea that helminth-malaria co-infection may impose type 1-type  <dig> immunological conflict is not new  <cit> , nor is the idea that parasitic co-infection may alter the severity of pulmonary disease  <cit> , but our emphasis on the consequences of malaria for pulmonary type  <dig> responses has not previously been explored.

using these model systems, we assessed production of the chaffs, relmα and ym <dig> as primary read-outs of the type  <dig> effector response in the lung. we also examined thoracic lymph node  cytokine profiles, parasitology and systemic pathology, to set the co-infected lung in its whole-organism context. by  <dig> days pi, malaria infection had significantly reduced the expression of chaffs in the lungs of co-infected animals relative to those with nb only. this reduction correlated with changes in th <dig> cytokines in the tln, with co-infected mice producing significantly less il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> than mice infected with nb only. pcc co-infection thus reduced the extent of pulmonary type  <dig> activation and th <dig> polarisation in response to nb. future long-term experiments  in the co-infection model established here will explore how helminth migration may interact with malaria infection to affect chronic lung pathology.

RESULTS
nb infection caused loss of both body mass and rbc density but ameliorated pcc infection
to investigate pulmonary immune polarization during acute helminth-malaria co-infection, on day  <dig> we infected female balb/c mice with  <dig> nb l <dig> larvae, in the presence or absence of co-infection with  <dig> pcc-infected rbcs. our first goal in developing this model was to characterise the systemic pathology induced by each infection and co-infection. we thus measured body mass , rbc density , and malaria blood parasitaemia daily. we also assessed the presence of malaria parasites in lung tissue of mice culled at  <dig> or  <dig> days pi.

consistent with previous reports in rats  <cit> , we found that nb infection induced loss of body mass in mice during the first week of infection: nb-infected mice reached a significantly lower minimum body mass than mice without nb . this amounted to a mean loss of  <dig>  g, or ~3% of body mass, and was observed regardless of malaria co-infection. no further changes in body mass among groups achieved statistical significance, though pcc-infected mice showed an expected dip in weight around day  <dig> that was unaltered by nb.

in addition to weight loss, nb infection caused rbc densities to be reduced by ~5% . unsurprisingly  <cit> , pcc also caused loss of rbcs by  <dig> days pi . between days  <dig> and  <dig> pi, nb-induced rbc loss resolved, but pcc induced further loss of rbcs - up to 60% of original density . however, this was slightly  but significantly ameliorated by nb co-infection .

consistent with this slight protective effect of nb on rbc loss during peak pcc infection, nb co-infection was associated with a modest reduction in pcc blood parasitaemia, as determined by microscopic examination of blood films .

by real-time pcr, the number of pcc genome copies per  <dig> mg lung homogenate sample was assessed in pcc-infected versus co-infected mice. malaria parasites were present in the lung of most animals examined at  <dig> days pi and all animals at  <dig> days pi . at  <dig> days pi, which is shortly after nb parasites have migrated through the lung  <cit>  and coincident with the loss of body mass in nb-infected mice , co-infected mice had more pcc genome copies per lung sample . this could be due to enhanced pcc adherence to the lung endothelia  <cit>  during nb co-infection. however, by gross examination we observed substantial haemorrhaging in all nb-infected mice at this time point and thus it is also possible that leakage of blood into the lung tissue increased the number of pcc parasites in day  <dig> samples. at  <dig> days pi there was no significant difference between the pcc and the nb+pcc groups.

gut nematode burden at  <dig> days pi varied between experiments: for example, nb+pcc and nb mice bore 56+ <dig> and 35+ <dig> adult nematodes, respectively, in experiment one, versus 6+ <dig> and 1+ <dig> nematodes in experiment two. such variation has been previously reported  <cit>  and in the present study is likely to be due to the very rapid infection kinetics typically observed for our nb strain, which is not mouse-adapted . a difference of a few hours in nb injection times on day  <dig> and/or in gut sampling times on day  <dig> could therefore lead to the differences in nematode burden that we observed. indeed, two lines of evidence suggest that the number of nb larvae moving through the lung was much more consistent than the observed gut burdens. first, there were no significant differences among experiments in the amount of nb-induced weight loss  nor rbc loss . furthermore, type  <dig> immunological readouts were extremely consistent among experiments. for example, tln production of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig> in response to nb infection did not differ significantly among experiments . still, in order to be certain that experimental variations were not confounding any of our conclusions, we controlled for experiment in all statistical analyses of combined data .

nb-induced chaffs in the lung peaked around 5- <dig> days pi
before we undertook studies of type  <dig> immune responses in the lung during co-infection, we assessed the time course of nb-induced pulmonary expression of chaffs. previous work has mainly focused on chaff mrna expression in the lungs  <cit> . we wished to also ascertain protein expression in situ after nb infection, to more closely determine the location of these proteins in vivo. female balb/c mice were infected with  <dig> nb-l3s, or injected with pbs as a control, and relmα and ym <dig> protein levels were determined in balf  and lungs  at days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> pi, to reflect the early events, peak th <dig> time point and resolution stages of nb infection  <cit> .

relmα and ym <dig> were both detected in balf at  <dig> days pi, and rose to a peak around 5- <dig> days pi . expression of both proteins dropped off by days 20- <dig> pi. histological analysis of ym1-stained lung sections from infected mice illustrated this peak, with an increase in the intensity and area of anti-ym <dig> staining at 5- <dig> days pi . these representative micrographs also show the influx of ym1-positive inflammatory cells into the lung tissue that was evident by day  <dig> - e.g., alveolar and peribronchial inflammation. of note, although infiltrating cells were relmα+  and ym1+, epithelial cells also appeared to be a major source of these molecules. reece et al.  clearly demonstrate macrophages as sources of these proteins in the lung during nb infection but do not mention epithelial cells  <cit> . our data are more consistent with a recent study in which relmα was localized primarily to epithelial cells in nb-infected mice  <cit> . further, several reports on inflamed allergic  and fibrotic  rodent lungs, as well as our own unpublished data, demonstrate expression of both ym <dig> and relmα by epithelial cells  <cit> . by 15- <dig> days pi , ym <dig> protein expression had returned to near-background , with reduced inflammatory influx and resolution of the thickened and disrupted epithelial layer that was apparent at earlier time points. these data are supportive of the idea that pulmonary activation of aamφ is a highly dynamic process  <cit> .

pcc changed the dynamics of expression of nb-induced chaffs, especially  <dig> days pi
to assess the effect of pcc co-infection on the dynamics of nb-induced pulmonary aamφ and type  <dig> epithelial cell activation, we next analysed both mrna and protein expression of two chaffs, relmα and ym <dig>  at a series of time points during co-infection. we also measured local mrna expression of inos as a marker for type  <dig> macrophage activation  <cit> , which might be expected during malaria  <cit> . furthermore, we measured mrna of type  <dig> cytokines , as well as mrna of il- <dig>  a key cytokine likely to drive production of type  <dig> effector molecules such as the chaffs  <cit> . we chose to examine the effect of malaria infection around the peak of larvae-induced damage   <cit>  and the time of transition to adaptive type  <dig> responses   <cit> . we also assessed a later time point well into the adaptive immune phase:  <dig> days pi.

analysis of chaff mrna expression at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days pi suggested that the strongest interactions between nb and pcc-induced responses in lung tissue occurred 5- <dig> days pi . indeed, because days 5- <dig> pi represented a time of strong chaff expression in nb lung  and day  <dig> pi coincided with the presence of pcc there , it is perhaps unsurprising that days 5- <dig> pi could be the time of maximum effect of pcc co-infection. at  <dig> days pi, there was a transient elevation of relmα mrna in co-infected compared to nb-infected mice  that was reversed over the next few days: differences between the groups were not significant at  <dig> days pi, but relmα gene expression was significantly reduced in co-infected mice at  <dig> days pi . expression of ym <dig> mrna was also significantly lower in co-infected than nb mice at days  <dig> and  <dig> pi . in agreement with these observations, day  <dig> expression of arginase- <dig> mrna was significantly lower in the lungs of co-infected mice than in mice that had nb only . furthermore, chaff expression is known to be driven by engagement of il-4rα  <cit>  by il- <dig> and/or il-13; accordingly, il- <dig> mrna expression in the lungs of co-infected mice was significantly reduced compared to nb-infected mice at  <dig> days pi . this suggests that suppression of il- <dig> by pcc may be responsible for the reduced chaffs in co-infected mice. at  <dig> days pi, mrna expression for relmα  was slightly elevated in co-infected relative to nb-only mice, but chaff and il- <dig> mrna expression had otherwise largely returned to background levels. throughout this time course, pcc-infected and uninfected animals expressed little or no mrna for the chaffs.

in support of the mrna data, when we analysed protein expression in lung balf using western blotting, we saw a significant day  <dig> pi reduction of both relmα  and ym <dig>  in co-infected mice compared to nb-infected mice. by day  <dig> pi, the pattern had reversed, with co-infected mice expressing more relmα  and ym <dig>  than nb mice. chaff expression in pcc-infected mice did not differ from near-null expression in uninfected control mice . importantly, bal cell counts and cellular composition did not differ significantly among groups at any timepoint. there was a non-significant elevation in total numbers of cells in co-infected mice at  <dig> days pi and in nb mice at  <dig> days pi, which might partly explain the elevation in chaffs at these early timepoints. however, any apparent differences were entirely absent from the  <dig> and  <dig> day bal samples. therefore, the observed effects on chaff protein expression are unlikely to be due to differences in cellular makeup alone, particularly at  <dig> and  <dig> days pi. further, the inflammatory cells may not be the major source of chaff proteins in lavage fluid. the pattern and intensity of epithelial cell staining  suggests that these cells may be largely responsible for the changes in mrna and balf protein.

ihc scoring of lung sections further confirmed these dynamics. at both day  <dig> pi and day  <dig> pi, the intensity of relmα  and ym <dig>  staining in the lungs of co-infected animals was reduced compared to nb mice, though the relmα difference did not achieve statistical significance at day  <dig> . representative micrographs from day  <dig> pi show the reduced intensity of relmα staining in co-infected animals relative to nb mice and no relmα staining in pcc mice . no differences among groups were detected by ihc at days  <dig> or  <dig> pi. therefore, the expression pattern of chaff protein in situ was largely in agreement with mrna in whole lung tissue  and protein expression in the balf . as discussed above for the time course of nb infection , although ym1+ and relmα+ macrophages were present in lung ihc sections, the predominant cell type expressing these molecules appeared to be epithelial cells. furthermore, lung macrophages in this system do not appear to become classically activated, as assessed by lung mrna for inos and il-12p <dig>  which were not detectable in any mice at any time point, and tnf-α, which was detectable but at low levels that did not differ among groups . however, ifnγ was elevated in the lung tissue of all pcc infected mice, regardless of nb co-infection, at day  <dig> pi .

cytokine production in local ln largely mirrored pulmonary chaff expression
to assess whether pulmonary chaff patterns corresponded to immune responses in the draining thoracic lymph node , we performed in vitro culture of tln cells, in media alone or with antigen or cona. at  <dig> and  <dig> days pi, there were no significant differences in supernatant cytokine concentrations among infection groups. however, by  <dig> days pi, differences among the groups were apparent, as outlined below. no antigen-specific responses were observed  until  <dig> days pi . spontaneous and cona-induced cytokines exhibited identical patterns, though spontaneous responses were of lower magnitude.

at  <dig> days pi, nb infection in singly as well as co-infected mice was associated with significantly elevated cona-induced production of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig> compared to uninfected and pcc-infected mice . of interest, il- <dig> and stnfr <dig> were also associated with nb but not pcc infection . tnf-α production did not vary among infection groups , but pcc infection was associated with significantly elevated ifn-γ production compared to uninfected and nb-infected mice . to our knowledge, tln polarization by systemic malaria infection has not been previously reported. the th <dig> bias of the observed response to pcc was unsurprising.

co-infected mice differed from singly-infected mice in cona-induced production of some of these cytokines. for example, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig> production were significantly reduced in co-infected compared to nb-infected animals , while ifn-γ production was reduced in co-infected compared to pcc-infected animals . these results provide evidence of cross-regulation between th <dig> and th <dig> immune responses in the local lymph node during the first week of co-infection. this finding is consistent with a wide range of studies of murine co-infection .

by  <dig> days pi, the overall strength of tln cytokine responses had waned, but antigen-specific responses were detectable. correcting for background  secretion of cytokines in wells with media alone, antigen-specific responses to crude helminth  and recombinant malaria  antigens were each observed for a subset of the cytokines measured . for example, nb infection was associated with strong nb ag-specific il- <dig> responses , regardless of co-infection. co-infection, however, had a significant boosting effect on nb ag-specific il- <dig> . co-infection was also associated with significantly elevated msp-119ag-specific il- <dig> . tnf-α production, though greater than background, did not differ significantly among groups .

discussion
our primary aim in this study was to address the interplay of two acute infections that place conflicting demands on the host immune response, particularly in the lung. we wanted to focus on type 1-type  <dig> cross-regulation rather than any effects of regulatory t cells, so we opted for a model of acute rather than chronic helminthiasis. in addition, although anatomical compartmentalization does not preclude immunological interaction - for example, gut-restricted helminths can induce a strong systemic th <dig> bias  <cit>  - compartmentalization can buffer the effects of co-infection  <cit> . we thus chose murine infection models that would pose an immunological conflict in anatomical space as well as time post-infection . the dynamics we were investigating may have real life corollaries, because nematode migration occurs in the lungs of over a third of the world's human population  <cit> , many of whom are co-infected with malaria  <cit> . however, because both of our murine models  produce self-resolving infections, the effects of co-infection on anaemia and on pulmonary immunology reported here cannot be firmly associated with chronic disease outcomes until longer term co-infection studies are performed.

we quantified the health of mice in our experiments using two measures that have proven informative during pcc infection  <cit>  and pcc-nematode co-infection  <cit> : body mass and rbc density. to our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that murine nb infection has a negative impact on both parameters, although reduced weight gain in young nb-infected mice has previously been reported  <cit> . nb caused a statistically significant, transient ~3% loss of body mass from approximately 2- <dig> days pi, and in other experiments using a higher dose , mice lost closer to 10% of their starting body mass . migration of nb larvae through the lungs has previously been shown to cause two spells of inappetance and thus weight loss in rats, one associated with migration of larvae and the other with establishment of adults in the gut  <cit> . we detected only one period of loss of body mass; mice may be spared the second spell given the brief survival of adult nb in mice, particularly for parasite strains, such as ours, that are not mouse-adapted. we also observed a transient loss of rbc density in nb-infected mice. it was rather surprising that this effect - most likely caused by haemorrhaging of the lung following larval migration - was detectable at the systemic level. this suggests that the capillary damage and ingestion of rbcs by alveolar macrophages following lung migration of nb  <cit>  are associated with considerable blood loss.

a diverse range of outcomes is possible when helminths and malaria co-infect a host. co-infected mice in our study experienced two periods of rbc loss in quick succession - first nb-induced and then pcc-induced. however, they had slightly higher rbc densities than pcc-infected mice did, at the time of most severe malarial disease. this was associated with a small reduction in malaria parasitaemia in the blood. these results contrast with several studies of helminth-malaria co-infection in mice, in which malaria parasitemia was increased  <cit> , and/or malarial symptoms exacerbated, in at least some groups of co-infected mice  <cit> . for example, in contrast to the lethal inflammatory liver disease recently described in mice simultaneously co-infected with heligmosomoides polygyrus and pcc  <cit> , we observed subtle amelioration of malarial disease and no deaths. this disparity in the severity of co-infection could be due to the fact that we worked with a different mouse strain  as well as a different helminth species that migrates differently through the host body. however, we detected an elevation in msp-119-specific il- <dig> due to co-infection, so it is possible that the emergent il-17/il- <dig> axis described by helmby  <cit>  may likewise be involved in our co-infection system, though not in organs that negatively impact short-term survival. indeed, the mechanisms underlying the slightly protective effect of nb observed here are not yet clear. we are investigating possible immunological causes of this protection, including innate mechanisms such as ifn-γ+ nk cells  <cit>  and adaptive mechanisms such as cytophilic antibody isotypes  <cit>  that could promote malaria clearance; either might be altered by acute nb co-infection. however, it is also possible that lower parasitaemia might be the consequence of the rbc density changes induced by nb, as previous co-infection studies have shown that helminths can limit rbc availability to malarial parasites and thereby cap their replication . control of microparasites by th <dig> immunity and by rbc limitation are not mutually-exclusive possibilities  <cit>  and both might be operating in our model system. finally, it is possible that the sequestration habits of pcc parasites  <cit>  are altered by nb. these mechanisms remain to be investigated.

our results largely resemble those reported for other nb-microparasite pairings. for example, during co-infection of mice with nb and either toxoplasma gondii  <cit>  or chlamydophila abortus  <cit> , significantly reduced th <dig> responses  have been observed, independent of the interval between infections  <cit> . these data suggest that pcc is not the only microparasite that might reduce th <dig> responses to nb infection. mycobacterium bovis bcg co-infection, however, does not significantly impact nb-induced il- <dig> in the mesenteric lymph nodes  <cit> ; it would be of interest to know whether those lung-dwelling microparasites might have had similar effects to pcc on th <dig> responses, had they been measured in the tln. reported effects of nb on the course of microparasite infections are likewise mixed: densities of t. gondii  <cit>  and m. bovis bcg  <cit>  are unaffected by the presence of the nematode, while c. abortus density increases dramatically  <cit> . interestingly, the concurrent presence of influenza virus with migrating nb larvae in the lung exacerbates the severity of lung disease compared to mice with influenza alone  <cit> . a two-week delay between nb infection and influenza infection, or replacement of nb with h. polygyrus, eliminates the added pathology, suggesting that the simultaneous presence of larvae and virus in the lungs is required  <cit> . such may also be the case for pcc-nb co-infection. the nb-influenza study did not include immunological measurements, so the role of the immune system in generating the observed pattern is not known. indeed, this comparison illustrates that many details of anatomical location and parasite life cycles, as well as immunological interactions, must be taken into account to explain the diverse outcomes of helminth-microparasite co-infections  <cit> .

our most novel finding is that malaria infection has the capacity to modulate the host's pulmonary type  <dig> response to nematode migration. however, the long-term impact of the altered type  <dig> response is not possible to predict, because the function of type  <dig> immunity in this setting is not yet fully understood. there are at least three potential outcomes of a helminth-induced type  <dig> response in the lung. first, it may contribute to protection against incoming larvae  <cit> . second, type  <dig> responses are likely to be involved in repairing the damage that is inflicted by migrating parasites. third, as recent studies have shown  <cit> , lung migration and the associated th <dig> responses have the potential to cause long-term lung pathology. appropriate repair versus lung malfunction are likely to be flip sides of the same coin. indeed, although chaffs and arginase- <dig> are implicated in tissue repair, they are also associated with fibrosis, an overzealous repair process  <cit>  . predicting the effect of pcc co-infection on long term nb-induced lung disease is further complicated by recent data that suggest both arginase- <dig> and relmα can negatively regulate th2-mediated pathology  <cit> . by this logic, inhibition of these molecules by malaria co-infection may ultimately exacerbate th2-mediated lung damage.

however, our data suggest that the effect of malaria on chaff expression is not direct but rather via reduced th <dig> cytokines. the effect of pcc on nb-induced chaffs was not apparent until  <dig> days pi, when the extent of the increase in chaff expression was inhibited by co-infection. this was correlated with differences in cytokine production in lymphocyte recall assays, suggesting that changes in chaff expression were driven by changes in the t lymphocyte populations after the onset of the adaptive th <dig> immune response . a role for adaptive immunity is further supported by work showing that scid mice are not able to sustain aamφ responses in the lung following nb infection  <cit> , and a demonstrated requirement for t cells to sustain the aamφ response in a mouse peritoneal infection model  <cit> . remarkably, in scid mice, in the absence of t cells and aamφ, the nb-induced cellular infiltrate does not resolve  <cit> . the capacity of malaria to inhibit the transition to a full th <dig> response by  <dig> days pi may likewise be detrimental to full resolution of the inflammatory response, a step necessary for appropriate tissue repair  <cit> . by day  <dig> pi, however, the residual th <dig> responses in co-infected mice were as high as, or even higher than, in nb-only mice. in support of this, day  <dig> antigen-specific il- <dig> responses were particularly high in co-infected animals. thus pcc infection may protect against airway hyper-responsiveness through a reduction in peak th <dig> activation, or else exacerbate it due to sustained th <dig> activity. transient passage of nb larvae through the lung inflicts lasting damage  <cit> . whether transient impairment of pulmonary th <dig> responses by malaria co-infection also has lasting effects needs to be investigated experimentally.

a perhaps surprising finding in our study was the apparent absence of classical macrophage activation in the lung despite the clear presence of malaria parasites: we did not detect inos, il-12p <dig> nor elevated tnf-α mrna in lung tissue of pcc-only or co-infected mice at any time point. one could argue that malaria parasites stay in the lung microvasculature and do not cross into tissue. however, this is unlikely to be the case, given the extensive lung damage due to nb in co-infected mice, as well as evidence that malaria merozoites can be found dispersed in the lung  <cit> . furthermore, ifn-γ mrna was detectable in the lung of all pcc mice regardless of co-infection, suggesting that lymphocytes were activated, perhaps by innate activation of nk or γδ t cells. the most likely explanation for the failure to detect classical macrophage activation may be that lung macrophages, which are exposed daily to inhaled microbes, have a remarkably high threshold for activation even in the presence of ifn-γ and microbial stimuli  <cit> .

as with any laboratory model, it is important to acknowledge the potential disconnection between natural co-infections and the experimental systems and designs used here, including the relative timing of the two infections, doses at which they were administered, and the fact that we have only studied primary and self-resolving  infections. permutation of any of these parameters is likely to quantitatively, if not qualitatively, alter outcomes. for example, repair processes might readily keep pace with lung damage when the rate of exposure to nematode larvae is low, unlike in most experimental models. we used a relatively low dose of l <dig> larvae  but still exceeded natural exposure levels. furthermore, larval helminths and malaria parasites are unlikely to arrive in the lung within a few days of each other in nature, and it may be that pre-existing malaria would have had a different effect on pulmonary type  <dig> responses to nb migration, particularly if malaria parasites do not remain long in the lung. indeed, the most likely natural exposure scenario may be chronic malaria infection into which helminth larvae are "trickled"  <cit> , but experimental studies that mimic this scenario have yet to be carried out. nonetheless, lung dysfunction is seen as a consequence of helminth migration  <cit>  and both acute and persistent malaria infection  <cit>  in people, so high-dose experimental nb studies in which long-term lung pathology can be observed  <cit> , combined with simultaneous malaria exposure, may provide useful models for disease states in people.

CONCLUSIONS
with the experiments reported here, we have established an acute laboratory model of helminth-malaria co-infection that will be suitable for future work exploring the details of how type  <dig> inducing co-infections affect long-term, type 2-mediated repair of the damage caused by migrating nematodes. recently developed models of malaria-induced lung damage  might be analysed in animals co-infected with nb. corroborative studies in human populations may also be feasible. like migratory helminthiases  <cit> , severe falciparum malaria is associated with detectable lung injury, as measured by spirometry and clinical symptoms  <cit> . a study like brooker et al's analysis of whether the anaemia of hookworm and malaria are additive during co-infection  <cit>  that used spirometry to assess the pulmonary health of malaria-infected, a. lumbricoides- or hookworm-infected, and co-infected people could assess whether co-infection exacerbates damage. given the huge number of people with such co-infections, it is possible that clinical studies of malaria lung injury may gain insight from considering the presence, however transient, of helminths in the lung.
