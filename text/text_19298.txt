BACKGROUND
amino acids are not used equally in proteins. in addition to the physical, chemical and biochemical differences between amino acids, which may explain why some amino acids are more used than others, there are also differences in the amino acid composition that are associated with protein function or some characteristic of the species to which they belong. between proteins from the same species, differences in amino acid composition have been associated with expressivity  <cit> , the chromosomal position of their genes  <cit> , hydrophobicity and the number of transmembrane regions  <cit> , subcellular localization  <cit>  and protein function such as differences between ribosomal and non-ribosomal proteins  <cit> . the availability of complete proteomes from a large number of prokaryotic species has enabled a global comparison of their amino acid compositions to be made and some of the causes of amino acid variability between species to be identified  <cit> . between species, nucleotide bias and organism lifestyle, especially whether the organisms are mesophilic or thermophilic, are the two main factors behind the variability in amino acid composition  <cit>  and even in synonymous codon usage  <cit> . the methodology used in these analyses involves comparing the means and evaluating which differences are statistically significant or using principal component analysis  or correspondence analysis to determine which factors influence the amino acid composition of proteins.

most analyses that compare the amino acid composition between species use whole proteomic averages. however, it could be interesting to compare the amino acid composition of the same group of proteins from different species to check whether the predicted bias is widespread and affects virtually all genes within a genome. any differences found will then definitely be due to the use of different amino acids between species, not to differences in protein functions. several authors have used a set of homologous genes from different genomes to show that the observed amino acid bias is a general trend for the evolution of proteins  <cit> . here we present a similar approach in which we compare the amino acid composition of a set of  <dig> groups of orthologous proteins common to  <dig> archaeal and bacterial species. the additional values of our approach, however, are the large number of species used, the fact that the sets of orthologous sequences used correspond to different functional classes, and the procedure used. this procedure consisted of a multi-way method called tucker <dig> that analyzes the amino acid variability within and between species using a three-dimensional matrix as an input. in this matrix, the rows represented the frequency with which each amino acid is used, the columns represented groups of orthologous proteins, and the third dimension represented the  <dig> species analyzed. briefly, the tucker <dig> algorithm decomposes the three-dimensional matrix into a matrix of residuals, three component matrices a, b, c called loadings matrices, and a 3-way core array. this core array defines how the individual loadings vectors interact, providing which factor combinations best represent the data set in terms of explained variability. the order of the core array, i.e. the number of components that are calculated from each loadings matrix, needs to be determined from a priori knowledge of the data or by evaluating models with different combinations and choosing the order that provides the most accurate model. see the methods section for a more detailed explanation of the tucker <dig> algorithm.

RESULTS
to find the optimal order of the tucker <dig> model, we studied several combinations of different orders. we found that the  <dig> ×  <dig> ×  <dig> model was the most suitable because the other models did not improve in fit when higher orders were used. table  <dig> shows the elements of the core array obtained in the model of order  <dig> ×  <dig> ×  <dig> that describe the relationships between the three modes . the elements are sorted by the percentage of fraction variance that they represent. only those with the five highest values are shown. with only these five elements, more than 98% of the summed fraction of the variability of the dataset is represented. for all of these five elements, we have also found a biological interpretation and a correlation with some biological character.

there is a general amino acid usage that is independent of the function or organism analyzed
the  <cit>   factor combination  explains almost 80% of the variability of the dataset. this value is much higher than the other elements of the core array. figure  <dig> shows the representation of the  <cit>   against the  <cit>   combination . points representing protein function and organism  have a similar position in the  <cit>   combination and appear as a vertical line. the projections of the amino acid variables onto the horizontal axis show that the amino acids are not used equally. the amino acids on the right  are the ones used with the highest frequency in the data set. the amino acids on the left  are the ones used with the lowest frequency. this amino acid composition is very similar to the composition of databases of protein sequences. so, for example, the projections of the twenty amino acids onto the  <cit>   element correlates very well  with the amino acid abundance extracted from swiss-prot release  <dig> . these results show that there is a general amino acid usage in the proteins analyzed and that this is independent of the protein function or organism to which they belong. this important observation is only possible if a multi-way algorithm is applied to a three-dimensional dataset.

in the dataset analyzed, ribosomal vs non-ribosomal is the main factor behind variability in the amino acid usage between different protein functions
the  <cit>   factor combination has a variance fraction of  <dig> %. this represents the second element of the core array with the highest variance fraction. this element is represented in figure  <dig>  the loadings values of the organisms, represented by green triangles in figure  <dig>  are localized at the same coordinates. this means that the differences in amino acid composition related to protein function are a general trend and are independent of the organisms analyzed.

ribosomal and non-ribosomal proteins are represented by red squares and blue circles, respectively. each group forms a different cluster, which shows that these proteins have different amino acid usages. the good correlation  between the amino acid differences between ribosomal proteins and non-ribosomal proteins and the projections of the amino acid variables onto the horizontal axis of figure  <dig> shows that, except for s <dig>  l <dig> and l <dig>  the ribosomal proteins are distinguishable from the non-ribosomal proteins if we compare their amino acid compositions. figure  <dig> shows that the ribosomal proteins use the basic amino acids lysine  and arginine  and the small hydrophobic amino acids glycine  and valine  with the greatest frequency and use leucine  and the negatively charged amino acids glutamate  and aspartate  with the lowest frequency. the ribosomal proteins l <dig>  l <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  however, do not cluster with the other ribosomal proteins in figure  <dig>  s <dig> and l <dig> appear in the non-ribosomal cluster, and s <dig> and l <dig> have a slightly different amino acid composition from those of the other proteins . these differences may be due to the characteristics of these ribosomal proteins in the position or role when the ribosome is formed.

g+c composition and optimal growth temperature are the main factors behind variability in amino acid usage between organisms
the  <cit>   combination is the element of the core array with the third highest percentage of variance fraction. the position of the organisms in this element  correlates very well  with the g+c content of the organisms. this means that the organisms represented on the left of figure  <dig>  have the highest g+c content and those on the right  have the lowest. because of the genetic code, the organisms with highest g+c contents use the amino acids glycine , alanine , arginine  and proline   <cit>  with the greatest frequency. these amino acids are encoded by codons with a g or c in the first and second codon positions. this is confirmed in figure  <dig>  where the lowest values for the amino acid loadings in the  <cit>   factor combination correspond to a, r, g and p. the position of the amino acid valine  in this axis, close to the position of proline , is also interesting. valine is encoded by gtn codons, but there are more valines in g+c rich species than expected  <cit> . this may be due to the many conservative replacements between valine and isoleucine  forced by positive gc pressure  <cit> . on the other hand, figure  <dig> also shows that lysine , isoleucine  and asparagine  – three amino acids encoded by codons with t or a in the first and second codon positions – are the amino acids that are most used in species with the lowest g+c contents.

the  <cit>   combination is also represented in figure  <dig>  the positions of the organisms on the y axis correlate well  with their optimal growth temperatures. thermophiles  and mesophiles form two clusters in this figure, so they can be distinguished by using their amino acid composition. from the position of the loadings values, we can deduce that the amino acids preferred by thermophiles are mainly glutamate  and valine . the positions of halobacterium sp  and methanosarcina acetivorans  in figure  <dig> are interesting. the optimal growth temperatures of these euryarchaea are below 40°c, so they cannot be classified as thermophiles. however, they have a similar amino acid composition to that of thermophiles and cluster with them in figure  <dig> 

finally, the  <cit>   factor combination shown in figure  <dig> explains only  <dig> % of the variability of the dataset. this factor is a combination of the effects of the g+c content of the organisms and the variability in the g+c contents of the various orthologous genes. although the g+c content of a gene depends mainly on the g+c content of the organism to which it belongs, there are also variations in the g+c content of genes from the same organism. one of the reasons for these g+c variations within organisms may be compositional amino acid constraints. this is the case of ribosomal proteins, which, because of their compositional amino acid constraints, have a lower g+c content at the second codon position than non-ribosomal proteins. this effect is reflected in the correlation  between the projections onto the vertical axis of figure  <dig> of the variables associated with the protein functions and the mean g+c content at the second codon position of each group of orthologous genes.

discussion
the high percentage of the variance explained by the  <cit>   factor combination shows that the main determinant of the amino acid composition of proteins is independent of the protein function or organism to which they belong. the different uses of amino acids may therefore be due to differences in several biochemical characteristics. however, which amino acid properties influence their usage in proteins is still unknown. moreover, jordan et al.  <cit>  have shown that the amino acid composition of proteins is not in equilibrium. by comparing sets of orthologous proteins of closely related genomes from  <dig> species representing the three domains of life and comparing the fluxes of reciprocal substitutions caused by single-nucleotide replacements, these authors found that cysteine, methionine, histidine, serine and phenylalanine are strong 'gainers' , and proline, alanine, glutamate and glycine are strong 'losers'   <cit> . except for methionine, gainers tend to be under-represented and losers are over-represented  <cit> . this loser-rich and gainer-poor amino acid composition may be due to the order in which amino acids were recruited into the genetic code  <cit> . the correlation between the general amino acid frequencies that we observe  and the rate of gain or loss defined by jordan et al.  <cit>  is only - <dig> . the correlation, however, is - <dig>  when we compare the general amino acid frequencies and a consensus chronology of incorporation of amino acids into the genetic code defined by trifonov  <cit> . this relatively high correlation value means that the order of recruitment of the amino acids into the genetic code can be an additional factor that influences the different use of the amino acids. however, because trifonov used the amino acid composition of extant proteins as one of the  <dig> criteria to obtain his consensus chronology of amino acids  <cit> , the above correlation is not unexpected and must be interpreted with caution.

in addition to this general amino acid composition, there are obviously differences in the amino acid composition of proteins due to the function or organism to which they belong. the difference between ribosomal and non-ribosomal proteins is the main factor behind the amino acid usage within species in the data set we analyzed. shape and charge complementarity rather than sequence-specific interactions are responsible for the specific interactions of most ribosomal proteins with rna  <cit> . because of these interactions, ribosomal proteins prefer positively charged amino acids and avoid negatively charged ones  <cit> . the mapping of conserved arginines and lysines onto the ribosome structure has revealed that these charged residues frequently form surface patches that reflect rna-binding sites  <cit> . the ribosomal proteins l <dig>  l <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  however, do not cluster with the other ribosomal proteins in figure  <dig>  s <dig> and l <dig> appear in the non-ribosomal cluster, and s <dig> and l <dig> have a slightly different amino acid composition from the other proteins . these differences may be due to the characteristics of these ribosomal proteins in the position or role when the ribosome is formed. although s <dig> is one of the largest ribosomal proteins in the 30s subunit, it is very loosely attached to this subunit  and has the lowest percentage of arginine and lysine in it  <cit> . it is not unusual, therefore, for s <dig> to clusters with non-ribosomal proteins. with approximately  <dig> amino acids, s <dig> and l <dig> are the smallest ribosomal proteins in the data set. the short sequence of these proteins influences their amino acid composition and both appear as outliers in figure  <dig>  however, projection of the s <dig> protein onto the horizontal axis of figure  <dig> shows that, despite its short length, this protein has some characteristics of the majority of ribosomal proteins. s <dig> is completely devoid of any globular domain, and most of the protein has an extended coil structure  <cit> . although s <dig> is involved in intimate protein-protein interactions, almost its entire length is involved in rna contacts and its arginine and lysine contents are similar to those of most ribosomal proteins  <cit> . s <dig> is therefore indistinguishable from most ribosomal proteins in the x-axis projection of figure  <dig>  on the other hand, l <dig> interacts with the l <dig> protein and with only one of the six domains of 23s rrna  <cit> . this characteristic, and its short length, may therefore explain the position of l <dig> in figure  <dig> 

g+c content and optimal growth temperature are the two factors that most influence differences in amino acid composition between organisms. analysis of the optimal temperatures of the enzymes extracted from hyperthermophilic organisms showed that thermal resistance was an intrinsic property of these enzymes  <cit> . comparative analysis of the amino acid composition of orthologous proteins from several mesophilic and thermophilic organisms indicated some amino acid substitutions that are preferred in thermophiles  <cit> . however, the small number of sequences analyzed and the fact that factors other than temperature can affect the amino acid composition of proteins revealed the inconsistency of theses results  <cit> . comparison of the first completely sequenced genomes of several thermophiles and mesophiles showed that proteins from thermophiles contain higher levels of both charged and hydrophobic residues and lower levels of polar and uncharged ones  <cit> . once more complete genomes were sequenced, new analyses were performed using different methods and different datasets  <cit> . although these studies show several discrepancies in the role of each amino acid, there is a consensus that glutamate  and, to a lesser extent, valine  are the amino acids that are more represented in thermophiles than in mesophiles. these were also the amino acids that were most represented in thermophiles when our method was used.

there are greater discrepancies, however, over which amino acids are used with the lowest frequency in thermophiles or with the highest frequency in mesophiles. for example, singer and hickey  <cit>  found that these amino acids were a, h, q and t; kreil and ouzounis  <cit>  found that they were q and t; and tekaia and coworkers  <cit>  found only q. these discrepancies indicate that hyperthermophilic and mesophilic enzymes may be very similar – their difference being that hyperthermophilic enzymes are more rigid than mesophilic enzymes  <cit> . to increase their rigidity, hyperthermophilic enzymes may adopt several strategies but a common rule could be that more charged residues are found in hyperthermophilic proteins, mostly at the expense of uncharged polar residues  <cit> . computational, biochemical, and structural evidence now supports the hypothesis that ion pair formation, hydrogen bonds, and hydration, rather than hydrophobic interactions, play important roles in the stabilization of enzymes from extremophiles  <cit> . also, we cannot talk of a common amino acid usage in mesophiles because an adaptation to live at intermediate temperatures is unnecessary. when comparing the amino acid compositions of thermophilic and mesophilic proteins, therefore, different datasets and methods obtain different results.

the use of certain amino acids with higher or lower frequencies in thermophiles is important for the thermal stability of their enzymes. however, other factors may contribute to survival at high temperatures. thermophilic archaea, for example, may be protected by their unique membrane lipids, the use of a reverse gyrase that introduces positive supercoils  <cit> , a dna repair system  <cit>  and the presence of special dna-binding proteins  <cit> . one of these thermophilic-specific proteins may be highly basic histone-like proteins that wind and compact dna into a nucleosome-like structure and thus protect them from heat denaturation  <cit> . loss of some of these factors may lead to a lesser ability to grow at high temperatures. this could be the case of the euryarcheota halobacterium sp  and m. acetivorans , two archaea whose optimal growth temperature is below 40°c but that cluster with other thermophilic species in figure  <dig>  the amino acid compositions of these two euryarchaeota, which are very similar to those of other thermophiles, may be a trace of their past ability to grow at high temperatures. a thermophile-specific ntpase found in  <dig> thermophilic genomes and absent in  <dig> mesophilic genomes is present in m. acetivorans  <cit> . this suggests that m. acetivorans facultatively could be thermophilic  <cit> . although the phylogenetic position of these two archaea and our analysis of the amino acid composition suggest a recent transversion to mesophily in halobacterium sp and m. acetivorans, this hypothesis is speculative and needs to be supported by stronger evidence. in this sense, it would be useful to identify proteins present in all thermophilic euryarchaeota but not in mesophilic euryarchaeota. one of these proteins is a dsdna-binding protein called alba , which is present in several thermophilic archaea but not in halobacterium sp or m. acetivorans  <cit> . the correlation of alba with growth at high temperatures hints at a role for alba in dna protection and stability under these conditions  <cit> . interestingly, it has been suggested that this protein constrains negative dna supercoils in a temperature-dependent fashion, which suggests that it may function in chromosomal organization and accessibility  <cit> .

the relationship between genomic g+c content and optimal growth temperature in prokaryotes has been debated recently in the literature  <cit> . because g:c pairs in dna are more thermally stable than a:t pairs, it has been suggested that a high g+c content may be a selective response to high temperature. in this sense, a significant correlation has been observed between optimal growth temperature and the g+c content of structural rnas  <cit> . when open reading frames are analyzed, some studies have concluded that there is no correlation between g+c content and optimal growth temperature  <cit>  and others have found a positive correlation among some families of prokaryotes  <cit> . if this correlation exists, it could be argued that the g+c-content dependence observed in the amino acid composition of prokaryotes is a consequence of their thermophily-dependence. in our dataset, the g+c content at the third codon position and the optimal growth temperature do not correlate significantly . in addition, the results obtained with the tucker <dig> algorithm indicate that these two variables are independent. the amino acid variation associated with g+c content and optimal growth temperature corresponds to the second and fifth factor of the amino acid loadings matrix, respectively. because the principal components obtained with the tucker <dig> model were constrained to be orthogonal, it can be concluded that the two factors are independent. the correlation observed therefore for the second and fifth factors of the amino acid loadings matrix is only  <dig> e- <dig>  similar arguments can be applied to the second and third factors  of the organism's loadings matrix. moreover, the amino acid preferred by thermophiles is glutamate, which is an amino acid encoded by intermediate-gc content codons . all this evidence suggests that the amino acid variations related to variations of g+c content and optimal growth temperature are independent and that the observed g+c-dependence is not a consequence of a thermophily dependence.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that a multi-way method can be used to analyze differences in the amino acid composition within and between species. this method determines the relative influence of the various factors behind the heterogeneity of amino acid composition in proteins. also, using a dataset consisting of a group of orthologous proteins present in all the species analyzed ensures that the differences in the amino acid composition between species are related to an intrinsic property of their proteins.
