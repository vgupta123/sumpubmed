BACKGROUND
the problem of growing antibiotic resistance has been solved only in part by the introduction or reintroduction of new antibiotics . peptidoglycan hydrolases represent an alternative to small molecule antibacterials, despite concerns relating to immunogenicity, the release of proinflammatory components during bacteriolysis and the development of resistance  <cit> . the peptidoglycan endopeptidases lysostaphin and lytm cleave the characteristic pentaglycine crossbridges of s. aureus peptidoglycan  <cit>  and are therefore of interest as potential antistaphylococcal agents.

lysostaphin  is produced by staphylococcus simulans biovar staphylolyticus. the secreted preproprotein is synthesized with a leader sequence, proregion, catalytic domain, and the cell wall targeting domain   <cit> . the low complexity proregion consists of a variable number of stereotypical repeats  and a water molecule. as the name implies, the cwt domain anchors the protein to cell walls  <cit>  .

the biological role of lysostaphin is well established. the  protein is inactive against the producer organism, but very effective in cleaving s. aureus cell walls  <cit> . this property has made the enzyme attractive as an antibacterial agent  <cit> . the protein has been applied to disrupt s. aureus and s. epidermidis biofilms on artificial surfaces  <cit>  and has also been tested as a coating for catheters  <cit> . in a mouse model, lysostaphin has been used to eradicate s. aureus biofilms from a catheterized jugular vein  <cit>  and also for treatment of systemic infections  <cit> . in a cotton rat model, a lysostaphin cream has proven effective in eradicating s. aureus nasal colonization  <cit> . in humans, lysostaphin has been used on an experimental basis to treat methicillin-resistant s. aureus aortic valve endocarditis  <cit> . as the elimination of s. aureus carriage in hospital staff is demonstrably effective in reducing infection rates in surgical patients and those on hemodialysis  <cit> , a lysostaphin cream to treat infected, but asymptomatic hospital staff, has potential.

staphylococcus aureus lytm  is an autolysin under the control of the two-component system walkr, which is thought to play a role in virulence and cell wall metabolism  <cit> . the protein is synthesized with a signal peptide , followed by an n-terminal domain that is homologous to the staphylococcal secretory antigen a , another walkr controlled protein, but not to the n-terminal domain of lysostaphin. the c-terminal domain of lytm can be divided into an occluding region and a region of high similarity to the lysostaphin catalytic domain . the lysostaphin active site residues are all conserved, with a central zn2+ ion that is coordinated by his <dig>  asp <dig> and his <dig> of the catalytic domain  <cit> . nevertheless, the structure strongly suggests that full length lytm cannot have significant activity, because the active site is occluded. the expected water molecule in the coordination sphere of the zn2+ ion is displaced by an “asparagine switch” residue  of the occluding region, which also blocks part of the active site cleft  <cit> . however, the crystal structure suggested that the catalytic domain alone should be more active than the full length protein. this was confirmed for a tryptic fragment  and for the recombinantly overexpressed catalytic domain   <cit> . in this work, we use the designation “catalytic domain” for the lytm185- <dig> fragment for consistency with the well-established lysostaphin nomenclature, even though the catalytic domain and occluding loop form the globular unit in the full length protein  <cit> . lytm lacks a counterpart for the cell wall targeting domain of lysostaphin .

the biological role of lytm is still not clear  <cit> . the protein was originally described as an autolysin   <cit>  and reported to have glycylglycine endopeptidase activity  <cit> . both we and other investigators have since then carried out experiments that cast doubt on the peptidoglycan hydrolyzing activity of full length lytm  <cit> . nevertheless, the data clearly confirmed such activity of the catalytic fragment  <cit> . it remains to be determined whether the lytm catalytic domain can be released under physiological circumstances. a proteomic study of the s. aureus cell wall envelope fraction has identified only full length lytm , but not in the predicted active form  <cit> . although the physiological role of lytm and its catalytic domain remains uncertain, the catalytic domain has properties that could make it attractive as a potential antistaphylococcal agent. first, the protein can be easily overexpressed in escherichia coli with very high yields and is easy to purify  <cit> . moreover, preliminary in vitro experiments indicated that in certain conditions lytm185- <dig> was similarly effective as lysostaphin in clearing turbid cell wall suspensions.

therefore, we proceeded to compare lysostaphin and lytm in a new mouse model of staphylococcal infection. the efficacy of lysostaphin was confirmed in the new model as well. surprisingly, the catalytic domain of lytm was no more effective than control. this finding prompted us to compare properties of the two proteins in greater detail in vitro. here, we report the in vivo observations and the in vitro properties of lysostaphin and lytm that might explain the different treatment outcomes.

RESULTS
chronic contact eczema model of staphylococcal infection
a new chronic dermatitis model of staphylococcal infection for in vivo functional studies was developed. following standard procedures, mice were sensitized by epicutaneous application of 4-ethoxymethylene-2-phenyloxazolone  on the abdomen skin. six days later and subsequently every second day they were challenged with oxazolone applied to the ears. the treatment led to the development of chronic contact eczema in the treated ear, but not in the contralateral ear, which was left untreated as a control .

preliminary experiments were run to establish a suitable s. aureus dose for the infection experiments.  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> cfus of s. aureus strain ls- <dig> were spread on both ears of one mouse each. mice were sacrificed two days later, ears were homogenized and s. aureus colony forming units  counted. 106 s. aureus cells per ear were sufficient to establish infection in oxazolone-treated, inflamed mouse ears, but not in non-oxazolone treated ears .

to establish the time course for the infection, 106 s. aureus cells were applied to the oxazolone-treated, inflamed ears and to the non-oxazolone treated, contralateral control ears. at different time points following inoculation, mice were sacrificed, ears homogenized and s. aureus colony forming units  counted. in non-oxazolone treated control ears, no bacteria were found after the application of 106 s. aureus cells. in oxazolone pretreated ears, colony counts peaked two days after exposure, and bacteria were almost fully cleared six days after the inoculation .

lysostaphin is effective in the contact eczema model, lytm185- <dig> is not
the newly developed eczema model was used for in vivo comparison of lysostaphin and lytm efficacies.  <dig> mice were divided into three groups of  <dig> mice each. all mice were sensitized to develop eczema, and subsequently had  <dig> cfus of s. aureus p <dig> cells applied to their ears to induce dermatitis. twelve hours after inoculation of bacteria the treatment with lysostaphin and lytm185- <dig> was started. 100 μg of lysostaphin or lytm185- <dig> in 50 mm glycine ph  <dig>  with 10% glycerol was applied topically to each mice ear in a volume of 20 μl. in the control group, buffer alone was used for the treatment. ears were treated with proteins or buffer four times every  <dig> hours. three hours after the last treatment mice were anesthetized, the ears dissected and the extent of infection estimated as described above. on average, the lysostaphin treatment reduced the colony count by roughly a factor of  <dig>  in contrast to lysostaphin, lytm185- <dig> had no beneficial effect and was no better than control .

we reasoned that the different treatment outcomes could reflect differences in protein stability, affinity to either peptidoglycan or other components of cell walls, or the preference for a particular ph or ionic milieu and proceeded to test the influence of all these factors in vitro.

lysostaphin is proteolytically more stable than lytm185-316
during treatment, lysostaphin and lytm185- <dig> were exposed both to bacterial proteases and to host proteases at the site of infection. initial experiments demonstrated that both enzymes were stable in bacterial cultures . the stability to host enzymes was tested with blood and serum from rat, which were available from unrelated experiments without the sacrifice of additional animals. after 4 h incubation in 5% blood, the majority of lytm185- <dig> was degraded while the degradation of lysostaphin was minimal. both proteins were more stable in 5% serum, but again lytm185- <dig> was less stable than lysostaphin .

lysostaphin and lytm185- <dig> recognize different cell wall components
the affinity of lysostaphin and lytm was compared in a pulldown assay using various cell wall preparations that were increasingly enriched in peptidoglycan . cell walls were used either crude  or subjected to an extra washing step , to sds treatment, which should remove lipid components , to tca treatment, which is thought to remove teichoic acids , or to trypsin treatment, which can be expected to remove protein components from cell walls . the pulldown assay was also carried out with “purified” peptidoglycan, which was obtained from crude cell wall preparations by a combination of the sds-, tca- and trypsin treatments , and with peptidoglycan from a commercial source  .

in all cases, lysostaphin bound to the cell wall preparations albeit with different efficiency. our results suggest that binding to crude cell walls was most effective, probably because of interactions between lysostaphin and non-peptidoglycan components of s. aureus cell walls .

in contrast, lytm185- <dig> was not efficiently pulled down by crude cell wall preparations. however, when the cell walls were subjected to a washing step prior to the pulldown experiment, lytm185- <dig> could be effectively pulled down. the effect of the washing step on the cell wall preparations is not clear. it may simply reduce clumping and make cell wall structures more accessible. alternatively it may remove a putative inhibitory factor in the unwashed cell wall sonicate. further purification of peptidoglycan had a little effect on the outcome of the pulldown experiments. therefore, we conclude that lytm185- <dig> binds directly to cell walls and interacts primarily with peptidoglycans, rather than with other cell wall components .

full length lytm  was not efficiently pulled down by any of the peptidoglycan preparations. traces of protein were detected in the pulldown fraction in some cases, but the effect was probably unspecific, because no systematic trend with increasing peptidoglycan purity was observed .

lysostaphin and lytm185- <dig> bind peptidoglycan or cell walls differently
the involvement of different regions of lysostaphin in peptidoglycan binding has been investigated earlier. the results show that lysostaphin has affinity for the pentaglycine crossbridges themselves  <cit> , but also binds cell walls via the cell wall targeting domain  <cit> . in contrast, almost nothing is known about the role of different lytm fragments in peptidoglycan binding. therefore, we investigated this question by the pulldown assay . comparing the amounts of protein in the pulldown and supernatant fractions, we found that the full length protein  did not efficiently bind to peptidoglycan. mutation of the zn2+ ligand asn <dig> to alanine, which should weaken the binding of the occluding region to the catalytic domain, did not significantly change the situation. the isolated n-terminal domain of the enzyme also failed to bind to peptidoglycan, whereas lytm185- <dig> bound efficiently. when the two zn2+ ligands his <dig> and asp <dig> were separately mutated to alanine, the binding was lost again. changing the third zn2+ ligand, his <dig> of the hxh motif to alanine, made the protein insoluble as reported earlier  <cit> , so that peptidoglycan binding could not be tested. the first histidine of the hxh motif, his <dig>  is likely to act as a general base in catalysis  <cit> . when this residue was mutated to alanine, peptidoglycan binding was reduced, but not fully abolished.

the requirement of an intact active site for peptidoglycan binding was also supported by inhibitor studies. we had previously shown that edta and  <dig> -phenanthroline blocked activity, presumably by chelating zn2+ ions. we now observed that both metal chelators also abolished binding of lytm185- <dig> to peptidoglycan . in contrast, the weak zn2+ ion chelator glycine hydroxamate and other small molecules and protease inhibitors did not interfere with peptidoglycan binding . we conclude from these experiments that the accessibility and integrity of the active site is essential for the binding of the protein to peptidoglycan .

lysostaphin and lytm185- <dig> activities depend differently on ph
peptidoglycan hydrolase activities were assayed in a turbidity clearance assay, using s. aureus cells. perhaps due to remaining peptidoglycan hydrolase activity in the cell wall, there was some decrease of turbidity also in control, in the absence of exogenously added enzyme. therefore, all apparent od values at 595 nm were expressed as percent of the control. a value close to 100% indicates a very low activity, whereas a very low od reports highly active enzyme. both lysostaphin and lytm185- <dig> were only marginally effective at ph  <dig>  , but became much more active at ph  <dig> . a further ph increase to the range between  <dig>  and  <dig>   had little effect on the activity of lysostaphin, but enhanced the activity of lytm185- <dig>  even at ph  <dig> , incubation with lytm185- <dig> lysed fewer cells than incubation with the equivalent amount of lysostaphin, particularly at late time points, possibly because of the lower stability of lytm185- <dig> .

lysostaphin and lytm185- <dig> activities depend very differently on ionic strength
investigating the ph dependence, we noticed a dramatic dependence of the lysis efficiency on the buffer. for example, the activity of lytm185- <dig> was much higher in 20 mm than in 50 mm tris–hcl , and increased further when tris was replaced with glycine at ph  <dig> . however, glycine did not seem to act as an allosteric activator, because it did not enhance the activity when it was added in the presence of other buffer substances. similar observations were made with other buffer components .

a clear pattern emerged only when lysis activities of lytm185- <dig> and lysostaphin were correlated with the conductivity of the buffers . lysostaphin degrades s. aureus cell walls inefficiently in low conductivity buffers, but becomes more efficient in buffers of higher conductivity. in contrast, lytm185- <dig> works best at low conductivity, and is almost ineffective in high conductivity buffers. the transition region for both effects is around  <dig> ms/cm, which corresponds roughly to a total ion concentration of 15–20 mm for singly charged cations and anions and typical mobilities .

conductivity reflects both ion concentration and mobility. we reasoned that ionic strength was more likely than conductivity to influence protein activity, and therefore varied conductivity systematically by changing the concentration of sodium chloride between  <dig> and 500 mm. lysostaphin and lytm185- <dig> activities were again dependent on the ionic strength in the expected manner, but conductivity was more directly correlated with ionic strength in this experiment .

the influence of ionic strength could also be demonstrated in a different way that was more directly related to the in vivo experiments. the low lytic efficiency of lysostaphin in glycine buffer could be overcome by addition of  <dig> to 100% of serum. conversely, the addition of 25% or more serum to optimal reaction conditions for lytm185- <dig>  completely abolished the activity of enzyme .

the analysis of mic and mbc for lysostaphin and lytm185- <dig> confirmed the above conclusions. the mic for lysostaphin was around  <dig> - <dig>  μg/ml, but inhibition of bacterial growth was not observed even with 5 μg/ml of lytm185- <dig>  the mbc of lysostaphin was approximately  <dig>  μg/ml in caso broth and glycine buffer in agreement with previous data  <cit> . lytm185- <dig> had an mbc around  <dig>  μg/ml in the low ionic strength glycine buffer, but did not exhibit bactericidal activity in camh or caso broth growth media which have conductivity  <dig> ms/cm.

discussion
lysostaphin treatment of s. aureus infection has been reported earlier. in a cotton rat model, s. aureus nasal colonization has been eradicated by this enzyme  <cit> . in the mouse, s. aureus systemic infections have been successfully treated  <cit>  and biofilms have been effectively eliminated from a catheterized jugular vein  <cit> . the chronic dermatitis model of staphylococcal infection reported in this paper differs significantly from the earlier models and therefore represents an independent confirmation for the efficacy of lysostaphin. the lack of efficacy of the lytm185- <dig> treatment was initially surprising in light of previously observed comparable activity of lysostaphin and lytm185- <dig>  though in experiments carried out in low salt buffers. as a result of this work, we now know that lytm185- <dig> differs from lysostaphin in several ways that could all explain the outcome of the mouse experiments.

stability
lytm185- <dig> is a very stable protein in extracts of escherichia coli, where the protein can be effectively produced recombinantly. the protein is also stable against staphylococcal proteases, just like lysostaphin. however, there are stability differences in serum and blood. this would obviously be relevant if lysostaphin or lytm were used systemically. as we are not sure to what extent the proteolytic stabilities in blood or serum reflect the situation in tissues with eczema, the influence of this factor on the overall treatment income is not clear though should not be neglected.

binding
both lysostaphin and lytm185- <dig> bind the pentaglycine crossbridges of s. aureus peptidoglycan. both proteins recognize the crossbridges themselves, probably at least in part by interactions with the active site cleft. lysostaphin has an extra cell wall targeting  domain which provides affinity. there is no counterpart in lytm , and therefore we originally expected that the n-terminal domain of the full length protein might play a similar role, especially in the light of the homology to ssaa. however, our experiments argue against this possibility, because full length lytm does not bind peptidoglycan.

modular structure
lytm185- <dig> binds purified peptidoglycan the most effectively. the opposite is true for lysostaphin, which seems to recognize other cell wall components as well. it has previously been reported that deletion of the cwt domain in lysostaphin does not interfere with the endopeptidase activity of the enzyme, but abolishes its ability to distinguish between s. aureus and s. staphylolyticus <cit> . as the peptidoglycans of the two bacterial species are identical  <cit> , it suggests the recognition of non-cell wall components by cwt. irrespective of which part of the lysostaphin protein provides the affinity to non-peptidoglycan cell walls, the ability of the protein to bind to crude cell walls is clearly helpful to lyse intact cells and seems to provide lysostaphin with an advantage as a protein drug. lytm is an autolysin, which is produced by the cell and delivered to the cell wall from “inside” while lysostaphin is a bacteriocin that approach target cells from the “outside”. in the treatment model, the approach of the peptidoglycan hydrolases to cell walls is necessarily from the outside, again favouring lysostaphin over any lytm fragment.

ionic milieu
perhaps the most crucial factor to explain the different treatment outcomes is the very different response of the two proteins to the ionic milieu. we do not know the precise ionic milieu of the contact eczema model of s. aureus infection, but suspect that it belongs to the high ionic strength regime, which would certainly apply for serum. if this is true, the ionic milieu in the mouse eczema could explain differences in treatment outcomes between lysostaphin preferring higher concentrations of salts for its activity and lytm being strongly inhibited in such environment.

CONCLUSIONS
perhaps the strongest predictor of the mouse experiments is the biology of lysostaphin and lytm. as a bacteriocin, lysostaphin is evolved for the lysis of s. aureus cell walls. in contrast, lytm as an autolysin should be evolved to have its activity under tight control. we expected this to apply for the full length enzyme, but hoped to bypass this step by the artificial activation that removes the n-terminal domain and the occluding region. apparently, this does not suffice, because there are differences at several other levels which reflect the different in vivo roles of lysostaphin and lytm. we conclude that the use of lytm185- <dig> as an antibacterial agent is a more remote possibility than originally envisaged and that efforts to develop antibacterial peptidoglycan hydrolases should perhaps be concentrated on proteins that act as bacteriocins rather than autolysins.
