BACKGROUND
one of the fundamental properties of the nervous system in all animal species is its ability to detect and interpret sensory information. most mammals use olfaction to detect the presence and quality of food, predators, competitors, and potential mates. the olfactory system of mammals evolved several subsystems in the nasal cavity, each with its own sensory organ, molecular receptors, and pathways in the brain  <cit> . the main olfactory epithelium , regarded as the site of detection for volatile odorants, harbors olfactory sensory neurons . each osn canonically expresses one gene in the large odorant receptor  gene family .

besides the moe, detection of olfactory stimuli is also accomplished by a second sensory structure in the nose, the vomeronasal organ   <cit> . the vno has been extensively implicated in the mediation of a range of instinctive responses triggered by intra- and interspecies olfactory cues  <cit> , such as male-male aggression  <cit> , mating and gender discrimination , the inhibition of juvenile-oriented sexual behavior  <cit> , female lordosis sexual behavior  <cit> , and defensive behavior towards predators  <cit> . vno sensory neurons  express receptors in the v1r  <cit>  or v2r  families of vomeronasal receptors  and in the formyl-peptide receptor family  <cit> .

here, we used a combination of next-generation sequencing, molecular biology, and histochemical analyses to show that a gene coding for a receptor in the or family is highly expressed in a defined and non-canonical subpopulation of adult vno cells, characterized by the expression of a unique set of molecular markers. we also show that cells expressing this receptor gene, though not responsive to most known intra- and interspecies vno stimuli, are activated by scents from pups. moreover, this subpopulation is robustly activated in virgin males, whereas activation is low in fathers, virgin females, and mothers. these results indicate that activity in such pup odor-responsive vno neurons is sexually dimorphic and depends on the animal’s social status, suggesting that they may mediate pup-oriented behaviors in adult mice.

RESULTS
deep sequencing and quantitative pcr reveal high level expression of olfr <dig>  an odorant receptor family gene, in the adult vno
a subset of vsns from adult mice has been shown to detect volatile odorants  <cit> , ligands usually associated with osns and or receptors in the moe  <cit> . thus, it is conceivable that some vno cells may express or receptors. to investigate the expression of ors in the adult vno, we mined illumina next-generation deep rna sequencing data from adult vno samples .

we found that seven or genes had mean fragments per kilobase of exon sequence per million fragments  values higher than  <dig>  in the vno . interestingly, only one of these genes, olfr <dig>  stands out as being expressed at much higher levels in the vno  than in the moe , where or genes are canonically expressed. the remaining six or genes are either expressed at equivalent levels in the moe and vno or have much higher expression in the moe .fig.  <dig> next generation rna sequencing and quantitative pcr reveal high and unique expression of an odorant receptor  gene in the mouse vomeronasal organ.  rna sequencing expression data for selected genes represented as mean fragments per kilobase of annotated sequence per million reads . error bars are the standard error of the mean . the first seven or genes have fpkm > <dig>  in the vomeronasal organ  library; the remaining or genes have been reported to be expressed in juveniles  <cit> . black bars represent vomeronasal receptor  genes, for comparison. expression of olfr <dig>  marked in red, stands out as high in the vno, higher in the vno than in the main olfactory epithelium , and comparable to the expression of vr genes.  adult vno libraries ;  adult moe libraries ;  juvenile libraries .  seven or genes with mean fpkm values > <dig>  in adult vno libraries, showing no difference in expression between males and females.

moreover, the expression of olfr <dig> is singularly high in the vno rna sequencing libraries, with fpkm values comparable to canonically expressed vr genes in the v1r and v2r families, such as vmn2r <dig>  and vmn1r <dig>  . olfr <dig> expression stands out as being higher than the expression of  <dig> vrs, with only  <dig> vrs expressed more abundantly . moreover, the expression of olfr <dig> is  <dig> times higher than the median vr expression and  <dig>  times greater than the mean vr expression. together, these data suggest that the expression of olfr <dig> is significantly high and appreciable in the vno.

the expression of two other or genes, olfr <dig> and olfr <dig>  is also high in the vno libraries , but these genes are known to be expressed in another chemosensory structure in the nasal cavity, the septal organ of masera , at very high levels   <cit> . because the vno libraries we used for rna sequencing were made from whole vno preparations, including not only the sensory epithelium, but also progenitor and non-neural supporting cells, underlying glandular tissue, blood vessels, and the lower part of the nasal septum  <cit> , it is possible that a limited fraction of som cells may have been included in the rna used to construct our vno libraries. this may account for the high fpkm values of some or genes in the vno, including olfr <dig> and olfr <dig> 

therefore, we performed real-time qpcr to validate the expression of or genes found in the rna seq vno libraries and to assess if they are expressed in the vomeronasal neuroepithelium . in this experiment, we analyzed the expression of each of the seven or genes, comparing a whole vno prep sample versus a finely dissected vno epithelium sample. we exercised extra caution during fine dissection of the vno to avoid contamination with som cells in the nasal septum. when a whole vno sample was under analysis, all seven most highly expressed or genes in the rna seq libraries had qpcr expression levels that matched their expression abundance in the rna sequencing experiments . in contrast, when we analyzed the expression of such genes in the finely dissected vno sample, only olfr <dig> had a significantly high relative abundance in the vno epithelium . the expression of the remaining or genes, olfr <dig>  olfr <dig>  olfr <dig> olfr <dig>  olfr <dig>  and the pseudogene olfr <dig>  was absent or very low in the vno epithelium .

together, our rna sequencing and qpcr data suggest that a few or genes, notably olfr <dig>  are expressed in the adult vno neuroepithelium.

olfr <dig> is highly and uniquely expressed in the adult vno
out of the seven or genes expressed in the vno rna seq libraries, only olfr <dig>  which is expressed at much lower levels than olfr <dig> according to the qpcr data , has been previously investigated  <cit> . its expression, along with that of a few other or genes, was reported to be almost absent in the adult vno, being virtually restricted to the young, where a small subset of or genes is expressed by few vno cells  <cit> . therefore, we decided to investigate whether the or genes identified in our adult vno rna sequencing libraries are also expressed in newborn mice. we dissected whole vnos from p <dig>  animals and pooled three to four individuals to construct libraries for rna sequencing. most receptors are expressed at reduced levels in vnos from p <dig>  animals . nonetheless, the expression levels across the whole newborn receptor repertoire are correlated with the expression levels in the adult , suggesting that the distribution observed in adults has already started to be shaped at an early stage. in newborns, we observed expression of the seven ors previously identified in adults .

notably, however, the olfr <dig> gene stands out again due to its significantly lower expression in newborns as compared to adults : for most or genes, the expression in the adult vno libraries is up to three times higher than the expression in newborns, but olfr <dig> is exceptional in that its fpkm value in the adult is  <dig> times greater than in the newborn rna seq library . these data show that the olfr <dig> gene is differentially expressed in the adult vno and suggest that this differential expression is much more prominent for this gene than for all other olfactory receptor genes expressed in the vomeronasal system.

olfr <dig> is uniquely expressed in a defined subpopulation of adult vno neurons
to investigate the spatial localization of cells expressing or genes and to confirm which of them are expressed in the vno sensory epithelium, we performed chromogenic and fluorescent in situ hybridization  experiments on cryostat vno sections, using probes specifically designed to discriminate with great accuracy among the closely related genes in the or family.

olfr <dig>  the or gene with the highest expression in the vno according to the real-time pcr experiments , had its expression consistently confirmed in the vno by ish: we found olfr692-positive staining in a defined subpopulation of cells  sparsely distributed within the neuroepithelium in sections across the anterior-posterior axis .fig.  <dig> the olfr <dig> or gene is expressed in a large subpopulation of cells in the adult mouse vomeronasal organ.  in situ hybridization  on 16-μm cryostat vno sections with a crna dig-labeled probe for olfr <dig>  chromogenic development stains a defined subpopulation of sparsely distributed cells , along the anterior-posterior vno axis, with no apparent spatial segregation .  chromogenic ish on a vno section with dig-labeled probe for olfactory marker protein , coding for omp, expressed in all vsns.  fluorescent ish on vno sections with dig-labeled probe for olfr <dig> .  fluorescent ish with dnp-labeled probe for vmn2r <dig> . see additional file 1: figure s1b–d for other v2r receptors.  quantitation of olfr692-positive cells in apical  or basal  zones of the vno .  chromogenic ish on an moe section with dig-labeled olfr <dig> probe . ep, sensory epithelium; lu, vomeronasal organ lumen; ns, non-sensory tissue and blood vessels. scale bars represent 100 μm. blue labeling indicates to-pro- <dig> nuclear staining. see also results with control or probes in additional file 1: figure s1a



in vnos from adult mice above the age of 3 months, we found  <dig>  ±  <dig>  olfr692-positive cells per histological section . moreover, the number of cells expressing olfr <dig> is equivalent to or higher than that of canonical vrs. for example, when we used a probe that specifically recognizes vmn2r <dig>  a member of the v2r vr gene family, we found  <dig>  ±  <dig>  vmn2r118-positive cells per section . similar results were obtained with probes based on other vr genes . together, these data show that the olfr <dig> gene in the or family, though non-canonically expressed in the vno, is robustly expressed in this sensory organ, an expression on average comparable to or higher than the expression of its vr genes.

in terms of spatial distribution, olfr692-positive cells are concentrated in the basal layer of the vno , which is characterized by the expression of v2r family receptors and the associated gαo subunit of heterotrimeric g protein  <cit> . though sparsely distributed across the epithelium , olfr692-positive vno cells are more densely packed than in the moe, where this or gene is expressed in the epithelium’s zone ii .

in contrast, olfr <dig>  the gene with the second highest expression level in our qpcr analysis , is expressed in only  <dig>  ±  <dig>  vno cells per section , a much more limited pattern of expression in comparison with olfr <dig> . this is in keeping with the low reported expression of this or gene in the adult vno  <cit> . moreover, olfr <dig> expression is concentrated in the apical portion of the chemosensory epithelium , in agreement with its previously described co-expression with the g protein gαi <dig> subunit, a known marker of the vno apical region  <cit> . expression of olfr <dig> is also limited to a few cells per section , consistent with its low expression level in both rna sequencing and qpcr experiments . expression of olfr <dig> and olfr <dig>  or genes with the first and third highest mean fpkm values in our vno libraries but no detectable expression in the purified vomeronasal epithelium by qpcr , was not found in the vomeronasal epithelium by ish , even though the same probes detect an extensive amount of cells in the moe . in agreement with previous reports  <cit> , expression of olfr <dig> and olfr <dig> is robust in the som . together, these data indicate that the expression of both or genes is absent in the vno and that their presence in the vno rna sequencing libraries was probably due to a small number of som cells included in the whole vno rna preparations.

our transcriptomic and histological results show that just one out of all or genes, olfr <dig>  is expressed in a large number of chemosensory cells in the sensory epithelium of the adult mouse vno, a robust expression comparable to that of other vr genes at the same age.

temporal pattern of olfr <dig> expression in the mouse vno
ish experiments performed on vno sections from mice at different ages showed that the olfr <dig> gene is expressed in a very small subpopulation of cells in juvenile mice at ages p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  and in young adult mice at p <dig> . in contrast, the expression increases substantially in older adult animals . such pattern of expression is in striking opposition to the temporal expression of the few other or genes previously studied in the vno, which have higher expression levels in juveniles  and very low expression in adults  <cit> . the expression dynamics of olfr <dig> is also distinct from v2r vr genes, which are first observed at embryonic stage e <dig>  <cit>  and are maintained at high levels throughout postnatal development .fig.  <dig> 
olfr <dig> is expressed in a developmentally regulated manner, with maximum expression in adults older than 2 months.  chromogenic in situ hybridization to investigate the temporal pattern of olfr <dig> expression in the vno during postnatal development . at each age, images are representative from a set of  <dig> sections, from four individuals.  temporal expression of v2r receptors in subclade a <dig> , investigated with probe for receptor gene vmn2r <dig>  and subclade a <dig> , investigated with probe for vmn2r <dig> . lu, vno lumen; spt, nasal septum. scale bars represent 100 μm; panels without scale bars have the same magnification as the top rightmost panel. blue labeling indicates dapi nuclear staining



together, these data point to olfr <dig> as an or gene expressed in the vno epithelium in a developmentally regulated manner, with robust expression in adults older than 2 months, suggesting that it may be functionally relevant in individuals at that age.

molecular characterization of olfr692-positive cells in the vno
the ectopic expression of olfr <dig> in the vno may have one of several meanings:  vno olfr692-positive cells may represent neurons with the typical molecular phenotype of canonical or-expressing cells in the moe  but mis-localized to the vno;  vno olfr692-positive cells may be regular vsns, expressing all the typical molecular markers of such chemosensory cell type, but with the aberrant  expression of an or gene;  olfr692-expressing cells may represent a completely novel subpopulation of sensory cells in the vno, with its own unique molecular phenotype. in order to discriminate between these possibilities, we set out to molecularly characterize the cells that express or genes in the adult vno by double fluorescent ish with cell type-specific markers.

osns, but not vsns, express the olfactory gαolf g protein subunit  <cit> , thought to couple with adenylyl cyclase subtype iii and promote the opening of a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel . cnga is composed of several subunits, one of which, cnga <dig>  is characteristic of osns  <cit> .

in contrast, vsns in the apical zone of the vno express v1r family receptors, the g protein gαi <dig> subunit and the transient receptor potential family member c <dig>  ion channel. each vsn in the basal zone expresses one member in clades a, b or d of v2r receptors combined with the expression of clade c v2rs, along with the g protein gαo subunit and trpc2; some basal zone neurons also express mhc class i h2-mv family molecules  <cit> .

we found that olfr692-positive cells in the vno co-express the trpc <dig> ion channel . trpc <dig> is also expressed in a restricted subset of molecularly atypical osns  <cit> , but these do not express olfr <dig> , supporting the notion that olfr692-positive cells in the adult vno and moe are molecularly different. moreover, we found no evidence of cnga <dig> and gαolf expression in the vno, though both are abundant in the moe . together, these data show that vno cells expressing olfr <dig> are not merely misplaced osns, because they do not express the full complement of osn markers.fig.  <dig> 
olfr692-positive cells co-express trpc <dig> and are located in the basal layer of the vomeronasal organ.  vno sections subjected to double fluorescent in situ hybridization  showing co-expression of olfr <dig>  and trpc <dig> , coding for an ion channel characteristically expressed in vomeronasal neurons .  double fluorescent ish to evaluate expression of genes for g protein subunits gαo , a basal vno zone marker, or gαi <dig> , an apical zone marker, in olfr692-expressing vno cells. number of imaged sections and quantification of co-labeling counts are summarized in additional file 10: table s <dig>  lu, vno lumen. scale bars represent 100 μm and are the same as in the left top panel, except in b. nuclear to-pro- <dig> labeling is light red in d and blue elsewhere



we found that olfr692-positive vomeronasal cells express gαo, but not gαi <dig> , consistent with their position in the basal layer of the vno. it is important to note that such data are to be taken only as part of a molecular characterization of olfr692-expressing vno cells, not necessarily implying that the corresponding or receptor couples with gαo.

since olfr692-expressing cells are located in the basal zone of the vno, we sought to determine whether they co-express genes for vrs in the v2r family, which are known to be restricted to the basal layer  <cit> . if we found evidence for co-expression with v2rs in these cells, it could in principle suggest that they are canonical vsns with aberrant expression of one or gene. in double ish experiments, we found no substantial overlap between olfr <dig> and staining with probes designed to subclades a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  b, and d of v2r receptors , which represent >98 % of all v2r receptors expressed singularly in basal zone vsns  <cit>  . these results strongly argue against the hypothesis that olfr692-expressing vno cells are canonical vsns with aberrant or expression.

basal layer vsns also express v2r receptors in clade c, which are combinatorially co-expressed with clade a/b/d receptors  <cit> . we identified a clear co-localization of olfr <dig> with vmn2r <dig> and partial co-localization with vmn2r <dig> , which are the two clade c members most widely expressed in the vno  <cit> . interestingly, we observed no or little overlap between the expression of olfr <dig> and members of the h2-mv family of non-classical class i mhc molecules , which are expressed in a large number of basal zone vsns  <cit> .

taken together, the experiments above show that olfr <dig> is expressed in a subset of basal vno zone cells that are neither canonical vsns nor misplaced osns. instead, they co-express a unique set of molecular features  that suggests they represent a distinct and novel subpopulation of chemosensory cells in the adult mouse vomeronasal system.

investigation of activity in olfr <dig> cells after exposure to various odorous stimuli
to identify a source of ligands able to activate olfr692-expressing cells, we first exposed adult animals to biologically relevant stimuli and then labeled the activated neurons on vno sections by double ish with probes for olfr <dig> and for the surrogate marker of vno neuronal activation egr <dig>  <cit> .

exposure of adult c57bl/ <dig> animals to heterospecific stimuli  resulted in no activation in olfr692-positive cells , even when these stimuli were used at high quantities, sufficient to activate the vno maximally ; likewise, no activity was seen upon exposure to adult male and female conspecific odors , nor to purified aliphatic acid odorants known to be detected by or receptors similar to olfr <dig>  <cit>  .fig.  <dig> 
olfr <dig> cells are not activated by predator odors nor by same- or opposite-sex conspecific individuals. double fluorescent in situ hybridization for the marker of vomeronasal neuron activation egr <dig>  and olfr <dig>  in animals exposed to a range of biologically relevant stimuli:  adult male c57bl/ <dig> mice exposed to heterospecific stimuli from cat  or snake , which have been shown to robustly activate the vno  <cit>  and to elicit defensive behaviors  <cit> . insets are higher magnification images of the corresponding panels to evidence absence of co-expression of egr <dig> and olfr <dig>   adult c57bl/ <dig> mice exposed to same-strain male or female adult mouse odors.  in female mice exposed to scented bedding containing male odors and in male mice exposed to the odors of  female or  male adult mice, a number of vno cells are activated, but none overlap with the expression of olfr <dig>   in female c57bl/ <dig> mice exposed to female odors, activated cells are virtually absent in the vno.  control animal exposed to unscented bedding. similar results are obtained upon exposure to clean gauze. microscopy images are representative from the set of scored sections indicated in additional file 7: table s <dig>  see quantification of egr1/olfr <dig> co-labeling counts in additional file 7: table s <dig>  lu, vno lumen. scale bars represent 100 μm. nuclear staining is to-pro- <dig> labeling 



additionally, we conducted a comprehensive in vitro screening among a variety of  <dig> organic candidate olfr <dig> ligands . nine chemicals generated responses that were initially suggestive of receptor-mediated activation in olfr692-expressing hana3a heterologous cells , but on further investigation we found no evidence of statistically significant dose–dependent responses .

these experiments suggest that the function of olfr692-expressing cells may not be related to the generation of known vno-mediated defensive, sexual, or territorial behaviors .

olfr692-expressing cells are activated by pup odors
pup odors have recently been shown to activate vomeronasal neurons in vivo  <cit> , possibly mediating behaviors towards the young. since olfr <dig> is expressed at very low levels during development and infancy but possesses robust expression in adults above the age of 2 months, we hypothesized that the olfr <dig> cells may mediate chemical communication between juveniles and adults.

we assayed the activation of olfr <dig> cells in adult c57bl/ <dig> mice exposed to pup odors, in several behavioral contexts; each exposure was to one or two c57bl/ <dig> same-strain juvenile mice , for 45 min. because father and mother mice are constantly exposed to pup odors, they could show desensitization of osns tuned to detect juvenile stimuli. therefore, we first exposed virgin  adults to alien juveniles. strikingly, when sexually naive  adult males were exposed to same-strain  pups , they showed a very robust activation of olfr692-positive vno cells . in striking contrast, when nulliparous  females were exposed to same-strain juveniles of either sex, virtually no olfr692-positive vno cells were activated , even though the females actively investigated the juvenile subjects . importantly, the number of olfr692-expressing cells in wild-type c57bl/ <dig> mice is equivalent in virgin males  and virgin females  . together, these data show that vno cells that express olfr <dig> are activated differently in males and females.fig.  <dig> 
olfr <dig> cells are activated by juvenile odors in a sexually dimorphic manner and depending on the individual’s social status.  double fluorescent in situ hybridization for receptor gene olfr <dig>  and immediate-early gene egr <dig> , marker of vomeronasal neuron activation, in adult c57bl/ <dig> virgin males , virgin females , parenting fathers  and mothers , exposed to same-strain pup. for h and j, exposure was to alien pups. insets in b show higher magnification images of activity in olfr <dig> cells in virgin males. virgin males, virgin females, fathers and mothers were also exposed to control odors . lactating female c57bl/ <dig> mice  or milk extracted from lactating females  activate the vno of adult male mice , as compared to control non-exposed animals . however, activated cells do not express olfr <dig> .  egr <dig> expression  shows that recombinantly expressed esp <dig> juvenile peptidic pheromone does not activate olfr <dig> cells  in adult c57bl/ <dig> males ; exposure to mbp, the purification label for esp <dig>  does not activate the vno .  quantification of labeled cells in experiments shown in a–h. left panel: percentage of olfr <dig> labeled cells per section that are also egr1-positive . middle panel: number of egr1/olfr <dig> doubly labeled cells per vno section . right panel: total number of olfr692-positive cells per vno section . microscopy images are representative from the set of scored sections indicated in additional file 7: table s <dig>  quantification of activation in all experiments is detailed in additional file 7: table s <dig>  lu, vno lumen. scale bar = 100 μm. in graphs, mean ± sem

fig.  <dig> activation of olfr <dig> cells in the vno of virgin male mice correlates with pup-directed aggressive behavior.  juvenile-oriented aggressive behavior  and parental care behavior  exhibited by virgin females, virgin males, parenting males , and parenting females  of wild-type  c57bl/ <dig> strain, showing pup-directed aggression in naive males . in the absence of a functional vno , infanticidal behavior is impaired and the expression of parental care  is similar to that exhibited by mothers. bars with black outlines represent individuals exposed to alien pups; gray outlines indicate exposure to self-pups. investigative behavior is also shown . ‘0’ indicates no episodes of the measured behavior.  number of animals which exhibited at least one episode of the measured behavior  in wild-type  c57bl/ <dig> or trpc2-/- animals. ‘1/9’ indicates that one animal displayed the behavior in a sample of n =  <dig>   olfr <dig> cells are rarer in the vno of trpc2-/- mice and are not activated by juvenile odors . lu, vno lumen. scale bar = 100 μm. in graphs, mean ± sem



to ensure that the activation seen in males exposed to alien pups is not due to odors derived from the pup’s mothers, we exposed c57bl/ <dig> male mice to lactating females or to scented bedding of lactating females. we observed only a very limited number of cells activated in the vno, and these showed very little overlap with the expression of olfr <dig> . similarly, although we observed a small subpopulation of cells in adult males activated by milk extracted from lactating females, these cells do not overlap with those expressing olfr <dig> .

moreover, to ensure that activation in olfr <dig> cells is not due to odors released by the pup as a consequence of its interaction with the adult male, nor due to chemosignals detected by the adult during the act of biting the pup , we exposed male adults to ligands washed off the pups  and to pups placed inside a plastic capsule bearing 4-mm wide holes, which allowed the adult to approach the pup without being able to bite it. in both cases, we observed robust activity in olfr <dig> vno neurons . these data prove that aggressive pup-adult physical interaction is not needed for the pup-emanating odors to activate olfr <dig> cells in the adult vno .

together, we confirm that the vno is capable of detecting odors from young conspecific individuals  <cit> , and show that the olfr692-expressing neural subpopulation is involved in this detection process. even though the olfr <dig> neurons are numerically equivalent in both sexes, their response to pup odors is sexually dimorphic. this is, to our knowledge, the first documented case of sexual dimorphism in the activity of a mammalian chemosensory subpopulation expressing a defined receptor.

activation of olfr692-expressing cells depends on the animal’s social status
a number of pup-oriented behaviors may be triggered by the vno. a recent study has shown that the vno mediates the inhibition of adult sexual behavior towards pups via detection of the esp <dig> peptide, secreted by the lacrimal gland of juveniles  <cit> . however, we did not detect activation of the olfr692-positive vno population in adult animals after exposure to the recombinant version of esp <dig> swabbed onto a juvenile from the c3h strain  .

other studies reported that the vno is required for parental behaviors  <cit> . when we exposed parenting males  to c57bl/ <dig> alien pups , we observed very little activation of olfr692-expressing cells , in contrast to the robust percentage of activated olfr <dig> cells  observed in virgin, sexually naive male individuals . even though activity is distinct between virgin and parenting males, the number of olfr <dig> cells in fathers  is similar to that seen in virgin males . strikingly, these results suggest that the activity in the adult vno olfr <dig> population is dependent on the animal’s social/parenting status.

in mothers, the overall number of activated cells in the vno when animals were exposed to alien pups was appreciable , but the overlap with the expression of olfr <dig> was very small . interestingly, we found more olfr692-positive cells in mothers than in males or virgin females .

finally, we investigated possible behavioral consequences of olfr692-expressing cell activation in the vno. we found that the high activity in olfr <dig> cells in virgin males is positively correlated with the display of extremely potent aggressive behavior and absence of pup-retrieval parenting behavior towards alien juveniles . in contrast, females and parenting males, in which activation of olfr <dig> cells is low, do not exhibit aggressive bouts to alien pups . the correlation between high activity in olfr692-positive vno cells and the display of pup-oriented aggression together with absence of pup-directed care suggests that such sensory population may be involved in mediating parental behaviors. this possibility would be further strengthened by the observation that mice without a functional vno show impairment in these behaviors. in fact, in our paradigm, we observed changes in pup-directed behaviors, such as impaired pup-directed aggression and more pup retrieval parenting behavior, in animals with genetic ablation of the vno by a null mutation in the trpc <dig> gene . additionally, we saw no activation of olfr692-expressing vno neurons in trpc2-/- sexually naive adult males exposed to wild-type alien pups , in contrast to the robust activity seen in wild-type adult males . similar behavioral results were obtained by groups working with sexually naive males subjected to surgical removal of the vno  <cit>  or with vno genetic ablation  <cit> .

together, our data show that olfr692-positive cells are highly activated by pup odors in infanticidal virgin wild-type males, while activity and behavior are lost when the vno is held non-functional by genetic ablation. we hypothesize that the pup odor-responsive sensory population expressing the olfr <dig> gene mediates pup-oriented behaviors like infanticidal aggression or parental care. in the future, further experiments on olfr692-/- knockout mice will allow us to test this hypothesis.

discussion
in this paper, we describe an atypical subpopulation of neurons in the vno, one of the olfactory sensory structures, that expresses a specific gene in the or family, olfr <dig>  we found an extensive number of olfr692-positive cells in vnos from adult mice, but expression is virtually absent in juveniles . this expression pattern is distinct from those of vr genes, which are first expressed in embryos  <cit> , and is also different from the few ors reported in the vno, which are mostly expressed in juveniles  <cit> . moreover, olfr692-expressing cells are gαolf/cnga-negative, trpc2/gαo-positive, and located in the basal zone of the vno. the robust expression of olfr <dig> in the adult vno and co-expression with specific molecular markers suggest that the vno sensory population expressing such gene is distinct from previously described vsn categories.

olfr <dig> is, to our knowledge, the first or gene shown to be expressed almost exclusively in adults, suggesting a critical role at this stage in the life cycle. interestingly, olfr <dig> is differentially expressed between the two main olfactory sensory organs, having a very low expression level in the moe, but a surprisingly high expression level in the vno , suggesting that the olfr692-expressing population modulates instinctive behaviors mediated by the vno.

which stimuli activate the olfr692-expressing vno population? known vomeronasal ligands include urine-derived small organic molecules  <cit> , sulfated steroids  <cit> , mhc peptides  <cit> , esp peptides  <cit> , and conspecific or heterospecific small proteins  <cit> . moreover, a fraction of vno neurons respond to small organic volatile odorants in vitro  <cit> . it is possible that such detection may involve the cells expressing olfr <dig>  since the or family is traditionally associated with the detection of volatile odorants.

in this paper, we have evaluated the activation of the olfr692-positive vno population after exposure of animal subjects to biologically relevant odor sources. we show that olfr692-positive cells in the adult vno are activated by pup odors . strikingly, this activation is sexually dimorphic: even though the number of olfr692-positive cells is equivalent in males and females, the number of activated cells in virgin females is very low, while virgin males exhibit robust activation of olfr692-positive cells after exposure to pups . this is the first reported case of sexual dimorphism in activity of a sensory population expressing a specific olfactory receptor in mammals.

additionally, we show that mothers and fathers have surprisingly low activation of olfr692-expressing neurons overall, even though cells expressing this receptor are present in equivalent numbers in virgin and parenting individuals . in comparison with the large number of active cells seen in virgin males, these results indicate that activity depends on the animal’s social and parenting status, probably modulated at the sensory interface by the individual’s internal hormonal state. a similar phenomenon was recently observed for another subgroup of vsns, involved in detecting odors from opposite sex individuals, which was reported to be modulated by steroid hormones in mice  <cit> .

which behaviors might be mediated by the olfr692-expressing population? the vno mediates a range of instinctive behaviors, including individual identity recognition  <cit> , aggression  <cit> , and interspecies communication  <cit> . since olfr <dig> is expressed differentially between juveniles and adults, it is conceivable that it mediates adult-specific behaviors. we did not find evidence of involvement in sexual behaviors ; instead, we suggest that olfr692-expressing cells mediate adult behaviors towards the young.

we found robust activation of olfr692-positive vno cells in sexually naive male adults exposed to alien pups , a context in which strong aggressive behavior is displayed towards juveniles . interestingly, little discernible activation of olfr <dig> cells is found in virgin females exposed to alien pups or in mothers and fathers , where aggression is not present . the possibility that olfr692-positive vomeronasal neurons are involved in aggressive behavior towards pups finds support in previous data showing that the vno detects juvenile odors and mediates infanticidal behavior  <cit> . infanticide has been documented in virgin male mice of many strains, including c57bl/ <dig>   <cit> , and this phenomenon has been suggested to be adaptive because survival of a male’s own biological offspring at the expense of alien, potentially competing, offspring is evolutionarily beneficial.

alternatively, olfr692-expressing vno neurons might mediate the inhibition of parenting behaviors in virgin males. interestingly, males with surgical or genetic ablation of the vno exhibit significantly more episodes of pup retrieval, pup grooming and nest building than control animals  <cit> .

because we observed robust activity in olfr692-positive neurons in non-fathers but very low activity in parenting fathers , a third possibility is that the olfr692-expressing neurons mediate the interplay between aggressive and parental behaviors; this model concurs with the observation that aggressive c57bl/ <dig> virgin males exhibit a switch to parenting behaviors after sexual experience, even towards alien pups  <cit> . such behavioral switch has been hypothesized to be mediated by olfaction  <cit> . moreover, manipulation of activity in neurons in the medial preoptic area or the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis in the brain, which receive functional inputs from the vno, has been shown to lead to a switch between aggressive and parenting behaviors in males and females  <cit> .

further investigation on knockout mice carrying null mutations in the olfr <dig> gene will be important to provide evidence that the olfr <dig> receptor detects pup odors, and to elucidate the nature of the behavior mediated by the olfr692-expressing sensory neurons.

CONCLUSIONS
most animal species use olfaction to appropriately perceive and respond to the external world. among the many detected odors are those able to elicit instinctive behaviors, such as pheromones. knowledge on the mechanisms animals use to sense such cues is key to understanding animal behavior, population dynamics, life cycle, natural history, and evolution. here, we described a non-canonical subgroup of osns, located in the specialized vno. these neurons unusually express a receptor gene in the or family, which is typically found in another olfactory structure in the nose, the main olfactory epithelium. these cells seem to be non-canonical because they express a unique complement of molecular markers. importantly, we found that pup odors activate these neurons. moreover, activation is sexually dimorphic, because it is seen only in adult males exposed to pups, a rare case of sex difference in olfactory organ activation. strikingly, activity also depends on the animal’s social and parenting status: robust activity is seen only in virgin adult males exposed to pups, a situation in which potent aggressive  behavior is triggered, and not in parenting adults.

we anticipate that our findings will shed light onto some outstanding questions in sensory biology, including the molecular details of how pup-derived odors are recognized by specific receptors to trigger instinctive responses in adults. although the involvement of olfaction and the vomeronasal system in parental behaviors has been previously suggested, no specific population of pup-detecting olfactory cells had been identified, a gap of knowledge that is now filled by the present study. once the participation of the olfr <dig> population in the regulation  of pup-oriented behaviors in adults is established, pup-derived olfactory cues purified based on our work will be important to better study this behavioral phenomenon. how do the or-expressing cells mediate the interplay between parental and infanticide behaviors? why is infanticide common in so many animal species? how important is olfaction in the generation of such responses? our findings may fuel future research to understand the molecular and neural mechanisms behind these questions.
