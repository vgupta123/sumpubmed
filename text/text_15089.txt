BACKGROUND
glycogen synthase kinase  <dig>  encodes a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase, which is ubiquitously expressed in organisms ranging from yeasts to mammals  <cit> . gsk <dig> is, therefore, very important in the cellular signaling network. in addition to playing pivotal roles in the canonical wnt and pi3k-pkb/akt pathways, it has been shown to phosphorylate glycogen synthase, elf2b, nfat, c-jun, cyclind <dig>  nf-kb, as well as many others  <cit> . gsk <dig> is involved in many biological processes, including cell survival, tumorigenesis, and developmental patterning.

there are two closely related gsk <dig> isoforms encoded by distinct genes: gsk3α  and gsk3β   <cit> . the difference in size is due to a glycine-rich extension at the n-terminus of gsk3α. gsk3α and gsk3β are highly homologous within their kinase domains  <cit> . homologues of gsk <dig> isoforms from species as distant from each other as flies, zebrafishes and humans display over 90% sequence similarity within the kinase domain  <cit> .

despite that gsk3α and gsk3β share common substrates, their expression patterns, substrate preferences, regulation, and cellular functions are not identical  <cit> . in vitro study reveals that gsk3α and gsk3β are inactivated by phosphorylation of a specific n-terminal serine residue  catalyzed by either mapkap kinase-1/or p70s6k  <cit> , whereas protein kinase c phosphorylates and partially inhibits gsk3β, but not gsk3α  <cit> . in humans, only gsk3α is deactivated by insulin during physiological conditions  <cit> , whereas supraphysiological insulin injection in the rat leads to deactivation of both gsk3α and gsk3β  <cit> . although differential regulations by the two isoforms of gsk <dig> were proposed, the exact roles of gsk3α and gsk3β and endogenous targets of such regulation remain to be investigated.

several groups have identified small-molecule gsk <dig> inhibitors  <cit> . most drugs bind to the atp pocket of gsk <dig> and compete with atp. however, these inhibitors are not only inhibiting gsk <dig>  but are also affecting cdk kinase  and many other kinases. in addition, there appears to be only a single amino acid difference , making it difficult to identify an inhibitor that can be selective against gsk3α or gsk3β  <cit> . this finding is why it is difficult to analyze the exact roles of gsk3α and gsk3β in vitro and in vivo.

recent years, numerous studies indicate that gsk <dig> negatively regulates cardiac hypertrophy  <cit> . despite that gsk3β functions as a negative regulator of cardiac hypertrophy, gsk <dig> also plays an important role in regulating cardiac development. transgenic mice over-expressing gsk3β in the heart have impairments of postnatal cardiomyocyte growth and abnormal cardiac contractile function  <cit> . in xenopus, injection of gsk3β mrna in embryos induces expression of nkx <dig>  and tbx <dig>  <cit> . oral treatment with lithium, a mood-stabilizing drug that is inhibitory for gsk <dig>  in pregnant women showed a higher incidence of congenital heart defects in babies  <cit> . these findings prove that gsk <dig> might be involved in heart development. unfortunately, disruption of the gsk3β gene in mice results in embryonic lethality caused by severe liver degeneration  <cit> , and no report is available to demonstrate that cardiac defects are happened in gsk3β mutants. thus, whether the roles of gsk3α and gsk3β in different species are conserved remain to be investigated. moreover, the roles of gsk <dig> in cardiac development are still unclear. also, whether gsk3α and gsk3β play similar roles in heart development is ambiguous.

we have previously identified two zebrafish homologues related to mammalian gsk3: zebrafish gsk3α and gsk3β  <cit> . in this report, we have taken advantage of the zebrafish system to address the distinct roles of gsk3α and gsk3β during heart development of zebrafish. our findings suggest that, in zebrafish, gsk3α, but not gsk3β, is necessary in cardiomyocyte survival; whereas the gsk3β isoform plays important roles during zebrafish cardiogenesis, modulating the left-right asymmetry and affecting heart positioning.

RESULTS
knockdown of gsk3α and gsk3β display similar heart defects in the embryos
to address the role of gsk <dig> during zebrafish cardiogenesis, we designed gsk3α- and gsk3β-mo for specifically inhibiting the translation of gsk3α and gsk3β, respectively. when the protein lysate was extracted from gsk3α – and gsk3β-mo-injected embryos at  <dig> hours postfertilization , western blot analysis was performed by using isoform-specific antibodies. results showed that the protein levels of gsk3α and gsk3β were largely reduced in the protein extracts from gsk3α – and gsk3β -morphants, respectively , suggesting that the mos we designed in this study were isoform-specific.

similar morphological defects of the heart were observed in gsk3α- and gsk3β-mo-injected zebrafish embryos at  <dig> hpf, such as a thin and string-like shape, pericardial edema, and blood pooling . these defects occurred initially in some  <dig> days postfertilization  morphants, and then were predominantly observed in most 3- and 4-dpf morphants. although the heart defects were similar between gsk3α- and gsk3β-mo-injected zebrafish embryos, the defects of the gsk3α morphants were more severe than those of the gsk3β morphants . around 40% of the gsk3α morphant defects were lethal due to an absent body axis during  <dig> hpf , and the remainder of the surviving gsk3α morphants suffered from an incomplete formation of axis , suggesting that gsk3α and gsk3β may function differently during cardiogenesis, although they cause similar heart defects. we also noticed that the percentage of heart abnormalities was dependent on the concentration of the injected gsk3α- and gsk3β-mo . when  <dig>  ng of gsk3α-mo was injected into 1-celled stage embryos, we found that  <dig> %  of embryos displayed a string-like-shape heart; whereas when  <dig> ng gsk3α-mo were injected,  <dig> %  of embryos appeared similar heart defect. similarly,  <dig> ng gsk3β-mo caused  <dig> %  of embryos to suffer a string-like-shape heart at  <dig> hpf; whereas  <dig> ng gsk3β-mo caused  <dig> %  of embryos to have similar heart defect. these results indicated that the effect of gsk3-mo on embryogenesis was dosage-dependent and specific.

fertilized eggs were injected at the 1-cell stage, and then gsk3α morphants were observed at  <dig> to  <dig> hpf; gsk3β morphants were observed the heart positioning at  <dig> to  <dig> hpf. results are from three independent experiments. dsred mrna: served as a negative control.

heart defects caused by gsk3α- and gsk3β-mo are induced differently
we investigated whether the mo-induced defects could be rescued by co-injecting synthetic gsk3α or gsk3β-mrna with its corresponding mos, and vice versa. results showed that co-injection of gsk3α-mo with synthetic gsk3α-mrna could effectively rescue the defects caused by the injection of gsk3α-mo alone . similarly, the gsk3β-mo-induced defects were rescued by injection of gsk3β-mrna. however, the synthetic gsk3α-mrna did not rescue the gsk3β-mo-induced phenotype, and vice versa . this evidence clearly demonstrates that two isoforms of gsk <dig> are necessary for heart development, but the function of gsk3α and gsk3β is not redundant, suggesting that gsk3α and gsk3β play specific roles in cardiogenesis during zebrafish development.

we injected either gsk3α- or gsk3β-mo into embryos derived from the transgenic line tg, in which the gfp is expressed specifically in heart, resulting in a good material to monitor cardiac development of zebrafish  <cit> . in the wild-type embryos, the heart precursor cells completed their in situ formation, elongated, and jogged to the left at  <dig> hpf; started looping at  <dig> hpf; and completed looping at  <dig> hpf  <cit> . however, we observed that heart development was retarded, failing to elongate at  <dig> hpf  and even ceasing at heart-cone stage without further morphogenesis to a heart tube at  <cit>  hpf  in the gsk3α-mo-injected embryos. we observed defective hearts as stretched to a thin and string-like shape at  <dig> hpf . nevertheless, unlike in gsk3α morphants, elongation of the heart tube in gsk3β morphants at  <dig> hpf was as normal as in wild-type zebrafish , but heart looping was incomplete from  <dig> to  <dig> hpf , resulting in a stretched heart at  <dig> hpf .

in addition, we have designed to an experiment for using a standard negative control morpolino  injection: 5'-cctcttacctcagttacaatttata-3' . this oligo has no target, no significant biological activity. after  <dig> and  <dig> ng of this control mo were injected, no any defects were observed at  <dig> hpf. the morphology and development of heart appeared normally . these results reveal that the defects induced by the gsk3α- and gsk3β-mo are specific in this study.

effect of gsk <dig> on the number of cardiomyocytes is isoform-specific
compared to that of wild-type and gsk3β morphants, the gfp signals in cardiomyocytes of gsk3α morphants were greatly reduced . to investigate whether the reduced gsk3α level affects the cardiomyocyte number, we used a cardiomyocyte marker, cardiac myosin light chain  <dig> , to detect cells at heart-field and heart-cone stages. we found that the number of cmlc2-positive cells was greatly reduced in gsk3α morphants at both heart-field and heart-cone stages , indicating that the cardiomyocyte number was greatly reduced in the gsk3α morphants. these results suggest that the retarded heart development in gsk3α morphants is due to the decreased number of cardiomyocytes during early cardiogenesis. in contrast, gsk3β morphants displayed normal cmlc <dig> staining , indicating that cardiomyocyte number remains unchanged in gsk3β morphants. these results also clearly demonstrate that gsk3α and gsk3β play distinct roles during cardiogenesis.

apoptosis occurs in the head of gsk3α knockdown embryos
the pronounced degeneration in the head of gsk3α morphants at  <cit>  hpf were also observed . to confirm whether the reduced cardiomyocyte number in gsk3α morphants was due to apoptosis, the embryos were analyzed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dutp nick end labeling  assay after mo injection. in wild-type embryos at  <dig> hpf, apoptosis was low . however, in gsk3α morphants at the same stage, apoptosis was pronounced throughout the axis, especially in the head  but was limited in the head of controls  and gsk3β morphants . moreover, in gsk3a-morphants, the gfp signal was very faint at  <dig> hpf . the apoptotic signals were co-localized with the heart-specific gfp signal, indicating that the reduced cardiomyocyte numbers was due to apoptosis in heart . taken together, the heart defects in gsk3α morphants was due to the reduced number of cardiomyocytes, which results from apoptosis in the head.

gsk3β, but not gsk3α, is involved in the cardiac positioning
although the heart of gsk3β-mo-injected embryos eventually becomes a string-like shape, we found that the cardiomyocyte development was not affected in the gsk3β morphants during early cardiac development, suggesting that gsk3β may play a unique role in cardiac morphogenesis. whole-mount in situ hybridization of the cmlc <dig> probe at  <dig> hpf, outlining cardiac looping, was marked by a rightward bending in the ventricle in wild-type embryos . however, no looping was observed in gsk3β morphants . upon detailed analysis of the early  and late  stages of cardiac positioning in the gsk3β morphant heart , we found that heart positioning was severely disrupted in gsk3β morphants and that the extent of the defect was proportional to the amount of gsk3β-mo we injected. the majority of gsk3β morphant hearts failed to jog . moreover, this defect was frequently accompanied by no looping  or l-looping  of the heart tube, compared to wild-type, which has correct left-jogging  and d-looping . these results indicate that knockdown of gsk3β resulted in a severe disruption of jogging and looping of cardiac positioning. however, we found that the ventricle-specific marker vmhc and the atrium-specific marker amhc were normally transcribed in gsk3β morphants , suggesting that gsk3β might not affect the chamber-specific pattern of gene expression, although normal heart looping was not completed. we also noted that the heart positioning in gsk3α morphants was delayed but that correct jogging  and looping  were observed at  <cit>  hpf, indicating that gsk3α was not involved in heart positioning.

gsk3α morphants were analyzed for heart positioning at  <dig> to  <dig> hpf; gsk3β morphants were analyzed for heart positioning at  <dig> to  <dig> hpf.

gsk3β mediates bmp <dig> and lefty- <dig> in cardiac positioning and is required for left-right patterning
cardiac bmp <dig> is an integral component involved in the asymmetric signaling pathway and interprets left-right information for the zebrafish embryo heart  <cit> . the bmp <dig> transcripts became markedly asymmetric, with far more on the left side than on the right side of the heart ring at  <dig> hpf , just before jogging. this left-predominant asymmetry persists through the stages of jogging . however, the pattern of bmp <dig> expression in gsk3β morphants was symmetrical before jogging  and ectopic around the heart-tube stage at  <dig> hpf, thereby disrupting the pattern of left-predominant asymmetry . moreover, another asymmetric marker, lefty- <dig>  <cit> , lost its expression domain in the left side of the midline in gsk3β morphants . we propose that gsk3β mediates bmp <dig> and lefty- <dig> in cardiac positioning.

gsk3β modulates valve formation and heart position through wnt/β-catenin signaling
many morphological defects of heart were found in the gsk3β-mo-injected zebrafish embryos. moreover, when we used the valve markers bmp <dig> and versican to detect the gsk3β-mo-injected embryos at 60– <dig> hpf, we found that these valve markers were markedly up-regulated in the heart , suggesting that gsk3β might also be involved in the formation of cardiac valves. thus, we used a two-photon fluorescence image to directly observe the valve formation of embryos derived from the transgenic zebrafish line tg. the yellow color shown in our nonlinear microscopy image  is corresponding to the image modality taken by the third-harmonic-generation microscopy. valves were normally formed in the wild-type embryos , but valves of embryos injected with gsk3β-mo were totally absent .

hurlstone et al  <cit>  reported that cardiac valve formation is severely affected in zebrafish apc mutants . furthermore, when axin <dig>  another key component in the wnt pathway, is knocked down, either a reduction or absence of heart positioning of the heart tube was frequently observed . gsk <dig> is known to be important in the canonical wnt pathway, and the defective valves and hearts in gsk3β-mo-injected embryos were identical to those observed in the apcmcr mutants and axin <dig> morphants, suggesting that gsk3β modulates cardiac development through wnt/β-catenin signaling.

discussion
gsk3β knockout mice display an embryonic lethal phenotype, indicating that gsk3α does not compensate for the loss of gsk3β  <cit> . furthermore, the activity of gsk3α, but not gsk3β, is required for the production of amyloid-β in the brain of patients with alzheimer's disease  <cit> . all these findings indicate that there may be isoform-specific functions of gsk <dig>  although they exhibit similar biochemical and substrate properties in vitro  <cit> . however, to clearly delineate the biological functions of these two gsk <dig> isoforms in vivo is difficult and little reported. in this report, we study the roles of gsk3α and gsk3β in the cardiogenesis of zebrafish using a loss-of-function approach. the loss of either gsk3α or gsk3β results in abnormal development of heart. yet, the role that gsk <dig> plays in cardiogenesis is in an isoform-specific manner. gsk3α plays a role in the survival of cardiomyocytes, whereas gsk3β plays a role in heart left-right biased positioning, modulated through the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

gsk3α and gsk3β play different roles during zebrafish embryogenesis
although, knockdown of gsk3α and gsk3β causes similar defective phenotypes, such as an unlooped and stretched heart, pericardial edema, blood pooling. we used gsk3α-mo and gsk3β-mo in the transgenic zebrafish line tg, in which gfp is expressed in the myocardium specifically, to modulate and observe, in real-time, the different defective phenotypes. the hearts of gsk3α morphants failed to elongate at  <dig> hpf. we prove that the heart defects induced by the gsk3α-mo are due to a decreased number of cardiomyocytes. on the other hand, the gsk3β-mo-injected embryos develop normally before the onset of cardiac jogging. defective heart positioning is observed after  <dig> hpf. rescue experiments revealed that gsk 3α and gsk3β do not function redundantly. taken together, we conclude that each isoform of gsk <dig> plays its own distinct role during cardiogenesis of zebrafish.

gsk3α, but not gsk3β, is involved in apoptosis during early embryogenesis
gsk <dig> plays an important role in the regulation of apoptosis/cell survival through the activation of caspase <dig>  <cit> . these findings support a role of gsk3β in controlling apoptosis. many studies reporting the affect of gsk3β on apoptosis have been confirmed by using gsk <dig> inhibitors, including lithium, the first known inhibitor, and many synthetic ones  <cit> . however, these inhibitors have many effects on cells and are not isoform-specific. thus, whether gsk3α and gsk3β function redundantly or distinctly on cell survival is still ambiguous. in our study, extensive apoptosis is observed throughout the head region in the gsk3α morphants. on the other hand, only slight apoptosis is noticed in the gsk3β morphants, suggesting that gsk3α, but not gsk3β, is greatly involved in apoptosis during early embryogenesis. moreover, embryos that are co-injected with gsk3α-mo and gsk3β mrna do not show reduced apoptosis, suggesting that gsk3α and gsk3β do not function redundantly in cell survival.

gsk3α-mediated apoptosis may not be implicated in wnt signaling
the wnt signaling are involved in cell proliferation and in apoptosis  <cit> . on the other hand, pkb/akt, a major regulator of gsk <dig>  also triggers a network that regulates cell cycle progression through inactivation of gsk3β  <cit> . it has been shown that pkb/akt promotes cell survival in cardiac myocytes  <cit> . in zebrafish, apcmcr mutant's hearts are morphologically normal during early cardiogenesis, but they fail to undergo looping morphogenesis  <cit> . both apcmcr and axin <dig> mutants  display cardiac defects that are similar to those of gsk3β morphants. however, no information is provided about apoptosis in apcmcr and mbl mutants. in this report, we find that apoptosis occurs in the head of gsk3α morphants. in addition, the axin1-mo-injected embryos and the mbl mutant of zebrafish have defects of looping morphogenesis in the heart, which are similar to defects occurring in the gsk3β morphants but are unlike defects occurring in the gsk3α morphants . therefore, we know that gsk3α may not mediate apoptosis implicated in wnt signaling because apoptotic signals do not increase in axin <dig> morphants . it is worth studying which pathway is implicated in gsk3α-mediated apoptosis.

gsk3β regulates bmp <dig> during cardiac development through wnt/β-catenin signaling
the phenotypes of apcmcr and mbl mutants are similar to our results in that inhibition of gsk3β also causes unlooping heart tube, pericardial edema, and blood pooling  <cit> . in addition, valve development is totally lost in gsk3β morphants , which is similar to that of apcmcr mutants. ectopic expression of bmp <dig> in the heart at 24– <dig> hpf and ectopic expression of versican in the valve at 60– <dig> hpf are also observed in the apcmcr mutant and in the gsk3β morphant . moreover, the retention of bmp <dig> symmetry is associated with disordered jogging, and we observe that bmp <dig> retention occurred in the gsk3β morphant. in addition, bmp <dig> is downstream of wnt/β-catenin signaling in several systems  <cit> . therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that gsk3β might regulate zebrafish cardiac development by means of the canonical wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

gsk3β may be involved in the regulation of t-box genes during cardiogenesis
our study reveals that knockdown of gsk3β causes a string-like heart. this phenotype is similar to the heartstrings mutant, caused by mutation of the tbx <dig>  <cit> . patients with holt-oram syndrome, one of the autosomal dominant human "heart-hand" disorders, are caused by mutations of tbx <dig>  <cit> . both loss and gain of tbx <dig> functions result in an absence of heart looping and an alteration in cardiac-specific genes  <cit> . in our study, we demonstrate that gsk3β morphants appear to have multiple heart defects, such as a non-looping or reversed looping heart, slower heart rate, and no blood circulation . in addition, after we probe with fin markers, we prove that the pectoral fin of the gsk3β morphant fails to differentiate . in chick, tbx <dig> and tbx <dig> trigger limb initiation through activation of the wnt/fgf signaling cascade  <cit> . therefore, we propose that gsk3β and tbx <dig> might be involved in the same regulatory mechanism during cardiogenesis.

zebrafish is an alternative, promising model animal to study gsk3-specific inhibitors in vivo
gsk <dig> is a target of prominent drugs for treating many diseases, including alzheimer's disease and diabetes mellitus. substrate-competitive inhibitors, which compete for the substrate binding site of the kinase, are more likely to be highly specific inhibitors. several atp-competitive inhibitors of gsk <dig> have also been defined  <cit> . however, the development of new drug not only requires the identification of the target, but also requires validation in an in vivo system. recently, atilla-gokcumen et al.,  <cit>  performed phenotypic experiments in zebrafish embryo which is served as an in vivo experiment to analyse the functions of novel gsk <dig> inhibitor, organometallic reagent - <dig>  in this study, we clearly distinguish the morphological defects in zebrafish gsk3α- and gsk3β-knockdown embryos. therefore, these findings will surely provide new criteria for the in vivo validation of potential isoform-specific inhibitors of gsk <dig> 

different biological function of gsk <dig> isoform in species
in this report, we have defined that gsk3α and gsk3β play distinct roles during zebrafish cardiogenesis. moreover, the defective valves and hearts in gsk3β-mo-injected embryos were identical to those observed in the apcmcr mutants and axin <dig> morphants, suggesting that gsk3β modulates cardiac development through wnt/β-catenin signaling. in addition, gsk <dig> is a critical regulator of wnt signaling mechanism, several recent studies have shown that the components of the wnt signaling play an important role in heart development  <cit> . however, heart defects are not reported in the gsk3β-knockout mice. one of reasons is that mice gsk3α might function redundantly to gsk3β during the heart development of mice. we also notice that the expression profiles of gsk3β in zebrafish and in xenopus are different: zebrafish gsk3β is weakly detected until 50–60% epiboly, but xenopus gsk3β is expressed strongly and constantly throughout embryogenesis  <cit> . taken together, although gsk <dig> isoforms share highly conserved in their functional domain, the biological functions of gsk <dig> isoforms in different species are not identical.

CONCLUSIONS
our data indicate that gsk3α and gsk3β play distinct roles during zebrafish embryogenesis. gsk3α, but not gsk3β, is necessary in cardiomyocyte survival; gsk3β plays an important role in regulating left-right biased heart positioning during the cardiogenesis in zebrafish. we also demonstrate that the cardiac valve defects observed in gsk3β morphants were similar to those observed in axin <dig> and apcmcrmutants, suggesting that gsk3β modulates valve formation and heart position through wnt/β-catenin signaling. finally, the defects of gsk3α morphant embryos cannot be rescued by gsk3β mrna, and vice versa, demonstrating that gsk3α and gsk3β are not functionally equivalent. thus, we conclude that gsk3α and gsk3β play distinct roles during zebrafish cardiogenesis.
