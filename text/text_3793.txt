BACKGROUND
the assessment of gene expression of the human transcriptome using microarray technology is a powerful tool for identifying genes and gene expression patterns involved in mechanisms of normal organ function and the pathogenesis of disease  <cit> . microarray technology is ideal for studies of the human airway epithelium in health and disease in that the airway is one of the few internal organs where it is possible to repetitively sample sufficient quantities of pure populations of parenchymal cells from healthy individuals as well as individuals with lung disease  <cit> . in this regard, we and several other groups have used human gene expression microarrays to assess the expression of genes in the human airway epithelium, cell populations easily attainable via fiberoptic bronchoscopy  <cit> .

while it is easy to obtain the cells, the output from microarray data critically depends on the quality of the rna and the crna derivatives hybridized to the microarray  <cit> . although several different cutoff criteria for rna integrity and microarray data quality have been proposed, they are not consistently applied. in this context, the focus of this study is to establish rigorous quality control  criteria to ensure high quality data from arrays that is comparable and reproducible among different investigators and laboratories. our strategy is based on the concept that the quality of expression data can be efficiently assessed using three discreet qc metrics computed on the sample and chip level, and that application of these metrics can ensure uniformly high quality microarray data. using affymetrix human genome u <dig> plus  <dig>  arrays to sample a total of  <dig> samples of tracheal, and large and small airway epithelium from  <dig> individuals , we have established pre- and post-chip qc criteria based on empirical observations of our data in conjunction with published suggestions that include:  rna quality, assessed by rna integrity number;  crna transcript integrity, assessed by signal intensity ratio of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  3' to 5' probe sets; and  a defined upper limit for the multi-chip normalization scaling factor. of the  <dig> samples, all three criteria were assessed in 191; of these  <dig>  passed all three criteria. for the remaining  <dig> samples, the rin was not available, and only the other two criteria were used; of these  <dig>  passed these two criteria. expression data for  <dig> maintenance gene probe sets on the array demonstrates that among the samples failing qc criteria, there is greater variability among reported expression levels for maintenance genes compared to randomly selected samples passing the qc criteria. the qc criteria proposed in this study should provide a useful guideline for future studies using microarrays to assess mrna levels in human airway epithelial samples, and should be adaptable to assessment of microarray data from other cell populations.

some of the results of these studies have been previously reported in the form of an abstract  <cit> .

RESULTS
airway epithelium
a total of  <dig> samples of airway epithelium were obtained by bronchial brushing from three different locations  from  <dig> subjects with  <dig> different pulmonary phenotypes . the mean ages varied from  <dig> to  <dig> yr, and males represented the majority in all but one group. the ancestries varied among those of european, hispanic, asian and african. the lung function fit the criteria for each group. a range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells were recovered from trachea, large airway and small airway in all five pulmonary phenotypic groups and cell counts were not dependent upon phenotype of the subject or site of bronchial brushing . from all locations, an average of  <dig> to 100% of all cells recovered were epithelial with less than 1% contamination by non-epithelial cells. the cell differentials varied depending on location as previously described  <cit> . the average yield of extracted rna was  <dig>  ±  <dig> μg. varying from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μg.

establishment and testing of quality control criteria
the overall strategy was to utilize the data on  <dig> samples to establish prospectively applicable qc criteria that would ensure high quality expression microarray data for biological interpretation in our ongoing studies. the qc criteria were selected as rigorous and objective quality control metrics at three distinct stages of the microarray workflow, and were applied to all  <dig> samples hybridized to microarray in this study; for the rin assessment, the n =  <dig> . for the gapdh 3'/5' signal intensity ratio and scaling factor criteria, all  <dig> samples were included.

of the  <dig> samples, all three criteria were assessed in 191; of these  <dig>  passed all three criteria. for the remaining  <dig> samples, the rin was not available, and only the other two criteria were used; of these  <dig>  passed these two criteria. only  <dig>  failed at least one qc criterion, and were therefore considered to have failed qc. the overall breakdown of samples failing qc was:  <dig> large airway samples  and  <dig> small airway samples . the greatest source of failure was the scaling factor criterion, which contributed to 70% of the overall failures. all of the  <dig> samples failing the qc criteria failed the rin and/or scaling factor criterion, indicating that these metrics may be the most sensitive to technical variance, and therefore are central to assessing overall array quality. while  <dig> samples failed by one criterion each,  <dig> sample failed by both the rin and gapdh 3'/5' ratio criteria, and  <dig> samples failed by both the rin and scaling factor criteria, suggesting that the quality control parameters exert correlated effects on array performance.

rin
the rna quality was examined by the bioanalyzer-generated rin score in  <dig> samples for which there was data available . based on published data  <cit> , samples with a rin ≤  <dig>  were designated to have passed qc . five out of the  <dig> samples  had rin scores < <dig> . the rin values were not significantly dependent upon the phenotype or biologic origin of the rna sample , with n =  <dig> small airway samples  and  <dig> large airway sample  failing on the basis of rin < <dig> .

gapdh 3'/5' signal intensity ratio
as a metric for the efficiency of transcription and amplification of antisense crna from the cdna derivative of the starting rna material, the signal intensities for the probe sets for gapdh residing at the 5' end and within the  <dig> nucleotides most proximal to the priming site at the 3' end of the transcript were compared. for all samples hybridized to microarrays, 3' to 5' probe set intensities for the gapdh gene were extracted to compute the 3'/5' signal intensity ratio. based on published data  <cit> , the criterion for passing qc was established as gapdh 3'/5' ratio ≤  <dig>  . by this criterion, only  <dig> small airway sample from a symptomatic smoker failed qc. the affymetrix expression microarray also returns 3'/5' ratios for other genes including β-actin. but due to the strong correlation in 3'/5' ratios for β-actin and gapdh , application of addition cutoff criteria beyond gapdh was considered redundant. in the context of airway epithelium, although gapdh is not an ideal "housekeeping" gene as its expression may vary under different conditions, this does not interfere with its use in assessing crna quality  <cit> .

multi-chip normalization scaling factor
the scaling factor was used as an overall index of the microarray hybridization, washing, and scanning process. scaling factor values for all  <dig> samples computed at a target intensity value of  <dig> were examined. the criterion of scaling factor values ≤  <dig>  was established . seven out of the  <dig> samples  had scaling factor values above the acceptable cutoff. the scaling factor values were not significantly dependent upon the phenotype or biologic origin of the sample , with n =  <dig> small airway samples  and n =  <dig> large airway samples  failing on the basis of scaling factor > <dig> .

the interdependence of failing different qc criteria was assessed . of the total  <dig> samples that failed rin, three failed one of other the other qc criteria with  <dig> failing gapdh 3'/5' test and  <dig> failing scaling factor test. there was no pattern of repeated qc failure by a single subject sampled on more than one occasion, neither was there correlation of failure with differential or % non-epithelial contamination.

 <dig> the  <dig> samples were assessed by the established qc criteria and all those failing one or more were classified by which qc criteria were failed.

 <dig> only  <dig> of the  <dig> samples were assessed for rin.

maintenance gene expression levels
to assess whether the gene expression data derived from samples that pass all of the qc criteria was more robust than that derived from samples that failed one or more conditions, for every sample, regardless of qc metric values, expression levels were extracted for the  <dig> maintenance genes. for the  <dig> samples failing qc criteria and  <dig> randomly selected samples passing the qc criteria, the expression profile for all  <dig> genes was compared. pearson's correlation was calculated for all pairwise comparisons . correlation coefficient values indicated that samples passing qc criteria were highly correlated with other samples passing qc criteria  while samples failing qc criteria showed lower correlations with all other samples . the range of correlation coefficient values obtained for pairwise correlations of samples passing qc criteria was  <dig>  to  <dig> . in contrast, when comparing samples failing qc criteria with all other samples, the range of correlation coefficient values was  <dig>  to  <dig> . there was no difference in the correlation coefficient values for samples failing qc for rin criterion versus other causes . the distribution of correlation coefficients for the pairwise comparisons of samples passing qc criteria was significantly different from the distribution of values for pairwise comparisons where at least one sample failed the qc criteria .

of the  <dig> samples passing qc criteria that were used for the correlation matrix analysis,  <dig> samples matched in airway location with the  <dig> samples failing qc criteria were selected to assess coefficient of variation of each of the  <dig> maintenance genes. expression levels for the  <dig> maintenance genes showed significantly greater variability among the  <dig> samples failing qc criteria  than among the  <dig> samples passing qc criteria . across the "pass" data set, the median coefficient of variation for the maintenance genes was  <dig> % . by contrast, across the "fail" data set, the median coefficient of variation for the  <dig> genes was  <dig> % .

similarly, the coefficient of variation for all probe sets was greater for microarrays that failed qc compared to that for microarrays that passed. two datasets of  <dig> microarrays each were compared giving a mean coefficient of variation of  <dig> ±  <dig> % for the arrays that passed qc and  <dig> ±  <dig> % for the arrays that failed qc. the impact on discovery of biological differences , was assessed by power calculations. if two groups of  <dig> smokers and  <dig> non-smokers were compared, the required true difference of means for detection with p <  <dig>  with and power of  <dig>  rises from  <dig>  with arrays that pass qc to  <dig>  with arrays that failed qc .

to examine potential causes of the variation in maintenance gene expression levels unrelated to the qc criteria, differences among the subjects were assessed. the  <dig> airway epithelial samples acquired for this study were derived from  <dig> individuals, as it was possible for a single individual to undergo bronchial brushing at one or more of the three target sites: trachea, large airway, and small airway. by independent linear regression, there was no correlation of gene expression level for the  <dig> maintenance genes  with age  across the  <dig> individuals from whom airway epithelium was derived. none of the genes showed strong correlation  with smoking history . correlation analysis of expression levels with pulmonary function parameters showed no relationship .

impact of qc failures on global lung biology
in order to assess the functional consequences of the qc criteria on the gene expression data, a principal components analysis  was used to compared samples that passed qc to those that failed. for this analysis, an independent set of microarray data that failed qc was available from a technician training program in the weill cornell medical college department of genetic medicine. from this training program,  <dig> microarrays that failed qc were available from small airway epithelium samples collected from individuals with copd . the data from these  <dig> samples was compared to microarray data from n =  <dig> samples  from the small airway epithelium of individuals with copd that passed all qc criteria . the pca revealed broad, global differences in genome-wide expression levels in the small airway epithelium of individuals with copd in samples that pass qc vs those that fail . using the criteria of p call of "present" in 20% of samples, magnitude of fold-change in passed vs failed samples > <dig> , and p <  <dig>  using a t test with a benjamini-hochberg correction to limit the false positive rate, a total of  <dig> probe sets are differentially expressed between the  <dig> groups , indicating that data from microarrays that fail qc criteria is not necessarily only more variable or "noisy," but in fact is significantly different biological data compared to data obtained from samples that pass qc criteria.

discussion
epithelial samples  of trachea, large airway and small airway were obtained from healthy subjects and from subjects with lung disease, including smokers and non-smokers, to assess quality control criteria for microarray analysis. using affymetrix human genome u <dig> plus  <dig>  arrays, a tripartite qc cutoff was established consisting of:  rna quality, assessed by rna integrity number  ≥  <dig>  using agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer software;  crna transcript integrity, assessed by signal intensity ratio ≤  <dig>  of gapdh 3' to 5' probe sets; and  the multi-chip normalization scaling factor ≤  <dig> . of the  <dig> samples,  <dig> failed one or more of the qc criteria in a way that did not depend on phenotype of the subject or location of sampling. by using the qc cutoff criteria, the inter-array variability, as assessed by the coefficient of variation in the expression levels for  <dig> maintenance genes, decreased significantly. these qc criteria should be applicable to minimize experimental variation in gene expression microarray experiments.

rna quality as assessed by rin
we have previously utilized the 28s/18s rrna peak ratio, as calculated by electropherogram, to verify quality of rna samples prior to microarray hybridization  <cit> . however, the 28s/18s ratio does not always provide a sufficient basis for distinguishing high quality from low quality rna for microarray experiments  <cit> . for example, in an analysis of the effects of technical variability on gene expression in unfixed snap frozen vs formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  pelleted human bone marrow stromal cells, despite all rna samples having equivalent and comparable 28s/18s ratios as visualized by computerized gel electrophoresis, more than twice as many genes were identified as expressed in snap frozen cells than in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cells, reflecting possible rna quality effects in play that were not captured by quantitative assessment of the rrna subunit peak heights  <cit> .

since the implementation of the agilent bioanalyzer rin software, we have relied on the rin as the primary indicator of rna integrity, based on published data showing that the rin accounts for numerous properties of the rna degradation process to provide an unambiguous and comprehensive index of the overall quality of the starting material  <cit> . we found that the rna quality in this study, as assessed by rin, was generally good with a failure rate of  <dig> % based on rin ≥  <dig> . the low percentage of failures probably reflects rigorous training and standard operating procedures that ensure that epithelial cells are homogenized in trizol in less than  <dig> minutes from the time of bronchial brushing. using a single technician for this process with space, equipment and reagents that are not used for other purposes is also critical. the increased interest in using clinical specimens for research has led to widespread establishment of human tissue banks. in many cases, the rna for microarray studies is extracted from tissues samples that may have been kept at room temperature and/or undergone repeated thawing and freezing, thereby affecting the quality of the rna  <cit> . for example, microarray experiments involving pancreatic tumor tissue have had to discard the majority of the extracted rna samples, due to the rnase-rich content of the organ and the rapid degradation of the rna material  <cit> . for those types of samples with possible rna degradation, consistent application of the rin ≥  <dig>  cutoff is useful for obtaining high quality gene expression microarray data.

illustrating the predictive power of the rin as a pre-chip criterion, linear regression modeling and ordinary least squares linear regression have shown that the scaling factor and gapdh 3'/5' signal intensity ratio are negatively correlated with the rin value  <cit> . interestingly, the tandem failures by two samples in the present study by the rin and scaling factor criteria, and by one sample by the rin criterion and gapdh 3'/5' signal intensity ratio criteria, are in concordance with the concept that poor rna quality adversely affects synthesis of full-length crna as well as the hybridization efficiency of probe-target binding  <cit> . since failure of the rin test predicts failure at downstream steps, the application of this cutoff prior to in vitro transcription reactions and hybridization has the potential to save substantial costs in wasted reagents and technical time.

scaling
published recommendations for an acceptable range of scaling factors computed at the same target intensity value vary in numerical fold cutoffs, or alternately, suggest all values within  <dig> standard deviations from the mean in either direction  <cit> . however, because the genechip scanner  <dig> 7g used in this study, and generally employed by most institutional microarray core facilities, can resolve  <dig>  levels of fluorescence in  <dig> bits of resolution , scaling factors for arrays can theoretically, and in practice, range well into the hundreds. since a mutable scaling factor range can be continually subject to fluctuation as new samples are added to ongoing studies, and skewed by the presence of even one or two outlying chips with extremely high scaling factors, we chose a finite upper limit of  <dig>  for the scaling factor criterion. as 97% of the scaling factor values for the samples examined in this study were ≤  <dig> , this is a practical and attainable cutoff that can accurately identify outlying poor quality samples.

in gene expression profiling studies of samples obtained from biopsies, cell sorting, or laser capture microdissection, yields of cellular rna are often small quantities  and require specialized amplification methods to generate sufficient biotinylated crna for array hybridization  <cit> . in these types of studies and others examining in vivo tissue from which sample rna is limiting and alternate technical procedures are utilized, the scaling factor metric can be useful to assess the impact of technical artifact, and the quality of the expression data. for example, in an analysis of small sample rnas from rat liver, significantly increased scaling factor values indicated that the amplification technique used contributed to technical variability in the form of a substantial decrease in the percent of transcripts detected on the array  <cit> . in contrast, in a study of small amounts of rna derived from breast cancer tissue from mastectomy specimens, consistent scaling factor values across all amplified samples confirmed the validity and comparability of the expression data  <cit> .

quality control for expression microarray analysis
despite large amounts of published lung gene expression data, there is often little attention focused on microarray quality control, with the consequent risk of skewing the data by including poor quality arrays in the analysis  <cit> . further, different effects of rna quality on specific ontological categories can complicate the extraction of biological information from microarrays of varying quality. for example, in an analysis of the effects of rna integrity on gene expression in breast cancer samples, it was found that specific categories of genes such as those related to deoxyribonuclease activity, regulation of cell adhesion, and nadh dehydrogenase activity, were most affected by rna quality  <cit> .

one methodology for testing data integrity is that of unsupervised hierarchical sample clustering based on spearman correlations-based distance metric  <cit> . the resulting clusters are inspected manually for clustering of samples by non-biological parameters, such as the dates of sample collection and rna extraction, the batch of in vitro transcription and amplification reagent used, and the date of array hybridization. these factors may contribute to batch effects, where the overall intensity of a batch of microarrays more closely resembles the batch than the rest of the group of arrays  <cit> . while these clustering methods provide insight into experimental variability, they provide no quantitative guidelines for eliminating microarrays from analysis and it is sometimes difficult to determine if the clusters have any relationship to biological variability.

another strategy often used for differentiating high quality from low quality microarray data is based on outlier status of any given sample in an experiment. software packages such as dchip  and probe profiler can identify intensity outliers of a sample in a group of microarrays, and take into account such features of the array hybridization such as brightness, saturation, dynamic range, and background  <cit> . the caveat is that all chips must be from biologically comparable origins and that only a small number of experimental outliers must exist.

qc criteria presented in this study
the current study provides an efficient and simple approach for quality assessment of gene expression microarray data. it emphasizes good experimental execution and discarding unsatisfactory microarrays rather than salvaging data through complex statistical analyses of array data of variable quality. we provide a standardized tripartite criteria specifically addressing starting rna quality, integrity of the crna transcript, and hybridization efficiency. each parameter has been assigned a threshold value, outside of which samples are readily identifiable as being low quality and can be eliminated or re-hybridized before proceeding to analysis. all measures are available through agilent bioanalyzer software and the affymetrix gcos report automatically generated after array washing and scanning. although the agilent bioanalyzer and affymetrix platforms are widely used, analogous criteria may be applied for alternate methodologies. for example, assessment of the relative signal for probes representing the 3' and 5' ends of any mrna could be included as qc for any microarray platform.

in the context of data sharing via public repositories, the criteria presented in this study has the benefit of including two parameters that are guaranteed to be available for any affymetrix data deposited in geo. the initial processing by gcos of cel files produces a quality report containing the 3'/5' gapdh signal intensity ratio and a multi-chip normalization scaling factor for the array. the gcos software is available for free download from affymetrix and can be applied by all investigators. in this way, two of the three qc criteria discussed in this paper provide a consistent quality control approach to not only current data, but also to previously published, archived data. even though the rin criterion as applied here requires specialized equipment and software, the rin can be indirectly predicted from the 3'/5' ratio which is extracted from the cel files deposited in geo  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in the context that minimizing undesirable technical variation allows for more accurate analysis of gene expression and increased power for significance testing, we propose that the simple method described here, consisting of a universally available set of three criteria, can ensure that microarray data reflects biological differences as opposed to experimental variability.
