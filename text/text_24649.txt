BACKGROUND
muscle growth involves a tightly controlled balance between protein synthesis and degradation  <cit> . protein synthesis is driven by the growth hormone /insulin like growth factor /mammalian target of rapamycin  pathway  <cit> , whereas protein degradation occurs via a number of pathways including ubiquitin proteasome  <cit> , lysosomal  <cit> , apoptotic  <cit>  and the calcium dependant calpains  <cit> . these processes and the pathways underlying their regulation have been examined in atlantic salmon   <cit> , rainbow trout   <cit>  and other fish  <cit> . the anabolic effects of the gh/igf system have also been studied in ectothermic animals including atlantic salmon  <cit> , rainbow trout  <cit>  and other teleosts  <cit> . the gh/igf system has been seen to activate the mtor pathway thus directing protein synthesis, and is highly conserved in teleosts  <cit> .

in mammals the key signals involved in stimulating anabolic activity are free amino acids, gh and igf  <cit> , whereas catabolic signals include nutrient depletion, hormones such as cortisol and transcription factors such as forkhead box o   <cit> . the actions of many of these key signals have been seen to be conserved in salmonid fish  <cit> . despite being initiated by different signals, catabolism and anabolism share many aspects of downstream signalling machinery, providing the possibility of intracellular cross talk between these two processes  <cit> . in mammals undergoing acute inflammatory responses, muscle tissue goes into immediate catabolic state  <cit>  where muscle fibres are broken down releasing free amino acids, likely to be used for liver protein synthesis of acute phase serum proteins. as skeletal muscle is the principal body store of proteins, this tissue is the main target for catabolism and release of free amino acids  <cit> . in mammals the inflammatory response leads to a loss of skeletal muscle mass in both acute and chronic inflammatory situations  <cit> . the current consensus in higher vertebrates is that this increase in muscle atrophy can be mediated by proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β   <cit> , il- <dig>  <cit>  and tumor necrosis factor-α   <cit> . several different processes have been identified by which proinflammatory cytokines can negatively affect muscle mass. il-1β and tnfα receptors, on the surface of the cells, signal via conserved signal transduction pathways and alter gene expression, which in muscle tissue normally induces genes involved in protein degradation resulting in the release of free amino acids  <cit> . in parallel this cytokine signalling competes with and decreases the effects of igf-i signalling, specifically during downstream signal transduction, hence reducing the anabolic hormone effect. such intracellular receptor crosstalk between cytokines and anabolic hormones can lead to a state of endocrine resistance whereby no increase in the amount of ligand present will increase the hormonal effects  <cit> . this cytokine induced hormone resistance can result in a condition known as cachexia, one aspect of which is a chronic increase in proinflammatory cytokines such as tnfα and il-1β  <cit> . the effects of cachexia are a loss of body mass, especially skeletal muscle protein, and it is thought that the ability of cytokines to cause hormone resistance is one of the primary mediators of cachexia. this condition differs from simple weight loss since the loss of body mass will continue despite feeding  <cit> .

transcriptional responses to various triggers of protein catabolism have been examined in salmonid fish, including starvation  <cit> , starvation and refeeding  <cit> , or following extensive anorexic migrations  <cit>  and vitellogenesis  <cit> . however to date only a limited number of investigations have addressed the effects of infection or immune stimulation on muscle growth in fish  <cit> . previously a cachexia model in rainbow trout was developed by chronic stimulation with lipopolysaccharides   <cit> , mimicking sepsis and chronic background infection. in these fish, muscle protein content was decreased, but levels of myod and myosin were unaffected indicating that while muscle accretion was altered, the mechanisms may be different to those known in mammals. in general the response was much less dramatic than is observed in mammals, probably reflecting the different control of amino acid reallocation in ectothermic fish.

proinflammatory cytokines, which include il-1β, are the primary mediators of the innate immune system  <cit>  and show a rapid response at the transcriptional level following recognition of pathogens including bacterial and viral products  <cit> . il-1β is secreted as the mature form following cleavage of the precursor molecule by interleukin  <dig> converting enzyme . the mature soluble protein binds to the il- <dig> receptor  <dig>  receptor which then recruits the il- <dig> receptor accessory protein  and initiates the signal cascade  <cit> . the signalling cascade activates pathways that positively regulate the activity of transcription factor nuclear factor-κβ  and the mitogen activated protein kinases p <dig>  and c-jun n-terminal kinases   <cit> . it is through the activation of these pathways that il-1β is thought to negatively affect anabolism while stimulating catabolism  <cit> . whilst there is some controversy as to how il-1β is processed in fish  <cit> , nevertheless a functional mature peptide has been produced in several species  <cit>  and the receptor genes have been cloned  <cit> .

this paper investigates the effects of acute proinflammatory stimulation on the transcriptome of atlantic salmon primary myocyte cells. we hypothesise that the inflammatory stimuli will cause significant changes in the expression of genes related to immune function, protein metabolism and other cellular processes. further to this, we hypothesize that co-incubation of cell cultures with igf-i as well as ril-1β will lead to an attenuation of the metabolic actions of inflammation.

RESULTS
cell culture and stimulation
primary muscle cell cultures were assessed for differentiation and purity by light microscopy at 4× and 10× magnification . nine grams of white skeletal muscle pooled from six fish provided sufficient cells to reach confluence when evenly split between two  <dig> well plates. prior to performing the microarray analysis, confirmation that the cells responded to ril-1β was carried out by real time pcr using il-1β itself as a marker gene since it is known to increase in expression in response to ril-1β stimulation. il-1β expression was significantly increased  in the stimulated samples compared to the control samples.

microarray analysis
following filtering and quality control  <dig> probes were retained for statistical analysis. of these  <dig> were significantly altered in expression at p <  <dig>  following correction for multiple tests. we further filtered this set of genes by retaining those with a fold change of > <dig> leaving a differentially regulated set of  <dig> genes for analysis . within the gene set  <dig> features were increased and  <dig> features decreased in expression. the gene with the highest up-regulation is the cytokine tnfα <dig> with a  <dig> fold increase, whilst aquaporin  <dig> was the most decreased in expression with a  <dig> fold reduction in expression. confirmation of microarray expression was conducted using seven key genes analysed with realtime pcr  where a highly significant correlation  between qpcr and microarray data was found.

in order to better understand the changes in whole cell transcriptomic output, gene ontology analysis was used to indicate the biological processes that were modulated by the il-1β stimulation. from the  <dig> features retained for analysis,  <dig>  were annotated to a functional protein and  <dig>  were assigned at least one gene ontology  identifier for biological process, enabling further assessment of biological function. these proportions reflect the annotation of all features on the microarray slide. statistical analysis for enrichment for biological processes resulted in  <dig> biological process go terms being identified. the nature of go analysis means that many of these are overlapping and only the non-redundant major groupings are presented . observation of both the go analysis and manual assignment identification of functions was used to assign genes to functional groups. the differentially expressed genes could be defined as belonging to a number of distinct functional classes, especially immune response, proteolysis, growth regulation and structural proteins, cell cycle and lipid metabolism. the directional expression changes indicated how these processes were being affected, with a general increase in the expression of immune related and protein metabolism genes, whereas growth, structural proteins and cell cycle showed a negative trend, with a majority of genes being down regulated in expression. a complex response was found for genes encoding lipid metabolism proteins, indicting major transcriptional changes relating to lipid mobilisation.

immune response genes
there was a clear increase in genes related to immune function  most notably in the high increase of expression of mrnas encoding proinflammatory cytokines such as il-1β and tnfα  as well as chemokines such as il- <dig>  transcription factors involved in il-1β signalling were also increased in expression with subunits of nfκb and its inhibitor, map kinase-interacting serine/threonine kinase  <dig>  mapk activated jun-b and ccaat/enhancer binding protein all being up regulated. components of the il-1β receptor machinery were also increased including il- <dig> receptor accessory protein, il- <dig> receptor kinase and an il- <dig> receptor antagonist protein mrna . other innate immune related genes were also increased including complement components, c-type lectins and the antimicrobial proteins hepcidin and ferritin. both these latter two genes have roles in iron binding. several negative regulators of inflammation were also found to be increased including two suppressors of cytokine signalling  genes, socs  <dig> and  <dig>  the anti-inflammatory cytokine il- <dig>  and as mentioned earlier an il- <dig> antagonist .

proteolysis
genes related to protein metabolism were modulated by the il-1β stimulation including those involved in both synthesis and degradation . the largest group of protein metabolism genes found to be increased in expression were those related to proteolysis, specifically the ubiquitin proteasome pathway . several e <dig> ubiquitin ligases, ubiquitin like proteins and four 20s proteasome subunits all increased in expression. other genes encoding proteolytic proteins found to be increased in expression included collagenase  <dig> and a cytosolic dipeptidase. a number of proteases were decreased in expression including a subunit of calpain  <dig>  serine protease htra <dig> and  <dig>  cystatin b and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme e <dig> t.

growth regulation and structural proteins
an interesting group of genes that can be regarded as controllers of anabolic signalling were also modulated. most notable were the igf binding proteins , where igfbp- <dig> was found increased in expression following the inflammatory stimulus whereas igfbps - <dig>   <dig> and rp <dig> decreased in expression . genes controlling muscle cell differentiation were also changed in expression including the transcriptional repressor yin-yang  <dig>  which showed an up regulation and myogenic regulatory factor  <dig>  which was down regulated . structural protein encoding mrnas showed a marked tendency to be down regulated, as seen with the collagens and the myosins, β-actin, and troponin .

cell cycle and dna metabolism
the expression of genes regulating the cell cycle was clearly altered, with the majority of them being reduced in expression . five cyclins , two cyclin dependent kinases, and several cell division cycle proteins were all reduced in expression. however, two cyclins  were increased in expression. dna metabolism genes were also generally decreased in expression, including several minichromosome maintenance complex components, dna replication complex and dna replication licensing factor mcm <dig>

lipid and sterol metabolism
finally, stimulation with ril-1β caused changes in the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism . these included the increase in expression of several cholesterol transport proteins such as apolipoprotein  l <dig> and lipoprotein lipase. however there was also a down regulation in other similar genes such as apo a <dig> binding protein and apo b and a down regulation of proteins involved in sterol synthesis.

temporal response and interaction of igf and il-1β
to assess the effect of time of ril-1β stimulation on primary myocytes on gene expression, ril-1β stimulation was performed at  <dig>   <dig> and 48 h and four key marker genes from the microarray analysis  were examined by real time pcr . il-1β was highly increased in expression at all-time points but it was at 48 h that the highest increase in expression was found. tnfα also showed the greatest fold increase at 48 h however this was more due to a reduction in the control expression seen at 48 h, than an increase in the stimulated cells. myf <dig> was consistently down regulated at all time points with no increase in effect seen after 6 h. finally igfbp- <dig> was increased at all  <dig> times, but with a maximum fold increase at 24 h and 48 h.

to assess the interaction between ril-1β and rigf-i primary myocyte cultures were stimulated with ril-1β , rigf-i , ril-1β  + rigf-i  or maintained as control. these stimulations were carried out for both 6 h and 24 h to determine if ril-1β interfered with early effects that igf-i may have on the cell cultures. the genes analysed were chosen to represent the immune response  and protein metabolism/growth .

at 6 h co-stimulation of cells there was an up regulation of il-1β and tnfα expression in response to ril-1β stimulation, and this was not significantly altered by co-incubation with ril- <dig> β + rigf-i . hepcidin was also found to be up regulated in response to ril-1β , with co-incubation with ril-1β + rigf-i reducing the magnitude of this increase ~30% . regarding the expression of the igfbps, there was no effect of any treatment on the expression of igfbp- <dig>  igfbp- <dig> was up regulated in response to ril-1β  and this effect was not altered by co-incubation with rigf-i. however, stimulation with just rigf-i led to a significant reduction in the expression of igfbp- <dig> . curiously igfbp- <dig> was found to be significantly down regulated in response to co-incubation with ril-1β + rigf-i  but not by either treatment alone. myf <dig> was found to be down regulated in response to ril-1β  and this effect was not significantly altered by co-incubation  . lastly, atrogin- <dig> was found to be significantly down regulated in response to stimulation with rigf-i  but unaltered by ril-1β treatment . co-incubation with ril-1β + rigf-i however ablated the rigf-i effect.

at 24 h co-stimulation of cells with ril-1β + rigf-i significantly reduced the expression of il-1β relative to cells only stimulated with ril-1β, from  <dig> fold to  <dig> fold . no significant effect of co-incubation of ril-1β + rigf-i was found on the expression of tnfα or hepcidin . additionally co-incubation did not alter the expression of myf <dig> or any of the igfbps. while ril-1β alone significantly increased the expression of atrogin- <dig>  this increase was not found in cells co-incubated with ril-1β + rigf-i . however the co-incubated cells had significantly increased expression of atrogin- <dig> compared to cells stimulated with just rigf-i. rigf-i alone also significantly reduced the expression of hepcidin  but had no effect on the other genes. all the genes tested that were also hybridised with sufficient intensity on the microarray showed the same direction and similar magnitude of response in this cell culture experiment.

discussion
regulation of muscle mass is under the control of a multitude of regulators related to both anabolic and catabolic processes. we hypothesised that the muscle cells would respond to the inflammatory stimulus by signalling the induction of inflammatory responsive genes in addition to other pathways related to protein metabolism for release of free amino acids as occurs during the acute phase response  <cit> , or for gluconeogenesis and energy reallocation. our approach of using primary cells to examine the transcriptomic responses of muscle cells stimulated with il-1β avoids complex host and cell type responses observed during in vivo experiments. the response to the recombinant cytokine resulted in a large panel of genes that were significantly modulated being both increased and decreased in expression. using gene ontology enrichment analysis for biological processes five key enriched processes were revealed: immune function, protein catabolism, igf and growth regulation, cell cycle and lipid metabolism.

immune response
the immune genes up regulated included several proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf-α, il-1β and il- <dig>  indicating that stimulated myocytes are capable of synthesising these cytokines and are undergoing a proinflammatory response. the response to il-1β is extremely rapid in other cell types in fish  <cit>  and it is likely that within 24 h these molecules will have been secreted into the medium. several genes in the inflammatory signalling cascade were induced including nfκb subunits p <dig> and p <dig>  and the nfκb inhibitor , as seen during inflammation in other cell types  <cit> . under normal conditions iκb binds to nfκb to inactivate it but iκb is phosphorylated by iκb kinase  and subsequently ubiquitinated and destroyed by the proteasome  <cit> . a related key signalling molecule up regulated was map kinase-interacting serine/threonine kinase  <dig>  central to the mapk pathways involved in il-1β signalling  <cit> , and with additional roles in the regulation of igf signalling  <cit> . another important transcription factor up regulated was the mapk activated jun-b which increases transcription of il-1β responsive genes generally at ap- <dig> responsive sites  <cit> . interestingly, although jun-b may be associated with inflammatory signalling, it also has a role in maintaining muscle mass and its over expression in mammals can induce hypertrophy  <cit> , indicting complex regulation of transcriptional machinery. in parallel to this, several genes encoding proteins that have roles as anti-inflammatory factors were activated; these include two suppressors of cytokine signalling , il- <dig> and an il- <dig> receptor chain. socs proteins are often co-regulated during inflammation to prevent cellular damage and are negative regulators of cytokine signalling and function that interferes with signal transduction from cytokine receptors. the socs genes have been characterised in salmonid fish  <cit>  and are increased in expression following stimulation with several different cytokines including il-1β, tnfα and il- <dig>  other immune related genes such as hepcidin, ferritin, c type lectin and the complement system were also significantly increased in expression. both hepcidin and ferritin control iron availability and have antimicrobial actions with ferritin sequestering iron to reduce availability to microbes  <cit> , whereas hepcidin also has direct antimicrobial properties and is often described as an antimicrobial peptide  <cit> . c-type lectins recognise carbohydrate moieties and are often induced by proinflammatory signals  <cit> , to regulate a variety of immune processes including the complement system  <cit> . there was also activation of some genes that are components of the adaptive immune system, such as major histocompatibility complex  class i and cd4-like protein, but at the time point we examined the predominant immune gene response was by molecules of the innate defences.

protein catabolic processes
a major proteolytic pathway in muscle is the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, which in mammals is believed to be responsible for the majority of muscle protein degradation initiated by a number of different stimuli including inflammation in mammals  <cit> . this pathway has also been seen to be activated in salmonid fish during muscle atrophy induced by food deprivation  <cit> , hormonal changes  <cit> , with some evidence of several components being modulated during immune responses  <cit> . the end product of proteolysis is the release of free amino acids for de novo protein synthesis or for the oxidation of the amino acids and gluconeogenesis. following the inflammatory stimulus, several components of the ubp were increased in expression in myocytes. several ubiquitin e <dig> ligases, which initiate the targeting of proteins for degradation and a number of proteasome subunits from the catalytic core of the proteasome , were increased in expression. we hypothesise that these changes would result in increased protein degradation and reduced muscle growth releasing free amino acids, which in vivo would be reallocated to other organs, such as the liver as occurs in mammals  <cit> . although the predominant proteolytic genes modulated were related to the ubp system, cystatin b, an inhibitor of the acidic lysosomal cathepsins was down regulated, possibly indicating an increase in cathepsin bioavailability and activity  <cit> . in addition the calcium dependant protease calpain subunit  <dig> was down regulated following the il-1β stimulation. this protease has roles in positive regulation of myofusion inhibiting the differentiation of myocyte cells  <cit>  and this may indicate a reduction of muscle cell differentiation.

other proteases observed to be increased included collagenase  <dig>  that is increased in expression in nfkb mediated inflammation in mammals  <cit>  and during vitellogenesis induced muscle atrophy in salmonids  <cit> . angiotensinogen, the precursor of both angiotensin i & ii, was also increased in expression, and is known to interfere with the actions and production of igf-i, which in mammals is mediated by the nfκb pathway in collaboration with protein kinase c  <cit> .

in general there was a clear effect of ril-1β on the expression of genes related to catabolism as evidenced by a transcriptomic shift towards muscle catabolism by the increase in mrnas related to protein degradation and the down regulation of protein degradation related genes that have positive effects on growth.

igfbps
the igf system is instrumental in the control of protein synthesis and growth in both mammals and fish  <cit> . the activity of igf is under tight control, often by a family of igf binding proteins , which have recently been characterised in salmonid fish  <cit> . they function by either stabilising the igf or by competitively binding the igf to prevent attachment to the igf receptor  <cit>  and thus reducing the anabolic effects of igf on the cells.

we found several igfbp encoding mrnas were modulated by the proinflammatory stimulus. igfbp- <dig> is thought to have a binding preference for igf-ii but also binds igf-i  <cit> . these direct effects on the activity of both igfs might drive the cells away from high levels of protein synthesis and anabolism towards a state of catabolism  <cit> . previous studies indicate igfbp- <dig> expression is associated with the inhibition of cell proliferation in both fish  <cit>  and mammals  <cit> . additionally igfbp- <dig> expression is reduced during resumption of growth following starvation  <cit> . these findings tend to indicate that igfbp- <dig> expression has a negative relationship with growth due to the ability of igfbp- <dig> to act as a negative regulator of igf-i & ii activity, thus making an increase in the expression of igfbp- <dig> a potential marker of inflammation induced catabolism in salmon muscle.

other igfbps  <dig>   <dig> and rp <dig> were all decreased in expression following the inflammatory stimulus. in salmonids igfbp- <dig> expression in muscle is increased by anabolic stimuli such as refeeding after starvation  <cit>  and is positively related to the expression of the promyogenic transcription factors myod and myf <dig> in vitro <cit> . igfbp- <dig> can potentiate the effects of igf-i especially with regard to bone  <cit>  and muscle differentiation  <cit> . in rainbow trout igfbp- <dig> increased in expression in muscle during refeeding after starvation  <cit>  and, in atlantic salmon primary myocytes, the expression of igfbp- <dig> decreased during cell proliferation suggesting this protein is associated with entry to cell cycle  <cit> . together these results suggest the igfbps are responding in a coordinated fashion to reduce igf signalling and altering the balance between anabolic and catabolic pathways.

growth regulation and structural proteins
many transcription factors involved in growth regulation were altered. ccaat/enhancer binding protein delta was increased, and is a transcription factor with multiple functions, that is positively related to myostatin expression in mammals  <cit> . in rainbow trout muscle it is increased during energy reallocation caused by vitellogenesis  <cit>  indicating a blocking of muscle growth. a second key transcription factor, nfκb, is often associated solely with immune function but also negatively regulates myogenesis via the transcriptional repressor yy <dig>  <cit> . both of these molecules were increased in this experiment by il-1β. yy <dig> is likely to be a mediator of nfκb induced muscle growth inhibition, achieving this by silencing myofibrillar promoters in myoblasts  <cit> . myf <dig>  a muscle specific transcription factor, regulates muscle cell differentiation  <cit>  and a reduction in its expression level in this experiment fits with our anticipated reduction of muscle growth markers in response to ril-1β stimulation. additionally we found a general decrease in expression of mrnas coding for muscle structural proteins such as collagens, myosins, actin and keratin, consistent with the hypothesis that the muscle cells are undergoing a reduction in growth in response to immune stimulation, as previously shown in mammals  <cit> .

cell cycle
the cell cycle is largely mediated through the actions of cyclin/cyclin dependent kinase complexes  <cit> . in the salmon myocytes multiple cyclins were modulated by il-1β stimulation strongly suggesting cell cycle activity is being altered. for example, cyclin d <dig> expression was increased and functions in combination with cyclin dependent kinases to initiate and progress through the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle  <cit> . the increase of cyclin d <dig> may be related to nfκb mediated arrest of muscle growth by preventing myocyte differentiation  <cit> . cyclin g <dig> was also increased and may inhibit entry into the cell cycle  <cit> .

the remaining cyclins a <dig>  b  and e  were all decreased in expression. cyclin a <dig> is a rate limiting factor during s-phase and dna synthesis and entry to mitosis  <cit> , whereas cyclins e <dig> and e <dig> are responsible for the transition from g <dig> to s phases and initiation of dna replication  <cit> . cyclins b <dig> & b <dig> have roles during the s-phase and the m-phase and are crucial for maintenance of the mitotic state  <cit> . several other cyclin related kinases, cell division proteins and minichromosome maintenance complex components were generally down regulated indicating a major reduction in cell cycle activity and dna metabolism in these primary muscle cells under an inflammatory stimulus.

lipid and sterol metabolism
a final group of genes found to be altered were those related to lipid and sterol metabolism, here several cholesterol transport proteins were increased in expression including apo l <dig>  glycolipid transfer protein and lipoprotein lipase. apo-l <dig> is known to be a tnf-α inducible protein and its expression is known to be involved in the activation of the nfκb signalling pathway activated by cytokines in mammals  <cit> . the increase in the lipoprotein lipase could reflect an increased breakdown of lipoproteins for immune or cellular processes; this gene is under the control of many different signals in mammals including insulin, nutritional state and cytokines  <cit> . prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase  <dig>  a gene known in mammals to be inducible by a variety of inflammatory substances  <cit> , was also increased as a result of the ril-1β stimulation. apo a <dig> binding protein and apo b were reduced in expression as well as several other sterol synthesis proteins. these results indicate that lipid metabolism is being actively changed in these myocytes under the inflammatory stimulus, resulting in complex changes in transcription of their mrnas. many of these changes could be mediated through intracellular crosstalk with the igf/insulin pathway  <cit> .

interaction between igf-i and il-1β
results from the microarray clearly indicated genes involved in the igf regulation were being modulated by il-1β, especially a number igf binding proteins. we performed additional experiments to address if transcripts altered by inflammation would be modulated by igf- <dig>  a hormone which drives cells towards an anabolic status. atrogin - <dig> a key gene involved in protein degradation was reduced in expression by incubation of cells with rigf- <dig> as previously reported, conversely it is increased following incubation with il-1β as occurs in mammals  <cit> . when cells were co-incubation with ril-1β and rigf-i an almost total inhibition of the atrogin- <dig> down regulation was found, suggesting the proinflammatory signal is blocking the anabolic effect of igf- <dig>  il-1β alone results in an increase in atrogin - <dig> expression at 24 h as found in mammalian cells stimulated by proinflammatory cytokines  <cit> . the co-stimulation also decreased the magnitude of the response of the antimicrobial peptide hepcidin, highlighting an alternative allocation of resources depending on the signalling the muscle cells are receiving. together these results show how anabolic signals may attenuate transcription of immune defence molecules and that proinflammatory signals can increase catabolic effects in the cells.

CONCLUSIONS
muscle tissue is a complex and dynamic organ and is generally the only protein storage organ in the body; hence it needs to be able to control the synthesis of proteins and release of amino acids via degradation under a variety of environmental and physiological conditions. muscle does respond to immune insults in fish,  <cit>  but to date these responses have not been examined in an in vitro system removing the mileu of cytokines and hormones. here we show a direct effect of a proinflammatory cytokine on primary muscle cells that induces not only immune genes, but also alters the wider transcriptome indicating increased catabolism, lipid mobilization and decreased cell proliferation with a large role potentially for the igfbps . subsequent experiments demonstrate that both il-1β and igf- <dig> exert disparate effects on mechanisms that regulate growth and other physiological responses as highlighted by their interaction of expression on atrogin- <dig>  these findings will direct future research into the control of muscle mass in ectothermic animals, particularly in relation to health and nutrition.
