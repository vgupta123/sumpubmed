BACKGROUND
glutathione transferase   is a multifunctional enzyme, which protects cells against cytotoxic and genotoxic stresses. gst catalyzes the conjugation of cytotoxic agents to glutathione , producing less reactive chemical species. changes in gst levels have been found to correlate with resistance to anticancer drugs through accelerated detoxification of these drugs' substrates  <cit> .

members of the gst family are present at relatively high concentrations in the cytosol of various mammalian tissues. over-expression of gst isozymes has been reported in a number of different human cancers, when compared to the corresponding normal tissues  <cit> . a 2-fold increase in gst activity was found in lymphocytes from chronic lymphocytic leukemia  patients, who were resistant to chlorambucil, relative to lymphocytes from untreated cll patients  <cit> . as gst isozymes are frequently up-regulated in many solid tumors and lymphomas, inhibition gst activity has become a new drug design concept  <cit> . these facts led to the search for and design of gst inhibitors, including their synthetic analogues and glutathione conjugates, however, most of the existing inhibitors are either too toxic to be used in vivo or are effective only in vitro  <cit> .

although several different gst inhibitors have been reported, to our knowledge, there are no reports on design of the gst inhibitors according to gst sequence. in this report, a novel, covering all gene fragments , cloning method was used to screen the gst fragments which can bind to glutathione and form the inhibitory complexes. these inhibitory complexes act as modified substrate inhibitors or substrate homologues to inhibit the gst activity. the method described in this report should be suitable not only for development of novel drugs inhibiting the gst activity, but also for finding effective inhibitors in other enzyme-catalyzed reaction systems.

RESULTS
screening the gst inhibitors using the fragments of gst
the scheme of the 'covering all gene fragments'  cloning method is shown in fig.  <dig>  and the whole screening procedure is shown in fig.  <dig>  following five-time panning procedure, as described in the methods section,  <dig> positive clones, which can tightly bind to the glutathione sepharose 4b beads, were picked up from the plates. the typical panning efficiency during each round is shown in table  <dig>  after five-time panning procedure, the fraction of unbound e. coli cells was significantly decreased, from about 11% to  <dig>  × 10-5%.

the  <dig> positive clones were picked up from the plates and used for screening the gst inhibitors. following five consecutive screening procedures , the inhibitor efficiencies of all positive clones were compared. we found that positive clones expressing gywkikglv  and kwrnkkfelglefpnl  can significantly inhibit gst activity. the binding efficiency of e. coli cells expressing f <dig> or f <dig> peptides on the glutathione sepharose 4b beads was confirmed by an independent experiment. the fraction of e. coli cells expressing f <dig> or f <dig> peptides unbound to the glutathione sepharose 4b beads was  <dig>  × 10-5% or  <dig>  × 10-5%, respectively, while  <dig> % control e. coli cells remained unbound to such beads .

it has been concluded from the crystallographic study that arg <dig>  lys <dig> and asn <dig> of gst can interact with glutathione  <cit> . here, our results show that the identified f <dig> peptide kwrnkkfelglefpnl contains arg <dig>  lys <dig> and asn <dig> . the control peptide f <dig>  lacking arg <dig>  lys <dig> and asn <dig> residues, could not bind efficiently to the glutathione sepharose 4b beads . moreover, tyr <dig>  trp <dig> and leu <dig> of gst were shown to interact with glutathione  <cit> , and our results show that f <dig> peptide gywkikglv contains tyr <dig>  trp <dig> and leu <dig> . moreover, the control peptide f <dig>  lacking tyr <dig>  trp <dig> and leu <dig> could not bind efficiently to glutathione sepharose 4b beads .

the binding efficiencies of different peptides were determined according to the ratio of peptide concentrations after the binding and before the binding experiments. moreover, the peptide binding characteristics were determined again, after the peptides were eluted with the elution buffer.

results of the screening with the use of the cagf cloning method are consistent with the crystallographic data. the structure-function analysis has shown that gst contains one important binding site  for glutathione  <cit> . experiments based on kinetic and chemical modification techniques indicated that the active site might contain either his, cys, trp, arg, or asp  <cit> . the crystal structure indicates that gst binds two molecules of glutathione sulfonate at the g-site. several groups have investigated changes in amino acids involved in the formation of the g site of gst. the tyr <dig>  as one of the important components of the g site, is conserved in many mammalian gsts. tyr <dig> plays an essential role in stabilizing the thiolate anion of glutathione through hydrogen bonding. this residue was studied using site-directed mutagenesis, and when tyr was replaced by different amino acids, gst has lost at least 90% its specific activity  <cit> . our results with the cagf cloning method also suggest an important function of tyr <dig> in glutathione binding, therefore, the screening results are consistent with the crystallographic data.

the binding characteristics of f <dig> and f <dig> peptides
to determine the binding characteristics of selected peptides , an analysis of the interaction of synthesized peptides with glutathione sepharose 4b beads was performed using the scatchard method. the scatchard analysis is a method of linearizing data from the binding experiment in order to determine binding capacity. the ratio of specific binding and free concentrations was plotted against specific binding concentration. the maximum binding capacity bmax and dissociation constant kd of f <dig> and f <dig> peptides were determined. our results show that there are about  <dig>  f <dig> peptide and  <dig>  f <dig> peptide binding sites on glutathione sepharose 4b beads, and the disassociation constant of the f <dig> peptide is lover than that of the f <dig> peptide .

the experiments were performed according to the binding characteristics of f <dig> and f <dig> peptides to the glutathione sepharose 4b beads. the concentrations of bound and free peptides were determined following separation of the binding complexes by centrifugation, and the free peptide concentration in the supernatant was detected by the lowry method.

the binding efficiencies of f1-glutathione and f2-glutathione to gst were further confirmed by analysis of the binding of gst to the f <dig> peptide-glutathione sepharose 4b complex and the f <dig> peptide-glutathione sepharose 4b complex. the appropriate binding capacity bmax and dissociation constant kd values were determined. the results show that there are about  <dig>  gst binding sites for f <dig> peptide-glutathione sepharose 4b complex, and  <dig>  gst binding sites for f <dig> peptide-glutathione sepharose 4b complex. the disassociation constant of gst on f <dig> peptide-glutathione sepharose 4b complex was lower than that of gst on f <dig> peptide-glutathione sepharose 4b complex .

the experiments were performed according to the binding characteristics of gst with f <dig> peptide-glutathione sepharose 4b bead complex and f <dig> peptide-glutathione sepharose 4b bead complex. the concentrations of bound and free gst were determined after separation of complexes by centrifugation, and the free gst concentration in the supernatant was determined by the lowry method.

the inhibitory effects of selected peptides
the synthesized peptides f <dig> and f <dig> were used in the analysis of the efficiency of inhibition of gst activity . the inhibition efficiencies were as follows: tannic acid > cibacron blue > f <dig> peptide > hematin > f <dig> peptide > ethacrynic acid, with the use of cdnb or dcnb as the substrates. moreover, we could not find any significant inhibition of the gst activity using control peptides f <dig> or f <dig> 

experiments were performed using glutathione and cdnb or dcnb as substrates. the activity was determined as described in the methods section. mean values ± sd for triplicate determinations are shown. a unit of gst activity was defined as the formation of  <dig> μmol of the product per min under the conditions of the specific assay. specific activity is defined as the units of enzyme activity per mg of gst in the reaction system.

these results indicate that we have found an efficient gst inhibitor, the f <dig> peptide, which is more efficient than hematin . we also found another inhibitor of this reaction, the f <dig> peptide, which is more efficient than ethacrynic acid .

the inhibition characteristics of selected peptides
the inhibitory effects of selected f <dig> and f <dig> peptides on the gst-catalyzed reaction, using cdnb and glutathione as substrates, are shown in fig.  <dig>  peptides f <dig> and f <dig> inhibited the reaction in a dose-dependent manner, with 50% inhibitory concentrations of  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  μm, respectively.

to obtain information on the nature of the inhibition by f <dig> and f <dig> peptides, gst activity was measured with variable concentrations of glutathione. here, we applied a new model in describing enzyme inhibitor . it is possible that when the f <dig> or f <dig> peptide bound to the substrate glutathione, a peptide-glutathione complex was formed. because the concentration of the peptide inhibitor was significantly lower than the substrate  concentration, we assumed that the binding of the peptide inhibitor with glutathione will not significantly affect the substrate concentration. hence, the newly formed peptide-glutathione complex was considered as a new inhibitor. the concentration of the peptide-glutathione inhibitor is almost equal to the peptide concentration, thus, the michaelis-menten equation was used in the analysis.

the lineweaver-burk plot for glutathione as the variable peptide concentration was applied to determine the types of inhibition caused by f <dig> and f <dig> peptides. the plot provides a useful graphical method for analysis of the michaelis-menten equation. the effects of the peptide on gst-catalyzed reaction kinetics were determined by analysis of apparent vmax, inhibitor constant ki and /ki values. our results indicated that the f <dig> peptide exerted a noncompetitive inhibition in the gst-catalyzed reaction with the changing glutathione and f <dig> peptide concentrations  . however, the f <dig> peptide exerted a competitive inhibition in this reaction, with the changing glutathione and f <dig> peptide concentrations  .

the vmax, ki and /ki values for the f <dig> peptide were determined . the vmax value of the gst-catalyzed reaction was determined as  <dig> μmol/mg/min. however, in the presence of  <dig>  μm f <dig> peptide inhibitor, the vmax, ki and /ki values were determined as  <dig>  μmol/mg/min,  <dig>  μm and  <dig> , respectively. with the increasing f <dig> peptide concentrations, from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μm, the vmax value decreased from  <dig>  μmol/mg/min to  <dig>  μmol/mg/min, ki value increased from  <dig>  μm to  <dig>  μm, and /ki value increased from  <dig>  to  <dig> .

the km, ki and /ki values for the f <dig> peptide were also determined . the km value of the gst-catalyzed reaction was determined as  <dig>  mm. however, in the presence of  <dig>  μm f <dig> peptide inhibitor, the km, ki and /ki values were determined as  <dig>  mm,  <dig>  μm and  <dig> , respectively. with the increasing f <dig> peptide concentrations from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μm, the km value increased from  <dig>  mm to  <dig>  mm, ki value increased from  <dig>  μm to  <dig>  μm, and /ki value increased from  <dig>  to  <dig> .

moreover, with the changing concentrations of cdnb or dcnb, from  <dig>  mm to  <dig> mm, the kinetics of the gst-catalyzed reaction remained similar in the reaction system containing gst, glutathione and the inhibitor . therefore, we conclude that cdnb and dcnb cannot significantly affect the inhibition efficiency of f <dig> peptide or f <dig> peptide.

all these results show that effective non-competitive inhibitor f <dig> peptide and competitive inhibitor f <dig> peptide were found by using the cagf cloning method. although f <dig> and f <dig> peptides comprise only a small part of gst, they show significant inhibition efficiencies in the gst-catalyzed reaction.

discussion
the development of resistance to anticancer agents is a primary concern in cancer chemotherapy. in this light, it is obvious that the emergence of drugs, such as the gst inhibitors, able to overcome this resistance is a advancement  <cit> . therefore, it is of special interest to develop gst inhibitors able to enhance the therapeutic index of anticancer drugs. ethacrynic acid and quinine, which are both gst inhibitors, have been reported to reverse the resistance to melphalan and doxorubicin of cancer cell lines with increased gst expression  <cit> . in fact, ethacrynic acid has been used as an inhibitor of gst in vivo. however, first-generation gst inhibitors  were unsuccessful in clinical trials. this might be due to its lack of specific function for gst isozyme, and propensity to react with other chemicals. in addition, there caused a number of unwanted clinical side effects. therefore, more specific gst inhibitors may eliminate some of these undesirable features.

here, we used the cagf cloning method to find the gst fragments interacting with glutathione, which might be useful for the finding of gst inhibitors. we found two inhibitory peptide fragments, f <dig> peptide and f <dig> peptide. our results revealed that f <dig> peptide is a potent inhibitor of the reaction with ic <dig> of  <dig>  μm .

the putative inhibition mechanisms of actions of f <dig> and f <dig> peptide inhibitors are shown in fig.  <dig>  the f1-glutathione complex was found to be a non-competitive inhibitor, suggesting that the inhibitory binding site of f1-glutathione is different from the catalytic site of gst. an analysis of the crystal structure of gst and glutathione shows that the f <dig> peptide is located in the interior position of the g site . it may be difficult for f1-glutathione complex to dock into the catalytic site of gst. we assume that f1-glutathione complex may be docked into non-catalytic site of gst, affect the structure of catalytic site of gst, and cause the non-competitive inhibition.

on the other hand, the f <dig> peptide is located in the marginal position of the g site of gst . it may be easy for f2-glutathione complex to duck into the catalytic site of gst. we assume that the f2-glutathione complex may be docked into the g site of gst. thus, f2-glutathione may directly interfere with the catalytic site of gst and glutathione. since the f2-glutathione causes a competitive inhibition, the f <dig> peptide may be a good candidate for further studies on cancer chemomodulation.

the following mechanism was used to explain the inhibitory activity of gst fragment-substrate complexes on gst-catalyzed reaction. when the f <dig> or f <dig> peptide bound to the substrate glutathione, a peptide-glutathione complex was formed. although gst can convert glutathione into the reaction products, this enzyme cannot convert the peptide-glutathione inhibitor into the product. thus, the binding of the peptide-glutathione to gst can inactive the enzyme activity. we speculate that peptide-glutathione occupied the functional domain or affected the functional domain of gst. thus, gst-peptide-glutathione or gst-glutathione-peptide complex cannot catalyze the conversion of glutathione . here, the function of peptide-glutathione inhibitor is just like the substrate homologue or substrate-modifying inhibitor  <cit> .

in summary, we have determined two glutathione-binding fragments of the gst sequence, and found that the f <dig> peptide, selected by the cagf cloning method, can be considered as the inhibitor of gst. the f <dig> peptide is a potent inhibitor, stronger than hematin and ethacrynic acid, but weaker than tannic acid and cibacron blue. we suggest that the f <dig> peptide can be considered in applications against gst-induced multidrug resistance.

moreover, fig.  <dig> shows the scheme of the novel method in finding enzyme inhibitors. in the first step, the enzyme fragments which can bind with the substrate were screened to find the binding peptides. in the second step, the complexes of enzyme fragments and substrate were screened to find the enzyme inhibitor. we believe that this method can be used as a common tool for finding enzyme fragments that interact with a substrate, and subsequently for finding enzyme inhibitors.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have successfully found a f <dig> peptide as gst inhibitor with the novel screening method from gst sequence. our screening method should be useful for screening many different enzyme inhibitors.
