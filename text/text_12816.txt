BACKGROUND
genes are typically characterised by both assessing the phenotypic effects of the encoded gene product through its over- or ectopic-expression, and by detailing the temporal and spatial patterns of expression of the gene by linking its regulatory regions to a reporter gene. characterising gene products has been greatly facilitated by the availability of cloned full-length cdnas and open-reading frames  from public stock centres and commercial suppliers. these collections provide significant time- and cost-savings by obviating the need to independently clone cdnas for genes of interest; however, reliance on existing cdna collections and the use of cdna clones exclusively in gene characterisation studies has several limitations. firstly, current collections are not fully comprehensive, a consequence of the technical challenges of getting complete representation of the orfeome from all tissue types under all possible environmental conditions and physiological and developmental states. furthermore, certain transcripts may be low in abundance or may be of a size or sequence composition that inhibits cloning of full-length cdnas. as a result, many predicted genes identified by analysis of genome sequences are not represented in current cdna collections or are represented only by partial clones. secondly, assignment of gene functions based on the phenotypic effects caused by expression of a cdna may not accurately represent the phenotypic potential of the gene due to the possible regulatory effects of non-coding regions of the native gene. indeed, introns and untranslated regions  have been shown to encode small regulatory rnas or their binding-sites as well as the recognition sequences for rna-binding proteins which affect turnover and translation rates of mrna transcripts and their subcellular localisation  <cit> . in addition, intron processing and structural properties of utrs can affect mrna accumulation, translation, nuclear export and subcellular targeting  <cit> . with respect to the influence of utrs, the translation efficiency and tissue specificity of reporter genes in transgenic plants can be directly affected by the type of utr, as shown using the utrs from the small subunit of rubisco from amaranth and flaveria bidentis  <cit> . in addition, the 3' utr of soybean glutamine synthetase functions in transcript turnover and translation repression in both the leaves and nodules of transgenic alfalfa  <cit> . the involvement of the 5' utr of the maize alcohol dehydrogenase  <dig> gene in enhancing translation under stress conditions has also been demonstrated  <cit> . the influence of introns on gene expression has been shown using the first intron of the actin-depolymerising factor  <dig> gene of petunia and arabidopsis which can alter expression pattern and tissue specificity by a post-transcriptional mechanism  <cit> . there is also growing understanding of the diversity of gene products and phenotypic effects attributable to alternative splicing of pre-mrnas  <cit> . thus accurate interpretation of gene function can only be effectively obtained using genomic dna  clones comprising entire coding regions in expression studies with subsequent analysis of individual splice variants using corresponding cdnas. unfortunately, the routine use of gdna clones has been impeded by difficulties associated with their large size and its effect on cloning efficiency, as well as the availability and position of unique restriction enzyme sites to enable conventional cloning procedures.

the technical difficulties of working with gdna fragments have also impeded efforts to characterise gene regulatory regions. typically, only the  <dig> ' regulatory region  is assessed in such investigations by creating transcriptional fusions to a reporter gene  that is linked to a generic transcription terminator signal. this approach has been generally informative but may not result in the most accurate representation of gene expression patterns due to the use of non-cognate transcription terminators and 3' utr sequences that may lack important regulatory signals. therefore, the use of both the cognate 5' and 3' regulatory regions in expression studies using reporter genes is essential.

the time requirements and limitations of traditional in vitro cloning procedures have been significantly reduced through the development of the gateway cloning system  <cit>  and recombineering cloning  <cit> . the gateway system uses elements of the site-specific recombination system of bacteriophage lambda to enable inter-molecular transfer of dna fragments between vectors. assembly of gateway entry clones of dna fragments depends upon conventional in vitro cloning procedures. this system has been employed in large-scale cdna projects and compatible vectors have been developed for applications in many systems including plants where gateway vectors are available for the analysis of plant gene functions by ectopic overexpression, promoter-reporter fusions, affinity purification tags, rna interference, complementation analysis and gene stacking  <cit> . recombineering exploits homologous recombination functions in escherichia coli, such as the red recombination proteins of bacteriophage lambda, to enable cloning and modification of dna fragments in vivo. this system has been used to subclone or "rescue" gdna fragments as large as  <dig> kb from a bacterial artificial chromosome  into a standard plasmid vector  <cit> . recombineering is a powerful technique because it enables cloning of dna fragments independent of restriction enzymes or pcr-based manipulation of the dna fragment to be cloned. a significant limitation of recombineering is that transfer of dna fragments between different vectors is not as efficient as for the gateway system.

here we describe a system that combines features of the gateway and recombineering techniques. we demonstrate that a genomic coding region can be sub-cloned into a gateway entry vector from a bac using recombineering. we also show how gateway-compatible expression vectors that incorporate cognate 5' and 3' regulatory regions of a gene of interest can be created by using recombineering to substitute the coding region of a gene with gateway recombination sites. by incorporating the gus reporter gene adjacent to the regulatory regions of the arabidopsis pap <dig> gene we demonstrate this system enables accurate representation of gene expression patterns. the synergy in efficiency of gene cloning and manipulations achievable by combining gateway and recombineering techniques should greatly expedite gene characterisation studies at the single-gene and large-scale, genome-wide levels.

RESULTS
cloning of genomic coding regions
to illustrate the direct construction of gateway-based entry clones encoding genomic coding regions by recombineering we selected the arabidopsis abi <dig> gene. abi <dig> encodes a by-domain containing transcription factor that plays a central role in embryo and seed development as well as in regulating physiological responses to abiotic stress  <cit> . orthologues of abi <dig> with similar roles have been characterised in a variety of crop and tree species  <cit> . abi <dig> orthologues in wheat have been shown to produce at least seven different transcripts by alternative splicing  <cit>  and splice variants of an abi <dig> homologue from brassica napus, a close relative of arabidopsis, have also been detected . thus, to characterise the effects of overexpressing a particular gene in plants, the use of a single full-length cdna variant may not be the most informative as it will not represent the complete transcriptional repertoire of the gene and may incompletely reflect gene function.

the overall approach to cloning or "rescuing" gdna fragments from a bac to create a gateway entry clone is outlined in figure  <dig>  a bac encoding the gene of interest is first transformed into e. coli el <dig>  a strain deficient for host recombination functions to help ensure stability of the bac clone and which encodes the red homologous recombination functions of bacteriophage lambda under control of an inducible promoter  <cit> . the rescue-vector into which the gene sequence of interest is to be subcloned from the bac is then manipulated by pcr to incorporate sequences homologous to the 5' and 3' ends of the desired gene sequence. these "rescue-homology" sequences are  <dig> bp in length and are linked to "anchor sequences" which are unique to the rescue-vector. the rescue-homology sequences and anchor sequences should not possess homology to one another to prevent any recombination between the ends of the rescue-vector amplicon. in this system the rescue-vector is an entry vector of the gateway system that incorporates the phage lambda attl <dig> and attl <dig> site-specific recombination sites. the rescue-vector amplicon encoding the 5' and 3' rescue-homology sequences is then transformed into competent cells containing the target bac and the red recombination proteins. a recombination event involving gap-repair occurs between the ends of the rescue vector amplicon and the homologous regions flanking the desired gene encoded by the bac clone. these events are selected for by using a unique selectable marker on the rescue-vector. thus the system allows for direct construction of a gateway entry clone of a gdna subclone from a bac.

the bac clone f22p <dig> encoding abi <dig> is based on the pbelobac-km vector backbone  <cit>  which encodes the kanamycin-resistance  bacterial selectable marker. the pentr gateway vector series also utilise the kmr marker thus preventing direct selection of genomic fragments rescued from the bac. in addition, published gateway-based plant transformation vectors  <cit>  also primarily use the kmr selectable marker, again precluding selection of recombinants resulting from gene transfer from entry vectors to destination vectors. therefore, we created a pentr2b derivative, pjm <dig>  whereby the vector kmr marker is inactivated by insertion of a tetracycline-resistance  marker. tetracycline resistance is not used in common bac or plant transformation vectors and thus pjm <dig> should have broad applicability for rescuing gdna fragments from bac clones and enabling their efficient gateway-based transfer to a variety of expression vectors.

to rescue the abi <dig> coding region from bac f22p <dig>  pjm <dig> was amplified by pcr using the primers abi3-l1-rescue-5'cds and abi3-l2-rescue-3'cds  to incorporate the homology regions required to rescue the abi <dig> coding region from bac f22p <dig> into the vector. the unique anchor sequences for these primers in pjm <dig> were chosen to maintain the restriction sites in the multiple cloning site to enable future manipulation of the rescued gdna sequence by conventional methods, if required. the 5' rescue-homology region encodes  <dig> bp starting  <dig> bp upstream of the abi <dig> translation start codon, whereas the 3' rescue-homology region encompasses the sequence 329– <dig> bp 3' of the translation stop codon thereby including the entire 3' utr and predicted transcription termination signals of abi <dig> based on the annotated arabidopsis genome sequence ()  <cit> . the rescued fragment encoding abi <dig> is predicted to be  <dig> bp. despite the size and complexity of the abi3-rescue primers pcr amplification of the  <dig>  kb pjm <dig> was robust under standard conditions . the pjm <dig> rescue-vector amplicon was then transformed into competent e. coli el25/f22p <dig> cells induced to express red recombinase proteins and candidate clones were selected in the presence of tetracycline. from several hundred tetracycline-resistant colonies sixteen were screened by pcr to assess if the abi <dig> gene was rescued into pjm <dig>  the primer pairs were entry-l <dig> with abi3-5'-cds-rescue-3'-test, and entry-l <dig> with abi3-3'-term-rescue-5'-test combining a vector-specific with a gene-specific primer to assess if the 5' and 3' regions, respectively, of abi <dig> were present in candidate clones. as shown in figure  <dig>  pcr tests for  <dig> of  <dig> clones resulted in the predicted amplicons of  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb corresponding to the 5' and 3' regions, respectively, of the rescued abi <dig> coding region. four of the rescued abi <dig> clones were assessed by restriction enzyme digests using ecori and all possessed the predicted fragments of  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb representing abi <dig>  and  <dig>  kb representing pjm <dig> . one representative of the four clones was sequenced and shown to encode the sequence of the abi <dig> coding region predicted to be subcloned. this clone was designated pwy <dig> 

1upper-case letters correspond to unique recognition sequences in pjm <dig> and lower-case letters correspond to  <dig> bp regions homologous to abi <dig> 

2upper-case letters correspond to unique recognition sequences in pwy <dig> and pwy <dig> and lower-case letters correspond to  <dig> bp regions homologous to pap <dig> 

3upper-case letters correspond to unique recognition sequences in the rfa-destination cassette of pmw138- <dig> and lower-case letters correspond to  <dig> bp regions homologous to pap <dig> 

this approach for cloning gdna coding regions takes only  <dig> days from the initial transformation of the e. coli el <dig> bac strain with the rescue-vector amplicon to confirmation of the candidate clones by pcr. the primers used to incorporate rescue-homology were large but did not require purification so overall expense was minimal. although the vector is amplified by pcr using a high-fidelity polymerase, mutation could occur during the amplification; however, the cloning system directly selects for function of essential vector components . the in vivo gap repair mechanism for rescuing the specified fragment involves the host e. coli dna replication and proofreading machinery; thus the sequence fidelity of the rescued fragment should routinely be very high. therefore using this system, no cost or delay is typically required for sequencing the clone as is generally required when a pcr step is used to incorporate restriction enzyme sites to enable conventional cloning of a dna fragment. the system is also independent of the requirement for full-length cdna clones to enable expression of genes and circumvents the need to clone and express individual splice-variants to assess functions of a gene.

cloning of coding regions and cognate regulatory sequences for construction of gateway-based expression vectors
cloning of gdna fragments including the coding region and cognate regulatory elements of a gene of interest is often required in gene identification and characterisation studies. for example, in mutant complementation studies, more accurate representation of the native gene expression level achievable by using genomic clones is beneficial to identifying the correct gene; in contrast, using a candidate cdna linked to a constitutive promoter may cause pleiotropic effects that can confound interpreting complementation results. assessing the temporal and spatial expression patterns of a gene by linking its regulatory regions to reporter genes is also a central component of gene characterisation. a system for direct cloning of gdna fragments from bacs into a plant transformation vector and creating expression constructs for reporter gene fusions by recombineering is outlined in figure  <dig>  the process is very similar to that described above for rescuing gene coding regions into a gateway entry vector . the distinction here is that the gene including its 5' and 3' regulatory sequences are rescued directly into a plant transformation vector to expedite assembly of a plant transformation construct. this construct can then be directly converted to a gateway-based expression construct by substituting the protein encoding region of the cloned gene for a cassette containing site-specific recombination sites . in this way, reporter or other genes may be efficiently linked to both the 5' and 3' regulatory regions. analysis of transgenic lines using such a reporter construct is anticipated to more faithfully represent the expression pattern of a gene than if a generic 3' regulatory region is used.

subcloning of gdna regions from bacs by recombineering requires pcr amplification of the plant transformation vector to incorporate the  <dig> bp of 5' and 3' rescue-homology regions. the majority of existing plant transformation vectors are quite large  and therefore may not amplify well using pcr. in addition, plant transformation vectors typically use kmr selection in bacteria which is problematic for the gene rescue system developed here since many plant bac libraries also use the same selection. we thus developed compact plant transformation vectors with unique features for use in our gene-rescue system. the base vector was pcb <dig> which is a  <dig>  kb derivative of pbin <dig> created by combining the minimal essential elements required for a binary plant transformation vector  <cit> . the kmr marker of pcb <dig> was inactivated by insertion of the aad <dig> gene from enterococcus faecalis which confers spectinomycin-resistance  to e. coli and agrobacterium tumefaciens. the resulting construct was designated pnml <dig>  the spr marker is compatible with the selection used for bac vectors, and is different from the selection used for existing gateway entry vectors which employ kmr selection. pnml <dig> was modified to create the gene-rescue vectors pwy <dig> and pwy <dig> which incorporate either the nptii or pat gene, respectively, within the t-dna region to function as selectable markers in plants. this pair of gene-rescue vectors provide options for selection when experiments require complementation of t-dna insertion-mutant alleles of arabidopsis which may already possess kmr or phosphinothricin-resistance due to the presence of the nptii or pat genes, respectively, in the mutagenic t-dna cassette . the plant selectable markers of pwy <dig> and pwy <dig> are linked to the entcup <dig> promoter which is active in arabidopsis and several other dicot species  <cit> . use of this unique promoter should minimise interference with the expression of selectable markers or activation-tagged genes resident in arabidopsis t-dna insertion lines which typically employ the camv35s promoter .

to illustrate the direct rescue of a gene and its regulatory regions into a plant transformation vector and subsequent conversion to a gateway-compatible expression vector we selected the arabidopsis pap <dig> gene which encodes a vicilin-like seed storage protein  <cit> . bac f18c <dig>  encoding pap <dig> was transformed into e. coli el <dig>  the rescue-vector pwy <dig> was amplified by pcr using the primers pap85-rescue-5'-prom and pap85-rescue-3'-term to incorporate the  <dig> bp homology regions to rescue pap <dig> from the bac. these primers encode unique anchor sequences common to both pwy <dig> and pwy <dig>  the rescue-homology regions correspond to sequences  <dig> bp 5' of the translation start codon of pap <dig> and  <dig> bp 3' of the translation stop codon resulting in a predicted rescued fragment of  <dig> bp. the pwy <dig> amplicon was transformed into e. coli el250/f18c <dig> competent cells induced to express the red recombination proteins and candidate clones were selected using spectinomycin. three colonies were obtained and tested by pcr for the presence of the rescued pap <dig> fragment in pwy <dig> using the vector-specific primers pcb-rb and tcup2-out in combination with the gene-specific primers pap85-prom-rescue-3'-test and pap85-term-rescue-5'-test, respectively. two clones were positive for the pcr test and produced the  <dig>  kb amplicons corresponding to the 5' and 3' ends, respectively, of the rescued gene in pwy <dig> . one clone was characterised by restriction enzyme digestion using bamhi and was found to contain the predicted  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb fragments. the clone was designated pwy <dig> 

this approach to subclone gdna fragments directly into a plant vector can be accomplished in two days, requires little hands-on time and is completely independent of the need for unique restriction sites in the vector or sequence to be cloned. while the region encoding pap <dig> described here was  <dig>  kb, sequences of up to  <dig> kb have also been cloned using this system . therefore this system is flexible enough to enable subcloning of small to large genomic fragments.

to illustrate development of gateway expression vectors encoding cognate 5' and 3' regulatory regions, the coding region of pap <dig> in pwy <dig> was replaced with the gateway rfa-destination cassette using recombineering. the rfa-destination cassette encodes a chloramphenicol-resistance  marker and the ccdb gene which is toxic to most laboratory strains of e. coli; therefore, the strain db <dig>  was used in all subsequent manipulations. e. coli db <dig>  was co-transformed with pwy <dig> and pkd <dig> which encodes the bacteriophage lambda red homologous recombination functions regulated by arabinose induction and possesses a temperature sensitive origin of replication  <cit> . the rfa-destination cassette was amplified by pcr using the primers pap85-integ-dest-5' and pap85-integ-dest-3' which possess anchor sequences unique to the attr <dig> and attr <dig> sites of the cassette and  <dig> bp that is homologous to the sequence immediately 5' or 3' of the translation start and stop codon of pap <dig>  respectively. the rfa-destination cassette amplicon was transformed into e. coli db <dig> /pwy189/pkd <dig> induced to express the red homologous recombination proteins and candidate clones selected in the presence of chloramphenicol and spectinomycin. several hundred colonies were obtained and candidate clones were then screened by pcr for correct integration of the rfa-destination cassette into pwy <dig> using the cassette-specific primers cm-5'-as <dig> and c <dig> in combination with the gene-specific primers pap85-dest-integ-5'-test and pap85-dest-integ-3'-test, respectively. two of  <dig> candidates were found to be correct as indicated by the amplification of a  <dig>  kb fragment representing the fusion between the pap <dig> promoter and the attr <dig> end of rfa-destination cassette and a  <dig>  kb fragment representing the fusion between the pap <dig> terminator and the attr <dig> end . one clone was designated pwy <dig>  restriction analysis indicated that the strain containing pwy <dig> also retained the parent plasmid pwy <dig> . this is likely due to the stability of the r <dig> origin of replication present on these plasmids. to eliminate pwy <dig> and to prepare a strain containing only pwy <dig>  a plasmid dna preparation was digested with blpi whose recognition site is unique to the pap <dig> coding region and is thus unique to pwy <dig>  the mixture was then transformed into db <dig>  and clones selected in the presence of spectinomycin. fifteen colonies were screened by pcr for the presence of pwy <dig> using the primers pap85-dest-integ-3'-test and c <dig> and the absence of pwy <dig> using the primers pap85-dest-integ-3'-test and pap85-s <dig>  eight isolates were found to possess only pwy <dig> . three of these were examined by restriction digestion using bamhi and all possessed the expected restriction fragments of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb . pwy <dig> was sequenced and found to contain the exact predicted sequence of the 5' and 3' regulatory regions of pap <dig> fused to the rfa-destination cassette. thus, our system represents a rapid method for developing expression constructs that are gateway compatible. a distinct feature of this system is the ability to easily maintain both the 5' and 3' regulatory elements of a gene in the expression construct to help ensure that reporter-gene experiments more accurately reflect the expression properties of the gene under study.

application of recombineering-gateway system to characterising gene expression profiles using promoter-reporter transgene constructs
to enable reporter gene studies with this system we constructed a pap85::gus reporter construct designated as psw <dig>  this construct was used to transform arabidopsis and transgenic plants were analysed for gus expression to assess tissue specificity and developmental regulation of pap <dig> 

histochemical analysis of gus activity in t <dig> plants revealed that pap <dig> is predominantly expressed in the embryo and endosperm of developing seeds . in embryos, gus activity began to be detectable at  <dig> days post anthesis . strong gus activity persisted throughout subsequent stages of embryo development . the cotyledons and embryo axis appeared uniformly stained in all stages where gus activity was detected, demonstrating pap <dig> is broadly expressed in embryonic tissues. strong and uniform gus activity was also observed in the endosperm . no gus activity was detected in the embryos at  <dig> dpa or  <dig> dpa  nor in floral tissues . in young seedlings, gus activity was strictly confined to the cotyledons, hypocotyl and root tip . gus activity in the root tip persisted for 3– <dig> days after germination and was not detectable at later stages . in expanded new leaves gus activity was detected only in the trichomes; however, this activity was not detected in mature leaves. collectively, these results precisely define the spatio-temporal expression pattern of the pap <dig> promoter in arabidopsis. these results are in good agreement with the transcript abundance profile of pap <dig>  obtained by querying the atgenexpress visualisation tool () encompassing microarray analysis of an extensive collection of arabidopsis tissues and developmental stages  <cit>  and also with the pap <dig> expression pattern during silique development reported by parcy et al.  <cit> . thus our system enables development of gene expression constructs that encode the regulatory sequences required to accurately represent the expression profile of the native gene. our analysis of pap <dig> also provides novel insight to its expression properties over the data currently publicly available with the higher-resolution reporter gene study presented here.

CONCLUSIONS
gene expression and phenotypes result from a combination of effects of classical upstream promoter elements and terminator sequences, as well as regulatory elements encoded by the 5'- and 3'-utrs and introns  <cit> . discovery of these effects may not be achieved when cdnas and generic regulatory elements are used in gene expression studies or when only 5'-regulatory regions are used in reporter-gene studies. we anticipate that the system and plasmids described herein that employ a combination of gateway and recombineering techniques should greatly expedite cloning and manipulation of gdna fragments and enhance efforts in gene characterisation.
