BACKGROUND
human solid tumors harbor various types of chromosomal alterations, many of which play a role in the initiation and progression of the disease  <cit> . as a major category of chromosomal alterations, dna copy number alterations  that represent chromosomal gains or losses have been extensively investigated in cancer research. many cnas can affect the function or structure of cancer-related genes and are associated with causative molecular mechanisms in carcinogenesis. thus, a comprehensive catalogue of cnas in a given tumor type is an important step in understanding the underlying carcinogenic mechanisms and in highlighting potential biomarkers with diagnostic or therapeutic implications.

in recent years, high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization  has become a standard platform for identification of cnas in a genome-scale and great progress has been made in profiling of cancer-related chromosomal alterations with improved spatial resolution  <cit> . in spite of the many successes, array-cgh has several limitations inherent in hybridization-based techniques, such as noise due to cross-hybridization between probe and target sequences as well as a limited and nonlinear dynamic range. in addition, the resolution and genome coverage of an array-cgh platform are dependent on a fixed set of probes, making it difficult to identify novel alterations below a given size  <cit> .

the first use of sequencing data in genome-wide identification of cnas was digital karyotyping  <cit> . its utility, however, was limited by the cost of conventional sanger sequencing method. fortunately, the recent arrival of next-generation sequencing technology has altered the situation dramatically. this technology allows large-scale sequencing data to be generated with significantly lower cost and higher throughput  <cit> . although the advantage of this sequencing technology has been already shown in a wide spectrum of genomic applications  <cit> , more accurate and robust methods are needed for identification of copy number alterations for the large amount of whole-genome sequencing data that will be generated in the near future.

there are two classes of methods for copy number assessment, both based on the assumption that the local density of sequenced reads is proportional to the copy number. the first is to estimate copy number in a single sample, typically to identify copy number variation  of a non- diseased individual . in this case, a 'read depth' can be measured for non-overlapping genomic windows and used to identify cnvs with respect to a reference genome. this strategy has been addressed elsewhere  <cit> , but it is complicated by other factors, such as local gc content, that affect the read density significantly. the second class of methods is to estimate copy number in one genome compared to its control, typically in a disease tissue versus a normal tissue from the same individual. this has the advantage of controlling for patient-specific cnvs, thus shifting the focus to somatic alterations. the disadvantage is that the number of experiments required is doubled. in this study, we propose a method for the second case in which sequencing reads are available for two matched genomes. we focus on cancer genomes here, but it can be applied to comparison of any two genomes.

with the sequencing data from the tumor and its paired normal genomes, cnas are characterized by a disproportionately higher number of tumor reads  or normal reads . theoretically, the spatial resolution and the dynamic range of the detected copy number changes are limited only by the sequencing depth, unlike in the fixed resolution of the array-cgh platforms. the approach we take is based on a modification of the smith-waterman algorithm  <cit> . this idea was previously proposed for analysis of array-cgh  <cit> . here, we adapt it for sequencing data and introduce further improvements. in simulation tests, our method is able to detect even a single copy change in a region with high sensitivity and precision. to identify a set of alterations in a multilayered configuration with different copy numbers, we propose a recursive version of the method called rsw-seq . we compare our method with a previously published algorithm segseq  <cit> , using simulated and publicly available sequencing data.

RESULTS
we start with sequencing datasets obtained from a tumor and its matched normal genomes. under the null hypothesis of no copy number difference, a genomic segment would have an expected read ratio close to /. a read ratio showing substantial deviation from this expected ratio would be indicative of copy number alterations. one simple approach is to use a moving-window to generate read ratios along the genome, analogous to the probe-specific intensity ratios in conventional array-cgh profiles. then, a known segmentation algorithm designed for array-cgh data can be applied  <cit> . however, this is computationally expensive for the sequencing data and does not take full advantage of the data. alternatively, one can use the density of reads to determine whether the ratio is significantly different from  <dig> for each window based, for instance, on the normal or poisson distribution. then the neighboring windows with significant amplification or deletion can be joined together. a sliding window of fixed width is simplest, but because this results in unstable ratios in regions with small read counts, a window may be defined by a fixed number of reads in the normal sample. non-overlapping windows are typically used, as this makes tests in adjacent regions independent and reduces the computational burden; but overlapping windows can be also used, especially to generate a smoothed profile. segseq, a recently proposed sequencing-based algorithm, utilizes windows defined by a predefined number of normal reads to detect breakpoints between cnas  <cit> . a major disadvantage of window-based approaches, however, is that the window size must be determined a priori, and that the overall performance of the algorithm is influenced strongly by that value. for example, a larger window size enhances the confidence level of cnas identified  <cit> , but too large a window sacrifices spatial resolution. the method we propose below avoids having to define a window.

description of the algorithm
the sequencing reads from tumor and matched normal genome are combined and sorted in a non-decreasing order according to their genomic positions . the reads from tumor and normal genomes are distinguished and assigned different weight values of wt and wn, respectively. when the number of reads for the tumor and normal samples  are equal, they are assigned equal weight but with different signs . otherwise, , the weights for tumor and normal reads are set given the nt and nn  and wn = - <dig> × nt/) this equalizes the total sum of wt and −wn, making the sum of all wt and wn to be zero. thus, the sequencing data from tumor and matched normal genome is converted into a one-dimensional vector of wt and wn, amenable to an algorithm for pattern detection.

the main idea of our method is that a large local positive or negative cumulative sum in this vector of weight values indicates a local copy number gain or loss, respectively. as shown in figure 1a, the local copy number gain  results in an upward slope of the cumulative sum. to identify the alterations and to map the boundaries accurately and rapidly in this cumulative sum profile, we propose to use the smith-waterman algorithm. this algorithm was originally developed to determine highly conserved, consecutive nucleotides in the local sequence alignment problem  <cit> . the use of the smith-waterman algorithm for copy number analysis was previously proposed by price et al.  <cit>  for array-cgh data in their sw-array algorithm. we have found that this algorithm is also suitable for copy number estimation from sequencing data with appropriate modifications. thus, in this work, we have adopted the modified smith-waterman algorithm to map the copy number changes.

in this method, the tumor-specific copy number gains and losses are identified separately. assume that the reads on a chromosome are r <dig> = ,...,rn = , where wj and sj are the weight and the mapped location associated with the read rj, respectively. since the short reads are ordered, we have s <dig> ≤ s <dig> ≤⋯≤ sn for copy number gain, the algorithm searches for the segment  such that the partial cumulative sum s=∑j=lmwj is maximized. then we iterate until no more alternation can be found.

specifically, let l <dig> =  <dig> and lk+1=min{l≥lk:s=∑j=lklwj<0}+ <dig>  i.e., lk+ <dig> -1is the first index after lk such that. s <  <dig>  suppose that after certain k ≥  <dig>  we have s ≥  <dig> for all l ≥ lk. denote lk+ <dig> = n +  <dig>  we then let mk = argmax {s, m ∈ }, i.e., mk is the index between lk and lk+ <dig> such that s is maximized. then, the partial cumulative sums s will be maximized at some k <dig> ∈ { <dig> ...,k}. one can show that the segment  is the maximum segment  that maximizes the partial cumulative sum s=∑j=lmwj over all  <dig> ≤ l ≤ m ≤ n . the algorithm rsw-seq just iteratively searches for lk and mk, starting from l <dig> =  <dig>  once the maximum segment  is identified, the region will be reported as a copy gain region if s> <dig>  then, the algorithm will mask this region, i.e., setting the weights wjof the reads in this region to be zero, and search for the next copy gain region until no further copy gain region can be identified. for copy number losses, the same method can be applied to the original array of weight values with the signs inverted for wt and wn. the pseudo-code for detecting positive-scoring segment is available in methods. in practice, one does not scan the whole chromosome again for the next region of interest; instead, a ranked list of candidates  is kept and only the neighborhood of the identified variant is scanned again.

in figure  <dig>  the cumulative sum s should be close to zero in the regions of no copy number changes. however, a noisy distribution of reads might lead to a fluctuating pattern of local s and increase false positives in the selection of positive-scoring segments. to make the algorithm robust to noise, we subtract a predefined threshold level t from the weight values wt and wn globally. this adjustment gives a negative slope to regions with no copy number changes in the cumulative sum plot while maintaining the positive slope of the copy number gains . this preprocessing helps to minimize the false positives without losing accuracy in mapping the boundaries of true copy number alterations. this point is illustrated with an example in the next section.

simulation tests
to measure the performance of the algorithm, we generated a set of  <dig> mb artificial chromosomes on which  <dig> million random reads are mapped . the dependency of the algorithm on different sequencing depths is discussed later. we assume that the same numbers of virtual reads  are derived from the tumor and normal genomes. the tumor reads are positioned to generate regions of copy number ratios 3/ <dig> or 1/ <dig>  corresponding to a single copy number of gain or loss, respectively. the single copy alterations were selected for the performance test since they represent the minimal ratio difference between tumor and normal reads, making them the most difficult to find. different alteration sizes  were simulated with  <dig> artificial chromosomes for each size category.

first, we tested the algorithm for a wide range of t threshold values  and compared the identified candidate cnas with the predefined alterations. the performance of the algorithm at different t levels was measured in terms of sensitivity  and precision  . we selected these measures to reflect two critical aspects of the algorithm's performance:  what percentage of known  alterations is correctly identified by the algorithm  and  what percentage of identified alterations by the algorithm are true positives . specificity, the percentage of non-altered regions correctly identified as such, is not as meaningful in this context because the non-altered regions comprise a very large fraction of the genome and specificity becomes less sensitive. without any adjustment , single copy gains and losses larger than  <dig> kb were identified with >90% sensitivity but the precision level was very low, indicating a high rate of false positives. with different t levels, a clear trade-off between sensitivity and precision was observed, as the increase in threshold improves precision at the expense of sensitivity. a balanced performance was obtained at t level around  <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively. at these t levels , the algorithm achieved >90% sensitivity and >60% precision in detecting  <dig> kb single copy gains and >80% sensitivity and >80% precision levels for 50-kb single copy losses. for single copy gains, the smaller threshold values  are not sufficient in filtering out false positives and results in low precision; higher values , on the other hand, are associated with low sensitivity level. we note that the optimal threshold values found here are about half of the threshold values that make the local s of single copy gains and losses zero . for example, consider a single copy gain with nt  and nn  with read ratio  of 3/ <dig>  the t value that makes the sum of weight values to be zero can be calculated by an equation: wt × nt + wn × nn -t ×  =  <dig>  if wt =  <dig> and wn = - <dig> , the t is  <dig> , the half of which is the empirically determined optimal tgain. for real data sets, this is a reasonable way to determine the initial value of t.

we further measured the effect of different t levels in the accuracy of boundary mapping . both for the single copy gains and losses, the boundaries of observed alterations detected at lower t level tend to fall outside the predefined boundaries, while the opposite is true for higher t levels. in case of single copy gains, tgain =  <dig>  also showed the highest accuracy in boundary mapping:  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kb for start and end boundaries, respectively, with little dependence on the alteration size. for single copy losses, the accuracy range of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kb for start and end boundaries was observed at tloss of  <dig> .

because this algorithm involves scanning along the chromosomes, it may not give the same results when scanned in different directions. to check whether our method is robust with respect to scanning orientation, we applied the method in both directions at tgain of  <dig>  and tloss of  <dig> . among the observed gains identified by left-to-right scanning,  <dig> % were recovered with the exactly the same boundaries as by right-to-left scanning. this coincident rate for boundary mapping was much higher when considering only true positives . in case of losses, most of the observed losses  showed matching boundaries in both scanning directions.

the sw-score, which we define to be the local sum of wt and wn in an identified segment, can be used to rank identified regions. but this is biased toward a larger segment, which has a higher probability of generating a high score. thus, we also introduce another measure of significance for each segment as an alternative or additional filter: the probability of finding the observed or more extreme distribution of tumor and normal reads in the identified region given the total number of tumor and normal reads. this can be done by assuming that the read density follows the poisson or normal distribution. we adapt a statistical method previously described for differential analysis of sequencing tags based on the poisson distribution  <cit>  . to see the effects of the additional screening, the alterations identified at tgain of  <dig>  and tloss of  <dig>  were filtered by their sw-scores  or significance levels . the use of stringent cutoffs in both measures tends to increase precision when detecting small alterations while maintaining the sensitivity levels of large alterations . in detecting single copy number gains, for instance, the use of score threshold of  <dig> or significance of 10- <dig> was optimal, showing >90% sensitivity and >90% precision in detecting  <dig> kb copy number gains. the similar performance level was observed in detecting  <dig> kb single copy number losses at the same significance cutoff .

because the algorithm is dependent on relative tag density only, we expect that the regions with similar read numbers can be identified at a similar performance level regardless of their physical length. to test this, we simulated  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb single copy gains with  <dig> million and  <dig> million virtual reads in  <dig> mb artificial chromosomes . the sw-score cutoff  <dig> gave consistent performance level  for the simulated alterations that are expected to have approximately  <dig> reads for the normal sample.

to further investigate dependency on different sequencing depth and to compare the results with segseq  <cit> , we performed simulation tests that accounts for read mappability. different sizes  of single copy gains and losses were simulated on human chromosome  <dig> , in which random  <dig> bp reads were selected with varying sequencing depth  and aligned back to the genome. in this simulation, both algorithms show comparable sensitivity level with each other in detecting various sized alterations . the sensitivity level is dependent upon the alteration size and sequencing depth for both algorithms, e.g., rsw-seq and segseq both showed >90% of sensitivity at detecting  <dig> kb alterations with  <dig> million reads in simulated chromosome . with low sequencing depth , rsw-seq showed improved precision, indicative of low false positive rates compared to segseq .

complex alterations and recursive sw-seq 
simulations of a single, isolated alteration in a chromosome does not fully represent the complexity of alterations commonly observed in a real cancer genome. for example, the high amplifications or homozygous deletions of well-known cancer-related genes such as egfr and cdkn2a frequently occur within low-level chromosomal gains or losses, rather than in isolation. a simple chromosomal scan might miss such embedded high copy number changes, which frequently harbor important cancer-related genes. to distinguish these focal amplifications, the algorithm described above can be applied in a recursive manner by exploiting the fact that focal amplification is a relative copy number gain with respect to the single copy gain background.

thus, using the single copy gain as a template, the recursive sw-seq  can identify a focal, high-level amplification.

to test this, we simulated  <dig> mb single copy gains  containing a smaller  two copy gain  in  <dig> mb artificial chromosomes. the alteration found in the first scan was used as template for the second scan of the algorithm. the performance of the second scan in identifying the implanted two copy gains was measured with different tgain levels . the  <dig> kb two copy gains were identified at >80% sensitivity and >80% precision at tgain  <dig> . the smaller copy number ratio  is responsible for the smaller tgain compared to the threshold level required for detecting single copy gain . focal homozygous deletions  nested in single copy number losses  were also simulated and tested for the performance . in this case, the decrease in sensitivity level was not observed with higher tloss level, possibly due to the absence of tumor reads in the homozygous deletion. the use of tloss  <dig>  was able to detect all tested sizes of homozygous deletions with >90% sensitivity and >90% precision.

we also simulated a set of complex alterations that contain  <dig> single copy gains  and a single copy loss  as well as  <dig> high-level amplification  and homozygous deletion  in a single profile . rsw-seq was able to identify focal high-level amplification and homozygous deletion separately from their nested larger single copy gain and loss. we also note that a small region with no copy number change that separates large single copy gain can be identified as an isolated alteration, e.g., single copy loss with respect to single copy gain. the observed alterations found in  <dig> recursive tests were compared with the simulated alterations with the matched copy numbers to measure the performance of rsw-seq . not surprisingly, it shows that the performance of rsw-seq at identifying multilayered alterations is highly influenced by the copy number differences in the nested alterations, e.g., relatively poor performance for high-level amplification  nested in single copy gain .

the performance of rsw-seq in real sequencing data
to test the performance of the algorithm in real sequencing data, we applied rsw-seq to the sequencing data initially analyzed by segseq  <cit> . this dataset contained three pairs of cancer- derived cell lines , each of which was comprised of  <dig> -  <dig> million reads. the dataset also includes genomic profiles generated on the same samples using high-resolution array-cgh platform  that can be used for comparison. rsw-seq was applied using the t levels determined in simulation tests and a score cutoff of  <dig>  then we compared the results of rsw-seq with those of segseq for segments corresponding to copy number gains  and losses  in each of the three cell lines for the total of six comparisons . we found a high level of concordance  between the segmentation results of rsw-seq and segseq, where the concordance was defined as the fraction of overlapping region identified by the two methods over the total segments size found in either method. when the results are compared with independent segmentation results obtained from affymetrix array-cgh, rsw-seq showed higher concordance rates as compared with segseq in  <dig> out of  <dig> comparisons.

aconcordance rate was measured between the results of rsw-seq and segseq, and is defined as /. bconcordance rate is /.

the individual chromosomal profiles obtained by rsw-seq and segseq are notably similar . for example, in chromosome  <dig> in the tumor cell line hcc <dig>  two methods show similar profiles overall, which is also consistent with array-cgh results . a focal amplification residing at ~ <dig> mb of chromosome  <dig>  contains well-known cancer genes fgf <dig>  fgf <dig> and ccnd <dig> and appears as a dominant peak in read ratios both for rsw-seq and segseq as compared to the hybridization-based intensity ratio. such is indicative of the higher dynamic range of the sequencing-based measures, as previously shown for erbb <dig> amplification in the same dataset hcc <dig>  <cit> . for the  <dig> high-level amplifications by segseq showing read ratio > <dig> , all were recovered by rsw-seq. there are some differences in the two profiles as well. one is a high-level amplification identified by rsw-seq on 14q <dig> in hcc <dig> . this amplification is supported by the array-cgh profile and it contains loci for breast cancer-related signaling molecule akt <dig>  <cit>  in this breast cancer cell line. with respect to candidates for homozygous deletions, three loci in h <dig> were coincident between rsw-seq and segseq . but rsw-seq also identified  <dig> additional candidates for homozygous deletions in hcc- <dig>  which include cancer-related genes such as trappc6b , aml <dig> and runx <dig> , worthy of further investigation.

it should be noted that our simulation tests above are based on idealized copy number ratios for cnas, e.g., 3/ <dig> of tumor and normal read ratio for single copy gain. considering the tissue heterogeneity in tumors, this is unlikely to be true in actual data. it is possible that the methods used here for cell line-derived data may require additional optimization for analysis of sequencing data from primary cancer cells.

CONCLUSIONS
we have proposed rsw-seq as an iterative method that can be used to discover cnas efficiently, including those in a complex configuration. among the methods for single-end read-based copy number analysis  <cit> , segseq and rsw-seq are similar in that they are designed to make cna calls by direct comparison of tumor and paired normal genomes  <cit> . one key difference, however, is that segseq first identifies the potential breakpoints  and merges neighboring windows to obtain candidate segments, while rsw-seq directly captures potential cnas as regions with substantial bias in tumor vs normal reads counts . global algorithms such as rsw-seq are more likely to perform better at detecting larger or more subtle cnas, for which point-centric algorithms might miss boundaries that do not show clear differences in read density. in our simulation, rsw-seq showed improved performance compared to segseq . an important advantage of rsw-seq also is that a window size, which can change the results substantially for segseq, does not need to be specified. however, the performance of the algorithms in real datasets remains to be studied more extensively. most likely, these methods should complement each other in making reliable calls for candidate cnas. when the data consists of paired-end reads , the algorithms  <cit>  designed for such data should also provide complementary information.

as next-generation sequencing becomes more widely available, more whole-genome sequencing data will be generated for cancer studies. rsw-seq provides a solution for effective screening of cancer-specific cnas for better understanding of the tumor biology and discovery of biomarkers.
