BACKGROUND
arabinogalactan proteins  are a class of extracellular glycoproteins consisting of a core protein backbone and diverse type-ii arabinogalactan  polysaccharide chains made up of galactan and arabinose  <cit> . typical agp molecular weights range from  <dig> to 300 kda. the protein backbones are usually rich in proline/hydroxyproline, alanine, serine, and threonine , with the hydroxyproline o-glycosylated by peripheral ag side chains that determine macromolecular heterogeneity  <cit> . agps are classified into several subclasses based on their core protein structures: classical agps, lys-rich agps, ag peptides, non-classical agps, and chimeric agps  <cit> . according to their domain constitutions, chimeric agps can be further divided into three subclasses: fasciclin-like agps   <cit> , xylogen-like proteins   <cit> , and phytocyanin-like agps   <cit> . previous researchers have identified  <dig> agps in rice, including  <dig> classical agps,  <dig> ag peptides,  <dig> lys-rich agps,  <dig> flas,  <dig> phytocyanin-like agps, and  <dig> non-classical agps  <cit> . agps can selectively bind to a synthetic dye, β-glucosyl yariv reagent . although the precise underlying mechanism is unclear, this binding requires the presence of both the protein and ag chains. β-glcy binding ability can thus be used as a distinguishing standard to identify agps  <cit> . many studies on the biological function of agps have been performed using β-glcy and polyclonal antibodies such as jim <dig>  jim <dig>  jim <dig>  lm <dig>  and ccrc-m <dig>  <cit> . agps have been reported to be involved in various plant growth and developmental processes, such as cell expansion  <cit> , cell proliferation  <cit> , programmed cell death  <cit> , cell wall plasticization  <cit> , hormone response  <cit> , salt tolerance  <cit> , xylem differentiation  <cit> , root growth and development  <cit> , female and male gametogenesis  <cit> , pollen tube growth  <cit> , and zygotic division and embryo development  <cit> .

plant non-specific lipid-transfer proteins , which are abundant small basic proteins that can transfer phospholipids between membranes, were first isolated from spinach leaves as phospholipid-binding proteins  <cit> . the lipid-binding properties of nsltps are derived from a unique structure: a region of eight strictly conserved cysteine residues. the eight cysteines bind to one another to form four disulfide bridges that give rise to a three-dimensional structure containing an internal hydrophobic cavityable to firmly bind lipids  <cit> . xylogen, a 25–300-kda glycoprotein, mediates local intercellular communication and is essential for tracheary element  differentiation in in vitro zinnia elegans xylogenic culture  <cit> . xylogen is secreted from differentiating vascular cells and promotes the transformation of adjacent undifferentiated cells into tes; it has a unique structure including agp domains and an nsltp domain, as typical structure of chimeric agps  <cit> . in a previous bioinformatic analysis of xylogen-type proteins in arabidopsis  <cit> ,  <dig> atxylp  genes with significant similarity to zexyp <dig> were identified and their expression profiles were analyzed.

genome-wide analysis is a useful strategy for the elucidation of biological functions of the xylp gene family. in this study, we identified  <dig> xylp genes in the rice  genome and conducted a phylogenetic analysis. to obtain further information about osxylp gene expression patterns, we evaluated publicly available resources such as microarray and massively parallel signature sequencing  databases. we then validated the digital expression data obtained for these genes through quantitative real-time pcr . in addition, we identified the knockout mutants of osxylp <dig> and osxylp <dig> and found that osxylp <dig> is involved in stem development. our results provide a comprehensive understanding of osxylps and may serve as a guide for research on the osxylp gene family.

RESULTS
identification of putative osxylps
to identify xylogen-like proteins  in rice, we performed blastp searches across several rice protein databases using zexyp <dig>  atxyp <dig>  and atxyp <dig> protein sequences as queries  <cit> . after confirming the presence of nsltp-like domains, agp-like regions, and ag-type glycomodules and removing redundant sequences, we identified  <dig> osxylps in rice . to ensure the detection of all proteins in this family, we conducted additional blastp searches using protein sequences of the  <dig> identified osxylps; these searches yielded no more xylps. among the  <dig> osxylps, we identified  <dig> new agps. the remaining  <dig> identified osxylps, osltpl <dig>   <cit>  and osxylp <dig>   <cit> , were among  <dig> agps previously identified  <cit> . osltpl <dig> was first isolated as a β-glcy-reactive arabinogalactan protein; and then osltpl <dig> and osxylp <dig> were identified as nsltp-like agps.table  <dig>

we performed a multiple sequence alignment on the nsltp-like domains of  <dig> osxylps and  <dig> atxylps to clarify the sequence characteristics of osxylps . it is noteworthy that the distribution of eight cysteine  residues is highly conserved, following an c-x-c-x-cc-x-cxc-x-c-x-c pattern, in both osxylps and atxylps. the hydrophobicity of the residue between cys <dig>  and cys <dig>  is also conserved, with the residue always leucine, isoleucine, or valine . the conserved nature of the eight cys residues and the hydrophobic residue, which in combination are involved in the formation of the three-dimensional structure that can firmly bind lipids, implies their important contribution to lipid-binding ability.

protein structure and phylogenetic analysis
the osxylp protein sequences were submitted to several bioinformatic websites to predict the presence of signal peptides, glycosylphosphatidylinositol -anchored signals, n-glycosylation sites, and ag glycomodules . all  <dig> osxylps were expected to have an n-terminal signal peptide for targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum. all osxylps except for osxylp <dig> were found to be gpi anchor proteins, indicating that these proteins might localize in the plasma membrane . in addition, putative ag glycomodules in all osxylps were found to be distributed in the past-rich region before and/or after the nsltp-like domain . moreover, n-glycosylation sites in most of the osxylps were located in the nsltp-like domain and the past-rich region . the existence of signal peptides and ag glycomodules suggest that the  <dig> osxylps may be chimeric agps.figure  <dig>

using the aligned full-length osxylp and atxylp protein sequences, we obtained an unrooted phylogenetic tree showing their phylogenetic relationships . with a few exceptions, all xylps in the tree are clustered according to their protein sequence homologies into four distinct, strongly supported clades . family members with high sequence homology therefore cluster together in the tree. for instance, five xylps each from rice and arabidopsis are placed in clade a, with cysteine residues distributed following the conserved pattern: c-x9/10-c-x16/17-cc-x12/14-c-l/v/i-c-x22/23/24-c-x7/8/9-c . clade b consists of five xylps, three osxylps, and two atxylps . the distribution of the eight cysteine residues in the  <dig> xylps in clade c displays a highly conserved pattern: c-x9-c-x14-cc-x12-c-l/v-c-x25/27-c-x9/10-c . in addition, the putative ag glycomodules in all  <dig> xylps are located between the nsltp-like domain and the gpi anchor signal. the major difference between clades a, b, and c vs. clade d is that osxylp <dig>  osxylp <dig>  and osxylp <dig> in the latter have low similarity to other xylps. representatives of rice and arabidopsis are present in each clade in the phylogenetic tree. within each clade, species-specific xylps from rice and arabidopsis are grouped separately, indicating that the evolutionary expansions of xylps in rice and arabidopsis have occurred independently.figure  <dig>

chromosomal localization and gene duplication
we obtained the exact coordinates and orientations of osxylp genes from the rice genome annotation project  database. the approximate locations of these genes are marked on the rice chromosome sketch shown in figure  <dig>  the osxylp genes are located on seven rice chromosomes: nine genes on chromosome  <dig>  seven genes on chromosome  <dig>  and one gene each on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . the osxylps thus appear to be preferentially distributed.figure  <dig>

genes. chromosome numbers are indicated at the top of each chromosome. the cleavages on the chromosomes indicate the position of centromeres. genes present on duplicated segments of genome are connected by red lines, and tandem duplicated genes are marked with purple background.



we also investigated segmental and tandem duplications in the osxylp gene family. we found that nine osxylp genes  located in the duplicated chromosomal segments of rice chromosomes mapped by rgap with a maximal distance between collinear gene pairs of 500 kb . additionally, six genes  are tandemly duplicated and separated by no more than five intervening genes. to summarize,  <dig> osxylp genes are associated with segmental and tandem duplications, indicating that evolution in this gene family has involved a large number of duplication events.

expression patterns of osxylp gene
expression patterns are important for analyzing the function of target genes. to investigate expression patterns of osxylp genes, we accordingly investigated three publicly available resources: expressed sequence tag  profiles, mpss tags, and microarray data.

we examined the availability of est and full-length cdna data by searching the rice annotation project database locus of osxylp genes in the unigene database at ncbi  . we discovered that  <dig> of  <dig> osxylp genes are represented by at least one full-length cdna or est. both full-length cdnas and ests are reported for  <dig> genes, whereas  <dig> genes are only represented by an est. the data indicate that the osxylp genes, except for osxylp <dig>  are expressed . the est data demonstrate that four genes are tissue-specifically expressed: osltpl <dig> in stems, osxylp <dig> and osxylp <dig> in shoot apical meristem , and osxylp <dig> in panicles .

mpss is a sensitive quantitative method for gene expression analysis  <cit> . to analyze the expression pattern of the  <dig> osxylp genes, we obtained two 17-base and 20-base signatures in  <dig> different organs and tissues of rice from the mpss database. mpss signatures for  <dig> osxylp genes were available in at least one of the two libraries . differential expression abundances, represented by the number of tags , were classified to indicate low , moderate , and strong  expression. eight and seven genes displayed strong and moderate expression levels, respectively, and four genes were expressed at a low level . it is noteworthy that  <dig> genes showed abundant or specific expression in roots, leaves, stems, and panicles. the results of this analysis are consistent with the predicted roles of osxylp genes in vascular system development.

microarrays provide a high-throughput approach for the analysis of gene expression patterns. microarray data were obtained from a previous study of osxylp gene expression in various tissues, including young roots , mature leaves , young leaves , shoot apical meristem , and various stages of panicle  and seed  development  <cit> . a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed by using the logarithmic signal values of osxylp genes  revealed that  <dig> of the  <dig> osxylps genes are expressed in at least one vegetative or reproductive developmental stage . osxylp <dig> is abundantly expressed across the panicle development process , while osltpl <dig> is expressed in all examined organs and tissues . five genes  are mainly expressed in yr and p <dig> . high expression levels were indicated for osxylp <dig> in p <dig> , osxylp <dig> in yr and p4–p <dig> , and osxylp <dig> in p <dig> . osxylp <dig>  osxylp <dig>  and osxylp <dig> are highly expressed in yr . the expression levels of osxylp <dig> and osxylp <dig> are relatively low in all examined organs and tissues . osxylp <dig>  osxylp <dig>  and osxylp <dig> are highly expressed in panicles and seeds , while the expression levels of osxylp <dig> and osxylp <dig> are high in all examined organs and tissues .figure  <dig>

to validate the results of the digital expression analysis, we examined the expression levels of osxylp genes in five different tissues by qrt-pcr. the resulting gene expression patterns were in general agreement with the microarray and mpss tag data . according to our pcr results, osxylp <dig>  osxylp <dig>  osxylp <dig>  and osxylp <dig> are especially expressed in roots  , osltpl <dig>  osxylp <dig>  and osxylp <dig> are predominantly expressed in p <dig> , osxylp <dig> and osxylp <dig> are mainly expressed in p <dig> , osxylp <dig> and osxylp <dig> are mainly expressed in roots and leaves  , and osxylp <dig> is mainly expressed in leaves and p <dig> . four genes are mostly expressed in three tissues: osxylp <dig> in roots, leaves, and stems , osxylp <dig> in roots, leaves, and p <dig> , osltpl <dig> in roots, leaves, and p <dig> , and osxylp <dig> in leaves, p <dig>  and p <dig> . in contrast, no obviously specific expressions were observed for osxylp <dig>  osxylp <dig>  osxylp <dig>  and osxylp <dig> genes .figure  <dig>

expression profiles of osxylp genes under abiotic stresses and hormone treatments
we analyzed the microarray data of 7-day-old seedlings under drought, salt, and cold stresses to investigate the abiotic stress response of osxylps. our results indicate that osxylp <dig> expression is up-regulated by drought stress, whereas osxylp <dig>  osxylp <dig>  and osxylp <dig> are down-regulated by drought and salt stresses . to verify the above results, we used qrt-pcr to detect the expression levels of these four genes in 7-day-old seedlings under three stress conditions for 3 hours . the expression of osxylp <dig> was up-regulated under salt stress , while osxylp <dig>  osxylp <dig>  and osxylp <dig> were significantly down-regulated by drought and salt stresses . these results suggest that some osxylp genes may participate in abiotic stress pathways and play roles in the response to these stresses, especially drought and salt stresses.figure  <dig>

we used qrt-pcr to examine transcriptional levels of  <dig> representative osxylp genes under naa, 6-ba, and ga treatments . except for osxylp <dig> and osxylp <dig>  the examined osxylp genes were up-regulated significantly in seedlings subject to naa treatment . only four genes  displayed significant up-regulation under 6-ba treatment . except for osxylp <dig>  the expression levels of all examined genes were increased under ga treatment . these results indicate that osxylps may play roles in responses to these hormones.figure  <dig>

comparative expression analysis of osxylp and atxylp genes
to provide more evidence for the deduced biological functions of xylp genes, a comparative expression analysis of rice and arabidopsis xylp genes was performed using microarray and mpss data from roots, leaves, inflorescences, pollen, and siliques/seeds and from plants under abiotic stresses . all osxylp and atxylp genes were found to be present in at least one of the databases, except for osxylp <dig> which was absent from the two data sets . analysis of the integrated microarray and mpss data revealed that  <dig> xylp genes are expressed in at least two organs and tissues. among the  <dig> genes,  <dig> xylp genes showed specific expression patterns and  <dig> were entirely lowly expressed .figure  <dig>

the analysis furthermore revealed that some xylp genes with close evolutionary relationships have similar expression patterns. for example, osxylp <dig>  osxylp <dig>  osxylp <dig>  and atxylp <dig> are highly expressed in roots, as are osxylp <dig>  osxylp <dig>  and osxylp <dig> in inflorescences and seeds .

it is noteworthy that xylp genes originating from gene duplication events, such as, segmental duplicated genes: osxylp <dig>  osxylp <dig>  and osxylp8; osltpl <dig> and osxylp4; tandem duplicated genes: osxylp <dig> and osxylp <dig>  osxylp <dig> and osxylp <dig>  do not show similar expression patterns and responses under abiotic stresses . these results are in accord with the conclusions of previous studies that the duplicated genes have frequently diverged from their ancestors, thus hinting that gene duplication has played an important evolutionary role by enriching biological functions of the xylp gene family.

identification of xylp <dig> and xylp <dig> mutants
to investigate the biological functions of osxylp genes in rice, we acquired four t-dna insertion mutants from the plant functional genomics laboratory of korea. two mutants  were successfully identified, and the expressions of osxylp <dig> and osxylp <dig> genes in their homozygous mutants were accordingly analyzed .

we observed and measured stem and spike stalk lengths of mature xylp <dig> mutant plants. these lengths were found to be shorter in mutants than in the wild type, whereas no obvious distinction was observed in plant height . the mutant xylp <dig> plants displayed a reduction in the length of internodes, except for the basal internode . we examined the expression level of osxylp <dig> in different-aged stems by qrt-pcr. the results showed that osxylp <dig> is high expressed in 70– <dig> day old stems and low expressed in 60-day-old stems . the xylp <dig> mutant plants showed no distinct phenotype compared with the wild type .figure  <dig>

discussion
in this study, we used zexyp <dig>  atxyp <dig>  and atxyp <dig> protein sequences to search for xylogen-like proteins in the rgap database . after confirming the presence of nsltp and agp domains, we identified  <dig> xylp genes in rice. the xylp proteins were found to have a unique structure: chimeric agps with a conserved nsltp domain. we classified osxylp genes into four clades based on their phylogenetic relationships, arranged their genetic information, and inferred their expression patterns from three conventional and valid bioinformatic databases. observations of xylp mutants hinted that rice xylp genes may have a function in the development of organs with vascular systems.

gene duplication, both tandem and segmental, plays important roles in genome evolution  <cit> . osxylp genes are located on seven rice chromosomes. thirteen  of the  <dig> osxylp genes are derived from gene duplications:  <dig> genes attributed to segmental duplication are localized on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 7; and  <dig> pairs of tandemly duplicated genes are distributed on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> . most duplicated osxylp genes show diverse expression patterns, including those arising from tandem and segmental duplications, such as tandemly duplicated gene pairs: osxylp <dig> and osxylp <dig>  osxylp <dig> and osxylp14; and segmentally duplicated gene pairs: osxylp <dig> and osxylp <dig>  osxylp <dig> and osxylp <dig>  our analyses indicate that the duplication events not only contributed to the expansion of the osxylp gene family, but also created differences in expression between duplicated genes that may have given rise to genetic functional diversity over the course of evolution.

analysis of est, microarray, and mpss signature data revealed that all osxylp genes are expressed . the analysis also indicated that most osxylp genes have high expression levels in tissues with vascular system, such as roots, stems, leaves, and panicles. osxylp and atxylp protein sequences were aligned and divided into four clades, with osltpl <dig>  osxylp <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> sharing high sequence homology with atxyp <dig> and atxyp <dig>  a double mutant of xyp <dig> and xyp <dig> in arabidopsis, but neither single mutant, shows defects in vascular development, and atxyp <dig> has been confirmed to have te-inducing activity  <cit> . osltpl <dig> and osxylp <dig> are highly expressed in roots, panicles, and seeds, similar to atxyp <dig>  and osxylp <dig> and atxyp <dig> have similar expression patterns in roots . thus, it is possible that osltpl <dig>  osxylp <dig>  and osxylp <dig> function in the vascular system development of higher plants.

in previous studies, gibberellin plays roles in the control of cambial activity, differentiation of xylem fibers, and cell elongation of secondary xylem fibers  <cit> . auxin and cytokinin coordinately post-transcriptionally regulate the accumulation of xylogen and are subsequently involved in the process of te differentiation  <cit> . the hormones ga, auxin, and cytokinin have also been verified to affect secondary xylem development  <cit> . studies indicate that hormones play important roles during plant vascular development  <cit> . in barley  aleurone protoplasts, β-glcy inhibits ga-promoted induction of α-amylase, suggesting that agps are involved in ga function  <cit> . in our qrt-pcr analysis, all examined genes were up-regulated under ga treatment except for osxylp <dig>  which showed little change. these results suggest that osxylp genes may participate in the hormone signaling pathway. various genes have been reported to be involved in the ga signaling pathway and to have important roles in plant growth and development. for example, a rice mutant of the dwarf <dig> gene has dark green leaves, compact panicles, and short, round grains  <cit> , and a gibberellin-responsive gene, csagp <dig>  is involved in stem elongation  <cit> . in our study, we identified a xylp <dig> mutant that has a significantly decreased stem height compared with the wild type, with every internode except for the basal internode observed to be shorter. these results suggest that osxylp <dig> may take part in the ga signaling pathway and is likely to have an important role in stem elongation.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified  <dig> xylp genes from the rice genome and classified them into four clades according to their evolutionary relationships. we also elucidated their genomic characteristics, protein structures, duplication status, and expression patterns during different developmental stages as well as under abiotic stress treatments. alterations in osxylp gene expression levels were observed under naa, 6-ba, and ga treatments, indicating that osxylp genes may be involved in hormonal regulation. these data provide insights into the characteristics of osxylp genes. a mutant of osxylp <dig> showed defects in stem length, suggesting that osxylp <dig> has a function in the development of organs with vascular systems. in conclusion, this study has provided fundamental information on osxylp gene functions and is a first step in functional research of rice xylps. to our knowledge, this is the first report of xylogen-like proteins in oryza sativa l., and  <dig> of the  <dig> identified osxylps are new agp genes.
