BACKGROUND
non-human primates  have been indispensable animal models for researchers due to their close evolutionary relationship, similar physiology, and overlapping susceptibility to infectious agents . the use of nhp animal models has been pivotal in the success of medical breakthroughs, particularly in the development of vaccines and drugs for polio, hepatitis, and aids, and generally in developing preventive and therapeutic measures against emerging pathogens and the threat of bioterrorism  <cit> .

two of the most commonly used nhps are cynomolgus macaque , which have long been considered important models for biomedical research and evolutionary studies  <cit> . there has been an increasing need for these nhps since the import of the indian-origin rhesus monkey , a traditional animal model, was banned in  <dig>  cynomolgus , a close cousin of rhesus macaque , has been used in neuroscience studies and drug safety testing  <cit> . in studies of ebola hemorrhagic fever, cm is a better model than the widely used rm, because cm’s symptoms are more similar to those observed in humans  <cit> . african green monkey , which is known to be resistant to simian immunodeficiency virus, has also been used as a model organism for hiv research  <cit> .

knowledge of the transcriptome is critical to the study of disease, the immune system, and the regulation of biological processes, and a reference transcriptome provides a starting point for many types of bioinformatic analyses  <cit> . there have been many efforts to characterize the transcriptomes of cm and ag. most of these studies were performed using expressed sequence tags , serial analysis of gene expression , and microarrays  <cit> . however, microarrays require a priori knowledge of sequences that are to be studied, and this renders them undesirable for quantitative expression studies or identification of non-human-specific traits. thus, for the species that are not well characterized, as with cm and ag, these technologies fall short.

deep sequencing technologies have significantly increased our ability to generate unbiased genetic data at low costs. the availability of such data has allowed us to make significant progress in understanding the genetic basis of biological processes and systems. the application of deep sequencing techniques to transcriptomics allows the nearly complete characterization of transcriptomic phenomena, such as the description of coding and non-coding rna expression, the identification of splice isoforms, and the discovery of gene fusions . these technologies have been applied at low depth of coverage for a de novo assembly of cm, which relied heavily on the human reference genome  <cit> .

recently, draft genome sequences for both cm and ag were published on ncbi’s website  <cit> . in this study, leveraging the newly available genomes and using deep rna sequencing, we construct transcriptome assemblies and gene models — predicted genes each coding a family of transcript isoforms — for cm and ag, obviating the need for computationally expensive and less reliable de novo transcriptome assembly  <cit> . we present the multi-species annotation  pipeline  <cit> , annotate these new transcriptomes, and assign hugo standard gene symbols to the gene models. we also identify  <dig> novel transcripts specific to these species, and elucidate tissue-specific expression profiles among these nhp animal models compared to those of other primates and humans. these transcriptomes are publically available on a customized ucsc genome browser interface  <cit>  for users to navigate through the transcriptomes, search for genes of interest, and compare tissue-specific splice isoforms.

RESULTS
transcriptome assembly
to characterize the transcriptomes of cynomolgus macaques and african green monkey, we generated rna-seq data for tissue samples from liver, lymph node, lung, spleen, blood , marrow , and brain  of healthy individuals . after filtering the low quality sequences and trimming of low quality bases, we mapped the appropriate sequence reads to the corresponding draft genomes of cm  and ag  and assembled them using the tuxedo suite  <cit> . non-blood tissue samples were assembled independently using cufflinks without prior annotations, and merged by cuffmerge to generate the first draft assemblies. guided by the first draft assemblies, blood replicate samples were individually assembled by cufflinks and merged with the previous assemblies . this step augmented the draft assemblies yielding  <dig>  and  <dig>  contig transcripts for cm and ag, respectively .table  <dig>

gene annotation and benchmarking
to systematically describe uncharacterized transcriptome assemblies, we developed the multi-species annotation  pipeline , based on blast alignments to a full primate database . to benchmark the performance of the msa pipeline, we tested it on the ensembl rhemac <dig> reference transcripts  as a control and compared our results with ensembl’s existing annotation . we were able to annotate  <dig> % of the transcripts, of which  <dig> % had a unique annotation and matched ensembl’s gene. the gene symbols for the remaining  <dig> % of the transcripts were ambiguously matched, primarily due to inconsistent naming conventions between ncbi and ensembl, such as ensembl’s use of species-specific gene symbols, and its occasional mis-annotation .figure  <dig> 
the schematic of the strategy for reconstructing and annotating transcriptomes. we leveraged the tuxedo suite to generate reference-based transcriptome assemblies and used our multi-species annotation  pipeline for annotation: a) we applied tophat and cufflinks to quality-filtered, tissue-specific rna-seq samples, and generated a combined transcriptome assembly using cuffmerge. b) we used the msa pipeline for annotation. this pipeline has three steps: 1) alignment via parallelized iterative blast, 2) assignment of gene symbols via homology, and 3) correction and filtering.
assessment of annotations. a) we benchmarked the msa pipeline using ensembl rhemac <dig> reference transcripts. we annotated  <dig> % of the transcripts in rhemac <dig>   <dig> % had unique annotation, matching the assigned gene in the database. the remaining  <dig> % of the transcripts were not unambiguously matched due to mis-annotation in ensembl or inconsistent naming conventions. mmu refers to species-specific macaca mulatta transcripts; mir refers to microrna; locus refers to ensembl identifiers without a gene symbol. b) we evaluated the quality of annotations by comparing the gene expression profiles among chlorocebus aethiops , macaca fascicularis , gorilla gorilla , homo sapiens , pan troglodytes , and rhesus macaque . we performed principal component analysis on the expression of  <dig>  orthologous genes in multiple tissues. we grouped together lymph node, marrow, and spleen , as they comprise the lymphatic system. the first two components explained  <dig> % of the variance in the data, indicating the consistency of the cm and ag transcriptomes on a biological level.



employing the msa pipeline, we annotated  <dig> % of cm’s contig transcripts, of which  <dig> % were mapped to validated reference sequences from genbank and  <dig> % to predicted reference sequences  <cit> . similarly, for ag, we annotated  <dig> % of the contig transcripts, of which  <dig> % were based on validated reference sequences, and  <dig> % on predicted reference sequences.  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the contig transcripts aligned to sequences lacking gene annotation. for both species, in less than  <dig> % of contig transcripts, the msa-assigned gene symbols did not agree with those of their parent gene models. these mismatches are not necessarily due to limitations in cufflinks or the msa pipeline; they frequently stem from inconsistencies in common naming conventions.

identification of genes and their isoforms
using cufflinks and cuffmerge, we initially found  <dig>  and  <dig>  gene models for cm and ag, respectively. we then excluded erroneous contig transcripts, which failed our filtering criteria . as a result, for cm, we identified  <dig>  transcripts, of which  <dig>  were valid single-exon isoforms. the whole set of transcripts corresponded to  <dig>  genes models, annotated with  <dig>  unique gene symbols. similarly, for ag we identified  <dig>  transcripts, including  <dig>  valid single-exon isoforms, corresponding to  <dig>  genes models, annotated with  <dig>  unique gene symbols.

comparative gene expression profiling
it has been demonstrated that the same organs of the different primate species have similar expression profiles  <cit> . to assess the quality and accuracy of our annotations of cm and ag on a biological level, we hypothesized that if our annotations were accurate, then the expression profile of tissues in cm and ag would cluster with tissues of other primates, such as human, gorilla, chimpanzee and rhesus. to that end, we employed the public rna-seq data for blood, brain, liver, lung, lymph, marrow, and spleen of human, gorilla, chimpanzee, and rhesus from multiple sources  .

for human, gorilla, chimpanzee, and rhesus, we mapped the rna-seq reads to the corresponding ensembl reference genomes and computed the expression measures using the species-specific ensembl annotation . for cm and ag, we used the annotations described in this manuscript. we combined the expressions from multiple species using  <dig>  protein-coding genes that are one-to-one orthologous between human, chimpanzee, and rhesus and performed principle component analysis  using the normalized, batch effect adjusted expression values . the first principal component was sufficient to separate the expression profiles by tissue and explain  <dig> % of the variance in the data . clustering of data by tissues indicated the relative consistency in the msa annotation; however, further experimental validation is required to ensure its accuracy.

to compare cm and ag transcriptomes, we profiled the rna expression in blood samples for which we had five replicates per species. in this analysis, we also included five replicate blood samples from rm. . based on the pearson correlation metric, we clustered the deseq-normalized expression values  and recovered the topology of the evolutionary tree among these species . this further supported that our annotations were biologically consistent.figure  <dig> 
reconstruction of the nhp evolutionary tree using expression profiles. based on the msa pipeline’s annotations for  <dig>  orthologous genes, we were able to, recover the topology of the evolutionary tree comprising ag, cm, and rm. we used the pearson correlation as a distance metric between expression values.



novel transcripts
we sought to determine if there were novel splice isoforms with coding potential in the cm or ag transcriptomes. to that end, we searched for the longest open reading frame  in each of the six frames, which yielded  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> candidate orfs for cm and ag, respectively. we translated each orf sequence into its corresponding protein and aligned it to three protein databases — refseq, human-nr, and full-nr — in an iterative, subtractive fashion using blastp . in cm and ag,  <dig>  and  <dig>  translated orf sequences, respectively, did not align to any of the proteins in the databases. among these,  <dig> transcripts in ag and  <dig> transcripts in cm had orfs longer than  <dig> amino acids . we selected a subset of these candidate novel transcripts  for validation in spleen or blood, using two or three different primer pairs. all of the selected candidate novel transcripts were validated with at least one primer in at least one tissue .figure  <dig> 
validation of novel transcripts. we validated  <dig> novel transcripts for cm and  <dig> for ag. here, the gel validations, exon structures, and sanger validations of two novel transcripts from each species is shown . in the exon structure, the red segment indicates the orf portion of the transcript . we used three different primers for each novel transcript to measure expression. a, b) novel transcripts for ag. c, d) novel transcripts for cm.

discussion
in this manuscript, we present a draft of the transcriptomes for two important and commonly used nhp animal models: cynomolgus macaque and african green monkey. we employ deep rna-seq data from seven tissues and based on the available draft genomes of these species, reconstruct their transcriptomes.

we introduce the multi-species annotation  pipeline, which annotates assembled contigs and their corresponding gene models through iterative blast alignments against a full primate database . this pipeline is novel in that it leverages known sequences of related species to annotate via homology the constructed gene models and their isoforms of an uncharacterized organism with hugo standard gene symbols. although we employ the msa pipeline for ag and cm, it can be used for characterizing transcriptome assemblies from species with evolutionary relatives annotated in the ncbi database. we benchmark the msa pipeline using ensembl rhesus macaque  reference transcripts, annotating  <dig> % of rm transcripts. this pipeline is freely available for download  <cit> .

we apply the msa pipeline to the cynomolgus and african green monkey draft transcriptomes and successfully annotate  <dig> % of the contigs. the  <dig>  and  <dig>  gene models we identify in cm and ag genome, respectively, are in agreement with the expected number of genes in human and primate genomes  <cit> . the genes in cm and ag are annotated with  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique gene symbols. some gene models are annotated with the same symbol due to shared homology.

cm and ag assemblies include  <dig>  and  <dig>  gene models that share  <dig>  and  <dig>  gene symbols with the human transcriptome. for these gene models’ isoforms, we compare the distribution of their lengths and their numbers of exons to those in human. the wilcoxon rank sum test identifies  <dig>  and  <dig>  gene models  with no significant difference between the two distributions in cm and ag, indicating comprehensive identification of isoforms in these genes. there are  <dig> and  <dig> gene models  in cm and ag transcriptome, respectively, with significantly different distributions of isoform lengths or exon numbers. these genes may include novel transcripts or in some cases their transcripts may not have been captured in any of the seven tissues in our rna-seq dataset due to low abundance. the remaining  <dig>  and  <dig>  gene models  that do not share a gene symbol with any genes in the human transcriptome may also present novel transcripts that require further validation.

we identify about four isoforms per gene on average, 90% and 86% of which contain more than one exon for cm and ag, respectively . identifying real single-exon transcripts is challenging, as they can be due to artifacts that arise from discrepant or poorly annotated reference genomes  <cit>  or from low read coverage in rna sequencing  <cit> . several studies disregard single-exon transcripts  <cit> ; however, single-exons transcripts have been recognized to play an important role in the evolution of primates . the majority of gene models in our genome-based transcriptome assembly pipeline correspond to a single isoform comprising one exon. to eliminate potential single exon artifacts, we focus on genes whose isoforms have no significant difference in the distribution of their length and their number of exons with respect to the human transcriptome, and identify  <dig>  and  <dig>  gene models with single-exon isoforms in cm and ag, respectively.

to show that cm and ag transcriptomes recapitulate tissue specific expression in human and other nhps, we compare the expression of the msa-annotated homologous genes. in both cm and ag, more than 87% of the transcripts are expressed at fpkm values  <cit>  higher than  <dig>  in at least one tissue. focusing on one-to-one orthologous genes among human, chimpanzee, and rhesus , the principal component analysis of tissue-specific gene expression in the cm and ag datasets and the publicly available nhp and human datasets shows a similarity in each tissue, indicating the relative consistency of our assemblies and annotations with other primates. we acknowledge that since we relied on draft genome assemblies of cm and ag, our transcriptome assemblies can be improved in quality by obtaining more samples and incorporating the information from de novo assembly.

furthermore, in this study, we report the detection and experimental validation of  <dig> novel transcripts and splice isoforms with coding potential. despite the biological importance of noncoding transcripts, we limited our analysis to coding transcripts.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, the annotated transcriptomes of cynomolgus macaque and african green monkey presented in this paper will facilitate non-human primate research and improve our understanding of the molecular biology of humans and other primates. as the technology of rna sequencing improves and more sequences are deposited in public databases, the gene models derived from the rna-seq and our annotation pipeline will become increasingly accurate.
