BACKGROUND
pneumococci  are a major bacterial cause of disease for which antimicrobial resistance is of increasing concern. a recent report estimated that in  <dig> >24% of disease-causing pneumococci in the usa were tetracycline-nonsusceptible and  <dig> % were chloramphenicol-nonsusceptible  <cit> . in some european countries, such as spain and france, these rates were higher:  <dig> % and  <dig> % of pneumococci isolated in these countries, respectively, were tetracycline-nonsusceptible, while  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively were chloramphenicol-nonsusceptible  <cit> . similarly,  <dig> % of pneumococci in the usa  <cit> ,  <dig> % of those in spain and  <dig> % of those in france were macrolide-nonsusceptible  <cit> . in some regions of asia rates were even higher:  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of pneumococcal isolates were tetracycline-, chloramphenicol- and erythromycin-nonsusceptible, respectively  <cit> .

among pneumococci, chloramphenicol and tetracycline nonsusceptibility are conferred through acquisition of the cat and tet genes ). the cat gene encodes a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, which catalyses the conversion of chloramphenicol into non-active derivatives. tet encodes a ribosomal protection protein shown to initiate reversal of tetracycline-ribosome binding, an event which would otherwise inhibit protein synthesis  <cit> .

pneumococcal nonsusceptibility to erythromycin and other macrolides is most commonly conferred by acquisition of the erm and/or mef genes  <cit> . erm encodes an n-methyltransferase which mediates macrolide-target site alteration  <cit> . mef encodes macrolide efflux pumps  <cit>  allowing the resistant cell to reduce its internal macrolide concentration and thereby eliminate the detrimental effects of these drugs.

in recent years it has become apparent that the majority of tet and/or cat genes among tetracycline- and/or chloramphenicol-nonsusceptible pneumococci are contained within genetic elements known as integrative conjugative elements   <cit> . tet is associated with the tn <dig> family of ices, the first of which was described in  <dig> from an enterococcus faecalis isolate  <cit> . cat is associated with the tn <dig> ice family, first described in  <dig>  <cit> , where, besides the typical inttn <dig> integrase, a different integrase  has recently been described  <cit> .

to date, tn916-like ices have been identified among > <dig> bacterial genera  <cit> . tn <dig> itself is ~18 kb in length and contains  <dig> genes arranged into functional modules associated with conjugal transfer, recombination, transcriptional regulation and accessory functions . the recombination module contains the integrase  and excisionase  genes. the int gene encodes a tyrosine recombinase responsible for integration and excision of the element from the host chromosome. the product of xis drives the directionality of the recombination process, most commonly by promoting excision  <cit> . tn <dig> has been shown to have the ability to transpose intracellularly and to mediate its own intercellular transfer via conjugation  <cit> . successful conjugal transfer between pneumococci and into pneumococci from other species is a strain-dependent property  <cit> ; transfer between pneumococci by transformation has also been documented  <cit> . aside from tn <dig>  other members of this family may contain alternate accessory genes and/or feature a smaller, independent genetic element integrated within the tn <dig> genetic background, e.g. the erm-containing tn <dig> or omega elements, or the mef-containing mega  element  <cit> .

among pneumococci, tn5252-like ices are most commonly identified in association with tn916-like ices  <cit>  whereby the resulting composite element is known as tn <dig>  and may be highly variable  <cit> . in addition to the cat gene, tn <dig>  contains an independent int gene and the umudc gene, shown to provide protection from uv damage  <cit> . in some cases tn5252-like ices also contain a lantibiotic synthesis gene cluster  <cit> . lantibiotics, or lanthionine-containing antibiotics, are antimicrobial compounds with activity against a range of gram-positive bacterial species  <cit> .

there is evidence to suggest that tn916-like and tn5252-like elements were present among pneumococci in the 1970s  <cit>  and to our knowledge the oldest pneumococcus for which such an element has been described was isolated in  <dig>  <cit> . however, tetracycline-nonsusceptible pneumococci were first identified in  <dig>  <cit> , while pneumococcal resistance to erythromycin and chloramphenicol were recognised in  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig>  <cit> , respectively. given the important role of these ices in the dissemination of resistance determinants, it therefore seems likely that they, or similar genetic elements, were present among pneumococcal populations from at least as early as the 1960s. the aim of this study was to use our historical genome collection  <cit>  to search for, characterise, and compare such older elements among pneumococci isolated prior to  <dig>  thus pre-dating the earliest known pneumococcal tn <dig> and tn <dig> representatives  <cit> .

RESULTS

within the 14/ <dig> genome, the inttn <dig> and tet genes were located on a tn <dig> element which was structurally identical  to the tn <dig> region of icesp23fst <dig> . in the 14/ <dig> genome this tn <dig> ice was inserted upstream of the pspa locus, which encodes pneumococcal surface protein a.

within the 18c/ <dig> genome, inttn <dig> and tet were located on a tn <dig> element, itself associated with a putative bacteriophage showing similarity to the streptococcus phage  <dig>  and inserted in the genome downstream of the trxb locus, which encodes a pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductase. the genome of the 18c/ <dig> bacteriophage contained  <dig> genes,  <dig> of which were predicted to encode hypothetical proteins. a further  <dig> genes were predicted to encode functional phage proteins such as the phage integrase, lytic amidase, holin and structural phage proteins . it should be noted here that contiguous sequence could not be obtained across the full length of the 18c/ <dig> tn916-bacteriophage composite element, despite repeated attempts using pcr and conventional sanger sequencing techniques. the position of the missing region is shown in figure  <dig> and likely included part of the pblb gene, which may play a role in adhesion  <cit> . relative to those of 14/ <dig> and icesp23fst <dig>  the 18c/ <dig> tn916-like sequence contained a 155 bp deletion between orf <dig> and tet.

comparative analyses indicated that pn <dig> harboured a novel, composite ice which was inserted in the genome upstream of the rbga locus, which encodes a ribosomal biogenesis gtpase. this novel ice, designated icesppn <dig>  contained  <dig> genes and regions of similarity to tn <dig> and ppi- <dig>  as described below .

the  <dig> 5’-most genes of icesppn <dig> showed similarity to those of the tn5252-like region of icesp23fst <dig> and included repa, which encodes replication initiation factor a. a further four and two putative genes also showed similarity to those of tn <dig> and were separated by a ~ <dig>  kb insertion . this insertion contained  <dig> putative genes, including four with ≥96% nucleotide sequence identity to those of a two-component signalling system described for streptococcus mitis strain b <dig>  <cit>  and s. pneumoniae icespn <dig>  <cit> . these genes were predicted to encode an abc-type antimicrobial peptide transporter, an abc-type transporter permease, a sensor histidine kinase and a response regulator. directly 3’ of the two-component system cluster were two genes for which the predicted peptide products showed 64% amino acid identity to the lanm lantibiotic and 76% amino acid identity to a lantibiotic transporter, respectively.

the 3’-most icesppn <dig> gene represented inttn <dig> and was preceded by a putative excisionase gene, predicted to encode a protein with 83% amino acid identity to a putative streptococcus sp. excisionase. directly upstream of the putative excisionase gene was a region which was structurally identical to part of ppi- <dig> of tigr <dig>  another pneumococcal reference isolate . this region spanned nine predicted genes, the predicted protein products of which included the plcr putative transcriptional regulator, an is <dig> family transposase, a putative protein kinase, and both a putative abc-transporter atp-binding protein and permease.

comparison of tn <dig> sequence regions
the 14/ <dig> tn916-like nucleotide sequence differed from that of icesp23fst <dig> by only  <dig> substitutions and a 5 bp insertion within orf <dig>   <dig> of the nucleotide differences between these sequences were located within the tet gene, which is consistent with the previous observation that tet possesses a mosaic nucleotide sequence  <cit> . additionally, this tn916-like sequence shared >99% nucleotide identity with tn916-like ices identified among contemporary bacterial isolates including streptococcus suis, streptococcus parauberis and staphylococcus aureus <cit> . the 18c/ <dig> tn916-like nucleotide sequence was highly similar to that of the 14/ <dig>  differing by only two nucleotide substitutions .

discussion
this study of an historical collection of pneumococci has led to the discovery of two of the earliest known representatives of pneumococcal tn916-like ices and a novel composite ice. the tn916-like ices from pneumococci isolated in  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, were highly similar to the tn916-like region of icesp23fst <dig> from the pmen <dig> reference strain dated  <dig>  <cit> , and contemporary tn916-like ices. both of these ices contained the tetracycline-resistance determinant tet, but did not contain any other resistance determinant genes. identification of such elements among pneumococci isolated in the late 1960s confirms their existence from the first decade within which tetracycline resistance was reported among pneumococci  <cit> . 

the tn916-like element dated  <dig> in isolate 18c/ <dig> was inserted within a phage showing similarity to the streptococcus phage  <dig> . bacteriophages are known to mediate horizontal gene transfer between bacteria through the process of transduction  <cit> , although it is not clear to what extent this process occurs amongst pneumococci, or whether the  <dig> phage has retained this ability. pneumococcal tn916-like ices have not generally been associated with phage  <cit>  and no such other phage-associated representatives are present in the genbank database. thus it seems unlikely that phage-mediated transduction has played an important role in the dissemination of tn916-like ices, although it is possible that the 18c/ <dig> ice was acquired in this way.

aside from the tet genes described above, no other tet, cat, erm or mef resistance determinants were identified among the pneumococcal genomes studied here. there are other resistance mechanisms such as erm, erm or tet that have been found in pneumococci but are believed to be rare  <cit> . we searched for these genes among our genome collection and found no evidence for them, thus in this study we focussed on the common tetracycline, chloramphenicol and erythromycin resistance mechanisms among pneumococci.

in addition to those described above, an ice-associated int gene was identified among one further isolate, pn <dig>  dated  <dig>  it is also worth noting that this strain was among the earliest penicillin-nonsusceptible pneumococci to be identified, by virtue of the possession of altered penicillin-binding protein genes  <cit> . further analyses indicated that this pneumococcus harboured a novel composite ice, designated icesppn <dig>  which contained regions of similarity to the previously described tn5252-like ices and ppi- <dig> of the tigr <dig> reference isolate. additionally this ice contained a two-component signalling system gene cluster and two putative lantibiotic biosynthesis-/export- associated genes.

lantibiotics are small, lanthionine-containing antimicrobial peptides. synthesis and secretion follow detection of extracellular signals and are auto-regulated by two-component signal systems such as that putatively described above for icesppn <dig>  antimicrobial activity is achieved following post-translational modification. production of immunity proteins is required to protect the host cell  <cit> ; however, no such post-translational modification enzyme- or immunity protein- associated genes were identified within icesppn <dig>  calling into question the ability of pn <dig> to produce a functional version of this lantibiotic.

ppi- <dig> contains a 5’ region which is highly conserved among pneumococci and a 3’ region which is not conserved   <cit> . icesppn <dig> contained a region which was structurally identical to the non-conserved region of tigr <dig> ppi- <dig>  previously it was noted that loci within the conserved regions of ppi- <dig> showed similarity to those of tn <dig> <cit> . subsequently it was suggested that sequences may be exchanged between these elements via homologous recombination  <cit> . such a process could explain the patterns of shared sequence structure described here.

previous authors have demonstrated the capacity for diversity among pneumococcal ices  <cit> , and the description of icesppn <dig> reiterates this dynamic variability. the finding that two pneumococci isolated in the late 1960s harboured tn916-like ices, and that these ices were highly similar to that of the epidemiologically-successful pmen <dig> reference strain and contemporary tn916-like elements, demonstrates the ability of these ices to persist, almost unchanged , within bacterial populations for many years. the phenotypic effects associated with possession of such ices have an important impact on our ability to treat pneumococcal disease. in this context, understanding the processes driving the spread, maintenance and/or diversification of these elements is of the utmost importance.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we discovered the oldest known examples of tetracycline resistance-conferring pneumococcal genetic elements: two different tn916-like, tet-containing, elements identified among pneumococci dated  <dig> and  <dig>  the former element was highly similar to that of the pmen <dig> multidrug-resistant, globally-distributed pneumococcal reference strain isolated in  <dig>  the latter element was uniquely associated with a streptococcal phage. we also described a novel ice element in a pneumococcal isolate recovered in papua new guinea in  <dig>  and interestingly, this isolate was also one of the earliest penicillin-nonsusceptible pneumococci. this novel element, designated icesppn <dig>  contained a region of similarity to tn <dig>  a region of similarity to a pneumococcal pathogenicity island and novel lantibiotic synthesis/export-associated genes. the importance of antimicrobial resistance among pneumococci is unequivocal, and our work sheds further light on how these particular resistance determinants have evolved.
