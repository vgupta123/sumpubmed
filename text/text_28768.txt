BACKGROUND
sustained and tissue specific transgene expression are key issues for the development of successful gene therapy approaches. in principle, tissue specificity can be achieved either by gene delivery systems which explicitly deliver the gene of interest into a distinct cell type or tissue  <cit>  or by the use of tissue-specific expression cassettes  <cit> . for sustained transgene expression, integrating vectors, like viruses  <cit>  or nonviral systems based on integrases or transposons have been utilized  <cit> . to avoid the risk of insertional mutagenesis, as it has been observed for example with retrovirus  <cit> , nonintegrating vectors like episomally retained systems can be of use. the first prototype episomal vector pepi- <dig> was cons-tructed by piechaczek and colleagues  <cit>  carrying a chromosomal scaffold/matrix attachment region  derived from the β-interferon gene  <cit>  within a commercially available plasmid backbone; pepi- <dig> is able to replicate episomally with a copy number of approximately 5– <dig> molecules per cell and is stably retained without applying selection pressure allowing long-term expression of transgenes or shrna’s  <cit> . since integration of this vector into the host cell chromosome was never observed, side effects caused by gene disruption or activation would not be expected, but cannot be fully excluded. in contrast to episomal plasmid replicons based on animal viruses, pepi-based episomal dna vectors do not contain any transactivating viral proteins such as the sv <dig> large t-antigen or the ebv ebna- <dig> protein, which may contribute to cellular immortalization  <cit> . an upstream transcription unit regulated by the cmv immediate early promoter  and directed into the s/mar is necessary for episomal replication of pepi  <cit> . our approach here was to modify this vector system by exchanging the constitutive promoter with tissue- or tumor-specific ones to generate a vector, which will episomally express the transgene in the target cell type only, but being lost in all other cell types. recently, similar effects with pepi vectors utilizing chemically inducible promoters could be shown  <cit> .

only a small percentage  of cells transiently transfected with pepi- <dig> develops stable clones, also when pepi- <dig> plasmids are isolated from already established cell clones and reintroduced into cells or if pepi- <dig> episomes are administered as hpv <dig> based pseudoviral particles. this demonstrates that the primary dna sequence is not sufficient for stable establishment, but other epigenetic factors are involved in this process  <cit> . a further improvement of pepi- <dig> concerning transgene expression and episome establishment was previously published as pepito  <cit> . pepito consists of an identical transcription unit as pepi, but contains a cpg-low vector backbone achieving higher expression levels and episomal establishment rates compared to pepi. initially, the constitutive cmv or ef1α promoter was used in pepito vectors. in this study, we replaced them with tissue specific promoters: i) the alpha fetoprotein  promoter drives expression of afp in the embryonic liver and in hepatocellular carcinomas  <cit> , ii) the sm <dig> promoter has been described as tissue-specific promoter for smooth muscle cells  <cit> . a tissue-specific afp-dependent expressing pepito derivate achieved liver carcinoma specific expression in vitro and in vivo. for the sm22-promoter driven pepito derivative we present the tissue-specific replication of a s/mar based vector in vitro. to cope with the relatively low activity of tissue specific promoters, we utilized the hcmv upstream of the afp or sm <dig> promoter. as the episomal maintainance of the pepi-based vectors are dependent on the transcription into the s/mar region  <cit> , the replication of those vectors in cells without any activity for the promoter should not occur.

RESULTS
the afp promoter is more active in huh <dig> hepatocellular carcinoma compared to hpgl promoter and apoe enhancer
three liver specific promoters, alpha-fetoprotein promoter , haptoglobin promoter  and the apolipoprotein e enhancer  were evaluated for their use as liver specific episomal vectors. the afp and hpgl promoters were obtained by pcr amplification of genomic dna obtained from hek <dig> cells. promoter selection and primer choice were done under use of tiprod. to enhance promoter activity, a human cytomegalovirus  enhancer was cloned in front of the promoter sequence. as depicted in figure  <dig>  all constructs featuring an hcmv enhancer element achieve higher expression levels compared to the enhancer free construct. the cmv driven vector pepito-cmv-egfpluc served as positive control achieving the highest luminescence signal, followed by the hcmv/afp-construct, the hcmv/hpgl-construct and the much weaker respective apoe-derivative. as expected, the apoe enhancer without the haat promoter turned out to be inefficient for driving transgene expression. monitoring transgene expression over a period of 11 days exhibits decreasing expression signals over time, as no selection pressure was put on the transfected cells. as the hcmv enhancer/afp-promoter combination achieved highest activity of all liver specific promoter elements tested, it was selected for the further experiments.

afp promoter is most active in afp-producing cell lines, but also achieves weak expression levels in non-liver derived cell lines
plasmids pepito-cmv-egfpluc, pepito-afp-egfpluc and pepito-hcmv/afp-egfpluc were transfected into  <dig> different human and murine cancer cell lines  and a murine fibroblast cell line . in all cell lines transfected, the afp plasmid without enhancer element resulted in only very low to undetectable levels of luciferase activity, whereas the highest levels of luciferase activity were achieved by the cmv driven plasmid . the latter value  corresponds to a transfection efficiency based on percentage of transgene positive cells ranging from 20-60% using egfp encoding, cmv driven plasmids . the hcmv enhancer increased the expression activity of the afp driven plasmid, although there appeared to be strong variability between the cell lines. as there can be a large variability in terms of transfectability of various cell lines with transfection enhancers like polyethylenimine, we normalized the luciferase activity to the values achieved with the cmv driven plasmid . without hcmv enhancer, the relative activity varied between  <dig>  and  <dig> %. when using the hcmv enhancer, in the hepatoma cell lines huh <dig> and hepg <dig> the activity was boosted 18-fold and 15-fold, achieving 6%  resp. 12%  activity relative to cmv respectively. in all other cell lines, only 1-2% of cmv activity was obtain, with the exception of mda-mb- <dig> human melanoma . the weak background expression in all cell lines might be linked to the general tumor characteristics of immortalized cell lines. to investigate the role of afp expression for afp promoter driven transgene expression, we performed quantitative real time analysis on endogenous afp mrna levels using gapdh as internal standard . only in the reportedly afp positive cell lines huh <dig> and hepg <dig> considerable levels of afp mrna were detected, whereas in all other cell lines tested they were undetectable . hence we conclude that the endogenous afp levels and the activity of the used afp promoter show a positive correlation, although some minor background activity is observed in afp negative cell lines. all data obtained so far indicate a functional usage of the hcmv/afp hybrid promoter element with satisfactory specificity and sensitivity for hepatocellular carcinomas.

afp promoter is active in a xenograft model of huh <dig> in mice
to investigate the in vivo expression pattern of our newly developed hcmv/afp construct, we utilized the huh <dig> xenograft tumor model in immune compromised nude mice. the egfpluc transgene was replaced by an expression optimized firefly luciferase , which is reported to achieve better in vivo signals in comparison to the standard luciferase  <cit> . we also observed significantly higher luciferase activity with ofluc-plasmids in vitro when compared to the normal egfp luciferase fusion protein . nmri nu/nu mice carried subcutaneously implanted huh <dig> tumors in the flank, which are usually well vascularized and in principle accessible for polycation condensed plasmids after intravenous application  <cit> . as a transfection reagent, we used lpei. lpei polyplexes are known to rapidly aggregate in the blood stream leading to high transgene expression in the lung  <cit> . here we aimed at investigating the de-targeting effects on lung expression when using the afp promoter. polyplexes were prepared with lpei at an n/p ratio of  <dig> in a glucose buffer  and injected via the tail vein at a dose of  <dig>  mg/kg based on pdna . two days after transfection, animals were subject to analysis of luciferase activity by bioluminescense imaging  and after three days luciferase activity was quantified in tumor- and tissue lysates. as already observed for other luciferase encoding plasmid with constitutive promoters, pepito-cmv-ofluc based polyplexes led to predominant activity in the lung area, whereas activity in all other areas was rather low and not always detectable by bli. in sharp contrast, lung activity was strongly reduced with pepito-hcmv/afp-ofluc polyplexes, and in some animals a weak signal was observed in the tumor area. to obtain quantitative data on luciferase activity, animals were sacrificed at day three after transfection and luciferase activity measured in lysates of organs and tumor. with the cmv driven plasmid, a considerable luciferase activity was observed in lung tissue, whereas the tumor expression was approx. eightfold lower. in sharp contrast to the afp driven plasmid, luciferase activity in lung was 20-fold lower, whereas the luciferase expression in tumor was unaffected. hence we conclude the general functionality of the hcmv/afp-promoter for hcc-specific expression, both in vitro and in vivo.

specific replication of a sm <dig> driven pepito vector in a muscle derived cell line
for tissue specific expression and replication in healthy, adult tissue, we evaluated the human transgelin promoter , which is reported to be active in muscle cells  <cit> . as establishment of the episomes is easily detectable under selection, we applied vectors with a blasticidin expression cassette for our experiments. hek <dig> were used as negative control, whereas the muscle derived cell line te- <dig> served as the positive control.  <dig>  cells were transfected with  <dig>  μg dna  and two days post transfection cells were analyzed for the percentage of egfp positive cells  and egfp expression levels per egfp positive cell . all experiments were performed by transfecting equal mass amounts of vector dna instead of equal molar ratios of vector molecules, as we already did in our previous work  <cit> . this should exclude potential side effects of stuffer dna, like sonicated salmon sperm dna or any other small plasmid dna with varying cpg contents. in line with our previous observations  <cit> , pepito-hcmv/ef1-egfp-ires-bsd and pepito-hcmv/ef1-egfp-ires-bsd-Δsmar resulted in approx. 20% egfp positive cells, whereas with pepito-hcmv/sm22-egfp-ires-bsd >3% were egfp positive. the expression level  in hek  <dig> for the hcmv/sm <dig> promoter construct was also much weaker  than the levels for the hcmv/ef <dig> driven pepito . in contrast, the hcmv/sm <dig> construct was significantly more active in te- <dig> cells, >6% of cells were egfp positive, corresponding to one third of the activity of pepito-hcmv/ef1-egfp-ires-bsd . the expression level  was at about 15% of the constitutive active promoter. the higher percentage of egfp-positive cells observed after transfection with pepito-hcmv/ef1-egfp-ires-bsd-Δsmar can be explained by the smaller size of this plasmid. a similar behaviour of the Δsmar construct was previously observed in nih3t <dig> cells  <cit> . after 14 days of selection with blasticidin s a further facs analysis was performed to analyze the percentage of egfp positive cells and their mfi value . here, plasmids lacking the smar-element were not able to achieve stable expression, whereas with s/mar bearing constructs prolonged expression was achieved. furthermore the sm22-promoter achieved much better expression rates and expression levels in the te- <dig> cell line than in the hek  <dig> cells when compared to the ef1α-promoter. we omitted a Δsmar control vector for the tissue-specific derivative as a logical consequence to our previous experiments. if the pepito-hcmv/ef1-egfp-ires-bsd-Δsmar is not able to achieve persistence, the weaker expressing tissue-specific Δsmar-construct would not perform better.

with the help of the colony forming assay the establishment rate of stable episomes and background integration values was evaluated . colony formation units  were calculated by normalizing the colony number to the value obtained with pepito-hcmv/ef1-egfp-ires-bsd-Δsmar as recently described  <cit> . in hek  <dig> cells, the hcmv/sm22-construct resulted only very few background colonies, whereas in te- <dig> cells the same construct achieved more colonies than the pepito-hcmv/ef1-egfp-ires-bsd-Δsmar. in comparison, the hcmv/sm <dig> driven construct succeeded in almost  <dig> fold more colonies in the te- <dig> cell line than in the hek <dig> cells when compared to the hcmv/ef1-driven pepito. therefore we conclude the functionality of the tissue-specific expression of the sm <dig> promoter in the muscle derived te- <dig> cells. the minimal expression levels of the sm <dig> promoter in the hek <dig> cells  did not achieve episomal retention of this plasmid. it is known, that transcription in the smar is a prerequisite for episomal establishment  <cit> . we confirmed the establishment as an episome by rescue experiments . only the pepito-hcmv/ef1-egfp-ires-bsd could be rescued in both cell lines. the negative control, pepito-hcmv/ef1-egfp-ires-bsd-Δsmar did not give any positive result, which is in line with previous experiments  <cit> . pepito-hcmv/sm22-egfp-ires-bsd could only be rescued from genomic dna of the stably selected te- <dig> cells, indicating that this construct was maintained here as an epsiome. on average, about hundred positive clones were obtained from cells carrying pepito-hcmv/ef1-egfp-ires-bsd, whereas from te- <dig> carrying pepito-hcmv/sm22-egfp-ires-bsd approximately  <dig> positive colonies were obtained. rescued plasmid were identified by different restriction digests. pepito-hcmv/ef1-egfp-ires-bsd-Δsmar did not result in any bacterial retransformants. taken together, the sm22-promoter achieved better expression rates and expression levels in the te- <dig> cell line, confirming its usefulness as a tissue-specific promoter for muscle-specific cells. for the first time we could also show its function as a tissue-specific promoter in a pepi-deriviative in terms of episomal establishment.

first number: number of rescue experiments where plasmid dna could be rescued without any rearrangement from the isolated chromosomal dna. second number: total number of performed rescue experiments. ‵0′ indicates that no clones could be obtained in any rescue experiment.

discussion
in this manuscript we present the first description of an episomal and tissue-specific replicating smar-based vector. combining the properties of an episomally replicating, non-integrating vector system with tissue specific promoters should in principle give a high level of biosafety when compared for example to integrating viral vector systems. nevertheless, the low efficiency of non-viral systems can be a limiting factor. recently, we improved the existing episomal vector system pepi by replacing the backbone with a cpg depleted backbone and the promoter sequence with the strong, non-silenced constitutive promoter for elongation factor 1α  <cit> . the novel vector series termed pepito was superior in expression strength both in vitro and in vivo and exhibited strongly improved establishment efficiency as a non-integrated episome leading to long term gene expression. the aim of our first experiments was to develop a pepito vector with a strong and specific promoter for liver and liver derived cancer cells, which will allow the expression of high transgene levels when used within this episomal vector construct. from our previously published work we knew that the smar element often leads to reduced transient expression levels when compared to the Δsmar control . as tissue specific promoters are usually weaker then strong, constitutive promoters like cmv or ef1α, a careful selection process is necessary to identify promoters with adequate specificity, but also sufficient strength for pepito constructs. in all experiments, transfections with either constitutive or tissue specific promoters were run in parallel and not using them as internal controls with a different transgene. although useful in other experimental setups, using a plasmid with strong constitutive promoter can potentially interfere with the transfection efficiency obtained , but also in rare recombination events, as several plasmid parts  are similar to the tested plasmid. alpha-fetoprotein is a major fetal serum protein in mammals and has it functions in ligand transport and maintaining physiologic osmolarity  <cit> . the afp gene is transcribed at high levels in the yolk sac and fetal liver, where the transcription declines dramatically after birth, resulting in barely detectable afp levels in the liver by 4 weeks of age  <cit> . in hepatocellular cancer, afp becomes active again, a mechanism which is not yet fully clarified yet. silencer sequences play a critical role in afp promoter activity, but also regulatory regions or growth related genes  <cit>  or hepatocyte nuclear factor  <dig>  <cit>  were reported to be involved in this process. the most used variant of the afp-promoter element is of murine origin including its enhancer, which exhibits  a size >2600 bp  <cit> . our 600 bp afp promoter was amplified from human genomic dna, and together with the hcmv enhancer element was only approximately 850 bp in size. the apo e enhancer is usually used in combination with the haat promoter for liver specific expression for factor ix in gene therapy  <cit> . here we omitted the haat promoter element to achieve higher specificity, as the original hybrid apo e-haat promoter achieved too high activity in hek  <dig> cells in pre-experiments . the haptoglobin promoter was chosen as it appeared to be very liver specific according to tiprod  <cit> . its gene product, haptoglobin, is an abundant haemoglobin-binding protein present in the plasma  <cit> . on the human hepatocellular cell line huh <dig>  all three liver specific promoters resulted in a weak transgene expression level far below 1% of the cmv driven activity. this is in line with observations made with other tissue specific promoters, like the murine afp promoter  <cit>  or muscle specific promoter elements  <cit> . we and other groups could show that the hcmv enhancer element boosts transgene expression of ubiquitous promoter both in vitro and in vivo, for example in lung  <cit>  or liver  <cit> . for this purpose, we cloned the hcmv enhancer element upstream of the respective promoters. although the activity of all three promoters was increased by the hcmv enhancer element, only the hcmv/afp combination gave satisfyingly high levels also several days after transfection , so it was used in the successive experiments. to ensure that with the hcmv enhancer element specificity is retained, control transfections were carried out in afp negative cell lines both of human and murine origin . after normalizing for the activity obtained with the cmv driven plasmid it could be observed that the afp positive cell lines huh <dig> and hepg <dig> were most susceptible to afp mediated transgene expression, whereas in almost all other cell lines the hcmv enhancer element just boosted basal expression levels in general . qpcr studies confirmed that the hcc cell lines huh <dig> and hepg <dig> were positive for afp expression levels  <cit> . although no detectable levels of afp mrna in the human melanoma cell line mda-mb- <dig>  this cell line was at least to a certain extent susceptible to hcmv/afp mediated transfection. approx.  <dig> % of the cmv driven transgene expression were achieved. this can be due to certain ‘leakiness’ of the afp promoter or the hcmv enhancer element, as it has been observed for viral vectors with tissue or tumor specific promoters  <cit> . apparently the leakiness of our hybrid promoter element also depends on the cell type of tumor type. we can furthermore not exclude that the observed basal activity of the afp promoter might be a indication of the tumor characteristics of all immortalized cell lines.

to prove the applicability of the afp driven pepito vector in vivo, nu/nu mice bearing subcutaneously implanted huh <dig> tumors were systemically treated with polyplexes based on lpei. such lpei polyplexes usually rapidly aggregate with blood components like erythrocytes and a considerable portion accumulates in the first vascular bed encountered, namely the lung, were they also lead to efficient transgene expression  <cit> . nevertheless, transgene expression can also be found in other organs, like liver  <cit> , and subcutaneously implanted tumors  <cit> . cmv driven transgene expression usually peaks 12-24 h after delivery, e.g. after lpei polyplex mediated delivery in lung tissue  or after hydrodynamic plasmid delivery to the liver  <cit>  and rapidly declines thereafter. measuring luciferase activity by bli 48 h after delivery, a high signal was observed in the lung area with the cmv driven plasmid, and after 72 h there was still a considerable signal remaining. luciferase activity could not be detected with the afp driven construct by bli, and was 20-fold lower after 72 h in the lysates. as the tumor expression was unchanged, we apparently could improve the in vivo specificity > <dig> fold. hence we conclude that with hcmv/afp driven transgene expression a considerable tumor specificity accompanied by strong activity in the target tissue  can be achieved. although useful for proof of principle studies like presented here, unmodified lpei is not the ideal carrier for targeting transgene expression to the tumor after systemic injection: in our experiment presented here, the level of luciferase activity in tumors strongly varied between individual animals . this variation in transfectability does not correlate with size the of huh <dig> tumors , as subcutaneous huh <dig> tumors are already hypervascularised at small diameter , and blood vessels are enlarged and highly leaky  <cit> . we expect an influence of functional blood flow, which can strongly vary between tumors, but also between different time points were polyplexes are applied. here we rather aimed at proving the de-targeting effect from lung. other, better suited delivery systems based on lpei developed in our group  are far superior for systemic huh <dig> tumor targeting, but only show very low or absent activity in non-target organs including lung  <cit> .

showing the principle usability of the afp promoter to efficiently drive transgene expression within a pepito vector in vitro and in vivo, but also some leakiness due to activity on afp negative cell lines, we examined the tissue-specific replication of a smar-based vector within a second promoter setup using similar backbone and enhancer. for this purpose the muscle specific sm <dig> promoter , was chosen. this promoter was reported to be tissue-specific and to achieve robust transgene expression levels. with the sm <dig> promoter we also expected a higher degree of specificity and less leakiness then with afp, as it has also been described by other groups  <cit> . in vivo replication for s/mar-based vector could so far only be shown after sperm-mediated gene transfer  <cit> , but not yet with transient transfection using episomal vectors  <cit> , unless recently a selection and/or a growth advantage was included into the episomal plasmids by coexpressing bcl- <dig>  <cit> . nevertheless, it has to be noted that bcl- <dig> overexpression itself is known to be antiapoptotic and this gene is upregulated in tumors. due to these difficulties and as the sm <dig> promoter is also rather weak when compared to constitutive promoters and to afp promoter , we decided to study cell specific replication within an in vitro setting. as the constitutive control, the ef1α promoter was selected, which leads to long lasting transgene expression within pepito vectors and is not prone to rapid silencing like the cmv immediate early promoter element  <cit> . as expected, transfection efficiency was high both in hek <dig> and te- <dig> cells, and in te- <dig> cells the efficiency with the Δsmar construct was even higher. this is in line with our previously published data, and is due to the fact that the transcription of the s/mar sequence decreases expression efficiency in certain cell lines  <cit> . although at lower efficiency then achieved with the ef1α driven vector, sm <dig> driven expression was significantly higher in te- <dig> cells when compared to hek <dig> pointing at the specificity of this construct . the establishment of stable clones with the ef1α driven pepito was strongly depending of the presence of the s/mar element in both cell lines. the sm <dig> only developed stable clones in te- <dig> cells at lower efficiency when compared to the ef1α driven pepito. as the transcription into the smar is crucial for the establishment of episomes  <cit> , the strength of constitutive promoters influences the extent of the expression from the established clones  <cit> . these facts are also known for minicircles . it seems to be logical, that much weaker promoters than the constitutive cmv, sv <dig> or ef1α promoters exhibit lower establishing rates, which would also explain the lower episome establishment of the muscle-specific pepito derivative. background integration for s/mar-based vector can still not be fully excluded, but was reported to be repressed  <cit> . the small amount of stably transfected hek <dig> cells with the pepito-hcmv/sm22-construct ) showed moderate expression levels , but as the plasmid could not be rescued from this cell line, this indicates an integrated status of the plasmid. apparently the background integration is dependent of the promoter expression strength, as the promoter drives the expression and selection unit of these vectors. we further conclude that for every successful rescue experiment, replicated plasmid dna could be accounted, as otherwise all experiments would have shown positive colonies. hence the number of established clones of the sm22-promoter driven construct in the te <dig> cell line represent a low, but reproducible frequency of episomal establishment. to highlight the effect of the smar element, we have normalized the data to the ef1α driven plasmid lacking the smar element. the rescue experiments  verified the episomal status of the tissue-specific pepito in the respective cells, but also confirmed the correlation between promoter strength and episomal establishment rate  <cit> : with the constitutive and strong ef1α promoter, about hundred positive bacterial colonies were found per experiment, both with dna extracts from hek <dig> and te <dig> cells, whereas with sm <dig> driven pepitos this number was significantly lower .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we present an episomal plasmid systems designed for tissue specific transgene expression and replication. the human afp-promoter in combination with the hcmv enhancer element was demonstrated to be a valuable tissue-specific promoter for targeting hepatocellular carcinomas with non-viral gene delivery system, and tissue specific replication could be shown in vitro with the muscle specific sm <dig> promoter. in combination with appropriate delivery systems, the tissue specific pepito vector system will allow higher tissue-specificity with less undesired side effects and is suitable for long term transgene expression in vivo within gene therapeutical approaches.
