BACKGROUND
cellulose is the most abundant biopolymer on earth and the main component of plant cell walls. cellulose makes 35-50% of the dry weight of plants  <cit>  and represents an important alternative source of renewable energy  <cit> . cellulose is a linear biopolymer of ß- <dig> -glycosidic linked d-glucose molecules. cellulose molecules usually consist of several thousand glucose units and can form larger crystalline structures via intermolecular hydrogen bonding. for the non-enzymatic hydrolysis of crystalline cellulose high temperatures combined with extreme ph conditions are required  <cit> .

cellulose can also be hydrolysed under milder conditions by special enzymes called cellulases. cellulases catalyze the cleavage of ß- <dig> -glycosidic bonds in the cellulose. because of their mode of action and substrate specificity they can be classified into exoglucanases , endoglucanases  and ß-glucosidases   <cit> . exoglucanases split off cellobiose and endoglucanases hydrolyze ß- <dig> -glycosidic bonds to decrease the length of the cellulose chains. ß-glucosidases subsequently hydrolyze short oligosaccharides such as cellobiose to glucose  <cit> . based on amino acid sequence similarities cellulases may be classified into different gh  families  <cit> . to date there are  <dig> gh families; cellulases  are found in families 5– <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . family  <dig> comprises endoglucanases from mesophilic and thermophilic archaea, bacteria and fungi.

the demand for stable and highly active cellulases is high  <cit> . cellulose as renewable source is an ideal low-cost starting material for the production of bioethanol that can be used as an alternative to fossil fuels. cellulose in contrast to starch and other agricultural biopolymers has the advantage that it does not compete with the nutritional demands  <cit> . to make cellulose accessible for enzymatic degradation, the biomass is pre-treated with high temperatures and strong acids. for the next degradation step extreme thermoacidophilic enzymes would be preferable. most commercial enzymes have a ph optimum near neutrality and are derived from the mesophilic fungus trichoderma reesei. in contrast, the cellulase sso <dig> from the hyperthermophilic archeaon sulfolobus solfataricus represents a thermoacidophilic enzyme, which is optimally adapted to work under acidic conditions and high temperatures.

the enzyme sso <dig>  has a ph-optimum at approximately  <dig>  as well as a temperature optimum at approximately 80°c  <cit> . to our knowledge only the protease thermopsin from sulfolobus acidocaldarius <cit>  shows a similar ph and temperature activity profile.

the protein consists of a n-terminal signal peptide, a ser/thr-rich region and a catalytic domain which shows significant homology to cellulases of glycoside hydrolase family  <dig>  <cit> . however, when sso <dig> is expressed in e. coli, it is mostly insoluble and the preparation of active enzyme through solubilisation and refolding is cumbersome. the inclusion bodies formed by sso <dig> are urea-stable and can only be solubilized with  <dig> m guanidinium chloride. refolding is possible by rapid dilution in  <dig>  m arginine. however during purification of the refolded enzyme by cation exchange chromatography the protein precipitates on the column and can only be eluted with guanidinium chloride containing buffers. we also attempted to refold and purify sso <dig> at acidic, neutral and alkaline ph values. however the best results were obtained at neutral ph. the high aggregation tendency of sso <dig> precludes its use for commercial applications or further engineering studies.

in the present study, we report the construction of hybrid proteins of the cellulases sso <dig> from sulfolobus solfataricus and cela from the thermophilic bacterium thermotoga maritima by in vitro recombination. in vitro recombination allows the combination and optimization of specific properties of different proteins. ideally, the resulting protein combines the advantageous properties of the parent proteins. recombination plays a key role in natural evolution of proteins and in the development of antibodies, synthases and proteases  <cit> . cela also belongs to gh family  <dig> and is expressed in our hands in a partially soluble form in e. coli, but shows a neutral ph optimum  <cit> . we used the program schema developed by the group of f. arnold, in order to choose suitable boundaries for chimera construction  <cit> . usually, the program schema is used to construct recombination libraries. here we show that a more targeted approach with two selected parent enzymes is feasible by obtaining a chimeric enzyme with advantageous properties.

RESULTS
sequence analysis, expression and purification of the hybrid proteins
the cellulases sso <dig> from sulfolobus solfataricus and cela from thermotoga maritima show sequence similarities and belong to gh family  <dig> . sso <dig> has a temperature and ph optimum of approximately 80°c and approximately ph  <dig>  whereas cela shows maximum activity at approximately 90–95°c and neutral ph.

for construction of the hybrid proteins the program schema was used. schema predicts favorable sites for in vitro recombination based on structural information  <cit> . we adapted the python scripts of schema in order to calculate the disruption energies of a fusion sso1949-cela and cela-sso <dig>  this analysis yielded two local minima for the disruption energy at alignment position  <dig> and  <dig>  however these constructs would have consisted mainly of one parent protein with the n-terminal part of about  <dig> amino acids substituted by the other parent protein. we have therefore not considered these predictions further. we then calculated the disruption energies for hybrid proteins of the structure cela-sso1949-cela and sso1949-cela-sso <dig>  the heat maps of the disruption energy as a function of the both recombination sites is shown for both cases in figure  <dig>  in these triangular shaped heat plots the diagonal represents the case where the middle protein fragment has a length of  <dig> alignment positions. likewise proteins corresponding to areas close to the left or upper border contain a very short n-terminal or c-terminal fragment, respectively. the further away from the three borders the more equally distributed are the lengths of the three protein fragments.

for the fusion protein cela-sso1949-cela we found low disruption energy for a protein fusion with the first recombination site at alignment position  <dig> and the second at alignment position  <dig> . this leads to a fusion protein of  <dig> amino acids cela followed by  <dig> amino acids sso <dig> and  <dig> amino acids cela . we considered this fusion as promising as the center fragment including most of the active center is derived from sso <dig> whose enzymatic properties should be retained in the hybrid enzyme. in the modeled chimeric protein the substrate cleft for the cellulose chain is from the right to the left and is lined by a curved ß-sheet . indeed the majority of the substrate cleft and the active site are derived from sso <dig> and only the substrate cleft for the non-reducing end stems from cela. a low disruption energy is also found for a chimeric protein with the recombination sites at positions  <dig> and  <dig> . however in this hybrid enzyme the parent enzyme sso <dig> would make only a minor contribution of about  <dig> amino acids to the center fragment. we therefore did not consider this possible chimeric enzyme with low disruption energy further.

for the chimeric protein with the structure sso1949-cela-sso <dig> we found three possible recombination combinations . the left-most red broken circle would represent the counterpart of the chimera we have chosen for chimera cela-sso1949-cela . we did not consider this possible chimeric enzyme as the center fragment including most of the active site would be derived from cela which does not show thermoacidophilic properties we aim for. for the same reason we also refrained from constructing the chimera with the recombination sites around the alignment positions  <dig> and  <dig> . this chimeric protein would also have a dominant center fragment derived from cela. for the fusion sso1949-cela-sso <dig> we therefore choose the recombination sites at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  yielding a fusion protein of  <dig> amino acids sso <dig> followed by  <dig> amino acids cela and  <dig> amino acids sso <dig>  the predicted schema disruption energy of this chimeric enzyme is somewhat higher with  <dig> but the parent sso <dig> makes a more prominent contribution to the chimeric protein than with the latter two possibilities. the modeled structure  shows that the catalytic center with the two catalytic glutamate residues is derived from sso <dig> whereas the reducing end of the substrate binding cleft comes from cela.

both hybrid proteins were constructed and expressed in e. coli strain bl <dig> ai. the proteins were produced in high yields in e. coli but aggregated in inclusion bodies. the recombinant protein cela-sso1949-cela consists of  <dig> amino acids and migrates in sds gels with an apparent mass of approximately  <dig> kda, which agrees with the theoretical mass . sso1949-cela-sso <dig> consists of  <dig> amino acids and shows a molecular weight of approximately  <dig> kda. the activity of the hybrid proteins was verified by cmc-plates. for this purpose the solubilised inclusion bodies were spotted directly onto carboxymethylcellulose plates. after incubating the plates overnight and staining with congo red, only cela-sso1949-cela shows activity. sso1949-cela-sso <dig> was inactive in this assay. noteworthy, both parent enzymes expressed in e. coli also shows activity in this assay. we therefore concluded that the enzymatic activity of the fusion sso1949-cela-sso <dig> is severely compromised and continued working only with the hybrid cela-sso1949-cela.

because the hybrid protein was insoluble we applied an inclusion body washing step with increasing concentration of urea  where a majority of the e. coli host proteins could be removed. next we refolded the fusion protein. previously we have screened the refolding of recombinant sso <dig> with  <dig> buffers and found that  <dig>  m arginine containing refolding buffer yield active enzyme . refolding of the fusion protein cela-sso1949-cela with an arginine containing buffer was successful and the soluble and active enzyme was purified and concentrated by hydrophobic interaction chromatography with a propyl-column .

enzymatic characterization of cela-sso1949-cela
for detailed characterization of cellulase activity a fret -based assay was used. the substrate consists of  <dig> ß- <dig> -linked glucose units and carries a fluorophore  at the reducing end and a chromophore at the non-reducing end  <cit> . incubation of cela-sso1949-cela with the fluorescent cellohexaoside leads to an increase in fluorescence at  <dig> nm, which indicates the cleavage of the substrate. the measured fluorescence is proportional to the number of hydrolysed substrate molecules. the fret-assay is sensitive and the used substrate is even stable under the extreme ph and temperature conditions.

measurements of initial rates at various substrate concentrations yielded a km value of  <dig>  μm and the maximal velocity of  <dig>  μmol∙min-1mg- <dig> at 80°c and ph  <dig>  this value is close to the specific activity of sso <dig> of  <dig>  μmole∙min-1mg- <dig> <cit>  but much lower than the specific activity of cela. the maximal velocity of the hybrid protein translates to a kcat of  <dig>  s- <dig> under the assumption that the enzyme preparation is wholly active . the hybrid protein did not hydrolyse the substrate p-nitrophenyl-ß-d-cellobioside. this property of the enzyme has been taken over from sso <dig>  which also does not degrade p-nitrophenyl-ß-d-cellobioside  <cit> . possibly the reducing end substrate binding cleft derived from sso <dig> requires a sugar moiety at the + <dig> subsite.

ph and temperature dependence of cela-sso1949-cela
the hybrid protein cela-sso1949-cela shows like sso <dig> an optimal activity at acidic ph and high temperatures. the activity measurements with the fret-substrate at different ph values reveal a ph profile with an optimum at ph  <dig> . the parents sso <dig> and cela have a ph optimum at  <dig>  for sso <dig> and ph  <dig>  for cela. endpoint measurements for the hybrid protein revealed a temperature optimum at 85°c. the temperature dependence of the activity allows calculating the activation energy of the enzymatic reaction which is approximately  <dig> kj/mol . the activation energy for the parent enzyme sso <dig> is  <dig> kj/mol  <cit> .

discussion
the hyperthermophilic cellulase sso <dig> is optimally adapted to work under acidic conditions and high temperatures. because of these unique properties, sso <dig> is a good starting point to develop thermoacidophilic cellulases for biotechnological purposes. sso <dig> is expressed insoluble in e. coli and has a great tendency to aggregate even after refolding therefore large scale production of this protein is difficult to achieve. the thermophilic enzyme cela in contrast, is expressed in partly soluble form in e. coli, but shows the highest enzymatic activity at around ph  <dig>  for the fluorescent cellohexaoside and ph  <dig>  for p-nitrophenyl-ß-d-cellobioside .

the aim of this study was to develop a hybrid protein in which the three positive characteristics thermophily, acidophily and improved solubility can be combined.

before constructing the hybrid proteins we used the software schema to assess putative recombination points for both parent enzymes. the calculations suggested two chimeric proteins, which were then further pursued. cela-sso1949-cela was n- and c-terminally flanked by cela with the biggest part of the catalytic region of sso <dig>  the second protein sso1949-cela-sso <dig> consists mainly of sso <dig>  only a part of substrate binding cleft is replaced by cela. both hybrid proteins were overexpressed, but in an insoluble form. furthermore the enzyme sso1949-cela-sso <dig> proved to be inactive after refolding attempts. possibly, in this chimeric protein critical interactions necessary for catalysis have been disturbed. noteworthy the disruption energy calculated by schema was also nearly twofold as high as for the other chimeric enzyme.

we were more successful with the hybrid protein cela-sso1949-cela. the protein also aggregated in inclusion bodies but could be refolded into active protein and was far less prone to aggregation than the parent sso <dig>  the solubility of the hybrid protein is considerably improved in comparison with sso <dig>  the hybrid protein can be completely purified from inclusion bodies using  <dig> m urea. for purification of sso <dig> stronger denaturants such as guanidinium chloride was needed.

to compare the enzymatic activity of cela-sso1949-cela with sso <dig> and cela the enzymatic characterization was done with a fret substrate. the hybrid protein showed a roughly bell-shaped ph profile, which is caused by the ionization states of the two catalytic acidic residues. the ph optimum was approximately at ph  <dig> which is almost exactly in the middle of the two ph optima of sso <dig>  and cela . by endpoint measurement a temperature optimum of 85°c for cela-sso1949-cela could be determined. the specific activity of the hybrid is lower than the specific activities of the parent proteins. at ph  <dig> and 80°c the specific activity of cela-sso1949-cela was  <dig>  μmole∙min-1mg- <dig> with the non-saturating substrate concentration of  <dig> μm cellohexaoside. the turnover number kcat under the assumption of a fully active enzyme preparation and saturating concentrations of the fret-substrate is  <dig>  s- <dig>  this corresponds to a kcat/km value of  <dig>  ×  <dig> s-1m- <dig> 

the molecular basis for the extremely low ph optimum of sso <dig> is currently unknown. there have been a few attempts to influence the ph optimum of endoglucanases by substituting selected amino acid residues in the neighborhood of the catalytic glutamate residues. this approach has been very successful in the case of the xylanase c from aspergillus kawachii. this enzyme belongs to glycoside hydrolase family  <dig> which is structurally similar to the glycoside hydrolase family  <dig>  in this enzyme the exchange of an aspartate residue to an asparagine residue raised the ph optimum from  <dig>  to  <dig>   <cit>  albeit at the expense of a reduction of the specific activity to only 15%. similar experiments in the direction to lower the ph optimum of xylanases were much less successful. in the case of the xylanase a from bacillus circulans the exchange of an asparagine residue to an aspartate residue lowered the ph optimum from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and increased the specific activity to about 120%  <cit> . a similar extent of ph optimum change was also seen for the xylanase i from streptomyces sp. here the ph optimum dropped from  <dig>  to  <dig>  when asparagine was exchanged to aspartate at the homologous position. the mutation also resulted in a decrease of the specific activity to about 50%. these studies indicate that this residue in the neighborhood of the catalytic center is important for the ph optimum of the respective enzymes. in an attempt to lower the ph optimum of the thermotoga maritima enzyme cela we mutated valine  <dig>  the homologous residue. to our disappointment the change v63t using the threonine residue of the sulfolobus enzyme resulted in a mutated enzyme with an unchanged ph optimum but a largely decreased specific activity . a second attempt exchanging four amino acids at this position  resulted in a drop of the ph optimum to  <dig>  which is one ph unit lower than the optimal ph with the substrate p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-cellobioside . our failure to achieve a substantial ph change by performing mutations at a selected position known to influence the ph optimum in related enzymes motivated us to construct the chimeric enzymes presented in this work.

CONCLUSIONS
of the two hybrid enzymes one chimera possess advantageous properties: it still exhibits a low ph optimum, a high temperature optimum and a high specific activity and most importantly it can be easily produced and purified from recombinant e. coli. this example suggests that the targeted construction of chimeric enzymes is a viable alternative to point mutational studies provided that parent enzymes with the wanted properties are available.
