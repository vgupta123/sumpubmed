BACKGROUND
quercetinase  catalyzes the  <dig> -dioxygenolytic cleavage of quercetin, a flavonol that is produced by numerous plants, to form carbon monoxide and the depside  2-protocatechuoylphoroglucinol carboxylic acid . the bacterial and fungal quercetinases that have been characterized to date all belong to the cupin superfamily  <cit> . the cupin domain is characterized by a β-barrel fold which comprises two conserved motifs with the consensus sequences g5hxh <dig> e6g and g5pxg2h3n. the conserved glutamate and the three histidine residues provide the ligands for a divalent metal ion in the active center of the enzyme  <cit>  . among the fungal quercetinases, the enzyme of aspergillus japonicus has been characterized most intensively  <cit> . it is an extracellular glycoprotein with a bicupin scaffold, i.e., each subunit consists of two cupin domains. two examples of bacterial quercetinases have been reported; both are cytoplasmic proteins. the enzyme of bacillus subtilis consists of bicupin subunits that form a homodimer  <cit> , whereas the enzyme of streptomyces sp. fla, which shows  <dig> % sequence identity with the c-terminal cupin domain of bacillus quercetinase, is a dimer of monocupin subunits  <cit> .scheme  <dig> conversion of quercetin to 2-protocatechuoylphloroglucinol carboxylic acid, catalyzed by quercetinase .



the majority of dioxygenases require a metal cofactor for catalysis, which is most often a nonheme iron  <cit> . interestingly, all the extracellular fungal quercetinases isolated so far rely on a mononuclear copper center for activity  <cit> , whereas the cytoplasmic quercetinases of b. subtilis and streptomyces sp. fla appear to be promiscuous enzymes capable of using different metal ions for catalysis. bacillus quercetinase has originally been purified from a recombinant e. coli host grown in lb  as an iron protein  <cit> . reconstitution experiments suggested that co, cu, and mn also support catalysis  <cit> , and characterization of the kinetic parameters of the mn- and co-forms revealed that the catalytic efficiency was highest for the mn-enzyme  <cit> . in contrast to bacillus qued, streptomyces qued, purified from recombinant e. coli cells grown with various metal ions, was found to be most active with ni2+, which is highly unusual for oxygenases  <cit> . however, in this as well as in other studies on bacterial quercetinases, the proteins were heterologously produced in e. coli. as pointed out in a recent review, when using a high-expression heterologous system for the synthesis of ni-qued, “the relevance to metal speciation of protein in the native host remains unclear”  <cit> .

streptomyces sp. strain fla grows very poorly on quercetin as sole carbon source  <cit> . transcription of the qued gene of strain fla is induced by quercetin, however, the regulatory mechanism remained elusive. an effect of ni2+ on qued expression was not observed  <cit> . because quercetin shows antibacterial activity, acting on multiple cellular targets  <cit> , it is conceivable that a major physiological role of quercetinase is to detoxify the flavonol. the quercetin o-methylation, hydroxylation, or glycosylation reactions mediated by various streptomyces spp.  <cit>  may serve the same function.

in this study, we prepared different metal forms of streptomyces qued by in vivo and in vitro approaches, to identify the physiologically relevant metal cofactor, and to find out which factors determine metal selection. replacement of individual residues of the 3his/1glu motif gave insight into the significance of the amino acid ligands for metal occupancy, protein folding, and function.

RESULTS
metal selectivity and catalytic activity of recombinant qued
to enable a systematic study of the metal selectivity of qued, as well as of the effects of different transition metal ions on quercetinase activity, we produced the enzyme recombinantly in e. coli which was grown in media supplemented with an excess of the metal ion of interest. preparations of c-terminally strep-tagged qued, purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from cells grown in ni2+-supplemented medium , generally contained about  <dig>  −  <dig>  equivalents of nickel per protein monomer. cobalt contents of qued isolated from cells grown in cocl2-supplemented medium varied significantly between the batches . qued protein produced by recombinant e. coli grown in fe2+-supplemented medium showed varying iron contents in the range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  equivalents of iron per protein monomer. when qued was purified from cells grown in medium supplemented with 30 μm mncl <dig>  the proteins contained only between  <dig>  to  <dig>  equivalents of mn and varying amounts of other metals, predominantly ni, but also fe and zn. increasing the concentration of mncl <dig> in the cultivation medium to 1 mm did not increase the mn occupancy of the recombinant protein. to assess the effect of the metal ion on the overall structure of the protein, the cd spectra of ni-, co-, fe- and mn-qued produced in vivo were recorded. the spectra were very similar and characteristic of proteins that are predominantly composed of β-sheets .figure  <dig> far-uv cd spectra of qued proteins produced in vivo and in vitro.

the catalytic activity of the recombinant proteins decreased in the order ni-qued > co-qued > mn-qued . an estimation of the metal-related specific activities of qued forms, i.e., the specific activities if qued were fully occupied with the metal of interest , suggests that the iron form of qued is not catalytically competent.table  <dig>

characterization of a zn-form of qued would be very interesting from a mechanistic point of view, because the zn2+ ion is redox-inert in biological systems. however, attempts to produce zn-qued by the in vivo approach resulted in protein preparations that contained nickel rather than zinc .

since fungal quercetinases depend on a cu2+ center, it also would be interesting to characterize a cu-form of the bacterial qued. however, in the reducing environment of the e. coli cytoplasm, copper ions are in the cu1+ state, and attempts to produce cu-qued by the standard expression system were not successful. fusing qued to pelb- or dsba-leader peptides in order to secrete the recombinant qued to the e. coli periplasm resulted in formation of intracellular rather than periplasmic protein, precluding the production of cu-qued by periplasmic cu2+ incorporation.

in summary, the order of metal ions according to occupancy of recombinant qued is ni ≈ co > fe > mn, while in terms of activity we observe the ranking ni > co > mn.

qued from the wild-type strain, streptomyces sp. fla
the bacterial quercetinases described to date were all produced heterologously in e. coli. they were observed to be promiscuous with respect to metal ion incorporation, thus their natural cofactor incorporated by the original wild-type strain remained unassigned  <cit> . using a four-step protocol, qued from streptomyces sp. fla was purified to approximately 91% electrophoretic homogeneity, as deduced from densitometric analysis of the coomassie-stained gel . according to icp-ms  analysis, the protein preparation contained  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  equivalents of ni, zn, fe and cu, respectively, per monomer. we cannot exclude the possibility that the purification protocol enriches distinct metal forms of qued, however, qued activity eluted as distinct peaks from the columns. because heterologously produced qued can incorporate cobalt or manganese besides nickel and iron , it is remarkable that the content of these metals was below detection, especially as the mineral salts medium used for growth of streptomyces contained cocl <dig>  and mncl <dig>  besides nicl <dig> . the relatively high contents of zinc in the protein preparation were surprising. the growth medium was supplemented with  <dig>  nm znso <dig>  but as cells accumulate metal ions to a different extent, zinc may be concentrated by a high factor. the protein preparation, which contained minor amounts of other proteins, showed a specific activity of  <dig> u mg− <dig> . considering that recombinant qued with a nickel occupancy of 33% should have a specific activity of about  <dig> u mg− <dig> , the catalytic activity of wild-type qued is likely mediated by a ni2+ center.

cell-free protein synthesis  of qued in the presence of metal ions
from the analysis of qued proteins produced in vivo, it is difficult to assess to which extent metal ion availability and/or intrinsic preferences of the protein determine metal incorporation. to exclude effects caused by the limited in vivo availability of free metal ions, we aimed at producing qued using in vitro approaches. however, in vitro reconstitution experiments, following protocols used for other cupin proteins  <cit> , resulted in precipitation of qued. therefore, we tested an e. coli cell-free coupled transcription-translation system for production of different metal forms of the qued protein. there are relatively few studies on cell-free synthesis of metalloproteins in the literature. for example, successful synthesis by in vitro transcription-translation systems was reported for manganese peroxidase   <cit> , a ferredoxin  <cit> ,  hydrogenase  <cit> , and cu,zn-superoxide dismutase  <cit> . the yields reported were in the range of about 30 − 50 μg ml− <dig>  <cit>  or lower and seldom reached several 100 μg of protein from 1 ml reaction  <cit> . often only part of the total protein was functional  <cit> .

in order to identify suitable conditions for cfps in the presence of metal ions, we first used a qued-egfp fusion protein as reporter, and determined the relative protein level by measuring egfp fluorescence during cfps. at concentrations below or equal to 1 mm of ni2+, fe2+, or mn2+, the relative egfp fluorescence intensities in the coupled transcription-translation reactions were similar to those observed in cfps reactions performed in the absence of additional metal ions , suggesting that these metals do not significantly affect translational efficiency in general. in case of cfps reactions in the presence of ni2+ or mn2+, the quercetinase activity in the samples increased with increasing metal concentration in the reaction mixtures  . unfortunately, zinc and copper ions had an inhibitory effect on the efficiency of qued-egfp synthesis , as also reported in cfps studies on other metalloproteins  <cit> ). the absence of quercetinase activity in the cu2+- and zn2+-cfps samples  suggested that cu2+ and zn2+ are either not incorporated into the qued-egfp fusion protein, or do not support catalysis.

to purify  qued proteins synthesized by cfps, reactions were performed on a 1 ml scale in the presence of ni2+, mn2+, or fe2+/3+, or zn2+ or cu2+, and the proteins were prepared by strep-tactin affinity chromatography. the isolation of qued proteins was verified in western blots of denaturing polyacrylamide gels . far-uv cd spectra were recorded to find out whether the proteins synthesized in vitro have adopted the same overall fold as those produced in vivo . the spectrum of qued produced in ni2+-supplemented cfps reactions retained the characteristics of that of the ni-qued formed in vivo, with a negative band at about 215 nm and a positive band at 198 nm, indicating that qued in the presence of nickel ions is able to fold to its native state in vitro. the protein produced in the presence of 1 mm mn2+ retained a high β-sheet content. in contrast, the cd spectra of the proteins obtained from cfps in presence of cu2+ , zn2+ , fe2+ or fe3+  differ significantly from that of the nickel enzyme. thus, the metal ions tested can be ordered as ni > mn > > zn, fe, cu according to their effect on secondary structure of qued. altogether, the findings suggest that while the efficiency of cfps is similar in the presence of ni2+, mn2+ or fe2+, in the in vitro situation only nickel ions support qued folding to its native state.

qued purified from cfps reactions supplemented with ni2+ and mn2+ showed quercetinase activities of  <dig>  u mg− <dig> and  <dig>  u mg− <dig>  respectively. for qued isolated from cfps-reactions supplemented with cu2+, zn2+, fe2+ or fe3+, the activity was approximately  <dig>  u mg− <dig>  control experiments without metal ion supplementation indicated that such residual activity cannot be attributed to the supplemented metals, however, traces of mn2+ and/or ni2+ ions present in the e. coli extracts may confer activity to a subpopulation of the in vitro produced proteins. in terms of catalytic activity of qued metal forms, we therefore obtain the ranking ni > mn.

replacement of the 3his/1glu ligand amino acids of ni-qued
to analyze the role of the metal-ligating amino acids for the structural integrity and function of ni-qued, the individual residues of the 3his/1glu motif  were replaced by site-directed mutagenesis, and the qued proteins produced by the respective e. coli strain grown in ni2+-supplemented medium were purified and characterized with respect to metal contents, catalytic activity, and ability to bind quercetin . all variants, with the exception of the h69a substitution, showed a decrease in nickel contents compared to the wild-type protein, and a relative increase in the zinc contents pointing towards a somewhat relaxed metal specificity. the kd values of the protein-quercetin complexes show that all protein variants retained a high affinity for the organic substrate. replacement of the histidine residues at position  <dig> or  <dig> with alanine resulted in catalytically inactive protein variants, whereas the qued-h71a and -e76d proteins retained marginal activity . the cd spectra of the protein variants showed an increased intensity of the negative band  and a hypsochromic  shift of the positive band  compared to the wild type protein . thus, the loss of activity could be due to perturbation of the secondary structure.table  <dig>

replacement of e <dig> by histidine resulted in a protein that showed about 2% of the activity of the wild-type protein and an about 8-fold decreased kd value compared to that of the quercetin complex with ni-qued . interestingly, the cd spectrum of the ni-qued-e76h protein was nearly superimposable to that of ni-qued , demonstrating that, in contrast to the other protein variants tested, the e76h variant retained the wild-type conformation. this was also observed for the cobalt form of this protein . to verify that the mutant protein catalyzes the same reaction as wild-type qued, the organic products of quercetin conversion by co-qued and co-qued-e76h were extracted and subjected to lc/ms analysis. the lc elution profiles were identical and both showed a main peak at a retention time of  <dig>  min. esi mass spectrometry of the corresponding peaks revealed ions at m/z  <dig>   and  <dig>   for + and +, respectively. this corresponds to the previously observed mass for the molecular ion of the product of quercetin conversion by recombinant ni- and co-qued and is consistent with formation of the depside 2-protocatechuoylphloroglucinol carboxylic acid   <cit> . the possibility that the same product could also result from a  <dig> -dioxygenolytic side reaction to form an α-oxo acid, and subsequent hydrolysis to formate and the depside, was examined by determining the concentration of formate in enzyme assays. previous analysis of the reaction of  ni- and co-qued had revealed an amount of formate corresponding to about  <dig> % of the quercetin converted  <cit> . in the reaction of strep-tagged co-qued, the formate detected corresponded to  <dig> %  of substrate converted, whereas  <dig> %  of side product was observed in the reaction of the co-qued-e76h protein. thus, both the wild-type and the mutant co protein mediate this side reaction to a similar extent.

the observation that ni- and co-qued-e76h were the only proteins in the series of variants that retained the wild-type fold may suggest that the metal ion is coordinated by four amino acid ligands in these variants, i.e., in a 4his motif instead of the canonical 3his/1glu motif. the hsab concept predicts a higher stability of the ni/his complex compared to a ni/glu complex, because the ligating nitrogen of his is softer than the ligating oxygen in glu, leading to a larger stability of complexes with the soft ni ion . the e76h variant shows an increase in affinity for its electron-rich organic substrate, indicated by the low kd value . this effect might be due to the altered charge distribution around the metal, since a carboxylate ligand  transfers more charge to the metal ion than an imidazole nitrogen. alternatively, or additionally, subtle rearrangements of all the ligands around the metal may account for the decrease of the kd value of ni-qued-e76h compared to that of the ni-qued-quercetin complex.

discussion
bacterial quercetinases have been described to be able to use a defined set of different metal ions for catalysis, but the molecular basis of such metal selection is largely unclear. when using a recombinant high-expression system in e. coli for the production of streptomyces qued, the metal contents of the purified proteins suggested that qued binds mn2+, fe2+, co2+, and ni2+ in the order mn < fe < co ≈ ni. this ranking is similar to the irving-williams series, which describes the stability of divalent transition-metal complexes as mn2+ < fe2+ < co2+ < ni2+ < cu2+ > zn2+  <cit> . interestingly, qued purified from the wild-type streptomyces sp. strain contained mainly nickel and zinc. however, quantitative metal analyses cannot distinguish between metal ions unspecifically adsorbed to the protein surface or those coordinated to the conserved metal-binding 3his/1glu motif of the cupin protein.

because the concentrations of “free” transition metal ions are thought to be in the 10− <dig> to 10−15 m range  <cit> , metal incorporation into qued in the e. coli expression system may be limited by metal ion availability. in contrast, the cell-free transcription-translation system allows for supplementation with defined metal ion concentrations. to outcompete divalent ions possibly brought in by the highly concentrated e. coli extracts used in the cfps reactions, we added metal ions in excess, at concentrations which still supported protein synthesis . the cd spectra and activity data of the qued forms produced in vitro indicated that intrinsic properties of the protein rather than metal ion availability govern the formation of native metalloenzyme, with ni2+ as the strongly preferred ion.

the coordination geometry of the metal center should play a significant role in determining the preference of qued for its active-site ion. ni2+ centers with metal binding by a 3his/1glu motif show a preference for octahedral geometry  <cit> . co2+ and mn2+ centers are usually also hexa-coordinated with an octahedral geometry  <cit> . zn2+ typically has coordination numbers of four or five in active sites of enzymes, with a preference for tetrahedral geometry  <cit> . cu2+ bound to proteins is typically coordinated by four ligands in a square planar geometry  <cit> , or with an additional water ligand positioned to form a trigonal bipyramidal geometry  <cit> . fe2+ complexes in proteins are either penta- or hexa-coordinated, with penta-coordination as most common  <cit> . possibly, formation of native, catalytically competent  qued correlates with the propensity of the metal ions to form an octahedral complex geometry, as dictated by the ligands that constitute the metal binding site of the protein. if so, the metal center of streptomyces qued would comprise two additional ligands  besides the four amino acid ligands and thus would be different from that of copper-dependent a. japonicus quercetinase, which shows a penta-coordinated metal center with  <dig> his,  <dig> glu and one water molecule  <cit> . interestingly, an octahedral coordination sphere was also proposed for the catalytically highly active mn-qued of b. subtilis  <cit> , whereas its less active fe-form, which has been crystallized, is penta-coordinate with a square pyramidal or distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry  <cit> . thus, the geometry of the nickel center of streptomyces qued may be different from that shown in figure  <dig> which is based on homology modelling using the crystal structure of quercetinase of b. subtilis as template.

the cd spectra of qued proteins carrying replacements of individual residues of the 3his/1glu motif suggested that all four residues are important for structural integrity of qued, although glu <dig> can be exchanged to histidine without affecting the secondary structure of the protein. the important structural role of both metal and ligands in qued is in contrast to several other cupin proteins, which tolerate the substitution of individual metal-coordinating amino acid residues or which even retain their structure upon in vitro metal depletion  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
streptomyces quercetinase , a metal dependent flavonol dioxygenase with a cupin fold, is rather promiscuous with respect to the incorporated metal ion. this study shows that qued produced in a heterologous host requires ni2+, co2+ or mn2+, i.e. metal ions that prefer an octahedral coordination geometry, for native secondary structure content and catalytic activity. ni2+ ions support the formation of native qued in a cell-free transcription/translation system. the in vivo and in vitro data suggest that metal ion specificity of qued is determined by both chemical stability  and intrinsic geometric constraints dictated by the metalloprotein. taking all criteria together, ni appears to be the physiologically optimal ion for streptomyces quercetinase. crystal structures of qued, as well as of qued-e76h protein and enzyme-substrate complexes, would be most interesting to compare this bacterial quercetinase to the fungal copper quercetinase with atomic resolution.
