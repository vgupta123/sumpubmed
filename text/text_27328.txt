BACKGROUND
ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome  is a severe complication of ovulation induction in in vitro fertilization  treatment. the incidence of ohss occurs in about  <dig> –4% of ovulation induction treatments  <cit> , is increasing around the world through the expansion of infertility treatments. ohss is characterized by massive cystic enlargement of the ovaries associated with third space fluid shift. this can result in the formation of ascites and pleural effusion in severe conditions due to increased peritoneal epithelial permeability  <cit> . severe ohss can be accompanied by hypercoagulability, thromboembolic phenomena, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and even death. although this syndrome has been identified for a long time, the exact mechanism of ohss induction is not clear. an increased epithelial permeability is the initial change leading to ohss  <cit> . many cytokines and vasoactive and angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor , have been implicated as major mediators of the pathogenesis of capillary leakage and endothelial damage in ohss  <cit> .

fluid effluxing across epithelial cells is followed by ion movements. ion movements play a crucial role in the movement of water across epithelial cells, as water fluctuation depends on the opening and closing of aquaporins  actively and inactively transported as it follows ion movements according to osmotic gradients  <cit> . rapid passage of fluid into luminal spaces, as seen in ohss, may be a consequence of abnormal ion transport across the epithelial cells. several pathological conditions, such as cholera-induced diarrhea, in which there is massive fluid efflux of ion and water across epithelial membranes, are mediated by altered expression and function of transepithelial ion channels, particularly cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator   <cit> . cystic fibrosis is manifested by mutations in cftr  <cit> , the most common lethal genetic disease in caucasians, with a hallmark defect in epithelial electrolyte and fluid transport throughout the body  <cit> . a previous study only focused on the reproductive system effect of cftr on ohss, but did not investigate cftr in the peritoneal epithelial cells  <cit> . meanwhile, in the process of fluid effusion, water efflux involves a water  pathway by which ion and other osmotic gradients drive water movement  <cit> . so the coactions of ion channels and aqp <dig> such as cftr  <cit>  are important in the process of fluid effusion.

cftr is expressed in most epithelial cells including the airways and gastrointestinal and reproductive tracts  <cit> . its expression is known to be regulated by ovarian hormones  <cit> , upregulated by estrogen, and down regulated by progesterone  <cit> . cyclic changes in cftr expression and its channel activity have been correlated with cyclic changes in uterine fluid volume  <cit> . meanwhile, the water channel aqp <dig> is expressed strongly throughout microvascular endothelia except the central nervous system, such as in the kidneys, lungs, skins, secretory glands, skeletal muscles, pleura and peritoneum  <cit> . aqp <dig> is involved in fluid transport  <cit> , and facilitates water movement from capillaries into the peritoneal cavity  <cit> . its expression is also regulated by ovarian hormones  <cit> . it has also been well established that estrogen levels are highly elevated during ovarian hyper stimulation, with excessively high levels observed in patients with ohss  <cit> . we, therefore, hypothesized that increased estrogen levels during ovarian hyper stimulation may lead to upregulated cftr and aqp <dig> expression and channel activity, resulting in the elevated epithelial secretory activity. the most prominent feature of ohss is marked with ascites or even pleural effusion almost always associated with the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin   <cit> . so we chose peritoneal epithelial cell model for the study of coactions of cftr and aqp <dig> in ohss development.

RESULTS
up regulation of cftr and aqp <dig> expression in peritoneal epithelial cells
combinations of gonadotropins including hmg, fsh, or pmsg in conjunction with hcg were used to trigger ohss. in our study, rat hyper stimulation was defined by the observation of either fluid accumulation in the peritoneal cavity and thorax, or increased body weight  in contrast to the saline-treated control rats . body weight was measured, and ascites was collected by performing a lower midline incision and completely draining the intra-abdominal fluid into a flask. after ascites was collected, the diaphragm was cut off by scissors and pleural effusion volume was also collected. the effusion volumes were then measured with a 1-ml tuberculin syringe respectively. most prominently, the increase of ascites volume and pleural effusion volume in the hyper stimulated rats was significantly different from that in the controls . this was associated with elevated cftr and aqp <dig> expression in peritoneal epithelial cells .

estrogen upregulated cftr and aqp <dig> expression and induced ohss in rats
estrogen levels were measured in our pmsg/hcg-induced ohss rats and those control rats at both estrous and diestrous stages of the estrous cycle. more than 5-fold increase in estrogen levels was found in the ohss rats compared with that in the control . we also found that hyper stimulation did not produce ohss symptom in ovariectomized rats. however, treatment of ovariectomized rats with estrogen , but not progesterone  for  <dig> d, induced wt increase compared with ovariectomized control  and increased cftr and aqp <dig> expression in peritoneal epithelial cells  similar to the ohss rat model. furthermore, progesterone suppressed the action of estrogen on ohss induction and cftr and aqp <dig> expression up regulation . these results suggest that the ovarian sex hormone, estrogen, but not progesterone, is responsible for the up regulation of cftr and aqp <dig> leading to ohss.

effect of ohss on peritoneal epithelial cftr channel activity in rats
we compared cftr activity between freshly isolated peritoneal epithelial cells of normal and ohss rats by isc measurement. in the presence of an epithelial sodium channel blocker, amiloride , the forskolin-induced isc from the peritoneal epithelia of ohss rats  was substantially increased compared with that in untreated controls at the diestrous or estrous stages of the sexual cycle . the camp-dependent isc could be blocked by a cftr specific inhibitor- <dig> , confirming that the observed camp-activated isc reflects cftr channel activity. the results showed that cftr channel activity was enhanced in ohss.

effect of estrogen and progesterone on the peritoneal epithelial cftr channel activity
the effect of exogenously administrated estrogen and progesterone for  <dig> d on peritoneum cftr channel activity was examined. isc measurements showed that forskolin-induced or cftr-mediated isc in estrogen-treated peritoneum  was significantly higher than that in progesterone-treated ones . besides, progesterone suppressed estrogen induced cftr-mediated isc in estrogen-treated peritoneum .

progesterone downregulated cftr and aqp <dig> expression and suppressed ohss rats
progesterone treatment  of pmsg/hcg-induced ohss rats significantly reduced wt increase, ascites volume and pleural effusion volume . progesterone treatment of ohss rats also significantly reduced cftr and aqp <dig> protein expression . besides, a selective progesterone antagonist, mifepristone irrigation significantly reduced the reverse of progesterone to ohss symptoms of rats as well as cftr and aqp <dig> expression reduction in peritoneal epithelial cells . it may be the reason why progesterone was found to significantly lower the incidence of ohss in ivf cycles in a few clinical situations for luteal support during assisted reproductive technology   <cit> .

coaction of the peritoneal epithelial cftr and aqp <dig> channel activity in the development of ohss
we found that aqp <dig> inhibitor  could suppress the cftr activity in the freshly isolated peritoneal epithelial cells of ohss rats by the short circuit current  measurement. for the ohss rats , in the presence of an aqp <dig> inhibitor, hgcl <dig> , the forskolin-induced isc from the peritoneal epithelial cells of ohss rats  was substantially decreased compared with that in untreated controls of the ohss rats . furthermore, treatment of noncycling pmsg-/hcg-induced ohss rats  with  <dig> μl cftr antiserum  or 400μl aqp <dig> antiserum  by ip injection to suppress the function of cftr or aqp <dig> resulted in the elimination of body wt increase, ascites volumes and pleural effusion volumes .

discussion
in addition to being a chloride channel, cftr, may function as a regulator of other channels, including aquaporin water channels  and epithelial sodium channels. enhancement of aquaporin channel activity  <cit>  and suppression of epithelial sodium channel-mediated absorptive activity  <cit>  that results in net increases in electrolyte and fluid secretion may also contribute to the pathogenesis of ohss.

to test this hypothesis, we developed the ohss rat model by using several combinations of gonadotropins as previously described  <cit> . there was a marked increase in fluid accumulation in the peritoneal cavity and pleural cavity . therefore, the increased body wt in the hyperstimulated rats was significantly different from those in the controls . enhanced cftr and aqp <dig> expression in body cavity peritoneal epithelial cells was observed in the ohss rats . thus, up-regulated cftr and aqp <dig> expression in peritoneal epithelial cells is correlated with the fluid accumulation observed in the body cavity of ohss animals. it has been well documented that ohss patients have high plasma estrogen levels  <cit> . it is possible that hyper stimulation of ovaries leads to high production and release of estrogen, which is responsible for the upregulation of cftr and aqp <dig> observed. this may explain why ohss may not occur or may become severe despite high estrogen levels in some individuals who could have cftr mutations and defective cftr function.

estrogen levels had been monitored in the induced ohss rats as well as in the controls at both estrous and diestrous stages of the estrous cycle. the results showed that estrogen levels increased over 6-fold in the ohss rats compared with that in the controls , which is consistent with other ohss animal models  <cit> . the relationship between elevation of estrogen alone and ohss had been investigated by developing of ohss symptoms in ovariectomized rats. it confirmed that hyper stimulation did not produce ohss symptoms in these ovariectomized rats unless treated with estrogen, but not progesterone, for  <dig> days . furthermore, progesterone suppressed estrogen induced ohss symptom as well as cftr and aqp <dig> expression upregulation . exogenous estrogen induced wt increase as well as cftr and aqp <dig> expression upregulation in ovariectomized rats, similar to those in the ohss rat model without ovariectomy . it should be noted that although estrogen drastically increased cftr and aqp <dig> expression, progesterone completely suppressed both of them in ovariectomized rats. this is consistent with previous results obtained in ovary-intact animals showing upregulation and downregulation of cftr by estrogen and progesterone, respectively  <cit> . ohss symptoms and cftr upregulation in peritoneal epithelial cells were also observed in ovary-intact rats treated with high levels of estrogen, but not progesterone . the serum level of exogenously administrated estrogen was similar to the estrogen levels in ohss rats . these results suggest that the ovarian sex hormone, estrogen, but not progesterone, is responsible for the upregulation of cftr and aqp <dig> leading to ohss. these results support the clinical observation that ohss rarely develops in individuals undergoing ovarian hyper stimulation in the absence of high estrogen levels  <cit> .

to confirm that up regulation of cftr indeed leads to enhancement of its channel activity, from where excessive epithelial fluid secretion derives, we compared functional cftr activity between freshly isolated peritoneal epithelial cells of normal and ohss rats by the isc measurement  <cit> . to exclude a possible contribution of na+ absorption to the current, we used amiloride, an epithelial sodium channel blocker. the results revealed that the forskolin-induced isc from the peritoneal epithelial cells of ohss rats was substantially increased compared with that of untreated controls at the diestrous or estrous stage of the sexual cycle . the camp-dependent isc could be blocked by a specific cftr inhibitor- <dig> , which has been demonstrated to inhibit cftr-mediated, cholera toxin-induced fluid secretion  <cit> . it confirmed that the observed camp-activated isc reflects cftr channel activity. the effect of exogenously administrated estrogen and progesterone for  <dig> d on peritoneal cftr channel activity was also examined. isc measurements showed that forskolin-induced or cftr-mediated isc in estrogen-treated peritoneum was significantly higher than that of progesterone-treated . progesterone suppressed estrogen induced cftr-mediated isc in peritoneum . taken together, it appears that up regulation of cftr and aqp <dig> due to elevated estrogen may be responsible for the excessive fluid transport and accumulation in ohss. therefore, it may be possible to alleviate ohss symptoms through suppressing cftr or aqp <dig> expression or through suppressing cftr or aqp <dig> function. to validate this hypothesis, we first used progesterone, as it was shown to suppress cftr expression in previous studies  <cit>  and in the present study as well. indeed, progesterone treatment of ohss rats also eliminated peritoneal and pleural fluid accumulation and significantly reduced cftr and aqp <dig> protein expression . the progesterone selective progesterone antagonist, mifepristone, was found to suppress the action of progesterone . interestingly, progesterone has been used in a few clinical situations for luteal support during art, in which it was found to significantly lower the incidence of ohss in ivf cycles. however no explanation for such an effect was published  <cit> . in summary, progesterone may suppress the expression of cftr and aqp <dig> to alleviate the symptom of ohss.

to confirm the coactions of cftr and aqp <dig> in the pathogenesis of ohss, the camp-dependent isc was used to measure cftr channel activity affected by aqp <dig>  the results showed that the camp-dependent isc could also be reduced by an aqp <dig> inhibitor, hgcl <dig> , which has been demonstrated to inhibit aqp1-mediated water transport  <cit> . this confirmed that aqp <dig> can affect cftr channel activity. furthermore, treatment of pmsg-/hcg-induced ohss rats injected with  <dig> μl cftr antiserum resulted in the elimination of the body wt increase about  <dig>  g, the peritoneal fluid accumulation about  <dig>  ml and the pleural fluid accumulation about  <dig>  ml. injection of  <dig> μl aqp <dig> antiserum resulted in the elimination of the body wt increase about  <dig>  g, the peritoneal fluid accumulation about  <dig>  ml and the pleural fluid accumulation about  <dig>  ml . the ability to alleviate ohss symptoms through interfering with cftr or aqp <dig> function confirmed a critical role of the coactions of cftr and aqp <dig> in ohss pathogenesis. it also suggested that these treatments may be a preventive measure for ohss during art.

in this study, we demonstrated that up regulation of both cftr and aqp <dig> by either excessive estrogen or ovarian hyper stimulation leads to the development of ohss symptoms in rodents. considering the observed high levels of estrogen, exceeding normal physiological levels, in patients undergoing ovarian hyper stimulation  <cit>  and regulation of cftr and aqp <dig> expression by ovarian hormones in humans  <cit> , the present findings in ohss rodent models are of strong clinical relevance, suggesting the coactions of cftr and aqp <dig> in the pathogenesis of ohss. ohss appears to be the result of abnormally up regulating cftr as well as aqp <dig>  this leads to excessive fluid shift and accumulation in the peritoneal cavity and pleural cavity, which can be life threatening. it is because that fluid transport throughout the body due to water effusion following ion transportation.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, this study confirms the coactions of cftr and aqp <dig> in regulating body electrolyte and fluid secretion. an abnormality in either expression or function, could result in lethal conditions, as seen in ohss.
