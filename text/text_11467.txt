BACKGROUND
ethylene is a gaseous phytohormone involved in regulating processes of horticultural importance encompassing flower development, fruit ripening, abscission and leaf and flower senescence  <cit> . in the ethylene signal transduction pathway, ethylene perception is facilitated via a copper co-factor present in receptor proteins integrated in the endoplasmic reticulum   <cit> . in arabidopsis, receptor proteins comprising ethylene response  <dig>  and ethylene response sensor  <dig>  or etr <dig>  ers <dig> and ethylene insensitive  <dig>  have been characterised. they differ by the functionality of their kinase domains . ethylene receptors exist as dimers and physically interact with the negative regulator constitutive triple response  <dig>   <cit> . the kinase activity of ctr <dig> is directed towards the c-terminal of ethylene insensitive  <dig> , a positive regulator of the ethylene response . ethylene binding to receptors deactivates ctr <dig> and results in a dephosphorylation of ein <dig>  <cit> . subsequently, the c-terminal of ein <dig> is cleaved and translocated from er to the nucleus  <cit>  where ethylene insensitive 3/ethylene insensitive 3-like -dependent transcription and activation of the ethylene response occur .

postharvest quality of many ornamental plants is sensitive to ethylene during production and distribution  <cit> . in climacteric plants, flower development is controlled by intrinsic rise in ethylene production and respiration which promotes flower development and senescence. plant species with climacteric flower senescence are sensitive to exogenous ethylene and may exhibit accelerated petal or flower wilting upon exposure. commercially important climacteric ornamental plants include carnations, orchids, kalanchöe, campanula and roses . endogenous ethylene production may arise due to natural floral development but also in response to stress, elevated co <dig> production  <cit>  or increased auxin production  <cit> . hence, ornamental plants are often treated with chemical inhibitors blocking ethylene signaling to improve postharvest quality and prolong flower longevity  <cit> .

genetic approaches designed to reduce ethylene sensitivity in flowers have modified signaling via the ethylene signal transduction pathway. the etr1- <dig> ethylene receptor mutant from arabidopsis fails to bind ethylene  <cit> . expression of etr1- <dig> in petunia and campanula carpatica flowers  results in ethylene insensitivity, delayed senescence and postponed flower abscission. also, transgenic petunia expressing reduced levels of phein <dig> displayed delayed flower senescence  <cit> . however, to date genetic approaches successfully prolonging flower longevity have resulted in transgenic plants  <cit> .

campanula is an economically important ornamental plant, used as indoor potted plant, garden plant, as well as cut flower. the campanula genus consists of approximately  <dig> species  <cit> . here, we characterise expression patterns of flower expressed ers, ctr and eil genes in response to floral development and exogenous ethylene in three ornamental species of campanula; c. portenschlagiana , c. formanekiana  and c. medium . the ethylene insensitivity identified in flowers of c. medium correlates with the occurrence of a natural mutation in the open reading frame of eil <dig>  this finding holds promise for new breeding strategies towards ethylene insensitive ornamental plants.

RESULTS
campanula sensitivity to ethylene
to understand the physiological variation in ethylene sensitivity among campanula species, we used ethylene exposure tests in a postharvest environment. c. portenschlagiana, c. formanekiana and c. medium were selected due to their relevance as ornamental plants. cp was found to be sensitive to ethylene from concentrations of  <dig>  μl · l− <dig>  individual flower sensitivity increased with flower age. in cp, old flowers did not survive  <dig>  μl · l− <dig> ethylene treatment for 48 h whereas young flowers maintained longevity in a  <dig>  μl · l− <dig> ethylene environment for more than 48 h. cp flowers, regardless of age, did not survive after 72 h of the high ethylene treatment . less pronounced ethylene sensitivity was found in cf where 26 % of old flowers wilted in response to 72 h of  <dig>  μl · l− <dig> ethylene as opposed to 100 % of old cp flowers. increased ethylene concentration for the same period resulted in complete senescence of 4-day old cf flowers . as in cp, young cf flowers were less ethylene sensitive than old flowers, however, 93 % of young flowers wilted in response to  <dig>  μl · l− <dig> ethylene . thus, flowers of neither cp nor cf could tolerate 72 h of  <dig>  μl · l− <dig> ethylene, regardless of flower age. in contrast, cm flowers were non-responsive to ethylene, they maintained both colour and turgor for 72 h in the  <dig>  μl · l− <dig> ethylene environment .fig.  <dig> floral development in response to ethylene exposure in campanula. visual presentation of flower responses to ethylene concentrations of  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig>  μl · l− <dig> ethylene for 72 h a

identification of key genes in ethylene signal transduction
degenerate primers were used to identify expressed components in the ethylene signal transduction pathway in campanula flowers. this allowed identification of partial homologs for ers <dig>  ctr <dig> and eil. campanula transcript fragments of ers <dig> and ctr <dig> were translated to protein and named according to their closest relative in arabidopsis  whereas campanula ein3/eil homologs were named eil <dig> and eil <dig>  protein alignment of campanula ers <dig> showed high similarity within species in the identified region whereas campanula ctr <dig> proteins differed . in cf and cm, ers <dig> was encoded by a single gene whereas cp ers <dig> was represented by two loci containing different introns but resulting in identical partial transcripts . sequencing showed some polymorphisms among the partial ctr <dig> transcripts. these could not be separated in rt-pcr reactions and may represent different alleles in the same locus.

also eil transcripts were identified by degenerate primers using flower cdna as template. sequencing identified two partial eil <dig> homologs eil1a and eil1b in cp and only one partial eil <dig> homolog in cf and cm. in cf the cdna pool contained an additional eil homolog, eil <dig>  however this transcript was not readily detectable in cm cdna using the degenerate primers. as cf and cm have different sensitivities towards ethylene , primers were designed to separate and amplify both eil <dig> and eil <dig> fragments from cf and cm genomic dna. interestingly, cmeil <dig> was found to contain a deletion of 7 bp in the eil <dig> orf resulting in a frame shift in the corresponding protein . the 7 bp deletion in cmeil <dig> was verified from independent gdna extractions . at the nucleotide level cfeil <dig> and cmeil <dig> shared 96 % identity to each other and 76 % identity to cfeil <dig> and cmeil <dig> respectively . pcr reactions specific for eil <dig> using cp gdna or cdna did not amplify a product.fig.  <dig> alignment of eil <dig> gdna from campanula. the 65 bp fragments of eil <dig> gdna span the region where c. medium  contains a 7 bp deletion and c. formanekiana  does not. as a reference the closest ortholog atein <dig> from arabidopsis thaliana is included . the position of the deletion in cmeil <dig> is underlined. the alignment was produced in clustal Ω  <cit>

expression analysis of putative ers <dig>  ctr <dig>  eil <dig> and eil <dig> homologues
to address the transcriptional regulation of the ethylene signal transduction pathway in campanula, flower tissues were harvested at five developmental stages . transcripts of putative ers <dig>  ctr <dig> and eil <dig> were expressed constitutively during flower development . to determine whether campanula ers <dig>  ctr <dig> or eil <dig> were responsive to ethylene, transcriptional analysis were performed in young  flowers exposed to  <dig>  μl · l− <dig> or  <dig>  μl · l− <dig> ethylene for 24 h. however, neither ers <dig>  ctr <dig> nor eil <dig> transcripts were responsive to the applied ethylene treatments .fig.  <dig> developmental stages of campanula flowers. developmental stages are unripe bud , day  <dig>  and  <dig>   <dig> and 4-day old flowers of a

expression patterns of cfeil <dig> and cmeil <dig> transcripts were analyzed by classic rt-pcr and rt-qpcr. cfeil <dig> transcripts showed expression pattern and levels similar to those of cfeil <dig> throughout flower development and in response to  <dig>  μl · l− <dig> and  <dig>  μl · l− <dig> ethylene for 24 h . in contrast, cmeil <dig> was detectable in trace amounts when analysed by rt-pcr. quantitative analysis by rt-qpcr showed consistently very low levels of cmeil <dig> through flower development and no transcriptional response to ethylene. expression levels of cfeil <dig> and cmeil <dig> differed by more than 100-fold in young flowers  whereas the same comparison in old flowers  yielded only 40-fold changes. the variation in fold change was primarily due to non-significant increases in cmeil <dig> transcript levels. expression levels of cfeil <dig> and cmeil <dig> in response to ethylene were not found to be significantly different due to the large variation in cfeil <dig> expression levels .fig.  <dig> expression of eil <dig> in large flowered campanula during flower development and following ethylene exposure. campanula species are c. formanekiana  and c. medium . in a, c the floral developmental stages were; day before opening , 1-day old flower , 2-days old flower  and 4-days old flower . in b, d ethylene was supplied to sealed glass tanks at the following concentrations;  <dig>  μl · l− <dig> ,  <dig>  μl · l− <dig>  and  <dig>  μl · l− <dig>  ethylene. results from rt-qpcr are presented as relative expressions in  and . the corresponding results of eil <dig> rt-pcr loaded on agarose gels are presented in  and . the values of 1-day flowers and 0 μl · l− <dig> ethylene were set to the value  <dig> in  and , respectively. as reference gene actin  from campanula was used, these rt-pcr results are presented in figs. 4a and 5a. rt-qpcr data were normalized to transcripts of the same act. data are means ± se. values with same letters are not significantly different 



the eil <dig> frameshift mutation is unique for c. medium
alignment of the putative eil <dig> protein fragment from campanula with eil protein sequences from other plants confirmed the presence of three conserved domains found in other eils. these domains comprise the two basic amino acids binding domains  and the proline-rich region  . at the protein level the putative eils from campanula were closely related to each other when compared to other eils except for cmeil <dig>  cmeil <dig> showed high homology to other eils until the position of the frameshift. the sequence following downstream of the frameshift was only observed in cm and did not show any homology to previously reported eil proteins. omission of the deletion from the cmeil <dig> reading frame resulted in a protein that perfectly aligned with other eil <dig> proteins . phylogenetic analysis using other plant eils indicated a close relation among campanula eils and a clear phylogenetic separation of campanula eil <dig> and eil <dig> proteins . some branch points in the phylogenetic analysis yielded low bootstrap values due to the size of the aligned fragment  and the high identity among all the eils .fig.  <dig> alignment of partial sequences from translated campanula eil proteins spanning  <dig> amino acids. conserved domains previously described in ein/eil proteins are boxed, these are the basic domains  and the proline-rich domain . the conserved salm motif in which cmeil <dig> is mutated is marked with . conserved aa among all ein/eils are marked below with an asterisk. cmeil <dig> is presented in bold. the alignment were produced from partial ein/eil protein sequences of c. portenschlagiana , c. formanekiana , c. medium , actinidia deliciosa , arabidopsis thaliana , cucumis sativus , nicotiana tabacum , solanum lycopersicum  and vitis vinifera . previously named proteins are presented by their species abbreviation followed by their name. the alignment was produced in clustal Ω  <cit>

characterization of eil <dig> in campanula species and cultivars
to elucidate the natural occurrence of eil <dig> in campanula, close relatives to c. medium were identified as c. hofmannii, c. alpina, c. alpestris and edraianthus graminifolius and c. incurva as close relative to c. formanekiana  <cit> . as the cmeil <dig> mutation disrupts an nlaiii restriction site in eil <dig> a simple screen for the presence of the mutation was developed . eil <dig> pcr products digested with nlaiii resulted in either two or three dna fragments depending on the presence or lack of the eil <dig> mutation, respectively. results obtained via nlaiii digests were verified by sequencing. interestingly, eil <dig> was found to be specific for cm and did not occur in related campanula species . intraspecific nlaiii restriction analysis among cm cultivars confirmed the occurrence of eil <dig> regardless of cultivar origin . thus the reported frameshift mutation in cmeil <dig> is specific for cm and occurs in all tested cm both among non domesticated and domesticated cultivars.fig.  <dig> alignment of genomic eil <dig> dna sequences. the aligned area presented is centered on the seven bp deletion in c. medium . nucleotides bordering the mutation are boxed. conserved nucleotides are marked with asterisk. a

characterization of eil <dig> in hybrids of cf × cm
as cm is homozygote for eil <dig> whereas cf is homozygote for eil <dig> the performance of eil <dig> in heterozygote plants were evaluated by ethylene exposure tests in c. formanekiana × c. medium hybrids. the presence of eil <dig> in cf × cm hybrids  was verified using the nlaiii screening system . young flowers were exposed to high ethylene concentrations of  <dig>  μl · l− <dig> for 72 h and flower responses were scored in categories of no response, signs of senescence and complete senescence . interestingly, four heterozygote cf × cm hybrids showed phenotypes indistinguishable from that of cf with 87–100 % of flowers showing complete senescence in response to ethylene. a single hybrid  exhibited an intermediate phenotype with 57 % senesced flowers. in contrast, two cm breeding lines maintained flower longevity longer and only 0–5 % of flowers senesced as a result of 72 h of  <dig>  μl · l− <dig> ethylene exposure.fig.  <dig> detection of eil <dig> in hybrids of c. formanekiana  and c. medium . the original pcr products  are 499 bp or 492 bp in cf and cm, respectively. upon digestion with the restriction enzyme nlaiii cfeil <dig> produces dna fragments of 362 bp, 122 bp and 16 bp . in contrast cm containing the 7 bp deletion in eil <dig> produces dna fragments of 476 bp and 16 bp . the 16 bp dna fragments are not detected. nlaiii restriction analysis of  <dig> heterozygote cf × cm hybrids shows that all hybrids contain both cf and cm specific dna fragments . hybrids were produced according to  <cit>

discussion
ethylene sensitivity in campanula
ethylene sensitivity of flowers is a recurring problem affecting breeders, producers and costumers of ornamental plants  <cit> . thus characterisation of physiological and molecular variations in economically important campanula species are much needed. in the present study, ethylene sensitivity among c. portenschlagiana, c. formanekiana and c. medium were found to depend on physiological and genetic factors. ethylene sensitivity in flowers were dependent on genotype as cp was highly sensitive, cf had an intermediate level of sensitivity and cm was found to be insensitive to high concentrations of ethylene . labelling of flower developmental stage showed a link between flower age and ethylene sensitivity, where a higher proportion of flowers senesced among the older flowers. only old flowers of cp were sensitive to low amounts of  <dig>  μl · l− <dig> ethylene, whereas all flowers of cp were sensitive to  <dig>  μl · l− <dig> ethylene. doubling the ethylene concentration resulted insignificant increase in senesced cf flowers from  <dig> to 100 % and also in complete loss of flower longevity in young cf flowers . in the same experimental settings all flowers of cm were insensitive to ethylene. a similar correlation between flower age and ethylene sensitivity has been observed in pelargonium peltatum  <cit> . this age dependent increase in sensitivity may also be connected to pollination as some plant species induce flower senescence upon pollination .

whereas cf flowers are ethylene sensitive in a concentration dependent manner  not even a 50-fold increase in ethylene concentration reduced flower longevity in cm. this indicates that ethylene insensitivity of cm is independent of ethylene concentrations .

constitutive expression of ers <dig> and ctr <dig> in flowers
expression of ers <dig> was found to be constitutive in campanula during floral development and transcripts in young flowers were also unresponsive to low concentrations of ethylene . in both arabidopsis and roses ethylene receptors are encoded by five genes , some of which exhibit differential expression in response to exogenous ethylene and are regulated during flower development tissues  <cit> . also, exogenously applied ethylene does not affect levels of dianthus caryophyllus ers <dig> in petals but this gene is regulated by flower development  <cit> . collectively, results obtained in other plants indicate that ethylene receptor families comprise multiple members. the genome of cp was found to contain two homologs of ers receptors whereas only one gene/transcript was identified in cf and cm. as gdna was also used as template in the cloning reactions mrna levels in flower tissues should not be the determining factor. thus all three campanula species likely encode additional ethylene receptors which were not identified here due to primer specificities.

similarly as for ers <dig>  all campanula ctr <dig> transcripts were constitutively expressed during flower development and did not respond to application of exogenous ethylene . the same pattern was observed in roses where rhctr <dig> and rhctr <dig> were constitutively expressed throughout flower development; however both rhctr transcript levels increased in response to ethylene  <cit> . in some plant species the genomic structure of ctr <dig> is highly complex. banana and tomato ctr <dig> exist in a  <dig> exon  <dig> intron structure yielding complete orfs of  <dig>  and 12 kb, respectively  <cit> . even with a long elongation time in pcr reactions we were not able to identify the full-length sequence of campanula ctr <dig>  however small polymorphisms detected in the partial cp, cf and cm ctr <dig> transcripts indicate that these plants may be heterozygote in the ctr <dig> locus or that an additional copy of ctr <dig> exists. two and four ctr homologs have been identified in roses and tomato, respectively  <cit> . hence an additional ctr <dig> in campanula is not unlikely.

occurrence and expression of eils in campanula
the ein3/eil family encodes transcription factors mediating the initialization of the physiological ethylene response  <cit> . in the three campanula species investigated here approximately 600 bp of a flower expressed eil homologue were identified, eil <dig>  all eil <dig> transcripts were consistently expressed through flower development and did not respond to applied ethylene . in the small flowered cp two close homologs of eil <dig> were identified by sequencing as eil1a and eil1b, however the two could not be separated during expression analysis. in contrast, the two large flowered campanula  both contained the orf of eil <dig>  a gene not detected in cp. cfeil <dig> gene expression was like cfeil <dig> constitutive throughout flower development and nonresponsive to exogenous ethylene . in cm, eil <dig> was not expressed due to the deletion of 7 bp in the orf . translational analysis of the partial cmeil <dig> protein indicated that the 7 bp deletion would introduce a frameshift prior to what should have been the proline rich domain in cmeil <dig> . on nucleotide level cfeil <dig> and cmeil <dig> share 96 % identity , showing that they are close homologs. the close homology among cfeil <dig> and cmeil <dig> was supported by phylogenetic analysis . translation of the putative cmeil <dig> indicate that the frameshift mutation in eil <dig> disrupts the putative major dna binding domain in eil <dig> in front of the proline rich region and simultaneously introduces a stop codon  <dig> amino acids further downstream in the eil <dig> protein sequence. hence, if translated the protein would be truncated to approximately 40 % of the expected size when compared to atein <dig> . the position and functionality of eil dna binding domains have been characterised in arabidopsis eil <dig> and in cucumber ein <dig>  <cit> .

whether the promoters of cfeil <dig> and cmeil <dig> share the same specificity remains to be shown, however cmeil <dig> may have been expressed in flowers at one point as traces of the transcript was observed in rt-pcr and in rt-qpcr . finally, additional eil homologs may be present in campanula as 4– <dig> homologs have been identified in arabidopsis, tomato and tobacco .

previous studies of ein3/eil homologs have shown constitutive expression in paeonia, however in dianthus caryopyllus dceil1/ <dig> and dceil <dig> transcripts in petals and styles increased rapidly after ethylene treatment of flowers and then gradually declined  <cit> . the constitutive expressions of ers <dig>  ctr <dig> and eils in the ethylene signal transduction pathway in campanula indicate that flowers are capable of a fast physiological response in the presence of ethylene. this correlate well with earlier results where campanula has been described as an ethylene sensitive species  <cit> . furthermore, the lack of transcriptional response to ethylene exposure could be a combination of regulatory steps on the protein level  <cit> .

the cmeil <dig> phenotype was inherited as a recessive trait
in the present study, the eil <dig> frameshift mutation was identified not only in danish domesticated cm but also in non domesticated specimens of cm and in the closely related c. medium var. calycanthema . this suggests that the eil <dig> frameshift must have occurred in an earlier ancestor of cm. none of the closely related campanula species c. alpina, c. alpestris, c. hofmannii or e. graminifolius contained eil <dig> . in hybrids of cf × cm, heterozygote eil <dig> resulted in very similar ethylene responses as observed in cf as only one of five hybrids showed an intermediate phenotype shifted towards increased ethylene insensitivity when compared to cf . this indicated that the eil <dig> phenotype was restored by the presence of a wild type eil <dig> and was inherited as a recessive trait. homozygote eil <dig> in cf could not be obtained via crossings as both male and female parts of cf × cm hybrids were sterile. results obtained here are the first to describe the effects of an ein3/eil mutation in flowers. also, no reports exist of approaches where ein3/eil genes have been knocked out or silenced via gene modification. therefore the eil <dig> phenotype described in cm cannot be directly compared to related phenotypes in flowers of other plant species. in arabidopsis, the closest homolog to campanula eil <dig> is ein <dig> . in arabidopsis, ein <dig> mutants are well characterised and they too are inherited in a recessive manner  <cit> . also phenotypes in ein <dig> or eil mutants in arabidopsis are only described in seedlings or mature rosettes. to our knowledge ethylene sensitivity and floral development has not been described in arabidopsis ein <dig> or eil mutants. however, in support of our results are data from tomato where expression of leeil <dig>  leeil <dig> or leeil <dig> antisense transcripts results in ethylene insensitive buds  <cit> . collectively, this study is the first to correlate ethylene insensitivity in flowers to an ein/eil mutant phenotype.

future approaches to achieve ethylene insensitive plants
previous studies have indicated that there may be specific functions for the individual eils. thus to alter the physiological response of flowers to ethylene, the right ortholog in each plant species has to be identified. in the framework of this study, the cmeil <dig> frameshift mutation could potentially be transferred to eil <dig> homologs of related species by conventional crossing or the deletion could be introduced by wide hybridisation among related species, assisted by embryo rescue techniques when necessary  <cit> .

the frameshift in cmeil <dig> is positioned in a highly conserved region, and it therefore holds potential for molecular breeding towards ethylene insensitive plants. however, the identification of the full genomic sequence in cm and cf and the full sequence of the translated gene product in cf are essential steps in this process. ultimately, we propose that the identified 7 bp deletion in cmeil <dig> may be used to confer ethylene insensitivity to other plant species. this may be feasible via targeted mutagenesis techniques utilizing znf, talens  <cit>  or crispr/cas <dig>  <cit> . as a result, ethylene insensitivity may be transferred from cm to other important climacteric ornamentals e.g., roses, petunia, carnations, or even to edible climacteric crops such as broccoli and tomato.

CONCLUSIONS
we characterised the physiological and molecular responses among three campanula species to exogenous ethylene. key genes in the ethylene signal transduction pathway ers, ctr and eil <dig> were found to be constitutively expressed in campanula and unresponsive to exogenous ethylene. however, eil <dig> was found to be specific for the large flowered species c. formanekiana and c. medium, but was not expressed in cm due to a  <dig> nucleotide frameshift in the coding region of cmeil <dig>  the natural mutation identified here in cmeil <dig> correlates with the observed ethylene insensitivity in this species. this finding holds great potential for future breeding strategies towards ethylene insensitive plants.
