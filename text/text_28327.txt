BACKGROUND
dendritic spines are the locus of the majority of excitatory synapses on hippocampal and cortical pyramidal neurons. an abundance of research in the field of synaptic plasticity has demonstrated that dendritic spines display morphological plasticity in response to a myriad of extracellular stimuli  <cit> . these changes are thought to be cellular correlates of the plasticity seen in learning and memory  <cit> . importantly, spines have repeatedly been shown to increase in both size and number following the induction of long-term potentiation   <cit>  and to decrease in size and number following induction of long-term depression   <cit> . the ability of dendritic spines to remain labile/plastic is dependent on rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton which forms the core of each spine  <cit> . this process is dependent on the activity of rho-gtpases, which are activated by rho-guanine nucleotide exchange factors   <cit> . about a dozen of the  <dig> rho-gefs encoded by the mouse genome are localized to the postsynaptic density   <cit> .

among the psd-localized rho-gefs is kalirin- <dig> , the predominant adult splice variant of the multiply spliced kalrn gene  <cit> . kal <dig> has been repeatedly shown to have a profound effect on dendritic spine density in vitro, with over-expression dramatically increasing spine density and knockdown decreasing spine density  <cit> . more recently, we developed a mouse that cannot produce kal <dig>  and demonstrated that this mouse had decreased hippocampal spine density at baseline, and was unable to increase dendritic spine density in medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens in response to repeated cocaine treatment  <cit> .

electrophysiologically, genetic deletion of kal <dig> resulted in a decrease in the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic potentials  with no change in sepsp amplitude, suggesting that expression of ampa receptors at existing synapses was normal, while synapse number was reduced  <cit> . a similar decrease in sepsp frequency was seen in cortical neurons in an animal unable to produce any of the full length kalirin isoforms due to deletion of exons in the first gef domain of kalirin   <cit> . interestingly, kal7ko mice exhibited a robust decrease in ltp in the hippocampus  <cit>  whereas kalgef1ko mice demonstrated a small but significant decrease in hippocampal field ltp  <cit> . recent biochemical studies revealed a direct interaction between kal <dig> and the nr2b subunit of the nmda receptor and nmda receptor-mediated transmission was shown to be significantly impaired in the cortex of kal7ko mice  <cit> .

in this series of experiments, we characterized basal synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus of kal7ko mice. we found that kal7ko mice exhibit normal ampa receptor-mediated basal transmission, profound deficits in nmda receptor-dependent ltp and ltd, and normal nmda receptor-independent plasticity. these studies shed light on the specific pathways that are affected by the presence or absence of kal <dig> at a synapse.

slice preparation
briefly, c57bl/ <dig>  or wt cd <dig> mice  were decapitated under isoflurane anesthesia and the brains were harvested quickly and placed into ice-cold "cutting and incubating"  solution composed of :  <dig> nacl,  <dig>  kcl, <dig>  nah2po <dig>   <dig> nahco <dig>   <dig>  cacl <dig>   <dig> mgcl <dig>   <dig> mgso <dig>   <dig> lactic acid,  <dig> pyruvic acid,  <dig> glucose, and  <dig>  ascorbic acid, carboxygenated with 95% o <dig> - 5% co <dig> . transverse slices  containing the hippocampus were cut using a vibratome . the slices were placed in a large incubating chamber containing ci solution at a temperature of  <dig> - 35°c for  <dig> minutes before being transferred to room temperature for at least  <dig> minutes prior to recording. slices were then individually transferred to a recording chamber fixed to the stage of an olympus bx50wi upright microscope. during recordings, slices were continuously perfused at  <dig> ml/min with artificial cerebrospinal fluid  consisting of   <dig> nacl,  <dig>  kcl,  <dig>  nah2po <dig>   <dig> nahco <dig>   <dig> cacl <dig>   <dig> mgcl <dig>  and  <dig> glucose ; ph was equilibrated by continuous bubbling with 95% o <dig> - 5% co <dig> 

electrophysiology
hippocampal field excitatory postsynaptic potentials  were recorded at room temperature from the stratum radiatum layer of ca <dig> using borosilicate glass microelectrodes  filled with acsf. a bipolar tungsten stimulating electrode  was placed in the schaffer collateral pathway approximately  <dig> μm lateral to the recording electrode. extracellular fepsps were evoked at  <dig>  hz with an intensity that evoked half maximal responses. slopes of fepsps were generated from linear regression of the rising phase  using pclamp <dig> . tests of statistical significance were based on student's t-tests or anova. group data are reported as mean ± standard error of the mean .

knockout animal generation/breeding/genotyping
kal7ko mice were generated as previously described by breeding kal7ko/+ males and females which had been backcrossed into c57bl/ <dig> more than  <dig> generations  <cit> ; dna prepared from ear-punches taken at weaning  was used to genotype pups  <cit> . littermate wildtype and kal7ko mice were used at ages p50-p <dig> for all extracellular field recordings, with the exception of the results shown in figure  <dig>  which used  <dig> week old cd <dig> mice.

RESULTS
kal7ko mice exhibit normal ampa receptor-mediated transmission
we characterized basal ampa receptor-mediated transmission at ca3-ca <dig> synapses in the hippocampus by generating input-output curves using evoked field potentials . to address potential differences in the excitability of the schaffer collateral axons, we first examined the relationship between stimulation intensity and presynaptic fiber volley amplitude. as shown in figure 1b, there was no genotypic difference in axonal excitability. to address potential differences in synaptic strength, we next examined the relationship between presynaptic fiber volley amplitude and either fepsp amplitude  or slope . there was no genotypic difference in basal synaptic strength of ampa-mediated transmission.

kal7ko mice exhibit deficits in nmda receptor-dependent plasticity
in addition to regulating spine number, kal <dig> interacts with other postsynaptic density proteins involved in synaptic function, and has been suggested to play a key role in activity-dependent plasticity  <cit> . indeed, in single-cell ltp experiments in the kal7ko hippocampus we observed a pronounced decrease in potentiation  <cit> . in the next series of studies we characterized the role of kal <dig> in hippocampal synaptic plasticity on a network level by performing hippocampal field recordings. specifically, we examined ltp at schaffer collateral-ca <dig> synapses in the hippocampus using trains of theta burst stimulation  as well as high frequency tetanic stimulation  in acute brain slices. as shown in the example sweeps in figure 2a and group time courses in figure 2b, wt mice, but not kal7ko littermates, showed marked potentiation following three trains of tbs. group data in figure 2c revealed that significant ltp could be induced in wt animals with either  <dig> or  <dig> tbs trains or with hfs, whereas kal7ko mice showed no ltp with  <dig> tbs or hfs, and a small but statistically significant ltp with  <dig> tbs that was significantly decreased compared to wt animals.

to confirm that the ltp produced by these paradigms was dependent on nmda receptor activation, we performed the same stimulation paradigms in the presence of  <dig> μm of the nmda receptor antagonist 3-. both tbs and hfs-induced ltp were dependent on nmda receptor activation, as no significant ltp was induced using either paradigm when nmda receptors were blocked . we also examined the contribution of nr2b-containing receptors, as we have recently reported a deficit in nr2b-mediated signaling in kal7ko mice  <cit> . as shown in figure 2d, blocking nr2b-containing receptors with ifenprodil  completely prevented tbs-induced ltp in wt animals.

to determine whether the disruption of synaptic plasticity was specific to protocols that enhance synaptic transmission, we also examined the effects of kal <dig> deletion on long term depression  at these same hippocampal synapses. initial studies used a standard low frequency stimulation protocol  commonly used for rat slice recordings, however we found no significant ltd in adult mice of either genotype using this protocol. other studies have also reported that low frequency stimulation, which induces ltd in younger animals, is often ineffective in producing ltd in adult rats  <cit> . we therefore employed a modified induction protocol using paired-pulse low frequency stimulation , which has previously been shown to be effective in inducing ltd in older rats  <cit> . as shown in the example traces in figure 3a and group data in figures 3b&3c, slices from wt mice showed significant ltd in response to pp-lfs . in contrast, slices from kal7ko mice showed no significant change after ltd induction .

kal7ko mice exhibit normal nmda receptor-independent ltp
because loss of kal <dig> disrupted nmda receptor-dependent ltp as well as ltd, we next examined whether this plasticity deficit extended to nmda receptor-independent forms of plasticity at these same hippocampal ca3-ca <dig> synapses. to address this issue, we utilized a protocol that has been shown to induce a slowly developing and long-lasting form of potentiation that depends on calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels rather than through nmda receptor channels  <cit> . in response to high frequency tetanic stimulation  in the presence of the nmda receptor antagonist cpp , a transient depression was followed by a significant potentiation in wt animals measured  <dig> min after the induction protocol; individual sweeps and time courses are shown in figures 4a &4b. time courses across individual experiments were quite variable; nevertheless, as shown in the group data in figure 4c, significant ltp was seen in both wt  and kal7ko animals  at  <dig> min post-induction. the amount of potentiation was not significantly different between genotypes. thus, kal <dig> is not required for this form of nmda receptor-independent ltp.

kalirin gef activity is essential for nmda-dependent ltp and ltd
kal <dig> is a large, multifunctional protein known to interact with multiple proteins localized to the psd  <cit> ; its ability to activate the rho-gtpase rac <dig> is essential for some, but not all of its effects  <cit> . to explore whether kal7-rac <dig> interactions are important for the expression of hippocampal ltp, we used 1--1h-pyrrol-  <dig> -dione , an inhibitor specific for the first gef domain of kalirin and trio  <cit> . as shown in figure 5a, nppd  had no significant effect on the input-output curve in wt mice. as shown in the example traces in figure 5b and the group time courses in figure 5c, in response to  <dig> trains of tbs, significant ltp was observed in control experiments , but not in nppd-treated slices , in addition to blocking ltp, nppd also prevented ltd  . since kal7ko mice failed to show ltp or ltd using these paradigms, these experiments were performed only on wt animals.

discussion
previous studies of kal7ko mice revealed a decrease in ca <dig> hippocampal dendritic spine density, focal behavioral impairments in hippocampal-dependent tasks  <cit> , and deficits in nmda receptor-mediated signaling  <cit> . in the current studies, we examined hippocampal synaptic transmission and plasticity via a series of extracellular field potential recording experiments on the kal7ko mice and their wt littermates in order to better understand the network changes that have taken place in these animals and how they may contribute to the behavioral phenotypes.

field potential input-output curves indicate that the kal7ko animals have normal axonal excitability and basal ampa receptor-mediated transmission compared to wt littermates . we previously reported a decrease in sepsp frequency and spine density in kal7ko mice compared to wt animals  <cit> . these changes could result from either a reduction in the number of synaptic contacts per axon, which would affect the input-output relationship, or a reduction in the number of axons, which would not affect the input-output curve, since it is normalized to the size of the presynaptic fiber volley. our data suggest that there is a decrease in the number of axons in kal7ko animals. it is also possible that the fepsp is not sensitive to relatively small changes in synapse density.

given the changes seen in nmda receptor function recently reported in kal7ko mice  <cit>  and the difference in ltp at the single cell level  <cit> , we next chose to examine nmda receptor-dependent forms of plasticity at the network level. in kal7ko mice, hippocampal ltp in response to  <dig> or  <dig> trains of tbs at ca3-ca <dig> synapses was significantly impaired . significant potentiation was also observed in wt animals using a hfs paradigm, which failed to induce ltp in kal7ko mice. potentiation in response to either tbs or hfs was nmda receptor-dependent, although stimulation in the theta frequency is a paradigm that is more relevant to the physiological range of synaptic activity  <cit> . we also found that low frequency stimulation-induced ltd, which requires activation of synaptic nmda receptors  <cit> , was likewise disrupted in kal7ko animals . in contrast, no genotypic deficit was seen in a non-nmda receptor mediated form of ltp at these same synapses . these results suggest that kal <dig> plays a critical and selective role in multiple forms of nmda receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity.

we have previously reported that expression of the nr2b subunit of the nmda receptor is decreased in psds purified from the hippocampus of kal7ko mice  <cit> . in addition, we found that signaling mediated by nr2b subunit-containing nmda receptors is impaired in kal7ko animals, as shown by a decrease in the nmda/ampa ratio and a decreased sensitivity to the nr2b antagonist ifenprodil  <cit> . thus, there may be a direct link between elimination of kal <dig> and nr2b deficiency. the role of nr2b in the development of ltp and ltd has long been controversial  <cit> . however, recent studies have demonstrated that the presence of nr2b and its binding partners at the synapse is essential for induction of ltp in the hippocampus  <cit> , and we found in the present studies that tbs-induced ltp required nr2b-containing receptors. additionally, behavioral experiments have demonstrated that specific blockade of nr2b receptors prevents fear learning and conditioned place preference for drugs  <cit> . interestingly, kal7ko mice exhibit specific deficits in both contextual fear conditioning and conditioned place preference for cocaine  <cit> . future studies will explore the specific role of the nr2b subunit in the plasticity and behavioral deficits seen after kal <dig> deletion.

alternative splicing generates multiple kalirin proteins from the kalrn gene  <cit> . mice engineered to lack exons encoding the first gef domain of kalirin  lack kal <dig> as well as the larger isoforms, kal <dig> and kal <dig>  <cit> . kalgef1ko mice show normal basal ampa-mediated transmission in the hippocampus  <cit> , as documented here for the kal7ko mice . multiple trains of high frequency tetanic stimulation were used to analyze hippocampal ltp in wt and kalgef1ko mice, and a small decrease in potentiation was noted in the ko animals at  <dig> and  <dig> minutes after ltp induction  <cit> . however, this supra-physiological high frequency tetanic stimulation was the only induction paradigm attempted in the kalgef1ko mice. in the present study using kal7ko animals, we report a small but significant deficit in tetanus-induced ltp, and no deficit in a non-nmda receptor mediated form of tetanus-induced ltp . this is in stark contrast to the profound deficits seen with tbs induction of ltp. as tbs more accurately reflects activity patterns observed in vivo, these results suggest that kal <dig> plays an important role in physiologically-relevant plasticity paradigms.

activation of rac <dig> and actin remodeling are critical for the clustering of ampa receptors and changes in dendritic spine morphology that occur following ltp induction  <cit> . however, there are numerous rac <dig> gefs at the psd and any of these could be affecting these changes  <cit> . in order to examine more specifically the rac gef activity of kal <dig>  we chose to use nppd, which inhibits the n-terminal gef <dig> domain of kalirin  and its ortholog trio, but does not affect the catalytic activity of other gef proteins tested  <cit> . previous studies from our lab have shown that nppd is effective at inhibiting the first gef domain of kalirin in pituitary cells  <cit> . ltp and ltd induction were fully blocked in the presence of nppd, while basal transmission was unaltered. although there are other rac gefs at the psd, kal <dig> clearly plays an important and non-redundant role in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. this may help to explain the learning related behavioral changes seen in kal7ko mice that are theoretically dependent on development of hippocampal ltp  <cit> .

it is intriguing to speculate on the potential relationship between deficits in nmda receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity with preservation of non-nmda receptor-mediated forms of synaptic plasticity on the one hand, and the behavioral tests that are either impaired or preserved. interestingly, kal7ko mice show deficits in behavioral tests related to fear and anxiety , but perform normally on non-aversive tasks such as object recognition, radial arm maze and conditioned place preference for food  <cit> . future studies will extend these results to explore the specific roles of kal <dig> in other brain regions. for example, because kal <dig> is also highly expressed in the amygdala, it will be interesting to explore the potential role of kal <dig> in amygdala-dependent fear conditioning tasks, which have previously been shown to be impaired following deletion of kal <dig> or kalirin gef <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
kal <dig> is an essential and selective modulator of nmda receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus.
