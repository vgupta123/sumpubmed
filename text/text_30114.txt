BACKGROUND
the sterile alpha motif domain-containing  <dig>  gene is located in chromosome 7q <dig>  of the human genome, and is adjacent to its close paralogue, samd9-like , in a head-to-tail position
 <cit>  and separated by approximately 12 kb. the physiological functions of both samd <dig> and samd9l currently remain poorly understood, but the importance of human samd <dig> has been recently emphasized during the discovery of the genetic cause of a rare life-threatening human disease, normophosphatemic familiar tumoral calcinosis 
 <cit> . patients with nftc exhibited normal calcium and phosphate metabolism while developing calcified tumorous nodules at their extremities, accompanied by severe gingivitis. two independent founder genetic events leading to the deleterious mutations in samd <dig> are responsible for the autosomal recessive disease of nftc
 <cit> . interestingly, these patients and their kindred are from a culturally isolated ethical group, namely jewish-yemenite, suggesting a potential selection pressure associated with this population
 <cit> . in addition to nftc, misregulated human samd <dig> expression was also shown to be associated with aggressive fibromatosis, breast, and colon cancers
 <cit> .

human samd <dig> expression can be upregulated by tumor necrosis factor 
 <cit>  or by type i
 <cit>  and type ii interferons 
 <cit> , and it is classified as an interferon-stimulated gene . recently, an interferon regulatory factor  binding element was identified in the promoter region of the samd <dig> gene in humans
 <cit> , and overexpression of irf- <dig> can lead to elevated samd <dig> gene expression
 <cit> . all these observations suggest a key role of samd <dig> as a signalling hub in response to innate immune stimulations. most importantly, human samd <dig> also has very recently been shown to possess anti-viral properties in cultured cells
 <cit>  emphasizing its crucial role in host defence against viral pathogens.

on the other hand, the human samd9l gene was shown to exhibit lower expression levels in breast cancer tissue than in normal breast tissue from the same patient
 <cit> . it was also identified to be an inducible gene for type i ifns , and in activated human t cells the function of samd9l is correlated with its ifn-induced inhibitory effects on cell migration
 <cit> . the murine samd9l gene expression was also found to be upregulated by calcitonin
 <cit> , suggesting a potential involvement in calcium homeostasis as well.

lastly, the human samd <dig> and samd9l genes were both classified as myeloid tumor suppressors, as they are localized within a microdeletion cluster associated with myeloid disorders, such as juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia , acute myeloid leukemia , and myelodysplastic syndrome 
 <cit> . in another study investigating altered immune responses in patients with metastatic melanoma, both samd <dig> and samd9l expression were shown to be significantly reduced in t and b cell populations when compared with those from healthy control individuals
 <cit> . it has been suggested that since these two proteins exhibit considerable sequence similarity, they may function redundantly or in related pathways, but it should be noted that patients with nftc possess mutations only in samd <dig> and thus it is likely that the two proteins perform non-identical tasks in humans.

evolutionarily, the orthologous genes for both samd <dig> and samd9l are highly conserved in many mammalian genomes, such as rat, primates and rabbit, but not in chicken, frog and fish species, or insects
 <cit> . this suggests that the origin of these two related genes, possibly from an ancestral duplication event, occurred at some point after branching of the mammalian species. in addition, one intriguing fact is that the house mouse genome  has lost the samd <dig> gene while maintaining samd9l, after an evolutionary chromosome breakage event
 <cit> .

the absence of samd <dig> from the house mouse  genome led us to question if it was a unique event restricted to this taxon and stimulated the study of samd <dig> and samd9l evolution and divergence in different mammalian genomes. we have examined the evolutionary history and phylogeny of samd <dig> and samd9l, using all the available and complete mammalian genomic sequences of both genes in ncbi and ensembl databases, in order to obtain a broader understanding of the origin of these two genes. our deduced phylogenetic tree suggests that samd <dig> and samd9l indeed resulted from an ancestral gene duplication event that occurred after the divergence of marsupialia from placentalia. at the same time, we applied six different maximum likelihood  methods to test for potential positive selective pressures exerted at the gene level, and we also looked for evidence of positive selection at the deduced protein level. the analyses revealed that samd <dig> and samd9l, at both the genome and deduced protein sequence levels, were under the effects of what appears to be sustained positive selective pressures. our results suggest that these two proteins have been selected by long term environmental pressures, such as those exerted by pathogen responses that are under the control of innate immune regulators like the type i interferons.

RESULTS
samd <dig> and samd9l genes prevalence in mammals
all the available and complete mammalian samd <dig> and samd9l genes coding sequences in the ncbi and ensembl databases were collected, resulting in a total of fifteen samd <dig> and nineteen samd9l genomic sequences of different species indicated in table 
 <dig>  the species collected for samd <dig> genes fit into seven eutheria orders, commonly designated as placental mammals, while the taxa collected for samd9l genes fit into eight placental orders. the grey short-tailed opossum, a representative of the order didelphimorphia traditionally included in marsupialia , was the only marsupial genome to possess a complete samd9l sequence.

database id: aensembl; bncbi genbank.

besides the complete samd <dig> and samd9l coding sequences, several other non-complete samd <dig> and samd9l mammalian genes, including full length mrna-derived transcripts with many still-undetermined nucleotides  or partial gene sequences , have been already identified and annotated in ensembl database. however, these incomplete sequences were not used in the phylogenetic and selection analyses performed in this study. both the complete and the non-complete samd <dig> and samd9l genes annotated in ensembl are represented in figure 
 <dig>  allowing a broader view into this gene family distribution within the mammalian context.

special reference has to be made to two particular complete sequences that were included in our evolutionary analyses: the northern white-cheeked gibbon  samd <dig> and the domestic dog  samd9l. the northern white-cheeked gibbon has no samd <dig> gene currently annotated in ensembl. however, by comparing samd <dig> sequences of other primates to the gibbon genome in ensembl using blast analysis, we obtained a perfect match with a neighboring designated pseudogene of samd9l. despite this biotype classification, we could not exclude this samd <dig> sequence from being considered as a bona fide gibbon samd <dig> gene. regarding the domestic dog samd9l, this gene is present in ncbi and is annotated in ensembl, but in this latter database the sequence was missing seventy-four nucleotides when compared to the sequence in ncbi. thus, for the subsequent analyses we used only the sequence from ncbi. it should also be noted that, despite not being annotated in ensembl, an incomplete samd <dig> sequence for the domestic dog is available in ncbi. however, when the ncbi sequence  was analyzed by blast, it possessed  <dig> to 100% identity with a non-annotated region of chromosome  <dig>  since it is a non-complete nucleotide sequence, it was not used further for the study reported here.

when samd <dig> and samd9l were mapped in human chromosome  <dig>  orthologous counterparts of both genes were identified in the chimpanzee , dog  and rat , but in the house mouse  genome there was only a single genetic correspondence to the samd9l open reading frame in chromosome 6
 <cit> . from what is currently available in ensembl database, the absence of samd <dig> for the house mouse  is confirmed. we checked the other available rodents to confirm the presence or absence of samd <dig> in this specific lineage. in ensembl there is a single samd <dig> annotation for the thirteen-lined ground squirrel . in addition, what appear to be intact samd <dig> genes have been deposited in ncbi database for the brown rat , the chinese hamster  and the domestic guinea pig . on the other hand, like the house mouse , the ord’s kangaroo rat  does not have samd <dig> gene annotated in ensembl database.

complete mammalian samd <dig> and samd9l gene sequences: recombination and phylogenetic analyses
the complete nucleotide coding sequences from samd <dig> and samd9l were aligned together  and translated into deduced protein sequences . before further phylogenetic analyses, we used the software gard
 <cit>  to look for any evidence of recombination in the alignment. three breakpoints were identified, but only one was strongly supported by the kishino-hasegawa  test , which should result in the estimation of a phylogenetic tree for each segment. however, since the breakpoint was located on nucleotide  <dig>  the genomic segment to the right of the breakpoint was only composed of  <dig> nucleotides.

a maximum likelihood  tree was estimated for the smallest genetic segment , but the nodes were weakly supported by low bootstrap values. therefore, only the large segment with  <dig> nucleotides was used to reconstruct a ml phylogenetic tree under the gtr+i+g nucleotide substitution model. the resulting tree is represented in figure 
 <dig>  another ml phylogenetic tree was estimated, but without testing recombination, to compare differences in the tree topologies. the model used was again the gtr+i+g and resulted in a tree  with a similar overall topology to the gene segment containing  <dig> nucleotides.

in the estimated ml phylogenetic tree , samd <dig> and samd9l formed two well defined monophyletic groups, and within each clade we observed a concordant topology with the accepted evolutionary relationships of eutherian mammals
 <cit>  . interestingly, the marsupial grey short-tailed opossum  samd9l represented a highly divergent outgroup, even from the remaining samd9l species.

a gene duplication event after the split of marsupial and placental mammals originated samd9/samd9l gene family
it has been previously suggested that samd <dig> and its paralogous samd9l may have originated from a common ancestor by a gene duplication event
 <cit> . in our study, the ml tree  topology supports this view. however, the opossum  gene annotated as samd9l in ncbi database  does not cluster in the placental mammal samd9l group. in fact, the opossum sequence can be recognized as being in a basal position. two highly supported eutherian monophyletic clades in the ml tree, one corresponding to all samd <dig> genes and the other one to all samd9l genes, were observed. the most likely evolutionary scenario can be described as following: an ancestral gene is present before the separation of marsupial from placental mammals in the common ancestor that originated the extant samd9l gene in the marsupial opossum  and the ancestral gene of placental samd9/samd9l gene family. later, in placental mammals, this ancestral gene suffered an event of gene duplication resulting in the contemporary samd <dig> and samd9l genes.

the conservation of similar arrangement of genes in the same relative locations on the chromosomes of different species, denominated as shared synteny, can indicate the existence of a common ancestor. in ensembl, among the mammalian species where the presence of samd <dig> and/or samd9l has been annotated, shared synteny can be readily observed in chromosomes and ‘gene-scaffolds’. the consistent presence of the same common flanking genes  in different species supports the idea that samd <dig> and samd9l are located in highly conserved regions throughout placental mammals’ divergence and diversification .

inference of positive selection at samd <dig> and samd9l genes level
placental samd <dig> and samd9l deduced protein sequences were aligned independently  and ml trees were estimated for each gene . afterwards, we determined whether the samd <dig> and samd9l genes might have been subject to positive selection pressures by comparing paml codon-based nested models with and without positive selection using likelihood ratio tests 
 <cit> . both comparisons of m <dig>  versus m <dig>  and m <dig>  versus m <dig>  resulted in the rejection of the null hypothesis, strongly supporting the finding of positive selection for both samd <dig> and samd9l . we also used the parris
 <cit>  method to detect if a proportion of sites in each gene alignment evolved under positive selection after accounting for the potentially confounding effects of recombination and synonymous site variation. interestingly, only samd9l was found to be under selection when using this method .

***, highly significant.

six different methods were used to detect sites under selection for samd <dig> and samd9l . for paml software, we used m <dig> model to detect sites under selection for samd <dig> and samd9l phylogenetic trees, and the beb approach was used to identify codons with a posterior probability >90%. the other five applied methods to detect sites under positive selection are available in the datamonkey web server. in this study, we only considered a codon with evidence of selection when it was identified by at least three of the six used methods
 <cit>  . seventeen sites for samd <dig> and nineteen sites for samd9l were identified as candidates for sites under positive selection .

amino acid substitutions can be either conservative or radical, depending on whether they lead to a change in a certain physicochemical property
 <cit> . for the codons identified as being under selection, we investigated the alterations of charge and polarity between mammalian taxa. for samd <dig> all the detected codons  exhibited at least one physicochemical alteration across species and a maximum of five different combinations of properties were identified for codon  <dig>  primate species samd <dig> amino acid changes were quite conservative, since eleven codons exhibited the same amino acid. despite the low number of species available for artiodactyla and rodentia, we verified in each order a great number of amino acid physicochemical alterations per codon in the samd <dig> genes. in addition, all samd9l codons under presumptive selection  exhibited physicochemical alterations across taxa and at least three properties were represented in each codon. a maximum of five different physicochemical properties were identified for codon position  <dig>  in primates, amino acid substitutions in samd9l were once again quite conservative, given that thirteen positions kept the same physicochemical properties even when amino acid substitutions happened. on the contrary, among the four rodentia species, only three positions in samd9l presented the same physicochemical properties, but just one was in fact the same amino acid.

to detect whether some sites along particular samd <dig> and samd9l lineages were under positive selection, we employed branch-site model a . on the samd <dig> phylogenetic tree we identified six branches  with ω ratio greater than  <dig>  but only the common shrew  branch had a statistical significant lrt . samd9l branch-site analysis revealed a total of twelve branches with ω ratio greater than  <dig>  yet only four of those branches presented a statistical significant lrt. both the sumatran orangutan  and the domestic guinea pig  branches had statistical significance < <dig> , while the west european hedgehog  and the common shrew  branches had statistical significance < <dig> .

inference of positive selection at samd <dig> and samd9l deduced proteins level
the evaluation of destabilizing radical changes that may occur in specific regions of proteins should complement the information obtained from positive selection analyses at the gene level. using treesaap software, it is possible to estimate, from a phylogenetic tree, the amino acid properties under selection from the thirty-one available in the software
 <cit>  .

for both samd <dig> and samd9l phylogenetic trees, the two amino acid properties with the most radical value  denoting positive destabilizing selection were the isoelectric point  and the equilibrium constant  . when comparing the pi values among species for each protein, we observed a high variability across them, especially for samd9l taxa . for samd <dig> proteins, both the cow  and the domestic guinea pig  exhibited the lowest pi , while a pi of  <dig>  for the northern white-cheeked gibbon was the highest observed in samd <dig> proteins. samd9l proteins from placental mammals exhibited a larger range for the pi values with the giant panda  presenting the lowest pi  and the horse  exhibiting the highest pi . interestingly, the marsupial grey short-tailed opossum samd9l deduced protein presented the lowest pi  of all. the differences in the pi, and especially in samd9l proteins, may cause dramatic effects on proteins folding, since those changes are caused by significant differences in the polarity of the amino acids that compose the proteins. besides the pi and equilibrium constant, samd <dig> presented two other properties under strong positive destabilizing selection, while five more properties were identified as being under positive destabilizing selection for the samd9l alignment .

regarding the samd <dig> sliding window, the four amino acid properties with significant z-score values  were evenly distributed along the samd <dig> proteins alignment . however, a superior concentration of higher z-score values was observed in the region between amino acid  <dig> and  <dig>  specifically for the pi. the samd9l sliding window showed a dense pattern for the seven amino acid properties under destabilizing selection . yet, two regions of samd9l proteins alignment presented an even larger density of properties and the highest z-score values for some of those properties: amino acid range of 208– <dig> and the range of 863– <dig> 

discussion
from a previous study, samd <dig> and its paralogue samd9l have been identified in a variety of species, namely in human, chimpanzee, dog and rat. however, in the house mouse  genome, samd <dig> was uniquely lost
 <cit> . the same study indicated the absence of both genes in chicken, frog and all currently sequenced fish species, suggesting that the samd9/samd9l genes originating event had occurred after the mammalian radiation. one of our goals was to intensify the identification of samd <dig> and samd9l within different mammalian genomes and also verify whether the loss of mouse samd <dig> was a unique event restricted to this taxon.

despite the great number of morphological, molecular and phylogenetic studies for the order rodentia, controversies relating to the divergence times between its major suborders still persist
 <cit> . in a recent study on rodent evolution
 <cit>  some internal rodent branches have been resolved, where three main groups in the phylogenetic tree were supported: the mouse-related clade, ctenohystrica clade and the squirrel-related clade. a scenario has been proposed where the pre-squirrel-related clade diverged early from the common ancestor followed by a later separation of the pre-mouse-related and pre-ctenohystrica clade
 <cit> . we gathered sequences for one or both samd <dig> and samd9l genes for species representative of the three clades. the two genes were present in the thirteen-lined ground squirrel , the domestic guinea pig , the chinese hamster and the brown rat . together with the absence of samd <dig> in the house mouse genome, the ord’s kangaroo rat  also did not have this gene annotated in ensembl. with the apparent region synteny for the ord’s kangaroo rat when compared to the other mammals, this absence might just be the case of a genome still to be completely annotated, leaving the house mouse as the only rodent taxon that has lost samd <dig>  at least from the currently available genomic sequence database.

a great number of the available mammalian genomes are still not completely annotated. therefore, we made no assumptions regarding samd <dig> and samd9l for those species. nevertheless, we observed that the fairly well annotated cow and pig genomes  had no matches or annotations for samd9l. this information together with the absence of samd <dig> in the house mouse and the already suggested origin of both genes from a common ancestor by ancient gene duplication
 <cit>  led us to the following hypothesis: in some lineages the presence of both genes might be costly for the genome, resulting in the loss of one of the genes that functionally would be overcome by the remaining paralogue. although these observations support the potential existence of certain gene redundancy between samd <dig> and samd9l, we also note the almost nonexistent recombination between them, despite the proximity in the location of these two genes in the genomes of all the annotated mammalian species. this genetic isolation of the two paralogues does not support the existence of functional redundancy between samd <dig> and samd9l. these apparent contradictory hypotheses have to be confirmed with the conduction of functional studies in different species.

with all the available mammalian sequences collected for both samd <dig> and samd9l genes, the performed phylogenetic study resulted in a tree with a well-defined monophyletic group per gene gathering solely placental mammals and a single outgroup, the marsupial grey short-tailed opossum. this supported the speculative hypothesis of samd <dig> and samd9l resulting from a gene duplication event, more precisely, after the divergence of marsupialia from placentalia  <dig>  mya
 <cit> . despite the common ancestor, when testing for the occurrence of potential positive selection acting at the gene and protein levels, we concluded that samd9l is under stronger selection than samd <dig>  this is supported by the fact that a higher number of sites at the gene level and of specific lineages were positively selected in samd9l than samd <dig>  besides, a greater number of amino acid properties were under selection at the deduced protein level of samd9l than samd <dig> 

when we examined the amino acid substitutions and changes on physicochemical properties for sites under selection, it was clear, for both proteins, that members of the rodentia order presented the highest number of divergent alterations for the same codons compared to other mammalian orders. since it is known that in many proteins the amino acid substitutions caused by positive selection are not random
 <cit> , for instances the primate apobec3g residues involved in hiv- <dig> vif interaction
 <cit> , we hypothesize that any occurring alteration in rodents or even in other lineages may be the result of consistent arms race between the host and a pathogen stressor. this could be a significant observation, given that anti-viral properties have been already assigned to human samd <dig> in cultured human cells. specifically, a unique viral gene product, m <dig> of myxoma virus, was found to antagonize the anti-viral properties of samd <dig> protein in order to permit the replication of this virus in cultured human cells
 <cit> .

considering the mammalian species included in this study, selection analyses performed on samd <dig> and/or samd9l genes for each species individually one may have different results from the obtained in our work, since recombination rates and effective population sizes are expected to differ among species. these species and population specific selection analyses should result in the identification of sites under selection in samd <dig> and/or samd9l genes that can be used in genetic population studies by determining parameters like allele and genotype frequencies, and fst and nucleotide diversity values. this contributes to the definition of genotypes that might be favorable or not, for example, to the defence against certain pathogens.

human samd <dig> and samd9l have solely one defined domain, the sterile alpha motif , a module of about  <dig> amino acid residues long
 <cit> , specifically  <dig> amino acids and  <dig> in samd <dig> and samd9l, respectively. sam domains, one of the most common protein domains found in eukaryotic cells, are protein-protein interaction modules that perform a large number of different functions
 <cit>  and are not easily categorized. indeed, different sam domains can self-associate, bind to other sam domains and/or to non-sam proteins, and even interact with rna, dna or lipids
 <cit> . because of the great variety of known functions, the presence of a sam domain does not necessarily involve a specific function or pathway, but an array of possible functions. for both human samd <dig> and samd9l, no function has yet been assigned to their sam domains, but for samd <dig> the ability to form sam polymers has been suggested
 <cit> . from our evolutionary study on both proteins, none of the identified sites or amino acid properties under positive selection overlapped with the deduced sam domains, demonstrating a high level of conservation among the mammalian species.

CONCLUSIONS
since the origin and evolution of the samd <dig> and samd9l genes were first reported, a great number of mammalian genomes have been sequenced, allowing now a more detailed view into the evolutionary history of both genes. our study supports the previously suggested origin of samd <dig> and samd9l from a mammalian ancestral duplication event. specifically, according to the results from our study, this event occurred after the divergence of marsupialia from placentalia. when considering the mostly complete mammalian genomes collected for this study, the apparent loss of samd <dig> or samd9l in some species led us to propose that some overlapping functional redundancy exists between the two proteins, despite the almost nonexistent recombination between the two closely located genes from other species. from the positive selection analyses performed, both at gene and protein levels, we demonstrate that samd <dig> and samd9l continue to be under long term selective pressure, with even stronger evidence for positive selection in samd9l.

both samd <dig> and samd9l genes are upregulated by type i interferon, a classic feature associated with many innate pathogen-response genes called interferon-stimulated genes . indeed, human samd <dig> has already been shown to be a functional inhibitor for at least one viral pathogen, a poxvirus called myxoma virus, that expresses a specific viral inhibitor  that counteracts the anti-viral properties of samd9
 <cit> . our results suggest that at least the samd <dig> genes may have been under sustained selection pressure exerted by viral pathogens.

our work is the first complete study to investigate the evolutionary history of mammalian samd <dig> and samd9l.
