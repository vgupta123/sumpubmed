BACKGROUND
zinc finger  domains  are found in a large number of eukaryotic proteins  <cit> . a single zf normally forms a globular structure that is stabilized by binding a zinc ion. many classes of zfs have been described in public databases , with cys-xn-cys-xn-his-xn-his  being one of the most common. most c2h <dig> zf proteins contain tandem arrays of the c2h <dig> motif, which are located at specific intervals to form a functional domain. zfds were originally identified as the dna-binding domain of transcription factor iiia  and other transcription factors, but accumulating evidence suggests that zfds also bind rna and proteins  <cit> . since zfds are essential for many biological processes, their structure-function relationships have been well studied. for the dna-binding zfs, the structures of zfd-dna complexes have been elucidated for gli  <cit> , tfiiia  <cit> , zif <dig>  <cit> , yy <dig>  <cit> , and wt <dig>  <cit> . these findings have enabled the development of synthetic zf proteins as versatile molecular tools  <cit> . despite their important and widespread roles, the structural basis of zfd-protein interactions is less understood than those of zfd-dna interactions.

the identification of the critical structural features of protein-binding zfds remains elusive  <cit>  but some clues are available for a group of zfs that mediate protein-to-protein interactions  <cit> . previously, we studied the intra-molecular protein-to-protein interaction between two adjacent c2h <dig> zfs  <cit> . the two n-terminal zfs  of human zic <dig>  which has a zfd composed of five zfs , form a single structural unit through a common hydrophobic core. this zf-connecting hydrophobic core is associated with two tryptophan residues, each of which is located between the zinc-binding cysteine residues in zf <dig> and zf <dig>  mutation of the tryptophan in zf <dig>  perturbs the subcellular localization and function of the protein, and is associated with a pathological and congenital heart malformation  <cit> . the importance of these tryptophan residues is further supported by their conservation among more than  <dig> zic proteins identified in a wide range of eumetazoan species  <cit> .

previous studies have revealed that human gli <dig>  and yeast zap <dig>  also possess zfs with two tryptophans in the corresponding region and that these tryptophans are located in the hydrophobic core formed by two adjacent zfs  <cit> . these data raise the possibility that domains containing the consensus sequence "cys-x-trp-xn-cys-xn-his-xn-his-xn-cys-x-trp-xn-cys-xn-his-xn-his", which we have named the tandem cwch <dig>  motif, are involved in the interaction between the two adjacent zfs. since our knowledge of the tcwch <dig> motif is limited to a small group of proteins, the biological significance of the tcwch <dig> structure is unclear.

in the present study, we performed a computer-based analysis of the tcwch <dig> motif using sequence data derived from public databases. we classified the tcwch2-containing sequences into gene classes and then determined their conservation status in each protein family and their phylogenic distribution. we also identified sequence features unique to tcwch2-containing zfds. the significance of the tcwch <dig> motif is discussed in terms of its possible structural and functional roles.

RESULTS
three-dimensional structure of known tcwch <dig> motifs
to investigate the positions of the two key tryptophan residues in different tcwch <dig> motifs, we performed a structural alignment to compare the three-dimensional  structures of the tcwch <dig> motifs from zic <dig> , gli <dig>  and zap <dig>  zfds  with that of two c2h <dig> zfs. our data show that all of these c2h <dig> zf motifs form globular structures composed of two anti-parallel β sheets and an α helix . the two tryptophan residues between the two zinc-chelating cysteine residues  were localized onto the anti-parallel β sheet where they were juxtaposed to each other. the relative positions of the two tryptophans were similar among the three tcwch <dig> structures, as was each zinc-chelating residue. the tryptophan side chains were close to the zinc-chelating histidine in the same zf, and the hydrophobic residues in the same and the opposite zf . this result suggested that the tryptophans play a role in both the stabilization of their own zfs and the formation of a hydrophobic core between the two adjacent zfs. the conserved positioning of the tcwch <dig> motif-forming residue in evolutionarily distant sources led us to investigate its phylogenetic distribution and structural features.

database search for tcwch2-containing sequences
we performed a comprehensive search of tcwch <dig> motif-containing genes in current databases. we performed an initial search of the non-redundant ncbi protein database with phi-blast using the tcwch <dig> pattern deduced from the zic comparison and human zic <dig>  as the query sequence. this search yielded a set of  <dig> amino acid sequences that were tentatively classified into  <dig> gene classes according to their annotations and the pilot phylogenetic tree analyses . for the fine analysis of the tcwch2-containing sequences, we performed tblastn and pblast searches of the non-redundant sequence collection of the ncbi database using the representative sequences of the initial  <dig> gene classes and  <dig> specific genes  as the key sequences. in order to examine the distribution of the tcwch <dig> sequence motif in a phylogenetic tree of eukaryotes, tblastn searches were also performed on a whole-genome shotgun sequence database of  <dig> organisms. the sequences obtained were manually checked to remove any redundant sequences. the final tcwch <dig> collection contained  <dig> sequences that represented the non-redundant tcwch2-containing sequences from a wide range of organisms . because the mizf and zap1/zafa family genes and one dictyostelium gene contain two independent tcwch <dig> motifs, our collection included a total of  <dig> independent sequence regions for tcwch <dig> 

at this point, we re-evaluated the initial sequence pattern for phi-blast because it was based solely on the sequence compilation of the zic family genes. the initial phi-blast pattern recovered 90%  of the collected sequences . among the  <dig> non-matching sequences,  <dig> sequences showed deviation in the c, w, and h residues of the tcwch <dig> motif and  <dig> sequences showed derangement of the sequence length between the two cwch <dig> motifs. this mismatch appeared to be distributed randomly and suggested that optimization of the phi-blast pattern was unlikely to be informative. therefore, we optimized the lengths of the intervening sequences. phi-blast searches using the original pattern "xcxwxcxhxhxcxwxcxhxhx" with a tcwch <dig> consensus sequence  yielded  <dig> sequences, of which  <dig> sequences were included in our non-redundant tcwch <dig> collection. this number corresponded to 83% of the tcwch <dig> sequences in the ncbi protein database . a looser pattern, "xcxwxcxhxhxcxwxcxhxhx" yielded  <dig> sequences that contains  <dig> tcwch <dig> sequences  . the sequences identified by the looser pattern included zfp <dig> sequences that contain a pair of cwch <dig> zfs separated by another two c2h <dig> zfs. these data suggest that decreasing the stringency of the search  impairs the fidelity of the search. therefore, we consider that the original phi-blast pattern is more useful for the tcwch <dig> survey.

classification and domain structure of tcwch <dig> sequence-containing proteins
we classified the non-redundant tcwch2-containing sequences based on the available flanking amino acid sequences of the tcwch <dig> domain . each gene contained one or two tcwch <dig> motifs among a total of 2- <dig> c2h <dig> zf motifs. proteins containing only one tcwch <dig> domain suggest that a single tcwch <dig> constitutes the minimal zfd component. in the zfds composed of both tcwch <dig> and non-tcwch <dig> c2h <dig>  tcwch2s were always placed at the n-terminal end of the clustered zfds.

the  <dig> sequences included one fungus/metazoan common gene family , four metazoan gene families , three fungus gene families , two social amoeba genes , and one monosiga gene. in addition, we identified three novel fungal gene groups . we have summarized the structural features of each tcwch <dig> gene class together with major gene functions below and in figure  <dig> 

function, structure, and classification of the gene classes containing tcwch2
zic/gli/glis
the proteins encoded by these three gene classes mediate various processes in animal development  <cit> . their zfd is commonly composed of five c2h <dig> zfs, and can bind dna  <cit> .

arid2/rsc9
arid2/rsc <dig> genes are known to encode components of an atp-dependent chromatin remodeling complex  <cit> . the arid  and tcwch <dig> domains are conserved in arid <dig> and rsc <dig> . another conserved sequence motif was found in the c-terminal flanking region of the tcwch <dig> motif. this sequence motif is summarized as "ixl  axl  l  n  × " and we named this motif the lil domain. phi-blast searches for lil domains suggested that this domain was distributed only in the arid2/rsc <dig> proteins .

pacc
pacc mediates gene expression regulation by ambient ph in filamentous fungi and yeasts  <cit> . it contains an n-terminal dna binding domain with three zfs. other zf domains, named a, b, and c, are involved in responses to ph change  <cit> .

mizf
mizf was originally reported as a seven zf-containing protein  <cit> . we identified two additional c2h <dig> zfs in the gene sequence encoding this protein . the two tcwch <dig> motifs in the first four zfs  were separated by longer intervening sequences  than most zfs.

aebp2
mammalian aebp <dig> is a dna binding transcription factor  <cit> . its drosophila homolog, jing, is required for cellular differentiation  <cit> .

zap1/zafa
the proteins encoded by zap1/zafa should be grouped together because of the similarity in structure of their zf domains  and similarities in their functional roles in zinc homeostasis  <cit> . our alignments of zap1/zafa sequences from seven fungal species  reveal significant similarity in their zfds . the zfds contain a maximum of eight c2h <dig> zf motifs in which the two n-terminal zf pairs  can form tcwch <dig> motifs. zf1- <dig> and zf3- <dig> are separated by longer intervening sequences than most zfs. our alignments showed that conservation of zf <dig>  zf <dig>  and zf <dig> was incomplete.

fungus-gli-like 
the amino acid sequences encoded by this group of genes have been known as "fungus gli like". here, we have named these sequences fungl  .

zfp106
zfp <dig> is a metazoan zf protein of unknown function  <cit> . it contains two pairs of zfs at each end. wd <dig> repeats  are known to mediate protein-protein interactions  <cit> .

tandem-cwch2-protein-c-terminal 
the sequences are composed of  <dig> to  <dig> amino acid residues . on the basis of these structural features , we named this gene family twincl .

clr1
the zfs among members of the clr <dig> family  <cit>  were highly divergent and other sequences were not conserved . therefore, we omitted this gene family from the consensus sequence and phylogenetic tree analyses.

fungus-gli-like-4zf 
this gene group includes annotations from rhizopus oryzae and batrachochytrium dendrobatidis representing the fungal phyla mucoromycotina and chytridiomycota, respectively. the proteins encoded by the fungl-4zf gene family contain four zfs that are weakly similar to those in gli and fungl . based on the zf motif organization, we tentatively grouped them separately from fungl. however, based on their sequence similarity and phylogenetic classification it is possible that the fungl-4zf and fungl gene groups are derived from a common ancestral gene  <cit> .

dictyostelium discoideum tcwch2
the social amoeba dictyostelium discoideum belongs to the amoebozoa supergroup. there are two tcwch2-containing genes in this gene class, ddhp <dig>  and ddhp <dig>  the zfd alignment of these genes is shown in additional file  <dig> 

monosiga brevicollis tcwch2
since monosiga brevicollis is the only species among the choanoflagellates in which the genome has been fully sequenced, the presence of one tcwch <dig> sequence  may be more functionally meaningful than the singleton sequences in metazoa and fungi. the existence of an rfx domain  raised the possibility that the tcwch <dig> sequence in monosiga brevicollis and arid2/rsc <dig> is derived from a common ancestral gene.

unclassified sequences
six sequences were not classified into the above  <dig> categories . four out of the six unclassified sequences contained weak similarities to pacc, fungl, fungl-4zf, and mizf. the remaining two sequences from fungi did not show any significant homology to the other sequences.

isolated tcwch <dig> in metazoan gene families
we found rare occurrences of the tcwch <dig> motif in some metazoan gene families, including three tcwch2-containing sequences in the sp <dig> family , one in the trp <dig> family , one in the krüppel-like factor  <dig> family , and one in the pbrm- <dig> family  . we did not include these genes in the following analysis because their significance was not clear.

tcwch <dig> sequences in plant databases
two plant tcwch2-containing sequences were found. one sequence  was the ref <dig> homolog of a moss  . although ref <dig> is conserved in many plants, the cwch <dig> was not found in other plant species including arabidopsis thaliana, oryza sativa, and vitis vinifera . the other sequence, ak <dig>  was from oryza sativa but is highly homologous to pacc. this sequence was otherwise only detected in fungi and therefore might represent contamination of oryza sativa with fungal material.

in the course of the classification procedure, we extracted the sequences belonging to each gene family irrespective of the presence of tcwch <dig> motifs identified by blast search using representative entire amino acid sequences. within this group, we examined the extent of conservation of the cysteine, tryptophan, and histidine residues contributing to the tcwch <dig> motifs. the analysis indicated that the tryptophans in cwch <dig> motif-constituting residues were generally conserved  .

athe percentages indicate conservation of the tryptophan residues in each gene class. in mizf and zap1/zafa, there are two independent tcwch <dig> motifs, for which zf <dig>  indicates the n-terminally located one and zf <dig>  indicates the c-terminally located one.

similarity among tcwch <dig> gene classes
we performed molecular phylogenetic analyses to identify similarities among the tcwch <dig> gene classes. for this purpose, we selected flanking zfs containing tcwch <dig>  because the tcwch <dig> itself yielded very little information on sequence similarities, presumably because it is short. in addition, genes widely distributed among fungi or metazoa were used for this analysis because our preliminary analysis suggested that genes with a narrow phylogenetic distribution  had strongly divergent sequences that may confound the phylogenetic tree analyses  <cit> . using the tcwch2+1zf  amino acid sequences, we constructed phylogenetic trees by the bayesian inference , maximal likelihood , and neighbor joining  methods. the  <dig>  sequences, representing a wide phylogenic range, were subjected to this analysis using the dna-binding classical c2h <dig> zfs of tfiiia as outgroup sequences .

each class of tcwch2-containing genes was strapped with high bootstrap values in the bi, ml, and nj methods, supporting the validity of the above classification. phylogenetic tree analyses revealed the relationships among the tcwch <dig> gene families and revealed a novel relationship among the metazoan zic, gli, and glis gene families. these three gene families were grouped together, whereas gli and glis formed a sub-group in the branch of the zic/gli/glis group. it is known that vertebrate zic, gli, and glis are composed of six, three, and three paralogs, respectively. interestingly, glis <dig> and glis <dig> were separately grouped with their insect homologs  and sea anemone nematostella homologs , indicating that the two paralogs existed in the common ancestors of cnidarians and bilaterians. on the other hand, vertebrate zic and gli paralogs were not grouped with the invertebrate homologs , suggesting that vertebrate zic and gli paralogs were generated in vertebrate ancestors.

fungl was determined to have sequence similarity with the zic/gli/glis group. the fungl group branch was always located closest to the zic/gli/glis group in the bi, ml, and nj trees, but statistical support was weak . the other gene groups with more than two classes of tcwch <dig> motif were not strongly supported . however, zap1/zafa class and aebp <dig> class proteins were grouped together by the bi and ml methods, and the pacc family was placed in the basal root of the bi and ml trees beside the other tcwch2+zf <dig> sequences from metazoa and fungi.

distribution of the tcwch <dig> sequences in the phylogenetic tree
based on the above analysis, we investigated the phylogeny of the tcwch <dig> motif . in global terms, tcwch <dig> sequences were detected in all of the organisms we examined in the opisthokonta supergroup, including metazoa, fungi, choanoflagellate  and microsporidia . in the amoebozoa supergroup, we found two tcwch2-containing genes in the social amoeba dictyostelium discoideum, but not in entamoeba histolytica. apart from opisthokonta and amoebozoa, two sequences were found in the plantae databases, but their meaning is not clear. thus, it appears that the distribution of the tcwch <dig> sequence motif is essentially limited to the uniconta  in current sequence databases.

we examined the distribution of each tcwch <dig> motif class in the phylogenetic tree . arid2/rsc <dig> class genes were most widely detected in both fungi and metazoa. on the other hand, tcwch <dig> was not detected in the sequences from the order saccharomycetales . zic/gli/glis, aebp <dig>  and mizf were widely distributed in metazoan groups, but zfp <dig> was detected only in bilateralia except ecdysozoa. pacc, zap1/zafa, and fungl class genes were widely distributed among the fungi groups. distribution of twincl class genes was restricted to aspergillus and its close relatives. clr <dig> class sequences were found only in schizosaccharomyces and cryptococcus. fungl-4zf class genes were recovered only from the basal fungi .

additional sequence features in the tcwch <dig> motifs
we generated tcwch <dig> consensus sequences for each gene class as well as for all classes to identify any additional sequence features. the prosite database pdoc <dig> alignment was used for the reference consensus sequence of general c2h <dig>  the extent of conservation is indicated by the size of letters, and the consensus sequences are aligned graphically . classical c2h <dig> zfs are known to have a consensus sequence of "xcx2cxfx7lx2hx4h"  <cit> . the tcwch <dig> motifs also contain conserved phenylalanine and leucine residues between the cysteine and histidine residues. phenylalanine and leucine are hydrophobic residues that generally mediate a hydrophobic interaction within a single zf . these data indicate that the general structure of a single zf is well conserved in the tcwch <dig> motif  and that there are some tcwch2-specific structures apart from the conserved tryptophan residues.

firstly, a position-specific bias to hydrophobic residues was found in the c-terminal region adjacent to the first histidine residue in zf <dig> and zf <dig> . valine, leucine, and isoleucine were frequently found at ϕ <dig> position , and valine, leucine, isoleucine, and methionine were frequently found at ϕ <dig> position  in contrast to those in a compilation of general c2h <dig> sequences  . the difference in the summed frequency of each position was statistically significant . these positions were close to the tryptophan residues on the opposite side of the zf as determined in the superimposed 3d structures of zic, gli, and zap <dig> tcwch2s . the biased residue frequency may reflect the spatial restriction of amino acid choices. since the cwch <dig> structure suggests the presence of four hydrophobic residues in a compact space, the residue paired with each tryptophan could not be a residue with a large side chain, such as phenylalanine or tryptophan.

secondly, the linker sequence of the two zfs in tcwch <dig> was significantly longer  than those of general c2h <dig> sequences  . there were no canonical tgep-like sequences in the tcwch <dig> linker sequences, whereas the tgep linker sequence was found in about 65% of the sequences in the pdoc <dig> alignment. accordingly, conservation of the tcwch <dig> linker sequences was generally low , and their lengths were more strongly divergent than those of tgep zfs . elongation of the linker was commonly found in the zap1/zafa , mizf  and arid2/rsc <dig>  classes.

thirdly, extra sequences were inserted between the tryptophan and cysteine residues in tcwch <dig>  this type of insertion was limited to the sequences from the first zf of zic/gli/glis, arid2/rsc <dig>  and zap1/zafa and the second zf of arid2/rsc <dig> classes. the number of amino acid residues between the two cysteines of tcwch <dig> varied from four to  <dig> and was mostly four residues in other classes  <cit> . this insertion forms an extra looping structure in zic <dig>   <cit> .

discussion
the tcwch <dig> motif is a hallmark of inter-zinc finger interactions
the tcwch <dig> motif was originally proposed as an evolutionarily conserved sequence involved in the interaction between zfs in human zic <dig>  <cit> . the presence of the tcwch <dig> motif in the gli family, glis family, zap <dig>  and pacc has been previously reported  <cit> . superimposition analysis revealed a tightly conserved structure among zic <dig>  gli, and zap <dig>  supporting the importance of the tcwch <dig> motif in structural terms. strong conservation of the tcwch <dig> tryptophan residues in each gene class suggests that there has been strong selective pressure for them during evolution.

our analysis revealed additional structural features of tcwch <dig> besides the conserved tryptophans, which may be explained by adaptation of its role in mediating the inter-zf interaction . firstly, there is a preference for valine, leucine, or isoleucine in the ϕ <dig> and ϕ <dig> position. this can be regarded as an adaptive adjustment for forming hydrophobic cores of the appropriate size. furthermore, hydrophobic interaction between ϕ <dig> and ϕ <dig> is likely because they are closely located within 4Å distance in the 3d structure models of zic <dig>  gli and zap <dig> . this also can influence the amino acid preferences in ϕ <dig> and ϕ <dig> position. secondly, elongation of the linker sequences may also reflect a structural adaptation to allow the motif to face the two globular c2h <dig> units. linker length and sequence are important for the function of the dna-binding c2h <dig> zf, because they determine the distance of each zf and the linker contacts to the dna base  <cit> . however, optimization of the canonical linker length for dna-binding may not be enough to yield opposed positioning of zf units. the bending between the two zfs may be larger than is dictated by the dna binding state of the zfs as revealed in the gli-dna complex structure  <cit> . longer linker size seems to be a general feature of tcwch <dig>  but conservation of the linker sequences within each class varies notably. linker conservation in pacc is particularly high, despite the widespread distribution of this gene in fungi, thus suggesting that the linker in pacc is under evolutionary constraint.

another structural feature, the addition of extra sequences, is plausible if we assume the reduction of structural constraint as a consequence of specialization in the inter-zf interaction. for example, the conservation of tcwch2-forming zf <dig> is lower than that of zf2- <dig> in zic proteins  <cit> . in the case of the gli-dna complex, the tcwch2-forming zf <dig> does not directly participate in dna binding  <cit> , and the sequence conservation of gli family zf <dig> is also lower than in zf2- <dig> . the extra sequences in the zic/gli/glis, zap1/zafa , and arid/rsc <dig> classes show poor conservation .

it is unclear if tcwch <dig> is the only structure required for inter-zf interactions. the c2h <dig> zfd is capable of achieving protein-to-protein interactions in many cases  <cit> . interestingly, in a previous study to design synthetic zfs utilizing in vitro-evolving protein-to-protein interactions  <cit> , it was found that the hydrophobic residues in zif <dig> that interacted between the artificial proteins and the zif <dig> c2h <dig> zf were similar to those involved in the gli inter-zf interaction. superimposition revealed that the position corresponding to the tryptophan in tcwch <dig> is occupied by a valine, suggesting that either intramolecular or intermolecular protein-to-protein interactions, mediated by hydrophobic residues, are generally utilized for c2h <dig> zfs. however, the strong conservation of the tcwch <dig> and accompanying structural features suggest that tcwch <dig> is a highly specialized c2h <dig> zf for inter-zf interactions between two adjacent zfs.

evolution of the tcwch <dig> motif
we hypothesize that the original tcwch <dig> motifs were generated from classical c2h <dig> zfs  that occur widely in eukaryotic organisms, including plantae, excavata, chromalveolata, and rhizaria. tcwch <dig> motifs were found in the vicinity of c2h <dig> zf in several tcwch <dig> gene classes. it is proposed that the tcwch <dig> sequence appeared in the common ancestor of opisthokonta or unikonta . the acquisition of the tryptophans and additional structural features of tcwch <dig> may have occurred concurrently in the course of evolution. whether the evolution of tcwch <dig> occurred once or multiple times during opisthokonta/amoebozoa evolution remains unclear. however, its short sequence and some isolated distribution in the plant supergroup and metazoan gene families may favor the multiple-origins hypothesis. although the lineage relationship among the tcwch <dig> classes remains unclear, we can presume the presence of the following tcwch <dig> ancestral genes: an arid2/rsc <dig> common ancestor, which may have existed before the diversification of metazoa and fungi; a zic/gli/glis common ancestor, an aebp <dig> ancestor, and a mizf ancestor in the early metazoa; a fungl ancestor, a pacc ancestor, a fungl-4zf ancestor, and a zap1/zafa ancestor in the early fungi; a zfp <dig> ancestor in early bilaterians; a twincl ancestor in the founder of aspergillus and its close siblings; and a clr <dig> ancestor in the founder of dikarya, althogh most dikarya may have lost the gene. once the tcwch <dig> structures were established, they may have been more strongly conserved in these classes.

function and role of tcwch2
there are several cases that directly indicate the functional importance of the tcwch <dig> motif in living organisms. in the case of pacc, mutation of the tryptophan of tcwch <dig> induces a loss of its dna binding activity  <cit> . in case of human zic <dig>  the tryptophan mutation is proposed to be associated with the occurrence of a familial congenital heart defect, and biochemical analysis revealed that transcriptional activity and protein stability are decreased in the mutant protein  <cit> . in yeast zap <dig>  interaction between the two zf where the tcwch <dig> motif is located is required for the high-affinity binding of the zinc ion  <cit> . also, it has been shown that the inter-zf interaction is influenced by the concentration of zinc ion  <cit> , suggesting that the tcwch <dig> motif is involved in zinc-sensing in yeast.

apart from the instances referred to above, the functional significance of the tcwch <dig> domain remains unknown. we propose that tcwch <dig> may play roles other than the direct dna binding that is often exerted by classical c2h <dig>  because the linker lengths of tcwch <dig> are more highly divergent than those of the canonical c2h <dig> zfs, in which linker length is a critical parameter for dna-c2h <dig> zf interactions  <cit> . furthermore, the structure of gli, zic <dig>  and zap <dig> tcwch <dig> domains, in which the two adjacent zfs form a single globular structure  <cit> , is clearly different from the structure of the dna-binding c2h <dig> zf domain where each globular zf unit wraps around the major groove of the dna  <cit>  . in the case of gli tcwch <dig>  which is the only tcwch <dig> with a known dna-binding 3d structure, the n-terminal zf of gli <dig> tcwch <dig> does not contact dna  <cit> .

assuming that the tcwch <dig> domain has a function other than dna binding, what roles could tcwch <dig> play? firstly, our domain structure analysis implies that tcwch <dig> likely regulates its neighboring domains, such as canonical c2h <dig> zf, wd <dig>  and lil. zic/gli/glis, pacc, mizf, aebp <dig>  zap1/zafa, fungl, clr <dig>  and fungl-4zf possess canonical zf in the c-terminal flanking region of the tcwch <dig>  in the case of pacc, analyses of cwch <dig> motif-containing tryptophan mutants suggests that dna binding mediated by zf <dig> and zf <dig> may be influenced by tcwch <dig> motifs in zf <dig> and zf <dig>  <cit> . it is possible that tcwch <dig> motifs in the other members of this group act similarly in the regulation of neighboring canonical c2h <dig> domains. in transcription factors, dna binding domains such as the canonical c2h <dig> zf, can define a target sequence and fix the protein position  with respect to the dna. the tcwch <dig> motif could provide a 'hinge' or modulatory junction that controls the relative positioning of other functional domains. secondly, tcwch <dig> motifs may provide a capping structure that isolates the structural influence of n-terminal flanking region. in the case of zic <dig>  mutations in its tcwch <dig> motif increase the random coil contents more than the zinc-free state  <cit> . a unique terminal structure in a domain composed of repeating structural motifs is also seen in other conserved domains  <cit> . in the case of small leucine-rich repeats and ankyrin repeats, n-capping structures are responsible for protein stability  <cit> . thirdly, tcwch <dig> binding to other molecules is possible, and is observed for many conserved domains. transcriptional regulator and chromatin remodeling proteins form complexes with many different proteins in order to be functionally active  <cit> . therefore, the tcwch <dig> zf may not be associated with dna binding but may serve in protein recognition similar to many c2h <dig> zfs  <cit> .

the distribution and conservation of the tcwch <dig> sequence motif in various gene classes suggests that this motif has important biological roles. the genes we identified containing one or more tcwch <dig> motifs are known to be involved in various biological processes, including chromatin remodeling , zinc homeostasis , ph sensing , cell cycle regulation, and transcriptional regulation . in addition, given that several gene classes remain to be functionally characterized , the known functional repertoire of the tcwch <dig> motif is likely to increase. we propose that the tcwch <dig> sequence motif is a widespread and functional protein structural motif and that further structural and functional analyses are required to fully understand its roles in biological processes.

CONCLUSIONS
 the 3d structure of tcwch <dig> is highly conserved among human zic <dig>  human gli <dig>  and yeast zap <dig> 

 current databases contained  <dig> tcwch <dig> sequences that can be classified into  <dig> major gene classes  and other minority classes. the tcwch <dig> motifs were found in transcription regulatory factors, chromatin remodeling factors, and ph/zinc homeostasis regulating factors.

 the tcwch <dig> motif is mostly found in opisthokonta  and amoebozoa .

 the tcwch <dig> motif contains three additional structural features:  bias to hydrophobic residues in the ϕ <dig> and ϕ <dig> positions,  longer linkers between the two c2h <dig> motifs, and  insertion of extra sequences. the structural features suggest that the tcwch <dig> motif is a specialized motif involved in inter-zinc finger interactions.
