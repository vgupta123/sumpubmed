BACKGROUND
peach , a member of the rosaceae family, is an important fruit tree crop worldwide. it is a diploid with a small genome size of ~ 230 mb  <cit> . besides providing delicious fruit, peach trees are extensively used in ornamental plantings. in china, ornamental peach has been cultivated for landscape or patio plants for thousands of years. the color of flowers and leaves is one of the most attractive characteristics, which contribute to the ornamental value of plants  <cit> . in peach, red color is caused mainly by the accumulation of anthocyanins.

anthocyanins are the largest group of water-soluble pigments in the plant kingdom and belong to the family of compounds known as flavonoids. anthocyanins are stored in the central vacuole and responsible for the red, blue and purple colors in a wide range of plant tissues, including stems, leaves, roots, flowers, fruits and seeds  <cit> . anthocyanins are synthesized via flavonoid biosynthetic pathway and display a wide range of biological functions such as attracting pollinators and seed dispersers and protecting plants against attack by pathogenic organisms and uv radiation  <cit> . in addition, anthocyanins have a beneficial role in human health because they exhibit a wide range of biological activities such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and anti-cancer activities  <cit> . therefore, anthocyanins have long been the subject of investigation by botanists and plant physiologists.

the conserved biosynthetic pathway of anthocyanins has been well established in ornamental plants such as petunia and snapdragon  <cit> . the biosynthesis of anthocyanins begins with condensation of coumaroyl-coa with malonyl-coa to form naringenin chalcone by chalcone synthase . the chalcone is converted to naringenin by chalcone isomerase . flavanone 3-hydroxylase  then catalyzes hydroxylation of naringenin to yield dihydrokaempferol . dhk can be further hydroxylated to produce dihydromyricetin  or dihydroquercetin  by flavonoid 3′, 5′-hydroxylase  or flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase , respectively. dhk, dhm and dhq are converted into anthocyanidins by dihydroflavonol reductase  and leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase . finally, anthocyanidin is glycosylated by udp glucose: flavonoid 3-o-glucosyltransferase  to generate anthocyanin. to date, anthocyanin pathway genes have been isolated and characterized in a variety of model plants such as petunia, snapdragon, and arabidopsis  <cit> .

the anthocyanin pathway genes are regulated at the transcriptional level by three types of regulatory genes encoding r2r <dig> myb, basic helix-loop-helix  and wd <dig> proteins, respectively  <cit> . these regulators interact with each other to form a mbw complex that binds to promoters and induces transcription of genes of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway. to date, molecular mechanisms underlying anthocyanin biosynthesis in fruits has been widely reported. for example, in grape two adjacent myb transcription factors  vvmyba <dig> and vvmyba <dig> are responsible for the activation of ufgt gene, thus, have a regulatory effect on anthocyanin accumulation  <cit> . similarly, three transcription factors which appear to be allelic, mdmyb <dig>  mdmyb <dig>  and mdmyba, have been isolated and characterized in apple  <cit> . in other rosaceous fruits, such as pear, raspberry, strawberry and plum, homologues of myb <dig> have been isolated  <cit> . more recently, a myb gene, designated ruby, has been identified in citrus and its activation is responsible for the accumulation of anthocyanins in blood oranges  <cit> . besides fruit, anthocyanin accumulation in foliage is also a wide-spread phenomenon and the role of anthocyanins in senescing leaves has been investigated in temperate deciduous plants  <cit> . however, there are few reports on the molecular mechanism underlying red coloration in ornamental trees or other deciduous trees.

peach leaf color is controlled by a single gene , with red allele dominant over green allele  <cit> . recently, the gr locus has been mapped to the middle region of linkage group   <dig>  <cit> . in peach, two myb tfs have been reported to control anthocyanin coloration in fruit skin  <cit>  and flower  <cit> . recently, a cluster of three mybs, termed myb <dig> , myb <dig>  and myb <dig> , on the same genomic fragment where the anther color  trait is located on linkage group  <dig>  were implicated in regulating fruit anthocyanin biosynthesis  <cit> . here, we report the identification of a myb tf in the gr interval, which functions as a candidate gr gene for leaf red coloration of ‘hongyetao’, a popular ornamental peach cultivar in china. the distinctive features of this cultivar are its attractive red leaf coloration and pink-red flowers. the functionality of the peach myb gene has been demonstrated via transient expression in both tobacco and peach. our results add to the comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying anthocyanin biosynthesis in peach.

RESULTS
anthocyanin accumulation in different colored tissues of peach
anthocyanin contents were measured in different tissues of two cultivars hongyetao  and mantianhong  . ‘hyt’ is an ornamental cultivar. it produces small brown-skinned fruits with white flesh and has purple-red leaves, red stems and pink-red flowers in the spring. however, the color of the leaves fades to green with maturity. the pink-red flower contains the highest level of anthocyanins, followed by the red leaf and stem, while the mature green-colored leaf and fruit accumulate little anthocyanin. ‘mth’ has green leaves, red flowers, and white-fleshed fruits. the red flower contains high level of anthocyanins, while the anthocyanin content is very low in other tissues, including leaf, stem and fruit. in summary, anthocyanin accumulation in red-colored tissues is significantly higher than in non-red tissues, which is similar to previous reports that anthocyanin accumulation is responsible for red coloration in peach  <cit> .table  <dig>

identification of candidate gene in the peach gr interval by comparative transcriptome analysis
the gr interval has been mapped to an interval flanked by two ssr markers bppct <dig> and cpdct <dig> on lg <dig>  <cit> . comparison of primer sequences of the two ssr markers against the peach draft genome revealed that the gr interval is about  <dig>  mb in physical size, ranging from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb on lg <dig>  to identify the candidate gr gene, transcriptomes of young leaves from cv. hyt and mth were sequenced using illumina rna-seq technology, yielding  <dig> and  <dig> million transcript reads, respectively. these reads were mapped onto the peach reference genome and the mapping result was deposited in ncbi sra database with accession nos. srx <dig> and srx <dig>  gene expression level was estimated using fpkm  value and a threshold of  <dig>  times fold-change was used to separate the genes differentially and non-differentially expressed. of the  <dig> genes in the gr interval,  <dig> genes were identified to be differentially expressed between red- and green-colored leaves . of these genes, only one  encoding a transcription factor homologous to arabidopsis atmyb <dig> is related to anthocyanin biosynthesis. the gene, designated ppmyb <dig> , showed  <dig>  times higher level of expression in red-colored leaves than in green-colored leaves. besides the ppmyb <dig>  gene, another atmyb <dig> homologue outside the gr interval on lg <dig>  termed ppmyb <dig>   <cit> , was identified in the peach leaf transcriptome. however, its expression level was  <dig> -fold lower in red-colored leaves than in green-colored leaves.table  <dig>

subsequently, we checked the expression levels of anthocyanin structural genes and found ppchs, ppchi, ppf3h, ppf3′h, ppdfr, and ppldox showed  <dig> -,  <dig> -,  <dig> -,  <dig> -,  <dig> -, and  <dig> -fold higher levels of expression, respectively, in red-colored leaves than in green-colored leaves. ppufgt was highly expressed in red leaves, whereas, its transcript was almost undetectable in green leaves. this demonstrates that accumulation of anthocyanin in peach leaf is regulated at the transcriptional level. since anthocyanin biosynthesis is regulated by the mbw complex  <cit> , we also investigated anthocyanin-related bhlh and wd <dig> tfs in the peach leaf transcriptome. two homologues of atgl <dig>  and two homologues of atttg <dig>  were identified. ppbhlh <dig> and ppbhlh <dig> had  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold higher levels of expression level, respectively, in red leaves than in green leaves. in contrast, ppwd40a <dig> and ppwd40a <dig> had  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold lower levels of expression, respectively, in red leaves than in green leaves. taken together, all the results suggest that ppmyb <dig>  is the candidate gene for the gr locus.

two clusters of myb-type anthocyanin regulators in the peach genome
to determinate whether multiple myb genes are involved in the regulation of anthocyanin accumulation in peach leaves, we compared the cdna sequences of ppmyb <dig>  and ppmyb <dig>  against the draft genome of peach cv. lovell using blastn  <cit> . as a result, ppmyb <dig>  and its two paralogs, termed ppmyb <dig>  and ppmyb <dig>   <cit> , were located next to each other within a 72 kb region on chromosome  <dig>  while ppmyb <dig>  and its two paralogs  were clustered within a 63 kb region on chromosome  <dig> . accession numbers of ppmyb <dig>  to ppmyb <dig>  at the genome database for rosaceae  were listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  ppmyb <dig>  was identical in sequence to ppmyb <dig> previously isolated from peach fruit  <cit> . ppmyb <dig>  and ppmyb <dig>  have recently been implicated in peach fruit pigmentation  <cit> . all the six myb tfs consist of three exons separated by two introns. the consensus sequences, gc and ag, were found at the 5′ and 3′-borders of the two introns of ppmyb <dig>  to ppmyb <dig> , strictly following the “gt–ag” splicing site of the eukaryotic introns proposed by breathnach and chambon  <cit> . in contrast, “gt–ag” and “gc-ag” splicing sites were observed for the first and second introns of ppmyb <dig>  to ppmyb <dig> , respectively.figure  <dig>

the evolutionary history assay revealed that the ancestral myb gene at early stages of rosaceae have undergone a duplication, ~  <dig> million years ago , to generate the two gene families, designated mybiand mybii . mybi consists of ppmyb <dig>  to ppmyb <dig>  and their homologues such as mdmyb <dig>  <cit> , mdmyb110a  <cit>  in malus and pymyb <dig>  <cit>  in pyrus and pdmyb <dig> in prunus domestica, while mybii contains ppmyb <dig>  to ppmyb <dig>  and their homologues such as pmmyb gene in prunus mume  <cit> .

expression profiling of anthocyanin related genes in red- and green peach leaves by qrt-pcr
to validate the rna-seq-based gene expression profiles, the expression level of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes was examined in leaves of cv. hyt and mth using qrt-pcr. all the biosynthetic pathway genes, including chi, chs, dfr, f3′h, f3h, ldox, and ufgt, showed significantly higher level of expression in red leaves than in green leaves . for regulator genes, the ppbhlh and ppwd <dig> genes were expressed in leaves, but showed no difference in expression level between red- and green variants . of the six myb genes, four  showed extremely low expression in both red- and green- leaves. ppmyb <dig>  gene was expressed in leaves, but showed no difference in expression level between red- and green-colored leaves. in contrast, the expression level of ppmyb <dig>  gene in red- leaves was significantly higher than those in green- leaves.figure  <dig>

in addition, the expression profile of ppmyb <dig>  gene was also examined in leaves at different developmental stages and a second green foliage cultivar ‘baihuabitao’ was included in the qrt-pcr analysis . the expression levels of ppmyb <dig>  gene were significantly higher in young leaves of cv. hongyetao than those in mature leaves in all three seasons, including spring, summer and autumn. however, the expression levels of ppmyb <dig>  gene were very low in both young and mature leaves of cvs. baihuabitao and mantianhong. the result of qrt-pcr is consistent with that of rna-seq-based gene expression profiling, which confirms that activation of ppmyb <dig>  gene in red leaves.figure  <dig>

ppmyb <dig>  is a functional regulator that induces anthocyanin accumulation in tobacco and peach
transcriptional activity of ppmyb <dig>  was initially tested using a tobacco transient colour assay. ppmyb <dig>  and bhlh <dig> were syringe-infiltrated into the underside of expanding nicotiana tabacum leaves. no pigmentation was observed at infiltration sites 7 days after transformation with ppbhlh <dig> , while a slight pigmentation was observed with infiltration of ppmyb <dig>  . an intense pigmentation was detected at infiltration sites 7 days after transformation with both ppmyb <dig>  and ppbhlh <dig> .figure  <dig>

the functionality of ppmyb <dig>  was further validated by particle bombardment-mediated transient expression in green-colored young leaves of cv. mth. the leaves turned red 2 days after transformation with ppmyb <dig> , but the leaves transformed with empty vector  were still green in color . anthocyanin extraction results showed that the peach leaves transformed with ppmyb <dig>  contained anthocyanin, but not for the ev-transformed leaves . moreover, ppmyb <dig>  was highly expressed in leaves transformed with ppmyb <dig> , while its transcript level was extremely low in leaves transformed with ev . likewise, ppufgt showed over  <dig> times higher expression level in leaves transformed with ppmyb <dig>  than in leaves transformed with ev.figure  <dig>

sequence polymorphisms in the promoter region of ppmyb <dig> 
while there are differences in the expression profile of ppmyb <dig>  between red- and green-colored leaves, the coding sequences of ppmyb <dig>  are identical between cv. hty and mth. hence, a pair of primers 5′-ggatctcgccgctgtttctg-3′ and 5′-tctcactcccgaagaactatccat-3′ was designed to amplify the promoter genomic regions of ppmyb <dig>  in cv. hty and mth. the promoter sequences of ppmyb <dig>  from cvs. hty, mth, and lovell were aligned and  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  and a 3-bp indel were identified within a  <dig> -kb region upstream the ppmyb <dig>  start codon . of these snps, seven were located within potential motifs, which were identified using the place program  <cit> . among these motifs, one mybcore is a potential binding site for myb-type anthocyanin regulators. however, the t/g snp in the mybcore site is found in the promoter of both ‘hyt’ and ‘mth’, suggesting that it is not causative for the red leaf coloration. there was a 3-bp insertion found in the promoter of cv. hyt, and the 3-bp indel site was polymorphic. however, the 3-bp insertion was not found in the promoter of cv. mth and lovell. to test if the 3-bp indel is related to the red leaf coloration, a pair of primers flanking the 3-bp indel  was then designed to amplify products in diverse peach cultivars, including ‘datuanmilu’, ‘gangshanbai’, ‘huyou002’, ‘jinyuan’, ‘may fire’, ‘nanfangzaohong’, ‘ruiguangmeiyu’, ‘wuyuexian’, ‘xizhuangyihao’, and ‘zhaoxia’. all these cultivars have green-colored leaves. however, the 3-bp insertion was also found in the promoter of four cultivars, huyou <dig>  nanfangzaohong, xizhuangyihao, and zhaoxia. this suggests the indel is unlikely to be responsible for leaf red coloration in peach.figure  <dig>

we also identified repetitive elements in the promoter sequences of ppmyb <dig>  using the program repeatmasker . one transposon-like fragment 280 bp in size was found to be located 692 bp upstream of the atg translation start codon. however, the transposon-like fragment is almost identical in nucleotide sequence between hty and mth. this suggests that this transposable element is unlikely to be responsible for activation of ppmyb <dig> .

discussion
the mechanism underlying anthocyanin accumulation in peach leaves
in many plant species, anthocyanin accumulation is controlled primarily via transcriptional regulation by r2r <dig> myb transcription factors  <cit> . here, an r2r <dig> anthocyanin-activating myb gene ppmyb <dig> , which located in the gr interval, is shown to be the candidate gr gene for red leaf coloration in peach. moreover, our study reveals that the ppmyb <dig>  homologue ppmyb <dig>  is also expressed in peach leaf. previous study has demonstrated that ppmyb <dig>  is a functional gene responsible for anthocyanin pigmentation in peach skin  <cit> . however, the ppmyb <dig>  expression alone is unlikely to induce anthocyanin pigmentation in the peach leaf. firstly, ppmyb <dig>  has no effect on the induction of the ppmyb <dig>  expression. also, ppmyb <dig>  has similar or lower levels of expression in red leaves than green leaves. transcriptome analysis revealed that two homologues  of atmybl <dig>  a negative regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis in arabidopsis, are expressed in leaf. these myb repressors may compete with myb activators for binding sites of bhlh and/or anthocyanin structural genes such as dfr  <cit> . both ppa019522m and ppa010846m are expressed at higher level in red-colored leaf than in green-colored leaf. therefore, it seems that anthocyanin accumulation in peach leaf is likely coordinatively regulated by both positive and negative regulators of anthocyanin biosynthesis.

the r2r <dig> myb tfs are functionally conserved in plants, but may activate distinct sets of structural anthocyanin genes  <cit> . structural anthocyanin genes can be divided into two groups, early biosynthetic genes  and late biosynthetic genes   <cit> . in arabidopsis, pap <dig>  pap <dig>  myb <dig> and myb <dig> control anthocyanin accumulation through regulation of lbgs  <cit> . similarly, two myb genes in grapevine, vvmyba <dig> and vvmyba <dig>  increase anthocyanin biosynthesis in berry through activation of ufgt  <cit> . in contrast, apple mdmyb <dig> activates all genes of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway, leading to anthocyanin pigmentation in fruit, stem and foliage  <cit> . in cauliflower, bomyb <dig> specifically activates both regulatory gene bobhlh <dig> and structural genes of late anthocyanin pathway, including bof3′h, bodfr, and boldox  <cit> .

in this study, the entire set of anthocyanin pathway genes show higher level of expression in red leaves than in green leaves. this indicates that anthocyanin accumulation in peach leaf is regulated at transcriptional level, and ppmyb <dig> , like the apple myb <dig>  may directly or indirectly activate both ebgs and lbgs. on the other hand, transient color assay reveals that the peach ppmyb <dig> , like the apple mdmyb <dig>  interacts with bhlh <dig> to induce anthocyanin biosynthesis  <cit> . previous studies show that the mbw complexes mainly activate lbgs  <cit> . this is also true in our case of the peach transient assay, which shows ppmyb <dig> , like the grapevine vvmyba genes, increases anthocyanin accumulation in leaves through activation of ufgt.

ppmyb <dig>  represents a novel branch of anthocyanin-activating myb genes in rosaceae
gene duplication has frequently occurred in the evolutionary development of anthocyanin-activating myb genes. for example, multiple clustered myb genes have been reported in grapevine  <cit>  and cauliflower  <cit> . in this study, two clusters of three anthocyanin regulatory myb genes in peach have been identified on lgs  <dig> and  <dig>  the chromosome regions covering these two clusters are not derived from the same ancestral paleochromososme of the eudicot paleoancestor  <cit> . in apple, two anthocyanin regulatory genes myb110a and myb110b are also clustered in a 60 kb region on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , and appear to be related to myb <dig> on the homologous chromosome  <dig>  however, we have not found any clusters of anthocyanin-activating myb genes in the strawberry genome  <cit> . the genomes of fragaria, malus and prunus are derived by reconstruction of a hypothetical ancestral rosaceae genome that had nine chromosomes  <cit> . thus, it is likely that the clusters of anthocyanin-activating myb genes have evolved after the divergence of peach from other rosaceae species.

as mentioned above, anthocyanin-activating myb genes in rosaceae can be divided into two families mybi and mybii. interestingly, the mybi family is composed of previously reported myb genes that are mainly responsible for anthocyanin accumulation in fruits. for example, the apple mdmyb110a contributes to anthocyanin accumulation in fruit cortex late in maturity  <cit> . likewise, the peach ppmyb <dig> /2/ <dig> is involved in anthocaynin accumulation in fruit  <cit> . two alleles of the mdmyb <dig> locus mdmyba and mdmyb <dig> control red coloration of apple skin although mdmyb <dig> is able to induce anthocyanin pigmentation in both fruit  and foliage due to its constitutive over-expression profile  <cit> . in contrast, the peach ppmyb <dig>  regulates anthocyanin pigmentation in vegetative organs such as leaves, but not in fruit as ‘hyt’ accumulates no anthocyanins in the fruit. the coding sequences of ppmyb <dig>  was aligned the genome sequence databases of apple and p. mume using blastn, and two genes mdp <dig> and pm <dig> from apple and p. mume, respectively, are found to have the highest level of similarity to ppmyb <dig> . ppmyb <dig>  and its ortholog pm <dig> are diverged from previously reported anthocyanin-activating myb genes in rosaceae to generate a new gene family myb ii. however, mdp <dig> is grouped into the mybi family. our study shows that mybi and myb ii genes can be traced to a common ancestor about  <dig> mya. the most recent common ancestor of malus and prunus has been dated to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya  <cit> , and peach has not undergone recent whole-genome duplication  <cit> . thus, the two myb clusters in the peach genome are likely derived from the hypothetical ancestral rosaceae genome, whereas, the ortholog of ppmyb <dig>  may have been lost in the apple genome after the divergence of apple from peach.

our study indicates that both ppmyb <dig>  and ppmyb <dig>  are not expressed in peach leaf. their transcripts are not identified in our previously reported transcriptomes of peach flower and fruit tissues  <cit> . it has been reported that a sirna, tas4-sirna <dig>  targets a set of myb tfs such as pap <dig> and myb <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit> . a consensus target sequence  for tas4-sirna <dig> is also found in the third exon of both ppmyb <dig>  and ppmyb <dig> . this may be responsible for the finding that ppmyb <dig>  and ppmyb <dig>  are not expressed in any tested tissues of peach. in contrast, ppmyb <dig>  contain no target sites for tas4-sirna <dig>  and its expression is highly induced in red leaves. several snps are found in the promoter region of ppmyb <dig> . in apple, a snp  <dig>  upstream of the atg translation start codon of myb <dig> has been reported to co-segregate with red skin color  <cit> . thus, it is not yet clear if the activation of ppmyb <dig>  gene could be attributed to single nucleotide mutation in promoter region. in addition, a reciprocal translocation is found between linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig> in the f <dig> of an interspecific cross between ‘garfi’ almond and ‘nemared’ peach, and the translocation breakpoint is located in the vicinity of the gr locus  <cit> . this translocation is also found in the f <dig> of a cross between two peach cultivars ‘akame’ and ‘juseitou’  <cit> . since ‘nemared’ and ‘akame’ are both red-leaved cultivars, it is worthy of further study to ascertain the relationship between this translocation and peach leaf coloration.

potential factors affect the change in leaf color of ornamental peach
peach is a member of a group of temperate deciduous fruit trees, many of which produce green leaves and accumulate anthocyanin during the process of senescence in autumn  <cit> . the anthocyanin pigmentation provides effective photo-protection during the critical period of foliar nutrient re-absorption. in contrast, the young expanding leaves of ornamental peach ‘hyt’ are red, but the color of leaves fades to green as they mature. this change in leaf color is attributed to decreased expression of ppmyb <dig> .

temperature is an important factor that affects anthocyanin biosynthesis in plants  <cit> , which in apple is via expression of myb <dig>  <cit> . however, ppmyb <dig>  shows no significant difference in expression level between young red leaves grown in different seasons, including spring, summer and autumn . this is similar to a previous report that the anthocyanin biosynthetic genes have not been strongly down-regulated in grape berry grown at high temperature  <cit> . moreover, the anthocyanin contents are also similar between young red leaves grown in different seasons, which is different from the finding that high temperature increases anthocyanin degradation in grape skin  <cit> . it has been reported that light and hormones play also an important role in anthocyanin biosynthesis  <cit> . thus, other factors, besides temperature may be responsible for the decreased expression of ppmyb <dig> . further studies are needed to clarify what factors play a role in down-regulation of ppmyb <dig>  expression in mature leaves, resulting in the peach leaf color change.

CONCLUSIONS
there are two clusters encoding anthocyanin-activating myb genes in the peach genome, with one gene ppmyb <dig>  in the gr interval on lg  <dig> being responsible for anthocyanin accumulation in peach leaves. anthocyanin-activating myb genes in rosaceae can be divided into two families mybi and mybii, which arise from an ancient duplication about  <dig> mya. mybi family is mainly responsible for anthocyanin accumulation in fruits, while myb ii family regulates anthocyanin accumulation in vegetative organs such as leaves.
