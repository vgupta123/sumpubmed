BACKGROUND
graves’ disease  is an autoimmune thyroid disease which typically presents as thyrotoxicosis and goitre; other clinical findings include graves’ orbitopathy, dermopathy and acropachy. the incidence rate of gd is  <dig> per  <dig>   <dig> persons per year with an overall mean prevalence of  <dig> per  <dig>   <dig> population in the united states  <cit> . women are disproportionately more affected with the female to male ratio reported at  <dig> : <dig>  <cit> . the disease also occurs in children at one tenth the prevalence rate of all ages  <cit> .

gd is a complex disease with a strong familial predisposition;  the triggers are poorly understood but various environmental factors were linked to onset of gd such as stress, smoking and yersinia infection in genetically susceptible individuals  <cit> . gd shows a strong familial predisposition. the concordance rate for gd in monozygotic twins is significantly higher than dizygotic twins and model-fitting analysis predicted that genetic factors account for 79 % of disease heritability in twins  <cit> . with a concordance rate of 22–35 % for monozygotic twins, environmental and modifier factors are likely to play a key role  <cit> . clustering of gd with other autoimmune conditions including type i diabetes mellitus, myasthenia gravis, polymyositis, lupus erythematosus and addison’s disease suggest genes regulating the immune system shared by these diseases might also contribute towards the genetic susceptibility for gd  <cit> .

the genetic susceptibility of gd can be broadly categorized into genes involved in immune regulation, and thyroid specific genes. genes confirmed to be associated with gd include the following: multiple loci within the human leukocyte antigen  i and ii region, as well as non-hla loci ctla <dig>  ptpn <dig>  cd <dig>  il2a, fcrl <dig> and tshr . the contributions from each of these genetic variants are modest. from candidate gene studies, hla class ii alleles drb1* <dig>  dqa1* <dig>  dqb1* <dig> were significantly associated with gd with odd ratios of  <dig> to  <dig> for dr <dig>  <cit> . ctla <dig> a49g, and ct <dig> 3′utr polymorphisms were more frequent in gd with an odds ratio of  <dig>  to  <dig>   and association with ptpn <dig> polymorphism has an odds ratio of  <dig>  to  <dig>   <cit> .

genome wide association studies  have replicated earlier candidate gene study findings and identified additional new genetic loci. the earliest gwas studies on autoimmune thyroid disease showed association of gd with multiple loci within the hla class i and ii regions, and also in tshr and fcrl <dig>  <cit> . more recently two new risk loci for gd, the rnaset2-fgfr1op-ccr <dig> region at 6q <dig> and an intergenic region at 4p <dig> were reported, along with confirmation of positive association of gd with snps in hla-dpb <dig>  tshr, clta <dig> and fcrl <dig>  <cit> . using a custom array, association of snps near ptpn <dig>  ctla <dig>  tshr, rnaset2-fgfr1op-ccr <dig> loci with gd were replicated, and seven novel susceptibility loci, mmel <dig>  lpp, bach <dig>  prickle <dig>  itgam, rs <dig> at 2p <dig>  and rs <dig> at 11q <dig> were identified but the results require confirmation in replication studies  <cit> .

a pooled gwas strategy can effectively identify gene variants in multiple diseases. using relatively small numbers of cases and controls, pooled gwas has previously been used to identify the known susceptibility loci cfh and arms2/htra <dig> in age related macular degeneration and loxl <dig> in pseudoexfoliation syndrome  <cit> . a pooled dna study has also identified a new susceptibility locus, hgf, in keratoconus  and additional novel candidate genes related to platelet reactivity in diabetic patients . the study design must be carefully considered to include multiple pools to minimise pooling errors and an appropriate array platform to extract maximal available information from the pooled dna  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to determine if gwas using dna pooling methodology could replicate genomic loci associated with gd and discover new genetic loci.

methods
definition of graves’ disease
gd cases were participants with biochemically confirmed hyperthyroidism on thyroid function tests; and had either the presence of graves’ orbitopathy, or positive thyrotropin receptor  antibodies or uniform increase in uptake on technetium-99 m pertechnetate thyroid scan.

discovery cohort
the australian thyroid-associated orbitopathy research  discovery cohort consisting of  <dig> gd cases with and without graves’ orbitopathy of european descent was recruited from endocrinology and ophthalmology clinics in the hospitals and private practices from victoria and south australia.

a total of  <dig> controls were recruited from two australian populations. these comprised  <dig> adult patients with keratoconus, a non-autoimmune eye disease unrelated to gd, who were recruited from eye clinics in melbourne, and  <dig> healthy controls aged over 50 years recruited from retirement villages and the general community in south australia. the control cohort was not actively screened for gd, but none of the controls reported having this condition.

replication cohort
an independent group of  <dig> gd cases and  <dig> controls were recruited to form a replication cohort. the gd cases were new cases recruited into the ator cohort  from melbourne, and endocrine and ophthalmology clinics from western australia . the controls were research participants of european descent with eye diseases without recognizable association with gd or other autoimmune diseases  recruited in a collaborative effort from south australia and victoria to study the genetics of these eye diseases .

dna pooling for gwas study
two methods of dna pooling were used. for freshly collected samples, whole blood was pooled directly  and for archived dna samples, equimolar dna pools were created . venous blood or dna aliquots from all participants were thawed for 3 h before construction of  <dig> pool comparisons. pool number  <dig> contained  <dig> gd cases and  <dig> controls, pool number  <dig> had  <dig> gd cases and  <dig> controls, and pool number  <dig> had  <dig> gd cases and  <dig> controls, giving a total of  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls from the discovery cohort. for pool  <dig>  100 μl of whole blood from each sample was mixed with protease and lysis buffer, vortexed and incubated, then samples were combined in one tube for whole blood pool construction,  <dig> tube each for cases and controls. dna was extracted from the whole blood pool by using qia-amp dna blood maxi kit  according to the manufacturer’s protocol. for pool  <dig> and  <dig> samples, whole blood was lysed and dna was extracted from each sample. equimolar dna pools were constructed in duplicate by step-wise dilutions of genomic dna using qia-amp dna blood maxi kit  to 75 ng/μl. we used fluoroskan ascent microplate fluorometer  coupled with picogreen reagents  for dna quantitation. comparisons were made to a standard curve generated from serial dilutions of lambda dna . a total of 451 ng of dna from each sample was added to the equimolar dna pool.

pooling error
previous studies showed that the majority of pooling errors arise from errors on the arrays rather than pool construction errors,  <cit>  hence in this pooling design, multiple illumina humanomni5-quad arrays were used for each pool to reduce array errors. the pooling standard deviation is very small for the illumina bead arrays, pooling standard deviation for humanhap <dig> was estimated between  <dig>  and  <dig> ,  <cit>  and variance for the 1m array was  <dig>  × 10− <dig>  <cit> . this encompasses both assays and pool construction errors. the illumina humanomni5-quad beadchip array supersedes its predecessor arrays; the humanhap <dig> and 1m array, by virtue of its comprehensive coverage of the human genome but is similar in the way of the bead array design.

pooled genotyping and analysis
genome-wide genotyping was conducted at queensland institute of medical research  berghofer medical research institute, using humanomni5-quad beadchip microarray  which contained approximately  <dig>  million markers. three case and control pools, each replicated  <dig> to  <dig> times to minimise measurement error, were generated for comparisons.

the output of the raw beadscores from illumina beadstation were subjected to a series of data cleaning and quality control measures, as described previously for array-based dna pooling studies  <cit> . snps with minor allele frequency  greater than 1 % from the reference panel of eur samples in the  <dig> genomes project were retained for subsequent analysis . we excluded snps with more than 10 % negative beadscores, and snps with the sum of mean red and green scores smaller than  <dig> across each array. a correction factor  was calculated to rescale the green beadscore to calibrate the mean value of the pooling allele frequency  at  <dig>  over all snps on each strand of the array. the paf was computed based on the raw red intensities and the corrected green intensities as paf = red/  <cit> . we further filtered non-autosomal snps and any snps with a significant variance difference between cases and controls.

a final set of autosomal snps meeting the following criteria:  contain sufficient number of probes  display no larger than  <dig>  differences between paf and reference allele frequency from eur samples in the  <dig> genomes project were taken forward for association testing. after data cleaning and quality control,  <dig> m snps were left for association testing. a linear model was used to test for allelic association in the three case-control pools from gd discovery cohort. the test statistic corrected for pooling error was used to rank snps; with p values derived from chi-squared distribution with 1 ° of freedom to assess the significance of allele frequency difference between cases and controls. we then conducted a meta-analysis weighted by inverse variance to combine the results of the three case-control pool comparisons. the top-ranking snps in the meta-analysis were counter checked for proxies . if proxy snps were available, they should also show evidence of association to be considered valid. a genome-wide significance threshold was set at 5 × 10− <dig> to account for multiple testing but snps with p < 1 × 10− <dig> were also included for further evaluation.

individual genotyping and analysis
top-ranked non-major histo-compatability complex  snps with p-value ≤1 × 10− <dig> were selected for technical validation genotyping in individual dna samples that made up the pool as well as for genotyping in the replication cohorts. the top ranking snps were individually genotyped in the discovery cohort in  <dig> gd cases and  <dig> normal controls. a subset of  <dig> controls had insufficient residual samples for individual genotyping, hence the discrepancy in the final pooling and validation sample sizes.

thirteen snps were genotyped on iplex gold assay  by using sequenom massarray® analyzer in two batches. the ator discovery cohort and western australia replication cohort genotyping was performed at the australian genome research facility  and the ator replication cohort at geneworks pty ltd . the allele association analysis was performed using chi-square test  in plink,  <cit>  independently for technical validation in the ator pooled discovery cohort, the replication cohorts and the overall in the discovery and replication cohorts. the odds ratio and 95 % confidence interval for allelic association was further adjusted for covariates age and sex using logistic regression analysis . snps with p ≤ 1 × 10− <dig> were considered validated in validation genotyping. for replication genotyping, p < <dig>  was considered significant.

RESULTS
the gd cases were predominantly female and younger when compared with controls , hence subsequent individual genotyping analysis was adjusted for age and sex.table  <dig> demographics of graves’ disease cases and controls in the discovery and replication cohorts

an additional  <dig> top ranked non-mhc snps suggestive of association  were also selected for validation. of these, four snps showed evidence of association with p < 1 × 10− <dig> when we conducted technical validation genotyping in the individual dna samples. they are rs <dig> on chr  <dig>  rs <dig> on chr  <dig>  rs <dig> on chr  <dig> and rs <dig> on chr  <dig> . amongst these four, rs <dig> was most strongly associated with gd with a p value at  <dig>  × 10− <dig> . when correlating odds ratio of effect allele frequencies in pooled gwas with individual validation genotyping, the results showed strong correlation  .table  <dig> top ranking snps identified from pooled genome wide association study and validation genotyping in the discovery cohort

a second snp, rs <dig>  located downstream of dpysl <dig> on chromosome 8p <dig> is highly ranked for its association with gd in pooled gwas with a p value approaching genome wide significance . the association was not validated in the discovery cohort and for the combined cohort the association with gd is less strong than the discovery pooled gwas would suggest . in the replication cohort, the minor t allele conferred increased odds for gd compared to controls ; after adjusting for sex and age, the result remained significant. . the results suggested this allele might be a genetic locus of interest for gd, but will need further confirmation in future studies.

discussion
this study investigated the genetic associations of gd using a pooled genome wide association study  in  <dig> samples. despite the relatively small number of samples for discovery gwas, the pooled strategy in combination with increased sample size in a second stage of individual genotyping in both the validation and replication cohorts, readily detected evidence of association of a genetic locus upstream of fcrl <dig> on chromosome 1q <dig>  the association of fcrl <dig> with gd has previously been identified in large scale gwas studies  <cit> . the pooled gwas also detected association of gd with multiple snps within the mhc i and mhc ii regions on chromosome 6p <dig>  susceptibility loci within both these regions which contain hla genes involved in antigen presentation, are well established for gd by association studies, candidate gene analysis and gwas . rs <dig> in the un-translated region of hla-dqa <dig> within the mhc class ii region showed evidence of association with gd  in our study. the positive association of hla-dqa <dig> with gd has been replicated in multiple studies  <cit> . two snps within the intron of the c6orf <dig> gene suggesting association with gd , were also independently validated as a locus of susceptibility in gd in a previous gwas study  <cit> .

these replicative findings in gd prove the robustness of the two-stage study design for pooled gwas. the pooled gwas study also found evidence of association for a gene locus marked by rs <dig>  downstream of dpysl <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  but the significance is less certain. the risk attributions from individual genetic variants for gd are known to be small with odds ratios < <dig> ,  <cit>  therefore large sample sizes in the thousands will be needed to increase power for detecting significant association, and may in the future prove or disprove the significance for the rs <dig> locus.

for the two compelling signals we have detected in the vicinity of fcrl <dig> and dpysl <dig>  genetic variants in fcrl <dig> were associated with a modest increase in odds for gd at  <dig>  to  <dig>   <cit> . genetic variation in the promoter region of fcrl <dig> i.e. fcrl <dig> -169t>c allele is reportedly associated with other autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus,  <cit>  suggesting that the fcrl <dig> locus may influence the susceptibility to multiple autoimmune diseases in a similar manner to the immune regulating ctla <dig>  ptpn <dig> and mhc genes  <cit> . to pinpoint the exact locus associated with fcrl <dig>  the entire fcrl region on chromosome 1q <dig> was previously investigated using imputation, and the strongest signals associated with gd were located in a cluster of snps including rs <dig> and rs <dig>  <cit> . snp rs <dig> in the promoter region of fcrl <dig> was also previously reported as positively associated with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and gd  <cit> . rs <dig> tagging rs <dig> and rs <dig> in the fcrl <dig> gene showed association with gd in the wellcome trust case control consortium gwas study , and the association was further confirmed by the china consortium for the genetics of autoimmune thyroid disease, reaching genome wide significance   <cit> . in addition, rs <dig> in fcrl <dig> was also associated with gd   <cit> . we found high linkage disequilibrium of rs <dig>  the snp associated with gd in our study, with rs <dig>  rs <dig> and rs <dig>  that strongly suggest these snps were tagging the same functional variants in the vicinity of the fcrl <dig> gene.

functional analysis suggests fcrl <dig> has immune regulating roles. fcrl <dig> is an fc receptor like molecule that shares a genomic location  and gene structure as a receptor for the fc portion of immunoglobulin with other members of the immunoglobulin superfamily  <cit> . unlike the fc receptor, the fcrl molecule has not been shown biochemically to bind immunoglobulin  <cit> . fcrl <dig> molecules are preferentially expressed by b cells  <cit> . fcrl <dig> possesses both tyrosine based activating and inhibitory motifs in its cytoplasmic tail, indicating these may be used to transmit immune-modulatory signals via tyrosine phorphorylation in regulating b cell differentiation and response  <cit> . the strongest evidence linking fcrl <dig> polymorphisms with autoimmunity is derived from linkage disequilibrium mapping of the chr1q21- <dig> region in rheumatoid arthritis, which identified  <dig> snps  in a japanese population  <cit> . of the  <dig> snps positively associated with rheumatoid arthritis, fcrl <dig> -169t>c  substitution substantially increased promoter activity in fcrl <dig> and enhanced binding affinity to the consensus nf-κβ binding motif, where nf-κβ widely regulates genes involved in immune response  <cit> . in addition, fcrl <dig> transcripts in peripheral b cells and genomic dna are higher in heterozygous individuals with genotype -169c/t +358c/g, and increased fcrl <dig> expression in synovial tissue and peripheral cd19+ b cell population suggest that higher expression of fcrl <dig> is potentially pathogenic  <cit> . further correlation of b cell abnormalities with fcrl <dig> expression is afforded by significant positive correlation of rheumatoid factor autoantibody titre in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis with the number of susceptible − <dig> c alleles  <cit> . however not all studies showed consistent association with polymorphisms in fcrl <dig>  specifically no discernible association with fcrl <dig> were noted in some other rheumatoid arthritis populations including caucasians in north american and european countries . when the susceptibility effect of fcrl <dig> was stratified by nf-κβ <dig> genotypes, association of fcrl <dig> polymorphisms with rheumatoid arthritis was observed in patients heterozygous for the nf-κβ <dig> promoter in a spanish population  <cit> .

the second gene of interest, dpysl <dig>  produces collapsin response mediator protein  <dig> . it was first described in the central nervous system as an effector cytosolic protein for semaphorin mediated axonal growth cones navigation during neural development and plasticity  <cit> . dysregulation of crmp <dig> phosphorylation and expression, have been associated with neuropsychiatric diseases including alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia  <cit> . crmp <dig> is also highly expressed in activated t lymphocytes from peripheral blood bearing cd <dig> and hla-dr markers. crmp <dig> is distributed in the trailing uropod in polarized t cells binding to cytoskeletal structures particularly to vimentin  <cit> . the observations of enhanced spontaneous and chemokine-directed t cell transmigration by induced expression of crmp <dig> in jurkat t cells, and high expression of crmp <dig> in migrating t cells suggest crmp <dig> may regulate t cell motility and migration  <cit> . the mechanism underlying crmp <dig> induced t cell migration seems to involve phosphorylation of crmp <dig> tyr- <dig> residue, acting as transducer for chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1α  signaling  <cit> . the discovery of crmp <dig> cellular function in t cells defines its potential role in the pathogenesis of immune mediated inflammation, specifically neuroinflammation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the pooled gwas is an effective methodology for detecting common genetic variants in gd. the study confirmed fcrl <dig> region as a susceptibility locus for gd in addition to mhc. a second locus downstream of dpysl <dig> is potentially a novel genetic variant in gd that requires further confirmation.
