BACKGROUND
plants are well known for their extraordinary capacity to regenerate whole organisms from somatic cells. they often retain plasticity and have the capability to reverse the differentiation process and change their fate. the remarkable plasticity of plant cells is well exemplified by the capability of differentiated leaf cells to retain totipotency, the ability of a single cell to develop into a new organism  <cit> . this process is known as somatic or asexual embryogenesis  whereby somatic cells differentiate into embryos and ultimately into plants via a series of characteristic morphological stages, particularly the later stages, which resemble the zygotic stages of development  <cit> . se is the developmental restructuring of somatic cells towards the embryogenic pathway and forms the basis of cellular totipotency in higher plants  <cit> . analyses of gene expression during somatic embryogenesis can provide information about the early stages of plant development  <cit> . large-scale transcription analyses of embryogenesis have also been reported in several species  <cit> . numerous genes have been identified as specifically expressed during somatic embryogenesis  <cit> . these genes include hormone responsive genes such as auxin inducible genes  <cit> , late embryo abundant genes  <cit> , calmodulin  <cit> , calcium dependent/calmodulin-independent protein kinases  <cit> , calmodulin-like protein kinases  <cit> , somatic embryogenesis receptor-like kinase  genes  <cit> , homeobox containing genes  <cit> ; chitinases  <cit> ; arabinogalactans  <cit> , lipid transfer proteins  <cit> , wuschel  <cit>  and leafy cotyledon genes  <cit> , to name a few. as yet little is known about the induction and maintenance process of the genes involved in the se processes, especially in the acquisition of totipotency of somatic cells. avivi et al. has shown that that acquisition of pluripotentiality involves changes in dna methylation pattern and reorganisation of specific chromosomal subdomains. these changes lead to activation of silent genes such as plant specific nac  genes and vip <dig>  a gene encoding b-zip nuclear protein that involved in acquisition or maintenance of pluripotentiality  <cit> . several researchers have sought to identify the very early plant cells in the explant cell population that are competent to be committed to differentiation pathways. using the serk gene as a marker during the examination of either carrot hypocotyls explants  <cit> , immature zygotic embryos of sunflower  <cit> , leaf explants of dactylis glomerata l.   <cit> , or developing ovules and embryos of arabidopsis  <cit> . serk gene is expressed early in a small sub-population of cells which are competent to form embryogenic cells  <cit> . over-expression of the atserk <dig> gene in arabidopsis cultures was shown to induce somatic embryo formation  <cit> . similarly, the over-expression of a transcription factor called baby boom  that shows similarity to the ap2/erepb multigene family of transcription factors  <cit>  under the control of the 35s promoter in transgenic plants induced ectopic spontaneous somatic embryos and cotyledon-like structures on arabidopsis and brassica seedlings. the bbm gene was originally isolated because it represented a gene that was expressed early in the initiation of the differentiation of embryo development from immature pollen grains of brassica napus  and appeared to be involved in the conversion from vegetative to embryonic growth  <cit> .

legumes in general have proven recalcitrant at de novo regeneration in vitro  <cit> . in medicago truncatula, leaf explants as well as protoplasts can form calli and subsequently the generation of embryos and then the development of plants  <cit> . depending on the plant system, auxin and/or cytokinin are required to enable embryogenesis to occur in culture  <cit> . in medicago truncatula, nolan et al. found that embryogenesis required both auxin and cytokinin addition, although some embryos could form on cytokinin alone  <cit> . in the leaf explant tissue culture system, there is an advantage of being able to manipulate the type of differentiating cells observed by changing the phytohormones added to the culturing media  <cit> , and embryos are initiated more rapidly in 4– <dig> weeks. this meristematic system has ideal attributes: the regenerative capacity of the mutant line 2ha, which is  <dig> fold more embryogenic than its isogenic line jemalong  <cit> . when both m. truncatula cultivar  jemalong and 2ha explant tissues are cultured in medium with addition of auxin and cytokinin, the 2ha explants form embryos. generally cv jemalong does not form embryos but does produce early vascularisation in the calli. the pasture legume m. truncatula  is one of the model systems for the analysis of the unique biological and fundamental processes governing legume biology. recent genomic tools, advanced dna sequencing programs, est libraries and medicago genechip® have been developed for this legume and we previously have established proteome reference maps for m. truncatula somatic embryogenesis cultures and compared the proteome of the super-embryogenic line 2ha with that of non-embryogenic progenitor jemalong  <cit> . in this study, we have used leaf explant tissue cultures of 2ha and jemalong to investigate gene expression profiles and their changes during the early stage of regeneration and to identify key regulatory factors and the early markers of cell competency for regeneration.

RESULTS
transcriptomic analysis of the super-embryogenic line 2ha and its progenitor jemalong
the m. truncatula line 2ha has a  <dig> fold greater capacity to regenerate plants in culture by somatic embryogenesis than its progenitor jemalong. figure  <dig> shows explant leaf tissue cultures of m. truncatula super-embryogenic seed line 2ha and its progenitor jemalong at day  <dig> and day  <dig>  they were grown on medium containing  <dig> μm naa and  <dig> μm bap. at two weeks, callus cells start to proliferate and there are no morphological differences can be seen between the 2ha and jemalong. thus, two weeks provides an early time point to compare proliferating cultures of these two lines. the first appearance of embryos in 2ha occurs after five weeks of culture, but not in jemalong  <cit> . to investigate gene expression profiles and their changes during the early stage of regeneration, we profiled and compared the transcriptomes of 2ha and jemalong, by extracting total rna from three independently grown two-week old cultures and analysing them on affymetrix medicago genome arrays. an average of 46%  of the over  <dig>  plant gene probe sets of the medicago genome array genechip produced 'present' calls when hybridised with biotin-labelled crna from m. truncatula tissue culture similar with early reports in root and leaf samples  <cit> . following normalisation with gcrma, we identified only  <dig> probe sets  that are at least  <dig>  fold over-expressed  in the super-embryogenic line 2ha and only  <dig> probe sets  that are over-expressed  in the non-embryogenic jemalong. the vast majority of probe sets  did not show any significant change between the cultures. the choice of 2-fold threshold is somewhat arbitrary but in combination with student t test and its associated p values, it is intended to emphasize on major changes. we also performed the significance analysis of microarrays  two-class unpaired analysis in order to identify a more extensive list of differentially expressed genes  <cit> . we found that  <dig> and  <dig> probes were up- or down-regulated respectively . there were significant similarities between 2-fold cut-off method and sam two-class unpaired analysis. one hundred ninety five probe sets were up-regulated in the embryogenic culture by both analyses while  <dig> probe sets were down-regulated . the full data set has been deposited in the gene expression omnibus database as accession gse <dig> and the normalised data set is available in the additional file  <dig> 

array verification
quantitative real-time rt-pcr was used to confirm the level of expression of  <dig> transcripts from the array . for all probe sets tested, the expression ratios displayed the same pattern of expression as the array normalised data but with amplified fold-changes. for instance, probe set mtr. <dig> .s1_at  showed down-regulation by real-time rt-pcr in the embryogenic culture, consistent with the array data. in average, the fold changes in rt-pcr data were approximately three times higher than that of array data indicating amplification of fold changes by sensitive real-time rt-pcr analysis. however, the fold changes were much closer to array un-normalised data  indicating normalisation may considerably reduce the signal differences. the functional significance of the transcripts validated by qrt-pcr is discussed in more details below.

these m. truncatula probe set ids are from the medicago genechip. gh, glycoside hydrolase ; rr, response regulator; agl <dig>  agamous-like 20; fpf, flower promoting factor; lipox, lipoxygenase; ein, ethylene-insensitive; mtn <dig>  m. truncatula nodulin <dig>  values shown are ratios of the means of three independent measurements from microarray data or real-time rt-pcr data. note the log <dig> changes are given rather than fold changes. standard deviations are given as ± values.

functional classification of differentially expressed probe sets
the medicago genome array does not incorporate the entire m. truncatula genome, it was created based on an incomplete genome sequence and ests from the medicago truncatula gene index . we have noted the inclusion of probe sets for imgag gene predictions and the corresponding est leading to a duplication of data, and the absence of some consensus ests from mtgi available at the time the chip was made and also incorrect annotation of some genes in both imgag and mtgi . annotation of the probe sets on the genome array also varies widely in quality. to interpret the gene expression data better, we have used genebins to provide hierarchical functional classification modelled on kegg ontology  <cit> . this analysis made it apparent that the metabolism seems to be different between the embryogenic and the non-embryogenic m. truncatula cultures . about 35% percent of differentially expressed probe sets could be assigned a functional classification with genebins; of note  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of transcripts differentially expressed are involved in carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites respectively. around 21% of differentially expressed transcripts have no homolog, however by far the largest class of probe sets that had significantly altered expression in our analysis were unclassified with a homolog . this result led us to use other bioinformatics strategies to annotate the probe sets on the genome array.

to further refine the functional classification and annotation of metabolic probe sets on the medicago genome array we used pathexpress  <cit> . using this database we were able to identify statistically significant over-representation of metabolic pathways in the embryogenic and non-embryogenic cultures as shown in table  <dig>  five metabolic pathways are significantly over-represented in the embryogenic cultures. they are:  sphingolipid  metabolism ;  stilbene, coumarine and lignin biosynthesis ;  flavonoid biosynthesis , flavonol 3-o-glucosyltransferase  and 3-ketoacyl-coa synthase  <dig> ;  riboflavin metabolism  and  biosynthesis of 12-, 14- and 16-membered macrolides . two pathways are over-represented in the non-embryogenic cultures. they are:  ascorbate and aldarate metabolism .  biosynthesis of 12-, 14- and 16-membered macrolides .

potential metabolic pathways significantly over-represented  amongst differentially expressed probe sets at  <dig>  fold as determined by pathexpress.

we also annotated the array by comparing the data set with the arabidopsis gene family information database maintained by the arabidopsis information resource  <cit> . as of april  <dig> the database contained  <dig> gene families and  <dig>  genes. using blast, we were able to classify  <dig>  medicago probe sets into these families. forty one and ten of the over expressed probe sets from the embryogenic and non-embryogenic cultures respectively were classified in the gene families. two cytochrome p <dig> families  were significantly over-represented in the non-embryogenic line jemalong . finally, transcription factors  on the genome array were predicted by homology relationship based on the database of arabidopsis transcription factors  <cit> . this analysis showed that  <dig>  probe sets on the genome array have sequence homology to described plant tfs. twenty one predicted tfs were up-regulated in the embryogenic line 2ha cultures and six tfs were up-regulated in the non-embryogenic jemalong cultures . the families represented in the embryogenic cultures are the basic/helix-loop-helix , zinc finger domain tfs c2c2-co-like and c2c2-dof, response regulators , gras domain containing tfs , mads-box tfs  and myb dna-binding domain tfs . the tf families represented in the non-embryogenic cultures are apetala  <dig> and ethylene-responsive element binding proteins , auxin-responsive protein/indoleacetic acid-induced protein  and ethylene insensitive  <dig> . with the exception of bhlh and zinc finger containing tfs, the tf gene families are plant specific. we confirmed the expression of several tfs betweens the cultures of two lines using qrt-pcr .

phytohormone biosynthesis and signalling
although genebins and pathexpress are valuable tools to identify gene classes and molecular pathways in general, they are not designed to identify plant specific pathways such as phytohormone biosynthesis and signalling. thus, we manually analysed the differentially displayed genes involved in these processes. we have identified two probe sets mtr. <dig> .s1_at & mtr. <dig> .s1_at that are homologues to arabidopsis ethylene insensitive <dig> . these two probe sets were down-regulated  <dig>  fold and  <dig>  fold respectively, in the embryogenic 2ha cultures. similarly, a probe set for ga2-oxidase   and a probe set  for an iaa/aux gene was down-regulated in the embryogenic 2ha cultures. in contrast, a response regulator  was up-regulated the embryogenic 2ha cultures. this was confirmed by real-time rt-pcr .

comparison of gene expression between the embryogenic cultures and seed development
to identify common genes expressed between embryogenic cultures  and developing seeds , we have compared our data to that from the medicago expression atlas  <cit> . we have chosen developing seeds at  <dig> days after pollination since this is the earliest time point available for seed development in the atlas and contrasted it to leaf. a total of  <dig>  probe sets showed differentially display between the developing seed at ten days after pollination and leaf samples. over  <dig>  probe sets were up-regulated in the developing seeds at least two fold , of which  <dig> were also up-regulated in the embryogenic cultures when compared to non-embryogenic cultures . these include a basic helix-loop-helix  transcription factor , mtrr <dig> , a putative phosphatase , an e1-e <dig> type atpase , a serine carboxypeptidase , a gdsl-motif lipase , a peroxidase , two nodulins , a fatty acid elongase  and four unknown proteins . over  <dig>  probe sets were down-regulated in the developing seeds at least two fold , of which  <dig> were also down-regulated in the embryogenic cultures when compared to non-embryogenic cultures . these include transcription factor eil <dig> , a h+-transporting atpase mtr. <dig> .s1_at), snakin-like cysteine rich protein , a patatin-like phospholipase , a thaumatin-like protein  and a hypothetical protein . in brief, we have identified a small number probe sets that were either up- or down-regulated in both the embryogenic cultures and the developing seeds. these include transcription factors such as response regulator mtrr <dig> and ein <dig>  nodulins and unknown proteins . further investigation of these proteins will shed light on the similarities between somatic and zygotic embryogenesis.

comparison between the array and proteomics
we also compared our array data with the proteome data obtained for the explant leaf cultures of 2ha and jemalong  <cit> .  <dig> protein spots were reportedly identified as differentially displayed proteins between the explant leaf cultures of 2ha and jemalong after  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> weeks of culture. although all of the corresponding genes were present on the array, none of them showed differential display when used  <dig> fold cut-off and student t test . thus, we were not able to find any correlation between transcriptomics and proteomics of the explant leaf cultures of 2ha and jemalong. this probably due to the fact that only a very limited number of differentially displayed proteins were identified by proteomics, most of which showed differential display only at the later stages of culture  but not at the early stage  at which this microarray analysis was focused on.

discussion
during the initial phases of organogenesis somatic cells progress through a series of events referred to as differentiation, competence acquisition, induction and determination  <cit> . most in vitro cultures require auxin in the medium to initiate these steps while sunflower immature zygotic embryos do not. they do, however require cytokinin to induce somatic embryogenesis  <cit> . working with immature zygotic embryos of sunflowers, thomas et al. showed that the time of exposure to a specific medium was fundamental to the commitment to a particular morphogenic pathway  <cit> . this period was described as embryogenic competence during the morphogenic induction. the period lasted for three days when the commitment could be reversed by changing the medium. however, after four days it could not be altered and thus an irreversible step was taken within the competent cells toward a particular organogenesis pathway. seven days of pre-treatment with auxin can interrupt somatic embryo formation in m. truncatula  <cit> . and at two weeks, the explant leaves start to proliferate. thus, we reasoned that comparing transcriptomes of two-week old tissue cultures of super-embryogenic 2ha and its non-embryogenic progenitor jemalong would reveal important genes involved in early steps of regeneration and acquiring totipotency. the transcriptomic analysis has revealed changes in gene expression between the super-embryogenic line and the non-embryogenic line of m. truncatula, although the vast majority of probe sets  did not show any significant change between the cultures. the differentially expressed genes include genes involved in various metabolic pathways, flavonoid biosynthesis, hormone biosynthesis and signalling and genes involved in gene regulation.

arabinogalactan proteins
we have identified five probe sets  belonging to beta-ig-h <dig> fasciclin-like arabinogalactan proteins  that are up-regulated in the embryogenic cultures of 2ha at least two fold. agps are implicated in diverse developmental roles including somatic embryogenesis  <cit>  although their exact functions remain unclear. agps containing n-acetylglucosamine can be a substrate for chitinase  <cit>  leading to the release of oligosaccharide signal molecules that are necessary to induce somatic embryo formation  <cit> . the involvement of extracellular signal molecules in somatic embryogenesis has been reported in several plant species. it was shown that when non-embryogenic cultures were treated with growth medium conditioned by super-embryogenic cultures, the cultures became embryogenic  <cit> . several components in the conditioned growth medium have been found to promote somatic embryogenesis. these components include chitinases  <cit>  and agps  <cit> . it has been suggested that oligosaccharides released from agps by a chitinase act as signal molecules stimulating somatic embryogenesis  <cit> . however, the role of agps in the induction of somatic embryogenesis in m. truncatula is not understood yet.

genes involved in transition from vegetative growth to reproductive growth
we have identified an arabidopsis ortholog of flowering promoting factor <dig>  that was  <dig>  fold up-regulated in 2ha . atfpf <dig> is one of the important genes involved in the genetic control of flowering time in arabidopsis. it is expressed in apical meristems immediately after photoperiodic induction of flowering in long-day plants, which flower only when exposed to long days  <cit> . during the transition to flowering, the fpf <dig> gene is expressed at the same time as leafy and earlier than apetala <dig>  two key unrelated tfs in flower initiation. fpf <dig> modulates the acquisition of competence to flower in the apical meristem. over-expression of fpf <dig> leads to early flowering in arabidopsis  <cit> . similar results were also reported in tobacco  <cit> . however in rice, it has been shown that it also plays a role in the initiation of adventitious roots  <cit>  and it has been reported that the same gene was induced by salt treatments in m. truncatula roots and may contribute to the reacquisition of root growth, notably through the emergence of lateral roots  <cit> . another flowering promoting gene that was up-regulated  in 2ha is agamous-like  <dig>  encodes a mads box tf. in arabidopsis, its ortholog was identified as a gene downstream of another mads box tf flc  <cit> . activation of agl <dig> causes early flowering despite strong expression of flc, and knock out of agl <dig> causes late flowering, suggesting that it is a flowering activator  <cit> . agl <dig> is positively regulated by the long day pathway through co, and negatively regulated by the autonomous/vernalisation pathway through flc  <cit> . since expression of agl <dig> is regulated by signals from more than one flowering pathway it is referred to as a floral pathway integrator  <cit> . these genes function in 'cascades' within four promotive pathways, the 'photoperiodic', 'autonomous', 'vernalisation', and 'gibberellin' pathways, which all converge on the 'integrator' genes agl <dig>  and flowering locus t   <cit> . it has been shown that flc directly interacts with the agl <dig> and ft genes in vivo  <cit> . probe set mtr. <dig> .s1_at was up-regulated in 2ha and encodes a constans-like tf that are ortholog of at1g <dig>  which displayed root-specific expression  <cit>  and are strongly repressed in n starvation  <cit>  suggesting biological functions beyond promoting flowering.

thus, we have identified three genes that were up-regulated in 2ha have similarities to the genes involved in transition from vegetative growth to reproductive growth, suggesting that initiation of both reproductive growth and regeneration share similar molecular processes.

nodulins
we identified eight genes classified as nodulins including early nodulin  <dig> , mtn3s , mtn <dig> , nodulin  <dig>  and other nodulins mtr. <dig> .s1_at & mtr. <dig> .s1_at). mtn <dig> protein contains mtn <dig> and saliva related transmembrane protein domain  and reported to be induced during nodulation in m. truncatula  <cit> . it has been shown in ascidian ciona intestinalis that a gene encoding an mtn3/saliva family transmembrane protein is essential for tissue differentiation during embryogenesis  <cit> . mtn <dig>  a homologue of plant defence proteins  has been reported to be nodulation/symbiosis-specific in m. truncatula  <cit> . nod <dig>  a member of plant aquaporins, also has been shown to be involved in nodulation  <cit> . another non-nodulin proteins that has shown to be involved in nodule development is cycloartenol synthase  <cit> . we have detected the same gene  highly up-regulated in the embryogenic line 2ha. these indicate that several genes expressed during nodule formation also expressed during regeneration in m. truncatula.

phytohormone biosynthesis and signalling
two probe sets mtr. <dig> .s1_at & mtr. <dig> .s1_at that are homologues to arabidopsis ethylene insensitive <dig>  were down-regulated  <dig>  fold and  <dig>  fold respectively, in the embryogenic line 2ha. the probe set mtr. <dig> .s1_at was also down-regulated in the developing seeds at  <dig> days after pollination when compared to leaf samples, indicating some similarities between somatic and zygotic embryogenesis. ein <dig> acts as a positive regulator at the most downstream position of the ethylene signal transduction pathway  <cit> . ein <dig> encodes a transcription factor that belongs to a small family that includes ein <dig> and various ein3-like  proteins in arabidopsis and it works downstream of ein <dig>  <cit>  and upstream of aterf <dig>  an early ethylene responsive gene  <cit> . recently, achard et al. has shown that activated ethylene signalling reduces bioactive gibberellin  levels and enhances the accumulation of dellas, and ethylene acts on dellas via the ctr1-dependent ethylene response pathway, most likely downstream of the transcriptional regulator ein <dig>  ethylene-enhanced della accumulation in turn delays flowering via repression of the floral meristem-identity genes leafy and agl <dig> , establishing a link between the ctr1/ein3-dependent ethylene and ga-della signalling pathways  <cit> .

we have observed that a probe set for ga2-oxidase   was up-regulated in the non-embryogenic jemalong cultures. ga has been implied to have an role in somatic embryogenesis in carrots  <cit> , in arabidopsis  <cit>  and in japanese cedar  <cit> . ga2ox, introduces a hydroxyl group at the 2β position, inactivating the ga molecule so that it cannot be converted into active forms  <cit> . these indicate that there is a reduction in active ga in this the non-embryogenic line jemalong. however, the measuring of active ga contents in these lines is required to confirm such indication. it has been shown in arabidopsis that agl <dig>  is induced by ga  <cit>  and we found agl <dig>  to be up-regulated in the embryogenic line 2ha. the up-regulation of agl <dig> correlates well with the up-regulation of ga2ox and down-regulation of ein <dig> in the embryogenic line. thus, our findings suggest that ga and ethylene may be involved in the acquisition of regeneration capacity in m. truncatula and indicate that agl <dig> may be a key regulator that links ga and ethylene signalling.

we have identified a probe set  for an iaa/aux gene that was down-regulated in the embryogenic cultures. the corresponding gene is an ortholog of arabidopsis iaa <dig> . in arabidopsis, iaa <dig> protein is long-lived and its longevity was not influenced by auxin suggesting they may play a novel role in auxin signalling  <cit> . we previously have shown that auxin  pre-incubation explant leaf tissues can irreversibly interrupt somatic embryo formation in the m. truncatula embryogenic line 2ha  <cit> . thus, up-regulation of iaa <dig> ortholog in m. truncatula supports motion that the prolonged auxin signalling may have adverse effect on embryo formation.

proliferation of undifferentiated callus tissue, greening, and the formation of shoot structures are all cytokinin-dependent processes. we have identified a response regulator  that is up-regulated in the embryogenic cultures. this probe set was also up-regulated in the developing seeds at  <dig> days after pollination when compared to leaf samples, indicating some similarities between somatic and zygotic embryogenesis. mtrr <dig> is an ortholog of arabidopsis arr <dig>  that belongs to b-type response regulators. it was reported that this gene is induced early in m. truncatula roots during the symbiotic interaction with sinorhizobium meliloti  <cit> . there are other probe sets for the genes involved in cytokinin biosynthesis and signalling. however, these were not changed between the two cultures. for instance, there are two probe sets for adenylate isopentenyltransferases  in the array and both probe sets did not expressed in both cultures. in contrast, cytokinin response  <dig>    <cit>  and other cytokinin inducible genes cyclin d <dig> , knat , shoot meristemless  and type a response regulators   were also highly expressed in both cultures. these indicate that there are some differences between the embryogenic line 2ha and the non-embryogenic line jemalong in respond to cytokinin and mtrr <dig> may be an important regulator in the acquisition of regeneration capacity in m. truncatula.

CONCLUSIONS
we have described differences in transcriptomes between the m. truncatula super-embryogenic line 2ha and its non-embryogenic progenitor jemalong. notably they include significant variations in carbon and flavonoid metabolism, phytohormone biosynthesis and signalling, cell to cell communication and gene regulation. this data will facilitate the mapping of regulatory and metabolic networks involved in the acquisition of regeneration capacity of the embryogenic lines such as 2ha, and may lead to a better understanding of totipotency in m. truncatula and other legume species.
