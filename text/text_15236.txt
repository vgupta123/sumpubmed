BACKGROUND
micrornas  are a group of single-stranded noncoding 21– <dig> nt rnas which are involved in diverse aspects of eukaryotic biology including reproduction, development, pathogenesis, cell proliferation, apoptosis and lipometabolism by pairing to mrnas which mainly results in target-specific post-transcriptional repression
 <cit> . recent research has demonstrated that mirnas are involved in the regulation of mammalian reproduction, especially the regulation of ovarian function
 <cit> . the dicer1-deficient mice which lost ~75% of dicer <dig> mrna expression demonstrated female infertility, and were predicted to reduce angiogenesis in the corpus luteum because of the loss of mir-17-5p and let-7b which regulate the expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1
 <cit> . when the mouse granulosa cells were treated with the human chorionic gonadotropin , the mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> expression were upregulated, and knockdown of these mirnas increased the expression of c-terminal binding protein  <dig>  in granulosa cells
 <cit> . ctbp <dig> was recently shown to regulate adrenal steroidogenesis, in conjunction with steroidogenic factor-1
 <cit> . additionally, massive parallel sequencing in the newborn mouse ovaries showed the expression of  <dig> known mirnas, among which the x-linked mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> family were found to be preferentially expressed in the testes and ovaries which play important roles in folliculogenesis and spermatogenesis, respectively
 <cit> .

pregnancy is a complex reproductive process, which is tightly regulated by various endocrine factors and a large number of genes. the ovaries play an important role during pregnancy. there are significant differences in the activity and endocrine characteristics of the ovary during pregnancy and non-pregnancy
 <cit> . in the non-pregnant phase, ovulation is normal and estrogen secretion dominates; whereas ovulation is temporarily suspended during pregnancy and progesterone secretion gradually increases to maintain pregnancy. in the present study, we characterized and investigated the differential expression of mirnas in the ovaries of pregnant and non-pregnant goats using deep sequencing technology. the result will help to further understand the role of mirnas in reproductive biological processes, including follicular development, hormone secretion, luteinization and the maintenance of pregnancy, and also may help to identify mirnas which could be potentially used to regulate hircine reproduction and breeding practice in the future.

RESULTS
overview of sequencing data
in order to identify differentially expressed mirnas in the ovaries of pregnant and non-pregnant goats, two small rna libraries were constructed by solexa sequencing. the results of  <dig>  million  and  <dig>  m total reads were obtained from the ovarian libraries of pregnant and non-pregnant goats, respectively. after removing the low quality and adaptor sequences, a total of  <dig>  m and  <dig>  m clean reads were ultimately obtained. subsequently, all identical sequence reads were classified as groups, and we obtained  <dig>  m and  <dig>  m unique sequences associated with individual sequence reads. the size distribution of the reads was similar between the two libraries . the majority of the small rnas were 21– <dig> nt in size. sequences  <dig> nt in length, the typical size of dicer-derived products
 <cit> , accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total sequence reads in the pregnant and non-pregnant ovarian libraries. the composition of the rna classes in each library is shown in figure 
 <dig> and additional file
 <dig>  conserved mirnas accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total sequence reads , and  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the unique sequence reads  in the pregnant and non-pregnant small rna libraries, respectively. the rrna, trna, snrna, snorna and repeat dna total accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total sequence reads, and  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the unique sequence reads in the pregnant and non-pregnant libraries, respectively . a total of  <dig> and  <dig> conserved mirnas and mirna*s  were identified in the pregnant and non-pregnant libraries, respectively . after grouping the identical sequences, a total of  <dig> unique mirnas and mirna*s were obtained from both libraries. the highest fraction of unique reads  was attributed to unannotated sequences . these sequences were not mapped to any known reference databases. similar to those of mirnas, the major unannotated sequences were 20– <dig> nt in size. however, a considerable part of the unannotated sequences were concentrated in 15– <dig> and 23– <dig> nt in size , indicating a potential role of these small rnas in hircine ovaries. these results indicated that the small rna libraries were highly enriched in mirna sequences, and that there was also a less abundant, but much more diverse, class of small rnas which may represent other classes of small non-coding rnas , consistent with the previous studies
 <cit> .

conserved micrornas and microrna*s
to identify conserved mirnas in hircine ovaries, the dataset was compared to the known mammalian mirnas  in mirbase  <dig>  . a total of  <dig> and  <dig> unique sequences in the non-pregnant and pregnant libraries were mapped to known mammalian mirnas in mirbase  <dig> , respectively. considering one or two mismatches between sequences,  <dig> and  <dig> conserved mirnas were identified in the non-pregnant and pregnant libraries, respectively.

furthermore,  <dig> mirna*s were obtained in the non-pregnant library, of which  <dig> duplex-like mirna: mirna* pairs were identified, and  <dig> mirna*s in the pregnant library, of which  <dig> duplex-like mirna: mirna* pairs were identified. the expression levels of the majority mirna*s were lower than the corresponding mirnas. for example, the read counts of mir-21* in the non-pregnant and pregnant libraries were  <dig> and  <dig>  compared to the read counts of  <dig> and  <dig> for mir- <dig>  respectively. however, the expression levels of some mirna*s were significantly higher than the corresponding mirnas, such as mir-199b*, suggesting that mir-199b* functions during hircine ovarian development
 <cit> . some mirna*s and the corresponding mirnas were generated at similar levels in both libraries, such as mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  .

identification of putative mirnas
though the substantial goat genome sequence data is currently short, it is feasible to identify putative mirnas by means of alignment with goat expressed sequence tags . two goat putative mirnas with a total of  <dig> read counts, and five goat putative mirnas with a total of  <dig> read counts were predicted in pregnant and non-pregnant libraries. the rna stem loop structures and the positions of the reads were shown in additional file
 <dig> and additional file
4: figure s <dig>  these seven putative mirnas were not analyzed further, as their expression levels were too low in the two small rna libraries.

differential expression of mirnas in the ovaries of pregnant and non-pregnant goats
as shown in figure 
3a, b and additional file
 <dig>   <dig> of  <dig> unique mirnas  were co-expressed in both libraries, and  <dig>  and  <dig>  of these mirnas appeared to be preferentially expressed in the pregnant and non-pregnant libraries, respectively. analysis of the sequencing data resulted in the identification of  <dig> unique mirnas  which were significantly differentially expressed in different libraries. of these  <dig> unique mirnas,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique mirnas were up-and downregulated in the pregnant library, respectively, compared to the non-pregnant library.

as shown in figure 
4a and b, the ten most highly expressed mirnas in the non-pregnant library were all downregulated in the pregnant library, and of the ten most highly expressed mirnas in the pregnant library, six mirnas  and four mirnas  were down- and upregulated in the non-pregnant library, respectively. moreover, eight members of the let- <dig> family  were all identified in both libraries as show in figure 
 <dig>  these differential expression patterns of highly expressed mirnas during pregnancy and non-pregnancy suggested that these mirnas may be closely related to hircine ovarian development and function
 <cit> .

mirna target prediction
mir- <dig>  the most highly expressed mirna in the pregnant library , was predicted to bind the target sequences and repress expression of the frizzled- <dig> and - <dig> receptor genes , which may affect the classical wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, indicating that mir- <dig> might play an important role in luteinization, progesterone secretion and the maintenance of pregnancy. in addition, let-7b, the most highly expressed mirna in non-pregnant library , may target the activin receptor i and smad 2/ <dig> genes in the tgf-beta signaling pathway , and affect mammalian gonadal development, placentation and embryonic differentiation.

validation of hircine mirnas
the expression levels of  <dig> randomly selected mirnas were determined in the ovaries of pregnant and non-pregnant goats using q-pcr. mir- <dig> was significantly upregulated in the pregnant hircine ovaries compared to the non-pregnant ovaries . mir-34b, mir- <dig>  let-7a and mir- <dig> were all significantly downregulated in the pregnant hircine ovaries compared to the non-pregnant ovaries . these expression patterns were consistent with the solexa sequencing results .

discussion
goats are one of the important economical animals, as they provide high-quality wool, meat and other products. however, hircine fecundity is relatively low, and this is a major constraint which prevents the development of the goat industry. fecundity is a low heritability trait and conventional selection only supports slow improvement. therefore, new methods to improve hircine fertility are highly desirable
 <cit> . molecular assisted breeding technology has been successfully used in the goat breeding industry, and the resource population of high fecundity of anhui white goats was created successfully by our research group. in this study, we sequenced the small rnas in the ovarian tissues of pregnant and non-pregnant anhui white goats using illumina solexa technology to identify ovary-specific and differentially expressed mirnas. over eighty percent of known conserved mammalian mirnas were found to be expressed in the ovaries of pregnant and non-pregnant goats .

as the complete goat genome sequence has not yet been published, and goat-specific mirnas are not recorded in the mirbase  <dig>  database
 <cit> , we can currently only research hircine mirnas using the mirna sequences of closely related species , or using goat est sequences and unigene information. although  <dig> conserved mirnas were found to be expressed in hircine ovaries using blastn in the study, the identification was highly dependent on the quantity and quality of the data in mirbase  <dig> . q-pcr was preformed to analyze the expression of  <dig> selected differentially expressed mirnas in pregnant and non-pregnant hircine ovaries, and the results were consistent with the solexa sequencing data. in theory, the expression levels of each candidate mirna need to be validated using q-pcr; therefore, the  <dig> mirnas identified in this study can only be regarded as a hircine ovary-specific mirna reference dataset, and further research should be performed to validate the expression of mirnas of interest in a larger number of samples. on the other hand, only one sample per group  was sequenced in this study, so no expression variances within the groups and intro-species could be estimated. to overcome this deficiency, we will add 1- <dig> samples in each physio-stage, or add samples with these conditions  in the future, to make the library a complete process of pregnancy. furthermore, we predicted  <dig> putative mirnas using the goat est database; however, the expression levels of these mirnas in the libraries were very low. this discrepancy is due to the shortage of goat est sequence information in the genbank database, and is consistent with the previous studies
 <cit> . with continual improvements in goat genome sequence information, we will be able to obtain richer, more accurate data on hircine mirnas.

in the view of the different ovarian activity and endocrine function in pregnant and non-pregnant goats, differentially expressed mirnas were identified in the ovaries of pregnant and non-pregnant goats which enabled to analyze the relationship between hircine mirnas and reproductive traits such as follicular development, hormone secretion, luteinization and pregnancy maintenance. we identified  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas which were specifically expressed in the ovaries of pregnant and non-pregnant goats, respectively. some mirnas which were not expressed in the ovaries of non-pregnant goats were expressed during pregnancy . mirnas usually regulate protein expression by binding to and repressing translation or promoting the degradation of their target mrnas
 <cit> . the present study indicated that upregulation of mirnas in the ovaries of pregnant goats may inhibit the expression of target genes associated with follicular development, ovulation and estrogen secretion; thereby inhibiting ovulation and estrogen secretion. on the contrary, downregulation of other mirnas in the ovaries of pregnant goats may relieve the repression of target genes associated with luteinization, progesterone secretion and pregnancy maintenance; thereby promoting luteinization and progesterone secretion.

although much research has been performed on mirnas in the gonads of pigs, cattle and other mammals, research of goat ovarian mirnas has seldom been reported. in previous, mir- <dig> was found to be the most highly expressed mirna in the testis and ovaries of holstein cows, and  <dig> putative mirna target genes involved in the gnrh-signaling and insulin-signaling pathways, which are associated with endocrine system function, were also identified
 <cit> . interestingly, in the study, mir- <dig> was also found to be the most highly expressed mirna in the ovaries of pregnant goats . target prediction indicated that mir- <dig> may bind to the frizzled- <dig> and - <dig> receptor genes in the wnt signaling pathway, thereby affecting the binding of wnt- <dig> to its receptor . moreover, previous studies have suggested that the wnt- <dig> gene, one of the most important members of the wnt family, may regulate the function of ovarian granulosa cells and luteal cells by binding to specific members of the frizzled receptor family
 <cit> . therefore, mir- <dig> may play an important role in reproduction, such as mammalian gonadal endocrine function and pregnancy maintenance. other studies have also shown that mir- <dig> promotes normal adipocyte differentiation and fat deposition
 <cit> , indicating that mir- <dig> may play an important role in normal mammalian physical development, as well as mammalian reproduction.

it is a challenge to verify the complex functions of mirnas. in the previous studies, mir- <dig> exerted an anti-apoptotic effect during the transformation of ovarian granulosa cells into luteal cells, and repression of mir- <dig> expression induced granulosa cell apoptosis and significantly reduced the rate of ovulation, via a mechanism dependent on luteinizing hormone secretion
 <cit> . also, mir- <dig> was demonstrated to express at significantly higher levels in the ovaries of holstein cows compared to the testis , indicating that mir- <dig> may play an important role in ovarian function
 <cit> . interestingly, the present study also showed that mir- <dig> was significantly upregulated in pregnant goat ovaries, compared to non-pregnant goat ovaries . increased lh secretion after becoming pregnant, followed by upregulation of mir- <dig> expression, may contribute to the transformation of ovarian granulosa cells into luteal cells. and the mechanisms regulating the anti-apoptotic effects of mir- <dig> in ovarian granulosa cells still need to be investigated further
 <cit> .

recent research has indicated that specific members of the let- <dig> family can affect mammalian reproduction, development, cell proliferation and apoptosis
 <cit> . in the present study, eight members of the let- <dig> family  were expressed at high levels in both libraries, and let-7b was the most highly expressed mirna in the ovaries of non-pregnant goats . bioinformatics analysis indicated that let-7b may bind to the activin receptor i and smad2/ <dig> genes in the tgf-beta signaling pathway, and may affect follicular development and estrogen secretion .

CONCLUSIONS
mirna expression patterns vary in the ovaries of pregnant and non-pregnant goats. in total,  <dig> conserved and  <dig> putative mirnas were detected, and  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas were identified in pregnant and non-pregnant ovaries, suggesting that mirnas may play an important role in the regulation of goat ovarian function. for example, mirna- <dig> was strongly associated with reproduction, and may potentially regulate the wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway by targeting frizzled- <dig> and - <dig>  let-7b may regulate the tgf-beta signaling pathway by targeting the activin receptor І and smad2/ <dig>  future work to characterize the expression of ovarian mirnas at different stages of reproduction and in different breeds of goat, or in specific cell lines derived from ovarian tissues, is necessary to fully elucidate the functions of mirnas in goat follicular development and hormone secretion, which will help to understand the relationships between mirnas and mammalian reproduction, while enhancing the development of artificial reproduction and marker assisted selection  techniques in goats.
