BACKGROUND
tuberculosis is an infectious disease of enormous global importance. it is estimated that about one third of the human population is latently infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis with  <dig>  million people dying annually from the disease  <cit> . the currently employed tuberculosis vaccine, mycobacterium bovis bacille calmette-guérin  was originally derived from a virulent strain of m. bovis back to  <dig>  by repeated passages on potato slices soaked in glycerol-ox byle. the primary attenuation is attributed to loss of rd <dig> locus, which affects a protein secretion pathway  <cit> . subsequent propagation of bcg in several laboratories around the world resulted in further in vitro evolution, which is still ongoing. genetic alterations are mainly due to deletions and duplications  <cit> , although single nucleotide polymorphisms  have also been described  <cit> . the various genetic alterations – some presumably involving reca-mediated recombination – affect the antigenic, protective, and metabolic properties of bcg. thus, the term bcg does not refer to an entity but comprises a set of different substrains. since the early sixties, freeze dried and lyophilized secondary seed lots are used as source of commercially available vaccine strains. who vaccine production guidelines  <cit>  call for fresh cultures from secondary seed lots and propose not to exceed twelve passages from the primary seed lot. these recommendations have been modified recently, suggesting not to exceed four passages as phenotypic alterations were observed in vaccine batches undergoing as little as twelve subcultivations  <cit> .

RESULTS
generation of reca knock-out strains
to establish bcg as a vector for stable heterologous antigen expression we intended to stabilize the genome of four bcg substrains representing different phylogenetic lineages by deletion of reca. a reca phenotype is desirable for live mycobacterial vaccines as homologous recombination is an important contributor of genomic evolution  <cit> . we constructed a replacement vector  carrying an unmarked, inactive deletion of the reca allele. in this vector, a hygromycin resistance cassette and the counterselectable marker sacb were cloned downstream of the reca allele. transformation of this kind of vector allows generation of allelic replacement mutants by two subsequent selection steps. in a first step, transformants that have integrated the knock-out plasmid into the bacterial chromosome are selected on hygromycin b containing media. integration of the vector by homologous recombination, i. e. 3' or 5' of the genomic reca, is revealed by southern blot analyses. in a second step, sucrose-selection is used to select for mutants that have undergone a second intramolecular recombination resulting either in inactivation of the reca gene or in reversion to wild-type.

most of the transformants obtained in substrains pasteur, frappier, and denmark resulted from homologous integration of the targeting vector  at the reca locus . subsequent counter-selection of clones arising from homologous recombination events readily resulted in reca deletion mutants as demonstrated by southern blot analyses. in striking contrast, all transformants  of substrain russia resulted from illegitimate recombination . southern blot analysis shows a virtually at random integration of the suicide knock-out plasmid containing the inactivated reca in substrain russia. the presence of a  <dig> -kb fragment corresponding to the original reca and the presence of a second fragment of varying size indicates non-homologous illegitimate recombination.

genomic reca sequence
the absence of marker integration by homologous recombination prompted us to examine the genomic reca sequence in bcg russia in comparison to the annotated sequence of bcg pasteur 1173p <dig>  <cit> . we found a single insertional mutation  <dig> bp from the reca start , which leads to a translational frameshift and a premature stop codon at amino acid position  <dig> in the major central reca domain . the truncated reca has a length of  <dig> instead of  <dig> amino acids and lacks the complete c-terminal part of the protein including loops l <dig>  and l <dig>  implicated in dna binding  <cit> . bcg frappier, denmark, and pasteur reca were identical with the annotated reference sequence encoding a functional reca.

reca expression at the protein level
bacteria respond to dna-damage by coordinated expression of a multitude of genes involved in repair and control of cell division – the sos response  <cit> . the sos response was induced by addition of the dna-damaging agent mitomycin c  to a bcg culture, followed by incubation for an additional  <dig> hours  <cit> . western blot analysis using a polyclonal mouse α-reca antibody demonstrated induction of reca in strain bcg pasteur, but absence and failure of induction of reca in bcg russia . a genetically engineered bcg pasteur reca mutant  was used as a negative control.

discussion
replication errors, transpositions and recombination events contribute to genetic alterations and drive genome evolution. for bcg various differences in morphology, growth rate, protein expression and genetic make-up have been noted among commercially available substrains  <cit> . this is presumably a result of the numerous serial passages on natural  and artificial media, which have led to the acquisition of genomic alterations and further attenuation. of note, meta-analyses of bcg vaccination trials have indicated protective efficacies ranging from 0–80%. a correlation between the number of serial in vitro passages and the decrease in protective efficacy has been observed  <cit> . several reasons have been put forward to explain the varying protective efficacies of bcg, among others genetic differences between vaccine substrains as well as within an individual substrain  <cit> . more recently it has been suggested that the protective efficacy of ancient vaccine strains charcterized by few regions of difference  may be superior to that of the later ones that are more widely used  <cit> . we have added the newly identified single nucleotide polymorphism to an existent phylogenetic tree. it will be of interest to see whether reca is functional in other ancient strains . sequencing of reca may also help to clarifiy the uncertain origin of the two subcultures of bcg japan  <cit> .

the reca-family recombinases have a central role in dna repair, restoration of stalled replication forks, induction of sos response, mutagenesis and homologous recombination  <cit> . in e. coli, reca is involved in several homologous recombination pathways, where it promotes the central steps, i.e. aligning and pairing two dna molecules, and then promoting a strand switch followed by branch migration  <cit> . reca is both ubiquitous and highly conserved among a range of organisms, but variations of the prototypic e. coli paradigm exist. reca of pathogenic mycobacteria  but not of non-pathogenic mycobacteria  is interrupted by an in-frame open reading frame encoding an intein  <cit> . reca intein is removed from the precursor reca by an autocatalytic protein splicing reaction and active reca, which can complement a m. smegmatis reca mutant  <cit>  is generated by ligation of amino- and carboxy terminal fragments mediated by intein. m. tuberculosis reca activity differs from e. coli reca activity with respect to single strand dna-dependent atp-hydrolysis, co-factor requirement and ph-optimum  <cit> . homologous recombination in m. tuberculosis complex is sometimes masked by a high degree of illegitimate recombination in certain experiments  <cit> . the high degree of illegitimate recombination has been attributed to the unusual structure of reca  <cit> . alternatively, the high degree of illegitimate recombination may be due to the absence of a mismatch repair system  <cit> , which has anti-recombination activity  <cit> . however, homologous recombination essentially depends on reca as demonstrated in a gene conversion assay in a m. bovis bcg reca mutant  <cit> . of note a homologue of e. coli rect, a protein functionally overlapping reca, is missing in m. tuberculosis  <cit> . likewise, other recombination genes are also absent from the m. tuberculosis genome   <cit> .

comparative genomics indicate that recombination events are a major driving force of bacterial evolution  <cit> . there is extensive evidence for large-scale rearrangements, duplications and deletions resulting from homologous recombination in m. leprae  <cit> , m. tuberculosis  <cit>  and m. bovis bcg  <cit> . half of the proteins present in the tubercle bacillus originate from gene duplications  <cit> . tandem duplications are generally caused by unequal crossover between homologous sequences or by recombination of short dna homologies. homologous recombination between similar sequences may invert or delete genes. several deletions in the m. tuberculosis h37rv genome resulted from recombination between adjacent repeats of is <dig> elements  <cit> . sometimes, the molecular mechanisms underlying alterations at particular loci remain obscure and subsequent alterations may mask initial events, e.g. tandem duplication of the du <dig> region in m. bovis bcg pasteur arose from duplication of a  <dig> kb genomic segment that subsequently incurred an internal deletion of  <dig> kb  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
comparative genome and transcriptome analyses indicate that bcg russia is an ancient bcg strain most closely related to the original strain attenuated by calmette and guérin  <cit> . however, a key piece of the puzzle was missing. what was the molecular mechanism underlying the high degree of genome conservation in bcg russia? here, analysis of the reca locus provides a possible clue. reca, which is the key element of homologous recombination and a driving force in mycobacterial genome evolution but which is not mandatory for conferring protection of bcg in animal models of tuberculosis  <cit> , is disrupted by single nucleotide insertion in bcg russia. this mutation results in a frameshift and premature translational stop and most probably contributed to the genome stability of this substrain of bcg. of note genome stability of the obligate endosymbionts of aphids, buchnera aphidicola, is also associated with lack of reca  <cit> .
