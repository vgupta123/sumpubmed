BACKGROUND
in order to spatially separate the vast number of divergent reactions carried out by intracellular enzymes, eukaryotic cells are compartmentalized into several membrane-bound organelles. among these organelles, the lysosomal compartment contains more than  <dig> hydrolases required for degradation of macromolecules or even whole organelles entering the lysosome by endocytotic or autophagic pathways  <cit>  .

this degradation process and thus the hydrolases involved are essential for the cell as reflected by the manifestation of severe diseases which are characterized by the accumulation of undigested substrates in the lysosome due to the lack of hydrolytic enzyme activities. the associated pathogenic phenotypes are collectively referred to as "lysosomal storage disorders" . however, the lysosomal compartment does not only serve as a digestive compartment but also plays a key role in many other cellular processes like modulation of peptide hormones and bioactive lipids, tissue homeostasis, inflammation  <cit>  as well as neuroprotection  <cit> . furthermore, lysosomes are involved in the pathogenesis of alzheimer disease  <cit> , autoimmune diseases and in the initiation and progression of cancer  <cit> .

recently, several proteome studies of the lysosomal compartment have identified a considerable set of novel lysosomal proteins. most of these sub-proteomic studies took advantage of a specific carbohydrate modification of newly synthesized soluble lysosomal proteins, the mannose 6-phosphate residue   <cit>  as reviewed in  <cit> . in vivo, m6p-containing proteins are recognized by mannose 6-phosphate receptors  at the trans-golgi network  and transported to endosomes, in which the receptor-ligand complex dissociates due to the acidic ph. finally, the m6p-containing proteins are delivered to lysosomes, while the mprs return to the tgn. in most lysosomal sub-proteome analyses, m6p-containing proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on immobilized mprs and subsequently analysed by mass spectrometry based techniques.

one novel protein that was identified in tissues derived from mouse, rat and human was referred to as hypothetical  <dig>  kda protein  <cit> .

subsequently, the murine  <dig>  kda protein  <cit>  and its human ortholog p <dig>  <cit>  were characterized in more detail regarding their lysosomal localization, processing and glycosylation status. the maturation of the orthologs from mouse and human includes both, limited proteolysis and the usage of all five or six potential n-glycosylation sites. the murine  <dig>  kda protein is synthesized as glycosylated preproprotein of about  <dig> kda in apparent molecular mass. after the co-translational removal of the n-terminal signal peptide, the remaining proprotein is sorted to the lysosomal compartment and matures into a  <dig> kda n-terminal fragment and a  <dig> kda c-terminal fragment  <cit> . a similar processing was described for the human ortholog p <dig> resulting in a  <dig> kda n-terminal fragment and a  <dig> kda c-terminal fragment  <cit> . the same authors suggested an additional maturation step for the  <dig> kda fragment from mouse into a c-terminal  <dig> kda fragment. such a limited proteolysis in the endosomal/lysosomal compartment is a common hallmark of lysosomal hydrolases and a prerequisite to their hydrolytic activation  <cit> . these proteins are commonly synthesized as preproenzymes. the signal sequence is removed during their synthesis into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum resulting in the corresponding proenzymes. these precursors are most often processed by limited proteolysis in late endosomes or lysosomes and thus converted into their hydrolytically active forms. by this kind of processing, an activity of the enzyme at the site of translation – within the endoplasmic reticulum -, which might harm cellular components, is prevented.

the  <dig>  kda protein is conserved among vertebrates and shows homology to the lamina ancestor precursor of drosophila melanogaster  <cit>  , the ribonuclease p protein subunit p <dig> of entamoeba histolytica  <cit>  , phospholipase b from dictyostelium discoideum  <cit>   as well as to the highly glycosylated integral membrane protein p <dig> from trypanosoma brucei   <cit> . the trypanosomal protein p <dig> has recently been demonstrated to be essential for maintenance of normal lysosomal structure and physiology in bloodstream-stage cells  <cit> . in contrast, no homologous proteins have been found in yeast and prokaryotes.

neither bioinformatics analysis nor the detailed characterization of the mouse lysosomal  <dig>  kda protein and its human ortholog p <dig> have provided any hint regarding the activity and the physiological function. recently, we determined the three-dimensional structure of the mouse  <dig>  kda protein  <cit> . here we report three structures of the  <dig>  kda protein that represent different maturation states of the post-translational processing. by limited proteolysis, a  <dig> kda and a  <dig> kda fragment are derived. they stay associated forming a compact entity, and the c-terminus of the  <dig> kda fragment is further trimmed. the obtained results were substantiated by mass spectrometric analysis. furthermore, the  <dig>  kda protein could be assigned to the superfamily of n-terminal nucleophile  hydrolases. despite the lack of a significant sequence similarity there is a close resemblance to several bacterial hydrolases regarding the protein fold and residues forming the catalytic centre. additionally, a detailed comparison of the three crystal structures of the  <dig>  kda protein reported in this work with the homologous structures provides initial insight into its catalytic activity and suggests a mechanism of the enzyme's activation by autocatalytic proteolysis.

methods
data collection and structure determination
the glycosylated  <dig>  kda protein from mouse was produced by overexpression in the human fibrosarcoma cell line ht <dig> and purified as described  <cit>  except for some minor modifications that are summarized below. since the  <dig>  kda protein and its proteolytic  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda fragments could not be separated by affinity and ion exchange chromatography and gel filtration, the mixture containing all three polypeptide chains was used for crystallization. the protein was crystallized under acidic conditions, and the structure was solved at  <dig>  Å by means of sulphur sad phasing using long wavelength radiation  <cit> . the three data sets described in the following had been collected prior to the sulphur sad experiment. at a shorter wavelength , a data set was collected from the same crystal that was used for the sulphur sad  on the bessy beamline bl- <dig> , which was equipped with an sx <dig> detector , and processed with hkl <dig> . two additional data sets had been collected previously from a native crystal  and from a crystal soaked with potassium iodide . the original purification protocol, which was used for the protein batches leading to the native and ki soaked crystals, was lacking a gel filtration. this final step was only applied for the protein preparation used for the sad phasing and the determination of the structure 3fgr.

the crystal, on which the native data set was collected, was grown under the previously described conditions  <cit> , whereas the crystal for the ki data set was obtained under slightly different conditions. instead of tris/hcl ph  <dig>   <cit> , the concentrated protein was dissolved in a buffer system of sodium chloride and sodium phosphate buffer ph  <dig> . furthermore, the crystallization drop was composed of  <dig>  μl of protein solution  and reservoir each  peg  <dig>   <dig> mm naac/hac ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm nh4ac). thus, the final salt concentration was slightly reduced by about 19% and tris was exchanged by a phosphate buffer system.

the data sets "native" and "ki" were collected on the desy beamline x <dig> , which was equipped with a marccd <dig> detector , and on the bessy beamline bl- <dig>   on a marmosaic <dig> detector , respectively. the images were integrated with xds  <cit>  and mosflm  <cit> , respectively, and scaled using scala of the ccp <dig> program suite  <cit> . the iodide soaked crystal severely suffered from radiation damage. however, a 97% complete data set with a reasonable r factor of rp.i.m. =  <dig> % could be obtained. the three structures derived from the different data sets were solved by means of molecular replacement with molrep  <cit>  using the  <dig>  Å structure of the  <dig>  kda protein  as a search model  <cit> . the  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å structures were manually completed by cycling between refmac <dig> of the ccp <dig> program suite and coot  <cit> , while cns  <cit>  and coot were used for the  <dig>  Å structure. data collection and refinement statistics for the three structures are summarized in table  <dig> 

structure analysis
four structures of the  <dig>  kda protein were refined and were deposited within the protein databank. the structure 3fbx has been solved by sad and is published elsewhere  <cit> . this work describes structures of the cleaved forms 3fgr  and 3fgt  as well as of the "uncleaved form" 3fgw .

the final  <dig>  Å structure of crystal form i  includes  <dig> amino acid residues. while v63-t <dig> and g245-s <dig> belong to the polypeptide chain a, c249-p <dig> form the continuous chain b. additionally, five n-glycans are included in the final structure. two n-acetylglucosamine  moieties are linked to n <dig> and n <dig> each, while only one nag moiety each could be placed at n <dig>  n <dig> and n <dig>  one xenon atom that had been caught in a hydrophobic pocket during a soak in a xenon gas chamber  <cit>  and one sodium ion as well as two acetate anions from the crystallization buffer and eleven glycerol molecules from the cryo protecting solution are included in the solvent model. siocs  was used for prediction of the amide/imidazole orientations of asparagine, glutamine and histidine side chains. the final structure was refined to r factors of rwork =  <dig> % and rfree =  <dig> % with a fom of  <dig> . the stereochemical analysis of the refined structure with procheck  <cit>  detected two proline residues  as well as one aspartate residue  to exhibit a cis peptide conformation and six residues with torsion angles outside the expected ramachandran regions .

in contrast to the structure 3fgr, the native  <dig>  Å structure  comprises three additional residues at the n-terminus  and one extra residue in the intermediate region of the sequence, namely n <dig>  but lacks four amino acids at the c-terminus of chain a . chain b contains the same residues as in 3fgr resulting in altogether  <dig> amino acids in 3fgt . four nag moieties are attached to the residues n <dig> , n <dig>  and n <dig> , respectively. three acetate anions as well as five glycerol, one triethylene glycol and two tetraethylene glycol molecules are included in the solvent model.

the structure derived from the ki derivative crystal  includes the residues p61-n <dig> and g245-d <dig>  in contrast to 3fgr, g245-s <dig> are connected to c <dig>  the structure 3fgw contains five nag moieties and one mannose  moiety . furthermore, the solvent model comprises three glycerol molecules, seven iodide anions and one sodium ion.

the n-terminal amino acids l <dig> – p59/d60/p <dig> , n239/t <dig>  – l244/s <dig>  as well as the c-terminal residues ) and the eleven residues of the c-terminal affinity tag ) are missing due to the lack of unambiguously interpretable electron density. however, the residues n239-s <dig> and n239-s <dig>  respectively, which are located in a functionally important region, have been shown to be belonging to the  <dig> kda fragment by means of mass spectrometry as outlined below.

superpositions for the determination of root mean square deviations  between two structures as well as for graphical comparison were performed with the program superpose of the ccp <dig> program suite using the superposition of specified atoms if possible  and secondary structure matching for less related structures . for superposition with the about  <dig> amino acids containing enzymes pva and cbah, only chain b of the  <dig>  kda protein was used , while the whole molecule served as the reference for the larger structures of cephalosporin acylase  and penicillin g acylase  . the differences between the three structures that concern four loops of the  <dig> kda fragment connecting the β-strands β <dig> and β <dig>  β <dig> and β <dig>  β <dig> and α <dig>  and α-helices α <dig> and α <dig>  respectively, are based on distinct intermolecular crystal contacts with symmetry equivalent protein molecules, in which the loops are involved. calculations of the electrostatic surface potential were performed with delphi  <dig>   <cit> .

in-gel digestion of the  <dig>  kda protein and the processed fragments and mass spectrometry 
the purified  <dig>  kda protein was incubated under crystallization conditions  and treated with n-glycosidase f   according to the protocol.  <dig> μg non-treated and pngase treated samples were separated by 1d page  and proteins were coomassie stained . visible bands were cut out and proteins were in-gel digested with endoproteinase trypsin according to  <cit> . peptides were extracted and analyzed by liquid chromatography  coupled tandem mass spectrometry  on an orbitrap xl  under standard conditions, i.e. collision induced dissociation  in the linear ion trap . ms and ms/ms product ion spectra were searched against ncbinr database containing the full-length fasta sequence of the  <dig>  kda protein and both processed fragments, i.e. the n-terminal  <dig> kda and the c-terminal  <dig> kda fragment, using mascot as search engine. ms and ms/ms spectra were further manually evaluated for tryptic peptides derived from pngase treated sample harbouring the c-terminus of the n-terminal  <dig> kda fragment and eventually shortened versions .

RESULTS
structure determination
the glycosylated lysosomal  <dig>  kda protein from mouse was produced and purified as described  <cit> . two crystal forms were obtained under acidic conditions close to the physiological ph of the lysosomal compartment. the crystal form ii was obtained under slightly different conditions concerning the composition of the protein and the reservoir solution. both crystal forms belong to space group c <dig> and contain one molecule in the asymmetric unit but they differ in their cell parameters c and β. the  <dig>  Å structure of the  <dig>  kda protein, which includes the residues 63– <dig> and 249– <dig> , was previously obtained by means of sulphur sad phasing  <cit>  and revealed that the  <dig> kda n-terminal and the  <dig> kda c-terminal fragments of the processed  <dig>  kda protein still form one globular entity. the crystal structure refined to a resolution of  <dig>  Å using another data set collected on the same crystal allowed to place four additional residues in the intermediate protein region between the two fragments, namely g245-s <dig>  that turned out to be functionally important.

in the course of solving the crystallographic phase problem, further data sets were collected which turned out to be of interest as they represent different states of the maturation process of the  <dig>  kda protein. diffraction data from a native crystal with a resolution limit of  <dig>  Å  and from a non-isomorphous, potassium iodide soaked crystal  were analyzed in detail. the crystal structures described here were solved by means of molecular replacement using the initial structure of the  <dig>  kda protein . while the protein monomers are arranged in a head-to-tail like manner in crystal form i , two symmetry equivalent molecules form contacts head-to-head with each other in crystal form ii . data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in table  <dig> 

the final structure 3fgr with the highest resolution of the three described structures, contains  <dig> residues of the n-terminal  <dig> kda fragment and  <dig> residues of the c-terminal  <dig> kda fragment  . the n-terminal amino acids l47-p <dig>  n239-l <dig> as well as the last c-terminal residues  are disordered in the structure 3fgr. however, it comprises the residues g245-s <dig>  which could not be built in the initial structure . by means of mass spectrometry, the residue range l47-s246/s <dig> has been shown to be present in the  <dig> kda fragment as discussed in detail further below . the average temperature factors of only  <dig>  Å <dig> and  <dig>  Å <dig> for the amino acids of chains a and b, respectively, indicate an overall well defined conformation of the  <dig>  kda protein structure.

non-interpreted electron density was found at the sulfhydryl group of c <dig>  which is the n-terminal cysteine of the  <dig> kda fragment. this sulfhydryl group appears to be partially oxidized  which could be a consequence of the fact that the  <dig>  kda protein was purified and crystallized in the absence of a reducing agent. c <dig> was modeled as cysteine sulfonic acid . the oxidized side chain of this n-terminal cysteine is involved in the octahedral coordination of a cation, which is additionally bound by the side chains of s <dig>  e <dig>  t <dig> and y <dig> as well as by the main chain carbonyl group of d <dig>  so far, the nature of this metal ion is not known. since sodium acetate was present in the crystallization buffer and due to the absence of a peak in the anomalous electron density maps calculated with diffraction data sets collected at a wavelength of  <dig>  Å,  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å as well as the results of fluorescence scans , it seems likely that a na+ cation is bound to the protein. this is further supported by the octahedral coordination and metal-ligand atom distances of  <dig>  –  <dig>  Å  <cit> .

in contrast to the structure 3fgr, in 3fgw, the amino acids g245-s <dig> are directly connected to c <dig> and the sulfhydryl group of c <dig> is not oxidized. . the coordination of a sodium cation at a position equivalent to 3fgr involves the same amino acids except for the replacement of ocs <dig> and s <dig> with only a single ligand, namely the main chain carbonyl group of g <dig>  as outlined for the structure 3fgr, the nature of the metal cation is not known but it is assumed to be a na+ ion.

the structure 3fgt contains the residues d60-n <dig> of the n-terminal  <dig> kda fragment and the residues c249-p <dig> of the c-terminal  <dig> kda fragment . as observed in the high resolution structure, the n-terminal cysteine  <dig> of chain b of the structure 3fgt seems to be partially oxidized. likewise, the same residues as in 3fgr except for the main chain carbonyl of g <dig> substituting s <dig> are involved in the coordination of the putative na+ ion .

overall structure
the structures 3fgr and 3fgt contain the cleaved form of the  <dig>  kda protein, which comprises two polypeptide chains corresponding to the  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda proteolytic fragments . if not stated otherwise, the structure 3fgr is described in detail below, since it has been refined at the highest resolution.

the compact globular structure shows two closely associated polypeptide chains  forming  <dig> hydrogen bonds as well as two salt bridges  . the existence of the  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda chains as one entity is in accordance with the observation that both fragments as well as the uncleaved  <dig>  kda protein elute in a single  <dig> nm absorption peak from the affinity column, anion exchange column and gel filtration column during protein purification, respectively. the gel filtration peak corresponds to an apparent molecular weight of about  <dig> kda indicating the existence of the  <dig>  kda protein as a stable dimer in solution. contact areas between symmetry equivalent molecules in the crystals were analyzed with pisa  <cit> . in accordance with the results from the gel filtration, the calculated complexation significance score suggests the existence of a stable homodimer.

the n-terminal  <dig> kda fragment consists of six α-helices  and four β-strands . the  <dig> kda c-terminal fragment contains  <dig> β-strands , seven α-helices  as well as six 3/10-helices . both fragments together form an αββα fold. the core is dominated by two highly twisted β-sheets. the six-stranded β-sheet  is packed tightly against an extended eleven-stranded β-sheet  . the α- and 3/10-helices form two layers  that flank the central β-sheets on both sides engulfing them like a horseshoe and thus leaving one side of the β-sheet solvent accessible.

most strands of the stacked β-sheets forming the central core derive from the  <dig> kda fragment . they are slightly tilted against each other with β-strands β <dig>  β <dig>  β14–β <dig> forming β-sheet i with the topology β14–β5–β6–β15–β16–β <dig> and β7–β <dig> in combination with β1–β <dig> of the  <dig> kda fragment that build β-sheet ii with the topology β2–β1–β3–β4–β7–β8–β9–β10–β11–β12–β <dig> . all β-strands are oriented in an anti-parallel fashion except for a break at β <dig>  which is oriented parallel to the preceding β <dig>  the β-strands β <dig> and β <dig> partially protrude from the globular structure. stabilization is achieved by some additional hydrophobic interactions, which are mainly formed between the α-helices α <dig> and α <dig> and β-strands β <dig> and β <dig>  additionally, two intramolecular disulfide bridges are formed between c <dig> and c <dig> of the n- as well as between c <dig> and c <dig> of the c-terminal fragment . in contrast, intermolecular disulfide bonds are not observed which is in accordance with the electrophoretic separation of the fragments under non-reducing conditions  <cit> .

the crystal structure contains seven n-acetylglucosamine moieties  in total, which are part of five n-glycans at the asparagine residues  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and are well defined in the electron density map. the glycosylation sites are evenly distributed on the surface of the molecule. the three n-glycosylation sites of the  <dig> kda fragment surround a prominent cavity – the putative substrate binding pocket – in close proximity, while the remaining two sites are localized on the opposing side of the protein molecule .

differences between the three structures of the  <dig>  kda protein
superposition of the three refined structures of the  <dig>  kda protein reveals only slight variations in the overall conformation. the r.m.s. deviations between the structures 3fgt and 3fgw compared to 3fgr amount to  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å for  <dig> common cα atoms , respectively. the most significant difference concerns the peptide bond connecting residues s <dig> and c <dig>  while in 3fgr and 3fgt there is no covalent bond between s <dig> and c <dig>  continuous electron density was observed between these residues in 3fgw indicating the uncleaved form of the protein . upon cleavage, the conformation of s <dig> and c <dig> changes significantly. the incision causes a rearrangement of s <dig> leading to an extensive hydrogen bonding network which includes a salt bridge formed between the terminal carboxyl group of s <dig> and the side chain of r <dig> .

in the uncleaved structure , c <dig> falls into the disallowed region of the ramachandran plot and exhibits cis configuration, while after cleavage it is trans and located in the core region of the ramachandran plot corresponding to β-strand conformation. in analogy to other auto-proteolytically cleaved enzymes  <cit> , this strong distortion most likely helps in providing the potential required for the proteolytic cleavage . the cleavage is additionally accompanied by slight changes of the torsion angles of the adjacent residue s <dig>  which is within the allowed region of a left-handed α-helix before and in the core β-strand region of the ramachandran plot after the cleavage .

the proximate residues n239/t <dig> – l <dig> of the linker peptide are flexible in all three structures. due to significant radiation damage occurring during data collection, the crystals were not suitable for further experiments. however, mass spectrometric analysis  was performed with purified  <dig>  kda protein incubated under crystallization conditions. this experiment unambiguously showed that the residues n239/t <dig> – l <dig> are present in the  <dig> kda fragment of the cleaved protein forms represented by 3fgr and 3fgt as follows .

in order to determine the exact c-terminus of the  <dig> kda fragment derived from processed  <dig>  kda protein, purified  <dig>  kda protein was incubated under crystallization conditions  with n-gylcosidase f . pngase cleaves all types of asparagine linked n-glycans and thus transforms the respective asparagine into aspartate residues within glycosylated proteins upon complete deglycosylation  <cit> . additional file 2: figure s2a shows the separation of the purified  <dig>  kda protein on a 1d sds-page before  and after pngase treatment . ms after in-gel digestion of the coomassie stained peptides showed that band  <dig> contains the full length protein, while band  <dig> represents the processed  <dig> kda fragment  and band  <dig> the processed  <dig> kda fragment. the fuzzy staining of protein and its fragment is caused by the glycosylation on various asparagine residues  <cit> . after pngase treatment the corresponding bands are much sharper, and indeed the processed  <dig> kda fragment appears as doublet . band  <dig> contains the  <dig> kda fragment. to detect the c-terminus of the latter fragment by ms, we manually inspected the generated ms and ms/ms spectra for peptides with the calculated mass  of the c-terminal tryptic peptide  or for c-terminal tryptic peptides that lack one or more c-terminal amino acids. figure s <dig> shows annotated ms  and ms/ms spectra from a peptide found in the ms analysis that encompasses the intact c-terminus tntkpslgsgs  and a shorter peptide with the sequence tntkpslgs  found in the same analysis . the ms/ms spectra clearly show a y-type ion series that unambiguously reveals the sequence of the peptides. the mass deviation of the calculated and experimentally determined mass of both peptides is ≤  <dig> ppm. however we could not identify a peptide which only lacks one c-terminal residue , i.e. tntkpslgsg . furthermore, we could not monitor any fragments shorter than the truncated one. in summary, the ms analysis proofs that under crystallization conditions the processed  <dig> kda fragment comprises residues l47-s <dig>  and also occurs as a slightly shorter form truncated at the c-terminus by two amino acid residues, i.e. containing the residues l47-s <dig> .

based on these observations, we assume that the processing step which gives rise to the  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda fragments starts with a cleavage between s <dig> and c <dig>  according to the mass spectrometric results, the  <dig> kda fragment which is derived after the proteolytic cleavage between s <dig> and c <dig> occurs in two species represented by the structures 3fgr  and 3fgt , respectively. due to the absence of the last two c-terminal residues g <dig> and s <dig> in the shorter version of the  <dig> kda fragment, the linker peptide probably cannot interact with the side chain of r <dig> anymore. thus, we assume the structure 3fgt to represent the shorter version of the  <dig> kda fragment including l47-s <dig> with the residues t240-s <dig> completely disordered.

the amino acids g <dig> – s <dig> exhibit an ordered conformation in the structures 3fgr and 3fgw . interestingly, the loop residues g245-s <dig> adopt quite different conformations in 3fgr and 3fgw . in 3fgr the residues g <dig> – s <dig> are oriented perpendicular to the first β-strand of the  <dig> kda fragment , whereas they extend this β-strand in 3fgw, even though the β-strand secondary structure is significantly distorted. due to the disorder of the residues t240-s <dig> in 3fgt a large pocket with a highly negative surface potential becomes solvent accessible . this cavity emerged to have a putative important role for the function of the  <dig>  kda protein as is described below.

structurally related proteins
in order to obtain insight into the function of the lysosomal  <dig>  kda protein, the protein data bank  was searched for structurally related proteins with known function. the retrieval using the program dali  <cit>  revealed significant similarities to cephalosporin acylase   <cit>  , two different kinds of penicillin acylase   <cit>  and v   <cit> ), as well as conjugated bile acid hydrolase   <cit>  . for these four bacterial proteins the number of the structurally equivalent residues is in the range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with regard to  <dig> amino acids of the  <dig>  kda protein. the r.m.s. deviations for the positions of aligned cα atoms amount to  <dig>  Å  –  <dig>  Å . furthermore, some less similarity was found to inosine monophosphate  cyclohydrolase   <cit>  and proteasome subunits  <cit>  . interestingly, only a few of the aligned residues are conserved between the  <dig>  kda protein and the structurally related proteins. merely 6%  to 14%  of the structurally equivalent amino acids are identical. superpositions of the  <dig>  kda protein with ca and cbah as representives are shown in figure  <dig> and in additional file 5: figure s <dig>  superposition of linker residues and ligands of the  <dig>  kda protein, cephalosporin acylase  and conjugated bile acid hydrolase . all structures exhibit the akin central overall fold with the highest degree of similarity concerning the β-sheet core, while the arrangement of the surrounding α-helices differs.

only hits with a z-score ≥  <dig> and with an assigned cellular function are listed here. a complete list of all revealed similar structures can be found in additional file 4: table s <dig>  extended list of structures with a similar fold as the  <dig>  kda protein revealed using the program dali.

* for redundant protein, the pdb-id and the corresponding values are given only for the best hit. z-score = value for comparison. hits with z-scores ≤  <dig> are spurious. rmsd = root mean square deviation between the aligned residues, lali: number of structurally equivalent residues, nres: number of amino acids in the protein, % id: percentage of identical amino acids over all structurally equivalent residues.

although most of the acylases lack significant sequence similarity among each other, they belong to a single superfamily termed ntn hydrolase, which is defined by a common fold. the characteristic structural motif is a four-layered αββα sandwich  <cit>  . based on the crystal structure, the  <dig>  kda protein could be assigned to this superfamily.

the pdb contains the crystal structure of another lysosomal ntn hydrolase, namely that of aspartylglucosaminidase   <cit> . however, this enzyme has not been revealed by dali, and secondary structure matching for the c-terminal fragment only allowed the alignment of  <dig> residues with r.m.s. deviations of  <dig>  Å.

putative active site
based on structural homology, the lysosomal  <dig>  kda protein belongs to the superfamily of ntn hydrolases. all functional ntn hydrolases known so far are activated by autocatalytic cleavage. the n-terminal residue generated at the cleavage site represents the canonical catalytic residue and performs a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the non-peptide amide bond of the substrate. the catalytically essential nucleophile is either threonine, serine or cysteine . while the hydroxyl oxygen or the sulphur atom of the n-terminal residue acts as the nucleophile, its free α-amino group serves as the general base. based on the superposition of the  <dig>  kda protein with known ntn hydrolases , we suggest c <dig> at the n-terminus of the  <dig> kda fragment to represent the conserved nucleophilic residue. c <dig> becomes solvent accessible only after the proteolytic cleavage between s <dig> and c <dig> and as soon as the c-terminus of the n-terminally located linker peptide is trimmed and thus becomes flexible probably moving to the surface of the protein as can be seen by comparison of the structures 3fgr and 3fgt .

in addition, other known active site residues of ntn hydrolases are conserved like an asparagine and an arginine residue . these residues corresponding to n <dig> and r <dig> of the  <dig>  kda protein have been shown to be essential in other ntn hydrolases, e.g. for the catalytic activity of pga   <cit> . in 3fgr, the od atom of the asparagine is hydrogen-bonded to the amino group of the n-terminal nucleophilic amino acid as well as to the side chain of the arginine as observed in all four ntn hydrolase structures closely related to the  <dig>  kda protein . the nd of the asparagine forms hydrogen bonds with both a backbone carbonyl oxygen of a residue located nearby  and – in the crystal structures 3fgr and 3fgt – with the sulfonic acid side chain of the oxidized n-terminal cysteine  <dig> 

another residue conserved in the active site of ntn hydrolases is either a histidine or an arginine corresponding to h <dig> of the  <dig>  kda protein . a histidine occupies this position in some ntn hydrolases which exhibit an n-terminal cysteine as the nucleophilic residue like the  <dig>  kda protein such as glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate  amidotransferase  <cit>  and glucosamine 6-phosphate synthase  <cit> . due to the acidic lysosomal environment h <dig> is protonated and therefore able to take over the role of the arginine. the positively charged histidine side chain most likely enhances the nucleophilic character of the catalytic n-terminal amino acid by decreasing its pka value. thus, the histidine/arginine conservation is most likely based rather on the catalytic mechanism than on substrate specificity.

the backbone nitrogen of t <dig> and nd <dig> of n <dig> most likely form the oxyanion hole in the  <dig>  kda protein. a third residue appears to be involved as well, namely w <dig>  like the structural equivalents, the backbone nitrogen of w <dig> forms a hydrogen bond with the n-terminal nucleophile. the corresponding residues qβ <dig> of pga and h <dig> of ca form a second hydrogen bond to the n-terminal amino group or od of the conserved active site asparagine, respectively, via their side chains. mutation of h <dig> to serine completely abolished autoproteolysis showing this residue to have an important role not only for the catalytic turnover of a substrate, but also for the activation of ca. w <dig> is not able to form equivalent interactions. based on this difference, we suggest w <dig> to be important for the catalytic activity but not essential for its autoproteolytic activation.

thus, all active site residues as well as characteristic hydrogen bonding patterns of the ntn hydrolases cbah, ca, pva and pga are conserved in the  <dig>  kda protein  suggesting that the same reaction mechanism is applied to hydrolyze a non-peptide amide bond. in contrast, several amino acids involved in substrate binding do not have functional equivalents, but this lack of sequence conservation concerning the binding site is not surprising and has been observed for almost all members of the ntn hydrolase superfamily  <cit> . it reflects the wide variety of substrate molecules despite the similar active site structure. polar side chains in proximity to the catalytic center suitable for interactions with a putative substrate molecule are delivered by s <dig>  t <dig>  n <dig> and t <dig> of the  <dig>  kda protein.

putative substrates
so far, the substrates of the  <dig>  kda protein remain unknown. the members of the ntn hydrolase superfamily differ significantly in substrate specificity and in the respective substrate binding pocket. however, the structural classification of the  <dig>  kda protein as an ntn hydrolase implies a hydrolytic activity on a kind of non-peptide amide bond as commonly observed for ntn hydrolases. based on the high similarity to members of the choloylglycine hydrolase family , the  <dig>  kda protein might have an enzymatic function related to that of other lysosomal members of this family such as acid ceramidase  and the nae-hydrolyzing acid amidase . according to this hypothesis, the  <dig>  kda protein could be involved in the degradation of n-acylethanolamines  of specific chain lengths leading to 2-aminoethanol  and the corresponding free fatty acids.

naes represent a class of tissue hormones  that are synthesized in a variety of organisms and tissues  <cit>  . in mammalia, naes normally occur in trace amounts, but under pathological conditions tissue nae levels increase significantly  <cit> . anti-inflammatory  <cit> , neuroprotective  <cit> , immunosuppressive  <cit>  and analgesic  <cit>  functions have been determined for various naes. thus, their spread has to be strictly regulated.

the choloylglycine hydrolase naaa is involved in the degradation of naes in lysosomes  <cit>  . in contrast, the two further known lysosomal members of this family, aspartylglucosaminidase  and acid ceramidase   <cit>  hydrolyse the n-glycosidic bond between oligosaccharides and asparagines and act on the amide bond of ceramides, respectively.

the best substrate of naaa, which shows optimal activity at acidic ph, is n-palmitoyl-ea. a second nae-degrading enzyme specific for a different set of naes differing in chain length and particularly in the saturation status of the fatty acid moieties is the fatty acid amide hydrolase   <cit> . this membrane-bound enzyme of the er and/or golgi compartment is most active at neutral ph  <cit> . in contrast to naaa, faah does not belong to the ntn hydrolase superfamily, but to the amidase signature family.

however, enzyme degrading all other kinds of naes such as n-stearoyl- , n-γ-linolenoyl- , and some longer fatty acid eas  have not been identified so far. hence, the  <dig>  kda protein could be involved in the hydrolysis of one or several of these compounds.

activation by auto-proteolytic removal of the linker peptide
activation of ntn hydrolases requires an auto-proteolytic cleavage resulting in the removal of several amino acids or even a whole polypeptide chain n-terminal of the nucleophilic residue. ca which exhibits the most significant structural similarity to the  <dig>  kda protein is activated by a multi-step maturation process leading to a two chain form of the protein  <cit> . during this maturation, two proteolytic cleavages cause the release of a spacer peptide, which makes the substrate binding pocket solvent accessible. the lysosomal  <dig>  kda protein bears such a highly flexible linker region most likely comprising the amino acids n <dig> to s <dig>  which connect the  <dig> kda fragment and the  <dig> kda fragment prior to maturation .

most known ntn hydrolases  <cit>  as well as inteins  <cit>  contain a glycine residue adjacent to the nucleophilic amino acid on the n-terminal side. however, in the  <dig>  kda protein, a serine residue  is located at the equivalent position and similar exceptions have been found in the lysosomal ntn hydrolase aga   <cit>  as well as in plant asparaginases  <cit> . however, in the  <dig>  kda protein, a glycine residue is located two amino acids apart from the catalytic c <dig> with a serine residue in between. n-terminal of this glycine  <dig> another glycine-serine pair  probably further increases the flexibility of the linker peptide. in the structure 3fgw, the linker residue range from g <dig> to s <dig>  which is still covalently bound to c <dig>  exhibits a strongly distorted conformation with the scissile peptide bond between s <dig> and c <dig> in cis conformation. upon the first proteolytic cleavage , the strained conformation is released, as becomes obvious in the structure 3fgr , in which all peptide bonds of the defined part of the linker exhibit trans conformation. these results are in agreement with similar observations regarding the autoproteolytic activation process of lysosomal aga.

for ca, a second autocatalytic cleavage releasing a spacer peptide has been reported that requires e <dig>  <cit> . the superposition of ca and the  <dig>  kda protein shows the side chain carboxyl groups of e <dig> and e <dig>  respectively, to be located similarly. however, they belong to non-equivalent β-strands, and a residue feasible to form the oxyanion hole for a putative second autoproteolytic cleavage between t <dig> and n <dig> in the  <dig>  kda protein could not be identified. upon cleavage between s <dig> and c <dig>  the c-terminal residues probably protrude from the protein making them accessible for successive removal. thus, we suggest the c-terminus of the  <dig> kda fragment  to be trimmed by proteases which are quite abundant in the lysosomal compartment rather than to be released by a second autocatalytic step. in vivo, the n-glycan attached to n <dig>  which was shown to be included in the mature  <dig> kda fragment  <cit> , should protect the  <dig> kda fragment against further c-terminal degradation. the crystallized protein had not reached the lysosomal compartment due to a capacity overload of the mpr-mediated transport system, but was secreted by exocytosis as a precursor. therefore, the requirement of lysosomal enzymes for the later steps of maturation as reported for the lysosomal ntn hydrolase aga  <cit>  are also in agreement with the presence of amino acid residues c-terminal of the glycosylated n <dig> in the crystal structures . by means of mass spectrometric analysis of the purified  <dig>  kda protein, s <dig> and s <dig>  respectively, have been identified as the c-terminal residue of two occurring variations of the  <dig> kda fragment. the exact length of the linker might not have any effect on the acylase activity as reported for ca from different pseudomonas species for which variations from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids occur  <cit> . however, most likely full access to the putative catalytic site arranged around c <dig> as observed in the structure 3fgt is only provided after trimming of the c-terminus of the  <dig> kda fragment.

CONCLUSIONS
three crystal structures of the lysosomal  <dig>  kda protein from mouse were determined  representing different states of its post-translational processing that gives rise to a  <dig> kda n- and a  <dig> kda c-terminal fragment. the structures shed light on this maturation procedure, which includes an autocatalytic cleavage. additionally, they provide initial insight into the so far unknown function of the  <dig>  kda protein.

the major difference between the three structures concerns a linker peptide of about ten amino acids n-terminal of c <dig>  in the uncleaved  <dig>  kda protein form, s <dig> is still covalently connected to c <dig>  and occupies a large cavity. during maturation, the peptide backbone is incised between s <dig> and c <dig> . in the cleaved  <dig>  kda protein form 3fgr, s <dig> still occupies a large cavity. subsequently, the linker region seems to become highly flexible due to further trimming of the c-terminus of the  <dig> kda fragment by two residues and might move to the surface of the protein. thus, a deep pocket becomes accessible for the binding of putative substrates .

the structures of the  <dig>  kda protein reveal significant similarities to several bacterial acylases, which belong to the n-terminal nucleophile  hydrolase superfamily. based on this structural homology including both the overall fold and the active site residues, the  <dig>  kda protein could be assigned to the superfamily of ntn hydrolases – a classification which could not have been derived from the amino acid sequence due to the lack of a respective homology.

commonly, ntn hydrolases act on non-peptide amide bonds. thus, molecules exhibiting a non-peptide amid bond most likely serve as substrates of the  <dig>  kda protein. the potential target molecules comprise n-acylethanolamines . the lysosomal compartment plays a major role in the regulation of the nae level in the cell, but the degradation of the entire set of the various naes cannot be explained completely by the action of the enzymes naaa and faah, which so far have been shown to be involved. certainly, this hypothesis has to be confirmed by further biochemical studies. currently, a gene trap knockout mouse is under construction and might help to evaluate the physiological function of the  <dig>  kda protein.

alternatively, other non-peptide amide bonds seem to be suitable substrates of the  <dig>  kda protein. they occur only in few natural compounds such as lipid-anchored proteins, sphingosines and acetylated lysine residues, and the  <dig>  kda protein might be involved in their degradation. while enzymes responsible for the degradation of farnesylated and geranylated proteins or peptides arising from lipid-modified proteins have been identified, an activity for the demyristoylation of proteins within lysosomes is only speculative at present as reviewed in  <cit> . acetylated lysine residues are beyond others found in the basic charged n-terminal region of histones  <cit> , which have important roles in the organization of the dna structure in eukaryotic cells and are crucial for the regulation of gene expression  <cit> . in contrast to the already characterized regulatory histone deacylases  the  <dig>  kda protein might remove the acetyl moiety from the proteins in the course of protein degradation.
