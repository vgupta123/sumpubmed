BACKGROUND
pollen of the common ragweed  is a main cause of allergic diseases in northern america  <cit> . this species is the most widespread ambrosia and the weed has become spreading as a neophyte in europe, and will become a serious health problem in sensitized populations  <cit> . the distribution of ragweed in europe began approximately 100 years ago and is currently primarily found in the rhône valley, hungary, croatia, bulgaria, northern italy and eastern austria, but it is also spreading in germany  <cit>  .

so far, the allergenic proteins of ragweed can be arranged into six biological groups  <cit> . approximately  <dig> allergenic proteins are known for the genus ambrosia, and  <dig> proteins, including multiple isoforms, are known for a. artemisiifolia . the major allergen of ragweed is amb a  <dig>  an acidic non-glycosylated 38-kda protein consisting of a 26-kda α-chain and an associated 12-kda β-chain  <cit> .

it is hypothesized that climate change and air pollution will affect the allergenic potential of pollen, either by a changed pollen season, by a changed pollen amount, by changes of the surface exine or by directly increasing the allergenic transcripts and proteins and interactions with biologically important ligands, e.g., flavonoids  <cit> . studies on effects on climate change on respiratory allergy are still lacking and only a few epidemiological reports on urbanization and air-pollution on pollen allergenicity are available  <cit> . an overview for risk factors on allergic disease discussing genetics aspects, indoor and outdoor pollution, socio-economic factors, climate change and migration has recently been published  <cit> . the proteomic profiling of birch pollen isolated from different sites indicated differences between allergenic and non-allergenic proteins  <cit> . in contrast, birch pollen isolated from an urban and rural site showed no difference in allergenic protein expression, indicating that allergenicity is determined by additional allergen carriers  <cit> . an in vivo study on birch pollen also sampled from different sites could correlate elevated ozone levels to higher allergenicity as well as to an increased allergen content  <cit> . it was recently shown that twice ambient ozone levels resulted in an increased content of allergenic proteins in two rye cultivars  <cit> . in ragweed, elevated ozone fumigation resulted in a changed transcriptional profile, including transcripts for allergenic proteins  <cit> . elevated co <dig> concentrations showed an increase growth of ragweed and its pollen production  <cit> , and an increased content of amb a  <dig> allergen was observed  <cit> .

in addition to increasing co <dig> concentrations, future atmospheric warming, as well as hot and dry summer periods are also expected  <cit> ; ippc report  <dig>  regulatory networks in cellular responses to drought, including abscisic acid-dependent and -independent systems, are well known during plant growth and development  <cit> . regarding transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of pollen, literature reports have focused on different developmental stages of pollen, mature pollen and pollen germination  <cit> . regarding temperature effects, differentially cold-regulated genes were detected in mature pollen of arabidopsis thaliana <cit> .

flavonoids are ubiquitous plant secondary metabolites and are important in plant development and reproduction, as well as in protection against abiotic and biotic stress factors  <cit> . the yellow color of pollen can be traced back to flavonoids, thus shielding the pollen genome from uv-b radiation  <cit> . in addition, flavonoids play a role in male fertility, and quercetin is an important germination-inducing compound in maize and petunia but not in arabidopsis or parsley  <cit> . flavonoids may be involved in the modulation of immune responses and thus may also be important in the allergenic response of pollen  <cit> . in human health, ige-binding of allergens may be influenced by attached flavonoids  <cit> . the pathogenesis-related proteins  consist of a large group of homologous proteins in different plant species and many prs are expressed in pollen and can act as allergens  <cit> . a direct interaction of birch pr-10c with biologically important molecules, including flavonoids, was shown by koistinen et al.  <cit> . similarly, flavonoids bind to the major birch allergen bet v  <dig>  <cit> , which also belongs to the pr- <dig> family  <cit> . recently it was shown, that a quercetin derivative directly binds to the c-terminal helix of bet v  <dig>  and that this binding plays an important role during the inflammation response  <cit> . these results indicate that, in addition to allergenic proteins, additional allergenic carriers may also be involved in pollen allergenicity, which is not exclusively triggered by known allergenic proteins  <cit> .

these studies suggest that global change will affect the allergenic potential of pollen and play a role in human health diseases related to allergic rhinitis and asthma. from this perspective, a transcriptome-wide analysis of the highly allergic pollen of ragweed would not only help in understanding climate impact on expressed pollen transcripts but also gain a deeper insight into the expected changes of pollen allergens. flavonoids analysis will allow a better understanding of their possible function as additional allergenic carriers and also contribute to the relevant uv-b-absorbing metabolites of pollen. in a previous study, we showed that twice the ambient level of ozone resulted in a changed transcriptional profile of ragweed pollen, including encoded allergenic proteins  <cit> . in this study, we modified the global climate change approach by linking the transcriptional network changes of ragweed pollen to elevated co <dig> concentrations and an extreme drought event. we highlight that the global change scenarios will affect the transcriptome of pollen and will also increase the abundance of allergen-related transcripts relevant for human health.

RESULTS
morphological parameters and pollen viability
two main different leaf morphologies between the plants were observed: plants with strong pinnate leaves  and plants with only weak pinnate leaves , as has been reported for ragweed with the same genetic background in exposure chambers  <cit> .

pollen viability was slightly reduced under elevated co <dig> levels; however, this result was not statistically significant . similarly, it was shown that the pollen performance decreased in raphanus sativus in response to elevated co <dig> levels  <cit> . drought stress resulted in a reduction of the pollen viability from approximately 46% to 24% . the decreased pollen viability under drought stress is in accordance with several literature reports also demonstrating a reduced viability and pollen grain production  <cit> . interestingly, this drought effect could be partially mitigated by elevated co <dig> with a slight increase from 24% to 30% , indicating no additive effects of elevated co <dig> and drought.

secondary metabolites
typical reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography  diagrams for water soluble metabolite extracts revealed  <dig> compounds, with the highest amounts in particular for metabolite  <dig> and  <dig>  both are quercetin derivatives and methanolic extracts showed  <dig> different metabolites, congruent to data given by kanter et al.  <cit>  . the total amounts of individual compounds for the final harvest are given in figure  <dig>  no significant changes could be observed between the control, elevated co <dig>  drought and elevated co <dig> plus drought samples, similar to what has been described for ozone-treated pollen. however, individual metabolites of the pbs extract showed increased levels upon drought stress at both co <dig> concentrations  and da <dig> . this change in individual metabolites is in contrast to pollen of ozone-fumigated ragweed that showed no change of such individual metabolites. flavonoids have been shown to accumulate under drought stress in several plants, thus playing a physiological role in water tolerance and protection against oxidative stress  <cit> . moreover, detailed analyses showed that the level of quercetin derivatives also increased upon drought stress in different plants  <cit> , clearly indicating that in pollen of drought-stressed plants, the accumulation of individual flavonoid metabolites may play a protective role against oxidative stress and damage of the pollen tissue. elevated co <dig> resulted in increased levels of flavonoid metabolites in several plant species  <cit> . in ragweed pollen, the metabolite level was approximately at the same levels under drought, irrespectively of the co <dig> concentration . thus, drought might be more important than elevated co <dig> in increasing the levels of these individual metabolites. a single metabolite  was also increased under co <dig> treatment alone , similar to the impact of co <dig> in soybean, where the concentration of only one flavonoid, a quercetin glycoside, was also increased  <cit> . this result indicates species-specific co <dig> responses in flavonoid content and composition  <cit> .

supersage dataset
the number of sequenced tags ranged from approximately  <dig>  ×  <dig> to  <dig>  ×  <dig> in the four libraries . the tag frequencies are given in additional file  <dig> . the supersage dataset included  <dig>  different non redundant sequences  of 26 bp in length . for each of these sequences , the tag amounts are provided and count how often a unique sequence was found in each of the four libraries. one sequence  can be found in one, two, three or all four of the libraries, as indicated in the overlapping regions in figure 2a but, according to the transcript expression, in different quantities . the sequenced tag counts for each unique sequence in all of the libraries ranged from ≤  <dig> , 50– <dig> , 500– <dig>  and ≥  <dig>  . the normalized values of each tag in relation to  <dig> tags  for each library resulted in approximately  <dig> % of low- and mid-abundant unique tags, while high- and very high-abundant tags represented only approximately  <dig> % -  <dig> % . a similar distribution of abundant classes has also been reported for other supersage libraries  <cit> . the four libraries had approximately the same unique sequences for the very high-abundant class , the high abundant class  and the mid-abundant class . in contrast, the low-abundant class was more variable, reflecting also the total number of unique sequences of each library . according to the cumulative frequency distribution, only those tpm values greater than  <dig>  to  <dig>  can be considered expressed  <cit>  . therefore, transcripts with a tpm threshold <  <dig>  were eliminated, resulting in more stringent values, coming up with  <dig>  unique sequences . finally, we eliminated all of the sequences with the description ‘no hits’ and the score of the blast hit was set to ≥  <dig>  these parameters resulted then in  <dig>  unique sequences and an equal distribution in all  <dig> of the libraries . the low-abundance sequences were strongly reduced in all of the libraries to approximately  <dig> %, whereas those sequences in the mid- and high-abundant groups strongly increased up to 10% . additionally, mapman was used to group the supersage tags into several functional categories   <cit> . for this grouping, the supersage tags were matched to ambrosia 454-transcriptome data   <cit> . the data were then blasted against arabidopsis  to identify arabidopsis homologues, which then could be sorted to the bin-codes  and only log2-fold changes of at least  <dig>  were further examined . interestingly, elevated co <dig> + drought conditions resulted in higher log2-fold changes compared to the single treatments, indicating additive effects. transcripts with homologies to abiotic stress were mainly up-regulated under all three scenarios, including also dehydration-responsive transcripts, heat-shock proteins and chaperones. regarding drought stress, this result is not surprising and has also been reported in the literature  <cit> . for the bin-name cell wall, a pectate lyase family member and expansin were clearly up-regulated. pectate lyases are important for pollen tube growth by pectin degradation. however, in ragweed pollen, pectate lyases belong to the major allergen amb a  <dig> family . expansins are important for the pollen tube and for cell wall changes and confer drought tolerance  <cit> . moreover, expansins also belong to pollen allergens . the most strongly up-regulated transcript  in all three of the treatments is involved in wax biosynthesis . cer <dig> is mainly expressed in inflorescences and siliques and is induced by osmotic stress  <cit> . this result demonstrates that wax biosynthesis is enhanced under climate change scenarios.

data were analyzed for different filter criteria.

we also performed a pairwise comparison of the libraries according to possible global change scenarios: control vs. drought , control vs. elevated co <dig>  and control vs. co <dig> + drought . using the stdge2go-tool kit, we first searched the amk vs. the amt library for the following parameters: ambrosia, ragweed, pollen, extensin, exine, intine, cell wall, coat and allergen. using the term ambrosia,  <dig> differentially expressed genes were identified that were mainly related to an ambrosia trifida pollen cdna library. all of the genes with a clear homologue and not only the description pollen cdna library are listed in table  <dig>  the term ragweed resulted in  <dig> differentially expressed genes that were also found in the ambrosia search. the search term “pollen” showed  <dig> hits that were primarily related to an ambrosia trifida pollen cdna library and thus also present in the ambrosia search. for pollen, we also carried out a search for exine, intine, extensin, coat and cell wall. however, no additional hits were found. searching for “allergen” identified  <dig> ambrosia genes, a calcium-binding protein isoallergen  <dig>  amb a  <dig> , amb a  <dig>  and amb a  <dig>  that were all up-regulated under drought stress . in total, we could identify eight transcripts for allergenic proteins from a. artemisiifolia: two calcium-binding proteins , pectate lyases , an actin-binding protein  and a cystatin proteinase inhibitor  . except for the transcript of the amb a  <dig>  precursor protein, all of the other transcripts were up-regulated under drought. however, four of these transcripts were below the threshold of  <dig> -fold . the transcript for a homologue of a down-regulated aba-responsive hva <dig> protein from a. trifida was found in very high abundance . in vegetative tissue, the hva <dig> genes are expressed in different tissues and show high levels of expression in flowers and inflorescences  <cit> . drought stress suppressed hva22a and hva22c expression, had little effect on hva22e expression and enhanced hva22d expression in the inflorescent stems of arabidopsis <cit> . no changes or only small effects could be observed in the flower buds, except for a slight enhancement of expression under drought stress  <cit> . in accordance with our results, this result indicates that in addition to stress, the hva <dig> genes may also be important for the reproduction of plants. a homologue for a putative pollen-specific transcript from a. trifida was also found in high abundance and was down-regulated by drought. other pollen-specific sequences were homologues to a pistil- and pollen-expressed gene from sunflower , a pollen coat protein transcript from wild cabbage and a pollen-specific actin-depolymerising factor from tobacco that were both down-regulated. sf <dig> belongs to a gene family expressed in pollen and pistil in angiosperms and the encoded protein is important for pollen-pistil interactions  <cit> ; however, the molecular function is still unknown. a search with the term “drought” resulted in  <dig> transcripts to homologues of a drought-stress subtracted cdna library of safflower, also belonging to the asteraceae and  <dig> of these cdnas were up-regulated in drought-stressed ragweed pollen. among these cdnas, homologues to a carbonic anhydrase  <dig>  a cyclophilin and a plastocyanin, proteins that are known to be allergenic, showed highly up-regulated transcripts . interestingly, a highly up-regulated transcript for a cbs  domain-containing protein homologue of a. trifida was detected . cbs domain-containing proteins can sense cell energy levels and regulate redox homeostasis  <cit> . these proteins are important for stress regulation and corresponding genes are up-regulated upon drought stress  <cit> .

next, we searched the allfam database of allergen families, restricted to plants and inhalation. this search included  <dig> allergen families with  <dig> allergens . in this search, the p-value was set to < e− <dig>  except for safflower, which belongs also to the asteraceae. in addition to the known allergens found under the ambrosia search, eight transcripts for putative allergenic proteins from other plants according to the allfam database were identified . seven of these transcripts were clearly up-regulated under drought, at least by a three-fold log <dig> change. in contrast, a homologue to an aspartic proteinase precursor from maize was down-regulated. the highest abundances were seen for the transcripts homologous to a profilin of rubber tree, an acidic chitinase of jelly fig and a safflower carbonic anhydrase. as pathogenesis-related  proteins are known to be allergenic, we also searched for this term, coming up with a single hit for pr 5– <dig> homologue of sunflower, which was up-regulated under drought . however, it is important to note that the abundances of all of these transcripts are low as compared to the ‘amb a’ abundances in ragweed pollen.

the search of the amk vs. the amc library was performed for the terms given above. under elevated co <dig> concentration, the term ambrosia resulted in  <dig> differentially regulated transcripts that were also mainly related to an a. trifida pollen cdna library and the specified homologues are given in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  a search for ragweed resulted in  <dig> transcripts that were already present in the ambrosia search. under the search for allergen, five genes of a. artemisiifolia were identified: amb a  <dig> , amb a  <dig> , amb a  <dig>  and calcium-binding protein isoallergen  <dig> were up-regulated under elevated co <dig>  while the low-abundant profilin isoallergen  <dig> was down-regulated . this increase in amb a  <dig> transcripts is in accordance with an increased level of amb a  <dig> protein content in ragweed pollen grown under increased co <dig> concentrations  <cit> . in total, nine transcripts for allergenic proteins from a. artemisiifolia were identified: two calcium-binding proteins , pectate lyases , a cystatin proteinase inhibitor , a profilin allergen  . seven of these transcripts were up-regulated and two were down-regulated  under elevated co <dig>  however, for two transcripts, the log <dig> fold change was below the threshold . although at low abundance, the transcript homologous to a lipid transfer protein  from a. trifida was highly up-regulated  under elevated co <dig>  ltps are basic proteins that are abundant in higher plants  <cit> . these proteins belong to the prolamin superfamily and their role in allergenicity has been reviewed recently  <cit> . similar to the drought library, the homologue for an abscisic acid-responsive hva <dig> transcript of a. trifida was found in high abundance and was down-regulated under elevated co <dig> concentrations . the transcript for the homologue of a putative pollen-specific protein from a. trifida was present in very high abundance and was slightly down-regulated under the elevated co <dig> regime . in contrast, the transcript for the pollen-specific protein sf <dig> homolog from sunflower was clearly up-regulated . other up-regulated pollen proteins included transcripts for a homologue of a pollen tube protein from tobacco and a pistil-specific extensin-like protein from safflower, while the transcript for a homologue of a pollen coat protein from wild cabbage was down-regulated. however, this value was below the threshold. although not directly linked to pollen, the transcript for a homologue of a seed coat protein from rapeseed was extremely up-regulated  . the general search for pollen showed  <dig> transcripts and  <dig> out of these transcripts were from the pollen cdna of a. trifida. other highly regulated transcripts of ambrosia included a ribokinase  and a ribosomal protein l <dig> .

the allfam database search indicated seven transcripts for putative allergenic proteins from other plants. five of these proteins were up-regulated under elevated co <dig> concentrations, whereas the transcripts of a protein kinase and an aspartic proteinase were down-regulated, similar as under drought stress . interestingly, the transcript of a homologue for a non-specific lipid-transfer protein of red sage was also strongly up-regulated, although at low abundance. as described for the drought stress conditions, the transcript level of pr 5– <dig> homologue from sunflower was also elevated .

in a final step, we compared the ambrosia control library  vs. the elevated co <dig> + drought-stressed library . under the search term ambrosia,  <dig> transcripts and for ragweed  <dig> transcripts, mainly homologues from a. trifida, were identified. the homology description is given in table  <dig>  the search term “allergen” resulted in five trancripts from a. artemisiifolia and the calcium-binding protein isoallergen  <dig>  amb a  <dig> , amb a  <dig>  and amb a  <dig>  were up-regulated . in total, eight transcripts of up-regulated allergenic proteins were identified for a. artemisiifolia: two calcium-binding proteins , pectate lyases , a profilin-like protein  and a cystatin proteinase inhibitor . however, the change of amb a  <dig>  precursor and amb a cpi were below the threshold of  <dig> . an ltp homologue from a. trifida was highly up-regulated . the transcript of a low-abundance aspartic protease homologue from a. trifida, allergenic according to the allfam database, was highly up-regulated . the transcript of the very high abundant pollen-specific protein homologue from a. trifida was slightly down-regulated, similar to the other two libraries, while the transcript of the pollen-specific protein sf <dig> homologue from sunflower was up-regulated . the transcript of a pollen coat protein homologue from wild cabbage was slightly down-regulated and the seed coat protein transcripts homologous to the one from rapeseed was extremely highly up-regulated  . the general search for pollen resulted in  <dig> transcripts that were mainly related to the a. trifida pollen cdna library. the search input drought resulted in  <dig> differentially regulated transcripts with homology to a safflower drought stress-subtracted library and  <dig> of these transcripts were up-regulated. the homologue of an aba-responsive hva <dig> transcript from a. trifida was down-regulated, as in the other two libraries. although at low abundance, the transcript for the cbs domain-containing protein was highly up-regulated .

the allfam database indicated five additional transcripts for allergenic proteins. three of these transcripts were up-regulated and two were down-regulated .

quantitative real-time rt-pcr 
qrt-pcr was performed for selected ‘amb a’ transcripts . the relative expression rate ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> and increased for amb a  <dig> , amb a  <dig> , amb a  <dig> , amb a  <dig> , amb a  <dig> and amb a  <dig>  while the expression levels of amb a  <dig> , amb a  <dig> and amb a  <dig> were not influenced or even reduced. the highest values were observed for drought and co <dig> + drought  and amb a  <dig> , amb a  <dig> and amb a  <dig> showed the strongest increase. to validate the results from the supersage, we compared the log <dig> fold change of ‘amb a’ transcripts found in the supersage libraries and the qrt-pcr results. for the amb a  <dig> transcripts, a relatively good correlation was found. the best correlation was observed for the drought treatment, whereas the elevated co <dig> and elevated co <dig> + drought showed the same expression trend but not identical absolute values. using only the significantly changed qrt-pcr ratios a significant correlation with the supersage data sets was found . for amb a  <dig>  the qrt-pcr data contrasted the supersage data and for amb a  <dig>  the fold changes were much higher for the supersage data compared to the qrt-pcr values. however, this kind of result has also been reported in the literature with coincident and contrasting data for supersage and microarrays  <cit> , as well as for the supersage and qrt-pcr analyses  <cit> . in sheepgrass differences up to a factor of  <dig>  between digital gene expression data and rt-pcr ratio and even inconsistencies were reported  <cit> . in poplar differences by factors of 4– <dig> between microarray and qrt-pcr data were reported and in switchgrass also factors up to  <dig> were found  <cit> . this result reflects a general problem when comparing transcript abundance with different platforms and might be caused by allele-specific gene expression  <cit> . moreover, it is interesting to note that transcript abundances are important when comparing different platforms and that good correlations were found for high abundance transcripts and a correlation decrease for lower abundance transcripts  <cit> , as it was also given for amb a  <dig> in this study.

CONCLUSIONS
our data on ragweed plants fumigated with elevated co <dig> and drought stress conditions support the idea that pollen transcripts related to allergenicity are influenced by such global climate change factors. a strong up-regulation of ‘amb a’ transcripts was evident under elevated co <dig>  drought stress and elevated co <dig> + drought stress conditions. based on normalized tags, amb a  <dig>  and amb a cpi were expressed at the highest levels. the increased amb a  <dig> transcript level is in accordance with an increased amb a  <dig> protein content under elevated co <dig> concentrations  <cit> .this result clearly indicates that under expected global change conditions, the allergenicity of ragweed pollen may increase, thereby affecting human health. however, we cannot exclude the possibility that the increased ‘amb a’ transcript level will also reflect the corresponding allergenic protein level, as an incongruent expression between transcripts and proteins is well described in the literature  <cit> . in addition to the well-known ‘amb a’ transcripts, transcript homologies to other plant allergens were found that might modulate the ‘amb a’ allergenic response. however, this possibility requires to be tested in suitable model systems.
