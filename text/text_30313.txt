BACKGROUND
copy number variation  of genomic segments is a common phenomenon that affects approximately 12% and  <dig> % of the human and mouse genomes, respectively  <cit> . comprehensive genomic analyses have shown that cnv sequences often overlap and form clusters of variable regions  <cit> . these regions, known as cnv regions , are associated with variations in gene expression and phenotype  <cit> . frequently, cnvrs of intermediate size and larger  are associated with segmental duplications  in the human and mouse genomes  <cit> . an sd is defined as a block of highly homologous  duplicated genomic dna that, in the human genome, can range from  <dig> kbp to several hundred thousand bp  <cit> . in the mouse genome, sds can be as large as  <dig> mbp in size  <cit> . many of the large sds contain repetitive sequences with ambiguous borders and copy numbers that vary among strains. these sequences are called complex cnvrs  <cit> . a previous study proposed that cnvrs are associated with differences in gene expressions among strains, possibly through changes of local chromatin structures in cnvrs  <cit> . previous studies identified sd regions through systematic analysis of the mouse genome and characterized cnv in these regions  <cit> . however, the detailed character of the repeating unit and the structure of the duplication pattern remained to be resolved. to better understand the evolution of sds and the biological role of cnvrs, the repetitive structure of sds must be elucidated in more detail. in this study, we aimed to identify repetitive “core elements” as well as copy numbers of the elements and the detailed structure of large sds in the mouse genome. core elements were defined as consensus sequences of repetitive sequences and were expected to be the basic units that formed sds.

we characterized the organization and variation in copy number of core elements in one of the large sds on chromosome  <dig> in mice. the strategy implemented in this study involved four steps:  self-comparison of the dna sequences of entire mouse chromosomes  using the high-speed and large-scale-homology search algorithm, similarity/homology efficient analyze procedure , to identify candidate sds  <cit> ,  identification of core elements and description of the repetitive structure of the sd, using the newly developed stepwise ab initio method, blast-based systematic analysis of herplot to extract regional distinction ,  comparison of the cnv found in the core elements among mouse strains by comparative genome hybridization array , and  characterization of core elements that contain cnv  and those that do not .

RESULTS
detection of segmental duplications by sheap
in order to detect candidate sds, we conducted self-comparative-plot analysis of mouse genome sequences using the sheap method. for certain chromosomes, the output of the self-comparative-plot analysis contained square dark patches . additional file  <dig> shows an example of the output from the self-comparative-plot for an entire chromosome  with a dark background. further magnification of these patches revealed a tartan-checked pattern with a complex arrangement of diagonal split lines, which indicated the presence of homologous repetitive sequences . we selected candidates for large sds as the regions that visually showed tartan-checked patterns larger than  <dig> kbp. these large sds comprised repetitive sequences in both forward and reverse orientations, and were arranged in various patterns. all mouse chromosomes were analyzed except chromosome y. of the  <dig> chromosomes analyzed, eight contained large sd regions. after previously known repetitive elements had been masked using repeatmasker  <cit> , the number of diagonal lines obtained in the self-comparative plot described above was reduced in a large proportion of the sds . this result indicated that most of the sds contained a large number of known repetitive elements , as reported previously  <cit> . we focused on one of the sds, named sd13m, which is spans nucleotide  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig> on chromosome  <dig> ). sd13m was chosen because this sd contains a wide range of repeats in both forward and reverse orientations. furthermore, a previous study reported difficulty in transferring the chromosomal segment including sd13m from one mouse strain, msm/ms , to another, c57bl/6j , in the course of establishing a consomic strain  <cit> . therefore, sd13m may have an important biological role. the reduction in the number of diagonal lines in this region after the masking of known repeats  indicates that this region also contained a large number of known repetitive elements. the proportion of known repetitive elements in sd13m was similar to those of other sds .

identification of core elements for sd13m
we defined “fundamental repetitive sequences” as sequences that covered most of the repetitive structure of sd13m and could be used to extract core elements. for the identification of core elements, we developed shepherd , a stepwise ab initio method that is designed to extract longer repetitive elements than previous methods  <cit> , and involves the following three steps:

extraction of fundamental repetitive sequences from a self-comparative-plot matrix
all diagonal lines in figure 1b that comprised at least three consecutive dots  were extracted from a self-comparative-plot of sd13m that consisted of a dot-plot matrix . consequently,  <dig>  repetitive sequences, which ranged from  <dig>  kbp to  <dig>  kbp in length, were extracted . given that many repetitive sequences had different lengths , we determined the most appropriate length for fundamental repetitive sequences to be one that was not too short but still covered most of the sd13m region. in terms of the distribution of the lengths of the repetitive sequences, one major peak was detected at approximately  <dig>  kb, and four small peaks were identified at approximately  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> , and 6– <dig>  kbp, respectively . when the minimum length was set to  <dig>  kbp, the selected sequences covered more than 96% of the entire sd13m region . an increase of the minimum length resulted in a decrease in the coverage rate. when repetitive sequences of ≥ <dig>  kbp in length were selected, the coverage rate was still 94% of the entire sd13m . in contrast, when the maximum length was decreased, the coverage rate decreased. when repetitive sequences of lengths ≤ <dig>  kbp were selected, the coverage of sd13m was greater than 94% . these analyses indicate that the most appropriate length of the fundamental repetitive sequences is between  <dig> kbp and  <dig>  kbp.

among the  <dig>  repetitive sequences identified in sd13m, there were  <dig>  sequences within the range of 3– <dig>  kbp. to eliminate redundant and overlapping sequences from among these  <dig>  repetitive sequences, we selected one sequence out of the  <dig>  repetitive sequences and removed the other sequences represented by diagonal lines that were located in the same column or in the same row as that sequence in the self-comparative-plot map . this step has the advantage of reducing machine loading given that the pairwise analysis that is most commonly used requires approximately  <dig> million  pairs, and thus require many days to complete. in contrast, by eliminating redundant and overlapping sequences from  <dig>  sequences, the use of a self-comparative-plot map enables the analysis to be completed within a short period of time. after repeating this process for different sequences until all redundant sequences had been removed,  <dig> nonredundant and nonoverlapping repetitive sequences remained, which covered approximately 80% of the sd13m region. we defined these sequences as fundamental repetitive sequences.

clustering of fundamental repetitive sequences
we clustered the fundamental repetitive sequences into groups, such that there was the maximum redundancy in sequence similarity within each group, but the least possible redundancy between the groups. the overlap of these fundamental repetitive sequences was tested by pairwise alignments using bl2seq   <cit> . we counted the number of sequences that overlapped with other sequences for different lengths of overlap . the sequences of 92% of the total number of fundamental repetitive sequences shared at least  <dig>  kbp in length, and 14% of the sequences shared  <dig> kbp with at least one other sequence. given that most of the sequences that were shared had a size equivalent to that of fundamental repetitive sequences, which are between  <dig>  and  <dig>  kbp in length, the fundamental repetitive sequences could be classified into a smaller number of groups as follows. we considered that the most representative sequence in each group should have the highest number of matching counts with other sequences in the group, and that sequences similar to the representative sequence should belong to that group. as a result of this process, we clustered the  <dig> fundamental repetitive sequences into  <dig> groups .

identification of core elements
in each clustered group, we identified core elements, which are defined on the basis of two criteria:  the length should be > <dig> kbp  which is an arbitrary threshold, and  the majority of sequences in each clustered group should share the consensus sequence of a given core element. because one of the  <dig> groups contained two core elements, a total of  <dig> sequences was identified. the sequences of the core elements are shown in additional file  <dig>  alignment of these core elements using muscle revealed a radial pattern, which suggested that most of the core elements have similar divergence and that there is no strong homology among them . given that sequences homologous to the core elements  covered approximately 90% of the sd13m region, our method can characterize the repetitive structure of sd13m efficiently. the positions and directions of each core element within sd13m are shown in figure 4b, and additional information on the core elements mapped in sd13m is summarized in additional file  <dig>  the pattern of distribution of the core elements also indicates the existence of a higher order of repeating units of various sizes because there are many places where multiple core elements are clearly located adjacent to each other . however, because the borders between these regions are not clear, and the sizes vary from short to long, we could not characterize the larger repeating units further.

characterization of core elements
to characterize the core elements, we annotated them with repeatmasker and with blastn using the refseqgene database. the known repeats and refseq sequences that were detected in each core element are listed in additional file  <dig>  as expected from the results of the self-plot analysis with masked sequences, all of the core elements contained at least a partial sequence of a known repeat, such as a long interspersed nuclear element , short interspersed nuclear element , or long terminal repeat  type of retrotransposon, as well as uncharacterized repeats such as mursatrep <dig>  the average proportion of known repeats in the core elements was  <dig> % , which indicated that core elements consisted largely of known repeats. most of these known repeats were fragmented and overlapped with each other. one-third of the core elements  contained partial sequences of refseq genes . these partial sequences could be divided roughly into three types of reported or predicted genes: members of the zinc finger protein  family, members of the vomeronasal  <dig> receptor  family, and chromobox homolog  <dig> . the average proportion of the total lengths of these annotated gene-like sequences that was found in the core elements were 8% for zfp, 16% for vmn2r, and 37% for cbx <dig> .

cnv of core elements among mouse strains
the sd13m region comprises variously sized forward and reverse repetitive sequences, and was defined previously as a complex cnvr . if core elements are sources of cnvrs as well as of sds, they should correspond to distinctive strain-specific cnv. to test this hypothesis, we conducted acgh analysis using a tiling array designed for the sd13m region to compare the copy numbers of the core elements between the mouse strains b <dig> and msm, and between b <dig> and blg <dig> . the average copy numbers of the probes for the entire region of sd13m were greater in blg <dig> and msm than in b <dig> . the acgh values of a total of  <dig>  probes were mapped on  <dig> out of the  <dig> core elements . the mapped acgh log <dig> values for blg <dig> or msm to the reference  on each core elements are shown in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  in most core elements, the mapped acgh values deviated from zero, and they had a similar distribution pattern throughout each core element. this observation indicated that the copy numbers of the core elements varied among strains. a t-test showed that  <dig> out of  <dig> core elements differed significantly in copy number, both between b <dig> and blg <dig> and between b <dig> and msm, and that three core elements differed significantly in only one pair of strains . these results indicated that most of the core elements displayed distinctive cnv among strains , which suggests that they are the basic units related to the formation of both sds and cnvs. the remaining eight core elements, which did not differ significantly in copy number between b <dig> and blg <dig> or between b <dig> and msm, should not be considered as cnv-type. these core elements were defined as being of constant type. the estimated copy numbers and the average acgh values of the core elements are listed in additional file  <dig>  the mapping of a representative cnv-type  and a constant-type  is shown in figure 6a and 6b, respectively.

the results of the acgh were confirmed by quantitative pcr analysis using genomic dna as the template with several sets of primers . the qpcr analyses showed that the relative amount of core element  <dig> increased additively as the dosage of the msm allele in a given consomic strain increased . conversely, the relative amount of core element  <dig> remained almost constant when the dosage of the msm allele increased in the same consomic strain . these results indicate that the copy number of core element  <dig> is greater in msm than in b <dig>  whereas the copy number of core element  <dig> does not differ between b <dig> and msm.

comparison of constant-type and cnv-type core elements
next, we compared the sequence characteristics of the cnv and constant types of core element. the results of the annotation for both types of core element are listed in table  <dig>  all of the constant-type core elements are listed, together with the  <dig> cnv-type core elements that showed the greatest variation in copy number among strains. the cnv-type core elements preferentially contained various classes of ltr transposable elements, such as orr <dig>  figure 7a shows the average proportion of known repeats, classified into six categories , in the core elements. notably, the average proportion of ltr sequences was significantly higher in cnv-type core elements than in the constant type. in contrast, the average proportion of line sequences was significantly lower in cnv-type core elements than in the constant type. we investigated the divergence of homologous sequences in each group of core elements . the average divergence of cnv-type core elements was greater than that of the constant type . furthermore, divergence was correlated with the number of duplications of the core elements in each group . these results suggest that constant-type core elements emerged more recently than cnv-type core elements in sd13m.

a detailed information on the known repeats and refseq genes that were detected in each core element is provided in additional file  <dig>  ltr retrotransposons are underlined. core elements with large cnv were selected by two criteria: 1) a p value lower than the significance value; 2) the  <dig> core elements that showed the greatest variation among strains. b proportion of each core element that comprised the known repeat. the proportion was calculated by dividing the total length of the known repeat in the core element by the total length of the core element. c expected copy numbers in b <dig> were calculated from the number of homologous sequences in each of the  <dig> groups . expected copy numbers in blg <dig> and msm were calculated from the average of the acgh values and the copy number in b <dig> .

discussion
it has been reported that the mammalian genome contains many complex arrays of repetitive sequences in the centromeric and subtelomeric regions, as well as other sd regions in which many repetitive sequences coexist in a complex manner  <cit> . however, many complex arrays of repetitive sequences, in particular large sd regions, have been neglected during the detailed characterization of genome structure, partly owing to the lack of an appropriate method for the comprehensive analysis of such highly complex structures. in the present study, we conducted a whole-genome search for complex arrays of repetitive regions by the self-comparative-plot method using the sheap program. the advantages of sheap are:  its applicability to massively long sequences ,  its applicability to sequences that contain many global repetitive structures, and  its ability to complete the analysis within a reasonable time frame. with respect to the last point, sheap can complete the self-comparison of one human or mouse chromosome within 20 minutes when using a conventional personal computer. as a result, in this study, it was possible to visualize remarkably large sd regions, which covered more than  <dig> kbp and were composed of complex arrays of duplicated sequences in both forward and reverse directions, as square dark patches.

the mouse genome has been systematically searched for regions that contain sds  <cit> . all of the large sd regions that were identified in the present study were also reported as sd regions in an earlier study  <cit> . however, other sd regions that were reported previously, such as those on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  were not detected as dark square patches in the self-comparative-plots of whole chromosomes that were generated by sheap. the results indicate a limitation of this approach based on self-comparative plots because dark square patches were not apparent in some sd regions. nevertheless, they were detected at higher magnification , and showed different patterns to those of the dark square patches. these results suggest that different types of sd exist in the mouse genome. indeed, in the self-comparative-plot analysis of sequence similarity among large sd regions , we found that most of the sds comprised unique repetitive sequences, although all of the sds share many known repetitive elements. furthermore, this observation suggests that interchromosomal nonallelic homologous recombination has occurred rarely among the sds in the mouse genome, consistent with a previously described finding  <cit> , and that the sds have formed and evolved independently.

the present study is the first detailed analysis of repetitive elements in sd13m, which is one of the large sds of the mouse genome. the results showed that six core elements within sd13m contained the functionally uncharacterized satellite repeat mursatrep. the presence of this satellite repeat was characteristic of sd13m because its frequency was greater in sd13m than in sds overall . the transposable element mursatrep <dig> is presumed to be associated with pericentromeric duplications . these results support the contention that core elements might have structural significance, similar to repetitive sequences in the centromeric region  <cit> . in addition, four core elements contained mmsat <dig>  which has been reported to be a satellite sequence that encodes zinc finger proteins. the presence of this repeat was also characteristic of sd13m, but its function is unknown. other core elements contained known repetitive elements such as lines, small regions of refseq sequences, and ltr sequences. lines are known to be enriched in intermediately sized and larger sds  and duplicated gene regions, and are supposed to facilitate nonallelic homologous recombination  <cit> . the existence of these repetitive elements in the core elements strongly supports the hypothesis that sd13m was formed by combinations of nonallelic homologous recombination events. furthermore, regions with abundant transposable elements are thought to be targeted preferentially by other transposition events  <cit> . the presence of a higher proportion of ltr sequences in cnv-type than in constant-type core elements suggests that retrotransposition of ltrs also promotes nonallelic homologous recombination and caused cnv in sd13m. this model is very similar to the case of centromere expansion in rice, in which retrotransposons and satellite repeats were duplicated by intra-element homologous recombination  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we characterized both the structures and the relative quantities of the repetitive elements in a complex sd region on chromosome  <dig> of mouse. although we did not address the functional significance of sds in this study, their characteristic repetitive structure indicates that they are similar to the functionally important centromeric region  <cit> . interestingly, sd13m is included in the region of chromosome  <dig> that was difficult to substitute from strain b <dig> to msm during the course of establishing a consomic strain  <cit> . the results of structural and quantitative analyses in this study may help to elucidate the biological role of sd13m.
