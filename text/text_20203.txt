BACKGROUND
agarwood is widely used in traditional medicines as a digestive, sedative, and antiemetic drug and is also popular as incense and perfume in the middle east, south asia, japan, and china. additionally, the agarwood sculpturing for interior decoration is another important aspect of its value which generates a lot of income in asia. in the international market, high-quality agarwood is more costly than gold. agarwood is a dark, resinous, non-timber wood that forms in the stem, branch, or root of aquilaria and gyrinops trees after they are wounded and infected by a fungus , but these natural processes always develop very slowly over decades. owing to the economic value and great demand of agarwood, natural aquilaria forests have been destroyed in almost all countries in which agarwood is commercially exploited. for the protection of wild aquilaria resources and their sustainable use, all aquilaria spp. have been listed in appendix ii of the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora , and aquilaria cultivation has been drawn much attention in countries such as china, india, vietnam, indonesia, malaysia, and thailand. however, the current methods used by farmers, including partial trunk pruning, burn-chisel-drill, and fungi inoculation, all require considerable time to produce agarwood and result in a product with very low yield and quality.

aquilaria sinensis  gilg is one of the most important plant resources for producing agarwood in china as well as the only certified source for agarwood listed in china pharmacopoeia <cit> . more than  <dig> million planted a. sinensis trees are estimated to be scattered throughout hainan, guangdong, and yunnan provinces, and more than one-fourth of them are older than 5 years and have become available for agarwood induction. uncovering the mechanism of agarwood formation in wounded trees is crucial to establishing an efficient induction method for agarwood.

studies have shown that sesquiterpenes and phenylethyl chromone derivatives are the main compounds in agarwood  <cit> . thus, understanding the biosynthesis and regulation of sesquiterpenes and chromone in aquilaria spp. is critically important in determining the mechanism of agarwood formation. however, to date, the biosynthesis pathway of chromone derivatives remains almost unknown. the terpenoid metabolism pathway is, by comparison, very clear. the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenes can reportedly occur via the mevalonic acid   <cit>  and 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate   <cit>  pathways , in which sesquiterpene synthases are enzymes used in the final step to form sesquiterpenes. currently, many studies on the functional identification and regulation of these enzymes have been reported. in gossypium arboreum, gawrky <dig> positively regulates the expression of -δ-cadinene synthase, which catalyzes the branch point leading to biosynthesis of sesquiterpene gossypol  <cit> . aawrky <dig> regulates the expression of amorpha- <dig> -diene synthase , which is the key artemisinin biosynthesis enzyme in artemisia annua. overexpression of aawrky <dig> in tobacco or in a. annua can significantly activate ads promoter activity, and artemisinin production increases accordingly  <cit> . the latest report on arabidopsis has shown that transcription factor  myc <dig> interacts with della proteins, positively regulating the expression of sesquiterpene synthases tps <dig> and tps <dig> in the jasmonic acid  and gibberellic acid  signaling pathways  <cit> . however, studies on agarwood sesquiterpenes in aquilaria spp. are still extremely limited, and with the exception of five δ-guaiene synthase genes , which were cloned from cell cultures of a. crassna <cit> , most of the genes remain to be cloned. kumeta & ito  <cit>  have also found that methyl jasmonate  treatment increases the expression of these genes and induces the production of sesquiterpene δ-guaiene. their report was the first and remains the only molecular report of sesquiterpene biosynthesis and regulation in aquilaria spp..

agarwood is produced after an aquilaria tree is wounded  <cit> . we have observed that in the early period of agarwood formation, the resin in agarwood exists in  <dig> forms: tylose and gel , and the sesquiterpenes in agarwood have antimicrobial and anti-disease activity  <cit> . based on previous studies, we have hypothesized that agarwood is the product of a plant defense response  <cit> : when an aquilaria tree is wounded, damage signals are induced and transmitted, activating the defense response, after which defensive substances such as sesquiterpenes and phenylethyl chromone derivatives are produced. when these products combine with the wood tissue to avoid damage expansion, agarwood forms. the key to testing this hypothesis is to reveal the mechanism of wound-induced biosynthesis of agarwood sesquiterpenes, but this goal is hindered by the very limited amount of genomic information available for aquilaria. the present study made use of  <dig> sequencing technology in order to  provide detailed insight into the transcriptomes of healthy and wounded a. sinensis,  discover candidate transcripts with significant homology to important enzymes in the sesquiterpene biosynthesis pathway and verify their function, and  identify candidate regulators that might be related to wound signal transduction and regulation of agarwood formation.

RESULTS
transcriptome sequence assembly and annotation
two cdna libraries from the stems of the healthy and wounded a. sinensis  were constructed using switching mechanism at 5' end of rna transcript  technology. the  <dig> libraries were sequenced in one run using  <dig> gs-flx pyrosequencing technology. a total of  <dig>   and  <dig>   raw reads were generated . after the removal of sequences shorter than  <dig> bp and empty vectors,  <dig> , <dig> high-quality reads , including  <dig>   from the h library and  <dig>   from the w library, were obtained. after de novo assembly of these reads,  <dig>  unigenes from the h library and  <dig>  unigenes from the w library were generated, respectively . combining the reads from the  <dig> libraries, we obtained  <dig>  unigenes with an average length of  <dig>  bp. more than 70% of these unigenes were between  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp long , and almost 17% contained more than  <dig> reads .

a vector reads: the reads sequences are all vector sequences.

b low quality reads: after removing empty reads and vector reads, the length of reads is less than the cutoff length .

c high quality reads: after removing empty reads and vector reads, the length of reads is more than the cutoff length .

d contigs: reads number ≥  <dig> 

e singlets: reads =  <dig> 

f unigenes = contigs + singlets.

the blast annotation of the  <dig>  unigenes indicated that  <dig>   shared homology with the sequences in the ncbi nucleotide database, and  <dig>   had matches to known protein sequences in the ncbi non-redundant database. to obtain more information, we also carried out the blastx search against the swiss-prot protein database, and  <dig> % of the unigenes were thus annotated , indicating that the information about the genomes and transcriptomes of aquilaria spp. was very limited. thus, our  <dig> database is important, and the unigene sequences obtained in this study may represent most of the novel genes of aquilaria spp..

based on an interpro analysis,  <dig>   unigenes were annotated with at least one go term, and the distribution of gene functions based on the cellular component, molecular function, and biological process categories was very similar in the  <dig> libraries . kegg annotation showed that, in the metabolism process, although the w library had a total number of unigenes smaller than that of the h library, it had a slightly higher number of unigenes related to carbohydrate metabolism and metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides . this result indicated that the pruning wound in a. sinensis had activated carbohydrate, terpenoid, and polyketides metabolism, which may be related to agarwood formation.

to investigate the differences between the  <dig> libraries, ideg <dig>  <cit>  was used to identify differentially expressed genes . a total of  <dig>  degs were obtained, including  <dig>  and  <dig>  expressed uniquely in the h and w libraries, respectively;  <dig>  were expressed in both libraries but at different levels . kegg classification showed that the number of “up” unigenes was far greater than the number of “down” unigenes : for metabolism and genetic information processing,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of the degs were “up”, respectively. the percentage and distribution of degs annotated with go terms are shown in additional file 5: figure s <dig> 

enzyme genes involved in sesquiterpenes biosynthesis
the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenes occurs via the mva  <cit>  and dxp  <cit>  pathways, and  <dig> key enzymes are commonly involved: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme a reductase , the first key enzyme in the mvp pathway; dxp synthase , the first rate-limiting enzyme in the dxp pathway; farnesyl diphosphate  synthase ; and sesquiterpenes synthases. in our  <dig> unigene database ,  <dig> unigenes were annotated as being related to the sesquiterpene biosynthesis pathway, and  <dig> of them putatively encode these enzymes, including  <dig> hmgrs,  <dig> dxpss,  <dig> fpss, and  <dig> sesquiterpene synthases . unigenes putatively encoding other enzymes in the sesquiterpene biosynthesis pathway were also found, including acetyl-coenzyme a acyltransferase , mevalonate kinase , phosphomevalonate kinase , and 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol- <dig>  4-cyclodiphosphate synthase  .

fps is a branch point enzyme in terpenoid biosynthesis  <cit> . its product, fpp, is the common precursor of sesquiterpenes, steroids, and farnesylated proteins. we found two unigenes that putatively encode fps. one is a full-length cdna  that has an open reading frame of  <dig> nucleotides and encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids. the phenetic relationship between asfps and the fpss characterized in other species is depicted in additional file 6: figure s <dig>  asfps had the highest homology with the fps sequence from aquilaria. microcarpa , suggesting that asfps belongs to the fps family.

with the exception of one fps, the full-length open-reading frames  of other unigenes were unavailable. sesquiterpene synthases are the key enzymes that catalyze fpp, leading to sesquiterpenes biosynthesis. therefore, they were the focus of this study.

cloning and functional identification of a. quilaria sesquiterpene synthase genes 
based on the degenerated primers,  <dig> full-length cdnas of sesquiterpenes synthases  were cloned and deposited in the ncbi database under the accession numbers jq <dig>  jq <dig>  and jq <dig>  they have orfs of  <dig> nucleotides, which encode almost the same protein of  <dig> amino acids. their nucleotide and protein sequences have more than 92% identity with one another. the alignment of their nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences are shown in additional file 7: figures s <dig> and additional file 8: figures s <dig>  respectively. these proteins contain  <dig> motifs  that are functionally important and highly conserved in all terpene synthase proteins. the phenetic relationship between the  <dig> putative proteins and other characterized sesquiterpenes synthases is shown in additional file 9: figure s <dig>  ass1- <dig> were grouped with acy <dig>  acy <dig>  acy <dig>  acy <dig>  <cit> , aeg <dig>  aeg <dig>  and aeg <dig>  <cit> , which were cloned from a. crassna.

to confirm that ass1- <dig> encode active asss, we cloned them into a pet-28a vector and heterologously expressed them in e. coli. the fusion proteins were detected in soluble fractions . the enzyme assays were performed using the geranyl diphosphate , fpp , and geranylgeranyl diphosphate  substrates, and the reaction products were analyzed using gc-ms. the result showed that ass1- <dig> did not accept geranyl diphosphate or geranylgeranyl diphosphate as a substrate, converting only fpp to terpene products. the  <dig> enzymes yielded the same compounds; the major product was identified as δ-guaiene , and the minor products as β-elemene  and α-guaiene  .

expression of asss induced by mj and identification of sesquiterpenes produced in mj-treated calluses
we analyzed the expression profile of ass using rt-pcr. two pools of cdnas, one derived from the wounded stems of the 3-year-old a. sinensis that comprised the  <dig> library and another from a. sinensis calluses treated with mj, were used for the analysis. mj is an essential signaling molecule that modulates plant secondary metabolism  <cit>  and is capable of inducing the production of sesquiterpenes in aquilaria spp.  <cit> . therefore, mj-treated calluses were also used to investigate the expression of ass. the results demonstrated that ass <dig> and ass <dig> were both induced by either mechanical wounding or mj treatment . the expression of ass <dig> was upregulated significantly—approximately  <dig> times in response to mechanical wounding  and  <dig> times in response to mj treatment .

furthermore, we tested the expression of other enzyme genes in sesquiterpene biosynthesis, including hmgr, dxps, and fps. they were also induced by mechanical wounding and mj, but the upregulation rate was significantly weaker than that associated with ass <dig> and ass <dig>  fully demonstrating that ass <dig> is a typical stress-inducible gene. this result is consistent with those of solid-phase micro-extraction gc-ms analysis, showing that the production of sesquiterpenes increases in response to mj treatment. in the untreated healthy callus samples, only  <dig> sesquiterpenes  were detected, with total peak area of  <dig> . in the mj-treated callus samples,  <dig> sesquiterpenes were detected, with total peak area of  <dig> —approximately  <dig> times higher . among the  <dig> sesquiterpenes, the content of δ-guaiene and α-guaiene was more than 88%, an increase of more than 67-fold relative to the healthy control. the results demonstrated that inducible expression of ass is responsible for the formation of agarwood sesquiterpenes in a. sinensis.

candidate regulators response to wound signals
tfs are critical regulators of gene expression and environmental stress responses  <cit> . in our  <dig> unigene database , a total of  <dig>  unigenes represented homologs of various tf families :  <dig> were annotated as belonging to the apetla <dig> /ethylene-responsive-element-binding family  <cit> ,  <dig> to the bzip family  <cit> ,  <dig> to the myb family  <cit> ,  <dig> to the myb-related family,  <dig> to the bhlh family  <cit> , and  <dig> to the wrky family  <cit> . all of these tfs are reportedly stress-related  <cit> , and some homologous genes have been identified as positive or negative regulators in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in other plants  <cit> .

in defensive response and wound signal transduction, calcium signaling and mitogen-activated protein kinase  cascades play important roles  <cit> . in our study, kegg classification annotated  <dig> unigenes as being related to calcium signaling pathways and  <dig> to mapk signaling pathways .

rt-pcr analysis of candidate regulators response to wound signals
to confirm which of the candidate regulators mentioned above are related to wound signals, we performed rt-pcr analysis to test the effects of mj on the expression of these genes. overall,  <dig> expressed regulators were selected , including tfs myb and wrky, protein kinases cdpk and mapk, and some regulators related to signal molecules mj, ethylene, and hydrogen peroxide. as shown in figure  <dig>  the expression of most of these genes was elevated in response to mj treatment, and only  <dig> tfs, hd-zip, wrky <dig>  wrky <dig>  and wrky <dig>  were downregulated by mj. among the upregulated genes,  <dig> were increased more than 10-fold. they were tfs wrky <dig> and myb <dig>  protein kinases cdpk <dig>  cdpk <dig>  cdpk <dig>  cdpk <dig>  mpkk <dig>  mapk <dig>  mpk <dig>  mapk <dig>  and ja-, ethylene-, or hydrogen peroxide-related regulators jaip, rbf, ein <dig>  erf <dig>  noxb, aosc, aco <dig>  the expression of  <dig> annotated unigenes, mpkk <dig>  mapk <dig> <cit> , myb <dig> <cit> , wrky <dig>  and noxb, the superoxide-generating nadph oxidase  <cit> , was coordinate with ass <dig>  showing elevation of  <dig> -,  <dig> -,  <dig> -,  <dig> -, and  <dig> -fold, respectively. the expression profiles of these wound-signaling-related genes are essentially consistent with the idea that the expression of ass <dig> is induced by wounding but regulated through a complex underlying mechanism.

discussion
aquilaria sinensis transcriptome sequencing
although aquilaria is the most important plant source of agarwood and all aquilaria spp. are listed in appendix ii of the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora  <cit> , little progress to date has been made in deciphering the mechanism of agarwood formation and genomic and genetic information is lacking. the ncbi est database contained only a few hundred aquilaria sequences before this study. the  <dig> pyrosequencing reported herein represents the first concrete effort to generate cdna resources for aquilaria spp. we obtained  <dig>  unigenes from the h and w a. sinensis cdna libraries  and annotated them in detail at bioinformatics levels . we estimated the genome size of a. sinensis preliminarily at approximately  <dig> g using flow cytometry. in the absence of a haploid, genome sequencing is difficult to carry out with current sequencing technology. in the absence of complete genome sequences, transcriptome mining provides the sole option for the subsequent annotation of sequences. the data reported herein may be useful for further research on the functional genomics of aquilaria spp.. importantly, by comparing the unigenes in the w and h libraries, we obtained a large number of degs . these data suggested that the transcriptome of a. sinensis changed significantly in response to mechanical damage and also provided resources for screening genes related to wound signaling and metabolism. kegg annotations of these degs showed that most of the unigenes were related to metabolism processes, especially carbohydrate metabolism, and had higher abundance in the w library than in the h library . the number of carbohydrate metabolism-related unigenes was slightly greater in the w library, indicating that starch and sugar metabolism in a. sinensis may be stimulated by wounding .

the synthesis of sesquiterpenes starts with acetyl-coenzyme a   <cit>  or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and pyruvate   <cit>  from glycolysis. therefore, agarwood formation may have some association with starch and sugar metabolism and is essentially consistent with our electron microscopy findings that a high number of starch granules exist in the healthy wood of a. sinensis, but when the wood is wounded, resin in the agarwood accumulates while the starch granules degrade .

asss are inducible enzymes that may be responsible for the formation of agarwood sesquiterpenes
considering that sesquiterpenes are the most important components of agarwood  <cit> , we tried to identify the genes that encode the enzymes involved in sesquiterpene biosynthesis, and  <dig> such unigenes were found in our database, including  <dig> categories of critical genes  and other genes encoding synthases in sesquiterpene metabolism in aquilaria spp. . these data will be valuable for further studies of the terpene biosynthesis pathway. using a homology-based pcr approach, we obtained  <dig> full-length cdnas of asss  with very similar amino acid sequences. phenetic analysis showed that the evolutional distances among the  <dig> asss were quite small compared to those of sesquiterpene synthases from other plant species, except a. crassna . heterologous expression in e. coli and enzyme assays showed that ass1- <dig> had ass activity, and the major product was revealed to be δ-guaiene . expressions analysis with real-time pcr showed that ass <dig> was barely detectable in either the healthy tissues or the calluses of a. sinensis, whereas in the wounded tissues or mj-treated calluses, ass <dig> expression was increased almost 1000-fold . furthermore, gc-ms analysis showed that the major product was δ-guaiene, essentially consistent with its enzyme reaction, and the sesquiterpene content was increased 74-fold , clearly demonstrating that ass <dig> expression was wound-induced and is responsible for the formation of agarwood sesquiterpenes in a. sinensis.

previous reports have shown that mj can induced  <dig> sesquiterpenes  in cultured cells of a. crassna <cit>  and be produced by the enzymatic reaction of cloned enzymes. of the  <dig> clones , acc <dig> and acl <dig> have no tps activity that might indicate pseudogenes  <cit> . the  <dig> clones  in this study have high homology with acc <dig> and acc <dig>  and catalyzed the same major product. thus, the present experiments allow us to identify ass1- <dig> as active enzymes of a. sinensis, and their inducible expression is responsible for the formation of agarwood sesquiterpenes.

wounding induces asss expression via a complex signaling pathway
research has shown that only after wounding  can agarwood be induced in the healthy wood of aquilaria spp. <cit> . it is, therefore, reasonable to suppose that the early period of agarwood formation is a process of wound signaling transduction before the strong expression of asss. previous studies in other plant species have shown that tfs play important roles in signal transduction and gene expression. some tfs, such as wrky, myb, myc, bzip, erf, and ein <dig> are involved in plant defense and stress responses  <cit> . our  <dig> unigene database contained  <dig>  putative tfs. some homologous genes of these tfs, such as ap <dig>  wrky, and myc, have been identified as positive regulators of sesquiterpene synthases in other plant species  <cit> . in catharanthus roseus, the tf orca <dig> regulates the biosynthesis of terpenoid indole alkaloids and plays an important role in ja response  <cit> ; in cotton, the tf gawrky <dig> positively regulates the expression of the sesquiterpene synthase -δ-cadinene synthase gene and the synthesis of gossypol sesquiterpene  <cit> . similarly, in a. annua, aawrky <dig> and  <dig> ja-responsive ap2/ethylene response factor  tfs, erf <dig> and erf <dig>  are involved in regulating the expression of the sesquiterpene synthase ads and the production of artemisinin  <cit> ; in arabidopsis, myc <dig> interacts with della proteins and positively regulates the expression of tps <dig> and tps <dig>  <cit> .

reversible protein phosphorylation has been proven to be an important regulatory mechanism in the wound signaling pathway, and studies on arabidopsis, tomato, and tobacco have indicated that the mapk cascade is a widespread pathway  <cit> . in addition, calcium and calcium-binding proteins may play some roles in the regulation of early wound responses by elevating intracellular calcium levels and changing the phosphorylation patterns of proteins  <cit> . in this study,  <dig> unigenes were annotated as related to the mapk pathway and  <dig> to calcium signaling, which may play roles in the wound response of agarwood formation.

in the present experiment,  <dig> degs related to wound signal were selected to investigate whether they are co-expression with ass <dig> in response to mj. the results showed that  <dig> were upregulated and  <dig> were downregulated. of these,  <dig> unigenes, including the tfs myb <dig> and wrky <dig>  the protein kinases mapk <dig> and mpkk <dig>  and the nadph oxidase noxb, were significantly upregulated by mj. the downregulated genes were wrky <dig>  wrky <dig>  wrky <dig>  and hd-zip . the ass <dig> promoter has been cloned and scanned with place . it contains some cis-acting elements that could be combined specifically by certain tfs, including wrky, myb, and myc . therefore, we speculate that tfs myb <dig> and wrky <dig> may positively regulate the expression of sesquiterpene synthase, and the downregulated genes may negatively regulate its expression. the generation of hydrogen peroxide has been confirmed to occur both locally and systematically, and its main source is the plasma-membrane-bound nadph oxidase. in the present study, nadph oxidase noxb was significantly upregulated by mj, which is consistent with the theory that mj induces the production of hydrogen peroxide  <cit> . mapk signal transduction pathways are widespread mechanisms in eukaryotic cells that couple environmental responses and transcriptional regulation  <cit> . two coupled components of the mapk cascade, mapk <dig> and mapkk <dig>  were significantly upregulated by mj, demonstrating they may be involved in mj-mediated signaling. calcium is a prevalent messenger molecule in higher plant cells that can mediate plant responses to external signals and regulate a variety of physiological processes. in our experiments,  <dig> cdpks  were upregulated more than 10-fold .

based on these results, we proposed a model to explain the mechanism by which ass <dig> is modulated at the transcriptional level . in this model, the mapk cascade is activated by wound signals and phosphorylates downstream tfs such as myb or wrky. ja signaling may activate the tfs downstream via the hydrogen peroxide or ja-jaz-tf pathways  <cit> . activated tfs bind to the cis-acting element in the promoter of ass <dig> and initiate ass <dig> transcription. ass <dig> is also inducible and may be influenced by the same regulatory mechanisms as those affecting ass <dig>  the results reported herein enhance understanding of wound-induced sesquiterpene synthases expression and agarwood formation. future studies will focus on verifying this proposed model based on the promoter of ass <dig> that we have cloned. we will identify which tfs interact with the ass <dig> promoter, confirm whether the mapk cascade is involved in the wound signaling pathway, and determine the roles of them in ass <dig> expression. clarifying the wound-induced sesquiterpene biosynthesis pathway will help to develop strategies for controlling agarwood production and for the long-term protection of aquilaria spp..

CONCLUSIONS
a comprehensive transcriptome analysis was conducted for healthy and wounded stems of a. sinensis in this study. a total of  <dig>  unigenes with an average length of  <dig>  bp were obtained, and they were annotated in detail at the bioinformatics levels. these data should be useful for further research on the functional genomics of a. sinensis and other aquilaria spp.. transcripts related to sesquiterpene metabolism and regulation were highlighted. three full-length cdnas of sesquiterpene synthase  were cloned and identified. through mj-inducible expression pattern experiments and gc-ms analysis, we found that their expression was significantly induced by mj, and sesquiterpenes content was elevated accordingly. the expression of a number of important regulatory genes was detected using rt-pcr and indicated that some of them may participate in one or more processes of wound signal transduction, transcriptional regulation of ass, and biosynthesis of agarwood sesquiterpenes. based on the analysis of ass <dig> promoter, we confirmed preliminarily that tfs myb <dig> and wrky <dig> may be key positive regulators of ass <dig> expression. these results provide a better understanding of sesquiterpene biosynthesis and regulation in aquilaria spp., and provide valuable clues and a basis for elucidating the molecular mechanism of agarwood formation.
