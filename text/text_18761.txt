BACKGROUND
batf is a basic leucine zipper transcription factor that dimerizes with the jun proteins to direct patterns of activator protein- <dig> -mediated gene expression in the immune system  <cit> . the impact of disrupting batf function in vivo has been examined by several groups  <cit> . mice in which batf is overexpressed using a t cell-specific promoter display a reduced number of inkt cells  <cit> , an increased number of cd4+ t cells expressing il- <dig>   <cit>  and an altered cytokine environment that promotes the gross overproduction of class switched ig by b cells  <cit> . batf null mice are viable, yet display a severe deficiency in th <dig> and t follicular helper cells  <cit> . the t cell deficiencies are combined with an intrinsic b cell defect blocking the production of class switched ig to impair the immune response of these animals to antigen challenge  <cit> . the dramatic consequences of altering batf expression in vivo provides evidence that batf functions to coordinate immune system activities critical in autoimmunity, inflammation and the host response to pathogens.

the ability of batf to promote the differentiation of naïve cd4+ t cells to the th <dig> lineage has been shown to rely on the formation of irf4/batf protein complexes that bind and transactivate a number of genes, including il17a/f <cit> . interestingly, we have observed a negative influence of batf on the development of inkt cells  <cit>  and therefore sought to examine how these two opposing activities of batf may influence the development of a recently identified subset of inkt cells that expresses il- <dig>  <cit> . murine inkt- <dig> cells are a cd4- nk <dig> - population that is enriched in peripheral ln  and respond following stimulation by rapidly secreting il- <dig>  inkt- <dig> cells express rorγt and additional markers that define them as a lineage distinct from classic inkt cells. a role for inkt- <dig> cells has been demonstrated in experimental models of airway disease, asthma and collagen-induced arthritis  <cit> . inkt- <dig> cells are over-represented in nod mice where their influence in the pancreas exacerbates the development of diabetes  <cit> . in the present study, using mouse models of batf overexpression  and deficiency , we demonstrate the importance of batf to the development of inkt- <dig> cells. despite the overall reduction in the number of inkt cells in cd2-ha-batf mice, the majority express il- <dig>  likewise, while peripheral inkt cell numbers are increased in batfΔz/Δz mice, the cells are deficient in il- <dig> production. these data are consistent with results in th <dig> cells  <cit>  and suggest that batf-containing protein complexes transactivate the il17a/f gene in nkt cells as well. the novel finding is that the function of batf as an il- <dig> inducer is separate from its effect on cell growth since th <dig> cell numbers are expanded in the presence of batf, while inkt cell numbers are reduced. to identify an in vitro system that would facilitate the study of batf-mediated gene regulatory events relevant to the inkt cell lineage, we describe features of the dn <dig> d <dig> hybridoma  <cit>  that indicate similarity to the inkt- <dig> lineage, including the batf-dependent expression of il17a mrna. we conclude that batf joins rorγt as the molecular signature for all il- <dig> producing cells in vivo and represents an essential component of a nuclear protein network that could be targeted to regulate il-17-mediated disease.

RESULTS
batf controls cd4+ th <dig> cell differentiation
to test if cd2-ha-batf tg mice display the increase in il- <dig> expression reported for a separate model of batf overexpression in vivo  <cit> , splenocytes were stimulated with anti-cd <dig> and anti-cd <dig> antibodies and rna isolated after 48 h. for comparison, cells from non-tg  and batfΔz/Δz mice were used. gene expression analysis by quantitative rt-pcr revealed the expected high level of il17a mrna in tg cells and undetectable levels of il17a mrna in batfΔz/Δz cells . to implicate altered th <dig> development as the major contributor to this change in il17a expression, naïve cd4+ splenocytes from tg, wt and batfΔz/Δz mice were subjected to in vitro protocols skewing differentiation toward the th <dig> lineage or toward th <dig> cells as a control. differentiation was assessed by measuring the expression of genes specific for these cd4+ t cell subsets. as shown in figure 1b, levels of th <dig> associated transcripts  were statistically similar across all samples, while levels of th <dig> associated transcripts  were elevated in tg samples and essentially undetectable in batfΔz/Δz samples . these findings in cd2-ha-batf mice confirm a positive role for batf in the differentiation of th <dig> cells.

levels of batf correlate with altered inkt cell numbers in vivo
mice overexpressing batf in thymic t cells  display a reduced number of inkt cells  <cit> . interestingly, quantification of thymic inkt cells in batfΔz/Δz mice revealed a number equivalent to wt mice  <cit> . as the cd2-ha-batf transgene directs batf overexpression to all t cells   <cit> , inkt cells were re-examined and compared to numbers in wt and batfΔz/Δz mice. the percentage of t cells positive for interaction with glycolipid-loaded cd1d tetramers was assessed by flow cytometry using single cell suspensions from thymus, spleen and pln. whether calculated on the basis of percentage  or absolute number , the results confirm that inkt cells are under-represented in the thymus of tg mice and extend that observation by showing fewer inkt cells in the spleen and pln as well. these data confirm that batf deficiency does not impact the inkt cell population in the thymus, yet do reveal, for the first time, that batfΔz/Δz mice possess a statistically significant increase in the number of peripheral inkt cells.

in previous studies, we reported that the residual inkt cells in p56lckha-batf mice were disproportionately cd44+ nk <dig> - and concluded that batf negatively influences inkt cell expansion and maturation  <cit> . however, recent studies have identified an important sub-population of nk <dig> - inkt cells that are fully mature and function in the periphery to regulate autoimmunity, inflammation and the host response to infection  <cit> . to profile nk <dig> - versus nk <dig> + inkt cells in tg, wt and batfΔz/Δz mice, the flow analysis was repeated to include an evaluation of nk <dig> . as shown in figure 3a, tg mice with a reduced number of inkt cells show a higher percentage of nk <dig> - cells in all tissues. conversely, batfΔz/Δz mice show no bias in the distribution of nk <dig> - versus nk <dig> + inkt cells in thymus and spleen, but a bias toward nk <dig> + in pln. a graphic representation of the findings from pln highlight the influence of batf levels on the distribution of nk <dig> + versus nk <dig> - inkt cells in the periphery .

batf regulates the production of il- <dig> by inkt cells
peripheral nk <dig> - inkt cells respond rapidly following stimulation and produce large quantities of il- <dig>  <cit> . these cells are considered a distinct lineage and are designated as inkt- <dig> cells  <cit> . the fact that inkt cells in cd2-ha-batf mice are predominantly nk <dig> -, together with the observation that tg animals display increased il- <dig> expression and cd4+th <dig> cell numbers, suggest that batf may regulate the differentiation of inkt- <dig> cells. to examine cytokine expression by inkt cells, splenocytes from tg, wt and batfΔz/Δz mice were stimulated in vitro with glycolipid antigen  and elisa were performed . as expected, il- <dig> is secreted efficiently by inkt cells in wt and in batfΔz/Δz cultures, but accumulates to a lower level in tg cultures where there are significantly fewer inkt cells . for il- <dig>  the level of il-17a secreted by tg cultures was statistically indistinguishable from wt , indicating that nk <dig> - cells overexpressing batf readily produce this cytokine. on the other hand, il-17a production by batfΔz/Δz cells, where nk <dig> - and nk <dig> + inkt cells are present in roughly equal amounts, is dramatically less than il-17a production by wt cells . these data indicate that not only does batf influence inkt cell numbers, it is a critical determinant of il- <dig> expression by inkt cells. flow cytometric analysis using intracellular staining to detect il-17a in purified, stimulated inkt cells from the pnl of tg, wt and batfΔz/Δz mice provided additional evidence in support of this conclusion .

dn <dig> d <dig> cells model il- <dig> production by inkt cells
irf4/batf protein complexes bind to dna within the mouse il17a/f locus and are essential for the transactivation of the il17a/f gene in th <dig> cells  <cit> . however, the mechanism by which batf functions to regulate gene expression in different cellular contexts, including inkt- <dig> cells where irf <dig> does not play a transcriptional role  <cit> , continues to be investigated. additionally, batf and its interaction partner proteins such as junb and the irf <dig> and  <dig> proteins  <cit> , are expressed independently of il- <dig> status in other t cell lineages  <cit>  and batf-containing protein complexes bind directly to genes where the transcriptional outcome is the inhibition of gene expression  <cit> . these facts complicate proposing a unified model to explain how batf regulates its target genes. therefore, to address the role of batf in regulating il17a and other target genes in inkt cells, we sought to identify an in vitro system that could be used for this purpose.

dn <dig> d <dig> cells are a murine cd4- cd8- inkt cell hybridoma  <cit>  that have been used to investigate the ligand specificity of the inkt tcr  <cit> . in response to stimulation, dn <dig> d <dig> cells express il- <dig>  <cit>  and up-regulate genes  encoding cytokines that define classic, inkt cells . stimulation with αgalcer also leads to the induction of several genes essential for inkt cell development , nrp <dig>  egr <dig>  egr 2)  <cit>  . interestingly, stimulation with glycolipid does not change the level of endogenous batf gene expression, but instead increases expression of the genes encoding the basic leucine zipper dimerization partners of batf  . this up-regulation of jun family members explains the increase in ap- <dig> dna binding observed previously in αgalcer stimulated dn <dig> d <dig> cells  <cit> . stimulated dn <dig> d <dig> cells express rorγt mrna  and a very high level of il17a mrna  which are shared features of the th <dig> and inkt- <dig> lineages. however, dn <dig> d <dig> cannot be classified as true inkt- <dig> cells, as they are nk <dig> + <cit> , express ifnγ mrna when stimulated and do not express il23r . nevertheless, it is worth testing the role of batf as a regulator of il-17a expression in these cells.

toward that goal, dn <dig> d <dig> cells were treated with batf sirna or control sirna, stimulated with αgalcer loaded dimers and after 2 hr, rna was analyzed by qrt-pcr. batf sirna resulted in a 50% reduction in batf mrna expression as well as a corresponding reduction in the level of il17a mrna . these data support a critical role for batf in il17a gene regulation while demonstrating that signaling through the inkt cell tcr expressed by dn <dig> d <dig> cells triggers cooperating molecular events that are required for efficient il- <dig> induction. we conclude that the dn <dig> d <dig> inkt cell line is a convenient in vitro model system in which the details of these molecular events can be investigated further.

CONCLUSIONS
our studies have identified batf as a common regulator of lineage decisions in the murine immune system that involve the expression of il- <dig>  batf joins rorγt in the transcription factor network that promotes the differentiation of il- <dig> expressing cells downstream of pathways triggered by tgfβ and il- <dig> in t cells  <cit>  and by a pathway dependent on tgfβ, but not il- <dig>  in inkt cells  <cit> . these studies have characterized the dn <dig> d <dig> inkt cell line as a model in which the regulation of il17a gene and protein expression by this lineage can be investigated further. as the molecular details controlling il- <dig> production in vivo continue to emerge, new approaches to control autoimmunity, inflammation and infectious disease will become a reality.
