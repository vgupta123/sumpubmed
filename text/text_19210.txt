BACKGROUND
infectious laryngotracheitis virus  is an alphaherpesvirus that causes acute respiratory disease in chickens. this disease causes economic loss in poultry industries worldwide and is a significant concern for animal health and welfare  <cit> . the virus contains a linear, double-stranded dna genome in a herpesvirus type d arrangement. this genome arrangement consists of a unique long region and a unique short region flanked by identical internal and terminal repeat sequences  <cit> , with the short region able to invert with respect to the long region. in previous studies, several regions of the iltv genome of different strains have been sequenced and annotated  <cit> . recently, a full genomic sequence of iltv was assembled by concatenating partial sequences of six different iltv strains  <cit> . however, the whole genomic sequence of a single strain of iltv has not been reported. in this study, the whole genome sequence of a commercial live attenuated vaccine strain of iltv was examined using high-throughput sequencing technology.

RESULTS
sequencing and coverage
genomic sequencing using the solidâ„¢ system generated  <dig>  mb of sequence and  <dig> , <dig> reads. a total of  <dig> contigs were mapped to the virus genome after de novo assembly. a consensus sequence of  <dig>  bp  was generated after assembly of contigs using the concatenated reference sequence. the depth of coverage against the concatenated iltv sequence was greater than 150-fold. this depth of coverage exceeds the level required for precision whole-genome sequencing and demonstrates the suitability of the massively parallel, ligation-mediated sequencing method for herpesvirus genome sequencing  <cit> . although the depth of coverage was sufficient to generate long contigs able to cover the whole genome, a total of  <dig> gaps or regions of ambiguous sequence were detected after de novo assembly. most gaps were less than  <dig> bp in size. while sonication theoretically produces random fragment libraries, some sequences, such as a-t rich regions, have been found to be more susceptible to breakage  <cit> . such weak regions may have been cleaved more frequently during our fragment library preparation, resulting in an absence of high-throughput sequencing data across these regions.

overview of the serva iltv genome
the general features of the serva iltv genome sequence were examined and were consistent with those described in previous genome studies of iltv  <cit> . the genome size of the serva iltv strain was  <dig>  bp, with a g + c content of 48%. the unique long and unique short sequences were  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp in length, respectively, with the unique short sequence flanked by internal and terminal repeat sequences . a total of  <dig> predicted open reading frames  were identified. sixty-five orfs were located within the long unique region, nine within the unique short region, and three pairs of orfs within the repeat regions of the genome. an annotated genome map of the serva iltv strain is shown in figure  <dig> 

comparison of the serva iltv genome with the concatenated iltv reference sequence
comparative analyses showed that the serva strain had the same gene arrangement as that of the concatenated iltv genomic reference sequence . in complete genomic alignment analysis, the serva strain had  <dig> % dna sequence identity with the concatenated sequence. differences between the two sequences were mostly located within the left terminal region of the genome , the middle of the unique long region of the genome  and within the repeat regions  . in the concatenated reference sequence, all these regions were obtained from sa- <dig> iltv, a commercial vaccine strain of iltv produced from an australian field isolate  <cit> . australian strains of iltv may contain different genetic features compared with other iltv strains, due to their evolution in a geographically isolated environment  <cit> . excluding sa- <dig> sequence regions, dna sequence identity between the serva strain sequenced in this study and the concatenated sequence was  <dig> %, containing  <dig> single-nucleotide polymorphisms and  <dig> nucleotide insertions or deletions. this high level of identity is consistent with the stable genome and low mutation rates observed in herpesviruses  <cit> . all nucleotide differences between the concatenated reference and the serva strain of iltv are listed in additional file  <dig> 

four large regions of sequence were absent in the concatenated iltv sequence compared with the serva strain. these included  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp of sequence missing in the ul <dig> and ul <dig> genes, respectively. additionally, in each of the repeat regions the concatenated sequence lacked  <dig>  bp of sequence compared to the serva strain. to verify these findings, pcr was used to amplify the relevant regions of the ul <dig> and ul <dig> genes, and the repeat region of the serva genome. the pcr products were sequenced using sanger sequencing. the results obtained from sanger sequencing were identical to those obtained by the high-throughput sequencing. the predicted translation products of the ul <dig> and ul <dig> genes of the serva strain more closely resembled, and had more conserved domains when compared with, the ul <dig> and ul <dig> homologues from other alphaherpesviruses than the predicted products derived from the concatenated genome sequence . these results support the conclusion that the newly determined additional sequences are genomic sequence of iltv, not sequencing errors. within the left terminal region of the genome, the serva sequence had a  <dig> bp deletion compared to the concatenated sequence .

there were differences in size of more than  <dig> amino acids between the predicted translation products of the ul <dig>  ul <dig>  ul <dig>  ul <dig>  ul <dig> and ul <dig> genes in the concatenated reference sequence and the serva sequence. smaller differences in the predicted sizes of other gene products were also identified . all amino acid differences between predicted translation products in the concatenated reference sequence and the serva sequence are listed in additional file  <dig> 

a bold texts indicate large differences  in the size of predicted gene products

given the conserved nature of the iltv genome, future studies examining the genomic variation between different strains of iltv may represent a strategic approach to examining the molecular pathogenesis of this virus. in particular it would be useful to compare sequence differences between virulent and attenuated strains of iltv, especially within genes already known to be associated with iltv virulence including gc, ul <dig>  gg, gj and tk genes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first complete genomic sequence of an individual iltv strain. a number of differences between this strain and the concatenated reference iltv sequence were identified. significantly, four large missing regions were identified in the published concatenated reference sequence. missing regions of genomic sequence considerably hamper genomic assembly, so the serva sequence assembled in this study represents a much improved reference sequence for future high throughput iltv sequencing studies and comparative genomic analyses.
