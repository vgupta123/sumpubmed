BACKGROUND
the brine shrimp artemia can survive extreme environmental conditions, such as  <dig>  m salinity and fluctuating oxygen concentrations. artemia responds to environmental changes by switching between the two modes of reproduction: ovoviviparity and oviparity, in an oxygen concentration dependent manner. it has a high concentration of haemoglobin in the haemolymph, which also responds to the environment by changes in isoform content. the proposed quaternary structure of artemia haemoglobin  is unique among invertebrates . however, the structure has never been solved conclusively.

the brine shrimp artemia expresses four different types of haemoglobin subunits namely c <dig>  c <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig>  two of these four subunits dimerize in different combinations to produce the three isoforms of the heterodimeric artemia haemoglobin: hbi , hbii  and hbiii . each polymer consists of nine globin domains arranged in a ring and has a molecular weight of approximately  <dig> kda. the mature molecule consists of two polymer rings stacked coaxially and has a molecular weight of approximately  <dig> kda. analysis of translated cdna sequence, and partial trypsinolysis, confirmed that each polymer is made of nine concatenated globin domains, joined together via flexible linkers  <cit> . the orientation between each domain within each polymer was predicted from structural analysis of domain linkers  <cit> , indicating a uniform, ring-like structure, characteristic of a repetitive linear concatenation of globin-like domains.

a linker of typically fourteen residues covalently joins each globin domain within each polymer. the inter-domain linkers contain the consensus sequence vdpvtgl  <cit> . comparisons with pre-a leader sequences of globins from other organisms have led to the hypothetical extended and turn-associated linker structure  <cit> . the amino acid sequences of all artemia inter-domain linkers were demonstrated to resemble closely the pre-a leader sequence of the petromyzon marinus haemoglobin v  <cit>  which has a known 3d structure. the predicted t and c polymer inter-domain linker structures, together with the highly conserved 3d structure of globin-family proteins, suggest a circular polymer structure.

the em image obtained by wood et al.   <cit>  is consistent with the ab initio models of concatenated globin polymers, and with two coaxially stacked polymer rings. the measured sedimentation coefficient and frictional drag coefficient also correlate to this proposed quaternary structure  <cit> . the artemia haemoglobins rarely dissociate into subunits in the absence of detergents even at low concentration. dissociation would be disadvantageous to artemia, as it would cause excretory loss of haemoglobin. research by moens et al.   <cit>  revealed that when hbii was partially digested by subtilisin and analyzed by electrophoresis, bands with molecular weights in multiples of approximately  <dig>  da were formed. the partially digested sample can still bind oxygen non-cooperatively. the result further suggested that the subunits were polymers of myoglobin-like domains joined together by less folded loop-like structures that can be readily digested by proteases under partial proteolysis conditions. intact artemia haemoglobin cooperativity depends on the degree of oxygen saturation, temperature and ph  <cit> .

the exact polymer interfaces and the domain-domain alignments in each artemia haemoglobin isoform remain open questions to date. previous attempts to crystalize the artemia hbii have all been unsuccessful, possibly because of polymorphism in the primary sequence. it has been hypothesized previously that the e and f helices of both polymers were in contact based on the presence of surface-exposing hydrophobic residues  <cit> .

the aim of this research was to find the quarternary structure of artemia hbii, with both the polymer interfaces and domain-domain alignment identified. the technique of ms3d   <cit>  was utilized to achieve the aim. crosslinks were introduced between the subunits of the native hbii molecule. the molecule was then cleaved with trypsin, and the resulting peptides isolated via reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography . the rp-hplc fractions collected were then subjected to esi-ms and significant peak were subjected to esi-ms zoom scan to determine their charges. after charge determination a program called searchxlinks   <cit>  was used to identify putatively crosslinked peaks. these peaks were then subjected to tandem mass spectrometry  to confirm the identity of the peptide. haemoglobin ii was chosen because it is made of one t-type  and one c-type  polymer, which share only 88% sequence identity and therefore have readily distinguishable sequences.

RESULTS
synthesis of egs-crosslinked tryptic hbii fragments
because the egs/trypsin combination had not been used in previous research involving interface mapping by ms3d analysis, it was decided to characterize the digest by electrophoresis. crosslinked proteolytic fragments can be distinguished on gels as banding differences between the crosslinked, trypsin treated sample and the non-crosslinked, trypsin treated sample.

based on the egs+/trypsin- sample , compared with the egs-/trypsin- , the  <dig> kda band was interpreted as crosslinked hbii complex, and the  <dig> kda band as individual hbii subunits. although these molecular weight do not exactly coincide with the actual molecular weights of the hbii molecule and isolated subuits , crosslinking is known to alter migration characteristics of artemia haemoglobins  <cit> . pure hbii  was observed in this experiment, as a band of approximately  <dig> kda, comparable with the subunit molecular weight found by moens and kondo   <cit> .

as shown in figure 1a, a smear is present in the egs+/trypsin+ sample , above  <dig> kda that is absent in the egs-/typsin+ sample . this smear is presumed to be the crosslinked material.

egs decrosslinking
one of the two replicates of egs-crosslinked hbii was decrosslinked by treating it with hydroxylamine-hcl . a major band with molecular weight of approximately  <dig> kda was observed. the  <dig> kda band is consistent with a single hbii subunit . this result indicates that egs-crosslinked hbii complexes were effectively decrosslinked by this method.

gmbs crosslinking and the significance of the result
gmbs is a cysteine to lysine crosslinker with a spacer arm of  <dig>  Å. only four cysteine residues occur in hbii at position  <dig> of the a helices of domains c <dig>  c <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig>  figure 1c shows that inter-polymer crosslinking with gmbs was successful. this indicates that the a helices of the domains in hbii must be near the interface of the two polymer. this is consistent with the result obtained from egs-crosslinking and mass spectrometry.

reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography fractionation
having characterized the egs-crosslinked tryptic fragments by electrophoresis, the next step was to repeat the egs+/trypsin+ experiment but with complete trypsinolysis followed by rp-hplc fractionation. the rp-hplc chromatogram is presented in figure  <dig>  putatively crosslinked peaks identified and subjected to tandem ms analysis and their corresponding rp-hplc fractions are as indicated in figure  <dig>  charge states of the peaks are labeled as the superscript above the m/z ratios of the peaks .

identification of crosslinked lysine pairs: searchxlinks scoring and tandem mass spectra annotations
setting a searchxlinks score threshold of  <dig>  , the three putative peptide species with the highest scores identified  were: gfk-gfk , haisvttk-eaik  and aswnk-atikr  . when the searchxlinks score threshold was reduced to the minimum   and the peptide assignment receiving the best score was taken , five more putative peptide species were identified . findpept analysis again showed that none the peaks showed correlation to trypsin autolytic fragments. tandem ms spectra of the  <dig>  peak and the zoom scan were shown as figure  <dig>  red labels indicate peaks recognized by searchxlinks during the scoring processes. in all cases, many peaks remained unannotated after searchxlinks scoring.

reconfirmations  were done to four of the putative crosslinked peptide assignments including assignment aswnk-atikr, by checking whether any peaks unaccounted for by searchxlinks psd scoring function could be identified. internal ions formed by receiving at least two b and y-type cleavages, and fragment ions formed from complicated fragmentation pathway were identified  .

ions formed from these complicated fragmentation pathways,  were identified. fragment ions of types b/y-co <dig>  y-co and y+h2o were also identified . formations of all these ions are possible according to schilling et al.   <cit> . the program ms2assign  <cit>  considers b or y-ions losing nh <dig>  h2o, co or co <dig>  or gaining of h2o in sequence-independent, and ion-type-independent manners.

the immonium y-ion is  <dig> da lighter than the conventional, ammonium-type y-ion, hence it is referred to as the y- <dig> ion. formation of such y-ions had been theorized by biemann et al.   <cit> . immonium-type y-ions were observed in the  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  tandem mass spectra also.

it was noticed, on the  <dig>  tandem ms spectra  for instance, that peaks identified to be the non-polypeptide-characteristic internal ion peaks or peaks resulting from other complicated fragmentation pathways occupy a significant fraction, although the polypeptide-characteristic b/y-type ion peaks are present. it is therefore important to check whether the polypeptide-characteristic b/y-type ion matches are statistically significant.

the statistical significance of the b and y-type ion matching result can be evaluated according to chen et al.   <cit> . briefly, the probability that a random peak matched to a peak on the theoretical spectrum by chance  can be expressed as:

 θ=τr.

here τ is the sum of matching range of the theoretical spectrum, and r is the observing range of m/z charge ratio. suppose that there are n random peaks, the probability that at least × of them matches, p, can be expressed as:

 p=1−∑k=0x−1θkn−k.

hence the significance score, s, can be defined as:

 s = -ln. 

statistical significances of the  <dig>  and  <dig>  b/y-type ion matching results were measured  using equations ,  and . the theoretical tandem ms spectra of egs-crosslinks gfk-gfk and aswnk-atikr were also calculated. the theoretical tandem ms spectra contain only the polypeptide-characteristic b and y-ion, and the following b and y-ion derivatives b-h2o, bn-1+h2o, b-nh <dig>  y-h2o and y-nh <dig>  subject to the presence of prerequisite amino acids as defined by the developer of searchxlinks. both matching results are significant.

all crosslinked tryptic peptides identified suggest that trypsin can cleave after nhs-ester  crosslinker crosslinked lysine. this seems bizarre, as nhs-ester crosslinked lysine carries no  charge. however, it had been reported that tryptic fragments of such type may be possible  <cit> . the crosslinker used by them, dsg , is also an nhs-ester crosslinker as egs. therefore, it was decided not to reject any egs-crosslinked tryptic peptides identified in which they were formed by receiving tryptic cleavage after egs-crosslinked lysine because egs is an nhs-ester crosslinker.

model construction
a model of the hbii quaternary structure was made using all crosslinked lysine pairs identified, by forcing the ef corners of two chironomus globin iii domains in contact to make a domain pair . then nine such domain pairs were rotated 40° to form a ring with the gh loop pointing into the centre of the ring . the h helices of two adjacent domains in one polymer will mark an angle of approximately 40° . two adjacent domain pairs contact through helix h . therefore, if domain  <dig> of one polymer is interacting with domain  <dig> of the other polymer, late helix e of domain t <dig> can be recruited to close proximity to early helix f of domain c <dig> and vice versa. mid helix h of both t <dig> and c <dig> can also be recruited to close proximity.

the apparent inter-lysine distance between k933tp and k933cp, k720tp and k885cp, k305tp and k32cp and k1023tp and k496cp were measured as  <dig>  Å,  <dig>  Å,  <dig> Å and  <dig>  Å respectively , and all are comparable with the in-solution crossbridge span of egs   <cit> . here k933cp was considered as position  <dig> of helix h while it is actually at position  <dig>  and k1023tp was considered as position  <dig> of helix e while it is actually at position  <dig>  the latter variation is crucial since positions  <dig> and  <dig> of helix e are both hydrophobic phenylalanines on the model chironomus hb structure. in both case, the minor variations are tolerable since artemia hbii domains are unlikely to have exactly the same structure as chironomus domains although they share the globin fold. position  <dig> of helix h is a polar, surface-exposed threonine on the chironomus hb structure used for modelling, and therefore such change does not contradict with the hydrophilic property of lysine. other lysines k933tp, k720tp, k885cp, k305>tp, k32cp and k496cp were all considered as residues at exact positions on the model.

inter-lysine distances between k885cp and k741tp, and between k747tp and k675tp  are both within the maximum egs crossbridge span of  <dig> Å, although they both are beyond the range of the in-solution crossbridge span of egs  . at this stage, all crosslinked lysine pairs identified so far  were accounted for.

there are crosslinks in which we cannot judge whether it is inter-polymer or intra-polymer by sequence alone. in those cases we judged whether such crosslinked peptides are inter- or intra-polymer crosslinks by finding out in which instance the two crosslinked lysines can be placed within  <dig> Å , given that the domains are uniformly orientated in each polymer.

the domain orientations in this model differ from the orientations suggested by trotman et al.   <cit> . according to this model the gh loops of domains point into the tangential direction with respect to a ring-like polymer. this would not be a surprise since the subunit model proposed by trotman was based on the predicted structure of interdomain linkers using lamprey hb pre-a leader structure as a model and not a true linker. however, the similar primary structure of the artemia interdomain linkers, plus the presence of a conformationally-restricted proline at a conserved position may well be an indication that all interdomain linkers have similar tertiary structures, and this in turn hints at a repetitive arrangement of domains. therefore, the uniformly arranged domains assumption features in the previous model .

as a further scrutiny, the apparent cysteine-lysine distance between c178tp  and k28tp  is measured as  <dig>  Å  which is comparable with the maximum gmbs crossbridge span . therefore the model shown as figure 6a and 6b agrees with the gmbs crosslinking results, although it is possible that the crosslink was formed between a different cysteine-lysine pair, or more than one cysteine-lysine pairs are crosslinked by gmbs simutaneously.

taking the 2-domain-pair model shown in figures 5a and 5b, adding one more identical domain pair and forcing this domain pair to interact with its adjacent domain pair in the same fashion as the two domain-pairs shown as figures 5a and 5b gives a domain-pair triplet. the three domain pairs lie on the circumference of a circle and define a 2/3π arc. the  <dig> domain pairs arrange uniformly and repetitively. duplicating this domain-pair triplet three times and joining them into a circle gives a ring of  <dig> domain pairs .

ms3d analysis using cysteine-lysine crosslinker gmbs: scrutinizing the domain 1: domain  <dig>  ef: ef model
hbii samples were crosslinked with gmbs and subjected to partial trypsinolysis under 37°c for  <dig>  hours . additional smear in the trypsin+/gmbs+ lanes can be observed  by comparing both lanes with the corresponding gmbs- lanes , which can be gmbs-crosslinked hbii partial tryptic fragments. bands marked with a red star  may be few daltons heavier than the  <dig> kda bands in lanes  <dig> and  <dig> . these bands may be gmbs-crosslinked hbii partial tryptic fragments, but it is also possible that the small migration difference may be simply due to experimental error.

hbii samples were crosslinked with same amount of gmbs and subjected to complete trypsinolysis under 37°c for  <dig> hours using  <dig> μl of 1× trypsin stock. the digestion mixture was fractionated by rp-hplc. fractions collected were subjected to esi-ms and all  significant peaks were subjected to esi-ms zoom scan to determine their charge states. after searchxlinks analysis , only one peak, the  <dig> + peak , was a genuine crosslinked peak that was unequivocally assigned to gmbs-crosslink avk-gilcsd  . findpept analysis showed that the  <dig> + peak is not a trypsin autolytic product peak. there are three other putative crosslinked peaks, but all of them showed possible correlations to uncrosslinked hbii tryptic fragments with or without gmbs decoration. therefore, only one pair of crosslinked residue can be conclusively identified: c <dig> of c-polymer and k <dig> of t-polymer.

the  <dig>  peak was then subjected to ms/ms , the gmbs-crosslink avk-gilcsd received a score of  <dig>  which is greater than the  <dig>  threshold, and the following polypeptide-characteristic b/y-type ions were identified: b <dig>  y1-h2o, y2-h2o, y <dig>  y4-h2o, y5-h2o, y <dig> and y6-h2o, here y5-h2o and y1-h2o ions have same molecular weight . using equation  <dig>  the probability that these polypeptide-characteristic ions were matched by chance is only  <dig>  and hence the matching is significant . a significant number of peaks remaining unaccounted after searchxlinks scoring were identified, and most of them are internal ions with or without additional losses of h2o, co or co <dig>  ions carrying reverted modified residues were also identified . receiving a b/y-type cleavage at the sidechain-joining peptide bond can regenerate gmbs-modified lysine sidechain. gmbs-modified cysteine sidechains can be regenerated also according to welfing et al. , by a cleavage at the rs-r' bond of the sidechain-joining thioether group.

putting all together, gmbs crosslinked residues were identified to be c25cp and k106tp, rather than c178tp and k32cp as previously guessed. nevertheless, both residues are on domain  <dig> of t and c-polymer and hence agree with the domain 1: domain  <dig> alignment. the domains can be docked in a similar fashion as shown in figure  <dig> while still having c25cp and k106tp positioned at a distance comparable with the maximum crossbridge span of gmbs  . hence, the domain 1: domain  <dig>  ef: ef model was further substantiated by the gmbs ms3d results.

CONCLUSIONS
the aim of this research was to investigate the quaternary structure of artemia hbii, and elucidate the details of domain-domain alignment and the interpolymer interface. the ms3d approach was employed. in total, six putative egs-crosslinked tryptic peptides , and  <dig> gmbs-crosslinked peptide  were identified through the ms3d experiments. four of the seven crosslinked peptides mentioned above exceeded a threshold score of  <dig> , while others appeared only when the minimum threshold score  was applied . the identification of fragment ions carrying portions of egs crossbridge  provided further evidence of crossbridges.

using the chironomus globin iii x-ray structure  as a model, and applying the identified crosslinked lysine pairs showed that by having two globin domains in contact through ef corner, nine such domain pairs could be arranged into a ring with any two adjacent domain pairs contacting through the helix h . domains t <dig> and c <dig> were then forced to align, which produced inter-lysine distances in four of the six crosslinked lysine pairs that were comparable with the in-solution crossbridge span of egs . the other two were within the maximum crossbridge span of  <dig> Å.

the assumption can be made that the domains in each polymer are oriented in the same fashion and hence the two-domain-pair model shown as figure 5a and 5b represents a section of the hbii complex. the model is consistent with the low resolution em image of artemia hbii  <cit>  that suggests the molecule consists of two coaxially stacked ring-like globin polymers .

the diameter: height ratio of the ef: ef, domain 1: domain  <dig> model is about  <dig>  according to figure 4e, which is comparable to the diameter: height ratio of  <dig>  found by wood et al.   <cit> .

this ef: ef domain 1: domain  <dig> model further agrees with the gmbs crosslinking results since k106tp and c25cp can be positioned at a distance comparable with the maximum gmbs crossbridge span   while having the domain orientations comparable to the model shown as figure 5a and 5b.

this model suggests also that the two polymers are stacked in a symmetrical fashion, and therefore explains the dimeric nature of the complex. having the two polymers stacked asymmetrically , would likely mean that polymers would stack infinitely, since t and c polymers both have almost identical tertiary structure and primary structure. however there was no experimental evidence suggesting that t and c polymers can be stacked in this way.

most importantly, having the ef helical region of each domain located at the interface explains the previous finding from sequence alignment studies that surface-exposed hydrophobic residues were observed most frequently at helix e  <cit> . in order to solubilize the complex readily to facilitate efficient oxygen transport in an aqueous environment, these hydrophobic residues need to be buried.

despite the diverse quaternary and primary structures of invertebrate haemoglobins, only one form of oligomeric assemblage, the ef-dimer , has been found in more than one phylum. such ef-contacts are commonly observed in many cooperative invertebrate types of haemoglobin also  <cit> . therefore, the observed ef-contact between the t and c polymers may well explain the cooperative behavior of artemia hbii. although many cooperative types of haemoglobin contain ef-contact between subunits, the cooperativity mechanisms are various  <cit> . therefore, exactly how the ef-contacting between the t and c polymer contributes to the cooperativity of artemia hbii remains an open question.
