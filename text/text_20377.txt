BACKGROUND
post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and viral functions, i.e. regulation on the level of gene-specific rnas usually involve structural and functional domains of cellular mrnas or viral transcripts. for example, the tar element of the human immunodeficiency virus type  <dig> , a sequence stretch of approximately  <dig> nucleotides within the 5′-region of genomic hiv- <dig> rna as well as the 5′-portion of viral mrnas, adopts a thermodynamically stable stem/loop structure that is functionally involved in the regulation of elongation of transcription  <cit> . further, internal ribosomal entry sites, mostly found in viral sequences, form defined structural elements that are necessary for translation of protein-coding transcripts , rna-binding proteins , or low-molecular metabolites like in case of ribo-switches  <cit> . in most cases regulatory rna units are composed of consecutively neighbouring sequence segments and only in rare cases long-range interactions seem to be involved in the formation of regulatory local structures like in ires elements  or certain classes of catalytic rna . particularly simple regulatory modules of limited length such as the tar element, the rre element, or packaging signals of the human immunodeficiency virus type  <dig>  often adopt structural domains that coincide with local minimal energy states  <cit> . studies on the biological role of argonaute  genes in human cells indicate a potential post-transcriptional control step involved in regulating endogenous levels of the family member ago <dig>  <cit> . further, preliminary experimental studies in our laboratory indicate specific binding of rna sequences surrounding the aug start codon of the ago <dig> mrna with proteins involved in rna interference . this attracted us to study the 5′-utr of mrnaago <dig> with regard to potential rna cis-elements. initial computational rna folding studies indicated the existence of two helices formed by consecutive gc base pairs within the 5′-utr and upstream coding sequences which seemed to represent a rare case. here we studied whether the occurrence of gc-rich helices could be biologically relevant. systematic computational and phylogenetic studies as well as experimental evidence in a mammalian cell system support the view that gc-rich duplex motifs formed by distant rna segments, unlike typical hairpin elements, could bear biological functions.

methods
helix definitions
in this study we focused on predicted duplex elements composed of distant sequence segments and set definitions such that they could be distinguished from usual hairpin motifs. hence we first defined two prerequisites, a minimal distance of  <dig> nt between two helix strands and a minimal number of  <dig> bp within this inter-segment region to differentiate helices from hairpin elements as it requires rna structure at a position where a loop is found in hairpin elements. first screens indicated that these conditions result in a very small number of predicted long-range duplexes at a duplex length of greater than or equal to  <dig> bp. it should be noted that the software tool created in this study also accepts any other kind of duplex settings including  the base composition,  different characteristics of the inter-segment sequence which may be longer, shorter or adopt other structures,  and the number of consecutive base pairs included in the duplex of interest. for a more detailed description see additional file 1: table s <dig> 

search for gc-rich double helices
we decided to calculate and analyse the secondary structure space rather than analysing primary sequences for inverted repeats which may form duplex elements. thereby, we assume, false gc-helix predictions can be minimised which may increase the significance of predicted helices compared to merely location of reverse complementary gc sub-sequences. the software tool described and applied here is written in python version  <dig> . <dig> and, additionally, integrates the pyexcelerator library . the source code and a sample data set are available for academic users on request. in this study, mfold version  <dig>  was used for mrna secondary structure prediction, additionally we used mfold  <dig>   and sfold  <dig>    <cit> . however, generally most other rna secondary structure prediction software can be used with our tool as well. mfold  <dig>  was chosen because we found the best match for the structure-function relationship of antisense oligonucleotides  and sirna, respectively by mfold version  <dig>  versus a number of six alternative folding software tools  <cit> . when considering that mrnas  usually serve as target rna for ason and sirna one might conclude that this mfold version predicts local structures of mrna in a reliable fashion  <cit> .

the computational prediction of secondary structure of rna was based on a collection of a large number of folded sequence stretches differing in position or length or both along a given mrna of interest. these stretches are termed ‘window’ here. pools of folded sub-sequences can be defined systematically by sliding a window at a given step width along the sequence to be analysed. predicted local structural elements that occur at high frequency in a large number of folded relevant windows, regardless of neighbouring sequences, turn out to have a greater chance of being meaningfully related to the biology of corresponding rna elements. this approach of analysing rna secondary computationally turned out to produce clearly more reliable results compared with a single fold of the complete long-chain rna sequence of interest. further, in terms of calculation time this concept seems to provide advantages .

in this study, runs with mfold were performed with varying window sizes between  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides at a step width of  <dig> nucleotides for each mrna sequence. ten optimal and suboptimal structures were considered per fold. for example, at a step width of  <dig> nt and a window size of  <dig> nt a rna sequence of  <dig> nucleotides in length  means  <dig> mfold runs resulting in  <dig> overlapping structures. finally, the structures were scanned for helices using the definitions in  <dig> .

automation of mrna secondary structure analysis
the automated identification of duplexes composed of distant segments is illustrated as flow chart in figure 1a. first, a pool of mrna sequences is down-loaded from on-line resources like embl nucleotide sequence database  or ncbi nucleotide . the generated sequence pool contains mrna species of interest for which secondary structures are predicted in a systematic fashion that has been described in detail recently  <cit> . briefly, a long-chain sequence is sub-divided into overlapping sequence segments  starting at position # <dig> and sliding along the complete sequence. secondary structures are predicted and, depending on the step width of the shifting window and its length, a large number of differing structure predictions can be produced. this output of secondary structures is parsed for user-defined duplex motifs and is used for identification of species with specific characteristics such as gc-rich helices formed by distant sequence segments in a non-hairpin like fashion. the user is able to filter hits by setting parameters such as the base composition of the duplex, the range of distance between strands, and the range of duplex length.

region definition of mrna
in this study, mrnas were subdivided into three functional regions , the 5′-region which includes the 5′-utr and  <dig> nt of the upstream coding sequences, the remaining coding region  which spans the remaining cds, and the 3′-utr.

selection of human and non-human rnas
analyses were restricted to mrnas with intact 5′-utr, cds, and 3′-utr. human sequences were chosen randomly from the data bases. furthermore, we included  <dig> sequences, coding for members of the human argonaute protein family. they can be subdivided into five piwi-like  and five ago-like  mrnas  <cit> . in addition, we investigated  <dig> orthologous non-human argonaute mrnas, which originate from the  <dig> organisms pan troglodytes, canis lupus familiaris, bos taurus, oryctolagus cuniculus, drosophila melanogaster, mus musculus, rattus norvegicus, gallus gallus, macaca mulatta, mustel aputorius furo, sus scrofa, xenos puslaevis and danio rerio. many non-human sequences found in data bases were incomplete or labelled ‘predicted’ to the time of this work and were thus excluded. however, we further included additional  <dig> predicted argonaute sequences from pan troglodytes and one predicted sequence from canis lupus familiaris. additionally,  <dig> non-coding rna transcripts from homo sapiens and mus musculus were investigated. we also generated a pool of random sequences by re-shuffling human mrnas while conserving the nucleotide frequencies of their 5'-utrs, cds’s, and 3′-utrs. all sequences used in this study are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

evolutionary conservation
during comparative analyses the structure of paralogs and orthologs of hago <dig> mrna were compared. their duplex content was characterised with respect to  frequency,  location within rna sequences,  duplex length,  nucleotide composition, and  structure of inter-segment sequences.

RESULTS
double helices composed of distant rna segments
although long rna strands may be extensively folded, consecutively base-paired double helices longer than  <dig> to  <dig> bp located outside of hairpin elements  occur rarely in resolved and predicted folding units  <cit> . we studied the occurrence of non-hairpin duplex elements including gc-rich or au-rich helices in a library of human mrna sequences by using this software tool. we consider the library of human rna sequences as representative because they were chosen randomly and include mrna from transcription factors, metabolic regulators, receptors, enzymes, ion channels, carrier proteins, glycol-proteins, structural proteins, heat shock proteins as well as yet uncharacterised cdna sequences. firstly, we retrieved sequences matching the above criteria  and performed secondary structure predictions as described in methods  using a window size of  <dig> nt and a step width of  <dig> nt. finally, the results were screened for duplex elements, i.e. helices according to the definitions described in  <dig> . human mrnas vary in total length which is also true for their domains, i.e. the 5′-utr, cds, and 3′-utr. to account for these variations in length, we describe the helix frequency per  <dig> nt.

when non-hairpin duplexes composed of  <dig> or more consecutive base pairs were considered, a frequency of  <dig>  duplexes per  <dig> nt was found in the examined mrna population. in  <dig> of the evaluated structures  one or more gc-helices were found. the overall gc-helix frequency was  <dig>  helices /  <dig> nt. in comparison, au-helices occur at about the same frequency and were found in  <dig> of the scanned structures . in summary, the sequences analysed in this study showed an average length of non-hairpin double helices of  <dig> ± <dig>  bp .

for gc-helices an average distance between the two complementary strand segments of  <dig> ±  <dig> nt was observed. for au-helices this value was  <dig> ±  <dig> nt and for all helices regardless of base composition we found  <dig>  ±  <dig> nt. these characteristics were similar between human and non-human mrnas. the highest degree of consistency at the inter-species comparison was seen in the 5′-region, which by itself is very rich in gc-helices . for au-helices this agreement is less pronounced.

non-coding rna transcripts and shuffled human mrnas were taken as two separate control groups to test whether the abundance of predicted gc- and au-duplexes in the examined mrna library was non-random. no gc-duplexes of  <dig> or more consecutive base pairs were found in any examined non-coding rna transcript. the gc-helix frequency in the shuffled mrnas was  <dig>  and thus lower by a factor of  <dig> compared to the human mrna population. in contrast, au-duplexes were more abundant in non-coding rna compared to human mrna. while their frequency in shuffled mrna sequences was in the same magnitude as in the mrna population. please refer to additional file 1: table s <dig> for details.

helix location within the mrna sequence
next we wondered whether gc-helices are equally distributed along mrna which we sub-divided into three domains . the nucleotide composition of these domains of the human mrna sequences studied here is summarised in figure 1c. systematic computational analyses of the human mrna sequences and their predicted structures show that gc-helices predominantly occur within the 5′-region of mrnas  while au-helix frequency is much lower and au-helices predominantly occur within the 3′-utr . the distribution of predicted duplex elements within mrnas can be found in additional file  <dig> and a detailed listing of all predicted gc-helices in relation to the start codon is provided in additional file  <dig>  in contrast, the occurrence of duplex elements with mixed base compositions seems to be more balanced between the three regions . replacing the 5′-region by 5′-utr and hence rcds by cds  does not alter these figures substantially. likewise, the distribution of gc-rich helices is similar to that of classical gc-rich stem loops . the uneven distribution of gc- and au-helices between the three defined regions might be related to a certain extent to the base composition of these regions  but it seems to be unlikely that this fully explains the sharp differences of their local occurrence. to test this, we searched for gc- and au-duplex motifs in randomly shuffled rna sequences. here, gc-duplex frequencies are lower than found in the mrna population and their location within the three sequence domains is balanced in the pool of shuffled mrna. the preferred occurrence of gc duplexes in the 5′-region of mrnas was not be observed in case of shuffled mrnas . also au-duplexes occur in a balanced fashion within the three sequence domains in contrast to the mrna sequences, where au-duplexes are preferably located in the 3′-utr. it should be mentioned that the position of gc-rich helices does not coincide with cpg islands on the level of chromosomal dna. in the following we focused on double helices predominantly or exclusively composed of gc base pairs.

gc-helix abundance and gene family
conserved rna structure elements may be involved in biological functions  <cit> . structural and related functional conservation  <cit>  can be supported by comparative analysis between classes of genes and by studying evolutionary conservation. here it became obvious that gc-helices occur in the 5′-utr regions of the three human ago-like mrnas ago <dig>  ago <dig>  and ago <dig> while being completely absent in human piwi-like mrnas. this finding is also true for other vertebrates studied here. hence, the occurrence of gc-helices and their location within the 5′-utr of mrnas of the argonaute gene family might be biologically meaningful.

phylogenetic analysis of gc-helices in argonautes
the accumulation of gc-helices was further studied for orthologous sequences. this study was restricted to  <dig> sequences from  <dig> different organisms  since many non-human sequences found in on-line databases were not suited for our study because of limitations described in the methods section. out of  <dig> orthologous argonaute sequences,  <dig> were gc-helix positive. the ten hits share two criteria: they are of vertebrate origin and their gene class is ago-like argonautes: bos taurus ago <dig> and ago <dig> , mus musculus ago <dig>  and ago <dig>  rattus norvegicus ago <dig>  pan troglodytes two ago-like , as well as, gallus gallus ago <dig>  as there exist only few complete non-human argonaute mrna sequence files, we additionally evaluated  <dig> predicted sequences. however, since they were not determined experimentally, but are estimated from homologue sequences by gnomon , we separated these results from the rest. gc-helices were found in four out of twelve 5′-utr-regions of predicted ago-like mrnas in pan troglodytes.

compatibility with different secondary structure prediction algorithms
compared to the sliding window approach based on mfold  <dig>  , sfold  <dig>  and mfold  <dig>  predict 48% and 31% less gc-duplex motifs of  <dig> or more base pairs in the investigated mrna library, respectively . however, the qualitative finding of this study is independent of the kind of secondary structure prediction algorithm. all three compared algorithms predict that 5′-regions of human and non-human mrnas are rich in gc-helices compared to rcds’s and 3′-utrs, while au-helices are most abundant in 3′-utrs.

in technical terms, on a pc with intel core  <dig> duo cpu e <dig> @  <dig> ghz and  <dig> gb memory, running opensuse  <dig>   folding of a  <dig> nt sequence by mfold  <dig>  takes on average  <dig> min. at a step width of  <dig> nt and a window size of  <dig> nt a rna sequence of  <dig> nucleotides in length means  <dig> mfold runs which all together take about  <dig> min on the same system. this is in accordance with the fact that the underlying mfold algorithm computes in time proportional to the cube of the folded length of sequence. because mfold  <dig>  and sfold  <dig>  computations were performed on on-line servers, we cannot directly compare their performance. however, in case of sfold  <dig>  calculations of  <dig> nt sequences took several days  and in case of mfold  <dig>  the results were ready for down-load after  <dig> min.

a gc-helix within the 5′-region of the ago <dig> mrna is involved in post-transcriptional regulation of ago <dig> gene expression
in order to shed more light on the existence of the predicted gc-helix in the 5′-region of mrnaago <dig> we calculated the local folding potential, a parameter that is often correlated with biologically functional and stably folded domains  <cit> . the local energy minimum related to the folding unit between positions  <dig> and  <dig>  coincides with the  <dig> bp gc-helix depicted in figure 2b. in order to test whether this gc-helix could be involved in regulation of ago <dig> gene expression in functional terms we studied the role of this element in gene expression studies in cell culture as well as its characteristics in protein binding studies in vitro.

firstly, we cloned recombinant plasmids containing the renilla luciferase open reading frame fused downstream to the 5′-utr of mrnaago <dig> termed prl-ago <dig> . for control purposes we used the parental luciferase-harbouring plasmid  or a variant of prl-ago <dig> in which the gc-helices were destroyed by nucleotide exchanges . in order to study possible effects of over-expression of ago <dig> on the 5′-utrago2-luciferase fusion mrna we co-transfected either of these plasmids together with an established recombinant eukaryotic expression plasmid for ago <dig>  into human ecv <dig> cells. the results shown in figure 2d indicate an up-regulation of the 5′-utrago2-luciferase fusion by over-expressed ago <dig> protein but not in the presence of the parental ago2-negative plasmid termed ‘contr’. further, basal expression levels of the 5′-utrago2-luciferase fusion seem to be higher than the levels of controls  which is consistent, to a certain extent, with the assumption that endogenous ago <dig> increases its expression via the 5′-utrago <dig> 

secondly, we performed binding studies with hela cell extracts and in vitro transcribed ago <dig> mrna 5′-sequences or control sequences depicted in figure 2c & d. these studies indicate increased binding of proteins involved in rna interference including ago <dig> itself with the gc duplex-containing sequences of ago <dig> mrna. this observation is consistent with the involvement of the gc duplex of the ago <dig> mrna in post-transcriptional control of gene expression .

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a computational tool to search for duplex rna elements formed by distantly located segments  of complementary rna in a non-hairpin fashion. phylogenetic analyses indicate a non-random occurrence of these structural elements dependent on the base composition of the helical strands in mrnas transcribed from certain genes and gene families. in conjunction with initial biological observations our findings indicate a potential role of gc-rich helices for post-transcriptional regulatory processes within the mrnas of the argonaute gene family.
