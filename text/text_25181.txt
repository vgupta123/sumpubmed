BACKGROUND
the cell walls of land plants and algae provide physical support and protection against various environmental factors and stresses. while much is known about plant cell walls  <cit> , our knowledge of algal cell walls is more rudimentary  <cit> . although it is known, for example, that cell walls of algae and land plants can contain abundant hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins e.g.,  <cit> , studies of the composition and structure of algal cells walls and the diversity of cell wall components within and between algal species lag far behind that of land plants. thus, detailed comparisons of cell wall compositions, synthesis and deposition between land plants and algae  are not presently possible. to help address this deficiency, we sought to develop techniques that would allow identification of cell surface-specific molecules not only in one particular alga, but also in closely related algal species in a variety of environmental locations. monoclonal antibodies raised against such cell wall proteins, glycoproteins and other components have been used in the recent past as a powerful tool for allowing detection and characterization of plant and algal cell wall components  <cit>  and have potential as a highly valuable tool for isolation of algae with shared cell surface constituents. an alternative approach that provides the same single-molecule specificity as conventional monoclonal antibodies involves use of camelid antibodies  <cit>  that are composed of a single heavy chain molecule and used widely as highly specific, high affinity antibodies for numerous applications  <cit> . genes encoding the single-domain antigen-binding fragment  of camelid heavy-chain-only antibodies  can be cloned into bacteriophage-based expression vectors that allow a phage-display library of clones to be “panned” for vhhs against a particular target antigen  <cit> . . individual cloned genes are modified to produce tagged vhh that can be readily detected during elisa assays to measure their affinity for the target antigen or, for example, in the selection of algal species expressing the target antigen on their cell surface. as an initial proof-of-concept for this approach we chose to utilize chlamydomonas reinhardtii  as the alga whose cell wall is the most studied to date  <cit> .

to generate camelid antibodies against chlamydomonas antigens, we immunized alpacas with whole cell extracts of chlamydomonas and prepared phage-display libraries of genes encoding variable-domain  regions of individual single-domain antibodies each having specific affinity to a particular epitope on an individual algal cell antigen  <cit> . from the phage-display library containing vhhs raised against chlamydomonas proteins and other immunogenic molecules, a number of phage clones were selected that bound well to the outer surface of live chlamydomonas cells. subsequently the vhh gene form each selected phage clone was subcloned into an e. coli overexpression vector. the vhh encoding sequence was cloned upstream and in frame with the coding region for an e-tag peptide to allow facile detection of the e-tagged/vhh chimeric protein. characterization of the individual e-tagged nanobodies overproduced in e. coli using standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays  showed that several of these clones bound with moderate to high affinity to proteins and other molecules from cell lysates of chlamydomonas when these antigens were bound to the walls of wells in polystyrene microtiter plates  <cit> .

because each standard elisa assay requires several hours to perform  <cit> , we sought an equally accurate, but faster, more facile and economic means of determining the affinity with which vhhs bound to chlamydomonas cell surface molecules. given that the initial selection of antibodies with specificity for the chlamydomonas cell surface had been conducted with live chlamydomonas cells, we reasoned that it might be possible to develop a modified elisa procedure in which live cells provided the antigens needed for the assay. instead of e-tagged sdabs binding to proteins and other molecules immobilized on polystyrene surfaces to select high affinity vhhs, we hypothesized that we could use a set number of chlamydomonas cells  in individual microfuge tubes containing e-tagged vhh antibodies and then remove non-adhering nanobodies by multiple washing steps involving brief centrifugations and cell suspensions.

in their standard form  <cit> , elisas have proven to be dependable and accurate methods for measuring antibody affinities for specific antigens and for providing estimates of antigen concentrations in samples associated with medical research and practice, agriculture, forensics and industry. an important limitation of the standard elisa protocol is the time required for binding a target antigen to a solid matrix  and the multiple washing steps needed to remove unbound antibodies from the wells of the microtiter dish. in the present study, the standard elisa protocol was recapitulated using a set of microfuge tubes each containing a set number of chlamydomonas cells and that were inoculated with progressively increasing amounts of e-tagged vhhs. the goal was to mimic corresponding antigen-saturated wells in microtiter plates used for standard elisa assays. subsequent steps involving incubation with secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase , addition of a non-chromogenic substrate and spectrophotometric analysis of the chromogenic product of the hrp reaction would be essentially identical to corresponding steps in the standard elisa procedure.

a search of past literature revealed two early examples of development of live-cell elisa assays for use with animal cells. the first  <cit>  involved the use of various types of live human cancer and non-cancerous cells to screen for and characterize monoclonal antibodies with specificity for antigens present on the cancer cells but absent from the surface of non-cancerous cells of the same tissue type. the second  <cit>  also utilized a live-cell elisa to detect antigens specific to different types of cancer cells - in this case, bovine lymphosarcoma cells. more recent examples of live-cell elisa using mammalian cells have been reviewed by lourenço and roque-barreira  <cit> . numerous examples exist of using cells killed by various fixation processes in whole-cell elisa assays, but, as widely recognized, these methods suffer from the fact that the fixation processes involved often alter the structure and, therefore, the antigenicity of the surface molecules that are the targets of investigation  <cit> . our goal in developing a live-cell elisa analysis of algal cells was to offer the algal and microbiology communities a robust and facile new tool for detecting and roughly quantifying populations of micoorganisms bearing cell surface antigens of targeted interest.

here we report success in developing a rapid, small-scale, live-cell elisa assay for algae, demonstrate its equivalence to the standard elisa procedure, employ it to measure the affinity of various vhhs to components of the chlamydomonas cell surface, and show that the high-affinity vhh b <dig> antibody binds specifically to chlamydomonas and to other closely related chlorophycean algae. we also provide visualization of the specificity of binding of vhh b <dig> to the chlamydomonas cell surface by creating and employing vhh b <dig> green or red fluorescent proteins that brightly decorate the exterior of live chlamydomonas cells, but not the surfaces of unrelated algae, during fluorescence microscopy. finally, we employ the live-cell elisa techniques and fluorescently-tagged vhh b <dig> antibodies to demonstrate the presence of wild chlorophycean relatives of chlamydomonas in environmental water samples and the isolation by fluorescence activated cell sorting of individual wild relatives of c. reinhardtii in those water samples.

RESULTS
analyses of candidate vhh nanobodies with the chlamydomonas live-cell elisa
overproduction of each candidate chlamydomonas cell surface specific sdab antibody was achieved by cloning the vhh coding region into the pet32b overexpression vector downstream of coding sequences for thioredoxin a and 6 × his  and upstream of the coding region of an e-tag epitope . the latter allowed for recognition of the vhh by an e-tag-specific antibody conjugated to horse radish peroxidase  whose relative enzyme activity served as a measure of the quantity of sdabs bound to a target antigen in a given assay. each trxa/6 × his/vhh/e-tag chimeric protein was tested for its affinity to antigens present  on the surface of chlamydomonas cells in the rapid, small-scale, live-cell elisa procedure described in detail in methods. the key to the speed of this assay is that it requires less than 30 minutes for the binding of the added antibody to come to equilibrium  and each of two wash steps to remove unbound antibody is accomplished by a quick succession of microfuge centrifugation/cell resuspension steps that, together, consume only 4 minutes. subsequent incubation with e-tag-specific and hrp conjugated secondary antibody, removal of unbound secondary antibodies by two centrifugation/cell resuspension steps, incubation with non-chromogenic  <dig> ′, <dig> ′-tetramethylbenzidine  and measurement of absorbance of the yellow reaction product at 450 nm all require 30– <dig> minutes. based on experience from multiple experiments, this results in a total assay time of less than  <dig>  hours. standard elisas utilize overnight adsorption of antigens to the polystyrene wall of microtiter plate walls with additional manipulations consuming approximately  <dig> to 8 hours.figure  <dig>

analyses of affinities of vhhs to chlamydomonas cell surface molecules
three cell surface-specific sdabs, vhh b <dig>  vhh h <dig> and vhh c <dig> were analyzed with the chlamydomonas live-cell elisa protocol. two nanobodies  displayed ec <dig> levels of  <dig> nm or less, with vhh b <dig> exhibiting the highest affinity ec <dig> <  <dig> nm . vhh c <dig>  displayed markedly higher ec <dig> values and only slightly lower than that obtained with a sdab raised against clostridium botulinum bont/b holotoxin – the vhh used throughout these studies as a negative control . importantly, results of experiments using the chlamydomonas live-cell elisa produced nearly identical ec <dig> values for vhh b <dig>  vhh h <dig>  and vhh c <dig> and vhh bont/b  as obtained with a standard elisa in analyses employed during our original studies  <cit> .figure  <dig>

specificity of vhh b <dig> for chlorophyceaen algae
to determine if vhh b <dig> recognizes all algae, or is restricted to chlorophycean algae, we performed live-cell elisa assays on two heterokonts , nannochloropsis oceanica and thalassiosira pseudonana. when substituted for chlamydomonas in the live-cell elisa, none of these algae exhibited affinities above background levels  . likewise, vhh h <dig> showed affinity only for chlamydomonas when assayed in an analogous experiment . interestingly, we repeated the live-cell elisas with the chlorophycean alga coccomyxa subellipsoidea and did not observe significant affinity. the genome size of c. subellipsoidea that resides in cold polar regions is greatly reduced in size compared to its close chlorophycean relatives found in temperate climates  <cit> . one of the key families of chlorophycean genes lost in its genome are those encoding glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol transamidase that attach cell surface proteins to the plasma membrane  <cit> . whether it is the loss of this gene or another gene that may be responsible for the lack of vhh b <dig> interaction with the cell wall of this chlorophycean species will need to await future determination of the identity of the antigen to which vhh b <dig> binds. however, the ability of the vhh b <dig> antibody to detect differences between cell walls of closely related chlorophyceans from different environments points to the usefulness of camelid antibodies and monoclonal antibodies in helping to define specific differences in cell wall composition between different algae and determining how these differences contribute to ecological adaptation.figure  <dig>

in regard to specificity of vhh b <dig> for chlorophyceaen algae, it should be noted that in studies described below in which several samples of water from natural environments were tested, a number of the samples containing large numbers and varieties of algae tested negative using either vhh b <dig> or vhh h <dig> – again suggesting strong selectivity of these two sdabs for the cell surface of chlamydomonas or chlamydomonas-related algae and not to distantly related algae.

saturation of vhh b <dig> binding with increasing chlamydomonas cell densities
during initial experiments to ensure that an excess of cell surface antigens were present in our live-cell elisas, a set concentration of vhh b <dig>  was used in each of a set of microfuge tubes into which progressively increasing concentrations of live chlamydomonas cells were added . the results of this experiment indicated that slightly less than  <dig> cells/ <dig>  ml were needed to cause all vhh b <dig> molecules to be associated with cell surface antigens . thus, for subsequent live-cell assays, chlamydomonas cell concentrations of approximately  <dig> cells/ <dig>  ml were employed.figure  <dig>

modification of the live-cell elisa for detection of algae in environmental samples
using a modification of our new live-cell elisa protocol we also developed a rapid, small-scale method for obtaining rough estimates of populations of chlamydomonas-related cells  in samplings of algae from natural settings. in these assays, the algal samples were concentrated by centrifugation and resuspended in a mixture of vhh b <dig> and reagents to a cell density the same as used in the chlamydomonas live-cell elisa procedure. after two washings, cells were subjected to the prescribed protocols  for incubation with secondary hrp conjugated e-tag antisera and measurements of enzyme activity. evaluation using the live-cell elisa analysis of ten independent environmental water samples allowed rapid identification of three of these samples as containing appreciable numbers of algae capable of binding vhh b <dig> .figure  <dig>

gfp/mcherry vhh b <dig> chimeras and their use in identifying novel c. reinhardtii-related unicellular chlorophycean aglae
further analyses of algae in environmental samples took advantage of our earlier described  <cit>  coupling of the coding region of the green fluorescent protein  to the 5’ terminus of the vhh b <dig> coding region  to produce a gfp/vhh b <dig> chimera. this chimera could then be used to demonstrate specific binding of the antibody to the cell surface of chlamydomonas using confocal microscopy . incubation of chlamydomonas with gfp vhh b <dig> anti-botulinum toxin nanobody  produced no fluorescently stained cells . incubation of nannochloropsis oceanica, coccomyxa subellipsoidea, and thalassiosira pseudonana with the gfp/vhh b <dig> produced no gfp signal .figure  <dig>

to search for c. reinhardtii or closely related chlorophyceae species in the water samples discussed above, we mixed algae in the samples with an mcherry/vhh b <dig> chimera prior to examination by confocal microscopy. while seven samples failed to yield cells capable of binding the mcherry/vhh b <dig> nanobody, three water samples displaying the highest elisa values  contained a subpopulation of algal cells capable of binding with mcherry/vhh b <dig>  when compared with binding of mcherry/vhh b <dig> to c. reinhardtii cell walls , two algae bound to a nearly equal extent , while the third bound to a distinctly lower extent .figure  <dig>

as further demonstration of the utility of the mcherry/vhh b <dig> nanobodies, we subjected cells from environmental water sample # <dig> to fluorescence activated cell sorting after incubation with mcherry/vhh b <dig>  in so doing, we were able to capture single cells  to which the mcherry-labeled nanobody was bound and culture them on solid medium in preparation for taxonomic classification based on dna sequencing of their 18s ribosomal rna genes .figure  <dig>

species identification of chlorophycean relatives that react with the vhh b <dig> sdab
having identified three strains that strongly react with vhh b <dig> in environmental water samples, we identified the algae by sequencing their ribosomal internal transcribed spacer regions   <cit> . first, to provide additional insurance that each of the three environmental isolates were axenic, we performed multiple rounds of antibiotic washing, dilution, and plating for single clones on tris-phosphate  plates. three or more decontaminated clones of each isolate were pooled prior to its analysis.

after amplification and sequencing of the its <dig> and its <dig> regions and phylogenetic analysis, isolate 2i phylogenetically clusters with several desmodesmus species, where its its <dig> sequence demonstrate it is d. pleiomorphus . interestingly, this is one of the few unicellular biflagellate species of d. pleiomorphus that has been described  <cit> . likewise, strain 2 h phylogenetically clusters with scenedesmus obliquus another taxonomically distinct group of unicellular bi-flagellate algae  <cit> . interestingly, the scenedesmus genus was originally morphologically characterized as being multicellular sheets of cells  <cit> . however with improved molecular phylogenetic techniques, many unicellular bi-flagellates previously placed in other groups have been transferred to scenedesmus and its desmodesmus sub-group  <cit> .figure  <dig>

strain 2f is unique because it phylogenetically clusters with a group of environmental isolates found to be in close association with bryophytes . member of its clade include coelastrella and scenedesmus  <cit> , as well as several mis-identified unicellular bi-flagellate algae . because its closest relative has been positively identified as coelastrealla, we currently classify this strain as such. interestingly, taking a broad view of the phylogeny of these three novel environmental isolates demonstrates that vhh b <dig> broadly binds to cell-wall proteins found in unicellular chlorophycean algae . this demonstrates the broad usefulness of this antibody as a tool for identifying novel unicellular algae, but also suggests broad conservation of the cell wall amongst distantly related unicellular chlorophycean algae.

dna sequences of 18s ribosomal rna gene its <dig> and its <dig> regions used in these studies for construction of phylogenetic maps have been deposited in genbank and accession numbers are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

future studies will focus on use of the vhh b <dig> nanobody to aid in the purification and molecular characterization of the target antigen from chlamydomonas and the three different algal strains described here. the long-term goal will be to use a similar approach for isolation and characterization of additional cell wall/cell surface components that will allow not only comparisons of cell wall composition between related algae but also between cell walls of land plants and the algae from which they were evolutionarily derived.

a significant advantage of the live-cell elisa procedure is that it allows interaction of vhhs with cell surface antigens in their native state. this represents a significant improvement compared to standard elisa procedures in which antigens are adsorbed to the polystyrene surface of microtiter plate wells, a step that often results in protein denaturation. a search of the literature has revealed no previous use of standard elisas or live-cell elisas to identify algae with shared cell wall components. thus, the present study provides the research community with a facile new means for accomplishing this task. there are obvious limitations to the methods as presently described. for example, not all cell surface components will posses sufficient antigenicity to elicit a strong antibody response in immunized animals and, even if tight binding antibodies are obtained, there may be algae in which the target antigen is produced in very low quantities or may produce target antigens that are buried or masked within the cell wall.

CONCLUSIONS
together, the experimental results presented here demonstrate the ability of vhh b <dig> and mcherry-tagged vhh b <dig> to allow detection, isolation and identification of algal cells from various ecosystems that share cell wall and cell surface components with chlamydomonas. these results point the way to future research aimed at discovery of additional cell wall/cell surface components shared by chlorophycean algae and to the initiation of detailed biochemical, molecular and genetic studies of these molecules. more generally, use of the live-cell elisa assay described here and the production of highly specific antibodies, such as the vhhs employed in the present study, have the potential to greatly facilitate future searches of the natural environment for particular species of algae and other microorganisms of interest to a broad range of laboratories around the world.
