BACKGROUND
the plant kingdom is an extensive source of valuable compounds with a wide range of applications, most notably, in medicine. however, the availability of phytochemicals in their natural sources is often limited. in recent years, the efficient production of bioactive plant natural products has mainly been attempted through the metabolic engineering of microorganisms, as exemplified by the successful production of artemisinic acid in yeast  <cit> . although microorganisms are generally considered easier to engineer, plants themselves present a series of advantages as production organisms. for example, they only require soil, water, and sun light for their growth , and their care does not need highly educated personnel or specialized equipment. therefore, there is a growing interest in the metabolic engineering of plants for the production of high-value bioactive compounds. still, pathway engineering in plants is in its infancy and improvements are needed to reach the same level of flux control and yield optimization as seen in microorganisms. part of the explanation for this is that stable plant transformations are notoriously time-consuming, making the challenge of stably engineering a whole biosynthetic pathway - without prior confirmation of feasibility - an endeavour beyond the scope of most research projects.

to obtain fast answers about the feasibility of engineering projects, we have turned to an established protocol for transient transformation of nicotiana benthamiana  <cit> , which has allowed us to rapidly probe the engineering of the sulfur-rich phytochemicals called glucosinolates . apart from being well known as biopesticides, glucosinolates are thought to be the cancer-preventive agents in cruciferous plants  <cit> . recently, we demonstrated the production of benzylglucosinolate  in leaves of n. benthamiana by transient co-expression of five known biosynthetic genes from arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . the accumulation of bgls was, however, concomitant with a disproportionately higher accumulation of a putative intermediate, the glutathione conjugate gs-b . this problem was solved by the discovery of γ-glutamylpeptidase  <dig> , which was able to cleave gs-b in vitro, and whose presence in bgls-producing n. benthamiana leaves led to a strong reduction in gs-b accumulation  and a substantial increase in bgls levels   <cit> . the discovery of ggp <dig> showed that the transient system was not only useful for assessing the feasibility of engineering a given pathway, but also for gene discovery.

although the presence of ggp <dig> in bgls-producing n. benthamiana leaves resolved a major metabolic bottleneck, the increase in accumulation of bgls did not account for the reduction in gs-b accumulation. in fact, only a small portion of the cleaved gs-b was converted to bgls  <cit> . this suggested that an additional downstream bottleneck was present, and that bgls production in this system could be further improved. in the present study, we report the identification of this bottleneck and its alleviation, which led to greatly increased bgls levels. our results are discussed in terms of the heterologous production of glucosinolates and in the general context of pathway engineering.

methods
generation of plant expression constructs
all constructs were assembled in escherichia coli strain dh10b by user cloning of coding sequences  into the plasmid pcambia3300-35su  <cit> . the cds of sal <dig>  was amplified by pcr from cdna made from leaves of a. thaliana col- <dig>  the cdss of the remaining genes were amplified from existing cdna clones: apk <dig>  from abrc clone u21470; atps <dig>  from abrc clone u10843; ugt74b1-sur <dig>  from orf2nat  <cit> ; and finally, atsot <dig> , atsot <dig> , atsot <dig> , and paps-s from published cdna clones  <cit> . atsot <dig> has been previously referred to by us as atst5a  <cit> .

transient co-expression in leaves of n. benthamiana
transient transformation of leaves of n. benthamiana was performed using agrobacterium tumefaciens strain gv <dig> and the silencing suppressor p <dig>  <cit> . co-transformations were done by mixing different agrobacterium strains  in equal volumes prior to infiltration , as previously described  <cit> . when comparing the effects of unequal number of strains, a strain transformed with an expression plasmid encoding for gfp  <cit>  was included so as to obtain equal individual ods across different strain combinations.

gls and lc-ms analysis
leaves were harvested at  <dig> dpi by cutting four leaf discs from the agrobacterium-infiltrated area and homogenizing them in  <dig> μl of meoh containing  <dig>  mm sinigrin as internal standard. glucosinolates were quantified by hplc-uv using the desulfoglucosinolate method  <cit>  and bgls amounts were calculated relative to sinigrin using a relative response factor of  <dig>   <cit> . metabolite analysis was performed by lc-ms as previously described  <cit> , and exact masses were obtained using a microtof-q detector .

endogenous n. benthamiana sulfatase activity assay
n. benthamiana leaves infiltrated with agrobacterium harboring atsot <dig> were harvested at  <dig> dpi and homogenized in protein extraction buffer . after centrifugation at  <dig>  <dig> g at 4ºc for  <dig> min,  <dig> μg of soluble protein  was added to  <dig> μl reaction buffer i . the reaction mixtures were incubated at 25ºc for one hour and stopped and extracted by addition of  <dig> μl ethyl acetate. a fraction of the ethyl acetate phase was evaporated and resuspended in acetonitrile. sulfatase activity, represented by the formation of desulfobgls, was quantified by hplc-uv  <cit> .

as a positive control for the extraction of active soluble proteins, a sulfotransferase assay was carried out in parallel by adding  <dig> μg protein from  <dig>  <dig> g supernatant to  <dig> μl of reaction buffer ii . the assay mixtures were incubated at 25ºc for one hour and stopped by addition of  <dig> μl of methanol. sulfotransferase activity, represented by the formation of bgls, was quantified by hplc-uv using the desulfoglucosinolate method  <cit> .

RESULTS
metabolite analysis of bgls-producing n. benthamiana
we performed lc-ms analyses of extracts from agrobacterium-infiltrated n. benthamiana leaves producing bgls. the analyses confirmed that, when ggp <dig> is present together with the rest of the bgls enzymes   <cit> , the peak of the glutathione conjugate gs-b was almost completely eliminated . however, two major peaks appeared instead . based on ms <dig> fragmentation patterns  and exact mass determination , these peaks were annotated as desulfobgls  and malonylated dbgls . the identity of the dbgls peak was confirmed by comparison to an authentic standard . mean dbgls content at  <dig> dpi was quantified to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol/mg fresh weight , which is ~five-fold higher than the corresponding bgls concentration. the size of the mdbgls peak was comparable to that of dbgls , but the lack of a standard prevented its quantification.

malonylation of metabolites and xenobiotics is a general plant storage and detoxification reaction, and unspecific malonyltransferases have been previously characterized in nicotiana tabacum  <cit> . the co-occurrence of dbgls and mdbgls could thus readily be explained as a consequence of malonylation of the accumulating dbgls by an unspecific endogenous malonyltransferase. dbgls itself is the last intermediate of the bgls pathway , hence the accumulation of both dbgls and mdbgls suggested that the last reaction of the pathway, i.e. incorporation of sulfate by the sulfotransferase atsot <dig>  constituted a metabolic bottleneck. alternatively, the presence of dbgls in bgls-producing n. benthamiana could be due to the desulfation of intact bgls by an unspecific endogenous sulfatase. however, when we tested soluble protein extracts from n. benthamiana leaves for in vitro sulfatase activity against bgls, we were not able to detect any dbgls . therefore, we focused on the sulfotransferase reaction in the remaining experiments.

testing of alternative arabidopsis desulfoglucosinolate sulfotransferases
a. thaliana ecotype col- <dig> has three desulfoglucosinolate sulfotransferases: atsot <dig>  atsot <dig> and atsot <dig>  all of which were reported to convert dbgls into bgls in vitro  <cit> . the sulfotransferase that we had previously chosen to be part of the 2a multicistronic construct orf <dig> was atsot <dig>  which has the highest kcat/km towards dbgls  <cit> . however, since the preferred in vitro substrates do not always correspond to the preferred in vivo substrates, we tested the ability of atsot <dig> and atsot <dig> to support bgls engineering. moreover, the atsot <dig> derived from orf <dig> carried an n-terminal his-tag as well as  <dig> extra amino acids  in its c-terminus  <cit> . as these additional amino acids might interfere with catalytic functions, we also tested a native version of atsot <dig> in parallel with native atsot <dig> and atsot <dig> 

in order to have an atsot16-free version of orf <dig>  we generated the expression construct gt/sur, which encoded only the glucosyltransferase ugt74b <dig> and the c-s lyase sur <dig> . in addition, three expression constructs encoding for, respectively, native atsot <dig>  atsot <dig> and atsot <dig> were generated  and individually co-infiltrated with orf <dig> , ggp <dig> and gt/sur. we subsequently compared bgls and dbgls accumulation in leaves infiltrated with the different strain combinations. no difference was observed in bgls accumulation, neither between the tagged  and the un-tagged atsot <dig>  nor between the three atsot isoforms . the level of dbgls remained slightly less constant, but more than twice as high as the bgls content in all combinations , which demonstrated that the alternative sulfotransferases could not alleviate the metabolic bottleneck.

the negative control without any atsot gave only a ~50% reduction in bgls production when compared to all other combinations . though reduced, the production of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol bgls/mg fw in the absence of an arabidopsis sulfotransferase shows that endogenous n. benthamiana sulfotransferases were able to catalyze the reaction. this is in agreement with a previous result, where we showed that, upon in vivo feeding of phenylacetothiohydroximate  to wildtype nicotiana tabacum, bgls was produced, thereby demonstrating that the two last steps in the pathway could be catalyzed in a nicotiana species by endogenous glucosyltransferases and sulfotransferases  <cit> . this results supported the hypothesis that the late enzymes of glucosinolate biosynthesis were recruited from general detoxification pathways. nevertheless, and similarly to the present sulfotransferase experiment in n. benthamiana, the presence of an atsot did improve the accumulation of bgls significantly  <cit> .

paps as limiting co-substrate
all known sulfotransferases utilize 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate  as the activated form of sulfate, and the last step of the glucosinolate pathway is no exception. furthermore, sulfotransferase reactions not only produce the sulfated metabolite, but have also adenosine-3',5'-bisphosphate  as a by-product.

paps is biosynthesized from adenosine-5'-triphosphate  and inorganic sulphate  in two enzymatic steps. first, atp sulfurylase  sulfates atp to form aps . second, aps kinase  phophorylates aps to form paps. the phosphate donor for this reaction is another molecule of atp   <cit> . apk is located at an important metabolic branchpoint in sulfur assimilation, because a competing reaction, catalyzed by aps reductase, channels aps into the reductive assimilatory pathway leading to cysteine and, further downstream, to glutathione . after sulfation, the by-product pap is hydrolysed to amp  by a bisphosphate nucleotidase. this reaction is biologically important not only because it removes pap, which is an inhibitor of sulfotransferase reactions  <cit> , but also because amp can then be regenerated to form atp, leading to actual recycling of the adenosine moiety of paps . in arabidopsis, the hydrolysis of pap is most likely catalyzed by the multifunctional protein sal <dig>  <cit> .

in silico microarray-based co-expression databases such as atted-ii  <cit>  and cressexpress  <cit>  are powerful tools for elucidating metabolic networks in arabidopsis. we have previously used such databases to identify genes in the gls pathway  <cit> . in atted-ii, searches were performed using both sur <dig> and cyp83b <dig> as query. atp sulfurylase  <dig> , aps kinase  <dig> , aps kinase  <dig>  and sal <dig>  all of which are likely to be involved in the formation and recycling of paps, were among the top  <dig> co-expressed genes for both queries, in addition to many known gls biosynthetic genes . a similar picture was seen in cressexpress, where apk <dig>  apk <dig> and atps <dig> were among the top five co-regulated genes when five gls biosynthetic genes  were used as query . therefore, we hypothesized that the lack of a highly efficient paps formation and recycling machinery in n. benthamiana prevented the sulfotransferase reaction from being carried to completion.

a relationship between apk genes and gls biosynthesis was recently found by mugford et al., who demonstrated that the arabidopsis apk1/apk <dig> double knockout mutant had reduced levels of gls and accumulated desulfoglucosinolates  <cit> . furthermore, it has been shown that atps <dig>  atps <dig>  apk <dig>  and apk <dig> are regulated by myb transcription factors known to regulate both aliphatic and indolic glucosinolate biosynthesis  <cit> . this further suggested that the formation of paps could be limiting in bgls-producing n. benthamiana leaves.

to test the hypothesis that an increased paps formation and recycling would aid bgls production in leaves of n. benthamiana, we generated individual plant expression constructs carrying the native coding sequences of atps <dig>  apk <dig> and sal <dig>  respectively. however, these three proteins carry predicted chloroplast targeting peptides  and their fusions to fluorescent proteins have been shown to localize to chloroplasts  <cit> , whereas the glucosinolate pathway is proposed to be cytosolic  <cit> . this may pose a problem, as the co-substrate paps would have to be transported very efficiently from the chloroplast to the cytosol, while the by-product pap would have to be mobilized efficiently in the opposite way. as a means to overcome this potential problem, we tested in parallel whether the paps formation and recycling machinery could be established in the cytosol. this was attempted using an atps-apk fusion protein from the marine worm urechis caupo lacking a ctp, also referred to as paps synthetase   <cit> , and a truncated version of sal <dig> without its native ctp, which we named sal1-ctp.

agrobacterium strains harbouring the different paps formation and recycling genes  were infiltrated into n. benthamiana leaves together with strains harbouring the bgls biosynthetic genes, both individually and in selected combinations. in all experiments where apk <dig> was included, the levels of dbgls and mdbgls were reduced > 98% . this was accompanied by a ~16-fold increase in mean bgls levels . atps <dig> and sal <dig> did not affect the content of bgls, dbgls or mdbgls any further, indicating that the endogenous atps and bisphosphate nucleotidase activities sufficiently support a highly increased paps formation and recycling, and that only the apk activity was limiting. the accumulation of bgls, dbgls, and mdbgls in the presence of paps-s and sal1-ctp, both lacking ctps, did not differ from the accumulation seen with the plastid localized apk <dig>  this suggests that the shuttling of paps and pap across chloroplast membranes was not a limiting factor. in the presence of apk <dig>  mean bgls levels reached  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol/mg fw at  <dig> dpi. this is equivalent to the total gls levels in rosette leaves of arabidopsis col- <dig> before bolting  <cit> .

discussion
in this study, we have successfully optimized the heterologous production of bgls in leaves of n. benthamiana, reaching glucosinolate levels that are equal or higher than those observed in plants that produce glucosinolates naturally. the optimization was enabled by the identification of a bottleneck in the last biosynthetic reaction, the transfer of sulfate to dbgls by a sulfotransferase. the bottleneck was resolved solely by co-production of apk <dig>  an enzyme that converts the intermediate aps in the sulfur assimilatory pathway into the sulfotransferase co-substrate, paps.

in mammalian systems, where numerous xenobiotics follow sulfation-dependet detoxification routes, sulfate transfer has been described as a high-affinity, low-capacity process  <cit> . the identification of the sulfotransferase bottleneck in our engineered bgls pathway indicates that sulfate transfer is also a low-capacity process in non-cruciferous plants. however, the exact reasons for the low capacity are different. in rats and mice, the limiting factors appear to be the availability of sulfate and the sulfotransferases themselves  <cit> . because the sulfotransferase problem in n. benthamiana was completely solved by co-expressing apk <dig>  the provision of paps was clearly the limiting factor .

even under paps-limiting conditions, the addition of either atsot resulted in increased bgls accumulation as compared when only endogenous n. benthamiana sulfotransferases were available. this increase can be speculated to be even more pronounced under paps unlimited conditions . conversely, it was not possible to determine any difference in the performance of the three atsots under paps-limiting conditions, and future studies could therefore focus on determining the optimal atsot for production of specific gls in the presence of apk <dig> 

the finding that apk <dig> alone could resolve the sulfotransferase bottleneck also demonstrates that other paps-related activities, namely atps and bisphosphate nucleotidase activities were not limiting either. this likely reflects that the two latter enzymes participate in important paps-independent pathways. atps synthesizes the central sulfur assimilation intermediate aps, which can either be used in the reductive sulfur assimilation pathway leading to cysteine and glutathione or converted into to paps by an apk. in turn, bisphosphate nucleotidases not only hydrolyze pap, but also inositol polyphosphate  <cit>  and have been linked to numerous physiological processes such as salt, cold, and drought tolerance  <cit> , rna silencing  <cit> , and leaf morphogenesis  <cit> .

although usually drawn as a linear pathway, the glucosinolate pathway is fueled by the co-substrates nadph, glutathione, udp-glucose, and paps  <cit> . while the three former co-substrates are used in many ubiquitous processes in primary metabolism, most sulfation processes are considered part of secondary metabolism  <cit> . therefore, the formation and regeneration of nadph, glutathione, and udp-glucose is expected to be under more stringent control than that of paps . this helps rationalizing why efficient glucosinolate production in n. benthamiana does not seem to require the engineering of co-substrates other than paps.

CONCLUSIONS
our study shows that modulation of sulfur metabolism towards enhanced paps biosynthesis enables an efficient heterologous production of glucosinolates in n. benthamiana. this represents an important step towards a clean and efficient production of glucosinolates in heterologous hosts and emphasizes the importance of considering co-substrates and their biological nature in metabolic engineering projects.
