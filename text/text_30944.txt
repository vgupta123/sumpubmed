BACKGROUND
protein-protein interactions play a fundamental role on the assembly of multimeric complexes of in to carry out two-end concerted dna integration  <cit> . retroviral integrase structures are organized in three domains, a central domain that contain the catalytic site , a n-terminal domain  that binds zinc and a c-terminal domain  having a sh <dig> fold  <cit> .

biochemical and genetic studies have shown that the ntd of integrase  is involved in protein-protein interactions favoring protein multimerization and stabilization of the dna-in complex  <cit> . prototype foamy virus  structure shows binding of this domain to ltr  <cit> . a polypeptide containing the first  <dig> amino acids of mo-mlv in, expressed in e. coli, is functionally active since it complements in trans an in mutant lacking the ntd. gel filtration chromatography indicates that this ntd behaves as a dimer in solution  <cit> . similar observations have been made in hiv- <dig> in  <cit> . the 3d structure of hiv- <dig> in ntd, solved by nmr showed the dimer interface is highly hydrophobic and it includes the α-helices  <dig> and  <dig>  and the n-terminal of helix  <dig>  <cit> .

the ntd is essential for 3’ processing and strand transfer, however determining its role in the integration process in lentiviruses and oncogenic viruses has been difficult due to the absence of the full-length structure of in and the complexity of the protein-protein and protein-dna interactions involved in the synaptic complex. several models based on the partial 3d structure of in fragments have been proposed for hiv- <dig> in and asv  <cit> . the x-ray structure of a tetrameric integrase complex of the pfv in and processed u <dig> dna was solved  <cit> . in this complex, the ntds of the external subunits have been located at distal positions of the complex  <cit> , however their structure was unresolved in the crystal structure. the quaternary structure of hiv integrase in solution has been examined by small and wide x-ray angle scattering and chemical crosslinking  <cit> . it has been concluded that integrase can assemble as a tetramer by the interaction of two different dimers: one of them is stabilized by interactions between the ccds of two subunits while the other dimer is stabilized by interactions of one ntd with the ccd, ctd, and ntd of the other subunit. the interaction between the ntds in the latter dimer was detected by chemical crosslinking  <cit> .

a sequence alignment of the ntd of mo-mlv, pfv and hiv- <dig> integrases is presented in figure  <dig>  the ntd of mo-mlv in is  <dig> amino acids larger than the ntd of hiv- <dig> in  <cit> . pfv in also contains an extra region of  <dig> amino acids before the zinc binding domain. since no quaternary structural information for mo-mlv in is available, in this work we explored the use of cross-linking in order to identify lysine residues that are within the range of the cross-linking spacer within the monomer or the dimer on the ntd. cross-linked peptides were identified and sequenced by maldi-tof ms/ms spectroscopy. based on these results and the 3d coordinates available in 3nnq, a model of the ntd dimer was built. this model suggests a parallel arrangement of the ntds.

RESULTS
the ntd of mo-mlv integrase behaves as a dimer in solution according to gel filtration on superose  <dig> and favors multimerization of in  <cit> . in complementation studies it has been shown that addition of an isolated ntd domain to an in construct lacking this domain restores the activities of in. however, there is no information on the structure of the dimer of mo-mlv in solution and how it interacts with the other in domains. in this work we carried out chemical crosslinking to identify lysine residues that were located on the interface of the dimer in order to determine the regions involved in dimerization. this procedure involved the analysis of the crosslinked peptides on the isolated dimer and uncrosslinked monomers by mass spectrometry  <cit> .

chemical cross-linking of in 1– <dig> with bs3
wild type in 1– <dig> and k104c in 1– <dig> were expressed in e. coli and purified by chromatography on ni-nta agarose. the proteins were 95% pure as judged by sds-page . wild type in 1– <dig> was crosslinked with bis suberate  in 50 mm hepes ph  <dig>  at 25°c. figure 2a shows the results of the reaction kinetics using 56 μm of in 1– <dig> and 100 μm bs <dig>  a protein band migrating near 29 kda corresponds to the expected dimer. in order to determine the effect of bs <dig> on in 1– <dig> crosslinking, bs <dig>  was used. the reactions were carried out at 25°c for 35 min and the results are shown in figure 2b. above 200 μm of bs <dig>  other high molecular weight products besides the dimer are observed. 100 μm bs <dig> was used for crosslinking in the following experiments. under these conditions approximately 50% of the protein was crosslinked.

in order to determine the size of the crosslinked protein complex, the crosslinking mixture was analyzed by gel filtration on superdex s- <dig> under nondenaturing conditions. the elution profiles of crosslinked and unmodified in 1– <dig> were almost identical , and the majority of the crosslinked in 1– <dig>  elutes at the same position of the unmodified dimer. this result indicates that, under the conditions of the reaction, intermolecular crosslinking occurs within each dimer and rules out crosslinking between the dimers.

identification of intramolecular and intermolecular crosslinking peptide with bs3
chemical crosslinking combined with mass spectrometry  provides a useful method for inferring sites of protein-protein interactions and for mapping the topology of protein complexes. we used the bi-functional crosslinking reagent bs <dig> that reacts with primary amine groups of lysines and the ntd integrase of mo-mlv. in these experiments in 1– <dig> was crosslinked with bs <dig> and the dimeric and monomeric band was separated by sds-page, subjected to digestion with trypsin or chymotrypsin and analyzed by lc-ms/ms as indicated in materials and methods, being compared with the ms/ms profile of the unmodified in 1– <dig>  sequencing only differential peaks . in these cases only two informative sequences were used and classified as  intramolecular crosslinked peptides  and  intermolecular crosslinked peptides. information about intramolecular crosslinking was obtained from reaction products in which both functional groups of the crosslinker reacted with lysine residues that reside in the same polypeptide chain . these peptides were sequenced by ms/ms and corresponded to the intramolecular crosslinking of:  residues k <dig> and k <dig> in ,  residues k <dig> and k <dig> in lgaydk31tk33k,  residues k <dig> and k <dig> in nitetck95acaqvnask104s,  and residues k <dig> and k <dig> in tlk88nitetckacaqvnask104s. the informative contact position of lysines identified with the looplinks , was used to analyze the 3d crystal structure of the ntd of mo-mlv integrase  in pdb data bank. we used this structure as a template and examined the distances between the crosslinked lysines. a maximum limit for productive crosslinking of  <dig>  Å has been used as a restraint for the distance between the cβ of two crosslinked lysines using bs <dig> <cit> . the distances between the crosslinked lysines were within the  <dig>  Å limit, although the crosslinked k88-k <dig> was near this limit. thus, our results are in agreement with the monomeric structure of the ntd domain in 3nnq .

the distances were defined using swisspdbviewer program.

the distances were defined using swisspdbviewer program.

the next step was to determine the contact zones of the dimeric protein-protein interface, using the information of the reaction products in which the crosslinked functional groups belonged to different polypeptides . figure  <dig> shows the profile of one of these differential peptides obtained after digestion of the dimeric band with chymotrypsin. the peptide was sequenced yielding the sequence tvtdikdltk24lgaiy – tk24l, which contain the crosslinked residues k <dig> and k <dig> suggesting the proximity between both n-terminal ends of the polypeptides. when a similar analysis of the crosslinked protein was carried out using trypsin, a large peptide  was observed  that would correspond to crosslinking between k <dig> and either k <dig> or k <dig> indicated for the mass of the fragment  of  <dig>  m/z. this peptide could not be sequenced by ms/ms due to its large size. however when the crosslinked in 1– <dig> dimer was digested with chymotrypsin, a peptide corresponding to crosslinking of residues k <dig> and k <dig> on each of the polypeptide chains was identified and sequenced . these results indicate that crosslinking occurs between k <dig> and k <dig> of different polypeptides. a third crosslinked peptide was identified after tryptic digestion of the crosslinked dimer in the ms/ms sequences as mk68aller-tlk88nitetck indicating that k <dig> and k <dig> are crosslinked . the intermolecular crosslinking pattern identified shows a particular distribution along the ntd . these results allow us to produce a 3d model and characterize the dimeric interface.

model of the ntd dimer of mo-mlv integrase
3d-dock suite was used to generate  <dig>  possible complexes through the rotation and translation of a mobile monomer , around the fixed coordinates of another 3nnq monomer. this set of possible dimers was filtered using the experimental crosslinking information, to select the complex that agrees with the distance restraint data. a distance of  <dig>  Å between crosslinked lysines was used to select complex candidates. the selected dimers were submitted to an energy minimization protocol in order to optimize steric and electrostatic interactions of the residues involved in the protein - protein interface. all the dimeric structures that satisfied the distance restraints showed a parallel disposition, with the residues involved in the crosslinking distributed in the same longitudinal face of the protein and both polypeptide chains arranged in the same direction. the complex with the more stable interface, according to multidock routine of 3d-dock suite, was chosen as the more probable ntd - ntd dimer. a ribbon representation of the selected model is presented in figure  <dig>  showing the lysine residues that were crosslinked. this model shows a symmetric and parallel orientation of the monomers and two points of contact.  in the first α-helix of the n-terminal domain  and  the fourth α-helix of chain a  with the fourth α-helix of chain b  of the dimer. this parallel arrangement would be mainly stabilized by electrostatic and van der waals interactions, where residues: l  <dig>  d  <dig>  r  <dig> and d  <dig> of monomer a and k  <dig>  l  <dig>  d  <dig> and d  <dig> of monomer b, play the main role in complex stabilization. the complex is characterized for a Δasa of 484 Å <dig>  involving  <dig> residues of the first monomer and  <dig> residues of the second monomer. the gain in Δg of solvation from the protein-protein interaction was estimated by pdbepisa server in  <dig>  kcal/mol .

the solution structure of the isolated hiv- <dig> ntd dimer also exhibits a parallel arrangement  <cit> , however, structural information on isolated ntds of other integrases is not available.

it is generally thought that a tetramer is involved in the integration process. it has been proposed that this tetramer is assembled by two dimers that differ in their conformation. differences in conformation reflect different combinations of interactions between the three domains of the enzyme. crosslinking experiments in solution have revealed ntd-ntd interactions in the tetramer  <cit>  that were not observed in the crystal structure of fragments of hiv- <dig> in or pfv in structure. it has been speculated that this kind of interaction may be related to a “domain swapping” phenomenon in which an interaction between the ntd and ccd domains is substituted by an interaction between the ntds  <cit> . it is possible that this interaction may be evident in the isolated ntds due to the absence of the ccd domain.

cysteine crosslinking
in order to test our model, we performed crosslinking studies introducing cysteine residues at position  <dig> in in1- <dig> . this amino acid residue was chosen because the cα of both k <dig> in the 3nnq dimer is separated by 28 Å. in contrast, the distance between these residues in our model is only 10 Å. therefore crosslinking with bmoe  would be distinguished between both models. the mutant k104c in1- <dig> was obtained by site directed mutagenesis and purified as described in materials and methods. this protein was able to complement a concerted integration assay that used a deletion mutant in lacking the ntd domain . in addition, in 1– <dig> contains two cysteine residues  coordinated with zinc, that are not reactive to n-ethylmaleimide  <cit> . k104c in 1– <dig> protein was crosslinked with bmoe and bm <dig> of  <dig> and  <dig>  Å in length, respectively. figure  <dig> shows that both reagents produced crosslinked dimer of k104c in 1– <dig>  indicating that the sh groups of cysteines are within 8 Å. the estimated crosslinking extent was 65% for bmoe and 70% for bm <dig>  the distance between the cysteines in the 3d coordinates of 3nnq dimer would be more than 28 Å. furthermore in 3nnq both carboxyl ends are separated by interactions with helix  <dig> of the other monomer reducing the flexibility of the polypeptide chain at the position of k <dig> 

in order to confirm that crosslinking was not produced by the reaction between dimers due to the high reactivity of bmoe with sh groups, the crosslinked reaction mixture was further analyzed by gel filtration on superdex s- <dig>  after crosslinking with bmoe most of the protein eluted as a dimer .

CONCLUSIONS
all retroviral integrases contain a hhcc zinc finger motif at the n-terminal domain that is involved in protein-protein interactions, which is essential for retroviral integration. the structure of ntd of hiv- <dig> in has been solved by x-ray crystallography and nmr. however for mo-mlv with a larger ntd domain, the only information available is the deposited x-ray structure 3nnq. the dimeric structure represented in the asymmetric unit of 3nnq fails to explain our crosslinking results. studies of the isolated mo-mlv ntd indicates that the domain behaves as a dimer in solution and as such is active in complementation of the in activities. therefore our aim was to determine the contacting regions of the ntd domain using chemical crosslinking and mass spectrometry to identify the dimer present in solution. identification of intramolecular crosslinks of lysines using bs <dig> as a spacer agree with the conformation of the monomer in 3nnq. however, the intermolecular crosslinking results did not match the interacting regions found in 3nnq dimer.

the current approach to determine protein-protein interaction in the ntd domain of mo-mlv integrase includes the use of the 3d coordinates of the 3nnq monomer and experimental distance restraints obtained using lysines crosslinking and ms/ms sequencing methodologies. we propose a homodimeric model where both polypeptides are aligned in parallel with the β strands away from the interface, formed mainly by helices  <dig> and  <dig> 

our model was tested by cysteine crosslinking with bmoe and as expected a high crosslinking yield was achieved. we expect that this theoretical model could be useful to test other properties of the ntd such as its interactions with the other domains of in and to understand the mechanisms used by this hhcc domains to regulate protein interactions in different contexts.
