BACKGROUND
in spite of success in qtl research for complex traits in livestock species in the last twenty years, location confidence intervals of many qtl are wide, possibly harboring hundreds of genes. this is the major obstacle to finding causative mutations underlying any qtl identified. in addition, fine mapping techniques and positional cloning to reduce the location confidence interval of the initial qtl are time-consuming, especially for livestock species compared to plant and animal models. this is mainly due to a lack of inbred lines, long generation intervals, the cost of maintaining each animal and also the difficulty of producing transgenic or "knock-out" individuals to confirm the causative nature of the mutation of the trait of interest. few mutations underlying qtl have therefore been identified in livestock . several groups have proposed combining qtl detection programs and high throughput transcriptome data to elucidate biological pathways associated with complex traits and their underlying genetic determinants.  <cit> . this new integrative approach, known as "genetical genomics " or "integrative genomics", treats the expression level of each gene present on a microarray as a quantitative trait and use genetic markers to identify genomic regions that regulate gene expression phenotypes. such regions are named eqtl . independently of the context of qtl identification for a complex trait, the eqtl identification approach was first applied in  <dig> by brem et al.  <cit>  in order to understand the genetic architecture of natural variations in gene expression in yeast. this approach was soon extended to eukaryotes  <cit> . an eqtl region close to the physical location of a gene controlled by this region is referred to as a cis-eqtl  <cit> . in such a case, a mutation in the gene itself might be responsible for variability in its own expression at the mrna level. when an eqtl region for a given gene maps to a location on the genome other than the localization of this gene, it is referred to as a trans e-qtl. very little is known of the molecular nature of cis-acting and  trans-acting eqtl regions.

in the context of qtl identification for a complex trait, gg studies have mainly been undertaken on plant or animal models such as flies  <cit> , mice  <cit> , rats  <cit> , eucalyptus  <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit> . gg is not yet usually used because it requires skills in both genetic and genomic fields and the cost of microarray is high, which can be a real limitation for gg in which several animals have to be analyzed. the present study aims at testing the microarray contribution to a qtl research program in livestock species in which the population structure and marker density are less favorable compared to animal models to qtl localization . our question was therefore whether gg could be transposed in livestock species to reduce a qtl region of interest and to provide new functional information about the causative mutation. to answer this question, this study focused on chicken species, with abdominal fatness as the complex trait. although various qtl for the fatness trait have been reported in this species  <cit> , these qtl regions remain wide and no causative mutation has been clearly detected. we chose to apply three complementary strategies integrating transcriptome data in order to improve characterization of a qtl for abdominal fatness  previously detected on the chicken chromosome gga <dig>  with an effect of  <dig> phenotypic standard deviation  <cit> . because of the cost of microarray, the experimental design in the present study included  <dig> birds. preliminary linkage analysis on this design revealed the expected af qtl on the distal gga <dig>  showing that, despite the fairly small size of the experimental design, it is possible to detect qtl with an effect of ~ <dig> phenotypic standard deviation, thus justifying continuing the study. one of the strategies used was based on dissection of the complex trait using the elementary gene expression profiles, as first performed in  <dig> by schadt et al.  <cit> . to the best to our knowledge, no study using this approach has been published since this first report. the second strategy commonly used by authors working in this context was based on the identification of genes with eqtl co-localizing with the qtl responsible for the complex trait of interest. the function of such genes can provide new functional information about the candidate positional and functional gene sought in the qtl region as causative to the trait of interest. only one study conducted in livestock species has been reported using this approach  <cit> . in the present study, we used this strategy in this way in order to characterize the qtl functionally; we also used this strategy in another way using a multiple trait model for qtl analysis in order to refine this qtl region. a third approach was to use hepatic transcriptome profiles to predict for each recombinant offspring the q versus q gga <dig> af qtl allele  inherited from its sire and then to refine the localization of the gga <dig> af qtl after determining the recombination breakpoints.

RESULTS
animal design and microarray setup
previous studies using a three-generation design performed by inter-crossing two experimental chicken lines divergently selected on abdominal fatness have revealed  <dig> qtl for abdominal fatness  on gga <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in male meat-type chickens,  <cit> . different recombinant backcross  <dig>  and bc <dig> males were then produced to refine af qtl on chromosome  <dig> by crossing f <dig> sires heterozygous for these qtl with lean line dams  <cit> . the present study focused on a bc <dig> chicken sire  known to be heterozygous for the af qtl on the chicken distal gga <dig> chromosome, the other qtl on gga <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were not detected in this family. our aim was to integrate hepatic transcriptome data to refine the location confidence interval of this af qtl on gga <dig> and to characterize it functionally. to reduce the cost of microarray experiments, only  <dig> animals randomly selected for af values from the  <dig> bc <dig> male offspring were studied. using a  <dig> k chicken oligo array ,  <dig> gene expression measurements were obtained from the livers of these animals. one microarray was discarded from the  <dig> because of lower hybridization signals, confirming the good quality of the technical procedures , and leaving a total of  <dig> birds for further study. fifty-five percent of the  <dig> genes  were selected as expressed in the liver , among which a human ortholog with a hugo symbol for  <dig> genes was determined. the raw and normalized microarray data were deposited in the gene expression omnibus  public repository  <cit> . the accession number for the series is gse <dig> and the sample series can be retrieved with accession numbers gsm <dig> to gsm <dig> 

preliminary linkage analysis on this  <dig> offspring subgroup revealed the expected af qtl on the distal gga <dig> with a significant effect of  <dig>  phenotypic standard deviation and no qtl on gga <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  its location confidence interval  extended from  <dig> cm to  <dig> cm, with the most probable location at  <dig> cm. this ci was in agreement with the 165- <dig> cm ci previously detected in a f <dig> design of  <dig> birds  <cit> . the overall strategy to improve characterization of the distal gga <dig> af qtl is shown in figure  <dig> and began with first selecting genes correlated with the trait of interest.

selection of  <dig> genes "correlated" with the af trait
six hundred sixty genes were found to be "associated" with the af trait by analysis of their correlation with af  or their differential expression between the  <dig> fattest and  <dig> leanest birds out of the  <dig> . despite the absence of correction for multiple tests, principal component analysis  generated with the  <dig> transcript levels showed appropriate separation between fat and lean chickens on the two principal components, explaining 30% of the data variance .

approach 1: refining gga <dig> af qtl by dissection of the af complex trait using the  <dig> gene-set transcriptome profiles
this approach aimed at "dissecting" the af trait by separating the offspring into homogenous subgroups using the  <dig> transcript profiles. we performed two-way hierarchical cluster analysis  on the  <dig> offspring and the  <dig> genes related to af. the double hca presented in figure 2a distinguished four bird groups. initial observation of these subgroups showed that most of the  <dig> leanest birds were in subgroup  <dig>  whereas the  <dig> fattest birds were distributed randomly. we then performed separate qtl analyses on the population, removing one or two groups from the four. as shown in figure 2b, linkage analysis on af with the gga <dig> markers using groups  <dig> and  <dig> showed a slight increase in lrt  at  <dig> cm, which contributed to a small reduction in the location confidence interval for gga <dig> af qtl from  <dig> cm- <dig> cm  to  <dig> cm- <dig> cm . this qtl vanished by linkage analysis of subgroups  <dig> and  <dig>  interestingly, the linkage analysis with two subgroups  <dig> and  <dig> suggested an af qtl at  <dig> cm on gga <dig>  we previously detected this qtl using a larger experimental design   <cit> . the addition of subgroup  <dig> to subgroups  <dig> and  <dig> made this qtl significant  with an effect on the af trait of  <dig>  phenotypic standard deviation. no af qtl was detected for other subgroup combinations on gga <dig>  gga <dig> or gga <dig> 

in order to improve the understanding of the characteristics of the subgroups obtained by hca, we calculated  the probability of each offspring receiving from its sire the q or q haplotype for the two qtl at  <dig> cm and  <dig> cm; we considered only birds having a probability >  <dig>  . for the two af qtl detected, the animal labels on figure 2a show the distribution of birds for which the af value was in disagreement with the paternal q/q haplotype. a large proportion of these birds were included in subgroups whose suppression allowed an increase in power of qtl detection . these results may explain the better power of linkage analysis using this "subgroup" strategy.

approach 2: refining distal gga <dig> af qtl by eqtl mapping
selection of genes correlated with the af trait and having an eqtl colocalizing with gga <dig> af qtl
out of the previously selected  <dig> genes, we identified  <dig> genes  that had an eqtl  that colocalized with the location confidence interval of the gga <dig> af qtl . among the  <dig> genes analyzed,  <dig> genes  had an eqtl that mapped in the gga <dig> af qtl. therefore, using the  <dig> genes correlated with the af trait led to a 3-fold increase in genes  having an eqtl colocalizing with the gga <dig> af qtl. the same analysis was performed on the other chromosomes , and no enrichment of genes with an eqtl in a particular region of these chromosomes was observed in this  <dig> gene-set, probably because of the absence of other af qtl regions on these chromosomes. as previously observed with the af qtl analysis, the design of  <dig> animals allowed us to detect significant eqtl regions with an effect on an expression trait of about  <dig> within-family residual standard deviation, with probably some false positives . maximum likelihood ratio test  locations of eqtl for the  <dig> previously selected genes were evenly distributed over the 156- <dig> cm location confidence interval of the gga <dig> af qtl. correlations between gene expressions were variable , suggesting different independent gene networks. these results strongly suggested that this  <dig> gene-set reflected at the mrna level the impact of different linked mutations in the location confidence interval of the gga <dig> af qtl.

selection of the genes regulated by the gga <dig> af qtl mutation or a mutation close to it
to select the closest eqtl mutations to the location of the gga <dig> af qtl mutation, we performed  <dig> linkage analyses on the residual af value corrected for each transcript. genes could be sorted by this step according to the degree of correlation between their transcript levels and af trait and/or the high proximity of the maximum lrt location for their eqtl with one of the af qtl. as a result,  <dig> genes out of the  <dig> genes effectively corrected the af qtl .

validation by rt-pcr
because of the high probability of false positives  we needed to validate these results using another method of mrna quantification. expression of the  <dig> genes was quantified by qrt-pcr. the previous results were confirmed for  <dig> genes. this  <dig> gene-set was considered to be the best gene-set giving new information about the position of the causative mutation underlying af qtl and possibly about the impact at the mrna level of this mutation for some of them. we therefore used these  <dig> genes to refine confidence interval of af qtl location and also analyzed their functions to identify those likely to be regulated by the mutation itself.

functional analysis of the  <dig> gene-set
according to the v <dig>  annotation of the  <dig> k chicken oligochip ,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes of interest had a precise gene name: hgmcs <dig>  tcf <dig> and sall <dig>  rigg <dig> and rigg <dig> genes both encode a hypothetical protein. a gene-by-gene bibliography indicated that tcf <dig> and sall <dig> are both transcriptional factors involved in large molecular processes such as b-cell development and pluripotent stem cell generation, respectively. neither seems to be directly involved in lipid metabolism. however, hgmcs <dig>  is clearly involved in lipid metabolism, more precisely in cholesterol synthesis  <cit> .

refining gga <dig> af qtl by mapping of the  <dig> gene-set combined variable
to take advantage of the correlation between the  <dig> expression traits and the af trait and of their eqtl localized close to gga <dig> af qtl, we applied a multivariate model to refine gga <dig> af qtl. qtl detection with such a model can be more powerful and more precise than a single trait detection  <cit> . because multivariate analysis is time consuming, we before generated a new synthetic variable  combining the  <dig> genes. already used in the same context by lan et al.  <cit> , principal component analysis  was appropriate to reduce the dimensions of the gene expression data. we then added together all  <dig> gene variables by weighting them with their pca coordinates on the first axis. the first axis that explained  <dig> % of the data variance effectively separated the  <dig> extreme fat and lean offspring, confirming that the gga <dig> af qtl had a substantial effect on the af trait in this family . note that hmgcs <dig> and rigg <dig> contributed most to this first axis . indeed hmgcs <dig> and rigg <dig> expressions were the most highly correlated with the af trait among the  <dig> gene-set . we then performed qtl detection using a multivariate model  <cit>  considering the combined variable  and af trait. as indicated in figure  <dig>  we then detected a qtl on gga <dig> at  <dig> cm with high significance . no qtl was detected on the other three chromosomes  . the maximum lrt was considerably increased for the multivariate analysis  compared to the univariate analysis with the af trait only . these results led to a reduction of the location confidence interval of gga <dig> af qtl  to 166- <dig> cm ) , thus allowing a substantial reduction in numbers of positional candidate genes .

the next step was to use these  <dig> genes to refine the location of this qtl with another approach .

approach 3: refining distal gga <dig> af qtl by prediction of the paternal q/q gga <dig> af qtl mutation, using the  <dig> gene-set for the recombinant birds
the aim of this approach was to predict the gga <dig> af qtl mutation  for the recombinant animals inherited from the sire, using their transcriptome profiles for the  <dig> gene-set considered to be the best signature of the q/q af qtl haplotype containing the q/q mutation. the principle of this strategy is summarized in figure  <dig>  first, we determined the q versus q haplotype  inherited from the sire for all offspring, using only the marker genotypes in the gga <dig> af qtl confidence interval as information. we thus determined with certitude such a haplotype for  <dig> offspring:  <dig> animals received the paternal qtl q haplotype and  <dig> the q haplotype. for these offspring, the q  haplotype contained with certitude the q  gga <dig> af allele at the causative mutation. second, using the transcriptome profiles for the  <dig> genes previously detected as the best possible signature of the location of q versus q gga <dig> af qtl mutation, we looked for the best gene expression combination discriminating the  <dig> q from the  <dig> q animals using two methods, g.e. discriminant analysis and logistic regression . third, we used the results of this analysis to predict the paternal q versus q allele received by each recombinant animal, using their  <dig> gene-set transcriptome profiles. the two methods gave the same allele prediction with high probability  for  <dig> recombinants out of the  <dig> . to determine recombination breakpoints, we then developed three novel microsatellite markers between seqf <dig> and seqf <dig> at  <dig> and  <dig> cm, respectively, and genotyped the  <dig> most interesting recombinant animals among the  <dig> . as indicated in table  <dig>  the q or q allele prediction for these animals made it possible to refine the ci of the gga <dig> af qtl at  <dig> cm . the physical locations of this interval were  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb  on gga <dig>  this significant reduction was consistent with the reductions obtained by the other two approaches. thus the number of best positional candidate genes was reduced from  <dig> to  <dig> genes, of which  <dig> have a precise gene name . no biological relationships with hmgcs <dig> were clearly identified.

discussion
the first approach consisted of "dissection" of the complex af trait by grouping the offspring in accordance with their  <dig> gene transcriptome profiles. schadt et al.  <cit>  were the first to use this strategy and they improved the significance of a fatness qtl previously detected on a chromosome and even detected a new qtl on another. we found similar results in the present study. first, we found an increase in the lrt of gga <dig> af qtl by using subgroups  <dig> and  <dig>  second, despite the small size of our experimental design , we detected using subgroups  <dig> and  <dig> an af qtl at  <dig> cm on gga <dig>  as previously detected using an experimental design with  <dig> birds  <cit> . these results show the power of the approach. in view of the polygenic influence on the complex traits, the variations in abdominal fatness are probably due to variations in several biological pathways, impacted by multiple mutations acting separately or in interaction. transcriptome data offer the possibility of dissecting such a complex trait in more elementary phenotypes  and therefore make it possible to separate the population into genetically homogenous subgroups using transcriptome profiling. some combinations of subgroups possibly reflect the effects of a precise mutation whereas others reflect the signature of other mutations. in this study, we showed the over representation in some subgroups of birds for which the af value was in disagreement with the paternal q/q haplotype of the two gga <dig> af qtl, thus increasing the qtl detection power when they were removed. these results indicate that the qtl each significantly affect only a subset of the population analyzed. this heterogeneity observed between offspring clearly demonstrates the complexity underlying traits such as fatness. in summary, the  <dig> genes correlated with the af allowed classification of offspring in a relevant way to dissect af qtl on the gga <dig> chromosome, despite the small number of animals analyzed.

to the best of our knowledge, no study using this approach has been published since the first publication in  <dig>  <cit> . our results obtained with a livestock design and those of schadt et al. obtained with mice indicate that the identification of subgroups in a population on the basis of transcriptome profiles would be an effective way to improve the power of qtl detection by linkage analysis.

the second strategy aimed at improving characterization of gga <dig> af qtl by eqtl mapping. such a strategy is widely used in the context of qtl detection of complex traits using transcriptome data  <cit> . the principle is to identify genes correlated with the complex trait that have an eqtl co-localizing with the qtl of interest. most of these authors then focused on genes with a function related to the complex trait and having a cis-eqtl, allowing them to hypothesize that the mutation responsible for the complex trait is in the cis-eqtl gene  <cit> . in our study, no cis-eqtl was detected among the  <dig> genes correlated with the af trait and having an eqtl in the gga <dig> af qtl region. correlation pairs between these genes strongly suggested that these  <dig> trans-eqtl gene expressions were probably controlled by different mutations in the location confidence interval of the gga <dig> af qtl, as previously commented by georges  <cit>  and schadt et al.  <cit> . because the ci of the qtl was large , we therefore selected  <dig> genes that effectively corrected the af qtl , and therefore likely to be controlled by the mutation sought or by a mutation close to it. functional analysis of these  <dig> genes was still limited by the partial functional annotation of genes. however, we identified one gene related to lipid metabolism that could be affected by the mutation sought. this gene encodes hgmcs <dig>  known to be involved in cholesterol metabolism. we have recently shown that its regulation in response to fasting is different in chickens compared to mammals  <cit> . further experiments will be necessary to clarify its role in fatty acid metabolism and its regulation in chickens in order to target a potential regulatory gene in the distal gga <dig> af qtl.

moreover, the whole  <dig> gene-set considered as a signature of the mutation underlying the qtl of interest or a mutation close to it may be useful to refine this qtl using a multivariate model that takes advantage of the correlation between these  <dig> expression traits and af. multivariate analysis combining the cv <dig> variable and the af trait led to a significant increase in maximum lrt compared to the af trait. this result supported the hypotheses of the existence of qtl affecting both af and cv <dig> at the same position or the existence of different close mutations in linkage disequilibrium. we were unable to reach a conclusion with such a small number of animals analyzed. however, this result makes it possible to reduce the location confidence interval of gga <dig> af qtl from 156- <dig> cm  to 166- <dig> cm .

finally, an original approach to refine a qtl region was proposed in this study. we used the same  <dig> gene-set to find the best gene expression combination discriminating the paternal q from q haplotypes  and used it to predict the q versus q mutation received by the recombinant animals. genotyping these birds with additional markers drastically reduced the region to 166- <dig> cm . contrary to conventional approaches used to refine a qtl, such a strategy avoided generating new offspring to test the qtl genotype of the recombinant birds and saved on high levels of genotyping, thus gaining time and saving money. however, it is important to remember that it was based on the relevance of the gene-set considered as the signature of the qtl mutation or mutations close to it.

the gains in power and precision of qtl detection offered by approaches  <dig> and  <dig> were probably limited by the low density of markers and size of the experimental design used in this study . nevertheless, these approaches allowed substantial reduction of the gga <dig> af qtl region . approach  <dig> was more effective , depending on the recombination breakpoints in the recombinant birds. this third approach allowed us to refine the gga <dig> af qtl from 156- <dig> cm  to a most probable location confidence interval of 166- <dig> cm  . it can be seen that this reduction of gga <dig> af qtl region was consistent with the other more limited reductions obtained by the other two approaches. unfortunately, a gene by gene bibliography analysis did not allow us to propose a good functional and positional gene candidate as regulator of hmgcs <dig> and the af trait.

CONCLUSIONS
our results showed the value of using "genetical genomics " to characterize qtl responsible for complex trait variability in livestock. the originality of this study was to propose complementary approaches allowing a reduction of a qtl region and also providing functional information on it. the most common way to use gg in the qtl detection field is to identify an eqtl region colocalizing with a qtl of interest, making it possible to propose candidate genes possibly regulated by the qtl mutation. in the present study, we identified hgmcs <dig> that could be affected by the gga <dig> af qtl. in addition, as previously reported by schadt et al.  <cit>  using a different animal design, we showed that the identification of animal subgroups on the basis of their transcriptome profiles is an effective way to partially eclipse the polygenic effects which interfere in classical qtl analyses. such an approach improves the precision of previously detected qtl and also localizes new ones. finally, the original procedure, consisting of predicting qtl mutation allele for recombinant animals using a haplotype signature based on transcriptome profiles, may lead to drastic reduction of the qtl region. detection of causative gene mutations underlying the gga <dig> af qtl will be further studied by increasing marker density in the qtl region and the number of animals analyzed, the number of recombinants being crucial in qtl detection analyses. because of the availability in the future of high marker density combined with the drastic price reduction of microarrays, larger eqtl experimental designs are expected in livestock and this should accelerate identification of causative genes responsible for economic trait variability.
