BACKGROUND
chlamydia trachomatis is the most common sexually transmitted bacterial pathogen in the united states; infection results in devastating sequelae, including pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. animal models and clinical studies of infected patients have indicated that protective chlamydial immunity is primarily mediated by th <dig> responses  <cit> . the induction of such immunity involves rapid recruitment and activation of certain effector immune cells, specifically th <dig> cells and dendritic cells  into the local genital mucosa to clear the infection, arrest ascending disease, and prevent major complications  <cit> . in addition, certain complimentary b cell functions – principally ab-mediated enhancement of ag presentation – lead to activation of ag-specific th <dig> cells dependent in part by fc-receptor-mediated events  <cit> . thus, both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses are required for long-term protection against chlamydia.

with the major elements of protective anti-chlamydia immunity defined, a number of candidate vaccines have been described  <cit> . chemokines have emerged as important factors and possible mucosal adjuvants that function in lymphocyte activation and recruitment  <cit> . indeed, a qualitative relationship exists between the class of chemokines secreted following infection, the type of immune response  elicited, and the fate of the host following infection  <cit> . the profile of chemokine expression serves as a reliable indicator of immune response type . in this respect, the ccl5-ccr <dig> axis has been demonstrated to be preferentially involved in the activation and function of thl cells  <cit> .

ccl <dig> is secreted by epithelial cells, macrophages, fibroblasts, platelets, and activated t cells  <cit> . this cc chemokine is known to regulate t cell differentiation and polarize th <dig> >> th <dig> subtypes  <cit>  as well as numerous physiological functions of leukocytes including migration. polymorphisms in ccr <dig> and ccl <dig> modulate immune responses as well as susceptibility and progression to hiv- <dig> and aids, respectively  <cit> . we also showed that many of the deleterious complications of genital chlamydial infection, due to th1-mediated inflammation, are not present in individuals with the ccr5Δ <dig> mutation or in ccr5-deficient mice  <cit> . ccr <dig> expression following genital chlamydial infection is followed by an early th1-like response that precedes activation and mucosal recruitment of ag-specific th <dig> cells necessary for clearance of chlamydia  <cit> . these findings indicate that ccl <dig> might be important for inducing protective immunity against chlamydia. however, it is not certain what affect ccl <dig> deficiency would have on chlamydial disease. we tested the hypothesis that ccl <dig> is essential for inducing adaptive mucosal immunity against chlamydia by ab inhibition using a reliable mouse model of genital chlamydial infection. results revealed ccl <dig> supports the induction of th <dig> cytokine and immunoglobulin igg2a as well as iga responses against chlamydia.

RESULTS
expression of chemokines after genital chlamydia infection
ccl <dig>  ccr <dig>  and ifn-γ mrnas were measured by quantitative rt-pcr analysis after genital chlamydial infection. a significant increase in ccr <dig>  ccl <dig>  and ifnγ gene expression in the spleen and iln was observed  <dig> days after genital infection when compared with levels before infection . these mrna levels modestly declined at inductive sites  <dig> days after infection. ccr <dig>  but not ccl <dig> or ifn-γ mrna expression by fallopian tube-, uterus-, and cervix- derived lymphocytes were considerably higher than levels before infection. indeed, ccr <dig> mrna expression by fallopian tube lymphocytes was significantly higher  <dig> and  <dig> days post infection. these data suggest that increases in ccl <dig>  ccr <dig>  and ifn-γ mrna expression during early stages of infection at inductive sites  preceded ccr <dig> expression at effectors sites , uterus, and cervix). the pattern of ccl <dig> and ccr <dig> as well as ifn-γ illustrates how this chemokine axis coincides with both the innate  and adaptive  immune responses to this pathogen and associated inflammation.

proliferative responses of c. muridarum genital infection modulated by ccl <dig> inhibition
we next characterized c. muridarum-specific proliferative responses of t helper cells isolated from the spleen, ilns, fallopian tube, uterus, and cervix,  <dig> days after challenge. cd4+ t cells isolated from these mucosal and systemic immune compartments of c. muridarum-infected and control ab-treated mice exhibited marked increases in ag-specific proliferative responses compared to disease-free  or c. muridarum-infected and anti-ccl <dig> ab-treated mice . notably, systemic and mucosal inductive sites of the spleen and iln, respectively, contained ag-specific cd4+ t cells that significantly proliferated after c. muridarum re-stimulation. these results suggest that ccl <dig> is required for optimal generation of chlamydia-specific cd4+ t cells that proliferate after ag recognition.

ccl <dig> modulation of chlamydia-specific humoral responses
to test the role of ccl <dig> in th1-biased humoral responses to genital infection, we measured chlamydia-specific igg <dig>  igg2a, igg2b, igg <dig> and igm abs in sera as well as ag-specific iga and igg abs in vaginal washes. infected mice that received control ab displayed significantly higher levels of chlamydia-specific serum igg2a, followed by igg2b responses than compared to similar mice that received anti-ccl <dig> ab or mock-infected  mice . analysis of vaginal secretions revealed a significant increase in ag-specific iga ab responses in c. muridarum-challenged mice that received control ab when compared with similar mice that received anti-ccl <dig> ab or uninfected animals. these results indicate c. muridarum infection enhanced th1-biased humoral responses and ccl <dig> blockade attenuated chlamydia-specific igg2a serum responses as well as vaginal iga responses.

t helper cytokine responses and c. muridarum shedding
genital chlamydia infection up-regulated ab responses as well as splenic and iln cd4+ t cell proliferative responses. we next examined whether these effects were mediated in part through t helper cytokine responses. il- <dig> secreted by ag-stimulated splenic cd4+ t cells from infected mice that received control ab was significantly higher than levels from cells isolated from similar mice that received anti-ccl <dig> ab or uninfected mice . the secretion of ifn-γ from splenic, but not iln, cd4+ t cells from c. muridarum-infected and control ab-treated were considerably higher than t helper cells isolated from similar mice treated with anti-ccl <dig> ab or uninfected animals. chlamydial infection of mice lead to the development of cd4+ t cells that significantly secreted il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and gm-csf, but not il- <dig>  in response to c. muridarum re-stimulation. anti-ccl <dig> ab-treated mice infected with c. muridarum resulted in t helper cells with reduced il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and gm-csf secretion following ag re-stimulation when compared to cd4+ t cells from similar mice treated with control ab; however, the secretion pattern of th <dig> cytokine responses by cd4+ t cells isolated from ilns did not significantly change. these results indicate that c. muridarum infection invoked splenic, but not ilns, chlamydia-specific cd4+ t cells that secreted th <dig> cytokines as well as il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and gm-csf, which were reduced by ccl <dig> blockade. the extent of chlamydial infection, determined by c. muridarum detected in cervico-vaginal swabs, was significantly higher in mice receiving anti-ccl <dig> ab treatment than compared to control mice . however, all mice resolved chlamydial infection in <  <dig> days.

discussion
th1-mediated immune responses are essential to control the chlamydial infection  <cit> . it has been shown in previous studies that ccl <dig>  ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> enhance adaptive immunity through th <dig> cytokine and co-stimulatory molecule modulation  <cit> . in this study, we demonstrate some of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of ccl5-mediated chlamydial immunity. importantly, ifn-γ mrna was not significantly elevated  <dig> days after c. muridarum infection. il-12p <dig> mrna expression coincided with ccl <dig>  but typically preceded ifn-γ mrna expression . indeed, early genital clearance of chlamydia has been shown to occur in an il-12-dependent and ifn-γ-independent fashion  <cit> ; so, further studies will be required to dissect the roles of il- <dig> and ccl <dig> in chlamydia clearance and immunity. the present study shows that  <dig> days after genital chlamydia infection, ccl <dig>  ccr <dig>  and ifnγ mrna levels were elevated in inductive sites, while ccr <dig> mrna expression was higher in the fallopian tubes than in the uterus and cervix. to this end, similar yet differential chemokine expression patterns have been reported within anatomically distinct regions  <cit> .

cd4+ th <dig> cells  are critical elements in the immune response, stimulated by an ascending c. trachomatis infection in the female genital tract  <cit> . indeed, studies of chlamydial infection in knockout mice support the importance of class ii mhc, cd <dig>  il- <dig>  ifn-γ, and ifn-γ receptor for chlamydial immunity  <cit> . our data suggest that ccl <dig> interactions are comparably important and mediate the temporal recruitment and activation of t cells to mitigate chlamydial infection through protective mucosal adaptive immunity by enhancing th <dig> >> th <dig> humoral and cellular immune responses.

ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> are also ccr <dig> ligands, but these chemokines were not remarkably elevated compared to ccl <dig>  which was the most abundant ccr <dig> ligand expressed during the early stages  of chlamydial infection. ccl <dig> is an important factor in the homing of lymphocytes that express ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccr <dig> and ccr <dig>  <cit> . it was also demonstrated from our earlier studies that ccl <dig> can increase the proliferation and activation of ag stimulated t lymphocytes  <cit> . these findings coincide with marked increases in ccl <dig> and ifn-γ production by cd4+ t cells during chlamydial infection. it is also plausible that ccl <dig> blockade might reduce the ability of innate immune cells  to respond to c. muriduram challenge. previously, we demonstrated that ccl <dig> inhibition decreased the numbers of nk <dig> + and cd11b+ leukocytes at mucosal effector sites following pneumococcal challenge  <cit> . however, t cells were the primary lymphocyte-subtype that were reduced following ccl <dig> blockade during the hyper cellular response to streptococcus pneumoniae in mice.

genital chlamydia infection of mice enhanced ag-specific abs in serum and vaginal secretions as well as proliferative cytokine responses by cd4+ t cells isolated from systemic and mucosal compartments. high levels of iga in cervical secretions in infected women correlate with low numbers of c. trachomatis shedding and b cells are required to eliminate chlamydia in a secondary infection  <cit> . we have previously shown that ccl <dig> induces ag-specific titers of igg2a, followed by igg2b, igg <dig>  and igg <dig>  <cit> , ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> enhance ag-specific igg <dig> and igg2b responses  <cit> . in this study, chlamydia infection enhanced igg2a ab responses, which were reduced after ccl <dig> inhibition. this highlights the importance of this chemokine in th1-associated ab responses against chlamydia.

the precise cytokine signals required for s-iga production are not completely understood and studies show both th1-and th2-type cell-derived cytokines are important for s-iga production  <cit> . we have previously shown that chemokines like xcl <dig> and ccl <dig> induce iga production  <cit> . the sharp iga ab response generated by chlamydia-infected mice also correlated with the predominant th <dig> >> th <dig> cytokine response induced by this infection, which were reduced by ccl <dig> blockade. these results suggest that ccl <dig> is required in part for optimal chlamydia-specific iga ab responses during c. muridarum infection.

mucosal, but not serum, iga abs were selectively elevated after c. muridarum challenge, presumbably due to the compartmentalized common mucosal immunity system. in particular, iga ab-secreting cells predominantly populate the lamina propria of the mucosa. in contrast, chlamydia-specific igg abs were not detected in vaginal secretions. this confirms other studies that show vaginal chlamydia-specific igg abs are not present at high levels  in vaginal washes after c. muridarum challenge  <cit> . however, intranasal, subcutaneous or transcutaneous immunization using mucosal adjuvants can induce vaginal wash ag-specific igg ab titers that are comparable to those of iga  <cit> .

ifn-γ production is often associated with igg2a production  <cit>  and may account for the systemic humoral responses against chlamydia following vaginal challenge. in the present study, chlamydia infection induced a profound igg2a ab response compared to other igg subclass abs. the analysis of mucosal and systemic responses revealed a bias toward th <dig> >> th <dig> type of responses. while little is known regarding ag-specific cd4+ t cell  secretory responses during chlamydia infection, we show that these t helper cytokines were increased during chlamydial infection. ccl <dig> blockade diminished these cellular responses along with c. muridarum-specific cd4+ t cell secretion of ifn-γ and il- <dig> 

contradictory studies demonstrated the ability of ccl <dig> to promote both th1-and th2-type responses. it was reported that anti-ccl <dig> ab treatment in mice decreased mycobacterial-inducible th2-type lesions while increasing schistosomal-inducible th2-type granulomas  <cit> . however, studies from our laboratory suggest ccl <dig> enhances mucosal and systemic humoral responses through help provided by th1-type cytokines and select th2-type cytokines, with ccl <dig> promoting th <dig> and th <dig> responses  <cit> . the results in the present study suggest that ccl <dig> is required for optimal th <dig> cellular responses against and clearance of chlamydia. these results corroborate our previous findings that ccr5-dependent mucosal immune responses are required for the efficient clearance of genital chlamydial infection, while functional ccr <dig> expression reduces infertility as a pathologic consequence of th1-mediated inflammation associated with infection  <cit> .

the ccl <dig> gene has a number of physiologically relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms that affect its function and expression. in particular, the in <dig> t/c haplotype of ccl <dig> is highly prevalent  in african americans, than compared to americans of european origin , and results in significantly lower ccl <dig> expression  <cit> . this has been attributed to some of the health disparities between these ethic/racial groups; specifically, higher human immunodeficiency virus  susceptibility and faster progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome . similar to the ccr5Δ <dig> polymorphism, the data in this study and others suggest diminished ccl5-ccr <dig> interactions could yield reduced fallopian tube scarring, but could also result in higher transmission/shedding of chlamydia via decreased chlamydial clearance. it is plausible that a host with a modestly compromised innate immune system would on one hand – avoid infertility by mounting reduced th <dig> responses and on the other – be unable to optimally clear a chlamydial infection. this would provide an evolutionary rationale for not only ccr5Δ <dig> and in <dig> t/c ccl <dig> polymorphisms, but also the propagation and transmission of chlamydia. no doubt, demonstration of this postulate will require additional and extensive studies.

CONCLUSIONS
understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that ccl <dig> uses to modulate mucosal immunity is essential to better understanding the pathogenesis of chlamydial infection. we tested the hypothesis that ccl <dig> is essential for inducing adaptive mucosal immunity against chlamydia. we conclude that ccl <dig> supports the induction of th <dig> cytokine and igg2a ab as well as iga ab responses against chlamydia. the suppression of ccl <dig> correlated with delayed clearance of c. muriduram infection, which suggests chlamydial immunity is mediated by th <dig> immune responses driven in part by ccl <dig>
