BACKGROUND
recent advances in our understanding of the physiological and molecular functions of genes have paved the road for investigating functional genomic variation associated with adaptation and speciation in the wild  <cit> . consequently, targeting specific genes and genomic regions of interest - rather than random genomic regions - holds a great promise as a shortcut to identify genes involved in phenotypic variation and adaptive divergence  <cit> . despite a steadily increasing number of completed genome sequences, genomic resources and tools are still very limited for the vast majority of non-model organisms. therefore, ability to develop molecular markers in or around target genes is essential for application of this approach for non-model organisms. in addition, molecular markers associated with functionally important genes are useful in construction of comparative genetic maps, in which they can be exploited as comparative anchor tagged sequence loci  <cit> .

microsatellites or simple sequence repeats  are highly abundant in eukaryotic genomes, accounting for 3-5% of the mammalian genomes  <cit> . owing to their wide genomic distribution, codominant inheritance and hypervariability, they are widely recognized as one of the most powerful molecular markers in the field of genetics. as a result of the widespread use of ssrs, substantial efforts have been made to devise procedures for developing ssr markers  <cit> . in addition, cross-species transfer of ssr primers is commonly attempted in many taxa  <cit> . however, ssr markers developed with conventional approaches are derived from the genome more or less in a random manner. expressed sequence tags  are commonly used as an alternative to genomic libraries as a source of ssr markers  <cit> . ssr markers derived from ests have some advantages over those developed from genomic libraries because est-derived markers can associate with genes of known or putative function, and they exhibit relatively high transferability between closely related species  <cit> . however, ssrs are generally much less abundant in transcribed regions than in non-transcribed regions  <cit>  and found typically only in a few percentage of ests  <cit> . besides, designing primers requires sufficient flanking sequences, resulting in a considerable reduction in number of ests available to develop ssr markers  <cit> . therefore, even if a large est database is available for a target species, ests have limitations as a material for development of ssr markers for specific genes.

one way to obtain ssr markers for specific genes and genomic regions in a given species is to use ssr primers developed for the closest relative with a sequenced genome. however, an obvious limitation of this approach is that mutations in ssr flanking sequences will inhibit cross-species amplification success - a problem that is likely to attenuate with an increasing divergence time  <cit> . in general, success of cross-species transfer is a negative function of the evolutionary distance separating the source and focal species  <cit> . another crucial issue is related to evolution and persistence of ssrs among different species. investigations of ssr conservation have demonstrated that several ssrs are retained not only in closely related species, but also in species that have diverged more than  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . nevertheless, comprehensive surveys of ssr conservation using aligned sequences of different species have rarely been reported  <cit> , making it difficult to estimate the patterns and degree of ssr conservation in different taxa.

for the reasons elaborated above, development of ssr markers for target genes and genomic regions in non-model organisms is challenging. yet, while the closest relative with a sequenced genome is too distantly related to the focal species, one can take an advantage of the increasing number of completed genomes for different species. for instance, as often used in species for which no direct species-specific sequence information is available, conserved sequences in specific genes and genomic regions of interest can be used to design primer sequences applicable to a wide variety of organisms .

teleosts consist of approximately  <dig>  species  <cit> , which correspond to more than half of all living vertebrates. despite a number of features of evolutionary interest and economical importance, genomic resources and tools are still lacking for most teleost taxa. currently, genome sequences are available for five species - zebrafish , three-spined stickleback , medaka , spotted green pufferfish  and fugu   <cit> . the development of genome sequences for three-spined sticklebacks has made great contribution to an understanding of the genetic architecture of several phenotypic traits  <cit> . because three-spined and nine-spined  sticklebacks exhibit similar ecological and morphological characteristics  <cit> , these species provide an opportunity to study whether the same genes or genomic regions are responsible for phenotypic variation of certain traits and adaptive divergence in different lineages. this would facilitate a molecular understanding of the parallel evolution of these species, which have diverged more than  <dig> million years ago - equivalent to 5- <dig> millions of generations  <cit> . a potentially effective strategy to this end would be to develop ssr markers targeting functionally important genes.

the main objective of this study was to develop a large set of ssr markers targeting specific genes and genomic regions for a non-model organism - the nine-spined stickleback - in which genome sequences and ests are not yet available. to this end, two strategies were adopted. first, we tested cross-species utility of  <dig> ssr primer sets for functionally important genes originally developed in three-spined sticklebacks together with  <dig> ssr markers derived from genomic libraries and ests. secondly, we investigated the potential utility of available sequenced fish genomes to develop ssr markers for functionally important genes in nine-spined sticklebacks. to address prospects for this approach, the patterns and degree of ssr conservation were examined in three-spined and nine-spined sticklebacks using their aligned sequences.

RESULTS
cross-species utility of three-spined stickleback primers
out of the  <dig> ssr markers for functionally important genes ,  <dig> showed robust and specific amplification within the expected size range in nine-spined sticklebacks , resulting in a low level  of cross-species amplification. in contrast, amplification success was  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  in the ssr markers derived from genomic libraries  and ests , respectively . the tendency for higher amplification success with the est-derived ssrs than with the genomic ssrs is in agreement with the results of previous studies  <cit>  - finding which has been explained by high sequence conservation in coding regions  <cit> .

factors affecting cross-species amplification success were assessed using the  <dig> ssr markers. a hierarchical generalized linear model  revealed a significant influence of ssr type  on amplification success . in addition, amplification success was significantly affected by primer site . across the three ssr types, amplification success was high for the ssr markers in which both forward and reverse primers were located in exonic regions , whereas it was lower if primers were located either in intronic  or intergenic regions . this effect was particularly obvious for the gene-based ssrs with intronic primers, in which case the amplification success was very low . as for est-derived ssrs, trinucleotide ssrs are the most abundant repeat motif in ests and tend to be found in coding regions, whereas dinucleotide ssrs are often found in untranslated regions  <cit> . the fact that most of the est-derived ssrs used in our study are dinucleotide repeats  suggests that a number of the est-derived ssrs might be located in untranslated regions. while in theory est-derived ssrs should be located in exonic regions,  <dig>  ssrs were located in intergenic regions according to the ensembl genebuild. this inconsistency could be due to artifacts such as prediction errors and contamination of cdna libraries with genomic dna. nevertheless, the result that amplification success tended to be higher for the est-derived ssrs with exonic primers  than for those with intergenic primers  might, at least in part, result from the fact that sequence homology is less in untranslated regions and increase toward the start codon of the coding regions in related species  <cit> .

while the effects of ssr type and primer site were significant, amplification success was not significantly associated with average primer length  or average gc content . similarly, amplification success was independent of differences in gc content  and melting temperature  between primers within a given primer pair. in addition, there was no association between amplification success and expected pcr product size . while the positive effect of average melting temperature appeared to be significant , no clear difference of melting temperature was found among the ssr types. based on these results, it is unlikely that differential amplification success among the three sets of ssr markers stemmed from different primer conditions. in fact, all of the ssr markers were successfully amplified under the same pcr and dna conditions in three-spined sticklebacks. multiple gene copies are known to exist in several functionally important genes  <cit> . rather than primer conditions, divergence of functionally important genes might be the cause of low cross-species amplification success of the gene-based ssrs.

in the gene-based ssrs, polymorphism was found at  <dig> out of the  <dig> amplifying loci . this rate was similar to that observed in the genomic ssrs  and est-derived ssrs . in total,  <dig> out of the  <dig> amplified loci exhibited polymorphism in fennoscandian populations . for the amplified loci, incidence of polymorphism was independent of ssr type , ssr location  and ssr repeat motif . the relatively high proportion of polymorphic loci across the different ssr types and ssr locations suggests that several ssrs are conserved in three-spined and nine-spined sticklebacks. for the polymorphic loci of gene-based ssrs, an average of  <dig>  alleles per locus  were identified in the three populations . this value was equivalent to that obtained in the genomic ssrs  and est-derived ssrs . average heterozygosity varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in the gene-based ssrs, from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in the genomic ssrs and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in the est-derived ssrs among the three populations . micro-checker analyses did not indicate the presence of null alleles, with the possible exceptions of the clcn <dig>  gs <dig>  gac7080p and stn <dig> in the baltic sea, the stn <dig> and gaest <dig> in the lake  <dig> and the gaest <dig> in the pyöreälampi. there was no evidence for deviations from hardy-weinberg equilibrium at any locus in any of the populations.

in general, our results demonstrate that cross-species utility of ssr primers for functionally important genes is less efficient as compared to that of genomic and est-derived ssr markers. this is attributed to limited amplification success rather than a low incidence of polymorphism. therefore, the development of species-specific primers would be necessary for obtaining ssr markers for functionally important genes.

ssr conservation in sticklebacks and marker development
to investigate the potential utility of available sequenced fish genomes for ssr marker development in nine-spined sticklebacks, we surveyed ssrs within and around  <dig> functionally important genes in the three-spined stickleback genome and designed  <dig> primer sets for amplification and sequencing of these ssr regions using the conserved sequences determined by sequenced fish genomes . the pcr product size of respective genomic regions obtained in nine-spined sticklebacks was concordant with that estimated from the three-spined stickleback genome . all of the sequences of nine-spined sticklebacks for the  <dig> regions exhibited the highest blast hit scores in the target regions and high homologies to the sequences of the three-spined stickleback . out of the  <dig> genomic regions representing  <dig>  bp,  <dig> contained at least one ssr in nine-spined sticklebacks . the total number of ssrs observed in these regions was  <dig>  including  <dig> mono-,  <dig> di-,  <dig> tri- and two tetranucleotide motifs . in the three-spined stickleback genome,  <dig> ssrs were found in the  <dig> homologous regions, including  <dig> mono-,  <dig> di-,  <dig> tri- and four tetranucleotide motifs . out of the  <dig> ssrs found in nine-spined sticklebacks,  <dig> were identified at the same locations as those of the three-spined stickleback . in addition,  <dig> out of the  <dig> ssrs exhibited the same motifs as those of the three-spined stickleback , indicating that a large proportion of ssrs are conserved in the genomes of these species. our results also demonstrated that ssrs with di- and trinucleotide repeat motifs are highly conserved but those with mononucleotide repeat motifs are less so . hence, the level of ssr conservation may differ among ssrs differing in repeat motif type.

to further address ssr conservation in stickleback species, we investigated if ssrs randomly derived from genomic libraries of pungitius species are found at the homologous genomic locations of three-spined sticklebacks. for this analysis, we used publicly available ssr and flanking sequences of pungitius pungitius   <cit>  and pungitius sp.  <cit>  - so called the omono-type, which has been regarded as an independent species from pungitius pungitius based on the biological species concept  <cit> . the  <dig> pungitius pungitius sequences  contained one mono- and  <dig> dinucleotide motif ssrs. in the three-spined stickleback genome,  <dig> ssrs were identified in the homologous regions, including one mono- and  <dig> dinucleotide motifs. out of the  <dig> ssrs identified in the three-spined stickleback,  <dig>  exhibited the same motifs at the same locations as in pungitius pungitius . in the  <dig> pungitius sp. sequences  containing  <dig> dinucleotide motif ssrs,  <dig> ssrs were identified in the homologous regions of the three-spined stickleback genome, including one mono- and  <dig> dinucleotide motifs . out of the  <dig> ssrs identified in the three-spined stickleback,  <dig>  exhibited the same motifs at the same locations as in pungitius sp. . the comparative analyses of randomly selected pungitius ssrs in the three-spined stickleback genome further indicated a high degree of ssr conservation in stickleback species.

while several studies have reported conservation of single ssrs between different taxa  <cit> , a comprehensive survey of ssr conservation is limited to a comparison of human  and chimpanzee   <cit> , which have diverged six million years ago  <cit> . according to vowles and amos  <cit> , 70% of human ssrs are homologues in chimpanzees. our results demonstrated that a similar proportion  of ssrs are retained in three-spined sticklebacks and pungitius species despite longer divergence time   <cit>  and much shorter generation times   <cit> .

based on the sequences obtained in nine-spined sticklebacks, species-specific primer sets were designed to amplify  <dig> ssrs targeting  <dig> functionally important genes . among them, polymorphism was identified at  <dig> loci  in fennoscandian populations. on average,  <dig>  alleles per locus  were identified across the three populations . average heterozygosity was  <dig>  in the baltic sea,  <dig>  in the lake  <dig> and  <dig>  in the pyöreälampi . there was no indication for the presence of null alleles, with the possible exceptions of the ppgm <dig> and ppgm <dig> in the baltic sea and the ppgm <dig> and ppgm <dig> in the lake  <dig>  deviations from hardy-weinberg equilibrium were not observed at any locus in any of the populations.

patterns and degree of ssr variability
the level of ssr variability is known to be associated with repeat motifs due to their different mutation rates  <cit> . in addition, cross-species transfer of ssr primers often results in a lower level of ssr variability in a focal species relative to a source species because of ascertainment bias  <cit> . we investigated the patterns and degree of ssr variability using three fennoscandian populations. across the  <dig> polymorphic loci identified in this study, an average number of alleles per locus and average heterozygosity were  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the baltic sea,  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the lake  <dig>  and  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the pyöreälampi, respectively. as expected, the levels of ssr variability were significantly dependent on population. the genome-wide survey indicated that genetic variation of the pyöreälampi is very low, as also shown in a previous study with  <dig> ssr and one insertion/deletion loci  <cit> . in our data set, the levels of ssr variability were not dependent on marker origin, ssr type and ssr repeat motif . however, a significant influence of ssr location on the levels of allele number and heterozygosity was apparent . across the three populations, average allele number and heterozygosity were  <dig>  and  <dig>  in exonic regions,  <dig>  and  <dig>  in intronic regions and  <dig>  and  <dig>  in intergenic regions, respectively. while the level of ssr variability is known to differ between coding and untranslated regions  <cit> , est-derived ssrs tend to show lower variability than genomic ssrs  <cit> . these differences are thought to arise due to heterogeneous distributions of ssr repeat motifs. however, the higher variability in exonic ssrs than in other ssrs is not explainable by an artifact stemming from different repeat motifs because a majority of the polymorphic ssrs were dimeric repeats independently of their location. several lines of evidence suggest that ssr variation may affect various traits and be subject to natural selection  <cit> . while the potential effect of variable mutation rates can not be ruled out, the heterogeneous distribution of ssr variability observed in this study might be ascribable to natural selection.

CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrated that a large proportion of ssrs are conserved in the stickleback species which have diverged from a common ancestor more than  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . therefore, the three-spined stickleback genome can be used to predict ssr locations in pungitius species. our results also suggest that the main limitation of cross-species utility of ssr markers lies in the failure of amplification success probably due to mutations in ssr flanking sequences. while it is possible to predict to some degree the likelihood of amplification success based on the information of primer binding sites, cross-species transferability of ssr primers for functionally important genes is particularly low as compared to that of genomic and est-derived ssr primers. yet, ssr markers can be developed for functionally important genes and target genomic regions using the approach outlined in this paper. this approach should be applicable also to other non-model organisms. the ssr markers developed for functionally important genes should be useful to identify genes responsible for phenotypic variation and adaptive divergence in nine-spined sticklebacks, as well as for constructing comparative gene maps of nine-spined and three-spined sticklebacks.
