BACKGROUND
species belonging to the family chironomidae are widely distributed in areas with temperate climate, and they are important components in the food chains of freshwater lakes. the larvae live in the sediment, which is a repository for many persistent chemicals spread into water. since several chironomus species can be cultivated under laboratory conditions, they are extensively used for sediment toxicity tests, for example sensitivity to dde, copper and silver
. in addition, the salivary glands of chironomus tentans  constitute an exceptional experimental system for in situ analyses of gene expression.

knowledge about gene expression in eukaryotes is central for the understanding of fundamental biological processes and disease mechanisms. gene expression involves a series of sophisticated reactions that include the synthesis of a pre-mrna and its packaging into a well organized pre-mrna-protein complex , the accurate processing of the primary transcript into a mature mrnp, the export of the mrnp to the cytoplasm, and its translation into protein. these processes require the coordinated function of complex multi-component molecular machineries for example
. biochemical and genetic studies in a large number of experimental systems have resulted in the identification and characterization of the individual components of such machineries, which include both proteins and rnas. from these studies, we have learned that the molecules that make up the basic gene expression machineries are evolutionarily conserved for example
 <cit> .

defining the individual components of the gene expression machineries has been the first step in the study of the gene expression pathway. the next essential steps involve studies of protein-protein and protein-rna interactions aimed at defining the architecture of the machineries, as well as analyses of the function of the machineries and their components in vivo. yet another important goal is to understand the regulatory networks that coordinate the different steps of gene expression. successful efforts to study functions and mechanisms have been made, and in many instances these efforts have provided detailed structural and mechanistic information. even so, many questions remain to be answered about the molecular processes of gene expression and about their regulation in the cellular context. a main obstacle is the shortage of methods to study the function of the gene expression machineries inside the cell. in this context, the balbiani ring  genes of ch. tentans are extremely interesting because they constitute one of the few examples of active eukaryotic genes that can be visualized and analysed in the intact cell nucleus
 <cit> .

the br genes are expressed in the salivary gland cells of ch. tentans larvae in a tissue-specific manner
 <cit> . previous studies have proven the value of the br genes for studies of different steps in gene expression, including studies of active chromatin and transcription
 <cit> , pre-mrna synthesis and pre-mrnp assembly
 <cit> , processing of the pre-mrna
 <cit> , and nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of mrnps
. the br genes and their transcripts thus provide unique experimental opportunities for studies of the intranuclear events of gene expression.

an important prerequisite to perform analyses of gene expression in ch. tentans is the access to sequence information for the individual components of the gene expression machineries. it is also important to relate the gene expression machineries in ch. tentans to those present in other eukaryotes in order to assess the evolutionary conservation of the processes under study. with these specific goals in mind, we have determined the genome sequence of ch. tentans. we have used transcriptome sequence data to aid in the identification of the ch. tentans genes, and we have mined the ch. tentans genome in search for genes that code for components of the gene expression machineries. we have also analysed the sequence and structure of the br <dig> puff, and we provide a model for the organization of the chromatin bundles in the active br <dig> locus. in summary, our results validate the generality of ch. tentans as a model system for gene expression studies.

RESULTS
genome sequencing and sequence assembly
genomic dna extracted from a diploid epithelial cell line of embryonic origin
 <cit>  was used for the sequencing and assembly of the ch. tentans genome. this cell line has been in culture for more than 20 years, and has been used extensively in research related to the study of transcription, pre-mrna processing and mrna-binding proteins
. the cell line genomic dna potentially contains mutations introducing differences compared to organismal dna. however, we focus our analyses on the identification of the ch. tentans genes. in this respect, the gene predictions are evidenced by rnaseq data using rna extracted from different tissues and whole organisms at different developmental stages. three different types of genomic dna libraries were constructed and sequenced: illumina paired-end , illumina 5 kb mate-pair , and  <dig> single-end . sequence data amounting to a total of  <dig> gb was obtained . a kmer similarity analysis of quality-filtered reads indicated a relatively high level of heterozygosity, and an estimated size of about 200 mb for the ch. tentans genome . whole-genome shotgun assembly was performed with clc  using the illumina pe reads and the  <dig> se reads, which gave approximately  <dig>  contigs with a total size of 180 mb . post-assembly scaffolding with sspace
 <cit>  using the illumina mp reads slightly increased the total assembly size to 213 mb and improved dramatically the contiguity of the final assembly to an ng <dig> of 65 kb . this estimate of the genome size is similar to previous measurements by microspectrometry
 <cit> , reassociation kinetics
 <cit>  and cytophotometry
 <cit> . the total assembly size of 213 mb is likely to be an overestimate due to the presence of allelic variants in the assembly, and thus we estimate that the size of the ch. tentans genome is approximately 200 mb.table  <dig>

*ng <dig> and ng80: length of the shortest size-ordered contig required to represent 50% and 80% of the estimated genome size, respectively.



the completeness of the assembled genome was evaluated by analyzing a set of  <dig> highly conserved core eukaryotic genes using hidden markov models  as implemented in cegma
 <cit> . more than 97% of the core genes were scored as “complete” in the assembly , and only one core gene was missing , which indicates that the gene space is well represented in the assembly.

repetitive sequences in the ch. tentansgenome
repeat analysis indicated that 10% of the assembled genome is repeated. this fraction was slightly higher, 15%, when assembly-independent quantifications were performed. these results are similar to reassociation kinetics data showing that 87% of the ch. tentans genome sequence consists of single-copy dna
 <cit> . minisatellites and low complexity repeats represent approximately one third of the repetitive fraction of the genome, while the remaining two thirds contain complex repeats. the complex repeats include dna elements as well as very few lines , sines  and ltr  elements. a considerable fraction of the complex repeats could not be reliably ascribed to any known family .

the amount and nature of repetitive sequences varies considerably among the different diptera
 <cit> , and the genome of ch. tentans contains relatively few repetitive elements compared to some major exponents of its order . both the genome of aedes aegypti , the principal vector of yellow fever, and culex quinquefasciatus , the main vector of the nematode wuchereria bancrofti have a high repeat content  and are relatively rich in transposable element
, whereas ch. tentans has very few transposable elements . also transposable elements are well represented in the genome of anopheles gambiae , the major vector of malaria. its euchromatic component contains 16% transposable elements, while its heterochromatin contains 60% transposable elements
 <cit> . the heterochromatic component is characterized by 17% retrotransposons and a general poor expansion of short simple repeats 
 <cit> . this is in contrast to both the ch. tentans genome, in which the fraction of simple repeats represents almost one third of the total repetitive fraction, and the d. melanogaster genome, in which simple repeats occupy a large part of the heterochromatin portion

the genomes of some other chironomus species contain a short tandem repetitive dna element that is characterized by a cla i-restriction site and therefore called “cla-element”
 <cit> . the cla-element is able to transpose under certain circumstances, has a monomer length ranging from  <dig> to 119 bp, is very a + t-rich , and displays numerous palindromic sequences
 <cit> . the genomic concentration of cla-elements is very different in closely related species and subspecies of chironomus
 <cit>  and their localization in the genome are different
 <cit> . blastn analysis conducted on the ch. tentans genome assembly and on a set of 454-reads did not identify any cla-element sequences. this result is in accordance with previous southern blot analyses, suggesting that the presence of cla-elements is restricted in some chironomus species
 <cit> .

transcriptome sequencing and genome annotation
we sequenced poly + rna to characterize the ch. tentans transcriptome. the rna was extracted from a panel of eight samples that represented a variety of tissues and developmental stages. the rna preparations were pooled and sequenced, and we obtained a total of  <dig>  gb in approximately  <dig> million raw read-pairs. the sequences were de novo assembled using trinity, which gave initially  <dig>  transcripts in  <dig>  clusters . with a cut-off at 98% of sequence identity, 69% of all the assembled transcripts could be fully aligned  to the genome assembly, and 91% aligned partially  within single scaffolds. we defined a set of  <dig>  high-confidence  transcripts by selecting the longest transcript per cluster and applying a quality filter that selected transcripts longer than 225 bp that were supported by at least  <dig> sequence reads.table  <dig>

the assembled rnaseq data was used as evidence in ab initio predictions of gene models and alternative splice variants , which resulted in a set of  <dig>  predicted genes. the majority of the genes, 83%, contained introns . the obtained rna sequences, when matched to the predicted genes, formed  <dig>  different transcripts. analyses showed that on average  <dig>  transcripts represented each intron-containing gene, and that these transcripts were splice variants. the average number of introns per gene was  <dig> . the average exon length was 312 bp, which was shorter than the average intron length , and the length of the longest intron exceeded 97 kb. the total gene space including predicted introns and untranslated regions  comprised  <dig>  mb, which corresponds to 36% of the estimated genome size. the coding regions covered  <dig>  mb or 9% of the estimated genome size .

a large fraction  of the introns in the ch. tentans genome were very short , a feature that was previously also noted in d. melanogaster
 <cit> . different mechanisms for intron recognition and spliceosome assembly have been described that depend on the length of the introns and exons involved in the splicing reaction. the abundance of very short introns in ch. tentans suggests that the so-called intron definition mechanism, a mechanism of intron recognition based on interactions between the 5’ and 3’ splice-sites across the intron
 <cit> , is a major mechanism for spliceosome assembly in ch. tentans.

the average gc content for the ch. tentans genome is 31%, which is somewhat lower than that of other dipterans such as an. gambiae 
 <cit>  or d. melanogaster 
 <cit>  . the gc content of the coding regions, 37%, was considerably higher than the average for the genome, whereas the introns and the intergenic regions were characterized by lower gc contents, down to 30%.

the ch. tentans genes were classified into gene families using the orthomcl-db database
 <cit> , an orthology database that comprises protein-coding genes from  <dig> species, including nine arthropods . the orthomcl-db analysis could align  <dig>  genes  of ch. tentans to  <dig>  previously identified gene families, with the remaining  <dig>  species-specific genes  being either contained in new in-paralog gene families  or classified as orphan genes . these figures are similar to those obtained for the well-annotated model species d. melanogaster whose genome contains  <dig>   cross-species gene families and 26% species-specific genes according to the orthomcl-db. out of the  <dig>  ch. tentans gene families,  <dig>  families  were shared with the three mosquito genomes included in the analysis , and as many as  <dig>  families  were shared with at least one of these.

we performed a phylogenetic reconstruction based on a set of  <dig> conserved single-copy genes across the nine arthropods and three nematodes included in the orthomcl-db database and the present ch. tentans sequence. we show that ch. tentans represents a sister clade to mosquitoes . the split to mosquitoes dates back roughly 150– <dig> million years
 <cit> .

the gene expression machineries of ch. tentans
gene onthology analyses were performed on the predicted protein-coding genes of ch. tentans using blast2go
 <cit>  based on blasting the sequences against d. melanogaster proteins ). an interspecies comparison of go categories within “biological function” domain showed that the relative frequencies of each category in ch. tentans were very similar to those found in d. melanogaster, as expected .figure  <dig> 
comparison of the relative abundance of proteins according to gene ontology terms. gene ontology categories of “biological process” go-domain were used for annotation of the ch. tentans proteome and compared to gene ontology annotation of the d. melanogaster proteome. the bars represent the relative abundance of go categories, i.e. for every dataset we calculated the frequencies of annotations of proteins to a go category relative to the total amount of proteins annotated to “biological processes”.



given the relevance of ch. tentans as a model system for studies of gene expression, it was important to identify the components of the gene expression machineries in ch. tentans and to establish their degree of evolutionary conservation. to this end, we defined the main processes included in the gene expression pathway, listed the known components of the corresponding machineries in d. melanogaster , and identified their orthologs in ch. tentans as follows. the protein sets for the  <dig> expression machineries were compiled in d. melanogaster  by expert annotation . a complete set of orthologs between d. melanogaster and ch. tentans proteins were identified by inparanoid
 <cit> . from these,  <dig> 1: <dig> orthologs of the  <dig> machineries were extracted and aligned using kalign v <dig> 
 <cit> . each d. melanogaster protein was also aligned by exonerate v  <dig> .0
 <cit>  and by tblastn , to both the complete genome assembly and the set of hc transcripts. in total, a maximum of  <dig> protein identity scores were thus obtained per protein, and the highest score was kept as an estimation of the d. melanogaster versus ch. tentans protein conservation. after manual inspection of hits and selection of alignments covering at least 25% of the d. melanogaster proteins, potential orthologs were identified for  <dig> of the  <dig> proteins included in the study , with percentages of protein identity ranging from 100%  to 17%  . the large and small ribosomal subunits were the most highly expressed and the most highly conserved machineries, but otherwise no general correlation was observed between protein conservation and gene expression level in this dataset . most of the proteins in d. melanogaster, for which no orthologs could be identified in ch. tentans , are proteins with relatively low degree of conservation that lack orthologs outside the genus drosophila according to the orthodb catalogue
 <cit> . two of them, ulp <dig> and trf <dig>  have orthologs in yeast and metazoans, and are therefore likely to exist also in ch. tentans. these two proteins are unusually long, their sequence conservation is not high, and the homology is restricted to parts of the sequence, which could be the explanation why no orthologs were identified in our study.figure  <dig>

we also searched the ch. tentans genome with full-length d. melanogaster snrna sequences to identify the spliceosomal u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig> and u <dig> snrna genes in the ch. tentans genome. in all cases, we found matches over at least 55% of the full length of the d. melanogaster sequences, with identities in the matched regions ranging between 77% and 100% . a comparison between the ch. tentans and human snrna sequences revealed a similar degree of identity . we conclude that the ch. tentans genome contains a complete set of the major spliceosomal snrna genes.table  <dig>

in summary, our analysis shows that the gene expression machineries encoded in the ch. tentans genome are highly conserved, which is of relevance for the studies of gene expression in this model organism.

sequence organization of the br gene loci
previous studies of gene expression using ch. tentans focused on the br genes
 <cit>  and early sequence analyses provided a partial view of the br gene family
 <cit> . four br genes  are approximately 40 kb long, have a similar exon-intron structure with four introns, and share internal repetitive sequence organization. the br <dig> gene is 11 kb long and is related to the long br genes, but contains  <dig> introns spread throughout the gene and has a diverged internal repetition
 <cit> .

here, the current genome assembly combined with sequence information from previously cloned genomic fragments were used to describe the non-repetitive parts of the br genes, providing novel information on the genome organization of the br genes . the central coding regions of the br <dig>  br <dig> , br <dig>  and br <dig> genes are built from tandem repeats and were not recovered in the genome assembly, except for a limited number of repeats located at both ends of these regions. the sequences of these four genes were therefore recovered in two or three scaffolds, while in the br <dig> locus, the entire br <dig> gene was present in a single scaffold. in the br <dig> locus, a  <dig>  kb-long promoter region was duplicated, in reverse orientation, with a sequence of about 300 bp between the palindromic sequences . pcr analyses confirmed that the br <dig> gene is connected to the promoter-containing scaffold as indicated in the figure, while the presence of a putative second br gene, in the br <dig> locus, connected to the duplicated promoter could not be determined at this stage. previously, an additional internally repetitive gene fragment from the br <dig> locus has been described
 <cit> , but we were unable to connect this gene to the duplicated promoter using pcr. a short gene, located approximately 7 kb downstream the br <dig> gene was predicted, but no orthologs were found in blast searches. no additional genes could be mapped in the br <dig> gene locus.

in the br <dig> locus, the closely related br <dig>  and br <dig>  genes turned out to be located approximately 15 kb apart and in opposite directions . the sequences in the 200 bp immediately upstream the transcription start sites were essentially identical for the two genes. in between the two genes, several regions, 1– <dig>  kb in length, had palindromic organization with 55-80% sequence identity. these regions were present close to the br <dig>  gene and in the middle of the intergenic region. the functional significance of these palindromes is not known. we predicted one gene located between the two br <dig> genes and a second gene downstream the br <dig>  gene. the major parts of these two predicted genes consisted of proposed non-coding sequences and only short coding regions were present. the expression of these predicted genes remains to be experimentally demonstrated.

in the br <dig> locus , we found the beginning and end of the br <dig> gene in two scaffolds. no additional genes were present in the scaffolds.figure  <dig>

the br <dig> gene, , is located close to several other genes. in the upstream, approximately 47 kb region, five predicted genes are present. four of these have orthologs in d. melanogaster. in the downstream region, a short predicted gene is present, but no blast hit could be found.

in the genome assembly, a previously unknown br-like gene was discovered . the promoter region and the beginning of the gene, including transcription and translation start sites and exon  <dig>  intron  <dig> and the beginning of exon  <dig>  were very similar to the corresponding regions in the br <dig>  br <dig> , br <dig>  and br <dig> genes. also the 3′ end of the gene was very similar to the long br genes. at present, we do not know if the central part of this br-like gene contains repeats similar to the previously characterized br genes. in situ hybridization located this br-like gene to locus 5b on chromosome iv . this locus is not unfolded into a morphologically visible br puff in the salivary gland polytene chromosome iv, which suggests that the gene is not highly transcribed and/or that the gene locus is not organized as the br <dig>  br <dig> or br <dig> loci are.

the organization of the br <dig> puff
the transcribed br genes are extensively unfolded and form giant puffs in the polytene chromosomes
 <cit> , but little is known about the topological organization of the br genes and their flanking sequences in the puffs. we have made use of the genomic sequence data to visualize and analyze the organization of the two br <dig> genes in the active br <dig> locus. we performed in situ hybridizations using probes representing the region between the br <dig>  and br <dig>  genes , the br <dig>  and br <dig>  repetitive coding regions and the downstream region of the br <dig>  gene . the p <dig> intergenic probe labelled distinct spots at many sites throughout the entire br <dig> locus . these spots did not overlap with the probes for the transcribed repetitive regions of the br <dig>   or br  <dig>  genes , both of which labelled more extended and peripheral regions. the p <dig> probe located downstream the br <dig>  gene also hybridized to spots located in a scattered manner throughout the br <dig> puff . however, these spots were fewer and larger than the ones seen for the p <dig> intergenic region, and they were more internally located.figure  <dig>

electron microscopy  images of thin sections through the br <dig> locus ,
 <cit>  reveal that the br <dig> locus contains chromatin bundles of gradually thinner dimensions that extend from, and return to, the chromosome axis. it is also known that the active br genes form transcription loops with an extended chromatin axis
 <cit> . however, the br <dig>  and br <dig>  genes could not be distinguished from each other by em morphological criteria, and the organization of the two genes inside the puff was unknown. our in situ hybridization results show that the two transcribed genes are intermingled in the br <dig> puff, as shown by the fact that the probes specific for the br <dig>  and br <dig>  repeats give very similar staining patterns over the entire puff.

the br <dig>  and br <dig>  repetitive probes gave a diffuse hybridization signal, whereas the p <dig> intergenic probe gave a spotted staining. this difference suggests that only the transcribed parts of the genes  loop out from the chromatin bundles in an extended conformation. the intergenic sequences are instead packaged in more compact chromatin patches and are therefore visualized as spots by in situ hybridization.

detailed em studies showed that the chromatin located immediately upstream of the transcribed br gene forms a thin chromatin fibre corresponding to about  <dig>  kb of dna
 <cit> . several such fibres representing several genes extend from a single compact chromatin region. our in situ hybridization results are compatible with the em ultrastructure and suggest that the promoter-containing intergenic region forms thin bundles of condensed chromatin engaging several chromatids, and that these bundles are located at the periphery of the chromosome body .

in the em, the downstream region appears as a loosely coiled chromatin fibre, 200 nm in length, corresponding to about 3 kb of dna
 <cit> . several such chromatin fibres connect to a more compact chromatin patch. our in situ hybridization data are consistent with the interpretation that sequences located about 20 kb downstream the br <dig>  gene reside in compact chromatin. the fact that the downstream probe p <dig> labels fewer spots than the upstream probe p <dig>  suggests that the downstream sequences from many chromatids  come together in more compact chromatin bundles . moreover, these downstream chromatin bundles are located more internally than the intergenic bundles visualized with the p <dig> probe. this difference suggests that the bundling of chromatids at the two ends of the br genes is controlled by different molecular mechanisms.

CONCLUSIONS
the ch. tentans genome is approximately 200 mb in size, contains 15% repetitive elements, and encodes  <dig>  genes with an average of  <dig>  alternative transcripts per gene. we have identified genes that code for factors involved in the expression of protein-coding genes, including snrna genes, and we show that these factors are similar to their orthologs in d. melanogaster. we also report novel data on the organization of the br gene loci, the identification a novel putative br gene, and present a model for the organization of chromatin bundles in the br <dig> puff. our results strengthen the generality of the br genes as a model system and provide essential background for in-depth studies of mrnp biogenesis and functions using a unique eukaryotic model system. the access to the ch. tentans genome sequence will not only ease research in the field of gene expression but also constitute a valuable resource for toxicity and ecology studies. the analysis of the ch. tentans genome sequence will also contribute to studies of genomic evolution of nematocera and of other insects that are relevant for human activity and health, such as mosquitoes, blackflies and sandflies.
