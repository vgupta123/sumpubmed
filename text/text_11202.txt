BACKGROUND
the oriental armyworm mythimna separata walker  is one of the most important pests of cereal crops including corn, wheat and rice. in recent years, outbreaks of m. separata are severely threatening corn production in northern china. to date, control strategy toward this insect pest heavily relies on the usage of chemical pesticides  <cit> . besides the environmental pollution and non-specific toxicity of chemical pesticide, insect resistance toward the chemicals is also becoming a serious problem in majority of the insect pests including m. separata. bt  toxin engineered to be expressed in transgenes is an alternative for the chemicals, but it still encountered the problem of broad-spectrum toxicity and evolution of insect resistance. in fact, development of resistance against bt toxin was also reported for m. separata  <cit> .

rnai is a natural gene regulation and antiviral defense system of eukaryotic cells. rnai has been exploited as a technology for silencing of target genes via sequence-specific manner  <cit> . there are already many examples and even practical implementation of rnai-based technologies for development of anti-pathogenic crops. rnai-based strategies have been used for development of genetically modified plants resistant to variety of disease agents such as bacteria, nematode and virus . in  <dig>  two research groups reported the development of transgenic corn and cotton resistant to insect herbivores using rnai technology, providing a species-specific and environmentally sound anti-insect strategy  <cit> . since then, successful rnai experiments have also been reported in different insect species including some lepidopteran insects  <cit> . to screen large-scale insect genes to identify an optimal candidate target which is effective and species-specific, there is a need to develop high-throughput method for future rnai-based control strategy in each insect species of interest.

in this study, we propose to determine the possibility of using rnai technology to knockdown the expression of m. separata genes. to date, the sources of interfering rnas  commonly utilized in insect rnai study include in vitro synthesized dsrna, virus-expressed dsrna or sirna, or transgenically expressed hairpin rna, all of which are costly synthetic molecules or are produced from time-consuming laborious procedures. to overcome the shortages of these methods, we used here an oral delivery of bacterially derived sequence specific dsrnas to silence m. separata genes. we chose chitinase encoding genes as targets in this preliminary effort. chitin n is a long-chain polymer of a n-acetylglucosamine linked by β- <dig> -glycosidic bond. in insects, chitin is a main structural component which lines the cuticle of foregut, hindgut, trachea, and pm  of the midgut, and is playing structural and protective roles in insect. chitinases, also known as chitin synthases, are family  <dig> glycosyl hydrolases that break down glycosidic bonds in chitin and are responsible for the hydrolysis and synthesis of chitin . chitinase gene has long been studied and used as the biocontrol molecule agent toward biotic stresses including fungi and insects  <cit> . functions of chitinase genes were heavily investigated in different insect species. several lines of evidence suggested that rnai silencing of chitinase genes led to strong phenotypic effects in different insect species including ostrinia nubilalis , tribolium castaneum , anopheles gambiae , and locusta migratoria  . two chitinase homologs were identified in m. separata. we utilized l <dig> vector to prepare dsrnas in the e.coli cells for these chitinase genes, and directly fed them to recipient insects by mixing with artificial diet. molecular evidence suggested that oral delivery of bacterial dsrna caused the knockdown of target chitinase gene expression, as was also evidenced by the appearance of sequence-specific sirna in the recipient insect. mortality increase and body weight decline were also observed in recipient insects. our data provided both theoretical and applicational direction toward the use of rnai as a reverse genetic tool for studying the function of specific genes and also as a biocontrol method for the control of this insect species.

RESULTS
phylogenetic analysis and expression profiles of two m. separata genes coding for putative chitinase
only  <dig> ests and  <dig> protein coding sequences were available for m. separata to date in the database of national center for biotechnology information . two putative chitinase genes were found for m. separata in the database and they were named as msechi <dig>  and msechi <dig> respectively. the nucleotide sequences of msechi <dig> and msechi <dig> showed high sequence similarity with other insect genes coding for chitinases. phylogenetic analysis showed that msechi <dig> and msechi <dig> were clustered into different subfamilies . semi-quantitative analyses of msechi <dig> and msechi <dig> transcript levels in different tissues of insect larvae were performed. as shown in fig.  <dig> b, msechi <dig> and msechi <dig> were predominantly expressed in the gut tissues although their transcripts were detected also in many other tissues to a different extent. msechi <dig> and msechi <dig> appear to be ideal candidates for rnai study via oral delivery of the interfering agent as the gut tissue will ingest the rnai effectors primarily. several lines of evidence also showed the susceptibility of gut-expressed mrna to orally-ingested dsrnas .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis and expression patterns of m. separata chitinase genes. a phylogenetic analysis of msechi <dig> and msechi <dig> by aligning with putative chitinase and chitinase-like protein encoding genes from other insect species using mega  <dig>  software. abbreviations, mse: mythimna separata. mb: mamestra brassicae. se: spodoptera exigua. sl: spodoptera litura. of: ostrinia furnacalis. px: papilio xuthus. sc: samia cynthia. ms: manduca sexta. ac: agrius convolvuli. bm: bombyx mori. sf: spodoptera frugiperda. ha: helicoverpa armigera. ai: agrotis ipsilon. mc: mamestra configurata. lo: lacanobia oleracea. ◆ denotes m. separata chitinase genes. b expression profiles of msechi <dig> and msechi <dig> in a variety of tissues including reproductive organ , fat body , thorax , head , abdomen  and gut . semi-quantitative rt-pcr was performed for msechi <dig> and msechi <dig> using the gene specific primers at 32 cycles. 28 cycles of amplification for the house-keeping gene β-actin was carried out to test the integrity of tissue sample




production of dsrnas for interfering sequences against msechi <dig> and msechi2
partial fragments of msechi <dig> and msechi <dig> were amplified from the cdna samples of m. separata, and the amplicons were cloned into l <dig> vector. these fragments for dsrna synthesis and those for other purposes were outlined in fig.  <dig> a and b, for msechi <dig> and msechi <dig>  respectively. two t <dig> promoters flanked the insert sequence in inverted orientations were expected to drive the expression of complementary rna, resulting in the formation of dsrna for this insert sequence . the recombinant vectors were transformed into e.coli strain ht <dig> which lacked the double-strand-specific rnaseiii activity. t <dig> rna polymerase activity was induced using iptg . total bacterial rna was extracted, and the presence of long dsrna segments in total rna was analyzed. fig.  <dig> a showed that msechi <dig> or msechi <dig> dsrnas with expected size were detected only after addition of iptg whereas they were not observed in the transformed cells without iptg induction. the dsrnas produced by bacteria are resistant to rnasea treatment , supporting their double-stranded property. it was noticed that rrna band disappeared after iptg induction, which was similar to the results shown before by zhu et al.  <cit> . to further confirm the sequence specificity of the dsrna band, northern hybridization was performed using dig -labelled msechi <dig> or msechi <dig> sequence specific probes respectively. the probes were made by the pcr amplification of the fragments shown in fig.  <dig> a, b in which dig -dutp was added into the reaction components. when dig-labelled probes were separated on the agarose gel, they lagged behind the same pcr products without dig-dutp added. this result confirmed the efficient labelling events in that incorporation of dig-dutp in the probes increased their molecular mass . as shown in fig.  <dig> b and c, prevalent dsrna bands with the expected size were detected after iptg induction in the hybridization experiment, showing that the nucleotides corresponding to the bands are sequence specific as we expect. we also amplified the fragments from cdnas of iptg-induced bacteria, cloned into t-vector and verified by sequencing .fig.  <dig> schematics of the nucleotide fragments for different experiments. a detail of the nucleotide regions used in the study for msechi <dig> gene. red line indicates the region for dsrna synthesis, purple line indicates the region for preparation of dig-labelled probe, green line indicates the region for amplification of the fragment for semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis, and blue line indicates the region for amplification of the fragments in qrt-pcr experiment. b detail of the nucleotide regions used in the study for msechi <dig> gene. c general scheme for dsrna production by l <dig> vector in ht <dig> cell

confirmation of oral feeding efficiency with fd&c blue staining
we modified the existing formula of artificial diet for the lepidopteran insects to create a new recipe for m. separata. fig.  <dig> a showed that m. separata larvae readily fed on the modified artificial diet. to verify that bacteria mixed with the artificial diet were ingested by the feeding larvae, fd&c blue was added into the artificial diet. after six hours’ feeding, the blue diet was easily detectable inside the larvae . when larval gut was dissected and the intestinal content was removed, the blue diet was observed in the gut tissue, demonstrating that the diet was absorbed and enriched in the gut tissue . when the new recipe of artificial diet was compared with already reported diet formula for lepidopteran insects  <cit>  by fd&c blue staining, no obvious difference was observed between them .fig.  <dig> validation for oral ingestion and molecular evidence for rnai effects. a photograph of m. separata larva feeding on the artificial diet. b gut tissue from the larvae fed on the artificial diet mixed with  or without  fd&c blue. c the same experiment with  where the intestinal content was removed from the gut tissues. d and  knockdown of m. separata chitinase gene after feeding on the bacteria expressing dsrnas. t-test was performed between treatment and control group. the single asterisk indicates a significant difference at p <  <dig> . f and  northern blot detection of small rna in the larvae fed on dsrna-expressing bacteria. f lane  <dig>  larvae fed on the bacteria expressing msechi <dig> dsrna; lane  <dig>  larvae fed on the bacteria transformed with empty l <dig> vector. g lane  <dig>  larvae fed on the bacteria expressing msechi <dig> dsrna; lane  <dig>  larvae fed on the bacteria transformed with empty l <dig> vector




knockdown efficiency of bacterial dsrna upon target gene expression
in order to test the silencing effects of orally-fed bacterial dsrna on target gene expression, qrt-pcr was performed on the cdna of gut sample for individual larva. the insect fed with bacteria carrying empty l <dig> vector served as the control treatment. expression of target genes in individual sample was normalized with the steady state level of β-actin gene. insects were collected at five days after feeding, gut tissue was separated, and total rnas were extracted. fig.  <dig> d, e showed that mrna abundance of msechi <dig> and msechi <dig> was decreased by 68% and 76% compared with the control samples, respectively. although considerable msechi <dig> transcript was detected in non-gut tissues , rnai effects were not observed in those tissues, demonstrating no existence of systemic movement of rnai signal in m. separata . the data strongly demonstrated that bacterial dsrna could silence the endogenous expression of chitinase genes in gut tissue of m. separata.

detection of chitinase gene specific sirnas
rnai effects are not only signified by a decline in the target mrna level, but also by the accumulation of sirnas with sequence-specific manner. therefore, we used northern hybridization to test whether chitinase specific sirnas were enriched in the gut tissue of bacterial dsrna-fed larvae. target specific sirnas were detected only in rnas extracted from the samples which ingested bacteria expressing dsrna for corresponding target sequences, while the control sample showed no positive band . comparison of the positions of the sirna band with those of rna ladder showed that the size of sirnas were approximately 21 nt. in the case of msechi <dig>  larger band of around 24 nt was also detected, implying that different forms of sirna might be involved in its silencing . these data strongly supported the idea that knockdown of target genes in m. separata was mediated by the rnai mechanism.

increased mortality and retarded larval growth were caused by target gene silencing
phenotypic changes of recipient insects upon target chitinase gene silencing were investigated. slight but significant increases in mortality rate were detected after feeding of the larvae with the bacteria expressing chitinase specific dsrnas. feeding of l4440-msechi <dig> transformant caused  <dig> % increase in mortality compared with the control l <dig> transformant group at seven days after feeding. feeding of l4440-msechi <dig> transformant caused mortality increases from three to seven days after feeding, and the biggest mortality increase of  <dig> % was observed at five days after feeding . at seven days after feeding, body weights of surviving larvae in l <dig>  l4440-msechi <dig> and l4440-msechi <dig> groups were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g, respectively. therefore, body weights in l4440-msechi <dig> and l4440-msechi <dig> groups were decreased by  <dig> % and  <dig> % compared with the control l <dig> group respectively . however, no obvious deformity was observed in l4440-msechi <dig> and l4440-msechi <dig> groups .fig.  <dig> growth changes of larvae in feeding assay. a mortality rate of m. separata larvae. eighty fourth instar larvae of uniform size were fed for seven days on the artificial diet containing e.coli cells expressing chitinase specific dsrnas. larvae fed on l <dig> transformant were used as the control group. the number of surviving larvae was recorded at two days’ interval. b body weights of the larvae before and after seven days’ feeding. c phenotypes of larvae after seven days’ feeding. scale bar was shown. t-test was performed between treatment and control group. the single asterisk indicates a significant difference at p <  <dig> , and the double asterisks indicate a significant difference at p <  <dig> 




discussion
rnai technique has been exploited as a temporal knockdown approach for inhibiting target gene expression. recently, rnai has been achieved in many insect species. m. separata is an economically important pest posing threat to corn production. our aim is to examine and establish proof-of-concept for rna interference in m. separata. in terms of delivery route of rnai effector molecules toward recipient insects, there are several generally adopted ways including soaking, injection and feeding. soaking is amenable to small animals like c.elegans, while it apparently seems not suitable for the insects like m. separata  <cit> . microinjection delivers exact amounts of effector molecules into hemoceol, but it is laborious and disruptive. feeding is a non-invasive method compared with microinjection as the former does not physically harm the insects and is also less laborious. in fact, oral feeding has been effective with the introduction of different types of rnai effectors including in vitro synthesized dsrna  <cit> , sirna  <cit> , virus-derived rna  <cit>  and transgenically expressed hairpin rna  <cit> . among them, in vitro synthesized dsrna remained as the most common form of effector molecules, while the high cost for production of it hindered its application as a widespread protocol for large-scale applications. as an alternative to in vitro synthesized dsrna, rnai has been shown to be achieved through voluntary ingestion of e.coli expressing dsrna complementary to the target gene in c. elegans  <cit> . from then on, e.coli expressing dsrnas or crude extracts of it have been used to inhibit replication of virus or silence cognate genes in insects and planarians etc. . in one instance, dsrna expressed in the host insect also suppressed the replication of infected virus  <cit> . in another instance, chen et al. used psilent- <dig> vector to express tlr <dig> specific dsrna in protoplast of a funus strain ifb <dig> and fed them to the hemipteran sucking insect bemisia tabaci to cause target gene silencing  <cit> . these results encourage researchers to make use of bacterially or fungal expressed rnai effectors to screen optimal target for potential rnai application before setting out to prepare the transgenic insect-resistant plant. protection of plant from insect attacks by direct spray or root soaking of in-vitro synthesized dsrnas was previously reported  <cit> . however, technical advances on cost-efficient production of in vitro dsrna were needed to large scale application of it. in this regard, bacteria engineered to express dsrna might be a better alternative as it is a less expensive and more productive method  <cit> . direct spray of these bacteria for field protection could be realized in different insect species as preliminary efforts are now underway  <cit> . most recently, isolation and engineering of symbiont bacteria for dsrna production and delivery were also reported to be a choice for rnai-based insecticides  <cit> .

in terms of target genes, dozens of genes including v-atpase, cytochrome p <dig> and chitinase genes are widely used in insect rnai studies. as chitin is an important natural amino polysaccharide and is crucial for the growth and development of insects, chitinases/chitin synthases are viewed as the ideal targets for insect rnai experiment. we confirmed that specific dsrnas could be produced via l4440-e.coli expression system. we developed a m. separata suitable artificial diet and mixed the dsrna expressing bacteria with this diet. our data demonstrated that ingestion of bacterially expressed dsrna led to sensible reduction of msechi <dig> and msechi <dig> transcript abundance and also caused accumulation of corresponding sirna in target specific manner. furthermore, knockdown of msechi <dig> and msechi <dig> caused slight increase in larval mortality and obvious decrease in body weight, while no visible deformities were observed. we used long dsrna of around 700 bp in size in our experiment. several pioneer experiments in other insect species including western corn rootworm and tribolium castaneum, both of which are chewing herbivorous insects, demonstrated that longer dsrna were more readily and efficiently uptaken by the midgut tissues, leading to more pronounced rnai effects  <cit> . it is also an important factor to be considered that consistent supply of rnai effectors is necessary for efficient silencing of cognate rna in the recipient insect as the effects seem to be temporal. although in some instance lepidopteran adult was also used for rnai feeding experiment  <cit> , we used only larvae to test rnai phenomena in m. separata in that the larvae is most voracious in its all life stages. in our experiment, fourth instar m. separata larvae readily fed on the artificial diet and therefore acquired the effector rnas in a persistent manner with high amount.

as rnai mechanism is conserved across different organisms, rnai effectors such as dsrna and sirna produced in one species could be effective toward their complementary mrna target in other species. we detected sirnas with the size of around 21 nt in the recipient insects, demonstrating that rnai phenomenon is present in m. separata. further analysis on rnai-mechanism related components including ago , dcl  and rna transport and amplification related proteins like sid  and rdrp  is needed to mechanistically support the present data. further studies like transcriptome sequencing and screening of rnai mechanism related proteins are underway on this aspect and we will present these data elsewhere.

CONCLUSIONS

m. separata belongs to noctuidae family and is severely threatening corn production in china. efficient genetic tools and methods are lacking in this species. we showed here that oral feeding of bacterially expressed dsrna would cause effective rnai knockdown effects in the recipient insect. decreased mrna transcript level and appearance of sequence-specific sirna confirmed the existence of dsrna-mediated silencing efficiency in m. separata. our result presents an opportunity to make use of bacteria as the efficient producer of rnai effectors against m. separata. it also provides a large-scale screening method for selection and future exploitation of ideal rnai triggers provided we have enough candidate genes available by other methods like transcriptome sequencing. for non-model organism like m. separata, this method is also helpful for the study of essential gene functions by handy loss-of-function manipulation.
