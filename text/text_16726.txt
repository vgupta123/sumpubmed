BACKGROUND
the model plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc <dig>  infects tomato  and arabidopsis thaliana . dc <dig> enters the apoplastic space through wounds or natural openings in the leaf, like stomata, and grows in intercellular spaces. as the infection progresses, the pathogen releases virulence factors such as the phytotoxin coronatine and injects effector proteins into host cells through the type iii secretions system . in a susceptible host, chlorosis  of the leaves occurs and necrotic lesions develop. alternatively in a non-host, such as nicotiana benthamiana, a defense-associated hypersensitive response  is elicited.

most investigations of pathogenicity in p. syringae have focused on identifying and characterizing components of the t3ss  <cit> , non-ribosomal peptides  <cit>  and toxins  <cit> . while these are clearly important, pathogenic bacteria must also compete successfully for limited nutrients within the host, with iron as a well-known example  <cit> . unfortunately, it is not well-understood how metabolic processes in plant pathogens contribute to virulence, although experiments using ivet  have identified a variety of bacterial genes expressed during plant-pathogen interactions as well as during host colonization . these studies revealed the importance of genes involved in metabolism to the infection process.

several lines of evidence suggest links between bacterial pathogenicity and metabolism. the disruption of genes involved in acquisition of nutrients such as carbon result in reduced virulence in human and animal pathogens . as for plant pathogens, a number of metabolically related genes were identified as required for infection of shoots of apple trees by erwinia amylovora  <cit>  and it was shown that p. savastanoi pv savastanoi requires genes directly involved in metabolism in order to survive in olive knots  <cit> . arginine metabolism and regulation are associated with the virulence of several pathogenic bacteria such as mycobacterium tuberculosis, listeria monocytogenes, legionella pneumophila, and mycobacterium bovis . recently ramos et al. showed that an argd mutant in the plant pathogen erwinia amylovora was non-pathogenic  <cit> .

our laboratory is interested in the identification and characterization of small rnas in p. syringae. livny et al. reported a pseudomonas-specific small rna  transcribed from an orthologous region upstream from the carabgrea operon in pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> . the expression of p <dig> was confirmed by northern blot and a transcript of about  <dig> bases was detected in rich medium during exponential growth and stationary phase cultures. no other function has been described for this regulatory rna. this region is also present in the genome of dc <dig>  while conducting a genome-wide mapping of mrna 5′ends in dc <dig>  we identified a potential transcriptional start site  <dig> bases upstream of cara  <cit> . the carab genes encode the enzyme carbamoylphosphate synthetase , which catalyzes the synthesis of carbamoylphosphate, a precursor of arginine and pyrimidines. further analysis revealed a putative rpod promoter a short distance upstream from the start site, as well as a potential rho-independent terminator located between the start site and the first codon of cara. the promoter may be associated with two overlapping transcripts, a shorter one utilizing the rho-independent terminator, and a longer one that includes cara, carb, and grea . consistent with this model, we observed expression in the region encompassing the 5′utr, cara, carb, and grea in a transcriptome analysis of the dc <dig> genome  <cit>  and detected transcriptional activity in the same region during a search for small rnas using rna-seq . regulation of the carabgrea operon in p. aeruginosa is controlled both by arginine at the transcriptional level and also by pyrimidines, possibly through an attenuation mechanism  <cit> . carab mutants of pseudomonas spp. strain g are auxotrophic for arginine as well as pyrimidines  <cit> . in addition, these mutants are deficient in extracellular polysaccharide production. the function of carbamoyl-phosphate synthase and p <dig> has not been well characterized in plant pathogenic bacteria. just recently it was demonstrated that disruption of carb in xanthomonas citri, resulted in loss of pathogenicity and inability to elicit a hypersensitive reaction in non-hosts, whereas disruption of cara did not affect these phenotypes  <cit> . however, disruption of carb resulted in reduced swimming and reduced ability to form biofilms  <cit> .

the regulation of p <dig> as well as carab and their potential contribution to virulence has not been investigated in p. syringae. in this study, we investigated p <dig> and its involvement in the regulation of cara in p. syringae. we found that cara is important for growth and fitness in planta and demonstrated the likely importance of uracil during infection. in contrast, p <dig> appears to be involved in cara regulation and does not have an obvious role in planta, although p <dig> is part of the same transcriptional unit as cara.

RESULTS
effect of p <dig> and cara deletions on growth of dc3000
in previous work, a meme analysis of dc <dig> genomic regions immediately upstream from captured rna 5′ ends revealed a candidate rpod promoter adjacent to the putative small rna p <dig>  <cit> . p <dig> is located immediately upstream of pspto_ <dig>  . in other organisms the products of cara and carb are involved in the biosynthesis of arginine and pyrimidines  <cit>  and cara mutants have been shown to require arginine for optimal growth . we hypothesized that p <dig> may also be involved in these pathways since it closely neighbors cara. to test the involvement of p <dig> and cara in arginine and pyrimidine biosynthesis we constructed two deletion mutants, one in which p <dig> was deleted and another in which cara was deleted. deletions were confirmed by pcr and sequencing . the transcript for cara could still be detected in the p <dig> deletion mutant indicating transcription of cara can occur in the absence of the genomic region containing p <dig> . growth of the p <dig> deletion mutant was comparable to that of the wild-type strain dc <dig> in rich medium kb, minimal medium mg, and minimal medium vbmm . in contrast, the cara mutant displayed a growth defect when grown in rich medium, and minimal media mg and vbmm. the growth defect was abolished by the simultaneous addition of arginine and uracil to vbmm. also, complementation of the cara mutant by expressing the coding region of cara on a plasmid, restored growth to wild type levels , indicating that the cara gene was solely responsible for the phenotype observed. overall the data suggests that p <dig> is not required for expression of cara and that cara is involved in metabolism of arginine and uracil.fig.  <dig> genomic sequence of the genomic region containing p <dig>  the transcriptional start site  is denoted with an arrow and marked as + <dig>  the putative rpod-dependent promoter sequence  is underlined. boxed areas represent the − <dig> and − <dig> sites. the argr binding sites reported for pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit>  consisting of two half sites in direct repeat arrangement, is indicated by brackets. a predicted terminator and inverted repeat is denoted by the convergent arrows. the mapped 3' end is denoted by the asterisk. the “m” represents the methionine start codon for cara and “t” is the symbol for the amino acid threonine. 42 bp denotes the base pairs between the end of the coding region of dapb and the putative argr binding site. 45 bp denotes the base pairs from the mapped 3′end of p <dig> to the translational start site of cara

expression of p <dig> and cara in dc3000
in p. aeruginosa, the expression of cara is controlled by both pyrimidines and arginine  <cit> . to investigate if p <dig> influences the expression of cara in p. syringae, we performed a series of transcriptional analyses. first, to confirm transcriptional activity and to verify the 3′ end of p <dig> we performed 3′ race. a 3′ end was identified at nucleotide position 5073275c, immediately downstream from the predicted rho-independent terminator . the presence of a 3′end in this region could occur as a result of several events. one possibility is that distinct promoters produce two separate transcripts, one containing p <dig> and another containing cara, carb, and grea. alternatively a transcript could arise from a single transcriptional start site, but under certain conditions termination or cleavage/processing could result in the generation of a small transcript containing p <dig> alone. our 5′end mapping data did not detect another transcriptional start site for cara  <cit>  although our transciptome survey detected expression through the entire p32-cara-carb-grea operon  <cit> . a second 5′ mapping experiment using fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide extension  detected a single transcriptional start site using rna isolated from cells grown in vbmm and vbmm supplemented with arginine and uracil . this suggests that expression of the entire p <dig> –cara region may be under the control of a single promoter, as is the case in p. aeruginosa  <cit> .

to investigate if p <dig> is co-transcribed with cara, rna was isolated from cells grown under rich or growth-limiting conditions. cdna synthesis was performed and used for bridging pcr with different primer pairs to identify rna that consists of both p <dig> and cara . products were obtained with each primer set using rna from bacteria grown with or without arginine and uracil . this suggests that p <dig> and cara are co-transcribed under the conditions tested. these data also indicate that cara is transcribed even in the presence of arginine and uracil.fig.  <dig> co-transcription of p <dig> and cara. a map of the genomic region containing dapb, p <dig> and cara in dc <dig>  the locations and orientations of rt- and pcr primers are indicated. b agarose gel electrophoresis result of the rt-pcr experiments using the primers pairs indicated. the expected length of the pcr products for the primer pairs are as follows: primer pair  <dig> and  <dig>  ~54 bps; primer pair  <dig> and  <dig>  ~370 bps; and primer pair  <dig> and  <dig>  ~209 bps. control reactions in which reverse transcriptase was omitted were performed for each primer set and rna sample



to further investigate the regulation of p <dig> and cara we created promoter fusions and evaluated their expression in the wild-type strain . the promoter fusions consisted of either the entire intergenic region between dapb  and cara, including p <dig> , the region from the 3′ end of dapb to the first half of the rho-independent terminator, which therefore lacks ½ of the stem-loop , the region from the 3′end of dapb to the beginning of the stem-loop , p <dig> and downstream sequences up to cara , or the region between the 3′ end of p <dig> and cara . fusions lacking the putative promoter region  were expressed at background levels in vbmm or vbmm supplemented with arginine or uracil . this is consistent with the single mapped transcriptional start site for cara and p <dig> and the co-expression data that indicates p <dig> and cara are transcribed together from a single promoter under these conditions. in addition, we observed an increase in expression when the stem-loop structure was disrupted  or completely removed  compared to the full-length fusion p <dig>  we conclude that this feature is important in modulating the expression of cara.fig.  <dig> expression of p <dig> and cara. a regions of varying lengths upstream to the cara coding region were cloned into lux reporter constructs; the regions they span are shown graphically. the inverted arrows represent the predicted stem-loop of the rho-independent terminator.  expression from lux promoter fusions were evaluated in vbmm medium , vbmm supplemented with 40 mm arginine , vbmm supplemented with 10 mm uracil , and vbmm supplemented with 40 mm arginine and 10 mm uracil . data shown are the least squares means  with standard error of normalized luminescence  values over time, derived from at least  <dig> independent biological replicates for each promoter fusion-medium combination, each containing 2– <dig> technical replicates. note that the scales for each panel are different in order to clearly show statistically different data points. for each time point, the values which are significantly different from vbmm are shown with an asterisk . normalized luminescence  is the ratio of luminescence to od <dig>  statistical analysis was performed using the program jmp pro11



interestingly, when arginine was added to the medium we observed an increase in expression from promoter fusions p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> . the addition of uracil resulted in a decrease in expression of lux from the promoter fusions p <dig>  the addition of both arginine and uracil had little effect on the expression of the promoter fusions.

to further investigate the expression of p <dig> and cara, qrt-pcr was performed with rna isolated from wild-type cells grown in vbmm and vbmm supplemented with 40 mm arginine and 10 mm uracil. although transcripts for p <dig> and cara were detected in both growth conditions, no difference in expression was observed between cells grown in vbmm or vbmm supplemented with arginine and uracil . this is consistent with the promoter fusion data.

argr regulates expression of p <dig> and cara
argr binds to a region upstream of cara in p. aeruginosa  <cit> . although argr can act as a repressor or activator, in p. aeruginosa it has been shown to act as a repressor of cara expression  <cit> . because the predicted binding site for argr, tgtcgcn8aan <dig> appears to be conserved in p. syringae , we hypothesized that argr would also regulate p <dig> and/or cara in p. syringae. we analyzed the expression levels of p <dig> and cara in the Δargr mutant and wild-type dc <dig> using qrt-pcr. our results show that expression of p <dig> is increased in the Δargr mutant compared to the wild-type strain at mid-log and stationary phases, while cara expression is increased during mid-log phase . these observations indicate that argr likely acts as a repressor of p <dig> and cara in dc <dig> fig.  <dig> expression of p <dig> and cara in wild-type dc <dig> compared to Δargr mutant using qrt-pcr. the dark gray bars represent the ratios of the transcripts comparing Δargr mutant to the wt at mid-log phase, and the light gray bars represent the ratios of the transcripts comparing Δargr mutant to the wt at stationary phase. rna samples were normalized using gap <dig>  the Δargr mutant shows increased levels of p <dig> and cara transcript compared to the wt at mid-log phase. the levels of p <dig> and cara transcripts were analyzed by calculating the fold difference of transcript levels between wt and Δargr mutant using the Δ ct method. data shown are the average and standard deviation of three independent biological replicates



examining the contribution of p <dig> and cara to virulence
to test the involvement of p <dig> and cara in virulence, tomato plants were dipped in suspensions of wild-type, Δp <dig> mutant, and the Δcara mutant. the Δcara mutant displayed less intense disease symptoms and reduced bacterial growth on days  <dig> and  <dig> post-inoculation compared to the wild type . although Δp <dig> growth was similar to wild- type, it displayed reduced symptoms . however, the symptoms caused by the Δp <dig> mutant were more intense than Δcara mutant.fig.  <dig> 
cara contributes to fitness in tomato. a four-week-old tomato cv. moneymaker tomato plants were dipped in suspensions containing  <dig> × 107 cfu ml− <dig> of wt, Δp <dig>  or Δcara. at the time points indicated, bacteria were extracted from leaves and plated on kb containing rifampicin for enumeration. the values shown are the average cfu/mg with standard deviation from three plants per strain. similar results were obtained in two repetitions of the experiment. b tomato leaves photographed at  <dig> dpi  whole tomato plants photographed at  <dig> dpi



since the Δcara mutant had reduced virulence in tomato, we tested the ability of this mutant and Δp <dig> to cause disease in a. thaliana seedlings. Δp <dig> grew to similar levels as the wild type . in addition, the chlorotic symptoms caused by Δp <dig> were also similar to wild type . based on these data, it is unlikely that Δp <dig> plays a substantial role in virulence in dc <dig>  however, the Δcara mutant displayed reduced growth and was not able to cause the same necrotic symptoms as the wt , suggesting that cara is necessary for growth and fitness in planta.fig.  <dig> 
cara contributes to fitness in arabidopsis seedlings. a arabidopsis seedlings were inoculated with suspensions containing  <dig> × 107 cfu ml− <dig> of wt, Δp <dig>  or Δcara. at the time points shown, bacteria were extracted from leaves and plated on kb containing rifampicin for enumeration. the values shown are the average cfu/mg with standard deviation of three seedlings per strain. the experiment was repeated twice with similar results. b disease phenotype of arabidopsis seedlings flood-inoculated with a bacterial suspension of wt, Δp <dig>  or Δcara. mock-inoculated seedlings were flooded with sterile distilled h2o containing  <dig>  % silwet l- <dig>  photographs were taken  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dpi



growth of Δp <dig> and Δcara in apoplastic fluid
during infection, p. syringae obtains its nutrients from the apoplast. therefore to investigate whether the observed reduction in growth in planta was due to nutrient limitation, we compared the growth of wild-type dc <dig>  Δp <dig>  and Δcara in apoplastic fluid extracts. the wild-type strain and the Δp <dig> mutant demonstrated similar growth. however, growth of Δcara was lower than the wild-type at earlier time points in apoplastic fluid with or without arginine. however, Δcara was able to achieve growth levels similar to wild type at later time points . in apoplastic fluid supplemented with uracil or both arginine and uracil, Δcara and Δp <dig> growth characteristics were similar to wild type, with no significant differences detected between the strains at all time points .fig.  <dig> cara contributes to growth in apoplastic fluid. growth of wild type dc <dig> , Δp <dig>  and Δcara  in apoplastic fluid, apoplastic fluid supplemented with 40 mm arginine or 10 mm uracil, and apoplastic fluid supplemented with 40 mm arginine and 10 mm uracil. growth is represented as least squares means  with standard error of o.d. <dig> over time. the data shown represent  <dig> biological replicates per strain, each with  <dig> technical replicates. post hoc comparisons were performed using tukey hsd . for each time point, the values which are significantly different from wild-type are shown with an asterisk. statistical analyses were performed using jmp pro 11



Δcara is reduced in motility
the reduced virulence observed with the Δcara mutant could be solely due to the inability to grow in vivo or the inability to produce other factors related to virulence. because cara is induced in salmonella cells that are swarming compared to cells that are in a vegetative state, and has been implicated in motility  <cit> , we tested the ability of the Δcara mutant to swarm. since the Δcara mutant does not grow as efficiently as the wild-type strain in minimal media, the assay was conducted in nutrient agar, a rich medium that is used to test swarming of p. aeruginosa. all strains grew equally in this medium . as shown in fig. 9a, the wild-type strain, Δargr mutant and Δp <dig> mutant swarmed equally  in this medium while the Δcara mutant exhibited reduced swarming  . motility was also examined using a soft agar to test for functional flagella. the Δcara mutant showed reduced swimming compared to the wild-type, Δargr mutant and Δp <dig> mutant  .fig.  <dig> disruption of cara impairs motility. a swarming of pseudomonas syringae dc <dig>  Δargr, Δp <dig>  and Δcara after 24 h. b diameter of swimming colonies of pseudomonas syringae dc <dig>  Δargr, Δp <dig>  and Δcara after 24 h. the error bars represent the standard deviation of the mean. data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance  followed by tukey hsd for pair-wise comparisons. asterisks indicates significant difference for swarming  and swimming 



deletion of cara affects cell attachment
since motility plays an important role in the ability of the bacteria to colonize different environments and attach to surfaces, we examined the Δcara mutant using the microtiter dish assay that has become a standard tool for the study of the early stages in biofilm formation  <cit> . the Δcara mutant showed a statistically significant  increase in biofilm formation in comparison to the wild type . no observable growth differences were observed when the od <dig> of planktonic cells was measured as a function of time during the period of growth in the microtiter wells.fig.  <dig> disruption of cara enhances biofilm formation. biofilm formation by p. syringae dc <dig>  Δargr, Δp <dig>  and Δcara. cells were grown for 72 h at 28 °c in 96-well microtiter plates containing nutrient broth, and surface-associated biofilm formation was analyzed by crystal violet staining of the adherent biofilm, extraction of the crystal violet with acetic acid, and measurement of the absorbance . all experiments were done in triplicate with at minimum of three technical repeats. data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance  followed by tukey hsd for pair-wise comparisons. asterisks indicate statistically significant difference 



discussion
although the carab operon is conserved in many bacteria, its regulation is surprisingly variable.  <cit> . the well-characterized carab operon in e. coli  is regulated by several mechanisms. this operon makes use of two tandem promoters that are separately regulated by pyrimidines and arginine. the more distal or upstream promoter is regulated by numerous factors including integration host factor , the purine repressor , the pyrimidine ultilization regulator  as well as pepa, an aminopeptidase and a ump-kinase pyrh. additional regulation occurs through reiterative transcription  when dutp is available at high concentration, nascent transcripts originating at this promoter are released prematurely due to rna polymerase stuttering at a t-rich region immediately downstream from the transcriptional start site. the second  promoter is negatively regulated by the transcriptional regulator argr which consists of two trimers that are stabilized by the binding of arginine.

in contrast to e.coli, carab in p. aeruginosa is transcribed from a single promoter  <cit> . carab expression increases in response to limitation of either arginine or pyrimidine. the carab transcript includes an upstream untranslated region  that contains a potential stem-loop structure  <cit> . the pyrimidine response is reduced when a portion of the right arm of the stem-loop structure is deleted, and it is abolished when the stem-loop structure is completely removed. since carab expression continues to be responsive to arginine levels in these experiments, the stem-loop structure appears to be required specifically for pyrimidine regulation of carab.

our data shows that regulation of carab in dc <dig> resembles the regulation reported in p. aeruginosa. however there are some novel features. although the qrt-pcr data suggests that argr represses the expression of p <dig> and cara, unexpectedly our promoter fusion data shows that addition of arginine to the medium increases the expression of p <dig> and cara in contrast to the repression observed in p. aeruginosa. however the regulation of the pyrimidine pathway in pseudomonas is strongly influenced by pyrimidine and purine nucleotide effectors  <cit> . for example, the activity of the carbamoyl-phosphate synthase is inhibited by ump and activated by ornithine and n-acetylornithine  <cit>  and carab expression is subject to pyrimidine control via an attenuation mechanism. therefore it is possible, that under the conditions we examined expression, the dc <dig> cells are experiencing a high requirement for pyrimidines and expression of p <dig> and cara is not repressed upon supplementation of arginine. additionally, the cpase of previously studied pseudomonads shows in most cases only limited repression by arginine and the ability of arginine to repress genes involved in arginine biosynthesis is sometimes influenced by carbon source  <cit> . taken together our data indicates that the regulation of p <dig> and cara is complex in p. syringae and differs from the regulation observed in p. aeruginosa. more extensive analyses are needed to determine direct regulation by argr and further characterize possible post-transcriptional regulation that may be occurring in these pathways in p. syringae.

another difference we observed when compared to the p. aeruginosa is in the 5′utr of cara. our unpublished data of srnas found in p. syringae along with the mapping of the 3′ end in this study supports the notion that a small transcript is produced from the 5′utr of cara. interestingly, in p. aeruginosa a leader peptide is produced from the cara promoter region  <cit> . inspection of the p. syringae dc <dig> cara promoter region did not reveal a possible start codon that could give rise to a small peptide in this region . recently it was predicted that in p. syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448a cara is regulated by attenuation  <cit> . we hypothesize that in dc <dig> p <dig> is generated by transcription attenuation. a srna derived from the 5′utr of cara might act in trans to regulate expression of other genes. this concept was first described in e. coli  <cit> . recent studies have shown that 5′utrs of pathogenic bacteria can accumulate as stable rna molecules  <cit>  and are capable of acting in trans. work in l. monocytogenes showed that several cis-acting riboswitches located in the 5′ utrs of mrnas produce small transcripts as the result of premature transcription and these target and regulate the expression of other mrnas in trans  <cit> . the possibility that p <dig> may act in trans is intriguing. since this srna is conserved among the pseudomonads, this could add a new complexity to the regulation of arginine biosynthesis in the pseudomonads and could identify regulatory links between arginine and other regulatory pathways in these bacteria.

we found that in p. syringae a cara mutant displays reduced growth in apoloplastic fluid and reduced fitness in planta. during a screen for dc <dig> mutants that displayed reduced virulence, brooks, d.m. et al. discovered that a mutant with a tn <dig> insertion in the cara gene showed reduced virulence in a. thaliana  <cit> . although the authors suggested that the inability of the mutant to multiply to high levels in a. thaliana leaves was likely because of limited nutrients in the apoplast of a. thaliana leaves, no further studies were performed. interestingly our studies have shown that the growth defect of Δcara could not be restored at  <dig> or 12 h with addition of arginine to apoplastic fluid. surprisingly, growth of Δcara at the earlier time points could be restored to wild-type levels with the sole addition of uracil suggesting the supply of pyrimidines may be a limiting growth factor in apoplastic fluid. these data imply that there maybe sufficient arginine concentrations in planta but pyrimidines may be limiting thus resulting in reduced fitness in planta. studies have shown that of the  <dig> protein amino acids, arginine was the only amino acid that could not be detected in apoplastic fluid  <cit> . to our knowledge the concentrations of pyrimidines in the tomato hosts have not been reported. it has been reported that erwinia amylovora can obtain sufficient pyrimidines from host tissue to support growth and cause disease  <cit> . the situation we observe with p. syringae is more similar to the findings reported for some human bacterial pathogens, where de novo pyrimidine synthesis is required for growth in host-derived material  <cit> .

the p <dig> mutant was able to grow to wild type levels in planta and in apoplastic fluid extracts. however, it caused reduced disease symptoms in tomato. previous studies using dc <dig> mutants have shown that reduced symptom formation is not always associated with reduced growth in planta  <cit> . the precise role of p <dig> in as yet undefined regulatory pathways that may lead to symptom production needs to be examined further.

the cara mutant formed better biofilms but was also compromised in its ability to swarm. several mutants with insertions within genes involved in the pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway and arginine metabolism displayed reduced biofilm formation  <cit> . in vibrio parahaemolyticus  <cit>  a cara transposon mutant forms only thin pellicles at the air–medium interface. the involvement of cara in biofilm formation and swarming of p. syringae suggests that the reduced fitness in planta may be the result of multiple factors.

carab mutants of pseudomonas spp. strain g are auxotrophic for arginine as well as pyrimidines but also deficient in several traits  <cit>  such as extracellular polysaccharide production. interestingly, the carab genes from pseudomonas sp. strain g are required for the degradation of diffusible signal factor , a fatty acid signal molecule involved in regulation of virulence in several xanthomonas species as well as xylella fastidiosa  <cit> . interestingly, a carab mutant strain of halomonas eurihalina is also deficient in exopolysaccharide production  <cit> . this deficiency is thought to be a result of a decrease in the udp-sugar pool. these compounds are essential to the synthesis of nucleotide di-phospho-sugar precursors such as udp glucose and udp galactose. udp sugar is utilized in the synthesis not only of extracellular polysaccharides but also of lipopolysaccharides and the glycosylation of lipids and fatty acids. it is possible that the cara mutant of p. syringae displays altered production of extracellular polysaccharides. at least three exopolysaccharides  contribute to biofilm formation in p. aeruginosa  <cit> . p. syringae dc <dig> is able to produce psl and alginate but does not encode for genes for the polysaccharide pel  <cit> . alterations in production of psl can influence biofilm formation and swarming motility of p. aeruginosa  <cit> . our future studies will explore if there is an involvement of cara in exopolysaccharide production in p. syringae.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we found that cara of p. syringae plays an important role in providing arginine and uracil for growth of the bacterium and also influences other factors that are potentially important for growth and survival during infection. in conclusion, our data also show that cara is important for growth and survival of p. syringae in planta.
