BACKGROUND
adipose tissue biology is fundamental to functional physiology as fat is not only the major tissue of energy storage in mammals, but also an important endocrine organ  <cit> . dysfunctions in adipose tissue metabolism have become an important health concern as obesity has reached epidemic proportions  <cit>  with approximately a quarter of the world’s population being overweight or obese  <cit> . the consumption of high fat foods is clearly associated with obesity  <cit>  and as a consequence both breeding and nutritional programs have focused on increasing the leanness of beef  <cit> . meat is an important protein source and the world meat demand is projected to increase by 73% from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . fat is an important component in meat quality and impacts animal productivity  <cit> ; therefore an understanding of the molecular regulation of adipogenesis is pivotal in the development of strategies to manipulate adiposity and improve beef quality.

adipogenesis involves the development of mature adipocytes from preadipocytes  <cit>  and is responsible for modulating adiposity in individuals. adipogenesis is genetically regulated and studies have shown the importance of adipogenic transcription factors  in fat development as they regulate the expression of adipogenic genes involved in adipocyte differentiation  <cit> . however, the regulatory mechanisms of micrornas  in adipose tissue are not well understood. mirnas are small non-coding rnas composed of approximately  <dig> nucleotides that repress gene expression by binding to messenger rnas in a sequence-specific manner  <cit> . in  <dig>  mir- <dig> was the first mirna reported to affect differentiation of human adipocytes  <cit> . since then, several studies in humans and mice have shown that mirnas regulate adipogenesis in a pro or anti-adipogenic manner  <cit>  through repression of various genes, including transcriptional factors such as pparγ, pparα and klf <dig>  <cit>  or through the regulation of pathways that impact adipogenesis such as wnt signalling  <cit> . however, few mirnas had their targets identified, such as mir- <dig> that regulates pparγ and inhibits adipogenesis  <cit> , and mir-181a that regulates tnfα and increases adipogenesis  <cit> . studies using bovine adipose tissue have shown that mirna expression profiles change according to internal and external environmental factors such as subcutaneous fat thickness  <cit> , fat depot  and dietary manipulation   <cit> . however, it is not clear how mirna expression and function are impacted by the compositional structure of dna that surrounds mirna genes, also known as genomic context characteristics. these might include features such as the distance between mirna genes, which has been suggested to be a determinant for coordinated mirna expression  <cit>  or the location of mirna genes in relation to protein coding genes . the elucidation of these aspects may provide important clues with regard to the regulation and function of mirnas in bovine adipogenesis. therefore, this study aimed to determine how genomic context of mirna genes and their conservation are associated with the expression and function in bovine subcutaneous adipose tissue.

RESULTS
genomic organization of bovine mirnas
the bovine genome is organized in  <dig> pairs of autosomes and  <dig> sex chromosomes. a total of  <dig> mature mirnas have been detected in the bovine and originate from  <dig> mirnas genes coded in different genomic loci of virtually every bovine chromosome, except the sex chromosome y . it is worth mentioning that the difference in the quantity of mirnas and mirna genes happens because their relationship is not one to one, as some mirna genes may create more than one mirna  and some mirnas can originate from different mirna genes . based on mirna microarray analysis, approximately 30% of the known bovine mirnas  were detected in subcutaneous adipose tissue of which  <dig> mirnas were expressed in the subcutaneous fat of all steers  in at least one time point, being defined as the adipose tissue core mirnas  in this study even if their expressions may be not adipose tissue specific. the genomic distribution of at core mirnas was highly variable as some chromosomes  possessed no adipose core mirna genes while others coded for several, such as chromosome x which had  <dig> of them .

mature mirnas  expressed in all steers were classified into three main conservation categories:  <dig> highly conserved mirnas ,  <dig> conserved mirnas , and  <dig> poorly conserved mirnas  . the genomic context of these mirnas was also investigated in terms of organization  and their location as intergenic, intronic, exonic, or mirtron as shown in figure  <dig>  mirnas in clusters represented only  <dig> % of all bovine mirnas ; however, that percentage increased to  <dig> % when only at core mirnas  were considered, an indication of their role in the core regulation of bovine adipose tissue. the organization of mirnas in clusters was associated to conservation status as the highly conserved mirnas were by far the most numerous, representing an overlap of  <dig> % .

mirna expression in adipose tissue
expression of at core mirnas  varied widely, as microarray intensity values  ranged from close to zero  to up to  <dig>  . a power trendline illustrated the predictability of mirnas behavior in terms of average expression and variation among samples  with the equation y =  <dig> x- <dig> ,  where “y” represents mirna expression and “x” is the cv . mirna expression among steers varied considerably with type of mirna, ranging from highly uniform such as mir-26a with a coefficient of variation  of  <dig>  to highly variable such as mir- <dig> with a cv of  <dig>  . the average expression of mirnas and their coefficient of variation were negatively correlated  as highly expressed mirnas tended to occur consistently among steers while poorly expressed mirnas varied widely among individuals.

the genomic context in which at core mirnas genes are located seems to be a factor impacting expression, as clustered mirnas were more highly expressed than unclustered mirnas . however, being located in an intron of a protein coding gene  or being an independent transcription unit in between genes  did not seem to impact global mirnalevels . mirnas that were highly conserved were expressed more  than mirnas moderately conserved or poorly conserved . expression of mirnas also varied considerably within each category according to mirna gene locations, and with degree of conservation. for instance, mirnas that were poorly conserved could still be highly expressed, as was observed with mir- <dig>  which was non-clustered and poorly conserved, but the most highly expressed mirna in bovine adipose tissue .

predicted targets of at core mirnas
at core mirnas had on average  <dig> predicted targets by targetscan  <dig>  , ranging from  <dig> target genes for mir- <dig> and  <dig> targets predicted for mir-30a-5p, mir-30b-5p, mir-30c, mir-30d, and mir-30f. the number of predicted targets varied  with genomic organization and conservation, but the location of mirnas had no  relationship to number predicted targets . on average, highly conserved mirnas had three times more the number of predicted targets as compared to poorly conserved mirnas, while clustered mirnas had  <dig>  fold more predicted targets than non-clustered mirnas.

co-expression patterns of at core mirnas
the relationship among the expressions of at core mirnas across adipose tissue samples was either positively correlated, non-correlated or negatively correlated. for example, the levels of mir-20a and mir-106b were positively correlated  while mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were negatively correlated . relevant networks analysis revealed bovine mirnas with coordinated expression that were likely to participate in common biological processes in adipose tissue. mirna networks were generated by examining those mirnas that exhibited highly correlated  expression over the  <dig> adipose tissue samples . a total of six relevant networks composed of  <dig> mirnas were generated, with  <dig> mirnas in network  <dig>   <dig> in network  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas in each of networks  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the majority of mirnas  involved in the large networks  <dig> and  <dig> were highly conserved; while most mirnas  from small networks  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were poorly conserved . several mirnas in the relevant networks were members of bovine mirna clusters: mir-17-5p, 19a, 20a, 19b and  <dig> ; mir- <dig> and mir-106b ; mir-16b and 15b  and mir-15a  in network  <dig>  while in network  <dig> let-7a and let-7b were members of the let-7a ~ let-7b cluster; let-7a, let-7d, and let-7f formed the let-7a ~ let-7d cluster and let-7f and mir- <dig> were members of the 98 ~ let-7f cluster. interestingly, let-7a and let-7f were present in more than one cluster as each of them is coded by more than one mirna gene located on different chromosomes. mirna pairs in networks  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were highly correlated but, their mirna genes were not organized in clusters. for a full description of all mirna clusters expressed in adipose tissue see additional file  <dig>  a frequency histogram of all pairwise correlations among mirnas is shown in additional file  <dig> and a hierarchical dendogram clustering the expression of all  <dig> at core mirnas is shown in additional file  <dig>  quantitative rt-pcr confirmed  the correlated expression of mir-19a and mir-19b in network  <dig> and supported the microarray findings of coordinated expression among mirnas that are members of the same network .

at core mirnas hosted in protein coding genes
a total of  <dig> at core mirnas were located inside  <dig> protein coding genes. most of them were intronic , two were exonic and one was a mirtron. it is important to note that some of these genes host more than one mirna such as minichromosome maintenance complex component  <dig>  which contains mir-106b,  <dig> and  <dig>  also, some mirnas are inside introns of more than one gene as is the case for mir- <dig> within the introns of pantothenate kinase  <dig>  and pantothenate kinase  <dig> . therefore the biogenesis of intronic mirnas does not always follow the rule of a host gene originating only one intronic mirna or an intronic mirna being generated by only one host gene. intronic mirnas and their host genes may function in common in the same pathways as their expression might be coordinated. therefore, functional analysis of genes possessing intronic mirnas may reveal the biological functions of their mirnas. ipa® software  mapped  <dig> out of  <dig> genes hosting at core mirnas to the ingenuity knowledge base revealing that these mirnas are hosted by genes coding for kinases , phosphatases , other enzymes , ion channel proteins , transcription regulators , a translation regulator , transporters , and other proteins . these genes were further submitted to a core analysis  that showed that  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes were associated  with  <dig> categories of ipa molecular and cellular functions . the other  <dig> genes were not associated with ipa functions.

among the significant functions, several were related to general cellular metabolism such as small molecule biochemistry, cellular movement, cellular assembly and organization, cell cycle among others. a total of five genes were associated with lipid metabolism: e1a binding protein p <dig> , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, coactivator  <dig> beta , platelet-derived growth factor receptor, beta polypeptide , protein tyrosine kinase  <dig> , and sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor  <dig>  . each of these genes hosted a single mirna and a functional analysis indicated that these five genes were involved together in several aspects of lipid metabolism .

the relationship between genes involved in lipid metabolism and their intronic mirnas was further analyzed by comparing their expression using qrt-pcr. the analysis included ep <dig> , ppargc1b , ptk <dig>  and srebf <dig> . the expression of the pair pdgfrb  was not assessed as it was not possible to design primers for mir-1777b owing to its very high gc content. a pearson correlation analysis showed that expression of mir- <dig> and mir-33a was correlated  with their host gene, respectively, while no correlation  with the host gene was observed for mir- <dig> and mir-151-5p .

bovine specific mirnas
among the  <dig> poorly conserved at core mirnas, a total of  <dig> had seed regions  that are found only in bovine . three bovine specific mirnas  had different sequences; however, they shared the same seed region “uggggcu”. except for mir-425-5p, all bovine specific mirnas did not cluster and  <dig> out of  <dig> were located in intergenic regions. expression of bovine specific mirnas varied considerably and was as much as  <dig> fold higher for mir- <dig> than that of mir- <dig>  similarly, the numbers of predicted targets for each bovine specific mirna were highly variable .

the potential regulatory functions of the  <dig> bovine specific mirnas expressed in all cattle were investigated by performing individual target prediction analyses   <cit> . only targets predicted with total context+ scores ≤ - <dig>  were selected to reduce false positive predictions  <cit> . as mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> have the same seed region, they were analyzed as one entry “mir-1584/2412/2374”. an ipa® core analysis was performed on predicted targets of each bovine specific mirna in order to identify their function and elucidate the potential regulatory roles of these mirnas. in combination, the  <dig> core adipose bovine specific mirnas were predicted to regulate genes associated  with  <dig> different molecular and cellular functions . fifteen of these were potential regulators of pathways related to lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism and/or energy production as one or more of their predicted targets were involved  with these functions . additionally, these  <dig> mirnas were also associated with predicted targets involved in other functions including cell-to-cell signalling and interaction. mir- <dig> was the only bovine specific mirna that was not associated with any predicted molecular and cellular function.

discussion
knowledge of mirna biology has been growing consistently over the past few years, but a clear understanding of their role in the regulation of cellular metabolism remains elusive. mirnas are a group of diverse regulatory molecules with potential to target hundreds of genes  <cit>  and integrate complex molecular regulatory networks. studies have focused on identifying differential expression of mirnas in adipose of individuals submitted to opposite conditions such as low fat vs. high fat diet treatments  <cit>  or lean vs. obese individuals  <cit>  which reveals only particular aspects of mirna biology in adipose tissue. however, in this study we aimed to perform a more holistic approach by focusing on the genomic context features of mirna genes and their global expression under physiological adipose tissue conditions.

the genome of animals is mostly non-protein-coding and evidence suggests that the amount of non-coding dna and non-coding rna transcribed from it correlates well with the biological complexity of organisms in the tree of life  <cit> . to date, the amount of mirnas identified in bovine  is the third highest in mammals following to those of human  and mice   <cit> . bovine mirnas are not evenly distributed within the genome as numbers may vary up to  <dig> fold among individual chromosomes . chromosome x of several mammalian species has been reported to have a higher mirna density  as compared to those associated with autosomes  <cit> . interestingly, chromosome x had the highest number of at core mirnas expressed in our study, suggesting a relevant role of this chromosome and its mirnas in the function of adipose tissue. this variation in distribution may contribute to the differences in fat metabolism observed between male and female mammals in a manner analogous to the proposed role that mirnas on chromosome x have on immune functions between female vs. male in humans and mice  <cit> . no bovine mirna gene was identified on chromosome y. this could reflect the fact that the reference bovine genome  was generated from a cow. however, it is expected that few mirnas are coded in the bovine chromosome y as other mammals such as mice have none  and humans only have  <dig> out of  <dig> mirnas coded on chromosome y  <cit> .

a total of  <dig> mirnas were consistently detected in samples of subcutaneous adipose tissue from all individuals. however, it is probable that these mirnas are not exclusively associated with adipocytes as adipose tissue is also composed of preadipocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells and stem cells. therefore the results from this study reflect the possible role of mirna in the regulation of adipose tissue as a whole. the core adipose mirnas were heterogeneous in terms of genomic context and conservation status. a large portion  of the mirnas that integrated the core adipose mirnas was organized in clusters . they differed from non-clustered mirnas due to their close proximity on the genome , indicating that they may be subjected to coordinated expression, by sharing the same promoter  <cit> . interestingly, adipose core mirnas that organized in clusters were both from the same  or different mirna families . the presence of mirnas from different families in the same cluster suggests that coordinated expression of these mirnas enables regulation of different target messenger rnas, and consequently to control expression of different genes within a common pathway  <cit> . adipose core mirnas were coded mainly in intergenic regions ; however, intronic mirnas were also numerous . mirnas encoded in intronic regions are generally co-expressed with the host gene and may represent an auto-regulatory mechanism  <cit> . they may also support host gene expression by either down-regulating antagonist genes or fine-tuning the expression of genes  that co-operate with the host gene in specific biological processes  <cit> . exploring the functions of genes hosting intronic mirnas may provide insight into the role of these molecules in bovine adipose tissue.

the behaviour of core adipose mirnas followed a trend in which expression was inversely correlated to mirna variation among different samples. mirnas highly expressed had more consistent levels among samples, while mirnas lowly expressed were more variable  which resembles the behaviour of genes as observed in a study that profiled the expression of  <dig>  transcripts in lymphoblastoid cell lines from  <dig> humans  <cit> . the nature of the function performed by each gene is likely to influence the level of expression variation in the population  <cit> , which might also occur to mirnas. in addition, highly conserved mirnas expressed higher than poorly conserved mirnas . this result supports the idea that consistently high expressed mirnas play critical roles in the regulation of cellular processes in bovine adipose tissue as they tend to be maintained by natural selection in most vertebrates . this idea is also corroborated by the fact that highly expressed mirnas are under intense selective pressure to maintain sequence uniformity while lowly expressed mirnas tend to have much lower selection pressure being more prone to evolve rapidly  <cit> . conservation status of bovine mirnas was also associated to the amount of targets predicted by targetscan  as highly conserved mirnas had approximately three times more targets than poorly conserved mirnas. although computational tools such as targetscan are powerful predictors of mirna targets, they may generate false positive results. our results are supported by a human study that reported that highly conserved mirnas had higher repression efficiency  as compared to less conserved mirnas  <cit> . and that might be partially influenced by the fact that in general highly conserved mirnas are higher expressed then less conserved mirnas. the behavior of highly conserved mirnas was similar to that of clustered mirnas in terms of expression  and amount of predicted targets . this is explained by the fact that highly conserved mirnas tended to be organized in clusters, while less conserved mirnas were more unclustered. the association between mirna conservation and mirna genomic organization was evident when mirna relevant networks analysis was performed .

it is challenging to determine the scope of mirna regulation in a biological process as each mirna may target several mrnas and each mrna may be regulated by multiple mirnas  <cit> . evidence shows that mirnas may work in a coordinated fashion to regulate gene expression in complex networks  <cit>  and co-expressed mirnas might be part of mechanisms of functional redundancy and cooperation  <cit> . for example, a study has shown that mir- <dig> regulated the expression of lipogenic genes indirectly by controlling the expression of mir- <dig>  <cit> . however, identifying mirna functional networks is difficult as computational prediction tools are not accurate enough to identify only the true mirna targets. therefore, relying on mirna expression data is an important piece of information to determine which mirnas are functioning in a coordinated manner to regulate a certain biological process. our study identified six relevant mirna networks using mirna expression data, suggesting that mirnas regulate gene expression in bovine adipose tissue in a coordinated fashion. although it is not possible to define the exact roles of each mirna network identified in adipose tissue, some of the mirnas identified have already been studied. for example mir-17-5p, 19a, 20a, 19b and  <dig>  are part of the cluster 17 ~  <dig> which was shown to be up-regulated during the clonal expansion step of adipocyte differentiation of 3t3-l <dig> cells  <cit> . over-expression of cluster 17~ <dig> accelerated adipocyte differentiation and triglyceride accumulation by targeting and negatively regulating the gene coding tumor suppressor retinoblastoma-like  <dig>   <cit> . mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were found to be up-regulated in adipocyte differentiation  <cit>  and have been reported to play a role in the regulation of insulin sensitivity  <cit> . in this context it is likely that network  <dig> is involved in the regulation of the development and metabolism within bovine adipose tissue. similarly, network  <dig> has mirnas known to regulate adipogenesis, such as the highly expressed let- <dig> family which has been reported to regulate the transition from clonal expansion to terminal differentiation of adipocytes  <cit> . the identification of let-7a, let-7b, let-7d, let-7 g, let-7f, and mir- <dig> in network  <dig> also gives credibility to the identification of mirnas co-expression by relevant network analysis as all mirnas cited above are members of the let- <dig> family of mirnas. the smaller networks  may play a role in the regulation of bovine adipose tissue in more limited ways as they were poorly conserved and some were bovine specific . therefore, these mirna regulatory networks may contribute to species-specific metabolic characteristics in adipose tissue of bovines or other ruminants as previous studies have pinpointed that bovine adipogenesis is different than that of other species including human and mice  <cit> . functional studies and experimental validation of target genes of bovine specific mirnas may shed some light on their specific roles in the function of bovine adipose tissue. many other at core mirnas  that were not included in the relevant networks were also organized in clusters suggesting that their expression might also be coordinated with other members of the cluster.

coordinated expression does not only occur with mirnas, but intronic mirnas expression may also be coordinated with host genes  <cit> . this study revealed that 39% of core adipose mirnas were coded within introns of host genes  involved in a multitude of cellular and molecular functions . defining the function of these host genes may help identify the regulatory role of intronic mirnas, as they may assist the expression/function of the host gene  <cit>  or be involved in the same biological process. in the context of adipose tissue, five intronic mirnas were identified as being associated with genes potentially involved in lipid metabolism . in fact, some of these mirnas have already been reported to play a role in adipogenesis or lipid metabolism including mir- <dig> which was found up-regulated in steers with high levels of subcutaneous fat  <cit> . this mirna has also been reported to increase the size of lipid droplets in mice st <dig> cells when over-expressed  <cit> . similarly, mir-33a was found to be involved in the regulation of β-oxidation of fatty acids, cholesterol homeostasis and insulin signalling  <cit> . interestingly, anti-mir- <dig> therapy is under investigation as a promising method to treat cardiometabolic diseases  <cit> . mir-33a expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue was significantly correlated with its host gene srebf <dig> , a transcription factor that controls the expression of other genes involved with cholesterol metabolism  <cit> . these findings are in agreement with findings that show coordinated expression of mir-33a and srebf <dig> over a range of tissue types  <cit> . mir- <dig> also showed a coordinated expression pattern with its host gene . it is possible that mir- <dig> might play a role in adipogenesis as ep <dig> is a transcriptional co-activator of ccaat/enhancer binding protein α   <cit> , which is a critical transcription factor for adipocyte differentiation  <cit> . expression of mir- <dig> and mir-151-5p did not correlate with expression of their host genes, but this observation does not rule out the possibility that coordinated expression could still occur. for instance, mir- <dig> in bovine is coded in two different genomic locations, one is located in an intron of ppargc1b gene in chromosome  <dig>  and the other in an intergenic region in chromosome  <dig> . therefore, ppargc1b expression is not the only source for mir- <dig>  which may explain why a significant correlation was not found between mir- <dig> and ppargc1b levels. ptk <dig> is a signaling molecule that can promote cell motility  <cit>  and its expression has been reported to be coordinated with mir- <dig> in hepatocellular carcinoma tissue samples  <cit> . this could be why in adipose tissue of uniform and healthy steers the coordinated expression between mir-151-5p and ptk <dig> was not observed. others have shown that coordinated expression between intronic mirnas and host gene does not always occur as intronic mirnas can also be independently transcribed from host genes  <cit> .

the group of poorly conserved mirnas identified in this study includes a subset termed as bovine specific mirnas, which represent mirnas with a seed sequence unique to bos taurus. they accounted for approximately 15% of the bovine core adipose mirnas and were typically non-clustered . mirnas are rarely lost when an animal lineage acquires them  <cit> , therefore bovine specific mirnas are likely to be evolutionary younger than highly conserved mirnas as they are not found in other mammalian groups such as primates or rodents. the species specificity of these mirnas suggests that they may perform a regulatory function that is unique to adipose tissue metabolism in bos taurus or other ruminants. in general, species specific mirnas tend to be less expressed than highly conserved mirnas, but bovine specific mir- <dig> was the most highly expressed mirna in all animals from our study suggesting it has an established role in bovine adipose tissue. in addition, mirnas highly expressed are reported to be under a high selective pressure to maintain their sequence unaltered in comparison to lowly expressed mirnas that are rapidly evolving with frequent mutations  <cit> . analysis of predicted targets for bovine specific mirna revealed that  <dig> out of  <dig> of these core adipose mirnas may be involved in different aspects of adipose tissue energy balance by targeting genes involved in lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism and/or energy production .

the importance of mirnas is becoming more evident in the regulation of every biological process in mammals. understanding how mirnas influence adipogenesis and fat metabolism is fundamental to develop strategies to manipulate adiposity in beef cattle. progress has been made in identifying quantitative trait loci   <cit>  and genes for economically important traits in cattle. mirnas add an extra dimension of complexity to the regulation of fat metabolism and adipogenes, therefore; they should be incorporated to genetic studies in order to better understand how complex traits are controlled. future studies investigating the dynamics of mirnas in adipose tissue might consider rna-seq to further explore novel mirnas as microarrays are not able to profile the expression of unknown mirnas. high throughput sequencing studies focussing on mirnas in bovine adipose tissue are still lacking, but a recent study in swine identified a total of  <dig> unique mirnas in subcutaneous and visceral fat depots  <cit>  which suggests that there are still many unknown mirnas expressed in bovine adipose tissue that our microarray study was not able to detect. another limitation that microarray technology might present for studies comparing the expression of different mirna species is that signal intensity from hybridization might be affected by factors such as probe sequence   <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the core adipose mirnas are widely spread on bovine chromosomes, and genomic context features such as mirna organization in clusters and mirna evolutionary conservation were associated with their expression and quantity of predicted targets. core adipose mirnas are likely to work collectively as their expression revealed that  <dig> of them are part of six regulatory networks, with each displaying a unique coordinated behavior. another instance of coordinated expression was identified between two intronic mirnas and their host genes involved in lipid metabolism , suggesting these mirnas regulate the lipid metabolism pathway that involves their host genes. the specific functions of mirnas are largely unknown, especially for species specific mirnas. the bovine specific mirnas expressed in all animals accounted for almost 15% of the core adipose mirnas. they are likely to be involved in aspects of adipose tissue metabolism that are unique to bovines and or ruminants with the predicted targets suggesting that  <dig> of them play a role in regulating the energetic balance of bovine adipose tissue. the results obtained in this study expand our understanding on mirna functions and behaviour in bovine adipose tissue which might help the development in the future of new strategies to manipulate adiposity in beef cattle improving meat quality and animals productivity.
