BACKGROUND
triacylglycerols  are the main storage lipids in various organisms, such as oilseed plants, oleaginous fungi, yeasts, and microalgae. they are also a major source of highly reduced carbon molecules for food and fuel  <cit> . tags are synthesized in endoplasmic reticulum  and accumulate as oil droplets in lipid bodies, which are generated by budding off from the outer er membrane  <cit> . in the kennedy pathway, tags are synthesized by sequentially adding acyl-coas to the sn- <dig>  sn- <dig> and sn- <dig> positions of a glycerol-3-phosphate molecule  <cit> , which is controlled by four important enzymes, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase , lyso-phosphatidic acid acyltransferase , phosphatidate phosphatase  and diacylglycerol acyltransferase   <cit> . dgat has been proposed to be the rate-limiting enzyme for tag accumulation  <cit> .

in eukaryotes, three types of dgats have been reported: the endoplasmic reticulum - localized dgat <dig>  dgat <dig> and the soluble cytosolic dgat <dig>  among them, dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> are responsible for the bulk of tag synthesis in most organisms  <cit> . it has been proposed that these two enzymes have no redundant functions in tag biosynthesis  <cit> . dgat <dig> plays a dominating role in the determination of oil accumulation and fatty acid composition in seed oils  <cit> , and dgat <dig> may influence the content and composition of some plant seed oils containing unusual fatty acids  . the role of the cytosolic dgat <dig> has not yet been determined.

dgat1s are er membrane-bound proteins and possess six to nine transmembrane domains  <cit> . the most variable region of dgat <dig> is the hydrophilic n terminus, which is quite unique for each dgat <dig> and might serve distinct functions in different organisms  <cit> . several conserved motifs, including acyl-coa binding motif, dag binding motif, the fatty acid-binding protein signature and a putative c-terminal er retrieval motif, have been identified in dgat <dig>  <cit> . recently, site-directed mutagenesis was used to demonstrate the importance of some conserved residues in dgat1s. for instance, mutagenesis at p <dig> and f <dig> in tropaeolum majus dgat <dig> resulted in a total loss of dgat <dig> activity, while the substitution of s <dig> with alanine in a putative snrk <dig> target site resulted in a strong increase in dgat <dig> activity in the range of 38% to 80%  <cit> .

the first eukaryotic dgat <dig> gene was cloned from mouse  <cit> , followed by isolation from other organisms . many studies have investigated dgat1s because of their important roles in tag synthesis and have tried to use them to alter the quality and quantity of storage lipids in higher plants. for instance, the as <dig> mutant of arabidopsis, having reduced dgat activity, showed a 75% reduction in seed lipids, but the expression of arabidopsis dgat <dig> in the as <dig> mutant restored the wild-type levels of tag and very-long-chain fatty acid content  <cit> . moreover, the over-expression of atdgat <dig> can greatly enhance the tag content of transformed tobacco  <cit> . subsequently, tropaeolum majus dgat <dig> significantly contributes to seed oil biosynthesis in wild-type arabidopsis and brassica napus by over-expression  <cit> . the co-expression of an epoxygenase from stokesia laevis, slepx, and vgdgat <dig> or vgdgat <dig> from vernonia galamensis greatly increased the accumulation of vernolic acid in both petunia leaves and soybean somatic embryos  <cit> . the over-expression of dgat <dig> from jatropha curcas showed an enhanced total oil content in seeds but did not show any phenotypic differences  <cit> .

unlike oil crops, microalgae have higher biomass production rates and many are exceedingly rich in oil. therefore, microalgae have been regarded as potential resources for producing biodiesel, especially neutral lipids  . many microalgal strains have the ability to accumulate substantial amounts of lipids in the form of tags under stress conditions, such as nitrogen starvation  <cit> . so far, several dgats have been cloned and functionally characterized from microalgae. for instance, dgat1-like  <cit>  and dgat2b  <cit>  from the diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum have been functionally characterized in a tag-deficient mutant in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. furthermore, the over-expression of ptdgat <dig> in p. tricornutum resulted in a 35% increase in the neutral lipid content, and the fatty acid composition showed a significant increase in the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids  <cit> . two dgat2s  have been identified and characterized from ostreococcus tauri, and otdgat2b possesses broad substrate specificity  <cit> . tpdgat <dig> from the marine diatom thalassiosira pseudonana significantly affects the fatty acid profile of tag  <cit> . in chlamydomonas reinhardtii, homology searches identified five dgat <dig>  encoded by dgtt1-dgtt <dig>  <cit> . among them, dgtt <dig> and dgtt <dig> are active in tag synthesis following nitrogen deprivation  <cit> . the expression of crdgtt <dig> in arabidopsis increased the leaf tag content, with some molecular species containing very-long-chain fatty acids  <cit> . a gene encoding dgat <dig> was also identified in c. reinhardtii after the transcript-based correction of gene models  <cit> . other putative dgat genes have been annotated in the genomes of some microalgae, such as chlorella variabilis, coccomyxa sp. c- <dig>  volvox carteri f. nagariensis, ostreococcus lucimarinus, fragilariopsis cylindrus and so on  <cit> . however, to date, there are few reports on the function of dgat from the unicellular eukaryotic green alga, chlorella, which is a desirable resource for producing biodiesel. therefore, research on dgat from chlorella will advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying lipid metabolism during oil accumulation and will also provide a new means to improve the oil quality and content of microalgae and oil crops.

in the present study, we isolated a dgat <dig> gene  from c. ellipsoidea, a unicellular eukaryotic green alga that can be easily cultured under either autotrophic or heterotrophic conditions, and characterized its function in yeast and higher plants . compared with dgat1s of higher plants, such as glycine max, arabidopsis and brassica oleracea, cedgat <dig> could more effectively enhance fatty acid accumulation in the wild-type yeast . the over-expression of cedgat <dig> can significantly enhance the seed oil content and seed weight in arabidopsis and b. napus. furthermore, the expression pattern of the isolated dgat <dig> gene was investigated. this study would be helpful for understanding the function of dgat from microalgae and for improving oil production in b. napus.

RESULTS
identification, sequence and phylogenetic analysis of cedgat <dig> in c. ellipsoidea
based on the expressed sequence tag  data of c. ellipsoidea, a full-length cdna fragment of c. ellipsoidea dgat <dig>  designated as cedgat <dig>  was cloned and identified. the nucleotide sequence has a full cds of  <dig>  bp, encoding a polypeptide of  <dig> amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of  <dig>  kda. it was registered in genbank . cedgat <dig> shared no more than 40% identity with dgat1s of higher plants, such as g. max , z. mays , r. communis , arabidopsis , b. napus , v. fordii  and j. curcas .

to examine the relationships among different sources of dgat, a phylogenetic tree was generated from an alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of cedgat <dig> with  <dig> dgat homologues from other species . the dendrogram grouped cedgat <dig> with members of the dgat <dig> family. dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> formed a separate cluster different from dgat <dig> branches . in detail, cedgat <dig> clustered together with apdgat <dig>  and cvdgat <dig>  and formed a distinct lineage. furthermore, cedgat <dig> is more closely related to dgat1s from animals and fungi than to dgat1s from plants.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationship between cedgat <dig> and dgats from plants, animals, fungi and microalgae. sequence alignments were generated with mafft, and the phylogenetic tree was constructed by using the the maximum likelihood  method. atdgat <dig> and atdgat <dig> ; bndgat <dig> ; tmdgat <dig> ; rcdgat <dig> and rcdgat <dig> ; jcdgat <dig> and jcdgat <dig> ; vfdgat <dig>  vfdgat <dig> and vfdgat <dig> ; vvdgat <dig> ; mtdgat <dig> ; gmdgat1a ; ljdgat <dig> ; eadgat <dig> ; oedgat <dig> ; pfdgat <dig> ; epdgat <dig> ; ntdgat <dig> ; hadgat <dig> ; vgdgat <dig> ; zmdgat <dig> ; bddgat <dig> ; ppdgat <dig> ; kfdgat <dig> and kfdgat <dig> ; apdgat <dig> ; cvdgat <dig> ; tgdgat <dig> ; pbdgat <dig> ; mmdgat <dig> ; hsdgat <dig> ; btdgat <dig> ; ssdgat <dig> ; ptdgat <dig> and ptdgat <dig> ; tpdgat <dig> ; nodgat1a, nodgat1b, nodgat2a and nodgat2b   <cit> ; crdgat <dig> , and ahdgat <dig> 




protein analysis with the tmpred program  <cit>  predicted nine strongly hydrophobic transmembrane regions, which is consistent with the nine transmembrane domains predicted for b. napus dgat <dig>  t. majus dgat <dig> and arabidopsis dgat <dig>  <cit> . using the prosite database  <cit> , a number of putative functional motifs, including n-glycosylation, camp- and cgmp-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation, protein kinase c phosphorylation, casein kinase ii phosphorylation, tyrosine kinase phosphorylation, n-myristoylation and amidation sites were identified in cedgat <dig> . compared with atdgat <dig>  n-glycosylation and amidation sites were found only in cedgat <dig>  while a leucine zipper pattern was detected only in atdgat <dig>  it remains to be determined whether these sites are important for the functional regulation of the enzyme in vivo.

as previously reported  <cit> , a consensus amino acid sequence for an acyl-coa binding motif  and a conserved sequence for the dag-binding motif  of dgat were also found in cedgat <dig>  there was also a fatty acid-binding protein signature spanning residues ala <dig> to asn <dig>  containing a putative tyrosine phosphorylation site: tyr <dig>  <cit> . the cedgat <dig> protein contained an invariant proline , which is thought to participate in presenting the fatty acyl group to the active site for esterification to  glycerol and is critical for dgat <dig> activity  <cit> . a highly conserved serine residue  was essential for the activity of acyl-coa: cholesterol acyltransferase, an enzyme closely related to dgat <dig>  <cit> . cedgat <dig> showed a leucine zipper motif with only one conserved leucine  in the sequence. a visual examination of cedgat <dig> also revealed the sequence of a putative c-terminal er retrieval motif , which is similar to other dgat <dig> proteins in plants  <cit> .fig.  <dig> sequence comparison of cedgat <dig> with dgat1s from other species. ptdgat <dig> , tpdgat <dig> , atdgat <dig> , bndgat <dig> , gmdgat1a , ntdgat <dig> , rcdgat <dig> , tmdgat <dig> , vfdgat <dig> , and zmdgat <dig> . identical amino acid residues are highlighted in black. conserved motifs or putative signatures are boxed, such as the acyl-coa binding signature ; the fatty acid protein signature , which contains a tyrosine phosphorylation site ; the dag-binding site ; and the putative endoplasmic reticulum retrieval motif in the c-terminus . the highly conserved proline and serine residues are marked by asterisks. the region containing a conserved leucine repeat  is also marked




lipid analysis and expression pattern of cedgat <dig> in c. ellipsoidea
to understand the relationship between cedgat <dig> expression and lipid synthesis, we investigated the expression pattern of cedgat <dig>  the variation in biomass, and the total fatty acid  and tag contents in heterotrophic cultures of c. ellipsoidea on nitrogen-replete and nitrogen-depleted  media . as shown in fig. 3a, the algal cell biomass increased more slowly in nitrogen-depleted cultures than in nitrogen-replete cultures, but both the tfa content and tag content increased rapidly from 19% and 9% to 44% and 23%, respectively, from  <dig> to 108 h . on the contrary, tfa and tag contents were not significantly changed in the growth process of nitrogen sufficient condition. so there was a 108% and 212% increase in tfa content and tag content, respectively at the 108th hour under nitrogen-depleted culture condition than under nitrogen sufficient culture condition.fig.  <dig> biomass concentration , tfa content , tag content  and expression of cedgat <dig>  measured from  <dig> to 108 h in c. ellipsoidea cultures grown on nitrogen-replete or nitrogen-depleted  medium. the results are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation 




quantitative real-time pcr was performed to examine the expression profiles of cedgat <dig> in c. ellipsoidea cells under nitrogen-replete and nitrogen-depleted  conditions . 18s rrna was used as an internal reference control. we noted that cedgat <dig>  which catalyses the last committed step in tag biosynthesis, was downregulated under nitrogen-replete conditions. nevertheless, cedgat <dig> showed transient upregulation, with its transcript level peaking at 84 h following the onset of nitrogen depletion and declining thereafter. the upregulation of cedgat <dig> was concomitant with the increase in the tfa and tag contents under nitrogen deprivation, suggesting that cedgat <dig> was highly induced by nitrogen deprivation and that its increased expression coupled with lipid content change may play an important role in tag accumulation.

cedgat <dig> can recover the tag synthesis of the quadruple mutant yeast strain h1246
to verify the diacylglycerol acyltransferase activity of cedgat <dig>  the cedgat <dig> gene was heterologously expressed in the tag-deficient s. cerevisiae quadruple mutant strain h <dig>  <cit> , which lacks the four genes dga <dig>  lro <dig>  are <dig> and are <dig> encoding dgat, pdat , asat <dig>  and asat <dig> , respectively. these four genes are essential for the formation of neutral lipids. lipid bodies can be formed by the expression of at least one of four genes. invsc <dig> and h <dig> cells harbouring an empty pyes <dig>  vector were used as positive and negative controls, respectively.

nile red was used to stain lipid bodies in yeast cells. lipid bodies were present in the wild-type yeast strain invsc <dig> or the mutant strain transformed with the cedgat <dig> gene but were undetectable in the quadruple mutant strain carrying the empty expression vector  . the total lipids were extracted from yeast cells and then subjected to tlc  analysis. upon expression of cedgat <dig>  a prominent band corresponding to tag appeared on the tlc plate as expected, whereas no tags were identified in mutant yeast cells lacking the endogenous yeast dgat and pdat activities , which is consistent with the results from nile red staining . these results suggest that cedgat <dig> can successfully restore the ability of the quadruple mutant strain h <dig> to form neutral lipids and confirm that cedgat <dig> encodes a functional protein capable of catalysing the last step of tag biosynthesis.fig.  <dig> nile red staining and tlc analysis of transformed yeast strain h <dig>   the formation of lipid bodies is restored upon the expression of cedgat <dig> in the yeast strain h <dig>  nile red staining  and interference contrast images  of yeast. the wild-type invsc <dig> harbouring the empty vector was used as a positive control . the mutant strain h <dig> harbouring the empty vector was analysed as a negative control . the tag-deficient quadruple mutant strain h <dig> expressing cedgat <dig> . bar =  <dig>  μm.  tlc analysis of lipid extracts from yeast expressing cedgat <dig>   tag marker;  the mutant strain h <dig> harbouring the empty vector analysed as a negative control;  mutant strain h <dig> expressing cedgat1; and  the wild-type strain invsc <dig> harbouring the empty plasmid used as a positive control. se, steryl ester; tag, triacylglycerol; ffa, free fatty acid; dag, diacylglycerol




heterologous expression of cedgat <dig> can more significantly increase the total fatty acid content in the wild-type yeast than dgat1s from some higher plants
we separately transferred cedgat <dig> and another three dgat <dig> genes from higher plants, including oil crop g. max, a. thaliana and b. oleracea, into the wild-type yeast . rt-pcr results showed that the dgat <dig> genes had nearly identical expression patterns in transgenic yeast . the fatty acid contents of yeast carrying dgat <dig> genes were measured by gc. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the total fatty acid contents of yeast significantly increased due to the expression of different dgat1s when compared to the yeast transformed with pyes <dig> . in detail, the total fatty acid content in yeast carrying atdgat <dig>  gmdgat <dig>  bodgat <dig> and cedgat <dig> was  <dig>  μg/mg,  <dig>  μg/mg,  <dig>  μg/mg and  <dig>  μg/mg, respectively. among the yeast expressing different dgat <dig> genes, the total fatty acid content in the yeast transformed with cedgat <dig> increased most remarkably, by 142%. in contrast , the total fatty acid contents of the yeasts transformed with the three dgat <dig> genes from higher plants significantly decreased by 19% , 16%  and 11% , respectively. these results suggest that cedgat <dig> may function in improving the oil content of plants, especially oil crops.fig.  <dig> fatty acids analysis of the wild-type yeast invsc <dig> expressing dgat1s. ck, the wild-type yeast invsc <dig> transformed with pyes <dig> ; atdgat <dig>  gmdgat <dig>  bodgat <dig>  and cedgat <dig> are transgenic yeast invsc <dig> expressing atdgat <dig>  gmdgat <dig>  bodgat <dig> and cedgat <dig>  respectively; c16: <dig>  palmitic acid; c16: <dig>  palmitoleic acid; c18: <dig>  stearic acid; c18: <dig>  oleic acid; and total, the sum of the c16: <dig>  c16: <dig>  c18: <dig> and c18: <dig> contents. the bars are the standard deviations  of three technical repeats. for the same fatty acid component, the numbers with different letters are statistically significant 




over-expression of cedgat <dig> enhances the seed oil content and seed weight in higher plants
to explore cedgat <dig> as a tool to manipulate acyl-coa pools and to engineer tags in plants, cedgat <dig> was over-expressed in arabidopsis and b. napus var. westar under the control of the constitutive nos promoter. in arabidopsis, three independent homozygous lines were selected for advancement to the t <dig> generation and used for detailed analysis. rt-pcr results showed that the cedgat <dig> transcript was expressed in transgenic lines over-expressing cedgat <dig> . the transgenic lines did not show any visible morphological difference from untransformed control plants . gc analysis revealed that the transformation of wild-type arabidopsis with cedgat <dig> leads to a higher seed oil content . the average total fatty acid content in wild-type arabidopsis seeds was  <dig>  mg/100 mg of seed, but increased to  <dig> – <dig>  mg/100 mg in the transgenic lines. thus, the transgenic seeds displayed an approximately 8–37% higher oil content than that of wild-type plants. in addition, the  <dig> -seed weight of transgenic plants was 9–15% greater than that of the control .fig.  <dig> the detection of the fatty acid content and the  <dig> -seed weight of cedgat <dig> transgenic arabidopsis. a average total fatty acid content in dry seeds of different homozygous  transgenic arabidopsis lines. b average  <dig> -seed weight  of transgenic arabidopsis t <dig> seeds. col- <dig>  wild type arabidopsis; cedgat1- <dig>  cedgat1- <dig>  and cedgat1- <dig>  transgenic arabidopsis lines expressing cedgat1; c16: <dig>  palmitic acid; c18: <dig>  stearic acid; c18: <dig>  oleic acid; c18: <dig>  linoleic acid; c18: <dig>  linolenic acid; c20: <dig>  eicosenoic acid; and total, the sum of the c16: <dig>  c18: <dig>  c18: <dig>  c18: <dig>  c18: <dig> and c20: <dig> contents. the bars are the standard deviations  of three technical repeats. for the same fatty acid component, numbers with different letters are statistically significant 




in b. napus, twelve transgenic plants were identified by pcr , and four of the twelve independent t <dig> transgenic b. napus lines were chosen for further analysis. the rt-pcr results showed that the cedgat <dig> transcript was expressed in transgenic lines . again, transgenic b. napus lines did not show any visible morphological difference from wild-type plants . the fatty acid content in the seeds of wild-type b. napus and transgenic lines was measured using gc. as shown in fig. 7a, the average total fatty acid content in wild-type b. napus seeds was  <dig>  mg/100 mg of seed. in lines expressing cedgat <dig> under the nos promoter, the total fatty acid content increased to  <dig> – <dig>  mg/100 mg of seed, representing an increase of 12–18% over the control. moreover, the average  <dig> -seed weight in the cedgat <dig> transgenic lines increased by 6–29% compared to that of wild-type plants . these results indicated that the cedgat <dig> gene can stimulate fatty acid biosynthesis and enhance seed weight.fig.  <dig> the detection of the fatty acid content and the  <dig> -seed weight of cedgat <dig> transgenic b. napus. a average total fatty acid content in dry seeds of different  transgenic b. napus lines. b average  <dig> -seed weight  of transgenic b. napus t <dig> seeds. westar, wild type b. napus var. westar; cedgat1- <dig>  cedgat1- <dig>  cedgat1- <dig>  and cedgat1- <dig>  transgenic b. napus lines expressing cedgat1; c16: <dig>  palmitic acid; c18: <dig>  stearic acid; c18: <dig>  oleic acid; c18: <dig>  linoleic acid; c18: <dig>  linolenic acid; and total, the sum of the c16: <dig>  c18: <dig>  c18: <dig>  c18: <dig> and c18: <dig> contents. the bars are the standard deviations  of three technical repeats. for the same fatty acid component, numbers with different letters are statistically significant

discussion
tags are quantitatively the most important storage form of energy for eukaryotic cells. the synthesis of tag from dag by dgat is believed to be the major flux control step in oil biosynthesis. much research has focused on dgat because it is an enzyme unique to tag synthesis in plants. however, the function of dgat <dig> from chlorella has not been reported.

in this study we cloned and characterized a novel dgat <dig> gene  from c. ellipsoidea. protein-protein blast showed that cedgat <dig> shared no more than 40% identity with dgat1s of higher plants, which resulted in a difference in the predicted three-dimensional structures . functional characterization in yeast showed that cedgat <dig> can increase the tag content more than can atdgat <dig>  gmdgat <dig> and bodgat <dig>  resulting in a significant increase in the total lipid content of yeast of 142%. further investigations of the relationships between the cedgat <dig> activity and structure are needed. its higher activity provides a scientific and economic basis for the use of c. ellipsoidea as an oil-producing alga to produce more oil in a short time.

in higher plants, the expression of dgat generally correlates with oil deposition in developing seeds  <cit> . for soybeans, a stronger expression of dgat <dig> was found in developing seeds than in other tissues  <cit> . however, dgat <dig> transcripts were also detected in other plant tissues, e.g., atdgat was expressed in a wide range of tissues but most strongly in developing embryos and flower petals  <cit> . dgat <dig> is also highly expressed during pollen development, presumably contributing to tag accumulation in the pollen grain  <cit> . these findings suggested that these dgat enzymes may be related to other physiological processes in addition to seed oil synthesis  <cit> . for unicellular eukaryotic green algae, all physiological processes take place within a cell; thus, the expression of dgat <dig> can directly reflect the dynamics of tag accumulation.

the effect of nutrition pattern alteration on algal cell growth, lipid accumulation, and cellular component changes has been analysed in several studies . upon nitrogen starvation, both starches and lipids increased greatly within c. zofingiensis  <cit>  and nannochloropsis oceanica cells  <cit> , and n-deficiency plus p-repletion was a promising lipid trigger to motivate lipid accumulation in c. protothecoides cells  <cit> . in c. reinhardtii, three genes encoding acyltransferases, dgat <dig>  dgtt <dig>  and pdat <dig>  were induced by nitrogen starvation and are likely to play a role in tag accumulation based on their patterns of expression  <cit> . at the transcript level in n. oceanica, enhanced tag synthesis under n-depleted conditions primarily involved the upregulation of seven putative dgat genes and the downregulation of six other dgat genes  <cit> . however, the expression patterns of lipid biosynthesis-related genes, including dgat <dig> in chlorella, have not been extensively studied in these processes. our results revealed that the upregulation of cedgat <dig> was closely related to the significant increase in the tfa and tag contents under nitrogen deprivation, suggesting that cedgat <dig> plays an important role in tag accumulation. our findings contribute to the understanding of the microalgal response to element deprivation and the mechanism of lipid synthesis and accumulation in chlorella, but much remains to be elucidated regarding the precise contribution of n starvation to microalgal metabolism.

several previous studies have reported that the genetic manipulation of dgat can lead to increased oil biosynthesis in arabidopsis and b. napus. for instance, the seed-specific over-expression of a. thaliana dgat <dig> in wild-type arabidopsis can increase the seed oil content by 11–28% and the seed weight by  <dig> – <dig> %  <cit> . similarly, the seed-specific expression of tmdgat <dig> in wild-type arabidopsis resulted in a 10–33% net increase in the seed oil content and a 15% increase in the  <dig> -seed weight in transgenic arabidopsis. furthermore, the seed-specific expression of tmdgat <dig> in high-erucic acid b. napus led to a net increase of 11–15% in the seed oil content of transgenic plants  <cit> . in addition, the over-expression of atdgat <dig> and bndgat <dig> in canola under the control of the napin promoter led to an increase of  <dig> –7% in the oil content  <cit> . the over-expression of jcdgat <dig> in arabidopsis under both camv35s promoter and a seed specific promoter resulted in a 30–41% increase in the seed oil content  <cit> . our studies showed that the expression of cedgat <dig> in arabidopsis and b. napus under the nos promoter does indeed increase oil biosynthesis in transgenic seeds by approximately 8–37% and 12–18% over that of the control. in addition, neither the arabidopsis nor the b. napus cedgat <dig> transformants showed significant changes in fatty acid composition. in some studies, however, there were alterations in the oil composition through dgat expression. the over-expression of jcdgat <dig> in arabidopsis resulted in a significant decrease in oleic acid  and an increase in linolenic acid   <cit> , and the transgenic expression of sesamum indicum dgat <dig> in arabidopsis led to an increase in eicosenoic acid  and a reduction in oleic acid  in seed oil  <cit> . more importantly, the expression of cedgat <dig> in arabidopsis and b. napus under the nos promoter also led to a significant increase in the average  <dig> -seed weight in cedgat <dig> transgenic lines, by 9–15% and 6–29% in arabidopsis and b. napus, respectively, and thus there was no decrease in the  <dig> -seed weight caused by the oil content increase. considering the constitutive expression of cedgat <dig> under the nos promoter, larger increments in seed oil biosynthesis and seed weight can probably be expected when using a seed specific promoter. furthermore, there was a difference between cedgat <dig> transgenic arabidopsis and b. napus, with respect to effects on seed oil biosynthesis and seed weight. the seed oil content increased more in transgenic arabidopsis than in b. napus, but the average seed weight increase was greater in b. napus. interestingly, the increase in the oil content on a per- <dig> -seed basis was similar between transgenic arabidopsis and b. napus, at approximately 25–50%. to date, there has been no report that the over-expression of dgat <dig> can significantly increase the seed weight in the oil plant b. napus, although this effect has been reported in arabidopsis. in addition, transgenic plants showed no other phenotypic differences. therefore, cedgat <dig> should have great potential for increasing the net oil production of the oil plant oilseed rape.

CONCLUSIONS
we cloned a novel dgat <dig> gene  from c. ellipsoidea. cedgat <dig> is novel protein, sharing a low identity  with dgat1s from higher plants. the expression of cedgat <dig> is highly related to rapid lipid accumulation in c. ellipsoidea under nitrogen deprivation. in yeast, the expression of cedgat <dig> can significantly increase the lipid content and shows greater ability for improving the lipid synthesis than dgat1s from some higher plants, including that from soybean. moreover, the expression of cedgat <dig> in arabidopsis and oilseed rape can lead to a net increase in the  <dig> -seed lipid content of transgenic plants of 25–50%. these findings should be helpful for understanding the function of dgat from microalgae and the mechanism of lipid synthesis and accumulation and may also provide technology for enhancing lipid production in microalgae and oil plants.
