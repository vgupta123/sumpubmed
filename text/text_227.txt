BACKGROUND
micrornas  are short non-coding rnas of approximately  <dig> nucleotides with some differences in one or two nucleotides in the 3' terminus. in eukaryotes, mirna affects the stability and/or translation of mrnas and is involved in the regulation of various biological processes, such as development, differentiation, and apoptosis  <cit> . it has been reported that more than one-third of human genes can be targeted by mirna and mirnas have been linked to conditions such as lymphoma, leukemia, and lung adenocarcinoma  <cit> . stage-specific, tissue-specific and relatively low expression results in considerable mirna complexity. thus, identification of the functions of mirna is an important and challenging problem.

although bioprocesses involving mirna-mrna interactions, such as cleavage and translational repression of target mrna, depending on the degree of base pairing between the mirna and the mrna sequence, are understood, actual correlation and the mechanism of these interactions are still unclear. since mirna lin- <dig> and let- <dig> were discovered in caenorhabditis elegans, there has been a huge focus on this field and a large number of mirnas have been identified in various species  <cit> . there are  <dig> mature mirna sequences in the current mirbase sequence database   <cit> . despite this large number of mirnas identified, only a few mirna targets are known. according to tarbase  <dig> , there are only  <dig> experimentally validated target sites, which is much less than the number of mirna sequences  <cit> , so target identification is important in understanding the mechanism and biological functions of mirna-mrna interactions.

since the first mirna target prediction algorithm was published  <cit> , an increasing number of computational algorithms have been developed for this purpose. three main types of features have been successfully applied in these algorithms: the complementarity of the seed region in the 5' terminus, thermodynamic stability, and cross-species conservation  <cit> . however, researchers had to designate a few arbitrary kilobases downstream from the stop codon when an experimentally validated 3' untranslated region  was lacking for certain species  <cit> . the thermodynamic stability is useful for secondary structure prediction since mirna binds to the rna-induced silencing complex to form a large protein complex. moreover, experiments have revealed that approximately 30% of mirnas do not exhibit cross-species conservation  <cit> .

hence, machine learning algorithms were developed and shed light on the prediction of mirna targets. based on sequence information, targetboost refined some significant features to improve the performance of model and was capable of predicting more actual target genes  <cit> . by extracting similar features from experimental data, mitarget and nbmirtar were developed using a support vector machine and a na√Øve bayes approach, respectively  <cit> ; both yielded satisfactory prediction results when artificial negative data were used for model training.

an ensemble prediction algorithm for human mirna targets developed using absolute experimentally validated data yielded a cross-validation  accuracy of  <dig> %  <cit> . however, through rigorous selection, only  <dig> positive and  <dig> negative samples were used for training. another algorithm, mirtif, was released with  <dig> positive and  <dig> negative experimentally validated target sites, for which a duplex binding picture for prediction by rnahybrid was available for  <dig> new negative samples. the algorithm achieved sensitivity of  <dig> % and specificity of  <dig> %  <cit> . however, the current set of experimentally validated negative samples is insufficient to represent the negative class and therefore more negative data are required. hence, two negative data sets were generated in our study.

microarrays can also provide many experimental data for training models. recently, several studies reported on mirna target prediction from microarray data analysis  <cit> . mirtarget <dig>  which was developed based on microarray data, is considered to have great potential for high-throughout target validation by transcriptional profiling and improved mirna target prediction, with a result of  <dig>  for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve   <cit> .

in the present study, systematic analysis of feature importance was performed based on permutation importance and conditional variable importance strategies. a random forest  approach was applied for prediction of mirna-target interactions. three types of features were considered, sequence, structural, and positional features. these features were extracted from binding pictures of mirna-target duplexes and regarded as a unit  instead of being artificially divided into two segments. this approach might well preserve the actual biological properties. for each single feature set and the whole hybrid feature set, model training was repeated  <dig> times. the models yielded high sensitivity and specificity and the feature importance scores were then calculated. only statistically significant features were used to refine the models, which yielded similar accuracy to that obtained in previous studies. our results indicate that these features significantly contribute to the performance of the model and will help in reducing the number of experimental procedures required in research into mirna-target interactions.

RESULTS
feature extraction
all features were classified as sequence, structural or positional features. studies have demonstrated that thermodynamic stability plays an important role in mirna target prediction and machine learning algorithms have confirmed this  <cit> . in our feature extraction procedure, several features relate to thermodynamic feature indirectly, because the rna secondary structure prediction was based on thermodynamic properties. target sites for seed and non-seed segments were treated artificially in previous studies, which destroy the integrity of the target site and leads to underinvestigation of relevant biological properties. here, a mirna-target duplex was treated as a unit, which overcomes the disadvantage of previous methods, and feature extraction was parsed using perl.

sequence features  mainly include base frequencies and compositions. background frequencies  have typically been used to produce artificial negative samples  <cit> . in microarray data analysis, researchers discovered that the four base frequencies were significantly different for candidate downregulated and normal genes. furthermore, many dinucleotide sequences are statistically significant in mirna target prediction  <cit> .

structural features , including folding information for mirna-target duplexes, should have the necessary information and should be crucial for recognition of mirna-target interactions. three main types of structural features, stems, loops and bulges, were used to represent rna secondary structure. a well-known perfect or near-perfect pairing seed region is fairly important for these interactions . in addition, various types of loops and bulges in both seed and non-seed regions also affect the interactions  <cit> .

a a stem is defined as a set of consecutive pairs separated by unpaired bases.

b a loop is defined as a set of unpaired bases between two strands.

c a bulge is defined as a set of unpaired bases only in one strand

positional features  reflect the mechanism of mirna-target interactions. saunders et al. investigated polymorphism of mirna-target duplexes using single nucleotide polymorphism data, which revealed that a base mutation in the target sequence affects the regulation function of mirna  <cit> . these studies suggest that position-specific states  may be important for mirna target identification. here only  <dig> nucleotides from the 5' terminus were considered. four binary numbers were used to represent a position. if the sequence length is <  <dig> nt, the rf algorithm can automatically set the missing positions as missing values and replace them with the most frequent non-missing value .

prediction performance with rf
we used the rf algorithm and optimized the parameters. two parameters, number of trees to grow ntree and number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split mtry were optimized using a grid search approach. during the grid search, the values of ntree = { <dig>   <dig>  500} and mtry = { <dig>  mdim, 1} were optimized based on 10-fold cross-validation , which is partitions the original sample into  <dig> subsamples,  <dig> subsamples are to train model and the remainder one to test model and this process repeats  <dig> times. we then selected the value for the best-performing parameters to estimate the performance of the training model. it has been reported that an out-of-bag  error is very similar to the classification error for cross-validation , which is a built-in measure of performance  <cit> . table s <dig> lists the predictor performance comparison between based on cross-validation and oob estimate .

rf models were constructed using seq, stru, posi, and the total feature set for two difference negative data sets;  <dig> samples from each class were randomly selected and used for training. this procedure was repeated  <dig> times and the average fraction of true positive  and true negative  predictions were used to determine the accuracy . the average prediction results for the models are listed in table  <dig>  models based on the negative data set neg_ <dig> yielded higher accuracy than those based on neg_ <dig>  except for specificity for seq and posi, probably because of the different data sources. the performance using sequence or structural features was worse than that for positional features. our models achieved sensitivity of  <dig>  and specificity of  <dig>  for neg_ <dig> and sensitivity of  <dig>  and specificity of  <dig>  for neg_ <dig> using positional features. these results indicate that positional features yield a low number of false positive predictions and good model performance. several studies have clearly shown an increase in the accuracy of prediction on combining numerous features. however, the hybrid of different feature types did not yield the highest accuracy  for neg_ <dig>  this indicates that negative correlation occurs in hybrids of different features. hence, we examined the interactions among different features in each set using correlation analysis .

cross-validation was used to estimate the predictor performance of seq, stru, posi sets and the total feature set for two differet negative data sets. neg_ <dig> comprises all experimental samples and inferred negative samples and neg_ <dig> comprises all experimental samples and artificial negative samples from miranda. sensitivity  was calculated as tp/ and specificity  as tn/, where tp is the number of true positives, tn is the number of true negatives, fp is the number of false positives and fn is the number of false negatives.

feature importance measures
current classification tasks need a measure of feature importance rather than only predicting the response using "black-box" models. here, two different strategies were applied to measure feature importance in the prediction of mirna-target interactions.

permutation importance analysis of rf
rf is a classification method that also provides feature importance measures. it can distinguish significant predictor features from uninformative features and reduces interactions among features as much as possible. three measures of feature importance, the selection frequency, gini importance and permutation importance, are available. in the present study, permutation importance was used as to measure feature importance in mirna-target interactions separately for three feature sets to distinguish significant functional predictor features. the process was repeated  <dig> times with random resampling of constructed models and the feature measure scores were calculated. the distributions of these scores are shown in figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

for sequence features , the percentage of match bases greatly contributes to recognition of interactions for both neg_ <dig> and neg_ <dig>  the results are consistent with those of previous studies  <cit> . in addition, several dinucleotide and trinucleotide sequences were also statistically significant, such as uc, gg, cuc, and agg. however, probably because of the negative data sources, base frequencies for a, g, and u in neg_ <dig> were ranked in the top  <dig>  the results indicate that sequence-based feature importance depends on the data source.

the most informative structural feature was the stem, which indicated matching conditions for both seed and non-seed regions. bulges provide more insight into mirna-target interactions than loops do because more informative features are relate to bulges than to loops . the overhang also has a significant effect on classification, which depends on the nature of the mirna-target duplex. features related to stems revealed that a length of  <dig> nt may be a more suitable definition of the seed region, although false mirna targets usually had a match of <  <dig> nt in the seed region. moreover, 1-nt bulges and 2-nt loops were ranked top and thus might greatly affect mirna-target interactions.

positional features suggested that non-seed regions also play an important role in mirna-target interactions as shown by figure  <dig>  in which matching/mismatching serve as the positive/negative class, respectively. it has been shown in many studies that perfect or near-perfect base pairing in the seed region greatly contributes to the performance of models. our results confirm that most of the dominant functional positional features are in the seed region.

a new feature importance measure strategy using hybrid models
a further investigation was implemented for a combination of the three feature sets. in this section, a novel conditional feature importance strategy was used to evaluate the total features. this strategy was implemented using the cforest function of the party package in r language, which can generate additional information on feature interactions  <cit> .

a combination of three feature sets was considered to evaluate the feature importance using conditional variable importance strategy. training data were randomly sampled and the procedure was repeated  <dig> times as above. some of the significant features are shown in figure  <dig>  the measure strongly indicates that positional features greatly contribute to mirna-target interactions because most statistically significant features are positional features in neg_ <dig>  however, sequence features are dominant in the statistically significant features in neg_ <dig>  these results are in agreement with the rf permutation importance. in addition, this strategy based on conditional inference trees seems to produce less noise than a permutation importance strategy.

prediction performance of using only statistically significant features
to demonstrate the statistically significant features for predicting mirna-target interactions, we compared the performance of different feature sets using only the significant features for two different negative data sets. the procedure is summarized below.

 calculate the feature importance score for each feature and rank the features according to these scores.

 eliminate the last feature and use the remaining features to construct a model.

 repeat step  <dig> until a remarkable decrease in accuracy occurs.

 the remaining features are considered statistically significant and are used to construct a model. receiver operating characteristic  are used to evaluate the prediction sensitivity and specificity.

we used this procedure to analyze the contribution of statistically significant features to the prediction accuracy . finally, the top  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> statistically significant features were used to construct models for seq, stru, posi and total feature sets, which yielded auc values of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  for neg_ <dig> and  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  for neg_ <dig>  respectively. figure  <dig> shows roc curves for each feature set for the two data sets. the highest accuracy was obtained by combining three types of feature sets. it is clear that the positional feature set exhibits higher accuracy than the other two feature types. the positional features were first investigated using mitarget, in which there are five position-based features ranked in the top  <dig>  all belonging to the seed region. however, our positional features include two pieces of information: the type of nucleotide and whether it matches or not.

in nbmirtar, most statistically significant features were associated with loops and bulges, similar to the structural features of our method. its motif features correspond to dinucleotide and trinucleotide sequences in our method. our results prove that stems greatly contribute to recognition of mirna-target interactions. more systematic analysis of dinucleotide and trinucleotide sequences was carried out in this study. mirtif uses various k-gram frequencies as features for a triplet svm classifier to predict pre-mirna  <cit> . it is thought that these features represent the real environment for mirna-target interactions. however, they might not be suitable for guiding experimental procedures.

CONCLUSIONS
mirna investigation not only sheds new light on rna function, but can also reveal the mechanism involved in cell function and regulation. the actual correlation and mechanism for mirna-target interactions are still unclear. however, the best solution might involve a combination of experimental and computational approaches. our results demonstrate that this method yields good prediction and is robust. moreover, the results will be useful in designing experimental procedures. as more experimental and unbiased data become available, our approach could be improved and used to identify more reliable predictor features reflecting real mirna-target interactions.
