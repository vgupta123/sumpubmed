BACKGROUND
non-small cell lung cancer  is a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide with over one million deaths annually  <cit> . it accounts for 75% of lung cancer cases and consists of three major subtypes: adenocarcinoma, large-cell carcinoma, and squamous-cell carcinoma  <cit> . recent introduction of targeted therapy and increasing numbers of available chemotherapeutic regimens, such as platinums, taxanes and gemcitabine, do not effectively cure nsclc patients, with varied response towards treatment and occurrence of drug toxicity  <cit> . in addition, prognosis remains dismal in nsclc patients albeit careful evaluation of clinico-pathological factors that determine patient response to therapy, such as tumor, nodes and metastasis  staging, performance status, gender and weight loss. the long-term survival rate is low with only 14% of patients surviving five years after diagnosis  <cit>  and the risk for relapse is high.

gemcitabine is a third generation chemotherapeutic agent that has shown activity in nsclc. preclinical studies have shown that the compound is a potent radiosensitizer, with response in stage iii nsclc  <cit> . gemcitabine can be administered as a single agent, or in platinum and non-platinum combination. the agent can also be combined with the chemotherapy drug pemetrexed, as well as the vascular endothelial growth factor  inhibitor, for adenocarcinoma nsclc. due to its significant benefit and advantageous toxicity profile, gemcitabine has since evolved to become one of the most commonly used agents for lung cancer chemotherapy.

in recent years, much effort has been expended to identify genetic determinants in patient outcomes, so as to improve clinical treatment decisions and for the design of therapeutic agents. the epidermal growth factor receptor  mutations, for instance, are common in patients with nsclc  <cit> , and are known to confer survival benefit and better clinical outcome when treated with egfr tyrosine kinase inhibitors   <cit> . to date, no known genetic variants have been reported, that could help determine the dose and clinical outcomes in nsclc patients receiving gemcitabine chemotherapy.

here, we studied the polymorphism of genes involved in gemcitabine transport, metabolism and activity, based on their association to patient outcome after gemcitabine therapy. we showed for the first time that the single nucleotide polymorphism  pola2+ <dig> gg/ga  is a key determinant of mortality and survival outcome in gemcitabine-treated nsclc patients. the pola <dig> gene encodes dna polymerase alpha subunit b in humans, which is involved in the initiation of chromosomal dna replication  <cit> . the snp causes dna polymerase alpha subunit b to localize in the cytoplasm instead of the nucleus. this inhibits dna replication in cancer cells and confers a protective effect in individuals with this snp. the results suggest that pola2+ <dig> gg/ga  may be used as a prognostic biomarker of patient outcome in nsclc pathogenesis.

RESULTS
association of genotypes and the mortality of nsclc patients after gemcitabine therapy
how genetic variations affect the survival outcome of nsclc patients after gemcitabine therapy is im-portant for improved clinical treatment decisions and for the design of therapeutic agents. using fisher's exact probability test and chi-squared test, we show, for the first time, that pola2+ <dig> gg/ga  is the most statistically significant snp to be associated with mortality , with a p value of  <dig> . the pola <dig> gene corresponds to the p <dig> subunit of mouse dna polymerase alpha, which couples the catalytic subunit of polymerase alpha to the primases, and translocates the polymerase alpha/primase complex from the cytoplasm to the nucleus for chromosomal dna replication  <cit> .

fisher's exact probability test and chi-squared test are used. only the top  <dig> ranked snp genotypes are shown.

pola2+1747=gg/ga imposes differential effects on mortality and survival time of nsclc patients after gemcitabine therapy
using conditional probability test, we studied the effects of this pola <dig> variant on mortality of patients after gemcitabine therapy. we found that the probability of death  for patients with wild-type gg genotype is significantly higher  than those with ga variant .

next, we studied the interactions among these  <dig> non-synonymous snps and how they impact the overall survival time of nsclc patients. table  <dig> shows the top ranked snp-snp interactions  that are associated with overall survival times of nsclc patients. among them, statistically significant differences in survival time between wild-type gg and variant ga genotypes are observed in pola2+ <dig> gg/ga together with slc28a2+ <dig> cc , and pola2+ <dig> gg/ga together with slc28a2+ <dig> cc . it is noteworthy that all the top-ranked snp-snp interactions listed in table  <dig> involved pola <dig>  this clearly emphasizes the im-portance of pola <dig> as a potential biomarker. these significant differences in survival time are depicted in kaplan-meier plot as shown in figure  <dig>  patients with pola2+1747=ga variant exhibit improved overall survival, as compared to their gg counterparts.

log-rank test and chi-squared test are used. only the top  <dig> ranked genotype interaction pairs are shown.

pola2+ <dig> ga together with slc28a2+ <dig> cc are observed to be associated with increased median survival time . for pola2+ <dig> gg/ga together with slc28a2+ <dig> cc, the median overall survival time of patients is  <dig>  months and  <dig>  months in patients with gg and ga genotypes, respectively . likewise, we also observed that the pola2+ <dig> ga together with slc28a2+ <dig> cc are associated with increased median survival time . for pola2+ <dig> gg/ga together with slc28a2+225=cc, the median overall survival time of patients with the wild-type gg genotype was  <dig>  months and for ga variant is  <dig>  months  .this result indicates that the non-synonymous pola2+ <dig> ga snp is an important interactor associated with increased survival time.

computational prediction of functional effects of pola <dig> g583r
polyphen- <dig>  <cit>  predicted pola <dig> g583r  to be "possibly damaging" with a score of  <dig>   and snap  suggested it to be "non-neutral". in contrast, when we used either the rsid or our alignment of orthologues  as input for sift , the prediction was both "tolerated" with scores  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . figure 2a shows the homology model of pola <dig> in complex with the carboxyl-terminal domain of dna polymerase alpha . the snp is located far from the evolutionary widely conserved interaction surface of the catalytic subunit in an opposite surface loop. this region is not particularly conserved among remote orthologues ranging from human to yeast and plants. hence, the functional importance, if any, would be restricted to a subset of species more closely related to human. when we used foldx  to predict the effect of the snp on protein structure stability, interestingly, the average free energy change of the snp was significantly elevated  which means that the snp has a destabilizing effect on the protein structure . since this result was derived from an energy minimized but static homology model, we wanted to see if this effect can also be reproduced in a dynamic model through molecular dynamics simulations. indeed,  <dig> repetitions each of wildtype and mutant pola <dig> simulations over 10ns in explicit water showed that the surface loop region harbouring the mutation is consistently destabilized and more flexible through g583r additional file 2: fig s <dig> and additional file 3: s3). in the absence of presumably catalytic residues around the mutation site, the surface-exposed nature and taxon-restricted conservation of the loop would suggest a possible role for this region in protein interactions. based on our structural modelling and simulations, the altered conformation and increased flexibility through the g583r mutation could potentially disrupt protein interactions. it is known that complex formation with various partners can influence pola <dig> nuclear shuttling. therefore, we hypothesized that a possible functional effect of g583r could be altering pola <dig> localization in the cell.

subcellular localization of wild type pola <dig> and mutant pola <dig> g583r proteins
subcellular localization of proteins can help elucidate functional changes between wild type and mutant pola2+ <dig>  pola2+ <dig> gg/ga snp encodes for a glycine to arginine amino acid change  in the mutated pola <dig> protein . to study the subcellular distribution of the mutant and wild type dna polymerase alpha subunit b, we constructed gfp fusion proteins and transfected hek  <dig> cells. untransfected hek  <dig> cells were used as mock control to check the efficiency of the transfection reagent or other nonspecific effects. hek  <dig> cells transfected with empty pegfp-n <dig> vector were used to check the localization of gfp fusion proteins. to ensure that these proteins were successfully expressed in hek  <dig> cells after transfection, we developed western blots containing hek  <dig> cell lysate proteins and immunostained the blots with mouse anti-gfp, followed by goat anti mouse igg-hrp. no protein band is observed for untransfected hek  <dig> cells. protein band size of about  <dig> kda is observed for gfp control. on the other hand, the lanes for gfp constructs containing mutant pola <dig> g583r and wild type pola <dig> show us the expected protein band size of about  <dig> kda each . this indicates that the proteins are successfully expressed in the transfected cells. the subcellular localization of the mutant and wild type dna polymerase alpha subunit b was studied with microscopy . untransfected hek  <dig> cells show no green fluorescence from gfp. for the pegfp-n <dig> control, the green fluorescence protein is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. we find that wild type dna polymerase alpha subunit b is localized in the nucleus , whereas, the dna polymerase alpha subunit b mutant  is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm.

discussion
in a recent study on genes involved in gemcitabine pharmacology in ethnic asian populations <cit> , we reported on the use of a statistical approach to examine associations between genotypes and the outcome of nsclc patients including response rate, time to progression, gemcitabine toxicity and overall survival. we have now extended the study to another aspect of nsclc patient outcome that was not examined previously, i.e. mortality, and also shown here that the pola2+ <dig> gg/ga  is strongly associated with mortality rate and survival time among nsclc patients treated with gemcitabine. we have previously shown that this particular snp by itself did not have a significant effect on survival time  <cit> . now, we found that its interaction with slc28a2+ <dig> cc and slc28a2+ <dig> cc led to an increase in the overall survival times of nsclc patients.

this pola2+ <dig> variant  is not only present in the european and african populations  <cit> , but is also prevalent in the asian population among chinese, indians and malays  <cit> . this snp encodes for a glycine to arginine amino acid change , where g is an ancestral allele, resulting inside chain polarity and charge reversal. here, we showed, through biostatistics, that individuals with the ancestral allele g for pola <dig> tend to have lower survival rates in nsclc pathogenesis, compared to individuals with ga polymorphism. to unravel possible molecular mechanisms of functional effects of this mutation, we utilized multiple computational approaches based on evolutionary conservation, structural modelling and molecular dynamics simulations. given its location in a surface loop of the structure and causing flexible rearrangements of this surface area, we hypothesized that it could disrupt protein interactions which may be important for subcellular localization. indeed, we experimentally showed that this point mutation is functionally significant, leading to a change in localization that is likely to affect regulatory activity and induces better survival in nsclc patients treated with gemcitabine. the wild type pola <dig> that is known to facilitate nuclear dna replication is predominantly found in the nucleus, whereas the mutant pola <dig> g583r protein  <cit>  that is strongly associated with better survival in nsclc patients is mainly localized in the cytoplasm. dna polymerase alpha subunit b is required for cell viability  <cit> . by localizing in the cytoplasm, nuclear dna polymerase alpha activity is inhibited. this confers a protective effect in nsclc patients who possess the pola2+ <dig> gg/ga snp genotype, as the tumour dna could not replicate. this inhibits tumour cell proliferation, and ultimately results in tumour cell death.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we established that the pola2+ <dig> gg/ga  is a genetic determinant of clinical outcomes in nsclc patients receiving gemcitabine treatment. egfr mutations are used for profiling nsclc patients treated with egfr tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and similarly, the findings in this article can become a stepping stone for the discovery of new options for gemcitabine-based therapy. due to the lack of genetic variants that could help determine the dose and clinical outcomes in nsclc patients receiving gemcitabine chemotherapy, such biomarkers would be useful for doctors in treating patients more efficiently to achieve satisfactory clinical outcome and better survival.

statistical analyses
fisher's exact probability test was used to assess the relationship between each of the  <dig> snps and the mortality of  <dig> nsclc patients based on the p-values between genotypes. conditional probability of death given a geno-type of a snp was used to characterize the differential effects on mortality. chi-squared test was employed to confirm the significance  of the difference between genotypes. differences were considered statistically significant when the p value was less than  <dig> . all statistical tests were two-sided. kaplan-meier method and log-rank test were used to compare overall survival time for interaction pairs. spss software version  <dig>   was used.

bioinformatics analysis
in order to investigate possible effects of pola <dig> g583r  in terms of protein function, we analysed the mutation with polyphen- <dig> version  <dig> . <dig> using the rsid  of pola <dig> g583r as input, snap using the amino acid sequence of human pola <dig>  as input  and sift using a curated alignment of orthologous sequences . orthologous sequences of human pola <dig>  were retrieved with the orthologue search in annotator . a multiple alignment was created using mafft with the l-ins-i algorithm . after deleting sequence that had large gaps in jalview , we selected diverse organisms and  <dig> remaining sequences were compared.

homology modelling of human pola <dig> was performed with modeller  using the crystal structure of the carboxyl-terminal domain of yeast dna polymerase alpha in complex with its b subunit   as template. then, the alignment containing  <dig> diverse orthologous sequences  was used to calculate the conservation on individual positions using the evolutionary trace algorithm  and the level of residue conservation was mapped to its corresponding position in the model and visualized with yasara . moreover, we used foldx  with prior energy minimization using the repairpdb function and  <dig> repetitions of the mutation stability change calculations to predict the snp effect on protein structure stability. lastly, we performed  <dig> wildtype and  <dig> mutant md simulations over  <dig> ns in explicit water using the amber <dig> force field in yasara  following standard protocols to understand the effect of the snp on protein structure flexibility.
