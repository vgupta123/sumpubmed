BACKGROUND
currently, the large-scale experimental identification of both morbid genes, i.e. those genes whose mutations cause hereditary human diseases, and druggable genes, i.e. genes coding for proteins whose modulation by small molecules elicits phenotypic effects, demands time-consuming and laborious approaches that are impractical for rapidly revealing the causal relationships between genes and diseases and determining the druggability of gene products. the discovery of morbid genes, for instance, requires a large effort to gather inheritance patterns from families with the disease and to perform linkage and mutation analyses in order to identify candidate gene involved in a particular hereditary disorder  <cit> . in similar fashion, the discovery of new drug targets also requires a large effort involving a variety of genomics, proteomics, genetic association and forward and reverse genetics-related techniques  <cit>  in order to find drugs capable to modulate disease processes.

in the light of above mentioned facts, a computational approach which could accurately predict morbid and druggable genes, especially on a genome-wide scale, would be thus invaluable since the number of experimental techniques to be performed to discover these genes could be minimized. with the vast amount of current available systems-level data, such as molecular interaction data and genome-wide gene expression and subcellular localization data, we have now the opportunity for developing a computational approach based on data mining tools, such as machine learning, to extract patterns that could be used as genome-wide predictors of morbid and druggable genes. based on this assumption, we have previously used a machine learning-based methodology as a data mining tool to extract knowledge from systems-level data and then apply this knowledge to predict essential genes on a genome-wide scale and determine cellular rules for essentiality on escherichia coli <cit>  and saccharomyces cerevisiae <cit> . in addition to attain successful prediction rates, we have also obtained biologically plausible cellular rules for gene essentiality using this machine learning approach.

due this successful prediction of essential genes and determination of cellular rules for gene essentiality in escherichia coli and saccharomyces cerevisiae, we sought to verify in this present work whether a similar machine learning-based approach is able to predict human morbid and druggable genes on a genome-wide scale and to reveal cellular rules governing morbidity and druggability of genes. using knowledge acquired from network topological features, tissue expression profile and subcellular localization data, we show here that the classifiers trained on these systems-level data can reliably predict morbid and druggable genes on a genome-wide scale and also can define some general rules governing morbidity and druggability in human.

RESULTS
the integrated network of human gene interactions and calculation of topological features
for obtaining the network topological features used as training data for predicting morbid and druggable genes, we first constructed an integrated network of human gene interactions  simultaneously containing experimentally verified protein physical interactions, metabolic interactions and transcriptional regulation interactions . this network is comprised by  <dig>  genes interacting with one another via  <dig>  protein physical interactions,  <dig>  metabolic interactions and  <dig>  transcriptional regulation interactions. inhgi contains approximately 25% of the already identified ≈  <dig>  human genes according to the entrezgene database  <cit> .

from the inhgi, we calculated  <dig> different topological features for each gene, including degree centralities for each type of interaction, clustering coefficient, betweenness centralities for each type of interaction, closeness centrality and identicalness. the detailed description of these topological features and how they were calculated are found in the additional file  <dig> and “methods”.

evaluation of classifier performance
to examine how well a machine learning-based approach is able to predict human morbid and druggable genes on a genome-wide scale using knowledge acquired from systems-level data, we designed a meta-classifier similar to that used to predict essential genes in escherichia coli <cit>  and saccharomyces cerevisiae <cit>  and trained it on network topological features, tissue expression profile and subcellular localization data of known morbid and druggable genes . we then assessed its performance by measuring its median recall, precision and area under the curve  of the receiver operating characteristic  curve across  <dig> different normal morbidity datasets and  <dig> different normal druggability datasets .

before analyzing the performance measures of our meta-classifier trained on the datasets described above, we decided to estimate the performance measures of our meta-classifier on equivalent normal morbidity and druggability datasets where the class labels—morbid and druggable—were randomly shuffled among genes  and then compared them with our meta-classifier trained on the normal morbidity and druggability datasets. this was done to check whether the meta-classifier trained on non-shuffled datasets learned the traits actually associated with morbidity and druggability instead of traits associated with any random subset of genes. for this comparison, we used the wilcoxon signed-rank statistical test as described in “methods”. as can be observed in table  <dig>  all performance measures of our meta-classifier trained on the correspondent shuffled datasets were statistically different from measures of meta-classifier trained on normal datasets , thereby indicating that the traits actually associated with morbidity and druggability were learned by our meta-classifier.

after confirmation that our meta-classifier trained on normal datasets was likely to learn the traits actually associated with morbidity and druggability, we aimed to analyze its performance measures. as shown in table  <dig>  for the genome-wide prediction of morbid genes, our meta-classifier achieved a median recall of  <dig>  and a median precision of  <dig> , i.e., it correctly recovered  <dig> % of known morbid genes with a precision of  <dig> %. furthermore, the probability of a gene predicted as morbid belongs to the set of known morbid genes is  <dig> % as indicated by the median auc. for the genome-wide prediction of druggable genes, our meta-classifier achieved a median recall of  <dig>  and a median precision of  <dig> , i.e, it correctly recovered  <dig> % of known druggable genes with a precision of  <dig> % . furthermore, the probability of a gene predicted as druggable belongs to the set of known druggable genes is  <dig> % as indicated by the median auc.

the moderate values for both median recall  and median precision  for genome-wide prediction of morbid genes indicate that the level of noise in the training data is high and likely associated with existence of shared common features between morbid and non-morbid genes that induced our meta-classifier to yield a moderate performance in discriminating morbid from non-morbid genes. this could be partially due to the approach used to select non-morbid genes: since it is impossible at present to compile a list of genes not known to cause any hereditary disease, we selected genes not known to be morbid, i.e., all genes in inhgi except the known morbid genes, as non-morbid genes. thus, some of these non-morbid genes may actually be existing unknown morbid genes sharing common characteristics with the existing known morbid genes. other contributing factor for the existence of shared common features between morbid and non-morbid genes could be the incompleteness of inhgi: stumpf et al. <cit> , for example, have estimated that the size of human interactome  is about  <dig>  interactions. since our network contains about  <dig>  protein-protein interactions, we could envisage that the values of all network topological parameters might change with the enlargement of network size and, therefore, some of the network topological parameters-related shared common features between morbid and non-morbid might disappear as a consequence. the existence of shared common features between druggable and non-druggable genes also seems to affect the performance of our meta-classifier, but to a lesser extent: our meta-classifier achieved reliables values for the median recall  and precision  for genome-wide prediction of druggable genes .

despite these limitations discussed above, our meta-classifier trained on network topological features, tissue expression profile and subcellular localization data seems indeed to be a reliable predictor of morbid and druggable genes on a genome-wide scale as shown by figures  <dig> and 2: the frequency distribution of known morbid and known druggable genes per intervals of morbidity and druggability scores—probabilities of classifying genes as morbid and druggable, respectively, as output by the meta-classifier —tend to increase as morbidity  and druggability  scores increase.

evaluation of individual features on classifier performance
we sought to verify the influence of individual features on the meta-classifier performance. to achieve this goal, we first trained our meta-classifier on normal morbidity and druggability datasets without one of the features, which we call “without-one-feature” datasets as described in “methods” . we then compared the output auc values with those of meta-classifier trained on datasets with all features by using the wilcoxon signed-rank statistical test  <cit> . a difference is considered statistically significant if the obtained w is lower than or equal to wc with a given n at the p =  <dig>  level . note that we use auc instead of recall or precision to compare the overall performances of meta-classifiers because it represents the meta-classifier performance across all combinations of recall and precision . table  <dig> shows that the median auc of our meta-classifier trained on morbidity datasets without the number of tissues in which the gene is expressed at least  <dig> transcripts per million   was statistically lower than the median auc for normal morbidity datasets . so, the tissue expression profile seems to be an important feature to distinguish morbids from non-morbids genes.

as shown in table  <dig>  for prediction of druggable genes, the overall performance  of our meta-classifier was statistically lower following the removal of the plasma membrane feature . this result is in concert with the most important cellular rule for druggability derived from the analysis of decision trees  that we will show in the section“cellular rules for gene morbidity and druggability”): if proteins are located in plasma membrane, their encoding genes are likely to be druggable. this rule is supported by bakheet and doig  <cit>  that demonstrated that proteins encoded by druggable genes had more transmembrane helices than proteins encoded by non-druggable ones which suggests that proteins encoded by druggable genes are more likely to be found in plasma membrane.

comparison with other methods
regarding prediction of morbid genes, there have been several methods available for predicting morbid genes  <cit> . however, our method can not be directly compared to most of them since they have been constructed to predict only small sets of disease-specific candidate genes, such as endeavour  <cit>  and toppgene  <cit> , while our method has been constructed for the genome-wide prediction of morbid genes. we can, however, compare our method to prospectr  <cit> , cipher  <cit>  and that developed by xu and li  <cit> . our method outperforms cipher  and is comparable to prospectr that achieves a recall of  <dig> , a precision of  <dig>  and an auc of  <dig> . although prospectr has a higher recall, we considered our method comparable to it as the precision and auc values of our method are higher than those of prospectr. moreover, our performance measures are medians of  <dig> runs of 10-cross-fold validation , while the performance measures of prospectr were obtained by only one run of 10-cross-fold validation.

the method developed by xu and li is the only genome-wide prediction method that apparently outperforms our method . their method is also based on network topological parameters, but while we trained our meta-classifier on various features, including  <dig> network topological parameters , they trained their classifiers on only five network topological parameters: degree, defined as the number of links to node i; 1n index, defined as the proportion of the number of links to morbid genes among all links to node i; 2n index, defined as the proportion of the number of links to morbid genes among all links to neighbors of node i; the average distance to morbid genes; and positive topological coefficient, a variant of the classical topological coefficient  <cit> . the apparent success of xu and li approach in predicting morbid genes mostly relies on the 2n index: when node i is a morbid gene, 2n index is always higher than zero since at least one neighbor of node i’s neighbor—the node i itself—is a morbid gene; if node i is a non-morbid gene, 2n index is higher than or equal to zero. thus, this parameter induces a spurious correlation on dataset that is captured by classifiers that, in turn, achieve high performance measures. therefore, the xu and li method can be disregarded for comparison purposes and, accordingly, our approach, although showing moderate recall and precision values, is currently, along with prospectr, the most accurate predictor of morbid genes on a genome-wide scale.

concerning the prediction of druggable genes, as for prediction of morbid genes, we can compare our method only with those developed to predict druggable genes on a genome-wide scale. therefore, to our knowledge, we can compare our methodology with that developed by sugaya and ikeda  <cit> . using support vector machines trained on  <dig> different features covering structural, drug and chemical, and functional information on protein-protein interactions, sugaya and ikeda classifiers achieved an average recall of 75%, an average precision of 70% and an average auc of 72%, performance measures comparable to those obtained by our meta-classifier.

prediction of novel morbid and druggable genes
since the morbidity and druggability of most of genes in inhgi are unknown—only ≈ 14% and ≈ 3% are known to be morbid and druggable, respectively—we applied our trained meta-classifier to determine the morbidity and druggability statuses of these genes. instead of simply predicting genes as morbid or druggable, we decided to assign a “morbidity score” and a “druggability score”  to each gene since we understand that there is no gene that is absolutely non-morbid or non-druggable. we also assigned to each gene a “shuffled morbidity score” and a “shuffled druggability score” to test the significance of normal scores. for this purpose, we used the wilcoxon signed-rank statistical test as described in “methods”.

two potential morbid genes, thbs <dig> and timp <dig>  reinforce the fact that our meta-classifier is able to reveal unexpectedly roles for morbid genes in the modulation of diseases caused by other seemingly unrelated genes. mutations in the gene thbs <dig> have been suggested to play a role in atherosclerosis and thrombosis  <cit> , but its encoded protein may be considered a promising therapeutic target for diabetic nephropathy  <cit> ; alterations in timp <dig> has been demonstrated to be one of the causes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  <cit> , but targeting its encoded protein may be a therapeutic intervention against connective amino acid tissue degradation  <cit> .

cellular rules for gene morbidity and druggability
beyond the prediction capability, machine learning techniques can be used for knowledge acquisition in order to describe patterns in datasets. the machine learning algorithms most used for knowledge acquisition are those that generate decision trees. decision trees are decision support tools inferred from the training data that use a graph of conditions and their possible consequences. the structure of a decision tree consists of a root node representing the most important condition for discriminating classes, internal nodes representing additional conditions for class discrimination under the main condition, and leaf nodes representing the final classification. so, one can learn the conditions for classifying instances in a given class by following the path from the root node to the leaf node  <cit> .

therefore, in order to discover the rules for gene morbidity and druggability, we analyzed decision trees generated by training the j <dig> algorithm, a weka’s implementation of the c <dig>  algorithm  <cit>  , on the normal morbidity and druggability datasets containing all network topological features, tissue expression profiles and subcellular localization as training data. the decision trees in figures  <dig> and  <dig> are the best representative tree among the  <dig> generated decision trees for morbidity  and the  <dig> generated decision trees for druggability .

from the best representative decision tree for morbidity, we were able to devise some general rules for morbidity in human. as we can observe in figure  <dig>  the root node of decision tree is the number of transcription factors that regulate a given gene . so, this attribute can be considered the most important feature, among those used to train the j <dig> algorithm, for discriminating a morbid from a non-morbid gene. to reinforce this, we found, by walking the path from root node to first leaf node through the right branch, the following rule for morbidity: if genes are regulated by more than one transcription factor, they are likely to be morbid . the study by reverter et al. <cit>  supports this rule as they showed that morbid genes are more likely to show tissue specific expression than non-morbid ones. genes whose expression is tissue specific tend to be regulated by more transcription factors than those that are ubiquitously expressed, e.g. housekeeping genes, since a high level of transcriptional regulation is needed in this case.

walking the path from root node to first and second leaf nodes through the left branch , we found the following rule for morbidity: if genes are regulated by one transcription factor and their encoded proteins are either centrally located in metabolic pathways  or play a role in the extracellular region, genes are likely to be morbid. this rule is supported by jimenez-sanchez and colleagues  <cit>  that showed that morbid genes are more likely to be enzymes than non-morbid ones and by winter et al.  <cit>  that demonstrated that ≈ 40% of proteins encoded by morbid genes are predicted to be secreted. furthermore, if proteins are neither centrally located in metabolic pathways nor play a role in the extracellular region but are located in plasma membrane and tend to form clusters with other proteins , their encoding genes are likely to be morbid. for this rule, we could not find any article supporting it. therefore, the plasma membrane localization of proteins encoded by morbid genes as well as the tendency of these proteins to form clusters with other proteins are issues to be examined.

from the best representative decision tree for druggability, we were able to devise some general rules for druggability in human. as we can observe in figure  <dig>  the root node of decision tree is the plasma membrane localization of proteins. so, this attribute can be considered the most important feature, among those used to train the j <dig> algorithm, for discriminating a druggable from a non-druggable gene. to reinforce this, we found, by walking the path from root node to first leaf node through the right branch, the following rule for druggability: if proteins are located in plasma membrane, their encoding genes are likely to be druggable . this rule is supported by bakheet and doig  <cit>  that demonstrated that proteins encoded by druggable genes had more transmembrane helices than proteins encoded by non-druggable ones which suggests that proteins encoded by druggable genes are more likely to be found in plasma membrane. walking the path from root node to first and second leaf nodes through the left branch , we found the following rule for druggability: if proteins are not located in plasma membrane but are either centrally located in a transcriptional regulatory circuitry  or are enzymes , their encoding genes are likely to be druggable. this rule is partially supported by bakheet and doig  <cit>  as they showed that druggable proteins are more likely to be enzymes than non-morbid ones. in respect to central position in a transcriptional regulatory circuitry, this is an issue that remains to be elucidated.

CONCLUSIONS
the identification of morbid and druggable genes has largely been an experimental effort mostly performed by time-consuming experiments. in an effort to accelerate the pace of discovery of such genes, we designed a machine learning-based computational approach that relies on network topological features, tissue expression profile and subcellular localization information for predicting morbid and druggable genes in human on a genome-wide scale.

we could demonstrate that our method is able to reliable predict morbid and druggable genes on a genome-wide scale as demonstrated by  the moderate to high performance measures achieved by the meta-classifiers ,  the observation that the designed meta-classifiers learned traits actually related to morbidity and druggability instead of traits associated with any random sets of genes  and  the fact that known morbid and druggable genes tend to have high morbidity and druggability scores, respectively . furthermore, in comparison with other available genome-wide prediction methods, the performance of our method proved to be equal or superior . we could also devise some cellular rules for gene morbidity and druggability using all network topological features, tissue expression profile and subcellular localization information as learning attributes for generation of decision trees . we discovered that number of regulating transcription factors, the central position in metabolic pathways, the localization of their encoded proteins in extracellular region and plasma membrane and tendency to form clusters with other proteins are important factors determining gene morbidity. in respect to druggability, the important factors determining druggability are plasma membrane localization, a central position in a transcriptional regulatory circuitry and being an enzyme. the fact that almost all discovered rules are supported by some additional evidences solidifies decision trees as useful tools for extracting knowledge from complex biological data. albeit the good prediction performance and the ability to discover cellular rules for morbidity and druggability, our approach suffers from three limitations. first, it depends on existing gene ontology annotation and interaction data which are likely to be enriched in small-scale experiments involving morbid and druggable genes. second, the construction of an integrated network of gene interactions requires a large amount of experimental interaction data that are currently available only to a limited number of human genes—our inhgi, for example, covers only ≈ 25% of already identified human genes. third, the lack of negative examples to train the classifier forces us to consider all genes not known to be morbid or druggable as de facto non-morbid and non-druggable genes. we expect, however, that such limitations will be soon addressed as more systems-level data are generated.
