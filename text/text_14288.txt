BACKGROUND
the burkholderia cepacia complex  is a group of at least seventeen species of gram-negative opportunistic pathogens. although these organisms can infect patients with a broad range of chronic conditions, the majority of infections occur in those with cystic fibrosis   <cit> . because the lungs of these individuals contain thick mucus that cannot be cleared by the mucociliary escalator, they are susceptible to pulmonary infections by microorganisms such as pseudomonas, staphylococcus, haemophilus and burkholderia  <cit> . the prevalence of bcc infection in american cf patients was  <dig> % in  <dig>  <cit> . although this prevalence is low compared to that of pseudomonas aeruginosa , there are three reasons why the bcc is a serious problem for the cf population  <cit> . first, bcc bacteria cause severe and potentially fatal respiratory infections. when compared to patients infected with pseudomonas, those with bcc infections have reduced lung function and, depending on the species present, increased mortality  <cit> . in approximately 20% of cases, these individuals develop a rapidly fatal condition called 'cepacia syndrome,' which is characterized by lung abscesses and septicemia  <cit> . second, bcc bacteria can spread from person-to-person. it has been shown that at least five bcc species can be transmitted in this manner: burkholderia cepacia, burkholderia multivorans, burkholderia cenocepacia, burkholderia dolosa and burkholderia contaminans  <cit> . because of the potential for these organisms to spread among a susceptible population, bcc culture-positive patients are isolated from other individuals with cf, a measure that has serious social and psychological implications  <cit> . finally, bcc bacteria are resistant to most antibiotics. these species have a variety of resistance mechanisms including β-lactamases, efflux pumps and biofilm formation  <cit> . the most effective anti-bcc antibiotics - ceftazidime, meropenem and minocycline - only inhibit between 23-38% of clinical isolates  <cit> .

because conventional antibiotics are largely ineffective against the bcc, phage therapy is being explored as a possible alternative treatment. phage therapy is the clinical administration of bacteriophages  to prevent and/or to treat bacterial infections  <cit> . although phages have been used therapeutically for almost a century, this treatment fell out of favor in north america and western europe when penicillin and other chemical antibiotics became widely available in the 1940s  <cit> . however, there has been renewed interest in this field following the emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria such as those of the bcc  <cit> . three recent studies have shown that phages are active against the bcc in vivo. seed and dennis showed that treatment of b. cenocepacia-infected galleria mellonella larvae with phages ks <dig>  ks4-m or ks <dig> increased survival  <dig> hours post-infection, even when treatment with the latter two phages was delayed for  <dig> to  <dig> hours  <cit> . carmody et al. showed that intraperitoneal administration of phage bcepil <dig> to b. cenocepacia-infected mice decreased bacterial density in the lungs and led to decreased expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines mip- <dig> and tnf-α  <cit> . lynch et al. published the first description of an engineered bcc phage and showed that this mutant  was able to increase survival of b. cenocepacia-infected g. mellonella  <dig> hours post-infection  <cit> .

before a phage can be safely used clinically, its complete genome sequence must be determined to assess whether the phage is obligately lytic or temperate, and to determine by homology whether the phage genome encodes any putative virulence factors. this report describes the genome sequence of three novel bcc phages and their relatedness to enterobacteria phage p <dig>  p <dig> is a temperate myovirus that was isolated from e. coli strain li by bertani in  <dig>  <cit> . p <dig> has recently been classified as part of a novel subfamily, placing it in the order caudovirales, family myoviridae, subfamily peduovirinae and genus "p2-like viruses"  <cit> . this genus includes phages p <dig>  wϕ,  <dig> and psp <dig> of enterobacteria, l-413c of yersinia, fels- <dig> and sopeϕ of salmonella, ϕ-mhaa1-phl <dig> of mannheimia, ϕctx of pseudomonas, rsa <dig> of ralstonia, ϕe <dig> of burkholderia thailandensis and ϕ <dig> and ϕe12- <dig> of burkholderia pseudomallei  <cit> . based on sequence analysis, it is proposed that the bcc-specific phages ks <dig> , ks <dig>  and kl <dig>  should also be classified as part of this genus  <cit> .

RESULTS
isolation, host range and morphology
seed and dennis isolated ks <dig> from an extract of onion soil plated on b. cenocepacia k56- <dig>  <cit> . this phage produces clear plaques on k56- <dig> with a diameter of  <dig> - <dig>  mm  <cit> . previously, ks <dig> was tested for its ability to form plaques on k56- <dig> lps mutants and it was determined that it could efficiently lyse wildtype k56- <dig> , xoa <dig> , xoa <dig> , xoa <dig>  and rsf <dig> , but not xoa <dig>  or ccb <dig>   <cit> . based on these results, it was predicted that ks <dig> uses the k56- <dig> lps as a receptor and that it binds within the core region  <cit> . ks <dig> has a relatively wide host range compared to many bcc phages, infecting b. multivorans c <dig> and b. cenocepacia 715j, j <dig>  k56- <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  <cit> .

ks <dig> was isolated from an extract of dracaena sp. soil plated on b. multivorans  c <dig>  <cit> . both bcc phages and bacteria have been recovered from the dracaena rhizosphere  <cit> . on c <dig>  ks <dig> forms small clear plaques  <dig> - <dig>  mm in diameter, similar to the morphology of ks <dig> on k56- <dig>  the host range of ks <dig> includes b. multivorans c <dig> and c <dig>  b. cenocepacia 715j, c <dig>  c <dig> and pc <dig>  b. dolosa lmg  <dig> and burkholderia ambifaria lmg  <dig>  <cit> .

kl <dig> was isolated from a single plaque on a lawn of b. cenocepacia cep <dig>  an australian cf epidemic isolate  <cit> . phage induction from cep <dig> was stochastic, as treatment with inducing agents such as uv or mitomycin c was not necessary. on lmg  <dig>  kl <dig> forms small turbid plaques  <dig> - <dig>  mm in diameter. kl <dig> has a narrow host range, infecting b. ambifaria lmg  <dig> 

electron microscopy of ks <dig>  ks <dig> and kl <dig> indicates that these phages belong to the family myoviridae . these three phages exhibit the a <dig> morphotype, with icosahedral capsids and contractile tails  <cit> . ks <dig>  ks <dig> and kl <dig> have similarly sized capsids, each  <dig> nm in diameter . in contrast, their tails vary in length:  <dig> nm for ks <dig>   <dig> nm for ks <dig> and  <dig> nm for kl <dig> . these sizes correspond to the length of the tail tape measure protein for each of these three phages: ks <dig> gp <dig> is  <dig> amino acids  in length, ks <dig> gp <dig> is  <dig> aa and kl <dig> gp <dig> is  <dig> aa .

genome characterization
ks5
the ks <dig> genome is  <dig> base pairs  in length and encodes  <dig> proteins  . this genome has a  <dig> % g+c content. forty-three of the start codons are atg,  <dig> are gtg and  <dig> is ttg . as ks <dig> was isolated from an environmental sample, it was predicted that this phage might be obligately lytic  <cit> . however, ks <dig> encodes an integrase and a repressor and is found as a prophage in chromosome  <dig> of the fully sequenced b. multivorans strain atcc  <dig>  . because of this similarity, the possibility exists that ks <dig> originated from atcc  <dig> or a closely related strain found in the soil enrichment. excluding the atcc  <dig> prophage, ks <dig> is most similar to a putative prophage element in burkholderia multivorans cgd <dig>  twenty-three of  <dig> ks <dig> proteins are most closely related to a protein from cgd <dig>  with percent identities ranging from 72-99% .

ks14
the ks <dig> genome is  <dig> bp in length and encodes  <dig> proteins . this genome has a  <dig> % g+c content. forty-one of the start codons are atg,  <dig> are gtg and  <dig> is ttg . all predicted ks <dig> proteins show similarity to at least one protein in the database  except for gp <dig> and gp <dig>  the protein with the most similarity to others in the database is the terminase large subunit, gp <dig>  which has 75% identity with a protein of unknown function duf <dig> of burkholderia sp. ccge <dig>  aside from gp <dig> and gp <dig>  the least similar protein is the hypothetical protein gp <dig>  which has 29% identity with the flagellar hook-associated protein flgk of acidovorax ebreus tpsy .

kl3
the kl <dig> genome is  <dig> bp in length and encodes  <dig> proteins . this genome has a  <dig> % g+c content. fifty-one of the start codons are atg and  <dig> is gtg . similarly to ks <dig>  all predicted kl <dig> proteins show similarity to at least one protein in the database except for gp <dig>  the proteins with the most similarity to others in the database are the terminase large subunit  and the portal protein  that have 99% identity with burkholderia glumae bgr <dig> proteins and the hypothetical protein gp <dig> which has 99% identity with a b. ambifaria mex- <dig> protein. aside from gp <dig>  the least similar protein is the hypothetical protein gp <dig>  which has 50% identity with the hypothetical protein bubob_ <dig> of burkholderia ubonensis bu .

modular organization
the genome maps of ks <dig>  ks <dig> and kl <dig> are shown in figure  <dig>  each of these phages has a modular organization, with genes for tail formation , lysis  and head formation  clustered in each phage . in ks <dig>  genes 13- <dig>  22- <dig>  29- <dig> and  <dig> encode tail proteins, genes 31- <dig> encode lysis proteins and genes 38- <dig> encode capsid proteins . in ks <dig>  genes 10- <dig> and  <dig> encode tail proteins, genes 25- <dig> encode lysis proteins and genes 31- <dig> encode capsid proteins . in kl <dig>  genes 15- <dig>  29- <dig> and  <dig> encode tail proteins, genes 31- <dig> encode lysis proteins and genes 37- <dig> encode capsid proteins . in addition, kl <dig> has a three-gene dna modification module : gene  <dig>  encoding an ecorii-c restriction endonuclease, gene  <dig>  encoding a vsr endonuclease and gene  <dig>  encoding an ecorii methylase .

similarity to p2
ks <dig>  ks <dig> and kl <dig> all show similarity to enterobacteria phage p <dig> . a four-way comparison of the p <dig>  ks <dig>  ks <dig> and kl <dig> genomes prepared using promer/mummer/circos is shown in figure  <dig>  in this comparison, regions of similarity on the same strand are shown in green, while regions of similarity on the opposite strand are shown in red. the majority of similar regions among these phages are on the same strand, except for a short conserved region in ks <dig> and kl <dig> containing dna methylase genes  on the minus strand in ks <dig> and on the plus strand in kl <dig> . ks <dig>  ks <dig> and kl <dig> all encode proteins similar to phage p <dig> d, u, t, e, e+e', fii, fi, i, j, w, v, s, r and x  and l, m, n, o, p and q  . in addition, ks <dig> gp <dig> and kl <dig> gp <dig> are similar to ogr , ks <dig> gp <dig> is similar to old , ks <dig> gp <dig> is similar to g  and ks <dig> gp26/gp <dig> and kl <dig> gp32/gp <dig> are similar to lysbc  . the percent identity of the similar proteins ranges from 25-64% in ks <dig>  24-64% in ks <dig> and 31-62% in kl <dig> .

abbreviations: % id, percent identity.

the genes in common between p <dig> and the p2-like bcc phages are almost exclusively limited to structural genes involved in virion formation . other p <dig> genes, such as those involved in dna replication, phage immunity, lysogeny and lysis are dissimilar among these phages. a similar pattern is observed  following coregenes analysis of the p2-like phages ϕe <dig> of b. thailandensis and ϕ <dig> and ϕe12- <dig> of b. pseudomallei   <cit> . a likely explanation for this pattern is that, while phage structural components predominantly interact with each other, components from other phage systems may interact with host-specific proteins   <cit> . ks <dig>  ks <dig> and kl <dig> appear to have retained p <dig> modules for the closely interacting capsid and tail proteins, while acquiring new modules for carrying out burkholderia host-specific processes. these genes replace p <dig> genes at the right end of the p <dig> genome , p <dig> z/fun  and p <dig> orf <dig>   <cit> . as it is very common for genes not found in p <dig> to be identified in these three regions in other p2-like phages, it is predicted that these loci contain genes that have been acquired via horizontal transfer  <cit> .

although a phage may show relatedness to a well-characterized phage such as p <dig>  specific guidelines must be used to determine both the degree of relatedness of two phages and if the novel phage can be classified as a "p2-like virus" in a strict taxonomic sense. lavigne et al. proposed the use of the comparison program coregenes to aid in phage taxonomic analysis  <cit> . this program can be used to compare the proteomes of two or more phages  <cit> . if a phage shares at least 40% of its proteins  with a reference phage such as p <dig>  then these two phages can be considered as part of the same genus, while if it shares 20-39% of its proteins with a reference phage, then they can be considered as part of the same subfamily  <cit> . when ks <dig>  ks <dig> and kl <dig> were analyzed with coregenes using p <dig> as a reference genome, the percentage of proteins in common with respect to p <dig> were  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. these are similar to the percentages for ϕe <dig> , ϕ <dig>  and ϕe12- <dig>   <cit> . based on these results, ks <dig>  ks <dig> and kl <dig> can be classified as members of the peduovirinae subfamily and "p2-like viruses" genus  <cit> .

integration site characterization
in e. coli, p <dig> is able to integrate at over  <dig> different loci, but certain sites may be used more commonly than others  <cit> . none of the three p2-like bcc phages characterized here were found to integrate into a locus similar to that of p <dig>  only kl <dig> was found to have a previously characterized integration site. following pcr amplification and sequencing from the b. cenocepacia cep <dig> chromosome , it was determined that, like many phages, kl <dig> integrates into a trna gene. specifically, it integrates into the middle of a threonine trna gene: bp  <dig> of the kl <dig> prophage corresponds to bp  <dig> of the trna based on comparison with a  <dig> bp threonine trna gene of b. cenocepacia hi <dig> chromosome  <dig> . other phages that integrate into threonine trna genes include enterobacteria phage p <dig>  shigella flexneri phage sfv and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium phage st <dig>  <cit> . kl <dig> integration should not affect threonine trna synthesis as bp 1- <dig> of kl <dig> has an identical sequence to bp 32- <dig> of the trna gene.

in both b. multivorans atcc  <dig> and b. cenocepacia c <dig>  ks <dig> integrates into the 3' end of an amp nucleosidase gene. amp nucleosidases convert amp into adenine and ribose 5-phosphate  <cit> . this gene has not been previously identified as a phage integration site. ks <dig> bases 1- <dig>  show similarity to sequences encoding pairs of adjacent amp nucleosidase and integrase genes in several burkholderia genomes. for example, in b. pseudomallei k <dig> chromosome  <dig>  the amp nucleosidase  and integrase  genes are adjacent to genes annotated as encoding a putative phage capsid related protein   and putative phage-related tail protein  . similarly, in b. pseudomallei 1106a chromosome  <dig>  the amp nucleosidase  and integrase  genes are adjacent to genes annotated as encoding a phage portal domain protein  and phage tail completion protein . the identification of phage related genes at this site in other burkholderia genomes suggests that the amp nucleosidase gene may be a conserved integration site among some burkholderia-specific temperate phages.

ks <dig> is different from other p2-like phages in that it does not encode a tyrosine integrase. most temperate phages use a tyrosine recombinase  to facilitate recombination between the phage attp site and the host attb site  <cit> . ks <dig> encodes a serine recombinase , but this protein is unlikely to mediate prophage integration for three reasons. first, gp <dig> is more closely related to invertases such as mu gin  and p <dig> cin  than to integrases such as those from streptomyces lividans phage ϕc <dig>  and mycobacterium smegmatis phage bxb <dig>   <cit> . second, gp <dig> lacks the conserved cysteine-rich and leucine/isoleucine/valine/methionine-rich regions found in other serine integrases  <cit> . third, gp <dig> is only  <dig> aa in length, which is substantially smaller than the serine integrases that are typically between 450- <dig> aa in length  <cit> . we did not believe ks <dig> to be obligately lytic because it encodes a putative repressor protein  and because previously collected ks14-resistant c <dig> isolates were predicted to be lysogenized based on pcr-positivity with ks14-specific primers   <cit> .

phages such as p <dig>  p <dig> and n <dig> of enterobacteria, ϕ <dig> of bacillus anthracis, ϕbb- <dig> of borrelia burgdorferi, le <dig> of leptospira biflexa, pgil <dig> of bacillus thuringiensis and pko <dig> of klebsiella oxytoca lysogenize their hosts as plasmids  <cit> . because ks <dig> gene  <dig> encodes a putative para protein , we predicted that the ks <dig> prophage might exist as a plasmid  <cit> . to test this hypothesis, we used a standard protocol for the qiaprep spin miniprep plasmid isolation kit with cells of c <dig> , atcc  <dig> , cep <dig> , k56- <dig>  and five putatively lysogenized ks14-resistant c <dig> isolates  <cit> . these preparations were then treated with ecori and the resulting fragments were separated using agarose gel electrophoresis. for each of the four control strains, no distinct bands were observed . in contrast, preparations from each of the five putatively lysogenized strains contained identical distinct bands . furthermore, these bands were the same size as those predicted and observed for an ecori digest of ks <dig> dna   and sequences from selected bands matched the ks <dig> genome sequence. based on these results, we predict that ks <dig> is a temperate phage that, in contrast to other p2-like phages, lysogenizes host strains as a plasmid.

it is important to note that, although one of these phages has been shown to be active in vivo, temperate phages are generally considered to be suboptimal for use in a phage therapy protocol  <cit> . in contrast to obligately lytic phages, temperate phages are associated with superinfection immunity, lysogenic conversion and specialized transduction   <cit> . in a previous study, we have shown that temperate bcc-specific phages can be engineered to their lytic form by inactivating the repressor gene  <cit> . this strategy could potentially be used with the three phages described here, thus making them more appropriate candidates for clinical use.

morphogenesis genes
as discussed above, the ks <dig>  ks <dig> and kl <dig> structural genes are related to those from p <dig> and function to construct a p2-like myovirus with a contractile tail. the only virion morphogenesis genes of p <dig> that these phages lack are g  and h  . because the tail fibers are involved in host recognition, it is expected that these proteins would be dissimilar in phages infecting e. coli and those infecting the bcc.

a commonly identified characteristic in tailed phages is the expression of two tail proteins from a single start codon via a translational frameshift  <cit> . these proteins  share the same n-terminus but have different c-termini due to stop codon readthrough in the - <dig> frame  <cit> . in p <dig>  this - <dig> frameshift occurs at a ttttttg sequence and produces the  <dig> aa protein e and the  <dig> aa protein e+e' from the same translational start site   <cit> . ks <dig>  ks <dig> and kl <dig> all encode proteins similar to both e and e+e' with percent identities ranging from 49-59% . despite the relatively low degree of similarity, the p <dig> frameshift site appears to be conserved amongst these phages, suggesting that they likely use a similar frameshifting mechanism . in rare cases, rna secondary structure can be identified downstream of the phage frameshift sequence  <cit> . when the ks <dig>  ks <dig> and kl <dig> e+e' sequences  <dig> bp downstream of the ttttttg sequence were screened for secondary structure, no predicted hairpins were identified . this result was anticipated based upon the absence of these structures in the p <dig> phage e+e' gene  <cit> .

lysis genes
in p <dig>  the lysis module consists of five genes: y , k , lysa , lysb  and lysc   <cit> . the p2-like bcc phages are predicted to encode endolysins, holins and antiholins that are dissimilar to those of p <dig> . ks <dig> gp <dig>  ks <dig> gp <dig> and kl <dig> gp <dig> are putative endolysins as they all have the conserved domain pfam <dig>  and show similarity to other phage endolysins. p <dig> y is a type i holin with three transmembrane domains  <cit> . although ks <dig>  <dig>  ks <dig>  <dig> and kl <dig>  <dig> are dissimilar to p <dig> y, it is predicted that these three genes encode holins because they are each immediately upstream of a putative endolysin gene and they each encode proteins that a) have three transmembrane domains based on octopus analysis and b) show similarity to other phage holins.

antiholins such as p <dig> lysa inhibit holin activity and delay lysis of infected cells in order to optimize the phage burst size  <cit> . although some phages such as λ express antiholins from a second translational start site two codons upstream of the holin start codon, phages such as p <dig> and ϕo <dig> of streptococcus thermophilus encode an antiholin from a separate gene  <cit> . the location of the putative antiholin genes ks <dig>  <dig>  ks <dig>  <dig> and kl <dig>  <dig> is similar to that in ϕo <dig>  in which the holin and antiholin genes are adjacent immediately upstream of the endolysin gene   <cit> . based on octopus analysis, ks <dig> gp <dig> has three transmembrane domains, while ks <dig> gp <dig>  kl <dig> gp <dig> and p <dig> lysa have four. based on gene organization and protein transmembrane structure, it is predicted that the p2-like bcc phages have separate antiholin genes in their lysis modules.

p <dig> encodes two proteins, lysb and lysc, that are predicted to function similarly to λ rz and rz <dig>  <cit> . rz is an inner membrane protein with an n-terminal transmembrane domain and rz <dig> is a proline-rich outer membrane lipoprotein  <cit> . rz/rz <dig> pairs fuse the inner and outer membranes following holin and endolysin activity and facilitate phage release  <cit> . the p <dig> lysc start codon is in the + <dig> frame within the lysb gene, while the lysc stop codon is out of frame in the downstream tail gene r  <cit> . in contrast, the rz <dig> gene in λ is entirely contained within the rz gene  <cit> . ks <dig> and kl <dig> lysbc pairs  are similar to that of p <dig> . in ks <dig> and kl <dig>  the lysc genes start approximately  <dig> bp upstream from the lysb stop codon and extend into the first  <dig> bp of r  . both ks <dig> and kl <dig> lysc proteins are predicted to have a signal peptidase ii cleavage site between positions  <dig>  and  <dig> . signal peptidase ii cleavage would produce a  <dig> aa lipoprotein with  <dig> prolines  for ks <dig> lysc and a  <dig> amino acid lipoprotein with  <dig> prolines  for kl <dig> lysc.

in contrast to the p2-like lysbc gene organization found in ks <dig> and kl <dig>  the ks <dig> genes 32/ <dig> have a similar organization to λ rz/rz <dig>  ks <dig> rz <dig> is encoded in the + <dig> frame within the rz gene . it is predicted to have a signal peptidase ii cleavage site between positions  <dig>  and  <dig> , which would produce a  <dig> amino acid lipoprotein with  <dig> prolines . the differences in both gene organization and proline content between the p2-like ks <dig> and kl <dig> lysc proteins and the λ-like ks <dig> rz <dig> protein suggest that ks <dig> may have acquired genes  <dig> and  <dig> - and potentially the entire lysis module - through horizontal transfer from a phage similar to λ.

sequence elements unique to ks <dig> and/or kl3
insertion sequences
insertion sequences  are short genetic elements that can insert into nonhomologous regions of dna  <cit> . these elements, comprised of a transposase gene and inverted repeats, create flanking direct repeats following insertion  <cit> . many mutants of well-characterized phages have been found to carry iss, including λ and mu  <cit> . however, it is relatively rare for wildtype phages to carry iss because they can interfere with gene expression  <cit> . sakaguchi et al. determined the genome sequence of the clostridium botulinum phage c-st and determined that it carries  <dig> iss   <cit> . of the  <dig> genomes sequenced at the time, one is was found in each of eight phages: burkholderia phages ϕe <dig> and bcep <dig>  enterobacteria phages p <dig> and hk <dig>  lactobacillus phages ϕat <dig> and lp <dig>  rhodothermus phage rm <dig> and shigella phage sf <dig>  <cit> .

a novel insertion sequence  is found in the ks <dig> genome between gene  <dig>  encoding a membrane protein and gene  <dig>  encoding the tail protein d . this is does not appear to disrupt any putative orfs and so may not have any significant effect on phage gene expression. isbmu <dig> is  <dig> bp in length and contains two imperfect  <dig> bp inverted repeats . in ks <dig>  it is flanked by two copies of a  <dig> bp direct repeat, cctaa. isbmu <dig> encodes a  <dig> aa transposase that has the conserved domain cog <dig> . this protein is most similar to the transposase of isbmu <dig> , an is5-like is present in nine copies in atcc  <dig>  <cit> . isbmu <dig> and isbmu <dig> are very similar as they a) are present in the same genome, b) are both  <dig> bp in length, c) encode similar  <dig> aa transposases, d) have similar  <dig> bp inverted repeats  and e) preferentially integrate into ctaa sequences . ohtsubo et al. found that the transposition of iss in atcc  <dig> increased when the cells were grown at high temperatures  <cit> . because these temperatures are similar to what the cell may encounter during infection of an animal or human, it is suggested that this change may provide a selective advantage to atcc  <dig> by modifying its genome under in vivo conditions  <cit> . further experiments are required to determine if isbmu <dig> transposition is affected by temperature and if this is may provide a selective advantage to ks <dig> lysogens in vivo.

reverse transcriptases
reverse transcriptases  are rna-dependent dna polymerases most commonly associated with retroviruses and retrotransposons  <cit> . rts have also been identified in several phage genomes, including those of p2-like phages  <cit> . one function of these proteins was extensively characterized in bordetella bronchiseptica phage bpp- <dig>  this phage has the ability to change its host range by making amino acid substitutions in its tail fiber protein, mtd   <cit> . this switch requires the phage-encoded rt brt  that synthesizes a dna copy of a  <dig> bp locus  that has 90% identity with a  <dig> bp region of the mtd gene   <cit> . adenines in the reverse transcribed copy of tr are mutagenized and the altered dna integrates or recombines at vr by an unknown mechanism, generating a tail fiber gene with multiple base substitutions  <cit> .

a second function associated with phage rts is phage exclusion. in lactococcus lactis, expression of the putative rt abik lowers the efficiency of plating of infecting phages by an unknown mechanism   <cit> . expression of orf <dig>  an rt identified in the p2-like enterobacteria prophage p2-ec <dig>  was found to inhibit t <dig> infection of e. coli  <cit> . when a region of orf <dig> containing an rt conserved motif was deleted, t <dig> infection was no longer inhibited  <cit> .

ks <dig> encodes a putative rt, gp <dig>  this protein has the conserved domain cd <dig> . it is unlikely that gp <dig> and brt have the same function: the two proteins show minimal similarity , gene  <dig> is located distal to the tail fiber gene , neither nucleotide substitutions in the tail fiber gene nor variations in ks <dig> tropism were observed and no repeated sequences were identified in the ks <dig> genome longer than  <dig> bp  <cit> . when compared to orf <dig>  gp <dig> shows almost no relatedness  but is found at the same locus . further experiments are required to determine if the ks <dig> rt is involved in tropism modification, phage exclusion or some uncharacterized function.

dna methylation, restriction and repair
dna methylase and endonuclease genes are commonly found in phage genomes. methylases modify the dna such that it becomes resistant to bacterial restriction systems  <cit> . although p <dig> does not encode any putative methylases, such proteins are encoded by both ks <dig> and kl <dig>  . all three methylases are predicted to belong to the adomet_mtase superfamily . ks <dig> gp <dig> is most similar to a dna methylase n-4/n- <dig> domain protein of b. ambifaria mex- <dig> . kl <dig> gp <dig> is most similar to a site-specific dna methyltransferase of b. pseudomallei k <dig> . both of these proteins have the conserved domain pfam <dig> . because this domain is associated with both n- <dig> cytosine and n- <dig> adenine methylases, these proteins may have either cytosine or adenine methylase activity  <cit> . kl <dig> gp <dig> shows similarity to a modification methylase ecorii from several bacterial species, with e-values as low as 4e- <dig>  this protein has the conserved domain cd <dig>  and so can be classified as a cytosine-c <dig> methylase. ks <dig> gp <dig> and kl <dig> gp <dig> are likely involved in protecting the phage dna from bcc restriction systems. as discussed below, the function of kl <dig> gp <dig> is likely to protect the phage dna from a phage-encoded restriction enzyme.

phage nucleases have a number of functions, including degradation of the bacterial dna , phage exclusion and dna processing  <cit> . kl <dig> encodes two endonucleases, gp <dig> and gp <dig>  gp <dig> is most similar to a type ii restriction endonuclease, ecorii-c domain protein of candidatus hamiltonella defensa 5at  . this protein has the conserved domain pfam <dig> . gp <dig> is most similar to a dna mismatch endonuclease vsr of burkholderia graminis c4d1m . this protein has the conserved domain cd <dig> .

the organization of genes 45- <dig>  in a single module suggests that the proteins that they encode are functionally related. the ecorii-c endonuclease  is likely to degrade either bacterial dna to inhibit the host during the kl <dig> lytic cycle or superinfecting phage dna  <cit> . kl <dig> dna would be protected from this cleavage by ecorii methylation at the second position in the ecorii-c recognition sequence   <cit> . expression of the dcm methylase, which has an identical recognition sequence and methylation site as ecorii methylase, is mutagenic in e. coli because 5-methylcytosines are deaminated to thymines, causing t/g mismatches  <cit> . ecorii methylase expression would presumably cause mismatched sites in kl <dig> with the sequence cwgg. in e. coli, these mismatches are repaired by very short patch  repair which starts with the recognition and nicking of the sequence cwgg by a vsr endonuclease  <cit> . as kl <dig> expresses a vsr endonuclease, it could repair post-methylation t/g mismatches using the same mechanism.

the proposed model for methylase and endonuclease interaction during the kl <dig> lytic cycle is as follows. unmethylated host dna  is degraded by gp <dig>  kl <dig> dna is protected from gp <dig> degradation by gp47-mediated conversion of cytosine to 5-methylcytosine. these 5-methylcytosine bases are deaminated to thymine, but the resulting t/g mismatches are cleaved by gp <dig> and fixed using vsp repair. although further experiments are required to test the validity of this model, kl <dig> appears to encode an elegant system for degradation of bacterial or superinfecting phage dna, protection of the phage genome and repair of resulting mutations.

CONCLUSIONS
this study is the first to identify and characterize p2-like phages of the bcc. like other previously characterized p2-like burkholderia phages, ks <dig>  ks <dig> and kl <dig> share structural genes with p <dig> but encode dissimilar accessory proteins. ks <dig>  a  <dig> bp prophage of b. multivorans atcc  <dig>  integrates into an amp nucleosidase gene, has a λ-like rz/rz <dig> cassette, carries an isbmu2-like insertion sequence and encodes a reverse transcriptase. ks <dig>  a  <dig> bp phage previously shown to be active against b. cenocepacia in vivo, encodes a serine recombinase but is maintained as a plasmid prophage  <cit> . kl <dig>  a  <dig> bp prophage of b. cenocepacia cep <dig>  integrates into a threonine trna gene and encodes a series of proteins capable of degrading bacterial or superinfecting phage dna, methylating the phage genome and repairing methylation-induced mismatches. as ks <dig> has already been shown to be active in vivo, characterization of these three related phages is an important preliminary step in the development of a phage therapy protocol for the bcc.
