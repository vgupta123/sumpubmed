BACKGROUND
the ribosomal protein sa , previously named 37-kda laminin receptor precursor/67-kda laminin receptor  is a multifunctional protein. in the nucleus it binds to dna via the histones h2a, h2b and h <dig>  <cit> , in the cytoplasm it is associated with the 40s ribosomal subunit  <cit> , and at the cell surface it acts as a receptor for a number of components i.e. laminin, elastin, the green tea catechin epigallocatechin-3-gallate , carbohydrates, the prion protein, different viruses like dengue virus, sindbis virus, venezuelean equine encephalitis virus and adeno-associated-viruses and various bacteria like streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis and haemophilus influenza  <cit> .

the receptor is involved in many pathological processes. it is upregulated in cancer and its expression is positively correlated with metastasis and the aggressiveness of tumour cells in breast, ovary, lung, prostate and cervical carcinomas  <cit> . in the context of prion disease, rpsa is needed for the internalization and propagation of prion proteins  <cit> . several therapeutic approaches based on down-regulation  and/or blocking  of the receptor result in reduced adhesion, migration and invasion of tumour cells  <cit> , and reduced accumulation of the pathogenic isoform of the prion protein in many organs involved in the pathogenesis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies  <cit> , leading to a significant prolongation of the pre-clinical phase or survival time after the occurrence of the first symptoms  <cit> .

in addition, it has been shown that binding of green tea catechin egcg to rpsa causes anti-thrombotic, anti-allergic and anti-obesity effects and mediates cancer prevention by inhibiting cell growth  <cit> , thus rpsa is a target in new therapies against this large group of diseases.

however, in order to unravel the multiple pathways in which rpsa is involved and to develop rpsa-based diagnostic/therapeutic tools, it is necessary first to characterize in full detail the complex genetic background of rpsa. indeed, previous studies have shown that in most investigated species thus far, rpsa is a member of a multicopy gene family consisting of one full length functional gene and several pseudogenes . moreover, the presence of pseudogenes in a genome can interfere with molecular studies of the corresponding functional gene  and transcribed pseudogenes can produce endogenous small interfering rnas that regulate the expression of the functional gene or other genes  <cit> .

 in silico genome-wide screening studies in species with fully sequenced genomes.  in vitro studies screening genomic or cdna library,  in silico genome-wide screening study carried out in this paper.

previously, marcos-carcavilla et al.  <cit>  have postulated the existence of an ovine rpsa pseudogene. the present work aims at providing a genetic basis for future studies on rpsa related pathways/pathologies in sheep by identifying and characterizing the complex rpsa gene family.

RESULTS
bac screening and sts content mapping
eight different primer pairs were designed in conserved ovine rpsa regions identified by aligning previously described mrna and expressed sequence tag  sequences, representing each exon at least once. using these primers,  <dig> bacterial artificial chromosome  clones, containing members of the rpsa family, were isolated by pcr screening of the inra sheep bac library  <cit> , with an annealing temperature  that was at least 8°c lower than the melting temperature  of the primers to allow primer mismatches . by sequence tagged site  content mapping, performed with  <dig> unique sts primer pairs that were designed from the  <dig> bac end sequences  ,  <dig> mini-contigs could be constructed and another  <dig> single bac clones could be identified, each containing a different family member of the ovine rpsa family .

characterization of the  <dig> rpsa gene family members
each member of the rpsa gene family was sequenced by direct sequencing on bac dna starting with the pcr primers as sequencing primers and finishing by primer walking. the sequences were assembled with the cap <dig> program  <cit>  and annotated with blast  <cit> .

the full length functional gene, that was first described by marcos-carcavilla et al.  <cit> , was present in one of the contigs composed of  <dig> bac clones . we have sequenced for the first time, the complete intron  <dig>  comprising  <dig> bp, which like the other introns, has consensus acceptor and donor splice sites. the full length ovine rpsa gene consist thus of  <dig> bp.

besides the full length functional gene,  <dig> other rpsa gene family members were sequenced . a schematic representation of all the family members, based on sequence alignments with the full length functional gene , is included in figure  <dig>  they all are considered as processed pseudogenes and in accordance with rpsa pseudogenes described in other species, they have been assigned the names rpsap1-rpsap <dig>  pseudogenes arise in  <dig> different manners: either by retrotransposition of the mrna of the ancestral gene into the genome or by duplication of genomic dna  <cit> . the first class is known as processed pseudogenes, the second one as non processed pseudogenes. the majority of the pseudogenes are processed and originate from housekeeping genes, with ribosomal protein genes as largest subgroup  <cit> . as processed pseudogenes are inserted without internal promoter, they are released from selection pressure and accumulate mutations during evolution leading to frameshift mutations and/or premature stopcodons which prevents them of encoding a functional protein  <cit> . in some cases nevertheless, they have obtained a  function  <cit> .

to investigate this possibility, all the rpsa pseudogenes were further characterized in silico and their main characteristics are listed in detail in table  <dig> and  <dig>  comparison with the full length rpsa gene transcript shows that the pseudogenes vary greatly both in structure and sequence identity. these differences range from structurally identical pseudogenes sharing 99% sequence identity  to pseudogenes lacking half of the gene  or containing many deletions throughout the whole gene sharing a sequence identity of only 74% .

analysis of the primer binding sites in the pseudogenes showed that in our experimental design the screening primers could anneal to targets down to 83% sequence identity, even in the case of rpsap <dig> 

all bac clones and thus all rpsa family members were isolated with at least  <dig> primer pairs and there was no concordance between the number of bacs in a mini-contig and the level of sequence identity with rpsa. we conclude that it is most likely that we have isolated all the ovine rpsa pseudogenes sharing a high level of sequence identity and that therefore can interfere with the functional rpsa gene in genetic studies.

to obtain a first indication of possible functionality, in silico orf and promoter prediction analysis were carried out.

the pseudogene rpsap <dig> is the only member sharing almost an identical orf with the full length rpsa gene. the only one amino acid difference  is located in the intracellular part of the receptor that does not belong to any binding site. all the other pseudogenes either lack the start codon or contain a premature stop codon due to nonsense or frameshift mutations. the size of the potential orf of the other pseudogenes varies and the largest reaches  <dig> amino acids sharing 100% identity with rpsa . most orfs lie in the intracellular region of rpsa . in case of rpsap <dig>  rpsap <dig>  rpsap <dig> and rpsap <dig>  the orf contains a part of the binding sites of rpsa with prp , but most of them have a low level of amino acid identity.

in silico promoter analysis predicted a possible promoter for rpsap <dig>  rpsap <dig>  rpsap <dig>  rpsap <dig>  rpsap <dig> and rpsap <dig> . a consensus polyadenylation signal is present in  <dig> of the  <dig> pseudogenes .

repeated sequences were identified with repeatmasker  <cit>  and showed that  <dig> pseudogenes are disrupted by interspersed repeats belonging to the class/family sine/rte-bovb, sine/bova, trna and sine/trna-glu, and that  <dig> pseudogenes were flanked by repeats belonging to the sine, line, trna, ltr and simple repeat classes. according to zhang et al.  <cit> , processed pseudogenes are mostly found in genomic regions with a relatively low gc content, as do line repeats. thus, it is not surprising that such repeats are present in the regions flanking many of the rpsa pseudogenes.

a remarkable observation is that part of the rpsa intron  <dig>  containing the small nucleolar rna  snora <dig>  is present in the rpsap <dig> and rpsap <dig> pseudogenes. therefore, these pseudogenes can be considered as semi-processed pseudogenes, which are very rarely reported and defined by zhang et al. as "pseudogenes that contain remnant introns, which suggests that they were derived from semi-processed rna transcripts"  <cit> .

snornas are encoded in introns of ribosomal protein genes and other housekeeping genes  <cit> , and are responsible for both sequence-specific methylation and pseudouridilation of rna  <cit> . snora <dig> isan h/aca box snorna that guides the isomerization of uridine into pseudouridine  <cit>  by binding with  <dig> uridines of 28s rrna . sequence comparison shows that these important regions display mutations in rpsap <dig> but are conserved in rpsap <dig> . as a result, the paralog of snora <dig> is probably not functional in rpsap <dig>  in rpsap <dig> on the other hand, the paralog of snora <dig> could, in addition to snora <dig>  exhibit the function of pseudouridilation in case of transcription  <cit> . marcos-carcavilla et al.  <cit>  had already postulated the existence of a non-processed pseudogene that differed from the active rpsa gene by the absence of a g at position  <dig> of intron  <dig>  thus, we hypothesize that this previously mentioned non-processed pseudogene is in fact the semi-processed pseudogene rpsap <dig>  because it lacks the g at position  <dig> of intron  <dig> and it can co-amplify with the active rpsa gene because of its high sequence identity .

annotation of the mini-contigs by comparative mapping and fish localization
the genomic regions containing the  <dig> members of the rpsa gene family were further investigated by sequence comparison of both bes and internal bac sequences using ncbi blast  <cit>  . sixty-two of the  <dig> bes were annotated while the remaining  <dig> contained either too many repeat sequences or no specific orthologous sequence to allow annotation. the different characteristics  are listed in the additional file  <dig>  based on sequence annotation results,  <dig> ovine genes, of which  <dig> have not been described in sheep yet, could be mapped on the mini-contigs by comparative mapping with the bovine genome . the primers used to perform the pcr for annotating the genes, together with another  <dig> optimized primer pairs, amplifying genes not present in the mini-contig but flanking the genomic region of the different rpsa family members, are listed in additional file  <dig> 

the  <dig> pseudogenes were localized by fish on different sheep chromosomes . all the localizations confirmed the positions predicted from the genes present in the mini-contigs by using the online tool virtual sheep genome assembly v <dig> .

as expected, most rpsa pseudogenes are located in intergenic regions except  <dig> found in the intron of other genes , which confirms the fact that most processed pseudogenes persist in regions where they do not cause deleterious effects  <cit> .

the genomic region around the ovine rpsa family members show conserved synteny  with the bovine genome. loc <dig>  probably a processed pseudogene of golph3l located in intron  <dig> of gon4l on bos taurus chromosome   <dig> and expected in the ovine mini-contig containing rpsap <dig>  was the only bovine ortholog not present in sheep and therefore is most probably a bovine specific pseudogene.

the flanking sequences  of each rpsa pseudogene were blasted against the bovine and human genome. out of the  <dig> identified orthologous bovine sequences,  <dig> were interrupted by a bovine rpsa pseudogene; in the  <dig> other cases, the upstream sequence continued into the downstream sequence without an interruption of a pseudogene. the latter was also the case with the  <dig> orthologous human sequences. thus we found  <dig> orthologous bovine rpsa pseudogenes but no human orthologs .

a blast analysis of the bovine genome  with both ovine and bovine rpsa and rpsa pseudogene sequences identified  <dig> potential rpsa family members . these included the only bovine pseudogene described so far, designated as rpsap <dig> and located on bta <dig>  <cit> . no ortholog of this pseudogene was found in sheep. twenty-five sequences were annotated as 'similar to ribosomal protein sa pseudogene' but only one corresponded to an ovine ortholog i.e. rpsap <dig>  to date, the  <dig> remaining sequences have not been annotated, but we have identified an ovine ortholog in  <dig> cases . apart from rpsap <dig>  the orf of the ovine and bovine orthologs differ substantially, suggesting that there is no selective pressure to conserve the orf of these pseudogenes.

no bovine ortholog was found for the  <dig> sheep rpsa pseudogenes sharing  <dig> to 99% nucleotide identity with rpsa whereas the  <dig>  for which a bovine ortholog was identified, only displayed 74-83% sequence identity with rpsa. as the amount of mutations accumulated by the pseudogenes during evolution can be used to infer their age  <cit> , it's not surprising that the first group, consisting of recently arisen pseudogenes which have not yet accumulated many mutations, is lineage specific and that the pseudogenes of the latter group, comprising the oldest pseudogenes, all have a bovine ortholog. in addition, none of the  <dig> ovine pseudogenes were orthologous with any of the  <dig> annotated human rpsa pseudogenes. as a result, we can conclude that all  <dig> ovine rpsa pseudogenes detected originated after the divergence between primates and ungulates and  <dig> of these after the divergence between cattle and sheep.

transcription profiling by rt-pcr
to investigate whether some of the ovine rpsa pseudogenes were potentially functional, transcription profiling was performed by rt-pcr for all sheep rpsa family members in  <dig> tissues  i.e. cerebrum, cerebellum, spleen, muscle, lymph node, duodenum and blood. to be sure that no genomic dna was present in the rna samples, they were treated with dnase and checked by minus rt control pcr . for  <dig> members of the rpsa family, gene-specific primers could be designed and their specificity was proven by checking that the primers did not amplify any other rpsa family member using the respective unique bac clones as template . because rpsa, rpsap <dig>  rpsap <dig> and rpsap <dig> share a high level of sequence identity, no specific primers could be designed for these rpsa family members, they were tested with aspecific primers. all generated amplicons were sequenced. rpsa was expressed in all tested tissues. this agrees with the results of marcos-carcavilla et al. and qiao et al.  <cit> . none of the pseudogenes was transcribed in blood. rpsap <dig> and rpsap <dig> were transcribed in all other tested tissues, while rpsap <dig>  rpsap <dig> and rpsap <dig> were only transcribed in one or more brain regions and rpsap <dig> was transcribed in brain regions and spleen. rpsap <dig> and rpsap <dig> were not expressed in any of the tested tissues. in the case of rpsap <dig>  rpsap <dig> and rpsap <dig>  tested with aspecific primers which all could also amplify rpsa, we generated amplicons which, after sequencing, turned out to be all rpsa transcripts. thus we can conclude that rpsap <dig>  rpsap <dig> and rpsap <dig> are not expressed or at a very low level compared to the active rpsa gene. therefore it would be interesting to do rt-qpcr with specific probes in order to be sure if the pseudogenes are expressed at very low levels or not at all. no clear relationship between the transcription profile of the various pseudogenes and the in silico prediction of possible promoters was observed. for instance, rpsap <dig> is not expressed in any tissue tested although we did predict a promoter in the upstream sequence. thus it may be possible that rpsap <dig> is expressed in other tissues not examined in this study or that it has a low level of transcription. in addition, the in silico predicted promoter might not act as a cis-regulatory element in vivo. in contrast, rpsap <dig> is transcribed in certain brain regions although we did not predict any promoter, probably because the promoter is located more upstream than the region analyzed here.

CONCLUSIONS
in addition to the already described ovine rpsa gene, we have identified  <dig> members of the ovine rpsa gene family, and designated them rpsap1-rpsap <dig> since they are all considered to be processed pseudogenes. the flanking genomic regions of each rpsa family member was analyzed by annotating the constructed bac contigs, which revealed  <dig> genes  based on comparative mapping. all these regions show conserved synteny with the orthologous bovine counterparts and the locations were confirmed by fish. five pseudogenes have a bovine counterpart. in silico analysis predicted the presence of  <dig> more rpsa pseudogenes in the bovine genome.

compared to the rpsa transcript, rpsa pseudogenes differ significantly both in structure and sequence identity, ranging from structurally identical pseudogenes sharing 99% sequence identity to pseudogenes lacking half of the gene or containing many deletions throughout the whole gene, sharing only 74% sequence identity. a remarkable result is that at least  <dig> of the  <dig> pseudogenes are transcriptionally active. however, whether these transcripts are functional as regulatory non-coding rna or as functional proteins remains to be investigated.

in previous studies,  <dig> to  <dig> rpsa pseudogenes per species, discovered while screening with the intention to isolate the full length functional rpsa gene, were characterized. furthermore, the number of rpsa pseudogenes in  <dig> species with fully sequenced genomes was determined by genome-wide in silico screening but those pseudogenes were not characterized . here we report in detail the characterization of the rpsa gene family in a species. a strategy was developed to isolate all the ovine rpsa pseudogenes sharing a high level of sequence identity with rpsa. we screened with  <dig> different primers representing each exon at least once and with a ta that was at least 8°c lower than the tm. all bac clones were positive for at least  <dig> primer pairs and there was no concordance between the number of bac in a mini-contig and the level of sequence identity with rpsa. therefore, we conclude that it is most likely that we have isolated all the ovine rpsa pseudogenes that could interfere with the functional rpsa gene in genetic studies. the discrepancy between the numbers of ovine rpsa pseudogenes found  and the numbers described in genome-wide screenings  might be explained by the low sequence identity of most pseudogenes found in silico. in bos taurus for instance,  <dig> of the  <dig> pseudogenes share an overall nucleic acid identity with the bovine rpsa gene beneath 80% . due to our experimental design, pseudogenes with a low sequence identity were not isolated since it is not likely that those pseudogenes would interfere with molecular studies on the functional full length rpsa gene.

in conclusion, we describe  <dig> ovine processed rpsa pseudogenes. this knowledge on their structure and sequence will facilitate the molecular genetic studies of the functional gene since it will now be possible to take into account the existence of the pseudogenes in the design of such studies.
