BACKGROUND
the debate on genetically modified  crop plants has been focused on two main uncertainties: 1) whether a gm plant differs from its non-gm progenitors only in the introduced trait of interest, 2) whether a gm plant is safe in the environment with respect to gene flow and seed dispersal. to address these questions, we have chosen parthenocarpy, the development of the fruit in absence of fertilization, to evaluate the equivalence of gm and non-gm fruit and to evaluate the advantages of parthenocarpy produced by genetic engineering compared to traditional methods. in this work, we present an analysis of parthenocarpic tomato fruit obtained from field-grown gm plants to address some aspects of the equivalence of gm fruit.

the trait of parthenocarpy is particularly important for crop plants whose commercial product is their fruit  <cit> . during flowering, adverse environmental conditions may either prevent or reduce pollination and fertilization decreasing fruit yield and quality. moreover, parthenocarpic fruits are seedless, and seedlessness is highly valued by consumers in some fruit .

parthenocarpic fruits have been produced by traditional breeding methods based either on mutant lines or other strategies such as alteration of the ploidy level as in banana and watermelon  <cit> . however, genetic parthenocarpy has been used only for a limited number of species and varieties. in some species and varieties, seedless fruit production is often achieved by external application of plant growth regulators as in the case of grape, tomato and eggplant  <cit> .

several methods to genetically engineer parthenocarpic fruit development have been proposed, and some have also been tested experimentally in crop plants  <cit> . thus, transgenic parthenocarpic plants have been obtained for horticultural crops  <cit> . in particular, the chimeric gene defh9-iaam has been used to drive parthenocarpic fruit development in several species belonging to different plant families  <cit> . the defh9-iaam transgene promotes the synthesis of auxin  specifically in the placenta, ovules and tissues derived therefrom  <cit> . the agronomical advantages of defh9-iaam gm plants have been assessed by greenhouse and field trials of defh9-iaam eggplant  <cit> , strawberry and raspberry  <cit> .

the defh9-ri-iaam gene construct produces high quality parthenocarpic fruits in the tomato cultivar uc  <dig>  a variety used by the processing industry. the defh9-iaam gene construct gave rise to malformed parthenocarpic fruits because of high sensitivity to auxin that is present in the uc  <dig> genetic background  <cit> . the defh9-ri-iaam gene version is less efficiently translated and has a weaker action in producing iaa than defh9-iaam, so its use avoids the malformation of the fruit.

parthenocarpy represents a useful trait in tomato fruit used for industrial purpose as well. this because parthenocarpic fruits are usually either seedless or contain significantly fewer seeds than non-parthenocarpic varieties. manipulation of fruit and seed quality, size and number has been recently included among the third-generation traits of gm crop plants  <cit> . in the tomato sauce industry, seed content is a problem and seeds are removed to obtain sauce of good quality. as far as fruit quality concerns, parthenocarpy may also improve fruit quality through increases in the solid soluble content of the fruit  <cit> . productivity may also be increased in some seasons because fruit set and fruit growth are less affected under environmental conditions adverse for pollination and/or fertilization including heavy rain, high humidity, hot and dry wind etc.

processing tomatoes represent the greatest proportion of tomato production . in this paper, data on agronomic performance under open field conditions, technological and biochemical characteristics of two defh9-ri-iaam uc  <dig> tomato lines are presented and compared to untransformed control. we also included in our analysis a modern f <dig> hybrid tomato, used by the processing industry, to determine the extent to which biochemical and agronomical parameters vary between different non-gm tomato lines. the data indicate that the use in the diet of fruits from a new line or variety introduces much greater changes than the consumption of gm fruits in comparison to its genetic background.

RESULTS
the field trial was performed in  <dig>  the mean air temperature from the first week of june until the end of the growing season was unusually very high and constantly above 25°c and 30°c average and maximum temperature, respectively .

fruit production, as measured by marketable fruit yield, was highest in the modern f <dig> tomato hybrid allflesh . the transgenic parthenocarpic lines ri <dig> and ri <dig> gave a fruit yield similar to that of the untransformed control uc  <dig>  however, one transgenic parthenocarpic line  gave a marketable fruit production that was not statistically different from all the other three genotypes .

the two parthenocarpic lines produced a higher number of fruits with respect to the untransformed control uc  <dig> . the increased fruit number per plant was most likely due to an improved fruit set of gm parthenocarpic plants compared to the untransformed control . the two parthenocarpic lines produced fruits of smaller size . the reduction of fruit weight observed in the two parthenocarpic lines is most likely due to the increased number of fruits per parthenocarpic plant. the hybrid allflesh gave a number of fruits that was not different from the numbers of both transgenic lines and of the cultivar uc  <dig> 

the unmarketable yield, represented by green and rotten fruits, was not different between the four genotypes .

the shape of the tomatoes, the puffiness fruit index and the number of locules per fruit did not differ between the genotypes tested . the two transgenic lines ri <dig> and ri <dig> produced a significantly lower percentage of seeded fruit and a significantly reduced number of seeds per fruit compared to the untransformed control and the modern f <dig> hybrid allflesh . this shows that the fruits obtained from the transgenic lines were parthenocarpic.

colour evaluation of fruits showed that l* values  did not vary among uc  <dig> genotypes. a significant higher a* values, representing the red component, was found in non-transformed fruits compared to that of the transgenic fruits . the b* value  was different from the uc  <dig> control only in ri <dig> gm line. °brix values showed a significant higher soluble sugar content in allflesh tomatoes . the °brix value of ri <dig>  did not differ from uc  <dig> , while the °brix value  of ri <dig> was higher than uc  <dig>  however, the °brix values of the two transgenic lines were not significantly different. the ph values were close to  <dig>  in both the cultivar uc  <dig> and in the transgenic lines derived from it. allflesh had a slightly higher ph statistically different from all the other genotypes tested . total acidity values showed no significant variation between the genotypes analyzed. the resistance of skin  was about  <dig>  kg for all samples. dry matter content was significantly higher in allflesh with respect to all three uc  <dig> genotypes tested .

analysis of the citric, tartaric and oxalic acid amounts showed that citric acid was the most abundant . citric acid content was significantly higher in allflesh compared to cv. uc  <dig>  the two lines ri <dig> and ri <dig> had intermediate amounts not significantly different from each other, although ri <dig> had a higher content than uc  <dig>  tartaric acid content did not show any significant difference between the tomatoes produced by the four genotypes tested. oxalic acid content differed only in transgenic line ri <dig>  β-carotene content was significantly higher in the tomatoes of the two transgenic parthenocarpic lines, followed by uc  <dig> and allflesh. vitamin c, lycopene and tomatine did not show any significant difference between the four genotypes tested.

the total antioxidant capacity was rather similar in all four genotypes with allflesh having the highest value which differed significantly only from that of ri <dig> line . the difference in the total antioxidant activity was attributable to the hydrophilic phase. in fact, hydrophilic and total teac were similar both as values and as trend, whereas the antioxidant activity of the lipophilic matrix showed no significant difference between the four genotypes tested and with values so low that they barely contribute to the overall antioxidant capacity. the content of total polyphenols was not significantly different.

in conclusion, tomatoes  genetically modified for parthenocarpy, grown under open field conditions, show a fruit yield per plant identical to their corresponding control but a 10-fold reduction in the seeds content. all other tested parameters, with the exception of β-carotene, did not show relevant changes between gm and not gm uc  <dig> tomatoes.

discussion
the open field trial of two transgenic tomato lines obtained from the processing cultivar uc  <dig> showed that the defh9-ri-iaam gene was able to induce parthenocarpic fruit development under open field cultivation conditions. most  of the fruits produced were seedless and, furthermore, seeded fruits contained significantly less amount of seed  than both the corresponding untransformed uc  <dig> control and the modern cultivar f <dig> allflesh . these results are in accordance with those from field trial of eggplant where most of the transgenic fruits were seedless  <cit>  and confirmed that iaam-induced parthenocarpy might be used as a tool to reduce transgenic seed dispersal without the need to combine it with male sterility. the significantly fewer number of seeds in defh9-ri-iaam tomato  fruits may represent a desirable trait for processing tomatoes because the absence of seeds simplifies industrial activities which normally discard the seeds from the paste.

under the rather high temperature that occurred during flowering, fruit set and growth, the defh9-ri-iaam parthenocarpic transgene allowed the production of a significantly larger number of fruits compared to the untransformed cv. uc  <dig>  this indicates, at least under the conditions tested, an improved ability of the defh9-ri-iaam plants to set fruits. poor fruit set and dramatic reduction in fruit size has been reported in tomato plants grown at 26°c under controlled conditions  <cit> . defh9-ri-iaam parthenocarpic fruits had a shape similar to that of the control and no malformations were observed, confirming the data obtained for t <dig> plants  <cit> . the reduction of weight observed in parthenocarpic fruit grown under open field conditions, might be due to the increased number of fruits caused by the improved fruit set of parthenocarpic plants. a different agronomical practice  apt for high fruit-set lines  might improve fruit weight, and consequently plant productivity.

except for the colour coordinate a* , the two transgenic parthenocarpic lines showed no relevant variation of the technological properties  compared to the untransformed control cv. uc  <dig>  interestingly, all three genotypes in the uc  <dig> background differed from the modern f <dig> hybrid allflesh for the solid soluble content , which is a very important trait for processing tomato. the presence of the transgene defh9-ri-iaam showed no significant influence on the amount of the biochemical compounds relevant for tomato processing quality. in fact, the organic acids, vitamin c, lycopene and tomatine were not different between the two gm lines and their control. the amount of β-carotene, a beneficial dietary bioactive for humans, was higher in the transgenic lines compared to both the control and the f <dig> allflesh. this represents the main difference between transgenic and control fruits. some natural parthenocarpic variants of tomato have a higher β-carotene level than their original cultivars  <cit> . no differences were observed for the antioxidant activity and polyphenol content between the transgenic lines and the cv. uc  <dig>  for these traits, few differences were observed between the f <dig> allflesh and one uc  <dig> genotype . similar results have been obtained in transgenic tomatoes engineered for other traits  <cit> .

to determine the substantial equivalence and identify possible unintended effect in engineered food it has been proposed that biochemical fingerprinting be expanded beyond the comparison between transgenic genotypes and its correspondent untransformed controls to include several non-transgenic lines  <cit> . this approach can allow the determination of whether any difference originate from metabolic effect associated with the transgenic trait or from expected genetic and/or physiological variation within the species. in the present study the extent of variation was higher between the traditional uc  <dig> cultivar  and the last generation f <dig> hybrid allflesh.

CONCLUSIONS
this trial has demonstrated that, under open field conditions allowing pollination/fertilization, the defh9-ri-iaam transgene was able to sustain parthenocarpic fruit development in the cv. uc  <dig>  biochemical and technological analyses performed on tomato fruit  showed a very little variation that is well within the variability of the species lycopersicon esculentum. yield per plant did not differ between gm and non-gm, in gm lines fruit weight was decreased, whilst fruit number was increased.
