BACKGROUND
the brain is a complex organ of vertebrates and it is composed of single specialized cells called neurons. neurons are connected among them by synapses forming a complex network of connections. connections among neurons carry signal pulses that carry information  <cit> . the activity of the brain is mostly due to this set of connections.

recent studies have demonstrated in an independent way a strict relation among the set of connections, the functions of the brains and the relations among the insurgence of neurological diseases and the variations of mechanims of connections with respect to healthy people  <cit> . for example, in the alzheimer disease a decreased connectivity, and hippocampus changes are detected  <cit> , the parkinson disease is associated to altered connectivity  <cit> , or in anxiety disorder an increased connectivity and amygdala changes is found  <cit> .

consequently, the interest for the modeling and the analysis of the whole system of the brain elements and their relations has lead to the introduction of the so-called connectomics, i.e the study of connectome referred to as the set of elements and interactions  <cit> . connectomics is based on modern technologies of investigation of the brain that are able to take a sort of picture of the brain connections of patients  <cit> . connectome may be analyzed using different zoom, e.g. by focusing on single components, i.e. neurons and axons, or grouping them into regions. usually the analysis of single components is defined to as anatomic connectivity, while the analysis of regions is called functional connectivity because regions are in general perfoming different functions.

among the others, one of the main sources for deriving information about connectomes is magnetic resonance imaging   <cit> . a typical mri experiment produces a set of images providing both anatomical and functional information. the first one is constituted by axonal fibers between cortical regions, the second one provides information about the functional connectivity, i.e. the activation of region of interest . such analysis is often conducted by using diffusion tensor imaging  that is a specialised version of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging , and a dti has been used extensively to map white matter tractography in the brain through the analysis of patterns of diffusion of molecules through bundles of neural axons. the anatomical connectivity structures are primarily derived through applying tractography algorithms to dti data. functional connectivity data are derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging . the fmri images show active regions of the brain at a given instance, based on the blood oxygen consumption level. the obtained networks are called functional networks. the combined use of these two techniques is used to determine the structure of human brain connectome as depicted in fig.  <dig> 
fig.  <dig> building a representative network from experimental data: example of a workflow. diffusion or functional mri images are acquired for a subject according to the study to be conducted. the mris are used to perform whole-brain parcellation by selecting a suitable method. starting from the parcelled whole brain the computation of connections is performed and a weighted adjacency matrix is constructed. then, the weights of adjacency matrix are binarized. finally, the resulting brain network is obtained




once obtained, connectome data needs to be integrated into a suitable model. one of the most used representation of such data is given by the graph theory, whose models have been used by different approaches to extract clinically relevant information  <cit> . graph theory ensures the possibility of modeling such data into a single network model and then the possibility to summarize all the characteristics into few measures, giving the understanding of the organization of the entire network as well as individual network elements  <cit> .

differently to other kind of networks, the modeling of connectomes using graphs is a open research area since there are many possibility for defining the nodes, the edges, that corresponds to different scale of views. for instance, nodes may represent neurons and edges their axons  <cit> . here we focus on the representation of region of interest  as nodes, and the representation of functional or anatomical connections as edges. there exist three main categories of research applied on such networks:  the improvement of the reconstruction of graphs starting from mri images,  the identification of the structure of networks ,  the identification of relevant modules that may be used to understand brain functions and their modifications in case of disease . the first and the third problem strictly rely on the definition of a framework for the comparison of graphs.

considering, for instance, the first problem it should be noted that each mri experiment produces a series of images  that need to be aligned into a spatial domain. when using both functional and structural images, coregistration is the process of the alignment of functional and structural images to map functional information into anatomical space. in such a way each region will correspond to a node of a network using an atlas to define anatomically meaningful regions  <cit> .

nevertheless, such an approach may lead to substantial inaccuracies in cases of abnormal anatomy  and early brain development . to address this problem, it has been recently proposed to use atlas-free parcellation and to construct and compare individual connectomes only in the network space  <cit> . in  <cit>  the authors perform the atlas-free parcellation as the finest parcellation that still interconnects the whole brain, leaving no nodes isolated. then, they group subjects into homogeneous groups and the na is performed within each group. the sum network is obtained and mapped to the anatomy of a “reference brain.”

such work, demonstrates the possibility to use na into the atlas-free parcellation workflow and it poses to the research community the challenge to systematically explore the performance of different na algorithms since different na approaches are widely applied in molecular biology analysis, but they have not been explored yet in relation to mri connectomics.

the techniques for the alignment of biological networks fall into two categories:  the local network alignment searches relatively small similar subnetworks that are likely to represent conserved functional structures,  the global network alignment looks for the best superimposition of the whole input networks. however, these approaches can not be easily applied in the connectome alignment problem. the reason is related to the strategy underlying methodology of alignment. for example, the local network aligners, widely used to build the alignment of protein interaction networks   <cit> , take as input two networks and a list of seed nodes used to build the initial alignment graph . these initial nodes are selected based on biological consideration, such as homology relationships between nodes of pins. since the nodes of the brain networks represent rois, the homology information cannot be obtained in the case of connectome networks and then, the local alignment cannot be applied.

in this paper we selected six existing state of the art global alignment algorithms and we tested these aligners on diffusion mri-derived brain networks. the algorithms tested here are magna++  <cit> , netal  <cit> , ghost  <cit> , gedevo  <cit> , wave  <cit> , natalie <dig>   <cit> . the algorithms are applied to build the alignments among the diffusion mri-derived brain networks. after the alignments were built, we compared the performance of these algorithms and evaluated this robustness.

brain parcellation
an essential step in the analysis and macroscopic mapping of brain network is the subdivision of the brain into large-scale regions, also known as “parcellation process”. the brain parcellation consists of dividing the brain into a set of macroscopic, homogeneous and non-overlapping regions with respect to information provided, generally, by techniques based on magnetic resonance imaging   <cit> . especially, mri has allowed to obtain information about anatomical connectivity, functional connectivity, or task-related activation. different pieces of evidence demonstrate that parcellation of the brain into the homogeneous region is far from being defined, as well as the edges definition and their placement. in the graph representation of a parcellation-based connectome, the nodes of the graph correspond to a brain region and the edges correspond to structural or functional connections between these regions. despite its relative simplicity, the application of graph theory to the study of connectomes presents some particular challenges related to the meaningful definition of nodes and edges. an ideal model should represent the true subsystems  and the true relations . however, as deeply investigated in  <cit> , there is no clear evidence for the optimal definition of both nodes and edges. for example, an ideal node definition should group a set of neurons to maximize the functional homogeneity within and to maximize the functional heterogeneity among different nodes. moreover, it should take into account the spatial  relationship among nodes. besides the definition, the edges representation is also currently an open challenge and this task is related to the type of measured connectivity, and the method used to quantify it. as mentioned above, brain connectivity can refer to different aspects of brain organization including  anatomical connectivity consisting of axonal fibers connecting cortical and subcortical regions inferred from diffusion imaging ), and  functional connectivity defined as the observed statistical correlations of the blood oxygenation level dependent  signal between brain regions.

that is, the choice of parcellation scheme has a significant impact on the subsequent analysis. there currently exist three parcellation-based connectome approaches: 
parcellation of the brain by using predefined anatomical templates. this approach consists of the registration of the structural images from mri to anatomical atlas based on the brodmann areas  <cit> . in this way, the whole brain is subdivided into labeled regions according to the different labels regions of the templates;

parcellation of the brain by using randomly generated templates  <cit> . for the random parcellation different algorithms are applied to produce parcels of roughly equal size. thus, the generated templates are characterized by approximately uniformly sized brain regions to avoid anatomical biases;


connectivity-based parcellations that aim to delineate brain regions by analyzing the similarities in structural or functional connectivity patterns. based on the notion that regions with a similar connectivity profile are involved in the same analogous functional roles, the connectivity-based parcellation partitions small seed regions into a largest collection of functionally homogeneous brain regions by clustering seeds with similar connectivity profiles.




however, each method presents some pitfalls. for example, the registration of brain of the studied subject to a generic brain with defined brodmann areas raises the question of the accuracy of mapping. in fact, in the most of the cases, the borders of the brodmann areas, originally defined using cytoarchitectural differences between brain regions, do not match with the cortical surface analyzed.

this approach is limited by inter-subject variability and can be especially problematic in the context of brain maturation. furthermore, it has been demonstrated that parcellation of brain with predefined anatomical templates may impact negatively all the subsequent analysis by introducing evident biases  <cit> . in this paper we focus on the random, atlas-free definition of nodes in individual subjects ), which can allow for a fully network-driven study of the brain and for comparing brains of different subjects and, potentially, species  <cit> .

global network alignment algorithms
the identification of an accurate node mapping between atlas-free networks may offer significant details on the comparison of brains or structure of groups of subjects, such as healthy versus diseased subjects. many different network alignment methods have been proposed in biological fields  <cit> .

formally, a graph g is defined as g={v,e}, where v is a finite set of nodes and e is a finite set of edges. let g
1={v
 <dig> e
1} and g
2={v
 <dig> e
2} be two graphs, where v
 <dig>  are sets of nodes and e
 <dig>  are sets of edges, a graph alignment is the mapping between the nodes of the input networks that maximizes the similarity between mapped entities. from a theoretical point of view, the graph alignment problem consists of finding an alignment function  f:v
1→v
 <dig> that maximizes a cost function q. the similarity between the graphs is defined by a cost function, q, also known as the quality of the alignment.

let f be an alignment between two graphs g
 <dig> and g
 <dig>  given a node u from g
 <dig>  f is the set of nodes from g
 <dig> that are aligned under f to u. q expresses the similarity among two input graphs with respect to a specific alignment f and the formulation of q strongly influences the mapping strategy.

there exist different formulations of q that fall into following the classes:


topological similarity: graphs are aligned by considering only edge topology, so that the perfect alignment is reached when input graphs are isomorphic.

usually, the cost function is defined as the number of edges conserved by f with respect to the total number of edges in the source network , also referred to as edge correctness   <cit> . therefore, the ec does not take into account the target network . 
  <dig> ec=∈e1|f|∈e2|e1| 


another typical measure is the induced conserved structure, ics  <cit> . let d be the number of edges in a subnetwork of g
 <dig> induced on the nodes in g
 <dig> aligned to the nodes in g
 <dig>  ics of f is the ratio of the number of edges conserved by f to d. 
  <dig> ics=|f||e])| 


where d is |e])|.

however, ics fails in the penalization of misaligning edges in the smaller network because it takes into account the target network.

finally, the symmetric substructure score, s
 <dig> <cit> , takes into account the unique edges in the composite graph created by the overlap of two networks. 
  <dig> s3=|f||e1|+|e])|−|f| 



s
 <dig> has been shown to be superior to existing measures since it penalizes both alignments from sparse graph regions to dense graph regions and alignments from dense graph regions to sparse graph regions.


node similarity: such function considers the similarity among mapped nodes. nodes of the aligned graphs can be more or less similar to each other. thus the alignment should align each node of one graph to the most similar node of the other one given a node similarity functions, s→r, v
1∈v
 <dig>  v
2∈v
 <dig>  the overall objective is to maximize the sum of scores considering aligned nodes. 
  <dig> nc=maxsumv <dig> v2=fs 



hybrid approaches: some recent formulations of q take into account of both of the approaches by linear combination.

the network alignment problem can be formulated in various ways. in general, the network alignment can be classified as local alignment or global alignment.

the local alignment aims to find multiple and unrelated regions of isomorphism, i.e. same graph structure, between the input networks, where each region implies a mapping independently of other regions. the strategy consists of the mapping or set of mappings between subsets of nodes such that their similarity is maximal over all possible subsets. these subnetworks correspond to conserved patterns of interaction that can represent a conserved motif or pattern of activities . the global alignment aims to find a mapping that should cover all of the nodes of the input networks, associating each node of a network with one node of the other networks or marking the node as a gap when no possible match exists. this strategy does not consider small regions of similarity, i.e. conserved motifs, but tries to find a consistent mapping between the whole set of nodes of the networks.

in this work, six global alignment algorithms were chosen to built the global alignment of brain networks. we give hereafter a short conceptual description.

a popular existing method of global alignment is magna  <cit> . magna is a global network aligner that simulates a population of alignments that evolves over time by applying a genetic algorithm and a function for the crossover of two alignments into a superior alignment. since the genetic algorithm simulates the evolutionary process guided by the survival of the fittest principle, only alignments, i.e. those that conserve the most edges, survive. thus, magna proceeds to the next generation, until the alignment accuracy cannot be optimized further. recently, an extension of magna algorithm called magna++ was developed.

the second aligner is netal  <cit> , an algorithm for the global alignment widely used to protein-protein interaction networks. netal builds the best global network alignment by applying a greedy method, based on the alignment scoring matrix, which is derived from both biological and topological information of input networks.

the third algorithm, ghost  <cit> , is a global pairwise network aligner that uses a novel spectral signature based on the local neighborhood’s topology to measure topological similarity between subnetworks. the idea behind ghost consists of the combination of the novel novel spectral signature with seed-and-extend procedure to build the alignment.

the fourth global aligner is gedevo  <cit> , a novel tool for efficient graph alignment.

underlying the gedevo method is the graph edit distance model , where a graph is transferred into another one with a minimal number of edge insertions and deletions. thus, gedevo uses the ged as optimization model for finding the best alignments.

the fifth algorithm is wave  <cit>  a general and novel alignment strategy which aim is to optimize both node and edge conservation while constructing an alignment. wave is used on top of an established node cost function and it leads to a new superior method for global network alignment, by favoring conserved edges among nodes with node cost function similar over those with node cost function dissimilar.

the last algorithm is natalie <dig>   <cit> , a network alignment method, which looks at the network alignment problem as a generalization of the quadratic assignment problem and solves it using techniques from integer linear programming.

building of brain network alignment
we built the alignment of all networks with  <dig> and  <dig> nodes  related to same growth stages  by applying magna++, netal, ghost, gedevo, wave and natalie <dig>  algorithms. initially, we aligned each network with itself. we executed this stage in order to test if the algorithm is able to build the alignment . then, we aligned the brain network related to the same growth stage, ne, 6m, ad. we run all na methods on the same linux machine with intel core i <dig> and 4gb of ram. we also generated the same alignments using the six na algorithm selected. we selected the following magna++ parameters: s
 <dig> as measure of edge conservation, the α parameter equal to  <dig>  in order to consider only topology, whereas the population size, number of generation, fraction of elite members were set to default values. we tested different parameters and obtained best results with the default parameters for netal, ghost, gedevo, natalie <dig> . wave did not require to set specific parameters. the netal parameters were: a that controls the weight of similarity and interaction scores, b that controls the weight of biological and topological similarities, c that controls the contribution of neighbors of two nodes in calculating the similarity between them, i that defines the number of iterations for computing similarities. in gedevo, pop parameter that controls the number of new individuals per iteration set equal to  <dig> and maxsame that controls the stop after n iterations without any score improvement were equal to  <dig>  in natalie <dig> , beta set equal to  <dig>  in order to consider only topology, whereas, maxjsonnodes that controls maximum number of nodes to be generated and verbosity that specifies the verbosity level parameters were set to default values. to build the alignment using ghost, nneighbors was set to all, serchiter that controls the number of local search iterations that should be performed after the initial global alignment is complete, set equal to  <dig>  beta that controls the edges alignment in the initial seed-and-extend phase of the algorithm, set equal to  <dig>  ratio that controls ratio of bad-moves allowed during the local-search phase of the alignment algorithm, set equal to  <dig> .

topological evaluation
here, we aim to evaluate the quality of the alignments built with magna++, netal, ghost, gedevo, wave, natalie <dig>  na algorithms. the topological quality is related to two alignment algorithm capability as the reconstruction of the true node mapping and the conservation of as much as possible edges. typically, the node correctness  is the measure widely used to evaluate how an alignment reconstructs the true node mapping correctly. instead, different measures are used to evaluate how well the edges are conserved on an alignment, such as ec, ics or s
 <dig> . however, among the selected algorithm, magna++ is the unique tool that enables to compute all quality measures, nc, ec, ics and s
 <dig>  for this reason, we computed the quality of built alignments by using the software for na evaluation proposed in  <cit> . the software ensures the computation of six topological measures: precision node correctness , recall node correctness , f-score of node correctness , high node coverage , generalized s
 <dig> , and ncv combined with g s
 <dig> . p-nc evaluates the the precision of the alignment i.e. the percentage of the aligned node pairs that are also present in the true node mapping. p-nc is defined as: 
  <dig> p−nc= 


were m is the set of node pairs that are mapped under the true node mapping and n be the set of node pairs that are aligned under f.

r-nc evaluates the percentage of all node pairs from the true node mapping that are aligned under f and it is defined as: 
  <dig> r−nc= 


g s
 <dig> is the percentage of conserved edges n
c out of the total of both conserved and non-conserved edges n
n: 
  <dig> gs3=ncnc+nn 


ncv is the percentage of nodes from g <dig> and g <dig> that are also in g’ <dig> and g’ <dig> subgraphs:


  <dig> ncv=v1′+v2′v1+v <dig> 


finally, ncv-g s
 <dig> is the geometric mean of the ncv and g s
 <dig> measures. these six measures evaluate alignment quality from different aspects and they can be divided in two groups, the first one composed by p-nc, r-nc and f-n measures that estimate how well the alignment captures the true node mapping, and the second one formed by ncv, g s
 <dig> and ncv-g s
 <dig> measures that capture the size of the alignment. we computed p-nc, r-nc, f-nc, ncv, g s
 <dig> and ncv-g s
 <dig> for each alignment built with magna++, netal, ghost, gedevo, wave, natalie <dig> . then, we compared these measures in order to analyze which algorithm ensures a higher alignment quality. however, we focus on f-nc and ncv-gs <dig> as the most representative non-redundant measures because these are both a combination of two individual measures.

robustness analysis
we analyzed the robustness of the different algorithms to various levels of graph alteration . we generated a series of altered networks derived from the high-confidence brain network. we built the synthetic counterparts with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 25% of added noise. we obtained  <dig> synthetic networks with  <dig> nodes and  <dig> synthetic networks with  <dig> nodes. to measure the performance of magna++, netal, ghost, gedevo, wave, natalie <dig> , we aligned the high-confidence brain network with its noisy counterparts obtained by random removal of edges from the network. since all networks contain the same nodes, we know the true node mapping. the high-confidence network is an exact subgraph of each noisy network. exploiting randomness, we ran each experiment  <dig> times and averaged results over the  <dig> runs  <cit> . the aim of the test was to demonstrate that the alignment algorithms are capable of producing high-quality alignments with edge conservation of about 90%. this evaluation test has been widely adopted in different na studies . we performed this test on the brain networks built with each selected global aligner and with netal. the results show that, given the high topological similarity of the aligned network with its noisy counterpart, magna++, netal, ghost, gedevo, wave, natalie <dig>  are capable of discovering alignments with high edge conservation. the better performance was achieved with magna++. figures  <dig> and  <dig> show the validation of the edge conservation when introducing increasing noise level from  <dig> to 25% into the high-confidence brain networks.

CONCLUSIONS
understanding brain connectivity can shed light on the brain cognitive functioning that occurs via the connections and interaction between neurons. the term brain connectivity refers to different aspects of brain organization including anatomical connectivity consisting of axonal fibers across cortical regions and functional connectivity defined as the observed statistical correlations of the bold signal between regions of interest. a powerful formalism to represent the brain connectivity derives from graph theory. the graph theoretical modeling of the human connectome has already enabled important discoveries and will most likely continue to do this in the future. in this study we proposed to apply classical global alignment algorithms such as magna++, netal, ghost, gedevo, wave, natalie <dig> , to align atlas-free human brain networks at three developmental stages. we analyzed the alignment results in term of topological quality measures and performance. according to these analyses, magna++ resulted the best alignment algorithm. our ongoing study is focused on the implementation of an ad hoc algorithm for connectome alignment. since there are many conditions in which the classical parcellation is not useful, we retain that this seminal work may open the way for the use of network alignment in atlas-free parcellation.
