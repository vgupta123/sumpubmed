BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small  endogenous non-coding rnas that function as post-transcriptional gene regulators of a variety of biological processes  <cit> . most mirnas discovered at the early stage are highly conserved among species, indicating strong functional constraints on mirna evolution. however, an increasing number of rapidly evolving mirnas have been discovered and experimentally verified  <cit> . in an evolutionary study, bentwich et al. reported two mirna clusters in primates with more copies than those present in rodents, suggesting mirna gene expansion during primate evolution. one of the two clusters, the mir-506- <dig> cluster, is located on the x chromosome and is preferentially expressed in testis  <cit> . zhang et al. reported that this cluster has undergone rapid evolution in primates, with frequent gene duplications and nucleotide substitutions. in rhesus macaques, for example, expression analysis revealed a strong correlation between mirna expression changes and male sexual maturation  <cit> . unfortunately, to date, the functional significance of these duplicated mirnas has not been experimentally established.

in the mir-506- <dig> cluster, the mir- <dig> subfamily has the greatest diversity in terms of both copy number and sequence variations  <cit> . there are also between-copy sequence substitutions in the mature mirnas, especially in the seed region, which are critical for gene targeting. these observations collectively suggest that members of the mir- <dig> subfamily may play different roles in gene regulation.

in the most general sense, studying non-conserved mirna may help to clarify how mirnas originate and evolve, and likewise contribute to functional divergence among species. in the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the frequently observed gene duplications and sequence divergences in the mir- <dig> subfamily, and evaluated the impact of these sequence substitutions on target gene regulation and functional diversification.

RESULTS
mir- <dig> is a rapidly evolving mirna subfamily in primates
the mir- <dig> subfamily belongs to the mir-506- <dig> cluster located on the x chromosome. according to the mir- <dig> annotation in mirbase  and remapping the mir- <dig> precursor sequences to primate species’ genomes that are sequenced , aside from one orthologous copy in the rat genome , mir- <dig> exists only in primates. among the primate lineages, the mouse lemur  possesses only one copy, where there are multiple gene copies in haplorrhini  . for example, the spider monkey  possesses eight copies, and old world monkeys possess five copies, while gibbons, great apes and humans all possess four copies. these copies are named from “a” to “e”, based on their sequences in mirbase. interestingly, after alignment with known repeat sequences, the mir- <dig> copies seem likely to have been derived from mer91c , a dna transposable element  <cit> . all mir- <dig> copies are co-localized with mer91c and their sequences are similar . other genes of the mir-506- <dig> cluster, however, are not similar with mer91c, suggesting that the mechanism behind gene duplications in the mir- <dig> subfamily is different from the others.

to further investigate the origin of duplication events among gene copies of mir- <dig> in primates, we reconstructed the phylogenetic tree using the mir- <dig> precursor sequences from the aforementioned primate species. both neighbor-joining  and maximum likelihood  methods were used for tree construction and the topologies of the trees by these two methods are highly similar . we also used the angst program to produce a chimeric gene tree , and the tree topology remains the same. interestingly, most copies from the spider monkey cluster together, and the gene order of the eight mir- <dig> copies suggests a tandem duplication of a fragment containing three copies . the age-mir-513d is not clustered together. by contrast, in catarrhini  the clustering of mir- <dig> copies is not in agreement with the accepted species phylogeny. instead, copies with same or similar mature mirna sequences cluster together , indicating ancient duplications of mir- <dig> in the common ancestor of catarrhini after the divergence from platyrrhini , but before the old world species split. by using angst and notung, we also reconciled the gene trees with the species tree to infer duplication events along the branches, among which many independent gene duplications occurred in different primate lineages .

as reflected in the phylogenetic tree and sequence alignment of mature mir- <dig> sequences , mir-513b is probably the ancestral copy in catarrhini, while mir-513a and mir-513c are derived copies generated by duplications. this inference was confirmed by the seed sequence comparison showing the same seed region in mir-513b with its orthologous copy in rats and an ancestral copy in the mouse lemur while both mir-513a and mir-513c have a single-base difference from mir-513b in the seed region . additionally, in catarrhini, the formation of mir-513c was after the old world species split and exists in apes and humans. sequence alignment suggests that mir-513c emerged independently in gibbons, and there are varied copies in great apes and humans . for all three known great apes, there are two mir-513c copies in gorillas which were derived from mir-513b and lost in chimpanzees. the single mir-513al copy in orangutans was derived from mir-513a according to the phylogenetic tree and sequence alignment. notably, all mir-513al/c copies have a single-base substitution  from their original sequence in gibbons and great apes, while the human mir-513c owns both substitutions . likewise, sequence divergences among the mir- <dig> copies have occurred, consistent with the previously proposed rapid evolution of the mir-506- <dig> cluster.

functional divergence among gene copies of the mir- <dig> subfamily
since the seed region of mirna is critical for gene targeting, the between-copy nucleotide differences may potentially lead to functional divergence among gene copies of the mir- <dig> subfamily. to test this hypothesis, we searched potential target genes by targetscans, a widely used method with low false positive rate. we then selected eight predicted target genes for luciferase assay testing. these target genes are gng <dig> , dr <dig> , ybx <dig> , ctns , btg <dig> , nipal <dig> , il13ra <dig>  and pi4k2b . all target sites in these genes are the same among different primate species, and we therefore used human genes for experimental validation. the change of secondary structure due to the length of 3′ utr has been known to potentially affect the binding between mirnas and their target sites. to avoid this, we cloned the full-length 3′ utrs of the candidate genes for use in a luciferase assay. we used both hela and hek293t cell lines to exclude the influence of different cell environments. the results showed that mir-513a, mir-513b and mir-513c are all capable of targeting their predicted sites in the 3′utrs of gng <dig>  dr <dig> and btg <dig> respectively , while the remaining five genes showed no evidence of significant regulation . notably, the mirna-dependent inhibition of luciferase expression is specific for each member of the mir- <dig> subfamily , suggesting that different copies  with diverged seed sequences developed functional divergence by targeting different genes.

expression of gng <dig>  dr <dig> and btg <dig> in testis of rhesus macaques
luciferase analysis indicated that gng <dig>  dr <dig> and btg <dig> are the respectively potential target genes of mir-513a, mir-513b and mir-513c. previously, zhang et al. reported that the mir- <dig> subfamily members are preferentially expressed in testis, and that expression decreases sharply during the course of sexual maturation in male rhesus macaques, suggesting that mir- <dig> may play some unknown functional roles in testis  <cit> . based on this finding, we tested the expression of gng <dig>  dr <dig> and btg <dig> in testis tissues of both infant and adult male rhesus macaques. in both infant and adult rhesus testis, dr <dig> and btg <dig> are expressed, but gng <dig> is undetectable. interestingly, a significantly increased expression of dr <dig> and btg <dig> in testis of adult macaques was observed as compared with the infant macaques measured by real-time quantitative pcr , which is negatively correlated with the expression of the mir- <dig> members  <cit> . our observation suggests that mir-513b and mir-513c may affect the development of testis by regulating dr <dig> and btg <dig> 

mir-513b down-regulates the expression of dr <dig> at mrna and protein levels
to further demonstrate whether mir-513b and mir-513c can inhibit the expression of dr <dig> and btg <dig>  we measured both mrna and protein expression levels of endogenous dr <dig> and btg <dig> in hela cells, after introducing the synthetic mir-513a/b/c and the negative control mirnas. we found that mir-513b could significantly decrease the expression of dr <dig> both at the mrna and protein levels, while mir-513c had no obvious impact on the mrna and protein expression level of btg <dig> .

discussion
mir- <dig> is an x-linked mirna subfamily with multiple copies that has undergone rapid evolution in primates. sequence comparisons revealed that the duplicated copies of mir- <dig> were derived from transposable elements , different from other members within the mir-506- <dig> cluster. zhang et al. showed that the duplications of another subfamily  in this cluster occurred independently in humans and chimpanzees  <cit> . by contrast, the initial duplication event of the mir- <dig> subfamily seems to have occurred earlier in the common ancestor of catarrhini. together, these results indicated that the mir- <dig> subfamily has a unique evolutionary history, quite different from other members in the same mirna cluster.

different copies of the mir- <dig> subfamily  with diverged seed sequences seem to have led to functional divergences. our results showed that mir-513a, mir-513b and mir-513c are capable of specifically targeting their predicted sites in the 3′utrs of gng <dig>  dr <dig> and btg <dig> respectively. gng <dig> is a guanine nucleotide binding protein subunit, expressed in taste, retinal, and neuronal tissues, and earlier studies reported gng <dig> playing a key role in taste transduction  <cit> . in contrast to one or several mirna binding sites in the 3′ utrs of target genes, there are  <dig> target sites of mir-513a in the 3′ utr of gng <dig>  because the 3′ utr of gng <dig> contains  <dig> repeat elements matching the recognition site of mir-513a, resulting in a strong mir-513a-dependent inhibition of luciferase expression. additionally, gong et al. reported that mir-513a could regulate b7-h1’s translation and is involved in the ifn-gamma signal pathway in cholangiocyte  <cit> . these findings suggest that the functional role of mir-513a is likely diverged from mir-513b/c and may not be related to male reproduction—an implication of neo-functionalization.

dr <dig>  is a tbp  associated phosphoprotein that regulates both basal and activated levels of transcription  <cit> . btg <dig> is a member of the btg3/tob family that has antiproliferative properties  <cit> . previous reports offered no substantive proof as to whether dr <dig> or btg <dig> is involved in testicular development. however, over the course of our study we observed significant up-regulation of both dr <dig> and btg <dig> in the testis after sexual maturation of male rhesus macaques, and a negative correlation between the expression of dr1/btg <dig> and mir- <dig>  suggesting mir-513′s role on testicular development via its regulation of dr <dig> and btg <dig>  moreover, we showed that mir-513b could inhibit the expression of dr <dig> in vitro at both the mrna and protein levels. tbp  has been reported to play an important role on spermatogenesis  <cit> . taken together, these findings prompt us to propose that mir-513b affects male sexual maturation by negatively regulating the development-stage-related functioning of dr <dig>  although there is no solid functional evidence, mir-513c emerged only in apes and humans, but shown sequence divergence in different lineages, implying that it may contribute to lineage-specific functions.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we demonstrated that the mir- <dig> subfamily underwent multiple independent gene duplications among different lineages of primates. more importantly, the after-duplication sequence divergences among the copies of mir- <dig> have led to functional divergence of these copies in primates.
