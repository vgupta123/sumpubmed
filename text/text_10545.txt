BACKGROUND
staphyloccus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen capable of causing a wide variety of infectious diseases and is usually associated with humans as commensal colonizing organisms in at least 30% of the population  <cit> . staphylococcal infections are primarily of the skin and soft tissues; however, they are capable of causing much more serious systemic infections and death, especially when associated with methicillin resistance  <cit> . initially, outbreaks of methicillin resistant s. aureus  infections were associated with hospitals and healthcare-associated exposures in compromised patients; however, since the late  <dig> s with the emergence of new more aggressive community-associated mrsa , these infections are no longer limited to these settings.

since its emergence, outbreaks of ca-mrsa infections in otherwise young healthy individuals  <cit>  have been linked to close contact and sharing of common facilities such as locker rooms, schools and prisons  <cit> . these community-associated strains have made their way into the hospitals  <cit> , being responsible for a significant number of hospital-acquired infections; and in a recent report, they have now been shown to be responsible for the majority of skin infections requiring treatment in emergency departments in multiple u.s. cities  <cit> .

waterborne transmission routes have not been traditionally associated with s. aureus infections. however, in some earlier studies, investigators in hawaii reported cases of s. aureus infections associated with exposure to coastal marine waters  <cit> , with humans serving as the suspected primary source  <cit> . they also showed that these organisms are able to remain viable in seawater over several days  <cit> . therefore, coastal marine waters used for recreation could provide a transmission pathway for both colonization and/or infection of individuals. previous studies have also identified s. aureus in recreational marine water  <cit> , and s. aureus and mrsa in sand  <cit> .

in an earlier study attempting to quantify s. aureus release by humans in marine water  <cit> , investigators showed that humans shed greater quantities of s. aureus than the fecal indicator bacteria enterococci. however, this earlier study was limited in its methodology and criteria used to isolate and confirm s. aureus, and it did not address the potential presence of mrsa in the isolates. furthermore, the study was also limited to an adult population, and it did not evaluate for s. aureus colonization of the human population studied.

as recreational marine waters and beaches may be commonly used by many people over the course of a short period of time, the risk of exposure to all microorganisms that are in this environment increases. given that transmission of s. aureus  has been documented in settings associated with shared facilities and close contact, the use of recreational marine waters and beaches could certainly represent another possible route of exposure and transmission of these potentially pathogenic organisms and warrant investigation.

the aim of this study was to evaluate the amounts, as well as the characteristics, of s. aureus, methicillin sensitive s. aureus , and mrsa shed by humans into recreational waters and sands. in this study, s. aureus, mssa, and mrsa shed from adults, and for the first time children, were identified using stringent selection and identification procedures.

methods
the study was approved by the florida department of health internal review board  and the university of miami internal review board . consent forms were signed by each study participant , and participant identity was kept confidential. the field experimental design followed that of elmir et al.  <cit> , including the use of the same study site .

pool field studies
the "large pool" field study was used to determine the total amount of s. aureus and the distribution of s. aureus relative to mssa and mrsa released from the bodies of adult bathers  <cit> . briefly, after filling an inflatable pool with  <dig> l of local off-shore marine water , two groups of  <dig> adult participants were subjected to a series of four continuous 15-minute bathing cycles conducted on a single day in july  <dig> beginning at 9: <dig> am and 12: <dig> pm, respectively. in between bathing cycles, the pool was cleaned and refilled from the same source water. participants had no sand exposure during the first two cycles, but were exposed to beach sand during the last two cycles. samples of the source water, pool water before participant contact  and pool water after participant contact  were collected after each cycle. source water, pool water and residual sand samples were analyzed as described below. the demographic characteristics of the  <dig> adult "large pool" participants  included an age range from  <dig> to  <dig> years old, and body weights ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kg  <cit> .

the "small pool" field study was used to determine the total amounts of s. aureus and the distribution of s. aureus among mssa and mrsa released from the bodies of a pediatric population, including an estimate of the contribution from the sand adhered to the pediatric participant  <cit> . briefly, in the same area of the beach as the adult studies during two days in july and august of  <dig>   <dig> individual toddlers wearing bathing suits over diapers spent  <dig> to  <dig> minutes on the beach sand . following sand exposure, toddlers were placed in a 190-liter tub, while local off-shore marine water  was poured from sanitized watering cans gently over their heads and bodies. when necessary the toddlers were held upright in pool by an adult with either gloved hands or hands sanitized with alcohol. sanitation of the pool and sample collections  were performed as described  <cit> . source water, pool water and residual sand samples were analyzed as described below. the demographic characteristics of the  <dig> "small pool" toddlers  included ages ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> months, and weights ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kg  <cit> .

prior to study initiation, nasal cultures were obtained from the anterior nares from all participants using rayon swabs  and s. aureus were cultured as described below.

bacterial isolation and identification
s. aureus was isolated from the water samples using a standard membrane filtration  method  <cit> , followed by growth on selective media, baird parker agar  with egg yolk  tellurite enrichment , bp, and chromagar, chr  . mssa and mrsa isolated from bp plates were subjected to genetic tests and compared to organisms isolated from nasal cultures. mssa isolated from chr plates was used for direct comparison of colony counts obtained during previous studies. facilities used for processing samples were located within minutes from the study site, allowing for the processing of samples within one hour after collection. volumes of the source water used for filtration were  <dig> ml and  <dig> ml; volumes of the pool water samples used for filtration prior to and after adult participant contact were  <dig> ml and  <dig> ml respectively; volumes of the water used for filtration after contact with the pediatric participants were  <dig> ml,  <dig> ml, and  <dig> ml. multiple volumes were filtered in order to obtain quantifiable colony counts as the levels of bacteria in both the source water and the experimental pool water samples were unknown.

the analysis of s. aureus in sand was similar to that for water with the exception of two pre-processing steps. the first step measured the water content of sand . the second step extracted bacteria from the sand particles to a predefined volume of sterile water. to accomplish this, pre-weighed un-dried sand was aseptically removed from the corresponding sample container and placed into a sterile pre-weighed jar. one hundred and ten milliliters of sterile phosphate buffer saline  were added to each jar, and the jars were shaken vigorously for  <dig> seconds. the samples were permitted to settle for  <dig> seconds, and the supernatant was subsequently used for membrane filtration. one hundred milliliters of the sand eluate samples were used for the filtration and bacterial quantification.

following standard mf, filter membranes were placed on bp and chr, and incubated aerobically at 37°c for a minimum of  <dig> h. after incubation, colonies found to be black, shiny, convex, 2- <dig> mm in diameter, and surrounded by clear zones  or mauve , were considered presumptive s. aureus, and subjected to confirmatory tests. all presumptive positive isolates were transferred to mannitol salt agar , for the determination of mannitol fermentation, and incubated aerobically at 37°c for 16- <dig> h. all mannitol-fermenting isolates were enriched  <cit>  on trypticase soy agar with 5% sheep blood  for determination of colony morphology and gross pigmentation, the ability to lyse red blood cells and to provide bacterial cells for latex agglutination tests for clumping factor and protein a using the remel bactistaph latex agglutination test .

the analysis of the nasal swab cultures focused on detection and genetic characterization, rather than quantification. the method used was the same as that used for the water samples, except that the membrane filtration step was omitted. utilizing standard aseptic techniques swabs were placed in  <dig>  ml tripticase soy broth tsb  supplemented with  <dig> % sodium chloride, and incubated overnight at 37°c for enrichment. one hundred micro-liters of the overnight broth were transferred to mannitol salt agar , and the organisms were identified and confirmed as detailed above.

chromosomal dna was extracted from colonies isolated from water, sand, and nasal cultures. whole cell extracts were prepared from latex agglutination positive bacterial isolates using the amplicor mtb sputum specimen preparation kit  according to the manufacture's recommendations, and used as template for confirming and characterizing polymerase chain reactions  as outlined below. these dna extracts  were subjected to pcr analysis of the s. aureus specific gyra gene for s. aureus confirmation and the meca gene for genetic mrsa confirmation. oligonucleotide primers and thermal cycling conditions were used as described previously  <cit> , with the minor modification that 5-µl of whole cell extract was used as template in initial pcr reactions instead of purified chromosomal dna.

all organisms determined to be genotypic mrsa  were re-isolated from agar plates, and grown on oxacillin resistance screening agar base media orsab , a selective media for confirmation of phenotypic mrsa. all genotypic mrsa isolates from this study showed the phenotypic characteristics of mrsa. all confirmed mrsa  and mssa  collected from water and sand samples and all nasal cultures were stored as stock strains at -80°c.

the number of colonies testing positive for gyra gene  and meca gene  were reported. counts were then adjusted to colony forming units per  <dig> ml water  or per  <dig> g sand  using the volume of water applied to the filters or the weight of the sand collected from the pool. the numbers of microbes shed per person were determined by multiplying the difference in microbial concentrations measured before and after bathing in the pools by the water volumes corresponding to each person.

genetic characterization
bacterial isolates determined to be positive for s. aureus specific gyra and mrsa specific meca were subjected to additional pcr to test for the toxin genes for panton-valentine leukocidin, pvl, to evaluate the pathogenic potential of isolated organisms as previously described  <cit> . staphylococcus cassette chromosome methicillin, sccmec, type was determined for all mrsa as described  <cit> ; and staphylococcus protein a, spa, type was determined for all mrsa and a representative subset of mssa as described  <cit>  and using ridom spa type server to analyze sequences. sccmec and spa types were determined in order to provide specific genetic characteristics for comparison between the nasal isolates from the colonized participants and the water samples from the pools. genetic characteristics were evaluated for all mrsa isolates and all mssa isolates from the nasal swabs, and from the water and sand samples from the small pool. due to the large number of s. aureus isolates from the large pool, genetic characterization was conducted on a representative set of the mssa isolates from each large pool water collection and choosen to include a subset of all colony morphology, gross pigmentation and rbc hemolysis type present in each set. all mssa collected from the small pool water samples from the single colonized pediatric participant were analyzed.

statistical analyses
data analyses  were performed using microsoft excel  <dig> and sigmaplot  <dig> 

RESULTS
off shore water quality
the physical-chemical characteristics of the source water taken off shore were typical of marine waters in subtropical environments . the concentrations of s. aureus in the source water samples prior to human exposure were primarily below the detection limit of  <dig> cfu/ <dig> ml. only  <dig> of  <dig>  samples measured at the detection limit of  <dig> cfu/ <dig> ml using the mf method with selection on chr. two of  <dig>  samples measured at  <dig> cfu/ <dig> ml using selection on bp. the concentrations of s. aureus in the pool before versus after bathing differed by two-orders-of-magnitude indicating that background levels of s. aureus in the source water was insignificant. mrsa was not detected from any source water samples. overall, these results are consistent with earlier studies that showed that the offshore waters at the study site are characterized by low concentrations of viable indicator bacteria  <cit> .

s. aureus released by bathers
in the large pool study with adults, the total quantities of s. aureus released per person were lower  by about an order of magnitude, in the first two bathing cycles as compared to elmir et al.  <cit>  who reported releases on the order of  <dig> per person . the results appeared to converge for the last two cycles at about  <dig> cfu/person released. on average for all four cycles and for both groups, s. aureus counts were  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/person from bp selection which was 40% higher than  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/person from chr selection.

based on analysis of water samples from a large pool with  <dig> adults using two different selective media, baird parker  and chromagar ; numbers shown correspond to confirmed numbers of s. aureus based upon detection of the specific gyra gene. bdl = below detection limit. bdls were transformed to 1/ <dig> of bdls in order to estimate averages and standard deviations. the theoretical detection limit  can be calculated from the volume of the large pool , the largest membrane filtration volume  and noting that  <dig> people bathed per cycle .

in the toddler studies carried out individually in the small pools, the total shedding of s. aureus was assumed to be the sum of the numbers observed in the sand component and in the water component. based on the sand analysis using bp selection, the numbers of s. aureus transported per toddler via sand ranged from less than the detection limit  to  <dig> cfu/person with an estimated average of  <dig> +/-  <dig> cfu/person . the estimated numbers of s. aureus  shed per toddler based on the water analysis was higher, ranging from less than the detection limit  to  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/person, with an average of  <dig>  ×  <dig> +/-  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/person. the high standard deviations of the sand and water results were due to a large number of samples measured at the detection limit of the method; however, when samples were positive, the detected levels were elevated. when evaluating the significance of the sand relative to the total amount shed, the sand contributions for the single "small pool" bathing cycle ranged from less than  <dig>  to  <dig> %, with an estimated average of  <dig>  +/-  <dig> .09% . subjects were excluded from this comparison if s. aureus was not detected in both sediment and water samples.

n/a = not applicable. bdl = below detection limit. bdls were transformed to 1/ <dig> of bdls in order to estimate averages and standard deviations. the theoretical detection limit  can be calculated from the volume of water poured on the toddler  and the largest membrane filtration volume .

distribution of mssa and mrsa: nasal colonization and detection in water
there were a total of  <dig> nasal cultures . a total of  <dig> adult study participants were determined to be colonized with s. aureus by nares cultures. two participants in group i had nasal cultures that were positive for mssa, and two in group ii were positive for mrsa. among the adult population evaluated, the majority of the s. aureus shed into the water was mssa. no mrsa was detected from group i adults. two of the  <dig> adult bathers in group ii were colonized with mrsa, and the group ii pool water was the only water where mrsa was detected. water from the three cycles from group ii tested positive for mrsa using bp selection, and water from the two cycles were positive for mrsa using chr selection.

normalizing the results by the  <dig> adult participants in group ii, mrsa shedding on a per person basis was  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/person for cycle  <dig>   <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/person for cycle  <dig>  and  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/person for cycle  <dig> as measured using bp selection; and  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/person and  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/person for cycles  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, for samples evaluated using chr selection. these values represent  <dig> to 20% of the total s. aureus observed in the pool water for group ii adults.

only one of the toddlers, subject t <dig>  was determined to have nasal colonization with mssa; however,  <dig> of the  <dig> , including t <dig>  had s. aureus isolated from their water samples. thirteen of the subjects carried sufficient sand/sediment into the pool for evaluation; however, only  <dig>  of these were positive for mssa, and this did not include subject t <dig> . all positive sand samples were associated with positive water samples, but only 40%  of the positive water samples were associated with sand; therefore, the sand did not account for the majority of mssa shed from the toddlers not known to be colonized. in fact, the sand sample from the only toddler determined to be colonized was negative for mssa. no nasal cultures from toddlers were positive for mrsa, and mrsa was not detected from any water or sediment samples from these participants. the lack of mrsa nasal colonization is consistent with the lack of mrsa in all of the sand and water samples from the toddler participants.

genetic characteristics
sccmec type, spa type and selected gene profiles  are presented for all the mrsa isolated from colonized individuals , and water samples  and selected toxin gene profiles and spa type are presented for all mssa from colonized individuals  and for a representative sample of corresponding water isolates  . among the mrsa, the  <dig> organisms isolated from the participants, and  <dig> of  <dig> of the mrsa from the water samples collected from the adult group ii study were identical by these analyses. the remaining  <dig> mrsa differed only in spa type. given the nasal culture results and comparison of the genetic analysis, the mrsa likely came primarily from the subset of colonized individuals among the  <dig> adult participants in the pool. therefore, the calculated amount of mrsa shedding per person could have been up to a factor of  <dig> higher .

isolate designations presented with source of collection site and subject. pcr was used to determine presence of gyra, s. aureus specific dna gyrase a gene; meca, methicillin resistance gene; pvl genes encoding panton-valentine leukocidin and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec type  staphylococcal protein a type, spa type are shown.

similarly, mssa with identical spa types were isolated from nares cultures and corresponding waters samples for the colonized toddler and the group i adults . non-identical mssa were also isolated from water samples of the colonized toddler  and from the group i adult study , indicating the presence of organisms associated with individuals but not identified in the nares cultures. mssa was also isolated from all water collections of the adult group ii study when no individuals were identified with mssa colonization; this also indicated the presence of organisms associated with individuals but not identified in nares cultures, and likely represents colonization of participating individuals in areas of the body other than the nares.

discussion
in these studies, we demonstrated that human bathers, both adults and toddlers in diapers, have the potential to release significant amounts of s. aureus  into the water column from direct shedding off their body and via sand transported on their skin. this suggests that recreational beaches may be potential exposure and transmission pathways for s. aureus . the authors hypothesize that the low background levels of mssa in the off shore water was due to the residual effects from bather swimming activities from normal beach use given the potential persistence of these organisms in seawater  <cit> . these background levels, however, were very low in comparison to those levels observed during the small and large pool studies .

the average quantities of s. aureus shed in this study were lower than those observed previously by elmir et al.  <cit>  using less stringent identification criteria. in addition to more stringent techniques, the difference in numbers may also be due to the differences in the degree to which the adults in the different studies were colonized by, and therefore shed, s. aureus. the shedding numbers reported above take into account the entire population, which included both those individuals who shed and those who did not shed bacteria. therefore, individuals who participated in the large pool study who were not truly colonized, would not have contributed organisms to the pool water, yet were considered in the overall per person shedding calculations. however, when shedding was evaluated on an individual basis , the number of organisms shed could have been much higher per person if an adult bather in the group happened to have been colonized and was not detected by nares culture. this was the case in the adult group ii where no mssa was isolated from participants directly, but mssa was in the water during cycles  <dig> and  <dig> prior to sand exposure. this difference may also be due to variability of s. aureus shedding among different people depending upon their individual colonization status, body site colonized and quantity of organisms. variable shedding by individuals was observed from the small pool study, where toddler shedding ranged from non-detectable levels up to values above  <dig> cfu/person.

direct shedding of s. aureus from the body can include release from known colonized body areas such as the nares. this was seen when the large pool sample water  was positive for mrsa only when mrsa was found in the anterior nares of participants who bathed in that water; and the majority of these organisms were shown to have the same genetic characteristics as the colonizing mrsa. direct shedding was also observed when the single known nasally colonized toddler shed into the water sample in the small pool study. the results reported here confirm that s. aureus are shed by colonized adults and toddlers into the water column. this is supported by the results from both adults and toddlers in the separate pool studies. in the large pool studies, mssa and mrsa were isolated when the participants were known only to be colonized with mrsa only ; however, although only  <dig> toddler was shown to be colonized by nares sampling method,  <dig> toddlers shed mssa. as a result of these findings, we hypothesize that both adults and toddlers are likely colonized with s. aureus, in particular mssa, in other areas of the body, and that these locations contribute to bacterial shedding when exposed to water. this observation is consistent with clinical observations showing that about one third of mrsa-infected patients were not nasally colonized  <cit> , with alternate colonization sites including skin  <cit>  and throat  <cit> .

both the large pool study and the small pool study demonstrated that sand played a relatively small role in s. aureus shedding. in the small pool study during the single bathing cycle, sand accounted for less than 1% of shedding. elmir et al.  <cit>  also found that sand accounted for roughly  <dig> % of the enterococci contribution in the first bathing cycle for the small pool study. for the large pool study, an increase in s. aureus shedding was observed when participants were exposed to sand between the second and third bathing cycles, but the impacts were less pronounced for s. aureus as compared to enterococci shedding as observed in prior studies  <cit> . increased numbers of s. aureus shed in the third cycle could be associated with sand exposures; however, the ultimate source of the s. aureus in the sand is unknown, and may be associated with naturally existing s. aureus and/or from direct shedding from humans to the sand.

because of the differences in the designs of the large pool study  and the small pool study , direct comparison of the amount of shedding between toddlers and adults in this study is limited. nevertheless, we compared the numbers of s. aureus shed by adult and toddlers, keeping these limitations in mind. the average of s. aureus shed by adults during the four cycles in the large pool  was  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/person, and by toddlers  was  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/person in the small pool. in this comparison, adults shed  <dig> times more s. aureus than toddlers on average . it should be noted that the estimated adult body surface areas based on height and weight  <cit>  were approximately  <dig>  times larger than the toddlers in this study. after normalizing shedding numbers by the body surface factor of  <dig> , the numbers of s. aureus shed by adults were  <dig> times more than toddlers on average . therefore, in this investigation, toddlers in diapers shed fewer organisms than the adults; however, additional studies need to be done under the same conditions to confirm these findings.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study showed that both mssa and mrsa were shed by human populations into marine waters. the amount of shedding varied, was likely dependent upon the level of colonization of the host, and colonization was not limited to the anterior nares. in this study, the shedding of mrsa was directly dependent upon its colonization of the human host. mrsa shedding was observed intermittently, only among group ii adults and water, with the apparent lower number of humans colonized by mrsa relative to mssa. no mrsa was observed in the sand samples as the pediatric populations evaluated in this study were apparently not colonized with mrsa. however, it is highly likely that similar studies with additional pediatric participants would result in the isolation of mrsa  <cit> . future studies should focus on the collection of additional samples from human participants as the current study was limited by the restricted numbers of carriers identified. these future studies should collect samples from the skin and from other areas where s. aureus resides, in addition to samples from the anterior nares.

once s. aureus is released from bathers, its potential for transmission is highly dependent on its persistence in the environment. gregg and lacroix  <cit>  inoculated saltwater pool water with mrsa, and found very low levels after  <dig> hour exposure. they concluded that swimming pool water would not likely put children at risk for acquiring mrsa. however, we argue here that more research is needed to evaluate the risk of illness associated with water exposures and the potential for transmission through sand, including the residency time of these human pathogens in both recreational marine waters and beach sand  <cit> . future research should be conducted with s. aureus species from actively colonized individuals, as the current study found large amounts released from individuals, and the actively growing clinical strains may survive differently in comparison to laboratory grown strains used for inoculation experiments. experimentation should closely control environmental factors as some studies have documented growth of s. aureus under optimal environmental conditions  <cit> .

overall, the results from this study confirmed that both adults and toddlers can be sources of potentially pathogenic mssa and mrsa in recreational marine waters, and support the potential for exposure and transmission of these organisms through the use of recreational beaches. more research is needed to evaluate the persistence of strains released by humans into the water column and the possibility of disease transmission at recreational beach sites.
