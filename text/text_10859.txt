BACKGROUND
kluyveromyces marxianus is a sister species to the better-known k. lactis <cit> . a large number of studies on k. lactis have mainly focused on its lactose metabolism and use as a model for non-conventional yeasts
 <cit> . in contrast, scientific literature about the fundamental aspects of k. marxianus is relatively scarce
 <cit> . recently, k. marxianus has gained increasing attention since some of its traits are desirable for biotechnological applications. these traits include the fastest growth rate of any eukaryotic microbe, thermotolerance, secretion of native enzymes such as inulinase, β-galactosidase and pectinase, and production of ethanol
 <cit> .

k. marxianus is now being investigated as an alternative to saccharomyces cerevisiae for ethanol production, especially in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation  or simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation  processes, since it can produce ethanol at higher temperatures and on a wider variety of substrates including xylose
 <cit> . it has been reported to be able to grow at 45°С and even 52°С and to produce ethanol at temperatures above 40°c
 <cit> . s. cerevisiae, in contrast, is unable to ferment xylose and has an optimum growth temperature ranging from  <dig> to 34°С
 <cit> . the enzymatic hydrolysis during ssf or sscf processes is usually conducted at approximately 50°c, and the products formed during the hydrolysis step in sscf include hexoses and pentoses. the traits of k. marxianus make it suitable for use in sscf processes involving cellulosic biomass
 <cit> .

yeast alcohol dehydrogenase  catalyzes the final metabolic step in ethanol fermentation, and thus plays an important role. the adh systems of s. cerevisiae and k. lactis were studied extensively and seven scadh genes  and four kladh genes  have reportedly been cloned
 <cit> . there are only a few scientific papers on the adh systems of k. marxianus. recently, the complete genome sequence of k. marxianus var. marxianus kctc  <dig> was determined and four adh-encoding genes were annotated in the genome
 <cit> . two genes, kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig>  were cloned from k. marxianus atcc  <dig>  while other two genes, kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig>  were cloned from k. marxianus dmku 3–1042
 <cit> . however, heterologous expression of the four genes and the biochemical properties of the kmadhs have not been reported yet.

the k. marxianus gx-un <dig> strain obtained in our laboratory is an excellent ethanol producer at high temperature and produced 69 g/l of ethanol when fermenting 150 g/l of glucose at 40°c
 <cit> . determining the biochemical characteristics of the adhs of gx-un <dig> will help to explain why it can produce high levels of ethanol at high temperature. in the present study, the genes encoding the four kmadhs of gx-un <dig> were cloned and individually overexpressed in e. coli, and the biochemical characteristics of each purified kmadh were investigated. understanding the biochemical characteristics of the kmadhs of k. marxianus will enhance our fundamental knowledge of the adh systems and the metabolism of ethanol fermentation in k. marxianus.

RESULTS
growth and ethanol fermentation characteristics of k. marxianus gx-un120
k. marxianus gx-un <dig> is an excellent ethanol-producing mutant strain that was converted from the wild-type strain gx- <dig> by alternately treatment with uv irradiation and ntg for two cycles. when fermenting 150 g/l of glucose, the ethanol yield of gx-un <dig> was 69 g/l which was 20% higher than that of gx- <dig>  however, the adh activity of gx-un <dig> was not significantly higher than that of gx-15
 <cit> . the nucleotide sequence of kmadh <dig> in gx-un <dig>  was not different to that in gx- <dig> . the growth and ethanol fermentation characteristics of gx-un <dig> were determined compared with those of s. cerevisiae angel, which is a commercial ethanol producer in china. the optimum temperatures for growth and ethanol fermentation of gx-un <dig> were 35-40°С and 40°С, respectively, whereas that of angel was 28-34°С. gx-un <dig> grew well even at 45°С, whereas angel was not able to grow when the temperature was over 45°С . the time courses for ethanol formation in 150 g/l glucose by gx-un <dig> at 40°С and angel at 34°С are shown in figure 
1c. the time taken for gx-un <dig> to completely consume the glucose and reach its maximum ethanol yield was the same as that for angel. both yeasts consumed the glucose completely within 72 h. at that time the maximum ethanol concentration and ethanol yield coefficient of gx-un <dig> were  <dig>  g/l and  <dig>  g/g, respectively, and those of angel were  <dig>  g/l and  <dig>  g/g, respectively.

analysis of the expression of kmadhs in k. marxianus gx-un120
the translational levels of kmadh genes in gx-un <dig> were determined through the analysis of zymograms of the adh isozymes at different fermentation phases  in ypd containing 150 g/l of glucose . the results indicated that kmadh <dig> was weakly expressed at the lag phase and largely expressed at the exponential phase, and its expression level decreased at the stationary phase. kmadh <dig> was constitutively expressed during all phases. the expression levels of kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> were not detectable.

cloning and sequence analysis of the genes encoding the four kmadhs from k. marxianus gx-un120
the four genes encoding adhs, kmadh <dig>  kmadh <dig>  kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig>  were cloned from gx-un <dig> and sequenced. the open reading frames  of the four adh genes were, respectively,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 1140 bp and the deduced amino acid sequences were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, respectively. the deduced amino acid sequences of the four kmadhs from gx-un <dig> shared 98% to 99% identity with the corresponding four genes of atcc  <dig> and more than 80% identity with the adhs of k. lactis, k. wickerhamii, s. cerevisiae, s. carlsbergensis, s. kluyveri, s. pastorianus and hansenula polymorpha <cit> . there are five amino acid residues difference in the deduced amino acid sequence of kmadh <dig> in gx-un <dig> and kmadh <dig> in atcc  <dig>  they are n15h, g239v, t328s, s334v and i339v. in kmadh <dig>  the different amino acid residues are h315n and i338v. in kmadh <dig>  the different amino acid residues are e233d and q240e. in kmadh <dig>  the different amino acid residues are n268s, v360i and s378a. all these amino acid residues are not in the groups directly involved in catalysis.

the phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequences of the kmadhs and yeast adhs  in figure 
 <dig> reveals that kmadh <dig> of gx-un <dig> is closely grouped with adh <dig> from k. marxianus atcc  <dig>  k. marxianus dmku3- <dig> and k. wickerhamii and adh <dig> from k. lactis, and kmadh <dig> is grouped with adh <dig> from k. marxianus atcc  <dig>  whereas kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> are closely grouped with adh <dig> and adh <dig> from k. marxianus atcc  <dig>  k. marxianus dmku3- <dig>  k. wickerhamii and k. lactis.

the multiple amino acid sequence alignments of kmadhs with adhs from other yeasts  reveal that kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> do not possess but kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> do possess the n-terminal mitochondrion targeting sequence . these results indicate that kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> are cytoplasmic adhs, whereas kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> are mitochondrial adhs. several conserved motifs of the microbial group i adhs were found in the kmadhs, including asp <dig> in kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig>  asp <dig> in kmadh <dig> and asp <dig> in kmadh <dig>  which determine the nad+ specificity. this suggests that kmadhs are nad-dependent adhs similar to the adhs of other yeasts
 <cit> . the nad+-binding motifs of the kmadhs are gag/cgglg , similar to those in adhs of other yeasts
 <cit> . zn2+-binding residues, which are known to be essential for enzyme catalytic activity and structure, and the zn2+-binding consensuses were also found .

expression and purification of the recombinant kmadhs
the four cloned adh genes were expressed in e. coli rosetta de <dig>  the recombinant kmadhs were purified and then digested with enterokinase light chain. a clear, single band for each of the kmadh <dig>  kmadh <dig>  kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> fusion proteins corresponding to about  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 60 kda, respectively, was clearly seen on sds-page . the purified recombinant kmadh <dig>  kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig>  after digestion with enterokinase light chain, had molecular masses corresponding to about  <dig>   <dig> and 49 kda, respectively, as observed by sds-page . the purified recombinant kmadh <dig> had a molecular mass of about 48 kda . the molecular masses of the purified kmadh <dig>  kmadh <dig>  kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig>  as determined by hpgpc, were about  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 200 kda, respectively . these results indicate that each of the four kmadhs of gx-un <dig> is active as a homotetramer.

biochemical characterization of the recombinant kmadhs
the purified recombinant kmadhs without tags were used for the characterization of enzymatic properties. the specific adh activities of kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> were  <dig>  and  <dig>  u/mg for acetaldehyde and  <dig>  and  <dig>  u/mg for ethanol, respectively. those of kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> were, respectively,  <dig>  and  <dig>  u/mg for ethanol and no activities were detected for acetaldehyde. adh activities were investigated with nad+ or nadp+ and nadh or nadph as cofactors to determine cofactor preference. the specific activities of kmadhs with nad+ and nadh were 70– <dig> times and 50– <dig> times higher than those with nadp+ and nadph, respectively. these data indicate that kmadhs prefer nad+ and nadh as cofactor. kmadh <dig> showed activity in the range of ph  <dig> - <dig>  when acetaldehyde was the substrate and ph  <dig> - <dig>  when ethanol was used as the substrate. kmadh <dig>  kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> showed activities in the range of ph  <dig> - <dig> . beyond these ph ranges, the activities of the enzymes were completely lost. the optimum ph of kmadh <dig> was measured as  <dig> , while those of kmadh <dig>  kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> were  <dig>  . kmadh <dig>  kmadh <dig>  kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> were relatively stable at ph  <dig> - <dig> ,  <dig> - <dig> ,  <dig> - <dig>  and  <dig> - <dig> , respectively. they retained more than 60% adh activity when incubated at the corresponding ph ranges for 24 h . kmadh <dig>  kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> showed significant activities between the temperatures of  <dig> and 55°c, while kmadh <dig> showed significant activity between  <dig> and 65°c. the optimum temperatures of kmadh <dig>  kmadh <dig>  kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 45°c, respectively . kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> were relatively stable in the temperature range of  <dig> to 45°c, while kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> were relatively stable at  <dig> to 40°c. the adh activities decreased sharply above 45°c and were completely lost above 60°c .

the kinetic properties of the kmadhs were determined and are summarized in table 
 <dig>  the km values of kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> for ethanol were about 10- and 42-fold higher, respectively, than those for acetaldehyde, while the vmax values for acetaldehyde were about 2- and 12-fold higher, respectively, than those for ethanol. the turnover numbers  of kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> for acetaldehyde were 2- and 12-fold and the catalytic efficiencies  were 20- and 520-fold higher than those for ethanol, respectively. these results indicate that kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> of gx-un <dig> are chiefly responsible for the reduction of acetaldehyde to ethanol. kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> catalyze the oxidation reaction of ethanol to acetaldehyde but not the reduction reaction of acetaldehyde to ethanol.

substrate specificities of the recombinant kmadhs
the substrate specificities of the recombinant kmadhs towards different alcohols with various chain lengths were determined and the results are shown in figure 
7a. all four kmadhs preferred ethanol as the best alcoholic substrate. kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> displayed high activities towards primary 1– <dig> carbon and 1– <dig> carbon alcohols, respectively, and the activities decreased with increasing chain length. both enzymes displayed low or no activity for long chain and branched alcohols. kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> displayed high activities towards ethanol and 1-propanol and low activities for other alcohols. the substrate specificities of the kmadhs towards  <dig> straight- and branched-chain aliphatic aldehydes with various chain lengths and  <dig> aromatic aldehydes were determined and the results are shown in figure 
7b. the highest reducing activities of kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> were found with acetaldehyde. kmadh <dig> displayed high activities towards most of the straight-chain aliphatic aldehydes and low or no activity towards the branched-chain aliphatic aldehydes and aromatic aldehydes. the substrate specificity of kmadh <dig> towards aldehydes was similar to that of kmadh <dig>  but the substrate specificities of these two adhs were different when using butyraldehyde, valeraldehyde, heptaldehyde and phenylacetaldehyde as substrates. regarding kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig>  no activities were detected towards any of the tested aldehydes.

discussion
the mechanism by which k. marxianus produces ethanol at high temperature is unknown as yet. reports about the ethanol metabolic pathway of k. marxianus are rare. in particular, the biochemical characteristics of the adhs from k. marxianus, which contribute to ethanol metabolism, are not understood. the growth and ethanol fermentation characteristics suggest that the fermentation capability of k. marxianus gx-un <dig> at 40°С is the same as that of s. cerevisiae angel at 34°С. in the present study, all four adh-encoding genes of gx-un <dig> were cloned and overexpressed in e. coli. the biochemical characteristics of the purified recombinant kmadhs were investigated. to our knowledge, this is the first report of the heterologous expression of genes encoding the adhs of k. marxianus.

amino acid sequence analysis suggests that kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> of gx-un <dig> may be cytoplasmic adhs, while kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> may be mitochondrial adhs. all four adhs belong to the microbial group i adhs. characterization of their enzymatic properties showed that kmadhs prefer nad+ and nadh to nadp+ and nadph as cofactor, which is similar to adhs of other yeasts
 <cit> . with optimum temperatures of 45-55°c for ethanol and acetaldehyde, the kmadhs are distinctly different from most reported adhs of yeasts, which generally have optimum activities at about 30°c
 <cit> . perhaps this is why gx-un <dig> produces its maximal yield of ethanol at 40°c, while other yeasts such as s. cerevisiae and s. carlsbergensis have maximal yields usually at 30°c
 <cit> .

there have been no previous reports regarding the substrate specificity of adhs from k. marxianus. our data indicate that the four recombinant kmadhs of gx-un <dig> have a narrow alcoholic substrate specificity, which is similar to scadh <dig> of s. cerevisiae. it was reported that the narrow substrate specificity of scadh <dig> is due to met <dig> in its substrate binding cleft, whereas there is a leu in the corresponding position in other yeast adhs including kmadhs
 <cit> . the alcoholic substrate specificity of the kmadhs is similar to that of scadh <dig> but different from that of scadh2
 <cit> . the adhs of k. lactis <cit> , adh <dig> of h. polymorpha <cit> , adhs of c. maltosa <cit>  and adh <dig> of c. utilis <cit>  display broad alcoholic substrate specificity. kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> of gx-un <dig> have a broad substrate specificity for straight-chain aliphatic aldehydes, and the specific activities towards aldehydes are more than 2-fold higher than those towards the analogous alcohols. these results suggest that kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> prefer aldehydes as their substrates and acetaldehyde was the best substrate, which is similar to adh1s from other yeasts and kladh3
 <cit> . interestingly, kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> of gx-un <dig> could efficiently reduce furfural, which is formed in the pretreatment of lignocelluloses and is an inhibitor of ethanol production by s. cerevisiae. this suggests that gx-un <dig> is suitable for use in the sscf of lignocelluloses to produce ethanol.

CONCLUSIONS
zymogram analysis showed that kmadh <dig> was largely induced in k. marxianus gx-un <dig> during ethanol production, kmadh <dig> was constitutively expressed at a lower level and kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> were almost undetectable. the genes encoding the four alcohol dehydrogenases were cloned from strain gx-un <dig> and heterologous expressed in escherichia coli. the biochemical characteristics of the recombinant adhs in this study indicate that kmadh <dig> is the primary adh responsible for the production of ethanol from the reduction of acetaldehyde in k. marxianus. the result that the optimum temperature of kmadh <dig> was 20°c higher than that of adh from s. cerevisiae may partially explain the ability of k. marxianus to produce ethanol at high temperature.
