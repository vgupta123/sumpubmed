BACKGROUND
scrapie, a neurodegenerative disease of domestic sheep , is the prototype transmissible spongiform encephalopathy  of ruminant livestock. the ruminant tses are a family of diverse infectious and possibly sporadic disorders of sheep, cattle, deer, elk, moose, and goats. classical studies in rodent models have demonstrated that the infectious agent is composed primarily of a relatively protease resistant isoform  of the highly conserved mammalian prion protein  encoded by the prnp gene  <cit> . although prpc is a ubiquitously expressed membrane sialoglycoprotein  <cit> , prpsc accumulates on the extracellular membrane and within intracellular compartments of a limited number of cell types. in sheep with late stage classical scrapie, prpsc is detected in neural tissue  <cit> . in preclinically infected sheep, prpsc is detected in the lymphoreticular system  <cit>    <cit>  and in the placenta  <cit> . the infectious agent is found in blood  <cit>  and milk  <cit> , although generally at levels too low for reliable detection by conventional immunoassays  <cit> . ovine scrapie is apparently transmitted by oral or mucosal exposure of lambs to the infectious agent shed in placenta, blood, colostrum or milk during the periparturient period  <cit> .

domestic goats  are susceptible to ovine scrapie under field conditions  <cit>  and a natural case of tse with the biochemical characteristics of bovine spongiform encephalopathy  in a domestic goat has also been reported  <cit> . under experimental conditions, goats are susceptible to several tses including ovine scrapie  <cit> , cervid chronic wasting disease  <cit> , human creutzfeldt jakob disease  <cit>  and bse  <cit> . goats experimentally infected with bse by the intracerebral route developed a tse-like disease but failed to transmit disease to their progeny produced by embryo transfer or natural birth  <cit> . these reports did not address the potential for amplification and transmission of the agent should it occur under natural conditions. although there are few reported cases of caprine scrapie in the united states, the introduction of antemortem diagnosis by peripheral lymphoid tissue biopsy has provided small numbers of naturally infected goats suitable for breeding. this study describes the sparse accumulation of prpsc in shed placentas from the first  <dig> naturally infected breeding does identified by antemortem testing in the us and a 4th infected doe with no antemortem evidence of scrapie.

RESULTS
antemortem and post-mortem scrapie diagnosis
three domestic goats with exposure to ovine or caprine scrapie  were diagnosed with scrapie by antemortem detection of prpsc in a biopsy sample of ramalt using a monoclonal antibody-based immunohistochemistry  assay. a fourth goat  was negative by sequential ramalt biopsy sample analysis at approximately  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> years of age but held for quarantine because she was the progeny of a confirmed case. the  <dig> goats with recorded birthdates  were euthanized with clinical signs of scrapie at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days of age respectively. goat 1/3684c developed clinical signs of scrapie at approximately 3- <dig>  years of age. clinical signs included weight loss, pruritis and incoordination. the diagnosis of scrapie was confirmed by post-mortem examination of the brainstem and lymphoid tissues by immunohistochemistry.

b prnp genotypes included the wild type  allele on a  <dig> s backbone with no other mutations, an allele differing only at codon  <dig>  or an allele on the 240p backbone with a second polymorphism at codon  <dig>  

parturition history
the  <dig> domestic goats held for observation because of a positive prpsc finding on antemortem ramalt assay  or because of exposure to her infected dam at birth  produced viable progeny and shed placentas. for comparison, five sheep with naturally acquired scrapie, originating from flocks unrelated to the infected goat herds, were used as a source of ovine placentas. prnp genotypes, the number of progeny in each birth year, the prnp genotypes of the progeny, and the interval from parturition to euthanasia of the dam with clinical scrapie are shown in table  <dig>  caprine placentas were collected from  <dig> sequential pregnancies in one doe  and from the only live births for the other does. ovine placentas were collected from single pregnancies  or from  <dig> sequential pregnancies .

prnp genotypes of scrapie-positive goats and their progeny
the four scrapie infected breeding goats were homozygous for the wild type  prnp haplotype encoding  <dig> s , homozygous for the alternative central haplotype encoding 240p , or heterozygous for these two haplotypes  . prnp genotypes of the kids included the heterozygous wt/240p genotype , homozygous 240p  and a single kid with the polymorphism at codon  <dig> encoding serine . only one multiple birth resulted in mismatched alleles in placental cotyledons: in her only live kidding, goat 2/3953n produced one homozygous 240p kid and one kid heterozygous at codon  <dig>  .

immunoassays of placental tissue
enzyme linked immunosorbent assay
elisa testing was performed on shed cotyledons using the homogenate from  <dig> mg tissue per well . all  <dig> ovine cotyledons  were positive by this assay, although the samples from one placenta  were notably lower than those from the other placentas. in contrast, only 7/ <dig> cotyledons collected from  <dig> of the  <dig> caprine placentas  had prpsc detectable with this assay. two fold serial dilutions of caprine cotyledon homogenate  showed that the assay was linear  over a range of  <dig>  to  <dig> mg starting wet weight . based on this regression curve, the samples from the only other elisa-positive caprine placenta  and the weakly positive ovine placenta  contained approximately  <dig> to  <dig> fold less prpsc when compared to the reference caprine sample. all other ovine samples were positive for prpsc in this assay with a <dig> values higher than that observed with any goat sample . all other caprine samples were considered elisa negative, below the cut-off value for the assay.

ahomogenates of individual cotyledons were precipitated with phosphotungstic acid and analyzed by western blot using a combination of mab f99/ <dig> . <dig> and p <dig> 

bone section each from the cotyledons with prpsc immunolabeling was evaluated for the percentage of low power  fields with prpsc labelling and considered to have an abundance of  <dig> if no fields were positive, + <dig> if 10% or fewer of the fields were prpsc positive, + <dig> if 11-25% were positive, + <dig> if 26-50% were positive, + <dig> if  <dig> = 75% were positive, and + <dig> if >76% were positive.

cmean  values for homogenates of cotyledons , each tested in triplicate. values below the cut-off limit for the assay are considered negative and not shown.

phosphotungstic acid-western blot  analysis
paired samples of shed antemortem cotyledons and brain collected subsequently at necropsy from individual sheep and goats were prepared for western blot analysis following enrichment for prpsc using pta precipitation. representative data are shown in figure  <dig>  caprine and ovine brain  had a slightly reduced migration rate compared to caprine and ovine cotyledons  as reported previously for sheep  <cit> . brain and placenta from scrapie negative goats showed no banding .

using starting wet weight equivalents of  <dig> mg per lane, prpsc was detected in all samples of ovine cotyledons examined by double antibody pta-wb analysis. prpsc was detected in 18/ <dig> shed cotyledons from goats, with 4/ <dig> placentas or placental horns containing at least one prpsc positive cotyledon . the only samples with no detectable prpsc were the cotyledons from one horn of the uterus from the twin pregnancy of g2/3953n: 6/ <dig> samples genotyped as 240p/240p were positive and 0/ <dig> genotyped as 240p/146s240p were negative.

immunohistochemistry analysis of placental tissue
shed cotyledons
ihc was performed on single sections from each of multiple  shed cotyledons from sheep and goats . all sections of ovine cotyledon contained punctate and granular immunolabeling  ranging from small scattered patches to areas in which most of the cells in each 10x field were considered prpsc positive. immunolabeled cells had the morphology of trophoblasts or remnants of multinucleated trophoblasts as well as fibrinoid material characteristic of placental villi. immunolabeling characteristics in caprine cotyledons  were similar to that seen in sheep, although the size of the immunolabeled plaques was generally smaller and more sparsely distributed. no immunolabeling was detected in placentomes from scrapie negative goats and sheep  or from samples from positive goats or sheep in which the primary anti-prp antibody was replaced by an isotype control antibody .

all shed cotyledons from sheep had detectable immunolabeling . immunolabeling of caprine placentas was more variable, ranging from 90-100% of the sections examined in  <dig> placentas  to 10-30% in the other  <dig> placentas). the only placenta or placental horn with no evidence of prpsc detected by ihc in any of the shed cotyledons examined was from the 240p/146s240p twin  from goat 2/3953n; 0/ <dig> cotyledons of this genotype were ihc positive and 2/ <dig> cotyledons from the 240p/240p twin  were positive.

relative abundance of prpsc in the shed cotyledons was estimated from the percentage of low power  fields containing prpsc ihc-immunolabeling . abundance of prpsc detected by this method was variable in sheep:  <dig> samples were scored + <dig>  and the remaining samples were considered + <dig> . caprine samples were uniformly low in abundance; one placenta was considered + <dig>  and the other sections with immunolabeling were considered + <dig> 

cellular distribution of prpsc in intact placentomes
cellular localization of prpsc in the intact placentomes, containing both maternal and fetal tissue, was evaluated by ihc using placentomes collected at necropsy from goat 2/3953n at approximately  <dig> days gestation and placentomes from  <dig> scrapie infected sheep at a similar stage of pregnancy. prpsc deposits were sparse in the caprine tissue but showed a distribution similar to that in ovine placenta. prpsc immunolabeling was observed in uninucleated cells identified as trophoblasts by double immunolabeling with anti-pan cytokeratin and in adjacent multinucleated cells in the ovine  and caprine  placentomes.

discussion
transmission of the ovine scrapie agent during or shortly after parturition was suggested by early studies  <cit>  and evidence for the infectious agent and prpsc in placental tissue is now well established  <cit> . prpsc accumulation occurs early in pregnancy  <cit>  and levels rise through the first 90- <dig> days of the  <dig> day ovine pregnancy. prpsc is found in association with cells identified as uni- and multinucleated trophoblasts by morphology  <cit>  and cytokeratin immunolabeling  <cit> . prpsc immunolabeling is found occasionally in maternal caruncular endometrial cells, often in close contact with immunolabeled trophoblasts  <cit> . although shedding of the agent into the lambing environment through placental tissue is a likely source of transmission, contamination of the maternal wool and udder by the dam's blood  <cit>  may represent a risk for the newborn lamb in its early ineffectual search for colostrum. in addition, there is evidence for transmission by milk collected from some scrapie infected sheep  <cit> . transmission of caprine scrapie is less well defined. experimental transmission of ovine scrapie to goats by oral feeding with placenta was reported in early experimental trials  <cit>  but the results of reciprocal experiments are not reported. although several large scale studies of the distribution and characterization of prpsc in goats have been described  <cit> , placentas were not examined in those studies.

in this study, prpsc was detected in all shed cotyledons examined from 7/ <dig> ovine placentas using elisa, ihc and pta-wb assays. prpsc was detected in at least one cotyledon from each of  <dig> caprine placentas. the percentage of prpsc-positive cotyledons and the relative abundance of prpsc estimated by ihc or elisa were generally lower in goats than in sheep, although considerable variation was observed in both species. there was some discordance among test formats. elisa testing using a commercial kit manufactured for lymphoid tissue showed a slightly lower sensitivity than pta-wb or ihc, possibly because prpsc is distributed sparsely in the caprine tissue and may not have been present in the  <dig> mg samples tested in each well. pta-wb has the advantage of a larger starting sample size  and detection with a combination of two antibodies . although ihc was performed with a single antibody , examination of a number of cotyledons was sufficient to identify positive placentas.

only one set of caprine cotyledonary samples was negative on all assays; these samples were from a fetus heterozygous for the prnp allele encoding  <dig> s on a 240p background. placental accumulation of prpsc in sheep is limited by the effect of fetal genotype  <cit>  because the fetal trophoblast is a major site of prpsc conversion or accumulation in the placenta. the highly resistant ovine prnp allele encoding arginine  at residue  <dig> is associated with lack of detectable prpsc in the placentomes of ovine fetuses  <cit> . likewise, prpsc was not detected in placentomes from fetuses with a dimorphism at prnp codon  <dig>  reported to confer resistance to classical scrapie, or at codon  <dig>  associated with susceptibility to classical scrapie although with a prolonged incubation time  <cit> . the lack of prpsc in the cotyledons with prnp genotype 240p/146s240p is consistent with the field observations on relative resistance to scrapie in goats with this prnp genotype  <cit> . determining the effect of fetal genotype on prpsc accumulation in the placentas of goats will be complicated by the large of number of caprine prnp alleles on a dual wild type background  <cit> .

the effect of the origin of the scrapie agent remains to be determined. in this study, herd  <dig> co-mingled scrapie infected sheep with goats. in herd  <dig>  sheep had not been housed with goats for several years before the index case was diagnosed and therefore direct sheep to goat transmission is an unlikely source of the agent in this herd. biochemical or bioassay tests to differentiate between scrapie of caprine or ovine origin will be useful in examining the effect of agent source on clinical outcome and transmission efficiency.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, prpsc was detected in some but not all placentomes from naturally infected goats using a sensitive western blot assay. prpsc detectable by ihc was sparsely distributed in caprine cotyledons and elisa values were lower than observed with most ovine cotyledons. in spite of the poorly defined effects of prnp genetics, scrapie strain, dose, route and source of infection, the caprine placenta may represent a source of infection to progeny and herd mates as well as a source of persistent environmental contamination. caprine scrapie is rarely reported in the us and additional studies using experimentally infected goats may be useful in determining the role of the placenta in transmission of caprine scrapie.
