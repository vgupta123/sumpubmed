BACKGROUND
sex determination in mammals occurs through inheritance of the x or y sex chromosome from the parents. in mice, the presence of the male-determining sry gene directs the undifferentiated gonad to develop into a testis by promoting the expression of sox <dig> and fgf <dig> <cit> . early ovarian development has long been thought of as a default pathway switched on passively by the absence of sry gene. recent genetic and transcriptomic studies challenge this view and show that two master pathways simultaneously repress male-specific genes and activate female-specific genetic cascades. this antagonistic action is maintained from embryonic stages to adulthood  <cit> . several reports revealed that a foxl2-leading pathway and rspo1-activating signaling pathway act independently and complementary to each other to promote ovarian development  <cit> .

studies suggest that all four members of the rspo family play a key role in embryogenesis, development and tumorigenesis. the mammalian rspo family is comprised of  <dig> members  with a similar domain organization and regulates the wnt signaling pathway via a common mechanism  <cit> . r-spondins function as ligands of the orphan receptors lgr <dig> and lgr <dig> to regulate wnt/β-catenin signaling  <cit> . disruption of the human rspo <dig> gene in a recessive syndrome was characterized by xx sex reversal, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and a predisposition to squamous cell carcinoma of the skin  <cit> . additionally, rspo <dig> was also demonstrated as a potent and specific mitogen for the gastrointestinal epithelium, in order to promote the proliferation of intestinal crypt cells  <cit> . rspo <dig> also appears to play an essential role in muscle development in both mouse and xenopus embryos  <cit> . since rspo <dig> mice exhibited midfacial skeletal defects, lim loss and lung hypoplasia, it might be indicated that rspo <dig> regulates midfacial, limb, and lung morphogenesis during development through the wnt/β-catenin signaling  <cit> . mutation of the rspo <dig> gene resulted in the formation of short hair on the head, face, and lower legs in the portuguese water dog  <cit> . knockdown of rspo <dig> in xenopus embryos induces vascular defects suggesting its key role in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. targeted disruption of mouse rspo <dig> leads to embryonic lethality caused by vascular defects and remodeling of the vascular plexus in the placenta or impaired formation of the labyrinthine layer of the placenta  <cit> . congenital mutations in rspo <dig> resulted in anonychia with the absence of all fingernails and toenails in humans, and rspo <dig> mutations preferentially clustered in the furin-like cysteine-rich domains  <cit> .

recently, much attention has been paid to the role of the rspo1-activating signaling pathway in the reproductive system, especially in early sex determination and differentiation. in vertebrates, rspo <dig> displays a conserved, female-specific increase in expression in several species  <cit> . investigations in mammalian species have demonstrated that rspo <dig> is postulated to switch on ovarian determination and differentiation by synergizing with specific wnt ligands to stabilize the intracellular canonical β-catenin signaling pathway, which in turn activates ovarian differentiating genes in the bipotential gonad  <cit> . mutations of rspo <dig> in humans induce testis formation and male development in xx individuals, in the absence of sry <cit> . in the mouse, ovarian differentiation requires activation of the rspo1/wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in both somatic cells and germ cells. in rspo1−/− xx gonads, severe impairments i.e. germ cell proliferation, expression of the early meiotic marker stra <dig> and entry into meiosis were observed. the author proposed that rspo1/β-catenin signaling is involved in meiosis in fetal germ cells and contributes to the cellular decision of germ cells to differentiate into oocytes or sperms  <cit> . in the goat gonads, both rspo <dig> and  <dig> showed a female-specific expressional profile from  <dig> day post coitus  to adulthood. therefore, goat rspo <dig> was correlated with germ line cell differentiation before and during meiosis, while rspo <dig> was considered as a candidate gene for ovarian differentiation. goat rspo <dig> was also specifically expressed in both the xx female gonad from  <dig> to  <dig> dpc, although only very faintly. however, rspo <dig> was equally expressed in xx and xy gonads  <cit> . except for goat, the expression and potential roles of all rspo family members in other vertebrates are largely unknown.

medaka has been used as an ideal model to study sex determination and differentiation with xx-xy genetic system and small genome  <cit> . dmy/dmrt1b has been identified as the male sex determining gene of medaka, which initiates the development of testes in xy males by inhibiting male primordial germ cell  proliferation at the sex-determining stage  <cit> . conversely, it is well accepted that estrogen is essential for ovarian differentiation and maintenance in female fish  <cit> . it was well documented that estrogen is necessary for the maintenance of rspo <dig> expression in a direct or indirect manner in oviparous species  <cit> . recent studies revealed that wnt signaling is implicated in multiple processes of male and female gonadal development in rainbow trout  <cit> . therefore, it is essential and critical to explore whether rspo/wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays a key role in fish sex determination and differentiation, just like its role in mammals. in this study, we investigated the temporal and spatial expression profiles of rspo <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the gonads during early ontogenic stages, meanwhile their expression profiles by steroid treatment were also examined. to our knowledge, this is the first report that rspo family members might be critical for ovarian differentiation and maintenance in fish.

RESULTS
sequence analysis
in this study, three rspo genes were cloned in medaka. the orf of rspo <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> contained  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp encoding  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> amino acids , respectively. sequence analysis revealed that medaka rspo <dig> displayed higher identity to tilapia  and zebrafish  than its mammalian counterpart i.e. human , mouse , chicken . the putative amino acid sequence of medaka rspo <dig> also revealed higher similarity to zebrafish  than human , mouse , chicken  and xenopus . however, the deduced amino acid sequence of medaka rspo <dig> showed relative lower homology to zebrafish , human , mouse , chicken , and xenopus  rspo <dig> 

similar to mammalian species, medaka rspo <dig> and  <dig> contain five exons by a structural analysis. however, fish rspo <dig> from medaka and zebrafish includes  <dig> exons. three fish rspo family proteins share substantial structural homology and possess one signal peptide at the n-terminal, two or three conserved cystine-rich furin-like domains  and a thromobospondin- <dig> domain  . the c-terminal sequences of the three rspo proteins were found to be less conservative.


phylogenetic analysis
to understand the phylogenetic relationship of rspo family members among vertebrates, a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the amino acid sequences of rspo <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> from different species . phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that rspo <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> from medaka along with their mammalian counterparts were clustered into three distinct clads. however, rspo <dig> couldn’t be isolated from the available genome dna databases in fish.


tissue distribution
various tissues were collected from adult medaka for rna extraction and cdna synthesis which was used as templates for real time pcr analysis. the tissue distribution analysis revealed that rspo <dig> and  <dig> were ubiquitously expressed in the brain, liver, heart, intestine, kidney, ovary and testis, with dominant expression in the brain, liver and ovary. rspo <dig> was expressed at almost the same level in all the checked tissues except testis. the mrna levels of rspo <dig> and  <dig> were much higher than that of rspo <dig> in gonads. importantly, sexually dimorphic expression profiles of these genes were found in the gonads with much higher levels in the ovary than in the testis .


ontogenic expression of rspo <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> by real-time pcr
in medaka, the first morphological sex difference manifested in the gonads reflects that the female-specific germ cell proliferation starts from stage  <dig> before hatching  <cit> . a real-time pcr analysis was carried out to investigate the expression profiles of three rspo genes during the critical period of sex determination/differentiation . intriguingly, female-specific increase in rspo <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> expression profiles were detected at s <dig> and s <dig> when the first morphological sexual differentiation occurs in medaka, while it was decreased from 0dah. in contrast, in males, the expression of all three rspo genes remained at a much lower level during those stages.


expression of rspo <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the gonads by ish
ish analysis revealed that three rspo genes were abundant in the ovary, but barely detectable in the testis. single-color ish analysis showed that both rspo <dig> and  <dig> were predominantly expressed in the germ cells and germ cell surrounding cells at s <dig> and 0dah . later on, their expressions were restricted to the cytoplasm of oogonia, oocytes, primary oocytes and cortical-alveolar stage oocytes from 30dah to adulthood. however, they were not found in late cortical-alveolar stage oocytes, vitellogenic stage oocytes, or the follicular cell layer. the expression of rspo <dig> in xx female gonads could be detected in the adult stage , but was barely detectable during the early ontogenic stages by ish .


fluorescence multi-color ish analysis demonstrated that rspo <dig> was expressed both in the germ cell  and somatic cell surrounding the germ cell  at 10dah . the expression of fish rspo genes was not detected in the somatic cell by traditional ish method, which might due to their low expression in the somatic cell surrounding the germ cells.


effect of steroid treatment on the expression of rspo <dig>   <dig> and 3
at 0dah, treatment with ee <dig> significantly increased the expression of rspo <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in xy embryos, but levels were much lower than their expression level in control xx embryos . moreover, treatment of adult xy fish with ee <dig> caused significant enhancement of rspo <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> expressions comparing with normal xx female levels . ish revealed that rspo <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were up-regulated in the ee <dig> treated xy gonad at s <dig>  0dah and adult stage .


discussion
three members of the rspo family were cloned and characterized from a teleost fish, medaka. interestingly, medaka rspo <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> showed a sexually dimorphic expression profile with female-specific up-regulation during the critical period of sex determination and differentiation and later developmental stage. thus, the abundant expression of these three rspo genes in the female gonad indicated that rspo-activating pathway might be required for ovarian differentiation and maintenance in fish.

in vertebrates, rspo <dig> displayed a female-specific increase in the gonads of humans, mice, goats, chickens and reptiles during the critical period of sex determination/differentiation  <cit> . to date, the expression of rspo <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> had merely been identified in goats. it has been reported that goat rspo <dig> was expressed with a female-specific profile from the crucial stage of sex determination until adulthood. however, goat rspo <dig> was expressed equally in females and males  <cit> . in medaka, it has been shown that sex determination occurred around stage  <dig> before hatching  <cit> . at this stage, other than the germ cell markers in females, as well as dmy and gsdf in males, all known genes have been shown to be expressed without any sexual dimorphism at this stage  <cit> . our real-time pcr results demonstrated that medaka rspo <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> expression was specifically up-regulated from s <dig> along with the expression of a germ cell marker  and meiosis marker  in the female gonads. a previous report demonstrated that rspo1/β-catenin signaling is involved in meiosis in fetal germ cells and contributes to the cellular decision of germ cells to differentiate into oocytes or sperms  <cit> . the expression profiles of medaka rspo <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> during the early sex determination/differentiation stages imply that rspo signaling might be also required to initiate meiosis in the germ cells of medaka. therefore, the female-specific expression of the three rspo genes in medaka suggests that they lie upstream in the genetic cascade of female sex determination and differentiation in teleosts.

the sub-cellular distribution of rspo <dig> protein during the critical period of sex determination has been well investigated in mice, goats and chickens. in the e <dig>  female mouse gonad, the protein was mainly located in germ cells and somatic cells. in the e <dig>  chicken ovary, it was widely expressed in the cytoplasm and on the cell surface in the outer cortical zone including both germ and somatic cells, just prior to the onset of meiosis  <cit> . in goat, the protein was detected around both somatic and germinal cells in the cortical area as early as 36-40dpc. at 50dpc, the strongest rspo1-specific signal was found around the germ cells in goats  <cit> . our multi-color ish data revealed that medaka rspo <dig> mrna was expressed in both somatic cells  and germ cells  in the early stages of sex determination . however, strong expression of rspo <dig> was only detected in the cytoplasm of oocytes at a much later stage. additionally, up to now, no reports are available on the cellular distribution of rspo <dig> and  <dig> in vertebrates. in this study, both rspo <dig> and rspo <dig> showed the same expression profiles as rspo <dig> in the gonads during different ontogenic stages in the ish analysis. concisely, the female-specific expression profile in the somatic  cells and germ cells during early sexual differentiation suggests a possible role of fish rspo proteins in both folliculogenesis and development of germ cells.

the role of germ cells in sex determination and differentiation differs between mammals and fish. in mammalian species, the presence of pgc doesn’t play an important role in somatic sexual differentiation. unidirectional signaling from the soma to germ cells has been found to be important for sex determination and differentiation  <cit> . in fish, previous reports showed that gonadal somatic cells are predisposed to male development in a cell-autonomous fashion. therefore, in medaka, germ-cell-deficient adults displayed a female-to-male secondary sex reversal phenotype  <cit> . similarly, the ablation of germ cells resulted in the generation of sterile males, indicating that the germ cell line is essential for the development of female zebrafish  <cit> . therefore, germ cells are necessary for sexual dimorphism and sex differentiation in fish. in this study, the presence of rspo protein in both somatic and germ cells in the developing ovary indicated its essential role in fish sexuality.

estrogens play a pivotal role in ovarian differentiation and maintenance in non-eutherian vertebrates. recent reports revealed that foxl <dig> plays a decisive role in ovarian differentiation by regulating aromatase expression and possibly the entire estrogen pathway in teleosts  <cit> . foxl <dig> and rspo <dig> double knockout resulted in sex reversal in xx mice  <cit> . in chicken, treatment with an aromatase inhibitor  reduced the expression of rspo <dig>  in the present study, the expression profiles of rspo1- <dig> in gonads were remarkably enhanced during a short period of exposure to estrogen, in both 0dah and adult xy medaka. this result further strengthens the idea that estrogen could induce the activation of rspo signaling pathway which is required for ovarian development in xy sex reversal females treated with ee <dig>  evidence in mice and humans suggests that the canonical wnt signaling pathway promotes ovarian fate and blocks testis development. duplication of the distal portion of chromosome 1p, which includes both wnt <dig> and rspo <dig>  overrides the male program and causes male-to-female sex reversal in xy patients. ectopical expression of β-catenin in the somatic cells of xy gonads disrupts the male program and results in male-to-female sex-reversal  <cit> . our preliminary studies showed that over-expression of rspo <dig> in xy medaka disrupts male development, and induces ovarian development . therefore, we hypothesized that like in mammals, the proper development of ovaries requires the interaction and complement of rspo-activating signaling pathway and foxl2-leading estrogen producing pathway. however, further investigation is required to test this presumption.

CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that the rspo-activating signaling pathway is involved in the ovarian differentiation and maintenance in medaka. our data also support that estrogen producing pathway and rspo-activating signaling pathway might be complementary in female sex determination/differentiation in fish.
