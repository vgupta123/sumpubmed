BACKGROUND
the callipyge phenotype is a muscular hypertrophy that is exclusively expressed by heterozygous sheep inheriting the clpg mutation from their sire . this non-mendelian mode of inheritance with parent-of-origin effect is referred to as polar overdominance  <cit> . the underlying increase in the proportion and size of fast twitch muscle fibers is thought to be caused by ectopic expression of dlk <dig> and/or peg <dig>  protein in skeletal muscle of + 
mat/clpgpat animals. this ectopic expression results from the inactivation – by the clpg a to g point mutation – of a muscle-specific silencer element that post-natally downregulates the expression of dlk <dig> and peg <dig> in cis
. clpgmat/+pat animals do not express the phenotype because dlk <dig> and peg <dig> genes are imprinted and only expressed from the paternal allele. it is thought that clpg/clpg animals do not express the phenotype because of the additional ectopic expression of non-coding rnas  that are  imprinted and expressed from the maternal allele,  controlled in cis by the same muscle-specific silencer element, and  post-transcriptionally down-regulating dlk <dig> and peg <dig> in trans
 <cit> . maternally expressed ncrna genes in the clpg locus include four long ncrnas   as well as  <dig> and  <dig> embedded mirnas and c/d snornas, respectively . for peg <dig> the trans-inhibition results from rna-induced silencing complex -mediated cleavage of peg <dig> transcripts by at least three perfectly complementary mirnas processed from the maternally expressed anti-peg <dig> lncrna  <cit> . for dlk <dig>  the mechanism of the trans-inhibition remains unknown. the present working model for the callipyge phenomenology is summarized in additional file 1: figure s <dig> 

when compared to + 
mat/clpgpat animals, dlk <dig> levels in clpg/clpg animals are more severely reduced at the protein  than at the mrna  level  <cit> . this pattern is compatible with a mirna-mediated effect that would affect mrna stability and translation. it made the abundant mirnas from the dlk1-gtl <dig> domain prime candidate mediators of the observed trans-inhibition. however, bioinformatic analyses did not reveal a striking affinity of any of these mirnas for dlk <dig>  at best, there was some evidence suggesting that they might have an unusual affinity for the open reading frame  of dlk <dig> when assumed to act jointly as a team  <cit> . as bioinformatic target predictions reputably have limited sensitivity and specificity, we wanted to experimentally evaluate the effect of the mirnas from the dlk1-gtl <dig> domain on ovine dlk <dig> 

RESULTS
given the prior evidence that  the mirna from the dlk1-gtl <dig> domain might target the orf of dlk <dig> rather than its 3’ untranslated region   <cit> , and  that their effect might be more pronounced on protein than mrna concentrations  <cit> , we decided to develop a reporter assay that would  express full-length ovine dlk <dig> transcripts including 5’ utr, orf and 3’ utr, and  assay protein rather than mrna levels. we first performed 5’ and 3’ rapid amplification of cdna ends  experiments using rna from sheep skeletal muscle to accurately map the predominant transcription start and poly-adenylation sites of dlk <dig> . we then assembled a  <dig> -bp fragment corresponding to 209-bp of ovine upstream sequence , 954-bp of orf corresponding to the ovine dlk <dig> c <dig> isoform appended with a 9-residue human influenza haemagglutinin  carboxyterminal tag, and 242-bp of downstream sequences including an xhoi restriction site  and the 236-bp ovine dlk <dig> 3’ utr . we selected the c <dig> isoform of dlk <dig> as  it is at least  <dig> times more abundant than the a isoform in ovine skeletal muscle between - <dig> and + <dig> weeks relative to birth, and  the ratio of the transcript levels of the c <dig> and a isoforms is not affected by clpg genotype  <cit> . the ha tag was introduced because available anti-human dlk <dig> antibodies did not effectively recognize ovine dlk <dig> . the corresponding fragment was cloned in a slightly modified pcdna <dig>  vector, 1-bp downstream of the vector-specific transcriptional start site and 30-bp upstream of the vector-specific bovine growth hormone polyadenylation site. the resulting construct  was completely sequenced to confirm its integrity. it was shown, upon transfection in cos <dig> cells,  to generate a transcript of expected size  ,  bounded by the vector-specific transcription start and polyadenylation sites  , and  producing a protein of expected size recognized by anti-ha antibodies  . within the examined range, dlk <dig> amounts estimated by phosphorimaging and densitometry increased linearly with loaded quantities  .

we designed  <dig> mimic mirnas, corresponding to one or two isomirs for  <dig> of the  <dig> mirna species from the dlk1-gtl <dig> domain detected in ovine muscle  <cit>  . in addition, we designed one perfectly complementary anti-dlk <dig> sirna as positive control and two mirnas, corresponding to scrambled mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  as negative controls .

we transfected cos <dig> cells with a mixture of dlk1-expressing p <dig> m-dlk1-ha vector, gfp-expressing pcdna3-gfp vector , and individual mimic mirna . we performed ≥ <dig> independent transfections for each mirna, and ran ≥ <dig> independent western blot experiments per transfection, yielding an average of  <dig>  usable measures per mirna. dlk <dig> amounts, estimated by densitometry, were normalized to gfp amounts as detailed in methods .figure  <dig> 
experimental evaluation of the effect of microrna from the callipyge locus on dlk <dig> expression.  overview of experimental procedure of ovine dlk <dig> reporter assay. we co-transfected cos <dig> cells with a mixture of ovine full-length  dlk1-expressing vector , gfp-expressing vector  for normalizing transfection efficiency and gel-loaded protein amount, and one of  <dig> mimic mirna candidates from the dlk1-gtl <dig> imprinted domain, two negative controls , and one sirna targeting the dlk <dig> orf as positive control. to facilitate protein quantification, an ha epitope was engineered at the carboxyterminal end of dlk <dig>  amounts of dlk <dig>  gfp, and endogenous tubulin were estimated by dual fluorescent western blot . effect of each mirna on dlk <dig> translation was estimated by normalizing dlk <dig> with either gfp or tubulin amounts .  distribution of effects of the  <dig> mimic mirnas on dlk <dig> protein amounts. effects are expressed as fold difference with respect to the overall  mean. the effects of two negative  and one positive  controls are shown, as are the effects of the most inhibiting mir-329a-3p, the closely related mir-329b-3p, and the most activating mir-376a-5p and mir-432-3p. gfp was used for normalization.  evaluation of synergistic action of multiple mirna on dlk <dig> amount. we selected seven mirnas consistently showing inhibiting, activating, and neutral effects on dlk <dig> amount. cos <dig> cells were co-transfected with the p <dig> m-dlk1-ha and pcdna3-gfp vectors along with either a mixture of the seven mirnas , or a single mirna having shown the lowest  or highest  corrected dlk <dig> amount upon transfection in each group. dlk1-ha and gfp protein levels were estimated by dual fluorescent wb analysis . means of corrected dlk <dig> amounts with standard deviations for four independent experiments are shown .



as expected , the sirna positive control exhibited a strong inhibitory effect. it behaved as a complete outlier, reducing the amount of dlk1 ~ 3-fold when compared to the average of the two negative controls, and this effect was highly significant  . seven of the  <dig> tested mirnas significantly  altered dlk <dig> levels when compared to the average of the negative controls. one of these caused a reduction in dlk <dig> levels , while the remaining six increased amounts of dlk <dig> . overall, the  <dig> mirnas and the two negative controls appeared to belong to one population . accordingly, when compared to the average of all mirnas , one mirna significantly decreased dlk <dig> levels , and two significantly increased dlk <dig> levels . mir-329b-3p, which differs from mir-329a-3p at only two residues near the 3’ end, reduced dlk <dig> amounts  <dig> -fold when compared to the overall average, but this was not significant when accounting for multiple testing . mir-329a-3p and mir-329b-3p have two 6-mer matches in the orf and one in the 3’ utr. however, neither of these is evolutionary conserved . mir-329a-3p and mir-329b-3p accounted respectively for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of mirna molecules derived from the dlk1-gtl <dig> domain and  <dig> % and  <dig> % of total mirna molecules in skeletal muscle of clpg/clpg animals  <cit> . it is also noteworthy that we did not observe a convincing correlation between effect on dlk <dig> levels and bioinformatically predicted affinity for dlk <dig>  whether using seed-based scores  <cit>  or miranda  <cit> , and whether considering the 3’ utr, the orf, the 5’ utr or the full-length dlk <dig> transcript .

taken together, these data suggest that none of the tested mirnas effectively regulates dlk <dig>  although the effect of mir-329a-3p is significant, we consider the evidence insufficient to claim that it is biologically relevant. indeed,  the effects of the  <dig> tested mirnas are approximately normally distributed, encompass the effects of the two negative controls, and are not correlated with predicted affinity for dlk <dig>   there are more mirnas that have a significant positive effect than mirnas that have a negative effect on dlk <dig> expression ,  the effect of mir-329a-3p becomes insignificant when considered jointly with the closely related mir-329b-3p,  the expression level of mir-329a-3p in ovine skeletal muscle is extremely low. what is certain is that none of the tested mirnas is capable – under the utilized conditions - to single-handedly downregulate dlk <dig> to the extent that is observed in vivo in skeletal muscle of clpg/clpg sheep.

it remains possible that the observed trans-inhibition of dlk <dig> results from the synergistic action of multiple mirnas. although we could obviously not test all combinations of mirnas, we transfected cos <dig> cells with pools of seven mirnas chosen  amongst the most inhibiting, and  most activating mirnas. the pools of extremes inhibited, respectively enhanced, dlk <dig> expression to a degree similar to their constituent mirnas, but did not reveal convincing evidence for a synergistic effect .

discussion
the aim of this study was to experimentally verify whether any of the mirnas processed from the ovine dlk1-gtl <dig> domain might post-transcriptionally down-regulate dlk <dig> to a degree that is commensurate with what is observed in skeletal muscle of clpg/clpg sheep. although one mirna  yielded an effect deemed significant even when accounting for multiple testing, it was not considered to be relevant with regards to the trans-inhibition of dlk <dig> in clpg/clpg animals for the reasons given above. of note, when performing anova analysis the “mirna effect”  was highly significant . thus, the effects of at least some mirnas are repeatable despite being modest. this could reflect subtle effects on dlk <dig>  on gfp, or on the cellular machinery.

negative results are in essence uncomfortable to interpret. they may be false negatives because the established reporter assay misses an essential component that is required for the responsible mirnas to exert their effect. mirna-mediated regulation of dlk <dig> may require auxiliary trans-acting factors not expressed in cos <dig> cells. the expressed transcripts corresponded for >93% to the ovine dlk <dig> c <dig> mrna, yet included 36-bases of extra upstream, 33-bases of extra internal , and 30-bases of extra downstream sequence, and these may have affected mirna-target interactions. to discriminate between a mirna-dependent versus independent mechanism, we have conducted immuno-precipitation experiments using antibodies directed against the argonaut components of the risc  <cit> , hoping to show an increase in dlk <dig> co-immunoprecipitation in skeletal muscle of clpg/clpg when compared to + 
mat/clpgpat animals, but have so far failed to obtain convincing results .

alternatively, our results may be true negatives and indicate that the trans-inhibition of dlk <dig> observed in vivo is not a post-transcriptional regulation mediated directly by mirnas processed from the dlk1-gtl <dig> domain. it is worthwhile noting in this regard that, while the larger effect on dlk <dig> protein than on dlk <dig> transcripts is reminiscent of early reports of the modus operandi of the archetypical animal mirna lin- <dig> on its lin- <dig> and lin- <dig> targets in c. elegans, lin-4’s mode of action has since been revisited and shown to be more in line with the canonical one in which mrna destabilization accounts for the major component of repression  <cit> . moreover, the ~3-fold and ~10-fold down-regulation of dlk <dig> observed respectively at the mrna and protein levels in vivo would be rather extreme for mirna-dependent effects  <cit> . alternative hypotheses include a direct post-transcriptional effect of one or several of the maternally expressed lncrnas, or an indirect post-transcriptional effect of anyone of the ncrnas from the domain. as for most lncrnas, little is known about the function of the maternally expressed gtl <dig>  rian and mirg genes. it has been suggested that gtl <dig> recruits polycomb repressive complex  <dig>  to down-regulate the reciprocally imprinted dlk <dig> gene in cis
 <cit> . preliminary results of the co-transfection of cos <dig> cells with p <dig> m-dlk1-ha with a vector expressing the predominant isoform of ovine gtl <dig>  does not support a direct inhibitory trans-effect of gtl <dig> on dlk <dig> expression, on the contrary . the hypothesis of an indirect effect posits that the maternally expressed ncrnas affect targets that do not originate from the dlk1-gtl <dig> locus, and that these in turn affect dlk <dig> expression. such indirect effects may manifest themselves by changes in transcript levels that could be studied by comparing the transcriptome  of clpgmat/+pat with that of +/+ animals, and efforts towards that goal are in progress. along similar lines, bidwell et al.  <cit>  recently showed that muscle of clpg/clpg animals exhibited lower expression of a group of key regulatory genes for muscle development , that might render them less responsive to the hypertrophic stimuli of the paternal allele-specific genes.

the apparently stronger effect on dlk <dig> protein  than on dlk <dig> transcript  level suggests a post-transcriptional mechanism. this hypothesis received considerable support from the demonstration of the risc-mediated cleavage of peg <dig> by mirnas processed from anti-peg11
 <cit> . however, we cannot totally exclude a transcriptional mechanism. it may be worthwhile, in this regard, to perform ribosome profiling  <cit>  experiments to verify whether the predicted translational inhibition of dlk <dig> transcripts in clpg/clpg animals when compared to + 
mat/clpgpat animals is indeed observed. lack of such effect would force us to re-evaluate scenarios involving transcriptional regulation.

more work will be needed to gain a full understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the trans-inhibition of dlk <dig>  which is key element of polar overdominance at the clpg locus.

CONCLUSIONS
contrary to that of peg <dig>  the trans-inhibition of dlk <dig> that is observed in clpg/clpg sheep and lies at the heart of polar overdominance, may not depend on post-transcriptional regulation by mirnas from the dlk1-gtl <dig> domain.
