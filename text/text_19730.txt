BACKGROUND
pten induced putative kinase  <dig> gene  is a serine-threonine kinase directly linked to a recessive form of familial parkinsonism  <cit> . a mutation at the nucleotide binding site within the kinase domain renders the protein unable to protect neuroblastoma cells from apoptosis, whereas over expression of the native peptide protects sh-sy5y cells  <cit> . over expressed tagged pink <dig> localizes to the mitochondria  <cit> , raising the possibility that pink <dig> phosphorylates and regulates proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation or the mitochondrial translocator pore  <cit> , processes linked to neuronal cell death  <cit> . indeed, pink <dig> inhibits mitochondrial cytochrome c release, attenuating the general apoptosis machinery  <cit> , while mitochondrial localization is supported by the existence of an  <dig>  kda mitochondrial import tag  <cit>  and in vitro mitochondrial translocation  <cit> . most recently, gandhi et al.  <cit>  produced evidence that endogenous pink <dig> protein locates to the mitochondrial membranes, while three additional articles highlighted a critical role for pink <dig> in drosophila flight muscle mitochondria  <cit> . a fourth study in drosophila show an antioxidant rescue of neurodegeneration induced by knockdown of pink <dig>  <cit> . it is clear, therefore, that pink <dig> may play a rather central physiological role in neuronal and myocyte energy metabolism, consistent with its abundant expression in mitochondria-rich tissue  <cit>  and consistent with the proposed mitochondrial basis for parkinsonism.

the c-terminal end of the protein regulates pink <dig> kinase activity  <cit> . intriguingly, a predicted novel short splice variant of pink <dig> would translate into a protein sequence which represents the c-terminus portion of the protein. furthermore, a cis-transcribed non-coding natural antisense  originating from the pink <dig> gene locus is predicted from the human est databases  <cit>  and is now, very recently, listed in a natural antisense transcript database  <cit> . according to the available well annotated databases, pink <dig> ncnat is not apparent in other species. the ncnat demonstrates near complete sequence overlap with the short pink <dig> splice variant and only partial overlap with pink <dig>  at the 3'end. widespread expression of natural antisense transcripts  has, in recent times  <cit> , emerged as a potential mechanism for bringing diversity and regulatory complexity to a surprisingly finite human 'protein coding' genome  <cit> . while there are a handful of examples of nat  which negatively regulate protein coding mrna expression  <cit> , few are associated with human disease  <cit>  and none have been shown to directly regulate a cis-transcribed partner in a positive or concordant manner. in addition, despite the annotation of several thousands of ncnat's in mammalian genomes, few have had their role in mammalian biology clarified  <cit> .

greater appreciation of the mechanisms responsible for regulating the pink <dig> gene locus, beyond rare mutations, is of importance for a number of reasons. for example, it is likely that alteration of pink <dig> function, regardless of mechanism, would influence mitochondrial function  <cit> . in addition, as pink <dig> appears to influence mitochondrial membrane potential  <cit>  and mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in many age related diseases  <cit> , studying the regulation of the pink <dig> locus during dynamic in vivo modulation of mitochondrial function is likely to be relevant to human ageing. while it is impossible to study this process in the adult human brain, it is plausible to model gains in mitochondrial function in adult human skeletal muscle  <cit>  and examine the regulation of transcription from the pink <dig> locus. in doing so we reveal direct evidence that there is a discordant transcriptional response between the two coding pink <dig> splice variants, in vivo, during dynamic alterations in mitochondrial function, whereas there is a concordant regulation of short transcript variant of pink <dig>  by a cis-transcribed ncnat  originating from the pink <dig> gene locus. not only do we provide the first direct evidence that a ncnat can positively regulate the abundance of a sense coding transcript in humans under physiological conditions, we also highlight that the complexity of pink <dig> locus regulation is potentially greater in humans than other species.

RESULTS
analysis of the pink <dig> locus
inspection of the pink <dig> locus  revealed a potential for multiple pink <dig> mrna species. in addition to the protein-coding pink <dig> transcript,  <dig>  kb long, the pink <dig> locus encodes a shorter transcript, svpink <dig>  which almost completely overlaps with the 5'end of a cis-transcribed natural antisense transcript, napink <dig> and also overlaps with the 3' portion of the full length pink <dig> transcript. svpink <dig> is  <dig>  kb long and has a unique  <dig> bp within its first exon derived from the neighboring intronic region  <cit> . this pink <dig> splice variant represents the c-terminus portion of the pink <dig> protein. a model of the pink <dig> protein structure was designed using homology modeling   <cit>  where the region colored in grey represents a predicted protein encoded by svpink <dig>  which retains a phospho-threonine binding domain and a significant portion of the protein kinase domain . the  <dig>  kb napink <dig> transcript  is annotated as originating from the 'intergenic' region downstream of the 3' end of the protein coding gene ddost . the predicted 5' end of napink <dig> overlaps with the 3'utr of ddost and this region contains no obvious promoter for napink <dig>  as the napink <dig> transcript appears to be an extension of the ddost transcript, this raises the possibility that the promoter for napink <dig> either resides within ddost or it is regulated by ddost promoter. interestingly, there was no evidence, across seven species, for conservation of napink <dig>  even in the well characterized mouse genome  <cit>  or within a recently released natural antisense transcript database  <cit> .

an alignment of the 5' upstream regions  of pink <dig> in mouse and human indicate a high degree of conservation, implying that pink <dig> transcriptional regulation may be similar across these species. a search for transcription factor binding sites within the pink <dig> 5' region  <cit>  identified pparγ and numerous myogenic transcription factor binding sites , supporting the robust expression of pink <dig> in mitochondria rich striated muscle and the recently demonstrated and devastating impact of loss of pink <dig> expression in drosophila flight muscle  <cit> . we also examined the genomic sequences of ddost and pink <dig> . the intergenic region and the last exons of both pink <dig> and ddost are noticeably less conserved between human and mouse than the rest of the locus , which supports the idea that the region from where the napink <dig> originates, is specific to the human genome. interestingly, ddost encodes the age-r <dig> scavenger receptor, a counter regulatory mechanism for advanced glycation end-product induced oxidative stress  <cit> , with a role in diabetes and ageing, processes clearly relevant to parkinson's disease  <cit> . evidence that this 'intergenic' region between the 3' end of ddost and the 5' end of napink <dig> is subject to post-transcriptional regulation comes from the observation that between the 3' end of ddost and the 5' end of napink <dig>  there are numerous consensus sequences for endogenous microrna's  providing a potential mechanism through which the napink <dig> transcript could be processed from a large combined transcript .

detection of the rna transcripts from the pink <dig> locus
we profiled, using northern blot, a range of neuroblastoma cell lines to look for divergent expression of the pink <dig> related transcripts . although no major differences between the cell lines were detected, we confirmed expression of pink <dig>  and produced the first direct evidence for the existence of napink <dig> . svpink <dig> was clearly of low abundance  specific primer/probe based detection . this transcript was poorly visible by northern blot of total rna, but became clearly detectable when using mrna as the starting material . to confirm the existence of the predicted svpink <dig> transcript, we used 5' rlm race and then cloned and sequenced the product, along with a purchased cdna clone , representing the svpink <dig> genomic location. this strategy enabled rapid verification that we had the correct size of product on an agarose gel , before proceeding with sequencing. in addition we used both random hexamer and oligo d <dig> priming strategies to detect pink <dig>  svpink <dig> and napink <dig> expression in neuroblastoma cell lines using qrt-pcr . detection of identical abundances of svpink <dig> and napink <dig> with both primer strategies indicated that both svpink <dig> and napink <dig> are polyadenylated . all primers and probes used in this study can be found in table  <dig> and there relative location is illustrated in fig. 1a.

in vivo human transcript regulation of the pink <dig> genomic locus
if pink <dig> plays a physiological role in human mitochondria then its expression must be regulated in a manner that is consistent with dynamic changes in mitochondrial function. convincingly, we demonstrate dynamic up-regulation of pink <dig> expression during gain of mitochondrial function . there was also a modest but significant correlation  between the mitochondrial dna  encoded complex i gene, mtnd <dig> expression and pink <dig> mrna. in vivo, svpink <dig> demonstrated a diametrically opposed expression pattern to pink <dig> . this suggests that splicing is somehow influenced by a requirement for pink <dig> within the mitochondria. strikingly, we observed in vivo an extremely robust positive co-expression of svpink <dig> mrna and napink <dig> . thus, the change in svpink <dig> expression was proportional to the change in napink <dig> expression in vivo. moreover, there was also a strong positive covariance within individual human subjects for the changes in svpink <dig> and napink <dig> mrna expression  providing an additional and highly convincing indication that napink <dig> may regulate svpink <dig> abundance in vivo at physiological levels. in stark contrast, pink <dig> does not co-vary with napink <dig> in vivo, while the ratio of pink <dig> to svpink <dig> is associated with the nat expression pattern . hence, only the sense coded mrna that demonstrates near fully complementary overlap with the nat appears co-expressed in vivo. thus we speculate that pink <dig> may play a physiological role in regulating mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation , while svpink <dig>  which is homologous to the c-terminus end of the full-length protein, may regulate pink <dig> kinase function  <cit> .

rnai demonstrates that napink <dig> regulates svpink <dig> abundance
to explore the natural antisense relationship further, we used short interfering rna  directed specifically towards napink <dig> or pink <dig> . targeting of the napink <dig> transcript in neuroblastoma cells had no significant effect on the abundance of the pink <dig> transcript . in stark contrast, svpink <dig> was reduced by 40% following selective knockdown of the cis-encoded antisense transcript napink <dig> . note that we used sirnas that targeted unique, non-overlapping, regions of the  <dig>  kb sequence of napink <dig> . these sirna target an intronic sequence which can be found in the unprocessed svpink <dig> and pink <dig> sequence but which is within the mature napink <dig> mrna sequence. although rnai is supposed to follow an asymmetry rule  <cit>  it is possible that the guide sirna could also direct rnai – against the intronic unprocessed pink <dig> variant. not only do we think this is highly unlikely, but our data directly demonstrate that this does not occur in the present situation as such an action would result in knockdown of both svpink and pink <dig>  and this clearly does not occur . when cdna was synthesized using oligo-d <dig> primers, svpink expression was reduced by ~60% following knockdown of the napink transcript with as sirnas , consistent with data generated using random hexamer priming . in addition, sirna targeting a region on the first exon of pink <dig>  robustly knocked down pink <dig> mrna but this did not significantly alter either svpink <dig> or napink <dig> expression . thus, it appears that when sirna mediated cytosolic knockdown of the polyadenylated napink <dig> transcript occurs, svpink1's abundance is reduced, which in turn strongly supports the above concordant in vivo human interactions between pink <dig> mrna and its ncnat.

discussions and 
CONCLUSIONS
in the present study we demonstrate that a naturally expressed non coding antisense rna and a short splice variant of pink <dig> exist in human neuroblastoma cells and human skeletal muscle tissue. we further demonstrate that this nat regulates the pink <dig> locus in a manner that involves stabilizing, or promotion of, the expression of the pink <dig> splice variant, svpink <dig>  this is the first compelling evidence that an ncnat positively modulates a sense coding rna at levels found in vivo in humans. furthermore, given that svpink <dig> codes for a homologue of the c-terminus of pink1; a peptide sequence which regulates pink <dig> kinase activity  <cit> , then modulation of napink <dig> expression may have direct relevance in parkinson's disease.

teleologically, any process that regulates pink <dig> activity may influence parkinson's disease progression and thus it is important to consider the broader regulation of the pink <dig> locus. the scale of the fantom consortium mammalian antisense transcriptome project  <cit>  enabled robust estimations, using gene ontology based classification scores, of the function of the coding genes which have cis-transcribed associated nats. for convergent nat species, the corresponding coding transcripts were most likely translated into catalytic proteins involved in nucleotide metabolism, while for fully overlapping cis-transcribed nat species, many of the corresponding sense mrnas were translated into a protein with protein binding abilities or kinase activity. these statistical associations are clearly in agreement with the napink <dig> and pink1/svpink <dig> relationships. in the present study we provide robust evidence of regulation by the napink <dig> transcript of the short variant of the parkinson's disease gene, pink <dig>  under conditions where the mrna species do not exceed their natural abundances .

a further point of interest is that the napink <dig> transcript is formed at a region concurrent with the 3' end of the ddost gene. examination reveals no obvious promoter region within the overlapping region that encodes for napink <dig> and the 3'utr of ddost, and so we can speculate that napink <dig> and ddost are transcribed from a common promoter and that napink <dig> is a result of transcription read-through. our northern blot analysis  supports this idea as we found a large transcript  in both the total rna and isolated mrna preparations that could represent a ddost-napink <dig> transcript . it has been postulated that neurodegenerative diseases, such as parkinson's, are associated with oxidative stress  <cit>  and there is further association between metabolic syndrome and neurodegeneration  <cit> . ddost encodes a receptor that mediates suppression of advanced glycation mediated cellular oxidative stress and apoptosis  <cit> . while transcriptional modulation of the ddost gene has not been studied, it's possible that metabolic syndrome induced transcriptional modulation of ddost could subsequently result in altered napink <dig> expression.

we must also ask how napink <dig> is able to 'stabilize' the svpink <dig> transcript. in general, the precise molecular mechanisms through which ncnat leads to the regulation of a sense mrna have not been clarified  <cit> . rna duplex formation leading to rna editing or degradation has been suggested, while antisense induced chromosomal modifications has been demonstrated and result in gene silencing. for example, the murine ncnat air  <cit> , which regulates the maternally expressed igf <dig> receptor gene , highlights a multi-gene interaction and provides a clear indication of the complexity of nat regulated transcription. although only over-lapping igf2r, the paternal antisense transcript air, silences the expression of igf2r, slc22a <dig> and slc22a <dig> through an ill-defined epigenetic modification  <cit> . there are also examples where the antisense transcript regulates transcription , inhibits splicing , transport  or promotes degradation . these examples all involve a reduction in mrna expression  <cit> . a short co-transcribed ncnat from the wt <dig> gene loci has been associated with greater abundance of wt <dig> protein  <cit>  yet in vitro mechanistic studies failed to clarify this effect. in our case, napink <dig> positively regulates the abundance of svpink <dig>  both in vivo and during sirna knockdown experiments and thus we present a novel observation for a ncnat. importantly, we demonstrate that the detectable levels of napink <dig> and svpink <dig> are likely to be mature polyadenylated transcripts and so the strong in vivo association may reflect a cytosolic interaction. insight into the mechanism through which napink <dig> may regulate svpink <dig> also comes from the observation that napink <dig> appears only to influence the abundance of the near full length complementary cis transcribed svpink <dig> sequence  suggesting a potential role for dsrna mediated stabilization. recent data from chloroplasts, involving the mitochondrial atp synthase gene , demonstrated that a chloroplast mutant that produced a complementary coded atpb nat mrna resulted in dsrna formation, which prevented exonuclease mediated degradation of the atpb mrna  <cit> . it is also thought that the degree of rna editing, modulates activity of the rnai pathway, and it is plausible that this might explain the current observations.

it was recently reported that sirna mediated transcript degradation can act in the nucleus of mammals  <cit> , however this was demonstrated using a high concentration of a sirna containing a sequence known to result in off-target effects  <cit> . in our experiments, rnai directed degradation of napink <dig> is most likely to occur in the cytosol, and we clearly demonstrate that this causes a significant reduction of svpink <dig>  one could argue that napink <dig> may influence the splicing of pink <dig> pre-mrna. under this scenario, association between the 5' end of the pink <dig> pre-processed mrna with the natural antisense molecule would somehow favor the alternative splicing process to produce svpink, starting from the intronic region between exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> of pink <dig>  implying that napink <dig> potentially masks a splicing inhibitor site. in agreement with this idea, if one examines the in vivo relationship between the ratio of pink1:svpink <dig> rna then this is also linearly related to the expression level of the napink <dig> . nevertheless, this correlation is driven by the svpink1-napink <dig> relationship and it is clear that pink <dig> itself does not co-vary with the napink <dig> rna under the present experimental conditions . given that we demonstrate that sirna h and i do not target the pre-spliced version of svpink <dig> or pink <dig>  and that is possible that svpink1-napink <dig> relationship reflects alternative splicing, then we have to consider that the synthetic sirna may indeed direct rnai within the nucleus  with a subsequent change in pink <dig> splicing, a consideration that merits more robust investigation.

the regulation of pink <dig> protein expression is likely to be complex, particularly under disease conditions  <cit> . available evidence suggests that the full length protein is processed , resulting in the detection of at least two proteins on a western blot. neither of these proteins is consistent with the predicted size of a svpink <dig> protein . multiple shorter proteins have been found when gst-tagged pink <dig> is over-expressed and detected using an antibody to gst  <cit>  and while others have presented western blots demonstrating a single protein band  <cit> , so far all commercial antibodies that we purchased reproducibly  give rise to > <dig> discrete bands and thus are not reliable when profiling cell models. as more reliable reagents become available  <cit>  it will become important to combine well designed rnai experiments with protein detection, to study the biochemical consequence of loss of pink <dig>  svpink <dig> and napink <dig> in human cells. from a speciation perspective, there is prior evidence that natural antisense rna sequences can be conserved selectively in higher mammals. a cis-transcribed intronic antisense mrna from the fas receptor gene, named saf, alters fas splice variant expression when saf is artificially over-expressed  <cit>  and saf appears only to be conserved in primates. future experiments will also have to address the relative importance of napink and svpink in relation to pink <dig> function. for example, the relative abundance of napink approaches that of pink <dig> in tumor cell lines, while napink <dig> is less abundant, although clearly present in human muscle tissue. ongoing svpink <dig> over-expression studies should resolve the function of svpink <dig>  while we must also decide whether svpink <dig> is a truly independent 'gene' transcribed from within the pink <dig> genomic loci. in addition, given the complexity of defining what merits being called a 'gene' it is reasonable to suggest that a nat, with a proven biological function, should also be considered a gene.

in summary, we produce in vivo human data and supportive rnai data which demonstrates that a non-coding rna so far limited to human expression, appears to 'stabilize' a sense coding rna. while our data is the first evidence that endogenous levels of a non-coding antisense rna influencing a sense coded mrna in a concordant fashion, we can not rule out the possibility that napink <dig> recruits additional cytosolic proteins  <cit>  to bind and stabilize svpink <dig> in a more complex scenario than direct complementary hybridization. given the close genomic association between ddost and napink specifically in the human genome, we speculate that these two disease related genes may be co-regulated, and uniquely so in humans.
