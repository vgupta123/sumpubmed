BACKGROUND
sunflower , 2n = <dig>  belongs to family asteraceae, with an estimated genome size of  <dig> mbp, and is the fourth most important oilseed crop  <cit> . it is a native of north america  <cit>  and widely cultivated in the world with an annual production of about  <dig> million tonnes . the genome size of this crop is large compared to model species like arabidopsis , rice , sorghum , soybean  or tomato  . the major drivers of this large genome size are mainly the recent polyploidization event and the important amplification of transposable elements  <cit> . many wild sunflower species are increasingly used for improvement of cultivated varieties by conventional breeding  <cit> . with continued biased selection of the cultivated sunflower for traits such as yield, many alleles conferring useful traits got lost. therefore a method to create variability for breeding this crop, in this era of increasing global food crisis and changing climatic regimes, is highly desirable. for many decades, plant breeders have concentrated their efforts on improvement of sunflower through traditional breeding and recently, molecular mapping has been successfully undertaken for marker assisted breeding   <cit> . furthermore, chemical mutagenesis has been used by breeders to create variability in crops including sunflower but these have been mostly restricted to dominant traits. therefore, many desirable mutations that are recessive have been missed during selection  <cit> . finally, traits such as oil quality cannot be selected by visual inspection of plants.

sunflower is one of the major oil seed crops grown all over the world and considerable research efforts have been put to understand lipids biosynthesis and modification. this research mainly focused on  the production of more stable sunflower oils for biolubrication  and  the increase of healthy substitutes for food industry  <cit> . the de novo synthesis of fatty acids in plant storage tissues is an intraplastidial process in which the multienzyme fatty acid synthase  complex catalyses a series of enzymatic reactions. in sunflower, the main products of intraplastidial fatty acid synthesis are, first, palmitoyl-acp , which is further elongated by the fas ii complex to produce stearoyl-acp . in turn, this molecule is the substrate for stearoyl-acp desaturase  that introduces a double bond in the carbon chain to produce oleoyl-acp . all of these products can be exported from the plastid after the hydrolysis between the acyl molecule and acp by the acyl-acp thioesterase. two types of acyl-acps thioesterases have been identified in higher plants such as sunflowers: fata and fatb. fata thioesterases preferentially act on long chain fatty acids, and have particularly high specificity for 18:1-acp and a lower affinity for 16:0-acp and 18:0-acp  <cit> . to address the needs of the confectionery industry for saturated fatty acids, high stearic acid content oils have been developed mainly by genetic modification of the fata stearoyl-acp thioesterase and the sad stearoyl-acp desaturase  <cit> . stearic fatty acid is considered cardiovascular neutral and do not modify the plasmatic cholesterol levels in humans  <cit> .

tilling  is a technology to detect induced and natural polymorphisms  in plants  <cit> . the critical steps in tilling procedure include the purity of seed material, the quality of the mutagenesis and the size of the mutant collection. tilling relies on the ability of a group of enzymes, the endonucleases, to detect mismatches in a specific gene . with the introduction of high throughput tilling technology , detection of even rare recessive mutation is possible  <cit> . the significant advantages of tilling method in creating and discovering new traits is that it significantly costs less for product development compared to transgenic crop plants. this makes it an attractive tool for crop improvement. as sequencing technology is getting advanced, deciphering small changes, like snps, which plays an important role in adaptive response and evolution of species is possible  <cit> .

sunflower, cultivated as a source of vegetable oil and protein is an attractive model for investigating seed oil quality. to investigate such trait, we have developed a reference ems mutant population under controlled conditions and established a tilling platform. as proof-of-concept, we screened for mutations in two genes, fata and sad, involved in accumulation of short to medium chain fatty acids and identified  <dig> induced mutations.

RESULTS
ems mutagenesis
a relatively large tilling resource comprising  <dig>  m <dig> families was developed for sunflower crop improvement using variety bbs- <dig>  to find the optimum dose of ems that produce a maximum mutation density without causing extensive sterility and lethality; a ‘kill curve’ analysis was conducted on batches of  <dig> seeds treated with different ems doses, form 0% to 3%, during 8 hours . at  <dig> % and  <dig> % ems, seed germination rate was 54% and 50%, respectively. drastic plant lethality was observed for seeds treated with an ems dose greater than 1% and total lethality was observed at 3% ems. finally,  <dig> % ems treatment during 8 hours, corresponding to the ld <dig> was retained and tested on large batches of seeds.

a total of  <dig>  seeds were mutagenised and sown in pots to raise the nursery for creating the tilling sunflower genetic resource. about  <dig>  m <dig> plants were obtained, showing 50% lethality at seedling stage. after transplanting, further mortality occurred and a total of  <dig>  m <dig> plants produced seeds, among which  <dig>  m <dig> plants produced a good seed set. m <dig> seeds were harvested from the individual m <dig> plants. in total,  <dig>  m <dig> seed stocks were harvested and corresponding m <dig> seeds were produced.

m <dig> plant phenotyping
ten seeds per m <dig> family were sown in pots to raise the nursery and to screen for visual developmental phenotypes. after 4 weeks, plants were transferred to the fields and about 95% of the m <dig> plants were recovered. the phenotypic scoring was based on the observation of each plant, using the untreated sunflower phenotype as a reference. the phenotypic screen included dwarfism, plant height, flowering pattern, the leaf architecture and sterility. the data collected are shown in table  <dig>  photographs were taken at regular intervals for record purposes . a range of phenotype was observed and some are described below. compared to the untreated sunflower,  <dig> and  <dig> plants showed dwarf and tall phenotype, respectively . some of these dwarf plants can be used in creating hybrids with enhanced yield and dwarf stature. for the flower phenotype, we identified  <dig> plants with large flower heads ,  <dig> plants with twin flowers,  <dig> plants with fused and/or closed flower and  <dig> plants with upright flower . three plants harbored variation in flower color,  <dig> plant produced small seeds and  <dig> plants were sterile as both disc and ray florets were missing. in total 57 m <dig> plants, representing  <dig> % of the population, showed at least one altered trait.

mutation discovery by tilling
screening for mutations in the two genes, fata and sad, was used as proof-of-concept to determine the quality of the sunflower mutant collection and to estimate the mutation density. both of these genes control production of short to medium chain fatty acids  <cit> . sad  controls the production of stearic acid over oleic acid and inhibition of this enzyme leads to an increase stearic acid synthesis and a reduction of oleic acid production  <cit> . there are two isoforms of acyl-acp thioesterase, fata and fatb which dictate the length of medium chain fatty acids production. fata controlling essential role in chain termination of fatty acid synthesized  <cit>  was used in the present study.

we screened for mutations in the whole exonic and promoter regions of fata and sad genes. mutations were detected in the amplified targets using the mismatch-specific endonuclease endo <dig> as previously described . tilling of fata yielded  <dig> independent point mutations, which correspond to  <dig> silent,  <dig> missense,  <dig> stop codon and  <dig> promoter region mutations . tilling of sad yielded  <dig> independent point mutations, which correspond to  <dig> silent and  <dig> missense mutations . all the identified mutations were confirmed by sequencing  and, as expected for ems mutagenesis, single nucleotide substitutions were identified both in coding and non-coding regions and classical ems mutations g to a and c to t were induced .

the mutation frequency for each amplicon is calculated as follows:

 / . the average mutation frequency was estimated to be one mutation per 480 kb.

we calculated the mutation frequency in the fata and sad genes  according to dalmais et al. <cit> . we estimated the smart average mutation density to one mutation every 480 kb. this mutation rate is similar to those reported in the other diploid crops .

the large number of mutations identified in the tilling screens, i.e.  <dig> independent mutations, confirms that the genetic resource developed is of high quality. background mutations in the interesting mutant line can be removed by backcrossing with the parental non-mutated line and cleaned lines can be released after trials as a variety. as the mutation is known, the released varieties can be followed in the field by marker assisted selection . mutations resulting in stop codon and in splicing junction of exon-intron boundary are of great potential as found in the present study. currently bioinformatic tools are available to predict the severity of the non-synomonous mutations  <cit> . synonymous substitutions have the potential to alter the production and function of a protein through folding changes, although the exact mechanism and frequency of such event is still a mystery  <cit> .

discussion
as the world population continues to grow at a rapid pace, crop varieties with novel traits such as improved growth and yield potential are needed to feed in the future. plant breeding is an old science which played a significant role during green revolution for its contribution in increasing crop yields. at present, there is skepticism against growing transgenic crops and transgenic technology, mainly because of the high cost incurred in creating a variety due to lengthy regulatory hurdles, which is almost absent with mutation breeding. tilling provides a way to overcome problems associated with other techniques used in plant improvement like rnai, over expression of genes, antisense technique, site directed mutagenesis by zinc fingers, t-dna knockouts and transposon tagging  <cit> .

many useful alleles involved in qualitative and quantitative parameters that exist in natural crop populations have been eliminated in the numerous rounds of selection for targeted traits. therefore, creation of novel genetic resource by mutagenesis is a useful tool in crop improvement. in this study, we present a sunflower tilling genetic resource produced by ems chemical mutagenesis. to set up the sunflower tilling platform, we developed an ems mutant collection under controlled condition. the  <dig>  m <dig> mutant collection was phenotyped and genomic dna was prepared from the mutant plants and organized in pools for bulked screens. the mutant collection phenotyping showed that  <dig> % of the mutant plant present at least on altered trait and confirm the quality of the mutagenesis. the sunflower mutant collection could be used for both forward and reverse genetics.

sunflower has not been sequenced until now, owing to its large genome size . however,  <dig>  ests are available at ncbi as of today. studies by chapman et al.  <cit>  conducted genome scan in cultivated sunflower to predict genes involved in evolution of modern day cultivated variety. lai et al.  <cit>  published snps identified from submitted est information in gene banks. therefore, comparative genomic analysis can successfully be performed to pinpoint key gene information relating to various traits in this species by comparing known genetic information from other sequenced species.

to validate the quality of mutagenised population, we screened for mutants in fata and sad genes involved in oil biosynthesis. many other published reports are available today pertaining to changes in seed oil composition in crop varieties. for example, mutations induced in the gene encoding Δ <dig> fatty acid desaturase . screening for fad <dig> variants which increase oleic acid has been confirmed in soybean  <cit>  and novel fad <dig> alleles have been pursued in peanut  <cit>  and sunflower  <cit> . in the smart mutant population, the mutation frequency was estimated to be 1/480 kb similar to the recently published reports in sunflower  and other crops .

chemical mutagenesis and tilling approach together can be used to develop plants not only for the purpose of increasing productivity and quality parameters, but also in phytoremediation  <cit> . tilling has been successfully used in many crops to obtain useful alleles such as long shelf-life in melon and tomato  <cit> , improved starch quality in potato  <cit> , virus resistance in tomato and pepper  <cit> . a number of crops are being sequenced at present, sequence information of more than  <dig> crops are available now and more than hundred crop plants are being sequenced . many key value-added traits can be obtained in sunflower with candidate gene polymorphism.

CONCLUSIONS
a tilling genomic resource was developed for cultivated sunflower. novel mutants having useful mutation in genes can be found by screening the population through high throughput adp  technique as mentioned in this article. results obtained by screening two proof-of-concept genes are highly promising and confirms that the population is well mutagenized. additional candidate genes can be screened from the resource developed. such approach can also be used to develop markers for mas  strategy in sunflower breeding programs.
