BACKGROUND
animal models have facilitated the investigation of the mechanisms of several diseases. for drug addiction in particular, inbred mouse strains have proved to be invaluable  <cit> , and have facilitated the mapping of aspects of addiction-related behaviour to specific genetic loci. inbred long sleep  and inbred short sleep  mice, for instance, present many contrasts with respect to a number of alcoholism related phenotypes  <cit> . they have been widely used to model ethanol sensitivity  <cit> . ethanol sensitivity has a genetic basis  <cit> , the comprehensive workings of which remain elusive. consequently, a comparison of relevant brain region transcriptomes of ils and iss mice has the potential of revealing unique patterns of gene expression  <cit>  that could be relevant to the mechanisms of alcoholism.

the cerebellum has long been almost exclusively associated with balance and motor co-ordination. it has relatively recently been found to be more involved with cognition than previously thought  <cit> . during neurodevelopment, the cerebellum is especially susceptible to ethanol toxicity  <cit> . studies indicate a role for activation of the cerebellum in alcoholism. a functional magnetic resonance imaging study has indicated that ethanol odour-induced craving in untreated recently abstinent male alcoholics involves activation of the cerebellum along with the subcortical-limbic region of the right amygdala/hippocampal area  <cit> . positron emission tomography studies in drug addiction similarly indicate a role for cerebellar activation  <cit> . the identification of specific pathways contributing to alcoholism-related events in the cerebellum would, therefore, be important.

the phosphoinositide  and cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate  signalling pathways have long been thought to be important in the development of ethanol dependence and tolerance  <cit> . there are several pieces of evidence suggesting a role for the camp/protein kinase a /camp-response-element-binding protein  signalling pathway in addiction, even though they do not necessarily involve the cerebellum: alcohol preferring  rats have lower levels of creb and the transcriptionally-active phospho-creb in the medial amygdala and central amygdala  than non-preferring  rats  <cit> . ethanol administration  increases creb function in the cea of p  rats. also,  <dig> hours following a single intra-peritoneal  <dig> mg/kg ethanol dose to c57bl/6j mice, there is long-term potentiation of gaba synaptic transmission at ventral tegmental area dopaminergic neurons, via a camp-pka-dependent mechanism  <cit> . one mechanism by which ethanol increases creb levels involves inhibition of adenosine reuptake which results in increases in extracellular adenosine and activation of the adenosine a <dig> receptor, leading to increases in camp levels  <cit> . the ethanol-induced increase in cre-mediated gene transcription requires pka and involves an adenosine receptor-dependent phase and a later adenosine receptor-independent phase  <cit> .

the emergence of high throughput data has facilitated the study of patterns of transcription. machine learning  is one such avenue for mining such data  <cit> . it concentrates on methods for computer programs to improve their performance  by learning from previous data examples. ml is useful for the purpose of class prediction. during the learning process, structural patterns in the "training set" are established; these then constitute the basis upon which predictions are made when presented with data of unknown classification .

in the current studies, genes found to be differentially expressed in the cerebella of ils and iss mice  <cit>  were examined to identify the extent to which creb transcription regulates addiction mechanisms in the cerebellum. nucleotide sequences of the promoter regions of various genes were analyzed to generate the data used for ml. the composition, transitions, and distributions  <cit>  of individual nucleotide bases as well as groups of nucleotide bases , along with the presence and relative positions of specific cis elements were the basis on which genes were classified as being either transcriptionally creb regulated or otherwise. the results reveal a strong pattern, in the cerebellum, of creb regulation among genes differentially expressed between ils and iss mice.

RESULTS
four ml schemes were evaluated: a decision tree , a support vector machine , a naïve bayes classifier  and a multi-layer perceptron . two alternate models for ml were tested in this study, using a dataset of  <dig> instances and two classes. these were:

• -a two-class model with classifications: "creb-regulated" and "not creb-regulated", and

• -a three-class model with a third classification "nrf2-regulated"  <cit> 

nrf <dig> , the primary transcription factor that binds the antioxidant response element , was selected because, like creb, nrf <dig> is a ubiquitous transcription factor. secondly, it has a requirement for creb binding protein for enhanced transcription activity  <cit> . using the leave-one-out cross-validation technique, the two-class model had lower mean absolute error rates for all learning schemes explored than the three-class model . also, of the four schemes and two models evaluated, the area under the receiver operating characteristic  curve, a measure of test accuracy, was highest for the c <dig>  scheme under the two-class model .

of the four ml schemes, using the leave-one-out cross-validation technique and the two-class model, the c <dig>  decision tree algorithm had the lowest overall predicted error rate . its roc curve was closest to the left-hand border and the top border of the roc space , indicating that it had the most optimal trade-off between sensitivity and specificity among the four schemes evaluated. it also had the highest area under the roc curve . the c <dig>  decision tree algorithm  <cit>  works top-down, seeking at each stage an attribute that best separates the classes. the attribute with the greatest information gain is chosen. it then recursively processes the sub-problems resulting from the split until the information either reaches a maximum or is zero. the information measure  is calculated thus:

entropy  = -p1log2p1-p2log2p <dig> ...-pnlog2pn

where p <dig>  p <dig>  .... pn are fractions representing the data distribution at a node  and sum up to  <dig> 

the two-class model was also used to test an independent dataset generated from  <dig> genes of known creb regulation status. c <dig>  correctly classified 81% of instances  with f-measures of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively for the classes "creb-regulated" and "not creb-regulated" respectively. the f-measure is the harmonic mean of precision and sensitivity and can be used as a single measure of a test's performance:

f-measure = /

where precision = true positives/

sensitivity  is a measure of the probability that the test would reject a false null hypothesis:

sensitivity = true positives/

additionally, using the two-class model, three out of four genes determined by two independent microarray platforms to be up-regulated in the ils cerebellum  <cit>  were determined by c <dig>  to be transcriptionally creb-regulated . the platforms were the affymetrix  platform mouse expression set  <dig>  and the cdna arrays nia15k manufactured at the university of colorado's school of medicine. similarly, three out of four genes up-regulated by both platforms in the iss cerebellum were deemed creb-regulated . furthermore, 64% and 52% of a cross-section of other up-regulated cerebellar genes in ils and iss mice, respectively , were deemed creb-regulated.

discussion
lowered sensitivity to the effects of ethanol increases the risk of developing alcoholism. differing sensitivities to ethanol is, at least in part, attributable to heredity  <cit> , and inbred mouse strains have facilitated the investigation of this complex behavioral phenomenon. in studying creb's gene regulating activity in ethanol sensitivity, a set of differentially expressed genes in the ils/iss mouse model of ethanol sensitivity were examined. the two-class model had lower error rates than the three-class model . this is probably due to the inherent difficulty of distinguishing between the classifications "creb-regulated" and "nrf2-regulated". indeed the case can be made that nrf <dig> genes are dependent on creb for enhanced transcription activity  <cit> . the complexity of the machinery for transcription makes the two-class model the preferred model for this study.

properties of stretches of nucleotides can impact their affinity for specific transcription factors; this principle can be exploited for its therapeutic promise  <cit> . a central premise of this observation is the fact that the characteristics of individual nucleotide bases in any such oligonucleotide contribute to its structure and function  <cit> . as an example, hydrogen-bonded base pairs help determine the structure and function of nucleic acids. strength of hydrogen bonding and other nucleotide base classifications used in generating the characteristics of each gene's promoter sequence for this ml study have been outlined in table  <dig> 

of the four learning schemes evaluated using the two-class model, c <dig>  was the most consistent performer, having the lowest overall error rates , and the highest accuracy , area under the roc curves being measures of test accuracy. because of variability between independent evaluation sets, performance evaluations based on evaluation sets are only instructive when such evaluation sets are large in size. since the evaluation set used consisted of only  <dig> instances, the cross-validation techniques are better indicators of each learning scheme's performance. the ten-fold cross validation technique is a standard way for predicting the error rate of a learning scheme  <cit> . when applying this technique, an average value is obtained for ten different sets of the re-organized data such that in each case, 90% of the data is used for training and 10% used for testing. the leave-one-out technique is, in essence, an n-fold cross-validation technique  and, for a small dataset, a good predictor of a scheme's performance on an independent dataset. in this study, 81% of genes of known classification used as an evaluation set were correctly classified by c <dig>  , with f-measures of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively for the classes "creb-regulated" and "not creb-regulated" respectively.

the stretch of nucleotides between the camp response element  and the transcription start site  and the stretch between the cre and the transcription factor ii d  bind site were identified as important determinants of a gene's creb regulation status . two types of cre with different affinities for the transcription factor creb have been reported. one class containing the symmetrical tgacgtca site shows a high binding affinity for creb; the other type has asymmetric and weak binding sites   <cit> . the tata-binding protein  and tbp-associated factors  constitute the tfiid complex. the tfiid complex is a major component of the general rna polymerase ii  transcription machinery with intrinsic sequence-specific dna-binding activity  <cit> . the binding of tfiid to a gene's core promoter region is an important rate-limiting step in the assembly of the transcription initiation complex. with the notable exception of the stretch between the cre and the tfiid bind site, creb target promoter regions have relatively high levels of nucleotide bases with strong hydrogen bonding .

the transcription factor, creb, is ubiquitously expressed in brain cells and is involved, among others, in learning and memory, anxiety, depression, and addiction  <cit> . a number of different signalling pathways culminate in the activation of creb. these include pathways involving pka, mapk-activated ribosomal s <dig> kinases , and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase iv   <cit> . others such as camkii reduce creb transcriptional activity  <cit> . four genes have previously been found, by two independent microarray platforms, to be up-regulated in the ils mouse cerebellum relative to the iss cerebellum  <cit> . of these, three were predicted by c <dig>  as being creb-dependent . similarly, three out of four genes up-regulated in the iss cerebellum relative to the ils cerebellum were predicted by the c <dig>  scheme to be transcriptionally creb-dependent . of a cross-section of genes up-regulated in the ils cerebellum relative to iss per the affymetrix moe <dig> platform  <cit> , 64% were predicted by the c <dig>  scheme to be transcriptionally creb-dependent. out of a similar cross-section up-regulated in the iss cerebellum relative to the ils cerebellum, 52% were predicted to be creb-dependent. these indicate that creb may be playing a central transcription-regulating role in the cerebellum in this ethanol sensitivity model.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, the observations made suggest that, in the cerebellum, creb plays a key role in ethanol sensitivity and presents the field with a central hypothesis that needs to be further tested. creb's role in mediating a number of complex behaviours has been documented  <cit> . events in the extended amygdala have long been associated with the reinforcing effects of addicting drugs  <cit> . it is evident that the cerebellum, though less well studied in this regard, is involved in addiction  <cit> . since creb's transcription regulating activity differs from cell type to cell type  <cit> , pursuit of the implications of a key role for creb in this addiction model's cerebellar molecular milieu would be both promising and instructive.
