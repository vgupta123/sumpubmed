BACKGROUND
the hereditary spastic paraplegias  are inherited neurological disorders characterized by progressive spasticity and muscle weakness in the lower limbs  <cit> . troyer syndrome is an autosomal recessive hsp caused by a frameshift mutation in the spartin gene   <cit> , resulting in a loss of expression of the mutated protein  <cit> .

spartin harbors a microtubule-interacting and trafficking  domain and a plant-senescence domain at its n-terminus and c-terminus, respectively  <cit> . the latter domain was suggested to be responsible for spartin's association with lipid droplets in cells incubated with oleic acid  <cit> . spartin has a multifunctional role in cells as evidenced by its association with membranes of several cellular organelles  <cit>  and its interaction with many binding partners  <cit> . thus far is it known that spartin is important in the trafficking of epidermal growth factor receptors  <cit>  and in the turnover of lipid droplets  <cit> . lipid droplets contain a neutral lipid core surrounded by a monolayer of polar lipids. the membrane layer of the lipid droplet has two major groups of proteins: enzymes important in lipid metabolism and the perilipin, adipophilin, and 47-kda tail interacting protein  family of peripheral membrane proteins involved in stabilizing lipid droplets  <cit> .

spartin is known to be ubiquitinated and interacts with several e <dig> ubiquitin ligases that harbor a homologous to e6-associated protein c-terminus  domain. these ligases belong to the neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated gene  family and include atrophin-1-interacting protein  <dig>   <cit>  and atrophin-1-interacting protein  <dig>  also known as the ww domain-containing e <dig> ubiquitin protein ligase  <dig>   <cit> . although previous studies have shown that aip <dig> is responsible for ubiquitination of spartin and removes spartin from the lipid droplets  <cit> , a recent report demonstrated that depletion of aip <dig> and aip <dig> had no effect on spartin's ubiquitination  <cit> . furthermore, the importance of the interaction between spartin and e <dig> ubiquitin ligases with the hect domain remains unknown.

in this study, we provide evidence that spartin is not ubiquitinated by aip4; rather, spartin acts as an adaptor protein that, through binding to aip <dig>  increases the enzymatic activity of this e <dig> ligase by releasing aip <dig> from its autoinhibited state. we also demonstrate that spartin recruits aip <dig> to lipid droplets and is a necessary adaptor protein for polyubiquitination of adipophilin on lipid droplets. this might be one of the mechanisms by which spartin regulates the turnover of lipid droplets.

RESULTS
ubiquitination levels of spartin are not altered by aip4
previous studies showed that spartin interacts with aip <dig> ), aip <dig>  and aip <dig> through its ppay motif  <cit> . however, there is a discrepancy between previous studies: one found that spartin is a substrate of aip <dig> and aip <dig> e <dig> ligases  <cit> , but another found that spartin is not a substrate of those ligases  <cit> . to resolve this discrepancy, we used an in vivo ubiquitination assay to investigate the ubiquitination status of spartin in cells overexpressing ubiquitin together with either wild-type or enzymatically inactive aip <dig>  specifically, we examined the conjugation of hemagglutinin -tagged ubiquitin into myc-spartin that had been immunoprecipitated from hela cells cotransfected with ubiquitin and spartin together with either flag-aip <dig> or flag-aip4c830a.

before immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were boiled in sodium dodecyl sulfate  to eliminate proteins that could coprecipitate with spartin. immunoblots showed that, in the presence of wild-type aip <dig> or catalytically inactive aip4c830a, the ubiquitination levels of overexpressed spartin were similar . as we previously shown  <cit> , spartin was monoubiquitinated and polyubiquitinated when overexpressed with exogenous ubiquitin. however, the polyubiquitination of spartin does not result in its increased degradation by proteasomes .

the interaction between spartin and aip <dig> or aip <dig> is mediated by spartin's ppay motif. when the ppay motif within spartin was mutated to paaa, it abrogated the interaction with aip <dig> and aip <dig> . one report found that this mutation resulted in the loss of ubiquitination of spartin  <cit> , but edwards and colleagues  <cit>  reported that this mutation had no effect on the levels of spartin's ubiquitination. to resolve these contradictory results, we further examined the ubiquitination levels of spartin after preventing its binding to aip <dig> by mutating the ppay motif or using the fragment of spartin depleted of its n-terminus containing the ppay motif. we overexpressed ha-wild-type spartin, ha-mutant spartin py/aa  or ha-tagged spartin fragment 211- <dig>  together with flag-ubiquitin in hela cells. as shown in figure 1b, overexpressed spartin py/aa and the spartin fragment  were both monoubiquitinated and polyubiquitinated to the same extent as the wild-type spartin. neither overexpressed spartin py/aa nor the spartin fragment  interacted with aip <dig> . we summarized the association of different spartin constructs with aip <dig> and their ubiquitination status in figure 1d. overall, our results indicate that the levels of spartin's ubiquitination are not affected by its association with aip <dig> 

spartin recruits aip <dig> to endogenous lipid droplets
although spartin interacts with aip <dig>  it is still ubiquitinated in the presence of an enzymatically inactive mutant of aip <dig>  suggesting that spartin is not a substrate of aip <dig>  those data prompted us to investigate whether spartin acts as an adaptor protein that alters the localization of aip <dig> in the cell. we used immunofluorescence to examine the subcellular localization of overexpressed aip <dig> alone or together with the wild-type spartin or mutant spartin py/aa, which does not bind to aip <dig>  we found that ha-spartin  was localized in the cytoplasm and associated with endogenous lipid droplets  in nearly all transfected cells . in contrast, overexpressed flag-aip <dig>  did not associate with lipid droplets in any examined cells . however, when ha-spartin and flag-aip <dig> were cotransfected, flag-aip <dig> was recruited to endogenous lipid droplets by ha-wild-type spartin in nearly all cotransfected cells . cells coexpressing ha-mutant spartin py/aa and flag-aip <dig> showed diffuse staining of aip <dig>  but no colocalization with the mutant spartin  in lipid droplets  in any cotransfected cells. however, ha-mutant spartin py/aa  associated with lipid droplets  similarly to ha-wild-type spartin .

we also found that ha-wild-type spartin but not mutant spartin py/aa sequestered aip <dig> to the lipid droplets . these results reveal that spartin is an adaptor protein that recruits aip <dig> and aip <dig> to the lipid droplets.

spartin increases the activity of aip <dig> in vivo and in vitro
to further investigate the role of spartin as an adaptor protein in binding with aip <dig>  we examined whether, in addition to recruiting aip <dig> to lipid droplets, spartin also enhances its enzymatic activity. it has been shown that, because of the presence of the catalytic hect domain, the level of self-ubiquitination of aip <dig> is a good measure of its enzymatic activity  <cit> .

we examined the levels of aip <dig> ubiquitination in hela cells in which flag-aip <dig> was cotransfected with ha-ubiquitin and either myc-wild-type spartin or myc-mutant spartin py/aa, which does not bind to aip <dig>  in order to dissociate all proteins that could potentially coprecipitate with aip <dig>  we boiled cell lysates in sds then decreased its concentration in lysate buffer. we performed immunoprecipitation with anti-flag antibodies and immunoblotted the membrane with anti-ha antibodies to detect ubiquitinated flag-aip <dig>  as shown in figure 3a, the level of flag-aip <dig> ubiquitination  was significantly higher in cells cotransfected with wild-type spartin than in cells cotransfected with mutant spartin that does not bind aip <dig> 

furthermore, we examined whether binding of wild-type spartin to aip <dig> in vitro also results in increased self-ubiquitination of aip <dig>  we investigated the levels of self-ubiquitination of the glutathione s-transferase -aip4Δc <dig> protein in the absence of spartin or in the presence of spartin fragments 155- <dig> or 155- <dig> py/aa. we used these spartin fragments because they are easily expressed in bacteria. we used aip <dig> lacking the c <dig> domain because this protein contains all necessary domains for its autoinhibition and is well expressed in bacteria  <cit> . as shown in figure 3b , in the absence of spartin, aip4Δc <dig> was self-ubiquitinated at low levels in the presence of all necessary components for in vitro ubiquitination. when spartin 155- <dig> was added to the reaction, self-ubiquitination of aip4Δc <dig> increased significantly as detected by anti-ubiquitin antibodies . in the presence of spartin, a high molecular weight smear was also detected when we used anti-itch antibodies . in contrast, in the presence of mutant spartin 155- <dig> py/aa, aip4Δc <dig> was ubiquitinated at the same low levels as in the absence of spartin . the results from in vitro and in vivo ubiquitination experiments demonstrate that spartin's binding to aip <dig> significantly increases the catalytic activity of this e <dig> ligase.

spartin promotes polyubiquitination of adipophilin on lipid droplets
although spartin is not ubiquitinated by aip <dig>  by recruiting aip <dig> to lipid droplets and increasing its activity, spartin might place aip <dig> in the vicinity of its substrate. one of those substrates might be adipophilin, also known as adipose differentiation-related protein , which has been shown to be polyubiquitinated  <cit> . to examine the levels of ubiquitination of adipophilin in the absence of aip <dig>  aip <dig>  and aip <dig>  we did not attempt to knock down aip <dig>  aip <dig>  and aip <dig> simultaneously in cells because depletion of two of these e <dig> ubiquitin ligases results in cell death  <cit> . using immunofluorescence, we determined that spartin colocalizes with ha-adipophilin on lipid droplets . thus, we tested whether spartin-mediated recruitment of nedd <dig> e <dig> ubiquitin ligases to lipid droplets might be responsible for the polyubiquitination of adipophilin. we found that spartin cells treated with small interfering rna  showed significantly less polyubiquitination of adipophilin compared with control sirna-treated cells . this suggests that spartin-mediated recruitment of nedd <dig> e <dig> ligases to lipid droplets might be responsible for ubiquitination of adipophilin in hela cells.

binding of spartin to aip <dig> disrupts the proline-rich region /ww-hect complex
other researchers have suggested that the enzymatic activity of aip <dig> is autoinhibited by the intramolecular interaction of its hect domain with the region between the proline-rich region and the wwiv domain  <cit> . furthermore, we showed that spartin-mediated binding to aip <dig> increases its self-ubiquitination, implying that spartin releases aip <dig> from its autoinhibited state. to assess the inhibitory interactions of aip <dig> directly, we purified the prr/wwi-iv region and the hect domain of aip <dig> and used the intermolecular prr/ww-hect complex to mimic the autoinhibited state of aip4; then we examined whether spartin's binding to aip <dig> disrupts this complex. we sought to quantitatively measure the binding affinity between the prr/wwi-iv region and the hect domain of aip <dig> 

by using a capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , we detected saturable binding between the proline-rich region /wwi-iv region and the hect domain; the dissociation constant was  <dig> ±  <dig>  μm . we also observed saturable binding between spartin and the prr/wwi-iv region. the calculated dissociation constant of this interaction was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm . these results indicate that spartin has a seven times higher affinity of binding to the prr/wwi-iv region than the binding of the prr/wwi-iv region has to the hect domain. we assessed whether the binding of spartin to aip <dig> would disrupt the prr/ww-hect complex, which would release aip <dig> from its autoinhibited state. as shown in figure 4c, wild-type spartin inhibited the intermolecular interaction between hect and the prr/wwi-iv fragment in a dose-dependent manner, with a half maximal inhibitory concentration  of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm and an inhibition constant of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm. in contrast, mutant spartin pa/py failed to inhibit the hect-prr/wwi-iv complex. thus, spartin increases enzymatic activity of aip <dig> indirectly by disrupting its prr/ww-hect complex releasing aip <dig> from it autoinhibited state.

discussion
hereditary spastic paraplegias, such as troyer syndrome, are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by progressive weakness and spasticity in the lower limbs  <cit> . a nucleotide deletion  in spartin  causes autosomal recessive troyer syndrome  <cit> . previously, we demonstrated that this mutation results in a complete loss of spartin and postulated that troyer syndrome has a loss-of-function disease mechanism  <cit> .

recently, it has been shown that spartin is involved in turnover of lipid droplets by an unknown mechanism  <cit> . these findings suggested that there is a link between lipid droplet turnover and the pathology of troyer syndrome. in the present studies, we investigated a molecular mechanism for spartin-dependent regulation of lipid droplet turnover. this novel pathway, which we call spaa, involves spartin, the e <dig> ubiquitin ligase aip <dig>  and a major lipid droplet protein, adipophilin.

our study provides molecular and biochemical evidence that spartin is not ubiquitinated by aip <dig> but acts as an adaptor protein for this e <dig> ubiquitin ligase. we determined that spartin markedly increases self-ubiquitination of aip <dig> through ppay-mediated binding and recruits it to the lipid droplets. we also demonstrated that spartin promotes ubiquitination of adipophilin, a lipid-associated protein that is known to affect triacylglycerol turnover  <cit> .

the catalytic activity of aip <dig>  similar to other e <dig> ligases in the nedd <dig> family  <cit> , is regulated by intramolecular and intermolecular interactions. the intramolecular interactions lead to the autoinhibition of the catalytic activity of many members of the nedd <dig> family e <dig> ligases  <cit> . it has been shown that autoinhibition of aip <dig> is due to the binding between its hect domain and ww domains  <cit>  or its hect domain and a sequence between the prr and the ww domains  <cit> . the current model that explains the increase of aip <dig> activity involves disrupting intramolecular binding within aip <dig>  which releases the hect domain from autoinhibition. we tested this model and demonstrated quantitatively that ppay-mediated binding of spartin to aip <dig> disrupts the interaction between the hect domain and the prr/ww region of aip <dig>  the binding affinity of the prr/ww region for spartin  is about seven times stronger than the binding affinity for the hect domain  in vitro. these data strongly support our model in which a tight interaction between spartin and the ww-i and ww-ii domains of aip <dig>  disrupts a weaker intramolecular interaction, which leads to increased catalytic activity of this e <dig> ligase . spartin interacts with other e <dig> ligases belonging to the nedd <dig> family, including aip <dig> and aip <dig>  <cit> , which are known to have a propensity for autoinhibition  <cit> . therefore, we anticipate that spartin might also instigate the enzymatic activity of these other e <dig> ubiquitin ligases and will investigate them in future studies.

we have shown that spartin, through its ppay motif, sequesters aip <dig> and aip <dig> to endogenous lipid droplets. this finding contrasts with that of previous studies that showed decreased accumulation of yfp-spartin on lipid droplets  by overexpressed cherry-aip <dig>  <cit> . one possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the induction of lipid droplets with a high dose of oleic acid and the large fluorescence tags fused to both spartin and aip <dig> significantly altered the dynamics of those proteins.

we demonstrated that spartin facilitates ubiquitination of adipophilin, a lipid droplet-associated protein. it has been shown that adipophilin is polyubiquitinated and then degraded by a proteasome-dependent pathway  <cit> . ubiquitination is one of the mechanisms by which the stability of adipophilin is regulated  <cit> , and its level of ubiquitination seems to be regulated by spartin-mediated recruitment of nedd <dig> e <dig> ubiquitin ligases to lipid droplets . because adipophilin decreases triacylglycerol turnover  <cit> , we propose that spartin affects lipid droplet turnover   by regulating the level of ubiquitination of adipophilin and perhaps other lipid droplet-associated proteins. we call this molecular mechanism the spaa pathway for lipid droplet turnover.

impaired lipid droplet metabolism might be one of the mechanisms in the pathogenesis of troyer syndrome. malfunction of proteins involved in lipid maintenance is considered to be a cause of some neurological disorders  <cit> . for example, an autosomal-dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia, hsp <dig>  which is characterized by muscle weakness in upper limbs and spasticity of lower limbs, is caused by a mutation in the berardinelli-seip congenital lipodystrophy  <dig>  gene encoding seipin  <cit> . seipin has been shown to maintain the physiological morphology and size of lipid droplets in yeast  <cit> . a large number of lipid droplets in atrophic α motor neurons have been reported in hereditary porcine neuronal degeneration  <cit> . now, based on the spaa pathway for lipid droplet turnover, we can begin unraveling the specific biological role of spartin in troyer syndrome.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, spartin is not a substrate for aip <dig> e <dig> ubiquitin ligase. instead, spartin acts as a classic adaptor protein that recruits aip <dig> to lipid droplets and increases its enzymatic activity. in addition, spartin acts as a linker for ubiquitination of adipophilin on lipid droplets, likely by sequestering nedd  <dig> e <dig> ubiquitin ligases and ubiquitination machinery. these might be one of the mechanisms by which spartin regulates lipid droplet turnover and which may contribute to the pathophysiology of spg <dig>
