BACKGROUND
low temperature is one of the most important environmental stresses that influences the life and distribution of living organisms. in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, reductions in environmental temperature have widespread effects on growth and survival. at low, but permissive, temperatures , metabolic activity and growth rates lower. this is relevant for the industrial exploitation of yeast since brewing and some wine fermentations take place at around 12–15 °c. low temperatures are used in wine fermentations to enhance production and to retain flavor volatiles, which enable the production of white and “rosé” wines with greater aromatic complexity  <cit> .

yeast undergoes considerable stress during wine fermentation from high concentrations of sugars in grape must, which leads to high osmotic pressure at the beginning of the process. as fermentation proceeds, ethanol accumulation, limiting nitrogen concentration, or even the presence of so <dig>  impose further pressure. in addition to these inherent difficulties to the process, temperatures below the optimum range of growth   <cit>  affect yeast growth and fermentation rates, and give rise to both a prolonged lag phase and the production of stuck and sluggish fermentations  <cit> .

changes in gene expression levels, ploidy and copy number variation  serve as the main genetic adaptive signatures of wine yeasts to fermentative processes  <cit> . other enological traits, such as ethanol production, residual sugar after fermentation, nitrogen uptake and volatile acidity, are complex traits determined by multiple quantitative trait loci   <cit> . the genetic mechanisms that underlie their variation can be identified by a linkage analysis. this approach uses crosses between two phenotypically different strains, and searches for a statistical link between the phenotype and genetic markers of segregant strains  <cit> . qtl mapping has been successfully applied to high-temperature growth , sporulation , cell morphology  <cit> , drug sensitivity  <cit> , ethanol tolerance and growth  <cit> , protein abundance  <cit> , and flocculation  <cit> . qtl approaches have also been used to dissect the molecular basis of several wine yeast metabolic traits, such as acetic acid production, hydrogen sulfide production, and for the release of volatile phenol  <cit> , nitrogen utilization and metabolite production  <cit> , and the production of acetic acid, glycerol, and residual sugar concentrations  <cit> .

to identify the genetic variants that affect low-temperature adaptation in wine yeast, we performed qtl mapping using a set of segregants derived from a cross between two industrial wine yeast strains with a divergent phenotype at low temperature  <cit> , but with a very similar genotype. we identified four genomic regions located in the different chromosomes implicated in the fermentation process at low temperature in industrial wine yeast, and ran a reciprocal hemizygosity  analysis for validation purposes. we identified subtelomeres to be an important source of genetic variation in industrial yeast  <cit> , and found both the mitochondria and proteins involved in maintaining correct asymmetry and distribution of phospholipid in the plasma membrane played a crucial role in low-temperature growth.

RESULTS
genetic characterization of parental strains
we investigated the genetic basis of low-temperature adaptation in wine yeast in two s. cerevisiae enological strains, p <dig> and p <dig>  characterized in a previous study  <cit> , as displaying extreme differences in fermentation ability at 15 °c. p <dig> corresponds to commercial strain lalvin®icvgre, which is marketed for temperature fermentations ranging from  <dig> to 30 °c. p <dig> has no commercial name since it is undergoing its development stage. the genomes of these two wine strains were sequenced and compared with that of reference strain s288c. we used seven informative genes to classify the parental strain  <cit>  to construct a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of  <dig> strains of different origins. figure 1a shows the five clean lineage described by liti et al.   <cit> , which are well clustered. as expected, both parental strains belonged to the wine/european lineage with a bootstrap value of  <dig> fig.  <dig> genomic and phylogenetic analyses of parental strains. a the evolutionary history was inferred using the ml method with  <dig> replicates of the bootstrap test based on concatenated nucleotide sequences of seven phylogenetic informative loci. different colors denote the strain’s origin. b copy number variation across the genome . the four regions with a cnv bigger than 4 kb are marked in the figure




based on the raw sequence data,  <dig> and  <dig> mutations in strain p <dig> and strain p <dig>  respectively, were identified compared to the reference strain. of the total number of single-nucleotide polymorphism ,  <dig> were common to both wine strains , with  <dig> and  <dig> specific mutations in p <dig> and p <dig> respectively, of which  <dig> and 82% were homozygous and representing a sequence divergence of  <dig> % . approximately 30% of the unique snps of both wine strains were nonsynonymous changes in the coding region, which resulted in an amino acid change. this set of strain specific mutations was used for the linkage analysis.

certain classes of variants, such as insertions and deletions , are expected to have dramatic consequences for gene products, and therefore constitute particularly interesting candidates for contributing to phenotypic variation. the comparison with the reference strain yielded  <dig> and  <dig> strain specific indels, in which approximately  <dig> and 13% were within the coding sequence, in the p <dig> and p <dig> respectively. when examining the distribution of these strain specific indels to each strain along chromosomes, some  showed an enrichment of variants. within open reading frames , the indels with lengths that were multiples of three were highly enriched when compared with the noncoding sequence. this is consistent with strong purifying selection against frameshifts. those indels in the coding sequence with lengths that were not multiples of three were located mainly in functionally uncharacterized genes. this confirmed that this group of genes was, on average, under lower purifying selection pressure  <cit> .

we also detected the copy number variation of the genomic regions between both strains . ninety-three cnv longer than 900 bp were detected across the genome comparison made between both strains. figure 1b shows the copy number variation  across chromosomes. although there were some regions with variation, only four were larger than 4 kb. these four regions were located in chromosome iv and in the subtelomeric regions of chromosomes viii, xv and xvi. most of these cnv were classified as transposable elements and subtelomeric regions. these results are in line with previous observations  <cit> , which found very limited cnv in nonsubtelomeric regions and extensive variation in subtelomeric regions.

genetic and phenotypic characteristics of segregants
for the qtl analysis, we generated populations of segregants by crossing the two wine strains of different cold tolerance for up to  <dig> generations . this strategy allowed us to increase the resolution by reducing linkage between nearby qtls. to study the genetic diversity of segregant populations, five differential snps of chromosome iii in  <dig> segregants of f <dig> were genotyped. a recombination frequency of  <dig>  was assessed, and there was an average of  <dig> haplotypes per snp . the f <dig> segregants were screened for their low temperature adaptation by calculating the maximum growth rate of each segregant and the two parental strains .fig.  <dig> growth rate variation at low temperature. a growth rate values at 15 °c are shown on the y-axis for  <dig> ranked segregants. blue indicates transgressive phenotypic space, and segregants with transgressive phenotypes . red dots indicate parental strains. b detailed growth curves of parental and transgressive segregants  with extreme traits in the p5×p <dig> cross




transgression levels, that is, the percentage of segregants that exceed the phenotypic range of their parents by at least  <dig> standard deviations  <cit> , can provide insight into the genetics that underlies complex traits. sixteen percent of transgressive segregants better performed if compared with the superior parental, while just  <dig> % of segregants presented a lower transgressive value than the inferior strain. trait heritability was over 65%, which indicates the importance of genetic determinism under our conditions. an example of the growth curves of two transgressive segregants is offered in fig. 2b.

low-temperature selection of segregant populations
the f <dig> diploid population was subjected to a selection experiment at  <dig> and 28 °c for approximately  <dig> generations . figure  <dig> shows the improvement in the growth rate  of the selected population  compared with the f <dig> population. at low temperature, the growth rate of the selected population improved in both yeast extract peptone dextrose   and synthetic must  . the control population, which was cultured at 28 °c, was also phenotyped in both media. the ypd selected population at 28 °c showed an improved growth rate . no significant differences were obtained for the sm selected population at 28 °c .fig.  <dig> phenotyping  of the hybrid population after the selection experiment compared with the unselected f <dig> population. selected population  in the ypd medium  and synthetic must   at 15 °c. selected population  in ypd  and sm  at 28 °c. box plot represents μmax distribution in each population and the black bar inside the box represents the mean value. *significant differences in the sp compared with the f13




to study if the improved growth rate in populations was due to either the temperature selective pressure or an unselective stress, each set was exposed to the opposite temperature to which they were selected. this meant that the sp at 15 °c was grown at 28 °c and that selected at 28 °c was grown at 15 °c, and their growth rates were also compared with the f <dig> population . as expected, in ypd medium, the selected population either at  <dig> or 15 °c didn’t improve its growth or grew worse when was cultivated to the opposite temperature, revealing a selection based on the temperature. however, the selected population in sm also improved its growth when was cultivated in a non-selective temperature, indicating that this complex medium also exerted a strong pressure during the selection.

allele frequency analysis reveals that four qtls are related to low-temperature adaptation during alcoholic fermentation
a pool of the selected populations at 15 °c in ypd and sm and at 28 °c in sm were whole-genome sequenced and compared with the whole-genome sequence of a pool of the f <dig> population before selective growth at both temperatures. the allele frequency analysis allowed us to map the qtl intervals responsible for phenotypic variation. four distinct qtls for the three assayed conditions  were found . qtls were detected for 28 °c  on chr i, for 15 °c in ypd  on chr xvi and for 15 °c in sm  on chr xiii, xiv, xv and xvi. the qtl found at low temperature in ypd overlapped with that located in chromosome xvi at low temperature in sm. this finding suggested that this region could be important for low-temperature adaptation, and independently of media. except for the qtl located in chromosome xiv, all the others were located in the subtelomeric regions. these results reinforce the hypothesis that subtelomeric regions are a major source of the divergence of genome sequences and gene content in s. cerevisiae, and directly contribute to strain-specific adaptation processes.fig.  <dig> qtl analysis for low-temperature adaptation. genomic dna samples were extracted from an unselected pool  and three pools of segregants were selected at 15 °c  and 28 °c . the figure shows the allele frequency change of the three selected pools compared with the unselected population. qtls are indicated at the corresponding positions with orange triangles , red triangles  and green triangles 




validation of the qtls detected in subtelomeric regions by reciprocal hemizygosity  analyses
subtelomeric regions are difficult to sequence and assemble due to their wide variation, duplication levels and shared homologies between different chromosome ends. thus subtelomeres are generally incomplete in most genome projects, which precludes the identification of causative genes of a trait in these regions  <cit> . to validate the involvement of subtelomeric regions as qtls of low-temperature adaptation, two hemizygous diploid p5/p <dig> hybrid strains were constructed, which retained a single copy of the subtelomere from either the superior  or inferior parent , while the other copy was deleted. as growth rate and fermentation activity are directly correlated in these strains  <cit> , they were tested during low-temperature fermentations to estimate the phenotypic differences between the two reciprocal hemizygotes of each subtelomere. fermentation activity was estimated by calculating the time required to ferment 100%  of the sugars in the sm at  <dig> and 28 °c and it also is an interesting trait for our aim of detecting genome regions involved in adaptation to low temperature fermentations. the fermentation activity of the hemizygous strains is presented in fig.  <dig> as the relative t <dig> compared with hybrid p5/p <dig>  the parental origin of the subtelomere produced an opposite impact on fermentation activity in most cases. thus the absence of the p <dig> right xvi-subtelomere caused a long delay of the end of fermentation at 28 °c and the inability to finish it at a low temperature. conversely, lack of the same region that belonged to p <dig> significantly  improved fermentation at low temperature compared with the control hybrid strain p5/p <dig>  thus the p <dig> xvi-subtelomere must contain genes of paramount importance for fermentation activity in this strain, regardless of the temperature applied in the process. however, this same region in the p <dig> strain did not seem to be connected with temperature adaptation because its absence resulted in a haploproficient phenotype at low temperature.fig.  <dig> rh analysis of the qtls detected in subtelomeric regions. fermentation kinetics of the hemizygous p5/p <dig> diploid hybrids retained a single copy of the subtelomere  either from the superior  or inferior parent , while the other copy was deleted. the fermentation activity of the hemizygous strains is presented as the relative t <dig> compared with hybrid p5/p <dig>  the t <dig> value was compared with the control strain normalized as value  <dig>  the t <dig> of the control strain was:  <dig> and 755 h at  <dig> and 15 °c respectively. *significant differences compared with the control at the same temperature. # indicates stuck fermentation before t100




similarly, absence of the p <dig> right xiii-subtelomere caused a significant delay in the fermentation kinetics at both  <dig> and 28 °c, whereas absence of the same region that belonged to p <dig> significantly improved fermentation at low temperature. the hemizygosity of the left xv-subtelomere was the only one to have an impact on fermentation activity at low temperature. absence of this region in p <dig> significantly delayed the end of the fermentation at 15 °c, whereas lack of the p <dig> region improved this fermentation activity at low temperature.

identification of the causative genes of chromosome xiv qtl
the qtl located in chromosome xiv was the only one not to be located in a subtelomeric region. the four genes  closest to the mapped qtl were selected for carrying out reciprocal hemizygosity analyses . mvd <dig> and trm <dig>  also in this region, were not selected because they are essential genes in the background of by <dig> strains. aga <dig> is an agglutinin involved in sexual reproduction whose deletion has no effect on fermentation activity. however, the hemizygous hybrid strains of the other three genes clearly differed in fermentation activity at low temperature .fig.  <dig> identification of the causative genes in the qtl of chromosome xiv. a distribution of the genes present in the qtl of chromosome xiv. the genes selected for rha are colored in yellow. b fermentation kinetics  in hemizygous hybrids p5/p <dig> of genes aga <dig>  fpk <dig>  coq <dig> and pet <dig>  the t <dig> value was compared with the control normalized as value  <dig>  *significant differences compared with the control at the same temperature. # indicates stuck fermentation before t <dig>  c spot test between the control hybrid and the hemizygous deletion of the selected genes





pet <dig> and coq <dig> are mitochondrial proteins whose presence in hemizygosity produces impaired fermentation activity in both strains and at both temperatures, but mainly at a low temperature. pet <dig> is a translational activator of one of the subunits  of cytochrome c oxidase  <cit>  and coq <dig> encodes a transferase that catalyzes the second step in ubiquinone  biosynthesis  <cit> . the deletion of both genes provokes the absence of respiratory growth.

finally, fpk <dig> is a ser/thr protein kinase that phosphorylates several aminophospholipid translocase family members  by regulating phospholipid translocation and membrane asymmetry. the reciprocal hemizygote that carries the p <dig> allele has no effect on the fermentation kinetics at any temperature. however, the hemizygous strain that carries the p <dig> allele caused a substantial delay  in low-temperature fermentation. the impaired fermentation activity of p <dig> Δfpk1/p <dig> was also confirmed by a spot assay , which also showed an important growth defect of this hemizygous strain at low temperature. p <dig> has a substitution r520k in this gene that could be the cause of the inferior phenotype of this strain at low temperature.

rh analysis of wine-lab strain hybrids for the presumptive individual genes contained in the qtl subtelomeric regions
the truncation of subtelomeric regions involved the deletion of some genes not connected with low temperature. as we have information only on the genes present in the first sequenced strain , in which special efforts were made to clone and sequence each telomere region, we used the sequence available in the saccharomyces genome database  to perform a large-scale rh analysis with the genes known to be present in subtelomeric regions , and those that are not essential   <cit> . the haploid single gene deletion strains in the background of the by <dig> lab strain were crossed with the stable haploids of each parental wine strain by constructing hemizygous hybrid lab/wine strains . the fermentation capacity of the resulting hemizygotes, which contained only the wine strain allele of each individual candidate gene, were tested on sm at  <dig> and 28 °c and compared to the corresponding capacity of the lab/wine hybrid with both parental alleles intact . this strategy allowed us to compare the fitness of the different wine alleles and to attempt to discriminate the contribution made by each gene to the phenotype.fig.  <dig> rh analysis of the genes present in the qtl regions of chromosomes xiii , xiv , xv  and xvi . hybrids were constructed using the mutants of the by <dig> collection and haploid parental strains. t <dig> is the time needed to consume the total amount of sugars present in must. the t <dig> value was compared with the control normalized as value  <dig>  *significant differences compared with the control at the same temperature




the rh analysis of individual genes showed both haploinsufficient and haploproficient strains in low-temperature fermentation activity. haploproficiency meant that only the retention of the wine allele sufficed to improve the fermentation fitness of this hemizygous strain. most haploproficient strains retained the p <dig> allele, which reinforces the superior fitness of this strain to grow and ferment at low temperature. conversely, haploinsufficiency denoted a major function in low-temperature adaptation because a drop in the gene-dose impaired the fitness of the hemizygous strain. most of these hemizygous strains had either a minimal or null impact on fermentation activity at 28 °c whereas they were severely affected at low temperature. at 15 °c, the hemizygosity in most of the tested genes produced haploinsuffiency in the hybrid of both wine strains. of the genes analyzed in the xvi-subtelomere region , qcr <dig>  aqy <dig>  ypr197c and arr <dig> impaired only the low-temperature fermentation activity of the hemizygous p5/by <dig> strains, while genes opt <dig>  ypr195c and ypr196c affected this fermentation fitness at 15 °c in the hemizygous p24/by <dig> strains. qcr <dig> is also a component of the mitochondrial inner membrane electron transport chain and aqy <dig> is a spore-specific aquaporin. finally, opt <dig> is an oligopeptide transporter with a described role in the maintenance of lipid asymmetry between the inner and outer leaflets of the plasma membrane.

the same rha analysis was also performed with the genes contained in the nonsubtelomeric qtl detected in chromosome xiv . this analysis confirmed the relevance of the fpk <dig> allele in the superior fitness of the p <dig> strain because hemizygous p5/by <dig> showed better fermentation activity, whereas hemizygous p24/by <dig> significantly delayed the end of fermentation. furthermore, the importance of pet <dig> and coq <dig> in low-temperature adaptation was also supported because both hemizygotes showed impaired fermentation activity at 15 °c.

discussion
temperature had a strong effect on many life history traits, including growth, development and reproduction  <cit> . to elucidate the genetic basis that underlies low-temperature adaptation, we followed a method that began with a hybrid generated by crossing two strains with a divergent phenotype. this hybrid was used to generate segregating populations of a very large size, which were selected at environmental pressure . finally, qtl mapping was performed by identifying the regions of allelic enrichment by sequencing the segregant populations. this strategy has been previously applied to identify the qtls responsible for heat tolerance in s. cerevisiae  <cit> , but not to detect the genetic structure of low-temperature adaptation. our study has also some particularities in that it makes it different to other similar approaches.

most qtl analyses use strains that are highly divergent with a high density of segregating sites. liti et al.,  reported the presence of five genetically diverged clean lineages in s. cerevisiae  and parts et al.,  stated that the strains which belonged to clean lineages are ideal for linkage analyses as they have an even distribution of segregating sites across the genome, and these polymorphisms have coevolved in a specific genomic context. however, two strains that belonged to the same lineage were crossed  and were very close phylogenetically, as evidenced by the whole-sequence analysis of both strains. no more than 15% of the snps detected in both strains compared with the reference s228c were private mutations. while the low density of segregant sites between both strains proved to be an added difficulty for the qtl analysis since information about neighboring sites could not be used for more accurate allele frequency inferences, the strategy of intercrosses of segregants during the multiple generations that broke up linkage groups allowed individual qtls to be determined and reduced to small numbers of variants  <cit> .

another different feature of our study compared with the commonly used bulk segregant analyses was the individual characterization of the  <dig> f <dig> segregants at their growth rate at low temperature. segregants exhibited a wide range of cold tolerance phenotypes, but also a high percentage of these segregants displayed heterosis . this result revealed that the arrangement of alleles between both strains produced some combinations that improved fitness for it to become superior to parentals. this suggests that both strains contained alleles which contributed to the cold tolerance phenotype of these transgressive segregants. however, this result was also very interesting for the industrial exploitation of these strains. the intercross during many generations of two industrial strains and the further selection of fitter genomic combinations by growth during several generations under selective pressure is a good genetic improvement method. these improved strains may be rapidly transferred and easily accepted by industry, which rejects the use of gmos.

our qtl analysis revealed the importance of the subtelomeric regions that contained a genetic variation responsible for traits of interest. subtelomeric regions are generally incomplete in most genome projects. however, these regions cannot be ignored because, in yeast, 25% of all qtls for many assessed traits map to beyond the last markers available. yet the region contains only 8% of the genome  <cit> . subtelomeric gene families evolve faster than their internal counterparts, and subtelomeric regions are more frequently sites of gene duplication  <cit> , which suggests a unique role of subtelomeres as hotbeds for genomic evolution and innovation  <cit> . the whole-sequence analysis of parental strains also supports the idea that some of this variation might be due to the copy number of the genes present in different subtelomeres  <cit> .

the hemizygotic truncation of one copy of the subtelomere in isogenic hybrid strain p5/p <dig> had antagonistic effects depending on the parental origin of this region. thus the p <dig> right subtelomere of chromosome xvi must contain genes of much importance for wine fermentation, regardless of the temperature of this process. conversely, the same region in p <dig> must not comprise these fermentative genes as some gene has a detrimental effect on the fermentation activity at low temperature. however, the most paradigmatic example of genomic regions that confer superior fitness to the p <dig> strain at low temperature is the left subtelomere of chromosome xv. the fermentation performance of the hemizygous strain that lacked the p <dig> copy was clearly affected at low temperature, but not at 28 °c, and the hybrid strain that carried the p <dig> copy in hemizygotes significantly improved. application of new long read sequencing technologies would reveal genes residing in these subtelomeric regions, and allow identifying the causal genes involved in adaptation at low temperature.

we detected only a nonsubtelomeric qtl in chromosome xiv. in this case, the rh analysis showed two mitochondrial proteins, which are essential for respiratory growth and extremely important in fermentation activity at low temperature. although we may think that the absence of respiratory metabolism could not be important during a process with a dominant fermentative metabolism, it is well-known that the yeast strains which lack the mitochondrial function are sensitive to oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species   <cit> . we recently proved that cells grown at low temperature are also subjected to stronger oxidative stress  <cit> . the rh analysis also showed that gene fpk <dig> was very important for endowing better cold adaptation to p <dig> strain. this gene regulates flippase activity, which establishes plasma membrane asymmetry by flipping specific phospholipids from the extracellular to the cytosolic leaflet. the continuous remodeling of the phospholipid composition of cellular membranes as a response to low-temperature fermentations has been widely reported . the implication of fpk <dig> in low-temperature adaptation could be due to an improvement in the ability to maintain plasma membrane asymmetry. finally, the rh analysis of the by4741/wine hybrid strains revealed the key role during low-temperature fermentations of a gene  that encodes a protein of the mitochondrial inner membrane and a gene  involved in lipid asymmetry maintenance between the inner and outer leaflets of the plasma membrane, among others. this demonstrates the importance of both a fit mitochondria and the capacity of lipid remodeling in the plasma membrane for coping with low temperatures.

CONCLUSIONS
we followed a thorough strategy, previously described by parts et al.   <cit> , to elucidate the molecular basis that determines fitness or better adaptation during wine low-temperature fermentations. the qtl analysis and further rh analyses of the detected qtls proved the importance of subtelomeres as a source of variation in industrial yeast and the need to invest efforts in sequencing these regions with new sequencing technologies with long reads from single molecules. we detected the individual genes involved in adaptation at low temperature fermentation by highlighting the importance of a fit mitochondria, perhaps for coping with greater oxidative stress at low temperature, and the maintenance of correct asymmetry and phospholipid distribution in the plasma membrane. altogether this information is very useful for industrial yeast exploitation because the mechanisms involved in cold adaptation can be used as important traits for future selections of industrial cryotolerant strains or for their genetic improvement.
