BACKGROUND
alzheimer's disease  is the most prominent form of senile dementia. in the pathogenesis of ad, amyloid-β peptide  plays a critical and primary role  <cit> . the aggregation and accumulation of extracellular and intracellular aβ40/ <dig> impairs synaptic plasticity and memory  <cit> . aβ40/ <dig> is generated by β-secreatase-  and γ-secretase-mediated sequential cleavages of amyloid precursor protein . inhibition of the production of aβ40/ <dig> can be expected to delay the development of ad  <cit> . in fact, some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , including sulindac sulfide, s-ibuprofen, r-ibuprofen and indomethacin, have been shown to inhibit the production of aβ40/ <dig> by inhibiting the expression of bace and the activity of γ-secretase via activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ  and inhibiting rho-rho associated kinase  pathway  <cit> . additionally, some statins, including sinvastatin, rosuvastatin, and lovastatin, the cholesterol-lowering drugs, have been found to reduce levels of aβ40/ <dig> by promoting the expression of α-secretase and inhibiting bace activity  <cit> .

berberine , an isoquinoline alkaloid existing in cortex phellodendri  and rhizoma coptidis , has a long history in china as a non-prescription drug for the treatment of diarrhea and gastrointestinal disorders. in recent years, many studies have indicated that ber has multiple pharmacological effects. ber is a novel cholesterol-lowering drug distinct from the statin family. it works by increasing the expression of low-density lipoprotein receptors  and inhibiting lipid synthesis  <cit> . ber can also improve insulin resistance and exerts an insulin-independent glucose-lowering effect, stimulating insulin secretion and sensitizing insulin activity, inducing glycolysis, and increasing glucose transport and uptake activity  <cit> . at the same time, some studies have found that ber exerts anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting arachidonic acid metabolism and the production of some inflammatory factors including cyclooxygenase- <dig> , interleukin- <dig> beta , tumor necrosis factor-alpha , interleukin- <dig>  and inductible nitric oxide synthase  <cit> .

ber can pass through the blood-brain barrier and reach the brain parenchyma in a dose- and time-dependent manner  <cit> , and has multiple neuropharmacological properties including neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects. it also stimulates anti-neuronal apoptosis, improves cerebral microcirculation, reduces depression, and inhibits acetylcholinesterase  <cit> . notably, one study  <cit>  has reported that ber can decrease the production of aβ40/ <dig>  but the mechanism remains unclear. further investigation of how ber inhibits the expression of bace may have significant impact on the treatment of ad. in this study, we therefore focused on the mechanism of ber on bace and aβ40/ <dig> inhibition, using hek <dig> cells stably transfected with app <dig> containing the swedish mutation.

RESULTS
effects of ber and u <dig> on the proliferation and cytotoxicity of hek <dig> cells
the mtt assay was used to detect the treatments on the proliferation of hek <dig> cells. relative to the vehicle group, no significant declines were observed in the cells receiving treatments  . the ldh release of cultured medium was used to assay the treatments for the cytotoxicity of hek <dig> cells. compared with vehicle treatment, ber and u <dig> showed no significant effects on the release of ldh in the culture medium  , but 3% h2o <dig> significantly increased the release of ldh in the culture medium .

effects of ber and u <dig> on the production of aβ40/42
we assayed the treatments on the extracellular aβ40/ <dig> levels in the medium cultured from hek <dig> cells by sandwich elisa. ber  significantly reduced the levels of aβ <dig>  for  <dig> hours of incubation  and the levels of aβ <dig>  for  <dig> hours of incubation . ber  significantly reduced the levels of aβ <dig> from  <dig> hours to  <dig> hours of incubation    and the levels of aβ <dig> from  <dig> hours to  <dig> hours of incubation  . u <dig>  was found to significantly alleviate the reduction of ber  on the production of aβ40/ <dig>  the aβ <dig> levels of the vehicle, ber , u <dig> , and u <dig> with ber groups  were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg/ml,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg/ml,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg/ml, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg/ml, respectively . the aβ <dig> levels of the vehicle, ber , u <dig> , and u <dig> with ber  are  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg/ml,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg/ml,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg/ml, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg/ml, respectively .

effects of ber and u <dig> on the expression of bace
we assayed the expression of bace in hek <dig> cells by wb. ber  was found to significantly reduce the expression of bace for  <dig> hours of incubation . ber  was found to significantly reduce the expression of bace for  <dig> hours,  <dig> hours,  <dig> hours, and  <dig> hours of incubation . however, u <dig>  was found to significantly increase the expression of bace and alleviate the inhibition of ber  on the expression of bace .

effects of ber and u <dig> on the activation of erk1/ <dig> pathway
we detected the effects of ber on the activation of erk1/ <dig> pathway by wb. we found that ber  significantly increased the expression level of p-erk1/ <dig> for  <dig> hours of incubation . ber  significantly increased the expression level of p-erk1/ <dig> for  <dig> hours,  <dig> hours,  <dig> hours, and  <dig> hours of incubation . however, u <dig>  significantly inhibited the activation of erk1/ <dig> and abolished the activation effect of ber  on erk1/ <dig> for  <dig> hours of incubation .

discussion
in this study, we observed that ber significantly decreased the production of aβ40/ <dig> and the expression of bace via activation of the erk1/ <dig> pathway in a dose- and time-dependent manner. we also found that u <dig>  an antagonist of erk1/ <dig> pathway, abolished the effects of ber on both aβ40/ <dig> and bace. ber had previously been demonstrated to be able to reduce cancerous conditions by inhibiting the proliferation of tumor cells  <cit> , but we did not find that ber could inhibit the proliferation and show cytotoxicity toward hek  <dig> cells by mtt and ldh assays. from this, it can be concluded that the inhibition of ber on the production of aβ40/ <dig> is not associated with the anti-proliferative or cytotoxic qualities of ber.

the enzyme bace is crucial to the production of aβ40/ <dig> and the expression of bace increases in the brains of ad patients  <cit> . for this reason, bace has been considered as a therapeutic target for ad treatments. on the other hand, the expression and activity of bace is regulated by the erk1/ <dig> pathway in a dose- and time-dependent manner  <cit> , and ber increases the expression of ldlr and glucose uptake by activating the erk1/ <dig> pathway  <cit> . so berberine-induced reduction of bace <dig> protein levels is related to erk <dig> activation. furthermore, though ber has been shown unable to inhibit the activity of bace in vitro  <cit> , the erk1/ <dig> pathway negatively modulates bace <dig> activity in vivo  <cit> . thus, we think that ber might also decrease the production of aβ40/ <dig> by inhibit bace <dig> activity via activating erk1/ <dig> pathway, and it need to be studied in the next study.

at the same time, ber may decrease the production of aβ40/ <dig> by affecting the activity of α-secretase and γ-secretase. it has been reported that erk1/ <dig> is an endogenous negative regulator of γ-secretase activity, and nsaids can inhibit γ-secretase activity by inhibiting the rho-rock pathway  <cit> . ber inhibits tumor cell migration by inhibiting the rho-rock pathway in hone <dig> cells  <cit> , so it is possible that ber inhibits the activity of γ-secretase by activating the erk1/ <dig> pathway and inhibiting the rho-rock pathway. moreover, ber, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, may be able to upregulate α-secretase activity by promoting the translocation of α-secretase to the cell surface  <cit> . all these possibilities require further study.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we demonstrated that ber can decrease the production of aβ40/ <dig> by inhibiting the expression of bace via activation of the erk1/ <dig> pathway. in previous studies, we demonstrated that ber improved impaired spatial memory and increased both the activation of microglia and the expression of insulin degrading enzyme  in the rat model of ad  <cit> . other researchers have demonstrated other pharmacological effects of ber in hek <dig> cells, e.g., inhibiting aβ <dig> aggregation and attenuating the tau hyperphosphorylation induced by calyculin a  <cit> . together, we consider ber to be a very promising drug for use in ad patients.
