BACKGROUND
methods to specifically target and modify dna sequences are indispensable for basic and applied research. recently, the type ii bacterial clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats  system emerged as a simple and efficient tool to target and modify dna sequences of interest in a variety of organisms, including; cultured human cells  <cit> , zebrafish embryos  <cit> , yeast  <cit> , mice  <cit> , and plants such as rice  <cit> , arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , maize  <cit>  and liverwort  <cit> .

there are two components to the crispr system: a nuclear-localized crispr-associated   <dig> protein and a guide rna . cas <dig> is a large protein containing two nuclease domains, and the most commonly used one is derived from streptococcus pyogenes. the grna is a synthetic  <dig> nucleotide  rna molecule, of which the first approximately  <dig> nt are the targeting site, and the 3′ end forms a hairpin structure that interacts with the cas <dig> protein  <cit> . cas <dig> and the grna interact to identify dna sequences complementary to the grna and generate a dna double-strand break .

when a dna dsb occurs in eukaryotic cells, the imprecise repair mechanism, non-homologous end joining , can result in the insertion and/or deletion of sequences at the breakage site, typically resulting in frame-shift mutations  <cit> . in plants, such targeted dsbs can be used to knock-out genes  <cit> , modify gene expression by disrupting promoter sequences  <cit> , or insert transgenes at a specific location via homologous recombination  <cit> .

this work characterizes and further extends the use of crisprs for the genetic modification of soybean genes. crispr vectors targeting  <dig> loci were introduced into soybean via agrobacterium rhizogenes to generate transgenic hairy roots. custom-amplicon sequencing of dna from these roots show that genetic modifications were made in 95% of the tested events. modifications were also detected in somatic embryo cultures, and these should result in soybean lines with germinal modifications. differences between agrobacterium- and particle bombardment-mediated transformation were observed and may be important considerations for transformation experiments. to facilitate crispr mutagenesis efforts, a series of crispr vectors and a novel grna cloning method were produced.

RESULTS
knock-out of a gfp transgene
the first test of the crispr system in soybean was with a gfp -expressing soybean line, as gfp knock-outs are easily observed by a loss of fluorescence. two gfp-targeting grna vectors were designed; one grna was designed to target the 5′ end of gfp  and a second was designed to target the 3′ end  . the vectors were introduced into the gfp line via a. rhizogenes to produce hairy roots. fifteen out of  <dig> 5′-target events and four of the  <dig> 3′-target events were knock-outs as evident by a loss of fluorescence under blue-light . controls containing either cas <dig> or the grnas alone, all fluoresced . since the gfp soybean line used is homozygous for gfp, these results show that the crispr system is able modify both gfp alleles, which is the only way to get loss of fluorescence.figure  <dig>

custom-amplicon sequencing was used to determine the genetic modifications at the gfp transgene. the most abundant mutations at the 5′-target were short  deletions . for event  <dig>  a wild-type sequence was observed in 16% of the reads, which is consistent with fluorescent imaging . the 3′-target is less efficient; wild-type sequences were observed in seven of the events, with one event being completely unmodified . events with wild-type and modified sequences may be due to a single gfp allele being modified, or to the presence of chimeric tissues. four of the 3′-target events contained snps and one event contained a t insertion, whereas the 5′-target events did not contain any snps or insertions. a single snp at the 3′-target was routinely observed in the modified events and cas <dig> control and may be due to errors during library preparation or sequencing.

modifying a soybean gene
given the successful modifications of the gfp targets, the next attempt was to modify the single-copy soybean gene, glyma07g <dig>  which is a putative glucosyl-transferase. glyma07g <dig> custom amplicons from ten independent events were sequenced, and these showed a variety of mutations, including deletions, snps, insertions, and replacements . replacements are defined as two or more bases that were incorporated after a deletion event. three events contained only modified sequences, six events had both wild-type and modified sequences, and one event had no modifications. these results indicate that both mono- and biallelic modifications were made and/or chimeric tissues were present.

targeting gene pairs
soybean is a paleopolyploid  <cit>  and thus most genes have a homoeolog. for functional genomic studies, it would be beneficial if the crispr system could be used to target a homoeologous gene-pair singly and at the same time. to test this, the soybean genes glyma01g <dig> and glyma11g <dig>  were targeted. three grnas were designed; one to target glyma01g <dig> , one to target glyma11g <dig> , and a third to target both . both single-targeting grnas resulted in average indel frequencies greater than 70% . for 01gddm <dig>  eight events had indel frequencies between 87-97%. two events only had indel frequencies of 1-2%, but these were still higher than the cas <dig> control . all but one of the 11gddm <dig> events had indel frequencies greater than 95% . the 01gddm <dig> grna was specific for the intended chr <dig> target, but the 11gddm <dig> grna led to a small but detectable level  of off-target modifications at the chr <dig> sequence .figure  <dig>

genetic modifications at both ddm <dig> genes were detected in events containing the 01g + 11gddm <dig> grna, but the average indel frequency was only 21% for chr <dig> and  <dig> % for chr <dig> . average indel frequencies greater than 97% were observed in events targeting a different homoeologous gene pair glyma04g <dig> and glyma06g <dig> , suggesting that the lower indel frequency of the 01g + 11gddm <dig> vector is due to the grna itself and not a result of targeting multiple genes at once.

it is noteworthy that unique insertions of the a. rhizogenes root-inducing  plasmid  were present in two 11gddm <dig> events. the ri insertions were identified in  <dig> % of the reads from event  <dig> and  <dig> % of the reads from event  <dig>  both insertions are from the left-border end of the ri plasmid, approximately  <dig> kb apart from each other. cloning and sequencing of event  <dig> showed a 252-bp insertion from the ri plasmid . these results are particularly interesting since it should be possible to increase the chances of obtaining targeted insertions, as has been shown with other nuclease systems  <cit> .

targeting mir genes
micrornas  are small rna molecules responsible for regulating a wide range of processes in plants  <cit> . micrornas are encoded by mir genes that are typically short , non-coding sequences. these features, coupled with the genetic redundancy of mir families, may decrease the likelihood of isolating mir mutants in mutagenesis screens  <cit> . thus, the specific targeting of cas <dig>  and the large number of targets for any given gene, may make the cas <dig> system well suited for generating mir mutants. two soybean mirnas, mir <dig> and mir <dig> were targeted with cas <dig>  the short length of the mir genes limited the number of possible cas <dig> targets. finding a mir <dig> target near the mature mirna was particularly difficult. since mismatches are tolerated on the 5′ end of the grna  <cit> , a c to g mismatch between the target and grna was made on the 5′ base  to get a target close to the mature mirna. indel frequencies greater than 95% were observed in all four mir1509-, and three out of four mir1514-targeted events. none of the short deletions  were within the mature mirna sequences, thus, none of the mutations are expected to alter the production of the mirnas. however, these results demonstrate that short, non-coding sequences, such as mirs, can be readily targeted by the crispr/cas system.

genetic modification of somatic embryos
hairy roots are an excellent transgenic model system for soybean, however, they cannot generate whole plants, and therefore heritable mutations cannot be made. to evaluate crispr mutagenesis in whole plants, somatic embryo cultures of soybean were biolistically transformed with cas <dig> constructs. eight glyma07g <dig> and  <dig> 01g + 11gddm <dig> hygromycin-resistant events were recovered. although each event contained portions of the grna and cas <dig> genes as determined by pcr , only two glyma07g <dig> and three 01g + 11gddm <dig> events contained a complete cas <dig> gene as determined by long-distance pcr . when hairy-root events  were screened, a full cas <dig> product was observed in all ten events . these results suggest that the cas <dig> gene fragmented during biolistic-mediated transformation, but not upon agrobacterium-mediated transformation.figure  <dig>

as with other cas <dig> systems  <cit> , the continued activity of cas <dig> in the somatic embryos resulted in additional genetic modifications. dna samples were taken from all events once there was enough tissue, approximately 2- <dig> weeks after selection, and used for amplicon sequencing. at this first sequencing time-point, event  <dig> had approximately  <dig>  % modified sequences on chr <dig> and chr <dig>  whereas events  <dig> and  <dig> had none. although individual modified sequences made up fewer than 1% of the reads in event  <dig> , such deletions were not observed in any of the other  <dig> events sequenced, indicating that these deletions were not due to sequencing errors. when dna was collected approximately two weeks after the first sequencing experiment, the indel frequency increased to  <dig> % in event  <dig>  events  <dig> and  <dig> had 20% and 4-5% modified sequences, respectively, for both targets .

the two glyma07g <dig> events did not survive tissue culture and no modifications were detected in dna from somatic embryos . individual embryos from event  <dig> range in indel frequency from 0-14%, with most of the events at 4% . therefore continued expression of cas <dig> leads to additional mutations during the development of these embryos.

mutation efficiency
of the nine targeting vectors used in this study, seven resulted in average indel frequencies greater than 70% . this mutation efficiency is ten-fold higher than the 3- <dig> % obtained with transcription-activator like effector nucleases  in soybean hairy roots  <cit> .

in hairy roots, the 01g + 11gddm <dig> vector had the lowest average, with 21% and  <dig> % for the chr <dig> and chr <dig> targets, respectively. a similar frequency was observed in the somatic embryos . it should be noted that the 01g + 11gddm <dig> grna is one base shorter than the rest of the grnas in this study . however, this target length has been used in plants  <cit> , and shorter grnas  have been shown to be as effective as the commonly used grna  in cultured human cells  <cit> . it seems unlikely that a shorter grna led to a decrease it indel frequency, but a thorough testing of grna lengths in plants has not been reported. although each of the vectors had a range of indel frequencies, only four out of  <dig>  hairy-roots were unmodified, demonstrating that crispr mutagenesis in soybean is a robust system.

the three 01g + 11gddm <dig> somatic-embryo events with the complete cas <dig> gene contained targeted genetic modifications. these were three out of  <dig> hygromycin-resistant lines. these data demonstrate that when the complete cas <dig> is incorporated, genetic modifications are made, although the complete cas <dig> gene is only incorporated in  <dig> % biolistically-transformed events. of the recent reports of crisprs being used in plants, several have shown the recovery of whole-plants. one publication reported the biolistic transformation of rice, in which  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the t <dig> rice plants recovered contained mutations at their respective targets  <cit> . in this report, the cas <dig> and grna cassettes were located on separate plasmids, and it is unclear if the complete cas <dig> and grna cassettes were incorporated in all events. in contrast, transgenic a. thaliana and rice plants transformed with agrobacterium tumefaciens had efficiencies of 20-90% for several targets  <cit> . our data suggest that the disparity between biolistic and agrobacterium-mediated transformation could be due to incomplete incorporation of the complete cas <dig> gene upon biolistic-mediated transformation.

types of mutations
the types of mutations obtained here are similar to those observed in soybean and other plants obtained with zfns  <cit> , talens  <cit>  and crisprs  <cit> ; small deletions were the most frequent mutations; snps were less common .

the different targeting sequences tested led to a distinctive gamut of mutations. the seven most effective vectors almost exclusively generated short deletions, whereas the lower efficiency vectors contained more insertions/snps . of the ten 07g <dig> events, seven had insertions of one or more bases. these results suggest that the differences were determined by either the target sequence or the grna. therefore, multiple targeting vectors may be needed for any potential target sequence, depending on the frequencies/types of mutations desired. obtaining a greater variety of mutations may be desirable when the intent is to produce an allelic series.

the types of mutations between the hairy-root events and somatic embryos are consistent between chromosomal targets and between transformation methods. within the ten 01g + 11gddm <dig> hairy-root events, six contained an a insertion on chr <dig> at the same position. from those same ten events, five contained an a insertion on the homoeologous target on chr <dig> . each of the somatic-embryo events has the same a insertion for both chr <dig> and chr <dig>  and in many cases, it is the most abundant read . given the consistent insertion pattern, it is tempting to speculate that there may be rules governing the types of mutations that are possible for a given target.

evaluation of off-target modifications
one limitation of the crispr system is the potential for off-target modifications, i.e., the modification of sequences similar to the intended target sequence  <cit> . to determine the extent to which there may be off-target modifications, putative off-target sites were identified for the glyma07g <dig>  ddm <dig>  met <dig>  and mir <dig> vectors. each putative off-target site has two to six mismatches relative to the grna .

two grnas created off-target mutations. the 11gddm <dig> chr <dig> off target was modified in 2-13% of the sequenced reads, which is considerably lower than the indel frequency at the intended chr <dig> target . when off-targeting occurred at mir <dig> 18g, there was a range of frequencies; 100%, 25%, and 5%. the 07g14530-15g and -17g off-target loci had indel frequencies of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. however, the increased indel frequencies were also observed in the cas <dig> control, showing that they were due to sequencing errors caused by long stretches of t’s in the amplicons. these results indicate that while off-targeting does occur, at least for the tested grnas, it is not common, and was generally at a much lower frequency than at the intended target.

grna vector construction
in this work, a rapid cloning method  was developed to create new grnas. it consists of a single pcr reaction with two 41-bp primers and an in-fusion® reaction and can be used to clone any grna target sequence. the puc grna shuttle vector makes the construction of grnas simple and inexpensive. the use of the in-fusion® cloning system has the benefit of reducing handling steps, to the point where it should be simple to automate the entire cloning process. binary cas <dig> vectors with four different selectable makers  were also created to facilitate plant transformation experiments.

CONCLUSIONS
this work shows that the cas <dig> system is functional in two stably transformed plant systems, hairy roots and somatic embryos. it was possible to efficiently mutate all  <dig> loci chosen for testing; only two of the targeting vectors resulted in detectable off-target mutations at predicted off-target loci. the different grna targets produced different types of mutations. combined with a vector system developed to efficiently assemble the necessary grnas, these results confirm that the crispr system will be a simple and inexpensive method for genome editing in soybean, thus facilitating the use of genome editing to confirm candidate genes, develop novel alleles/phenotypes, and engineer plants with important agronomic or quality traits.
