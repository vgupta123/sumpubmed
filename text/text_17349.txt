BACKGROUND
sirt <dig> is a nad+ dependent class iii histone deacetylase that shares homology with yeast silent information regulator, sir <dig>  sirt <dig> is primarily a nuclear protein that shuttles to the cytoplasm depending upon the cell type and stress  <cit> . sirt <dig> targets histones and non-histones proteins that are involved in the regulation of several physiological processes including mitochondrial biogenesis, antioxidant defence mechanisms, dna repair, apoptosis and genomic stability  <cit> . sir <dig> promotes lifespan extension in yeast  <cit>  and brain specific overexpression of its mammalian homologue, sirt <dig> has been reported to delay ageing in sirt <dig> overexpressing female and male transgenic mice  <cit> . in support of this protective effect in ageing, sirt <dig> is also implicated in life span extension in mice that are either calorie restricted  <cit>  or on standard diet  <cit> . these studies show that sirt <dig> when activated or overexpressed in a tissue-specific manner can slow down ageing and enhance life span.

parkinson’s disease  is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after alzheimer’s disease  and the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder  <cit> . the characteristic pathological features of the disease are the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurones in the substantia nigra and the accumulation of α-synuclein rich lewy bodies and lewy neurites in brain stem, spinal cord and cortical regions  <cit> . the causes of pd are still unknown, although several environmental and genetic risk factors are suggested as being causative. ageing is however, the largest single risk factor for the development and progression of neurodegeneration by affecting a number of key cellular processes. at the molecular level, apoptosis, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction have been shown to promote neurodegeneration. sirt <dig> has shown to inhibit apoptosis by regulating p <dig>  reducing oxidative stress by regulating antioxidant defences via foxo family members, and regulates mitochondrial biogenesis mediated by pgc-1α  <cit> . sirt <dig> also maintains genomic stability by modulating histone acetylation. sirt <dig> has been shown to exert neuroprotection against oxidative stress. in models of pd, rotenone and mpp+ are known to reduce sirt <dig> in primary cultures which may imply that due to reduction of sirt <dig>  neurones have reduced ability to combat oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction  <cit> . sirt <dig> is neuroprotective by deacetylating and consequently activating pgc-1α and maintains mitochondrial homeostasis by elevating antioxidant defences against mptp mediated neurotoxicity  <cit> .

given the possible protective role of sirt <dig> in pd, we evaluated the role of sirt <dig> and its enzymatic activity in oxidative stress mediated cell death and also characterised the involvement of sirt <dig> in pd. the effects of over-expression and deacetylase activity of sirt <dig> on cell survival and α-synuclein aggregate formation were determined in diquat or rotenone treated sh-sy5y cells. protein expression and activity of sirt <dig> was also determined in post-mortem human brain tissue obtained from patients with pd, pd with dementia , dementia with lewy bodies  and ad.

methods
sh-sy5y cell culture
sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells were obtained from the european collection of cell cultures  and cultured as described previously  <cit> . cells were grown at 37 °c in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air/5% co <dig> 

sirt <dig> overexpression and toxin treatment in sh-sy5y cells
wild type sirt <dig>  and catalytically inactive sirt1h363y  plasmids  <cit>  were obtained from addgene and sub-cloned in plenti cmv blast  and empty plenti cmv blast wild type served as a control  <cit> . sh-sy5y cells were seeded in  <dig> well plates and the cells were transfected with sirt <dig> or sirt1h363y plasmid  and the control group was transfected with empty plenti cmv plasmids using pei  and plasmids were incubated with cells at 37 °c for 48 h. stably transfected cells were also studied following selection of lines using 5 µg/ml blasticidin and amplification of lines. transfected cells were treated with either diquat  dissolved in pbs  or rotenone  dissolved in dmso  at a final concentration of  <dig> % pbs/dmso and incubated overnight for 20 h. cell viability was determined by alamar blue reduction assay  <cit> .

western blotting
following alamar blue fluorescence, cell lysates were prepared by scraping the viable cells in native lysis buffer ,  <dig>  m sucrose, 1% triton x- <dig>  1× protease inhibitor cocktail). the cell lysates were sonicated for 20 s using a sonic probe and the total protein determined using bradford assay . twenty micrograms of protein in cell lysates were subjected to electrophoresis and were probed using selected antibodies in a manner as described previously  <cit>  using gapdh as a housekeeping internal loading control protein.

fluorescence immunocytochemistry
sh-sy5y cells were grown in chamber slides  and were transfected with sirt <dig> plasmids and treated with diquat or rotenone. the cells were washed with pbs and slides incubated with 4% formaldehyde  in warm 1× pbs for 15 min and then washed with pbs and stored until use in 10% glycerol  at 4 °c. cells were washed and blocked in 1× pbs/5% goat serum/ <dig> % triton x- <dig> for an hour then incubated overnight at 4 °c with anti-sirt <dig>  and anti-phospho-α-synuclein  for α˗synuclein aggregates. cells were washed with pbs and incubated with secondary antibodies  for 60 min protected from light. cells were washed with pbs and counterstained and mounted with prolong gold antifade mountant with dapi . images were acquired using a zeiss axioplan  <dig> microscope  with a 40× objective and images captured at 1024 × 1024 pixel resolution for analysis. images were quantified using imagej . phospho-α-synuclein aggregate immunoreactivity was determined by using a standardised custom histogram based coloured thresholding technique and then subjected to analyse particles in imagej. the parameters recorded were total area and percentage area of staining.

post-mortem tissue analysis
brain samples were obtained from newcastle brain tissue resource, a human tissue authority licensed tissue bank. tissue was obtained at post-mortem as soon as possible after death and samples snap frozen and stored at −80 °c. frozen tissue of the relevant region was identified and protein homogenates from pd, dlb, pdd, ad and control  were prepared by homogenising approximately 250 mg of freshly thawed grey matter in  <dig>  ml of  <dig>  m triethylammonium bicarbonate containing 1× protease inhibitor. after addition of 10 µl of 10% sds to 500 µl of homogenate, samples were vortexed and then sonicated using a sonic probe for 15 s, followed by sonication on ice in a sonic bath for 40 min. the concentration of protein was determined by bradford assay. western blotting was performed as previously  <cit>  using gapdh as a housekeeping internal loading control protein.table  <dig> details of brain samples used for western blot and immunohistochemistry

sirtuin activity
brain protein homogenates were thawed and vortexed and sonicated as previously and samples spun down at 100×g at 4 °c for 5 min and the protein concentration of supernatant was determined by bradford assay. fluorescent sirt substrate , ac-rhkk-amc was synthesised by cambridge research biolabs, uk. stock peptide was prepared as a 5 mm solution in diluted sirt assay buffer  and was stored at -70 °c until use. total sirt activity was determined by using 30 μg protein in substrate buffer containing  <dig>  µm peptide, 1 mm nad+ and 100 nm trichostatin a  and incubated at room temperature for 2 h on a shaker. after 2 h  <dig>  μg/ml trypsin in 50 mm nicotinamide  was added to stop further deacetylation and to cleave the deacetylated product. the fluorescence was recorded for each well after 1 h of incubation of the trypsin-nam solution in the plate reader on excitation wavelength of 350–360 nm and emission wavelength of 450–460 nm. sirt <dig> activity was determined as ex <dig>  inhibitable activity. .

statistical analyses
statistical analysis was performed using one-way anova within groups and two-way anova within two groups using spss <dig>  followed by appropriate post hoc  non-parametric testing. error bars represent standard deviation . p <  <dig>  was considered statistically significant. statistical analysis of western blotting data was performed in graphpad prism using a two samples t test assuming unequal variances using protein/gapdh ratios. statistical significance was considered as p <  <dig> . the results are presented as mean ± sd.

RESULTS

sirt <dig> protects sh-sy5y cells by reducing expression of nf-кb and cleaved parp-1
overexpression of sirt <dig> in diquat or rotenone treated sh-sy5y cells, rescued cells from oxidative stress. to test the possible mechanism behind this protection, cells were probed for nf-κb. the levels of nf-κb were reduced by 32–35% in sirt1wt  and by 23–24% in sirt1h363y  cells treated with  <dig> % pbs compared with plenti cmv transfected cells . in diquat treated cells, the levels of nf-κb were reduced by 50–55% in sirt1wt  cells and by 35–40% in sirt1h363y  when compared to  <dig> % pbs treated control cells. on the other hand, in plenti cmv transfected cells, diquat treatment enhanced the level of nf-κb by ~50%  compared to  <dig> % pbs treatment . in rotenone treated cells, the levels of nf-κb in  <dig> % dmso treated cells were reduced by ~ <dig> and ~25% in sirt1wt  and sirt1h363y  transfected cells, respectively, compared to plenti cmv transfected cells . following rotenone treatment, the levels of nf-κb were reduced by approximately 55% in sirt1wt cells  and by approximately 35% in sirt1h363y , whilst in plenti cmv transfected cells the levels were elevated by 55–60% in rotenone treated cells . following toxin treatments  in all cells the levels of sirt <dig> were reduced by 45–50% compared to  <dig> % vehicle treatment . we also analysed the expression of active cleaved poly  polymerase  under oxidative stress and observed that sirt <dig> overexpression reduced the protein level of cparp- <dig>  and similar result was also observed in sirt1h363y transfected cells, , compared to plenti cmv transfected cells . western blot analysis failed to detect the levels of cleaved caspase  <dig>  a finding that has been observed previously  <cit> .fig.  <dig> expression of nf-κb in toxin treated sh-sy5y. sirt1wt and sirt1h363y were over-expressed in sh-sy5y cells and control cells were transfected with empty vector following which cells were treated with diquat  or rotenone  for 20 h. cells were harvested and the samples were probed for nf-κb. data are presented as fold-untreated  from three independent assays  with comparison to gapdh as a housekeeping control protein. ***p <  <dig>  when compared to  <dig> % pbs, one-way anova , ###p <  <dig>  when compared to empty vector treatment, ~~~p <  <dig> , ~~p <  <dig>  and ~p <  <dig>  when compared to sirt1wt cells, two-way anova . images are representative blot of nf-κb and gapdh

sirt <dig> shows minimal co-localisation with α-synuclein but reduces aggregate formation
sirt <dig> is generally localised to the nucleus and depending upon environmental cues and cell types, and can translocate to the cytoplasm  <cit>  and also to mitochondria  <cit> . nuclear sirt <dig> targets the proteins involved in dna repair, antioxidant defence, genomic stability and apoptosis  <cit> , whereas localisation of sirt <dig> in the cytoplasm augments cells sensitivity to apoptosis  <cit> . in diquat or rotenone treated cells, sirt <dig> was predominantly localised to the nucleus with lower levels of protein observed in the cytoplasm in plenti cmv, sirt1wt or sirt1h363y transfected sh-sy5y cells . nuclear localisation of sirt <dig> correlates with its pro-survival activity under oxidative stress. in the nucleus, sirt <dig> targets foxo family members and promotes the expression of proteins involved in antioxidant defence mechanisms and simultaneously inhibits the expression of targets involved in promotion of apoptosis  <cit>  and also enhances dna repair  <cit> .fig.  <dig> localisation of sirt <dig> and phospho-α-synuclein in toxin treated sh-sy5y cells. cellular distribution of sirt <dig> and phospho-α-synuclein was determined using fluorescent immunocytochemistry. images show α-synuclein immunostaining, sirt <dig> immunostaining and all staining merged including dapi in a 20 μm diquat and b 20 μm rotenone treated cells. scale bars—white scale bar 50 μm and red scale bar 20 μm; magnification: ×40




under basal conditions, we observed small punctate cytoplasmic accumulations of phosphor-α-synuclein staining which was reduced following sirt1wt treatment  but not with catalytically inactive sirt1h363y transfected cells. on treatment with diquat or rotenone, a significant reduction in the number of phospho-α-synuclein aggregates was observed in both sirt1wt and sirt1h363y transfected cells compared to plenti cmv transfected cells . sirt <dig> showed minimal co-localisation with phospho-α-synuclein hence its effect on aggregate formation could possibly be through a positive action on ros scavenging. compared to sirt1wt transfected cells, phospho-α-synuclein aggregation was higher in sirt1h363y transfected cells .fig.  <dig> phospho-α-synuclein aggregate formation in toxin treated sh-sy5y cells. sirt1wt and sirt1h363y overexpressing sh-sy5y cells were treated with toxin  and  <dig> % pbs or dmso; cells transfected with empty vector were used as a control. cells were immunostained with phospho-α-synuclein. images were captured through gfp filter under × <dig> magnification. the captured images represent phospho-α-synuclein staining and the bar graphs represent the aggregate quantification in diquat or rotenone treated cells. each bar represents % phospho-α-synuclein aggregates  from three independent assays . ***p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig>  and *p <  <dig>  when compared to  <dig> % vehicle, one-way anova , ###p <  <dig>  and ##p <  <dig>  when compared to control cells, ~~~p <  <dig>  and ~p <  <dig>  when compared to sirt1wt overexpressing cells, two-way anova . scale bar 20 μm




sirt <dig> protein in neurodegenerative disorders
we determined sirt <dig> protein and enzyme activity in post mortem human brain tissue in pd and other neurodegenerative disorders. two isoforms of sirt <dig> protein are known , sirt1fl; predicted molecular weight 80 kda) however the observed molecular weight on western blot is ~120 kda possibly due to post translational modifications  <cit>  along with a shorter form, isoform  <dig>  of approximately 75 kda. the 120 kda sirt <dig> isoform was observed only in frontal cortex samples and sirt <dig> isoform  <dig> was observed only in the temporal cortex samples.

in the frontal cortex samples of pd, the levels of 120 kda sirt <dig> were reduced by 28% compared to controls  whereas no significant difference was observed in the levels of sirt1fl . in the temporal cortex samples from pd cases, the levels of 80 kda sirt1fl were elevated by 15%  and 75 kda isoform  <dig> were elevated by 36%  compared to controls. in the putamen or cerebellum of pd cases, no significant differences were observed in the levels of 80 kda sirt1fl isoform when compared to control .fig.  <dig> expression of sirt <dig> protein in post mortem brain in parkinson’s disease. the levels of sirt <dig> were determined in different regions of parkinson’s disease  patients and compared to a control-cohort. sirt <dig> band intensity was normalised with gapdh as a housekeeping protein. data are presented as fold change  with respect to control from three independent replicates of sirt1/gapdh. ***p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig>  and *p <  <dig>  . images are representative blots of sirt <dig> and gapdh. m denotes molecular weight marker lane

sirt <dig> activity in neurodegenerative disorders
in the frontal cortex, measurement of total sirt activity did not show any significant change between the disease groups and control ; however, compared to ad, the total sirt activity was reduced in pd and dlb by about 20% , though pdd did not show any significant difference. specific sirt <dig> activity was down regulated in pd , pdd , dlb  and ad  compared to controls . in the temporal cortex, there was no significant difference in total sirt activity between the disease groups and control , however, compared to ad there was a significant reduction of 33% in total sirt activity in pdd , though other groups did not show any significant change. sirt <dig> activity was reduced in pd , pdd , dlb  and ad  compared to controls  whereas no significant difference was seen among the disease groups .fig.  <dig> total sirtuin activity and specific sirt <dig> activities in frontal and temporal cortex in neurodegeneration. total sirt and sirt <dig> activities were measured using a fluorometric enzymatic activity assay with specific sirt <dig> inhibition in the frontal and temporal cortices of pd, pdd, dlb and ad patients and were compared to cohort-control group. ***p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig>  and *p <  <dig>  when compared to control, one-way anova 




discussion
oxidative stress is an imbalance between the production of free radicals and antioxidant defence that leads to dna, protein and lipid damage that may eventually lead to cell death. oxidative stress has been suggested to play a role in the development and progression of neurodegenerative disorders  <cit> . sirt <dig>  a nad+ dependent deacetylase, is a redox sensor and has been shown to regulate key cellular processes including antioxidant defence, dna repair and genomic stability  <cit> . in this context, we determined the role of sirt <dig> in cell survival under oxidative stress. the results of our study showed increased cell survival in sirt1wt and sirt1h363y transfected cells compared to control cells, nonetheless, sirt1wt showed the highest rate of cell survival. in sn <dig> da neurones, mudo et al.  <cit>  reported the protective effect of sirt <dig> following mptp treatment cells which was mediated through activation of pgc-1α leading to enhanced expression of the mitochondrial antioxidants manganese superoxide dismutase and thioredoxin- <dig>  in a recent study it was shown that sirt <dig> alleviated rotenone induced cell death in sh-sy5y cells by regulating expression of histone h <dig> and p <dig>  <cit> . the present results are in line with these findings and establishes the pro-survival role of sirt <dig> against oxidative stress induced by diquat or rotenone in sh-sy5y cells.

the findings of our study also show that the protection conferred by sirt <dig> was partly independent of its deacetylase activity as the enzymatic inactive sirt <dig> h363y mutant also protected the cells from diquat or rotenone induced cell death. similar to the findings of this study, pfister et al., showed that sirt1wt and mutant forms lacking deacetylase activity  protected cerebellar granule neurones from low-potassium induced toxicity, though in their study the extent of protection by mutant forms was similar to sirt1wt  <cit> . the difference between their and our study could be attributed to the type of cell used and also the trigger causing cellular stress but does indicate that effects of sirt <dig> can be independent of deacetylase activity.

the protection conferred by sirt <dig> appears to be mediated at least in part through suppression of nf-кb expression, similar to the effect of sirt <dig> on nf-кb observed by ghosh et al., who reported that sirt <dig> and sirt1h363y repressed nf-кb activity  <cit> . nf-кb transcription factors regulate inflammation and immunity processes  <cit>  and also play an important role in cell growth and development, and apoptosis  <cit> . ros in cells are known to activate nf-кb leading to transactivation of targets involved in protection against ros  <cit>  and under high oxidative stress, activation of nf-кb enhances cell death  <cit> . the results from our study show that sirt <dig> protects cells from oxidative stress in part by repressing the expression of nf-кb suggesting that possibly nf-кb enhances cell death on treatment with diquat or rotenone.

parp- <dig>  is a nuclear protein involved in detection and repair of dna damage and is also activated during apoptosis and necrosis  <cit>  and sirt <dig> conferred protection to cells by reducing the levels of cleaved parp- <dig>  following diquat or rotenone exposure. rajamohan et al.  <cit>  showed that sirt <dig> deacetylates parp- <dig> under stress resulting in reduction of parp- <dig> mediated cell death. they also observed that sirt <dig> negatively regulates the parp- <dig> gene promoter and controls the parp- <dig> expression at a transcriptional level. the results from our study are in accord with these findings with reduced levels of cleaved parp- <dig> protein in both sirt <dig> wt and sirt1h363y cells possibly via a mechanism independent of the deacetylase activity of sirt <dig> through transcriptional changes.

lewy bodies  composed of abnormally folded and aggregated α-synuclein proteins, are a characteristic feature of pd and other lewy bodies disorders  <cit> . α-synuclein is a small pre-synaptic protein that undergoes oligomerisation and aggregation resulting in fibrillation and formation of lbs. several factors trigger oligomerisation of α-synuclein including oxidative stress and in this study, we observed a low level of basal phosphor-α-synuclein accumulation which was reduced slightly by sirt <dig> overexpression. we also observed that under conditions of oxidative stress, over-expression of sirt1wt reduced the formation of phospho-α-synuclein aggregates and sirt1h363y showed a similar effect when compared to control cells. interestingly, sirt <dig> was not seen to co-localise with phospho-α-synuclein suggesting that the effect of sirt <dig> on the aggregate formation is indirect, independent of deacetylase activity, possibly through elevation of cellular anti-oxidant defence mechanisms.

neurodegenerative disorders typically present pathologically with loss of neurones in the cns. the causes of neurodegenerative disorders are still under investigation, although environmental and known genetic risk factors are suggested to initiate these disorders, with oxidative stress being associated with initiation and progression of neurodegenerative disorders  <cit> . sirt <dig> has been shown to modulate and repress the damage caused by oxidative stress. in this study, no major alterations were observed in the levels of sirt <dig> protein in pd or pdd, whilst the levels of sirt <dig> showed a slight non-significant elevation in dlb. however, in ad, the levels of sirt <dig> protein were reduced in all brain regions. pallas et al., analysed the expression of sirt <dig> in pd , dlb  in the frontal cortex compared to controls  and observed no changes between the groups  <cit> . in the current study no major difference was seen in expression of sirt <dig> protein in pd but slightly elevated levels of the protein were observed in dlb. the inconsistencies between the previous and current studies could possibly be explained by group sizes with in the current study, the number of cases being larger. a significant reduction in the level of sirt <dig> protein was observed in ad and this is most likely explained by the greater degree of cortical atrophy seen in ad and the loss of neuronal or synaptic sirt <dig>  <cit> . to further assess the role of sirt <dig>  activity was measured and compared to control, with sirt <dig> activity reduced in all disease groups although no significant difference was seen between disease groups. the lower sirt <dig> activity in all disease groups correlates with possible higher oxidative stress, synaptic and cell loss, and neuroinflammation in neurodegeneration, and also with current findings of reduced sirt <dig> levels in sh-sy5y cells during oxidative stress . the differences in enzyme activity and protein expression may be related to the different isoforms found in brain tissue having different enzymatic effects with some isoforms being more catalytically active than others. studies have reported that oxidative stress and inflammation are upregulated in neurodegenerative disorders  <cit> . sirt <dig> has been shown to alleviate the damage induced by oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. thus, down regulation of sirt <dig> protein and activity in disease groups could be associated with generalised neurodegeneration observed in these disorders and the associated synaptic and neuronal loss induced by chronic oxidative stress and neuroinflammation.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have shown that over-expression of sirt <dig> protected sh-sy5y cells from diquat or rotenone by down-regulating nf-кb and cparp- <dig> and reducing phospho-α-synuclein aggregates. the observed protection exerted by sirt <dig> is not entirely dependent on its deacetylase activity as the enzymatically inactive mutant of sirt <dig> also conferred a degree of protection to cells. in post-mortem human brain tissue, expression of sirt <dig> protein did not differ markedly in lewy body disorders whilst reductions in sirt <dig> expression was observed in ad, though the enzymatic activity was down-regulated in all groups compared to controls. based upon these findings it can be concluded that sirt <dig> is a pro-survival protein which is down-regulated under oxidative stress.
