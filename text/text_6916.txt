BACKGROUND
micrornas  are 20- to 23- nucleotide long single stranded rnas that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression  <cit> . mirnas act as translation inhibitors of mrna into protein and promote mrna degradation. in this way, mirnas play important role in various cell processes such as proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, development, cancer and various other diseases  <cit>  and thus represent potential targets for therapeutic applications. the biogenesis of mirnas is a complicated process involving two different cellular compartments  <cit> . first, in the nucleus, a primary mirna  is transcribed from the genomic dna by rna polymerase ii. the size of this primary product varies from 100- to 1000- nucleotides in length. then, the pri-mirna is truncated by drosha and dgcr <dig> to form a hairpin loop precursor called pre-mirna  <cit> . the 60â€“ <dig> nucleotide long pre-mirna is loaded to exportin  <dig> and ran-gtp in order to be exported into the cytoplasm. a mature mirna  is then released by the rnase iii endonuclease complex including dicer and trans-activator rna -binding protein trbp  <cit> . the mature mirna then inhibits translation of a mirna into a protein by imperfect base pairing to one or more mrna sequences  <cit> . the identification of human mirnas and their respective targets is of great importance and involves both computational and experimental approaches  <cit> . prediction servers such as targetscan  <cit> , miranda  <cit> , rnahybrid  <cit> , pictar  <cit>  and the recent one diana-microt  <dig>   <cit>  give information for the mirna-target interactions. recent reports have described correlated computational expression of mirna and their target mrnas and proteins giving a detailed functional description of the latest  <cit> . herein, we describe gomir  <cit> , a new stand-alone application for human mirnas target prediction and ontology clustering, consisting of two different components, jtarget and taggo. jtarget combines the data from four different prediction databases  and also from the experimental database tarbase  <cit> , whereas taggo gives detailed assignments from gene ontology  resources to gene products. taggo uses one of the most reliable biological ontologies, the gene ontology, the main goal of which is to provide a well structured, precisely defined and controlled vocabulary for describing the roles of genes and gene products in any organism. go was initiated back in  <dig>  as a collaborative effort to build consistency of gene product descriptions among different databases, initially including three model organisms. since then, many plant, animal and microbial genomes have been assimilated  <cit> . go was developed into three structured controlled vocabularies  that describe gene products in terms of their associated biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions in a species-independent manner  <cit> . thus, gomir serves as a reliable tool for mirna target prediction and more interestingly provides assignments from go resources for these gene products, exploring in this way the functional aspects of mirnas in more detail.

RESULTS
user interface
jtarget main goal is to find the target genes of a given mirna derived from  <dig> to  <dig> databases and compare any possible combination of the results from these databases. the available databases are targetscan, miranda, rnahybrid, pictar- <dig> way, pictar- <dig> way and tarbase. following the insertion of a specific mirna name,  <dig> possible scenarios are given. the user can obtain the resulting target genes from: a) one database only, b) two or more databases or c) all combined databases. jtarget contains text fields, buttons and one central text area for the interaction with the user . to find the target genes of a mirna from a single database, the "search by mirna" option has to be selected and a mirna name  should be given. then, a database  should be marked and the results are presented in the central text area by clicking the "find targets" button. the common results from  <dig> or more databases can be obtained by marking the desirable databases and clicking the "compare database results" button. the available databases are: targetscan, miranda, rnahybrid, pictar- <dig> way, pictar- <dig> way and the experimental one, tarbase. in this study, for the first time, the rnahybrid database sets were introduced in a computational program.

to obtain the common target genes results for a given mirna from all the databases , only the "compare all" button should be clicked without the necessity to select any databases . the databases, that give no results for a given mirna, are excluded from the procedure and the common target genes from the remaining databases are provided. the obtained results can be further compared to the experimentally supported targets provided, for a certain mirna, by clicking the tarbase button. in addition, it is possible to perform a reverse search. the user may enter a gene symbol  and obtain the common mirnas of the selected databases for the given gene. the jtarget includes datasets from pictar- <dig> way and the - <dig> way databases. both databases contain target prediction for all human mirnas based on conservation in mammals. the pictar- <dig> way includes human, mouse, rat, dog species datasets, whereas the 5-way includes also chicken species datasets. however, the insertion of pictar- <dig> way reduces the common target genes results to a significant degree. therefore, we decided to exclude this database from the calculation of the common target genes at the "compare all" procedure. the number of the predicted targets by searching one or more databases for mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> is shown in table  <dig> 

the results can be saved either before the search is accomplished, by filling the "enter the output file" text field, or by choosing "save text" after the completion of the search. then, the descriptions of the resulted target genes can be found by the "find genes description" application, where the full description of each gene is presented in the text area. in addition, the functions of each target gene can be found when the "find genes functions" is clicked. the information about the genes description and functions is obtained by the david bionformatics database  <cit> . in table  <dig>  the descriptions of the common genes from  <dig> databases predicted for the mir- <dig> are described. the functions of the common target genes predicted by the jtarget "find genes functions" procedure for mir- <dig> from all  <dig> databases are shown in table  <dig>  the blank cells next to certain genes mean that these genes are not contained in david's gene function database.

tarbase comparative analyses
as described in the previous section, tarbase was also inserted in the jtarget comparative module of gomir. tarbase describes in full detail the experimentally supported targets of  <dig> mirnas and also provides information for the nature of the experiments that were conducted to validate these results  <cit> . in order to understand the features of mirna targeting and to validate experimentally the bioinformatics prediction, we performed comparative analyses using prediction databases  and the experimental one, tarbase. an intersection analysis between each prediction database and tarbase was performed by calculating the total number of common targets between each prediction database and tarbase for all the mirnas available in tarbase . targetscan predictions, as documented in figure 2a, are validated experimentally in a higher rate compared to miranda, rnahybrid, pictar- <dig> way and pictar- <dig> way.

using as an example the mir- <dig>  targetscan predicts  <dig> targets, whereas miranda, rnahybrid, pictar- <dig> way and pictar- <dig> way predict  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> targets, respectively for the same microrna . gomir conducting analysis by comparing  <dig> databases  revealed  <dig> common predicted targets. however, tarbase has described up to date  <dig> experimentally supported targets  for mir- <dig>  whereas pdcd <dig> was also predicted by gomir comparative analysis of  <dig> out of  <dig> databases  and this may in turn explain the importance of selecting common targets between different predicting mirna databases.

gene ontology analysis by taggo
once a search is completed, a gene ontology clustering may be performed by clicking the "taggo" button. a temporary file is created from the output file of a jtarget search and is then used as an input file for taggo search. taggo interface consists of  <dig> steps . first, the user has to provide the path of the input file containing the proteins. when taggo is initiated through jtarget, the first step of taggo is done automatically, as the input file is provided directly by jtarget. the second step consists of the selection of the gene ontology file and its format. at the third step, the user is asked to choose the organism for which the clustering is going to be performed. however, for the present analysis the human checkbox should be selected. the user may then select the evidence codes to be included during the annotation process , may exclude some non-desired terms or may set a normalised information content threshold for the three aspects. the fifth step is to provide the program with an output directory. the output of the whole process is a directory called "results", which includes the charts for the visualization of the output, three venn lists for each go aspect and some text files with information about the process and its results. for example, according to taggo results for the common target genes for mir- <dig> from targetscan and miranda, the most abundant go term for cellular component go aspect is go: <dig> which corresponds to intracellular  and for molecular function go aspect is go: <dig> which corresponds to binding functions, respectively . a reverse search is possible to be performed in jtarget, using the "search by gene" option, in order to find the complementary mirnas for the given gene. searches for common mirnas from  <dig> to  <dig> databases are available as well.

mir- <dig> regulates tgf-Î² target in hela cells
a preliminary experimental approach was performed, in order to test whether a mirna could regulate a predicted target by gomir comparative analysis using  <dig> databases . tgf-Î²  was predicted by gomir as a target of mir- <dig> by  <dig> databases comparative analysis . hela cancer cell line is expressing tgf-Î² in a high level, thus was used as a model of tgf-Î² regulation by mir- <dig>  in order to determine whether mir- <dig> functions as a possible regulator of tgf-Î², hela cells were transiently transfected with mir- <dig> mimic, mir- <dig> antagonist or mir- <dig> scrambled antagonist. the levels of mir- <dig> in transfected and non-transfected hela cells were determined by real-time pcr and the transfection efficiency was established to 47â€“50% . by semi-quantitative rt-pcr analyses, using specific primers for tgf-Î², it was shown that the presence of mir- <dig> mimic resulted in a decrease  of tgf-Î² transcript at mrna level, whereas mir- <dig> antagonist led to an increase  of tgf-Î²  in hela cells, respectively. further experiments need to be conducted in order to fully verify the mir-21-tgf-Î² interaction and also the respective binding sites of mir- <dig> on the tgf-Î² mrna.

discussion
gomir, is a novel stand-alone application designed to elucidate the human mirna interactions with the respective targets by using the data sets retrieved by four different computationally mirna prediction databases, increasing in this way the validity of the results. in this study, rnahybrid database was inserted for the first time in a computational tool that combines the results from different mirna databases. the validity of the computational predicted targets is confirmed by recent experimental studies for certain mirnas. for example, gomir indicated nfi-a as possible target for mir- <dig> comparing  <dig> out of  <dig> databases . further experimental studies by fazi et al. confirmed this prediction and showed that mir- <dig> plays a crucial role during granulopoiesis by downregulating nfi-a  <cit> . gomir provides a detailed gene description of the predicted targets accompanied by a function analysis. a reverse search initiated by a potential target can also be performed to find the predicted interacting mirnas. comparison with the experimentally supported target database, tarbase, is also provided. in a second next step, a detailed gene ontology clustering, including all the respective graphic charts and diagrams for the predicted targets are provided by the taggo module of gomir. in this way, any group of human mirnas and respective targets can be analysed with functional and ontology information provided, easily, in a short period of time and without using a web-based interface. the resulted common targets among different databases for a given mirna may facilitate in selecting individuals for further experimental analyses. in this respect, our preliminary results on validating experimentally gomir comparative predictions showed that mir- <dig> regulate tgf-Î² expression at mrna level.

CONCLUSIONS
gomir, is a stand-alone application for studying mirna interactions with the respective targets by using the data sets retrieved by mirbase, targetscan, rnahybrid, pictar- <dig> way and pictar- <dig> way and also the experimental one tarbase. gomir provides a detailed gene description of the predicted targets accompanied by a function and gene ontology analyses.
