BACKGROUND
micrornas , initially discovered in c. elegans  <cit> , are a large group of small endogenous rnas  <cit>  that widely exist in animals  <cit> , plants  <cit> , and in some viruses  <cit> . increasing evidence demonstrates that mirnas play an important function in many biological and metabolic processes, including tissue identity, developmental timing, and response to environmental stress  <cit> . however, mirnas do not directly control plant growth and development. in contrast, mirnas negatively control gene expression by targeting protein coding gene mrnas for cleavage or repressing protein translation  <cit> .

mirnas are first transcribed from mirna genes, located mainly in the intergenic genomic region, by rna polymerase ii  <cit> . there are also a small number of mirna genes located inside the protein coding genes. for these mirnas, the transcription orientation is the same as the protein coding gene, indicating that they are transcribed together  <cit> . following transcription and several post-transcriptional modifications using different enzymes , long primary mirna transcripts  are processed to generate mirna precursors  and eventually mature mirnas  <cit> . although the length of mature mirna sequences varies from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides with an average of 22-nt, a majority of mature mirnas are  <dig> to 23-nt in length  <cit> . dcl <dig> is a key enzyme in mirna biogenesis and mutating this gene results in globally decreased mirna levels in plants, ultimately resulting in pleiotropic defects  <cit> . in addition, hen <dig> and hyl <dig> also play important roles in mirna biogenesis in plants; mutating these two genes results in severe defects during various developmental stages of plant growth, including vegetation maturity and proper formation of reproductive organs  <cit> .

mirnas are involved in plant responses to the environment and several mirnas are up-regulated or down-regulated by abiotic stress, including high salinity, drought, and low temperatures  <cit> . furthermore, the targets of several mirnas are genes that play important roles in stress tolerance, including the gene encoding cu/zn sod  <cit> . mir <dig> targets auxin receptor genes, such as tir <dig>  afb <dig>  and afb <dig>  which lower auxin signals and inhibit the pathogen p. syringae  <cit> . mirnas are also induced by pathogens, which suggests mirnas are involved in plant-microorganism interactions such as symbiosis events with legumes and rhizobia bacteria  <cit> . increasing evidence demonstrates that mirnas might provide a novel platform to better understand plant development and resistance to biotic as well as abiotic stresses.

currently,  <dig> mature mirnas have been discovered and deposited in the public available mirna database mirbase   <cit> . these mirnas include  <dig> mirnas from  <dig> plant species. although numerous mirnas have been identified in plants, a majority of them were obtained from model species such as oryza sativa , populus trichocarpa , physcomitrella patens , arabidopsis thaliana , and vitis vinifera . this could be attributed to the fact that the entire genomes of these organisms have already been sequenced and are readily available. even so, few mirnas have been reported in important agricultural crops. peanut is widely cultivated and is one of the most important economic and oil crops in china, the usa, and around the world. to date, no mirna-related research has been performed on peanuts.

there are two major methods used in identifying mirnas:  a direct cloning method, using mirna-enriched libraries, combined with computational and experimental verification  <cit>  and  computational identification. several investigations have shown that some mirnas are highly conserved throughout evolution and can be found in mosses to higher flowering plants  <cit>  this suggests a powerful strategy for identifying mirnas using comparative genomics. by performing blastn searches, using already known mirnas, against genbank databases including genome survey sequences , high through-put genomic sequences , expressed sequence tags , and non-redundant  nucleotides, hundreds of mirnas have been identified in plants. currently, several laboratories have adopted this method in order to identify mirnas  <cit> . however, this method is limited by the number of nucleotide sequences available in the database. for peanut, the genome has not been completely sequenced and there are only a limited number of peanut ests in the database. this does not make computational prediction an effective choice for discovering peanut mirnas. in this study, we employed the next generation high through-put sequencing technology to sequence and identify peanut mirnas. based on our study, we have identified  <dig> conserved mirnas as well as  <dig> novel mirnas in peanuts. quantitative real time pcr  analysis shows that these mirnas are expressed in peanuts.

RESULTS
peanut has a complex small rna population
to date,  <dig>  peanut ests, including  <dig>  ests from cultivated peanuts and  <dig>  ests from wild-type peanuts, have been deposited in the ncbi est database. these sequences are minor compared with the  <dig> -mb genome of the allotetraploid cultivated peanut or even the genome of the diploid wild-type peanut. previous studies have demonstrated, using computational approaches and est analysis, that only three conserved mirnas exist in peanut  <cit> . with the limited amount of peanut ests in the est database, it is not possible to perform a comprehensive study of peanut mirnas using only a computational analysis. experimental cloning and subsequent functional analysis, combined with computational prediction, appears to be the most effective method to identify peanut mirnas.

next generation high through-put sequencing, including  <dig> and solexa technologies, provides a powerful tool for mirna cloning. by using the high through-put solexa sequencing technology, a total of  <dig> , <dig> sequences were obtained from a small rna library, which was constructed from the cultivated peanut variety fenghua- <dig>  after removing the low quality sequences and adapter sequences,  <dig> , <dig> sequences were obtained with 3- <dig> nt in length, among which  <dig> , <dig> sequences ranged from 18- <dig> nt in length. after further removing trnas , rrnas , snrnas , and snornas , a total of  <dig> , <dig> small rna sequences were obtained. although some small rnas were very high in abundance and present thousands of times in our dataset, the majority of small rnas were sequenced only a few times. for example,  <dig> , <dig> out of  <dig> , <dig> small rnas were sequenced only one time in our experiment. this result suggests that  the expression of different small rnas in peanut varies drastically and  the small rna survey in peanut is far from saturated. this also suggests that peanut contains a large and diverse small rna population.

in peanut, the size of the small rnas was not evenly distributed . among these sequences, the number of 24-nt sequences was significantly greater than shorter or longer sequences  and accounted for 45% of the total sequence number. this result was consistent with that of medigcago  <cit>  and rice  <cit> , as well as arabidopsis  <dig> sequencing results  <cit> . in arabidopsis, the 24-nt small rnas accounted for about 60% of its small rna transcriptome  <cit> . however, the size distribution differs from wheat and conifer sequences obtained through  <dig> high through-put sequencing  <cit>  and chinese yew sequences obtained through solexa sequencing  <cit> . in conifer, the fraction of 24-nt rnas was very small  due to the lack of dcl <dig>  the enzyme that matures 24-nt rnas in angiosperms  <cit> . in total,  <dig>  sequences  with 21-nt, which is the typical length of plant mature mirnas, represented the second highest abundance of sequences in the peanut library.

identification of conserved peanut mirnas
to identify conserved mirnas in peanuts, all small rna sequences were blastn searched against the currently known mirnas in the mirna database mirbase . in total,  <dig>  known mirnas from diverse plant species were utilized in order to identify conserved peanut mirnas from the small rna dataset.

after blastn searches and further sequence analysis, a total of  <dig> conserved mirnas were identified in peanuts and these mirnas belong to  <dig> mirna families . of the  <dig> mirna families, three mirna families  were predicted  <cit>  using a comparative genomics-based strategy  <cit> . the identified mirna families have been shown to be conserved in a variety of plant species. for example, mir156/ <dig>  mir159/ <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> have been found in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> plant species, respectively  <cit> . in this study, we also tried to identify the precursor sequences for the  <dig> conserved peanut mirnas. however, due to the fact that the peanut genome has not been fully sequenced, the pre-mirnas and their secondary structures were only identified for nine mirnas .

the abbreviations represent: ath, arabidopsis thaliana; ptc, populus trichocarpa; vvi, vitis vinifera; osa, oryza sativa. the plus symbols indicate: ++, mirna sequences of peanut were exactly identical to those in other species; +, mirna sequences of peanut were conserved in other species but have variations in some nucleotide positions.

next generation high through-put sequencing provides an alternative way to estimate expression profiles of protein coding genes and/or mirna genes  <cit> . millions of peanut small rna sequences, generated from solexa sequencing, allowed us to determine the abundance of various mirna families and even distinguish between different members of a given family. interestingly, peanut mirna families displayed significantly varied abundance from each other. for example, ahy-mir157a, ahy-mir168a, and ahy-mir156a were detected  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  times respectively . in comparison to other plant species, tae-mir169b in wheat and osa-mir <dig> in rice were the most frequently sequenced mirnas while mir <dig> in rice and wheat exhibited low abundance  <cit> . this suggests a species-specific expression profile for mirnas. mir156a was also found to be highly expressed in another legume species, medicago  <cit> . in arabidopsis, mir156a, located on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , targets  <dig> mrnas that code for the squamosa promoter-binding protein  box, which is involved in leaf morphogenesis  <cit> . similar to mir156a, mir157a, which is located on chromosome  <dig> in arabidopsis thaliana, was thought to target mrnas coding for proteins comprising the sbp box  <cit> . however, the mechanisms, causing the differential expression profile of a same mirna in different plant species, are unknown. a majority of peanut mirnas were only sequenced less than  <dig>  times, and some rare mirnas were detected less than  <dig> times. compare with the most abundant mirna ahy-mir157a, their expression level is about  <dig>  times lower . mirnas of moderate abundance included ahy-mir157d, ahy-mir164a, ahy-mir166a, ahy-mir <dig> g, ahy-mir166a, ahy-mir167f, and ahy-mir172a were detected  <dig> - <dig>  times in the library. the relative abundance of the  <dig> conserved peanut mirna families is represented in figure  <dig> 

next generation high through-put sequencing technology also provides a method for distinguishing and measuring mirna sequences with only a few nucleotide changes. based on the results from the solexa sequencing, different family members displayed drastically different expression levels. for example, the abundance of mir <dig> family varied from  <dig> read  to  <dig>  reads  in the deep sequencing. this was also the case for some other mirna families, such as ahy-mir <dig>  and ahy-mir <dig> . the existence of a dominant member in a mirna family may suggest that the regulatory role of this family was performed by the dominant member at the developmental time when the samples were collected for rna extraction. abundance comparisons of different members in one mirna family, during various growth conditions or specific developmental stages, may provide valuable information on the role that mirnas play in plant growth. expression levels of two members of the ahy-mir <dig> family  were similar and were detected  <dig> and  <dig> times, respectively .

identification of novel peanut mirnas
in addition to the identification of conserved mirnas,  <dig> novel peanut mirna families were also identified . only one member was identified in each species-specific mirna family and the read number for each novel mirna was much lower than that for the conserved mirnas. this is consistent with previous conclusions indicating that non-conserved mirnas are usually expressed at lower levels and with a tissue- or developmental-specific pattern. therefore, mirnas identified in this study might represent only a small portion of novel mirna families found in peanut due to the fact that the small rna library was constructed from young peanut seedlings grown under normal conditions. precursors of these novel mirnas were identified and formed proper secondary hairpin structures, with free energies ranging from - <dig>  kcal mol- <dig> to - <dig> kcal mol- <dig>  . more importantly, the identification of an anti-sense mirna  from five novel mirna candidates provided more evidence to consider them as novel mirnas. to investigate the conservation of these  <dig> novel mirnas in a wide range of plant species, we used these  <dig> mirnas as query sequences to perform blastn searches against all nucleotide sequences in ncbi databases. no homologs were found in any plant species except mirn <dig>  which has a homolog in the soybean est cd <dig>  this suggests that these newly identified mirnas are all peanut-specific mirnas except mirn <dig> 

besides these  <dig> identified novel candidate mirnas, we also discovered two small rnas, with  <dig> and  <dig> reads in our small rna dataset, which correspond to phaseolus vugaris legume-specific mirs <dig> and mir <dig>  these two mirnas were able to detected in peanut by northern blot analysis  <cit> . interestingly, the expression of mir <dig> has previously been shown to be induced in phaseolus vugaris by abiotic stress, especially drought and aba treatment  <cit> . we did not include these two sequences in the list of novel peanut mirnas because we could not find their precursor sequences in the current databases. in addition to mirs <dig> and mir <dig>  we also found the third small rna with  <dig> reads in our dataset that had only one mismatch with phaseolus vugaris mir <dig> . a fourth 21-nt small rna with  <dig> reads was also identified in our dataset, which had  <dig> mismatches and one nucleotide missing to compare with phaseolus vugaris mir482*.

based on the number of detection times and sequences in the small rna library, novel peanut mirnas displayed lower expression levels compared to the majority of conserved families. the low abundance of novel mirnas might suggest a specific role for these mirnas under various growth conditions, in specific tissues, or during developmental stages. the library enriched only small rnas that play a role during early seedling stages under normal growth conditions. whether these low-abundant mirnas are expressed at higher levels in other tissues and organs, such as flowers, gynophores, pods, or seeds, or whether they are regulated by biotic or abiotic stress, remains to be investigated. future experiments would provide more insight into the function of these mirnas.

validation of peanut mirnas
stem-loop qrt-pcr is a reliable method for detecting and measuring the expression levels of mirnas. the stem-loop primers increase the sensitivity of the reactions such that this method can significantly distinguish two mirnas with only one single nucleotide change  <cit> . in this study, we adopted this technique to validate and measure the expression of  <dig> novel mirnas  as well as  <dig> conserved mirnas . all of these mirnas were identified in peanut by solexa sequencing. the qrt-pcr results demonstrate that all tested mirnas, and one mirna*, are expressed in peanut leaves . however, the expression levels of the different mirnas varied.

the results of the qrt-pcr reaction show that conserved mirnas are expressed in peanut. based on the threshold cycle , mir <dig> and mir <dig> were highly expressed with ct values of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively. in one of our previous studies, we also found that mir <dig> is highly expressed in cotton leaves  <cit> . other studies have shown that conserved mir <dig> and mir <dig> play very important roles in plant growth and development  <cit> . mir <dig> is involved in arabidopsis leaf development by negatively regulating the squamosa-promoter binding protein   <cit> . mir <dig> controls flower development by regulating the expression of apetala <dig>  in arabidopsis  <cit>  and glossy  <dig> in maize  <cit> . aberrant expression of mir <dig> and mir <dig> in plants disrupts normal leaf and flower development. compared with mir <dig> and mir <dig>  the expression levels of mir <dig> and mir <dig> are moderate while the expression of mir <dig> is low. the expression patterns of these mirnas appear to be related to their function.

four novel mirnas and one mirna*, all identified by solexa sequencing, were validated by qrt-pcr. the expression levels of the mirnas differed from one another in peanut leaves. mirn <dig> and mirn <dig> were expressed much higher than other tested peanut-specific mirnas with a ct value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively. the expression levels are much lower for mirn <dig> and mirn2* with ct values of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> . however, more studies need to be performed to elucidate the function that these mirnas have on the growth and development of peanut.

target prediction of peanut mirnas
to better understand the functions of the newly identified species-specific as well as conserved peanut mirnas, putative targets of these mirnas were predicted using the described criteria and methods. the target genes of thirteen conserved and seven novel peanut mirna families were predicted. transcription factors, including gras family transcription factor, nuclear transcription factor y subunit and nac <dig> were predicted to be potential targets of peanut mirnas. furthermore, genes directly involved in protein synthesis, e.g., ribosomal protein s <dig>  were targets of peanut mirnas. a previous study indicates that auxin signaling is regulated by mirnas  <cit> ; our current result is consistent with this study and the auxin signaling f-box  <dig> is a potential target of peanut mir <dig>  resveratrol synthase, nam -like protein, growth regulator factor  <dig>  basic blue copper protein, endonuclease, a protein kinase, transport inhibitor response  <dig> and a disease resistance response protein were also predicted to be potential targets of identified peanut mirnas .

CONCLUSIONS
for the first time we discovered, through high through-put solexa sequencing,  <dig> novel mirna families and  <dig> conserved mirnas, belonging to  <dig> families, in peanut. of these  <dig> novel peanut mirnas,  <dig> are peanut-specific because no homologs have been found in other plant species. qrt-pcr analysis demonstrated that both conserved and peanut-specific mirnas are expressed in peanuts.
