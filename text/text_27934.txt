BACKGROUND
computationally based genomic analyses have been able to accomplish interpretation of the genome of caenorhabditis elegans on a global scale. the aims of some high-throughput genomic projects have focused on the identification of developmental stage, tissue or cell-specific 'transcriptomes', which attempt to describe transcribed regions and their relative abundance  <cit> .

approaches such as microarray, serial analysis of gene expression   <cit> , and expressed sequence tag  analysis have been widely used for the identification of genes that are selectively turned on or off in specific cell or tissue types with regard to development, aging, and disease. these approaches have also provided experimental evidence for the confirmation of predicted gene structures, alternative splice variants  <cit> , and non-coding rnas   <cit> .

at present, there are approximately  <dig>  c. elegans ests in wormbase which, in addition to available cdna sequences, provide complete transcriptional evidence for  <dig> % of the transcripts. the remaining transcripts are partially confirmed by ests or only computationally predicted by comparative genomics or ab-initio gene prediction methods .

we have sequenced a large number of ests from a c. elegans cdna population, synchronized at the first larval  developmental stage, by a high-throughput, sequencing-by-synthesis technology, namely  <dig> sequencing  <cit> . this method produces dna sequences more rapidly and cost-effectively than the traditional sanger sequencing approach and has been successfully utilized in other studies for various purposes, such as expression profiling and novel gene discovery  <cit> . we have generated more than  <dig>  novel c. elegans est sequences by this highly parallel sequencing method for this study.

we have analyzed the novel sequence data to obtain a more complete c. elegans transcriptome profile, providing not only confirmation of computationally predicted transcripts but also the identification of potential novel transcripts, alternatively spliced variants, and ncrnas  <cit> . in addition, the increased depth of this sequencing of c. elegans l <dig> cdna library facilitated a more sensitive search for novel transcribed regions that may be specific for the first larval stage of c. elegans. we have also investigated conservation of potential novel transcribed regions across available nematode species namely: c. elegans, c. briggsae, c. remanei, c. brenneri, brugia malayi and pristionchus pacificus.

RESULTS
 <dig> est sequencing identifies known transcripts and partially confirms computationally predicted transcripts
using sequencing-by-synthesis technology we have generated a total of  <dig>  reads  from an l1-specific cdna sample with an average read length of  <dig> bases. an average  <dig> read accuracy is measured to be  <dig> % with substantially all of the bases having phred  <dig> or better quality  <cit> . sequences identified as vector contamination were filtered out using crossmatch  <cit> , resulting in a data set of  <dig>   <dig> ests, which were aligned using the basic local and alignment and search tool   <cit> , to around  <dig>  known and predicted c. elegans genes . from this set, a total of  <dig>   <dig> ests  were directly mapped to  <dig> known or predicted c. elegans genes by blast with high confidence value . transcripts which have the greatest number of  <dig> ests , generally match ribosomal protein coding genes. this is expected as ribosomal protein coding genes are the most abundantly expressed type of genes. these data provide partial experimental evidence for approximately  <dig> genes, which have previously been predicted only through computational methods .

around 22% of the  <dig> est data  had no significant matches to known or predicted c. elegans transcripts at the specified stringency and as such may represent previously unidentified genetic structures, such as novel transcripts, l <dig> stage-specific transcripts, novel splice variants and ncrnas. the remaining 1%  of the data ambiguously map to more than one transcript at the high stringency used, although these ambiguous matches are usually simple repeats or sequences of low-complexity.

 <dig> est reads are biased towards 3'-transcript ends
the physical distribution of  <dig> est reads, which map across known transcripts from their 5'- to 3'-ends, shows a larger coverage on the 3'-ends . this is likely due to the presence of partial transcripts in the cdna library. the lack of splice leader sequences also indicates under-representation of the 5'-ends of the transcripts. on average, six unique est reads were mapped to each known transcript ranging from a single est to  <dig> unique ests, with a median of two ests.

most statistically over-represented genes identified by  <dig> ests correlate to developmental, reproductive, and cellular metabolic processes
we performed gene ontology  analysis on  <dig> genes identified by  <dig> ests using gostat  <cit> . the most statistically over-represented go annotations in biological processes  within this group of genes correlate to multicellular organismal development processes , reproductive developmental processes in a multicellular organism , and lastly, cellular metabolic processes .

 <dig> ests that map to c. elegans' genome identify putative novel transcripts or splice variants
the 22%  of  <dig> ests, which did not have significant matches to known or predicted c. elegans transcripts, was subsequently compared with the genomic sequence of c. elegans using blast. as a result,  <dig>  ests  map to the genome at a high stringency . a stringent p-value threshold of  <dig> × 10- <dig> was used for mapping  <dig> ests to the transcriptome to ensure that read alignments to the transcriptome were of very high quality and unlikely to occur by chance. subsequently the less stringent threshold of  <dig> × 10- <dig> was used here for alignments against the genome. although this increases the chance of incorrect alignment, it increases the total number of aligned reads and may facilitate the discovery of novel transcription events, which can subsequently be validated.

the remaining ests , which do not map to either the transcriptome or genome are composed of contamination, low complexity or poor quality sequences . from this analysis,  <dig> additional genes  were identified by ests mapping completely to their introns or partially to the exons.

genomic est hits are categorized according to genomic mapping locations
the  <dig>  ests that align to the genome have been subdivided into the following categories: ests which map to intergenic regions , intronic regions , and transcript ends and/or untranslated regions  , est reads that split into two separate alignment blocks , and those which span exon and intron boundaries suggesting alternative splice junctions . the last 3% mapped to overlapping transcripts . we have investigated each category to search for genetic structures, such as putative novel genes, splice variants, and ncrna genes from each genomic region. some of the genomic regions already have computational predictions or other previously sequenced ests supporting the presence of such structures, and some do not have any other information to support these findings. lack of other experimental and computational evidence may indicate possible splicing errors or unknown genetic features.

intergenic ests
we have classified intergenic ests as those ests which mapped within intergenic regions of the genome but did not overlap with adjacent genes. a total of  <dig> intergenic ests mapped to  <dig> intergenic regions ranging from single counts to coverage with over  <dig> reads ;  <dig> of these intergenic regions have five or more unique ests mapping within them .

most intergenic regions  have one unique est cluster  mapped, around  <dig> intergenic regions have two clusters, around  <dig> intergenic regions have three clusters, around  <dig> have four clusters, and, finally, one intergenic region has  <dig> est predicted clusters.

interestingly, the neighboring gene to the novel est hits shown in figure 2b, gsa- <dig> , encodes a gs alpha subunit of heterotrimeric g proteins, which affects l <dig> stage viability, movement, and egg laying  <cit> . gsa- <dig> is confirmed both by previously sequenced cdnas and ests. we postulate that the  <dig> ests may, therefore, indicate a utr extension of gsa- <dig> or, alternatively, a splice variant. it is also interesting to note that the number of  <dig> ests mapped near the 3'-end of gsa- <dig> is much greater than the number of previously sequenced ests mapped to gsa- <dig>  this may indicate that  <dig> est sequencing has much deeper coverage of l <dig> stage mrna sample or, alternatively, the potential novel splice variant shows a relatively higher level of expression at the l <dig> stage.

finally, previously sequenced ests  overlap with  <dig> ests in the intergenic region shown in figure 2c. these ests support a possible 3'-end extension of the neighboring gene, nhr- <dig> . the ests generated by yuji kohara , are also generated from an l <dig> stage c. elegans cdna library. as nhr- <dig> has been determined to belong to a gene cluster containing genes that are significantly enriched in l <dig> muscle  <cit> , this example implies that our  <dig> est sequencing data has deep coverage of l1-enriched genes.

the size of the intergenic regions to which the  <dig> ests map ranges from  <dig> base pairs  to  <dig>  bp. although we observe a positive correlation between the physical distribution of est hits and the intergenic size , we found no correlation between the size of the intergenic region and the number of ests that mapped to it. the distribution of intergenic est hits across intergenic regions was observed to be relatively uniform, which is unexpected given that we anticipated witnessing a bias towards the ends of the intergenic regions , which would likely represent utrs or novel terminating or initiating exons of the bordering genes. est hits in the middle of large intergenic regions distant from neighboring genes represent more likely candidates for novel transcripts, including ncrna genes  <cit> .

intronic ests
we have classified intronic ests as those ests which mapped completely within introns. intronic est matches may represent novel exons , as well as novel overlapping transcripts on the opposite strand. ncrnas are also known to be present in intronic regions  <cit> . a total of  <dig> ests with over 90% alignment were mapped within introns of  <dig> c. elegans transcripts using blast ; see additional file  <dig>  of these genes,  <dig> only had the intronic est hits without any ests completely mapping to their annotated exons. these ests may indicate that there are ncrna genes or novel transcripts on the opposite strand within the introns. the reasoning behind this speculation is that the probability of a gene having only intronic ests without any ests mapping to its annotated exons is low for the possibility that the intronic ests are derived from a novel exon of that gene. in fact, the recent wormbase version  added four new protein coding genes within some of these introns but on the opposite dna strand and the ests mapped in the introns match those new genes .

5'- and 3'-end ests
5'- and 3'-end ests are ests that partially map to the beginning or end of transcripts . these est matches are also interesting in that they may contain regulatory elements, such as subcellular localization signals  <cit> , and cis-elements for mrna stability and translation  <cit> . we found  <dig> transcripts with ests mapping to their 5'-ends  and  <dig> transcripts had ests mapped to their 3'-ends. these 3'- and 5'-end  <dig> ests represent utrs or coding region extensions potentially including alternative start and stop codons.

gapped ests
when one end of an est read maps to a genomic location and the other end of the est read maps to a location some distance away , we have categorized these as 'gapped ests'. ests that map to the ends of two adjacent exons confirming known introns  are not included in this data set as they were examined in the initial comparison to the transcriptome. fifteen such 'gapped est' hits were found , confirming novel exon-intron boundaries and providing strong experimental evidence for novel transcripts or alternative splice variants with skipped exons, novel internal or end exons, or novel exon-intron boundaries . six of these est matches confirm updated gene structures in recent wormbase release .

* a recent wormbase release  has since confirmed these exon-intron boundaries; the original mapping analysis was performed using wb <dig> 

exon-intron boundary ests
ests that map across exon and intron boundaries are a possible indication of novel alternative splicing events  or, alternatively, cdnas that have been partially processed with some introns left intact. these est hits could also provide experimental confirmation for incorrect splice site predictions in the current gene models, particularly for those that lack experimental validation. additional file  <dig> lists  <dig> transcripts with  <dig> ests that map across their exon and intron boundaries.

exon-intron boundaries with  <dig> ests mapped show weaker 3'-end splice site conservation
we have analyzed splice sites for the transcripts which have ests mapped across exon-intron boundaries, and found the consensus 3'-end splice sites  are less well conserved compared with the transcripts that have splice sites confirmed by ests or rnas as shown in figure 4a. the weaker conservation of the 3'-end splice sites may be a feature of alternative splice sites or simply be more prone to erroneous splicing events.

 <dig> ests mapped to different genomic regions show average guanine-cytosine contents similar to the genomic averages
comparisons of guanine-cytosine  contents of the  <dig> est read sequences, in different genomic regions, with overall c. elegans genomic sequences are shown in figure 4b. as expected, est read sequences that mapped to exons have the highest gc content, and these are close to the average for annotated coding sequences of the whole genome . it might be expected that  <dig> est reads, which mapped to intergenic and intronic regions, would have gc content close to that of the coding sequence if they represent novel transcripts or exons. however, the intergenic and intronic est read sequences have similar percentage gc to the average gc contents of intergenic and intronic sequences for genome, around 34% and 28%, respectively, suggesting the ests that map to intergenic regions or introns represent evidence for non-coding, transcribed sequences rather than protein coding sequences as ncrna genes do not show as strong base composition biases as do protein coding sequences  <cit> .

intergenic regions with  <dig> ests show a higher degree of cross-species conservation
conservation of intergenic regions across different nematode species is evidence for functional genetic structures. these intergenic regions, with  <dig> ests mapped to them, were aligned with other nematode species namely: c. briggsae, c. remanei, c. brenneri, b. malayi, and p. pacificus, using clustalw. approximately  <dig> intergenic regions in total were randomly selected for this analysis, providing a 1: <dig> ratio of intergenic regions with  <dig> ests aligned to and ones without. these intergenic regions had three to six orthologous sequences for multiple sequence alignments depending on the availability and existence of orthologous sequences. intergenic regions with mapped  <dig> ests had overall higher average clustalw alignment scores than the ones without  <dig> ests . this higher degree of conservation of the intergenic regions with  <dig> ests represents further evidence that supports the presence of putative novel functional transcripts identified by the  <dig> est sequences.

cross-species est-to-genome comparisons identify highly conserved ests and species-specific ests
another important analysis is the cross-species comparison of ests that map to the genome. we have compared the well-annotated genomes of c. elegans and c. briggsae, as well as the c. remanei genome that has more recently become available.

strong and abundant est matches on well-conserved genomic regions is strong evidence supporting the presence of novel genetic structures. we were interested in comparing est hits and cross-species conservation of the genomic regions where the ests align. such characterization of est hits unique to one species and est hits in conserved regions may offer evolutionary clues to alternative splicing.

we have examined both species-specific and species-conserved splicing events by mapping the intergenic  <dig> est sequences to c. briggsae, c. remanei, and c. brenneri by blast. a total of  <dig> unique c. elegans ests, which were aligned to intergenic regions at the high stringency, were mapped to c. briggsae, c. remanei, and c. brenneri. the top 5% of the blast hits, with the highest scores, were most common among the three nematodes, but c. remanei had the greatest number of high score blast hits  with e-values lower than  <dig> × 10- <dig> . the intergenic regions where these ests are aligned are highly conserved across species as expected, and synteny of these genomic regions also seems to be well conserved . these highly conserved est hits across species likely represent novel transcripts. est alignments with poor scores, such as blast hits with an e-value higher than  <dig>  indicate that the ests mapped uniquely to c. elegans at high stringency. these est sequences may be from novel transcripts that are unique to c. elegans, although it is also possible that some or all of these ests may be transcriptional noise.

highly conserved ests are mapped to ncrnas
ncrnas are anticipated to be conserved  <cit> . the conservation of primary structure for ncrnas is known to be variable when the secondary structure is expected to be more highly conserved across species  <cit> . it is also known that expression of ncrnas vary with developmental stages  <cit> , and therefore, our ests may identify ncrnas highly expressed in the l <dig> stage.

we have selected and examined the est loci that are highly conserved across species , and have at least five or more est reads mapped in the middle of large intergenic regions  away from neighboring genes . these est hits are the most probable candidates for novel transcripts and in fact, many of these est loci are either mapped to ncrnas that are identified, confirmed and added to more recent wormbase or ncrna predictions performed by rnaz  <cit>  .

the most conserved intronic ests map to c. elegans gene k04g <dig>  and its c. briggsae ortholog. consistent with well conserved est loci in intergenic regions, these ests may represent an ncrna as they overlap with an ncrna prediction within the intron, however, alternatively this could be a novel exon as genefinder has predicted an exon in that region .

 <dig> ests support computational ncrna gene predictions
currently, there are around  <dig> annotated functional ncrnas in wormbase  <cit> , of which  <dig> are in our data set, including snornas, mirnas, 21urnas, rrnas, and some ncrnas that could not be assigned to any functional class . we suspect that  <dig> ests may represent precursor rnas, such as pre-mirna and pre-snornas, which are known to be polyadenylated  <cit> , since our rna preparation was done using a polya-dependent method. however, it is also possible that potential ncrnas that are identified in this study may belong to polyadenylated ncrna classes, such as mrna-like ncrnas   <cit> .

single-sequence rna secondary structure predictions, without using comparative genomes, only take into account thermodynamic models and energy minimization, which are not sufficient to achieve the necessary sensitivity and specificity for ncrna prediction. for that reason, we have compared the  <dig> est mapping result with rnaz ncrna predictions  <cit> , which incorporate homology information of the rna secondary structure to make predictions for ncrnas. this approach, using c. elegans and c. briggsae, has proven fruitful in identifying over  <dig> putative rna loci  <cit> .

we compared rnaz ncrna predictions for c. elegans and  <dig> unique  <dig> ests mapped to intergenic regions. we found  <dig> ncrna predictions in close proximity to  <dig> ests , with nine of these predicted ncrnas overlapping with the  <dig> ests in intergenic regions . we have also compared the intronic  <dig> ests with the rnaz ncrna predictions and found that  <dig> introns contained both  <dig> ests and ncrna predictions within  <dig> bp, and five introns had intronic ests that overlap with ncrna predictions . these ests that map to ncrna predictions may represent novel ncrnas.

l <dig> sage and  <dig> ests overlap by 50%
we have investigated both the commonalities and differences between the large amount of available sage data  <cit>  and the novel  <dig> est data. both data sets were generated from the same mrna preparation of l <dig> stage animals and as such are a direct comparison of these two gene expression-measuring techniques.

the number of genes that were identified by sage and ests independently from l <dig> stage animals is  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, but the number of genes that were identified by both methods is only  <dig>  hence,  <dig> genes were identified by sage only and  <dig> genes were identified only by ests. it is worth noting that while the same mrna sample was used for both sage and  <dig> est analyses, the inherent differences in the technologies used may have introduced discrepancies in gene identification. for example, approximately half of the genes identified by sage only have a single sage tag, which may not be sufficient evidence for expression of those genes due to the possibility of erroneous assignment  <cit> , and approximately 12% of the genes identified only by  <dig> ests do not contain nlaiii restriction enzyme site required for a transcript to be identified by sage  <cit> .

spearman correlation of the transcript abundances, measured by sage and ests, was calculated using genes that have both sage tags and ests mapped to them. the correlation coefficient is  <dig> , which is not as high as we initially expected considering both est and sage libraries were prepared from the same mrna sample. this, however, raises interesting questions as to how well each data set represents the complete picture of transcriptional activities. it could be that from the large scale of transcriptional activities, each snap-shot represents only a partial picture, or that each experiment contains significant amounts of new information, although it could simply be due to discrepancies between different gene expression profiling methods.

l <dig> sage and  <dig> ests identify putative novel l <dig> stage-enriched genes
we have compared  <dig> ests and sage tags, which map specifically to intergenic regions. there are  <dig> intergenic regions that have both l <dig>  <dig> ests and l <dig> sage tags mapped to them . when we examined intergenic regions with sage tags, which are enriched in the l <dig> stage but lowly expressed in embryo and other developmental stages, we observed a good correlation between the l1-enriched sage tags and l <dig>  <dig> ests. in other words, most intergenic regions with sage tags that are expressed highly in the l <dig> stage also had  <dig> ests mapped in close proximity. we speculate these loci may represent novel coding or non-coding transcripts that are potentially l <dig> stage specific but expressed in low abundance. additionally, we postulate that both intergenic sage tags enriched in l <dig> and l <dig>  <dig> ests, which map together in regions without any genes in their vicinity may represent putative novel transcripts that may be enriched in the l <dig> stage of c. elegans. in addition, ests and sage tags which map near the 3'-end of genes might represent 3'-utr extensions and as such can provide evidence of expression for those genes at the l <dig> stage.

CONCLUSIONS
we have successfully demonstrated the use of the next-generation sequencing technology  for transcriptome analysis in an extremely efficient manner. we have identified a number of putative novel genetic structures from the transcriptome snap-shot obtained from this analysis, including putative novel splice variants and ncrnas that might be stage specific.
