BACKGROUND
cell scattering is a physiological process executed by stem and progenitor cells during embryonic liver development and postnatal organ regeneration. metastasis seems to arise from the same genetic program that instructs cells to detach, adhere, and migrate through extracellular matrices, crossing tissue boundaries and escaping death due to an unsuitable tissue context  <cit> . the hepatocyte growth factor/scattering factor  <dig>  is the paradigmatic example of a molecule that induces cell scattering with optimal spatial and chronological coordination. this process takes place through a complex network of signaling pathways triggered by the hgf/sf <dig> tyrosine kinase receptor, met, which includes the grb2-ras-mitogen activated protein kinases , the pi-3'k, and the signal transducer and activator of transcription  cascades  <cit> . integrins are thought to be essential for cell migration and penetration of the basement membrane, in addition to playing a major role in cellular adhesion to the extracellular matrix  and certain cell surface proteins. these adhesion receptors also convey a series of mechanical and biochemical extracellular stimuli in signaling cascades that favor cell migration and proliferation  <cit> . interestingly, growth factor and integrin-emanating signals can interact to promote cell migration. for instance, c-met signaling can be modulated by the α6β <dig> integrin when co-expressed on the cell surface  <cit> , and hgf/sf <dig>  conversely, can regulate the adhesive status and aggregation rate of αvβ <dig> integrin in epithelial cells  <cit> .

the genome is highly organized within the cell nucleus  <cit> . indeed, chromosomes and genes exhibit cell type specific preferential positioning, and this non-random distribution of genetic elements in the interphase nucleus is related to genome function  <cit> . genome organization has been broadly investigated, in particular during cell differentiation and tumorigenesis. for example, the stem cell specific genes nanog and oct <dig> acquire differential positioning in the nucleus as their expression levels change during differentiation of human embryonic stem cells  <cit> . additionally, changes in the spatial distribution of cancer related genes have been shown in a cell-model of breast cancer during induced malignant evolution  <cit> . however, much still remains to be elucidated regarding the genomic events associated with cell migration.

mlp <dig> cells are murine liver progenitor cells that respond to hgf/sf <dig> treatment with a well characterized sequence of events that resemble the cell invasion program, including cell scattering, migration, proliferation, and tubular morphogenesis  <cit> . considering that α5β <dig> integrin is one of the main ecm receptors of hepatocytes, and that changes in integrin-mediated contacts between the cell and ecm are necessary for cell migration  <cit> , we speculate that functional blockade of α5β <dig> integrin may result in cell migration, and that the changes in the cell microenvironment will be sensed and transduced into specific nuclear responses. here, we investigated the molecular and cellular genomic events associated with cell migration triggered by the functional blockade of α5β <dig> integrin in liver progenitor cells.

RESULTS
integrin expression profile and adhesion properties of hepatic progenitor and hcc cells
we first assessed the cell membrane expression of β <dig> integrins in mlp <dig> and hep <dig> cells by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence analyses. cytometric analyses showed that this integrin sub-unit is expressed in mlp <dig> and hep <dig> cells. however, flow cytometric detection of β <dig> levels demonstrated significantly higher levels of β <dig> integrin-types in mlp <dig> cells compared to hep <dig> cells, used as a control because of their low β <dig> integrin expression levels . to determine the adhesive capacity to different components of the ecm, we performed cell adhesion tests to fn, vn, lmn and col-i using the mtt assay. hcc cells exhibited high adhesive capacity to all these components of the ecm, whereas, mlp <dig> cells displayed high adhesion to fn and col-i, and low adhesion to vn and lmn , thus making the mlp <dig> cellular model suitable for the study of β <dig> integrin-mediated events.

α5β <dig> integrin functional blockade induces cell scattering and migration in hepatic progenitor cells
considering that integrin α5β <dig> is one of the main ecm receptors of hepatocytes, we wondered whether specific disruption of the α5β1-mediated cell-ecm interactions would trigger invasive-like cell growth. in order to substantiate our hypothesis, mlp <dig> cell cultures were treated with a specific antibody against α5β <dig> integrin and hgf/sf <dig> as control, owing to its capacity to induce cell scattering and migration. by microscopic inspection, we observed that untreated mlp <dig> cells grow in tightly packed patches, mimicking the structure of an epithelial sheet, whereas blocking α5β <dig> caused the loss of cell-cell junctions and induced cell spreading throughout the culture dish, similar to the cell scattering induced by hgf/sf <dig>  these morphological changes involved reorganization of the cell cytoskeleton, from cortical f-actin structures to parallel bundles disposed along the axis of the cellular prolongations . moreover, immunoblot and immunofuorescent detection showed that functional blockade of α5β <dig> integrin induced down-regulation of e-cadherin, demonstrating that effectively the process involved cell-cell dissociation .

to specifically test cell migration we performed the wound healing and the transwell assay. in the wound healing assay, the same fields on a confluent cell monolayer were pictured right after scratching  and  <dig> hours later. computational analysis of the images showed that mlp <dig> cells treated with the α5β <dig> function-blocking antibody migrated towards the scratch faster than the control cells . hgf/sf <dig> also induced migration, but to a lesser extent . in the transwell assay, mlp <dig> cells treated with hgf/sf <dig> or anti-α5β <dig> integrin antibody were placed on top of filters coated with ecm formulations, but migration through filters was not statistically significant after  <dig> hours. these results suggest that different mechanisms for cell migration may be used in these two types of assays . we further characterized this process by determining the expression levels of β <dig> and β <dig> integrin sub-units, which are known to be associated with the invasive capacity of several epithelial tumor types. moreover, we assessed the level of epcam, afp and ck <dig>  all biomarkers expressed in the liver stem cell niche during liver regeneration  <cit> . immunofluorescence with antibodies against these proteins showed that the expression level is higher after both treatments . in addition, these changes were associated with an increase in metabolic activity . furthermore, flow cytometric analysis of dna content showed that α5β <dig> functional blockade did not induce drastic changes in the progression of mlp <dig> cells through the cell cycle .

α5β <dig> integrin functional blockade of hepatic progenitor cells triggers cell signaling pathways involved in cell motility
we checked the activation status of the different members of the mapks family in response to α5β <dig> functional blockade or stimulation with hgf/sf <dig>  using a mapk array kit, we determined that both treatments induced the long-term activation  of p <dig> mapk, partly matching the hyperactivation of the erk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapks cell transduction cascades of the highly invasive hep <dig> hcc cells . activation of erk 1/ <dig> mapks was also observed, however, the peak of this kinase phosphorylation occurred two hours after α5β <dig> integrin functional blockade. these effects were reversed by the mek pharmacological inhibitor u <dig> .

gene expression profile of migrating liver progenitor cells
to characterize the global genome transcriptional response to functional blockade of α5β <dig> integrin, we performed genechip array analyses  of well annotated genes. the data from three independent experiments were collectively analyzed using the r package "affylmgui" . each experiment included rna samples from mlp <dig> cells subjected to functional blockade of α5β <dig> integrin, hgf stimulation, and untreated control cells. a total of  <dig> genes changed their expression level during cell spreading induced by α5β <dig> functional blockade, whereas only  <dig> genes changed their transcriptional status after hgf/sf <dig> stimulation, when a p-value < <dig>  was considered significant in the statistical comparisons between treated and control cells. because genes are unequally distributed on chromosomes , we calculated the ratio between the number of differentially expressed genes per chromosome and the total number of genes mapping to the same chromosome . this analysis showed that de-regulation of genes is evenly distributed throughout the genome. gene ontology  enrichment analysis demonstrated that during cell migration induced by α5β <dig> functional blockade, more genes were up-regulated than down-regulated. most of the up-regulated genes were within the biological processes  and cellular components  categories . the number of up-regulated genes, found in many categories, can be narrowed down to seven, and up-regulation in the expression of the transforming growth factor-β <dig>  and hypoxia-induced factor  <dig> alpha  genes appear to be involved in many of the observed cellular responses . down-regulations occurred more frequently within the molecular function  compartment, specifically genes involved in the regulation of chromatin stability, such as sfpq, dido <dig> and sap <dig> .

next we assessed the transcriptional response of gene sets involved in cell adhesion and migration. the results are presented in figure  <dig> as color-encoded plots in which a p-value close to  <dig> indicates statistically significant higher mrna levels of all genes included in the set, and a p-value close to  <dig> indicates significantly lower levels. the functional blockade of α5β <dig> induced up-regulation of several sets of genes involved in cell adhesion, whereas the response to hgf/sf <dig> stimulation was less pronounced, similar to untreated cells . the gene sets involved in cell migration exhibited a pattern of gradual change in expression levels among the three types of samples. as expected, untreated cells exhibited significantly lower expression levels of these genes compared to the other two groups of treated cells, whereas the treatment with hgf/sf <dig> induced a slight increase, and α5β <dig> functional blockade resulted in a more pronounced up-regulation of cell-migration genes , among them β <dig> and β <dig> integrins. however, before regarding the results obtained for hgf/sf <dig> as not significant , it must be recognized that the permutation analyses were done across all samples, including the α5β <dig> inhibition which displays much stronger regulation of cell migration genes. most important, these results clearly demonstrate that α5β <dig> functional blockade triggers invasive-like cell migration.

distinct expression profile of chromatin-remodeling and transcription factors
a total of  <dig> genes, belonging to the smarc  family of chromatin remodeling factors were represented in the array and the analysis of their expression data revealed that functional blockade of α5β <dig> resulted in a larger number of differentially regulated genes than hgf/sf <dig> stimulation . we also analyzed the expression level of transcription factors, and our results demonstrate drastic changes in the expression level in integrin inhibited cells, whereas stimulation with hgf/sf <dig> presented a more restricted response . more importantly, the transcriptional responses to these two treatments are clearly distinct, indicating that the genomic effects exerted by the disruption of cell-ecm interactions differ from those induced by soluble regulatory factors , possibly because cells also apply traction to their integrin receptors, in addition to the integrin ligation-induced signaling.

cell scattering is associated with nuclear architecture remodeling
to determine whether cell migration involves spatial genome reorganization, we analyzed the distribution of all centromeres by fluorescent in situ hybridization  using a pan-centromeric dna probe. by qualitative inspection of microscopic images, we observed that centromeres were distributed throughout the nucleus, but forming the typical aggregates composed by the centromeres of two or more chromosomes  . for quantitative analysis, we determined the volume occupied by these nuclear domains in control, anti-α5β <dig> and hgf/sf1-treated mlp <dig> cells. the mean volume of the chromocenters decreased drastically following α5β <dig> functional blockade  or hgf/sf <dig> stimulation  in comparison to untreated control cells , while the average nuclear volume remained unchanged  .

to further explore the nuclear effects of α5β <dig> block or hgf/sf <dig> stimulation we analyzed the pattern of histone h <dig> trimethylated at lysine  <dig>  and acetylated at lysine  <dig> and  <dig>  by immunofluorescence analysis. mouse cells have the majority of me3k9h <dig> localized to prominent clusters of pericentromeric heterochromatin  <cit>  and, consistent with previous reports, microscopic inspection of mlp <dig> cell preparations revealed that me3k9h <dig> localized to chromocenters . however, detailed 3d analysis revealed that α5β <dig> functional blockade increased the average number of foci per nucleus, and this was concomitant with a decrease in their volume . the changes in centromeres and me3k9h <dig> foci spatial organization were not related to alterations in the nuclear volume due to technical artifact  or variation of the mean fluorescence intensity.

since acetylated histone h <dig> exhibited a homogeneous nuclear distribution , rather than a focal pattern, we analyzed the levels of ac3k9/k14h <dig> by flow cytometry and western blot, in addition to immunofluorescence, in order to determine the protein expression level and measure the mean intensity of ac3k9/k14h <dig> more accurately. interestingly, α5β <dig> functional blockade or hgf/sf <dig> stimulation significantly increased the levels of ac3k9/k14h <dig> . altogether, these observations indicate that alterations of the α5β1-mediated cell-ecm interactions during cell migration influence the overall spatial and functional organization of the nucleus.

positioning of genes encoding integrins during cell scattering
taking into account that α5β <dig> functional blockade and hgf/sf <dig> stimulation resulted in up-regulation of the genes encoding the integrin β <dig> and β <dig> sub-units; we asked whether these genes undergo repositioning. to this end, we analyzed the nuclear radial position of each gene independently by interphase 3d dna-fish and the results from 50- <dig> nuclei per experiment were plotted on cumulative distribution graphs. the preferential radial position of itgb <dig> and itgb <dig> was between 80% and 100% of the relative radius in control cells. pair-wise comparisons by kolmogorov-smirnov statistical tests, demonstrated that these genes did not change their position upon α5β <dig> functional blockade or hgf/sf <dig> stimulation  . considering the increase in the expression of β <dig> and β <dig> integrins associated with cell scattering, these results suggest that the itgb <dig> or itgb <dig> radial positions do not depend on gene activity.

discussion
invasive cell growth occurs not only during malignancy, but also takes place under physiological conditions during embryonic development and organ formation. in the present work, we demonstrate that functional blocking of α5β <dig> integrin induces cell dissociation and motility, and that this program involves changes in the structural and functional organization of the genome. cell scattering induced by functional blockade of α5β <dig> integrin was statistically demonstrated by the wound healing assay, but the transwell assays did not show invasive capacity. gerlitz et al. have reported that overexpression of the c-terminal domain of the histone h1e accelerated cell migration in the wound healing assays, but inhibited cell migration as measured by the transwell assay  <cit> . likewise, our results for this test are contrasting, and this may be due to the fact that the experimental procedure includes the pre-treatment of the cells with the α5β <dig> functional blocking antibody, which may inhibit their adhesion to components of the transwell membrane and consequently cells can not invade. alternatively, different migration mechanisms may be used in these two assays: in the wound healing assay, the cells use mesenchymal-like polarized motility and the transwell assay implies amoeboid-like movements  <cit> . cell migration was accompanied by the activation of erks 1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapks cell signaling pathways and a drastic increase in metabolic status. erk 1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapks phosphorylation occurs during migration of different cell types in response to various growth factors such as vegf, egf and tgf-β, and to components of the ecm  <cit> . functional blockade of α5β <dig> in mlp <dig> cells, on the other hand, was able to up-regulate the expression of the hepatic stem/progenitor cell markers epcam, afp and ck <dig>  all shown to be associated with migration of epithelial and embryonic stem cells in vitro  <cit> . furthermore, epcam participates in intercellular and cell-ecm interactions, and is expressed during liver regeneration  <cit> .

gene expression profiles documented here strongly support the notion that α5β <dig> integrin-mediated cell migration was associated with a larger number of differentially regulated genes than the process induced by hgf/sf <dig>  moreover, the number of up-regulated genes was higher than the number of down-regulated genes. these data fit very well with the results obtained from human fibroblasts which exhibited extensive down-regulation of genes when seeded onto low adhesion surfaces, which reduced cell scattering  <cit> . following functional blockade of α5β <dig> integrin or stimulation with hgf/sf <dig>  the most significantly up-regulated genes fell into the go categories concerning response to external stimuli, biosynthesis and cell growth, and in particular genes involved in cell adhesion and migration. we also detected drastic changes in the expression of several members of the swi/snf family of chromatin remodeling complex. this consist of approximately ten atp-dependent components and are thought to regulate genome function by altering the structure of chromatin  <cit> .

one key question in cell biology is how cells reorganize their genome in response to mechanical conditioning. we detected that migration of mlp <dig> cells involved morphological changes, cytoskeleton reorganization, and nuclear architecture remodeling. the fish analyses for the β1- and β3-integrin subunits revealed that the radial position of these genes within the interphase nucleus did not change. meaburn and misteli analyzed the radial distribution of four genes related to cell survival, mobility and migration, namely akt <dig>  vegf, erbb <dig>  and fgfr <dig> in a cell-model of breast cancer. they found that, except for vegf, the other loci underwent repositioning during tumorigenic differentiation  <cit> . however, it has also been shown that positional changes of chromosome territories only occur transiently at the beginning of the g <dig> phase, and then arrangements are stably maintained from mid g <dig> to early prophase during cell cycle  <cit> , our results are in agreement with this, and are supported by the flow cytometric analysis of dna content which showed that mlp <dig> cells did not progress through the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle after α5β <dig> functional blockade. furthermore, harnicarova and collaborators have reported that nuclear arrangement of the c-myc gene and its transcripts was conserved during enterocitic differentiation of ht- <dig> cells  <cit> . in contrast to this conserved spatial positioning of β1- and β3-integrin gene loci, fish analysis with a pan-centromeric probe revealed that the average number of chromocenters per nucleus increased, while their mean volume decreased following α5β <dig> functional blockade and hgf/sf <dig> stimulation, indicating that the spatial distribution of individual centromeres changes in response to the forces generated during cell migration. in close agreement with these results, a study on the position of centromeres of human chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> showed that the distance between centromeres decreases when fibroblasts are seeded onto matrices resembling 3d structures, compared to flat 2d surfaces, which generate different tensile forces and activate distinct signaling cascades  <cit> . we also found that during mlp <dig> cell migration, the volume of me3k9h <dig> foci decreased concomitantly with an increase in their average number. these findings, although expected because me3k9h <dig> localizes preferentially to pericentromeric heterochromatin, corroborate the data obtained by fish with pan-centromeric probes demonstrating chromocenter disaggregation during cell scattering. it has been shown that progressive chromocenter clustering occurs during cell differentiation and that this is associated with increasing levels of dna methylation  <cit> . our immunostaining assays with antibodies against me3k9h <dig> showed that the nuclear fluorescent intensity level was the same after functional blockade of α5β <dig>  suggesting that cell migration may occur without changes in the methylation status of histone h <dig>  most important, these experiments demonstrated that the architectural changes of chromocenters associated with this program are completely opposite to those leading to terminally differentiated or quiescent cells. thus, it appears that cell scattering involves significant spatial reorganization of the heterochromatic blocks of the genome associated with substantial changes in the expression level of genes encoding for chromatin remodeling factors.

CONCLUSIONS
we provide evidence that the functional blockade of α5β <dig> integrin in hepatic progenitor cells induces cell scattering and cytoskeleton reorganization in a manner similar to stimulation with hgf/sf <dig>  this process is accompanied by activation of the mapk pathway and an increase in the expression levels of the early hcc markers, ep-cam, afp and ck <dig>  gene expression arrays showed a massive change in the expression of chromatin remodeling and transcription factors. these functional changes of hepatic progenitor cells are associated with conspicuous structural reorganization of the cell nucleus.
