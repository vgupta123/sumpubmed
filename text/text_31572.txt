BACKGROUND
histone deacetylases  and histone acetyltransferases participate in chromatin remodeling and the regulation of gene expression. the opposing activities of these enzymes alter chromatin structure by either adding or removing acetyl groups from lysines in the amino-terminal tails of histones. the addition of acetyl groups to histones by acetyltransferases leads to the recruitment of co-activators and the relaxation of chromatin conformation that is necessary for transcriptional activation  <cit> . conversely, removal of acetyl groups by hdacs results in a condensed chromatin structure that is restrictive to transcription. mammalian hdacs are organized into four classes. class i hdacs  display nuclear localization and ubiquitous tissue expression  <cit> . class ii hdacs  exhibit tissue specific patterns of expression, shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, and are larger than class i hdacs  <cit> . class iii hdacs  require the coenzyme nad+ for enzymatic activity  <cit> . hdac <dig> is the sole member of the new class iv  <cit> .

hdac inhibitors  broadly compromise the activities of class i, ii and iv hdacs, albeit with varying efficiencies  <cit> . natural and synthetic hdis are divided into several structurally diverse classes including hydroxamic acids such as trichostatin a , short chain fatty acids such as valproic acid  and sodium butyrate , and benzamides such as ms- <dig>  <cit> . hdis inhibit hdac activity by blocking a channel that leads to the active site and a catalytic zinc ion  <cit> . in transformed cells, hdis induce growth arrest, apoptosis, and/or differentiation via many mechanisms  <cit> . hdis are currently in clinical trials as anticancer agents  <cit> ; they are also established antiepileptic drugs  <cit>  and potential treatments for inflammatory and cardiac diseases  <cit> . there are comparatively fewer data on the effects of hdis on normal cells; however, the existing evidence suggests that normal cells are resistant to the anti-proliferation, pro-apoptosis and pro-differentiation effects of hdis because their cell cycle checkpoints are intact  <cit> .

we previously demonstrated that concentrations of tsa, ms- <dig> and vpa that were sufficient to induce histone h <dig> hyperacetylation in primary and mc3t3-e <dig> osteoblasts modestly increased cell proliferation and viability but had no effect on cell cycle progression  <cit> . more strikingly, hdis accelerated the osteoblast maturation process by several days. thus, short-term exposure to tsa accelerated the appearance of alkaline phosphatase activity and matrix mineralization as well as expression of type i collagen, osteopontin, bone sialoprotein, and osteocalcin genes in mc3t3-e <dig> cell cultures  <cit> . tsa, ms- <dig> and nab also increased alkaline phosphatase activity in calvarial organ cultures  <cit> . other studies showed that hdis increase expression of genes associated with osteoblast maturation  <cit> , enhance mineralization  <cit> , block glucocorticoid-induced cell cycle arrest in osseous cells  <cit> , and stimulate osteoblast differentiation of multipotent mesenchymal cells  <cit> . suppression of hdac <dig> or hdac <dig> by rna interference also accelerated osteoblast maturation  <cit> . these results suggest that the gene expression changes occur upon inhibition of hdacs and promote osteoblast terminal differentiation. in this study, we used an unbiased approach to identify osteoblast genes that are altered by hdis within  <dig> hours to obtain a better understanding of the early pathways involved in accelerating the osteogenic phenotype.

RESULTS
hdis increase alkaline phosphatase activity during osteoblast differentiation
we previously demonstrated that hdis accelerate and enhance alkaline phosphatase expression by mc3t3-e <dig> pre-osteoblasts after three days. by the second week, the hdi-exposed cultures expressed higher levels of genes associated with osteoblast differentiation  than control cells  <cit> . the goal of this study was to identify genes that are affected early  by several hdis because they are more likely to be initiators or early regulators of the process. to demonstrate the differentiation potential of the hdi and vehicle-treated cells used in the microarray experiment, cells in parallel cultures were allowed to differentiate for up to seven days. during the differentiation process, lysates were taken at days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> and alkaline phosphatase activity was measured. in the dmso-treated cells, alkaline phosphatase activity increased steadily over time demonstrating that the cells were differentiating appropriately . alkaline phosphatase activity also increased in the hdi-treated cells and was generally higher in hdi-exposed cells relative to vehicle-treated cells at days  <dig> and  <dig> . these results demonstrate that the mc3t <dig> cells used for microarray analysis differentiated appropriately and that the hdis accelerated differentiation as expected from our previous studies  <cit> .

gene expression profiles of hdi treated cells
to determine the molecular mechanisms whereby hdis accelerate osteoblast maturation, we used microarray analysis to compare gene expression changes in mc3t3-e <dig> cells treated with hdis or its vehicle, dimethylsulfoxide . on the basis of our previous studies wherein we examined the expression changes in candidate genes after three days of hdi exposure  <cit> , we hypothesized that hdi treatment at the beginning of differentiation would reprogram gene expression and accelerate the entire differentiation process. to identify the relatively early changes in gene expression that occur in response to hdis in differentiating cells, we isolated rna from mc3t3-e <dig> cells cultured in osteogenic medium and hdis for only  <dig> hours. corresponding probes were hybridized to affymetrix genechip arrays and subjected to bioinformatics analyses.

at a false discovery rate  of  <dig>   relative to the vehicle -treated cells,  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in the tsa-treated cells,  <dig> genes in the ms-275-treated cells, and  <dig> genes in the vpa-treated cells. the top  <dig> tsa-regulated genes, all altered by more than five-fold, are listed in table  <dig>  the genes altered more than two-fold by ms- <dig> and vpa are shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the complete raw data sets have been deposited at the ncbi in the gene expression omnibus data repository   <cit> .

all genes were present at a fdr of  <dig>   relative to the vehicle control, dmso. the list excludes ests and other non-annotated sequences.

all genes were present at a fdr of  <dig>   relative to the vehicle control, dmso.

to compare the differentially expressed genes in all three hdi treatments relative to dmso, venn analysis was performed . of the  <dig> genes differentially regulated by all three hdis,  <dig> were induced and eight were suppressed . only four of these  <dig> genes were differentially regulated more than two-fold by each of the three hdis . three of these four genes were induced; they are solute carrier family  <dig> isoform  <dig> regulator  <dig> , glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase , and sorbitol dehydrogenase i . these genes are not affected by tsa in nih3t <dig> cells, suggesting specificity to osteoblasts . the suppressed gene is proteasome subunit beta type  <dig> . this gene was also downregulated by tsa in nih3t <dig> cells, indicating that it was not specifically targeted in the osteoblasts. when the fdr was changed to  <dig>  , four additional genes were altered more than two-fold by each of the three hdis . three genes , glutathione s-transferase alpha  <dig> , and ral gef with a ph domain and sh binding motif  <dig> ) were induced by the hdis and one gene, adaptor-related protein complex ap- <dig> sigma  <dig> , was suppressed.

the temporal regulation of several identified genes was determined by quantitative real-time pcrs using mrnas isolated from independent cultures of mc3t <dig> cells or primary murine calvarial osteoblasts. consistent with the genechip analysis, tsa was a more potent inducer of slc9a3r <dig> than ms- <dig> or vpa in both mc3t <dig> cells  and primary osteoblasts . slc9a3r <dig> induction was detectable at both the rna and protein levels as early as  <dig> to  <dig> hours after hdi exposure . similar effects were observed with sdh <dig> mrna in both mc3t <dig>  and primary osteoblasts  except vpa induced a more rapid increase in sdh <dig> expression than tsa. the induction of akap <dig> was also confirmed in primary osteoblasts . the suppression of psmb <dig> and ap4s <dig> was confirmed in primary osteoblasts .

regulation of growth factor and growth factor receptor genes by hdis
we previously demonstrated that hdis induced the differentiation rate of mc3t <dig> cells and primary calvarial osteoblasts  <cit> . therefore we analyzed the microarray data sets for growth factor and growth factor receptor genes that were differentially regulated by ms- <dig>  vpa and tsa with greater than 95% confidence. of the eight genes identified, only three were induced by all of the hdis . amphiregulin, a preostoblast growth factor  <cit> , was most consistently and highly increased. brain-derived neurotrophic factor and the wnt/norrin receptor, frizzled  <dig> , were also stimulated by hdis. in contrast, fz <dig>  an antagonist of osteoblast growth  <cit> , was suppressed by hdis. quantitative real-time pcr analyses verified the differential regulation of several of these genes in primary osteoblasts  and mc3t <dig> cells .

cells were incubated with hdis for  <dig> hr. all genes were present at a fdr of  <dig>   relative to the vehicle control, dmso. nd, not determined.

discussion
hdis are potential bone anabolic agents due to their ability to promote osteoblast maturation and osteo-progenitor expansion  <cit> . we previously showed that the addition of hdis to mc3t <dig> cell cultures for three or six days accelerated the expression of known early and late osteoblast differentiation genes  <cit> . to identify genes affected early by the hdis, we differentiated and treated mc3t3-e <dig> cells with three hdis or vehicle for  <dig> hours and analyzed gene expression profiles with affymetrix microarray gene chips. relative to vehicle-treated cells, tsa altered the expression of  <dig> genes; ms- <dig> altered  <dig> genes; and vpa changed  <dig> genes. the large differences between the numbers of genes affected by the hdis may be due to differences in their potencies, half-lives and/or specificities. nanomolar concentrations of tsa inhibit the activities of all hdacs  <cit> . likewise, ms- <dig> is effective at nanomolar concentrations; however, it does not inhibit hdac <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, vpa is effective at millimolar concentrations and specifically inhibits class i and ii hdacs with the exceptions of hdac <dig> and hdac <dig>  <cit> . tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> list the genes most differentially regulated by each hdi. as indicated in the venn diagram , some genes on these lists are affected by just one hdi. these genes might appear just in one group because we only assayed one time point; however, it is possible that each hdi affects a distinct subset of genes, some of which might not affect osteoblast differentiation. these differences could affect the suitability of an hdi for a specific application.

all three hdis  used in this study accelerate mc3t <dig> terminal differentiation and induce alkaline phosphatase activity in calvarial organ cultures  <cit> . genes significantly altered by all three hdis may represent a core group of genes that are responsible for initiating the acceleration of osteoblast differentiation. of note, well-known osteoblast genes, such as osteocalcin, did not appear in our results. it is likely that the time of analysis  was too early to see differential effects on these genes. of the most differentially regulated genes , slc9a3r <dig> is the most likely to have roles in osteoblast proliferation and/or differentiation.

slc9a3r <dig>  also known as na+/h+ exchanger regulatory factor  or ezrin binding protein  <dig>  is an apical membrane phosphoprotein that links membrane proteins with cytoplasmic proteins to regulate actin cytoskeletal reorganization  <cit> . slc9a3r <dig> interacts with numerous signaling proteins  <cit> , including the g-protein coupled receptor for parathyroid hormone  <cit> , and the canonical wnt signal transducer, β-catenin  <cit> ; thereby implicating its potentially important role in osteoblast maturation. slc9a3r <dig>  deficient mice develop renal phosphate wasting, but the majority of female mice also had a 25–30% reduction in bone mineral density and a 40% decrease in bone mineral content with multiple fractures  <cit> . we found that overexpression of slc9a3r <dig> in osteoblasts by adenoviral transduction was not sufficient to drive osteoblast differentiation . these data indicate that nherf- <dig> contributes to bone homeostasis but is not sufficient to promote osteoblast maturation.

another differentially regulated gene is proteasome subunit beta type  <dig> . also known as lmp <dig> and mecl <dig>  psmb <dig> was suppressed by hdis in both mc3t <dig> osteoblasts and nih3t <dig> cells. psmb <dig> is one of ten proteolytically-active beta subunits of the 20s core complex within the 26s proteosome  <cit> . ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation has an established role in osteoblasts  <cit> . compounds that bind to the 20s proteasome beta subunits, inhibit the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and stimulate bone formation in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . therefore, the decreased expression of psmb <dig> upon hdi treatment is consistent with the observed acceleration of osteoblast differentiation. the specific role hdac activity plays in the regulation of psmb <dig> expression is unclear. the non-specific decreased expression of this gene upon hdi treatment suggests that the psmb <dig> promoter is probably not directly regulated by hdacs but rather through a repressor whose expression is sensitive to hdac activity.

we previously reported that hdis induce the proliferation and/or survival of mc3t <dig> cells and primary calvarial osteoblasts but do not affect cell cycle progression  <cit> . examination of the microarray gene lists for growth factor and growth factor receptor genes affected by hdis identified eight genes that could influence osteoblast growth, but only three were increased. amphiregulin was highly induced by hdis . amphiregulin binds egf receptors and is a potent growth factor for preosteoblasts  <cit> . brain derived neurotrophic factor mrna was also increased by hdis, but its effects on osteoblast growth have not been determined. two frizzled genes were also regulated by hdis. frizzled- <dig> was increased by hdis, while frizzled- <dig> levels were suppressed. frizzled- <dig> is a receptor for norrin  <cit>  and presumably wnts, which promote osteoblast progenitor proliferation and survival  <cit> . in contrast, murine frizzled- <dig> is a negative regulator of bone formation  <cit> ; thus its suppression is consistent with differentiation promotion by hdis. no other components of the wnt signaling pathway were significantly regulated by all hdis at the 18-hour time point.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified many osteoblast genes whose expression levels are altered by hdis. all genes we have tested to date are similarly differentially regulated in both mc3t3-e <dig> cells and primary murine calvarial osteoblasts. these data improve our understanding of how hdis promote osteoblast differentiation by identifying genes that are altered within the first  <dig> hours of hdac inhibition.
