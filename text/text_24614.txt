BACKGROUND
cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic, yeast-like fungus that is a significant threat to immunocompromised individuals such as patients with hiv/aids  <cit> . the ability of c. neoformans to cause disease depends on the production of virulence factors including a polysaccharide capsule, melanin deposition in the cell wall, the ability to grow at 37 °c, and the secretion of extracellular enzymes . extracellular enzymes with roles in virulence include phospholipases, which hydrolyze ester bonds and aid in the degradation and destabilization of host cell membranes and cell lysis, and urease, which hydrolyzes urea to ammonia and carbamate, inducing a localized increase in ph . proteinases may also cause tissue damage, provide nutrients to the pathogen and facilitate migration to the central nervous system . in general, the secretion of extracellular enzymes is important for fungal survival within the host but a comprehensive investigation of the secretome and its regulation by the cyclic-amp/protein kinase a  signal transduction pathway has not been performed for c. neoformans.

the camp/pka pathway regulates capsule production, melanin formation, mating, and virulence in c. neoformans . components of the pathway include a gα protein , adenylyl cyclase , adenylyl cyclase-associated protein , a candidate receptor , phosphodiesterases , and the pka catalytic  and regulatory  subunits. in response to environmental signals, including exogenous methionine and nutrient starvation, the g-protein coupled receptor , gpr <dig> undergoes a conformational change to activate cacl and subsequently stimulate the production of camp. mutations in genes encoding the gpa <dig>  cac <dig>  aca <dig>  and pka <dig> proteins result in reduced formation of capsule and melanin, as well as sterility and attenuated virulence in a mouse model of cryptococcosis  <cit> . in particular, pka <dig> is a key regulator of virulence in c. neoformans. in contrast, disruption of the gene encoding pkr <dig> results in enlargement of the capsule and hypervirulence  <cit> .

previous transcriptional profiling experiments compared a wild-type strain with pka1Δ and pkr1Δ mutants of c. neoformans, and identified differences in transcript levels for genes related to cell wall synthesis, transport , the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and glycolysis  <cit> . differential expression patterns were also observed for genes encoding ribosomal proteins, stress and chaperone functions, secretory pathway components and phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes. specifically, loss of pka <dig> influenced the expression of genes involved in secretion, and pka <dig> was hypothesized to influence capsule formation by regulating expression of secretory pathway components that control the export of capsular polysaccharide to the cell surface. additionally, the secretion inhibitors brefeldin a, nocodazole, monensin, and nem reduced capsule size, a phenotype similar to that observed in a pka <dig> mutant  <cit> . in general, the mechanisms and components required for the export of capsule polysaccharide and other virulence factors in c. neoformans are poorly understood. beyond the role of pka, other studies have examined exocytosis functions , the secretion of phospholipases, and the involvement of extracellular vesicles . additionally, o’meara et al.  recently demonstrated that pka influences capsule attachment via phosphorylation of the ph-responsive transcription factor rim <dig>  a key regulator of cell wall functions.

the role of pka in secretion in c. neoformans has also been examined with strains carrying galactose-inducible and glucose-repressible versions of pka <dig> and pkr <dig> constructed by inserting the gal <dig> promoter upstream of the genes  <cit> . elevated pka <dig> activity, stimulated by growth of the pgal7::pka <dig> strain in galactose-containing media, was found to influence capsule thickness, cell size, ploidy, and vacuole enlargement  <cit> . the authors also showed that pka <dig> activity was required for wild-type levels of melanization and laccase activity, and influenced the correct localization of laccase. the ability to regulate expression of pka <dig> and, subsequently, the activity of pka <dig>  is a powerful tool for investigating the mechanisms of its influence on the secretion of virulence factors and secretory pathway components.

in this study, we used the strain with galactose-inducible and glucose-repressible expression of pka <dig> to investigate the influence of pka <dig> on the secretome using quantitative proteomics. we identified  <dig> different secreted proteins and found that pka <dig> regulated the extracellular abundance of five. these proteins included three enzymes , the cig <dig> protein  associated with virulence and heme uptake, and a novel protein containing a carbohydrate-binding domain . we also observed a change in the secretome profile under pka1-inducing conditions from proteins involved primarily in catabolic and metabolic processes to an expanded set that included proteins for translational regulation and the response to stress. enrichment analysis of our pka1-influenced secretome data compared to the whole genome showed over-representation of genes associated with a broad spectrum of processes including metabolic and catabolic processing. although no enrichment was observed between our secretome data and the fungal secretome knowledgebase , a comparison of go terms between the data sets showed the majority of our identified proteins to be represented in the funseckb. next, we exploited our secretome data using a targeted proteomics approach to identify potential biomarkers of cryptococcal infection. multiple reaction monitoring  in the presence of stable isotope dilutions  allows for identification and quantification of specific peptides in a sample. specifically, we were able to identify pka1-regulated proteins of c. neoformans in host samples including blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and infected macrophage lysates. overall, our study reveals that the camp/pka pathway regulates specific components of the secretome including the cig <dig> and aph <dig> proteins that contribute to virulence in c. neoformans.

RESULTS
control of pka <dig> expression results in a change of the protein secretion profile
given the virulence defect of a pka <dig> mutant, we hypothesized that pka <dig> influences the secretion of proteins associated with the virulence and survival of c. neoformans in the host. to test this idea, we quantitatively identified proteins secreted by c. neoformans in the context of regulated expression of pka <dig>  for our initial analysis, we collected supernatant cultures of wt and pgal7::pka <dig> strains grown under pka1-repressed  and pka1-induced  conditions at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 120 h post-inoculation , and analyzed the samples using quantitative mass spectrometry. the analysis of these supernatant samples resulted in the identification of  <dig>  and  <dig>  proteins under pka1-repressed and pka1-induced conditions, respectively . as shown in table  <dig>   <dig> proteins were identified and quantified under pka1-repressed and pka1-induced conditions at the specified time-points. we found that none of the changes in protein abundance between the two conditions were statistically significant  and therefore, concluded that pka <dig> did not influence the abundance of any of the observed proteins under the conditions tested. however, upon comparison of the unique proteins identified under either pka1-repressed or pka1-induced conditions, using gene ontology  term biological classifications at all time points, we were able to observe overall changes in the secretome profiles under the influence of pka <dig> . additional differentially expressed proteins may be present in the samples, but we were unable to measure their abundance and they were therefore not included for further analysis. under pka1-repressed conditions, the majority of secreted proteins were associated with catabolic and metabolic , unknown , and hypothetical  processes , with additional proteins associated with transport , oxidation-reduction processes , dephosphorylation , proteolysis , glycolysis , and regulation of transcription . conversely, a change in the secretome profile was observed under the pka1-induction condition. here, we again observed the majority of proteins to be associated with catabolic and metabolic , unknown , and hypothetical  processes . a slight decline was found for proteins associated with transport , oxidation-reduction processes , dephosphorylation , proteolysis , and regulation of transcription . however, a greater emphasis was found for proteins associated with glycolysis , response to stress , translation , and nucleosome assembly . although, our secretome analysis at specific times did not identify pka1-regulated proteins, a change toward the secretion of proteins for glycolysis, translational regulation, nucleosome assembly, and the response to stress was observed upon induction of pka <dig> expression.table  <dig> proteins identified in the secretome of c. neoformans collected at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hpi grown in pka1-repressed  and pka1-induced  conditions

identification of secreted proteins regulated by pka1
given that we identified secreted proteins from strains with modulated pka <dig> activity, but did not observe any proteins whose abundance was directly regulated by pka <dig>  we extended our analysis to examine protein secretion at an intermediate time point of  <dig> hpi, and we used an alternative, less stringent method for protein precipitation . we chose an end-point collection time of  <dig> hpi based on our coverage of a range of other time points in the previous analysis and because this time was sufficient for the culture to reach stationary phase and to accumulate proteins in the extracellular environment. additionally, because we did not observe changes in protein abundance under regulation of pka <dig> following the time-point analysis, we used the alternative protein precipitation method in an attempt to obtain a more comprehensive view of the secretome. we collected supernatant cultures of wt and pgal7::pka <dig> strains grown under pka1-repressed  and pka1-induced  conditions at  <dig> hpi and analyzed the samples using quantitative mass spectrometry. similar trends in protein abundance were observed for the majority of proteins in both experimental approaches    <cit> . although the variability of the time-point analysis was relatively high, the reproducibility observed from the end-point analysis suggested that collecting the samples at different time-points impacted the protein abundance and contributed to the observed variability. this impact may be associated with culture sampling, as well as changes in capsule production during the early- to mid-log growth phases of the fungal cultures  <cit> . we identified  <dig> proteins under pka1-repressed conditions of which  <dig> were successfully dimethyl-labeled and quantified . these  <dig> proteins covered a broad spectrum of biological classifications  for go terms, including proteins associated with catabolic and metabolic processes, ubiquitination, transport, dephosphorylation, glycolysis, oxidation-reduction, translation, proteolysis, and the response to stress. under pka1-induced conditions, we identified  <dig> proteins, of which  <dig> were successfully dimethyl-labeled and quantified . these  <dig> proteins covered  <dig> biological classifications for go terms and included proteins associated with catabolic and metabolic processes, along with ubiquitination, transport, dephosphorylation, oxidation-reduction, proteolysis, and the response to stress. in total,  <dig> proteins were present under both pka1-repressed and pka1-induced conditions. a comparison of changes in abundance under pka1-repressed and pka1-induced conditions of these  <dig> proteins revealed that five showed statistically significant differences  in abundance in response to regulation of pka <dig> . we concluded that the extracellular abundance of these five proteins was influenced by pka and we focused our subsequent analysis on these proteins. under pka1-induced conditions, a cytokine-inducing glycoprotein , an α-amylase, a glyoxal oxidase, and a novel protein  each showed an increase in abundance, whereas an acid phosphatase  showed a decrease in abundance. taken together, these findings suggest that pka <dig> regulates the extracellular abundance of specific proteins secreted by c. neoformans.table  <dig> proteins identified in the secretome of c. neoformans collected at  <dig> hpi from cells grown in pka1-repressed  conditions

gene ontology analyses of the secretome revealed enrichment of proteins associated with metabolic and catabolic processes
based on our identification and quantification of  <dig> proteins in the secretome of c. neoformans, we next sought to classify the corresponding genes according to their go terms of biological process, cellular component, and molecular function. our goal was to assess whether subsets of genes showed significant over-representation relative to all genes in c. neoformans. to perform the enrichment analysis, all unique proteins identified under pka1-repressed conditions were combined into a single data set as were proteins identified under pka1-induced conditions. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the identified secreted proteins under pka1-repressed conditions were enriched in  <dig> biological categories, with the most significant enrichment associated with carbohydrate metabolic process, catabolic process, generation of precursor metabolites and energy, organic substance metabolic process, and primary metabolic process. under pka1-induced conditions, enrichment was only associated with the five most significantly enriched categories under pka1-repressed conditions. classification by cellular components showed the most significant enrichment associated with the cytoplasm under both conditions, which may be an artifact of the classification process or indicative of the location of protein synthesis , whereas classification by molecular function showed no enrichment.fig.  <dig> enrichment of genes represented in the secretome analysis of cells grown under pka1-repressed and pka1-induced conditions compared to all genes present in the wt strain. the enrichment is based on go terms associated with biological processes



our gene sets were also compared to all reported secreted proteins in the fungal secretome knowledge base  for c. neoformans strain jec <dig>  <cit> . the analysis showed no significant enrichment; however, similarities among the identified go terms were observed . forty-seven go term categories were shared between the funseckb and our identified proteins under pka1-repressed and pka1-induced conditions; the greatest number of proteins being associated with metabolic processes. twenty-five categories were represented only in our secretome data, and one category  was represented only in the funseckb. upon comparison of go term categories for cellular components,  <dig> categories were shared between the funseckb and our identified proteins under pka1-repressed and pka1-induced conditions; the greatest number of proteins being associated with the cell, cytoplasm, and intracellular categories . upon comparison of go term categories for molecular function,  <dig> categories were shared between the funseckb and our identified proteins under pka1-repressed and pka1-induced conditions; the greatest number of proteins associated with binding as well as enzyme activity . taken together, the enrichment analysis of our secretome data under modulation of pka <dig> activity compared to the whole genome showed over-representation of genes associated with a broad spectrum of processes including metabolic and catabolic processing. although no enrichment was observed between our secretome data and the funseckb, a comparison of go terms between the data sets showed all but one of our identified proteins to be represented in the funseckb.fig.  <dig> comparison of go terms classifications of biological processes from the identified secreted proteins from cells grown under pka1-repressed and pka1-induced conditions compared to proteins represented in the fungal secretome knowledgebase



a bioinformatic analysis of the secretome predicts modes of secretion
we next examined the secreted proteins, under modulation of pka <dig> activity, for the presence of predicted signal peptides and gpi anchors. specifically, we used signalp  <dig> , signal-3 l, and phobius for the prediction of protein extracellular location based on the presence or absence of n-terminal signal peptides. the presence of a signal peptide suggests conventional secretion versus potential non-conventional export if a signal peptide is absent. additionally, we used gpi-som to predict the presence or absence of a gpi-anchor on proteins, indicative of plasma membrane association, which may or may not be capable of dissociation and subsequent protein secretion. of the  <dig> proteins used for this analysis,  <dig> had both an n-terminal signal peptide and a gpi-anchor protein,  <dig> had only an n-terminal signal peptide, one had a gpi-anchor but no n-terminal signal peptide, and  <dig> proteins did not have an n-terminal signal peptide or a gpi-anchor . taken together, these results suggest that c. neoformans may employ a non-conventional secretory pathway for regulation of part of its secretome, including potential protein secretion via vesicle export  <cit> .table  <dig> bioinformatic analysis of identified and quantified proteins in the secretome of c. neoformans under pka1-repressed and pka1-induced conditions

examination of transcription and protein abundance in the context of pka <dig> regulation
based on our identification and quantification of five secreted proteins regulated by pka <dig> in c. neoformans, we evaluated whether transcript levels were also influenced by pka <dig> regulation and whether there was a correlation with the observed regulation of protein abundance. specifically, we performed qrt-pcr on rna collected at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi from cells grown in pka1-repressed and pka1-induced conditions for the wt and pgal7::pka <dig> strains, and compared the observed values to our quantitative proteomic results at  <dig> hpi. figure  <dig> summarizes the rna expression levels at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi and protein abundance at  <dig> hpi for cig <dig>  the acid phosphatase aph <dig>  an α-amylase, a glyoxal oxidase, and a novel protein . cig <dig> and the novel protein both showed down-regulation of their transcripts under pka1-repressed conditions at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi, followed by minimal or slight up-regulation with induced pka <dig> activity. α-amylase and glyoxal oxidase showed an initial peak in transcript levels at  <dig> hpi, followed by minimal change or a decrease in rna levels at  <dig> hpi under pka1-repressed conditions, and the transcript levels decreased in response to pka <dig> induction. acid phosphatase showed elevated transcript levels upon pka <dig> repression at both time points, compared to a drop in rna levels at  <dig> hpi or no change at  <dig> hpi upon induction of pka <dig>  in general, pka <dig> appears to positively regulate the transcript levels of cig <dig> and the novel protein , and to negatively regulate the transcript levels of the other three proteins. taken together, our results suggest that although pka <dig> activity influences the transcript levels and extracellular abundance of the five proteins, a correlation between transcript and protein levels was not always observed, and this was particularly notable for glyoxal oxidase. the differences may indicate additional levels of potential influence of pka <dig> beyond transcriptional regulation, including differences in mrna versus protein stability, the timing of expression and the regulation of protein export. for example, more detailed studies will be needed to examine the timing of intracellular and extracellular accumulation of the glyoxal oxidase protein relative to transcription of the gene.fig.  <dig> comparison of rna expression levels using qrt-pcr to analyze samples from cells at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi, versus secreted protein abundance using quantitative proteomics at  <dig> hpi under pka1-repressed and pka1-induced conditions. the samples were evaluated in triplicate, and values are reported as average log <dig> quantification ± standard deviation



detection of secreted pka1-regulated proteins using multiple reaction monitoring
based on our identification of five pka1-regulated proteins, including two with roles in virulence, we hypothesized that these proteins would be secreted during infection and that they might be potentially useful biomarkers of cryptococcosis. to test this idea, we used multiple reaction monitoring , a powerful and targeted proteomics approach for the relative quantitative measurement of target proteins. in the presence of an internal standard, a stable isotope-labeled peptide, the amount of natural protein can be measured by comparing the signals to the labeled species. the isotopically labeled, proteotypic peptides terminate with c-terminal heavy arginine or lysine . in principle, the stable isotopes have the same physiochemical properties as the natural peptides and only differ by mass resulting in co-elution of the peptides. however, studies have suggested that in the presence of complex biological samples, such as blood or serum, the retention times between the peptides can shift, impacting the co-elution patterns  <cit> . we specifically applied mrm to detect cig <dig>  aph <dig>  glyoxal oxidase, α-amylase, and the novel protein  in samples from a macrophage-like cell line and from infected mice.

the samples from the j774a. <dig> macrophage-like cell line came from cells inoculated with wt and pgal7::pka <dig> strains under pka1-repressed  and pka1-induced  conditions. intracellular uptake at  <dig> hpi showed a significant difference in the number of colony forming units  per macrophage between the wt and pgal7::pka <dig> strains under pka1-repressed conditions, but not under induced conditions . this difference is most likely due to the absence of the capsule for the pka1-repressed cells, a phenotype that enhances phagocytosis. by  <dig> hpi, rates of intracellular fungal cells per macrophage were significantly different for wt and pgal7::pka <dig> strains under both conditions . specifically, intracellular rates of infection at  <dig> hpi in repressed conditions were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % for the wt and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % for pgal7::pka <dig> strains. however, intracellular rates under induced conditions were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % for wt and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % for pgal7::pka <dig> strains. importantly, intracellular uptake rates showed no differences between wt, pgal7::pka <dig>  and the pka1Δ strains under controlled growth conditions ) at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi . these results indicate that modulation of pka <dig> expression influences the intracellular survival of cryptococcal cells.fig.  <dig> interactions of wt and pka1-regulated strains with j774a. <dig> murine macrophages. a intracellular rate at  <dig> hpi of wt and p

mrm on macrophage lysates infected with fungal cells at  <dig> hpi identified the pka1-regulated and secreted proteins α-amylase and glyoxal oxidase in both induced and repressed conditions. figure  <dig> shows representative chromatographic co-elution patterns of the isotopically-labeled and natural peptides, which allowed for relative quantification of peptides in the replicates of the experiment. for both enzymes, the highest amount of protein was detected in the wt strain in dmem medium under pka1-repressed conditions, whereas the pgal7::pka <dig> strain under pka1-induction showed the lowest amount of secreted protein. this observation may be associated with reduced intracellular rates of the pgal7::pka <dig> strain due to the presence of an enlarged capsule. overall, we were able to detect  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fmol of α-amylase and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fmol of glyoxal oxidase in 5 μg of total protein from the macrophage lysate following the uptake of pgal7::pka <dig> under pka1-induced conditions at  <dig> hpi.fig.  <dig> detection of pka1-regulated proteins in lysates of macrophage-like cells containing c. neoformans. chromatographic representation of the most abundant peptide and its transition for α-amylase  identified from isotopically-labeled peptide or natural peptide for each of the following samples: a macrophage lysate challenged with wt cells grown in  <dig>  % glucose;  macrophage lysate challenged with wt cells grown in  <dig>  % galactose;  macrophage lysate challenged with p

discussion
the secretion of extracellular enzymes and virulence-associated factors is important for the proliferation and survival of pathogens in the host environment. for the pathogenic yeast c. neoformans, virulence depends to a large extent on the export of polysaccharide to form a capsule, as well as targeted delivery of laccase to the cell wall for deposition of melanin, and secretion of extracellular enzymes  <cit> . the cyclic-amp/protein kinase a signal transduction pathway plays a key role in regulating these processes but the underlying mechanisms remain to be understood in detail  <cit> . we therefore used a pgal7::pka <dig> strain under pka1-repressed and pka1-induced conditions in this study to investigate the influence of pka <dig> on the secretome of c. neoformans. quantitative proteomics allowed us to identify  <dig> different proteins in the secretome including a subset of five whose abundance was regulated by pka <dig>  these five proteins include a cytokine-inducing glycoprotein , an α-amylase, a glyoxal oxidase, an acid phosphatase , and a novel protein . we also observed a change in the secretome profile upon induction of pka <dig> expression thus establishing a view of the impact of pka activity on the extracellular protein composition. in general, this analysis highlighted the enrichment of pka1-regulated biological processes in the secretome, revealed potential targets for conventional and non-conventional modes of secretion, and provided candidate biomarkers for investigating cryptococcosis.

modulation of pka <dig> expression leads to a change in the secretome
our analysis revealed a change in the abundance of secreted c. neoformans proteins associated with glycolysis, translational regulation, nucleosome assembly, and stress response over a time course from  <dig> to 120 h. we speculate that some of these proteins may result from packaging in vesicles known to transit through the cell wall and accumulate in the extracellular environment  <cit> . in this case, modulation of pka activity may indirectly influence the proteome of vesicles as a reflection of an impact on the intracellular proteome. this idea is supported by our observed influence of pka <dig> modulation on the abundance of the translation machinery because ribosomal proteins, in particular, are abundant in extracellular vesicles  <cit> . it is also well known that pka influences the transcription of ribosomal protein genes in other organisms and this influence is conserved in c. neoformans  <cit> . our analysis of the intracellular proteome also revealed suppression of ribosomal cellular protein abundance upon induction of pka <dig> . we also observed a connection between pka <dig> activation and the abundance of glycolytic proteins. this is interesting in light of previous reports demonstrating the importance of glycolysis for virulence and the persistence of c. neoformans in the cerebral spinal fluid  <cit> . these findings are consistent with a previous analysis of the transcriptome, which showed that pka <dig> influences the levels of transcript for genes involved in glycolysis  <cit> . furthermore, the observed influence of pka <dig> induction on the secretion of proteins associated with stress response is consistent with observed pka <dig> regulation at the transcriptional level. in this context, we identified a heat shock protein  <dig> , which is associated with the response to stress and which was previously localized to the cell surface of c. neoformans  <cit> . the observed connection between the stress response and pka <dig> induction may indicate coordination for facilitation of fungal survival and proliferation during colonization of vertebrate hosts.

pka <dig> regulation of mannoproteins and cell wall functions: connections with rim101
the influence of pka on the abundance of the mannoprotein cig <dig> is of particular interest because we previously showed that its transcript is one of the most abundant in cells grown in low iron medium  <cit> . in addition, the protein is important for iron acquisition from heme and virulence in c. neoformans  <cit> . we found that the extracellular abundance of cig <dig> increased upon induction of pka <dig> and that transcript levels and protein abundance were well correlated. cig <dig> is positively regulated by the ph-responsive transcription factor rim <dig>  which in turn is activated by the camp/pka pathway  <cit> . therefore, the regulation of cig <dig> mrna and cig <dig> protein levels observed upon induction of pka <dig> likely reflect regulation by rim <dig>  this finding is consistent with recent discoveries that rim <dig> controls cell wall composition and capsule attachment via an influence on the expression of cell wall biosynthetic genes  <cit> .

in general, a number of proteins associated with cell wall synthesis and integrity, pathogenesis and the immune response were prominent in the secretome of c. neoformans upon modulation of pka <dig> expression. these proteins included an endo- <dig> -β glucanase and a  <dig> -β-glucanosyltransferase, both of which have been previously identified in studies of the extracellular proteomes of c. neoformans and other fungal pathogens such as histoplasma capsulatum . endo- <dig> -β glucanase is located in the surface layers of the cell wall or in the capsule and has roles in metabolism, autolysis, and cell separation  <cit> . the  <dig> -β-glucanosyltransferase is described as a glycolipid protein anchored to the cell membrane in yeasts and may have a role in virulence  <cit> . our proteomic analysis also identified chitin deacetylases associated with the formation of chitin and cell wall integrity, and the enzyme laccase, which is responsible for melanin deposition in the cell wall and influences cryptococcal virulence . these findings are consistent with our previous transcriptomic analysis, which revealed an influence of pka on the expression of cell wall associated genes  <cit> .

we also identified a novel protein  with a pattern of mrna and protein regulation by pka <dig> activity that was quite similar to that of cig <dig>  this novel protein contains a predicted carbohydrate-binding domain and was annotated as a macrophage-activating glycoprotein . these observations suggest that further investigation is warranted for this protein in the context of iron acquisition and virulence. this idea is reinforced by the finding that rim <dig> also positively regulates expression of the cnag_ <dig> gene  <cit> . interestingly, the cnag_ <dig> gene is also regulated at the transcript level by the transcription factor gat <dig> that, like pka <dig>  influences capsule size, virulence, and uptake by macrophages  <cit> . considering these similar phenotypes, it is possible that gat <dig> and pka1/rim <dig> both regulate the expression of the cnag_ <dig> protein and subsequently influence the activation of macrophages during infection. overall, our investigation of the secretome reinforced connections between modulation of pka <dig> activity, rim <dig> and cell wall integrity, and it revealed an impact of pka on the extracellular abundance of proteins with known  and potential  influences on virulence.

pka <dig> influences the secretion of α-amylase and glyoxal oxidase enzymes
pka <dig> also positively regulated the abundance in the secretome of an α-amylase and a glyoxal oxidase which were previously identified in the extracellular proteome of c. neoformans  <cit> . amylases are associated with carbohydrate metabolism, particularly starch degradation for energy production  <cit> . in c. neoformans, the secretion of amylases in the pka-regulated strains was reported previously and we were able to measure and confirm α-amylase activity in the extracellular medium  <cit> . glyoxal oxidases are extracellular h2o2-producing enzymes associated with cellulose metabolism  <cit> . there is evidence that glyoxal oxidase activity is involved in filamentous growth and pathogenicity of ustilago maydis, as well as fertility in cryptococcus gattii  <cit> . a similar pattern in response to pka <dig> expression was observed upon comparison of the transcript and protein levels for both the α-amylase and the glyoxal oxidase. a direct correlation between transcript levels and protein abundance was not as evident as for cig <dig>  this could potentially be due to post-transcriptional regulation, differences in mrna and protein half-lives and issues with timing  <cit> . it is also possible that pka may regulate additional processes to influence extracellular protein abundance, such as the activity of the secretory pathway. overall, the secretome data revealed a new connection between pka regulation and the α-amylase and glyoxal oxidase enzymes, and this discovery indicates that further analysis of their potential roles in virulence is warranted.

pka <dig> influences the secretion of the virulence-associated acid phosphatase, aph1
the extracellular abundance of the acid phosphatase aph <dig> and its transcript levels were negatively regulated by induction of pka <dig> expression thus revealing an opposite pattern of regulation compared with the other four genes. phosphatases have been predicted to have roles in cell wall biosynthesis, cell signaling, phosphate scavenging, and in adhesion of c. neoformans to epithelial cells . the aph <dig> gene was recently characterized and its expression was found to be induced by phosphate limitation; the aph <dig> protein was also the major conventionally secreted acid phosphatase in c. neoformans  <cit> . aph <dig> was also shown to hydrolyze a variety of substrates to potentially scavenge phosphate from the environment, and an aph <dig> deletion mutant had a slight virulence defect in both galleria mellonella and mouse models of cryptococcosis. the latter phenotype is consistent with our recent study showing that a high affinity phosphate uptake system is required for growth on low-phosphate medium, for formation of the virulence factors melanin and capsule, for survival in macrophages, and for virulence in mice  <cit> . this study also revealed that defects in pka influence the growth of c. neoformans on phosphate-limited medium. our discovery of pka regulation of aph <dig> abundance in the secretome therefore further reinforces a connection between phosphate acquisition and pka regulation associated with virulence.

pka regulation and the intersection of secretome studies in c. neoformans
our profiling of the secretome upon modulation of pka <dig> activity confirmed the presence of previously identified extracellular and vesicular proteins, including those associated with virulence and fungal survival within the host, as well as novel secreted proteins. we identified the classically secreted c. neoformans protein, laccase, associated with fungal virulence, but other proteins such as urease and phospholipase b were not identified in our study. their absence could be attributed to growth conditions, precipitation methods, supernatant collection times, and relative abundance in the secretome. a recent proteome study that removed free capsular polysaccharide from the extracellular environment identified  <dig> secreted proteins and a direct comparison with our study showed an overlap of 52 %  <cit> . previous investigation of the proteins in extracellular vesicles of c. neoformans also showed an overlap of nearly 56 % with proteins identified in our study  <cit> . this overlap is primarily associated with proteins not typically expected in the secretome. for example, atp subunits/carriers, translation elongation factor, actin, and multiple ribosomal proteins were identified and their presence was attributed to packaging in extracellular vesicles, and not necessarily due to direct secretion. in the absence of an n-terminal signal peptide, proteins may be exported via non-conventional secretion. this may include the use of membrane-bound, extracellular vesicles capable of traversing the cell wall, the possible fusion of multi-vesicular bodies with the plasma membrane, or the capture of cytosolic material to form vesicles , as discussed above . taken together, our profile of secreted proteins in c. neoformans is in agreement with previous secretome studies. however, our ability to modulate pka <dig> activity provides an opportunity to identify novel proteins in the extracellular environment as well as identify proteins specifically regulated by pka <dig>  this approach led to the unique identification of the novel secreted protein  that was specifically associated with modulation of pka <dig> activity and not found in other proteomic studies.

detection of potential biomarkers during cryptococcal infection
biomarkers are indicators of normal or pathogenic processes as well as the efficacy of therapy  <cit> . in this regard, targeted detection of secreted cryptococcal proteins provides an opportunity to identify potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of infection and to monitor antifungal therapy. early and rapid diagnosis remains limited for systemic fungal infections, such as those caused by candida and aspergillus species, as well as c. neoformans and c. gattii  <cit> . biomarkers of infection by specific fungal species would therefore be valuable for identification and for precise measurements of fungal burden. a recent study using the presence of the cell wall component galactomannan in bal as a diagnostic tool for invasive fungal disease highlights an opportunity for biomarker discovery in fungal pathogens  <cit> . additionally, the use of targeted proteomics  is a novel approach to study the secretion of virulence factors in c. neoformans, particularly in the context of signaling functions like pka that sense conditions relevant to the host environment.

the secreted proteins that we identified to be regulated in abundance by pka <dig> provide an opportunity to develop diagnostic biomarkers that are also informative about signaling via the camp/pka pathway in vitro and during infection. for example, cig <dig> is an important candidate biomarker given its abundance in iron-starved cells and its role in virulence through iron acquisition and uptake. our ability to detect cig <dig> in the blood and bal fluid of infected animals confirms its expression and establishes the protein as a potential biomarker. these findings may also indicate a role for cig <dig> in iron uptake in these environments although, interestingly, we did not detect cig <dig> in macrophage lysates. based on our observed differences in intracellular replication, pka <dig> seems to impact the intracellular environment of macrophages. in this regard, we did detect the glyoxal oxidase and α-amylase proteins by mrm in macrophages containing cryptococcal cells. expression of these proteins has not previously been reported during interactions with macrophages, although the production of h2o <dig> and induction of oxidative stress via glyoxal oxidase could potentially influence intracellular survival. it is known that oxidative stress induces autophagy in macrophages and can impair phagocytic activity  <cit> . additionally, loss of an α-amylase in h. capsulatum attenuated the ability of the fungus to kill macrophages and to colonize murine lungs  <cit> . this influence appeared to be related to the ability to produce α--glucan. the regulation of glyoxal oxidase and α-amylase by pka <dig> activity and their detection in macrophage lysates suggests that it would be interesting to examine the roles of these enzymes in intracellular survival and virulence. our approach with mrm is also informative about tissue specific expression of fungal proteins during disease. in addition to the examples described above, we found that colonization of murine lungs resulted in secretion of α-amylase, glyoxal oxidase and the novel protein from gene cnag_ <dig>  the novel protein was also found in blood and, given its similar regulation with cig <dig> these results suggest future studies on the role of this protein in iron acquisition and virulence.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we characterized the overall impact of pka <dig> modulation on the secretome and discovered five proteins regulated by pka <dig>  the identified proteins had known roles associated with cell wall functions, fungal survival within the host, and virulence. our identification of a novel protein with potential roles in iron uptake and virulence also suggested a previously unknown connection between pka <dig> and gat <dig>  we were also able to detect pka1-regulated secreted proteins in biological samples as potential biomarkers, providing a new opportunity for diagnosing fungal infection and monitoring disease progression.
