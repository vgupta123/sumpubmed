BACKGROUND
the genetic improvement of grain yield in major cereals has traditionally been one of the most important contributions to an increased global food supply. gains via phenotypic selection have been steady but slow over the years, and the ever-growing world population makes it necessary to increase the rate of gain in grain yields over what has been achieved in the past. grain size and weight are important components of grain yield, but the genetic basis of these traits in maize , one of the most important global food staples, is insufficiently understood. to date, several loci have been shown to affect maize kernel development through mutant analysis  <cit> , but only one gene  has been found to affect kernel size and weight in a natural population of maize  <cit> . with the successful completion of the b <dig> genome sequencing project, more than  <dig>  genes have been identified  <cit> ; this provides a good opportunity for qtl cloning and function verification. however, the identification of genes related to grain yield is still a great challenge because of complexity of this trait. qtls cloned to date suggest that genes with various functions can affect grain yield, including genes involved in protein degradation  <cit> , hormone metabolism  <cit> , and other processes  <cit> . so many genetic factors affect final grain yield that it has even been suggested that the entire genome may be involved  <cit> .

comparative qtl mapping studies have shown that some qtl for many traits, including grain yield, are located on collinear chromosomes in different species  <cit> . this suggests that mutations in orthologous genes contribute to similar trait variation. if the current, similar function of the genes was gained following divergence of the different species being compared, the mutations will be completely independent, and may be dissimilar in nature. this has been seen in the well-known "green revolution" genes rht in wheat, gai in arabidopsis and dwarf <dig> in maize, which all contribute to short plant stature  <cit> .

the availability of the rice genomic sequences  <cit>  facilitated the identification of many genes controlling grain size and weight  <cit> . the gw <dig> gene was the first gene controlling grain width to be cloned in rice. it encodes a ring-type protein with e <dig> ubiquitin ligase activity, and functions as a negative regulator of grain width and weight. a  <dig> bp deletion in the fourth exon resulting in a premature stop codon and a truncation of  <dig> amino acids causes the increase in rice grain width and weight  <cit> . only one copy of gw <dig> exists in rice, but a search of the latest b <dig> genomic sequence identified two homologous gene sequences  <cit> . whether both maize genes represent co-orthologs of the rice gw <dig> gene has not been tested. besides, based on the conserved function found for various other genes, it is reasonable to suppose that the maize orthologs of rice gw <dig> may also affect grain size and weight, which needs to be tested further.

association analysis can identify genetic polymorphisms that are associated with phenotypic variation. compared with linkage analysis, it is time- and cost-effective. more importantly, it can investigate more than two alleles at the same time and can reach extraordinarily high resolution in species with rapid linkage disequilibrium  decay  <cit> . maize contains abundant genetic diversity and ld decays within  <dig> kb in diverse material  <cit> . this rapid ld decay pattern makes maize an ideal plant for association analysis to identify causal polymorphisms or closely linked polymorphisms, which can then be used to develop functional markers for marker-assisted selection  <cit> . to date, association analysis has been widely used in maize to dissect the genetic basis of complex traits, such as kernel carotenoid content  <cit> , kernel starch content  <cit> , kernel quality traits  <cit>  and flowering time  <cit> .

the objectives of this study were to clarify the relationship of the two maize genes that were found to be homologous to the rice gw <dig> gene; to investigate their evolutionary fate following the duplication of these genes in maize; and to characterize the contribution and putative function of these two genes in maize grain yield-related traits.

RESULTS
the rice gw <dig> gene has two co-orthologs located on duplicated chromosomes in maize
blast searches with the rice gw <dig> protein sequence  against the maize high throughput genomic sequence database  <cit>  identified two maize bacterial artificial chromosome  clones, ac <dig> on chromosome  <dig> and ac <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  that contain sequences showing high similarity to the rice protein. the structures of these two genes were determined using three maize complementary dna  clones from genbank, eu <dig>  fj <dig> and eu <dig>  which showed high sequence similarity to the two bac clones. both genes consist of eight exons, with an overall sequence similarity of 94% to each other and 93% to the rice gw <dig> gene across the coding region. they were named zmgw2-chr <dig> and zmgw2-chr <dig>  based on their locations on the maize chromosomes .

because the maize genome has been shown to be replete with duplicated chromosomal regions  <cit> , we investigated if the two homologs represent duplicated genes. as shown in figure 1a, other gene sequences in the vicinity of the two maize genes also show high similarity, as would arise following an ancient chromosome duplication event. comparison of the regions around both maize genes with the region containing rice gw <dig> showed that both maize regions are collinear with the rice region, indicating that the two maize genes are co-orthologs of the rice gw <dig> gene. besides, compared to the rice region containing gw <dig>  both maize regions contain an inversion .

phylogenetic analysis of the duplicated maize genes and their corresponding counterparts in sorghum, rice and barley showed that zmgw2-chr <dig> is more closely related to the sorghum counterpart than to the other maize copy , indicating that sequence divergence has occurred between the two maize genes. to identify the fixed polymorphic sites between the maize genes, we sequenced the coding regions of both genes in eight diverse maize lines belonging to five heterotic groups. in total, we found  <dig> fixed sites, of which  <dig> were synonymous mutations . all polymorphisms but two were snps. the  <dig> sites are not evenly distributed across the entire coding region, as 60% of the polymorphisms occurred in exon  <dig>  and no polymorphisms were found in exon  <dig> . only three snps were found in the ring domain, all of which were synonymous mutations, suggesting that this domain may have a conserved function in both genes.

zmgw2-chr <dig> is located within a qtl for hkw
zmgw2-chr <dig> and zmgw2-chr <dig> were located in maize chromosomal bins  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. previous studies have mapped many qtl for kernel weight to these two regions . in particular, in an f2: <dig> population  <cit>  and an immortalized f <dig>  population developed by our lab at the china agricultural university  <cit> , a qtl for hkw was mapped to bin  <dig>  . zmgw2-chr <dig> was mapped to  <dig> cm on chromosome  <dig>  between simple sequence repeat  markers bnlg <dig> and umc <dig>  and within the qtl confidence interval for hkw, near the left border of the qtl . this qtl was identified stably across four seasons and explained  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation in the if <dig> population derived from inbred lines zong <dig> and 87- <dig>  the zong <dig> allele can increase hkw from  <dig>  to  <dig>  g . although the large qtl confidence interval  contained lots of genes, the involvement of gw <dig> in hkw in rice and the co-location of zmgw2-chr <dig> with this qtl indicated that zmgw2-chr <dig> is a good candidate for this qtl and may be involved in grain weight variation.

genetic diversity and ld of the two genes across maize inbred lines
the genetic diversity within the ring domain was not analyzed because it is well conserved across the two maize genes . instead, we analyzed three regions of comparable sizes in corresponding regions of the two maize genes . the average levels of nucleotide diversity  in the two genes are comparable, both having about  <dig> nucleotide differences per  <dig>  sites between two random sequences across the entire genes . however, the nucleotide diversity is not evenly distributed across both genes. while the 5' end showed the most abundant diversity in zmgw2-chr <dig> , this region showed the fewest polymorphisms in zmgw2-chr <dig> . the middle portion of zmgw2-chr <dig> has only two polymorphisms, while the corresponding region of zmgw2-chr <dig> has  <dig> polymorphisms and the highest level of genetic diversity. tajima's d statistic was calculated to determine whether the two genes were subjected to selective constraints. as shown in table  <dig>  it appears that neither gene has been the subject of natural selection when the entire gene sequences were analyzed. because the selection effect may not extend throughout the entire gene  <cit> , we calculated tajima's d statistic separately for the three regions in each gene. the results showed that the middle portion of zmgw2-chr <dig>  has a significant positive tajima's d value, suggesting the presence of selection at this region, which is consistent with the observed low level of nucleotide diversity .

the ld decay patterns of the two genes shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig> indicate that both genes contain discrete ld blocks. in zmgw2-chr <dig>  a large ld block was observed at the 5' end , and in zmgw2-chr <dig>  a large ld block was observed in the middle portion . the only two polymorphisms in the middle portion of zmgw2-chr <dig> are in complete ld; thus, only two haplotypes were observed , consistent with the observed selection and reduced nucleotide diversity in this region. although ld extends in each of the three regions in both genes , ld among the three regions within both genes was within  <dig>  bp , consistent with previous results  <cit> . we further investigated ld between the two genes, only  <dig> % of r <dig> values for all pairs of polymorphisms was greater than  <dig> , and the largest r <dig> was less than  <dig> .

association analysis of four yield-related traits
analysis of variance  showed significant phenotypic variation for all four yield-related traits among the maize lines studied , indicating that the assembled panel is suitable for association analysis. a significant year by genotype effect was observed for all four traits. the phenotypic distributions ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mm for kl,  <dig>  to  <dig>  mm for kw,  <dig>  to  <dig>  mm for kt and  <dig>  to  <dig>  g for hkw; with an average of  <dig>  mm,  <dig>  mm,  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  g, respectively . significant positive phenotypic and genetic correlations between kw and kt, and between kernel size traits  and hkw were observed , indicating that an increase in any of the three kernel size traits can increase hkw, and thus perhaps grain yield.

the mixed model controlling for population structure  and kinship  as estimated using molecular markers  <cit>  was employed to test associations between the four yield-related traits and polymorphisms from the two maize genes. out of  <dig>  and  <dig> possible associations ,  <dig> and  <dig> associations were significant for zmgw2-chr <dig> and zmgw2-chr <dig>  respectively, at p ≤  <dig> ; while at p ≤  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> associations remained significant, indicating that the observed associations were not expected only by chance.

taking the ld  level among sites into account, seven and five sites from zmgw2-chr <dig> and zmgw2-chr <dig>  respectively, were significantly associated with at least one of the four yield-related traits at p ≤  <dig> . information on the location, genotype, frequency and probability value for each site can be found in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  the s <dig> site from zmgw2-chr <dig> was of great interest because it showed associations with kw and hkw across all three field experiments , and explained  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation for kw and hkw, respectively in beijing in  <dig>  this site also segregated in the if <dig> population and mapped to a region where a qtl for hkw was identified . three other sites from zmgw2-chr <dig>  and one site from zmgw2-chr <dig>  were significantly associated with kw in two out of the three field experiments; and sites s <dig> from zmgw2-chr <dig> and s <dig> from zmgw2-chr <dig> showed significant effects on kt in two out of the three field experiments. other trait/site associations identified in this study were significant in only one field experiment and could not be repeated across years and locations .

we further investigated whether the directions of effects in the association population were the same as what were predicted by the qtl mapping analysis of the if <dig> population . of the seven significant polymorphisms associated with hkw from zmgw2-chr <dig>  four segregated in the if <dig> population and could be tested. in the association panel, all four favourable alleles are from the inbred line 87- <dig> , while in the if <dig> population, the allele that increases hkw is from the other parent, zong <dig> . for zmgw2-chr <dig>  we did not detect any qtl for hkw in its vicinity in the if <dig> population. consistent with this result, the only polymorphism that showed significant association with hkw in the association panel did not segregate in the if <dig> population .

expression analyses of the two maize genes
real-time quantitative reverse transcription pcr  of  <dig> different tissues was performed to address whether the two maize genes had diverged expression patterns and whether these patterns were associated with a role in kernel development. as shown in figure 5a, expression trends of the two genes were quite similar, with a correlation coefficient of  <dig> , indicating no divergence between the two genes in the tissues examined. the highest expression levels were observed in immature ears for both genes, and expression levels were reduced in kernels after pollination, suggesting a role in kernel development. correlation analysis between the expression levels of the two genes and the four traits across  <dig> maize inbred lines showed that zmgw2-chr <dig> transcript abundance was negatively correlated with kw . however, despite the correlation between kw and the expression level of zmgw2-chr <dig>  and the association between kw and six zmgw2-chr <dig> polymorphisms , none of these polymorphisms affected the expression level of zmgw2-chr <dig>  no significant correlations were observed between zmgw2-chr <dig> transcript levels and any of the four traits.

discussion
evolution of the two maize genes
the collinear relationship between the rice region containing gw <dig> and the maize regions containing zmgw2-chr <dig> and zmgw2-chr <dig> suggested that the two maize genes are duplicated genes and both of them are co-orthologs of rice gw <dig> . previous studies consistently showed that maize has a segmental allotetraploid origin, in which the maize genome was thought to have arisen through hybridization of two ancestral diploids whose genomes had partially diverged, one of which shares a more recent common ancestor with the sorghum genome  <cit> . to clarify the relationship of the gw <dig> genes in maize and sorghum, we performed phylogenetic analysis with the gw <dig> protein sequences, which showed that zmgw2-chr <dig> is more closely related to its counterpart in sorghum than to zmgw2-chr <dig> . this finding supports the segmental allotetraploid origin of maize, and indicates that the two maize genes may have evolved independently for a period of time  <cit> .

three processes have been proposed to explain the evolutionary fates of duplicated genes within a species: non-functionalization, neo-functionalization and sub-functionalization. in non-functionalization, one of the duplicates accumulates deleterious mutations and eventually degenerates to a pseudogene or is lost from the genome  <cit> . occasionally, mutations in regulatory or coding regions can lead to novel gene function   <cit> . alternatively, both genes may experience some degeneration and lose partial functionality, but can complement each other . this can occur through partition of either protein domains or regulatory elements of the ancestral gene  <cit> . sequence analyses showed that zmgw2-chr <dig> and zmgw2-chr <dig> are highly conserved, with an overall similarity of 94% across the coding region. none of the mutations in either gene led to truncated proteins, and no non-synonymous nucleotide changes were observed in the ring domain. additionally, both genes are expressed across various tissues. thus, neither of the genes has experienced a non-functionalization process.

to assess if neo-functionalization and sub-functionalization have occurred, previous knowledge of the ancestral gene's function is required, which is usually unavailable. besides, both processes can occur through changes in regulatory or coding regions. therefore, we tested and distinguished the two processes by investigating whether reciprocal degenerations have occurred. for example, if one gene was expressed in roots and silenced in leaves, sub-functionalization requires that the other gene must be silenced in roots and expressed in leaves ; while neo-functionalization requires that the other gene must be silenced in both tissues so that the expression in roots could be assumed to be a new function. in zmgw2-chr <dig> and zmgw2-chr <dig>  the exon number, protein length and protein domain are all well conserved , with no protein domains lost or acquired, indicating that neo-functionalization or sub-functionalization through changes in the coding region had not occurred. we further investigated the expression patterns of the two genes across  <dig> maize tissues . although the promoter regions of the two genes are highly divergent, both genes were expressed in all of the  <dig> tissues and their expression levels were highly correlated , indicating that neither neo-functionalization nor sub-functionalization through changes in regulatory regions had occurred in the tissues examined. however, we could not exclude the possibility that the two genes may show divergent expression patterns under various environmental conditions or in specific cell types which have not been tested.

genetic variations in zmgw2-chr <dig> and zmgw2-chr <dig> are associated with kernel size and weight in maize
the orthologous relationship and high sequence conservation between the two maize genes and the rice gw <dig> suggest that zmgw2-chr <dig> and zmgw2-chr <dig> may perform similar functions as gw <dig> in rice. results from expression, linkage and association analyses corroborate this supposition. the expression levels of both maize genes varied according to the developmental stages of the ear or kernel , implying that they may be involved in ear or kernel development. this was further supported by association analysis. although the small size of the association mapping panel did not guarantee optimal power of association tests  <cit> , both genes were found to contain polymorphisms affecting at least one of the four yield-related traits . two more lines of evidence were presented to support a role of zmgw2-chr <dig> in kernel size and weight. one came from qtl mapping results , which placed zmgw2-chr <dig> within the confidence interval of a consistent qtl for hkw. another came from the negative correlation between the expression levels of zmgw2-chr <dig> and kw , indicating that down-regulation of this gene may lead to elevated kw, and thus grain yield. this is consistent with the negative function of gw <dig> in rice, where a truncated protein leads to an increase in grain size and weight  <cit> .

previous study with another yield-related gene, gs <dig>  showed that different polymorphisms underlie similar phenotypes in rice and maize  <cit> . here, we report a similar phenomenon. in rice, a  <dig> bp deletion in the fourth exon leads to a premature truncated protein and causes enhanced grain width and weight  <cit> , while in maize, mutations in other regions of zmgw2-chr <dig> and zmgw2-chr <dig> cause those phenotypes . however, we cannot exclude the possibility that the  <dig> bp deletion found in the rice gw <dig> gene also exists in maize, and would have been found if more  lines are sequenced for these genes. moreover, the genetic polymorphisms that were associated with phenotypic variation for kernel size and weight are different between the two maize genes, indicating that they probably affect kernel size and weight through different mechanisms.

in qtl analysis, the favourable allele for hkw is from the inbred line zong <dig> . in our association panel, the favourable alleles of all four polymorphisms that segregated in the qtl mapping population were from the other parental inbred line, 87- <dig> . three possible explanations may explain the discrepancy in the direction of allelic effects. one is that the associations are false positives created due to the possible presence of population structure and individual relatedness. the best statistical model to account for the effect of population structure and individual relatedness and control the false positive rate is the mixed linear model  <cit> . this was the model used in this study, with which we found that one polymorphism was consistently associated with hkw across three different environments, and the direction of the allelic effect was the same across these environments . for complex traits, such as hkw, the consistent detection of a significant association across various environments using a well-performed statistical model implies that the associations are not false positives.

a second possibility for the discrepancy is that we may not have identified the actual functional polymorphism, but rather only one linked to it. our evidence shows that zmgw2-chr <dig> and zmgw2-chr <dig> are associated with kernel size and weight in maize. however, it is still unclear what the actual causal polymorphism is  in each case because association analysis based on ld can identify neutral polymorphisms  in high ld with the actual functional polymorphism . when the detected polymorphism is in complete ld with the functional polymorphism, the favourable allele at the detected polymorphism can represent the favourable allele at the functional polymorphism completely. however, if recombination occurred between the two polymorphisms, some inbred lines would show a favourable allele at the detected polymorphism, but actually contain the unfavourable allele at the functional polymorphism. this cannot be detected in association analysis where the mean effects of all lines are measured, but can be detected in linkage analysis where only two lines  are involved.

a third possibility is the presence of other functional polymorphisms that we did not detect in the present study. the interval of a qtl usually spans 10- <dig> cm  <cit> , and can contain more than one gene involved in the expression of the same trait in some cases  <cit> . thus, the qtl effect actually represents the combined effect of all functional polymorphisms within the region. in the association analysis that included zong <dig> and 87- <dig>  we detected favourable alleles in zmgw2-chr <dig> from 87- <dig>  but if there were other unfavourable functional polymorphisms in zmgw2-chr <dig> or other possible genes within the qtl that were not measured in the association analysis, the mean effect would identify 87- <dig> as the unfavourable parent in the qtl mapping population. this is quite possible, because our correlation analysis also pointed to the presence of other functional polymorphisms. in this study, we found a significant negative correlation between the expression levels of zmgw2-chr <dig> and kw, but this correlation cannot be explained by the identified significant polymorphisms in the association analysis, implying the presence of other causal polymorphisms. these polymorphisms could be cis-acting elements far upstream of the genes, as in the case of tb <dig>  <cit> . alternatively, they could be unknown trans-acting elements hidden in the genome, as have been reported in the maize genome  <cit> . however, it is very difficult to identify upstream cis- or trans-acting elements using the candidate gene association analysis strategy. an alternative method to identify these elements and to further explore the genetic basis of complex quantitative traits is genome-wide association studies with high density marker coverage  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study investigated the relationship, evolutionary fate and function of two maize genes involved in kernel size and weight. the two genes represent chromosomal duplicates that are co-orthologs of gw <dig> in rice. the sequences of both genes are well conserved, with no mutations leading to a pseudo-molecule, and no new protein motifs were found, suggesting that both genes may have conserved functions in maize. expression and candidate gene-based association analyses suggested that both genes play a role in kernel size and weight variation, as does rice gw <dig>  however, the identified polymorphisms that contribute to phenotypic variation are different between the maize and rice genes and between the two maize genes, suggesting that the three genes may cause phenotypic variation through different mechanisms. mutant or transformation experiments would shed more light on this hypothesis. the conservation of function  together with the diversification of mechanism  among the three genes can help us to understand the similarities as well as the differences in the genetic basis of grain yield in rice and maize.
