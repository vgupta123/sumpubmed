BACKGROUND
revealing the subcellular localization of unknown proteins is of major importance for inferring protein function. major progress has been made in the past few years in experimental proteomics technology. as a result, many novel organellar proteins have been identified and their physiological functions have been defined at the molecular level. despite this success, these experimental methods are limited in protein identification capabilities by several parameters, for instance, by technological sensitivity and organelle purity, and to major plant tissues and organs. this holds true particularly for small and fragile organelles such as peroxisomes that can only be isolated in sufficient purity and quantity from a few plant species, generally only from one tissue type per organism  and only from organisms raised under optimal growth conditions. as a result, most low-abundance proteins of peroxisomes have remained unidentified to date. complementary to experimental proteome research, protein targeting prediction from genome sequences has emerged as a central and essential tool in the post-genomic era to define organellar proteomes and to understand metabolic and regulatory networks  <cit> .

peroxisomes are small, ubiquitous eukaryotic organelles that mediate a wide range of oxidative metabolic activities. classical physiological functions of plant peroxisomes are lipid metabolism, photorespiration, and hormone biosynthesis . additionally, many novel plant peroxisome functions, for instance in secondary metabolism, have been uncovered in the past few years . agronomically most important, plant peroxisomes also play pivotal roles in responses to and tolerance of abiotic and biotic stresses  <cit> .

soluble matrix proteins of peroxisomes are imported directly from the cytosol  <cit> . apart from a few exceptions, proteins are targeted to the peroxisome matrix by a conserved peroxisome targeting signal of either type  <dig>  or type  <dig> . the motifs of both targeting peptides have been applied to predict and identify matrix proteins from genome sequences  <cit> . computational prediction methods have been developed for pts1/ <dig> proteins in animals and fungi, but have long been missing specifically for plants. such plant-specific tools are needed because plant peroxisomal proteins with non-canonical pts <dig> tripeptides can, in general, not be predicted correctly by algorithms developed for metazoa  <cit> . non-canonical pts <dig> tripeptides  are generally restricted to a few, preferentially low-abundance , peroxisomal proteins. these tripeptides alone generally represent weak signals that require auxiliary targeting-enhancing patterns  for functionality, which are located immediately upstream of the tripeptide and are often kingdom specific.

to increase the number of known plant pts <dig> proteins, we developed proteomic methods for arabidopsis leaf peroxisomes and identified more than  <dig> putative novel peroxisomal proteins, including many long-awaited low-abundance and regulatory proteins  <cit> . by in vivo targeting analysis and pts identification, many novel arabidopsis pts <dig> proteins have been established in the past few years . these experimental data provided a solid foundation for the development of pts <dig> protein prediction methods.

using  <dig> known arabidopsis pts <dig> proteins as queries for homology searches, we generated a large dataset of more than  <dig>  homologous sequences that derived from approx.  <dig> different plant species and primarily from est databases. upon application of a discriminative machine learning approach, two different prediction methods were derived, both of which showed high prediction accuracy for diverse plant species and recognized specific targeting-enhancing patterns in the regions upstream of the pts <dig> tripeptides  <cit> . both prediction methods showed high accuracy on example sequences of diverse plant species and were able to correctly infer novel pts <dig> tripeptides, even including novel residues. in combination with large-scale in vivo subcellular targeting analyses, the prediction methods were proven to be suitable for the prediction of plant peroxisomal pts <dig> proteins from genomic sequences, as demonstrated representatively for arabidopsis, including low-abundance and non-canonical pts <dig> proteins  <cit> .

nevertheless, one major challenge remains, namely to correctly predict plant proteins carrying non-canonical pts <dig> tripeptides. first, many non-canonical pts <dig> tripeptides have remained unidentified to date. second, among a large number of plant proteins carrying one and the same non-canonical pts <dig> tripeptide, only a small subset is indeed peroxisome-targeted. the reason is that non-canonical pts <dig> tripeptides alone are generally weak, and require auxiliary targeting-enhancing patterns  located immediately upstream of the tripeptide, to target proteins to peroxisomes. knowledge about the identity and positioning of these enhancer patterns is lacking, making correct peroxisome targeting predictions challenging. by contrast, canonical pts <dig> tripeptides are stand-alone targeting signals that generally do not require enhancer elements. the predominance of canonical pts <dig> tripeptides such as skl >  among positive example sequences  <cit>  makes the recognition of specific discriminative features in the relatively low number of known non-canonical pts <dig> proteins difficult.

in this study, we validated the algorithms in greater depth by focusing on the most challenging predictions, namely arabidopsis proteins  with pts <dig> protein prediction scores close to the prediction threshold,  containing non-canonical, yet unknown pts <dig> tripeptides, and  carrying putatively novel residues in the pts <dig> tripeptide. by in vivo subcellular targeting analysis, three novel plant pts <dig> tripeptides and two novel tripeptide residues were identified, further extending the relaxation degree of the plant pts <dig> motif at single positions. our newly established single-residue computational permutation analysis of specific non-canonical arabidopsis proteins of interest identifies particular amino acid residues in the upstream domain that are predicted to strongly enhance peroxisome targeting.

RESULTS
selection of predicted arabidopsis pts <dig> proteins for experimental validation
to validate the algorithms in greater depth, we selected further arabidopsis proteins of interest that followed specific criteria. first, we chose proteins that had been assigned pts <dig> protein prediction scores close to the threshold. the pts <dig> protein prediction scores of the five arabidopsis proteins spanned the range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  with the threshold for peroxisome targeting located at  <dig>  . second, we selected arabidopsis proteins containing yet unknown non-canonical pts <dig> tripeptides . third, we focused on proteins that preferentially carried putative novel pts <dig> tripeptide residues, i.e. either at position − <dig>  or at position − <dig> . none of these potentially novel pts <dig> tripeptide residues had been described previously as an allowed residue in plant pts1s . fourth, we prioritized arabidopsis proteins  whose localization in the peroxisome matrix had long been postulated but not yet been demonstrated. except for the protein terminating with sdl>, all arabidopsis proteins were predicted as peroxisome-targeted by the pwm prediction model, while the scores given by the alternative and more stringent ri model were generally below threshold  <cit> .

the three alternative gene models for the dnaj heat-shock protein  differ in the c-terminal domain  and are not predicted as peroxisome-targeted by the pts <dig> pathway . potentially novel pts <dig> tripeptide residues are underlined. ‚ <dig> 315– <dig>   <dig> 473– <dig>   <dig> 321/ <dig> 

arabidopsis proteins with novel residues at pts <dig> tripeptide position −3
we first studied arabidopsis proteins with potentially novel pts <dig> tripeptide residues at pos. - <dig>  three putatively novel non-canonical pts <dig> tripeptides, namely hkl>, qrl>, and rkm>, were chosen. neither his , gln , nor arg  had been previously validated as functional pts <dig> tripeptide residues at pos. - <dig>  among  <dig> arabidopsis gene models  terminating with hkl>, nine were predicted peroxisomal by the pwm prediction model . the arabidopsis hkl > decapeptide chosen for experimental validation derived from sumo-activating enzyme 1b . the pwm model prediction score of  <dig>  was slightly above the prediction threshold , as indicated by a posterior probability of  <dig>  .

to experimentally investigate whether the arabidopsis protein indeed contained a functional pts <dig> domain, we extended the reporter protein enhanced yellow fluorescent protein  c-terminally by the predicted pts <dig> domain comprising the c-terminal ten amino acid  residues of the arabidopsis proteins. this method had been successfully established previously  <cit> . compared to full-length protein fusions, this approach has the advantage that possible negative effects of polypeptide conformation are reduced to a minimum. the construct was transiently expressed from the 35 s cauliflower mosaic virus  promoter in onion epidermal cells. plant tissue transformed with a negative control plasmid, such as eyfp alone , showed uniformly cytosolic and nuclear fluorescence. the reporter construct eyfp-7aa-hkl > was cytosolic/nuclear under standard conditions of gene expression . we had previously observed that extended incubation times at reduced temperature increased the sensitivity in detecting peroxisome targeting for several  reporter protein constructs  <cit> . when this methodology was applied to eyfp-7aa-hkl>, the construct remained undetectable in punctuate subcellular structures .

among five arabidopsis gene models  terminating with rkm>, two were predicted peroxisomal by the pwm prediction model . the arabidopsis rkm > decapeptide chosen for experimental validation derived from heat-shock protein 70 t- <dig> , which had been assigned the pwm prediction score of  <dig>  . in experimental subcellular targeting studies the reporter construct eyfp-7aa-rkm > was cytosolic/nuclear under both standard and extended conditions of gene expression .

among ten arabidopsis gene models  terminating with qrl>, two were predicted peroxisomal by the pwm prediction model . the arabidopsis qrl > decapeptide chosen for experimental validation derived from a dnaj homolog . among in total four transcriptional variants, variant  <dig>  specifically terminated with qrl >  and was assigned the prediction score  <dig> , while the other three variants were among those  <dig>   arabidopsis gene models with the lowest scores . the reporter protein eyfp-7aa-qrl > targeted small punctuate structures with low cytosolic background fluorescence under standard conditions of gene expression , indicating a relatively high peroxisome targeting strength of the decapeptide. the identity of the punctuate structures with peroxisomes was confirmed in double transformants co-expressing the peroxisome marker dsred-skl . the results demonstrated that  qrl > is a novel functional pts <dig> tripeptide,  q is a novel pts <dig> tripeptide residue at pos. - <dig> , and that  the second splice variant of the dnaj homolog at1g <dig> carries a functional pts <dig> domain.

arabidopsis proteins with novel residues at position − <dig> of the pts <dig> tripeptide
we next investigated constructs with potentially new residues at pos. - <dig>  which had long been assigned a requirement for basic residues. we had previously verified by experimental analyses that a total of  <dig> aa residues are allowed at pos. - <dig> in plant pts <dig> proteins. apart from basic residues  the compatible residues included neutral residues  and even the acidic residue, glutamate . two putatively novel non-canonical pts <dig> tripeptides, namely sqm > and sdl>, were chosen. among four arabidopsis gene models  terminating with sqm>, one was predicted peroxisomal by the pwm prediction model . the arabidopsis sqm > decapeptide chosen for experimental validation derived from root hair defective  <dig>  homolog  <dig> . the pwm model prediction score of  <dig>  was close to the prediction threshold , consistent with a posterior probability of  <dig> . the reporter protein construct extended by the predicted pts <dig> domains terminating with sqm > remained cytosolic under standard conditions of gene expression . however, after slightly extended times of expression , small yellow fluorescent punctuate structures became visible that moved quickly along cytoplasmic strands, indicating that the reporter construct targeted peroxisomes with weak efficiency . extended expression times up to seven days at ca. 10°c improved visualization of peroxisome targeting in a few, but not all cells . the identity of the fluorescent organelles with peroxisomes was confirmed in double transformants co-expressing dsred-skl . the data validated sqm > as a novel plant pts <dig> tripeptide.

among  <dig> arabidopsis gene models  terminating with sdl>, none were predicted peroxisomal by the pwm prediction model . the arabidopsis sdl > decapeptide chosen for experimental validation was derived from constitutive triple response  <dig> . the pwm model prediction score of  <dig>  was below the prediction threshold  and had been assigned a low posterior probability of  <dig> . ctr1/sis had been assigned the third highest pwm prediction score among the twelve arabidopsis gene models terminating with sdl >  <cit> .

the reporter construct eyfp-7aa-sdl > with the atypical acidic residue asp at pos. - <dig> remained cytosolic under short-term conditions of gene expression but could be detected in small punctuate structures after long-term expressions . the punctuate structures were shown to coincide with peroxisomes , thereby validating sdl > as a novel plant pts <dig> tripeptide and asp as a novel plant pts <dig> tripeptide residue at pos. - <dig> .

in summary, the experimental analyses demonstrated that  three tripeptides are novel functional plant pts <dig> tripeptides ,  q and d are novel pts <dig> tripeptide residues at pos. - <dig> and pos. - <dig>  respectively, and  three arabidopsis proteins previously not known to be peroxisome-targeted carry functional pts <dig> domains. by contrast, two further predicted pts <dig> domains terminating with hkl > and rkm > could not be validated for the arabidopsis proteins chosen, confirming that the prediction accuracy close to the threshold needs to be further improved by future experimental and computational follow-up studies.

computational single-residue permutation analysis of aa residues located upstream of non-canonical pts <dig> tripeptides
pts <dig> protein prediction by our pwm models is based on a score matrix in which each of the  <dig> aa residues at each of the c-terminal 14-aa positions is given a specific prediction score . such a position-specific score indicates whether a particular residue at a particular sequence position is predicted to enhance  or reduce peroxisome targeting . the score matrix shows that, apart from the major role of the c-terminal tripeptide, several upstream residues differ significantly in position-specific abundance between plant pts <dig> proteins and non-peroxisomal proteins . these overrepresented residues are predicted to enhance protein targeting to peroxisomes by the pts <dig> pathway, particularly in case of non-canonical pts <dig> tripeptides  <cit>  . the total prediction score represents the sum of the  <dig> position-specific pwm scores for the analyzed sequence of interest.

to better understand why only some arabidopsis proteins, among numerous arabidopsis proteins carrying the same c-terminal tripeptides , were specifically predicted to carry pts <dig> domains, we established a new single-residue computational permutation analysis of specific non-canonical arabidopsis proteins of interest. from the pwm score matrix so-called discriminative features can be derived, which correspond to particular residues at particular positions in a sequence that are associated with a high influence on peroxisome targeting prediction . the model thus also allows generating sequences with high targeting probability de novo by combining position-specific residues with large positive weights. however, for a particular sequence of interest, e.g. a protein with a non-canonical pts <dig> tripeptide, the identification of single residues that possibly enhance or reduce peroxisome targeting using the list of discriminative features is cumbersome. therefore, we computationally permuted the eleven residues  upstream of the pts <dig> tripeptides in all possible  <dig> combinations  in the three arabidopsis sequences validated as peroxisomal and investigated the effect on the total pwm prediction scores .

first, we analyzed the range of pwm prediction score alterations caused by single aa residue point mutations in a position-specific manner and compared this to the pwm prediction score of the original arabidopsis sequence. the overall position-specific pattern of different pwm score range windows was similar between pts <dig> protein sequences, i.e. the magnitude of the window differs per aa position but is constant and sequence-independent at a specific position . the reason is that the total pwm prediction scores are calculated by summing up the previously learned position-specific scores for particular residues. for instance, while the three sequences have a relatively small pwm permutation score range window of  <dig>  at pos. - <dig> and − <dig>  the largest window of  <dig>  is present at the neighboring pos. - <dig>  where k, s, and p occur in the qrl>, sqm > and sdl > sequence, respectively . a large window of score distributions indicates that different aa residues have a significant effect on predicted peroxisome targeting. hence, the algorithms predict that the aa residue at pos. - <dig> enhances peroxisome targeting to a higher extent than the neighboring residue .

however, these position-specific pwm score windows differ in absolute minimum and maximum values  for each sequence. for instance, the pwm score range window of pos. - <dig> of  <dig>  in magnitude is located at high values for the qrl >  and sqm > sequence  but at low values for the sdl >  and mostly below the actual prediction value  of the non-permuted original sdl > sequence from arabidopsis. the absolute magnitude of the pwm score range window on the y axis and its positioning relative to the pwm prediction score of the original arabidopsis qrl > sequence  indicates the absolute optimization potential of a position-specific residue .

to better reveal which upstream positions are predicted to contribute most to peroxisome targeting, we calculated the total pwm score differences of all possible aa point permutations to the original sequence as an indicator of the total optimization potential. in this analysis large negative values indicate that most aa exchanges reduce predicted peroxisome targeting. hence, these positions have been optimized close to maximum extent by the aa present in the original sequence. by contrast, positive values indicate an “unused” optimization potential, i.e. that several aa exchanges at the given position increase the pwm score for peroxisome targeting. for the qrl > sequence, for instance, k , s , and v  are predicted important residues that enhance peroxisome targeting, while the neighboring residues at uneven positions such as g , m , and r  are predicted sub-optimal residues that do not enhance peroxisome targeting.

to quantify which upstream positions had been most optimized in terms of predicted targeting enhancing elements in the three arabidopsis proteins of interest, we expressed the pwm prediction score s of a mutated residue r at position sr,x relative to the difference between minimum and maximum score in percentage . for the qrl > sequence, for instance, this analysis shows that four residues are close to prediction score maximum , indicating that these four residues contribute significantly to peroxisome targeting by the weak non-canonical pts <dig> tripeptide qrl>. by contrast, r , even though also a basic residue and principally implicated in serving as a targeting enhancing element, is not predicted to be important for peroxisome targeting of the qrl > sequence.

likewise, for the sqm > sequence, five residues are predicted to contribute most to peroxisome targeting, primarily s , e , and q  followed by n , and t . for the sdl > sequence, predominantly four residues are predicted to enhance peroxisome targeting, with two optimal residues , followed by a  and s . interestingly, the two proline residues at pos. - <dig> and − <dig> are predicted to enhance peroxisome targeting to a considerably lower extent as compared to the neighboring p .

in summary, these permutation analyses of specific single arabidopsis proteins of interest carrying functional non-canonical pts <dig> domains demonstrate that  four to five residues positioned between pos. - <dig> to − <dig> appear to have been optimized to enable peroxisome targeting,  their exact positioning appears flexible, and  not only basic residues and proline, but also hydroxylated , hydrophobic , and even acidic residues are predicted to be able to enhance peroxisome targeting. taken together, the experimental and computational data demonstrate that the plant pts <dig> motif is more relaxed and that targeting enhancing elements are more diverse and complex than previously assumed. the models allow identification of predicted targeting enhancing and inhibitory elements for specific sequences of interest and their optimization by site-directed mutagenesis.

discussion
state-of-the-art prediction algorithms need to address the prediction of non-canonical weak pts1s. the accuracy of prediction tools is determined by two parameters, high sensitivity and high specificity. the prediction sensitivity in detecting plant pts <dig> proteins depends mainly on the ability to identify all functional pts <dig> tripeptides of spermatophyta and, hence, to predict novel “unseen” pts <dig> tripeptides that have been absent from training datasets of positive example sequences. most previously developed prediction tools for fungi and animals were not designed to infer novel pts <dig> tripeptides or predict low-abundance proteins because they employed tripeptide-based selection filters  <cit> . by contrast, our newly developed prediction tools for plants could infer novel pts <dig> tripeptides, many of which were validated as correct predictions by experimental in vivo analyses  <cit> . by demonstrating in this study that three additional tripeptides are novel non-canonical pts <dig> tripeptides, we show that novel tripeptides, even if positioned close to the prediction threshold, are correctly predicted as containing non-canonical pts <dig> tripeptides. thereby, this study increases the number of known plant pts1s from  <dig> to  <dig>  with this knowledge more low-abundance plant peroxisomal pts <dig> proteins carrying non-canonical pts <dig> tripeptides such as qrl>, sqm>, or sdl > can now be identified.

on top of the  <dig> plant pts <dig> tripeptide residues experimentally validated previously  <cit> , the pwm model predicted that ten additional residues might be allowed in plant pts <dig> tripeptides . one of these residues was validated in the present study, namely q . moreover, d  was validated as an allowed pts <dig> tripeptide residue, even though the corresponding arabidopsis sequence was scored slightly below prediction threshold . due to the underrepresentation of sequences with non-canonical pts <dig> tripeptides in the underlying dataset of positive example sequences, the correct prediction of non-canonical sequences remains challenging, leading to the present inaccuracy that a few false positive  sequences will be located above prediction threshold  and a few true positive  sequences are located below threshold in a prediction grey-zone roughly down to pts <dig> protein score position  <dig>  <cit> .

the new experimentally verified pts <dig> tripeptides add another two residues, gln  and asp  to yield in total  <dig> experimentally validated position-specific residues for the previously reported plant pts <dig> motif , leading to twelve ,  <dig> , and six  allowed aa residues in plant pts <dig> tripeptides . hence, the tolerated plant pts <dig> motif variation is much higher than previously thought. the former “basic” pos. - <dig>  which was previously considered to be the most conservative aa residue, emerges as the most flexible, with  <dig> possible residues allowed out of  <dig> , even including both acidic residues, glu and asp . notably, only specific combinations of the residues of the plant pts <dig> tripeptide motif yield functional plant pts <dig> tripeptides. all experimentally verified plant pts <dig> tripeptides identified to date follow the pattern that at least two high-abundance residues of presumably strong targeting strength  need to be combined with one low-abundance pts <dig> residue to yield functional plant pts <dig> tripeptides .

in the present study three arabidopsis proteins that had previously not been associated with peroxisomes were shown to carry functional pts <dig> domains. the qrl > decapeptide validated as a functional pts <dig> domain derived from the second alternative splice variant of a dnaj homolog . no dnaj homolog has been previously shown to be targeted to arabidopsis peroxisomes. an hsp <dig> and a dnaj homolog are reported to be associated with the glyoxysomal membrane in cucumber, and the latter was shown to specifically interact with a cytosolic hsp <dig>  <cit> . a watermelon hsp <dig> was shown to be dually targeted to both chloroplasts and peroxisomes regulated by alternative translation  <cit> . the fact that the other three variants of the dnaj homolog do not carry potential pts <dig> domains indicates that the protein is dually targeted to both the cytosol and peroxisomes regulated by alternative splicing. more detailed studies need to address under which conditions this second splice variant is expressed and the full-length protein is targeted to peroxisomes. to date, only a few plant proteins are reported to be dually targeted to peroxisomes and a second cell compartment by alternative splicing. the most prominent example is arabidopsis transthyretin-like protein, a bifunctional enzyme involved in purine catabolism  <cit> .

the functional pts <dig> domain terminating with the newly identified pts <dig>  sqm>, belongs to rdh3h <dig> , a gtp-binding protein and paralog of rdh <dig> . loss-of-function mutants of rdh <dig> are suppressed in epidermal cell file rotation, root skewing, and waving on hard-agar surfaces. rhd <dig> is involved in the control of vesicle trafficking between the er and the golgi compartments  <cit> . future research needs to address whether the full-length rhdh <dig> protein is indeed located in peroxisomes.

the functional pts <dig> domain terminating with sdl > belongs to the cytosolic ser/thr protein kinase constitutive triple response  <dig> , which is an important negative regulator of the ethylene signal transduction pathway regulating plant growth and development  <cit> . dark-grown seedlings of “triple response” mutants show an altered response to ethylene. the kinase activity of ctr <dig> is reported to be regulated by multiple reversible phosphorylation events, leading to significant conformational rearrangements  <cit> . this mode of post-translational regulation offers the possibility that differential surface exposure of the c-terminal pts <dig> domain might cause peroxisome targeting, for instance to transiently eliminate ctr <dig> from the cytosol.

on the other hand, two predicted non-canonical pts <dig> tripeptides could not be validated as functional pts <dig> tripeptides for the chosen arabidopsis sequences, namely those terminating with hkl > and rkm>. the reasons might be several-fold, starting from insufficient sensitivity in detecting weak peroxisome targeting, omission of targeting enhancing elements located upstream of the c-terminal decapeptide in the native protein, to incorrect predictions.

when the full-length cdna of hsp70t- <dig>  was cloned to the c-terminal end of the reporter protein, the reporter fusion remained cytosolic as well . alternative expression systems including stable arabidopsis lines might be needed to conclusively investigate whether the two predicted proteins are cytosolic in vivo. as a note of caution, pwm predictions of plant proteins with novel non-canonical tripeptides that have not yet been confirmed as functional tripeptides for other sequences should be considered with greater caution compared to predictions of other arabidopsis proteins carrying confirmed pts <dig> tripeptides. notably, r  was one of the few residues that could also not be confirmed for one positive example sequence  <cit> . it is important to mention that the pwm prediction algorithms do not consider the similarity of biophysical properties of a residues and deduce predictions solely based on discriminative position-specific aa abundance. due to the high abundance of skl > sequences in the underlying dataset and the close codon similarity between ser  and arg , the two rkl > positive example sequences could have been created by sequencing errors in ests and caused the false prediction of rkl > and rkm > sequences as peroxisomal.

our pwm algorithm combines the c-terminal pts <dig> tripeptide and the upstream region  into a single prediction model. peroxisome targeting by weak non-canonical pts1s essentially depends on the presence of targeting enhancing elements in the upstream region. these elements, however, had only been vaguely defined until now. it has been reported for a few sequences that basic residues enhance peroxisome targeting, primarily if located at pos. - <dig>  <cit> . except for the sdl > sequence, none of the other two sequences carried a basic residue directly in front of the non-canonical pts <dig>  and the sqm > sequence even contained two acidic residues, which are generally very rare in pts <dig> domains  <cit> . it is therefore of interest to identify specific aa residues in a given upstream pts <dig> domain that enhance and are essential for peroxisome targeting. to this end, we established in this study a so-called position-specific permutation analysis for non-canonical pts <dig> sequences. for each of the newly identified arabidopsis pts <dig> domains carrying novel non-canonical pts <dig> tripeptides, we calculated to what extent single aa exchanges in the upstream domain affected the prediction score for peroxisome targeting. in all three sequences, four to five aa residues were identified in the arabidopsis proteins that represented close-to-optimal residues in term of peroxisome targeting prediction. these data strongly suggest that these residues function as targeting enhancer elements for peroxisome targeting. the exact positioning of these predicted enhancer elements appears relatively flexible between pos. - <dig> to − <dig>  most interestingly, not only basic residues and proline, but also hydroxylated , hydrophobic , and even acidic residues are predicted to be able to enhance peroxisome targeting. these predictions are challenging to validate experimentally due to the moderate  to low  peroxisome targeting efficiency of the original arabidopsis decapeptides, making it difficult to investigate further reductions semi-quantitatively. future studies shall address whether such experimental analyses are feasible, for instance, in case of the qrl > sequence.

CONCLUSIONS
our computational and experimental analyses demonstrate that the plant pts <dig> tripeptide motif is more diverse than previously thought and includes many non-canonical sequences. specific targeting enhancing elements can be predicted for particular sequences of interest and are far more diverse in aa identity and positioning than previously assumed. machine learning methods become indispensable to predict which proteins, among proteins carrying the same pts <dig> tripeptide, contain sufficient enhancer elements for peroxisome targeting.
