BACKGROUND
maize  is a staple crop that plays an important role in satisfying food and feed demands worldwide. improvement in grain yield is a main objective for maize breeders  <cit> . the grain yield per unit area can be analyzed by the plant number, ear number per plant, and ear weight. the ear weight can be analyzed by the kernel number per row, kernel row number , and kernel weight. these traits are quantitatively inherited and influenced by genotypes, environments, and environment-by-genotype interactions. the krn significantly contributes to grain yield and has the highest broad-sense heritability  among the three components  <cit> . therefore, the investigation into the genetic architecture underlying krn is helpful not only for understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying ear development but also for improving the maize grain yield.

the krn is a quantitative trait that is controlled by multiple quantitative trait loci  . based on diverse bi-parental genetic populations in maize, qtl mapping has been employed to investigate the genetic architecture underlying the krn . in  <dig>  five qtl for the krn were detected in both environments using a f2: <dig> population derived from inbred lines nong <dig> and k10hex <dig> with four rows  <cit> . using  <dig> recombinant inbred lines  derived from a cross between b <dig> and sicau <dig>  a total of  <dig> qtl for the krn were detected across four environments; three of them  were consistently identified across four environments  <cit> . based on 397 f2: <dig> families derived from the inbreds ye <dig> and dan <dig>  a qtl for the krn that explains  <dig>  % of the phenotypic variance was detected on chromosome  <dig> across seven diverse environments  <cit> . using a set of recombinant chromosomes near isogenic lines derived from the inbred line w <dig> and teosinte , a major qtl explaining ~51 % of phenotypic variance was fine mapped into an interval of 203 kb  <cit> . combined with map-based cloning, qtl mapping has been proven to be a powerful approach to exploring the genes or genetic elements that are responsible for the krn  <cit> . in  <dig>  one qtl for the krn that explains ~ <dig>  % of phenotypic variance was identified on chromosome  <dig> using the intermated b73 × mo <dig> population. the underlying gene fasciated ear <dig> was subsequently cloned, which encodes a clavata receptor-like protein that causes increased inflorescence meristem and the krn  <cit> . in  <dig>  a major qtl for the krn krn <dig> was fine mapped on chromosome 4; the cloning of this qtl revealed that a  <dig> -kb transposon-containing insertion was responsible for increasing the krn by regulating the expression level of the sbp-box gene unbranched <dig>  <cit> .

although the qtl for the krn have been successfully identified via qtl mapping, the low densities of the genetic markers and the complexity of the maize genome caused significant challenges to fine mapping and the exploration of casual genes or elements  <cit> . the resolution of qtl mapping can be improved using high-density genetic markers due to an increased number of detected recombination events  <cit> . advances in next-generation sequencing technologies has caused a rapid decline in the affordable cost of genotyping-by-sequencing , which is a popular genotyping method that can produce high-density genome-wide markers without prior knowledge  <cit> . qtl mapping based on gbs has significantly improved the resolution of the qtl detected for different types of quantitative traits  <cit> . for example, using a genetic map including  <dig>  bin markers from low-coverage gbs, qtbn <dig> and qtbn <dig> for the tassel branch number were detected within small physical intervals of ~800 kb and  <dig>  mb, respectively  <cit> . based on a high-density genetic map including  <dig>  bin markers, qla2a and qlov <dig> were mapped into small intervals of ~ <dig>  mb and ~ <dig>  mb, respectively  <cit> . using a high-density genetic map containing  <dig>  bin markers, pqtl <dig> for plant height, ear height, and internode number was detected within an interval of  <dig>  mb  <cit> . these studies have shown that qtl mapping using a high-density genetic map can accelerate the progress of dissecting the genetic basis of quantitative traits.

in addition to qtl mapping, bulked segregant analysis  is another strategy that has been employed to rapidly identify genetic determinants underlying phenotypic variation  <cit> . based on two groups that show opposing phenotypes of interest traits, the distribution patterns of genome-wide alleles are examined by molecular markers, such as single nucleotide polymorphism   <cit> . a non-random distribution of alleles between two groups likely indicates that this locus is linked with the trait of interest. for example, the co-dominant amplified fragment length polymorphism marker p7m <dig> was linked to the rhm gene for resistance to southern corn leaf blight by using bsa  <cit> . recently, the efficiency and power of bsa has been improved by significant advances in next-generation sequencing technologies . for example, the use of bsa with next-generation sequencing technology, a novel resistance gene pi <dig> conferring a broad-spectrum resistance to the fungus magnaporthe oryzae was fine mapped within an interval of 1 mb  <cit> . using bsa combined with the specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing  strategy, a single dominant gene phr <dig> conferring resistance to the isolate byl <dig>  was fine mapped into an interval of  <dig>  mb  <cit> . bsa has also been combined with rna sequencing to rapidly and precisely detect genetic determinants underlying traits of interest  <cit> .

in this study, an f <dig> population was constructed from a cross between inbred line b <dig> with an average krn of  <dig> and inbred line abe <dig> with an average krn of four. using this population, qtl mapping for the krn was performed based on the high-density genetic map that was constructed via slaf-seq. in addition, bulked segregant rna sequencing  was employed to detect the qtl for the krn  <cit> . our results indicated that combining qtl mapping using a high-density genetic map and bsr-seq was a powerful approach to rapidly fine mapping qtl for traits of interest in maize.

methods
plant materials
a large f <dig> population was constructed from a cross between inbred lines b <dig> and abe <dig>  b <dig> is a non-waxy and yellow endosperm maize with a krn of 16 ±  <dig>  abe <dig> is a waxy and white endosperm maize with a stable krn of four. from the large f <dig> population, 300 f <dig> plants were randomly selected and subjected to gbs using the slaf-seq strategy  <cit> , which were also employed to investigate the krn in yunnan province in china . a ril population consisting of  <dig> lines were subsequently constructed from these 300 f <dig> plants using a single seed descend method . the krn of the rils was investigated using a randomized block design with two repeats in the winter of  <dig> in hainan province in china . based on analysis of variance , the h
 <dig> for the krn was calculated as the formula: h
2 = σ

2/, where σ
g
 <dig> and σ
e
 <dig> represent the estimated variances for the genetic effects and the random error, respectively  <cit> .

dna extraction and genotyping
the genomic dna of the 300 f <dig> plants and two parents were extracted following the protocol of the plant genomic dna kit . the genomic dna of the ril population was extracted from the upper leaves of each ril using a ctab procedure  <cit> . the quality and quantity of the dna were verified using  <dig>  % agarose gels and spectrophotometry .

the 300 f <dig> plants and two parents were genotyped using the slaf-seq method  <cit> . based on the slaf pre-design experiment using b <dig> refgen_v <dig> , the genomic dna was digested using the restriction enzyme haeiii. the slaf library was constructed in accordance with the protocol established by biomarker technologies co. ltd in beijing, china. then, selected slafs were sequenced using the illumina hiseq  <dig> pair-end sequencing platform .

the ril population was genotyped using ssr markers, which were downloaded from maizegdb . vt <dig> is an insertion/deletion  marker developed on an indel between the b <dig> and abe <dig> sequences of the gene vanishing tassel <dig>  <cit> . the primer sequences of ssr and vt <dig> were synthesized by beijing augct bio-technology co. ltd. pcr amplicons were separated using 8 % polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by silver-staining.

construction of genetic map and qtl mapping
slaf pair-end reads with clear index information were grouped into one slaf locus if the sequence similarity exceeded 90 % as detected using the software blat  <cit>  . for each slaf locus, alleles were defined according to the minor allele frequency  evaluation because true alleles had significantly higher maf values than reads containing sequence errors. clusters with more than four tags or with sequence depth less than  <dig> were filtered out. slafs with two to four tags were considered to be potential polymorphic slafs. slafs were verified by the alleles origins based on the deep-sequencing of the two parents. polymorphic slafs with a parental genotype of aa × bb and offspring genotypes of ab or miss were used to construct a high-density genetic map . all slaf markers were grouped with a linkage lod threshold of  <dig> , and the positions and order of grouped markers were arranged using the est.map function in the r/qtl package  <cit> . combining the krns of f <dig> plants, the qtl were identified using the composite interval mapping method implemented in the r/qtl package. the lod threshold for a significant qtl was determined by  <dig> permutations and a p value of  <dig>  using the mqmpermutation function implemented in r/qtl.

for the ril population, the genetic map was constructed using the software qtl icimapping version  <dig>  . markers were grouped by a linkage lod threshold of  <dig>  and ordered using the nntwoopt algorithm. the ordered markers were rippled by the criteria of the sum of adjacent recombination frequencies. then, the qtl for the krn were identified using the inclusive composite interval mapping method implemented in the software qtl icimapping version  <dig>   <cit> .

bulked segregant rna sequencing
the rna of  <dig> plants with extremely low krns and  <dig> plants with extremely high krns , which were selected from the large f <dig> population, were extracted from the 30-day leaves of these plants following the protocol of the trizol reagent established by invitrogen life technologies co. ltd. the quality and quantity of rna were verified using  <dig>  % agarose gels and spectrophotometry . two rna bulks were constructed by pooling the rna of plants with low or high krns with equal quantity and sequenced by data2bio co. ltd in beijing using the illumina hiseq  <dig> pair-end sequencing platform . raw reads were trimmed using a base phred quality value threshold of  <dig>  the remaining nucleotides were then scanned using overlapping windows of 10 bp, and sequences beyond the last window with an average quality value less than the specified threshold were truncated  <cit> .

clean reads were aligned to b <dig> refgen_v <dig>  using the software gsnap  <cit> . the uniquely mapped reads with less than two mismatches every 36 bp and five bases for every 75 bp as tails were used for subsequent analysis. polymorphisms were carefully examined and putative heterozygous snps were identified based on the pooled rna-seq data of the two samples in comparison using the following criteria:  the first and last three aligned bases of each read were discarded;  each polymorphic base must have a minimum phred quality value of 15;  the base-pair call must be supported by at least three unique reads;  at least 30 % of all aligned reads covering that position support the two most common alleles, and the sum of reads of the two most common alleles account for at least 80 % of all aligned reads covering that nucleotide position. in order to reduce noise, snps were retained only if they had at least three reads per allele in the high krn pool and at least five reads in the low krn pool. polymorphic snps were used to map the qtl for the krn using a bayesian approach  <cit> . the posterior probabilities were normalized by dividing the maximum linkage observed in a high confidence snp  <cit> .

discussion
the power of qtl mapping was increased using a high-density genetic map based on slaf-seq
qtl mapping is an efficient strategy for exploring the genetic architecture underlying quantitative traits in maize  <cit> . however, the accuracy and resolution of qtl mapping is significantly affected by the quality and resolution of the genetic map  <cit> . slaf-seq is an affordable, rapid, and reliable method for de novo snp and indel discovery for large and complex genomes, which combines locus-specific amplification and high-throughput sequencing  <cit> . it produces thousands of polymorphic markers to generate a high resolution and accurate genetic map. compared with genotyping using traditional pcr-based markers, slaf-seq is rapid, cost-effective and does not require prior knowledge of polymorphic information .

in genotyping using slaf-seq, the quality of slafs plays a key role in the accuracy of de novo snp or indel discovery. in this study, the slaf-efficient selection scheme was developed using b <dig> refgen_v <dig> to improve the efficiency of reduced representation library sequencing  <cit> . the restricted enzyme haeiii was used to digest the genome, and a total of  <dig>  slafs were predicted. the percentage of slafs within repetitive regions was controlled below  <dig>  % to simplify the complexity of genomes for facilitating downstream analyses. the copy number variation among fragments is another important factor that affects the quality of slafs. to ensure copy number uniformity, a tighter fragment length range  was selected to maintain amplification efficiency uniformity during the pcr process. the pcr reaction components and program were also improved to ensure copy number uniformity among fragments. as a result, the average sequence depth of slaf in b <dig>  was close to the average sequence depth of slaf in abe <dig> , and the average sequence depth of slaf in each f <dig> individual was close to  <dig> -fold. the high-density genetic map was constructed using  <dig>  high-quality polymorphic slafs with an average distance between adjacent markers of  <dig>  cm. the spearman correlation between the marker genetic position and the marker physical position for each chromosome exceeded  <dig>  and were significant at p <  <dig> . this correlation indicated the high quality of the genetic map. based on the high-density genetic map, a total of four qtl for the krn were detected. the physical interval ranged from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb with an average value of  <dig>  mb, which were significantly smaller than the physical interval of the qtl identified using traditional pcr-based markers  <cit> . this result implied the increased power of qtl mapping using a high-density genetic map based on slaf-seq.

comprehensive genetic architecture revealed by combining qtl mapping and bsr-seq
combining the high-density genetic map and krns of 300 f <dig> individuals, a total of four qtl  were identified on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. based on reads generated from two rna pools of plants with extremely opposite krns, two significant peaks were observed in the intervals 10–25 mb  and 60–150 mb  on chromosome  <dig>  and three additional putative qtl  were detected . these results comprehensively revealed the genetic architecture underlying krn.

in this study, the f <dig> population was used to map the qtl for the krn. a comparison of qtl mapping using advanced generation populations, such as rils  <cit> , indicated that mapping in early-generation populations was rapid and cost-effective. although the resolution of the qtl was limited by recombination frequency in each f <dig> individual, this resolution may be improved by increasing the population size or the number of polymorphic markers to capture as many recombination events as possible and take full advantage of the linkage information in the f <dig> population  <cit> . this possibility was proved by our results that the physical intervals of the four qtl ranged from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb with an average value of  <dig>  mb.

the genetic architecture underlying quantitative traits is usually complex  <cit> . the phenotype results from the genetic architecture and the environment. although phenotyping with several replications in different environments can reduce the influence of the environment, qtl mapping for the krn in a single environment is a reasonable approach because the h
 <dig> of the krn was  <dig>  in this study. the estimated h
 <dig> of the krn was also very hig in other studies  <cit> . the high h
 <dig> of the krn indicated that it was not strongly influenced by the environment. in this study, qkrn8- <dig> was included by bsr_qtl <dig> according to the physical position. it was also validated using qtl mapping with the rils. using  <dig> rils derived from a cross between b <dig> and sicau <dig>  four qtl for the krn  were detected across four environments  <cit> . qkrn <dig> was close to qern1- <dig>  and qkrn <dig>  qkrn <dig>  and qkrn8- <dig> overlapped with qern2- <dig>  qern5- <dig>  and qern8- <dig>  respectively, which were consistently identified across three environments  <cit> . qkrn <dig> and qkrn <dig> were also detected by another study. in addition, several studies revealed the qtl for the krn close to qkrn <dig> on the short arm of chromosome  <dig> . these results confirmed the feasible of using qtl mapping for the krn using f <dig> population and provided confidence in the validity of the qtl.

bsr-seq is an inexpensive and efficient method for gene mapping for mutant phenotypes  <cit> . it provides not only the position of a gene underlying a mutant phenotype but also patterns of gene expression  <cit> . in this study, the intervals of two significant qtl for the krn on chromosome  <dig> were 15 mb and 90 mb. the mapping resolution may be affected by the population size, the accuracy of phenotyping, the pooling strategy and other factors. the potential existence of more than one qtl on chromosome  <dig> was likely to have significantly impacted the mapping resolution. in addition, the krn is a quantitative trait  <cit> , and this may result in long intervals of the qtl.

fine mapping of the qtl for the krn
in this study, a total of four qtl  for the krn were identified based on the f <dig> population. according to the b <dig> refgen v <dig> gene model , a subtotal of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> protein coding genes were located within qkrn <dig>  qkrn <dig>  qkrn <dig>  and qkrn8- <dig>  respectively . fine mapping should be conducted to identify casual genes underlying these qtl and facilitate efficient marker-assisted selection. the strategy of the recombinant-derived progeny test was an efficient method for fine mapping  <cit> . it located the qtl by testing associations between molecular markers and phenotypic variance in progenies derived from recombinants  <cit> . in addition, the high-density polymorphic markers provided by slaf-seq and bsr-seq can facilitate fine mapping experiments using additional populations.

according to the lod and effects, qkrn8- <dig> should be priorly investigated because it had the highest lod and was validated by the bsr-seq and the qtl mapping using the ril population. a total of  <dig> protein coding genes were located within qkrn8- <dig>  in which five genes have been annotated. however, the expression patterns of genes within qkrn8- <dig> from the bsr-seq results were not employed to prioritize candidate genes because no biologically replicated rna-seq data existed and the rna for sequencing was not extracted from the ear where the phenotype was evident. the accurate identification of differentially expressed genes in maize ears with biologically replicated data may facilitate the cloning of genes responsible for the krn.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we proved that qtl mapping for traits with high h
 <dig> is feasible in early-generation populations. combining qtl mapping using a high-density genetic map and bsr-seq is a powerful and cost-effective approach for the comprehensive dissection of genetic architecture underlying traits of interest. the qtl for the krn detected in this study, especially qkrn8- <dig>  can be employed for performing fine mapping experiments and marker-assisted selection in maize breeding.
