BACKGROUND
inducible defense responses are activated when plants respond to pathogen attack  <cit> . the gene-for-gene defense response is a strong form of plant resistance against pathogens. this type of resistance is turned on when the plants have a specific resistance  gene that recognizes the product of a corresponding pathogen gene known as the avirulence  gene. this interaction between an r-gene and an avr-gene triggers the hypersensitive response  and rapid expression of defense responses that result in programmed cell death within  <dig> h of infection  <cit> . another type of defense response occurs after attack by virulent pathogens that do not have an avr-gene recognized by the plant. in this case, the plant responds more slowly than in gene-for-gene resistance, allowing the pathogen to multiply. resistance to virulent pathogens can occur through a phenomenon called systemic acquired resistance   <cit> , which occurs after the hypersensitive response. sar reduces symptoms produced by a variety of pathogens, but not by all pathogens  <cit> . salicylic acid  plays a central signaling role in both gene-for-gene resistance and sar. this role for sa was proven by construction of transgenic plants expressing a bacterial salicylate hydroxylase gene  that converts sa to catechol  <cit> . during gene-for-gene resistance or infection with virulence pathogens, the nahg plants failed to express pathogenesis related  genes, and their susceptibility to both virulent and avirulent pathogens was greatly enhanced  <cit> .

mutants of the model plant arabidopsis thaliana have been used for studying sa-dependent regulation of plant defense responses. production of certain defense signals is controlled by the arabidopsis pad <dig>  gene. plants carrying pad <dig> mutations displayed reduced levels of sa, decreased expression of the defense gene pr <dig>  and reduced synthesis of the indole derivative, camalexin, after infection with a virulent strain of pseudomonas syringae <cit> . in contrast, the role of pad <dig> in defense against the green peach aphid myzus persicae sulzer is independent of sa and camalexin  <cit> . reported that pad <dig> encodes a nucleo-cytoplasmic protein which has similarity to triacyl glycerol lipases and other esterases. in defense signaling, pad <dig> acts in conjunction with the eds <dig> gene , which encodes a structurally related protein also found in the nucleus and cytoplasm  <cit> . eds <dig> is required for accumulation of pad <dig> protein  <cit> . eds <dig> also interacts with another lipase-like protein, sag <dig> , which accumulates in the nucleus  <cit> . the occurrence of eds1-pad <dig> and eds1-sag <dig> complexes inside plant cells suggests that eds <dig> works as an adaptor for both pad <dig> and sag <dig> in defense signaling  <cit> .

although pad <dig> has been extensively studied in arabidopsis, less is known about its role in conferring resistance to nematodes, and it is not known if atpad <dig> can function in economically important crops, such as soybean, to provide resistance to nematodes. the soybean cyst nematode  and the root-knot nematode  are obligatory plant parasites that are responsible for more than  <dig> billion u. s. dollars in yield losses annually of economic crops worldwide  <cit> . both nematode species establish complex feeding sites within their host plants. at infection, the pre-parasitic second stage juveniles  penetrate the roots and migrate towards the vascular cylinder where they induce the growth of a multinuclear feeding site, termed a ‘syncytium’ produced by scn and a ‘giant cell’ produced by rkn  <cit> .

the scn life cycle, which can be completed in about  <dig> days under optimum conditions, includes six stages: the egg, four juvenile stages, and the adult  <cit> . the only stage to infect plant roots is the j <dig>  which is motile and typically penetrates the host root and migrates to the vascular cylinder while secreting cell-wall degrading enzymes  <cit> . once there, the nematode injects proteins into a host cell through its stylet, inducing formation of the syncytium  <cit> . many physiological and morphological changes occur during formation of the syncytium: surrounding cell walls partially dissolve, nuclei enlarge, the density of organelles in the cytoplasm increases, and there is an accumulation of endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> . initiation and formation of the syncytium is a complicated process requiring an unknown host signal transduction pathway triggered by secretions from the nematode esophageal glands  <cit> . after the feeding site is initiated, the j <dig> molts to the j <dig> and j <dig> stages before finally developing into a female or male adult. the female remains sedentary at the feeding site while the mature male becomes mobile in the root to fertilize the female. the female extracts nourishment from the syncytium to support the production of several hundred eggs, most of which stay inside the female’s body, while others are excreted as a gelatinous mass into the soil. after the female dies, the body remains intact and hardens into a tough leathery sac known as a cyst. eggs and larvae can survive in the cyst body for several years until they are stimulated to hatch in the soil under favorable conditions  <cit> .

the life cycle of rkn varies from three weeks to several months depending on environmental factors such as temperature, moisture, and availability of a suitable host  <cit> . the infective second stage juveniles  penetrate the roots of the host plant using the piercing action of their stylets. once inside, the nematode releases esophageal secretions which induce the formation of a multinucleate feeding cell. the j <dig> becomes sedentary, feeds, and undergoes three molts . occasionally vermiform males develop and migrate out of the roots, while females remain sedentary, feeding and producing eggs in a gelatinous matrix. embryogenesis begins inside the egg, and j <dig> individuals hatch after the first molt  <cit> .

in this work, we demonstrate that overexpression of the arabidopsis gene atpad <dig> in transgenic soybean roots of composite plants can confer resistance to both scn and rkn.

RESULTS
agrobacterium transformation of soybean roots with red fluorescent protein 
the rfp gene was cloned into the prap <dig> vector and expressed in soybean roots to confirm the overexpression functionality of the prap <dig> vector . transformed roots were identified by the presence of green fluorescent protein  throughout the root . strong red fluorescence demonstrated that the figwort mosaic virus subgenomic transcript  promoter was successful in expressing the rfp gene in the transformed soybean roots. strong green fluorescence throughout the root demonstrated that the rold promoter was successful for driving the egfp gene . when the images were overlapped, the red and green fluorescence were co-localized . the magnification was 25x.

agrobacterium transformation of soybean roots with atpad4
we cloned the arabidopsis pad <dig>  gene into prap <dig> for overexpression in transgenic soybean roots of composite plants. the amino acid sequence of atpad <dig>  is moderately conserved with the closest soybean homolog glyma08g <dig>  . atpad <dig>  shares  <dig> % amino acids identity with gmpad <dig> . both proteins possess a lipase  <dig> motif conserved throughout numerous proteins.

of  <dig> soybean plants subjected to root transformation with the atpad <dig> gene, 55% showed evidence of transformation  <dig> days after planting as shown by egfp fluorescence. the transformation efficiency for the empty prap <dig> control plants was 74%. after partial trimming of the untransformed roots and an additional  <dig> days of growth, all untransformed roots were removed and the remaining roots displaying strong egfp fluorescence were inoculated with rkn or scn for assay.

molecular analysis of putative transgenic plants
the insertion of the atpad <dig> gene fragments in transgenic soybean plants was detected by pcr  using gene specific primers . the  <dig> bp fragment was amplified with the gene specific primers. four plants were tested and all were shown to contain transgenic dnas. no amplification was detected in untransformed control roots and control roots transformed with empty prap <dig> 

qrt-pcr to determine the expression of atpad <dig> gene in soybean roots
roots expressing egfp were further analyzed to determine the abundance of atpad <dig> gene transcripts by qrt-pcr using gene specific primers . the absolute quantification of the transcripts  was calculated using the sigmoidal method described by  <cit> . atpad <dig> transcripts in the overexpressing roots were abundant, while the control roots displayed no detectable to the atpad <dig> . the number of transcripts of atpad <dig> in the roots transformed with the atpad <dig> construct was calculated to be  <dig> molecules. although transcripts of atpad <dig> were not detectable in the control roots containing empty vector , transcripts of the housekeeping gene encoding ubiquitin- <dig> were similar in all samples .

in addition to measuring transcript levels of atpad <dig>  we also used qrt-pcr to determine the number of transcripts of three defense-related genes, gmpad4; gmeds <dig> and gmpr <dig> . the number of transcripts of gmpad <dig> in roots overexpressing atpad <dig> were almost double the number found in control roots. in the same roots, the number of transcripts of gmeds <dig> did not change significantly between atpad4-overexpressing roots and control roots. however, the number of transcripts of gmpr <dig> in atpad4-overexpressing roots was almost double that found in control roots containing empty vector.

effect of atpad <dig> overexpression in soybean roots resistance
resistance to soybean cyst nematode
the effect of overexpression of atpad <dig> in roots of the susceptible soybean cultivar ‘williams82’ on the development of scn females was examined by counting the number of mature scn females on atpad4-overexpressing and control roots  <dig> days after inoculation  . there was a 68% reduction in the mean number of scn females per plant on atpad4-overexpressing roots as compared to the prap <dig> control . when expressed as number of scn females per gram of root wet weight, the reduction was 76% in the atpad4-overexpressing plants. these differences are considered to be statistically significant , indicating that the expression of atpad <dig> in soybean roots interrupted the development of scn females .

resistance to root knot nematode
the effect of overexpression of atpad <dig> in roots of the susceptible soybean cultivar ‘williams82’ on the development of rkn galls was examined by counting the number of galls on atpad4-overexpressing and control roots  <dig> dai . under blue light, galls were easily identified as solid, thick green regions on the transformed roots. the mean number of rkn galls per plant was 77% lower on atpad4-overexpressing plants, compared to the prap <dig> control . when expressed as number of rkn galls per gram of root wet weight, the reduction was 72% in the atpad4-overexpressing plants. these differences are considered extremely statistically significant  and indicate that the atpad <dig> gene interrupted rkn development .

the size of rkn galls and of rkn nematodes within roots was determined  <dig> dai by measuring the area of their profiles using the leica microsystem software version  <dig>  for the laser capture microscope. the profile area of rkn galls in roots transformed with atpad <dig> was 86% smaller than that of rkn galls on control roots . similarly, the profile area of rkn nematodes was 66% smaller in atpad <dig> roots. thus there were many more immature nematodes in atpad <dig> roots than in control roots. we also observed fewer egg masses on the atpad <dig> roots.

discussion
plant pathogen interaction
sedentary endoparasitic nematodes comprise a large group of plant pathogens that infect and parasitize the roots of their hosts. the interaction between these nematodes and their hosts is highly complex, and their obligate root-parasitic nature has proven to be a hindrance to the molecular characterization of these pathosystems, including the targeted exploration of plant defense responses during nematode parasitism. as a consequence, compared with foliar bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens, there is a considerable lack of knowledge regarding which defense signaling genes or pathways are effective against plant-parasitic nematodes during a compatible interaction.

effective plant defense against pests and pathogens involves recognition and activation of appropriate defenses. similar underlying mechanisms are likely to control this fundamental process in all flowering plants  <cit> . therefore, structural and functional analysis of genes involved in plant defense in a model species such as arabidopsis thaliana  heynh, can facilitate the identification of structural and functional orthologs and their role in disease resistance pathways in other plant species  <cit> .

natural plant populations and breeding populations of crop plants show qualitative and quantitative phenotypic variation for resistance to pests and pathogens. qualitative resistance is characterized by two distinct phenotype classes, resistant and susceptible, and follows mendelian inheritance. it is this type of single gene- or resistance  gene-mediated resistance that has been most thoroughly studied in the context of plant-pathogen recognition and defense signaling  <cit> . in contrast, quantitative resistance is characterized by continuous phenotypic variation ranging from high susceptibility to high resistance among the recombinant individuals within a progeny. such resistance is controlled by more than one gene and can be strongly influenced by environmental factors. resistance to scn is controlled by several resistance  genes  <cit> , and soybean cultivars can display a range of reactions to scn encompassing highly susceptible to resistant depending upon the scn population used for testing and the complement of rhg genes within the genome of the cultivar. the resistance genes appear to work in a scn population-specific or race-specific manner and most contribute only a small, additive amount to resistance  <cit> .

arabidopsis-pathogen interactions
the genetic dissection of arabidopsis-pathogen interactions revealed great insights into plant defense and various defense signaling pathways. our knowledge of r gene-activated defenses, as well as regulators of salicylic acid , jasmonic acid , and ethylene  dependent response pathways has expanded greatly in the last two decades  <cit> . analyses of a. thaliana mutants that perturb various aspects of sa-mediated signal transduction has revealed that sa is an inhibitor of cyst nematode parasitism during a compatible interaction  <cit> . mutants unable to synthesize or accumulate sa  showed a consistently increased susceptibility phenotype to h. schachtii. the pretreatment of wild-type plants with sa significantly decreased their susceptibility to the nematode while simultaneously inducing pr- <dig> gene expression in both roots and shoots. taken together, these data strongly suggest that sa mediated signaling plays a significant role in limiting nematode parasitism during a compatible interaction.  <cit> showed that application of sa to tomato plants prior to inoculation with root-knot nematode alleviated root galling; however, this effect of sa was believed to be nematicidal in nature due to the high concentrations of sa that were used in the experiment.  <cit>  showed that pad <dig> modulates camalexin synthesis and sa synthesis and signaling in arabidopsis defense against pathogens.

although, there have been extensive studies on the defense response of arabidopsis to fungal and bacterial pathogens , little of this work in arabidopsis has been directly translated to economically important food crops, such as soybean, and particularly in respect to plant parasitic nematodes. the arabidopsis lipase-like protein phytoalexin deficient <dig>  was identified by several genetic studies as essential component for plant immunity against virulent pathogens for promoting the defense signaling hormone salicylic acid  and the phytoalexin camalexin  <cit> . our experiments show that atpad4can be used in an economically important crop, soybean, to provide a measure of resistance to two different genera of nematodes. in arabidopsis, the pad <dig> gene functions upstream of the defense responses triggered by sa  <cit> . pad <dig> can work in combination with eds <dig> to trigger aspects of the defense response, but eds <dig> can also interact with sag <dig> independent of pad <dig>  <cit> . in our experiments, overexpression of atpad <dig> in soybean roots did not greatly influence levels of transcripts of gmeds <dig>  but there was an increase in gm pr <dig> transcripts. pr <dig> transcription is responsive to increased sa levels and is downstream of sa  <cit> . overexpression expression of atpad <dig> in transgenic arabidopsis conferred resistance to green peach aphid  <cit> . this resistance did not require eds <dig>  our data, extend understanding of atpad <dig> by showing that this arabidopsis gene can be overexpressed in an economically important crop to confer resistance to two distinct genera of nematodes.

CONCLUSIONS
here, we demonstrated that the overexpression of atpad <dig> in roots of g. max confers resistance to two different genera of nematodes. it decreases the number of mature female scn cysts and decreased the number of galls formed by rkn in the susceptible soybean cultivar ‘williams82’. moreover, the size of rkn galls and nematodes in atpad4-expressing roots was significantly reduced and fewer egg masses were present, confirming that the ectopic overexpression atpad <dig> in soybean roots disrupted the rkn life cycle. this work provides a basis for unraveling the potential role of defense signaling genes in quantitative disease resistance in this major crop species, and it demonstrates that an arabidopsis gene can confer resistance in an important field crop to two genera of nematodes having worldwide importance.
