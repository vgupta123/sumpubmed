BACKGROUND
multiple myeloma  is a clonal b cell malignancy characterized by proliferation of plasma cells  within the bone marrow . globally, its incidence varies from  <dig> per  <dig>  people in china to about  <dig> per  <dig>  people in most developed countries  <cit> . mm is characterized by profound genomic instability involving both numerical and structural chromosomal aberrations of potential prognostic relevance  <cit> . nearly half of mm tumors are hyperdiploid  with multiple trisomies of non-random odd-numbered chromosomes, a low prevalence of chromosomal translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain  locus at 14q <dig> and chromosome  <dig> deletion  <cit> . it has been suggested that chromosomal abnormalities and other types of genetic or epigenetic alterations might contribute to mirna deregulation in cancer  <cit> .

mirnas are a newly discovered class of endogenous non-coding small rnas that regulate gene expression through degrading target mrnas and/or suppressing their translation by binding to the 3′-untranslated region  of target genes. bioinformatic predictions indicate that 30% of all human genes are regulated by mirnas. thus, mirnas are involved in a variety of biological processes, from development and differentiation to survival, apoptosis, and senescence  <cit> .

accumulating evidence suggests that mirnas that are significantly over-expressed in tumors may be a novel class of oncogene. termed “oncomirs”, these oncogene mirnas usually promote tumor development by negatively regulating tumor suppressor genes that control various biological processes. therefore, altering oncomir expression might be a valuable strategy for cancer treatment  <cit> .

differential mirna expression and high levels of oncomirs, including mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-17- <dig>  and mir-125b, have been reported in mm. mir- <dig> is frequently over-expressed in mm and is involved in proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, drug-resistance, and pathogenesis  <cit> . loffler et al. demonstrated that interleukin- <dig>  regulates mir- <dig> transcription in il6-dependent human myeloma cell lines  through a signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig> -related mechanism. importantly, ectopic expression of mir- <dig> was sufficient to sustain growth of il6-dependent mm cells in the absence of il <dig>  <cit> . this evidence indicates that mir- <dig> is an important oncomir in mm.

berberine , an alkaloid that was initially isolated from chinese herbs, is currently used as a traditional medicine to treat diarrhea caused by bacteria, although the mechanism for this action is unknown. accumulating evidence suggests that bb also elicits anti-cancer effects by inhibiting cell growth and inducing apoptosis in a variety of cancer cell lines  <cit> . animal studies have shown that bb can inhibit chemical-induced carcinogenesis, tumor promotion, and tumor invasion  <cit> . recent studies also show that bb exerts anti-cancer effects by inhibiting proliferation and reproduction of certain tumorigenic microorganisms and viruses, such as helicobacter pylori and hepatitis b. bb can also regulate the transcription of some oncogenes and carcinogenesis-related genes via interactions with dna and rna. furthermore, bb is a broad-spectrum enzyme inhibitor that affects n-acetyltransferase, cyclooxygenase- <dig>  and topoisomerase activities, as well as gene expression and protein synthesis  <cit> . thus, bb can regulate many oncogenic mrnas and proteins. however, whether bb can regulate mirnas remains unknown.

mirnas in animals have a highly conserved 5′-end sequence consisting of 7–8 nt called the seed sequence. the seed sequence binds with 100% complementarity to the target mrna and is a key feature in the recognition between a mirna and its target mrna  <cit> . inhibition of the seed sequence leads to a loss of mature mirna function, and is the target of anti-mirna oligonucleotides   <cit> .

in this research, we performed microarray analysis to explore the possibility that bb regulates mirna expression. our results show that bb differentially regulates the expression of a number of mirnas. forty-nine mirnas were down-regulated, of which  <dig> were shown by kegg analysis to be involved in p <dig> signaling, the cell cycle and other cancer pathways. of the  <dig> mirnas, mir- <dig> had the most target genes and participates in all the signaling pathways and can, therefore, be considered as one of the most important oncomirs. the role of mir- <dig> in mm was further investigated with the use of amo-mir- <dig>  our findings provide new insight into anti-cancer mechanisms of traditional chinese herbal medicines and provide evidence that they are effective in treating cancer.

methods
microarray analysis of mirna expression
based on our preliminary study, the mm cell line, rpmi- <dig>  was treated with 75 μm bb for 48 h. total mirna from 1 ×  <dig> cells was isolated and labeled using an mirvana™ mirna isolation kit and mirvana™ mirna labeling kit .. samples  labeled with cy3/cy <dig> were hybridized on mirna microarrays . after air drying, each chip was scanned with a generation iii array scanner . data analyses were performed using imagequant  <dig>  .

bioinformatic analysis
mirfocus software , developed by lc science usa, was used to analyze mirna-target gene pathways and to determine related mirna annotations .

oligonucleotides
an anti-mir- <dig> oligonucleotide  was designed according to sequence complementary to mature mirna-21: amo-mir- <dig>  5′-ataagcta-3′ . a control scramble amo  5′ -tcatacta-3′  was also synthesized . all oligodeoxynucleotides were chemically synthesized and modified with phosphorothioate and/or fluorescein isothiocyanate  by the shanghai sangon bio-engineering company, china. the sirna sequence of pdcd <dig>  was 5′-aagguggcuggaacaucuauu-3′. the rna duplexes were synthesized and purified by shanghai genepharma company, china.

cell lines, transfection and cell culture reagents
mm cell lines  were obtained from the shanghai institute of cell biology, china. the cells were cultured in rpmi containing 25 mm hepes, 10% fetal bovine serum ,  <dig>  mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine,  <dig> u/ml penicillin, and  <dig> u/ml streptomycin. the cells were grown in rpmi- <dig> medium containing 10% fetal calf serum  at 37°c in a 5% co <dig> humidified atmosphere .

bb was purchased from sigma-aldrich. rpmi- <dig> and u <dig> cells in the exponential phase of growth were seeded in 96- or 24-well plates  and transfected with  <dig>  μm amo-mir- <dig> using lipofectamine  <dig>  in serum-free rpmi- <dig>  pdcd <dig> sirna and control scr  were transfected into rpmi- <dig> and u <dig> cells using lipofectamine  <dig> according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

luciferase reporter assays
the full-length human pdcd <dig> 3′-utr  was pcr-amplified from cdna with the following primers: 5′-ccgctcgagatataagaactcttgcagtct-3′ and 5′-ataagaatgcggccgcacagaggatctttacatgttta-3′ containing noti and xhoi restriction site overhangs, respectively . the amplified product, which contains one putative mir- <dig> binding site, was cloned into psicheck- <dig>  immediately downstream of the renilla luciferase reporter gene and was named pdcd <dig> 3′-utr. site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the quikchange ii xl site-directed mutagenesis kit  to change three nucleotides in the seed sequence, in which ataagcta was substituted by tagctact. the mutant plasmid was named pdcd4-mut- 3′-utr.

rpmi- <dig> cells were cotransfected with  <dig> nm mir- <dig> or  <dig>  μm amo-mir- <dig> together with pdcd <dig> 3′-utr or pdcd4-mut-utr and assayed for luciferase activity 24 h post-transfection using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system . for each sample, firefly luciferase activity was normalized against renilla luciferase activity.

real-time pcr assay
rpmi- <dig> and u <dig> cells were treated with 75 μm and 120 μm bb, respectively. total rna was extracted in trizol . the levels of mir- <dig> and u <dig> small nuclear rna  were determined using a mirna rt-pcr quantitation kit . u <dig> snrna was used as the internal control, and the fold-change in mir- <dig> expression was calculated using the 2−ΔΔct method.

rpmi- <dig> cells were transfected with  <dig>  μm amo-mir- <dig> using lipofectamine  <dig> and cultured for 48 h. levels of pdcd <dig> mrna were determined using sybr-green real-time pcr assays. pdcd <dig> primers used were 5′-ccaaagaaaggtggtgca-3′ and 5′-tgaggtacttccagttcc-3′ and gapdh primers were 5′-caacggatttggtcgtatt-3′ and 5′-cacagtcttctgg gtggc-3′. pdcd <dig> mrna levels were normalized to those of gapdh.

western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay  buffer in the presence of proteinase inhibitor . cell lysates  were denatured in laemmli sample buffer  for 5 min at  <dig> °c, separated by 10% sds-page and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. membranes were blocked with 5%  fat-free milk in phosphate-buffered saline  and  <dig> %  tween- <dig> for 1 h, and then incubated with anti-pdcd <dig> antibody  at room temperature for 2 h. after washing, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. signals were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence  , and analyzed using a bi- <dig> system ,.

rpmi- <dig> and u <dig> cells were treated with 75 μm and 120 μm bb, respectively.

il <dig> protein levels in supernatants were determined using a human il <dig> elisa kit .

mtt assay
rpmi- <dig> cell viability was determined by 3-- <dig> - diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide  assays. briefly, cells were seeded at a density of 1 ×  <dig> cells/ml in 96-well plates . the cells were treated with bb  or amo-mir- <dig> . at 48 h post-treatment, 20 μl mtt stock solution  was added to each well, and the plate was incubated for 4 h at 37°c. the media was then removed, and dimethyl sulfoxide   was added to dissolve the blue formazan crystals produced by viable cells. cell viability was assessed by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm on a bio-rad microtiter plate reader.

colony assay
the colony assay for dispersed single cells was performed to measure the capacity of cells to form colonies. cells treated with bb  or amo-mir- <dig>  were seeded onto a 24-well plate  and mixed thoroughly with  <dig> % methylcellulose solution in rpmi- <dig> containing 20% fbs. single cells were randomly and evenly distributed throughout each well. colonies were formed during incubation for 1– <dig> weeks at 37°c in a 5% co <dig> humidified atmosphere. light microscopy was used to observe and count colonies containing more than  <dig> cells.

flow cytometry
flow cytometry  was performed to analyze cell cycle profiles and levels of apoptosis. for cell cycle analysis, cells were collected, rinsed twice with pbs, fixed in 70% ethanol for 1 h at 4°c and stained with propidium iodide  solution  containing rnase a . cell cycle was analyzed using flow cytometry according to dna content. to analyze apoptosis, cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate -conjugated annexin v and pi. for each sample, data from approximately  <dig>  cells were recorded in the list mode on logarithmic scales. apoptotic and necrotic cells were analyzed by performing quadrant statistics on pi-negative/annexin v-positive cells and pi/annexin v double-positive cells, respectively.

RESULTS
bb modulates mirna expression in mm cells
of the  <dig> mirnas represented on the microarray,  <dig> were differentially expressed between bb-treated and control cells ;  <dig> were down-regulated, and  <dig> were up-regulated compared to control. further analysis revealed that nine of the  <dig> down-regulated mirnas were potential oncomirs, and three of the  <dig> up-regulated mirnas are considered tumor suppressor genes . among the  <dig> down-regulated mirnas, mirfocus software identified  <dig> that are involved in p <dig> signaling, the cell cycle and other cancer pathways . of these, mir- <dig>  has the most identified target genes and participates in all the above signaling pathways. thus mir- <dig> can be considered as one of the most important oncomirs. these results suggest that bb suppression of mm might involve mirna-mediated gene expression.

regulation of mirna- <dig>  il <dig> and pdcd <dig> levels by berberine and the effects of exogenous il <dig> on mirna- <dig> expression in mm cells
to validate down-regulation of mir- <dig> by bb and to investigate the effect of exogenous il <dig> on bb-modulated mirna- <dig> expression in mm, rpmi- <dig> and u <dig> cells were treated without or with 75 μm or 120 μm bb, respectively, in the absence or presence of il <dig> . total rna and/or protein was isolated and analyzed for the expression of mir- <dig> and pdcd <dig> using real-time pcr and western blot analyses. as shown in figure  <dig>  bb treatment significantly down-regulated mir- <dig> levels in a dose-dependent manner, and exogenous il <dig> somewhat rescued bb-mediated down-regulation of mir- <dig> . interestingly, bb also reduced the level of il <dig> in supernatant . il <dig> is an important oncogene in mm and is involved in mir- <dig> transcription  <cit> . these results confirmed that bb down-regulates mir- <dig> and il <dig> and consequently the mirna target gene, pdcd <dig> was up-regulated . meanwhile, exogenous il <dig> could rescue bb-induced mirna- <dig> down-regulation in mm cells.

bb down-regulates stat <dig> mrna levels in mm cells
bioinformatic analysis showed that sequence upstream of the mir- <dig> gene contained two putative stat <dig> binding sites . to investigate whether bb affects stat <dig> mrna levels, rpmi- <dig> and u <dig> cells were treated with 75 μm and 120 μm bb, respectively. stat <dig> mrna levels were significantly decreased . stat <dig> is recruited to the mir- <dig> regulatory region in response to il <dig>  <cit> ; therefore, bb-mediated down-regulation of il <dig> might cause transcriptional inhibition of mir- <dig> via reduced stat <dig> action.

pdcd <dig> is a direct target of mirna-21
because bb treatment reduced mirna- <dig> levels in mm cells, we next examined whether bb also regulated the expression of genes targeted by mirna- <dig>  we first focused on the pdcd <dig> gene, which is known to be targeted by mir- <dig>  amo-mir- <dig> was transfected into rpmi- <dig> cells to knock down endogenous mir- <dig>  as shown in additional file 1: figure s5a and s5b, pdcd <dig> mrna and protein levels were significantly increased in amo-mir-21-transfected cells compared with control-transfected cells, suggesting that pdcd <dig> is regulated by mir- <dig> 

we performed luciferase reporter assays to determine whether pdcd <dig> is a direct target of mir- <dig>  the luciferase reporter plasmid containing the 3′-utr of pdcd <dig>  or a mutant pdcd <dig> 3′-utr containing a mutation in the putative mir- <dig> binding site  were co-transfected with amo-mir- <dig> or a mirna- <dig> mimic. the firefly luciferase plasmid was used as an internal control. as shown in additional file 1: figure s5c, over-expression of the mir- <dig> mimic significantly suppressed luciferase activity, whereas transfection of amo-mir- <dig> significantly increased luciferase activity in cells transfected with pdcd4-3′utr. in contrast, luciferase activities in cells transfected with pdcd4-mut-3′utr were not significantly changed by either over-expression or knockdown of mir- <dig> . these results indicate that pdcd <dig> might be a direct target of mir- <dig> 

transfection efficiency and localization of amo-mir- <dig> in rpmi-8266
amo-mir- <dig> was modified with fitc, and transfected into rpmi- <dig> cells using lipofectamine  <dig>  high levels of amo-mir-21-fitc were detected, mainly in the cytoplasm . flow cytometry showed that at 24 h and 48 h post-transfection  <dig> % and  <dig> % of cells, respectively, were fitc-positive .

bb and amo-mir- <dig> inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis
to determine the effects of bb on mm cell growth via mir- <dig>  rpmi- <dig> cells were treated with bb  or amo-mir- <dig>  as described in materials and methods. cell viability was assessed by triplicate mtt assays. as shown in figure 3a, treatment with bb at 50 μm or higher significantly inhibited cell proliferation. similar results were also observed when mir- <dig> was knocked down by amo-mir- <dig> , and these effects were dose-dependent. thus, both bb and amo-mir- <dig> inhibited mm cell viability, indicating that the bb-mediated cell death might involve mir- <dig> down-regulation.

we next investigated whether bb treatment or mir- <dig> inhibition could induce apoptosis in mm cells. to this end, rpmi- <dig> cells were treated with bb or transfected with amo-mir- <dig>  the cells were then stained with annexin v and pi and analyzed by flow cytometry. as shown in figure 3b and additional file 1: figure s <dig>  both treatments significantly increased the number of apoptotic cells, indicating that bb treatment and mir- <dig> inhibition induce apoptosis.

bb and amo-mir- <dig> induce g2-phase cell cycle arrest
to investigate the effect of bb treatment or mir- <dig> inhibition on the cell cycle, rpmi- <dig> cells were treated with bb or transfected with amo-mir- <dig> and then subjected to cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry. as shown in figure 3c and additional file 1: figure s <dig>  bb treatment resulted in an accumulation of cells in the g2/m phase. interestingly, mir- <dig> inhibition by amo-mir- <dig> produced almost identical effects on the cell cycle to those observed following bb treatment. these results indicate that bb-induced g2/m arrest in mm cells is at least partially mediated via mir- <dig> down-regulation.

bb and amo-mir- <dig> suppress colony formation
colony growth is closely related to neoplastic capacity. to investigate the effect of bb and amo-mir- <dig> on colony formation in rpmi- <dig> cells, colony growth assays were performed. one week post-treatment, we found that rpmi- <dig> cells treated with amo-mir- <dig> or bb showed fewer colonies, compared to the control groups . these results indicate that both bb and mir- <dig> knockdown had an inhibitory effect on the malignant growth capacity of mm cells.

testing sirnas for their ability to silence pdcd4
to examine whether mir- <dig> down-regulation is associated with bb-induced cytotoxicity, we further studied the effect of pdcd <dig> knockdown in mm cells. we designed three sirnas against the pdcd <dig> gene and evaluated their knockdown efficiency using real-time pcr analysis. we found that one sirna efficiently knocked down pdcd <dig> mrna and down-regulated pdcd <dig> protein levels in rpmi- <dig> cells .

pdcd <dig> sirna ameliorates berberine-induced inhibition of mm cell growth
next, we examined whether pdcd <dig> knockdown could rescue the cytotoxic effect of bb treatment. rpmi- <dig> and u <dig> cells transfected with pdcd <dig> or control sirna were treated with bb for 72 h, and cell viability was assessed by mtt assays. as shown in figure 5c,d, pdcd <dig> sirna transfection alone did not affect cell viability. however, pdcd <dig> depletion significantly ameliorated bb-induced growth inhibition, indicating that pdcd <dig> could be a downstream effector protein in the bb-induced cell growth inhibition pathway, and that it might be a tumor suppressor in mm cells.

discussion
traditional chinese medicine is an inexpensive treatment strategy. however, for most treatments neither the underlying therapeutic mechanisms nor the molecular targets of active compounds are well defined. here, we describe a mechanism in mm cells by which bb inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest  via the regulation of mir- <dig> .

mir- <dig> is over-expressed in the vast majority of cancer types analyzed so far and is thus recognized as an important oncomir  <cit> . inhibition of mir- <dig> suppressed cell growth in culture and tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model  <cit> . recently, medina et al. demonstrated that mir- <dig> over-expression leads to a pre-b malignant lymphoid-like phenotype and that inhibiting mir- <dig> alone induces complete tumor regression in a few days, suggesting that mir- <dig> is a central oncomir in tumor formation  <cit> . interestingly, mm is also a b cell neoplasm of clonal malignant cells in the bone marrow. another group has also suggested that mir- <dig> as a key oncomir in mm  <cit> .our results show that bb down-regulates mir- <dig> levels in mm cell lines  , but does not affect mir- <dig> levels in il6-independent human myeloid leukemia cells .

bioinformatic analysis identified two putative stat <dig> binding sites upstream of the mir- <dig> gene , and stat <dig> mrna levels were significantly decreased by bb . stat <dig> has been validated to be recruited to the mir- <dig> regulatory region in response to il <dig>  <cit> . our data indicate that il <dig> levels in cell supernatants were significantly reduced by bb. exogenous il <dig> could partly ameliorate bb-mediated mir- <dig> down-regulation . thus, in mm, down-regulation of il <dig> by bb might lead to the inhibition of mir- <dig> transcription through stat <dig> down-regulation.

antisense oligonucleotides targeting mrnas have been successfully used to identify mirna functions and for the development of therapeutic agents  <cit> . as mirnas are small nucleic acids , antisense inhibition is considered to be the best and possibly the only practical approach for specific pharmacological inhibition of their function  <cit> . recently, an 8-mer nucleic acid complementary to the seed region of an mirna, called a tiny anti-mirna, was used to antagonize mirna function  <cit> . in this study, high levels of amo-mir-21-fitc were detected by confocal microscopy, mainly in the cytoplasm , and  <dig> % of cells were fitc positive at 24 h post-transfection . here, we have investigated the anti-mm effects of amo-mir- <dig> and compared them with those of bb.

we also verified that pdcd <dig> is a direct target of mir- <dig> . like amo-mir- <dig>  bb treatment down-regulated mir- <dig> and up-regulated pdcd <dig>  intriguingly, bb and amo-mir- <dig> produced almost identical effects on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle profile . therefore, we conclude that the anti-mm activity of bb might be achieved, at least in part, through the inhibition of mir-21/pdcd <dig> signaling.

the identification of mirna target genes is necessary to assess the roles of aberrantly expressed mirnas in human cancer and to subsequently develop mirna-based gene therapies. mir- <dig> is strongly up-regulated in a variety of human neoplastic disorders. it can target and, therefore, can potentially regulate a number of important tumor suppressor genes , which has attracted the attention of researchers in various fields  <cit> . pdcd <dig>  a 64 kda protein, is an important, recently identified tumor suppressor that inhibits cell transformation, translation and invasion. pdcd <dig> is down-regulated in several types of human cancer  <cit> , and is an independent predictor of poor prognosis in renal cell carcinoma patients  <cit> . consistent with this notion, we show here that both bb and amo-mir- <dig> up-regulate pdcd <dig> by suppressing mir- <dig> . silencing pdcd <dig> with sirna rescued bb-induced cytotoxicity . furthermore, pdcd <dig> modulates the expression of other genes on two levels. pdcd <dig> affects transcription of certain genes by inhibiting the activity of specific transcription factors, such as c-jun  <cit> , sp <dig>  <cit>  and p <dig>  <cit> . in addition, pdcd <dig> is thought to act as a suppressor of translation. a substantial body of evidence also suggests that pdcd <dig> is associated with p <dig> mrna and suppresses its translation, thereby maintaining a low level of p <dig> in unstressed cells. this suppression is abrogated due to low levels of pdcd <dig> after dna damage  <cit> . these observations are consistent with our predictions from the bioinformatic analysis .

mechanisms of drug-insensitivity or resistance are involved in the apoptotic capacity of cancer cells  <cit> . almost all cytotoxic anti-tumor drugs used clinically exert their effects by inducing apoptosis  <cit> . it is known that tumors escape apoptotic signals by expressing anti-apoptotic proteins, such as bcl- <dig> family proteins  <cit> . our study indicated that, similar to the effect caused by amo-mir- <dig> inhibition of mir- <dig>  bb treatment significantly promoted apoptosis, demonstrating the potential of bb and of targeting mir- <dig> for the treatment of mm . hu et al. also show that mir- <dig> mediates berberine-induced apoptosis in human multiple myeloma cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
to the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to show that the traditional chinese medicine, bb, modulates the expression profile of many mirnas in mm cells by down-regulating oncomirs and/or up-regulating tumor suppressor mirnas. our data show that bb treatment of mm cells down-regulated mir- <dig>  probably via inhibition of il6/stat <dig>  and led to the up-regulation of pdcd <dig>  which was likely to result in suppression of the p <dig> signaling pathway. therefore, bb is a therapeutic candidate for the treatment of mm . our work also provides new insight into the mechanisms underlying the anti-cancer effect of a traditional chinese herbal medicine.
