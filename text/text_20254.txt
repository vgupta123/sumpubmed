BACKGROUND
human t-lymphotropic virus  <dig>  is the causal agent of adult t-cell leukemia , htlv-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis  and other inflammatory disorders that may develop after a variable period ranging from months to decades  <cit> .

decisions regarding atl treatment should be based on the classification of atl subtype, the prognostic factors at disease onset, comorbidities and the response to initial therapy  <cit> . there was a successful study combining zidovudine and interferon alpha for atl and atl-lymphoma  <cit> , but the most recent novelty in drugs for atl is a promising therapeutic molecule based on a zinc finger nuclease designed to recognize and disrupt the promoter function of the htlv- <dig> ltr and specifically to kill htlv-1-infected cells, which was tested in in vitro and in vivo models  <cit> .

since the discovery of ham/tsp, various therapeutic approaches have been used for patients presenting unremitting myelopathic symptoms. however, treatment is mainly symptomatic, and therapeutic guidelines for ham/tsp are missing mainly due to the lack of randomized double-blind controlled clinical trials  <cit> . because induction of chronic inflammation in the spinal cord by htlv-1-infected t-cells was recognized as the major pathogenic mechanism underlying ham/tsp, anti-inflammatory and antiviral therapies have been tested  <cit> , and some clinical benefit has been demonstrated for corticosteroids, mainly oral prednisolone and intravenous methylprednisolone  <cit> , interferon-α  <cit>  and ifn-β <dig>  <cit> . in a recent study, the evaluation of the ex vivo and in vitro effects of ascorbic acid and ifn-α treatment on pbmcs of seronegative, asymptomatic carriers and ham/tsp patients demonstrated antiproliferative and cell death-inducing and immunomodulatory effects of high-dose ascorbic acid  <cit> .

plants are recognized for their ability to produce a wealth of secondary metabolites, and many species have been used for centuries to treat a variety of diseases  <cit> . many of these natural products have been shown to have interesting biological and pharmacological activities and are used as chemotherapeutic agents or serve as the starting point in the development of modern medicines  <cit> . alomia myriadenia schultz-bip. ex baker  is an herb occurring in the central regions of brazil. the ethanol extract of a. myriadenia contains the labdane-type diterpene myriadenolide . labdane-type diterpenes are known to occur in terrestrial plants and marine organisms. they display interesting biological activities, such as antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antileishmanial, cardiotonic, cytotoxic and immunomodulatory activities, and show potential for use as new drugs  <cit> . herein, we report evaluation of the antiviral potential of myriadenolide as a strategy for the development of new therapeutics to treat htlv-1-infected patients. we show promising results for the regulation of viral messengers, expression of viral proteins, and viral morphogenesis, as evaluated with transmission electron microscopy  and atomic force microscopy .

RESULTS
measurement of amy cytotoxicity
to determine amy cytotoxicity, mt <dig>  jurkat cells and human pbmc were treated with  <dig> ,  <dig>  or  <dig>  μm amy for  <dig> hours and the assay results are the mean of three independent experiments. for human pbmcs, the assay was performed in triplicate and with peripheral blood obtained from eight individuals. as demonstrated in figure  <dig>  treatment with different concentrations of amy did not induce a significant reduction of cell viability in any of the cell types evaluated, compared to the diluent control , showing the safety of this compound for the cell types tested, including human pbmcs, used as a control for normal cells.figure  <dig>

the mrna levels of the viral genes gag-pol  and tax-rex  were quantified in mt- <dig> after  <dig> hours of amy treatment using real-time pcr and were normalized to a cellular housekeeping gene . the analysis demonstrated that myriadenolide was able to inhibit the expression of gag-pol mrna at  <dig> μm of amy . however, inhibition of tax-rex mrna expression was not observed at any concentration tested.figure  <dig>

anti–htlv- <dig> activity of amy in mt- <dig> cell line
western blot assays were performed to determine the effect of myriadenolide on the expression level of structural protein p <dig>  and gp <dig>  in mt- <dig> cells after  <dig> hours of amy treatment at varying concentrations . mt- <dig> cells treated with amy showed a reduction in the viral proteins tested . it was interesting to observe that for matrix protein p <dig> and env protein gp <dig>  all amy concentrations clearly decrease the level of protein expression, even at the lowest drug concentration.figure  <dig> 
expression of viral proteins is reduced in mt- <dig> cells treated with myriadenolide. mt- <dig> cells were treated with different concentrations of myriadenolide  and viral protein expression was assessed.  monoclonal primary antibodies were used to quantify protein expression: anti- gp <dig>  p <dig> and gapdh. densitometric analysis was performed on imagej software to examine the level of htlv- <dig> structural proteins normalized by gapdh.  selectivity index was calculated using cc10/ec <dig> as described in materials and methods. ec = effective concentration; cc = cytotoxic concentration.



in our assays, to determine the selectivity index of amy, we choose to use the ratio cc10/ec <dig> , as this is pharmacologically more accurate in evaluating how safe a compound is as a drug  <cit> . the ec <dig> value of amy to reduce levels of gp <dig> and p <dig> was  <dig>  μm, whereas its 10% cytotoxic concentration  was  <dig>  μm. consequently, its selectivity index based on the ratio cc10/ec <dig> was  <dig> . these results suggest that amy has antiviral activity interfering with the expression of structural proteins of htlv- <dig> 

evaluation of amy antiviral activity in mt- <dig> cells using transmission electron microscopy  and atomic force microscopy 
the tem and afm analyses of mt- <dig> cells were performed  <dig> h post-incubation in the presence or absence of  <dig> μm amy . comparison of treated and untreated cells by tem shows that treatment with amy alters both the release of viral particles and the morphology / <dig> and 4/ <dig>  respectively). however, we do acknowledge that the tem may not be able to precisely determine whether these are actual complete virus particles or just empty capsids. nonetheless, this observation was corroborated using afm , and because this technique favors counting the number of particles per field evaluated, it was shown that amy treatment reduced the number of particles on the cell surface by 47%. of the  <dig> virus particles quantified by tem,  <dig> viral particles were measured in cells treated with amy and  <dig> in untreated cells. in the untreated cells, the virus particles ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> nm , and in the treated cells, they ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> nm . using afm, a total of  <dig> virus particles were measured  and the size of viruses ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  nm  in untreated cells, whereas the sizes ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  nm  in amy treated cells.figure  <dig>

discussion
htlv- <dig> is responsible for inducing a severe myelopathy and leukemia in humans, in addition to a number of other inflammatory pathologies for which treatment and therapeutic protocols are still ineffective. consequently, htlv- <dig> is responsible for a significant burden of morbidity and mortality  <cit> . in the present study, we address the possible antiviral activity of the labdane-type diterpene myriadenolide  for htlv- <dig>  the antiviral activity of the terpenes has been reported for hiv  <cit>  and herpesvirus  <cit> , among other viruses.

htlv- <dig> mainly infects cd <dig> t cells and deregulates their differentiation, function and homeostasis, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of htlv- <dig> inducing chronic inflammatory diseases  <cit> . htlv gene products are engaged in dynamic activating and antagonistic interactions with host cells, mainly driven by the tax  <cit>  and hbz proteins  <cit> . however, recent mapping of the htlv- <dig> and htlv- <dig> host-pathogen interactome showed that other viral proteins, including gag and env from both viruses, are implicated in a diverse set of cellular processes, such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system, apoptosis, multiple cancer pathways and the notch signaling pathway  <cit> . naturally infected lymphocytes produce virtually no cell-free virions in vivo, and htlv- <dig> is transmitted cell-to-cell through the formation of virological synapses, which are formed between an infected source cell and a susceptible target cell and play an important role in the spread of virus in the host  <cit> . it has also been demonstrated that there is a rapid transfer of enveloped htlv- <dig> particles across virological synapses  <cit> , reinforcing the idea that the glycoprotein env is required for htlv- <dig> infectivity  <cit> . before these events, important early steps in the htlv- <dig> assembly pathway include genome recognition , as well as gag-gag and gag-cellular protein interactions. the gag polyprotein is composed of three domains: matrix , capsid  and nucleocapsid . in later steps upon budding or immediately after immature particle release, proteolytic cleavage of gag polyproteins takes place and results in virus particle core maturation, showing that gag coordinates assembly and viral budding  <cit> . taken together, this information about morphogenesis, viral spread and virus-cell regulation introduces new concepts to target drugs for htlv- <dig> 

in this context, our results first revealed that the myriadenolide compound was able to reduce the accumulation of gag-pol mrna at  <dig> μm after  <dig> hours of treatment . htlv- <dig> requires regulated gene expression from unspliced and alternatively spliced transcripts for efficient replication and persistence, being able to export intron-containing mrna’s to cytoplasm for subsequent translation, function related to the viral protein rex  <cit> . rex phosphoprotein acts posttranscriptionally by preferentially binding, stabilizing, and selectively exporting the unspliced and incompletely spliced viral mrna from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, essentially regulating production of the virion components  <cit> . experiments conducted with transient transfection of 293t cells with the htlv- <dig> plasmid, as well as newly htlv- <dig> infected human pbmcs, clarified that incompletely spliced  and doubly spliced transcripts  are not generated at the same rate from full-length transcripts   <cit> . other important point is that unlike the gag/pol and env transcripts encoding the structural and enzymatic proteins, the efficient expression and cytoplasmic export of the alternatively spliced regulatory and accessory transcripts are not directly dependent on rex  <cit> . however, the exact mechanism supporting the distinct activity observed upon amy treatment for gag-pol and tax-rex transcripts remains to be determined. nonetheless, we could speculate that phenomenon is based on differential gene expression regulation and rex dependence for stability and transport of the both transcripts.

we observed a significant reduction on p <dig> and gp <dig> protein expression when using three different amy concentrations . curiously the decreasing concentrations of amy have increasing inhibitory activity on htlv- <dig> antigen expression in mt <dig> cells . this represents the hormetic dose-response effect , in which a low dose can define the therapeutic zone . hormesis is a dose response relationship in which effects at low doses are opposite to those at high doses. recent relevant reports analyzing hormetic dose responses indicates that this phenomenon can have specific mechanisms mediated by different receptors and signaling pathways, having biological diverse effects in distinct doses  <cit> . thus, hormesis could explain why the lowest concentration of amy  was best at reducing viral protein expression. nonetheless, we did not see the same effect when analyzing transcript levels for the same proteins. at this point we still do not have a verifiable explanation to this otherwise biological effect.

the results also emphasize that amy demonstrated no cytotoxicity when evaluated at concentrations up to  <dig> μm, as previously described by our group  <cit> . the selectivity index  showed that reduction of viral protein expression occurs with low toxicity. in drug discovery, it is desirable to have a high therapeutic/selectivity index . an index higher than  <dig> is considered as indicative of highly active compounds  <cit> .

in concert with tem, which clearly showed differences in particle morphology in treated and untreated cells , we used scanning afm in air tapping mode to obtain more reliable results for viral particle measurement and number of budding particles. for untreated cells, the viruses ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  nm , and in treated cells, they ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  nm . experiments using tem and afm proved that treatment of mt- <dig> for  <dig> hours using  <dig>  μm myriadenolide was able to reduce the amount of virus at the cell surface  and to modify the morphogenesis of viral particles, in accordance with the protein inhibition observed in western blot assays.

CONCLUSIONS
these results showed promising anti-htlv- <dig> activity, mainly inhibition of gag and env protein expression and interference in viral budding and morphogenesis. it may be hypothesized that disruption in viral replication functions could reduce viral spread in infected hosts, suggesting a potential for amy to be used as an anti-htlv- <dig> therapeutic drug.
