BACKGROUND
wheat provides approximately one fifth of the calories in the human diet and is an important source of vegetable protein and nutrients for a large proportion of the world's population. modern wheat varieties differ in their grain concentrations of n, zn and fe  <cit>  and therefore, increases in the nutritional quality of the wheat grain are possible and have the potential to alleviate nutrient deficiencies. in addition, increases in grain protein content  are associated with improved pasta and breadmaking quality and, therefore, are rewarded by higher prices in many wheat growing regions.

wheat grain nutritional content is dependent on the remobilization of amino acids and nutrients from vegetative tissues to the grain during whole plant senescence  <cit> . in monocarpic plants, such as wheat, senescence is a coordinated process acting at the whole-plant level, during which genetically-programmed and developmentally-controlled catabolic activities convert cellular material into exportable nutrients that are remobilized from the leaves to the grain  <cit> . therefore, nutrient remobilization and senescence are intrinsically interconnected processes, and further improvements in grain nutritional value will require a better understanding of the gene regulatory networks controlling both processes. unfortunately, this developmental stage has not been studied in great depth, as exemplified by the absence of dedicated senescence libraries in currently available wheat est resources in ncbi.

monocarpic senescence is an active process during which the plant must disassemble complex molecules, increase active transport mechanisms and maintain functional conductive tissues, while coordinating the programmed death of depleted leaf cells. various plant hormones coordinate the initiation and progression of these processes, with abscisic acid  playing a central role . this hormone appears to be the primary signal produced during senescence induction by both drought and high temperature  <cit> . several lines of evidence have also indicated important roles for other hormones including jasmonic acid   <cit> , salicylic acid   <cit>  and ethylene  <cit> .

leaf cells undergo dramatic physiological and metabolic changes upon the initiation and progression of monocarpic senescence. one of the earliest responses in senescence is the degradation of the photosynthetic machinery. chloroplasts, which account for approximately three quarters of the organic nitrogen of mesophyll cells, are dismantled early during senescence  <cit> . proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids are degraded and catabolic products are supplied to the filling grains  <cit> . as rubisco and other chloroplast proteins are hydrolyzed by proteolytic enzymes, cellular and phloematic pools of free amino acids increase, accelerating their remobilization to the grains  <cit> . remobilization of micronutrients  across plant membranes  is mediated by transporters encoded by various gene families. different transporter gene families have both specific and overlapping abilities to carry different metal cations, potentially acting in concert to regulate the remobilization of micronutrients to the developing grain.

gene expression studies using microarray technologies in arabidopsis  <cit> , populus  <cit> , barley  <cit>  and wheat  <cit>  have shown that senescence is driven by transcription factor networks that regulate the timely expression of hundreds of senescence associated genes  illustrating how nutrient salvage requires a complex array of regulatory networks and metabolic pathways  <cit> . the complexity of the multiple gene networks involved in the initiation and progression of senescence makes it hard to decipher the interactions between individual genes, and the identification of central nodes of the senescence regulatory network.

the existence of a close connection between senescence and nutrient remobilization was also evident in the simultaneous effect of the gpc-b <dig>  gene on both processes. the 6b chromosome segment including this gene was initially introgressed from wild emmer wheat  into durum and common wheat as a source of genetic variation for grain protein content  <cit> , and was later shown to accelerate senescence  <cit> . positional cloning of this gene showed that gpc-b <dig> is a nac transcription factor related to the arabidopsis nac-like, activated by ap3/pi  gene, which is also involved in the regulation of leaf senescence, as are other members of the nac family  <cit> . a paralogous gene, designated gpc- <dig>  is present on chromosomes 2b  and 2d  of hexaploid wheat and shows a similar transcription profile to gpc-b <dig>  <cit> .

most commercial pasta and bread wheat varieties have a non-functional copy of gpc-b <dig> and the addition of the functional copy from wild wheat increases n, fe and zn concentration in the wheat grain  <cit> . in contrast, down-regulation of all functional copies of gpc in transgenic hexaploid wheat plants expressing a stable rna interference construct  significantly delayed senescence  and decreased n, fe and zn remobilization to the wheat grain   <cit> .

the gpc gene is rapidly up-regulated after anthesis before any visible symptoms of senescence, suggesting that it is an early positive regulator of senescence. therefore, the available gpc-rnai transgenic wheat plants and their non-transgenic control represent an excellent entry point to study the gene networks regulating senescence in wheat. direct cdna sequencing approaches  for transcriptome profiling using next generation sequencing technologies provide high-resolution methods for quantifying gene expression levels on a genome-wide scale  <cit> . to start deciphering the gpc-dependent transcriptome we applied roche  <dig> pyrosequencing  technology for de novo transcriptome assembly and illumina systems to quantify the expression of  <dig>  contigs representing  <dig>  wheat genes.

comparison of the transcriptomes of flag leaves from wild type and transgenic gpc-rnai lines  <dig> days after anthesis yielded a set of genes likely regulated by gpc during the early stages of wheat monocarpic senescence.

RESULTS
de novo transcriptome assembly
the over-expression of the gpc-rnai construct, under the regulation of the 35s promoter, reduced the transcript levels of all homoeologous copies of gpc- <dig> and its close paralog gpc- <dig>  by approximately 35% at  <dig> days after anthesis  and by 67% at  <dig> daa, relative to the wild type  non-transgenic sister lines . senescence in gpc-rnai plants was delayed by approximately three weeks, as previously reported  <cit> . to investigate the effect of the down-regulation of the gpc transcription factors on the early stages of senescence, we focused our  <dig> de novo transcriptome assembly and illumina expression studies on rna samples collected from flag leaves at <dig> daa, when gpc transcript levels are approximately one third of their level at the transcriptional peak  <cit> . at this time point, gpc-rnai transgenic plants showed significantly lower levels of gpc transcripts than the wt controls, but neither genotype showed visual symptoms of senescence . 'bobwhite'  frequently shows leaf tip necrosis, but this was observed with equal frequency in both genotypes and was unrelated to the onset of terminal senescence. even at  <dig> daa, when additional samples were collected for qrt-pcr time course studies, there were still no visible signs of senescence in either genotype .

since no wheat senescence transcriptome was available to use as a reference, we generated a de novo transcriptome assembly from flag leaves  <dig> days after anthesis using the  <dig> sequencing platform. this technology generates longer transcripts than illumina, facilitating de novo assembly  <cit> . we sequenced four biological replicates per genotype using two  <dig> runs  and produced  <dig> , <dig> reads, with a median sequence length of  <dig> nucleotides . the numbers of reads per plant are described in additional file  <dig> table s1).

eighty percent of the reads  were assembled into  <dig>  contigs with a median length of  <dig> nucleotides . contigs were assembled using the default parameters of the gs assembler  and, as a consequence, homeologous copies of the same gene were generally assembled within the same contig. eleven percent of the reads  were not assembled into contigs and are referred hereafter as singletons . ninety percent of these singletons showed significant similarity to either wheat ests  or rice proteins . the sequences of the  <dig>  singletons that show similarities to either of these databases are available as a multi-fasta file in supplemental online materials . the residual 9% of the total  <dig> sequences  were eliminated based on various quality criteria .

almost 95% of the 454-contigs  showed high levels of similarity to wheat ests  over most of their lengths . seventy nine percent of the contigs  also showed significant similarity  to sequences in the rice genbank nr protein collection  over more than half of their length . among the  <dig> sequences that did not show similarity to any wheat est or rice protein sequences,  <dig> showed high similarity to sequences from insects , fungi , bacteria , and viruses  . these sequences were considered contaminants and were excluded from further analysis, reducing the number of contigs included in this study to  <dig> . fifty percent of the nucleotides were incorporated into contigs of  <dig>  nucleotides or longer . a total of  <dig>  contigs  were longer than  <dig>  nucleotides . the average coverage was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  reads per contig ± sd.

the  <dig>  contigs were further grouped into  <dig>  isogroups. isogroups are defined in the gs assembler as a collection of contigs containing reads that imply connections between them, and are expected to include alternative splicing variants as well as homoeologs  and close paralogs. the majority of isogroups were comprised of only  <dig> contig . the median length of the sequences forming each isogroup was  <dig> nucleotides. the identifiers of the assembled sequences, the corresponding isogroups and genbank accession numbers are listed in additional file  <dig> 

gene expression profiling by mrna-seq
alignment of illumina reads to  <dig> contigs
to determine the differences in transcript levels of the different isogroups between the wt and gpc-rnai plants at  <dig> daa we used the illumina platform that provided a much greater average sequencing depth per library than the  <dig> platform . a summary of raw and trimmed illumina reads is provided in additional file  <dig> table s <dig> 

as a quality control, reads were aligned to the  <dig> -nt rice waxy-a intron, a sequence present in the pmcg <dig> rnai vector but absent in the wheat genome. on average,  <dig> reads mapped to the waxy-a intron for the four gpc-rnai samples, with no gaps and no mismatches allowed using bowtie  <cit> . as expected, zero reads were mapped to the vector sequence in the sequences obtained from wild type samples wt <dig>  wt <dig> and wt <dig>  however,  <dig> reads aligned to the waxy-a intron among the sequences generated from the illumina library from sample wt <dig>  indicating that the wt <dig> library was contaminated with rna from the transgenic gpc-rnai plants. therefore, this sample was removed from further analyses.

after trimming low quality regions and vector contaminants and excluding low quality reads , a final set of  <dig> million reads with an average length of  <dig> nucleotides was obtained from the seven samples. these reads were mapped onto the  <dig>  contigs  to determine their relative transcript levels . of the  <dig> million high-quality illumina reads,  <dig> million  mapped onto  <dig>  contigs  corresponding to an average coverage of  <dig> ×  coverage per library . of the  <dig> million reads  which did not align to the  <dig> contigs,  <dig> million  and  <dig> million  mapped onto  <dig>  singletons and  <dig>  wheat unigenes , respectively. taken together, the illumina reads aligned to contigs, singletons and unigenes, account for  <dig> % of the total illumina reads. the failure to align the  <dig> % residual reads to any of the three references sets described above could be explained by  the absence of these wheat sequences in all three references,  a higher sequence divergence between reads and reference than the similarity cut-off ,  contamination of transcripts from other organisms, or a combination of these three factors.

this study focuses on the comparison between wt and gpc-rnai transcript levels at  <dig> daa for the  <dig>  isogroups assembled with 454-sequencing. reads mapped to contigs within the same isogroup were summed to obtain the counts per isogroup. tables including differentially expressed singletons and wheat unigenes are included as supporting online materials for those interested in an expanded dataset of differentially regulated genes .

since the total number of reads obtained for the different biological replicates were not identical, counts were normalized to minimize the effect of this systematic technical variation. we used the normalization procedure implemented in the r/bioconductor software package deseq that uses the library median of the ratios between the read count and the geometric mean of each gene as a scaling factor for each library . all the statistical analyses described below use the normalized data sets.

global characterization of illumina counts
we observed a high pearson's product moment correlation coefficient between normalized counts of illumina and  <dig> sequences . figure 2a suggests that this correlation is even better for genes with high illumina counts. these significant correlations indicate that, overall, similar results were obtained with both technologies. however, the low average counts per isogroup in the  <dig> data set  relative to the illumina data set  resulted in much higher coefficient of variations in the  <dig> data set  than in the illumina data set . therefore, we used only the illumina sequencing counts to estimate gene expression levels.

to determine if the down-regulation of the gpc gene in the transgenic plants resulted in large changes in the transcriptome, we performed a hierarchical clustering of the seven samples using euclidean distance as a measure of similarity between expression profiles. as required for distance calculations, normalized values were further transformed to achieve homoscedasticity using the function 'getvariancestabilizeddata' in the deseq package  <cit> . biological replicates were separated into two major clusters, one including the four gpc-rnai samples and the other including the three wild type plants . the same grouping was observed when the counts of reads mapping onto singletons and wheat unigenes were analyzed separately indicating a consistent biological signal across these three independent data sets . principal component analysis  confirmed the hierarchical clustering results : the primary principal component  accounted for most of the variation  and clearly separated the replicates from the two different genotypes, which suggests that a large proportion of the variation in this dataset is associated with the differential expression of multiple genes in the two genotypes.

identification of differentially expressed genes
to identify genes differentially expressed between gpc-rnai and wt plants we used a conservative approach. we first identified isogroups that showed significant differences in normalized counts between treatments in both deseq  <cit>  and edger statistical analyses  <cit> .

the p-values generated by both analyses were adjusted for false discovery rates  across the multiple tests by using the procedure of benjamini and hochbergh as implemented in the r/stats package  <cit> . hereafter, the deseq and edger p values refer to the adjusted p values. using this criteria, a total of  <dig>  isogroups showed significantly higher transcript counts in the wt relative to the gpc-rnai samples  and  <dig>  showed significantly lower transcript counts in the wt relative to the gpc-rnai samples  simultaneously in both statistical analyses . sixty percent of the  <dig> differentially regulated isogroups showed more than two-fold differential expression. gene expression data points in relation to their statistical significance are presented as volcano plots in figure 2c, which shows an excess of significantly down-regulated genes  over significantly up-regulated genes .

to further validate the differences between wt and gpc-rnai samples, we repeated the same statistical analyses between groups including permutations of the samples. ten different permutations resulting in two gpc-rnai and two wt samples in one group and two gpc-rnai and one wt sample in the other  were analyzed and averaged. the edger and deseq tests of  <dig> different permutations showed  <dig> ±  <dig> and  <dig> ±  <dig> significant isogroups ± se per permutation , respectively. if we consider only the intersection between the two tests,  <dig> ±  <dig> isogroups on average were identified as significantly differentially regulated. these permutation analyses also provided an indirect estimate of the type i error rate in our experimental approach. the  <dig> isogroups showing statistically significant differences represent  <dig> % of the  <dig> genes that showed significant differences between the gpc-rnai and wt samples. this proportion of false positives is 80% higher than the theoretical 1% fdr used in our analyses .

the higher than expected rate of type i error suggested by the permutation analysis prompted us to incorporate an additional statistical filter to reduce the number of potential false positives and narrow down the set of genes for further characterization. we incorporated an additional mann-whitney-wilcoxon  test between wt and gpc-rnai , which reduced the number of isogroups with significant differences between treatments from  <dig>  to  <dig> . we are conscious that this conservative approach increases the number of real differentially regulated isogroups excluded from further analyses , and for this reason we are including both datasets in additional file  <dig>  and additional file  <dig> .

validation of differences in gene expression by qrt-pcr
qrt-pcr was used to validate the differential expression of  <dig> isogroups that showed ≥ <dig> fold significant differences in transcript counts between treatments in all three statistical analyses . from the  <dig> isogroups fulfilling all four criteria we selected  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes for further validation. these included isogroups covering a range of different expression ratios between genotypes and genes which were of biological interest to our group, including transporters, signaling components and hormone-related genes . we selected actin  as an endogenous control gene for gene expression analysis, since this gene has been used successfully in previous studies of senescing leaves  <cit> . both illumina and  <dig> data confirmed that the expression of actin, corresponding to isogroup  <dig> in our dataset, is not affected by the expression of the gpc-rnai construct  at this time point. all qrt-pcr data were normalized against the expression of actin using the 2-ΔΔct method  <cit> .

the transcription ratios between transgenic and wild type samples obtained by qrt-pcr were significantly correlated with the corresponding ratios as determined by normalized illumina counts . despite this overall high correlation, only  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes tested  showed significant differences  between transgenic and wild type plants when measured by qrt-pcr .

a ratios presented as expression in wt/expression gpc-rnai determined by illumina counts and qrt-pcr. ratios higher than one indicate genes up-regulated by senescence and ratios lower than one genes down-regulated by senescence. b isogroups with less than  <dig>  fold changes.

the high inter-planta variability of the qrt-pcr results may explain, in part, the relatively low rate of validation. the linearized transcript levels of the  <dig> selected genes showed relatively large coefficients of variation  among plants for both genotypes, with significant variation among genes: the 95% confidence interval for cv was between 38% to 50%. considering these cv values and a type i error of 5%, the power to detect 2-fold differences between two groups using ten replicates varies from 75%  to 95% . the low power exhibited by the statistical tests performed for several genes may have contributed to the low proportion of genes that showed significant differences in the qrt-pcr validation analyses. in support of this argument, none of the  <dig> isogroups with differences between  <dig> and  <dig>  fold were significant in the qrt-pcr analyses . if we include only the  <dig> genes with fold changes higher than  <dig>   in the analysis, the rate of validation increases from 41% to 64% . in addition, two of the thirteen non-significant genes in the qrt-pcr analysis performed on samples collected  <dig> daa were significant in a second set of samples collected  <dig> daa. the larger relative reduction in gpc transcript levels at  <dig> daa  compared to  <dig> daa  may explain the increase in significance for some of the selected genes .

taken together, results from our qrt-pcr experiments show a high correlation between qrt-pcr and illumina results, with a good validation rate among genes that showed differences between the two genotypes larger than  <dig>  fold at  <dig> and  <dig> daa.

analysis of gpc-regulated genes across an early senescing time course
all  <dig> isogroups which showed significant differences  in transcript levels by qrt-pcr at either  <dig> daa or  <dig> daa in our initial analyses were selected for an independent, more detailed expression analysis including four time points from heading to  <dig> daa.

data from six genes, three up-regulated and three down-regulated are presented in figure  <dig>  the three up-regulated genes include; isogroup  <dig> with homology to a jacalin-like lectin domain-containing gene , isogroup  <dig> with homology to an aba induced protein  and isogroup  <dig> with homology to members of the mtn <dig> nodulin family . all three genes showed a gradual increase in the difference in transcript levels between wt and gpc-rnai during the progression of senescence, paralleling the transcription profiles of the gpc gene . transcript levels of isogroups  <dig> and  <dig> are almost undetectable at heading date, whereas isogroup  <dig> is highly expressed at heading and only after anthesis displays differential regulation between the two genotypes . the significance of the differences in transcript levels between wt and gpc-rnai increased between  <dig> and  <dig> daa for all three up-regulated isogroups .

the three down-regulated genes shown in figure  <dig> include isogroup  <dig> which exhibits high homology to nac <dig>  a rice gene related to the gpc gene , isogroup  <dig> with homology to a chaperone protein , and isogroup  <dig> with homology to an lrr disease resistance gene . all three genes show similar expression profiles with an approximate four-fold decrease in expression between heading date and  <dig> daa. however, transcript levels in wt plants were reduced to basal levels faster than the gpc-rnai plants resulting in significantly lower transcript levels in wt than in gpc-rnai plants at  <dig> daa  for all three genes. these differences disappeared at  <dig> daa, when both genotypes reached a common low transcript level. the remaining five isogroups showing significant  differential regulation at either  <dig> daa or  <dig> daa were also tested across a senescing time course in an independent experiment and the data is available as a supplemental online material .

gene ontology annotation
to obtain a broad classification of gene functions, go-slim annotation was assigned based on the go-slim terms associated with the homologous rice genes  <cit> . homology searches using blastx  and the predicted rice peptides as a database showed significant similarities for 78% of the  <dig>  wheat isogroups. among the  <dig> isogroups significantly up- and down-regulated  <dig> daa , significant matches to known rice proteins were found in a larger proportion among the down-regulated genes  than among the up-regulated genes . similarly, go-slim terms for biological process associated with the homologous rice genes  were assigned to only  <dig> % of the  <dig> up-regulated genes, in contrast to  <dig> % of the  <dig> down-regulated isogroups. putative rice homologs and assigned go numbers for molecular functions and biological processes are listed in additional file  <dig> and a summary of the relative distribution of the go-slim categories for the most represented functional terms is presented in table  <dig> 

values are % of the total number of go-annotated isogroups.

asignificantly different between genotypes .

we observed significant differences in the relative distributions of the functional groups between up- and down-regulated genes  and we also observed a significant change in distribution of functional groups of up-regulated genes compared to the distribution of classes of all annotated isogroups , which indicates an enrichment of specific functional classes as the transcript levels of the gpc gene increase during senescence. in agreement with the accelerated senescence and augmented translocation of minerals observed in the presence of wild type gpc expression, we observed an enrichment in the percentages of genes involved in transport , protein metabolism  and catabolic processes , and a reduction in the percentages of genes involved in biosynthetic process  and cellular component organization and biogenesis  among the up-regulated isogroups.

transposable elements
similarity searches were also carried out against the trep database to identify transcribed transposable elements . a total of  <dig> isogroups  and  <dig>  singletons  showed significant similarity to transposable elements . the distribution of different superfamilies of transposable element in our dataset is similar to that observed in the entire wheat est database and in wheat genomic dna  <cit> , with gypsy and mariner as the most abundant class i and class ii elements, respectively. among the expressed elements,  <dig> isogroups and  <dig> singletons were differentially regulated in the two genotypes at both edger and deseq tests . in both datasets, the number of repetitive elements up-regulated during senescence  largely exceeded the number of repetitive elements down -regulated during senescence . these proportions were significantly different from a random 50% distribution .

these results support the hypothesis that some transposable elements are activated, potentially through the deactivation of silencing mechanisms  <cit>  during senescence as observed under conditions of biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . differences were detected in the distribution of different classes of retroelements between the complete data set and the subset of elements up-regulated during senescence, both for the isogroup  and the singleton set . the up-regulated repetitive elements displayed enrichment of gypsy elements in the isogroup set and of mariner elements in the singleton set.

discussion
monocarpic senescence is characterized by a developmentally regulated set of physiological changes encompassing extensive alterations in gene expression  <cit> . these changes are intrinsically linked with the remobilization of nutrients and carbohydrates from the leaves to the grains, as shown by the simultaneous alteration of senescence and remobilization in isogenic lines with different dosages of active gpc genes or in transgenic rnai plants with different gpc transcript levels  <cit> .

global analysis of gene expression during early senescence
based on the early up-regulation of gpc after anthesis and the delayed senescence of the gpc-rnai plants  <cit> , we hypothesized that this transcription factor is an early regulator of monocarpic senescence. to test this hypothesis, we selected an early time point after anthesis when there are no visible phenotypic differences between wt and gpc-rnai plants , but when the gpc transcript levels are significantly different between wt and gpc-rnai . the 35% reduction in gpc transcript levels observed  <dig> days after anthesis in the transgenic plants relative to the wt  was associated with large-scale differential gene expression affecting roughly  <dig> % of the isogroups included in this study . most of these differences disappear when the same analyses were made between reshuffled groups including mixtures of wild type and gpc-rnai samples, confirming the existence of real biological differences. the fact that the differences in gpc transcript levels affect a large number of genes was also reflected in the cluster and principal component analyses of isogroups , singletons and unigenes . in all the analyses the transcriptomes were divided into two major groups defined by the gpc genotype.

since the down-regulation of the gpc genes has multiple pleiotropic effects on senescence and nutrient remobilization  <cit>  and affects the overall timing of the senescence process, it is possible that many of the genes differentially regulated in the transgenic plants would also be differentially regulated between different time points of the senescence process in wild type plants. however, we currently do not know if the genes affected by the rnai down-regulation of the gpc genes include the complete set of genes differentially regulated during senescence or just a subset of them. this will depend on how early the gpc gene is located within the hierarchy of transcription factors that coordinate the senescence response and on the presence of feedback regulatory loops initiated downstream of gpc and that activate earlier regulatory steps.

expression analysis of six selected candidates across an early senescing time course  suggests that the selected time point for the mrnaseq analysis  provided a good snapshot of the transcriptional changes associated with the down-regulation of the gpc gene. at  <dig> daa, none of the six genes analyzed by qrt-pcr in figure  <dig> showed significant differences in transcript levels. conversely, transcript level differences at  <dig> daa were larger in all three up-regulated genes, but not significant for all three down-regulated genes since their expression levels in both wt and gpc-rnai samples had been reduced to similar lower levels compared to heading date by this time point . among the three additional down-regulated genes presented in additional file  <dig> figure s <dig>  isogroup  <dig> also showed larger differences at  <dig> daa compared with  <dig> daa, but both differences were significant. thus, an analysis limited to the  <dig> daa might have resulted in an underestimation of the number of down-regulated genes. in addition, as senescence progresses, the initial regulatory effects of the gpc gene are likely to be expanded by other transcription factors which are induced at this and later time points, thus complicating our analysis.

previous microarray-based approaches have provided an initial picture of the transcriptome changes during senescence. however, most of these studies were carried out in dicot species  <cit> , and only a few such studies have been performed in temperate cereals  <cit> . these studies resulted in the identification of hundreds of genes which are activated as senescence progresses, including those with putative roles in metabolism and translocation  <cit> . however, the use of microarrays can be limiting, particularly when analyzing a relatively sparsely studied stage of development such as senescence.

de novo transcriptome assembly
unlike microarrays, which are limited to the genes printed on the chips, mrna-seq represents an open platform that is capable of detecting novel transcripts, provided that they are expressed at levels compatible with the sequencing depth. this advantage of the mrna-seq approach is particularly valuable considering the limited current sequence information of wheat genes expressed during senescence and the lack of an assembled wheat genome. of the  <dig> , <dig> wheat ests present in genbank at the time of this analysis, none are derived from flag leaves collected after anthesis and there are only two annotated wheat sags present in the leaf senescence database, one being the gpc gene itself  <cit> .

about 5% of the genes assembled from the  <dig> sequence   were not found in the ncbi wheat est collection , suggesting that the effort to generate a de novo transcriptome assembly provided novel information. it is possible that a larger proportion of novel genes can be identified from later stages of the senescence process. the limited genomic information available for senesce genes is also reflected by the small proportion of up-regulated transcripts  that we were able to annotate using go slim  when compared to the proportion of the annotated down-regulated transcripts .

a high proportion of reads from the  <dig> sequencing runs  were assembled into contigs with a high n <dig> and an average contig length of  <dig>  bp, which is longer than those reported before, which range from  <dig> bp  <cit>  to  <dig> bp  <cit> . the accuracy of the sequencing and assembly was confirmed by blast similarity searches, both in terms of identity and alignment length. the assembled transcripts are publically available through the tsa division of genbank, and the singletons as a multi-fasta file in the som .

the assembly of the transcriptome of a polyploid species such as wheat poses additional problems that are not encountered in diploid species. homeologous transcripts of the three wheat genomes are approximately 97% identical  <cit>  and, under the assembly parameters used in this study, are usually merged into chimeric contigs. therefore, when mapping reads to the contigs it is important to adjust the number of mismatches to tolerate the average differences generated by genome divergences. in our case, we mapped reads with up to  <dig> nucleotide differences in  <dig> bp average reads, which will result in the inclusion of reads with more than 94% identity. some of the unmapped reads may represent reads that are more divergent than the genome present in the isogroup used as reference. the objective of this study was the identification of differentially regulated genes, and therefore the collapse of the three wheat homeologs into single contigs was a conscious decision. future studies aiming to characterize transcript levels of specific homoeologs will require a much higher coverage and higher stringency to assemble contigs for the different homoeologous groups.

based on the observed ct values from qrt-pcr experiments, the assembled transcriptome includes genes with transcript levels as low as 1/ <dig> of actin transcript levels . even though we obtained 12- <dig> million reads per sample, ~38% of the illumina reads were not mapped to the  <dig>  isogroups. approximately half of those unmapped reads were subsequently mapped to the singleton set  or to the wheat genbank unigene set , confirming that our  <dig> contigs represent a transcriptome limited to genes expressed at relatively high levels. the average number of counts mapped onto the singletons was one order of magnitude lower than those mapped onto the assembled contigs . this result suggests that, on average, the transcript levels of the genes included in the singleton dataset are lower than those included in the assembled contigs. the residual unmapped reads may correspond to genes missing from all three reference wheat datasets, that have more than three polymorphisms with the reference sequence , or that correspond to foreign dna contamination and/or sequencing errors  <cit> .

a blastx comparison of our dataset of  <dig> differentially regulated genes with the leaf senescence database  <cit>  showed significant similarities  for  <dig> genes . this result suggests that the differentially expressed genes present in our dataset include both a core of known sags as well as a large set of previously uncharacterized sags. however, one additional reason why similarities might not have been detected is that almost 90% of the sequences deposited in the leaf senescence database are from dicotyledonous species. only 9% of the sequences are from rice and 1% from other grasses  <cit> , http://www.eplantsenescence.org/ as of april 20th 2011). therefore, our dataset expands considerably the number of genes with potential roles in regulating senescence in the monocots. we hope that these datasets will become useful tools for research projects investigating monocarpic senescence of cereals.

gene expression profiling by sequencing
a comparison of the number of illumina reads mapping to a particular gene in wild type and gpc-rnai transgenic samples is a good indicator of its relative transcript levels  <cit> . the validity of this approach was confirmed by a high correlations between normalized illumina counts and both  <dig> and  qrt-pcr data , and by the separation of the transcriptomes of gpc-rnai and wt plants into the same two different clusters when contigs, singletons and unigenes were analyzed separately . from our results it is evident that expression level and sequencing coverage are both important determinants of the precision of the gene expression measurement since the variation in read counts between libraries is reduced as read count increases .  <dig> data displayed a low coverage, with small counts particularly for genes with low transcript levels and a large variation between replicates. in contrast, the precision provided by the high coverage of illumina sequencing resulted in sufficient sensitivity to detect significant differences  for changes in gene expression as low as 50%. genes with low expression levels are generally difficult to measure accurately, resulting in low validation rates across platforms  <cit> .

the illumina and qrt-pcr platforms have different strengths and weaknesses. qrt-pcr provides the sensitivity to detect genes at very low expression levels, which would require extremely deep illumina sequencing, but has limited power to detect differences lower than 2-fold, unless a large number of biological replicates are used . in contrast, illumina sequencing has the power to detect small differences in expression but lacks the sensitivity to detect genes with very low transcript levels . the relatively low power of qrt-pcr to detect differences close to 2-fold  is reflected in the improved proportion of significant differences in the qrt-pcr test observed when the comparisons were limited to genes with more than  <dig>  fold differences in transcript levels . however, the high correlation between qrt-pcr and illumina transcript level ratios between genotypes  suggests that there are significant similarities between the two datasets.

the time and cost of validating genes individually by qrt-pcr, together with its relatively low power compared with new mrna-seq technologies, will probably result in the gradual replacement of qrt-pcr as the golden standard for validation of global expression studies. we envision next-generation mrna-sequencing analyses of transcriptomes in independent experiments using different genetic stocks as a more efficient strategy to validate hundreds of differentially regulated genes simultaneously. as next generation sequencing approaches become increasingly affordable and technologies and data analysis tools mature, replicated mrna-seq experiments will likely become a common validation strategy.

biological significance of gpc-regulated genes
the list of putative gpc-regulated genes generated in this study provides a valuable entry point to dissect the pathways regulating senescence and nutrient translocation in wheat. however, the lack of functional information for a large fraction of the differentially regulated transcripts limited our ability to perform a more comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of the biochemical and signaling pathways differentially regulated during senescence. because of this limitation, the following discussion focuses on the variation in the relative proportions of several functional categories, and on a more detailed study of several genes that represent examples of up-regulated and down-regulated genes within different functional categories.

down-regulated isogroups comprise 70% of all differentially regulated genes  and are likely to include genes coding for processes no longer required during this final stage of the plant's development. within our dataset, this is evident in the large-scale down-regulation of signaling components , including wall-associated kinases  of which several members are down-regulated  by gpc . in addition, gpc may play an active role in shutting down photosynthetic processes during the early stages of senescence as suggested by the down-regulation of several genes encoding components of the photosynthetic machinery in the wt samples  relative to the gpc-rnai. the down-regulated genes include those encoding the small subunit of rubisco  and at least eight putative genes encoding chlorophyll a/b binding , a well-characterized gene closely associated with the onset of senescence  additional file 3;  <cit> ). the finding that a nac transcription factor is also significantly down-regulated as gpc expression increases  shows that the differential transcriptional regulation of different members of the nac family may play diverse roles as the plant transitions into senescence.

in contrast, genes which are up-regulated during senescence are likely to include those playing an active role in driving the onset of senescence and activating the transport networks required for the remobilization of nutrients to the grain and are thus of greater biological interest to enhance grain nutritional value. among the genes most highly up-regulated in this study is a gene encoding a ja-induced jacalin-like lectin domain protein . transcript levels of this gene are almost undetectable at  <dig> daa and it is only as gpc expression increases, that its expression is induced. differences in this gene's transcript levels between wt and gpc-rnai plants increased from  <dig> to  <dig> daa  paralleling the results observed for the gpc transcripts . jasmonic acid has been shown to induce leaf senescence in arabidopsis  <cit>  and several ja biosynthetic genes are up-regulated during senescence  <cit> . ja-responsive sags have been identified in independent microarray studies  <cit>  including several genes in the jacalin lectin gene family. the strong up-regulation of this gene by gpc in addition to a significantly up-regulated ja-inducible protein  suggests that ja may play an important role in the onset of senescence in wheat.

the hormone aba also plays a well-documented role in the induction of senescence in other plant species  <cit> . our finding that a putative aba inducible protein is among the most highly up-regulated genes  shows that genes induced by this hormone may also be involved in the induction and progression of senescence in wheat. as with other up-regulated genes, transcript levels increase at  <dig> daa and onwards in accordance with increasing gpc expression. a closer functional study of these wheat genes has the potential to provide new insights into the roles played by ja and aba during monocarpic senescence and on their interactions with the gpc genes.

the increase in gpc expression is also associated with an increase in the translocation rate and more efficient remobilization of several important micronutrients to the developing grain  <cit> . since a large proportion of the nutrients found in the grain arise from the dismantling of leaf-cell components during senescence  <cit> , one possible explanation for the improved remobilization is a more rapid and complete breakdown of complex leaf molecules resulting in an overall increase in the concentration of simpler molecules ready to be transported. in agreement with this, our gene ontology annotation revealed an enrichment of genes involved in protein metabolism and in catalytic processes among those significantly up-regulated .

studies using steam girdling to induce senescence in barley leaves have indicated a prominent role for proteases in regulating this cellular breakdown, particularly those of the cysteine protease class  <cit> . a tblastn search  using all characterised barley proteases against our isogroup, singleton and unigene sets yielded  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> wheat proteases, respectively . among these  <dig> proteases only seven with homologs in the unigene assembly  showed significant up-regulation in the wt relative to the gpc-rnai samples . one possible explanation for the relatively limited up-regulation of proteases in our dataset could be the differences in experimental approaches . alternatively, it is possible that gpc plays a limited role in the up-regulation of proteases and that, at  <dig> daa, the genes coding for other proteases are not yet differentially regulated. since visible signs of senescence in the leaves are still absent even at  <dig> daa , the cellular degradation and metabolism mediated by proteases may simply be occurring at a later stage of senescence and thus beyond our detection.

an obvious way to increase nutrient remobilization is to increase the expression or activity of transporter genes responsible for the transport of nutrients to the grain. for example, over-expression of a gene encoding a member of the zip transporters in barley resulted in increased levels of zinc in the developing grain  <cit> . within our transcriptome data, there are a greater proportion of genes with transporter activity among those up-regulated by gpc than among those down-regulated by gpc or not affected by gpc . the up-regulated transporters include one member of the nramp family  and one from the zip gene family . nramp proteins have been shown in plants to act as multiple divalent metal cation transporters, accepting ions including iron  <cit> , aluminium  <cit>  and cadmium  <cit> . in plants, the zip family of transporters have been well-characterised as metal ion transporters and several members have been shown to be up-regulated during senescence  <cit> .

based upon rice annotation, several genes of the nodulin family are significantly up-regulated during wheat senescence. the most highly up-regulated member of this family is from the mtn <dig> nodulin class which is significantly up-regulated in the wt relative to the gpc-rnai at  <dig> daa, and which increases further at  <dig> daa . a close homolog in rice has been shown to interact with two cu transporters   <cit>  suggesting the possibility that the homologous genes identified in our screen may play a similar role in the remobilization of nutrients during senescence. additional experimentation will be necessary to elucidate the role of wheat nodulins during monocarpic senescence.

while the approach described in this study provides a starting list of differentially expressed genes to dissect the early stages of gpc-regulated senescence, we are currently unable to distinguish between those genes directly regulated by gpc and those which are regulated indirectly through intermediate genes. chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments complemented with in vitro identification of the gpc specific dna-binding sequences will be necessary to address this question  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the comprehensive overview provided by mrna-seq is well-suited to explore the complexity of the regulatory networks and metabolic and physiological events associated with monocarpic wheat senescence and nutrient remobilization. this study confirms the hypothesis that the gpc gene is an early regulator of a complex regulatory network that includes hundreds of genes affecting both monocarpic senescence and nutrient remobilization from the leaves to the grain. in addition, our study shows that the onset of monocarpic senescence is characterized by the down-regulation of a large number of genes, which are likely to be no longer necessary. although genes up-regulated during senescence represent a small proportion of the differentially regulated genes identified in this study, they will likely provide the most interesting targets to identify the active processes triggered during monocarpic senescence. these active processes are most likely required to guarantee an orderly disassembly of the contents of the leaf cell and the subsequent efficient remobilization of these nutrients to the developing grains.

the early time point of the senescence process selected in this study  proved to be very informative, but a more detailed study of the senescence time course will be required to better understand this dynamic process. in addition, the gpc-rnai transgenic plants showed a simultaneous down-regulation of the gpc- <dig> and gpc- <dig> genes making it impossible to differentiate the individual contributions of these paralogous genes. we have developed a set of tetraploid wheat gpc mutants  using tilling  with which we plan to carry out a more extensive characterization of the senescence time course using mrna sequencing. the same tetraploid tilling population  <cit>  can also be used to generate loss-of-function mutants for selected gpc up-regulated genes to determine their functions and to initiate a systematic dissection of the regulatory network controlling senescence in wheat. we have initiated the tilling of the ja-induced jacalin-like lectin domain protein as an initial step in the dissection of this complex regulatory network.
