BACKGROUND
in natural environments with diurnal and/or seasonal temperature changes, temperature is one of the main relevant environmental variables that microorganisms, including yeast species, have to deal with. temperature is also a key factor in some industrial processes involving microorganisms. low temperatures  are used in wine fermentations to enhance production and to retain flavor volatiles. in this way, white and “rosé” wines of greater aromatic complexity can be achieved  <cit> . yeast undergoes considerable stress during wine fermentation due to the high concentrations of sugars in grape must, which leads to high osmotic pressure at the beginning of the process. then as fermentation proceeds, ethanol accumulation, limiting nitrogen concentration, or even presence of so <dig>  imposes further pressure on wine yeast. therefore to these difficulties, which are inherent to the process, we should add a sub-optimal temperature for the primary fermentation agent. temperatures below its optimum range for growth, around 32°c  <cit> , affect both the yeast growth and fermentation rates, and give rise to not only a prolonged lag phase, but also to the production of stuck and sluggish fermentations  <cit> . low temperature has several effects on biochemical and physiological properties in yeast cells: poorly efficient protein translation; low fluidity membrane; changes in lipid composition; slow protein folding; stabilization of mrna secondary structures; reduced enzymatic activities . these problems can be avoided by providing better-adapted yeasts to ferment at low temperature. in past years, some attempts have been made to elucidate the response to cold in saccharomyces cerevisiae through a variety of high-throughput methodologies. some studies have analyzed the genome-wide transcriptional response of s. cerevisiae to low temperatures. these studies have focused mainly on cold shock  <cit> . schade et al.  <cit>  identified two distinct phases in the cold shock response: 1) an early cold response  occurring within the first 12 h after exposure to low temperature; 2) a late cold response  taking place beyond 12 h after exposure to low temperature. an ecr induces the genes implicated in rna and lipid metabolism, whereas the genes induced during an lcr encode mainly the proteins involved in protecting the cell against a variety of stresses. in fact, the lcr response is very similar to the general stress response mediated by the transcription factors msn2p/msn4p. however, the response type depends on the duration of exposure to stressful conditions. sudden exposure to environmental changes  is likely to trigger a rapid, highly dynamic stress response . prolonged exposure to nonlethal stimuli leads to acclimation; i.e., establishment of a physiological state in which regulatory mechanisms, like gene expression, fully adapt to suboptimal environmental conditions  <cit> . tai et al.  <cit>  compared their transcriptomic results obtained during cold acclimation in a steady-state chemostat culture with other previous genome-wide transcriptional studies of batch cultures at low temperature, and found major discrepancies among low-temperature transcriptome datasets. these authors partially explained these major differences by the cultivation method used in different transcriptome experiments. although batch cultures are well-suited to study low temperature adaptation dynamics, they are poorly adapted to study prolonged exposure to low temperature. in such cultures, the specific growth rate  is strongly affected by temperature, which makes it impossible to dissect temperature effects on transcription from specific growth rate effects. two recent chemostat studies  <cit>  also found that the growth rate itself has a strong effect on transcriptional activity. furthermore, chemostat cultures help to accurately control the specific growth rate, so the concentration of all the metabolites is constant over time, thus providing a good platform to study microbial physiology, proteome profiles and gene expression  <cit> .

other recent studies of our group analyzed the changes in the proteomic profile  <cit>  and in the metabolome  <cit>  due to low temperature. nine proteins were identified as representing the most significant changes in proteomic maps during the first 24 h of fermentation at low  and standard temperatures. these proteins were involved mainly in oxidative stress response and glucose and nitrogen metabolism. in the global metabolic comparison, the main differences in the s. cerevisiae strain growing at low temperature were metabolites related with lipid metabolism and redox homeostasis.

so far, none of these previous studies have tackled adaptation at low temperature using a global approach, which involves differences at the genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic levels of two commercial wine strains, selected on the basis of a significant divergent phenotype growing at low temperature. in the first stage of the work, these strains were selected from a collection of  <dig> commercial s. cerevisiae, which were grown at temperatures ranging from  <dig> to 45°c in both minimal media  and synthetic must . the fitness differences at low temperature of these selected strains were confirmed in a competition experiment during wine fermentation. in a second stage, the aim was to decipher the molecular basis underlying this divergent phenotype by analyzing the genomic, proteomic and transcriptomic differences between both strains at low temperature. the up-regulation of the genes of the sulfur assimilation pathway and glutathione biosynthesis suggested a crucial role in better performance at low temperature. the presence of some metabolites of these pathways, such as s-adenosilmethionine  and glutathione, counteracted the differences in growth rate at low temperature in both strains. generally, the proteomic and genomic changes observed in both strains also supported the importance of these metabolic pathways in adaptation at low temperature.

RESULTS
effect of temperature on wine yeast growth and selection of two strains with different growth behavior at low temperature
in order to select two strains with different growth behavior at low temperature, we tested growth capacity at different temperatures with a collection of commercial strains . figure  <dig> shows the global distribution of μmax for all  <dig> strains at different temperatures in sd and sm. this representation follows a normal  distribution in which the μmax values were lower and variance was wider in sm  than in sd . in addition, the higher temperature was, the wider variance became. for the temperatures assayed, the average optimum temperature of these strains can be settled at around 33°c for sd and somewhat lower for sm.figure  <dig>

 according to the temperature in two media: sd  and sm . bars represent the frequency of the individuals with an μmax value within the same range of variation. the superimposed bell-shaped line shows the growth data at different temperatures following a gaussian distribution. due to differences in the growth rate, different scales were used for μmax distribution in sd and sm.



similar conclusions were drawn from the boxplot representation of each individual strain if compared to the average μmax of the  <dig> strains within the whole temperature range assayed . dispersion in these boxplots was much greater for each strain growing in sm than in sd. this representation also revealed the general fitness of each strain in comparison to the average fitness of all the strains and temperatures.

considering the whole data set at different temperatures, a decision was made to take 28°c as the optimum reference temperature and 15°c as the reference temperature for cold. these temperatures showed the biggest differences between strains and media. the μmax values were used to select two strains with evident different growth behavior at low temperature, regardless of the growth medium, but with no significant differences at the optimum temperature. following these selection criteria, p <dig> and p <dig> were chosen as the candidate strains with good and bad growth behavior at low temperature, respectively . p <dig> showed the best growth performance at low temperature in sd and one of the best ranked in sm. conversely, p <dig> was ranked among the strains with a lower μmax value in both media. p <dig> corresponds to commercial strain lalvin®icvgre, which is recommended for temperature fermentations ranging from  <dig> to 30°c by the marketer.figure  <dig> 
selection of strains with a divergent phenotype at low temperature. strains p <dig>  and p <dig>  were selected on the basis of the μmax  in sd  and sm  at 15°c  and 28°c . due to differences in the growth rate, different scales were used for μmax distribution in sd and sm.



fermentation kinetics and competition analysis of the selected strains
in order to evaluate whether the higher μmax values growing in a miniaturized system correlated well with higher fitness during alcoholic fermentation, a competition experiment was performed under microvinification conditions between the “good” and “bad” strains at the low and optimum temperatures. in order to make monitoring competitive capacity during fermentation easier, a p <dig> reporter strain was constructed by deleting one copy of the open reading frame  of gene gal <dig> and replacing it with the deletion cassette gfp-kanmx <dig>  this system was based on the expression of the green fluorescent protein  under the control of the gal <dig> promoter, a gene which is absolutely repressed during wine fermentation and activated in the presence of galactose. the cells from the fermentation culture were incubated directly in ypgal to determine the percentage of fluorescent cells by flow cytometry. the sm fermentations were inoculated with either a pure culture of each strain or a mixture of both strains. in order to verify that the deletion of one copy of the gal <dig> gene did not affect the fitness of strain p <dig>  the fermentations inoculated with either the reporter p5-gfp strain or a mixture of the parental p <dig> and the reporter p5-gfp strains were also carried out. the kinetics of these fermentations was estimated by calculating the time needed to ferment 5% , 50%  and 100%  of sugars in sm . t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> approximately matched the beginning , middle  and end of fermentation, respectively. as expected, the replacement of gal <dig> gene with a gfp cassette did not modify the fermentation fitness of strain p <dig>  surprisingly, p5-gfp finished its fermentation a few hours earlier than its wild-type p <dig> . moreover, the percentage of each strain was kept at around 50% throughout the mixed fermentation  .table  <dig>

asignificant differences in relation to the control strain .



strain p <dig> underwent significant delays in all the low-temperature fermentation stages if compared to the p <dig> fermentations, whereas only the beginning of fermentation  was delayed at 28°c. it is noteworthy that the interaction of both strains in the mixed fermentation  significantly affected fermentation lengths at both temperatures, with long delays noted in the fermentation ends if compared to p <dig> fermenting as a pure culture. this result was even more surprising when the percentage of each strain was monitored during these mixed fermentations . strain p <dig> gradually took over the fermentation process at low temperature and obtained percentages of around 85% of the total population at the end of the process. conversely no strain dominated the fermentation process at 28°c, with populations of around 50% for each strain. the greater competition capacity of strain p <dig> at low temperature was also corroborated by repeating this experiment in sd medium .figure  <dig> 
population dynamics of a mixed culture between strains p <dig>  and p <dig>  growing in synthetic must . the percentage of each strain was determined by flow cytometry during fermentation  at 15°c  and 28°c .



transcriptomic analysis revealed a key role of the sulfur assimilation pathway in adaptation at low temperature
to compare the transcriptome of p <dig> and p <dig> grown at 15°c and 28°c with no interference by the different maximum specific growth rate at these two temperatures, these strains were grown in chemostat cultures at a fixed dilution rate of  <dig>  h- <dig> at both temperatures. this dilution rate corresponded to the μmax of the strain p <dig> growing at 15°c. this experimental design allowed us to compare the transcriptional differences due to temperature in each strain  and the differences between strains at the same temperature  . a list of genes differentially expressed when comparing temperatures and strains and the mips functional categories analysis of these genes is provided as supplementary files .figure  <dig>

the comparison made by temperatures revealed that strains p <dig> and p <dig> had  <dig> and  <dig> differentially regulated genes at low temperature, respectively . this temperature response was mainly strain-dependent because only  <dig> genes were commonly regulated in both strains . although these common genes showed a consistent up- or down-regulation in both strains, differences in the expression level were also observed in a simple view of the heat-map . as these genes should play a crucial role in adaptation at low temperature, clear differences in their activity can explain the different phenotypic behavior of both strains at low temperature. for instance, genes qdr <dig>  snz1and sno <dig> were much more markedly up-regulated by low temperature in p <dig> than in p <dig>  qdr <dig> is a plasma membrane transporter involved in the k+ homeostasis induced by nitrogen limitation  <cit> , whereas snz <dig> and sno <dig> are involved in pyridoxine metabolism, which is essential for sphingolipids biosynthesis, and are also up-regulated in response to nutrient starvation  <cit> . conversely, genes gpi <dig>  cyb <dig>  btn <dig> and dse <dig> were more strongly down-regulated in p <dig> than in p <dig>  gpi <dig> is involved in the synthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol , the most important anchor of plasma membrane proteins  <cit> . cyb <dig> is involved in the sterol and lipid biosynthesis pathways, and acts as an electron donor to support sterol c5- <dig> desaturation  <cit> . btn <dig> modulates arginine uptake  <cit>  and dse <dig> is involved in cell wall organization.

one interesting common trait in all the comparisons made of the transcriptional changes observed either by temperature or strains was the presence of functional categories “nitrogen, sulfur and selenium metabolism”, “sulfur metabolism” and “metabolism of methionine” in the genes up-regulated at low temperature . the genes included in these functional categories belong mainly to the sulfur assimilation pathway . this pathway incorporates extracellular sulfate into several key sulfur-containing compounds; i.e.; homocysteine, methionine, s-adenosylmethionine or glutathione  <cit> . however, clear differences were observed in the transcriptomic activation of this route in both strains. whereas most genes were overexpressed in strain p <dig>  very few were also up-regulated in p <dig> table  <dig>

the concentration of glycolytic and stress oxidative proteins increased at low temperature
a proteome analysis of the same samples used for the transcriptomic analysis was done to evaluate changes in proteins as a result of low temperature in each strain. as done previously, comparisons of 2d-page gels were made to detect temperature-dependent and strain-dependent protein changes. around  <dig> spots were detected on 2-d gels in both strains growing at 28°c . this number of detected spots increased to  <dig> and  <dig> for strains p <dig> and p <dig>  respectively, when cells were grown at low temperature. more interestingly, most of these detected proteins were matched on both 2-d gels but, between matched spots, very few showed statistically significant increases or decreases .table  <dig>

the concentration of seven proteins increased at low temperature in p <dig> ; five were involved in glycolysis and glucose fermentation , mainly belonging to the lower part of the glycolysis, the other two proteins were involved in oxidative stress . tsa1p is a physiologically important antioxidant protein that is useful as enzymic defense against sulfur-containing radicals  <cit> , thus providing protection against an oxidation system without thiol. ahp1p is a similar peroxiredoxin to tsa1p that forms a disulfide-linked homodimer upon oxidation, and in vivo requires the presence of a thioredoxin system to perform its antioxidant protective function. unlike tsa1p, which is specific for h2o <dig>  ahp1p is also specific for organic peroxides  <cit> . this latter protein shows one of the largest increases  at low temperature. regarding strain p <dig>  three of the proteins with increased levels were implicated in the lower part of glycolysis and glucose fermentation . other proteins with increased levels at low temperature were tef1p, a translational elongation factor and rpl31ap, a ribosomal 60s subunit protein, and both are implicated in translation. only eno2p showed significant changes in both strains, but in opposite directions. low temperature increased the concentrations in p <dig>  but lowered it in p <dig> 

when examining the protein changes in strain p <dig> if compared to p <dig> , ten proteins showed different concentrations at 15°c, seven of which were more abundant in strain p <dig>  among these proteins, enzymes of the lower part of glycolysis , proteins implicated in oxidative stress and protein folding  and proteins implicated in methionine/cysteine biosynthesis , were detected. the remaining proteins with lower concentrations in p <dig> when compared with p <dig> were tdh1p, which is induced during heat shock  <cit> , tdh3p  and met6p, involved in methionine biosynthesis. at the optimum temperature, only four proteins lowered statistically in p <dig> : ylr179cp , gre2p , tpi1p  and sah1p .table  <dig>

addition of sam and glutathione to sm suppressed growth differences at low temperature
as both transcriptomic and proteomic analyses indicated the importance of sulfur metabolism, sulfur amino acid and glutathione biosynthesis, we tested the impact that the addition of the key metabolites of these pathways  to sm had on wine strain growth . as a control, we also incorporated the lab strain by <dig>  addition of gsh and gssg significantly shortened the generation time  of p <dig> at low temperature, while addition of sam prolonged the gt by 2 h. quite surprisingly, the presence of the three sulfur-containing compounds dramatically shortened the gt of p <dig> at low temperature and obtained similar values to these of p <dig>  the behavior of the lab strain by <dig> was similar to p <dig> as it reduced gt from 17 h to around 8 h. regarding growth at 28°c, no statistically significant variations were noted in the gt of the three strains when grown in supplemented sm, which indicates a low temperature-dependent effect.figure  <dig>

strain p <dig> showed better oxidative stress recovery
the importance of glutathione metabolism and a higher concentration of some peroxiredoxins and thioredoxins at low temperature also suggest the influence of oxidative stress defense on the better fitness of strain p <dig>  to check this implication, both wine strains were incubated in pbs with different h2o <dig> concentrations for 1 h at 28°c. after this incubation, the oxidant agent was removed and cells were inoculated in sd and sm. additional file 10: figure s <dig> shows the growth curves at 28°c for each strain after incubation with different h2o <dig> concentrations in both media. increasing h2o <dig> concentrations affected mainly the lag phase, which was longer  the higher the oxidative agent concentration became. the longest lag phases were detected in the p <dig> growth curves, which revealed worse management or recovery after oxidative shock. regarding the viability of the strains after incubation at different h2o2concentrations, and before inoculation in sd or sm, no statistical differences were found between both strains and h2o <dig> concentrations .

whole-genome comparison of the two wine strains
the genomes of the two wine strains were sequenced and compared with that of reference strain s288c . based on the raw sequence data, we identified  <dig> and  <dig> mutations in strain p <dig> and strain p <dig>  respectively, in comparison to the reference strain. this number of snps represents approximately  <dig> % of the s. cerevisiae genome. when comparing the sequences between both wine strains, the number of snps lowered to  <dig> mutations, of which 90% gave homozygous changes. according to liti et al.  <cit> , wine yeasts belong to the same cluster, the wine/european lineage, while most lab strains, such as s288c, are mosaic strains between the wine/european cluster and the other four clean lineages. only 27% of the snps between both wine strains represented nonsynonymous changes in the coding region, which resulted in an amino acid change . as these nonsynonymous changes could potentially explain the phenotypic differences observed between both strains, we identified mutations in the genes of the sulfur assimilation pathway . many genes of this route presented snps which involved amino acid changes in the biosynthetic enzymes and, most importantly, in regulators of the pathway, such as met <dig> and met <dig>  however, conversely to the transcriptomic analysis, the determination of the functional categories with significant overrepresentation among the nonsynonymous snps did not include the go term “sulfur metabolism”, although the related “sulfate/sulfite transport” was included .table  <dig>

certain classes of variants, such as indels, are expected to have dramatic consequences on gene products and, therefore, constitute particularly interesting candidates for contributing to phenotypic variation . in all,  <dig> and  <dig> indels were found in p <dig> and p <dig>  respectively, compared with the reference strain . of the total number of indels,  <dig> were found in common between strains. when examining the distribution of the unique indels for each strain along the chromosomes, some  showed an enrichment of variants . only 12% of the unique indels for each strain were within the coding sequence. within orfs, the indels with lengths that were multiples of three were highly enriched when compared with the noncoding sequence, which is consistent with the strong purifying selection against frameshifts . those indels in the coding sequence with lengths that were not multiples of three were classified mainly as functionally uncharacterized. this demonstrates that this group of genes are, on average, under lower purifying selection pressure  <cit> . we also detected the larger copy number of genomic regions between both strains . seventy-two cnv were detected across the genome comparison made between both strains . most of these cnv were classified mainly as transposable elements and subtelomeric regions. these results are in line with previous observations  <cit> , which found very limited cnv in nonsubtelomeric regions and extensive variation in subtelomeric regions.

discussion
several works have shown the marked importance of temperature on the growth of wine yeasts  and the influence of this environmental factor on determining the natural distribution of wild species  <cit> . a direct effect of lowering temperature is to slow down the metabolic activity of yeast cells, which accounts for reduced growth and longer fermentation processes  <cit> . thus, unraveling the molecular and physiological mechanisms that allow better adaptation and growth at low temperature is interesting. in this study we followed a global approach by comparing transcriptomic, proteomic and genomic changes in two commercial wine strains, which were selected as having clear differences in their growth and fermentation capacity at low temperature. the selection of these strains was based on the maximum growth rate in a synthetic grape must  during miniaturized batch cultures at different temperatures. the fitness differences of the selected strains were corroborated by directly competing during fermentations at optimum and low temperature. these competition experiments highlighted the better competitiveness of p <dig> vs. p <dig> only at low temperature.

although wine fermentations are operated in the batch mode, the proteomic and transcriptomic changes between both strains were determined in the steady-state of continuous cultures at the same dilution rate. in batch cultures, the specific growth rate  is strongly affected by temperature. this means that it is impossible to dissect temperature effects on transcription and translation from specific growth rate effects  <cit> . recently, vázquez-lima et al.  <cit>  used chemostat cultures to mimic the different phases of a typical batch wine fermentation, and showed the potential of this experimental approach to systematically study the effect of environmental relevant factors such as temperature.

a global transcriptomic analysis has revealed key changes in the sulfur assimilation pathway at low temperature, with the up-regulation of key genes in both strains. this pathway incorporates extracellular sulfate into several key sulfur-containing compounds, including methionine, cysteine, homocysteine and s-adenosylmethionine   <cit> . the biosynthetic genes of this pathway are controlled by a complex regulatory system, whose main transcriptional activator is met4p. met4p is recruited to specific promoters by site-specific dna-binding transcription cofactors met31p, met32p and cbf1p  <cit> . the activity of this pathway has a widespread influence on other cellular pathways, some of which have a huge potential impact on adaptation at low temperature, such as in the phospholipid  biosynthesis pathway. changes in the phospholipid composition of cellular membranes as a response to low temperature have been widely reported  <cit> . phosphatidylcholine , the major phospholipid , is synthesized de novo from another pl, phosphatidylethanolamine , in three sam-consuming methyltransferase reactions catalyzed by opi3p and cho2p  <cit> . the enzymatic genes of this pathway are repressed by opi1p, a protein that directly senses the levels of phosphatidic acid , a precursor of pl biosynthesis. hickmann et al.  <cit>  reported coordinated regulation of the sulfur and phospholipid pathways with met4p activating the genes involved in producing sam and opi1p repressing some of these genes. this coordinated regulation between both transcription factors ensures that cells maintain the requirement of methylation during the biosynthesis of cell membrane phospholipids. thus we hypothesize that the higher demand of pc at low temperature  <cit>  increases the requirements of sam for this biosynthesis, requiring the activation of the entire sulfur metabolism pathway. the better fitness of strain p <dig> at low temperature is consistent with the global transcriptional up-regulation of enzymatic genes and some transcription factors in comparison to strain p <dig>  the greater transcriptional activation of this route in p <dig> also correlated with the presence of higher concentrations of some met proteins, such as met10p and met17p. however, p24’s inability to synthesize sam requirements at low temperature can be counterbalanced by the presence of this compound in the growth medium, which showed a similar growth rate to strain p <dig>  these data also support the higher internal demand of sam for growing at low temperature.

greater activation of the sulfur assimilation pathway may also have a huge impact on other metabolic processes, such as the synthesis of the molecules involved in oxidative stress response. thioredoxin and glutathione /glutaredoxin pathways are universal systems to maintain the redox homeostasis of the cell. the oxidized disulphide form of thioredoxin is reduced directly by nadph and thioredoxin reductase, whereas glutaredoxin is reduced by glutathione  using electrons donated by nadph . thus according to our data, the coordinated up-regulation of the genes involved in the sulfur and glutathione pathways may lead to higher intracellular concentrations of glutathione, whose protective effect may contribute to improve the fermentation process. in a recent transcriptomic comparison of four wine strains showing different fermentation performances, treu et al.  <cit>  correlated the induction of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of sulfur amino acids with the strains showing better fermentation performance. specifically, the higher expression of these genes, determined by the cooperation of tfs met32p and hap4p, contributed to more efficiently face stress induced by a high ethanol concentration and to improve strain fitness to starvation  <cit> , which resulted in better fermentation performance. not many reports have correlated low temperature and oxidative stress. zhan et al.  <cit>  reported increased transcript levels of antioxidant genes sod <dig>  ctt <dig> and gsh <dig> in a rapid downshift in the growth temperature of s. cerevisiae from 30°c to 10°c. likewise, a previous proteomic study of our group  <cit>  also detected an increase in cys3p during wine yeast adaptation to low-temperature fermentation. once again, the importance of glutathione biosynthesis in this cold adaptation is reinforced by growth data in the presence of both reduced  and oxidized glutathione  in the culture medium. the gt of both strains significantly lowered, especially in strain p <dig>  which showed similar values to p <dig>  however, incubation in the presence of h2o <dig> clearly proved that strain p <dig> is more prone to cope with this stress oxidative. once again, this is consistent with the up-regulation of practically all the enzymatic genes of both the sulfur and glutathione pathways, but also by the higher up-regulation of the key tfs of the route, such as met32p and met28p when compared with p <dig> 

once more, the proteomic comparison showed that strain p <dig> is better poised to deal with oxidative stress, as revealed by the higher concentration of peroxiredoxin ahp1p and thioredoxin tsa1p at low temperature. likewise, the higher concentration of the met proteins in strain p <dig> when compared to p <dig> also agreed with the transcriptomic data and reinforced the greater metabolic activity of the sulfur pathway in this strain. however, the transcriptomic and proteomic data did not always correlate directly. no mips category that was related to glycolysis and glucose fermentation was significant in the transcriptomic analysis, but the concentration of several proteins in this category changed at low temperature in both strains. most of these proteins represented the enzymes of the lower part of the pathway  and ethanol production. with a similar experimental set-up to this study, quirós et al.  <cit>  determined the distribution of metabolic fluxes during wine fermentations according to sugar concentration and temperature. in the upper part of glycolysis , the c flux directed to glycolysis lowered at low temperature, which resulted in a higher c flux to the pentose phosphate pathway  and carbohydrate biosynthesis. these authors related this diversion of the c flux to these two minor branches with the higher biomass synthesis also observed at low temperature. conversely in the lower part of glycolysis , the glycolytic flux was higher at low temperature, which resulted in a lower flux toward glycerol production. biomass production is very high atp-demanding. thus, this higher biomass synthesis at low temperature may result in a shortage of intracellular atp. the increase of glycolytic and fermentative enzymes leading to atp generation may balance this drain. the simultaneous overexpression of these enzymes enhanced the glycolytic flux and fermentative capacity of s. cerevisiae
 <cit> . in the comparison made of the strains, the extremely high concentration of tdh1p  in strain p <dig> at low temperature was striking. tdh1p catalyzed the reaction of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to  <dig>  bis-phosphoglycerate, such as tdh2p and tdh3p, in the first step of the trioses phosphate branch. however tdh2p and tdh3p were detected in exponentially growing cells, whereas tdh1p was detected primarily in the stationary phase  <cit> . it has therefore been suggested, but not confirmed, that tdh1p may be involved in a process other than glycolysis because it is synthesized by cells in the stationary phase  <cit> . likewise, the higher concentration of the proteins involved in translation machinery  can also be correlated with a greater impairment of translation in p <dig> at low temperature. a recent study done by our group  <cit>  showed that the better fitness of the cryophilic species s. kudriavzevii is given mainly by the enhanced translation efficiency of this species if compared to s. cerevisiae. this suggests that translational efficiency might be an important target of adaptation evolution when cells face changing environments.

human intervention has subjected wine yeasts to multiple rounds of independent domestication and thousands of generations of artificial selection, which has driven to a phylogenetic lineage denominated by liti et al.  <cit>  as the wine/european genetic clade. these authors also stated that despite a lineage formed by domesticated bred strains being expected to have lower phenotypic diversity, the wine/european lineage showed similar or higher levels of diversity if compared to other clean lineages  <cit> . our genomic data of the two wine strains confirm both concepts, phylogenetic proximity, but higher phenotypic diversity. they show a much smaller number of snps between them in comparison to reference lab strain s288c. however, despite a number of different snps representing less than  <dig> % of the total genome, these genotype changes resulted in a clear divergent phenotype. nonsynonymous changes in structural or regulatory genes can impact transcriptional regulation, mrna stability or protein activity. a large number of mutations were detected in the genes of the sulfur and glutathione metabolic pathways. the changes in tfs such as met <dig> and met <dig>  which regulate the sulfur assimilation pathway, were particularly relevant. hong et al.  <cit>  analyzed the mutations produced in strains evolved with improved galactose utilization and concluded that the phenotypic changes observed in these evolved strains were the result of mutations in regulatory systems, which produced the overexpression and activation of some metabolic routes. further work should be done in the future to evaluate whether these mutations cause the increase activity of this route.

CONCLUSIONS
the combination of a detailed phenotypic analysis, e.g., involving transcriptome and proteome analysis, with genome sequencing is a powerful strategy to provide a clear link between genomic and phenotypic differences. we firstly selected two strains with different fitnesses at a low, but not at an optimum, temperature. our data highlight the importance of the sulfur assimilation and glutathione pathways to explain the phenotypic differences between both strains. in order to distinguish which of the genetic differences seen in this study is responsible for difference in growth at cold temperatures, we are currently undertaking a new comparative genetic study based on the qtls analysis of a hybrid population generated by crossing these two strains, following the approach described by parts et al.  <cit> .
