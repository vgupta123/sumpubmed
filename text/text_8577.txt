BACKGROUND
the vertebrate retina contains seven major cell types, six neuronal and one glial. these cells are derived from multipotent retinal stem/progenitor cells. previous studies have revealed that the development of the vertebrate retina is a conserved process of cell genesis with the following order of cell birth: ganglion cells, horizontal cells, cone photoreceptors, amacrine cells, bipolar cells, rod photoreceptors, and m端ller glia. similar to other parts of the central nervous system, the retina contains a layered structure with photoreceptors  located in the outer nuclear layer , short projection neurons  and local circuit neurons  in the inner nuclear layer , and long projection neuron  in the ganglion cell layer   <cit> . during early stages of retinal development, the outer neuroblastic layer  consists almost entirely of mitotic progenitor cells, while newborn neurons  reside in the inner neuroblastic layer . the position of mitotic progenitors within the onbl varies depending upon their progress through the cell cycle, with s phase cells found on the vitreal side of the onbl near the border with the inbl and m-phase cells found on the scleral side of the onbl abutting the retinal pigment epithelium  <cit> .

an important aspect in understanding retinal anatomy and function is to trace the development of various cell types during embryonic stages. although significant progress has been made, a complete developmental process underlying retinal cell differentiation during embryonic development is still lacking. previous studies have provided information of retinal development on the rate of progression through the cell cycle  <cit> , the mode of cell divisions, e.g., symmetrical versus asymmetrical  <cit> , cell migration  <cit> , and the order of cell birth  <cit> . a cell is born when it withdraws from the cell cycle and undergoes differentiation. these studies are mainly based on dna synthesis analysis using tritiated-thymidine  or 5'-bromon-2'deoxy-uridine  labeling methods. 3h-tdr or brdu is incorporated into the genomic dna of stem/progenitor cells during the s-phase of cell cycle before they withdraw from the cell cycle and undergo differentiation. these methods are particularly useful in determining the start and end of cell genesis. in addition, using cell type-specific markers, the onset of differentiation can be determined by identifying the earliest time points for which immunolabeling is observed  <cit> . however, a major drawback to these methods is that dna replication occurs in the nuclei thus only the nuclei of the labeled cells are observed. in addition, many cell type-specific markers also label only the nuclei of cells. cell type-specific markers may be able to distinguish between cellular subtypes but fail to reveal the subtle morphological differences that determine key functional differences. furthermore, morphological changes were observed in previous studies of retinal degenerative diseases caused by mutation or loss of gene function  <cit> . thus, important morphological information of the whole cell that accompanies molecular changes is critical to understanding normal development and disease states.

here, we report studies aimed at revealing dynamic morphological and molecular changes in retinal cell development of the chick embryo. a plasmid dna that expresses green fluorescent protein  as a marker was directly delivered into the embryonic chick subretinal space and electric pulses were applied to facilitate dna uptake by retinal stem/progenitor cells using a rapid and convenient in ovo electroporation technique. with this technique, gfp-expressing plasmids were efficiently transfected into retinal stem/progenitor cells with little damage to the chick embryos. gfp expression has been found in all cell types of the developing chick retina and allowed for clear visualization of cell morphologies. immunohistochemistry was performed to further confirm retinal cell types with specific molecular markers. by tracking the cell counts of various cell types based on cellular morphology, laminar location, and molecular markers, the composition of various cell types of the developing retina at different stages has been determined. thus, this study provides more complete insight into both the morphological and molecular changes during chick embryonic retinal development.

RESULTS
the chick embryo has been the most advanced model organism suitable for experimental embryology and for studying the development of higher vertebrates  <cit> . in this report, the chick retina was used for the study of cellular morphological and molecular changes during embryonic development using in ovo electroporation and immunohistochemistry techniques. all results reported in this study were focused on the central portion of the developing chick retina.

onset and expression pattern of retinal cell type-specific markers
to determine the onset of the marker expression of various cell types in the embryonic chick retina, cell type-specific antibodies, e.g., visinin  <cit>  and xap- <dig>  <cit>  for photoreceptors; lim1+ <dig> for horizontal cells  <cit> , and brn3a for ganglion cells  <cit>  were used to stain retina sections harvested at various time points during retinal development from e <dig> to e <dig> . the development of the many retinal cell types could be tracked independently by observing the onset and dynamic changes in expression patterns of these cell type-specific markers as detected by immunofluorescence labeling.

the expression of a photoreceptor marker xap- <dig>  <cit>  was observed only in the outer segment of the outer nuclear layer , and its expression starts sometime between e <dig> and e <dig> . the intensity of xap- <dig> labeling continued to increase through e <dig> . the expression of another photoreceptor marker visinin, a retinal photoreceptor protein which is believed to be cone specific  <cit> , starts around e <dig>  which is much earlier than xap- <dig> expression. at e <dig>  its expression had increased in intensity but individual cells were still distinguishable . visinin labeling then increased in intensity and the labeled cells composed a significant portion of the onl at e <dig> . the intensity of visinin labeling continued to increase and peaked at about e <dig>  when it was expressed in the entire onl. in later stages , visinin labeling continued to remain strong in the outer segment but diminished in the inner segment of the onl. the differences in expression may suggest that xap- <dig> and visinin coincide with different stages of photoreceptor development. other photoreceptor specific antibodies against recoverin and xap- <dig> did not show immunoreactivity in any of the stages  of chicken retina tested .

the expression of a horizontal cell marker lim1+ <dig>  <cit>  started in the retinal neural epithelium around e <dig> . a few lim1+ <dig> positive cells were observed in the inner neuroblastic layer  where newborn neurons appear. at e <dig>  the majority of lim1+ <dig> positive cells are near the edge of inbl, while some are migrating through the inner nuclear layer  towards the outer portion of the inl where mature horizontal cells reside. migration of lim1+ <dig> positive cells continues through e <dig>  and nears completion by e <dig>  when cells begin to align as a single layer adjacent to the onl where synaptic endings of the photoreceptor cells located. by e <dig> , the majority of lim1+ <dig> positive cells align on the outer portion of the inl. the space between the lim1+ <dig> positive horizontal cells were almost evenly spaced. this pattern was observed in all the later stages during chick retinal development. the horizontal cells at e <dig>  appear to be more mature than previous stages with larger and more oval cell bodies and are better aligned to the outer most region of the inl.

the expression of a retinal ganglion cell marker brn3a  <cit>  was observed to start in the gcl around e <dig> . brn3a positive cells were organized into 3- <dig> cell layers in thickness by e <dig>  brn3a expression increased significantly in both intensity and in number of cells that expressed brn3a at e <dig> , and its expression was restricted to the gcl. this increasing trend of staining continued at e <dig>  when the majority of cells in the gcl were brn3a-positive. the borders of the inl, gcl, and the optic nerve fiber layer were clearly defined by brn3a expression. from e <dig>  to e <dig> , brn3a expression remained constant. the expression pattern of brn3a at e <dig>  was similar to that observed from e <dig> to e <dig> 

in addition, the expression pattern of neuronal specific markers, e.g., pax <dig> and neun, and a radial glial cell/progenitor cell marker, vimentin, were also examined . vimentin is an intermediate filament protein that is responsible for maintaining cell integrity  <cit>  and is used to label radial glial cell/progenitor cell and m端ller glia cells in the chicken retina  <cit> . m端ller glia cells span all the retinal layers, possess radially polarized processes, and have arborizations called "end-feet" toward the gcl  <cit> . vimentin positive cells were found in all stages tested  and were not seen to be specific to any cell layer. the vimentin positive cells showed distinct striated banding throughout all layers. immunoreactivity was usually most intense in the gcl, which is likely caused by the high concentration of processes in the end-feet of radial/m端ller glial cells. pax <dig> is a nuclear marker for ganglion, amacrine, and progenitor cells that is required for multipotency in retinal cells  <cit> . pax <dig> was first detected at e <dig> in a small number of progenitor cells located in the inbl . over the next few days, the overall number of cells detected increased and by e <dig>  included cells located in the inl. at e <dig> , ganglion cells, amacrine cells, and migrating cells are all clearly labeled by pax <dig>  by e <dig> , as found in previous reports, some horizontal cells are also labeled but labeling is weaker than that found in amacrine or ganglion cells  <cit> . neun is a neuron-specific nuclear protein marker  <cit> . the onset of immunoreactivity of this marker indicates terminal differentiation of the neuron. previously, use of neun antibodies in the mouse retina showed immunoreactivity in the gcl and to a much lesser extent in the inl  <cit> . in the chicken retina, neun labeling is seen in the inbl beginning at e <dig> , and in the inl at e <dig> . by e <dig> , the inl and gcl can be very easily distinguished by the neun expression pattern. the intensity of neun expression was more intense and widespread in the gcl than the inl at e <dig> . by e <dig> , the entire gcl and amacrine cell portion of the inl were labeled by neun.

morphological analysis of developing chick retina using in ovo electroporation technique
to reveal the dynamic morphological changes during retinal cell development, the in vivo electroporation method was adapted and optimized for chick retinal study   <cit> . although in ovo electroporation is a widely used technique for the study of neural development, the technique has been mainly performed in neural tube injection and electroporation. targeted retinal injection and in ovo electroporation at e3- <dig> is considered a novel method for the study of chick retinal development . the pcag-gfp dna was injected into the sub-retinal space of e3-e <dig> chicken embryo  followed by electroporation . the plasmid dna construct, pcag-gfp, was previously shown to produce ubiquitous gfp expression without altering normal development  <cit> . in ovo electroporation of pcag-gfp consistently resulted in the highest level of gfp expression in the central retina with decreasing gfp expression in more peripheral regions of the retina. few if any cells in the peripheral retina were observed to express gfp . immunohistochemistry revealed gfp expression in retinal stem/progenitor cells during early chick embryonic retinal development , and all six differentiated major cell types during late chick embryonic retinal development . visualization of cytoplasmic gfp expression revealed the cross section morphology of cell bodies and processes . the location of individual cells with respect to the retina layers was also clearly visible . the determination of a specific retinal cell type was based on the cellular morphology, laminar location, and expression of molecular markers of the cell.

by observing development between e <dig>  and e <dig> , the changes in laminar location were determined. during early development, the vast majority of cells are still proliferating and some have started their migration process . migratory cells have elongated cell bodies that can span both the onbl and inbl . once migratory cells reach their respective laminar locations , they terminally differentiate into specific mature cell types. differentiated cells  have cell type-specific morphologies and more defined axons and dendrites. at e <dig>  the characteristic morphologies and locations of all six major cell types found in a more developed retina were clearly seen through gfp labeling . visualization of gfp allows for the cell bodies as well as the processes  to be observed in great detail. photoreceptor cells  are localized exclusively in the onl and have elongated cell bodies like rods and cones that span the onl. their synaptic bodies are found along the boundary of the onl and the outer plexiform layer . horizontal cells  have oval cell bodies found in the region of the inl closest to the opl. their cell bodies align in a single cell layer with dendrites in the opl that reach towards the onl. ganglion cells  are located in the gcl, their cell bodies seem to be the largest in all cell types in the retina. their dendrites reach towards the inl and the inner plexiform layer . the size of their cell bodies and the number of dendrites can greatly vary depending on their subtype. morphologically distinct cells  were observed in the gcl at e <dig> . based on the laminar location of these observed cells and the known morphological diversity among ganglion cells, it is concluded that multiple subtypes of ganglion cells were able to be labeled by this technique. m端ller glial cells  are the principal glial cells of the retina. they form architectural support structures stretching radially across the thickness of the retina and are the limits of the retina at the outer and inner limiting membrane, respectively. they are also the least frequently found cell type in the retina accounting only about  <dig> % of the total cell population in the mature mouse retina  <cit> . their cell bodies sit in the inl and project thick and thin processes irregularly in either direction to the outer limiting membrane and the inner limiting membrane. bipolar cells  have their cell bodies in the inl and reach from the onl to the ganglion cell layer  but have only a single axon and dendrite in opposite directions. amacrine cells  have round cell bodies found in the inl and have a single axon that extends to the inner plexiform layer  where it then branches out to contact the cells in gcl  <cit> .

confirming retinal cell type of gfp-expressing cells by immunohistochemistry
to confirm that cell types were correctly identified by cellular morphology and laminar location and to determine composition of cell types of gfp-expressing cells, immunohistochemistry was performed on e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> retina sections with pcag-gfp transfection. the cell types were determined using the gfp images  and confirmed by overlaying the images with cell type specific antibody labeling . at e <dig>  a large number of gfp-expressing cells have immature cell morphology . however, each cell type has a defined laminar location with cell migration close to completion. the laminar location combined with the morphological characteristics  allowed for the cell types to be quite accurately determined. the identification of each retinal cell type at e <dig>  became even easier as the vast majority of cells have already completed migration, and their characteristic morphologies, such as axons and dendrites, were more clearly defined. gfp-expressing cells were stained with a cell type specific antibody, e.g., xap- <dig>  or visinin  for photoreceptors, lim1+ <dig>  for horizontal cells, pkc留  for bipolar cells, brn3a  for ganglion cells, and vimentin  for m端ller glial cells. for photoreceptor cells, immunolabeling showed that visinin and xap- <dig> staining was only found in onl where photoreceptor cells reside. the results of antibody labeling with gfp-expressing cells showed that cells in onl were positive with visinin and xap- <dig> staining. visinin and xap- <dig> labeled all photoreceptors in the onl beginning at e <dig>  xap- <dig> did not label the whole photoreceptor cell but as previously reported only the outer segment  <cit> . xap- <dig> has been shown to be expressed by photoreceptors exclusively under conditions in which the outer segment membranes are properly assembled  <cit> . the fact that xap- <dig> expression was observed in the outer most region of the outer nuclear layer  beginning at e <dig> and e <dig> may indicate that this outer most region stained by xap- <dig> is the developing outer segment of the onl. our results further indicate that development of the outer segment of the onl may start as early as e <dig>  each of the cells labeled with photoreceptor specific markers were correctly identified based on laminar location and cellular morphology . lim1+ <dig> staining was only found in the outer region of the inl. gfp-expressing cells in the outer border of the inl, with round cell bodies, showed lim1+ <dig> staining at each of the developmental stages. pkc留 has been shown to specifically label bipolar cells in the developing retina  <cit> . pkc留 labeling showed no staining at e <dig> . staining at e <dig>  showed labeled cells intermittently in the inl. staining became more frequent and more intense at e <dig>  in the inl where bipolar cells reside. double labeling was first observed at e <dig> and became more frequent at e <dig>  double labeled cells were only observed in the inl, showed round cell bodies, and characteristic processes were regularly observed at e <dig>  brn3a staining was exclusively localized in gcl where ganglion cells reside. a few gfp-expressing cells that showed ganglion cell-type specific characteristics were not labeled with brn3a . however, this finding does not exclude this cell from being a ganglion cell as brn3a was shown to label the majority of but not all ganglion cells  <cit> . labeling with vimentin showed striated banding throughout all layers for all the various stages. double labeling with gfp and vimentin was not observed at e <dig> but migrating cells expressing gfp seemed to follow vimentin labeled cells. double labeling was first seen at e <dig>  and only in the processes of the cell . at all three stages, individual whole cell bodies were resolved by gfp labeling, as opposed to only the outer segment , entire layers , or only the nuclei  as resolved using antibody labeling. the molecular identification of retinal cell types confirmed that the cell types of chick retina cells between e <dig> and e <dig> could be accurately determined based on cellular morphology and laminar location as revealed by gfp expression.

dynamic changes in the composition of gfp-expressing cell types during retinal development
to identify dynamic changes in the developing chicken retina, gfp-expressing cells were counted for each cell type from e <dig> to e <dig>  at least three retinas with gfp expression were generated for each time point. the cell type of the gfp-expressing cells was determined, categorized, and counted. the percentage of each cell type among the entire population of gfp-expressing cells  was calculated at each time point . cell types were determined based on their morphology, laminar location, and molecular marker. the cell counts showed a dramatic decrease in the number of migratory cells from e <dig> to e <dig> . this finding indicates that the number of migrating cells decreased steadily as fewer migratory cells were being generated and more migratory cells differentiated during this time frame. by e <dig>  the percentage of migratory cells was less than 1%, suggesting that cell migration almost reached completion. the largest increases in differentiated cell types occurred at e <dig> for photoreceptors, e <dig> for horizontal cells, and e <dig> for bipolar cells and amacrine cells. ganglion cells did not show significant changes during these time periods. morphologically mature m端ller glia cells were first seen around e <dig> but still remained in very small proportion at e <dig> 

by e <dig>  the composition of retinal cell types is approximately  <dig> % photoreceptor,  <dig> % horizontal,  <dig> % bipolar,  <dig> % amacrine,  <dig> % ganglion,  <dig> % m端ller glia, and  <dig> % migratory cells .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
the timing of neurogenesis in the chicken retina was previously determined using  tymidine autoradiographs by prada et al. however, due to technical limitations, retinal cell development with dynamic morphological changes in relation to the changes in molecular markers was not fully determined. to address these limitations, we have adopted existing in ovo electroporation capabilities to develop a new method of in ovo electroporation that can specifically target retinal progenitor cells  resulting in the ability to visualize all six major retina cell types at the single cell level. conventional methods  have difficulty labeling late-born neurons in the retina such as bipolar cells. this new method adds important capacities to allow possible future studies where the precise cell morphology of retinal neurons is required. it can also be applied to gain/loss of function studies where a gene of interest can be targeted to study normal development and/or disease of the retina. in this study, we have tracked the morphological and molecular development of each of the cell types in the developing chick retina and determined the relative abundance of each cell type within the total population over a developmentally critical time frame, thereby providing new insights into retinal development.

photoreceptors
almost all vertebrate retinas have two morphological types of photoreceptors  that mediate dim-light, color vision and fine-detail detection  <cit> . although autoradiographic studies fail to distinguish rods and cones in the chick retina  <cit> , ultrastructural studies using scanning electron microscopy confirmed that both rods and cones do exist  <cit> . however, photoreceptor percentages vary with species, cones being a majority in the chick retina, i.e., 86% cones versus 14% rods  <cit> . in this study, the earliest time we observed photoreceptor marker visinin expression was at e <dig> , which is about two days earlier than it has previously been reported at e <dig>  <cit> . since visinin preferentially labels cone photoreceptors  <cit> , this suggests that cone photoreceptor development in chick begins early at about e <dig>  for rods, antibodies against rhodopsin and recoverin were used to immunostain the developing chick retina from e6-e <dig>  no labeling was detected with rhodopsin and recoverin antibodies , suggesting that either the rod-specific antibodies were not specific to chick rods due to differences in species, or that chick rods differentiate after the examined time-frame .

horizontal and amacrine cells
for the study of retinal horizontal cell and amacrine cell development, we used the antibody against lim1+ <dig>  <cit> , pax <dig>  <cit>  and neun  <cit> . transcription factor lim1+ <dig> is essential for horizontal cell development and its laminar position in the retina  <cit> . pax <dig> homeobox gene is among the earliest genes expressed in the eye primordia and plays crucial roles in retina development  <cit> . it is also known to be an amacrine cell marker in later stages  during embryonic retinal development  <cit> . by e <dig>  the cells labeled with pax <dig> show three distinct layers consisting of migratory cells, amacrine cells, and ganglion cells which can be distinguished using their laminar location. staining with lim1+ <dig> antibody showed that horizontal cells began differentiation as early as e <dig>  lim1+ <dig> staining showed that the vast majority of lim1+ <dig> expressing horizontal cells completed migration to the outer region of the inl by e <dig>  the dynamic expression pattern of lim1+ <dig> during horizontal cell differentiation in our study  is consistent with previously observations as the differentiating horizontal cells undergo bi-directional interkinetic nuclear migration  <cit> . pax <dig> also weakly labeled some horizontal cells after e <dig>  the staining patterns of lim1+ <dig> and pax <dig> indicate that amacrine and horizontal cells can be distinguished from each other using laminar location information beginning at e <dig>  the dna-binding, neuron-specific protein neun, is present in most neuronal cell types of vertebrates. neun stained ganglion cells but labeled very few cells in the inl in adult human retinas  <cit>  and in e <dig>  mice  <cit> . we found that neun was strongly expressed in the majority of cells in both the gcl and inl, which is quite different from the one reported in mouse and human. it has been reported that neun staining in the adult chick retina is weaker in the inl than in the gcl  <cit> . this observation suggests that in amacrine cells, neun may be most highly expressed shortly after or during differentiation.

bipolar cells
in cell counts of gfp-expressing cells, bipolar cells were not observed with significant frequency until e <dig>  immunolabeling with pkc留 antibody was also not observed until e <dig> supporting the cell count data. birth-dating studies of bipolar cells in rodents showed bipolar cells are among the later born cell types being born postnatally along with m端ller cells  <cit> . consistent with previous studies  <cit> , the bipolar cells in chick retina have been shown to be the last cell type to become postmitotic.

ganglion cells
previous studies show that ganglion cells are produced over the period from e <dig> to e <dig>  <cit> , with all cells initially born in the ventricular zone, followed by immediate differentiation and migration into the future ganglion cell layer  <cit> . the development of ganglion cells begins at the central region of the developing retina, gradually spreading to the peripheral region as a wave-like front  <cit> . the composition of gfp-expressing ganglion cells in this report did not show significant changes from e <dig> to e <dig>  indicating that they were generated before e <dig>  brn3a is a transcription factor that regulates the development, morphology, and function of retinal ganglion cells  <cit> . it is expressed specifically in the nuclei of cells that have finished migration and begun differentiating into ganglion cells. previous findings have shown that brn3a is expressed as early at e <dig>  in the chick retina  <cit> . combining the early onset of brn3a antibody labeling and the consistent percentage of ganglion cells from e <dig> to e <dig>  it is believed that the vast majority of ganglion cells complete development before e <dig>  this observation is consistent with previous finding that all ganglion cells are born before e <dig>  <cit> . since multiple subtypes of ganglion cells express gfp after in ovo electroporation of pcag-gfp, the fact that most of the gfp-expressing ganglion cells were also brn3a-positive  indicates that brn3a labels the majority of ganglion cell subtypes but not all ganglion cells  <cit> .

m端ller glial cells
the birth dating of m端ller glial cells has been controversial. electron microscopic studies indicate they are born early  <cit> . however, results from 3h-tdr or brdu labeling indicate that m端ller glia cells are labeled only after injections were preformed at late stages during retina development. the immunolabeling results  show that there is constant expression of vimentin throughout the embryonic period from e <dig> to e <dig>  vimentin is known to label radial glial cells, a type of progenitor cell in the central nervous system  <cit> . m端ller glial cells are the only glial cell type in the retina suggesting that vimentin-positive cells are either mature m端ller glial cells in mature retina or retinal stem/progenitor cells in early embryonic retinal development. radial glial cells or progenitors exist throughout the embryonic stages of retinal development and serve as structurally stabilizing scaffolds  <cit>  and as cell migration guides  <cit> . gfp-expressing m端ller glial cells with mature morphology  could only be observed after e <dig>  the proportion of gfp-expressing m端ller glial cells was small, e.g., under  <dig> %, at e <dig> and gradually increased to only  <dig> % at e <dig> . the low number of morphologically mature m端ller glia cells expressing gfp observed between e <dig> and e <dig> could be because 1) they are naturally scarce during this time frame or 2) the late birth of m端ller glial cells makes them less compatible for labeling using the in ovo electroporation method described. first, the early onset and high frequency of immunoreactivity of vimentin suggests that a significant number of radial glial/progenitor cells are born as early as e <dig> and maintain a significant population throughout the examined time frame. second, if their late birth results in the lack of m端ller glial cell labeling, bipolar cells should also be rarely seen, since bipolar cells are born around the same time as m端ller glial cells. third, gfp labeling at e <dig> showed similar proportions of retina cell population for ganglion cells  and bipolar cell . therefore, we believe that the time of birth should not significantly affect the proportion of cell types observed at e <dig> unless those cells are not yet born. for these reasons, we conclude that the lack of cells with mature m端ller glia morphology is not due to their inherent rarity or incompatibility with in ovo electroporation but that the majority of m端ller glial cells do not exhibit morphological maturity before e <dig>  a possible explanation for the lack of morphologically mature m端ller glia are that they may maintain their progenitor cell  state for a significant period of time  after being born. if this is the case, then the cells that serve as scaffolds and migration guides for the migratory neurons in the retina are radial glia cells/progenitor cells in early embryonic development. in the mouse retina, the majority of m端ller glia cells reach morphological maturity late in development  <cit> . it is known that many of m端ller glial cells continue to differentiate postnatally in the chick retina  <cit> . alternatively, the staining of vimentin in microglia cells and proliferating precursor cells is another consideration  <cit> . microglia cells are known to be present in small numbers during the development of retina and involved in clearing dying cells that are part of the normal developmental processes  <cit> . however, labeling of vimentin in microglia cells may only slightly contribute to the early onset and high frequency of vimentin labeling. furthermore, neither microglia nor proliferating precursor cells can account for the radially polarized staining pattern.

in conclusion, this study reveals the dynamic morphological and molecular changes during a critical period of chick embryonic retinal development. we have demonstrated that in ovo electroporation with pcag-gfp combined with immunohistochemistry is a very efficient technique for tracing cell proliferation, migration and differentiation processes during retinal development. we were able to identify specific retinal cell types of the gfp-expressing cells based on their morphology and laminar location. the cellular identity of gfp-expressing cells was further confirmed by immunostaining using cell type-specific antibodies. although, this method has been used in study of retinal development, sustained reporter gene expression in the developing chicken retina has not reported to last for more than a few days  <cit> . in ovo electroporation at hh <dig>  targeting the optic vesicle is able to transfect cells that develop to form the eye. however, these cells have a very high turnover at this time and this method is not specific for retina cells. it may be that the high cell turnover rate prevents sustained stable expression. by e <dig>  the embryo is developed enough that the major structures of the eye are all formed but young enough that the majority of cells in the retina are still retinal stem cells. the vitelline membrane is thin enough to allow for microinjection and the blood vessels are spaced far enough from the eye to allow for electroporation of the embryo without damaging the vessels. as demonstrated in this study, we were able to optimize the in ovo electroporation method to successfully transfect the retinal stem/progenitor cells at e3-e <dig> resulting in all  <dig> major retinal cell types to express gfp through e <dig>  furthermore, gfp expression clearly shows the cellular morphology that other techniques, e.g., 3h-tdr or brdu labeling methods, failed to provide. in rodents, retinas injected and electroporated with pcag-gfp at postnatal day  <dig>  did not show gfp expression in early born cells, e.g., horizontal or ganglion cells, which indicates that the generation of these two types are completed by p <dig> in rodents. by visualizing the morphology of whole individual cells in the developing retina, characterization of each cell type can be performed dynamically during normal development, disease states, or specific over-expression of critical retinal genes. for example, this method can be applied to study the development and growth of the axons and dendrites of particular cell types or applied to produce sustained over-expression or knockdown of developmental genes in the chick retina using alternative dna constructs. as shown in our results this method can be easily combined with well established immunohistochemistry methods which will be helpful for the understanding of the molecular events that accompany morphological changes during normal development or disease of the retina.
