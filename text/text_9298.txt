BACKGROUND
receptor-like kinases  constitute a prominent class of receptors that transmit a signal across a membrane. the years since the first isolation of a plant rlk  <cit>  have witnessed a great increase in knowledge regarding the function of plant rlks. rlks are required for cellular communication in many processes during the plant's life cycle, regulating aspects of development, defense, and physiology  <cit> . the importance of rlks in plants is emphasized by the observation that rlks constitute about  <dig> % of the arabidopsis protein coding sequences  <cit> . moreover, greater than  <dig> rlks belong to the leucine-rich repeat  class of rlks typified by varying numbers of lrrs in their extracellular domain. lrrs are involved in protein-protein interactions and are found in numerous types of proteins  <cit> . presently, the biological roles of only a handful of rlks are known. thus, one important task consists of gaining information about the functions of the remaining plant rlks.

the functional analysis of genes encoding rlks is often complicated due to redundancy issues. for example, during early anther development there are repeated requirements for position-dependent intercellular signaling events mediated by discrete sets of redundantly acting lrr-rlks. the development of the tapetum and the differentiation of microspores depend on the function of several lrr-rlk genes. analysis of mutations in a single gene, encoding the lrr-x class lrr-rlk excess microsporocytes 1/extra sporogenous cells   <cit>  revealed a role for exs/ems in these aspects of anther development. anthers of exs/ems mutants fail to form a tapetum and show an increased number of aberrantly developing pollen mother cells. further, somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase  <dig>  and serk <dig> encode two homologous lrr-rlks of the lrr-ii class  <cit>  that are coexpressed during early anther development. while serk <dig> and serk <dig> single mutants both exhibit a wild-type anther morphology, the serk <dig> serk <dig> double mutants resemble exs/ems single mutants  <cit> .

this finding suggests functionally redundant roles for serk <dig> and serk <dig> in processes that also depend on exs/ems function. interestingly, translational fusions of serk <dig> and serk <dig> to variants of green fluorescent protein can form homo- and heterodimers in a cell culture system, indicating that serk1/serk <dig> may act in the same protein complex  <cit> . another early aspect of anther development is the asymmetric cell division of archesporial cells and the differentiation of primary parietal and primary sporogenous cells. this process is effected by barely any meristem  and bam <dig>  <cit> . bam <dig> and bam <dig> are members of a gene family encoding lrr-rlks, that, in addition to bam <dig> and bam <dig>  includes clavata <dig>  and bam <dig>  <cit> .

the examples described above represent relatively straightforward cases of functional redundancy, where very similar genes are co-expressed in the same tissue and are likely to functionally substitute for each other. conversely, there are also known instances where a diversification of function has taken place in evolution, largely through alterations in gene expression patterns between closely related lrr-rlk genes. this can result in a combination of partially overlapping and partially separate functions.

for example, signal transduction involving brassinosteroids  plays an important role in cell elongation and differentiation  <cit> . brassinosteroid insensitive <dig>  encodes a lrr-rlk that constitutes a key component of a br receptor complex  <cit> . the arabidopsis genome contains several close relatives of bri1: the bri1-like genes brl <dig>  brl <dig> and vascular highway <dig> /brl <dig>  <cit> . vh <dig> does not bind br but is required for the maintenance of provascular differentiation  <cit> . bri <dig>  brl <dig> and brl <dig> encode proteins that share the capacity to bind br  <cit> . the three genes, however, differ in their expression patterns and there is a shift of emphasis regarding their functions. while bri <dig> is expressed in a broad fashion, brl <dig> and brl <dig> are predominantly expressed in a complementary pattern in vascular tissue  <cit> . in accordance with its expression pattern, bri <dig> exerts a broad function in cell elongation and differentiation, which includes the differentiation of vascular tissue. brl <dig> and brl <dig> can fully substitute for bri <dig>  <cit> . however, brl <dig> and brl <dig> are mainly required for vascular differentiation, whereby synergistic interactions of bri <dig> with brl <dig> and brl <dig> are required for regular vascular development  <cit> . a similarly complex behavior is exhibited by the small group of genes encoding erecta  and erecta-like <dig>  and erl <dig> lrr-rlks that regulate organ size and stomata development  <cit> .

the lrr-class of rlks has been subdivided into several classes   <cit> . we are interested in the lrr-v/strubbelig-receptor family  gene family encoding putative lrr-rlks  <cit> . this monophyletic family is represented by strubbelig  and eight additional members. sub was originally identified in a screen for mutants with a defect in ovule development  <cit> . in more recent work it was shown that sub encodes a putative lrr-rlk of central importance to the plant as it affects cellular morphogenesis in a number of different organs  <cit> . in particular, sub is required for the orientation of the cell division plane and the control of cell number, cell size and cell shape. furthermore, sub, also known as scrambled , affects root hair specification  <cit> . a combination of biochemical and genetic evidence suggests that phosphotransfer activity of the kinase domain is not essential for sub protein function  <cit> . thus, sub is likely to represent an atypical or "dead" rlk  <cit> . in this paper we report on the initial molecular and functional characterisation of the other members of the srf gene family.

RESULTS
the lrr-v/srf gene family encodes putative lrr-rlks
sub belongs to lrr-v family of arabidopsis lrr-rlks  <cit> . further database searches failed to identify additional family members in arabidopsis. thus, the lrr-v family encompasses  <dig> different representatives encoded by genes that are located throughout the genome. we coined the term strubbelig-receptor family  and named the individual family members srf <dig> to srf <dig>  <cit> . sub would be srf <dig> but retained its original name . srf members also relate to the ltk gene family of unknown function from corn  <cit> . we compared the genomic coordinates of srf genes to investigate whether some pairs are located in segments derived from the youngest large-scale duplication event in arabidopsis  <cit> . the pairs srf1/srf <dig>  srf4/srf <dig> and srf6/srf <dig> were found as segmentally duplicated pairs while sub, srf <dig> and srf <dig> were not located in duplicated regions. we isolated tentative full-length cdnas of all members  to characterize the intron-exon organisation of the srf genes . during this work it became clear that all srf genes carried incorrect annotations in the arabidopsis database. the reannotation information was submitted to the mips arabidopsis database  <cit>  and to tair  <cit> .

with one distinction regarding srf <dig> , conceptual translation of the srf genes suggests that they encode putative lrr-rlks with an extra-cellular domain , a transmembrane domain , an intracellular juxtamembrane domain , an intracellular catalytic or kinase domain , and in some cases, an extended c-terminus . at the amino acid level, predicted srf members exhibit variable degrees of conservation ranging from  <dig>  % identity to  <dig> % identity  and fall into distinct subclades   <cit> . the predicted srf proteins share an overall domain organisation. the ecds of the lrr-v family are characterised by a stretch of  <dig> to  <dig> conserved residues representing the sub-domain and located just n-terminal to six lrrs  <cit> . the role of the sub domain is unknown. at least for sub, however, the sub-domain appears to be functionally relevant as the sub- <dig> allele results in an amino acid substitution at a conserved position in the sub domain   <cit> .

the part of the ecd region that is flanked by the last lrr-repeat and the tm domain varies between the different srf members. in case of srf <dig> this region encompasses  <dig> residues . several srf members feature particular regional distinctions in the central part of this domain . srf <dig>  srf <dig>  and sub carry insertions in this region ranging from eight residues  to  <dig> residues  while srf <dig> and srf <dig> each feature an identical deletion of  <dig> amino acids. this central part is also enriched in proline residues, particularly in sub but also in srf <dig>  srf <dig>  srf <dig> and srf <dig>  in the case of srf <dig> an additional proline-rich domain is also located before the kinase domain.

the jm is variable among the family members. the kinase domains of the srf proteins have the hallmarks of typical protein kinases  <cit>  . a more detailed comparison of the kinase domains, however, indicates that there are notable differences in a stretch of residues flanked by kinase subdomains ii and iii, a region known to be variable betweeen different protein kinases  <cit> , and in the activation segment. the kinase subdomains ii and iii are required for the binding of atp and the activation segment is important for substrate binding  <cit> . sub, srf <dig> and srf <dig> feature unique activation segment sequences. this domain is more conserved within the srf1/ <dig>  srf6/ <dig>  and to some extent srf4/ <dig>  pairs. the activation segment sequences of the individual pairs, however, are again distinct from each other and the other lrrv family activation segment sequences. this finding indicates that there may be considerable diversity in substrate recognition among family members, and therefore diversity in function. the findings also leave open possible redundant functions of members of the three more conserved pairs .

the carboxy-termini  of the srf members represent another domain of diversity. srf <dig> has the longest c-terminus  while sub and srf <dig> lack such c-termini. in contrast, srf <dig>  the closest homolog of srf <dig>  features a  <dig> residue extension. furthermore, only the first  <dig> amino acids of the srf <dig> and srf <dig> extensions are conserved. interestingly, distinct serines in the c-termini of srf <dig> and srf <dig>  are phosphorylated in an arabidopsis suspension culture system  <cit> .

srf <dig> undergoes differential splicing
during the full-length cdna isolation experiments we noticed that srf <dig> undergoes differential splicing resulting in two mrna species: one lacks intron  <dig> , the other carries intron  <dig>  . the differential splicing event occurs in both ler and col indicating that it is not related to the observed srf <dig> ler/col polymorphisms . differential splicing of srf <dig> was observed in all tissues tested. we could not detect splicing variants for the other srf members in rt-pcr experiments using primer pairs flanking the equivalent intron. full-length srf1a and srf1b cdna species were generated from rna isolated from stage 1– <dig> flowers . conceptual translation indicates that the two srf <dig> variants share the ecd and the tm but differ in their intracellular domains. thus, srf <dig> is likely to encode two proteins: a lrr-rlk  and a membrane-anchored lrr receptor-like protein   that lacks most of the intracellular domain. prominent examples of genes encoding membrane-anchored lrr-rlps include clavata <dig> , too many mouths  or rpp <dig> from arabidopsis and cf- <dig> from tomato  <cit> .

srf <dig> is characterised by a high degree of polymorphism between the ler and col accessions
the sub phenotype in above-ground tissues is much less prominent in the col background  <cit> . an initial genetic analysis indicated the existence of a genetic modifier, located on the second chromosome and linked to the erecta  locus . srf <dig> is located on chromosome  <dig> within a short distance to er. thus, we tested whether or not there is noteworthy polymorphism in the srf <dig> sequence when comparing the ler and col accessions. we did observe an unusual amount of polymorphisms in srf <dig>  although subsequent studies indicated that srf <dig> is not the modifier . we sequenced genomic dna of the ler srf <dig> locus spanning nucleotides  <dig> to  <dig>  and we sequenced full-length cdnas obtained from mrna isolated from ler and col accessions . within the  <dig>  kb of srf <dig> genomic sequence covering the coding sequence we observed a total of  <dig> ler/col polymorphisms or about  <dig> polymorphisms per  <dig> kb. this is in contrast to the average number of polymorphisms between two accessions which is about  <dig> polymorphisms per  <dig> kb genomic dna across all sequence types and somewhat lower in coding regions  <cit> .

abbreviations: jm, juxtamembrane domain; lrr, leucine-rich repeat; prr, proline-rich region; sp, signal peptide.

out of these  <dig> polymorphisms  <dig> correspond to simple nucleotide polymorphisms  and  <dig> to small insertions/deletions . the indels encompass  <dig> insertions  and  <dig> deletions . eight indels are located in introns, and two deletions are found in the 3' utr. of the snps,  <dig> are located in introns, two are present in the 5' utr, one is located in the 3' utr, and  <dig> snps are present in exons. the other srf genes do not exhibit similarly elevated levels of polymorphisms between ler and col .

the polymorphisms are not equally distributed along srf <dig>  at the nucleotide level about 21% of the polymorphisms are located in the region encoding the ecd whereas 79% are found in the intracellular domain. at the predicted protein level,  <dig> of the  <dig> non-synonymous residue changes map to the intracellular domain , with the jm featuring  <dig> amino acid alterations and the kinase domain  <dig> changes. this finding suggests that the polymorphisms affect, in particular, srf1a. it is unclear if the polymorphisms influence protein function. many of those nucleotide polymorphisms may do so as they alter the predicted protein sequence. of the nucleotide polymorphisms located in exons,  <dig> result in amino acid changes of which at least six result in residues with different chemical and spatial properties. however, only one such alteration, a change from proline  to leucine  at position  <dig> in srf1a and situated just between kinase subdomains via and vib, affects a residue strictly conserved between srf proteins . the other polymorphisms reside at positions occupied by amino acids that are not conserved or only partially conserved among the srf proteins.

functional analysis of srf genes
srf gene function was assayed by analysing the morphology of several independently isolated t-dna insertion lines for each srf gene. in addition, we tested srf <dig> srf <dig>  srf <dig> srf <dig>  and srf <dig> srf <dig> double mutants , thereby assaying the possible functional redundancy of these gene pairs. mutant and wild-type plants were grown on soil in a greenhouse and scored in a systematic fashion for phenotypes at various developmental stages .

plants with altered srf <dig> activity show a phenotype that indicates that srf <dig> plays a role in the regulation of leaf size . we noticed that about 80% of homozygous mutant plants of two independent t-dna insertion lines, srf4- <dig> and srf4- <dig>  exhibited a reduction in leaf size. leaf blade dimensions were measured using as standard the fifth rosette leaves  <cit>  taken from different 16-days-old plants grown simultaneously and under similar conditions. both alleles showed an approximate 20% reduction in the length and width of the leaf blade. this translates to a decrease of 40% in the surface area of the leaf blade. interestingly, transgenic wild-type col plants ectopically expressing srf <dig> using the 35s promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus  <cit>  exhibited leaves of increased size. we tested five transgenic lines with enlarged leaves and those lines exhibited elevated levels of transgene expression . two independent homozygous 35s::srf <dig> lines were characterized further . we noted a 25–30% increase in length and width of the leaf blade, translating into a 40–50% increase in the surface area of the leaf blade. interestingly, leaf shape appeared about normal in srf <dig> and 35s::srf <dig> plants. this is also indicated by the constant length/width ratios of leaf blades across the two types of mutants and the wild type .

values are in mm except for the area column . the mean ± sd is shown. the mean values of all measurements between srf <dig> mutants, 35s::srf <dig> transgenic plants and wild type are statistically significant .

35s::srf4:myc.a and 35s::srf4:myc.b correspond to transgenic lines 3– <dig> and 1– <dig>  respectively.

alength/width ratio of leaf blade.

taken together these findings provide genetic evidence that srf <dig> is a direct positive regulator of leaf size. the basis of the slightly reduced penetrance in the two srf <dig> mutants is unclear. the insertions in both srf <dig> alleles reside in exons encoding part of the extracellular domain of srf <dig>  in particular, srf4- <dig> is predicted to carry only a very short form of the ecd . it is therefore unlikely that residual srf <dig> function in srf4- <dig> accounts for the reduction in penetrance. it is also unlikely that partial compensation of srf <dig> function by its closest relative srf <dig> explains the reduced penetrance of the leaf size phenotype in srf <dig> mutants. the analysed mutant alleles of srf <dig>  srf5- <dig> and srf5- <dig>  apparently looked normal, transgenic 35s::srf <dig> plants did not exhibit noticably bigger leaves, and srf4- <dig> srf5- <dig> double mutants essentially resembled srf4- <dig> single mutants . thus, the results suggest that the reduced penetrance of the srf <dig> phenotype relates to other, as yet unknown factors.

apart from srf <dig> mutants, all other t-dna-induced mutants exhibited apparent wild-type morphology. we could also detect no obvious differences from wild type when light-grown mutant plants were tested for germination behavior and root growth defects on  <dig> × ms agar plates, supplemented with 1% sucrose. as previously reported, the sub phenotype is much more pronounced in the ler background compared to col  <cit> . as the t-dna insertion lines are col-derived, individual srf t-dna alleles were crossed into a ler background . again, apart from the defects in srf <dig> plants, we could detect no additional phenotypes/defects in srf mutants. the lack of phenotypes could be in part due to the fact that the t-dna insertions in those lines only lead to an incomplete loss of srf function. we could detect transcripts in all tested t-dna lines when using primers  directed to a position located 3' to the t-dna integration site . in the case of srf1- <dig>  however, at least one line had a t-dna insertion situated in an exon encoding part of the ecd indicating that those insertions should severly impair protein function. the situation is less clear for the insertions in srf6- <dig>  the insertion sites in srf6- <dig> and srf6- <dig> are located within  <dig> base pairs 5' to the start of the srf <dig> coding region. the insertion site of srf8- <dig> resides in the 5' utr. therefore, the observed transcript levels could result in sufficient srf <dig> and srf <dig> activity. the insertion sites in srf7- <dig> and srf7- <dig> are located in introns. in both lines correctly spliced mrna molecules could be detected by rt-pcr using primers flanking the intron carring the insertion   again leaving the possibility that sufficient srf <dig> activity is present in those t-dna insertion lines.

to gain further indications as to the function of individual srf genes transgenic plants were generated that ectopically express srf1a, srf1b and srf2- <dig> cdnas under the control of the 35s promoter. again ler and col wild-type backgrounds were used and transgenic plants were assayed for transgene expression . no obvious phenotypes were detected in plants carrying 35s::srf1b or 35s::srf <dig> constructs. in contrast, 35s::srf2/3/5/ <dig> plants , while otherwise normal in appearance, exhibited sterility . the 35s::srf <dig> plants  also showed sterility in addition to the leaf-size phenotype outlined above. closer analysis of open flowers revealed all five different transgenic plants to carry mature anthers that in the most extreme cases failed to produce any visible pollen, while ovules appeared normal. pollinating sterile plants with wild-type pollen resulted in normal seed production indicating that such plants were male-sterile . in the case of different 35s::srf <dig>  35s::srf <dig>  and 35s::srf <dig> lines the sterility correlated with increased transgene expression while for 35s::srf <dig> and 35s::srf <dig> lines no strict correlation could be detected . in the ler background only ectopic expression of srf <dig> and srf <dig> led to male sterility, indicating the importance of genetic background in these experiments.

the situation for 35s::srf1a and 35s::srf <dig> plants was more complex. we noticed that the majority of resistant t <dig> seedlings failed to generate rosette leaves. the seedlings featured cotyledons, stayed green for several weeks and then died . this finding was observed in ler and col backgrounds and indicates that ectopic expression of srf1a and srf <dig> may lead to seedling lethality. conversely, viable transgenic 35s::srf1a and 35s::srf <dig> plants, that also expressed the transgene, were isolated. these plants showed no apparent mutant phenotype. the basis for the discrepancy is presently not understood. unfortunately, due to the apparently normal anther development and fertility in the different srf t-dna insertion lines it is presently difficult to decide whether or not the sterility exhibited by some of the 35s::srf transgenic plants relates to the wild-type function of the corresponding gene. a similar restriction applies to the seedling lethality.

to test if different srf genes could substitute for sub function we generated separate sub- <dig> plant lines, where each line was transgenic for one of the individual nine 35s::srf constructs. while at least  <dig> transgenic sub- <dig> 35s::srf t <dig> plants were screened per construct, no rescue of the sub- <dig> phenotype was observed. seedling lethality, as described above, for sub- <dig> 35s::srf1a and sub- <dig> 35s::srf <dig> plants was again present, however, again several viable sub- <dig> 35s::srf1a and sub- <dig> 35s::srf <dig> plants expressing the transgene were isolated . these plants showed a sub- <dig> phenotype. as the sub- <dig> phenotype disappears in sub- <dig> 35s::sub plants  <cit>  our results suggest that srf1- <dig> cannot functionally replace sub in this genetic assay.

global gene expression analysis
rt-pcr analysis  indicated that most srf transcripts are present in a broad pattern. srf <dig> expression may be the exception, as its expression levels are not easily detectable by rt-pcr, in siliques, stems, roots and seedlings. to analyse the expression profiles of srf genes at a global scale, including many developmental stages and experimental conditions, we made use of a large set of genechip expression data publicly available at the nottingham arabidopsis stock centre   <cit>  . the data set used comprises  <dig> affymetrix chips  and more than  <dig> experiments covering a wide range of tissues, developmental stages and environmental conditions. probe sets of the ath <dig> genechip were realigned to the arabidopsis whole genome sequence to exclude non-unique probes. all srf genes including sub are described by specific probe sets . the experimental set up did not allow a discrimination between srf1a and srf1b. by interrogating this dataset we targeted two objectives: to assay possible functional redundancy between srf genes and to formulate hypotheses regarding the function of individual srf genes.

correlation analysis of srf transcript levels
is there redundancy between srf genes, such that an active srf gene  could functionally replace the mutated srf gene? if so, one expects at least some co-expression of the redundant genes. therefore, we performed a global correlation analysis of srf transcript levels. pearson correlation coefficients were determined for each srf pair . to compare the srf correlations against random expectation, we computed all-against-all gene pairs correlations of all genes present on the ath <dig> chip  to derive background expression similarities. correlations were calculated as  pearson correlation coefficients. mean and median of background distribution are rmean =  <dig>  and rmedian =  <dig>  and the 80%-, 95%- and 99%-quantiles are  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. for all srf pairs, global correlations are considerably below the  <dig> %-quantile and, except for srf <dig> and srf <dig>  even below the 80%-quantile . thus, with the possible exception of srf4/srf <dig>  global expression correlations provide no support for strong redundancies between srf genes but indicate instead at least partially specific expression patterns.

all pairwise correlations are below the 95%-quantile of the background correlation distribution .

expression profiling of srf genes
one way to gain further leads into possible gene function is to ask whether or not a particular gene is up- or downregulated at certain developmental stages or under certain experimental conditions. to investigate expression of srf genes in detail, srf expression levels were analysed for each experiment in the ath <dig> genechip dataset. replicates were summarized by their mean. measurements were scaled such that expression levels for each chip had a mean of  <dig>  and a variance of  <dig> . expression profiles for the srf genes are shown in figure  <dig>  srf gene expression is present over a wide range of experiments and most of them show, at least for particular experiments, specific profiles. this corroborates the analysis of global expression correlations and conclusions about partly independent functionalities of srf genes.

sub generally has expression levels below average. it displays accented expression levels in two large developmental series. in both series, shoot apices at the bolting stage have elevated sub levels. in contrast, srf <dig> profile exhibits several distinct gene inductions or repressions in experiments investigating programmed cell death, tumor development, control of lignification and pectin biosynthesis. srf <dig> shows an overall low and unspecific broad expression. as expected from their global correlations, srf <dig> and srf <dig> show the highest similarity in their profiles, with srf <dig> having remarkably lower expression levels. both genes appear to exhibit highly pronounced expression in mature pollen. it is possible, however, that the seemingly high levels of pollen expression in the genechip data set represents an artefact originating from the normalisation procedure as only 26% of the genes present on the ath <dig> chip were detected in pollen samples while about 55% to 67% of the genes were detected in samples from most other tissues  <cit> . in this context it is interesting to note that srf <dig> mutants show altered leaf development but no apparent defect in pollen development or fertility. in addition, srf <dig> single mutants, and srf <dig> srf <dig> double mutants, show apparently normal pollen and are fertile plants. we could not confirm a notably strong expression of srf <dig> and srf <dig> in pollen using in situ hybridisation experiments as in our hands pollen regularly show increased background signals in such experiments . although we did not perform quantitative experiments, the results from our rt-pcr analysis may indicate, however, that expression of both genes is perhaps more readily detected in developing flowers in comparison with many other tissues .

in contrast to the previous genes, expression profiles of srf <dig>  srf <dig>  srf <dig>  and srf <dig> exhibit above average or high expression levels over a broad range of experiments. for these genes, we therefore describe only the most salient experiments, i.e. with the highest expression levels . the strongest expression levels of srf <dig> are concordant to those of srf <dig>  i.e. in experiments investigating programmed cell death, pectin biosynthesis, control of lignification and tumor development. in contrast to srf <dig>  however, srf <dig> shows mid-level expressions in many other experiments. srf <dig> was strongly induced in plants exposed for a prolonged time  to heat stress. considerably elevated expression levels for srf <dig> were also observable for several light treatments, brassinosteroid treatments and pectin biosynthesis. furthermore, strong inductions of srf <dig> were present in experiments analyzing expression in the atrbohc/rhd <dig> mutant  <cit>  and infections with fungi inducing arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis. as observed for srf <dig>  both srf <dig> and srf <dig> showed prominent expression in experiments analyzing effects on transcription for sulfate limitations and for the rhd <dig> mutant in arabidopsis. in addition, the expression profile of srf <dig> showed elevated levels in experiments involving various brassinosteroid treatments.

in summary, although expression profiles showed overlapping domains between various srf genes, an experiment-wide analysis of expressions corroborates our previous conclusions. that is, genetic redundancy, in the sense that at least some srf genes are functionally interchangeable, is likely not a major cause for the lack of phenotypes in srf mutants.

enrichment of functional categories
previous reports have shown that co-expressed genes have an increased likelihood to be involved in a common biological process  <cit> . coexpression information can therefore be used to transfer knowledge from annotated genes to genes of unknown function. we extended our expression correlation analysis to compare individual srf expression levels with the expression levels of all arabidopsis genes included on the ath <dig> chip. gene ontology  annotations for arabidopsis genes  were obtained from tair  <cit> . from the all-against-all matrix of pearson correlations, we selected the top  <dig>  correlated genes for each srf gene. overrepresentation of particular functional categories within each of these gene sets were tested by binomial probability. p-values were bonferroni-corrected for multiple hypothesis testing. corrected p-values of p ≤  <dig>  were considered significant. table  <dig> lists the detected functional categories for the different srf genes.

right column shows bonferroni-corected p-values for significance of over-representation. p-values <  <dig>  were considered significant.

curiously, our analysis detected only for srf <dig>  but not for srf <dig>  a statistically significant enrichment for several functional categories. this result is somewhat surprising as both genes have a similar expression profile. both profiles mainly differ in expression levels corresponding to their expression in mature pollen tissue while for most other experiments, both genes show basal or background expression levels. the relatively small number of pronounced or informative expression peaks for this gene pair could influence our statistical test due to many small fluctuations from noise or background expression. therefore, in our current analysis, it is not clear whether differences between srf <dig> and srf <dig> truly reflect different biological roles or may be due to an insufficient resolution/power of our approach. however, we were able to detect significant enrichments for go annotations within their correlated genes for srf <dig>  srf <dig>  and srf6- <dig>  as expected, go terms describing kinase signaling pathways were overrepresented in several gene sets. the set of srf <dig> was enriched in golgi-associated processes and the set of srf <dig> in processes regulating pectinesterase activity. srf <dig> is potentially acting in pathways responding to fungal infections. srf <dig> shows a strong association with proteins involved in the organization and biogenesis of the cell wall while srf <dig> may act in sterol biosynthesis.

discussion
differential splicing at the srf <dig> locus
we found that differential splicing of the srf <dig> transcript potentially leads to two types of proteins: a lrr-rlk  and a membrane-anchored lrr-rlp . genes encoding putative rlps represent a large family in plants  <cit> . as a rule, rlks and rlps are encoded by separate genes in plants  <cit> . thus, srf <dig> is unusual as the rlk and rlp versions of srf <dig> appear to be generated by differential splicing. in this respect, however, it resembles for example the brassica gene encoding s-locus receptor kinase  from the s <dig> and s <dig> haplotypes  <cit> . differential splicing of srk in those haplotypes results in multiple transcrips, one of which encodes the srk while another encodes a soluble protein, carrying the ecd but not the tm or intracellular domain .

the function of most plant rlps is unknown  <cit> . to date, rlps are known to affect processes as diverse as meristem regulation, stomata development, self-incompatibility, or pathogen resistance  <cit> . interestingly, rlps such as xa21d, clv <dig>  tmm, or the s-locus glycoprotein  of brassica, may affect the same process regulated by a rlk with a related ecd. for example, the lrr-rlk xa <dig> and the extracellular lrr-rlp xa21d confer the same resistance spectrum to xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae, albeit with different strengths  <cit> . genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that the membrane-anchored lrr-rlp clv <dig> acts in the same pathway than the lrr-rlk clv <dig> and that clv <dig> and clv <dig> form a complex  <cit> . in addition, there is genetic evidence that the membrane-anchored lrr-rlp tmm functions in the stomatal patterning process regulated by members of the erecta family of lrr-rlks  <cit> . the brassica self-incompatibility protein slg occurs in different forms but is generally an extracellular protein with an s-domain highly homologous to the s-domain of srk  <cit> . the exact function of slg is still under debate  <cit> , however, there is evidence that in certain s-haplotypes slg is part of a protein complex that includes srk  <cit> . slg enhances the self-incompatibility response in some s-haplotypes  <cit>  and one function of slg may reside in the stabilisation of srk  <cit> .

whether or not srf1a and srf1b act in the same protein complex remains to be investigated. in this context it is interesting to note that srf1a may differ from srf1b in its biological activity as indicated by the presence of seedling lethality exhibited by some 35s::srf1a plants, but not by 35s::srf1b plants. thus, differential splicing at the srf <dig> locus may result in two srf <dig> protein variants with distinct biochemical and possibly biological properties.

srf <dig> exhibits high levels of ler/col polymorphisms
a high number of polymorphisms were found when comparing srf <dig> sequences between col and ler. several arabidopsis genes exhibit such elevated levels of polymorphisms. these include a large number of nucleotide-binding site plus leucine-rich repeat  genes, a domain organisation characteristic of many plant resistance  genes  <cit> , but also developmental regulators such as apetala  <dig> , cauliflower   <cit> , or clv <dig>  <cit> .

most r genes of the nbs-lrr class are organised in single units, clusters, and superclusters  <cit> . r genes are involved in gene-for-gene interactions  <cit> . the presence of a specific allelic variant of an r gene and a corresponding specific avirulence allele from the pathogen in both host and pathogen results in disease resistance. in the case of nbs-lrr-class r proteins the c-terminal lrrs are likely to be important for the specificity of r protein and avirulence protein interaction. in accordance with this view, such r genes are characterized by high variability in the lrr-coding regions and population genetic analysis indicates that balanced selection acts to maintain resistant and susceptible alleles  <cit> . interestingly, the clv <dig> polymorphisms affect mainly the n-terminal lrrs in the ecd  <cit> , which are likely to be involved in ligand binding.

whether or not srf <dig> is under balancing selection remains to be seen. the large number of srf <dig> polymorphisms is evident in a ler/col comparison. srf <dig> does not appear to diverge much from col in several other accessions . in addition, srf <dig> is not situated in a generally polymorphic genomic region although the neighbouring locus at2g <dig> also exhibits elevated levels of ler/col polymorphisms . at2g <dig> encodes a protein annotated as a secretory carrier membrane protein  possibly acting in endocytosis. it should also be noted that the allele is rare and if under balancing selection, is maintained at very low frequency. the ka/ks ratio, the ratio of nonsynonymous over synonymous amino acid substitutions, may point to an influence of balancing selection. a ratio exceeding unity is compatible with balanced selection. taking the entire srf <dig> protein into account, the ka/ks ratio is  <dig>  . in addition, the asynonymous changes are mainly concentrated in a particular region of srf <dig>  considering the ecd and the intracellular domain  separately, one observes values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . thus, and in contrast to clv <dig>  the srf <dig> polymorphisms mainly affect the intracellular domains of the predicted srf <dig> proteins.

srf <dig> is required for the control of leaf size
the genetic results presented in this paper suggest that srf <dig> is a direct positive regulator of leaf size but not leaf shape. organ size depends on the coordination of cell proliferation and cell size  <cit> . it is poorly understood how this coordination is regulated and only few genes are known that when overexpressed cause altered organ size but do not interfere with differentiation. such genes are postulated to be involved in the control of an organ-size checkpoint  <cit> . one key element in organ size control is the positive regulation of the duration of cell proliferation during organ development . the current evidence suggests that auxin, in an auxin-resistant1-dependent fashion, upregulates transcription of the argos gene encoding a protein of unknown biochemical function  <cit> . plants that exhibit reduced or ectopic expression of argos show reduced or enlarged aerial organs, respectively. argos mediates its effects through aintegumenta   <cit> . ant encodes a member of the ap2/erebp class of transcription factors  <cit> . plants with altered argos or ant activities share many similarities and argos acts as a positive regulator of ant expression  <cit> . plants with reduced ant activity show a number of defects including a variably reduced floral organ number, narrow floral organs and reduced ovule primordium and integument outgrowth  <cit> . in contrast, ectopic expression of ant leads to leaves and floral organs, including ovules, with increased size and normal shape  <cit> . ant largely influences the final number of cells in an organ and in turn mediates its function in part through cell cycle regulators such as cycd3; <dig>  <cit> .

with respect to leaves recent evidence suggests that distinct processes regulate cell proliferation and cell expansion along the longitudinal  and lateral  axes, respectively  <cit> . in addition, the plate meristem of leaf primordia sustains two-dimensional growth of leaf blades as lamina cells divide in random directions  <cit> . two genes, angustufolia <dig>  and growth-regulating factor <dig> , are implicated as positive regulators of cell proliferation in the plate meristem  <cit> . atgrf <dig> encodes a putative transcription factor  <cit> . an <dig> is identical to grf-interacting factor <dig>   <cit> . an3/atgif <dig> encodes a homolog of the animal transcriptional coactivator syt and an3/atgif <dig> can dimerise with atgrf <dig> in yeast  <cit> . plants defective in an3/atgif <dig> function exhibit a reduction in leaf cells due to decreasing plate meristem activity. loss-of-function mutations in atgrf <dig> lead to similar, though milder effects. by contrast, ectopic expression of an3/atgif <dig> or atgrf <dig> results in normally shaped but larger leaves. the combined genetic and molecular data support the notion that an3/atgif <dig> and atgrf <dig> act together to promote plate meristem activity and thus leaf size  <cit> .

the positive regulation of cell expansion is also important for leaf size and involves argos-like , a gene related to argos  <cit> . at the organ level manipulating the levels and/or duration of arl activity results in similar effects on organ size than related alterations in argos activity. interestingly, arl is required for general cell expansion, as opposed to polar cell expansion/elongation, during organ growth. arl appears to mediate br-related signaling in general cell expansion. thus, although argos and arl are structurally related genes that affect leaf size, they do affect different cellular processes during organogenesis. other promoters of cell expansion and leaf size include atgrf <dig>  atgrf <dig>  and atgrf <dig>  homologs of atgrf <dig>  <cit> . single or various double-mutant combinations of single mutant alleles showed either no or only small defects in leaf growth. a grf <dig> grf <dig> grf <dig> triple null mutant, however, exhibited an approximate 32% reduction of the surface area of third leaves. 35s::atgrf <dig> or 35s::atgrf <dig> plants exhibited variably increased leaf size. a cellular analysis of the phenotypes indicated that the leaf-size defects are due to corresponding alterations in cell size  <cit> . in addition, several so-called extra-small sisters  mutants with a defect in cell expansion, leading to reduced leaf size but normal leaf shape, have recently been isolated  <cit> .

it remains to be seen if srf <dig> affects cell proliferation, cell size, or a combination of both, and whether or not srf <dig> participates in the control of the leaf size checkpoint. it is possible that srf <dig> may affect plate meristem activity given that the leaf index  remains constant across srf <dig> mutants, wild type, and 35s::srf <dig> transgenic plants. furthermore, srf <dig> might be involved in cell size control as go term enrichment analysis among genes coexpressed with srf <dig> hints at srf <dig> being part of a mechanism inolving pectinesterase activity. it will be interesting to determine how srf <dig> relates to the known mechanisms regulating leaf size.

functions of other srf genes
what is the function of the other srf genes and is there redundancy due to functional overlap between individual srf genes in this gene family? at present we cannot provide definitive answers to these questions. sub/scm affects the orientation of the cell division plane and cell number in many plant tissues  <cit>  , and influences root hair patterning  <cit> . what about the functions of the other srf genes? ectopic expression of several srf genes interferes with normal development and can result in seedling lethality or male sterility due to aberrant pollen development. regarding the analysis of the loss-of-function mutants subtle phenotypes may have been overlooked or mutants are yet to be exposed to the appropriate environmental conditions. in addition, particularly in the case of srf <dig>  srf <dig> and srf <dig> sufficient srf activity could still be present in the analysed t-dna insertion lines.

the srf gene family may also be characterised by a level of redundancy among family members, as demonstrated in several gene families encoding rlks  <cit> . several lines of investigations, while each not conclusive in its own right, provide a tentative basis for this type of redundancy to play a subordinate role in the srf gene family. sequence differences, such as the variable, sometimes proline-rich, proximal ecd region flanked by the sixth lrr domain and the tm domain, the differences in the jm and alterations in the activation segments and the c-termini, could be interpreted that many of the predicted srf proteins carry out separate functions. in addition, results from global pair-wise srf coexpression analysis do not support the notion of redundancy among srf family members. as far as sequence conservation and expression profiles are concerned the gene pairs srf1/ <dig>  srf4/ <dig> and srf6/ <dig> may represent exceptions. however, with the exception of altered leaves in srf <dig> mutants, we did not observe obvious phenotypes in the corresponding single and double mutants. in particular, the leaves of srf <dig> looked normal. in addition, srf <dig> and srf <dig> feature different c-termini, the members of the three gene pairs differ in the go term enrichments in the groups of coexpressed genes, and srf <dig> and srf <dig> exhibit varying expression profiles. finally, the failure of 35s::srf1- <dig> constructs to rescue the sub- <dig> phenotype suggests that none of the tested genes can functionally replace sub. thus, the combined available evidence indicates that srf genes exhibit diversity at the functional level.

what then are the hypothetical roles of srf genes? global expression profiling and the analysis of the enrichment of go terms among genes coexpressed with srf genes revealed possible functions for some of the srf genes. several srf genes may be involved in cell wall biosynthesis and/or function. for example, expression profiling of srf <dig> and srf <dig> suggests a role for these genes in lignification and pectin biosynthesis. srf <dig> may also have a function in the cell biology of the golgi system and in vascular tissue pattern formation. srf <dig> may be involved in a process requiring pectinesterase activity. srf <dig> could play a role in the defense response against pathogenic fungi. expression profiling of srf <dig> also raises the possibility that this gene may be involved in stress-related processes including responses to heat and light. the srf <dig> and srf <dig> single mutants, and srf <dig> srf <dig> double mutants, were subjected to a set of heat-stress-related assays. however, no aberrant phenotypes were detected at the plant level . the lack of phenotype may be due to remaining wild type srf <dig> and srf <dig> activities in those lines . it is still possible, however, that srf <dig> or srf <dig> mutants exhibit defects that can only be detected by biochemical or cell biological assays.

the go-term analysis of srf <dig> raises the possibility that srf <dig> may act in primary cell wall biosynthesis and processes requiring cellulose synthase activity. srf <dig> may be involved in sterol biosynthesis. perhaps this explains the seedling lethality in 35s::srf <dig> plants as sterol biosynthesis is required for embryo and seedling development  <cit> . recently, evidence emerged indicated a link between sterol biosynthesis, cellulose synthesis and the building of a cell wall  <cit> . future experiments will test some of these indicators regarding srf function.

CONCLUSIONS
we studied the function of the lrr-v/srf gene family encoding putative lrr-rlks. the genetic analysis of srf <dig> indicates a function in the control of leaf size. with the exception of plants defective in sub/scm and srf <dig> activity, srf single mutants, and several double-mutant combinations, did not show obvious phenotypes making it difficult to infer gene function. results from sequence comparisons and global srf coexpression analyses are compatible with the view that redundancy among members does not play a major role in this gene family. new assays for srf function need to take into account novel information obtained from various sources. for example, the bioinformatic analysis of microarray expression profiles and go term enrichments among coexpressed genes raises the possibility that some of the srf genes may relate to several aspects of cell wall biology. this work provides a basis for future analysis of srf function.
