BACKGROUND
broiler chickens are heat sensitive animals. however, their cardiovascular and respiratory organs, and hence their capacity to lose heat via thermoregulatory pathways, have not increased in the same proportions as muscle mass through the 60- year selection process  <cit> . as poultry production is now widely developed in countries with hot climates such as south america and south east asia, it is of interest to find new rearing strategies to enhance their thermotolerance  <cit> . one strategy is to increase the incubation temperature of embryos cyclically in order to induce long-term changes in thermotolerance  <cit> , and several timings and durations of temperature increases have been tested for this purpose . a recent study has shown that increasing the incubation temperature from  <dig>  to  <dig>  °c and relative humidity from  <dig> to 65 % from days  <dig> to  <dig> of embryogenesis for 12 h/d changed body temperature, physiology and parameters of thyroid and adrenal axes, as well as respiratory parameters and stress levels of birds after hatching  <cit> . this strategy had positive consequences on surviving a heat challenge at slaughter age, i.e. when birds are the most sensitive to heat  <cit> . however, the molecular determinants of acquisition of such thermotolerance are poorly understood  <cit> . some regulatory pathways controlling the plasticity of the central nervous system  <cit>  and epigenetic mechanisms affecting the expression of genes such as the brain derived neurotrophic factor  have been described in postnatal heat-conditioned broilers  <cit> . it has also been suggested that thermal manipulation during embryogenesis could affect the metabolic rate of chickens  <cit> , and hence their heat production capacity  <cit> . as the total muscle mass is an essential contributor to the overall heat production in meat-type chickens, we investigated the molecular mechanisms in the tissue that may potentially contribute to the greater adaptability of tm chickens manipulated as embryos when submitted to heat challenge at  <dig> d.

RESULTS
in this study,  <dig> eggs were incubated in control conditions  or in thermally-manipulated conditions . control eggs were maintained at  <dig>  °c and 56 % relative humidity  during the whole incubation period. thermal manipulation was applied at  <dig>  °c and 65 % rh for 12 h/ <dig>  from day  <dig> to day  <dig> of embryogenesis. at hatching, chickens were reared in a classical pen farm until d <dig>  on d <dig> half the c  and half the tm  were exposed to heat challenge at 32 °c for 5 h. eight animals from each treatment, characterized by low body temperatures  in tm chickens and high tb in c birds, were slaughtered and the breast muscle was excised, snap-frozen and used for the transcriptomic analysis.

quality of data acquisition
in this study, the quality of arrays was found to be good since the expression levels of the control spots present on each slide were similar to those expected and the background noise was relatively low. furthermore, the arrays were not spotted with single probes and  <dig>  of them were repeated at least once . most repeated probes corresponding to the same differentially expressed gene with the same annotation  were consistently regulated between treatments.

numbers of de genes in each comparison
differentially expressed genes in the four comparisons are represented in a venn diagram . our results revealed  <dig> de genes when comparing tm chickens to controls, but  <dig> de genes when comparing tmhc to tm and  <dig> de genes when comparing chc to c. however, no de gene was found between pm muscles of tmhc and chc chickens. few genes  were common between two comparisons, and none was common to the three comparisons. the variance of gene expression was the lowest in the tmhc/tm and tm/c comparisons and the highest in the tmhc/chc comparison . however, the numbers of upregulated and down-regulated genes were not different within each comparison .fig.  <dig> venn diagram representing the numbers of de genes in each comparison and de genes common to several comparisons. no gene was found to be differentially expressed between the three comparisons. chickens were either incubated and reared in standard conditions , thermally manipulated during embryogenesis and reared in standard conditions , incubated in standard conditions and exposed to heat challenge at d  <dig>  or thermally manipulated during embryogenesis and exposed to heat challenge at d  <dig>

real-time pcr validation of a subset of differentially expressed genes arising from the microarray analysis
the expression of  <dig> de genes selected in the tm/c comparison , the in chc/c comparison  and the tmhc/tm comparison  was analysed by real-time quantitative pcr . in the tm/c comparison , nine of  <dig> genes were confirmed as de, of which six genes  were upregulated or down-regulated with both techniques, whereas the three remaining de genes  were upregulated in tm with microarray and down-regulated in tm with pcr . in the chc/c comparison , the significant difference between treatments was validated for four genes , all with consistent patterns of expression between qpcr and array results. finally, in the tmhc/tm comparison ,  <dig> out of  <dig> genes showed consistent expression difference between treatments with both techniques  but the difference was significantly  validated by pcr for only seven of them.fig.  <dig> comparisons of gene expression from microarray and qrt-pcr analysis. empty bars represent the log <dig> ratio obtained from microarray analysis and filled bars represent this value obtained by qrt-pcr. †: p <  <dig> ; *: p <  <dig> ; **p <  <dig> ; ***p <  <dig> . a log <dig> ratios obtained by comparing chickens thermally manipulated during embryogenesis and reared in standard conditions  to control chickens incubated and reared in standard conditions . b log <dig> ratios obtained by comparing control chickens submitted to a heat challenge at day  <dig>  to c chickens. c log <dig> ratios obtained by comparing tm chickens submitted to a heat challenge at day  <dig>  to tm chickens. eme <dig>  essential meiotic endonuclease  <dig> homolog 2; coq6: coenzyme q <dig> homolog, monooxygenase; mcat: malonyl coa:acp acyltransferase; mrpl28: mitochondrial ribosomal protein l28; adhfe1: alcohol dehydrogenase, iron containing, 1; tmem111: transmembrane protein 111; tbce: tubulin folding cofactor e; b-g: v-region-like b-g antigen-like; scn5a: sodium channel, voltage-gated, type v, alpha subunit, transcript variant 4; cib2: calcium and integrin binding family member 2; pten: phosphatase and tensin homolog; ttn: titin; obscn: obscurin, cytoskeletal calmodulin and titin-interacting rhogef; hsp90aa1: heat shock protein 90 kda alpha , class a member 1; pdk4: pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 4; serpinh1: serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade h , member 1; ubb: ubiquitin b; col12a1: collagen, type xii, alpha 1; dusp8: dual specificity phosphatase 8; arrdc4: arrestin domain containing 4; enc1: ectodermal-neural cortex 1; hdac1: histone deacetylase 1; birc5: baculoviral iap repeat-containing  <dig> ; hsp70a2: heat shock protein  <dig> a2; sirt1: sirtuin 1; polr2d: polymerase  ii  polypeptide d; spp1: secreted phosphoprotein 1; txnrd2: thioredoxin reductase 2

chc/c comparison
one hundred and twenty-eight genes were differentially expressed in the pm muscle between chc and c birds. fifty-six, among which half were common to the tmhc/tm comparison, were associated with metabolic regulation ,  <dig> were associated with the stress response , seven are related to rna metabolism and splicing , six to the steroid hormone response  and six to the regulation of protein metabolism . the ten most highly upregulated and down-regulated genes in the chc/c comparison are reported in table  <dig> table  <dig> functions of differentially expressed chc/c genes in pectoralis major muscle



tmhc/tm comparison
a much higher number of de genes were found in this comparison, among which the largest groups were involved in metabolic processes , macromolecule metabolism  and the stress response . other de genes in this comparison were associated with the organization of organelles , the cell cycle , rna metabolism and splicing , proteolytic metabolism , chromatin organization , vascularization and the regulation of arterial pressure , endopeptidase activity , skeletal muscle development  and monocarboxylic acid metabolism . among these, most of the groups shared fewer than 10 % de genes in common with the chc/c comparison. the genes included in the ontology items related to chromatin organization, skeletal muscle development, vascularization and the regulation of arterial pressure  were specific to the comparison between both tm groups. the ten most highly upregulated and down-regulated genes in the tmhc/tm comparison are summarized in table  <dig> table  <dig> functions of differentially expressed tmhc/tm genes in pectoralis major muscle



clustering
genes that were de in at least one comparison were clustered to visualize similar expression profiles . the clustering of de genes resulted in seven clusters with similar expression profiles between conditions with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes per group for clusters  <dig> to  <dig>  respectively. clusters  <dig> and  <dig> presented genes over expressed in c compared to tm and in tmhc compared to tm, respectively. cluster  <dig> was especially interesting as de genes in this cluster exhibited opposite responses of c and tm chickens to heat challenge. in contrast, both c and tm in clusters  <dig> and  <dig> showed similar responses to heat challenge, being respectively downregulated and upregulated compared to their respective controls. gene classification by clustering also enabled to determine the upstream regulator responsible for the expression profile. upstream regulators per cluster are presented in additional file  <dig> fig.  <dig> clusters resulting from the hierarchical clustering of de genes using pearson correlation coefficient. seven clusters were obtained from the expression profiles of de genes in at least one comparison. chickens were incubated and reared in standard conditions , thermally manipulated during embryogenesis and reared in standard conditions , incubated in standard conditions and exposed to heat challenge at d  <dig>  or thermally manipulated during embryogenesis and exposed to heat challenge at d  <dig> . clusters were generated with mev software



discussion
the aim of this study was to determine the long-lasting effects of, tm during chicken embryogenesis associated with lower body temperatures, and of a subsequent heat challenge, on muscle gene expression in 34-day-old broilers. in standard rearing conditions , tm significantly modified the expression of only  <dig> genes, demonstrating a relatively low impact of this embryonic treatment on muscle gene expression under control conditions. however, the heat challenge changed gene expression profiles in tm broilers to a much greater extent than in control birds, with  <dig> and  <dig> genes differentially expressed between tmhc and chc, respectively. this result might reflect better adaptability of tm chickens characterized by low tb to respond to acute heat challenge. in our conditions, we did not find any de genes in the tmhc/chc comparison, probably partly due to the higher variance of expression reported in this comparison than that in the others. indeed, exposure to high temperature may have triggered differences between animal responses, inducing more variability in production traits, but also in gene expressions. such hypothesis was suggested by debut et al.  <cit>  considering variations of chicken technological meat quality in relation to preslaughter stress conditions. consistently, previous results indicated around 20 % higher coefficients of variation in the expression of candidate genes in the muscle of birds in the fed state submitted or not to heat at 5 weeks of age  <cit> .

a recent study analysing the effects of chronic heat on global muscle gene expression in 28-day-old chickens  <cit>  revealed only two de genes that were also de in the present analysis: ubiquitin c  and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-like protein  that were upregulated during the heat challenge . ubc is involved in proteolysis via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, a biological process activated by high ambient temperature, whether directly or as a consequence of reduced feed intake  <cit> . pdk <dig> is a protein located in the matrix of mitochondria that inhibits the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex by phosphorylating one of its subunits, thereby contributing to the regulation of glucose metabolism  <cit> . interestingly, glucose metabolism was previously demonstrated to be affected by heat exposure in broiler chickens, suggesting a lower capacity of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake or delayed response kinetics under heat conditions  <cit> . among the de genes responding to heat challenge conditions in both control and thermal manipulated chickens, genes involved in cell signalling and the cell stress response were found in particular. the most down-regulated gene was cirbp  that was common in the chc/c and tmhc/tm comparisons. this gene is involved in the regulation of the circadian clock and its expression has already been shown to be upregulated in mice exposed to hypothermia conditions  <cit> , and downregulated when germ cells were exposed to elevated temperatures  <cit> . in our study, fam188-b2-like was another gene that was highly regulated in response to heat. its expression was increased in controls and decreased in tm in response to heat. this gene may be an interesting marker for thermotolerance but its function is not yet known and requires further analysis.

changes in energy metabolism, muscle growth and development
piestun et al.  <cit>  showed that o <dig> consumption decreased after tm of chicken embryos, suggesting a lower intensity of energy metabolism and subsequent metabolic heat production in tm birds. furthermore, thyroid hormones involved in the regulation of these pathways  <cit>  have been reported to be modified by tm in standard rearing conditions  <cit> . in the tm/c comparison, four de genes are involved in mitochondrial energy production . tbl1x, which was upregulated in the muscle of tm chickens, encodes transducin, a subunit of the transcriptional corepressor smrt  complex that also includes histone deacetylase  <dig> protein  <cit> . the increased expression of tbl1x may be a long-term response to tm, contributing to reduced mitochondrial energy metabolism and subsequent metabolic heat production. moreover, local muscle thyroid metabolism investigated by deiodinase expression seemed to be affected in 34-day-old broilers  <cit> . consequently, tm may have induced a decrease in both the peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism and the thyroid hormone receptor availability, possibly resulting in lower energy metabolism and heat production. moreover, we observed in a previous study that tm during embryogenesis induced a long-term decrease in pgc-1α  under standard conditions  <cit> . in addition, mcat expression was reduced in tm compared to c, possibly decreasing the oxidation of pyruvate. mcat has been shown to be involved in the activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in the mitochondrial oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate into acetyl-coa, which is then integrated in the citric acid cycle. interestingly, mcat-deficient mice were found leaner that controls, exhibited hypothermia and diminished activity of the citric acid cycle and energy metabolism  <cit> . furthermore, coq <dig> expression in the muscle was decreased in tm compared to c chickens. coq <dig> is required for the biosynthesis of coq <dig> which is an essential component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. taken together, these results suggest that tm chickens characterized by low tb may have lower respiratory chain activity and thus decreased heat production. another marker of mitochondrial activity involved in mitochondrial proteosynthesis, mrpl <dig>  was significantly decreased by tm. mrpl <dig> knockdown has been reported to induce a decrease in mitochondrial activity in pancreatic tumour cells  <cit> . these findings corroborate the hypothesis of decreased metabolic activity in tm birds in standard rearing conditions, thus reducing metabolic heat production.fig.  <dig> summary of interactions between genes differentially expressed between tm and c muscles in relation to mitochondrial functioning. genes highlighted in red and green were up- and down-regulated in tm compared to c muscles, respectively. gene names are indicated in capitals according to gene ontology. chickens were incubated and reared in standard conditions  or thermally manipulated during embryogenesis and reared in standard conditions . coq6: coenzyme q <dig> homolog, monooxygenase; coq10: coenzyme q <dig> homolog; hdac: histone deacetylase; tbl1x: transducin -like 1x-linked; smrt: silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid receptors; th: thyroid hormone; thr: thyroid hormone receptor; pdh: pyruvate dehydrogenase; mcat: malonyl coa:acp acyltransferase; mrpl28: mitochondrial ribosomal protein l28; tb: body temperature



in addition to these modifications of gene expression in muscle associated with tm treatment, changes in gene response resulting from heat challenge during the whole life span were observed. heat exposure of broilers is reported to result in several physiological and behavioural changes intended to restore homeostasis by reducing their resting metabolic rate  <cit> . to cope with high environmental temperatures, broilers tend to increase thermolysis and to down-regulate heat-producing pathways. muscles are able to exhibit differential gene expression profiles in response to heat exposure, due to their involvement in metabolic heat production explained by their relative mass to body weight . in the gene ontology study, the two most important categories in the tmhc/tm comparison were “macromolecule metabolism” and the “metabolic process”, with  <dig> and  <dig> de genes, respectively. for instance, one of the most strongly down-regulated genes in this comparison was slc25a <dig>  an atp/mg2+ pi transporter involved in energy efficiency that is highly overexpressed in the skeletal muscle of ucp1-deficient mice under cold conditions  <cit> .

furthermore, relatively high numbers of mrna samples encoding mitochondrial trna synthases or ribosomal proteins were found to be down-regulated in the tmhc/tm comparison , which could contribute to limitations in synthesis of mitochondrial protein  specifically in tm birds characterized by low tb in response to heat exposure. thermal manipulation during embryogenesis thus may have an effect on the expression  of a significant number of metabolic genes in pm muscle, possibly regulating metabolic heat production and thus allowing birds to better adapt to high environmental temperatures.

parallel with these metabolic adaptations, the mechanisms regulating muscle growth and development seemed to be affected in tm broilers displaying low tb. previous studies also suggested that tm increases breast muscle yield  <cit>  and regulates pathways involved in muscle growth and development  <cit> . in the tm/c comparison, we observed the up-regulation of genes potentially associated with increased muscle mass  or the down-regulation of a gene  associated with muscle wasting  <cit> . tm during embryogenesis performed under our conditions may therefore have had a lasting effect on energy metabolism and heat production, thus modifying muscle growth and development. these modifications may limit heat-producing mechanisms when chickens are exposed to high temperatures at slaughter age, while preserving muscle growth.

modifications of vascularization
recent studies have hypothesized that tm may affect vascularization in the chicken in the long term, or may adapt chicken vascularization to facilitate heat loss during heat challenge  <cit> . pinchuk et al.  <cit>  observed that tm enhanced the vascular density of the chorio-allantoic membrane  during development, and increased the expression of angiogenic genes . interestingly, our study also showed that tm chickens characterized by low tb developed pathways involved in vascularization and angiogenesis.

at 21 °c, we found three pro-angiogenic upregulated genes in the tm compared to c chickens . even in standard rearing conditions, an increase in the expression of pro-angiogenic genes might prepare chickens for further environmental temperature changes by modifying vascularization properties to facilitate heat dissipation as an adaptive mechanism.

in agreement with this, this pathway also seemed to be specifically affected by heat challenge in tm animals displaying low tb. indeed, during acute heat stress,  <dig> de genes in the tmhc/tm comparison are involved in angiogenesis and vascularization, with only one gene in common with the chc/c comparison. this result suggests that angiogenesis and/or vascularization were modified when tm chickens were exposed to heat challenge, further favouring heat dissipation. blood circulation from skeletal muscle to the skin may be critical to ensuring sensible heat loss. within the upregulated genes,  <dig> are directly involved in angiogenesis and vascularization . another group of eight upregulated de genes is involved in reorganisation of the extracellular matrix . the ecm has an important role in angiogenesis by providing the structural support necessary for blood vessel formation and supplying several endogenous pro- and anti-angiogenic factors that regulate endothelial cell survival and vessel stability  <cit> . a higher level of expression of genes involved in ecm reorganisation may thus facilitate expansion of vascularization in tm chickens.

when comparing the upstream regulators of tmhc/tm and chc/c de gene lists using ingenuity pathway analysis , the protein regulator vascular endothelial growth factor  was found to be a predicted activated upstream regulator of  <dig> genes specific to the tmhc/tm gene list . vegf is a cellular signal protein that stimulates vasculogenesis and angiogenesis by activating proliferation and migration of endothelial cells  <cit> . the expression of this gene is increased in the chorio-allantoic membrane of tm embryos  <cit> . the data also supported a strong involvement of the transforming growth factor β <dig>  pathway, as this gene was an upstream regulator of  <dig> genes in the tmhc/tm list and of  <dig> genes of the chc/c list . tgfβ <dig> is involved in the formation of new functional microvascular networks  <cit> .

altogether, these results indicate that tm associated with low tb induced changes in the regulation of broiler vascularization and angiogenesis, observed under standard rearing conditions , and following heat stress  when it could favour a vasomotor response to heat.

stress response and apoptosis
this study also revealed changes in pathways regulating stress responses and apoptosis in tm chickens characterized by low tb. indeed, p2rx <dig>  a purinergic receptor, was downregulated in tm chickens compared to c chickens. a reduction in chronic and acute pain was observed in p2rx4-/- mice  <cit> , and such downregulation may have resulted in lower sensitivity of tm broilers to heat, thus minimizing the effects of high ambient temperature, especially in the pm muscle.

when performing the gene ontology analysis, the stress response was a significant pathway in both comparisons of heat challenged chickens and their controls . the expression of  <dig> heat shock proteins  and chaperone proteins was modified in the tmhc/tm comparison, whereas expression of only three hsp was modified in chc/c. these proteins act as chaperone proteins protecting cell integrity from heat stress and protein degradation. the expression of hsp90ab <dig> was considerably lower in tmhc than in tm birds, as confirmed by real time rt-pcr. a polymorphism in this gene has been associated with heat tolerance in indigenous thai cattle  <cit> . in the tmhc/tm de gene list related to the stress response category,  <dig> genes are anti-apoptotic while  <dig> are pro-apoptotic. in the chc/c list, six have been shown to have an anti-apoptotic effect and nine a pro-apoptotic effect. these results suggest that tm chickens characterized by lower body temperature than c chickens may have lower heat-sensitivity and be better adapted to heat, and have developed chaperone protection and enhanced anti-apoptotic pathways under heat stress. in addition to having pathways regulating metabolism, vascularization and cell fate, epigenetic pathways in tm animals displaying low tb were particularly affected by heat challenge.

epigenetic mechanisms as a molecular basis for differences in gene expression
the tmhc/tm comparison revealed  <dig> de genes compared to  <dig> in the chc/c comparison. one hypothesis to explain this difference is that tm animals that had already experienced heat during the incubation period, could have setup more diverse or more reactive adaptive mechanisms than control birds during their development, improving their adaptive capacity while later submitted to heat challenge. the first experience of heat, during embryogenesis, may have modified the threshold response to heat or have induced better plasticity to heat response in later life  <cit> . in this study, we observed differential expression of  <dig> genes involved in chromatin organization, remodelling and gene silencing specific to the tmhc/tm comparison. most of them are involved in modifications of chromatin conformation . these epigenetic modifiers were specifically affected by heat challenge in tm animals, but not in controls. this possible remodelling induced by heat exposure during embryogenesis may have modified the dynamics of chromatin architecture to allow access of the regulatory transcription machinery, thereby controlling gene expression to favour efficient response of tm birds to heat. the details of these mechanisms remain to be elucidated. however, chromatin modification has already been shown to be responsible for metabolic plasticity in response to environmental changes, thus permitting rapid adaptation of physiological processes  <cit> . thermal manipulation and possibly the later heat challenge may have modified the chromatin landscape compared to the controls, since metabolic and environmental stimuli have been shown to have critical roles in determining chromatin structure  <cit> . thermal manipulation applied  <dig> d post-hatch in chicks has been reported to induce modification of the expression of bdnf , which encodes a key regulator of thermotolerance in the chick hypothalamus  <cit> . this was associated with epigenetic modifications such as changes in the methylation level of cpg sites in the promoter of the bdnf gene. modification of histone h <dig> lysine  <dig>  and methylation of histone h <dig> lysine  <dig>  in the promoter of bdnf occurred in these conditions, probably changing the threshold response to heat  <cit> .

in the present experiment,  <dig> de genes in the tmhc/tm comparison are involved in mrna metabolic processing, transcription degradation and splicing, which could further control gene expression in tm birds characterized by low tb when exposed to heat.

cluster analysis and potential upstream regulators
the cluster study revealed potential upstream regulators for the group profile . interestingly, for cluster  <dig> , forkhead box protein m <dig>  was a candidate upstream regulator displaying a highly significant p-value of overlap . foxm- <dig> has already been involved in thermal resistance in humans  <cit> . cluster  <dig>  exhibiting opposite responses of c and tm chickens to heat challenge, comprised only  <dig> genes. the upstream analysis of this cluster revealed immune system cytokines as regulators of some of the genes: tnf for  <dig> genes, il1- β for  <dig> genes and il <dig> for  <dig> genes. a recent study demonstrated that heat-stress inhibited tnf-α and il1-β expression and increased interleukins il- <dig> and il- <dig> expression in the muscle, as an innate immune response to heat  <cit> . immune or inflammatory responses to heat stress may have been modified in tm broilers that had already experienced heat exposure during embryogenesis, probably changing the expression of downstream genes.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we identified long-term modifications of physiological regulators induced by tm during embryogenesis and a subsequent effect of heat challenge in the pm muscle of 34-day-old broilers. the results of this study indicated new pathways involved in heat adaptation of tm chickens characterized by low body temperature. first of all, our results in broiler chickens reared in standard conditions corroborate the hypothesis of reduced energy metabolism in the pm muscle of tm chickens compared to controls. expression of pro-angiogenic genes was also triggered in the muscles of these chickens, probably facilitating a vasomotor response and hence heat loss, especially during later heat challenge. in these conditions, tm broilers also greatly modified the overall muscle expression profile compared to controls, probably partly due to epigenetic modifications and active rna splicing. metabolic process and stress-responsive pathways were particularly affected in tm birds displaying low body temperatures under heat exposure by improving physiological adaptation processes and preserving cell integrity in the muscle. further studies are required in order to elucidate the function of new thermotolerance markers in the muscle and in other tissues involved in thermoregulatory and metabolic programming.
