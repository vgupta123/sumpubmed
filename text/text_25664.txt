BACKGROUND
beta-thalassemia is one of the most common genetic diseases in the world. it is an autosomal recessive inherited disease resulting from point mutations, small insertions, or deletions in the beta-globin  gene  <cit> . over  <dig> mutations have been described in the hbb gene, of which more than  <dig> are associated with a beta-thalassemia phenotype  <cit> . the wide diversity of mutations in the hbb genes makes mutation screening time-consuming and expensive. in the southeast asian population, the common beta-thalassemia mutations include c.- <dig> a>g, c. <dig> t>a, c. <dig> a>t, c.84_ <dig> insc, c.125_ <dig> deltctt, c. <dig> g>t, c.216_ <dig> insa, and c.316- <dig> c>t  <cit> .

a wide variety of methods for genotyping the hbb gene have been developed using different detection techniques based on different principles  <cit> , including allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization   <cit> , amplification refractory mutation system   <cit> , allele-specific pcr  <cit> , reverse dot blot  <cit> , restriction fragment length polymorphism   <cit> , single base extension   <cit> , and others  <cit> . these methods, however, are limited to the study of hotspot or known mutations. additionally, single-strand conformation polymorphism   <cit> , denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis   <cit> , temporal temperature gel electrophoresis   <cit> , are efficient techniques to screen for unknown mutations. the advantage of these methods above is that it is inexpensive and suitable for large-scale research applications. however, its major disadvantage is lower detection rates. recently, chemical cleavage of mismatch   <cit>  analysis has been reported to be a promising tool for mutation detection with advantages of accuracy, simplicity, and cost effectiveness, but it involves the use of toxic chemicals.

enzymatic mismatch cleavage methods have been around for some time and include the use of t <dig> endonuclease vii  <cit> , endonuclease v   <cit> , mung bean nuclease  <cit> , s <dig> nuclease  <cit> , and cel i nuclease  <cit> . there are growing numbers of publications describing the use of mismatch-specific endonuclease in the mutation discovery methods known as tilling and ecotilling  <cit> .

in this study, we used the mismatch-specific endonuclease method to detect disease-causing mutations in the hbb gene. the method was modified by amplifying the pcr products using three primers in the hbb gene labeled at 5' ends with fluorescent dyes. the results obtained using the mismatch-specific endonuclease method were compared with findings using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography .

RESULTS
detection of hbb mutations by the mismatch-specific endonuclease method
chemical cleavage of mismatch  is a highly specific and sensitive method to induce mismatch-cleavages  <cit> . however, the major disadvantage of ccm is the use of toxic chemicals during the process in the reactions or buffers, which could be avoided by using enzymatic mismatch cleavage. the celery enzyme is a member of a family of plant endonucleases that recognizes mismatches in heteroduplex dna and cleaves both strands on the 3' side of the mismatch distortion  <cit> . to investigate the diagnostic value of this approach, the exons of hbb genes were amplified by pcr using primers labeled at the 5' end with fluorescent dyes . we also employed a simple method to detect mutations in hbb genes using the mismatch-specific endonuclease cleavage and separation of the pcr products by capillary electrophoresis. the approach is based on mismatch-specific selective reactions of mismatched dna cleavage by endonuclease and separation of the pcr product fragments by capillary electrophoresis. this method is also adaptable to automated capillary electrophoresis which could increase its speed, sensitivity, and reproducibility, making it suitable for large-scale and high-throughput mutation screening.

we detected all the dna variants of the hbb gene including single base substitutions and deletions of tctt. the different mutation sites and the expected sizes of pcr products cleaved by mismatch-specific endonuclease are described in table  <dig>  samples of variant dna fragments obtained with different base pairs were analyzed using capillary electrophoresis and the results are shown in figure  <dig> 

the pcr fragment amplified by the b <dig> and b <dig> primers was  <dig> bp; this fragment was cut into fragments of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp by mismatch-specific endonuclease indicatingthe presence of c.- <dig> a>g mutation . similar to the c.- <dig> a>g variation, the common c. <dig> c>t single nucleotide polymorphism  of the pcr fragment was cleaved to  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp .

the fam- and hex-labeled probes had the same sensitivity and specificity and could be used for double confirmation of the results. the formation of new cleavage products indicated the presence of variation, while their size provided some information about their location in the entire gene . the two variations could be also determined by the mismatch-specific endonuclease method as shown in figure  <dig>  the  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp, and  <dig> bp cutting by mismatch-specific endonuclease represented the presence of compound heterozygous variations  . similarly, the  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp, and  <dig> bp due to c. <dig> c>t polymorphism combined with the c. <dig> a>t variation . the other dna substitutions were identified by following this principle to predict the locations of the mutation sites. this technique could be the gold standard for the identification of healthy carriers, while for the diagnosis of affected patients direct sequencing probably remains the best approach, also considering the small size of hbb gene.

detection of hbb mutations by dhplc
dhplc is a promising tool for mutations detection and gene quantification  <cit> . previously, we developed a powerful and rapid pcr-dhplc assay for detection of hbb mutations  <cit> . however, dhplc had better sensitivity and specificity in the analysis of heteroduplexes in pcr fragments shorter than  <dig> bp. in an attempt to increase sensitivity, we modified and optimized the pcr primers and dhplc conditions for this study , providing a significant advantage to this technique. the modified assay was used for identification of various genotypes of the hbb gene  which were confirmed by direct sequencing.

hbb genes could contain one or more mutations that could affect the results of dhplc. this results in complex chromatography as shown in figure  <dig>  and failure to easily determine the genotype.

discussion
heteroduplex analysis based on dhplc and mismatch-specific endonuclease with capillary electrophoresis both have the ability to detect unknown mutations. at present, direct sequencing is the gold standard and its use with multi-capillary electrophoresis, allows for high-throughput automation. direct sequencing analysis is almost 100% sensitive for the detection of point mutations, small insertions, and deletions. the greatest advantage of dhplc is its high sensitivity. this method shows small changes in peak chromatography according to differences in hydrophoretic mobility between heteroduplex and homoduplex dna with high reproducibility. the main advantage of the mismatch-specific endonuclease cleavage method is that it can determine the locations of mutations with good sensitivity and without the use of toxic chemicals. nonetheless, because it uses fluorescence technology, it is more expensive to run. in the present study, we were able to unambiguously identify all of the genotypes in hbb variants by either of these methods with 100% sensitivity and specificity.

dhplc, direct sequencing, and mismatch-specific endonuclease cleavage all require pcr amplification prior to screening. thus, the major time factor is the machine run time. the dhplc method can efficiently analyze one pcr product within  <dig> min. while the mismatch-specific endonuclease method reactions used in this study required single runs on a single capillary electrophoresis machine, 96-capillary sequencers are available that can be used for mismatch-specific endonuclease cleavage and direct sequencing. the 96-capillary machine can process more samples per hour than a dhplc machine  <cit> .

we calculated the costs of the screening at approximately $ <dig> per patient for two different exons using dhplc analysis and another $ <dig> for direct sequencing. the cost of the mismatch-specific endonuclease e cleavage mutation detection was calculated at about $ <dig> per exon, thus it cost approximately $ <dig> per patient for two exons.

in the case where a mutation and polymorphism occur in the same pcr amplicon, the variable polymorphism may affect the dhplc profile and running conditions ; however, the two mutations could be determined by mismatch-specific endonuclease because the mismatch-specific endonuclease cleavage method can accurately identify the base variant and its location . nonetheless, the mismatch-specific endonuclease cleavage method is more time consuming and complicated because it requires fam- and hex-labeled primers. dhplc is very simple and rapid and uses unlabeled primers. data interpretations are easy with both the mismatch-specific endonuclease method and dhplc. these two methodologies cannot detect large deletions or duplications in genotypes, however, unless multiplex pcr is designed for dhplc or capillary electrophoresis  <cit> . on the other hand, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification   <cit>  is more generally used to detect large deletions causing beta-thalassemia  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the mismatch-specific endonuclease method for beta-thalassemia mutations detection is merely as a model for other  disease genes for which large scale, high-throughput mutation scanning. this study demonstrated that the mismatch-specific endonuclease method was not only a comparatively faster procedure but was also significantly superior to dhplc as a tool for gene mutation identification. the method is feasible for use in high-throughput systems due to an automated injection. this method is thus well suited for screening and may also reduce costs.
