BACKGROUND
the smn protein forms a stable complex with a group of proteins named gemins . the gemins colocalize with smn in gems/cajal bodies  and are also present throughout the cytoplasm and in the nucleoplasm  <cit> , although gemin <dig> has also been reported in the nucleolus  <cit> . an early view of the structure of the smn complex was that gemins  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bind directly to smn, while gemins  <dig> and  <dig> associated by interaction with gemins  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively  <cit> . it was later shown that a novel protein, gemin <dig>  mediates the binding to smn of the subcomplex of gemins  <dig> and  <dig> and a protein called unrip  <cit> . a recent study suggests that smn interacts directly only with gemins  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  while the subcomplex of gemin <dig> with gemin <dig> binds through gemin <dig>  unrip binds through gemin <dig>  gemin <dig> binds through gemin <dig>  and gemin <dig> binds to both gemins  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . smn complexes clearly have an important and well-documented role in both assembly of cytoplasmic snrnps and their transport to the nucleus  <cit> . however, a significant amount of smn is also found in the cytoplasm of motor neuron axons, suggesting that smn may have motor neuron-specific functions independent of snrnp assembly  <cit> .

immunopurification of a 300-kda smn-gemin <dig> complex showed that it also contained spliceosomal snrnp core proteins b/b', d <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig>  e, f and g  <cit> . there is some controversy in the literature on whether there is an smn interaction site for sm core proteins near the c-terminus  or at residues 120– <dig> in the exon3-encoded tudor domain  <cit> . charroux et al  <cit>  described an  <dig> kda complex that included smn, gemin <dig> and gemins  <dig> and  <dig>  gemins  <dig> and  <dig> were also found without smn in a separate 15s complex that contains eukaryotic initiation factor 2c and numerous micrornas  <cit> . meister et al  <cit>  isolated two distinct smn complexes from hela nuclei, nsc <dig> and nsc <dig>  that migrated in sucrose gradients at 20s and 18s respectively. nsc <dig> was u snrna-free, but contained at least  <dig> proteins, including smn, gemin <dig>  gemins  <dig> and  <dig> and sm proteins d <dig>  d <dig> and f. they later described a complex in both nucleus and cytoplasm that contains all gemins and sm core proteins, plus unrip and hsc <dig>  <cit> . unrip is an interacting partner of unr, a cytoplasmic rna binding protein involved in the translation of viral rnas  <cit> .

the functions of individual proteins in smn complexes and how they contribute to the overall function of the complex remains unclear. a role for gemin <dig> in the oligomerization of the smn complex was recently shown  <cit> . gemin <dig> is a  <dig> kda rna helicase that binds to epstein-barr virus-encoded nuclear antigens  <cit> . its binding partner, gemin <dig>  binds to protein phosphatase  <dig>  overexpression of which can affect the localization of newly formed snrnps in hela cells  <cit>  and smn phosphorylation is important for u snrnp assembly  <cit> . gemin <dig> was also found to interact with galectins  <dig> and  <dig>  which are involved in mrna splicing  <cit> . gemin <dig> has thirteen wd domains which, in other proteins, form "propeller" structures involved in protein-protein interactions  <cit> . gemins  <dig> and  <dig> fold together to form a structure that resembles sm core protein dimers  <cit> . it has been suggested that gemin <dig> and gemin <dig> play a role in organizing sm proteins for assembly onto snrnas by serving as an sm-like dimer surrogate around which individual sm proteins are arranged for binding to the sm site  <cit> . the gemin 6–7–8-unrip subcomplex is required for recruiting sm core proteins to smn complexes  <cit> .

we have produced novel panels of antibodies against gemins and used them to investigate the subcellular and molecular distribution of gemins in the cell. the studies have revealed a striking deficiency of gemin <dig> in nuclear gems/cbs and have shown that a large proportion of gemin <dig> exists separately from smn complexes.

RESULTS
characterization of antibodies
for this study, we produced new panels of monoclonal antibodies  against gemins  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . we also produced a new polyclonal antibody against gemin <dig> to complement mabs against smn and gemin <dig> described previously  <cit> . our first step was to demonstrate the specificity of the new antibodies by western blots of total hela cell proteins . the anti-gemin <dig> serum gave a single band close to the expected size of  <dig> kd; the gem4d mab against gemin <dig>  is shown alongside for comparison. three gemin <dig> mabs  recognise a single band, apart from non-specific bands caused by the secondary antibodies, but the other three mabs stain extra bands of higher mr. the more specific mabs were used in subsequent studies. all the gemin <dig> mabs stained a band consistent with the predicted mr of  <dig> kd. only the c-terminal gemin <dig> mabs  also stained a ladder of lower mr bands down to about  <dig> kd; this may be due to partial degradation of gemin <dig> in its n-terminal "wd-propeller" region. the n-terminal mabs  were not useful for immunolocalization because they appear to recognize only denatured and unfolded protein on western blots . in support of this, we were able to map the epitope for gem5j to amino-acids 66– <dig>  using phage-displayed peptide libraries as described previously  <cit>  and this sequence is part of the highly-structured "wd-propeller" in the native state. gemin <dig> mabs stained a protein of  <dig> kd and gemin <dig> mabs a protein of  <dig> kd, both migrating slightly faster than predicted by their amino-acid sequence. two of the gemin <dig> mabs cross-reacted with higher mr proteins, notably one of about  <dig> kd. the more specific gem6f was used in subsequent studies. we also used antibodies against other proteins known to interact with smn including fibrillarin  <cit> , unrip and profilin ii  <cit> .

by immunolocalization, gemin <dig> is absent from nuclear gems/cajal bodies in most cells
we next needed to confirm that all the gemin antibodies stained gems or cajal bodies , as previously reported, and we found that most gemins colocalize with smn in nuclear gems/cbs in hela cells, the exception being gemin <dig> . although colocalization of smn and gemin <dig> was observed in some cells , gemin <dig> was absent from gems/cbs in other cells in the same field of view . gems/cbs also lacked gemin <dig> in human ntera- <dig> cells and skin fibroblasts. this was the first indication that gemin <dig> may not always be associated with smn. although gemin <dig> mab does not stain any smn-positive gems/cbs in most nuclei, it stains the normal number of gems in the rare gemin5-positive nuclei. this "all or nothing" staining of gemin <dig> is illustrated in table  <dig> where only positive nuclei were counted and the average gem count was  <dig>  for gemin <dig> compared with  <dig> – <dig>  for smn and other gemins. to determine whether gemin <dig> is associating with gems or cbs in the rare gemin5-positive nuclei, we used the hela pv cell line in which gems and cbs are separate  and found that gemin <dig> colocalizes with smn in gems , but not with coilin in cbs .

in those rare hela cell nuclei that have gemin5-positive gems/cbs, nearly all gems/cbs were positive for gemin <dig>  hela cell cultures on glass coverslips were fixed with 50: <dig> acetone: methanol, dried and labelled individually with gemin mabs. only nuclei with positive gem/cb staining were counted.

unlike other gemins, gemin <dig> is not co-regulated with smn
smn-containing gems/cbs are increased in number and brightness in a hela cell line overexpressing smn protein, so we set out to determine whether antibody staining of these structures for gemins was also increased. gemins  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> did colocalize with smn in these up-regulated gems/cbs, but gemin <dig> was still not detected in these structures . fig. 4b shows that unrip also colocalises with the up-regulated gems/cbs and that traces of fibrillarin, a predominantly nucleolar protein, can also be detected in the up-regulated gems/cbs . fig. 4b also confirms earlier evidence  <cit>  that coilin, the marker for cajal bodies, is up-regulated in gems/cbs when smn levels are increased by transfection.

smn on western blots was decreased to 30–40% of control levels in cultured skin fibroblasts derived from an sma type i patient . most gemins were also decreased by a similar proportion, but gemin <dig> showed a smaller reduction . these reductions in sma fibroblasts were also evident by immunofluorescence microscopy . smn and most gemins showed drastically decreased levels in both nuclear gems and cytoplasm in sma fibroblasts. gemin <dig>  however, remained stable in the cytoplasm, consistent with the western blot data in fig.  <dig> and with the existence of a separate pool of gemin <dig>  independent of smn.

unlike other gemins, gemin <dig> is present mainly in the cytoplasm
we next examined the distribution of smn and gemins between nucleus and cytoplasm using a simple cell fractionation followed by western blotting . to minimise quantitation problems with x-ray film exposure, we used 100%, 50% and 25% dilutions of each extract and compared the closest match by microdensitometry. comparisons can only be reliably made between fractions of the same protein, and not between different proteins, because of possible differences in antibody avidity. in hela cells, smn and most gemins were equally distributed between nucleus and cytoplasm, but gemin <dig> was predominantly cytoplasmic. this could mean that gemin <dig> has additional smn-independent functions in the cytoplasm, but it is also possible that gemin <dig> is turned over in, or exported from, the nucleus more quickly than other gemins. hela cells are widely used for smn studies but it would be unwise to assume that they are representative of human cells in general. in the neurogenic cell line, ntera- <dig>  we found that smn and gemins were much more cytoplasmic than in hela cells. in both skin fibroblasts and ntera- <dig> cells, gems/cbs were rarely, if ever, stained by anti-gemin <dig> mabs .

on sucrose density gradient analysis, gemin <dig> is absent from smn complexes in nuclear extracts, but not in cytoplasmic extracts
the extent to which gemin <dig> and other gemins are present in complexes with smn was studied by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. we analysed a total extract of hela cells prepared using a ripa buffer and an extract separated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions using the established method of meister et al  <cit> . these experiments were repeated three times starting with fresh hela cells and a representative result is shown in fig.  <dig>  it seems likely that some detachment of proteins from the smn complexes occurs during cell lysis or fractionation with the harsher ripa or high-salt nuclear buffers. thus, no smn or gemin <dig> is seen at the top of the gradient in low-salt cytoplasmic extracts  but they are present when ripa buffer  or higher salt  are used. the mild extraction used for the cytoplasmic fraction is more likely to yield intact smn complexes  but, although most of the smn and gemins  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> sedimented in large complexes, the majority of both gemin <dig> and unrip remained in the upper part of the gradient , together with a significant proportion of gemins6/ <dig>  this would be consistent with these latter proteins having some additional functions outside smn complexes.

successful subcellular fractionation is shown by the presence of nuclear markers, such as lamin a/c, emerin, coilin p <dig> and fibrillarin, only in the nuclear fraction while profilin ii was present only in the cytoplasmic fraction. as expected, all gemins and unrip are partly present in large complexes migrating near the bottom of the sucrose gradient, whereas other nuclear protein markers, emerin and lamin a/c, remained in the upper half of the gradient. fibrillarin is clearly sedimenting in high molecular weight complexes but since most fibrillarin is in the nucleolus and very little colocalizes with smn, this material seems unlikely to represent complexes with smn. smn, however, does colocalize with fibrillarin in the nucleolus in fetal tissues  <cit>  and the possibility that smn is complexed with fibrillarin in a "masked" form  <cit>  in hela nuclei has never been ruled out. the proteins in the upper half of the gradients would be consistent in size with monomers or small homo- or hetero-oligomers. thus, gemins  <dig> and  <dig>  are in the first two fractions, while smn and gemin <dig>  co-sediment close to the 7s marker. gemin <dig>  monomers would be expected around 7s and its faster sedimentation at around 11s might be consistent with a proposed trimeric structure  <cit> .

gemin <dig> did not co-sediment at all with the large smn complexes in the nuclear extract , consistent with its absence from gems/cbs . however, the possibility that gemin <dig> detached from the complexes during fractionation cannot be ruled out. in a recent study, gemin <dig> was more easily detached by high salt than other gemins  <cit> , though this occurred at higher salt concentrations  than those used for nuclear extraction . adding extra kcl to cytoplasmic extracts to  <dig> mm did not dissociate gemin <dig> from smn , but the possibility that nuclear complexes are less stable cannot be ruled out. therefore, we have restricted our major conclusions to the clear invivo reduction of gemin <dig> in nuclear gems/cbs by immunolocalization studies , which cannot be explained by fractionation artefacts, and to the complexes present under mild extraction conditions .

gemins co-sedimenting on sucrose gradients form true complexes in which all gemins are accessible to antibody
immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to demonstrate true complex formation, as opposed to co-sedimentation on the sucrose gradients. mansma <dig> anti-smn mab pulled down gemin <dig> from cytoplasmic complexes only, in agreement with sucrose gradient data , whereas it pulled down smn itself and the gemin <dig> control from both nuclear and cytoplasmic complexes . to determine whether the absence of gemin <dig> from smn complexes in nuclear extracts was due to disruption by high salt, cytoplasmic extracts were studied after adding kcl to the same concn as the nuclear extracts and gemin <dig> was still pulled down by the anti-smn mab . to show that all gemins are accessible to antibody in smn complexes, the immunoprecipitation experiment was reversed and various anti-gemin mabs were used to pull-down endogenous smn protein from a total hela extract in ripa buffer. this extract contains both nuclear and cytoplasmic complexes, and all gemin mabs, including gemin <dig>  pulled down smn . the predictable exception was a mab that only recognizes denatured gemin <dig> on blots and would not be expected to bind native complexes. this experiment confirms that gemin <dig> in smn complexes is as accessible to antibody as the other gemins and shows that masking of gemin <dig> epitopes cannot explain the absence of gem/cb staining by gemin <dig> mabs in immunofluorescence microscopy .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
the idea that smn complexes may vary in composition is not a novel one. dreyfuss and co-workers have explained their own data in terms of a range of structures from smn-gemin <dig> heterodimers upwards  <cit> . it is also implicit in the studies of meister et al  <cit> . the possibility that compositional changes may be relevant to understanding the function of smn complexes has not, however, been fully explored, partly because the roles of the smn complex and its individual protein components are still not fully understood and partly because of the uncertainty about the stability of complexes after cell disruption for biochemical studies.

in the present study, sucrose gradient analysis has shown that smn complexes in nuclear extracts have little or no gemin <dig>  this was also noted in an earlier study  <cit> . pull-down experiments with anti-smn mab confirmed that smn is associated with gemin <dig> in cytoplasmic extracts but not in nuclear extracts. a major problem with subcellular fractionation, however, is the difficulty in ruling out possible dissociation during biochemical fractionation, with some components of smn complexes being more easily dissociated than others. in our hands, raising the salt concn in cytoplasmic extracts to  <dig> mm  did not noticeably dissociate gemin <dig> from smn and this agrees with a recent study showing that a higher concentration  is required to do this  <cit> . even so, we cannot rule out the possibility that some dissociation of smn complexes has occurred in nuclear extracts.

therefore, the observation in intact cells that gemin <dig> does not colocalize with smn and all other gemins in nuclear gems/cbs is important to show that its absence from complexes is not just an artefact of biochemical fractionation. it is significant that gemin <dig> was found in gems/cbs in a very small proportion of hela cells  and that, when present, it was present in all gems/cbs of that nucleus. this is a key observation since it shows that gemin <dig> is easily detected by immunofluorescence microscopy, when it is present. it also suggests that these minority cells may differ metabolically or phenotypically from the majority. the possibility that binding of mabs to gemin <dig> was masked by other components of the smn complex is ruled out by the fact that the same gemin <dig> mabs are as capable of immunoprecipitating smn as mabs against other gemins . overexpression of smn in a stably-transfected hela cell line increases the number and brightness of nuclear gems/cbs when stained with smn antibodies or with most other gemin antibodies, but it did not bring about increased immunostaining of gemin <dig> in gems/cbs, which we might expect if the gemin <dig> mabs were simply rather weak in immunostaining. we hypothesize that the most important role of gemin <dig> is in the cytoplasmic part of the smn cycle and that its role becomes less important once the assembled snrnps have been transported to the nucleus by the smn complex. gubitz et al  <cit>  have suggested that the wd propeller structure of the gemin <dig> n-terminal domain may act as an assembly platform for other proteins and recent reports suggest that gemin <dig> is involved in binding the snrna component for snrnp assembly  <cit> .

it is also of interest that, even in the cytoplasm, a significant proportion of the gemin <dig> is unassociated with smn complexes. this is evident both from the sucrose gradients in fig. 8b and from the fact that both cytoplasmic gemin <dig> staining and gemin <dig> levels on western blots remain strong in type i sma fibroblasts, when smn and other gemins are clearly reduced by 60–70% relative to control fibroblasts. similarly, rnai knockdown of smn had comparatively little effect on gemin <dig> levels . feng et al  <cit>  also showed that rnai knockdown of gemin <dig> did not affect gems/cbs or the levels of other smn complex components on western blots. similarly, shpargel and matera  <cit>  found that rnai knockdowns of smn or gemins  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> all disrupted sm core protein assembly, whereas knockdown of gemin <dig> had no effect. these observations are consistent with our data, though the presence of a larger cytoplasmic pool of "free" gemin <dig> could mean that a much more efficient knockdown of gemin <dig> would be required to obtain the same result as other gemin knockdowns.

an excess of "free" gemin <dig> over that required for smn complexes might imply a more general role for gemin <dig>  an interaction with eukaryotic initiation factor 4e has recently been described and a role for gemin <dig> in assembly or processing of messenger rnp complexes was suggested  <cit> . in their study, mass spectrometry did not reveal smn or any other gemins in these gemin <dig> complexes. the possibility that gemin <dig> may have a more general role in rnp assembly was raised by gubitz et al  <cit> . unrip is another wd-repeat protein, like gemin <dig>  and it also has a clearly-demonstrated role in mrna translation initiation  <cit> . a further role for unrip in assembling mrna export and transport intermediates has recently been proposed  <cit> . carissimi et al  <cit>  and grimmler et al  <cit>  also found that unrip, like gemin <dig> in the present study, was predominantly cytoplasmic and not localized in nuclear gems/cbs. our results confirm the mainly cytoplasmic distribution of unrip , but a small amount of unrip in the nuclear fraction was present in large complexes  and was detectable in nuclear gems/cbs of hela cells overexpressing smn . these differences between laboratories could be due to antibody avidity or smn expression levels and a consensus may be that both of these two wd-repeat proteins, gemin <dig> and unrip, are present at relatively low, often undetectable, levels in gems/cbs. it may be that both proteins are involved in assembling complexes of smn with rna and other proteins but are no longer essential when the complexes arrive in nuclear gems/cbs.

although smn and profilin ii interact in vitro and are both detectable in nuclear gems/cbs in neuronal cells  <cit> , we found no evidence for the presence of profilin ii in the smn-containing complexes , possibly because the interaction is weaker and profilin i may be the dominant isoform in hela cells. coilin was not found in the large smn complexes, although a methylated form can interact with smn  <cit>  and it does colocalize with nuclear smn in gems/cajal bodies in most hela cell lines. however, smn and coilin p <dig> can also form quite separate gems and cajal bodies in fetal tissues  <cit>  and coilin p <dig> is exclusively nuclear, so the result is not altogether surprising. smn complexes involve so many proteins, even the "core" complex let alone ancillary interactors, that much work remains to be done in elucidating what exactly is binding to what under different cellular conditions  <cit> . there is evidence, for example, that the activity of smn in a snrnp assembly assay can vary developmentally without changing smn levels  <cit> , though it is not known whether this requires any changes in smn complex components. the present study suggests that gemin <dig> works only "part-time" as a component of smn complexes, in the sense that they can exist without gemin <dig> and that gemin <dig> may have functions that are independent of smn complexes, though possibly involving related assembly functions. in some ways, the behaviour of gemin <dig> resembles that of another wd-repeat protein, unrip, as reported either in this study or elsewhere.
