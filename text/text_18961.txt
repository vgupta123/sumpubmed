BACKGROUND
outer membrane proteins  perform diverse functional roles, including bacterial adhesion, structural integrity of the cell wall, and material transport  <cit> . the membrane-spanning regions of omps form a characteristic β-barrel. discriminating omps from other proteins and identifying membrane spanning β-barrels in them are crucial for many studies. unlike α-helical membrane proteins, which can be easily identified based on long stretches of hydrophobic residues, omps are more difficult to predict, mainly due to shorter membrane-spanning regions with higher variations in properties  <cit> . nevertheless, several methods have been proposed for this task. gnanasekaran et al.  <cit>  used profiles developed from structure-based alignments of porins to identify omps. wimley et al.  <cit>  analyzed the structure of  <dig> non-redundant omps and developed a method to identify omps based on residue composition and structural features, such as rise-per-residue of the β strands and loop length. martelli et al.  <cit> , bagos et al.  <cit> , and bigelow and rost  <cit>  used hidden markov models  to predict the topology of omps and discriminate omps from globular proteins. liu et al.  <cit>  developed a method that combines the residue composition of membrane-spanning regions and predicted secondary structure to identify omps. natt et al.  <cit>  used artificial neural network  and support vector machine  methods to identify β-barrels in omps using primary sequence, evolutionary information and physicochemical parameters as input. their method also achieved success in discriminating omps. garrow et al.  <cit>  developed a method for discrimination of omps in genomes using k-nearest neighbor method. berven et al.  <cit>  developed the bomp method that predicts omps by combining pattern search, β-barrel score, and a filter that explores the abundance of asparagine and isoleucine in the protein. gromiha and suwa  <cit>  developed a simple statistical method to identify omps based on amino acid composition. later, they extended the approach by adding residue pair information and used a svm-based method to identify omps with improved performance  <cit> .

in this study, we propose a simple method that discriminates omps from non-omps using a weighted euclidian distance  calculated from residue composition. our results show that this method achieves  <dig> % accuracy with  <dig>  mcc. in direct comparisons, the proposed method outperforms previous published methods.

RESULTS
discrimination between omps and non-omps
for each protein, we calculated its weighted euclidean distances  to omp, inner membrane protein  and globular protein groups separately. then, proteins were classified into omp versus non-omp  classes based on the least wed. we explored three different approaches to calculate the weds:  only the protein of interest was used to calculated residue composition. then, the composition of the total  <dig> amino acids was used to calculate weds;  homologous sequences were included in the calculation of residue composition. then, the composition of the total  <dig> amino acids was used to calculate weds; and  homologous sequences were used to calculated residue composition and a feature-selection method was used to select a set of residues and di-peptides that were useful for omp prediction. then, the composition of the selected set was used to calculate weds. the results  show that approach i achieves  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig>  mcc. comparisons  show that the classification performance was gradually improved by including homologous information  and using feature selection . in the end, when approach iii is used, the method achieves  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig>  mcc.

a. the method proposed in this study. proteins were classified based on the least weighted euclidean distance .

b. for each protein, only the protein itself was used to calculate residue composition.

c. for each protein,  <dig> homologous proteins were included in the calculation of residue composition.

d. for each protein,  <dig> homologous proteins were included in the calculation of residue composition. feature-selection was used to select a set of residues and di-peptides that were useful for the prediction of omps. weighted euclidean distances were then calculated based on the composition of the selected set.

comparisons with previously published methods
we compare the proposed method with previously published methods. as discussed in baldi et al.  <cit> , in a two-class classification, if the numbers of examples in the two classes are not equal, mcc is a better measure for evaluating the classification performance. in the discrimination of omps and non-omps, the numbers of examples in the two classes are not equal. therefore, we will use mcc as the primary measure in the comparison of different methods. at the same time, we also report accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity.

bomp  <cit> , tmb-hunt  <cit>  and proftmb  <cit>  are three top-scoring on-line servers that can discriminate omps. bomp and tmb-hunt are based on the k-nearest neighbor method, and proftmb is based on a hidden markov model . we compared the proposed method with these methods by submitting the datasets used in this study to these servers. the comparisons  show that the proposed method outperforms all the other methods. it is worth to point out that the datasets used in this study are likely to have a big overlap with the datasets that were used to train bomp, tmb-hunt and proftmb servers. thus, when we evaluated these methods by submitting our datasets to their web servers, the performance of these methods might have been overestimated. remarkably, our method still outperforms the others under this condition.

researchers in suwa's group  <cit>  developed three methods for discriminating omps based on amino acid composition. here, we compare our method with theirs. in one of their studies, gromiha and suwa  <cit>  developed a simple statistical method to discriminate omps based on the least "deviation distance", which was calculated as ∑i|x¯i−xi|, where xi is the composition of residue type i in the test protein, x¯i is the average composition of residue type i in the target group . to make direct comparisons, we implemented gromiha and suwa's deviation distance method and evaluated it using the datasets used in their study. then, we repeated our method using their datasets. the comparison  shows that our method outperforms gromiha and suwa's deviation distance method. in another study, gromiha and suwa  <cit>  evaluated a set of  <dig> machine learning methods for the discrimination of omps using residue composition as input. neural network was reported to achieve the best performance among the  <dig> methods. later, researchers from the same group  <cit>  extended the approach by adding residue pair information and used a svm-based method to identify omps with improved performance. in both studies, they evaluated the methods using the same datasets that they used in the "deviation distance" study  <cit> . we compared the results they reported with the results our method achieved on their datasets. the results  show that our method outperforms the neural network methods used in gromiha and suwa's study  <cit> . it is worth to point out that although the same datasets were used to evaluate our method and suwa's neural network and svm method, in suwa's studies, the similarity between training and test sets can be as high as 40%. meanwhile, we used a stricter criterion to evaluate our method, such that the similarity between training and test set is less than 25%. even with a stricter criterion used here, our method still outperforms the others.

a. the method proposed in this study.

b. in their study, gromiha and suwa  <cit>  evaluated  <dig> different methods. neural network was reported to be the best.

c. the statistics are obtained from the original publications  <cit> . in the original publications, only accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were reported. here, we calculate the mcc based on their published statistics.

receiver operating characteristic  curve
in the proposed method, a protein is classified as omp or non-omp based on the comparison of domp , dglo , and dimp . a protein is predicted to be omp if domp < min{dimp, dglo }, where min { } returns the minimal value of a set. this criteria is equal to evaluating domp - min{dimp, dglo} <  <dig>  in general, we can introduce a threshold parameter α, such that a protein is predict to be omp if domp - min{dimp, dglo} < α. figure  <dig> shows the roc curve of the proposed method obtained by varying α. the roc curve shows how the method can trade off between specificity and sensitivity by changing α. when applying a prediction method to identify omps, some researchers may prefer to identify more potential omps  at the cost of relatively low specificity; others may want to identify omps with very high specificity at the cost of relatively low sensitivity. the advantage of introducing this parameter α to the proposed method is that users can chose a threshold based on their need. when α is set to a lower value, the method can achieve higher specificity. on other hand, when a high value of α is chosen, the method can achieve higher sensitivity.

identification of omps in the proteome of e. coli
we applied the proposed method to search for omps in the proteome of e. coli using α = - <dig> , which corresponds to 98% specificity in the roc curve. the e. coli proteome consists of  <dig>  proteins.  <dig> of them were predicted to be omps. that accounts for  <dig> % of the whole proteome. this ratio is consistent with the previous estimation that 2–3% of the genes in gram-negative bacteria encodes omps  <cit> . among these  <dig> proteins,  <dig> are annotated as omp proteins in swiss-prot  <cit>  or epsortdb  <cit> , a database of protein subcellular locations that have been determined by laboratory experiments, and  <dig> share very high similarities with some omps in the training set . thus, we have very high confidence in believing that these  <dig> hits are true positives. in addition,  <dig> proteins are annotated with "membrane", "cell membrane" and "multi-pass membrane protein" in swiss-prot. we submitted these proteins to the tmhmm  <cit> , a server for predicting the topology of trasmembrane α-helical proteins, and psortb  <cit> , a server for predicting subcellular locations. none of them was predicted to be trasmembrane α-helical proteins  by both methods. thus, most of these  <dig> proteins are very likely omp proteins. the remaining  <dig> proteins may suggest new omp proteins that have not been previously discovered.

we also compare our method's predictions with the proteome scanning results obtained by bomp  <cit> . we choose bomp for comparison because bomp's predictions for e. coli proteins are available on its server. in the e. coli proteome, bomp predicted  <dig> omp proteins. comparisons show that  <dig> proteins were predicted to be omp by both our method and bomp.  <dig> proteins were predicted to be omp by our method but not by bomp. among them,  <dig> proteins are true positives. additionally,  <dig> proteins are annotated with "membrane", "cell membrane" or "multi-pass membrane protein" in swissprot.  <dig> proteins were predicted to be tmb proteins by bomp but not by our method. among them,  <dig> are true positives. additionally,  <dig> are annotated with "membrane", "cell membrane" or "multi-pass membrane protein" in swissprot. this comparison shows that there is a big overlap between the predictions of the proposed method and bomp. it also shows that each of the two methods can identify some omp proteins missed by the other. this suggests the possibility of achieving better performance by combining these two methods. another possible direction to improve the performance is to combine the current method with other methods that predict signal peptides in proteins, since omp proteins contain a signal peptide that leads them to the outer membrane.

discussion
simple methods versus complicated methods
it is estimated that 2–3% of the genes in gram-negative bacteria encodes omps  <cit> . identifying all omps  from bacterial genome is an urgent and challenging task. compared with other complicated methods, such as k-nearest neighbor method, neural network and svm, that have been used to identify omps, one merit of the proposed method resides in its simplicity and fast speed. the training data set is read only once. the calculation of residue composition and weighted euclidean distance  can be done with a very fast speed. the method proposed here will be very helpful to the discovery of "ompome" in a genome scale.

euclidean distance versus weighted euclidean distance
we used a wed 2x¯i) to discriminate omps from non-omps. our results show that this method achieves better performance than a published method that discriminate omps and non-omps based on a deviation distance   <cit> . in this study, we also tried euclidean distance 2) instead of wed. but, the performance is not so good as using wed. compared with euclidean distance and the deviation distance, wed can better reveal the relation between a protein and a group. intuitively, for the same amount of difference , when x¯i becomes smaller, the difference will become more significant. for example, for the same amount of difference  <dig>  , if the composition of residue i in omps is 90% , then  <dig>  does not imply a significant difference between the test protein and omps. but, if x¯i =  <dig>  , then |x¯i - xi| =  <dig>  will suggest a significant difference between the test protein and omps.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this paper presents a simple method that can discriminate outer membrane proteins  from non-omps with high performance:  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig>  mcc. direct comparisons show that the proposed method outperforms previously published methods. in addition to its high accuracy and mcc, the proposed method is very simple and can be easily applied to genomic data in large scale.
