BACKGROUND
naegleria species are free-living amoebae found in soil and water throughout the world  <cit> . although approximately  <dig> species have been recognized so far, naegleria fowleri is the only human pathogen that causes primary amoebic meningoencephalitis   <cit> . infection occurs when water contaminated by n. fowleri enters the noses of swimmers and the amoebae reach the central nervous system through the olfactory nerve tract  <cit> . several days after infection, patients suffer from severe inflammation of the brain and meninges, accompanied by headache, fever, vomiting, nausea and behavioral abnormalities. because most infected individuals fail to be diagnosed rapidly, they die within one to two weeks after exposure to the infectious water source  <cit> . the drug of choice for treating pam is the antifungal drug amphotericin b. however, no more than a dozen patients out of approximately  <dig> reported pam cases have been treated successfully with amphotericin b, either alone or in combination with other drugs . hence, n. fowleri is very problematic due to the rapid onset and destructive nature of the disease as well as the lack of effective treatments, rather than the number of cases worldwide.

knowledge of the genome of n. fowleri is needed to provide insights into the pathogenetic mechanisms of the amoeba as a basis for developing more effective therapies as well as more rapid diagnostic tools. here, we present an approach consisting of whole-genome sequencing in combination with proteomic analysis for identifying potential pathogenicity factors in n. fowleri. the genome of its non-pathogenic relative naegleria gruberi has recently been sequenced  <cit> . a comparative analysis of the genomes of n. gruberi and n. fowleri based on a 60-kb nuclear segment showed less similarity between them than the present understanding of the phylogenetic relationships of naegleria species would have led us to expect  <cit> . therefore, the genome of n. gruberi is not suitable as a reference for genome assembly, and thus, a de novo sequencing approach had to be applied for determination of the complete genome sequence of n. fowleri. furthermore, due to the substantial genetic differences observed, the application of a comparative genomic approach between pathogenic n. fowleri and non-pathogenic n. gruberi to define pathogenicity factors may be misleading. in the present work, we conducted an intra-species comparison of highly and weakly pathogenic n. fowleri trophozoites based on the model published by burri et al.
 <cit> . this model showed that n. fowleri trophozoites maintained in either nelson’s medium or pynfh medium supplemented with liver hydrolysate  are highly pathogenic in mice and demonstrate rapid in vitro proliferation, whereas trophozoites cultured in pynfh medium are weakly pathogenic with a slower growth. although the pathogenicity cannot be explained by different cytotoxicity mechanisms or by the presence of membrane vesicles in this model, it enables to investigate the pathogenesis of n. fowleri under defined experimental conditions  <cit> .

the evaluation of sequencing data is a computationally challenging task due to the volume of data involved and because of statistical interference in the algorithms used for elucidating the genomic organization of novel eukaryotic genomes. the identification of protein coding regions in de novo-sequenced eukaryotic genomes based solely on ab initio computational algorithms is prone to specificity and sensitivity issues due to the lack of validated gene training sets. in this work, the obtained in silico gene-finding results were partially substantiated by experimental proteomic data. furthermore, the search for potential pathogenicity factors was based on proteomic expression profiling of highly and weakly pathogenic n. fowleri, rather than, at least in this stage of research, less reliable transcriptomic data.

RESULTS
genomic dna sequencing
as a pre-requisite for obtaining insight into the pathogenic mechanism of n. fowleri, the genome of the amoeba was sequenced using both illumina hiseq  <dig> and roche  <dig> gs flx technology. the dna isolated for whole-genome sequencing was composed of  <dig> times more plasmid dna and  <dig> times less mitochondrial dna than genomic dna; thus, no substantial enrichment of either type of dna was present in the starting material used for sequencing. in a first step, dna was sequenced with the illumina hiseq  <dig> platform, resulting in approximately  <dig> million 100-bp paired-end reads with an insert size of 300 bp. the de novo assembly of these short 100-bp reads was facilitated by  <dig> backbone sequencing, providing approximately  <dig>  single reads with an average length of 378 bp. finally, the assembly was improved with information from a mate-pair library composed of approximately  <dig> million illumina reads with an insert size of 3 kb. in total, over  <dig> million reads were de novo assembled into  <dig>  scaffolds with an average coverage of 770x and an n <dig> of  <dig> . the nuclear genome of n. fowleri has a size of  <dig> ,856 bp and is at-rich, with a gc content of only  <dig> % . the calculation of the genome size via flow cytometry indicated that the n. fowleri genome is approximately 66 mb. based on the  <dig> ,856-bp size of the de novo-assembled genome, the genome of n. fowleri is considered diploid.table  <dig>

transcriptome assembly and annotation
to generate a database for protein identification via nano-liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry , rna was sequenced using the illumina hiseq  <dig> platform, resulting in approximately  <dig> million 100-bp paired-end reads. using trinity and the program cd-hit for redundancy filtering,  <dig>  open reading frames  were predicted .these orfs were then used as a database for the identification of proteins in the 2d gel spots and 1d gel slices . only  <dig> % of the predicted orfs failed to align to the draft genome.the standalone blastp search against the refseq-protein database resulted in a significant hit for  <dig>  of the  <dig>  orfs. to  <dig>  of these  <dig>  significant blast hits a gene ontology  term could be assigned using the annotation pipeline blast2go .figure  <dig>

genome similarity
as the genome of n. gruberi was sequenced in  <dig>  <cit> , there is an important question regarding the relationship of n. gruberi to other naegleria species, especially to its pathogenic relative n. fowleri. to resolve the degree of relationships between n. gruberi and n. fowleri at the molecular level, we reconstructed a genome similarity network based on est sequences . as additional groups for comparison, two other amoeba, entamoeba histolytica and acanthamoeba castellanii, belonging to class amoebozoa, and trypanosoma brucei and trypanosoma cruzi, belonging to class euglenozoa, which is the most closely related group to the heterolobosea , were used. in this network, n. fowleri and n. gruberi share substantially more gene families than n. fowleri shares with the other species assessed, thus positioning n. fowleri as the closest relative to n. gruberi. regarding the other analyzed amoeba, n. fowleri is closer to a. castellanii than to e. histolytica.figure  <dig> 
genome similarity network. the genome similarity network was reconstructed using n. fowleri  orfs and est sequences from n. gruberi , a. castellanii , e. histolytica , t. brucei  and t. cruzi  using evolutionary gene and genome network  software. the graph was visualized using cytoscape  <dig> . <dig>  the length of the edges is the inverse proportion of shared gene families. the number of shared gene families is indicated on the corresponding edges.



in an additional approach, blastn searches suggested low similarity between the coding sequences of n. fowleri and n. gruberi, as only  <dig> % of the  <dig>  predicted orfs aligned to the n. gruberi genome . despite the low similarity on nucleotide level,  <dig> % of the n. fowleri orfs showed a blastp hit with n. gruberi genes .

identification of potential pathogenicity factors
the identification of pathogenicity factors in n. fowleri is an important step in revealing the mechanisms that are responsible for the destructive nature of pam. through comparative 2d gel electrophoresis, we obtained an overview of the proteomes of highly and weakly pathogenic n. fowleri . for comparative visual quantification of the obtained protein concentrations, the actin-binding protein cofilin, which was expressed at equivalent levels under the two conditions, was used as a control protein spot. as seen in figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  heat shock protein  <dig>   <cit> , actin  <dig> and  <dig>  as well as the membrane protein mp2cl <dig>  <cit> , all of which are known potential pathogenicity factors, were expressed at increased levels in highly pathogenic compared to weakly pathogenic trophozoites. this observation confirmed the potential of all four proteins to contribute to the pathogenicity of n. fowleri. moreover, we identified cyclophilin as being strongly overexpressed in highly pathogenic trophozoites, suggesting that this protein is an additional potential pathogenicity factor. conversely, another protein, the hsp <dig> domain-containing protein, was over-expressed in weakly pathogenic n. fowleri.figure  <dig>

the molecular weight and theoretical pi values of the identified proteins were calculated according to the compute pi/mw tool from the sib bioinformatics resource portal . the results of visual quantification of the protein concentrations found in highly pathogenic compared to weakly pathogenic trophozoites are indicated in the last column .

in a second step, by performing 1d gel electrophoresis in combination with nano-lc ms/ms , we detected a total of  <dig>  proteins,  <dig> of which were differentially expressed between weakly pathogenic trophozoites maintained in pynfh medium and highly pathogenic trophozoites in pynfh/lh medium . furthermore,  <dig> proteins were differentially expressed in weakly pathogenic trophozoites maintained in pynfh medium and highly pathogenic trophozoites in nelson’s medium . approximately two-thirds of the proteins showing different expression levels could be annotated by ngklast . using the protein expression level in weakly pathogenic n. fowleri as a reference, we observed  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated proteins in trophozoites grown in pynfh/lh as well as  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated proteins in trophozoites grown in nelson’s medium. among these  <dig> differentially expressed and annotated proteins, only  <dig> were found to be up- or down-regulated in both highly pathogenic populations. among these proteins,  <dig> were co-regulated in both highly pathogenic groups, while the remaining  <dig> were inversely regulated, i.e., up-regulated in one highly versus weakly pathogenic comparison group and down-regulated in the other comparison group. among these  <dig> proteins that were co-regulated in both highly pathogenic n. fowleri populations,  <dig> components were up-regulated and were, thus, finally considered to represent potential pathogenicity factors.figure  <dig>

discussion
despite extensive research over the last several decades, the mechanisms accounting for the rapidly progressing and destructive nature of pam are still unknown. here, the 30-mb genome sequence of n. fowleri, including rna sequencing data, is presented for the first time. based on these data, we identified  <dig> novel potential pathogenicity factors in the amoeba using proteomic approaches. moreover,  <dig> proteins were found to be down-regulated in highly pathogenic trophozoites. most of this last group of proteins was composed of components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain as well as protein biosynthesis pathways . because they survive at the expense of their host, highly pathogenic n. fowleri trophozoites may require a smaller gene repertoire because they may benefit from the host’s cells. in contrast, weakly pathogenic trophozoites are usually free living and therefore must possess all of the genes needed for essential metabolic processes, likely explaining the differences in the metabolism of the highly and weakly pathogenic n. fowleri.table  <dig>

the proteins are sorted according to their decreasing level of up- or down-regulation in reference to weakly pathogenic n. fowleri. the regulation levels are given in columns  <dig>  and  <dig> . the  <dig> up-regulated proteins  were considered to be potential pathogenicity factors of n. fowleri.




from a phylogenetic point of view, the de novo-assembled n. fowleri genome may shed light on the extent of the taxonomic relationship between n. fowleri and its non-pathogenic relative n. gruberi, whose genome sequence was published in  <dig>  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge, there is no reliable means, at least for eukaryotes, of translating whole-genome-based comparisons into taxonomic relationships. the general approach for assessing phylogenetic relationships is to pick a  gene  as the basis for comparison. using this approach, the level of divergence between n. fowleri and n. gruberi based on 18s ribosomal dna analysis has been estimated to be approximately similar to that between mammals and frogs  <cit> . in a study conducted by herman et al.
 <cit> , a lack of collinearity between the n. fowleri and n. gruberi genomes was found through sequencing a 60-kb nuclear segment from n. fowleri and comparing it with corresponding sequences from n. gruberi. furthermore, according to a typing system based on internal transcribed spacers and  <dig> s rdna sequences, there is strong evidence that naegleria lovaniensis, and not n. gruberi, is the closest relative of n. fowleri
 <cit> . according to the genome similarity network obtained by comparing n. fowleri with n. gruberi, a. castellanii, e. histolytica, t. brucei and t. cruzi based on est sequences , we found that the extent of the relationship between n. fowleri and n. gruberi is comparable to that between t. brucei and t. cruzi. however, as only  <dig> % of the assembled n. fowleri rna transcripts aligned to the n. gruberi genome in blastn searches, we propose that there is low similarity between the coding sequences of n. gruberi and n. fowleri. in summary, all these findings reflect the intricate phylogeny of the protozoan taxonomy, and our data may add a further piece to this complex puzzle. in the context of our work, clarification of the phylogenetic relationships between naegleria species is critical for choosing an appropriate search strategy for potential pathogenicity factors. comparative analysis of genomic data from n. fowleri and n. gruberi, aimed at the identification of the pathogenic mechanisms of n. fowleri, has been discussed as a possible option in the field of naegleria research. however, based on the findings described above, this experimental strategy is questionable because the substantial dissimilarities between the genomes of these species may lead to a high number of false positive candidates. in our opinion, the possibility of influencing the pathogenic potential of n. fowleri according to the composition of the culture medium is a more promising route for identifying relevant pathogenicity factors. while trophozoites maintained in pynfh medium showed weak in vivo pathogenicity, trophozoites in nelson’s medium were highly pathogenic in mice. furthermore, when the pynfh medium was supplemented with lh, n. fowleri trophozoites also converted to the highly pathogenic phenotype  <cit> . based on this pathogenicity model, we performed an intra-species comparison of n. fowleri using a genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic approach to identify the factors accounting for the pathogenic potential of the amoeba. to exclude proteomic differences caused by the different compositions of the media, we compared both of the highly pathogenic phenotypes  with the weakly pathogenic trophozoites . among the  <dig> initially identified orfs showing one or more peptide matches in the mass spectrometric analysis, only  <dig> proteins were up-regulated in both comparison groups and were therefore considered potential pathogenicity factors.the pathogenicity of an organism is a complex process and is proposed to result from the interactions of many components, rather than the action of one essential factor. thus, we clustered the  <dig> potential pathogenicity factors identified according to their cellular components to determine the compartment with the highest pathogenic activity .

 membrane domain
based on the go assignment of the proteins to their cellular locations, the membrane was proposed to be one of the main foci where pathogenic activity occurs. because adherence of n. fowleri to its host cells is a crucial step in inducing a successful infection  <cit> , the membrane  may play an important role in the pathogenesis of pam. based on a previous investigation, a fibronectin-binding protein essential for the interaction of trophozoites with extracellular matrix glycoproteins was identified, suggesting that n. fowleri harbors a membrane protein related to the human integrin-like receptor  <cit> . furthermore, several studies have shown that n. fowleri lyses a wide variety of mammalian target cells in vitro through contact-dependent mechanisms . this is a further indication of the presence of surface proteins with an essential role in the lytic activity of trophozoites. lowrey and mclaughlin identified a membrane-associated protein with cytolytic activity against mammalian cells  <cit> . another membrane protein, mp2cl <dig>  was isolated from pathogenic n. fowleri and was not found in non-pathogenic naegleria species, suggesting mp2cl <dig> as a potential pathogenicity factor  <cit> . because mp2cl was expressed at higher levels in highly pathogenic compared to weakly pathogenic trophozoites, as accessed via comparative 2d gel electrophoresis , our analysis confirmed the potential involvement of this membrane protein in the pathogenesis of n. fowleri. thus, we consider mp2cl <dig> an important candidate for further examination of its role in the pathogenesis of pam.

in another study, different membrane-bound glycoproteins involved in resistance to complement-mediated damage were described  <cit> . moreover, fritzinger et al. demonstrated the presence of an immunogenic surface protein in n. fowleri that was reactive with antibodies to human cd <dig>  because this cd59-like protein binds complement component c <dig>  it may play a role in resistance to complement lysis. additionally, it has been shown that the cd59-like protein is shed on membrane vesicles  <cit> . generally, n. fowleri undergoes membrane vesiculation to remove membrane-deposited c proteins, thereby protecting the amoeba from complement damage  <cit> . in the present study, we also identified vesicle trafficking as a potential pathogenicity mechanism .

vesicular trafficking
as mentioned above, n. fowleri undergoes membrane vesiculation as a mechanism for resisting complement damage  <cit> . because various proteins identified as likely to be involved in the pathogenic mechanisms of n. fowleri are stored and ultimately shed in membrane vesicles, vesicular trafficking may play an important role in the pathogenesis of pam. the cd59-like protein mentioned above is shed in vesicles  <cit> . furthermore, the two pore-forming glycoproteins, naegleriapore a and b, are stored in intracellular granular vesicles. as naegleriapore a and b exert cytotoxicity in the form of membrane-permeabilizing activity towards prokaryotic as well as eukaryotic cells, they are proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of pam  <cit> . the vesicular storage of the cd59-like protein, naegleriapores a and b and likely also other potential n. fowleri pathogenicity factors may present a means of self-protection from the cytotoxic activity of these factors. therefore, intracellular vesicles may function as part of a pathogenicity machinery via storing and ultimately secreting proteins that are able to destroy target cells.

previous studies conducted in our lab have demonstrated the localization of membrane vesicles on highly pathogenic trophozoites maintained in nelson’s medium, but not on weakly pathogenic trophozoites. however, because no vesicle formation was observed in those trophozoites in pynfh/lh medium, which were also found to be highly pathogenic, the presence of membrane vesicles could not be related to the in vivo pathogenicity  <cit> . conversely, based on a combination of findings, the vesicular trafficking system per se was characterized as a cellular compartment with potential pathogenic activity . in particular, it was found that apoptosis-linked gene-2-interacting protein x <dig> , which has now been identified as a potential n. fowleri pathogenicity factor , is a key regulator of endosomal sorting  <cit> . the endosomal system accomplishes the intracellular transport of cellular material between organelles such as the golgi apparatus as well as from organelles to the membrane and vice versa via vesicles. yu et al. suggested that the golgi-localized transmembrane protein hid- <dig>  which is up-regulated in highly pathogenic n. fowleri , may be involved in vesicular exocytosis by preventing the mis-sorting of peptides to lysosomes for degradation  <cit> . thus, both aip <dig> and hid- <dig> are interesting candidate n. fowleri pathogenicity factors, potentially acting to regulate vesicular trafficking in the amoeba.

in e. histolytica it has been shown that, in addition to the storage and secretion of cytolytic molecules , vesicles are implicated in phagocytosis . the rab gtpase ehrabb, which is localized in cytoplasmic vesicles, is involved in the phagocytosis of e. histolytica
 <cit> . rho family gtpases, including rab proteins such as ehrabb, regulate the cytoskeleton and associated pathogenic processes such as phagocytosis, which in turn, is controlled by vesicular trafficking  <cit> . although this topic requires further investigation, the ras-related protein rab- <dig>  which was up-regulated in highly pathogenic compared to weakly pathogenic n. fowleri in our analysis , may be involved in vesicular trafficking and, thus, in the phagocytosis of target cells.

taking these findings together, vesicular trafficking may be an important step in the pathogenesis of n. fowleri infection, as potential pathogenicity factors in the amoeba, including the cd59-like protein and naegleriapores a and b, are stored in vesicles. this possibility is further supported by our analysis showing that vesicular trafficking is regulated by proteins identified as potential pathogenicity factors in n. fowleri, such as aip <dig>  rab <dig> and hid- <dig> 

the formation of vesicles via membrane budding involves re-organization of the cytoskeleton, mainly depending on the turnover of actin filaments  <cit> , which is discussed as a potential factor in the pathogenicity of n. fowleri in the next section.

cell projection
cell projection was identified as a process that is likely involved in the pathogenesis of pam . naegleria trophozoites exhibit amoebastomes, or food-cups, which are pseudopodial projections  <cit> . these amoebastomes are involved in the attachment of amoebae to substrates as well as in the ingestion of bacteria, yeast cells and cellular debris via phagocytic processes  <cit> . phagocytosis is dependent on the dynamic turnover of the cytoskeletal protein actin. because actin is localized around food cups and has been shown to have the capacity to modulate in vitro cytotoxicity in different target cells, it is frequently discussed as a potential pathogenicity factor in n. fowleri
. furthermore, the effects of immunization with either a dna vaccine or a lentiviral vector expressing the nfa <dig> gene  were investigated in mice infected with pam  <cit> . in the present study, actin  <dig> and actin  <dig> were found to be up-regulated in highly pathogenic trophozoites in 2d gels , confirming the potential role of actin in the pathogenic mechanisms of n. fowleri. another protein showing specific localization around phagocytic food cups that plays a role in cytotoxicity as well as in proliferation of n. fowleri is heat shock protein  <dig>   <cit> . the potential involvement of hsp <dig> in the pathogenic mechanisms of the amoeba was confirmed by our analysis detecting the up-regulation of this protein in highly pathogenic trophozoites .

the structural function of the actin cytoskeleton is essential in eukaryotic cells. actin filaments participate in diverse cellular processes, such as adhesion  <cit> , motility  <cit>  and phagocytosis. the role of actin during phagocytosis has also been reported in other parasites, including e. histolytica
 <cit>  and a. castellanii
 <cit> . because actin plays a dynamic and structural role in many essential mechanisms in cells, its turnover must be strictly regulated by actin-binding proteins . formins, such as formin d, which we identified as a potential pathogenicity factor in n. fowleri , are a crucial class of proteins that regulate the formation of actin filaments. formins promote the polymerization of monomeric g-actin into filamentous f-actin as well as actin nucleation , ultimately resulting in actin filament assembly through a processive capping mechanism  <cit> . another actin-modifying protein with a potential role in the pathogenesis of pam is severin . severin belongs to the class of actin-fragmenting and -capping proteins   <cit> . f-actin fragmentation is required for rapid re-arrangements of the filamentous actin cytoskeleton during cellular processes such as phagocytosis. cofilin, which showed equal expression levels in weakly and highly pathogenic trophozoites in 2d gels , is an actin filament-severing protein that creates free barbed ends that are available for de-polymerization or polymerization   <cit> . finally, villin is a multi-functional actin cytoskeleton-regulating protein that is able to perform all of the actin-modifying functions discussed above, carrying out actin nucleation and polymerization as formin does; actin capping and fragmentation as severin does; actin severing as cofilin does; and actin bundling via cross-linking actin filaments   <cit> . in our analysis, villin- <dig> was the protein found to be up-regulated at the highest level in highly pathogenic n. fowleri compared to weakly pathogenic n. fowleri . though the exact role of retinitis pigmentosa gtpase regulator , which was also identified as a potential pathogenicity factor in n. fowleri , is unknown, gakovic et al. proposed the involvement of rpgr in the regulation of f-actin  <cit> . although this possibility requires further investigation, formin d, severin, villin- <dig> and rpgr may be involved in actin-dependent pathogenic processes such as phagocytosis. because of the versatile role of villin- <dig> in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and the fact that it showed the highest level of up-regulation in highly pathogenic trophozoites, villin- <dig> is the most promising candidate for further investigations to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of pam.figure  <dig> 
regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. the turnover of actin filaments is strictly regulated by the actin-binding proteins formin, severin, cofilin and villin.



as noted above, phagocytosis is an actin-dependent process. dianokova et al.
 <cit>  showed that the actin-binding myosins are concentrated around phagocytic cups in macrophages. based on the notion that these phagocytic cups are similar to amoebastomes, myosin may be involved in phagocytic processes in the amoeba. we identified myosin ii heavy chain as well as myosin ie as potential pathogenicity factors in n. fowleri . in macrophages, myosin ii is required for the contractile activity of phagocytic cups  <cit> , whereas class i myosins have been proposed to act at the membrane-actin interface to support endocytosis and exocytosis via vesicular trafficking  <cit> . thus, further experiments are required to investigate the putative localization of myosin at the site of amoebastomes and to examine its role in the phagocytosis of target cells.

CONCLUSIONS
using genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic approaches, we identified  <dig> proteins that potentially act as pathogenicity factors in the deadly amoeba n. fowleri. the membrane was identified as a key location where pathogenic processes may occur, and these processes most likely involve actin-dependent vesicular trafficking mechanisms. this study will be the basis for our future application of reverse genetic approaches to demonstrate the role of the identified candidate proteins in the pathogenesis of pam.
