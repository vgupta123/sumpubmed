BACKGROUND
regulatory t cells  are key modulators of immune responses in mice and humans and represent key candidates for therapeutic interventions of a broad variety of immunological diseases  <cit> . while reduction or functional inactivation of tregs would be beneficial for restoration of anti-tumor immunity, selective expansion of tregs is a promising approach for preventing autoimmunity, allergy and organ graft rejection in the transplantation setting. initially being described as thymus-derived cd25+ subpopulation within the naïve cd4+ t-helper cell  pool  <cit> , during the last decade extensive gene expression studies based on the comparison of cd25+cd4+ tregs and cd25-cd4+ t helper cells  revealed a considerable number of additional genes critically involved in treg development and function  <cit> . among those, the transcription factor foxp <dig> was identified as master-regulator of the treg lineage  <cit> .

defects in the foxp <dig> gene function in humans and mice result in fatal autoimmunity, and foxp <dig> over-expression in previously naïve t cells converts them to treg-like cells with in vivo and in vitro suppressive function. despite increasing knowledge regarding the molecular signature of tregs and mechanisms underlying their suppressive function, the extent to which treg development and function are genetically controlled has not been studied to date.

to better understand gene variants that underlie disease predispositions related to treg functions and to identify regulatory networks related to both treg and th cells, we undertook a systems genetics analysis of gene expression in these cell types using a genetic reference panel consisting of  <dig> members of the large bxd family of recombinant inbred strains  <cit> . genetic reference panels  such as the bxd family, are sets of strains that have a defined and fixed genetic architecture that can be used in classic linkage studies and complex trait analysis. the bxd family is one of the largest grp, consisting of ~ <dig> lines of which  <dig> are now fully inbred that all trace their descent from f <dig> progeny of crosses between c57bl/6j  and dba/2j . individuals within a single bxd strain are nearly isogenic  and genotypes for the entire family of strains are known and stable  <cit> . the high level of genetic variation among bxd strains can be exploited to systematically study the genetic control of gene expression even at the level of single cell types  <cit>  and even higher order genotype-to-phenotype relations, including for example global analysis of disease susceptibility  <cit> .

recently, whole-genome transcriptome data have been collected from grps. the expression level of a given transcript in a cell type or tissue may be then treated as a quantitative trait, and by employing standard linkage analyses so-called expression quantitative trait loci  can be identified. this links differences in expression to specific chromosomal intervals  <cit> . eqtl analysis can be used to identify regulatory interactions and to analyze specific effects of treatment or cell type on transcriptional control  <cit> . in addition, the analysis of eqtls in chromosomal regions linked to disease susceptibility can help identify key candidate genes  <cit> .

here, we report the whole transcriptome analysis of steady-state terg and th cells that were isolated from  <dig> members of the bxd family, including the parental strains. variation of expression across the strains allowed us to identify many novel gene-interaction networks in both t cell subsets. in addition, these two data sets enable us to nominate candidate genes that may have important functions for the maintenance of self-tolerance and the prevention of allergy.

RESULTS
cd4+cd25+ t regulatory  cells and cd4+cd25-t helper  cells were isolated from the spleens of  <dig> bxd strains and the parental strains dba/2j and c57bl/6j by fluorescence activated cell sorting. subsequently, whole genome transcriptome analysis was performed separately for each bxd strain and for treg and th cells.

the gene expression data has subsequently been used for two types of analysis.  a direct comparison of all genes that were expressed in treg versus th detected was performed from all samples together to identify differentially expressed genes in either cell type. here, the variation in expression patterns between strains was not taken into account. these studies allowed us to identify a large number of novel, treg-specific genes.  differences in gene expression patterns between strains were used to determine eqtls in treg and th cells, separately. this analysis allowed us to identify cis- and trans-eqtls, potential gene regulatory interactions and candidate genes involved in autoimmune disease.

analysis of differentially expressed genes reveals known and novel gene candidates important for treg and th functions
the large data set - for each cell type a total of  <dig> replicates has been generated - provided a high statistical power to identify genes that were differentially expressed in treg versus th cells. we identified differentially expressed genes by employing a statistical test on the difference between the two t cell populations, setting the threshold for the p-value to <  <dig>  and using an expression difference of at least two-fold. in the following, probesets that exhibited a statistically significant and at least two-fold difference in expression between treg and th cells are referred to as 'de-2fold genes'. in this way, a total of  <dig>  probesets was found that exhibited a significantly higher expression level in treg compared to th cells .  <dig> probesets were found from transcripts that were at least two-fold higher expressed in treg cells , including  <dig> annotated genes. on the other hand, using the same criteria, for th expressed genes, a total of  <dig>  probesets was found significantly higher expressed in th compared to treg cells, and  <dig> probesets, containing  <dig> annotated genes, showed a two-fold or higher expression level  in th cells .

a total of  <dig> genes with known treg functions  were found amongst the differentially expressed genes , including well known treg functional genes like foxp <dig> , nrp <dig> , itgae/αeβ <dig> , ctla <dig> , ikzf4/eos . il2ra/cd <dig>  was found to be highly expressed in treg compared to th cells  which is expected, because the resting treg subset was isolated on the basis of cd <dig> surface expression. also, foxp <dig>  representing the most important treg functional gene in mice, was found to be expressed 43-fold higher in treg cells. go term analyses for the de genes revealed substantial differences between tregs and th. whereas lymphocyte activation was indicated for treg genes, antigen processing and presentation was strongly associated to th genes .

these results confirmed successful separation of highly pure treg and th subsets and corroborates the value of our data for subsequent analyses. furthermore, the comparison of treg and th gene expression data from a large sample size allowed us to identify a large number of genes that are differentially expressed between treg and th cells and may play a role in the differentiation and maintenance or the function of the respective cell populations.

global analyses of eqtl mapping reveals different eqtls between treg and th cell populations
the analysis of gene expression patterns across  <dig> bxd and the two parental strains allowed determining eqtls as quantitative traits by comparing expression values for each gene and associating them with markers along the genome in all strains.

in principle, two types of eqtls can be distinguished. if an eqtl is located at the same genomic position as the gene itself , it is considered as a cis-eqtl. in this case, variations in the promoter sequence or in regions that determine the stability of the mrna of the gene are the most likely causes for the observed differences. if the eqtl is at a distant location  from the regulated gene, it is referred to as a trans-eqtl. for example, a transcription factor may be located in the eqtl interval which regulates the expression of the target gene. in this way, many gene regulatory regions but also gene-gene interactions and networks may be identified.

therefore, we performed a search for e-qtls at a global level for all probesets. figures  <dig> and  <dig> show the position of all cis- and trans-eqtls in treg and th cells, respectively. the analysis revealed that the overall distribution of trans-eqtls between the two cell populations is different suggesting different regulatory circuits in the two cell types .

many cis eqtl loci are shared between treg and th cells
we then identified all cis- and trans-eqtls in both treg and th data sets with an lrs value of  <dig> or higher. an lrs of  <dig> for trans-eqtls corresponds to a lod score of  <dig>  for trans-eqtls and thus to a genome-wide p-value of about  <dig> .

in the treg data set, we identified  <dig>  probesets with cis-eqtls with lrs scores of  <dig> or greater. in comparison, we identified  <dig>  probesets of this type in the th data set. of these  <dig>  probesets  were common to both cell types.

sixty-seven of the cis-eqtl probesets in tregs also represented de-2fold genes for tregs. despite the large overlap of cisqtl in the th and treg samples,  <dig> probesets  were only found in treg samples and were not detected as cis-eqtls in th using the above criteria of a minimum lrs of  <dig> and de-2fold for treg . however, it should be noted that some probesets, e.g. lad <dig>  naip5/birc1e  and gbp <dig> ) also exhibited significant cis-eqtls in th but the corresponding lrs did not reach the threshold level of  <dig> . figure  <dig> shows stx <dig>  as an example for a gene that was expressed both in treg and th cells but exhibited a strong cis-eqtl only in treg cells. stx <dig>  gsta <dig>  ctram, zfp <dig> exhibited a cis-eqtl in treg and a trans-eqtl in th cells.

in the th data set,  <dig> of the identified cis-eqtls in th were also de-2fold genes for th cells. of these,  <dig> probesets represented cis-eqtl genes that were only found in th cells and were not detected as cis-eqtls with a lrs of  <dig> or larger intreg . however, some probestes also exhibited strong cis-eqtls in treg but the corresponding lrs did not reach the threshold level of  <dig>  e.g. snx <dig>  exhibited a significant cis-eqtl in th and a strong trans-eqtl in treg cells . similarly, chn <dig>  cadm <dig> and themis/e430004n04rik showed a cis-eqtl in th and a trans e-qtl in treg cells.

strong cis-eqtls highlight genes that are differentially expressed from the two parental alleles. they can be employed in a forward genetic approach in subsequent studies to elucidate the biological function of the respective genes.

trans-eqtl mapping reveals different mechanisms of gene regulation in treg and th cells
we then analyzed trans-eqtls at a global level, using again a lrs threshold of  <dig> or higher.  <dig>  probesets were identified which showed a trans-eqtls in treg cells. of these,  <dig> probesets exhibited trans-eqtls that were present both in treg and th cells.  <dig> probesets showed also a two-fold or higher level of expression  in treg cells . of these, all except bc <dig> and prdm <dig>  represented treg-specifc trans-eqtls .

for abcb1a , member 1a), gata <dig> , mapkbp <dig> , marco , and nr4a2/nurr <dig>  an immune-related function, in some cases with regulating activity, has been described . laptm4b  and lycat  exhibited strong trans-eqtl signals in both cell types but at different chromosomal locations .

in the th data set,  <dig>  probesets were identified exhibiting a trans-eqtls of  <dig> or higher. of these,  <dig> probesets showed a two-fold or higher level of expression  in th cells  and all, except bc <dig> and prpf <dig>  represented th-specifc trans-eqtls.

the expression of prpf <dig> ) showed strong and shared trans-eqtls in th and treg cells , whereas st8sia <dig> , crtam , igfbp <dig>  and sell  exhibited strong trans-eqtl signals in both cell types but at different chromosomal locations .

in summary, the identification of cell-specific trans-eqtl regions allowed the subsequent analyses of candidates in the respective regions and to propose novel gene-gene regulatory interactions .

qtls analysis for known functional treg genes shows trans-regulation for nrp <dig> in treg
in order to identify gene interaction networks for genes that may play an important role for treg function, we studied known treg functional genes  that were differentially expressed in treg cells and that showed a high expression signal in tregs . this analysis revealed four genes with eqtls of an lrs equal or larger than  <dig> : tnfrsf1b , nrp <dig> , stat <dig>  and ikzf <dig> . nrp <dig>  and tnfrsf1b  exhibited a genome-wide significant trans-eqtl, whereas the eqtls for stat <dig> and ikzf <dig> did not reach genome-wide significance levels. also, foxp <dig> and ctla <dig> did not exhibit any significant cis- or trans-eqtls in treg cells.

these trans-eqtl regions were subsequently used to propose novel gene-gene regulatory interactions .

analysis of candidate genes in trans-eqtl intervals reveals novel gene-gene regulatory interactions and relation to classical phenotype traits
next, we analyzed several trans-eqtls that were identified in the above analyses for candidate genes that may be involved in the regulation of target gene expression . below, we present the analysis of one qtl interval as an example. the results for other qtl intervals can be found in additional file  <dig>  'additional results and discussion.

the interval on chromosome  <dig>  was found to regulate expression of the f2rl <dig> gene . this region contains  <dig> probesets which were well expressed  in treg cells . of these, ccdc <dig> , zfp <dig> , 1810030n24rik, ai <dig> and map3k <dig>  exhibited strong cis-eqtls  and thus are most likely candidates for regulating the expression of f2rl <dig> in treg cells.

furthermore, we analyzed the same eqtl intervals for the presence of a significant qtl in classical phenotypes that are contained in the genenetwork database. a total of  <dig> phenotypes could be found with an lrs of  <dig> or larger. of these, eight were related to immune and infectious diseases traits . thus, the candidate genes may also be involved in regulating these traits. it should, however, be noted that our search algorithm only detects classical phenotypes that exhibit a peak qtl at this position. a more detailed analysis can be performed manually for any phenotype of interest.

analysis of autoimmune traits
in a previous study for autoimmune disease traits, two qtls were identifies that are associated with autoimmune traits in the bxd population. one qtl on chromosome  <dig> was associated with elevated serum titers of anti-dna antibodies and a second locus on chromosome  <dig> with increased serum titers of rheumatoid factor  levels  <cit> . therefore, we investigated these intervals in our treg and th data sets.

the qtl interval  on chromosome  <dig> contains  <dig> probesets that were expressed in treg cells  and  <dig> probesets were expressed in th cells , respectively. we then identified the genes that exhibit a cis-eqtl in treg cells because these may be involved in the regulation of autoimmunity to dna.  <dig> probesets were identified that also exhibited a strong cis-eqtls  in treg cells . the peak interval  contained the genes ada , slpi , sys1/2610042o14rik ), and znf <dig> . the cis-eqtl signal for ada is most likely caused by snps in the hybridization probe. thus these genes, with the exception of ada, represent likely candidates for regulating this trait in treg cells. the results for the analysis of the chromosome  <dig> interval can be found in the supplement data.

discussion
here, we studied the expression patterns of genes in treg and th cells from a large number of individuals from the bxd recombinant inbred strain collection. the ultimate goal of these studies was the identification of expression quantitative traits  and of co-regulated genes that will give new insights into gene-gene interactions and regulatory pathways. in addition, the large data set of expression profiles from  <dig> mouse lines allowed us to validate known and to newly identify so far unknown genes that are expressed specifically in treg but not th cells.

until now, several studies have aimed to identify genes that are specific for treg cells . using our data set from  <dig> mouse stains allowed us to search for differences in expression levels in treg versus th cells with a so far unprecedented statistical power. our analysis confirmed that many genes with a described treg function are also differentially expressed. of the  <dig> genes that were described in the literature as genes with an important function in treg cells,  <dig> were also found to be treg specific in our analysis. of the remaining six genes, galectin- <dig> does not have a homologue in humans. s1pr1a and lrrc <dig> were not represented on the array. also a treg function for lrrc32/garp was so far only described in humans. the remaining three genes, gzmb, lag <dig> and il12rb <dig>  were expressed at low levels in both treg and th but with no significant difference between the two cell types.

the genes foxp <dig>  nrp <dig>  clta <dig>  tnfrsf <dig> /gitr, il2ra /cd <dig>  itgae /cd <dig>  ikzf <dig> /eos, gpr <dig> have been reported to be hallmark genes for treg cells  <cit> . indeed, all of them appear as de-2fold genes specifically higher expressed in treg cells. since we discovered nrp <dig> as surface marker of murine regulatory t cells  <cit>  comprehensive data have been obtained regarding its implications in treg function  <cit> . whereas expression of other treg-markers such as cd <dig> and ctla <dig> are induced upon activation of th cells, activated murine th cells lack nrp <dig> expression, suggesting fundamental differences in the transcriptional regulation of this molecule in tregs when compared with other well described treg markers.

in total,  <dig> probesets were found in our analysis as treg-specific and with an expression difference of at least two-fold. although a difference of two-fold in expression levels is often used in gene expression array studies in many studies, it may be considered as arbitrary. our study allowed to find even more genes with statistical significant differences in expression levels and extended the known list to  <dig>  probesets that are specific for differentiated treg versus th cells. zheng et al.  <cit>  performed chromatin immunoprecipitation and genome tiling array profiling to identify direct targets of the foxp <dig> transcription factor. about  <dig> genes were identified were also up-regulated in foxp3+ t cells. of these,  <dig> genes were also found as differentially expressed genes in our analysis.

recently, a genome wide association study in a large cohort of patients suffering from alopecia areata, which is among the most highly prevalent human autoimmune diseases, leading to disfiguring hair loss due to the collapse of immune privilege of the hair follicle and subsequent autoimmune attack revealed an association with genomic regions containing several genes controlling the activation and proliferation of tregs including ctla <dig>  cd <dig>  and eos/ikzf <dig>  <cit> .

in conclusion, almost all genes described previously as treg functional genes or in other screening assays were also found in our analysis. these findings confirm that our study is well suitable to identify genes that are important for treg function, differentiation and/or maintenance of their differentiation status.

cis-eqtl genes most likely carry a mutation in the promoter region or contain a structural variation in the transcribed region which results in low expression levels or unstable rna of one but not the other allele. in our study, several cis-eqtl genes were found that were active both in treg and th cells and have a known function in the immune response. for example, stx <dig>  has been associated with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis  <dig> in humans  <cit> .

bxd strains that carry a very low expressing allele inherited from one of the parental strains are similar to genetic knock-down experiments or hypomorphic mutants  <cit> . the function of such genes can be studied in a reverse genetics approach by comparing the mean phenotypes of bxd strains that have inherited either the low or high allele--a method referred to as reverse complex trait analysis. prominent examples of genes that are nature "knock-downs" in the bxd strains, include hc, ahr, gpnmb, tyrp <dig>  sae <dig>  apoa <dig>  and several clec and klra gene family members  <cit> .

 <dig> probesets represented cis-eqtls shared by several tissues, in treg and th cells but also in brain, kidney and lung.

in treg cells,  <dig> probeset were trans-regulated and represented genes that were differently expressed between treg and th cells and that showed a two-fold or higher level of expression  in treg cells. several of them represented genes with a known immune-related function. for example, abcb1a , member 1a) is involved in the down-modulation of dendritic cell functions through the regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion  <cit> . gata <dig>  has been shown to be an important regulator of mast cell differentiation  <cit> . mapkbp <dig>  encodes a protein that enhances nf-kappab activation induced by map kinase kinase kinase  <dig> and tnf receptor-associated factor  <dig>  <cit> . marco  exhibits multiple functions in the innate immune response. marco, tlr <dig>  and cd <dig> are required for macrophage cytokine responses to mycobacterial trehalose dimycolate and mycobacterium tuberculosis  <cit> . marco-deficient mice exhibit lower il- <dig> production in responses to stimulation  <cit> . a defect in marco results in an impaired clearance of apoptotic cells and a generalized defect in both endocytosis and phagocytosis  <cit> . expression of marco is required for tlr signaling  <cit> . but marco also exhibits suppressive functions by decreasing inflammation in lungs after exposure to ozone  <cit> . nr4a2/nurr <dig>  represents a transcriptional mediator of inflammatory signals  <cit> . also, it plays an important role in modulating il- <dig> expression  <cit> .

two genes, laptm4b and lycat exhibited strong trans-eqtl signals in both cell types but at different chromosomal locations. thus, the same genes are expressed in both cell types, but are likely regulated by different mechanisms. laptm4b  is involved in cell proliferation and multidrug resistance  <cit> , whereas no biological function has yet been described for lycat .

none of these genes represents a known treg key gene. our analysis thus allows expanding the list of genes with potentially important functions in treg cells. we did not perform an extensive analysis for trans-eqtls in th cells but a similar result can be expected for th cells.

we then analyzed several trans-eqtls for potential regulator genes in order to propose possible novel gene-regulatory circuits in treg and th cells. these are by far not comprehensive but rather serve as examples to illustrate how our data set will allow searching for possible regulatory networks.

a qtl region was found on chromosome  <dig> that regulates the expression of the f2rl <dig>  receptor-like 1) gene. f2rl1/par <dig> gene expression has been associated with the activation and suppression of inflammatory responses. overexpression of f2rl <dig> in allergic inflammation of the airway exacerbates eosinophil infiltration into the lumen and hyperreactivity of the airway, while f2rl <dig> deletion diminishes inflammatory cell infiltration and reduces hyperreactivity  <cit> . also, f2rl <dig> plays a protective role during influenza virus type a infection through ifn-gamma production and decreased excessive recruitment of inflammatory cells to lung alveoli  <cit>  and deletion of f2rl <dig> is associated with decreased clearance of p. aeruginosa  <cit> . several candidate genes in the chromosome  <dig> qtl interval, which regulates f2rl <dig> expression, exhibited a cis-eqtl and thus represent potential regulators of f2rl <dig> . these include the map3k7/tak <dig>  protein kinase gene which exhibits many immune modulator functions. it mediates activation of ikk  and silencing of map3k <dig> suppressed t cell receptor-dependent ikk activation and interleukin- <dig> production in t cells  <cit> . the zfp <dig>  gene expression has been shown tocorrelate with growth hormone expression and may thus be involved in mediating proliferation signals  <cit> . the analysis of candidate genes in the other qtl regions is discussed in the supplement data.

our analysis of the chromosome  <dig> regions autoimmune trait  <cit>  identified several loci that exhibited a cis-eqtl in treg cells and may thus be involved in regulating this trait: slpi, sys1/2610042o14rik, and znf <dig>  slpi  exhibits many biological functions, including anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, wound healing and immuno-modulatory activities  <cit> . the slpi protein represents a ligand for plscr <dig> and plscr <dig>  which interact directly with the cd <dig> receptor at the cell surface of t lymphocytes  <cit> . slpi is a prominent innate immune protein of the respiratory tract with serine protease inhibitor activity  <cit> . it attenuates excessive inflammatory responses resulting in a balanced innate immunity  <cit> . constitutive expression of slpi reduced the inflammatory response and improved lung function in an acute model of allergic asthma in slpi transgenic and knockout mice  <cit> . the attenuation of the inflammatory response by slpi is mediated through macrophages that secrete an increased amount of slpi when encountering apoptotic cells  <cit> . znf <dig>  is a cotransducer that regulates the activity of the nuclear hormone receptor coactivator nrc  <cit>  which may mediate the function of the ccr <dig> signal  <cit> . no biological functions were identified so far for sys <dig> ). the discussion of candidate genes in the chromosome  <dig> auto-immune qtl interval can be found in the supplemental data.

CONCLUSIONS
our study revealed many novel treg specific genes and also points to genes that may regulate important gene-gene interactions in treg cells. these interactions, once validated, should allow proposing new targets for therapeutic interventions in cancer, auto-immunity, and allergies.
