BACKGROUND

monascus pigments are fungal azaphilone metabolites that consist of three groups of pigment components  that have been used as food colourants in eastern and southeastern asian countries for a long time. the monascus pigment composition mainly consists of two yellow pigments , two orange pigments  and two red pigments , all of which are intracellular pigments. by  <dig>  more than  <dig> pigments produced by monascus. spp were found and identified  <cit> . some of these pigments possess specific bioactivities, such as anti-microbial , anti-tumour , anti-oxidative stress  <cit> , anti-obesity  <cit> , anti-inflammation  <cit>  and anti-diabetes  <cit>  properties.

submerged fermentation  at a low ph can rapidly accumulate a large amount of intracellular orange pigments , independent of the nitrogen sources that are employed  <cit> . additionally, sf can avoid generating the mycotoxin, citrinin  <cit> . in contrast to sf at low ph, extractive fermentation  with triton x- <dig>  facilitates export of intracellular pigments directly to the fermentation broth, preventing intracellular product inhibition and further degradation of the pigments to improve their yield  <cit> . in sf, the intracellular pigments mainly consist of orange pigments  with absorption maxima at 470 nm. however, yellow pigments  were found to dominate both the intracellular and extracellular pigments, which had the same absorption maxima at 410 nm throughout the ef. this phenomenon was due to the export of intracellular yellow pigments and the subsequent blockage of yellow pigment conversion to orange pigments  <cit> .

in this study, a strain of monascus with a high pigment yield was selected and used for pigment production via ef. the differences in pigment fingerprint profiles between sf and ef were investigated in detail.

methods
microorganisms and culture

monascus anka , china), which was maintained on potato dextrose agar plates and preserved at 4 °c, was used for pigment production. a subculture was carried out at 30 °c for 5 days per month.

the inoculum medium consisted of 20 g of glucose, 10 g of peptone, 3 g of yeast extract,  <dig>  g of kcl, 4 g of kh2po <dig>   <dig>  g of znso4•7h2o, and  <dig>  g of feso4•7h2o in 1 l of double-distilled water. for inoculum cultivation, a suspension of spores  was inoculated in 50 ml of the inoculum medium in a 250-ml erlenmeyer flask. the inoculum was cultivated at 30 °c and 180 rpm for 24 h.

the sf medium consisted of 50 g of glucose, 5 g of 2so <dig>   <dig>  g of kcl, 4 g of kh2po <dig>   <dig>  g of znso4•7h2o,  <dig>  g of mgso4•7h2o, and  <dig>  g of feso4•7h2o per litre of double-distilled water. for ef, a certain amount of tx- <dig> was feed to the fermentation medium at a specific time as indicated. before inoculation, the ph of all the fermentation media was adjusted to  <dig>  with 10%  hydrochloric acid. for fermentation cultures, an aliquot of the inoculum culture  was inoculated into 50 ml of fermentation medium. the fermentation was carried out at 30 °c and 180 rpm for  <dig>  days.

for direct extraction of the intracellular pigments using 50 ml of 50 g/l tx- <dig> aqueous solution  hydrochloric acid) was made in a 250-ml erlenmeyer flask, and it was added to  <dig>  g aliquots of wet mycelia after 6 days of sf, which were collected under a vacuum through a  <dig>  mm mixed cellulose esters membrane and then washed thoroughly with double-distilled water. meanwhile, as a control, the fermentation supernatant from  <dig>  days of sf without mycelia was also collected, and tx- <dig> was added to a final concentration of 50 g/l . then, 50 ml of this solution was added to  <dig>  g aliquots of wet mycelia after 6 days of sf in a 250-ml erlenmeyer flask. the erlenmeyer flasks were incubated at 30 °c and 180 rpm.

analytical methods
pigment, biomass and residual glucose analyses
the fermentation broth in the erlenmeyer flasks was filtered under vacuum through a  <dig>  mm mixed cellulose ester membrane. the collected filtrate  was normalized to a volume of 50 ml for analysis of extracellular pigments. the mycelia remaining on the membrane were thoroughly washed with double distilled water until the runoff was almost colourless or foamless, and they were then resuspended in 50 ml of acidic aqueous ethanol   <cit>  and incubated for 1 h at 30 °c with intermittent shaking. the acidic aqueous ethanol was used to prevent pigment shifting and amination reactions of orange pigments with amino compounds. the suspension was then filtered with pre-weighed filter paper. the filtrate  was subjected to analysis of the intracellular pigments, and the mycelia remaining on the filter were dried to a constant weight at 60 °c to determine their biomass . the comprehensive spectra of the extracellular pigments  and intracellular pigments  were recorded using a uv/vis spectrophotometer  from 350 nm to 550 nm at 1 nm intervals. the absorbance units  at specific wavelengths  were used as an index of the extracellular pigment concentration. the residual glucose was quantified using a standard  <dig> -dinitrosalicylic acid  method.

pigment analysis using hplc-pdad, hplc-fld and tlc
analytical hplc was performed with an alliance e <dig> system  using a  <dig> photodiode array detector   and a  <dig> multi-wavelength fluorescence detector  . a sunfire c <dig> column  was used and the column temperature was 30 °c. mobile phase a  and mobile phase b  were used according to the following gradients at a 1 ml/min flow rate: 0 min, 20% b; 25 min, 80% b; 35 min, 80% b; 36 min, 20% b; and 41 min, 20% b. the padd was set to 200–600 nm for recording the uv-vis spectra of the pigments. when recording the pigment profiles and concentrations, the detection wavelength was set to 310 nm. with the fld, the pigment excitation spectra were recorded from 300 nm to 500 nm at 10 nm intervals using a 565 nm emission wavelength and emission spectra of pigments were recorded from 400 nm to 700 nm at 15 nm intervals using a 331 nm excitation wavelength. thin-layer chromatography  analysis was conducted using a silica gel 60 f <dig> tlc plate  with n-hexane/ethyl acetate/petroleum ether  as the developing solvent.

determination of the pigment composition using lc-ms
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry  was performed using an hp <dig> hplc system  and a microtof-qii mass spectrometer . the c <dig> column and chromatographic conditions were the same as the conditions mentioned above, except for mobile phase a . the extracellular broth containing high concentrations of tx- <dig> was processed in advance to remove as much tx- <dig> as possible before lc-ms analysis. during processing,  <dig> -day ef extracellular broth was mixed with isometric diethyl ether to form a winsor i microemulsion at 4 °c to remove tx- <dig>  <cit> . the organic solvent phase  was collected and diethyl ether was removed by rotary evaporation at 36 °c. the residue was redissolved in an aqueous solution  hydrochloric acid), and then the aqueous solution with residue was subjected to microemulsion extraction again. after  <dig> successive microemulsion extractions, the residue was redissolved in chloroform and a type of post-alkali treated macroporous resin was added to the chloroform. then, the pigments that were absorbed in the resin were eluted with methanol  hydrochloric acid). the pigments collected after elution were redissolved in chloroform and then submitted to macroporous resin absorption again. in total, the macroporous resin absorption and elution of pigments was successively conducted  <dig> times to further remove tx- <dig>  the residual pigments were then redissolved in acidic aqueous ethanol  for lc-ms analysis.

RESULTS
characteristics of pigment metabolism in ef
as shown in fig. 1a and b, in traditional submerged fermentation without triton x- <dig> addition , the pigments mainly accumulated intracellularly, and the au <dig> can reach  <dig> after  <dig>  days of fermentation. compared to the production of intracellular pigments, the production of extracellular pigments were extremely low, and the au <dig> was approximately only  <dig>  on day  <dig> , the intracellular au470/extracellular au <dig> ratio was  <dig> , and the intracellular au410/extracellular au <dig> was  <dig> . both the intracellular and extracellular pigment metabolisms were coupled to cell growth. the logarithmic phase of cell growth began on the 1st day and lasted until nearly the 5th day. the highest biomass  was  <dig>  g/l on the 5th day. cell growth and pigment production during ef  showed notable differences compared to sf in the beginning . the highest production of intracellular pigments were obtained on the 4th day when the au at 470 nm reached  <dig>  however, they decreased sharply after this day. the production of extracellular pigments kept increasing during the entire fermentation, and the final au at 410 nm reached  <dig>  the extracellular accumulation of pigments was significant after  <dig>  days of fermentation. the intracellular au470/extracellular au <dig> ratio was  <dig>  and the intracellular au410/extracellular au410/extracellular au <dig> ratio was  <dig> . the metabolism of the intracellular pigments was coupled to cell growth, but the metabolism of extracellular pigments was not. it was clear that intracellular pigment production lagged for one day. the logarithmic phase of cell growth was shorter and began on the 1st day and stopped on the 3rd day. compared to sf, ef had much faster glucose consumption. however, cell growth was actually inhibited to some extent, and the highest biomass was only  <dig>  g/l.fig.  <dig> cell growth, glucose consumption, and intracellular and extracellular pigment production during sf  or ef . comprehensive spectra of intracellular  and extracellular  pigments after  <dig>  days of sf or ef




the comprehensive spectra of the pigments produced during sf and ef showed significant differences . the extracellular pigment spectra from sf had absorption maxima at approximately 350 nm. however, the pigments from ef showed absorption maxima at 430 nm. the intracellular pigment spectra from sf presented absorption maxima at 470 nm, which indicated that orange pigments were the dominant intracellular pigments. however, in ef, in addition to absorption maxima at 470 nm, the intracellular pigment spectra also had a higher shoulder at 405 nm, which indicated yellow pigments  also accounted for a large proportion.

pigment fingerprint profiles and the production of four new yellow pigments during ef
because the yield of extracellular water-soluble pigments was extremely low, the pigment analysis was focused on low-polarity pigments. as shown in fig. 2a, the hplc pigment fingerprint profile indicated that the intracellular pigments from sf and ef, and the extracellular pigments in sf were mainly low-polarity compounds. it was obvious that compounds  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were found in the intracellular pigments in sf  and ef  and the extracellular pigments in ef . however, interestingly, besides the four original intracellular pigments  produced by monascus strains, ef also produced a large amount of the other four compounds y <dig>  y <dig>  y <dig> and y <dig> . these four compounds were not produced as extracellular or intracellular pigments in sf.fig.  <dig> hplc profiles  of extracellular pigments of ef  or sf , and intracellular pigments of ef  or sf  on the  <dig> th day. the y axis for chromatogram c was adjusted appropriately to make the peaks were shown completely. tlc analysis  of extracellular pigments of sf  or ef  and intracellular pigments of sf  or ef  on the  <dig> th day. the upper image of tlc was taken under ultraviolet light . the lower image of tlc was taken under natural light




compounds  <dig> and  <dig> were identified as monascin and ankaflavin  by comparison of their uv-vis spectra and molecular weights with data available in the literature   <cit> . compounds  <dig> and  <dig> were identified as rubropunctatin and monascorubrin , respectively, by comparison with data available in the literature   <cit> . y1-y <dig> had nearly identical uv-vis spectra with three absorption maxima at approximately  <dig>   <dig> and 430 nm , indicating that they were pigments with a yellow colour, as shown through tlc . in addition, as measured by fld, the results also showed the same fluorescence excitation  spectra with two absorption maxima at approximately  <dig> and 420 nm as well as the same fluorescence emission  spectra with absorption maxima at approximately 565 nm . the fluorescence spectra absorption maxima at 565 nm indicated that the four pigments had orange fluorescence under specific excitation wavelengths; these results were also confirmed by the presence of orange fluorescent bands on the tlc plate under ultraviolet light  . the molecular weights of y <dig>  y <dig>  y <dig> and y <dig> were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. thus, based on their uv-vis spectra, fluorescence spectra and molecular weights, the four compounds have not been described or reported before.table  <dig> chemical characteristics of extracellular monascus pigments during ef

the time course for pigment production during ef was recorded based on the pigment peak area variations . these peak area time courses were mainly used to describe the relative variation of the pigment amount. as shown in fig. 4a and b, extracellular y <dig>  y <dig>  y <dig> and y <dig>  as well as extracellular monascin and ankaflavin, increased rapidly at the early and middle stage of fermentation. y <dig> and y <dig> kept increasing until the 5th day, y <dig> and y <dig> increased rapidly in the first four days and then increased slightly in the next  <dig>  days. at the later stage of fermentation the concentration of intracellular monascin and rubropunctatin was almost  <dig>  and  <dig>  times higher than the extracellular concentration of monascin and rubropunctatin. during the last  <dig>  days, intracellular rubropunctatin and monascorubrin sharply decreased, and their amount on day  <dig>  was less than 1/ <dig> of the amount on the 4th day . extracellular monascorubrin increased until the 5th day, while extracellular rubropunctatin increased during the first 3 days and decreased in the following  <dig>  days. both the intracellular and extracellular amounts of monascorubrin were maintained at higher levels than rubropunctatin.fig.  <dig> variation of the peak area of extracellular  and intracellular  pigments during ef measured by hplc-pda




effect of the concentration and feeding time point of tx- <dig> on pigment fingerprint profiles
different tx- <dig> concentrations impact the content of extracellular and intracellular pigments . the content of extracellular pigments increased significantly with increases of the tx- <dig> concentration , and when the tx- <dig> concentration was 100 g/l, the au <dig> reached as high as  <dig>  however, y <dig>  y <dig>  y <dig> and y <dig> were detected and accounted for a large proportion of the extracellular pigment fraction despite the different tx- <dig> concentrations , which resulted in the same absorption maxima of the extracellular pigments at approximately 430 nm . in contrast to the extracellular pigment content, the intracellular pigment content, especially for rubropunctatin and monascorubrin, decreased significantly with increases of the tx- <dig> concentration . when tx- <dig> concentration increase from 10 g/l to 100 g/l, the content of intracellular rubropunctatin and monascorubrin  decreased from  <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig>  respectively, to  <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig>  respectively. the intracellular pigments mainly consisted of the two major orange pigments  and the two major yellow pigments  . however, the proportion of each pigment was very different. the intracellular pigments were dominated by the orange pigments  when the tx- <dig> concentration was 10 g/l. when the tx- <dig> concentration was 50 g/l, the proportion of yellow pigments  in the intracellular pigment fraction increased substantially, and the intracellular pigment spectra had absorption maxima at 470 nm with a higher shoulder at approximately 410 nm . when the concentration was 100 g/l, the proportion of yellow pigments was higher, and the intracellular pigment spectra had absorption maxima at approximately 420 nm with no absorption maxima at 470 nm . the final dcw for ef with  <dig>   <dig> and 100 g/l tx- <dig> was  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l, respectively. therefore, there was no significant difference among dcw under different concentration of tx- <dig> fig.  <dig> hplc profiles of extracellular  and intracellular  pigments, and comprehensive spectra of extracellular  and intracellular  pigments in ef with different tx- <dig> concentrations . the total fermentation time was  <dig>  days




for testing the effect of tx- <dig> feeding time point on the pigment profiles, tx- <dig> was feed at different fermentation times at a concentration of 50 g/l. the different tx- <dig> feeding time points had an impact on both the extracellular and intracellular pigment content . feeding tx- <dig> on the 6th day gave the highest intracellular pigment content and the lowest extracellular pigment content . the highest extracellular pigment content was obtained when tx- <dig> was feed on the 4th day. feeding tx- <dig> at an early fermentation stage was shown to give lower amounts of intracellular pigments. the earlier feeding time points would lead to the more thorough exportation of intracellular pigments, especially for the intracellular orange pigments. as shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  the content of two intracellular orange pigments were around 1 ×  <dig> when tx- <dig> was feed at the beginning and the 2nd day, whereas the content of two intracellular orange pigments were around  <dig>  ×  <dig> when tx- <dig> was feed at the 4th and 6th day. whenever tx- <dig> was feed, the extracellular pigments, which had spectra with the same absorption maxima at 430 nm, were also dominated by y <dig>  y <dig>  y <dig> and y <dig> . the intracellular pigments were dominated by the orange pigments when tx- <dig> was feed at a late fermentation stage . however, at an early fermentation stage , the yellow pigments were a larger proportion of the intracellular pigments .fig.  <dig> hplc profiles of extracellular  and intracellular  pigments, and comprehensive spectra of extracellular  and intracellular  pigments in ef with different tx- <dig>  feeding time point . the total fermentation time was  <dig>  days




pigment fingerprint profiles in a tx- <dig> aqueous solution extraction of mycelia from submerged fermentation

y <dig>  y <dig>  y <dig> and y <dig> were found when tx- <dig> was feed on the 6th day. similar to the organic solvent, the tx- <dig> aqueous solution could also directly extract intracellular pigments from the mycelia. it was mentioned before that sf can only produce the two yellow  and two orange pigments  . to determine if direct extraction with tx- <dig> aqueous solution could yield y <dig>  y <dig>  y <dig> and y <dig>  wet mycelia from 6 days of sf were placed into 50 g/l tx- <dig> aqueous solution  and incubated at 30 °c and 180 rpm. then, the extracellular extract profiles were analysed using hplc-pdad and uv-vis spectroscopy . meanwhile, a control group was examined by placing wet mycelia from 6 days of sf into the fermentation supernatant from 6 days of sf without mycelia , and the extracellular extract profiles of this group were shown in fig. 7c. it was very obvious that a direct extraction with a tx- <dig> aqueous solution could not produce y <dig>  y <dig>  y <dig> and y <dig> and could only extract the intracellular pigments  into the extracellular broth. the spectra of the extracellular extract presented an absorption maximum at approximately 447 nm and a high shoulder at approximately 474 nm . additionally, when this direct extracellular extract was mixed with isometric broth from 6 days of sf , the profile of the mixture showed no differences between different incubation times. however, large amounts of y <dig>  y <dig>  y <dig> and y <dig> were produced in the control group, and the amount increased substantially over time . these results indicated that the production of y <dig>  y <dig>  y <dig> and y <dig> was closely related to the cellular metabolism of monascus.fig.  <dig> hplc profiles  and comprehensive spectra  of extracellular extract from 6-day sf wet mycelia with a 50 g/l tx- <dig> aqueous solution ; hplc profiles  and comprehensive spectra  of extracellular extract from 6-day sf wet mycelia with the fermentation supernatant from 6 days of sf without mycelia 




discussion
in our previous study, ef with tx- <dig> successfully exported intracellular pigments to the extracellular broth, leading to the accumulation of high amounts of extracellular and intracellular pigments with the same absorption maxima at 410 nm that mainly consisted of yellow pigments  and ankaflavin )  <cit> . however, under the same fermentation conditions, sf mainly produces intracellular orange pigments  and monascorubrin ) with absorption maxima at 470 nm. this interesting phenomenon may be related to the export of intracellular yellow pigments to the extracellular broth by tx- <dig> and the subsequent prevention of the conversion of yellow pigments into orange pigments. however, in this study, a strain with a high pigment yield  showed substantial differences with ef. during sf, this strain still mainly accumulated intracellular orange pigments  with absorption maxima at 470 nm . however, during ef, the intracellular pigments were dominated by neither the yellow pigments nor the orange pigments. both the yellow and orange pigments were produced at high levels in the intracellular pigment fraction , resulting in intracellular pigment spectra having an absorption maximum at 470 nm and a high shoulder at 405 nm . in addition to the yellow and orange pigments , ef produced four new yellow pigments with strong orange fluorescence , which all had the same absorption maximum at approximately 430 nm . the four new pigments were a large proportion of the extracellular pigments , resulting in the comprehensive spectrum of the extracellular pigments having an absorption maximum at approximately 430 nm .

the tx- <dig> aqueous solution can directly extract the intracellular pigments . from the 1st to 4th day of ef, the biosynthesis rate of intracellular pigments was higher than the extraction rate of intracellular pigments with tx- <dig>  therefore, both the extracellular and intracellular pigments accumulated rapidly . approaching the end of ef, the biosynthesis rate slowed down or even ceased, but the extraction rate with tx- <dig> remained high. therefore, the intracellular pigments decreased sharply in the last  <dig>  days. however, as shown in fig. 7a and c, the accumulation of extracellular pigments during ef cannot be attributed to only the direct extraction of intracellular pigments with tx- <dig> because direct extraction with tx- <dig> aqueous solution can only export the intracellular pigments  but cannot give rise to the four new yellow pigments . bioconversion among the pigments must exist, resulting in the formation of the four new yellow pigments.

an interesting phenomenon during the last  <dig>  days of ef was that the reduction of intracellular rubropunctatin and monascorubrin was not equivalent to the incremental increase of extracellular rubropunctatin and monascorubrin . the reduction of intracellular monascorubrin was more than  <dig> times greater than the extracellular monascorubrin increase. furthermore, both intracellular and extracellular rubropunctatin decreased. therefore, this remarkable phenomena indicated that the significant missing rubropunctatin and monascorubrin might be the sources of y <dig>  y <dig>  y <dig> and y <dig>  meanwhile, the accumulation of y <dig>  y <dig>  y <dig> and y <dig> were closely related to the level of the exportation of intracellular orange pigments. the experiments investigating the effect of tx- <dig> concentration also support this deduction . the different tx- <dig> concentration had no effect on the final dcw. however, with increases of the tx- <dig> concentration, intracellular rubropunctatin and monascorubrin decreased significantly , and extracellular y <dig>  y <dig>  y <dig> and y <dig> increased significantly . these results are consistent with a previous study, which found that the exportation of intracellular pigments intensified as tx- <dig> concentrations increased  <cit> . higher tx- <dig> concentrations helped to export more intracellular pigments and thus left a low level of intracellular pigments. especially, when tx- <dig> concentration increase from 10 g/l to 100 g/l, the reduction of intracellular rubropunctatin and monascorubrin  was approximately  <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig>  respectively , however, the increase of extracellular rubropunctatin and monascorubrin  was approximately  <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig>  respectively . the reduction of intracellular rubropunctatin and monascorubrin was almost than  <dig> and  <dig> times greater than the extracellular rubropunctatin and monascorubrin increase when tx- <dig> concentration increase from 10 g/l to 100 g/l. what is more, when tx- <dig> concentration increase from 10 g/l to 100 g/l, the reduction of intracellular monascin  and ankaflavin  was almost equivalent to the incremental increase of extracellular monascin  and ankaflavin . this results also strongly supported the aforementioned deduction that the missing rubropunctatin and monascorubrin might be the sources of y <dig>  y <dig>  y <dig> and y <dig> 


y <dig>  y <dig>  y <dig> and y <dig> had the same uv-vis and fluorescence spectra , indicating that they share a unique chromophore. the difference in the molecular weight between these pigments also indicated that rubropunctatin and monascorubrin might be the sources of y <dig>  y <dig>  y <dig> and y <dig>  the difference in molecular weight between y <dig> and y <dig> and between y <dig> and y <dig> was  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . the molecular weight difference between rubropunctatin and monascorubrin is  <dig> , which indicated that y <dig> and y <dig> might be formed form the conversion of rubropunctatin and monascorubrin, respectively. the difference of molecular weight between y <dig> and rubropunctatin  was almost the same as that between y <dig> and monascorubrin . this indicated that y <dig> and y2might be formed by the same modification of rubropunctatin and monascorubrin, respectively. however, the difference of molecular weight between y <dig> and rubropunctatin  and between y <dig> and monascorubrin . therefore, y <dig> and y <dig> might be due to the different modification of rubropunctatin and monascorubrin.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, ef with monascus anka gim  <dig>  not only caused the export of intracellular pigments to the extracellular broth, which led to a high yield of extracellular yellow pigments , but also altered the composition of pigments. the pigment fingerprint profile from ef showed significant differences from that of traditional sf. in addition to the four original intracellular pigments , four new yellow pigments  were detected, and these pigments dominated the extracellular pigment fraction. furthermore, the results indicated that y1-y <dig> may be formed by bioconversion of orange pigments . these results provide information and a detailed view of the composition and variation of pigments from ef and could also contribute to the elucidation of pigment metabolism during ef.
