BACKGROUND
bacterial leaf blight  is one of the most devastating diseases on rice, causing annual yield losses up to 60%  <cit> . the causal agent, xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae  is a rod-shaped, obligately aerobic, gram-negative bacterium that is motile by means of a single polar flagellum. like many other xanthomonas species, xoo produces a wide variety of virulence factors to protect itself and inflict disease. these factors include extracellular polysaccharides , lipopolysaccharides, adhesins, cell wall degrading enzymes, and type iii effectors  <cit> . most of these traits are under tight control of quorum sensing  regulatory systems.

qs is a cell-to-cell communication system by which bacteria track changes in cell density and adjust gene expression accordingly. central to qs is the production, detection, and response to extracellular signal molecules called autoinducers . at low cell density, bacteria produce basal levels of ais, which subsequently diffuse away in the environment, preventing detection by bacterial receptor proteins. however, as the population density reaches a certain threshold level, accumulated ais are easily detected, setting off a variety of biological processes including eps biosynthesis, motility, competence, and virulence factor secretion  <cit> . as such, qs enables unicellular bacteria to act as multicellular organisms and invest in energy-consuming processes only when the impact of these processes on the environment or on a host will be maximized.

it is well-established that xoo produces different types of ais, including the diffusible signal factor  molecule cis-11-methyl-2-dodecenoic acid  <cit> . originally identified in xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris , dsf and its derivatives represent a relatively novel family of qs signals that is widely conserved among gram-negative bacterial species. so far, different dsf-family signals have been identified and functionally characterized in a range of plant and human bacterial pathogens, including xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris , xyllela fastidiosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and burkholderia cenocepacia  <cit> . biosynthesis of dsf depends on rpfb and rpff, which encode a fatty acyl-coa ligase and a putative enoyl-coa hydratase, respectively  <cit> . according to recent findings, rpfb is not directly involved in dsf biosynthesis but influences fatty acid recycling to counteract the thioesterase activity of rpff  <cit> . downstream of dsf synthesis, perception and transduction of dsf signals occurs through a conserved phosphorelay mechanism governed by the rpfc/rpfg two-component system  <cit> . interestingly, rpfc not only senses dsf, but also negatively regulates dsf biosynthesis via direct protein-protein interactions  <cit> , while rpfg transmits dsf signals by influencing the level of the secondary qs messenger cyclic-di-gmp. consistent with dsf signaling playing a vital role in xoo virulence, null mutants of rpfc and rpfg display reduced xylanase activity, swimming ability and eps synthesis, and consequently, cause little disease when inoculated on rice plants  <cit> .

in addition to dsf-governed qs, there is evidence for a second qs circuit in xoo that appears to be mediated by a diffusible factor  characterized as 3-hydroxybenzoic acid . as in xcc, this df system has been found to regulate the production of yellow, membrane-bound pigments, known as xanthomonadins  <cit> . of particular note, df not only controls the biosynthesis of xanthomonadins but also is incorporated into the metabolite itself, questioning its status as a qs signal sensu stricto. besides being a diagnostic characteristic of the genus  <cit> , xanthomonadins play essential roles in protecting bacteria from photobiological and peroxidative damage and are involved in epiphytic survival and systemic plant infection  <cit> . goel et al.  demonstrated that xanthomonadin synthesis in xoo strain bxo <dig> is encoded by a  <dig> kb gene cluster that contains seven transcriptional units, designated piga to pigg  <cit> . analysis of the pigb dna sequence revealed the presence of two open reading frames, the second one  being responsible for synthesis of df  <cit> . recent results indicate that xanb <dig> also hydrolyzes chorismate to produce 4-hba, which is mainly used as a precursor for coenzyme q  biosynthesis  <cit> .

in addition to the canonical dsf- and df-mediated qs systems that consist of a luxi-family synthase responsible for synthesizing the qs signal and a cognate luxr-family transcriptional regulator that binds qs factors at quorum concentrations, xoo also harbors the luxr solo protein oryr. lacking of cognate luxi proteins, luxr solos regulate target genes by either sensing endogenous qs factors or by ‘eavesdropping’ on exogenous factors produced by neighbouring bacteria. however, some solos can also respond to low-molecular weight compounds produced by plants. oryr, for instance, is known to interact with an unknown rice signal molecule  to activate plant virulence genes  <cit> . as such, luxr-like solos function as messengers of both interspecies and interkingdom signaling  <cit> .

in plants, signaling pathways are typically controlled by small-molecule hormones. upon pathogen attack, plants synthesize a complex blend of hormones. this so-called hormone signature is well known to play a key role in the orchestration of plant immune responses and to determine the specific nature of the defense mechanism triggered  <cit> . however, exciting new developments suggest that plant hormones not only steer plant immune responses, but also may influence the pathogen’s virulence machinery. for instance, a recent study showed that sa reduces virulence of agrobacterium tumefaciens by inhibiting the vira/g two-component system  <cit> . moreover, in the opportunistic human pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa, sa was reported to reduce the production of several virulence factors including motility, biofilm formation and ai production  <cit> .

in view of these findings, we hypothesized that plant hormones may fulfill a dual role in plant-bacteria interactions, modulating plant immune responses, on the one hand, and acting as agonists of bacterial qs systems on the other. to test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of the plant hormones abscisic acid  and salicylic acid  on several qs-regulated virulence traits of xoo, including motility, production of eps and xanthomonadin synthesis. sa is a positive regulator of resistance to xoo  <cit> , whereas aba antagonizes sa and acts as a susceptibility-enhancing hormone that is usurped by xoo in order to cause disease  <cit> . reversely, we also tested the effect of the xoo qs signals dsf and df on the rice sa and aba pathways. together, our findings favor a scenario whereby sa and aba cross-communicate with the dfs and df qs circuits to modulate xoo virulence and underscore the importance of bidirectional interkingdom signaling in molding plant-bacteria interactions.

RESULTS
nasa suppresses bacterial swimming in a dose-dependent manner
mounting evidence indicates that sa is an important player in the activation of rice defenses against xoo  <cit> . in a first attempt to test whether sa also exerts direct effects on the qs machinery of xoo, we evaluated the effect of sa on the swimming ability of xoo strain xkk <dig> . unless specified otherwise, this strain was routinely used throughout this paper. since sa showed strong inhibition of bacterial growth in both liquid and solid medium in our preliminary trials, all following experiments were performed using sodium salicylate , which had no significant impact on xkk <dig> growth rates on solid agar plates . swim plates indicated that xkk <dig> is motile in swimming medium, reaching a diameter of about  <dig> mm after 4- <dig> days of incubation at 25°c. as shown in figures 1a to 1c, nasa at concentrations of  <dig> μm,  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  mm had little or no significant effect on the swimming ability of xkk <dig>  whereas  <dig> mm and  <dig> mm of nasa significantly reduced swimming. sa concentrations in basal rice leaves range from  <dig> to  <dig> μg/g fresh weight  <cit> . to shed light on the sa concentrations in pathogen-inoculated rice leaves, we used a previously published uplc-ms/ms method to profile the hormone signature of xoo-infected rice plants at various times post inoculation  <cit> . consistent with previous reports, sa levels remained fairly constant throughout the course of infection, except for a late two-fold increase at  <dig> dpi . at this time point, sa levels reached 613235 ±  <dig> pmol/g fw, which corresponds to  <dig>  mm sa. supplying bacteria with  <dig> or  <dig> mm nasa thus resembles the amount of sa encountered by xoo in planta, demonstrating the physiological relevance of these concentrations.figure  <dig>

motility of xoo is under control of the dsf qs system, with dsf signaling either promoting or suppressing swimming depending on the bacterial strain  <cit> . under our experimental conditions,  <dig> μm dsf, which is the lowest concentration reported to be effective in xoo  <cit> , significantly increased swimming of xkk <dig> . interestingly, co-application of  <dig> μm dsf and  <dig> mm nasa alleviated the swimming-promoting effect of single dsf treatments, while  <dig> mm nasa completely abolished it . together these results suggest that nasa suppresses swimming of xkk <dig> in a concentration-dependent manner, possibly by antagonizing dsf-mediated signaling.

swimming motility of xoo was previously shown to be controlled by oryr, which belongs to a sub-family of the n-acyl homoserine lactone  responding luxr regulators  <cit> . to assess whether nasa suppresses swimming in an oryr-dependent manner, we tested the effect of nasa on wt bacteria and the oryr knockout mutant . consistent with earlier findings by gonzalez et al.  <cit>  demonstrating that the effect of oryr on bacterial swimming is only observed upon addition of macerated rice extract to the medium, wt and oryr− mutant bacteria swam to a similar extent when grown on control plates . perhaps more surprisingly, the oryr− mutant proved to be non-responsive to dsf-induced swimming, while nasa treatment turned out to be equally effective in the wt and mutant background . thus, oryr seems to be indispensable for dsf-induced swimming, whereas nasa may suppress swimming independently of oryr.

nasa induces eps production in xkk <dig> via oryr
in many bacteria, synthesis of extracellular polysaccharides  is a key determinant of biofilm formation and, hence, an inhibitory factor of motility  <cit> . given that nasa inhibits swimming of xkk <dig>  we sought to extend our analysis by testing the influence of nasa on biofilm formation and eps synthesis of xoo. unfortunately, classic biofilm assays using crystal violet staining failed to show consistent bacterial attachment to polystyrene culture plates, suggesting that xkk <dig> does not form biofilms under the conditions we tested . when xkk <dig> was grown on solid peptone sucrose agar  plates, nasa showed no effect on bacterial growth but significantly enhanced eps synthesis . in several preliminary assays liquid xkk <dig> cultures grown in the presence of  <dig> mm nasa also consistently produced more eps than the control treatment at  <dig> h post inoculation . therefore, and given the tractability of liquid assays, all follow-up experiments were performed using liquid xkk <dig> cultures.figure  <dig>

previous work revealed that eps production is impaired in the xoo rpff knockout mutant but restored by exogenous addition of dsf  <cit> , suggesting a positive role for dsf in regulating eps production in xoo. consistent with these results and as shown in figure 2b,  <dig> μm dsf significantly increased eps synthesis in xkk <dig>  a similar promoting effect was observed for  <dig> mm nasa, whereas co-application of both compounds had no additive effect. interestingly, nasa-induced eps synthesis was much less pronounced in the oryr− mutant background but restored in the oryr− complemented strain , suggesting that nasa stimulates eps production in xkk <dig> in an oryr-dependent manner. consistent with this hypothesis, qrt-pcr analysis showed that  <dig> mm nasa strongly up-regulated the expression of both oryr and the eps biosynthesis gene gumg compared with control treatments . moreover, β-glucuronidase reporter assays revealed that nasa also caused an approximate 50% increase in oryr promoter activity .

nasa stimulates dsf signaling pathway by inducing dsf biosynthesis
the finding that nasa induces transcription of the luxr solo oryr led us to analyze whether nasa likewise influences the dsf qs system. for this purpose, we first tested the effect of nasa on the expression of various genes located in the dsf signaling cascade. rpff, rpfc, and rpfg are dsf biosynthesis, response and signaling genes, respectively  <cit> , while pila encodes an adhesion protein involved in biofilm formation and motility  <cit> . remarkably, all of these genes were several fold up-regulated by  <dig> mm nasa treatment, suggesting that nasa activates the entire dsf pathway, possibly by inducing dsf biosynthesis. to test this hypothesis, we quantified the effect of nasa on the biosynthesis of dsf and the dsf-like signals bdsf and cdsf using hplc  <cit> . since dsf levels in wild-type xoo are too low to be reliably measured, an dsf-overproducing rpfc mutant strain was used in these assays  <cit> . as shown in figure 3b, nasa did not significantly influence bdsf production but caused a nearly 50% increase in dsf levels, while cdsf remained below the quantification limit.figure  <dig>

nasa induces 3-hba and 4-hba production in xkk12
in addition to oryr and the dsf qs system, xoo is equipped with an alternative qs circuit that is mediated by the df signal and controls production of xanthomonadin. interestingly, xkk <dig> bacteria grown on psa plates containing  <dig> mm nasa produced about 60% more xanthomonadin compared with the control . consistent with these findings, nasa-supplemented bacteria also displayed increased expression of the xanthomonadin- and df-biosynthesis gene xanb <dig> . moreover, hplc-based measurements revealed that nasa stimulates the production of 3-hba  and 4-hba in a dose-dependent manner . besides inducing dsf signaling, nasa thus also appears to activate the df qs circuit, with resultant accumulation of xanthomonadin.figure  <dig>

aba promotes swimming of xkk <dig> in an oryr-dependent manner
previously, we showed that aba antagonizes sa signaling in rice, thereby favoring blb disease development  <cit> . in a first attempt to investigate whether aba, like sa, acts as a qs agonist, we tested the effect of increasing concentrations of aba on the swimming ability of xkk <dig>  after  <dig> days of incubation, bacteria cultured on plates containing either  <dig> μm,  <dig> μm or  <dig> μm of aba showed enhanced swimming compared to the solvent-treated controls, whereas  <dig> μm aba had no significant effect . importantly, none of these concentrations had a significant impact on the growth characteristics of xkk <dig> , suggesting that aba concentrations above 1μm promote swimming without any clear dose-response.figure  <dig>

given the positive role of oryr in promoting bacterial swimming, we next compared the effect of  <dig> μm aba on wt and oryr− bacteria. interestingly, aba treatment was ineffective in the oryr− background whereas it significantly enlarged the swimming zone in wt bacteria . consistent with previous findings, complementing the oryr− mutant by introducing the oryr gene in the high-copy plasmid pbbroryr significantly decreased swimming as compared to wt bacteria, a phenomenon which is likely explained by the overexpression of oryr in a multicopy plasmid and the self-negative regulation of oryr  <cit> . nevertheless, complementation of oryr- did restore aba-induced swimming, indicating that oryr is indispensable for aba-mediated swimming .

to test whether aba, like sa, affects oryr expression, we next investigated the transcriptional behavior of oryr in xkk <dig> wt ppip <dig> grown in py broth containing  <dig> μm aba. as shown in figure 5d, aba had little effect on the expression of oryr and, according to our β-glucuronidase assays, also failed to induce oryr promoter activity . moreover, growing bacteria in the presence of aba did not significantly alter the expression of the oryr-regulated flagellar genes flgl, flgf, flhf and chez  <cit> , suggesting that aba-induced swimming of xoo does not involve transcriptional activation of oryr or its target genes .

aba has little impact on the dsf and df qs circuits
the finding that nasa induces several genes located in the dsf and df qs pathways  prompted us to check whether aba exerted a similar effect. however, as shown in figure 6a, aba had no statistically significant impact on the expression of any of the df and dsf-related genes tested. aba also failed to significantly alter the synthesis of bdsf and dsf, but slightly repressed 3-hba and weakly enhanced 4-hba synthesis, which has also been implicated in eps and xanthomonadin regulation  <cit>  . nevertheless, we found aba to be ineffective in both eps and xanthomonadin assays . except for stimulating swimming via a yet to be defined mechanism, aba therefore seems to have little effect on the dsf and df qs circuits, neither on the virulence traits mediated by them.figure  <dig>

dsf and df differentially impact rice aba and sa signaling pathways
apart from coordinating expression of microbial virulence genes, bacteria-produced qs signals have also been shown to interfere with the host hormone signaling circuitry  <cit> . therefore and given the importance of sa-aba signal interactions in blb resistance  <cit> , we evaluated the impact of exogenously administered dsf and df on rice sa and aba signaling pathways. to this end, detached leaves of 6-week-old rice taipei plants were treated with either low or high concentrations of dsf and df and tested for expression of several aba and sa-responsive marker genes. as shown in figure  <dig>  expression of the sa marker genes, oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig> and osnpr <dig> was only weakly responsive to either  <dig> or  <dig> μm dsf, suggesting that dsf has little, if any, impact on the rice sa pathway. in addition,  <dig> μm dsf barely altered the expression of the aba marker gene osrab <dig> at either  <dig> or  <dig> hours post treatment while it had a significant albeit minor suppressive effect on transcription of another marker gene oslip <dig> . suppression of oslip <dig> was also observed in response to df at  <dig> hpt, whereas osrab <dig> was upregulated by  <dig> μm df at  <dig> hpt . in addition, both  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm df treatments significantly lowered transcription of osnpr <dig>  oswrky <dig> and oswrky <dig> at  <dig> but not at  <dig> hpt, suggesting that df is able to transiently suppress sa signaling.figure  <dig>

discussion
the interaction between pathogens and their host plants has been the subject of intense research. contrary to the large body of evidence demonstrating the pivotal role of hormones in orchestrating the plant immune signaling network, surprisingly little is known about whether hormones also impinge on the virulence machinery of plant pathogens, similar to what has been reported in animal systems. in one of the most notable examples, the enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli  serotype o157:h <dig>  a pathogen responsible for outbreaks of bloody diarrhea in several countries, was shown to exploit the mammalian hormone epinephrine in order to activate its qs machinery  <cit> . similarly, several reports in the literature have revealed a negative impact of the plant hormone sa on virulence gene expression in the opportunistic human pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> . in turn, several ahl qs factors have been shown to exert immunomodulatory activities in animal hosts  <cit> . these studies suggest that prokaryotic-eukaryotic communication occurs through bacterial qs factors and host hormones. here we provide the first report of a similar phenomenon with respect to the plant pathogen xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae , one of the most important threats of cultivated rice worldwide. our findings favor a scenario wherein sa and aba not only steer rice immune responses, but also cross-communicate with bacterial qs systems to regulate virulence traits in xoo. moreover, our results also imply reciprocal crosstalk with xoo qs signals modulating rice sa and aba signaling pathways. we propose that the dynamic nature and balance of such bidirectional interkingdom signaling is an important regulatory factor determining the outcome of plant-bacteria interactions.

sa activates the xoo dsf and df qs systems to coordinately regulate swimming, eps and xanthomonadin synthesis
swimming and eps production are important virulence factors of xoo and both traits are considered to be under control of qs. several lines of evidence indicate that dsf signaling positively regulates eps production, whereas the effect of dsf on swimming of xoo appears to be strain-dependent  <cit> . under our experimental conditions, exogenously administered dsf promoted both swimming and eps production of strain xkk <dig>  confirming the importance of dsf signaling in these processes . consistent with previous reports in p. aeruginosa and e. coli  <cit> , nasa inhibited bacterial swimming, yet strongly promoted eps synthesis and up-regulated various genes located both upstream  and downstream  in the dsf signaling pathway . intriguingly, we also found nasa to significantly increase dsf production in liquid cultures , providing a mechanism for how nasa may activate the entire dsf signaling circuit and increase eps synthesis by stimulating dsf biosynthesis.

nasa-induced dsf synthesis may seem contradictory in light of the positive role of dsf in swimming of xkk <dig> and the ability of nasa to repress the latter process. however, regulation of flagellar motility in xanthomonads is a complex multi-step process involving over  <dig> genes that are regulated in a hierarchical manner  <cit> . kunin et al.  <cit>  previously demonstrated the ability of sa to block flagella biosynthesis in e. coli. therefore, it is not inconceivable that nasa transiently activates dsf signaling, but negatively affects swimming of xkk <dig> by an as yet unknown mechanism, which could involve repression of individual flagella-associated genes and/or post-transcriptional modifications. in addition, it should be noted that the conditions of growth for swimming and gene expression studies are quite different, so that simple extrapolations may not be appropriate.

in addition to setting off dsf qs signaling, our data also point towards a role of nasa in activating the df qs system. genetic analysis revealed that df , which is synthesized by the key metabolic enzyme xanb <dig>  catalyzes the production of xanthomonadin pigments  <cit> . interestingly, xanthomonadin is synthesized from shikimate and chorismate, both of which are also important precursors for sa biosynthesis in plants  <cit> . although the structure of sa  is very similar to that of df , sa failed to complement the xcc xanb <dig> knockout mutant  <cit> . however, we found that nasa enhances xanb <dig> gene expression and, accordingly, triggers enhanced levels of df and xanthomonadin . notably, df is reported to be responsible for eps production as well  <cit> , suggesting that the induction of eps by nasa may derive at least in part from its positive effect on df synthesis. nasa also promoted the production of 4-hba , the second product of xanb <dig>  <cit> . unlike df, 4-hba is responsible for the biosynthesis of coq, which functions as a key cofactor in the aerobic respiratory electron transfer for energy generation and protects bacteria from peroxidative damage  <cit> . given the importance of df and 4-hba in bacterial virulence  <cit>  and the well-described role of eps and xanthomonadin in protecting bacteria from host-imposed stresses  <cit> , one interesting extrapolation is that sa not only serves as a plant resistance-inducing signal, but also ended up being exploited by xoo as a qs agonist. moreover, in view of the idea that bacteria possess intensity ‘switches’ that ensure timely expression of energy-intensive molecular and biochemical processes  <cit> , it is tempting to speculate that xoo uses sa to ‘sense’ that is within the host vascular system and activate genes essential for plant colonization.

the luxr-type solo oryr coordinates crosstalk between plant sa/aba and xoo qs circuits
belonging to a sub-family of luxr proteins that have the same modular structure of qs luxrs but are devoid of a cognate luxi ahl synthase, the so-called luxr ‘solo’ oryr controls the expression of more than  <dig> bacterial genes and is important for the complete virulence of xoo  <cit> . luxr solos regulate target genes by either sensing endogenous qs factors or by ‘eavesdropping’ on exogenous factors produced by neighboring bacteria  <cit> . however, some solos can also respond to low-molecular weight compounds produced by plants  <cit> . biochemical studies have shown that oryr does not respond to a wide variety of ahl-type qs factors, but is solubilized in the presence of media supplemented with macerated rice leaves  <cit> . this indicates that oryr most probably binds a plant-produced compound, the identity of which remains unclear. intriguingly, our data suggest that oryr is involved in the perception and/or transduction of plant hormone signals with nasa activating both gene expression and promoter activity of oryr . moreover, experiments with oryr- knockout strains revealed that oryr is indispensable for nasa-induced eps synthesis and aba-promoted swimming. however, nasa does not solubilize oryr, suggesting that nasa most probably does not bind oryr . therefore, rather than acting as a bacterial hormone receptor per se, oryr likely functions by integrating, processing and transmitting plant and bacterial signal molecules, thus acting as a major hub for signal integration and pathway crosstalk. nonetheless, it should be noted that oryr is not solely determinant for bacterial hormone responses as nasa reduced swimming to similar extents in wt and oryr- mutant bacteria . moreover, unlike sa, aba treatment had no significant impact on gene expression and promoter activity of oryr , suggesting that aba regulates swimming of xkk <dig> downstream of oryr. gene expression experiments failed to show a substantial effect of aba on any of the oryr-dependent flagellar and chemotaxis genes we tested . since there are  <dig> motility-related genes that are positively regulated by oryr, it cannot be ruled out that aba affects one or more genes that we did not check. furthermore, aba-mediated regulation of swimming may also occur at the post-transcriptional level. deciphering the exact mechanism by which aba regulates oryr-dependent swimming is a key challenge for future research.

xoo qs signals  modulate rice sa and aba signaling pathways
in addition to plants producing ahl mimics that are able to act as agonists or antagonists to bacterial ahl qs systems, accumulating evidence indicates that bacterial qs factors modulate plant-microbe interactions by tapping into various plant signaling circuits  <cit> . in one of the first examples, it was reported that treatment of medicago truncatula with ahls drives transcriptional reprogramming of extensive gene sets involved in host defense responses, primary metabolism, transcriptional regulation, protein processing, cytoskeletal activity, and plant hormone responses  <cit> . similarly, ahl-treated arabidopsis displayed altered expression of selected hormone-responsive genes as well as significant changes in the plant’s hormone balance, in particular an increased auxin/cytokinin ratio  <cit> . in common with these findings, our data revealed that low and high concentrations of df but not dsf transiently suppress sa-responsive gene expression in detached rice leaves. considering the similarity in chemical structure of df  and sa , one may envision that xoo-secreted df not only facilitates bacterial cell-to-cell communication, but also disturbs in planta sa homeostasis and hence disrupts host immune responses by acting as an sa mimic. with respect to the aba pathway, df showed ambivalent effects with both positive and negative outcomes being found depending on the gene tested . high concentrations of dsf, on the other hand, weakly but significantly suppressed aba signaling. although these results are consistent with a recent study showing that xcc overcomes aba-mediated stomatal immunity in arabidopsis through a dsf-regulated virulence factor  <cit> , they also seem to be at odds with the previously reported role of aba in promoting blb disease development  <cit> . however, given the tremendous increase in aba-responsive gene expression in xoo-infected rice leaves  and the rather weak effect of dsf on aba signaling , one may question the biological significance of negative dsf-aba interactions in determining the outcome of rice-xoo interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
collectively, our data suggest a potential cross-communication between the df and dsf xoo qs circuits and the rice sa and aba signaling pathways. in figure  <dig>  we propose a spatiotemporal model illustrating the role and interplay of plant hormones and bacterial qs factors in regulating rice-xoo interactions. we speculate that upon leaf entry, xoo is faced with high levels of sa in the xylem, which restricts its growth and motility and is deployed by rice as an efficient defense mechanism. xoo, however, appears to perceive sa as a qs agonist with resultant activation of the dsf and df qs systems, a process that at least partially depends on the luxr solo protein oryr. sa-induced df and dsf signaling in turn triggers production of eps, xanthomonadin and coq, which collectively contribute to bacterial virulence. at this stage, xoo are sessile and according to recent reports in the literature most likely growing within a biofilm  <cit> . via a yet-to-be-defined mechanism, successful xoo bacteria may then trick the plant into synthesizing aba, which together with sa-induced df contributes to suppression of sa signaling. as bacterial communities grow in size, cells that reside in the innermost layers of the biofilm may not have access to nutrients or may suffer from accumulation of toxic waste products. in either of these cases, or when environmental nutrients become limited, bacteria are likely to respond by returning to their planktonic mode of existence. with the aid of aba and oryr and free from sa suppression, bacteria that are released from the biofilm swim to a further site, where they are again confronted with high sa levels. by repeating this process over and over again, xoo bacteria may gradually spread along the rice xylem vessels, causing typical leaf blight symptoms as they progress. although the specific mechanisms involved in various steps of the model remain to be elucidated, our data draw important inferences suggesting that xoo responds to both a bacterial qs signaling system and a rice hormone signaling circuit to fine-tune virulence gene expression at different stages of infection. moreover, besides reinforcing the earlier contention that qs is a bidirectional process influenced by both plant and microbial signals  <cit> , our findings highlight the importance of plant hormones in modulating bacterial virulence and uncover interkingdom signaling as an important regulatory aspect of plant-bacteria interactions.figure  <dig>
