BACKGROUND
pear, a member of the subfamily pomaceae in the rosaceae, is a temperate fruit crop of major economic importance in the world market. as global economic markets develop, the current breeding objects are moving from the traditional focus on fruit yield to fruit quality, especially flavor. such flavor is a genetically and biochemically highly complex trait, which involves the interaction of sugars, acids and aroma. aroma, as a very important component of flavor is receiving more and more attention. the aroma of the fruit is a complex mixture of more than  <dig> volatile compounds, including esters, aldehydes, terpenes, alcohols, carbonyl compounds, and some sulfur compounds  <cit> , and the type and relative proportion of each aroma component determine the specific aroma of different fruit. although intensive research has been conducted on the physiological and biochemical analysis of fruit aroma, the molecular genetic basis and inheritance of aroma patterns are still unknown.

however, biosynthetic pathways leading to the formation of plant flavor volatiles such as esters, alcohols and aldehydes have been thoroughly investigated  <cit> . as judged by either quality or quantity, the main fruit volatiles are substantially derived from saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. straight-chain alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, acids, esters and lactones are primarily formed by the fatty acid oxidation pathway by lipoxygenase, via α and β- oxidation. the lipoxygenase pathway of fatty acids involves at least four enzymes, namely lipoxygenase , hydroperoxide lyase , alcohol dehydrogenase  and alcohol acetyl transferase .

loxs are lipid-oxidizing enzymes, a type of non-haem iron-containing dioxygenase, which is ubiquitous in the animal and plant kingdoms  <cit> ; they are even found in fungi  <cit>  and bacteria  <cit> . lox is a common plant lipoxygenase that oxidizes linoleate and alpha- linolenate, the two most common polyunsaturated fatty acids found in plants. the patterns of lox gene expression vary according to the tissue and stage of development .

according to enzyme classification, lox is defined as a linoleic: oxygen oxidoreductase, which catalyzes  - <dig> -pentadiene structural units of unsaturated fatty acids plus oxygen to produce unsaturated fatty acid peroxides  <cit> . it is a multifunctional enzyme, involved in at least three different types of catalytic reaction: 1) oxidation of the lipid double plus ; 2) a secondary lipid peroxide conversion   <cit> ; 3) formation of epoxy leukotrienes   <cit> .

it is known that in complex eukaryotes loxs are generally encoded by a multigene family  <cit> . with the rapid development in sequencing and functional genomics research, lox genes are being identified, cloned and studied in more and more plant species.

for example, six lipoxygenases were reported in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana <cit> . studies on cucumber revealed that expression of  <dig> out of the  <dig> lox genes can be detected using rt-pcr. twelve genes were differentially expressed in response to abiotic stresses and plant growth regulator treatments  <cit> . analysis of the grape  genome revealed that a lox family consisting of  <dig> individual members  <cit> . a shared polyploidy relationship between glycine max and medicago truncatula was revealed by analysis of this gene family  <cit> . there are three different types of lox in soybean lox <dig>  lox <dig>  and lox <dig>  while the lox <dig> isozyme is primarily responsible for the “beany” flavor of most soybean seeds. a single nucleotide-amplified polymorphism  marker was found to identify the lack of the lox <dig> isozyme, and can be used to assist the breeding and selection in this species  <cit> . a total of  <dig> lox genes were identified in apple by mining the whole assembled apple genome  <cit> .

with the intention to extend the knowledge of the formation of aroma-related volatiles and to understand the structure and evolutionary history of the lox gene family, we investigated this gene family in pear  and compared pear loxs with those of another four fully sequenced rosaceae species . structure analysis, synteny analysis, phylogenetic analysis and positive selection analysis were conducted on lox homologous genes and the effects on function are discussed. using the pear genome information, we also utilised the transcriptome dataset of pear fruit to verify our results.

RESULTS
sequence identification and collection
using the domain of “lipoxygenase” from pfam , we searched for the lox homologous genes in five fully sequenced genome of rosaceae species, namely peach   <cit> , apple   <cit> , woodland strawberry   <cit> , mei   <cit>  and pear   <cit>  . by employing the “multiple segment viterbi”  algorithm; implemented in hmmer <dig> software package,  <dig> sequences were identified. after filtering the length of the homologous genes,  <dig> genes were removed for shortness and two sequences were removed for not having the complete domain of lox as tested by smart . finally,  <dig> genes were identified as lox homologous genes . <dig> lox genes were identified in pear with  <dig> in apple,  <dig> in mei,  <dig> in peach and  <dig> in strawberry. the chromosome number of apple and pear is  <dig> compared with  <dig> in peach and mei, and  <dig> in strawberry. the number of lox genes in pear and apple are almost double the number of in peach and mei. pear and apple are the most important economic crops in the rosacease and belong to the maloideae while mei and peach belong to the prunoideae, which does not show the expansion of lox gene family. the species tree of the five rosaceae species shows the whole genome duplication in the progenitor of pear and apple .table  <dig>

in this study we investigated the genome of five rosaceae species; pear, apple, peach, mei and woodland strawberry. njau, nanjing agricultural university ; gdr, genome database for rosaceae ; jgi, joint genome institude ; bfu, beijing forestry university .
species tree of five rosaceae species. star indicates the occurrence of wgd; numbers in the figures indicate species divergence time. unit:mya . the data were downloaded from ncbi  common tree in taxonomy section and the tree was constructed by mega <dig> 



the pear lox gene family has  <dig> members, which are distributed unevenly in the genome. chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> each have  <dig> lox gene while chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> have  <dig> lox genes and  <dig> on scaffold. most notable is the presence of  <dig> lox genes on chromosome  <dig>  we can therefore infer that chromosome  <dig> has gone through a segmental duplication and the lox gene family is in that segment.

we also noticed that pbr <dig>  , and pbr <dig>   encode proteins of the same length , with the same pi  and . after further analysis, we found out that these two sequences are identical. pbr <dig>   and pbr <dig>   on chromosome  <dig>  pbr <dig>   and pbr <dig>   on scaffold <dig> , and pbr <dig>   and pbr <dig>   on chromsome <dig> are also identical.

we included all the  <dig> lox genes described in the analysis of the lox gene family in apple  <cit> , with the exception of mdp <dig>  which did not have the complete domain structure.

phylogenetic analyses
in order to investigate phylogenetic relationships and the molecular evolutionary history of the sequences in these five rosaceae species , a phylogenetic analysis was conducted and a phylogenetic tree was generated using the neighbor joining  method ; the maximum-likelihood  method was also performed in mega <dig>  the tree remained consistent using these two methods. a bootstrap test was set as  <dig> to test the confidence of the tree. the nj tree showed that these  <dig> sequences clustered into  <dig> main groups and the ml tree confirmed this result.figure  <dig> 
phylogenetic tree of lox homologous genes in five rosaceae species. chr- denotes chromosome and s-denotes scaffold. the phylogenetic tree of  <dig> genes is shown in this figure. the phylogenetic tree was generated using the neighbor joining  method in mega <dig>  a bootstrap test was set as  <dig> to test the confidence of the tree. the bootstrap values of confidence level, as percentages, are given at branch nodes.



we can determine from this phylogeny that the lox genes were present prior to the evolution of these five species, since all the branches have lox genes from different species rather than each branch having only the genes from a single species. all the lox genes fall into two major clades: type <dig> and type <dig>  the first group corresponds to type <dig> lox, and the groups  <dig> and  <dig> corresponds to type <dig> lox. we named the pear lox genes according to the published studies on apple  <cit> . the genes were divided into  <dig> subfamilies while lox <dig> is not included in our research since this gene is not really a lox gene, a conclusion supported by vogt . however, we identified an additional cluster of lox genes and named it lox <dig> 

structure and biochemical features of lox genes
the structure of the lox gene sequence comprises two domains, the “lipoxygenase” domain pf <dig> in pfam , and domain pf <dig> which is named plat  or lh <dig> . we identified  <dig> lox genes that all the functional domain, pf <dig>  however,  <dig> out of  <dig> did not have the plat/lh <dig> domain which is found in a variety of membrane or lipid associated proteins . all the lox homologous genes in pear have both domains.

in order to examine the motif structure in pear we constructed a six motif figure by submitting the genomic data and the coding sequence data of lox genes of pear to the piece and meme website . all the lox genes have all the six motifs, except pbr <dig>  which is missing one motif at the beginning of the sequence . the meme results  also confirmed the results. the protein encoded by pbr <dig>  has  <dig> aas which is the shortest one. however, pbr <dig>  is expressed at all the six stages  in our transcriptome research, so is a functional gene.figure  <dig>

collinearity analyses
we found  <dig> paired collinearity relationships from these  <dig> sequences, of which  <dig> pairs are collinear between pear and other species . all the collinearity relationships are formed by wgd or segmental duplication according to the result of mcscan. this corresponds to the chromosome collinearity between pear and apple.table  <dig>

expression of lox genes in pear
we sequenced rna from mixed pear fruit samples to obtain transcriptome data from six stages of fruit development , 36daf, 80daf, 110daf, 145daf, 167daf) . of the  <dig> lox homologous genes identified in pear,  <dig> were found to be expressed in the fruit, while the pbr <dig> , pbr <dig> , pbr <dig> , pbr <dig>  and pbr <dig>  are not expressed;  <dig> of the  <dig> were found to be expressed in all the six stages. the average expression rpkm  value of all the pear genes is  <dig>  while the average rpkm value of the lox gene family is  <dig>  which is double the average value. therefore, most lox genes are functionally active.we also examined the expression level figure of these genes . the results showed that the expression of lox genes in pear was usually low expression in the early development stage , increased to a peak at the middle development stage , reduced to near zero near ripening  and then increased slightly at ripening . this is believed to correspond to the pattern of changes in the volatile components of pear fruit aroma.figure  <dig>

discussion
the lox gene family is involved in the development of various plant organs, in the fruit ripening process also in the response to abiotic stresses, and is also involved in the synthesis of aldehydes and alcohols. most importantly, it plays a key role at the early stage in the synthetic pathway for fruit aroma compounds and therefore the development of fruit flavor.

by using the msv algorithm in hmmer <dig>  we searched the whole genome sequences of five rosaceae species; a total of  <dig> lox homologous genes were identified. the lox gene family exists before the evolutionary distinction of these five species. phylogenetic analysis, structure analysis, collinearity analysis, and transcriptome expression analysis were conducted on all the  <dig> lox genes. in summary, this study provides a characterization of lox gene family in pear and the evolutionary history of lox in rosaceae.

 <dig> lox genes were identified in apple and  <dig> genes in pear,  <dig> in mei,  <dig> in peach and  <dig> in woodland strawberry. the number of lox genes in pear and apple was almost double the number in mei, peach and strawberry. in pear we identified  <dig> lox genes, which is a comparatively large gene family. the lox gene family has gone through an expansion which corresponds to the variation in chromosome number. for example, the chromosome number of apple and pear is  <dig> compared to  <dig> in peach and mei, and  <dig> in strawberry. considering a recent wgd  event was shared by apple and pear at 30-45mya    <cit> , lox gene family expansion in apple and pear is believed to have occurred at that time.

from the observation of the phylogenetic tree , the lox genes of pear from the same chromosome  cluster together, which indicates the similarity of the genes on the same chromosome. also the duplicated copies on chromosome  <dig> , chromosome  <dig>  and scaffold <dig>   of the pear genome are paralogous genes. the two pairs of lox genes located on chromosome  <dig>  have the same sequence and their order on the chromosome is the same. all these  <dig> pairs of genes are distributed on the same chromosome or scaffold and from comparison of their position on the chromosome it can be concluded that tandem duplication or segmental duplication has happened in this area of chromosome. pear lox genes showed an obvious trend of expansion with duplication as the most common occurrence. it can be concluded that a tandem duplication or segmental duplication has happened in the pear genome. however, the specific type of duplication is still unknown.

in addition, transcriptome data showed that  <dig> of the lox genes in pear were expressed. this confirms that these genes are functionally active, with  <dig> of them being expressed in all six stages of fruit development. though one motif was missing, gene pbr <dig>  is still expressed in our study at all the six stages; this suggests that the loss of this n-terminal domain does not affect its function. the change in expression level shown in figure  <dig> is believed to correspond to the change in aroma volatile components in the fruit. the aroma is very low at the early stage of fruit development and then increases significantly during the middle stage of development. then subsequently the aroma substances are converted to volatile components. fruit immediately prior to and during ripening and ripening time have a low level of lox expression but because of the accumulation of precursors at these development stages the fruit keep emitting an aroma.

collinearity analyses showed that  <dig> blocks and  <dig> gene pairs have a collinear relationship between pear and apple. also the chromosomes in pear are collinear to each other, a conclusion confirmed by the pear genome sequencing project, which demonstrated strong collinearity between segments of several chromosomes. in addition, we discovered that a segment in chromosome  <dig> of the pear genome is believed to be collinear with chromosome  <dig> in the peach genome. the lox gene family members pbr <dig>  and pbr <dig>  on chromosome  <dig> of pear are collinear with ppa001311m on chromosome  <dig> of peach; and pbr <dig>  and pbr <dig>  on chromosome  <dig> of pear are collinear with ppa001216m on chromosome  <dig> of peach. all these data indicated the collinear relationship of these two chromosomes.

the present analysis included all the lox genes previously described in apple  <cit> ; and only one was not analysed because it lacked the complete domain structure. we obtained identical phylogenetic results as those in the previous analysis in apple. furthermore, we also identified a new cluster of lox genes which were not described in the previous study.

currently, research studies on fruit volatile substances are focused on the analytical determination of volatile aromatic substances and on how the various cultivation practices and storage conditions affect the aroma of the fruit. most of this research is focused on the european pear , with few reports on the asiatic pear. there is still little knowledge of the molecular mechanism of the volatile aromatic substances. however in this paper we used the material of the asiatic pear genome of pyrus bretschneideri which is the first pear genome to be sequenced.

we aimed to study the variation in gene sequence structure and to analyse the phylogenic evolutionary relationship of the lox gene family in the rosaceae. this information can be used to guide future research on the evolutionary history on loxs and associated transgenic research. this study of lox genes is one part of the whole analysis of aroma of pear fruit. future work will be conducted on the study of the identification of genes of the aroma pathway and the interaction network between these genes.

CONCLUSIONS
 <dig> genes were identified as lox homologous genes from five rosaceae species;  <dig> of these sequences were from pear. specific gene duplication was found on chromosome <dig> in the pear genome. all the lox genes fall into three groups according to phylogenetic analysis. the first group corresponds to type <dig> lox, and the groups  <dig> and  <dig> corresponds to type <dig> lox. of the  <dig> lox homologous genes identified in pear,  <dig> were found to be expressed in the fruit. the express pattern in six stages was found to correspond to the pattern of changes in the volatile components of pear fruit aroma. the research on the lox gene family could lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of aroma in fruit. moreover, the findings of this study may facilitate the research on evolutionary history and transgenic research on lox genes and other aroma genes.
