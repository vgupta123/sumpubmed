BACKGROUND
haemotrophic mycoplasma infections are found in a wide range of domestic and wild animals causing acute haemolytic anaemia or chronic anaemia with immune suppression  <cit> . generally, they show distinct host specificity. however, there are reports of humans infected with haemotrophic mycoplasmas, i.e. mycoplasma haemofelis and mycoplasma suis  <cit> . m. suis causes infectious anaemia in pigs   <cit> .

two forms of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia  have been described: warm aiha, which is characterised by autoreactive igg antibodies binding their target epitope at body temperature  <cit> , and cold aiha. in cold aiha, complement-activating autoreactive igm antibodies bind their antigen, usually the l/i epitope on red blood cells, below body temperature and are strongly agglutinating at 4°c  <cit> . both types of antibodies occur in 7% of human aiha cases; this is referred to as mixed aiha. sokol and co-workers report only one case of secondary mixed aiha due to mycoplasma infection, i.e. m. pneumoniae  <cit> .

mixed aiha has been found in m. suis-induced iap. cold igm agglutinins targeting glycoproteins on the red blood cells were observed  <cit> . these cold agglutinins occur about four weeks after experimental infection with m. suis. during the acute stage of iap , acute anaemia, hypoglycaemia and icteroanaemia accompanied by high mortality occur. it is assumed that the severe anaemia observed in pigs suffering from acute clinical signs is due to a combination of direct damage to the red blood cells by m. suis attachment and invasion, and upregulation of cold and warm autoreactive antibodies directed against red blood cell components. in previous studies, these autoreactive warm igg antibodies have been shown to overwhelm the specific immune response to m. suis  <cit> .

in this study, sera from experimentally m. suis-infected pigs were screened for the presence of warm igg antibodies by testing their reactivity with blood preparations from healthy pigs. the detection and characterisation of the host proteins acting as autoantigens was a main issue. earlier studies, i.e. serological proteome analysis  <cit> , yielded some evidence that actin is a target protein for the autoreactive antibodies detected during the acute state of the disease. this was observed in both one- and two-dimensional immunoblots. therefore, the sera tested in this study were additionally screened for reactivity with porcine muscular  and cytoskeletal  actin.

RESULTS
study design and screening of porcine sera for autoreactive antibodies
a collection of sera obtained from experimentally m. suis-infected pigs was available from earlier studies  <cit> . the sera were divided into two groups according to their history. group  <dig>  were derived from pigs  that had been vaccinated with msg <dig> prior to splenectomy and challenge with m. suis. in view of the known major occurrence of autoreactive igg antibodies during clinical attacks  <cit> , the sera used for the present study were drawn at following time points: i,  <dig> days post-immunisation and  <dig> days prior to m. suis infection; ii, during the first clinical attack ; iii,  <dig> days apart; iv, during the second clinical attack . owing to animal deaths, fewer sera were analysed at time points ii , iii  and iv . group  <dig>  originated from  <dig> pigs that had not been immunised prior to splenectomy and m. suis infection. for this study, sera taken prior to infection , during the first clinical attack , between the first and the second clinical attacks  and during the second clinical attack  were considered. in total,  <dig> sera  were screened by elisa for reactivity with igg-depleted antigen preparations from healthy pigs . od values were normalised to the negative control. the cut-off value was determined to be  <dig>  .

reactivity with porcine α-actin
in order to identify the autoantigens, the autoreactive sera  were further tested with igg-depleted erythrocyte lysates  and with porcine α-actin. earlier studies suggested actin as a potential target of warm autoreactive antibodies   <cit> . in  <dig> sera , antibodies reactive with both preparations were detected. linear regression for neg ag with ecl and α-actin revealed r <dig> values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively .

the actin reactivity was shown to be species-specific, i.e. a significantly lower reactivity was observed with rabbit α-actin than with porcine α-actin. the mean od values at λ =  <dig> nm were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for rabbit and porcine α-actin, respectively.

reactivity with porcine β-actin
the erythrocyte contains cytoskeletal actin . this actin form is highly homologous but not identical to muscle actin . since β-actin was not commercially available, the gene was synthetically produced and adapted to e. coli codon usage. the protein was expressed, purified and used for the experiments . sera reactive with α-actin were tested further with β-actin. they were all positive for both actin forms. group  <dig>  the msg1-immunised animals, showed a strikingly stronger reactivity with β-actin than with α-actin . no significant difference was seen in the group  <dig> animal sera .

isotypes of autoreactive antibodies to actin
in warm autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, igg <dig> and igg <dig> antibodies predominate  <cit> . these antibodies are recognised preferentially by macrophages. to gain insight into the autoreactive mechanisms occurring during an m. suis infection, secondary antibodies to porcine igg <dig> and igg <dig> were used to evaluate the subtypes of actin-reactive antibodies in group  <dig>  no secondary antibodies to porcine igg <dig> were available. the igg1/igg <dig> and igg2/igg <dig> ratios were calculated to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively .

search for shared epitopes between msg <dig> and actin
reactivity with actin was observed in msg1-vaccinated immunocompetent animals prior to splenectomy and m. suis infection. to support the hypothesis of molecular mimicry, we evaluated the reactivity of a rabbit serum targeting recombinant msg <dig> with actin and vice versa, i.e. the reactivity of a serum recognising porcine actin with msg <dig>  cross-reactivity was observed . therefore, the protein sequences of porcine actin and msg <dig> were used as input to an epitope finder program. the program allows epitopes potentially presented by sla molecules to b-cells to be identified with high probability. sla-2* <dig> would present the peptide ltlkypieh derived from actin and the peptide rtlkyyisl derived from msg <dig>  both peptides are nine amino acids in length and share a sequence identity of 55%. this peptide is identical in both actin forms.

discussion
in m. suis infections, autoreactive antibodies are of central importance for inducing anaemia  <cit> . recently we showed that warm autoreactive antibodies of the isotype igg are up-regulated during the acute phase of experimentally-induced m. suis infection  <cit> . two-dimensional immunoblot analysis revealed that actin is potentially recognised by these antibodies  <cit> . actin is known to play a role in autoimmune hepatitis type  <dig> , where f-actin-reactive antibodies are characteristic  <cit> . to our knowledge, this is the first report and evidence for autoreactive antibodies directed against actin in warm aiha. in particular, characterising these autoantigenic structures is an essential basis for understanding the pathogenesis of warm aiha, whether associated with m. suis infections or in general. typically, autoreactive antibody production is induced by a misguided up-regulation of naturally-occurring b-cells specific for self-antigens, the occurrence of altered self-antigens, the appearance of previously cryptic antigens, and loss of tolerance to self-antigens due to molecular mimicry.

antibodies recognising cytoskeletal components such as actin, spectrin or band  <dig> are physiological components of tissue homeostasis and b-cell clones specific for actin patrol continually  <cit> . a misregulation due to m. suis infection could lead to excessive thymus-independent proliferation of these b-cell clones  <cit> . other mycoplasma species, e.g. m. pneumoniae, are polyclonal b-cell activators of mouse splenocytes  <cit> . further, zachary and smith have described such misdirected immune responses in m. suis infections  <cit> . interestingly, actin-targeting igg antibodies are up-regulated during the first clinical attack when m. suis is present in large numbers. this provides evidence for the hypothesis of a direct mitogenic stimulus derived from m. suis leading to non-specific b-cell stimulation.

a further explanation for the development of autoreactive antibodies is that damage to red blood cells makes hidden cytoskeletal proteins accessible to circulating antibodies, whereupon they are interpreted as non-self and elicit an immune response. it has been hypothesised that autoimmune epitopes on red blood cells may be result from contact with proteolytic enzymes  <cit> . electron microscopic studies have revealed a close association between m. suis cells and erythrocytes and striking membrane deformations on the host cells  <cit> . considering loads of up to  <dig> m. suis cells per erythrocyte, it is quite evident that the cytoskeleton is modified by attachment and invasion.

the last explanation for the induction of autoreactive antibodies directed against host actin in m. suis infections is molecular mimicry. in this process, a peptide derived from a pathogen and presented by mhc ii must be capable of activating a self-reactive helper t cell and, therefore, stimulating specific antibody-producing b-cells.

remarkably, in sera obtained from pigs immunised with msg <dig>  autoantibodies against actin were already detectable after immunisation but prior to splenectomy and challenge with m. suis. these findings strongly support the hypothesis that msg <dig> is involved in inducing autoimmunity by molecular mimicry. evidence for cross-reactivity between msg <dig> and actin was found by western blotting using hyperimmune rabbit sera. to test whether actin and m. suis actually share potentially cross-reactive epitopes, the netmhcpan algorithm was used and gave a positive result  <cit> . porcine sla-2* <dig>  would strongly bind and therefore present the deduced peptides ltlkypieh  and rtlkyyisl  to the same circulating t-cells. the identity between these peptides was calculated to be 55%, which is enough for cross-reactivity. degeneracy in both the tcr and mhc peptide-binding motifs reduces the sequence-specific requirement to only a few crucial residues  <cit> . it remains to be elucidated by systematic in vitro stimulation assays whether these peptides actually play a role in the pathogenesis of aiha due to m. suis infection.

in rbcs and many other cell types β-actin is part of the cytoskeleton; α-actin predominates only in muscle cells. if the strongly β-actin-binding antibodies identified encounter their target ubiquitously, rbcs would not be the only cells affected. there is evidence that lymphocytes and epithelial cells are harmed during m. suis infection . cytoskeletal proteins in cells with intact plasma membranes are cryptic for antibodies. however, if the cell is injured by interaction with m. suis, β-actin would become accessible. antibodies recognising this actin opsonise the red blood cells which leads to their removal from the circulatory system and therefore to anaemia. notably, clinical signs expected by autoreactive processes targeting muscle actin  were observed.

in autoimmune diseases including aiha, misdirected igg <dig> and igg <dig> antibodies play an important role because they bind efficiently to fcreceptoriii  molecules on macrophages  <cit> . interestingly, the antibodies that predominantly recognised actin were of the subtype igg2rather than igg <dig>  however, a definitive subtype assignment was not feasible owing to high standard deviations. immune complexes with the igg <dig> subtype activate the alternative complement cascade pathway and are important in defence against encapsulated bacteria  <cit> . however, the consequences of autoreactive igg <dig> up-regulation during m. suis infection remain unclear. unfortunately, no statement about the presence of igg <dig> antibodies and their role in m. suis infection can be given since secondary antibodies for this porcine subtype were not available.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, we record that autoreactive igg antibodies up-regulated during infectious porcine anaemia induced by m. suis recognise actin. these autoreactive antibodies are obviously involved in the pathogenesis of the severe anaemia observed during the infection. an interplay of several mechanisms is assumed, i.e. a blastogenic response due to unspecific lymphocyte proliferation, direct damage to red blood cells and molecular mimicry. to our knowledge, this is the first report of autoreactive actin antibodies in relation to aiha. in our opinion, the experimentally m. suis-infected splenectomised pig represents a useful model for investigating aiha because of the controllable inducible symptoms.
