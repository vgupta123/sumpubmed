BACKGROUND
the study of avian phylogeny abounds with examples of both unstable taxonomy and apparent convergent evolution. indeed, in many cases the incidence of these conditions is correlated because taxonomists are at times misled by convergence in their systematic inferences. progress with resolving avian phylogeny and thus identification of morphological/behavioral convergence has been enhanced by the use of molecular data that provides a source of characters independent of morphology. in particular, the use of large scale dna, and in particular mitochondrial, sequence data has proved beneficial in stabilizing the avian tree  <cit> .

in contrast, a very different perspective on the phylogeny of birds suggesting a very different biogeographic history and classification was recently inferred from analysis of a single nuclear locus. fain and houde  <cit>  proposed a major new division of neoaves . their division of neoaves into metaves and coronaves was based on data from the seventh intron of the β-fibrinogen gene , including insertions and deletions. the proposed new group of metaves comprises an intriguing and eclectic set of taxa, including the swifts, hummingbirds, flamingos, tropicbirds, grebes and kagu. fain and houde  <cit>  liken the division of neoaves into two major clades to the well known convergence of marsupial and placental mammals and list eleven examples of ecological and/or morphological convergence among metaves and coronaves. their examples of convergence are in most cases, widely accepted and include for example the convergence of form and feeding of swallows and swifts as aerial insectivores. however, in contrast to the placental/marsupial division that is supported by at least  <dig> anatomical and physiological synapomorphies  <cit>  the metaves clade does not have a single published morphological character to support it, and there is no clear geographic separation from coronaves.

although the proposed metaves/coronaves division is supported by analysis of fgb-int <dig>  there has, as yet been no similar pattern obtained from other genes. for example, ericson et al.  <cit>  confirm that although they also found the metaves/coronaves split with the fgb-int <dig> data, it was not evident in analyses of four other nuclear loci . curiously though, when the four nuclear loci were concatenated with fgb-int <dig> for phylogenetic analysis, this increased the support for the metaves/coronaves split compared with fgb-int <dig> by itself  <cit> . in a cladistic analysis of morphological data livezey and zusi  <cit>  did not find support for metaves and declared it to be a 'nomen nudum' . thus, there is just a single nuclear locus giving a signal for metaves, and it is therefore essential to test the proposed division using other classes of data. we examine here support for the metaves/coronaves split using data from complete mitochondrial  genomes.

the avian tree from complete mitochondrial genome dna sequence is expanding steadily  <cit>  and is in agreement with morphological and nuclear dna data in rooting birds between paleognaths and neognaths  <cit> . mitochondrial introgression does not misled phylogenetic inferences at the depth of the divergence of the avian radiation and the range of mutation rates among mitochondrial genes make this an excellent single loci to study. however, previous mitochondrial datasets could not test the metaves/coronaves hypothesis. for example, gibb et al.  <cit>  and slack et al.  <cit>  did not include any members of the metaves, and watanabe et al.  <cit>  and yamamoto et al.  report one each; great crested grebe and tropicbird respectively. fortunately, we now have the complete sequence of the mitochondrial genome from seven bird species classified as metaves by fain and houde  <cit> . the five reported here are the ruby-throated hummingbird , the common swift , australian little grebe , kagu  and flamingo . to these five we add two metaves mt genomes from genbank; great crested grebe  and tropicbird , reported by watanabe et al.  <cit>  and yamamoto et al.  respectively. in addition, we report a new zealand rail  because it allows us to distinguish between the traditional view of kagu and rails as being members of the same order  and the novel view of kagu in metaves and rails in coronaves  <cit> .

in the process of testing the metaves/coronaves division, the mitochondrial genomes of the new taxa reported allow us to appraise other hypotheses about the phylogeny of modern birds. irrespective of the validity of the metaves/coronaves division, we expect the hummingbird and swift to be sister taxa in this dataset . the position of the gruiformes  is more equivocal; livezey and zusi  <cit>  placed the rails very deep in the neoavian tree and sister to the shorebirds  but cracraft  <cit>  infered the rails  as much more recently derived than the earliest neoaves, within a large group comprising the raptors, shore, sea and aquatic birds.

of the more controversial examples of avian ecological convergence proposed we can now test with analysis of complete mitochondrial genomes whether grebes and loons have converged on their form as "foot-propelled divers with high wing loading"  <cit> . several authors have suggested that loons, flamingos, and grebes belong in the same part of the avian tree  <cit>  and this grouping can also be tested. a consensus on the placement of flamingos has not been achieved  <cit>  although many now consider the flamingos to be close relatives of grebes  <cit> . the name mirandornithes was coined by sangster  <cit>  for the flamingo/grebe clade and this relationship is supported by a shared derived louse fauna  <cit> . however, recent analysis of morphological data found grebes and loons to be sister taxa, with neither being closely related to flamingo  <cit> . the sister group to the putative flamingo/grebe clade remains unresolved; morphology indicates flamingos are sister to the shorebirds  or have a highly aquatic ancestor  <cit> , whilst dna-dna hybridization indicates tropicbirds are closest  <cit> . within the metaves, fain and houde  <cit>  placed grebes closer to kagu and hummingbird/swift than to flamingo, although resolution within metaves is generally poor.

the relative positions of the tropicbird and frigatebird are also uncertain. traditionally they have been considered as part of the pelecaniformes  but this is now in question  <cit> . tropicbirds may be in the metaves clade  <cit> , or basal to the vultures and penguins  <cit>  and pelicans might be closer to the shoebill and hamerkop than to booby, darter and cormorant  <cit> . putative pelecaniformes are represented in our data set by the pelican, tropicbird and frigatebird.

seventh intron of β-fibrinogen
to return to the data supporting the metaves/coronaves clades, one source of ambiguity or false signal with fgb-int <dig> is the nucleotide sequence alignment. the fgb-int <dig> dataset on  <dig> bird species before alignment consists of dna sequences that vary in length from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp but, when aligned, the dataset stretches to  <dig> nucleotide sites. furthermore, no single site is conserved across all taxa and indels are so frequent in this intron that every site is coded as a gap in at least one bird. without conserved sites, alignment of the dna sequences is problematical at best, and could lead to false phylogenetic signal  <cit> . erroneous alignment can result in apparent phylogenetic signal among non-homologous sites  and thus mislead tree reconstruction  <cit> .

the conservative approach to alignment that we use with mitochondrial protein sequence is to remove all gaps and flanking sites on either side of the gap back to a constant site. if this alignment approach was applied to the fgb-int <dig> dataset of  <dig> birds there would be no sites left in the alignment! on the other hand, if an alignment could be confirmed, then the presence/absence of major features  could be informative as 'rare genomic changes'  <cit> . a good example is the case of retroposed elements identified in placental evolution by kriegs et al.  <cit> . in general, we know that when there are a very large number of character states, parsimony is a maximum likelihood estimator  <cit> . thus gaps in dna sequences, if they are uniquely definable, are expected to be excellent characters for phylogeny and have, for example, been useful in resolving parrot evolution  <cit> . the major question with the fgb-int <dig> data therefore remains whether the sequences can be reliably aligned.

another potential difficulty with the metaves/coronaves result which is based on a single nuclear locus, is that many nuclear genes exist as multiple  copies  <cit> . it is possible that, by chance, one paralogue was amplified and sequenced in some species  and an alternative copy in other species, thus resulting in two clades.

we use four approaches to help evaluate the fgb-int <dig> sequences for phylogenetic reliability. we located the parsimony sites that unite metaves. we examined the sensitivity of the final alignment to the reference tree that guides the dna sequence alignment in programs such as clustal x, to detect whether an alternative tree would give an equally good alternative alignment. we then reversed the direction of the sequences for alignment which is a proven method for detecting cases where alignment is relatively arbitrary  <cit> . finally, we tested whether there was any evidence of paralogous copies by amplifying, cloning and sequencing fgb-int <dig> from two bird species.

RESULTS
complete mitochondrial genomes
the six new mitochondrial genome sequences have been deposited in genbank under the following accession numbers: ruby-throated hummingbird , common swift , australian little grebe , kagu ) and greater flamingo ; a new zealand rail . the standard avian gene order was found in five of these birds, the exception being the flamingo which has the remnant of a second control region as seen in the falcon . control region sequence was not used in the analysis.

phylogenetics
we have previously found with both birds  <cit>  and mammals  <cit> , as well as with simulated data  <cit> , that the addition of an outgroup can disrupt a well-established ingroup tree, typically due to long-branch attraction. the ingroup tree without outgroups is more likely to be correct as shown with simulated data  <cit> . therefore, as 'best practice', we ran analyses using data representing the neoaves ingroup only  and then included the galloanserae outgroup  <cit>  for comparison . the main conclusion is that neither unconstrained tree has the seven metaves taxa together. the metaves question will be discussed first, then the other aspects of the tree later.

we then constrained the seven metaves taxa  to form a clade . in order to have the same model, the optimal parameters from modeltest were estimated on both trees. both the unconstrained mrbayes and ml trees are highly significantly better than the constrained metaves tree. the likelihood values for the ml trees are - <dig>  and - <dig>  respectively . considering that the sh test is regarded as a conservative test  <cit> , the mitochondrial data strongly reject the metaves/coronaves subdivision. this leads us to ask why the seventh intron of the β-fibrinogen gene gives support for the metaves/coronaves division.

seventh intron of the β-fibrinogen gene
thus far, the seventh intron of the β-fibrinogen gene  is the only locus giving direct support for the metaves/coronaves subdivision. alternative hypotheses were tested regarding the alignment and the number of copies of this intron. we reduced the number of taxa to analyse the fgb-int <dig> sequences , and resolved the metaves clade using ml and maximum parsimony  although monophyly of coronaves and metaves had only 54% and 85% bootstrap support, respectively . from a total of  <dig> sites  there are  <dig> parsimony sites for metaves. seventeen of these parsimony sites occur in the first  <dig> positions of the alignment, although there is no obvious clustering . trees reconstructed following alternative alignments using the addition of simulated data from the mtdna tree still recovered metaves as a group. this was also the case when the sequences were reversed and realigned  <cit> .

no paralogous of fgb-int <dig> were found from the  <dig> clones that were sequenced from one metaves , and one coronaves . occasionally single nucleotide differences were found between clones from the same bird, but certainly no changes that would indicate duplicate copies that may have diverged 60– <dig> mya  <cit> . thus no evidence of paralogs was found, and so this does not appear to be a likely explanation for the metaves grouping.

avian evolution
an unexpected feature of our analysis of the whole mitochondrial dna sequences  was that the mrbayes topology  when enforced in paup* provided a tree with a lower likelihood score than the best ml tree found using heuristic search ). these two trees are similar; differing in their placement of the flamingo/grebe clade as sister to the shorebirds . the heuristic search ml tree put the flamingo/grebe clade between the falcon clade and the rest of the water-carnivores, while the better mrbayes tree puts the flamingo-grebe as sister to shorebirds. we looked at the stability of this clade by reducing noise in the data set using site-stripping. this method systematically ry-codes or removes the most variable nucleotide sites  and then re-runs mrbayes . the flamingo/grebe  and flamingo/grebe/shorebirds clades were returned in all mrbayes analyses, even when  <dig> % of sites were re-coded as ry and a further 10% of sites were excluded. in contrast, the pelican and frigatebird were no longer grouped together at this level of site stripping, though the hummingbird/swift clade was retained. swift and hummingbird  came together in all trees, falling outside the large and very diverse group of raptors, shore and sea birds  <cit> .

kagu and takahe  did not come together in any of our unconstrained trees . the kagu is basal to the passerine/woodpecker/aracari clade and our rail representative  basal to the hummingbird/swift clade. however, when we constrained kagu and takahe to be monophyletic the resulting tree was not significantly worse than our best tree . some of the uncertainty in our dataset is illustrated on the mrbayes consensus network  – some partitions place the takahe basal to the hummingbird/swift, and some place it outside this clade but still basal to the water-carnivores. similar uncertainty is seen on the kagu lineage where we have signal for kagu to be basal to the woodpecker/aracari clade. the ability to show the presence of both signals  is an important advantage of combining tree and network methods  <cit> .

discussion
the phylogenetic hypotheses  generated by our whole mitochondrial genome sequences using different models are generally concordant. the relationships among the neoaves  differ little whether or not the outgroup  is included . where the two phylogenies differ is in small changes in the position of the loon, penguins, albatross/petrel, stork/heron, and pelican/frigatebird. in all other respects the inclusion of the galloanserae does not affect the relationships resolved and thus the basic stability of the tree is observed.

the seven birds in our mitochondrial sequence dataset that represent elements of the metaves group do not form a monophyletic clade. ericson and co-workers  <cit>  also failed to obtain the metaves clade using four nuclear genes, although they could with the inclusion of fgb-int <dig>  no other dataset, molecular nor morphological, has found direct evidence for the division of the neoaves into metaves and coronaves  <cit> . nor could fain and houde  <cit>  identify a single shared derived morphological character to unit the members of metaves. we cannot explain why fgb-int <dig> provides a division not seen in any other data set but this division is based on fewer than  <dig> nucleotide sites , and the monophyly of these two clades were supported by only 85% and 60% of maximum parsimony bootstraps. it should be noted that fain and houde  <cit>  characterize the members of metaves as taxomonically problematic  and our analyses indicates why this has been the case for both the kagu and tropicbird. from our mitochondrial sequences we can infer that neither kagu nor tropicbird are closely related to other members of the orders into which they are currently placed . however, there is no suggestion in our mitochondrial data that we should unite these 'problematic' taxa into a single clade  <cit> .

given the contradictory evidence from mtdna, we appraised the quality of phylogenetic signal from fgb-int <dig> data that returned monophyly of the metaves clade with weak support. however, we did not find evidence for obvious sources of the anomalous phylogeny; we found no indication that fgb-int <dig> has a paralog within birds and the alignment appears reasonable. so why does this one gene return a pattern not seen from any other characters? the intron is evolving rapidly enough to accumulate differences between sister species and has been used to resolve phylogenetic relationships within and among genera . however, the alignment of an intron with many indels and no constant sites could lead to the formation of artifact clades when studying relationships among orders that are more than  <dig> million years old. we note, again, that with our alignment of mitochondrial proteins, we exclude sites between a gap and a site that is constant across the dataset, and if we applied this conservative alignment criterion, we would have to exclude all fgb-int <dig> sites. overall, our conclusion is that the whole mitochondrial genome data strongly disagrees with the metaves/coronaves split, but the  <dig> parsimony sites in the fgb-int <dig> uniting the metaves remain unexplained. given the complete absence of support from other markers we doubt the fgb-int <dig> pattern is due to the shared evolutionary history of the bird species within metaves. nevertheless, we expect that fgb-int <dig> will be an excellent marker for studying evolution within genera and families where there should be no problems of alignment.

the metaves/coronaves split returned from analysis of fgb-int <dig> provided an intriguing framework in which to explore the evolution of avian ecology. the split, apparently characterized by multiple examples of convergent evolution  indicated a clear phylogenetic and hence historical dichotomy; a major, old division in the evolution of birds. given the failure of any additional nuclear or mtdna sequence data to support either of the metaves or coronaves clades and the clear contradiction from morphology and current taxonomy , where does this leave observations of convergent evolution in birds? clearly examples of convergence of form and behavior exist across the phylogeny of birds and were well recognized prior to the proposal of the metaves/coronaves split. of the three more controversial examples of avian ecological convergence proposed by fain and houde  <cit>  we can comment on two: tropicbirds and boobies as pelagic soaring plunge divers, and grebes and loons as "foot-propelled divers with high wing loading".

two of the three pelecaniformes represented are sister taxa; frigatebird and pelican , in agreement with livezey and zusi  <cit> . but in contrast to livezey and zusi  <cit> , the tropicbird does not appear to belong to this clade. placement of the topicbird is still difficult because trees of almost equal value place it basal to raptors , but never with other members of metaves. our findings support those from dna-dna hybridization where tropicbirds were basal to a large clade of aquatic birds that includes the new world vultures  <cit> . the tropicbird is not part of the pelecaniform clade  which also includes the boobies  <cit> , and therefore the similar feeding methods of the tropicbird and boobie look likely to have resulted from convergent evolution. similarly, although the grebes and loons are part of the same large clade they are not sister taxa and so their similar appearence and diving methods must also constitute convergence. in conjunction with the nine other examples of avian morphological convergent evolution  <cit>  one can conclude that the process is not an uncommon phenomenon within the bird radiation in general. however, these examples of morphological and ecological convergence do not support the metaves/coronaves division.

we find support in the whole mitochondrial genome data set for the sister relationship of swifts and hummingbirds , and find support for the grouping of flamingo and grebe . this may well form a sister clade to the charadriiformes ; our site-stripping technique showed this relationship to be stable, from which we infer a common evolutionary history. in keeping with this idea, morphological studies of extant and fossil species reveal that early flamingos resembled more typical wading birds and place the phoenicopteridae within the order charadriiformes  <cit> .

we find little support for the hypothesis that the kagu is related to the rails, although when forced together the resulting tree was not significantly worse. kagu appears to have no close allies in our data set and has long been recognized as a difficult species to place  <cit> . cracraft  <cit>  and others place kagu and rails within the gruiformes along with the mesites, bustards, seriemas, sunbittern, sungrebe, trumpeters and cranes. in contrast, livezey and zusi  <cit>  found the rails to be sister to the shorebirds , and the gruiformes  to be sister to this pair. as the takahe and kagu are  not allies we now have two long edges  within our phylogeny that have the potential to disrupt stable clades. addition of sunbittern to break-up the kagu long edge, and a crane, or another rail to break the takahe long-branch should solve this problem.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that avian mitochondrial genomes reject the hypothesis of a shared evolutionary history for hummingbirds, kagu, tropicbirds and flamingos. although some major neoaves clades remain to be sequenced  it is very unlikely that the addition of any avian species could force the seven metaves species in this dataset into a monophyletic clade. the phylogenetic tree of  <dig> bird species represented here has provided new hypotheses such as the sister relationship of the shorebirds and the flamingo/grebe clade that can now be tested with other datasets.
