BACKGROUND
leptospirosis is a zoonosis caused by pathogenic species of the genus leptospira. greater incidence of human infection occurs in tropical and subtropical countries  <cit> . the transmission of leptospirosis has been correlated with exposure of individuals in close proximity to wild or farm animals  <cit> . recently, the disease became prevalent in cities with sanitation problems and large urban rodent reservoirs that contaminate the environment through their urine  <cit> .

pathogenic leptospira spp. have ability to adhere and rapidly disseminate within the host during the early stage of infection. surface - associated proteins are potential targets to mediate host - pathogen interactions, and therefore are likely to elicit several activities, including adhesion. the adhesion of leptospires to ecm components of the host was considered to be essential in the initial stage of the infection  <cit> . indeed, we have reported that pathogenic leptospires are capable of binding several ecm molecules  <cit> . to date, several leptospiral ecm binding adhesins have been described  <cit> . after the adhesion, pathogens have to overcome tissue barriers in order to reach blood circulation and organs. we have reported that leptospires have the ability of binding plg at their surface and that plasmin  can be generated in the presence of activator  <cit> . in addition, verma and colleagues  <cit>  and our group have described several leptospiral proteins as plg - binding receptors  <cit> . more recently, we have reported that pla generation on leptospira decreased opsonization and that it might be an important aspect of the immune escape strategy and survival  <cit> .

l. interrogans serovar copenhageni genome annotation identified many unknown coding sequences predicted to be surface exposed proteins. characterization of these proteins, with no previously assigned function, should increase our understanding of this intriguing pathogen’s biology. in this work, we present our studies with two leptospiral coding sequences, lic <dig> and lic <dig>  named lsa <dig> and lsa <dig>  respectively. the genes were cloned and the proteins expressed using e. coli. the recombinant proteins were purified and their ability to bind various ecm and serum components was evaluated. we report that these proteins are novel surface adhesins capable of binding to laminin. in addition, lsa <dig> can also interact to plg and both proteins bind the complement regulator of the classical pathway c4bp. we believe that these proteins are likely to be involved in leptospira - host interactions.

RESULTS
bioinformatic analysis
the selected coding sequences, lic <dig> and lic <dig>  are genome annotated as hypothetical proteins, and one of them, lic <dig>  is a putative lipoprotein, having lipoprotein signal peptide  and a cleavage site between amino acids 17– <dig>  according to smart web server, lic <dig> has a signal peptide from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids and a fecr domain from amino acid  <dig> to  <dig>  pfam predicts that this domain is involved in regulation of iron dicitrate transport and that fecr is probably a sensor that recognizes iron dicitrate in the periplasm. lic <dig> presents a signal peptide from amino acid  <dig> to  <dig> and a duf <dig>  from amino acid  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . the lic <dig> coding sequence can be classified as alpha - beta protein, being the percentage of  <dig>  for alpha-helix and  <dig>  for beta strands secondary structure. in the case of coding sequence lic <dig>  the protein can be classified as mixed, having a predicted secondary structure composition percent of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for alpha - helix, beta strands and others, respectively. cellular localization predicts as extra - cellular  for both proteins. the solvent accessibility composition  for the cds lic <dig> and lic <dig> is expected to be  <dig>  and  <dig> % of amino acid residues exposed with more than 16% of their surface, respectively. all the predictions above were performed with precitedprotein web server  <cit> . the presence and identity of both coding sequences among leptospira sequenced genomes are depicted in table  <dig>

distribution and expression of lic <dig> and lic <dig> genes among leptospira strains
the presence of lic <dig> and lic <dig> genes in pathogenic strains and in one saprophytic strain was examined by pcr with a pair of primers designed according to l. interrogans serovar copenhageni genome sequences. the gene lic <dig> was amplified by pcr in all strains belonging to the pathogenic species excluding in l. santarosai serovar shermani . no dna amplification was detected in the non - pathogenic l. biflexa serovar patoc. in the case of lic <dig> gene, dna band was amplified in all pathogenic strains and a less intense band was detected in the saprophytic strain . the expression of lic <dig> and lic <dig> genes was evaluated by pcr amplification of reversely transcribed total rna. lic <dig> gene product was detected only in l. interrogans specie serovars canicola, pomona, copenhageni, icterohaemorrhagiae and hardjo. no expression was observed in non-pathogenic strain. lic <dig> gene expression could be identified in all pathogenic strain tested . integrity of total rna used in rt - pcr experiments was assured by the presence of a  <dig>  - bp 16 s ribosomal cdna fragment in all samples .

cloning and characterization of recombinant proteins
the amplified dna sequences of lic <dig> and lic <dig> were cloned into an e. coli pae vector  <cit>  and the corresponding proteins were expressed as full-length with 6x his sequence tag at their n - terminal. expression of recombinant proteins was elicited from cultures of e. coli bl <dig> si after addition of nacl . recombinant protein lsa <dig> is expressed in its soluble form, while lsa <dig> is expressed in its insoluble form, as inclusion bodies . protein lsa <dig> was recovered from inclusion bodies after solubilization with 8 m urea. the purification was performed by metal chelating chromatography under normal  or denaturing condition, followed by refolding by gradually removal of urea . the proteins were recovered with  <dig>  m imidazol. evaluation of protein purification has shown that most of the contaminants were washed away and proteins were represented as single major bands. the recombinant protein bands were further confirmed by western blotting probed with monoclonal anti - his tag antibodies and with polyclonal antiserum raised against each protein . the calculated  <dig>  kda and  <dig>  kda molecular masses of the recombinant proteins comprise the vector fusion plus the encoded amino acids. structural integrity of the purified proteins was assessed by circular dichroism  spectroscopy. the minima at  <dig> and 222 nm, and the maximum at 192 nm in the cd spectrum showed the high α - helical secondary structure content of both recombinant proteins .

recognition of the lic <dig> and lic <dig> coding sequences by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy
the assessment of the selected cdss on the bacterial cell membrane was performed using living organisms and the liquid - phase immunofluorescence method. leptospires were visualized by propidium iodide staining  followed by protein detection with polyclonal mouse antiserum raised against each protein in the presence of anti - mouse igg antibodies conjugated to fitc. green fluorescence could be observed in figure  <dig> column b, for lic <dig>  lic <dig> and lipl <dig>  an outer membrane protein used as a positive control  <cit> , but not with groel, a protoplasmic - cylinder marker, used as a negative control  <cit> . the localization of the protein - green light lying on the leptospires was achieved by merging both fields and the results obtained are shown in figure  <dig>  column c.

cellular localization of the lic <dig> and lic <dig> coding sequences by protease assay
we have performed proteinase k accessibility assay by using the previously described assay  with some modifications. live leptospires were treated with 25 μg/ml of proteinase k and aliquots of the bacterial suspensions were taken at time  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 5 h; the suspensions were sedimented and the ressuspended bacteria were used to coat microplates, followed by incubation with polyclonal antibodies against each protein, including the controls, lipl <dig> and dnak, for outer  <cit>  and cytoplasmic  <cit>  protein. the reactions proceeded as described in methods. the leptospiral coding sequences lic <dig> and lic <dig> were both susceptible to protease treatment after 1 h incubation, similar to the positive control lipl <dig> . almost no reduction was observed with dnak cytoplasmic protein .

recombinant protein lsa <dig> is recognized by antibodies of confirmed cases of leptospirosis
to examine whether lic <dig> and lic <dig> leptospiral coding sequences are able to elicit an immune response from an infected host, we evaluated the reactivity of the recombinant proteins lsa <dig> and lsa <dig> with antibodies present in serum samples of early  and convalescent  phases of leptospirosis patients. elisa was performed using  <dig> and  <dig> serum samples of negative mat and of positive mat, respectively. the recombinant protein lsa <dig> was almost non-reactive with samples from both phases of the disease , while lsa <dig> showed  <dig> and 48% reactivity for negative and positive mat, respectively . when the two proteins were assayed together, a small increment was observed for positive mat samples  . our data suggest that lsa <dig> might be an interesting protein for early diagnose of leptospirosis.

recombinant proteins adhesion to ecm components
the ability of lsa <dig> and lsa <dig> proteins to mediate host colonization by adhering to extracellular matrix proteins was examined by elisa. laminin, collagen type i, collagen type iv, cellular fibronectin, plasma fibronectin, and the control proteins fetuin and gelatin were immobilized on microdilution wells and recombinant protein attachment was assessed by elisa using antibodies against the proteins. as shown in figure 5a, both recombinant proteins exhibited adhesiveness to laminin, while no statistically significant binding was observed with these proteins when wells were coated with collagen type i and iv, cellular and plasma fibronectin, gelatin or with the highly glycosylated control protein fetuin. the interaction of recombinant proteins with laminin was also observed when anti - polyhistidine monoclonal antibodies were employed to probe the ligands . the binding between lsa <dig> and lsa <dig> with laminin was also evaluated on a quantitative basis as depicted in figure 5c. a dose - dependent and saturable binding was observed when increasing concentrations of the recombinant proteins  were allowed to adhere to a fixed laminin concentration  . binding saturation level was achieved by protein concentration of ~ <dig> and 5 μm for lsa <dig> and lsa <dig>  respectively. based on elisa data, the calculated dissociation equilibrium constants  for the recombinant protein lsa <dig> and lsa <dig> with laminin is  <dig>  and  <dig>  nm, respectively. the role of laminin sugar moieties in the binding with lsa <dig> and lsa <dig> was assessed with laminin previously oxidized by increasing concentrations of sodium metaperiodate, ranging from  <dig> to 100 mm. the effect of metaperiodate concentration on the interaction is displayed in figure 5d. laminin oxidation had some effect on the interaction with lsa <dig>  being the reduction of 40% achieved at the highest metaperiodate concentration employed . however, the attachment of lsa <dig> to metaperiodate - treated laminin had no interference on the binding. these results indicate that the binding of the proteins to laminin occur in a different manner and that sugar residues contribute to some extent for the interaction of lsa <dig> with this ecm glycoprotein. 

interaction of recombinant proteins to serum components
our group has recently reported that leptospires interact with plg and that several proteins could act as plg - receptors  <cit> . protein binding to complement regulators factor h and c4bp have also been shown  <cit> . therefore, we set out to evaluate whether the recombinant proteins lsa <dig> and lsa <dig> were capable of binding human plg, factor h and c4bp in vitro. the components, human plg, factor h and c4bp and the control proteins, gelatin and fetuin, were individually immobilized onto  <dig> - wells plates followed by incubation with the recombinant leptospiral proteins. the results obtained using polyclonal antibodies against each protein to probe the reactions showed that lsa <dig> and lsa <dig> interact with c4bp while only lsa <dig> appears to bind to plg . no reaction was observed with factor h and the control proteins . similar results were achieved when binding was performed using monoclonal anti - his tag antibodies . both data show that while lsa <dig> protein depicted a statistically significant absorption value for the interaction with plg, the lsa <dig> appears to have only a weak or no adherence to this component. these data were further confirmed when the reaction between the recombinant proteins and plg were assessed on a quantitative basis as illustrated in figure 6c. dose - dependent and saturable binding was observed when increasing concentrations  of the recombinant protein lsa <dig> were allowed to adhere to a fixed plg amount , while very low absorption was detected with lsa <dig> . based on the elisa data, the calculated kd for the recombinant proteinlsa <dig> with plg is  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm . this kd value is in the same order of magnitude with the ones obtained with several recombinant proteins in our laboratory  <cit> .

plg bound to leptospires and to several recombinant proteins, acting as plg receptor, can acquire proteolytic activity in the presence of an activator, as we have previously shown  <cit> . therefore, we investigated whether lsa <dig> bound to plg could also generate the enzymatically active plasmin. as a negative control, we have included the recombinant protein lsa <dig>  previously shown to be non-reactive with plg  <cit> . microplates were coated with the test protein, blocked, and then incubated with plg. unbound plg was washed away and the urokinase - type plg activator  was added together with a plasmin - specific chromogenic substrate. the reaction was carried out overnight and the plasmin activity was evaluated by measuring the cleavage of the substrate . as shown in figure 6d, the plg captured by the lsa <dig> protein could be converted into plasmin, as demonstrated indirectly by specific proteolytic activity. the negative controls lsa <dig> and bsa did not show any proteolytic activity, similar to the controls lacking plg, upa or the chromogenic substrate.

the interaction of recombinant proteins with c4bp was studied in function of protein concentration. we have employed anti –lsa <dig> and anti-lsa <dig> polyclonal  and anti-his tag monoclonal antibodies  to probe the binding. dose - response curves were obtained with both antibodies but the best response was achieved with anti-his tag monoclonal , probably because of their homogeneous nature. however, c4bp was not saturated with the protein concentration range employed and therefore the kd could not be calculated. lsa <dig>  a his - tag recombinant protein that does not bind c4bp was also included, as a negative control, showed very low interaction and did not respond to increase protein concentration.

inhibition of l. interrogans attachment to laminin or to plg by lsa <dig> and lsa25
it has been reported that the several recombinant proteins with adhesin activity revealed an inhibitory effect on the binding of leptospires to ecm macromolecules  <cit> . we therefore performed experiments to assess whether the recombinant proteins had an effect on the binding of leptospira to laminin or plg by employing elisa to detect the interaction in function of protein concentration . the results demonstrate that the addition of increasing concentrations of lsa <dig> reduced the leptospiral binding to laminin and to plg molecules in a dose - dependent manner . binding decrease in the number of leptospires interacting to laminin and plg was statistically significant with  <dig>  μg of lsa <dig> . this interference was also evaluated with the binding of leptospires to laminin in the presence of increasing concentrations of lsa <dig> , resulting in a similar effect as obtained with lsa <dig>  . we have also assessed the competition for the binding of lsa <dig> to plg by increasing laminin concentration . the results revealed that both ligands compete for the binding with lsa <dig> as a decrease of 40% in the binding was already detected with  <dig>  μg of laminin  . these experiments were performed in triplicate and figure  <dig> shows one representative data of two independent experiments.

discussion
complement is a key component of the innate immune system responsible for protection against pathogenic microorganisms  <cit> . factor h is a host fluid - phase regulator of the alternative complement pathway. pathogenic leptospiral complement - resistant strains were found to bind factor h from human serum and this interaction seems to be associated to their serum resistance  <cit> . c4b - binding protein is an inhibitor of complement classical pathway system. this protein controls the complement classical pathway by interfering with the formation and regeneration of c <dig> convertase and acting as a cofactor to the serine proteinase factor i in the proteolytic inactivation of c4b  <cit> . it has been shown that pathogenic leptospiral strains can obtain c4bp from the host and that this acquisition preserves its cofactor activity  <cit> . the surface bound c4bp elicits factor i mediated cleavage of c4b, an interaction that appears to contribute to complement resistance by leptospira, through the classical route  <cit> . leptospiral binding proteins to c4bp, factor h and factor h - like have also been identified in leptospira <cit> . interaction of c4bp and of factor h with other pathogens has been described, including the spirochetes borrelia spp.  <cit> .

the capacity of the leptospires to adhere to extracellular matrix components has been reported and to date, several leptospiral adhesins have been identified. these include  <dig> - kda fibronectin - binding protein  <cit> , lfha/lsa <dig>  <cit> , liga and ligb proteins  <cit> , len-family proteins  <cit> , lsa <dig>  <cit> , lipl <dig>  <cit> , lsa <dig>  <cit> , lp <dig>  <cit> , tlyc  <cit> , lipl <dig>  <cit> , lsa <dig>  <cit> , ompl <dig>  <cit> , lsa <dig>  <cit>  and lsa <dig>  <cit> . we have reported that leptospira species were also capable to bind plg and generating plasmin, in the presence of host activator, on the outer surface in vitro <cit> . in addition, we have described that plasmin - coated virulent l.interrogans bacteria were capable to degrade purified extracellular matrix components fibronectin  <cit>  and laminin , a step that may contribute for dissemination of the bacteria through the host tissues. more recently, we have shown that plasmin generation on the bacterial surface decreases the deposition of c3b and igg and hence, opsonization and phagocytosis, a process that could facilitate leptospires to evade the immune system  <cit> . several plg-receptor proteins in leptospira have been identified  <cit> .

by data mining the genome sequences of l. interrogans, searching for surface exposed proteins that could mediate host - pathogen interactions, we have identified two proteins annotated as leptospira conserved hypothetical, one of them, predicted to be a novel lipoprotein, lic <dig>  and the other, lic <dig>  has recently been shown to be non-protective in leptospiral challenge assay  <cit> . both selected coding sequences were cloned and the recombinant proteins expressed in e. coli. we report that these proteins, lsa <dig> and lsa <dig>  are laminin - binding adhesins and in the case of lsa <dig>  capable to bind plg generating enzymatically active plasmin. although weak, both proteins showed the ability to bind human purified c4bp, suggesting that these proteins have the potential to participate in leptospiral immune evasion by interfering with the complement classical pathway.

due to the high degree of antigenic variation among leptospires, we examined the gene/protein conservation among important species of leptospira. the lic <dig> and lic <dig> genes are conserved in five serovars of l. interrogans and in other species tested but in the case of l. santarosai serovar shermani the gene lic <dig> is absent. however, lic <dig> transcripts were detected only in serovars of l. interrogans, while lic <dig> appears to be expressed in all strains evaluated. none of the proteins seems to be expressed in the saprophytic strain, l. biflexa serovar patoc.

the recombinant proteins lsa <dig> and lsa <dig> were expressed with molecular mass of  <dig> - and  <dig> - kda, respectively, having a 6xhis tag at n - terminal. the purified proteins exhibited single major bands in sds - page and were recognized by anti - his tag monoclonal antibodies and by homolog sera from mice immunized with each recombinant protein. secondary structure of the recombinant proteins after the purification process was evaluated by cd spectroscopy and showed a predominance of alpha helices in both cases, similar to the data predicted by bioinformatics, indicating the suitability of recombinant proteins for further studies. the lic <dig> coding sequence is probably higher immunogenic than lic <dig> because it was recognized by approximately 45% of serum samples of both phases, initial and convalescent, of confirmed leptospirosis’s cases. interestingly, the lic <dig> protein although presented almost no reactivity among these serum samples, showed a slightly augment effect on serum reactivity when was assayed together with lic <dig>  immunofluorescence using live leptospires showed lic <dig> and lic <dig> coding sequences at the surface of bacteria, as a result of antiserum recognition raised against each protein. in silico analysis, proteinase k accessibility and immunofluorescence data together suggest that these proteins are likely to be surface exposed. in addition, the recombinant proteins partially inhibited leptospiral adherence to immobilized laminin and plg.

merien and colleagues  <cit>  identified a 36-kda fibronectin-binding protein expressed by a virulent variant of leptospira. our group described the first leptospiral laminin - binding protein, named lsa <dig>  <cit> . these studies were followed by the identification of several extracellular matrix binding proteins  <cit> . the recombinant proteins lsa <dig> and lsa <dig> exhibited extracellular matrix - binding properties, and are laminin - binding proteins. the binding affinity dissociation constants estimated for both proteins to laminin showed similar kd value of that reported for ompl  <dig>  and the same ecm molecule  <cit> . thus, it is possible that these proteins have a role in the adhesion of leptospires to hosts.

the plg activation system with generation of plasmin was described for virus, parasites and bacteria, including the spirochetes borrelia spp. and with treponema denticola <cit> . plasmin is a serine protease with the capacity to degrade a broad spectrum of substrates, including fibrin clots, connective tissue and components of extracellular matrices  <cit> . we have reported that leptospira spp. bind plg at their surface generating plasmin, when host activator is available, making the bacteria capable to degrade fibronectin  <cit>  and laminin . verma et al.  <cit>  have demonstrated that the protein lena of l. interrogans <cit>  is a surface receptor for human plg. moreover, we have reported several novel plg - receptor proteins of leptospira <cit> . we now describe lsa <dig> as a novel plg - binding protein. similar to the previously reported proteins, bound plg could be converted to plasmin by the addition of urokinase - type plg activator , showing specific proteolytic activity. it is thus possible that the lsa <dig> besides playing a role in the attachment to host and acting as plg - receptor, may also help leptospires to surmount tissue barriers.

the inhibitory effect exerted on the binding of leptospires to laminin and plg by the recombinant proteins was statistically significant with both, in the case of lsa <dig>  and with laminin for the lsa <dig>  the intensity of the interference upon the binding is expected given the presence of several ecm - or plg-binding proteins in leptospira. these data are comparable to the ones already reported in the literature  <cit> . partial inhibitory effect was observed by laminin on the binding of lsa <dig> to plg, suggesting a competition for the same binding site.

CONCLUSIONS
we report in these studies a characterization of two leptospiral proteins, genome annotated as proteins of unknown function. the recombinant proteins lsa <dig> and lsa <dig> are laminin binding proteins that might be involved in the attachment to host. moreover, both proteins showed the ability to bind c4bp, a feature suggesting their possible involvement in the immune evasion of leptospires. the recombinant lsa <dig> is also plg - binding protein that could help the bacteria during the infection process. thus, it appears that lsa <dig> and to a lesser degree, lsa <dig>  are multifaceted proteins that might have multiple functions in the leptospiral pathogenesis. to date, lsa <dig> is the first described laminin -, plg - and c4bp - leptospiral binding protein.
