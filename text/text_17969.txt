BACKGROUND
during its life cycle, plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest malaria parasite for humans, undergoes several successive rounds of mitosis to amplify parasite populations and consequently to increase the rate of its transmission. among the essential actors in the growth and division of the parasite are kinases and phosphatases. indeed, initial experiments using inhibitors of these enzymes, such as staurosporine and okadaic acid drastically inhibited parasite growth in vitro <cit> . subsequently, the identification of kinases and phosphatases and their central functions in p. falciparum <cit>  demonstrated that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation represent a key post-translational modification regulating the activities of a variety of proteins. the former process is supported by a recent high-throughput phosphoproteomic studies of blood stage parasites that identified around  <dig> phosphorylation sites on ~ 28% of proteins  <cit> . of note is that the profile of the reported phosphoproteome reflects the global status of proteins resulting from a balance between endogenous kinase and phosphatase activities. in vivo studies, knocking down kinases in plasmodium, and high-throughput screening of several thousand small chemical kinase inhibitors against blood stage parasites confirmed kinases as important drug targets  <cit> .

among the phosphatases, pp <dig> has been identified in p. falciparum  and it accounts for the major phosphatase activity in total parasite extracts  <cit> . the use of potent inhibitors of phosphatases showed that p. falciparum predominantly expressed pp1-like activity which appears to control parasite growth and seems to be involved in the release of infectious merozoites  <cit> . in the past decade, a vast body of research has provided converging evidence that the key mechanism of the mode of action of the pp1c subunit resides in the presence of interacting regulators that direct the proper functions of this phosphatase   <cit> . at present, there are about  <dig> pp <dig> interacting proteins among which about  <dig> have been identified as regulatory subunits of pp1c  <cit> . the majority of regulators that inhibit the phosphatase activity interact with pp1c through an amino acid sequence present in the regulator and designated as the ‘rvxf’ motif. the consensus sequence x0- <dig>  where x can be any amino acid and  any residue except proline, has been defined as a canonical pp1-binding site  <cit> . with respect to the endogenous regulators of pp <dig> and in comparison to other organisms, very few have so far been identified in p. falciparum, although we previously reported the identification of two regulators, pflrr <dig> and pf inhibitor- <dig>  <cit> . characterization studies have shown that both regulators interact with pfpp <dig> and are present in the nucleus of blood stage parasites. functional assays revealed that pflrr <dig> dramatically decreased pfpp <dig> activity, like its homologues in other organisms  <cit> . unexpectedly, pfi <dig> strongly increased pfpp <dig> activity in vitro and was unable to rescue yeast deleted for the expression of its ortholog. these data suggest that these regulators control pp <dig> activity in the nucleus and underscore the need for a better understanding of the function of pp <dig> regulators in each species  <cit> .

a database search with inhibitor- <dig>  and inhibitor- <dig> , known to be powerful regulators of pp1c, identified one open reading frame in the p. falciparum genome  encoding a potential protein with identity to known i <dig>  inhibitor- <dig> is a thermo- and acid-stable regulator initially purified from rabbit skeletal muscle and is conserved among all eukaryotes  <cit> . the potency of the inhibition by recombinant i <dig> of different species measured in parallel seems to be species specific in terms of inhibitory effect  <cit> . it is interesting to note that the peptide sequences of i <dig> orthologs vary in length, from  <dig> amino acids in plants up to  <dig> amino acids in humans. this may account for specificities mentioned above. the comparison of i <dig> sequences of different species along with in vitro functional studies revealed that two main regions participate in the interaction with pp1c and the inhibition of its activity: one binding region containing a ksqkw motif suggested to fulfill the role of the canonical rvxf motif and a second region containing a hyne motif  <cit> . in addition, a third region present in the n-terminal moiety of human i <dig> and containing a kgilk motif has also been shown to be involved in the interaction with pp1c  <cit> . the resolution of the rodent pp1c-i <dig> crystal structure confirmed the implication of these regions in the binding process  <cit> .

in vivo, the overexpression of glc <dig>  or the knockdown of human i <dig> by rna interference showed its direct role in the cell cycle  <cit> . for instance, human i <dig> knockdown produced multinucleated cells during anaphase and blocked cytokinesis  <cit> . moreover, exploration of the role of i <dig> in drosophila development evidenced that an i <dig> loss-of-function in mothers leads to a dramatic reduction in the viability of progeny as measured by a decrease in embryonic hatch rates and larval lethality. however, i <dig> gain-of-function by transgenic expression of i <dig> in mutant mothers reversed this effect  <cit> . altogether, these observations indicate that i <dig> plays a critical role in achieving successful mitosis and it is apparent that interfering with i <dig> functions represents an attractive approach for pharmacological intervention. here, we report the structure-function relationship of inhibitor- <dig> of p. falciparum  and explore its role and the means to affect its function in the parasite.

RESULTS
cloning and bioinformatics analysis of pf inhibitor-2
analysis of plasmodb  <cit>  using the human inhibitor- <dig> sequence  identified a gene  encoding a potential p. falciparum inhibitor- <dig> homolog . to establish the identity of the pfi <dig> sequence, we determined the nucleotide sequence by rt-pcr using cdna from total rna of blood stage parasites and primers specified in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the amplification showed a pcr product of the predicted size, confirming its transcription and the microarray data available in plasmodb. a walking approach on cdna from the untranslated 5′ and 3′ ends allowed the validation of the start and stop codons respectively. the deduced amino acid sequence of the open reading frame corresponds to a protein containing  <dig> amino acids, indicating that pfi <dig> has the shortest amino acid sequence among i <dig> homologs . sequence alignment combined with visual inspection of pfi <dig> showed an overall identity of 28% and 34% identity between amino acids at positions  <dig> to  <dig> of pfi <dig> when compared to human i <dig> . the use of psortii software  <cit>  revealed a putative nuclear localization signal  . the pfi <dig> protein contains two peptides ktisw and khyne that fit perfectly to the xx or rvxf motif and hyne motifs responsible for binding to pp1c . however,  <dig> main differences were observed between pfi <dig> and human i <dig> proteins. first, the kgilk sequence, found in human i <dig> and shown to be required for interaction with pp1c  <cit>  is not present in the pfi <dig> sequence and second, the ksqkw sequence of human i <dig> contains a q residue instead of v or i of the rvxf consensus sequence . the analysis of pfi <dig> using protein secondary structure prediction software psipred  <cit>  predicted that the rvxf motif is a part of an unstructured region, while the hyne motif is within an α-helix occurring between positions  <dig> and  <dig> . this structure is in agreement with that identified in mammalian i <dig>  <cit> . this analysis is in accordance with the structure prediction presented in plasmodb  <cit> .

a maximum likehood phylogenetic tree was generated under the jtt + i + g model with the support of two outgroups composed of two well described pp <dig> regulators: inhibitor  <dig>  and lrr <dig>   <cit> . in this tree  pfi <dig> segregates with orthologues from other plasmodium species as well as the apicomplexan theileria parva, but within the i <dig> family on a well-supported branch  separate from the i <dig> family. this analysis clearly identifies pfi <dig> as a pp1c inhibitor  <dig> family member.

expression of pfi <dig> protein by p. falciparum and localization studies
to investigate the expression of pfi <dig> by p. falciparum, polyclonal antibodies against the recombinant pfi <dig> protein were raised. as presented in figure 2a lane  <dig> , the recombinant protein whose amino acid sequence was confirmed by maldi-tof mass spectrometry, migrated at about  <dig> kda, in agreement with the anomalous electrophoretic behavior of inhibitors of the pp <dig> family; the expected molecular weight of endogenous pfi <dig> is  <dig>  kda. although these antibodies recognized the recombinant protein , they were unable to react with any bands in total extracts of asynchronous blood stage parasites. in order to detect endogenous pfi <dig>  we carried out immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-pfi <dig> sera or pre-bleed sera with total parasite extracts. immunoblots with anti-pfi <dig> antibodies showed the presence of a band at  <dig> kda in the immunoprecipitates with anti-pfi <dig> , while the pre-bleed serum detected no specific band . to confirm this expression and to examine whether native pfi <dig> could be among the partners of pfpp <dig>  we performed affinity purification from total parasite extracts using recombinant his-tagged pfpp <dig> retained on ni-nta agarose beads. as depicted in figure 2c, immunoblot analysis of eluates with anti-pfi <dig> antibodies  reacted with one band at  <dig> kda, corresponding to the migration of the recombinant pfi <dig> protein. lane  <dig> confirmed the presence of his-tagged pfpp <dig> by the use of mab anti-his antibody.

to accurately follow up the distribution of pfi <dig> during the intraerythrocytic development cycle, we examined 3d <dig> parasites transfected with a parl <dig> construct mediating the episomal expression of full-length gfp-fused pfi <dig>  the use of this vector by kuhn et al. showed that the trafficking was attributable to the nature of the protein expressed rather than to the pfcrt promoter used  <cit> . using a mab anti-gfp antibody, immunoblot analysis of a total extract of blood stage parasites expressing pfi2-gfp revealed the presence of a specific band at  <dig> kda, which is the expected molecular mass of pfi2-gfp . this demonstrates the integrity of the fused protein in transfected parasites. examination of live parasites showed that the signal was confined within the parasite where the distribution seemed to be nucleo-cytoplasmic , as the fluorescence partially overlapped dna staining. the distribution appeared to be diffuse in the late parasite stages with most staining in the nucleus. these results are in accordance with previous localization studies carried out on mammalian  <cit>  or plant  <cit>  cells showing a nucleo-cytoplasmic localization with an accumulation in the nucleus when human cells progressed into s phase  <cit> . the pfi2-gfp signal was completely absent from the digestive food vacuole .

genetic manipulation of pfi2
to study whether the lack of pfi <dig> expression could affect the plasmodium blood stage life cycle, attempts to disrupt the pfi <dig> gene using the pcam vector system were carried out. we transfected blood ring stage parasites of the 3d <dig> strain with a pcam-bsd-pfi <dig> construct containing a 5′ fragment derived from the genomic pfi <dig> sequence and the bsd gene conferring resistance to blasticidin . the presence of this construct in transfected parasites was checked by a plasmid rescue approach as previously described  <cit>  . from two independent transfection experiments, the analysis of genomic dna obtained from resistant stable parasites by pcr , with specific primers indicated in additional file 1: table s <dig>  did not evidence the interruption of the pfi <dig> gene . the wild type gene was still amplified in genomic dna even after prolonged culture  and the plasmid remained episomal.

the absence of knock-out parasites could be attributed either to the essentiality of pfi <dig> or to the lack of accessibility of pfi <dig> to genetic manipulations. to exclude the latter hypothesis and to check the accessibility for recombination of the pfi <dig> locus, we introduced a targeted modification in the locus without loss-of-function. to this end, 3d <dig> ring stage parasites were transfected with a plasmid containing the 3′ end of the pfi <dig> coding region fused to the hemagglutinin sequence . genotype analysis by pcr, using one specific primer of pfi <dig> derived from the upstream region of the construct pfi2-ha and a primer corresponding to the hemagglutinin sequence showed the presence of a specific pcr product at the expected size, indicating the correct integration of pfi2-ha into the locus . taken together, these data suggest the essentiality of pfi <dig> for the survival of blood stage parasites.

effect of pfi <dig> on phosphatase activity of pfpp1
next, we assayed pfi <dig> for its potential capacity to regulate pfpp <dig> activity. as previously described, pfpp <dig> produced as a recombinant protein dephosphorylates the pnpp substrate, is sensitive to known pp <dig> inhibitors and its activity is mn2+-dependent  <cit> . using a concentration of recombinant pfpp <dig> within a range producing linear release of phosphate, the effect of wild-type recombinant , deleted or mutant recombinant pfi <dig> proteins was evaluated as described in methods. deleted or mutated pfi <dig> versions presented in figure 4a were produced as recombinant proteins and used in the functional assay. results showed a strong decrease  in the phosphatase activity when pfpp <dig> was pre-incubated with pfi2wt . as pfi <dig> contains the  <dig> main motifs, 12ktisw <dig>  and 102hyne <dig>  known to be essential for the function of inhibitor- <dig>  we explored the impact of these motifs on pfi <dig> function in terms of pp <dig> inhibition. the deletion of either the nt ) or ct ) portion containing the rvxf and hyne motifs of pfi <dig> respectively abolished its inhibitory function almost completely . when the pfi2w16a mutant protein was tested, we observed that this mutation led to an almost complete loss of function of pfi <dig>  whatever the concentration of pfi2w16a used . the pfpp <dig> activity detected was identical to the control. in the case of the pfi2y103a mutant protein, a loss of function was observed at the lowest concentration, however, at higher concentrations of pfi2y103a a decrease of up to ~50% of pfpp <dig> activity was observed , suggesting that this mutation only partially affected the function of pfi <dig>  these data suggest that the rvxf motif is the major contributor for the function of pfi <dig> 

study of pfi2-pfpp <dig> interaction and mapping of binding motifs
the loss of function of deleted/mutated pfi <dig> observed above may be related to its failure to interact with pfpp <dig>  hence, the binding capacity of wild-type, deleted and mutated pfi <dig> with pfpp <dig> was assessed using the yeast two-hybrid system. the interaction between pfpp1-gal4-bd and pfi2-gal4-ad can be evidenced by growing diploid strains on sd media lacking leucine, tryptophan, histidine  or sd-lwha . mating assays between different strains are summarized in figure 5a, including those with control constructs. all mated strains were shown to be able to grow on sd-lw , indicating that they contained the pfi <dig> and pfpp <dig> constructs. western blot analysis showed the expression of tagged pfpp <dig>   and the expression of pfi <dig>  . the diploid strains containing pfpp <dig> and pfi2wt or deleted/mutated pfi <dig> , pfi2w16a or pfi2y103a) showed similar growth of these strains on sd-lwh media , indicative of an interaction with pfpp <dig>  however, the diploid strains containing pfpp <dig> and pfi <dig> or control plasmids were unable to grow. when stringent culture conditions were applied using sd-lwha medium, the strains containing pfpp1-pfi2wt, pfpp1-pfi <dig> or pfpp1-pfi2w16a were still able to grow while the strain containing pfpp1-pfi2y103a lost its capacity for growth , suggesting a role for y <dig> in the stability of the interaction. taken together, these results suggest that the loss of function of most deleted or single mutated pfi <dig> proteins is not due to a loss of interaction with pfpp <dig> 

initiation of g2/m in xenopus oocytes by pfi2
the partial conservation in pfi <dig> of two pp <dig> binding motifs likely suggests a capacity to interact with other pp <dig>  and to exert a potential function. previous studies reported that the inhibition of pp <dig> in xenopus oocytes by anti-pp <dig> antibodies triggered g2/m transition measured by the appearance of germinal vesicle break down or gvbd  <cit> . having established the inhibitory role of recombinant pfi <dig> on the phosphatase activity of pfpp <dig> in vitro, we followed up the induction of gvbd by microinjecting the wild or mutated his-tagged pfi <dig> proteins. also, we evaluated the ability of nt deleted pfi <dig> ) to trigger g2/m transition as it is still able to bind pp <dig> in the absence of the rvxf motif. results presented in figure 6a indicated that pfi2wt was able to induce gvbd . under the same conditions, pfi <dig>  pfi2w16a or pfi2y103a proteins were ineffective in inducing gvbd. the presence of each protein in microinjected oocytes was checked by immunoblots using anti-his mab . in parallel, it was essential to check whether pfi2wt can bind to xenopus pp <dig> . as shown in figure 6c, the use of a specific pp <dig> antibody for immunoblot analysis of eluates co-immunoprecipitated with anti-his mab revealed the presence of xepp <dig> in the complex . the complex pfi2wt-xepp <dig> was detected in xenopus extracts  <dig> mn post micro-injection .

the loss of functions of pfi <dig>  pfi2w16a and pfi2y103a, combined with the fact that they retain their capacity to bind to pfpp <dig>  prompted us to examine their capacity to block the function of pfi2wt. for this, oocytes were pre-injected with the deleted or mutated pfi <dig> proteins, incubated for  <dig> hr and followed by the injection of pfi2wt. results showed that pfi <dig> as well as pfi2w16a were able to completely abrogate the function of pfi2wt as no gvbd was observed . however, pfi2y103a did not inhibit the function of pfi2wt.

inhibition of pfi <dig> function by synthetic peptides
from the above results, it appears that w <dig> and y <dig> of pfi <dig> are critical residues within the ktisw  and hyne motifs for binding/inhibition of pp <dig> with a stronger role for the former. in addition, mutated pfi <dig> blocked the function of the full-length pfi2wt. consequently, we investigated whether synthetic peptides containing these motifs  could bind to pp <dig> and inhibit the function of pfi2wt. using elisa based experiments we found that pfpp <dig> was able to bind specifically to peptides containing either the ktisw  or hyne motifs . a higher capacity of pfpp <dig> to bind the ktisw-containing peptide  compared to the hyne-containing peptide  was observed. interestingly, in pfpp <dig> activity assays, and unlike pfi2wt, the synthetic peptides did not exhibit any capacity to inhibit pfpp <dig> activity . the absence of any effect of peptides alone on pp <dig> activity was further confirmed in vivo as their microinjection into xenopus oocytes did not induce gvbd . hence, we investigated whether synthetic peptides are able to block pfi2wt function as measured by gvbd induction. oocytes were pre-injected with peptides before the injection of pfi2wt. results presented in figure 7e revealed that the microinjection of either ktisw-containing peptide  or the hyne-containing peptide  almost completely abolished gvbd induction. pre-injections of control peptides  did not lead to any inhibition of pfi2wt-dependent gvbd. immunoblot analysis of co-immunoprecipitates with anti-his mab demonstrated that the pre-injections of p <dig> or p <dig> peptides prevented the binding of pfi2wt to xepp <dig> while the control peptides did not .

effect of peptides competing with pfi <dig> on the growth of blood-stage p. falciparum parasites
the ability of synthetic peptides to block the effect of pfi2wt using the xenopus model, combined with the observation suggesting that pfi <dig> is essential in p. falciparum blood-stage parasites, led us to evaluate the capacity of these peptides to inhibit the growth of p. falciparum in vitro. the synthetic peptides with repeated motifs of either the rvxf motif   or the hyne motif   did not show any effect on parasite growth  which could be due to very low or absence of peptide penetration. to improve and enhance peptide uptake, the penetrating peptide vkkkkikreiki , previously shown to act as a non-toxic shuttle to deliver peptides to infected red blood cells  <cit>  was coupled to the nh <dig> terminus of each repeated motif. as shown in figure 8a, the peptide p <dig> containing the ktisw motif inhibited parasite growth in a dose dependent manner with an inhibition of ~80% at a concentration of  <dig> μm. negative controls including peptides corresponding to the penetrating peptide alone  or to the mutated peptide  did not show specific inhibition. regarding the peptide containing hyne , no growth inhibition of blood stage parasites was detectable   although it was able to block the function of pfi2wt in the oocyte model .

to confirm the role of the rvxf competing peptide on p. falciparum growth, a second motif  derived from pf inhibitor- <dig>  which we previously reported as the rvxf motif of this inhibitor  <cit> , was evaluated under the same conditions. results presented in figure 8d indicate that the peptide containing the kvvrw sequence  did potently reduce parasitemia , while the mutated corresponding peptide  exhibited a drastically reduced capacity to inhibit parasite growth. as we observed a sigmoidal concentration effect relationship, ic <dig> values for the active peptides were calculated. based on  <dig> independent experiments carried out on the 3d <dig> strain with  <dig> different batches of synthetic peptides, ic50s were  <dig>  μm for ktisw  and  <dig>  μm for kvvrw  containing peptides respectively . when the effect of p <dig> and p <dig> peptides was tested on the hb <dig> strain , the ic50s were  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  μm respectively. finally, the toxicity of these peptides was evaluated by their capacity to block the proliferation of stimulated mouse spleen cells in vitro. the calculated ic <dig> was  <dig>  μm for the ktisw-containing peptide and  <dig>  μm for the kvvrw-containing peptide , showing a selectivity index of  <dig> to  <dig> fold for p.falciparum according to the peptide tested.

to further explore the uptake of active p <dig> and p <dig> peptides by blood parasite stages, fitc-labeled peptides were used. as shown in figure 8f, fitc-p <dig> was only accumulated within free merozoites, while fitc-p <dig> penetrated infected red blood cells and concentrated within intracellular parasites  as well as free merozoites . uninfected red blood cells did not accumulate any fitc-peptide .

discussion
the pf inhibitor <dig> gene  encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids related to the i <dig> proteins of different organisms, which are known to inhibit pp1c activity in vitro. of the three central regions identified in the i <dig> protein as binding motifs to pp <dig>  the kgilk, rvxf, and hyne motifs, pfi <dig> contained only a consensus rvxf  and the 102hyne <dig> sequences. the lack of kgilk in pfi <dig> was supported by bioinformatics analysis indicating the absence of this sequence in all potential open reading frames upstream of the pfi <dig> gene and was further confirmed by a 5′cdna walking approach. the kgilk motif present in vertebrate i <dig> was found to be involved in the interaction with pp <dig> through the region of amino acids 50– <dig> in pp1c  <cit> . in addition, deletion of the n-terminal side of i <dig> containing this site and mutation of the first lys or the ile dramatically reduced the inhibition capacity of i <dig>   <cit> . these observations emphasize the importance of this site in the binding and activity of vertebrate i <dig>  which represents a major difference compared with pfi <dig>  which lacks this motif. concerning the rvxf site, vertebrate i <dig> does not contain the canonical motif falling within the consensus sequence x0-1x0- <dig>  however, studies on the crystal structure of pp1c-i <dig> revealed that the sequence ksqkw, where the consensus val/ile residue is replaced by a gln is docked in the pp <dig> groove, which usually binds the rvxf motif  <cit> . structure-activity studies on the implication of ksqkw site showed that the mutation of trp in mammalian i <dig> drastically reduced the inhibitory activity of i <dig>  <cit> . it is worth noting that almost all i <dig> proteins contain gln at the position of val/ile. however, in p. falciparum, the i <dig> protein does contain an ile in the rvxf motif, a second important dissimilarity between pfi <dig> and other i <dig> proteins. the comparison of pfi <dig> with putative i <dig> of toxoplasma gondii or neospora canium , revealed the presence of the consensus rvxf sequence where v/i is replaced by leu, maintaining the hydrophobicity of the residue and suggesting its conservation within other apicomplexa parasites. studies on the third site of interaction, hyne, have shown that the his and tyr residues are important in the interaction with pp1c and it has been proposed that this motif functions as a ‘degenerate’ rvxf motif  <cit> . more recent studies clearly showed that the region containing the hyne motif interacts directly with the active site of pp1c  with a major contribution of his and tyr residues  <cit> . this excludes completely the possibility of a competition of binding to pp1c between the rvxf and hyne motifs and suggests that the his and tyr residues of i <dig> promote the displacement of the catalytic metal ion. in the pfi <dig> protein, these two residues are conserved.

among the three binding sites of i <dig>  the best-identified and most widely found in pp <dig> partners is the x0-1x0- <dig> consensus motif, which corresponds to ktisw in pfi <dig>  the presence of rvxf in about 25-30% of eukaryotic proteins is not a sufficient indicator in itself to classify a protein as a pp1c regulator  <cit> . these observations, together with the fact that pfi <dig> is the shortest i <dig> protein identified so far , the absence of one binding site  and the fundamental difference in the rvxf motif  raised the question of the capacity of pfi <dig> to bind and to regulate pfpp <dig>  using wild-type recombinant proteins, we showed that labeled pfpp <dig> was able to bind to pfi <dig> and vice versa. this was further validated by the use of a yeast two-hybrid system that confirmed the interaction of wild-type pfi <dig> with pfpp1c and suggested that it was strong since the mated pfi <dig> and pfpp <dig> yeast strains were able to grow under stringent conditions . in order to explore the contribution of pfi <dig> rvxf and hyne motifs for the interaction with pfpp <dig>  two types of constructions were used, one deleted for the nt moiety of pfi <dig> and the other with a single mutation in the rvxf motif. binding was unaffected on sd-lwh medium, whatever the construction tested and only one strain, carrying the pfi <dig> y103a, mutant was unable to grow under the most stringent conditions . these observations show that there is no one, major site of interaction in pfi <dig> unlike pf inhibitor- <dig> , for which we showed that the mutation of  <dig> w  completely abolished its binding/function  <cit> . pfi <dig> exhibits a totally disorganized structure and seems to bind first to pfpp <dig> via the rvxf groove and folds afterwards to accomplish its function  <cit> . regarding i <dig>  previous studies suggested a major role for the rvxf motif along with secondary binding sites which should be intrinsically structured for efficient binding to pp1c  <cit> . pfi <dig> secondary structure analysis predicted that the rvxf motif is a part of an unstructured region, while the hyne is within an α-helix. the role of this structure in pfi2-pfpp1c interaction was substantiated by the lack of binding of pfi <dig> deleted for the region containing the α-helix ). in the case of mutated pfi <dig>  the yeast two-hybrid method supported a role for 103tyr  in the stabilization of pfi2-pfpp <dig> binding under stringent culture conditions.

it has been shown that most i <dig> proteins are able to drastically decrease pp1c activity towards different non-specific substrates such as phosphorylase a and pnpp  <cit> . as expected, the addition of pfi <dig> in the nanomolar range significantly decreased pfpp <dig> activity up to 80%. to investigate the impact of ktisw  and hyne motifs on pfi <dig> regulatory activity we used deleted or mutated recombinant proteins. the contribution of the rvxf motif  is key to the function of pfi <dig> as both nt deleted pfi <dig> ) and mutated pfi <dig>  were unable to inhibit pfpp <dig> activity, whereas the involvement of the hyne domain seems to be less important. thus, although the pfi2w16a mutant is still able to bind to pfpp <dig>  12ktisw <dig> is a vital and a primary site for the inhibitory activity of pfi <dig>  to further evaluate the inhibitory activity of pfi <dig> and the role of the two motifs, we took advantage of the xenopus model where oocytes are physiologically arrested in g2/m prophase i  <cit> . the injection of xenopus i <dig>  or anti pp <dig> antibodies into oocytes induced germinal vesicle breakdown or gvbd  <cit> . plasmodium i <dig> is able to substitute for the xenopus orthologue in this system since the microinjection of pfi2wt into oocytes promoted the progression to m phase, inducing gvbd and co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the interaction of pfi <dig> with xenopus pp1c. this confirmed that pfi <dig> can function in cells without the need for the kgilk site and are in accordance with previous studies that showed the involvement of xenopus i <dig> in the g2/m transition in acellular extracts  <cit>  or the implication of glc <dig>  in the cell cycle  <cit> . deletion, mutation or rna interference studies carried out on inhibitor  <dig> have demonstrated its implication in the cell cycle, chromosome segregation and embryogenic development  <cit> . in the case of pfi <dig>  when deleted pfi <dig> ) lacking 12ktisw <dig> or mutated pfi <dig>  were microinjected, no gvbd was observed, demonstrating the importance of both pfpp <dig> binding sites in the functional capacity of pfi <dig>  since the pfi <dig> mutated proteins are able to bind pp <dig> but unable to inhibit its function we sought to determine whether the pre-injection of deleted or mutated pfi <dig> proteins may block the role of wild pfi <dig>  the pre-injection of either pfi <dig> or pfi2w16a were able to block the induction of gvbd while pfi2y103a did not. one explanation for these observations is that the hyne-dependent binding is critical as the injection of pfi2wt is able to displace this mutated protein and to induce gvbd. when the hyne site is not mutated the binding of pfi <dig> is sufficiently stable to prevent its displacement.

closer examination of the pfi <dig> peptide sequence revealed the presence of a consensus pxtp motif , also present in other i <dig>  in which the phosphorylation of the t within this site abrogated the function of i <dig>  <cit> . in pfi <dig>  the replacement of t by d  did not impact either the binding or the function of pfi <dig> , tending to exclude the phospho-regulation of i <dig> at this site. these data are in agreement with the recent p. falciparum phosphoproteome characterization showing the phosphorylation of pfi <dig> at positions t <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  t <dig> and s <dig> <cit> , but not at t <dig> within the pxtp motif. the assessment of the impact of pfi <dig> phosphorylation will await further investigations on these phosphorylated residues as well as the “t” within the pxtp motif. at this stage, it is important to mention that, beside the capacity to interact with pp1c, human i <dig> has been shown to participate in a direct kinase-dependent signaling network. it was found that i <dig> was able to bind and to activate nek <dig> and aurora-a kinases  <cit> . for these functions, i <dig> seems to operate through its c-terminal domain as the protein deleted in this domain ) failed to interact with these kinases, excluding a role for the kgilk and rvxf motifs. although the pfi <dig> sequence is  <dig> amino acids shorter than its human homologue, the capacity of pfi <dig> to bind p. falciparum kinases of the nima and aurora families  should be evaluated.

in p. falciparum, microarray analysis detected pfi <dig> mrna in all blood parasite stages and gametocytes . in this work, co-immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-pfi <dig> antibodies followed by western blotting and the use of a pfpp <dig> affinity column clearly revealed the expression of pfi <dig> protein by p. falciparum and of its capacity to bind pfpp <dig>  transfection of live parasites with the tagged pfi2-gfp protein showed that its distribution is nucleocytoplasmic, like pfpp <dig>  <cit> , with a strong accumulation in the nucleus, is in agreement with the localization of other i <dig> proteins  <cit> . indeed mammalian i <dig> fused to gfp was localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, with an active import to the latter compartment, supported by the presence of two putative nuclear localization signals  <cit> . in the case of pfi <dig>  bioinformatics analysis also revealed a putative nuclear localization signal, supporting its nuclear localization. we previously reported that pflrr <dig> and pf inhibitor- <dig>  the first identified regulatory subunits of pfpp1c, localized to the nucleus, evoking a specific role in this compartment  <cit> . the present study suggests an additional role for the pfi <dig> regulatory subunit of pp1c, present in the nucleus but also in the cytoplasm. our reverse genetic studies strongly suggest a critical role for pfi <dig> in the erythrocytic asexual cycle in vitro as no parasites with a disrupted pfi <dig> gene were detectable. definition of the pfi <dig> role during the life cycle necessitates further work, requiring the development of a powerful inducible expression system for p. falciparum.

the ability of pfi <dig> to bind and to inhibit pp1c both in vitro and in cellular conditions  through the two main motifs: the rvxf motif  and the hyne motif, together with the fact that a tight and appropriate regulation of pp1c is crucial for cellular functions, led us to explore whether derived ‘competing’ peptides from pfi <dig> could bind to pp1c and inhibit downstream signaling pathways. only peptides containing the ktisw or hyne motifs were able to bind to pfpp1c. however, the incubation of these peptides with pfpp <dig> or their injection into oocytes failed either to inhibit phosphatase activity or to promote gvbd respectively. however, the pre-injection of the ktisw and hyne peptides did block the pfi2-dependent gvbd. moreover, there was no interaction between xenopus pp <dig> and pfi <dig> in extracts of oocytes pre-injected with the ktisw or hyne peptides. this encouraged us to investigate the ability of these peptides to inhibit the growth of p. falciparum. to do this, the capacity of the peptides to cross membranes was first improved by including a short basic peptide, which has been shown to be highly efficient in increasing the permeability of peptides and to promote accumulation within infected red blood cells  <cit> . peptides encompassing the rvxf degenerate motif r/kx0- <dig> v/i x0- <dig> f/w  inhibited the growth of 3d <dig> p. falciparum strain at low micro-molar concentrations. the substitution of amino acids essential for binding with pfpp <dig> validated that the growth inhibition was rvxf-dependent. the difference in the observed ic <dig> values of ktisw and kvvrw containing peptides could be related to a higher affinity of the latter for pfpp <dig> and the fact that it proved able to accumulate not only in merozoites but also in parasites within infected red blood cells. unexpectedly, the second pp <dig> binding peptide containing the hyne motif, although it was found functional in oocyte model, was not active as an antiplasmodial suggesting that native pfi <dig> expressed by p. falciparum could displace the hyne peptide. one possible explanation for the anti-parasitic activity of rvxf containing peptides is that an increase in pp <dig> activity due to its reduced interaction with regulators could result in uncontrolled protein dephosphorylation, leading in turn to an inhibition of parasite differentiation/growth. this implies that each competing active peptide can block its respective protein but that cross-inhibition of other partners using the same docking site cannot be excluded. these peptides might prove very useful as fundamental research tools to dissect pathways and processes controlled by pp <dig> in plasmodium falciparum.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we report the molecular analysis and functional role of the inhibitor- <dig> regulator, a gene product that binds to and controls the activity of pfpp <dig>  structure-activity studies of this regulator led to the identification of binding/functional motifs of pfi <dig>  in addition, peptides corresponding to the rvxf motif exhibit anti-plasmodial activity against blood stage parasites in vitro. although, additional investigations are required to better define the interaction of competing peptides in the parasite, the proof-of-concept finding of derived peptides from regulators of pfpp <dig> that inhibit the binding of pfi <dig> to pfpp <dig> and, in consequence, parasite growth is an important advance. it opens new avenues for the design of novel anti-parasitic therapeutics by screening large combinatorial libraries of small compounds blocking the function of regulators of pfpp <dig>  interestingly, a recent study showed that the selective inhibition of gadd <dig>  a human regulator of pp <dig>  by guanabenz  was able to restore proteostasis and to protect stressed cells  <cit> . this further confirms that interfering with the interaction of pp1-regulators and/or dissociation of the complex can help to better understand the role of pfpp <dig> and to create new means to develop antimalarials.
