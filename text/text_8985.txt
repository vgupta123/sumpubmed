BACKGROUND
cuticular wax production on aerial surfaces of plants has important roles in various physiological functions and developmental events; the wax prevents non-stomatal water loss, inhibits organ fusion during development, protects from uv radiation damage, and imposes a physical barrier against pathogenic infection  <cit> . the trait, the coating of leaf and stem surfaces with a waxy whitish substance, is called glaucousness. in common wheat , dominant alleles w <dig> and w <dig>  control the wax production and have been assigned to chromosomes 2b and 2d, respectively  <cit> . additionally, dominant homoeoalleles for non-glaucousness, iw <dig> and iw <dig>  have also been mapped to the short arms of chromosomes 2b and 2d, respectively  <cit> . wheat plants with either the w <dig>  w <dig>  iw <dig> or iw <dig> allele show the non-glaucous phenotype, indicating that w <dig> and w <dig> are functionally redundant for the glaucous phenotype and that a single iw dominant allele is sufficient to inhibit the glaucous phenotype even in the presence of a w <dig> or w <dig> allele  <cit> . wax composition in wheat plants with one iw dominant allele is biochemically different from that in glaucous plants of any genotype; ß-diketones are completely absent from extracts of cuticular wax from iw plants, while aldehydes and primary alcohols are very abundant in these extracts  <cit> . a fine map around the iw <dig> region on 2bs was constructed using an f <dig> population of tetraploid wheat , and three markers tightly linked to iw <dig> were developed  <cit> . a high-resolution map of iw <dig> on 2ds has been developed in hexaploid wheat, and two markers tightly linked to iw <dig> were also developed  <cit> . comparative mapping of iw <dig> and iw <dig> shows that the two loci are homoeologous to each other and orthologous to the same chromosomal region of brachypodium distachyon  p. beauv.  <cit> . recently, a third wax-inhibitor locus iw <dig> was identified on chromosome 1bs from wild emmer wheat  <cit> , and a fine map of the iw <dig> locus is available  <cit> . iw <dig> is located on 2ds in aegilops tauschii coss. , which is diploid and the progenitor of the d-genome of common wheat  <cit> , but to our knowledge, a high-resolution genetic map of the iw <dig> region in ae. tauschii has not been constructed.

common wheat is an allohexaploid species derived from interspecific hybridization between tetraploid wheat with a bbaa genome and ae. tauschii. most cultivated varieties of tetraploid wheat are glaucous, even though non-glaucous types are frequently found among wild tetraploid accessions  <cit> ; this variation indicates that the glaucous phenotype might have been a target of artificial selection during the domestication of tetraploid wheat. glaucous accessions of ae. tauschii are found in the area ranging from transcaucasia to the southern coastal region of the caspian sea  <cit> . almost all varieties of common wheat carry w <dig> and w <dig> and lack iw <dig> and iw2; therefore, the d-genome donor of common wheat is assumed to have had the recessive iw <dig> allele  <cit> . glaucous ae. tauschii accessions have the w <dig> and iw <dig> alleles. non-glaucous accessions of ae. tauschii that have the w <dig> and iw <dig> alleles have been recovered from a wide distribution range in central eurasia  <cit> . moreover, discovery of a non-glaucous ae. tauschii accession with the w <dig> recessive allele has not yet been reported.

therefore, analysis of the iw <dig> locus may provide important information that improves our understanding of the evolution of common wheat. population structure analyses of ae. tauschii indicate that the whole species ae. tauschii can be divided into three major genealogical lineages, tauschii lineage  <dig> , taul <dig>  and taul <dig>  and that genetically genomes of taul <dig> accessions are most closely related to the d genome of common wheat  <cit> . recently, a whole-genome shotgun strategy was used to generate a draft genome sequence of ae. tauschii that has been published; this draft anchors  <dig>  gb of the  <dig>  gb genome to chromosomes  <cit> . a physical map of the ae. tauschii genome that covers  <dig> gb is also available  <cit> . the objectives of this study were  to examine the natural variation in glaucousness among a species-wide set of ae. tauschii accessions,  to use f <dig> populations of ae. tauschii accessions and synthetic hexaploid wheat lines to fine-map iw <dig> locus on 2ds,  to develop molecular markers that are closely linked to iw <dig> based on chromosomal synteny between barley and wheat chromosomes, and  to provide novel insights into the evolutionary relationship between the ae. tauschii genome and the d genome of common wheat on the basis of the detailed genetic and phylogeographic knowledge of the iw <dig> chromosomal region.

methods
plant materials and phenotype evaluation
in all,  <dig> ae. tauschii accessions were used in this study  <cit> . their passport data, including geographical coordinates, have been provided in previous reports  <cit> . previously,  <dig> of the ae. tasuchii accessions were grouped into the three lineages, taul <dig>  taul <dig>  and taul <dig>  based on dart marker genotyping analysis  <cit> . of the  <dig> accessions,  <dig> were previously identified as subspecies strangulata based on the sensu-strico criteria  <cit> . seeds from two ae. tauschii hybrid f <dig> populations  were sown in november 2011; one f <dig> population resulted from a cross between ku- <dig>  and ku- <dig> , the other from a ku- <dig>  by ku- <dig>  cross. in the 2012– <dig> season,  <dig> additional f <dig> individuals of the ku-2154/ku- <dig> population were grown to increase the size of the mapping population.

previously,  <dig> synthetic hexaploid wheat lines were produced from crosses between a tetraploid wheat  husn.) cultivar langdon  and  <dig> ae. tauschii accessions  <cit> . these synthetic hexaploid wheat lines were used for crossing and phenotypic studies conducted in a glasshouse at kobe university. ldn shows the glaucous phenotype and is homozygous for the iw <dig> allele  <cit> . each synthetic hexaploid thus contained the a and b genomes from ldn and one of many diverse d genomes originating from the ae. tauschii pollen parents. in the present study, four f <dig> plants derived from one f <dig> plant of each synthetic hexaploid were grown individually during the 2007– <dig> season in pots that were arranged randomly in the glasshouse; these 276 f <dig> plants were used for crossing and phenotypic observation. the following three pairs of synthetic hexaploids were used to generate three f <dig> mapping populations: ldn/pi <dig>  and ldn/ku- <dig> , ldn/ig <dig>  and ldn/ku- <dig> , and ldn/ku- <dig>  and ldn/ig <dig> . the first population  comprised 106 f <dig> individuals grown in the glasshouse during the 2009– <dig> season. seeds from the other two populations were sown in november  <dig>  with the numbers of individuals in each being  <dig>  and  <dig> .

for analysis of the d genome of common wheat,  <dig> landraces collected in iran were supplied from the national bioresource project  komugi . these iranian landraces—ku- <dig>  ku- <dig>  ku- <dig>  ku- <dig>  ku- <dig>  ku- <dig>  ku- <dig>  ku- <dig>  ku- <dig>  ku- <dig>  ku- <dig>  ku- <dig>  ku- <dig>  ku- <dig>  ku- <dig>  ku- <dig>  and ku-10510—each showed the glaucous phenotype.

glaucousness was evaluated based on the presence or absence of wax production on the surface of peduncles and spikes in both ae. tauschii and synthetics. wax production was clearly visible and whitish.

genotyping and construction of linkage maps
to amplify pcr fragments containing molecular markers, some of which were simple sequence repeats , total dna was extracted from leaves of the parental strains and f <dig> individuals. for ssr genotyping, 40 cycles of pcr were performed using 2x quick taq hs dyemix  and the following conditions: 10 s at 94°c, 30 s at the appropriate annealing temperature , and 30 s at 68°c. the last step was a 1-min incubation at 68°c. information on ssr markers and the respective annealing temperatures was obtained from the nbrp komugi web site  and the graingenes web site . pcr products were resolved in 2% agarose or 13% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized under uv light after staining with ethidium bromide. the mapmaker/exp version  <dig> b package was used for genetic mapping  <cit> . the threshold for log-likelihood scores was set at  <dig> , and genetic distances were calculated with the kosambi function  <cit> .

each polymorphism at the ppd-d <dig> locus on 2ds was detected with allele-specific primers and methodology described by beales et al.  <cit> . a common forward primer, ppd-d1_f , and two reverse primers, ppd-d1_r <dig>  and ppd-d1_r <dig> , were used for this pcr analysis. pcr products amplified with ppd-d1_f and ppd-d1_r <dig> detected a  <dig> -bp deletion in the 5′ upstream region of ppd-d <dig> that is indicative of the photoperiod-insensitive ppd-d1a allele  <cit> . est-derived sequence-tagged site  markers on 2ds, te <dig>  and we <dig> were also used for genotyping; two sts markers for each locus, and these markers were previously developed along with the iw2-linked markers  <cit> . the amplified pcr products were separated via electrophoresis through a 2% agarose or 13% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and then stained with ethidium bromide.

development of additional markers linked to iw2
in our previous studies, we conducted deep-sequencing analyses of the leaf and spike transcriptomes of two ae. tauschii accessions that represented two major lineages, and discovered more than  <dig>  high-confidence single nucleotide polymorphisms  in  <dig>  contigs  <cit> . contigs with the snps were searched with blastn against ae. tauschii genome sequences  <cit>  and barley genome sequences  <cit> ; these genome sequences included high-confidence genes with an e-value threshold of 10− <dig> and hit length ≥ 50 bp, fingerprinted contigs, and whole genome shotgun assemblies.

to choose scaffolds for ae. tauschii sequences throughout the iw <dig> chromosomal region, all the genes contained in each scaffold were searched with blastn against the barley genomic sequence using parameters described above. scaffolds containing at least one gene aligned on the distal region of chromosome 2hs  were considered possible candidates for marker development. scaffolds without genes were anchored based on respective results from the blastn searches against the barley genome. first, high-confidence snps  <cit>  plotted in this 2hs chromosomal segment were used for marker development to refine the target region. next, sciroko version  <dig>   <cit>  was used with search mode setting “mismatched; fixed penalty” to identify additional ssr markers in sequence data of candidate scaffolds. additional snps were also identified on candidate scaffolds by sequencing approximately 700 bp of amplified dna of two ae. tauschii accessions, ku- <dig> and ku- <dig>  the nucleotide sequences were determined using an applied biosystems 3730xl dna analyzer , and snps were found via sequence alignments constructed and searched with genetyx-mac version  <dig>  software .

for genotyping, total dna was extracted from leaves taken from each of the  <dig> ae. tauschii accessions and the  <dig> iranian wheat landraces. ssr amplification and detection of polymorphisms at these loci were conducted as described above. the identified snps were then further developed into cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence  or high resolution melting  markers. the primer sequences for each snp marker and any relevant restriction enzymes are summarized in additional file  <dig>  pcr and subsequent analyses were performed as described previously  <cit> .

blast analysis of the ae. tauschii genes relative to the brachypodium genome
nucleotide sequences and annotation information of the selected ae. tauschii scaffolds were analyzed with reference to the ae. tauschii draft genome data, which was published by jia et al.  <cit> . reference sequences from brachypodium  <cit>  were searched against the national center for biotechnology information  nr protein database using the blastx algorithm with an e-value cut-off of 10− <dig> 

association analysis of the linked markers with glaucousness
the q + k method was conducted using a mixed linear model  function in tassel ver  <dig>  software  <cit>  for an association analysis by incorporating phenotypic and genotypic data and information on population structure. in a previous report, the bayesian clustering approach implemented in the software program structure  <dig>   <cit>  was used with the setting k =  <dig> to predict the population structure of the ae. tauschii accessions  <cit> . the q-matrix of population membership probabilities was served as covariates in mlm. kinship  was calculated in tassel based on the genotyping information of the  <dig> dart markers for the  <dig> ae. tauschii accessions  <cit> . we performed the f-statistics and calculated the p-values for the f-test, and the threshold value was set as 1e- <dig> for the significant association. we omitted the target markers from the association analysis when their minor allele frequencies were less than  <dig> .

RESULTS
wax production variation among ae. tauschii accessions and among synthetic wheat lines
of the  <dig> ae. tauschii accessions examined, only  <dig>  exhibited the glaucous phenotype and produced whitish wax on the surfaces of peduncles and spikes . wax production for each accession was completely consistent between the fukui and kobe environments. each glaucous accession belonged to ae. tauschii subspecies tauschii; in other words, none belonged to ae. tauschii subspecies strangulata; the geographic distribution of glaucous accessions was limited to the area that spans from transcaucasia to the southern coastal region of the caspian sea . in the eastern habitats  of the species range, no glaucous accession was found. of the  <dig> glaucous accessions,  <dig> belonged to the taul <dig> lineage, and only one  belonged to the taul <dig> lineage .figure  <dig>

of the  <dig> synthetic wheat lines that we examined,  <dig> exhibited whitish wax production on the peduncle and spike surface , whereas no wax production was evident in any of the  <dig> other lines . of the  <dig> lines that showed the glaucous phenotype,  <dig> were produced by crossing ldn with glaucous ae. tauschii accessions, and each of the  <dig> non-glaucous lines was produced by crossing ldn with a non-glaucous ae. tauschii accession. notably, two synthetic lines, ldn/ku- <dig> and ldn/ku- <dig>  exhibited the glaucous phenotype even though their parental ae. tauschii accessions were non-glaucous.

mapping of the iw <dig> locus in ae. tauschii and synthetic wheat
two f <dig> populations of ae. tauschii and three f <dig> populations from the synthetic wheat lines were analyzed to map the loci that control inhibition of wax production. each f <dig> plant used for the five cross combinations exhibited the non-glaucous phenotype. in each f <dig> population, the ratio of non-glaucous to glaucous individuals was 3:1; these findings were statistically significant and consistent with mendelian segregation of alleles of a single gene . these results indicated that a single genetic locus was associated with the phenotypic difference between non-glaucous and glaucous surfaces on peduncles and spikes, and that allele conferring the non-glaucous phenotype was dominant and the allele conferring the glaucous phenotype was recessive.table  <dig>

a single locus that controlled inhibition of wax production in ae. tauschii was mapped to the same region of the short arm of chromosome 2d in each f <dig> mapping population . in the ku-2003/ku- <dig> population, the locus that controlled inhibition of wax production, together with the loci for  <dig> ssr markers and ppd-d <dig>  was assigned to chromosome 2d, and the map length was  <dig>  cm with an average inter-loci interval of  <dig>  cm. in the ku-2154/ku- <dig> population, the locus that controlled inhibition of wax production, together with  <dig> ssr and  <dig> sts markers and ppd-d <dig>  was assigned to chromosome 2d, and the map length was  <dig>  cm with average inter-loci spacing of  <dig>  cm. in the three synthetic wheat populations, ldn/ku-2159//ldn/ig <dig>  ldn/ku-2124//ldn/ig <dig>  and ldn/pi476874//ldn/ku- <dig>  the locus that controlled inhibition of wax production was mapped to a similar position on the short arm of chromosome 2d . in these three synthetic wheat populations, the locus that controlled inhibition of wax production was mapped together with  <dig> to  <dig> ssr markers,  <dig> to  <dig> sts markers, and ppd-d1; additionally, the map lengths ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm with an average inter-loci spacing of  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm.figure  <dig>

we <dig> and te <dig> are est-derived sts markers that are linked to iw <dig> in two mapping populations  <cit> . in three of our mapping populations, linkage of the non-glaucousness loci to we <dig> and te <dig> were confirmed. thus, the position of one locus that controlled inhibition of wax production in ae. tauschii corresponded to the well-known wax inhibitor gene, iw <dig>  on chromosome 2d  <cit> . therefore, hereafter, all glaucousness-related loci mapped in this study were considered to be identical to iw <dig> 

fine mapping of the iw <dig> locus
the high-confidence snps derived from ae. tauschii rna-seq data have been plotted onto barley chromosomes  <cit> , and physical map information for the barley genome is available  <cit> . additionally, physical map information for ae. tauschii and  <dig>  scaffolds that constitute  <dig>  gb from the draft ae. tauschii genome sequence are anchored to the ae. tauschii linkage map  <cit> . the rna-seq-derived snp information  <cit>  was used to map seven high-confidence snps, represented as xctg loci in figure  <dig>  throughout the iw <dig> chromosomal region in the ku-2154/ku-2126 f <dig> population. of the seven xctg loci, four were located within the  <dig>  cm chromosomal region immediately surrounding iw <dig>  nucleotide sequences of the four cdnas corresponding to these xctg loci were used as queries to select the carrier scaffolds from ae. tauschii sequences. we selected the ae. tauschii scaffolds that mapped near the xctg-carrying ae. tauschii scaffolds based on synteny between the wheat and barley genomes and the barley physical map  <cit> . in all,  <dig> ae. tauschii scaffolds were assigned in silico to an area of the ae. tauschii genome that corresponded to the iw <dig> region in the physical map of barley chromosome 2h . using a previously developed physical map of the ae. tauschii 2ds chromosome  <cit> , we mapped six ae. tauschii scaffolds in silico to the corresponding region in the 2ds physical map. nucleotide sequences of the selected scaffolds were used to design caps or ssr markers for each scaffold, and the markers that were polymorphic between ku- <dig> and ku- <dig> were then mapped in the f <dig> population .figure  <dig>

of the selected scaffolds,  <dig> were mapped to the iw <dig> chromosomal region on 2ds, and the remaining three scaffolds were assigned to other chromosomes. in the ku-2154/ku- <dig> population with 115 f <dig> individuals, the iw <dig> locus was mapped within the  <dig>  cm interval between the most closely linked markers . a dominant marker , derived from the ae. tauschii scaffold  <dig> sequence, was located  <dig>  cm distal to iw <dig>  and the we <dig> ssr marker was located  <dig>  cm proximal to iw <dig>  five co-dominant markers, derived from two ae. tauschii scaffolds  <dig> and  <dig>  co-localized with iw <dig>  the marker order in the ku-2154/ku- <dig> linkage map was generally conserved with that in the barley 2h physical map. however, barley scaffold  <dig> was more closely linked to the barley iw <dig> ortholog than were two corresponding ae. tauschii scaffolds,  <dig> and  <dig>  to the tauschii iw <dig> ortholog; this positioning indicated that a local inversion had occurred in the region proximal to iw <dig> during the divergence between barley and tauschii.

next, f <dig> individuals of the ku-2154/ku- <dig> population and  <dig> markers from five ae. tauschii scaffolds were used to construct a fine map of iw <dig> . based on this linkage map, iw <dig> was located within the  <dig>  cm between xctg216249/s51038- <dig> and we <dig> and co-localized with five markers derived from two scaffolds,  <dig> and  <dig>  each of the five scaffolds was  <dig> to 334 kb in length and included one to  <dig> putative protein-coding genes  <cit> ; marker positions of each scaffold are indicated in figure 4b. of the  <dig> markers, eight were derived from intergenic regions, the other four from open reading frames.figure  <dig>

the ae. tauschii scaffolds that included protein coding genes were used as queries to search the brachypodium genomic information via a blastn search. of the ae. tauschii genes on the five scaffolds,  <dig> had obvious orthologs in the brachypodium genome . putative orthologs of the ae. tauschii genes from the four scaffolds were assigned to the  <dig> to 1068 kb region of brachypodium chromosome  <dig>  in addition, three brachypodium paralogs  positioned in the  <dig> to 1143 kb region were orthologous to an ae. tauschii gene, aegta20985; additionally, bradi5g <dig>  at 1186 kb was orthologous to aegta <dig> in scaffold  <dig>  the locations of two ae. tauschii genes, aegta <dig> and aegta <dig>  were  <dig> and  <dig>  cm, respectively, distal to iw <dig> ; therefore, the distal part of iw <dig> showed chromosomal synteny to brachypodium chromosome  <dig>  thus, the iw <dig> chromosomal region on 2ds was generally syntenic to brachypodium chromosome  <dig>  however, putative orthologs of the ae. tauschii genes from scaffold  <dig> were assigned to brachypodium chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  two paralogous ae. tauschii genes, aegta <dig> and aegta <dig>  on scaffold  <dig> were orthologous to three paralogous brachypodium genes  on brachypodium chromosome  <dig>  therefore, the chromosomal synteny between ae. tauschii and brachypodium around the iw <dig> orthologs was complex with regard to chromosome structure.

iw2-linked marker genotypes in ae. tauschii
to determine the genetic associations among the developed markers and glaucousness,  <dig> iw2-linked pcr markers—including five capss, five ssrs, one hrm, one insertion/deletion , and one dominant  marker—were used to genotype the  <dig> ae. tauschii accessions . for eight of the  <dig> markers, the  <dig> accessions exhibited just two apparent alleles; additionally, the set of accessions exhibited just three distinct electrophoresis patterns—including the ku-2154-type, the ku-2126- type, and one other type—at one ssr marker for we <dig>  the other four ssr markers were highly polymorphic among the accessions; specifically, each marker gave rise to more than three distinct electrophoresis patterns.table  <dig>

the numbers of accessions for each genotype are represented in glaucous and non-glaucous phenotypes.

the numbers of non-glaucous-type accessions showing the genotype corresponding to the other one in the glaucous-type accessions are indicated in parenthesis.

*these accessions showed the same genotype different from ku- <dig> and ku- <dig> 


athe values were calculated based on a mixed linear model in the tassel ver.  <dig>  software.



the association analysis showed that four ssr markers , an hrm marker , the dominant marker , an indel marker , and two caps markers , co-localized with iw <dig> in the ae. tauschii linkage map, were significantly  associated with variation in glaucousness; in contrast, the other three genotyped markers were not significantly associated with variation in glaucousness . the caps marker s43829- <dig> was removed from this association analysis because of the low-frequency  allele. in particular, the ku-2126-type allele of the ssr locus s10812- <dig> was found only in  <dig> of the  <dig> glaucous accessions; moreover, none of the  <dig> non-glaucous accessions carried this ku-2126-type allele. the other five glaucous accessions carried a third allele of the s10812- <dig> locus. in  <dig> of the  <dig> non-glaucous accessions, only four carried the third allele of the s10812- <dig> locus, and the other  <dig> accessions carried different s10812- <dig> alleles. of the four exceptional non-glaucous accessions that carried the third s10812- <dig> allele, two were ku- <dig> and ku- <dig>  and these had each been used to generate a synthetic hexaploid wheat line ldn/ku- <dig> and ldn/ku- <dig>  respectively; both synthetic lines showed the glaucous phenotype . however, the phenotype of each synthetic hexaploid line  derived from the remaining two of the exceptional accessions  was non-glaucous. therefore, phenotypic differentiation in glaucousness was almost completely explained by the allelic configuration at the s10812- <dig> locus in these natural populations of ae. tauschii.

the  <dig> iranian wheat landraces showed the ku-2154-type alleles at s43829- <dig>  xctg <dig>  and s51038- <dig>  whereas they exhibited the ku-2126-type alleles at c <dig>  s10812- <dig>  s10812- <dig>  s10812- <dig>  and xctg <dig>  in addition, these landraces exhibited various genotypes that differed from the allelic combinations found in ae. tauschii accessions at we <dig> and four ssr marker loci, s43829- <dig>  s10812- <dig>  s82981- <dig> . at s43829- <dig>   <dig> landraces showed the ku-2126-type genotype, and two exhibited other genotypes.

discussion
natural variation for wax production in ae. tauschii
glaucousness is presumably among the components of the domestication syndrome in tetraploid wheat  <cit> . therefore, glaucousness was apparently a target of artificial selection during tetraploid domestication and common wheat speciation; nevertheless, whether glaucousness is an adaptive trait in wild wheat species remains unclear. cuticular wax on plant surfaces plays an important role in reducing water loss under drought stress conditions for arabidopsis and rice  <cit> , and observations in these other species indicate that relationships between glaucousness and drought stress tolerance are tight. presence of either the iw <dig> or iw <dig> allele greatly reduces ß-diketones in the wax components of plants, resulting in a non-glaucous phenotype  <cit> . comparative study of glaucousness-related genes in near-isogenic lines  of a common wheat cultivar   demonstrates that iw alleles had a negative impact on drought tolerance  <cit> . however, another study of iw <dig> in a nil  of common wheat did not detect an association between iw <dig> genotype and water-use efficiency  <cit> .

in this study, we used a set of  <dig> accessions that represented the entire geographical range of ae. tauschii to examine natural variation in wax production among ae. tauschii, and found  <dig> glaucous accessions that were collected in the area that spans from transcaucasus to the southern-eastern coastal region of the caspian sea . in a previous study of  <dig> ae. tauschii accessions collected from  <dig> different habitats throughout afghanistan, pakistan, and iran,  <dig> glaucous accessions were found in this same area that spans from transcaucasus to the southern-eastern coastal region  <cit> . therefore, our findings were fully consistent with previous observations.

most glaucous accessions belonged to the taul <dig> lineage . taul <dig> accessions derived from geographically wide-spread sites throughout the transcaucasus/middle east region; these sites represented the western habitats of ae. tauschii  <cit> . taul <dig> accessions were collected from sites widely distributed throughout the species range, and most taul <dig> accessions showed a non-glaucous phenotype. notably, one taul <dig> accession , collected in armenia, showed a glaucous phenotype, and the collection site was located in the middle of an area where glaucous taul <dig> accessions were collected . genotyping data suggested that ig <dig> had an iw <dig> chromosomal region that was very similar to the iw <dig> chromosomal region of the glaucous taul <dig> accessions. one possible explanation for this observation is that ig <dig> acquired the iw <dig> chromosomal region from some glaucous individual of the taul <dig> lineage. such introgression could occur in the natural habitat where ig <dig> was originally sampled and in experimental fields where the accession was propagated for several generations. another explanation is that ig <dig> became a wax producer through a de novo recessive mutation at the iw <dig> locus; this scenario, however, is unlikely because the molecular marker genotypes in the iw <dig> chromosomal region of ig <dig> were largely identical to those in the iw <dig> chromosomal region of glaucous taul <dig> accessions .

whether the glaucous phenotype of the exceptional taul <dig> accession was due to introgression of a glaucous allele from a glaucous taul <dig> plant may be difficult to discern. genome-wide marker analyses using snp array and diversity arrays technology  systems indicated that taul <dig> was clearly distinct and genetically differentiated from taul <dig>  <cit> . this high level of differentiation indicates that the two genealogical lineages have been reproductively isolated, and that, under natural conditions, inter-lineage hybridization seems to have occurred only rarely  <cit> . nevertheless, the presence of a glaucous-type taul <dig> accession indicated that the hybridization between taul <dig> and taul <dig> might have occurred, but the number of hybridizations seems to be quite small. further detailed study is required to clarify the past occurrence of the taul1-taul <dig> inter-lineage hybridization in ae. tauschii.

causal loci for variation in glaucousness among ae. tauschii
previous studies show that, in ae. tauschii, the causal gene for the glaucous/non-glaucous phenotypic difference is iw <dig>  and that the genotypes of glaucous and non-glaucous accessions were w2w2iw2iw <dig> and w2w2iw2iw <dig>  respectively  <cit> . the molecular markers tightly linked to iw <dig> were very closely associated with glaucous versus non-glaucous phenotypic difference among the  <dig> accessions of ae. tauschii . thus, the allelic difference at the iw <dig> locus was the main contributor to the phenotypic difference between the glaucous and non-glaucous accessions of ae. tauschii . in common wheat, the markers derived from bradi5g <dig> and bradi5g <dig> are tightly linked to iw <dig> as well as iw <dig>  <cit> . because the loci that control the glaucous versus non-glaucous phenotypic difference in ae. tauschii mapped to the chromosome 2ds region where the common wheat iw <dig> gene resides , the same iw <dig> gene is likely involved in wax production in both ae. tauschii and common wheat. actually, although most ssr markers around the iw <dig> region were highly polymorphic among the ae. tauschii accessions and iranian wheat landraces, three markers co-localized with iw <dig> in ae. tauschii s10812- <dig>  s10812- <dig>  and s10812-13; notably, each showed the ku-2126-type alleles in each of the  <dig> iranian wheat landraces . these results indicated that the iranian wheat landraces, which exhibited the glaucous phenotype, had the iw2iw <dig> genotype.

marker order and gene order around ae. tauschii iw <dig> was well conserved with those on barley chromosome 2hs and brachypodium chromosome  <dig> . similar chromosomal synteny between the iw <dig> region on 2bs and brachypodium chromosome  <dig> was recently reported based on mapping with common wheat populations  <cit> . in ae. tauschii, scaffold information derived from the draft genome data were available for detailed analysis of chromosomal synteny at the iw <dig> region. chromosomal order of the selected scaffolds at iw <dig> revealed the occurrence of a local inversion during divergence between barley and ae. tauschii . moreover, information of predicted genes in the scaffolds showed that putative translocations occurred during divergence between brachypodium and ae. tauschii . these results also indicated that several gaps existed between the ae. tauschii scaffolds. thus, colinearity among barley, brachypodium and ae. tauschii was observed in the iw <dig> syntenic region, as was reported recently  <cit> , but further screening of ae. tauschii bac clones may be required for construction of the complete physical map at iw <dig> 

in the genotyping analysis with iw2-linked markers, non-glaucous accessions with the iw2iw <dig> genotype constituted the majority of all  <dig> accessions . however, four non-glaucous accessions  shared a genotype at s10812- <dig>  with five glaucous accessions , indicating that these four non-glaucous accessions may have the iw2iw <dig> genotype in spite of the s10812- <dig> genotypes. in fact, synthetic hexaploids from hybrids between ldn, which has the glaucous genotype   <cit> , and two of the four non-glaucous accessions, ku- <dig> and ku- <dig>  exhibited the glaucous phenotype . in contrast, the phenotypes of all synthetic hexaploids derived from the ku- <dig> and ku- <dig>  were non-glaucous. accordingly, ku- <dig> and ku- <dig> seemed to have the iw2iw <dig> genotype even though they shared an s10812- <dig> genotype with the five glaucous accessions. taken together, all this evidence indicated that iw <dig> was the major gene that controls inhibition of wax production in ae. tauschii.

as yet, no loss-of-function allele has been reported for w <dig>  a major wax-producing gene in ae. tauschii. in common wheat, however, some cultivars such as chinese spring and salmon carry the recessive w <dig> allele  <cit> . similarly, non-glaucous-type accessions with the w <dig> recessive allele have been discovered among wild emmer wheat  <cit> . whether the recessive loss-of-function mutation occurred at the diploid level  or at the hexaploid level  is not known. further studies are required to clarify the details of the genetic mechanism that underlies the wax production in ae. tauschii.

implication of the iw <dig> variation in hexaploid wheat speciation
based on a comparative genic analysis among common wheat and its ancestral species, tsunewaki  <cit>  suggested that common wheat, which is hexaploid, is the product of a hybrid cross that took place between a glaucous cultivated emmer wheat with the genotype w1w1iw1iw <dig> and a glaucous wild ae. tauschii with the genotype the w2w2iw2iw <dig> genotype in the mountainous region near the southwestern coastal part of the caspian sea. here, we found that, of  <dig> ae. tauschii accessions, only  <dig> had the glaucous phenotype  and that a dominant allele at the iw <dig> locus were responsible for expression of the non-glaucous phenotype . furthermore, we found that, on the basis of the molecular-marker genotypes in the iw <dig> chromosomal region and the phenotypes of the synthetic common wheat lines, virtually all non-glaucous accessions had the iw2iw <dig> genotype . a non-glaucous accession that had the iw2iw <dig> genotype was not found among the  <dig> accessions. this finding was notable because the double recessive w2w2iw2iw <dig> genotype, if present, would have also caused the non-glaucousness phenotype. the reason for the absence of any ae. tauschii accession with the w2w <dig> iw2iw <dig> genotype from this collection was not clear, but this fact may indicate that functional w <dig> alleles confer some adaptive advantage under natural conditions. taken together, the evidence from this study was consistent with the view that glaucous ae. tauschii individuals that had the w2w2iw2iw <dig> genotype were involved in the origin of hexaploid common wheat.

previous evidence based on isozyme variations and dna marker polymorphisms is consistent with the hypothesis that the birthplace of hexaploid wheat is within a broad area ranging from armenia to southwestern caspian iran  <cit> . the geographic range of the parent populations of glaucous ae. tauschii accessions was very consistent with the region postulated in this hypothesis . however, the ae. tauschii subspecies-strangulata has been postulated to be the d-genome donor of common wheat  <cit> . of the  <dig> ae. tauschii accessions that we examined, only  <dig> accessions have markedly moniliform spikes, and each of these were originally collected in the southeastern coastal caspian region  <cit> . taxonomically, these accessions could be classified as ae. tauschii coss. subspecies strangulata  tzvel. our data demonstrated that all these strangulata accessions, which were not glaucous, had the iw2iw <dig> genotype . on the assumption that the ancestral ae. tauschii had the w2w2iw2iw <dig> genotype, this finding may suggest that the southeastern coastal caspian populations of ae. tauschii subspecies strangulata do not represent the direct descendants of the ancestral populations that gave rise to hexaploid common wheat.

CONCLUSIONS
analysis of the iw <dig> locus may contribute to improve our understanding of the evolution of hexaploid wheat. of the  <dig> ae. tauschii accessions, only  <dig> glaucous accessions were found in the area that spans from transcaucasia to the southern coastal region of the caspian sea. of the  <dig> synthetic wheat lines that we examined,  <dig> were glaucous, and each of the  <dig> non-glaucous lines was produced by crossing ldn with a non-glaucous ae. tauschii accession. of the  <dig> glaucous lines,  <dig> were produced by crossing ldn with glaucous ae. tauschii accessions. the remained two accessions seemed to have the iw2iw <dig> genotype according to the genotyping analysis with the iw2-linked markers. therefore, allelic differences at the iw <dig> locus on the short arm of chromosome 2d were the main contributors to the phenotypic difference between the glaucous and non-glaucous accessions of ae. tauschii. some molecular markers, such as s10812- <dig>  closely linked to iw <dig> were significantly associated with variation in glaucousness in ae. tauschii. these results suggest that the d-genome donor of common wheat could have been any ae. tauschii variant that carried the recessive iw <dig> allele.
