BACKGROUND
glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in vertebrate brain. glutamate acts on two different classes of receptors, ionotropic glutamatergic receptors and g-protein-coupled metabotropic receptors. the ionotropic receptors are further classified into α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate , kainate, and n-methyl-d-aspartate  receptors  <cit> . binding of glutamate to nmda receptors  results in an influx of extracellular ca2+ into the cell, which leads to the activation of many ca2+-dependent enzymes such as calpain  <cit> , calcineurin  <cit> , inducible nitric oxide synthase  expression  <cit>  and arachidonic acid  selective cytosolic phospholipase a <dig> <cit> . nmdar are present throughout the brain and predominantly in frontal cortex and hippocampal ca <dig> region  <cit> . activation of nmdar also induces signaling cascades involved in learning and memory, synaptic excitability and plasticity, and neuronal degeneration  <cit> . overactivation of glutamate receptors can result in the death of neurons through a process termed excitotoxicity. excitotoxicity has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, including alzheimer disease  <cit> , huntington disease  <cit> , schizophrenia  <cit> , and bipolar disorder  <cit> . chronic nmda administration to rats reduced nmdar subunits and increased arachidonic acid cascade markers in rat frontal cortex  <cit> . similarly, an altered nmdar subunits  <cit>  and increased arachidonic acid cascade markers have been reported in alzheimers patients <cit> .

glutamate was reported to trigger dna degradation, apoptotic cell death, and increase the bcl-2-associated x protein  to b-cell lymphoma - <dig> ratio in cells in vitro  <cit> . in addition, aa was reported to induce apoptosis in vitro by producing mitochondrial damage  <cit> , activating caspases- <dig> and - <dig>  releasing cytochrome c  <cit> , decreasing expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor   <cit> , and reducing neuronal viability  <cit> . dietary deprivation of n- <dig> polyunsaturated fatty acids  in rats increased aa signaling while decreasing bdnf expression in frontal cortex  <cit> . in contrast, chronic administration of mood stabilizers to rats decreased brain expression of cpla <dig> as well as aa turnover in brain phospholipids  <cit> . mood stabilizers also increased expression of anti-apoptotic bcl- <dig> and bdnf in the rat frontal cortex  <cit> .

we have established an animal model of excessive nmda signaling in rats by administering a subconvulsive dose of nmda for  <dig> days. this model demonstrates upregulated markers of brain aa metabolism, including increased turnover of aa in brain phospholipids and increased expression of aa-selective cpla <dig> and the cpla <dig> gene transcription factor, activator protein - <dig>  <cit> . it also demonstrates increased brain neuroinflammatory markers, consistent with crosstalk between nmdar-mediated excitotoxicity and neuroinflammation  <cit> .

in our present study, we wished to see if chronic nmda administration to rats, as a model of excitotoxicity, also would alter the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors in brain and lead to neuronal death. to the extent that this model represents clinical excitotoxicity, it might be used for drug development and for understanding interactions among different brain processes that lead to cell death. we studied the frontal cortex because we had studied this region previously in this model  <cit> .

methods
animals
the study was conducted following the national institutes of health guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals  and was approved by the animal care and use committee of the "eunice kennedy shriver" national institute of child health and human development. male cdf- <dig> rats weighing 200- <dig> g  were randomly assigned to a control group  that received vehicle  once daily for  <dig> days, or to an nmda group  that received  <dig> mg/kg i.p. nmda  once daily for  <dig> days. this dose does not produce convulsions but can cause paroxysmal eeg activity  <cit>  and an increase in brain aa metabolism in rats  <cit> . three hours after the last saline or nmda injection, rats were anesthetized with co <dig> and then decapitated. the brain was rapidly excised and the frontal cortex dissected, frozen in 2-methylbutane at -50°c, and stored at -80°c until use.

preparation of cytosolic fractions
cytosolic fractions were prepared from frontal cortex as previously described  <cit> . tissue from control or chronic nmda rats was homogenized with a polytron homogenizer in a buffer consisting of  <dig> mm tris-hcl ,  <dig> mm egta,  <dig> mm edta,  <dig>  mm pepstatin,  <dig> mm leupeptin,  <dig>  mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,  <dig>  u/ml aprotinin, and  <dig> mm dithiothreitol. the suspension was centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> min at 4°c. the resulting supernatant was the cytosolic fraction. protein concentrations of cytosolic fractions were determined by using a protein reagent .

the frontal cortex nuclear fraction was prepared from the control and nmda administered rats as previously described  <cit> .

western blot analysis
proteins from cytosolic extracts  were separated on 10-20% sds-polyacrylamide gels  , and then were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane . cytosolic blots were incubated with primary antibodies for bdnf, bcl- <dig>  bcl-2-associated x protein , bcl-2-associated death promoter , and 14-3-3z  . the blots then were incubated with appropriate hrp-conjugated secondary antibodies  and were visualized using a chemiluminescence reaction  on x-ray film . optical densities of immunoblot bands were measured using alpha innotech software  and were normalized to β-actin  to correct for unequal loading. all experiments were carried out twice with up to  <dig> independent samples.

bdnf and phospho-creb protein levels
bdnf and phospho-cyclic adenosine monophosphate  response element binding protein  levels were measured in brain cytosolic and nuclear extracts using an elisa kit according to the manufacturer's instructions . bdnf levels are expressed in pmol/mg protein and phospho-creb levels were expressed as percent of control.

total rna isolation and rt-pcr
total rna was isolated from frontal cortex of control and chronic nmda-administered rats using an rneasy lipid tissue mini kit . expression of bdnf, bcl- <dig>  bax, and bad was determined using specific primers and probes purchased from taqmanr gene expression assays . data were expressed as the level of the target gene mrna in brain from nmda-administered animals normalized to the level of the endogenous control mrna , and relative to values in brains from control saline-injected rats   <cit> . all experiments were carried out in duplicate with six independent samples per group.

fjb staining
brains from control and nmda administered rats  were sectioned coronally  on a cryostat  and then mounted on gelatin-coated glass specimen slides. staining with fjb  was performed as described  <cit> . briefly, the tissue slides were dehydrated in 70% ethanol and then hydrated with distilled water. after hydration, they were immersed in fjb stain for  <dig> min at room temperature, washed with distilled water and dried at 50°c for  <dig> min. the slides were mounted with the cover slip with dpx and examined under a fluorescence microscope.

statistical analysis
data are expressed as means ± sem. statistical significance was calculated using two-tailed, unpaired t-test, with significance set at p <  <dig> .

RESULTS
decreased levels of anti-apoptotic factors
chronic nmda administration for  <dig> days, compared with chronic saline, significantly decreased protein levels of bdnf  , bcl- <dig>  , and phospho-creb   in rat frontal cortex. the decreases in these protein levels were associated with decreases in their mrna levels. thus, chronic nmda significantly decreased mrna levels of bdnf   and of bcl- <dig>  .

increased levels of pro-apoptotic factors
in contrast to the reductions in anti-apoptotic factors, chronic nmda increased protein levels of pro-apoptotic bad   and bax  . mrna levels also were increased for both bad   and bax   by chronic nmda. chronic nmda administration increased the protein level of 14-3-3ζ .

evidence of cell death
chronic nmda administration increased fjb staining, a marker of neuronal loss, in rat frontal cortex .

discussion
chronic daily administration of a non-convulsive dose of nmda to adult male rats significantly decreased frontal cortex protein and mrna levels of the anti-apoptotic factors bdnf and bcl- <dig>  and of their transcription factor, phospho-creb. in contrast, chronic nmda significantly increased frontal cortex protein and mrna levels of bad and bax and of the protein level of 14-3-3ζ, pro-apoptotic factors, as well as fluoro jade-b staining, a marker of neuronal death, in rat frontal cortex. these data can be added to evidence that chronic nmda under the same administration paradigm increased frontal cortex expression of inflammatory markers   <cit> , decreased frontal cortex nmdar - <dig> and nr-3a subunits, and increased activity, phosphorylation, protein, and mrna levels of cpla <dig> but did not change activity or protein levels of secretory spla <dig> or calcium-independent ipla <dig>  <cit> . chronic nmda also increased the dna-binding activity of ap- <dig> and its protein levels of ap- <dig> alpha and beta subunits  <cit> , which are recognized on the promoter region of cpla <dig> gene  <cit>  as well as turnover and other kinetic markers of aa metabolism in frontal cortex of rat brain  <cit> . these changes did not follow administration of a single  <dig> mg/kg i.p. dose of nmda and thus were a consequence of long term activation of nmdars  <cit> . together, they provide a profile of an experimental and probably evolving animal model of excitotoxicity, which might be exploited for future drug development and for understanding interactions of processes of excitotoxicity. there is evidence that excitotoxicity plays a role in a number of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, including alzheimer disease  <cit> , huntington's disease  <cit> , schizophrenia  <cit> , and bipolar disorder  <cit> .

the effects of chronic nmda in rats suggest alterations of multiple signaling cascades such as calpain  <cit> , calcineurin  <cit>  and inos expression  <cit>  but it may be premature to ascribe a change in one to a change in another. nevertheless, increased aa metabolism caused by chronic nmda may be involved in altering the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic factors, leading in turn to the observed neuronal loss. increased aa exposure decreased bdnf protein in spinal cord neurons in vitro  <cit> , induced mitochondrial damage  <cit> , activated caspases- <dig> and - <dig>  released cytochrome c from mitochondria  <cit>  and decreased neuronal viability  <cit> .

expression of bdnf and bcl- <dig> is regulated mainly by creb  <cit> . bdnf and bcl- <dig> play important roles in cell survival and plasticity, and in growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses  <cit> . increased aa signaling may interfere with transcription of neuronal survival factors  <cit> . downregulation of bdnf and bcl- <dig> could occur through a decrease in their transcription factor phospho-creb  <cit> , as was found in this study. bdnf also may regulate bcl- <dig> levels through activation of the map kinase cascade and the downstream phosphorylation of creb protein  <cit> .

bcl- <dig> can be repressed by the ap- <dig> transcription factor  <cit> , resulting in apoptosis. chronic nmda in rats increased the dna-binding activity of ap- <dig> and protein levels of its alpha and beta subunits  <cit> . ap- <dig> also is a transcription factor of the cpla <dig> gene, and its overexpression may lead to upregulated cpla <dig> activity and of aa signaling upon chronic nmda administration  <cit> . thus, increased ap- <dig> binding activity or decreased bdnf caused by chronic nmda may have led to the decreased bcl- <dig> expression in the present study.

consistent with the notion that increased aa signaling reduces bdnf expression, rats deprived of dietary essential n- <dig> pufas for  <dig> weeks demonstrated increased brain aa signaling and reduced mrna and protein levels of phospho-creb and bdnf  <cit> . in relation to this, chronic nmda administration also increased brain cpla <dig> activity, phosphorylation, protein, and mrna levels, as well as aa turnover in brain phospholipids  <cit> .

14-3-3ζ proteins bind the pro-apoptotic protein bad  <cit> . disassociation of 14-3-3ζ from bad causes dephosphorylation of bad by protein phosphatase 2a  <cit> , allowing bad to move from the cytoplasm to mitochondria, where it can displace bax from bcl-xl  <cit>  and promote apoptosis. there also may be a more direct mechanism by which aa induces polymerization of 14-3-3ζ and dissociation from bad  <cit> . the combination of increased expression of 14-3-3ζ and increased aa signaling  <cit>  caused by chronic nmda may have contributed to the neuronal loss, which is suggested by the increased fjb staining. studies also have reported increased protein levels of 14-3-3ζ associated with neurodegenerative disease  <cit> . increased 14-3-3ζ protein levels caused by chronic nmda may be a secondary response to the observed increased bad expression or be due to the increased aa signalling. further studies are needed to understand the direct role of 14-3-3ζ in nmda mediated apoptosis.

CONCLUSIONS
chronic nmda excitotoxicity may be involved in the apoptosis in neurodegenerative diseases, while targeting the excitotoxicity with drugs may be a useful therapeutic approach in these neurodegenerative diseases by way of reducing apoptosis in brain.
