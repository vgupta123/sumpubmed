BACKGROUND
one of the most important transitions in vertebrate evolution was the arising of terrestrial vertebrates, which entailed considerable morphological changes related to the acquisition of novel functions by pre-existing and, in several cases, pre-adapted structures, like the evolution of lobe fins into tetrapod limbs. the terrestrial vertebrates would have derived from fossil forms of lobe-finned fishes, a highly successful group in the devonian , with hundred species populating the gondwana supercontinent’s oceans and river systems  <cit> .

until  <dig> only two sarcopterygian taxa were considered to have survived post-devonian extinction: the dipnoi , with three extant genera, and the tetrapods, with ~ <dig>  species. hence the clamour when the first living coelacanth , a fish considered extinct, was found off the estuary of river chalumna, in south africa  <cit> . in  <dig> a specimen of another latimeria population was identified by mark v. erdmann in a fish market in manado tua   <cit> . the distance between the two sites  and the early molecular findings  <cit>  led to the identification of the latter specimen as belonging to a distinct species, called l. menadoensis. several individuals of l. chalumnae have been fished to date, as opposed to only six individuals of l. menadoensis. specimens of indonesian coelacanth are therefore very rare and constitute a valuable scientific resource and a mine of precious genetic information.

the main molecular and morphological studies of the genus latimeria have addressed the evolutionary relationships linking lungfishes, coelacanths and tetrapods. their results have however been discordant, since different datasets have sustained different hypotheses  <cit> . l. menadoensis has also been the subject of other molecular investigations aimed at characterizing some genes of evolutionary interest: hox genes  <cit> , parahox genes  <cit> , the protocadherine cluster  <cit> , the rag <dig> and rag <dig> genes  <cit> , sonic hedgehog gene and its enhancers  <cit> , visual pigments  <cit> , a heat shock protein  <dig> <cit> , neurohypophysial hormones  <cit> , and vitellogenins  <cit> . furthermore some transposable elements  were characterized in this species  <cit> . the importance of l. menadoensis has led to the study of its whole mitochondrial genome  <cit>  as well as to partial sequencing of a bac library, which has made ~5 mb of genomic sequences available to databases  <cit> . furthermore, correlations between quantitative and compositional characteristics of the genome of l. menadoensis were considered in makapedua et al.  <cit> .

over the last few years next generation sequencing technologies  have revolutionized the fields of genomics and transcriptomics, providing the opportunity to analyze genomes and transcriptomes with high sequencing depth in a relatively short time in comparison with sanger sequencing. the molecular data obtained with such technologies, applied to a rising number of organisms, are proving steadily important to study their relationships at the macro- and micro-evolutionary levels. in this respect, having in mind that genes are targets of evolution-driven changes that lead to the different morphology of animals, in the framework of studies of genomic features of coelacanths  <cit> , we examined the l. menadoensis transcriptomes of liver and testis using deep-sequencing techniques.

the liver is one of the most suitable tissues in that it participates more than other organs in a range of physiological processes and contains cell types endowed with distinct roles and functions. considering the different sex determination mechanisms occurring across vertebrates, the expression in testis is interesting to better understand the genes involved in these processes and their evolution since the systematic position of latimeria. furthermore, this tissue proved to be particularly suitable and useful for deep rna-seq, as it expresses a broad range of different transcripts, permitting the assembly of a high number of full length sequences. in fact, about a half of the sequences included in the high quality set of  <dig>  contigs was estimated to have been correctly assembled to the full length.

the de novo transcriptome assembly was able to significantly enhance the global view of the sequences expressed in coelacanth, overcoming the limitations linked to the automated and conservative, protein coding gene-focused, prediction by ensembl, and providing a remarkable amount of information concerning expressed sequences produced by non-annotated genes. this knowledge provided significant information not only to investigate important biological processes and metabolic pathways in latimeria, but also to acquire information on the origin of tetrapods and on the possible evolutionary dynamics relative to the genes involved in the transition from aquatic to terrestrial vertebrates.

RESULTS
latimeria menadoensis transcriptome sequencing
the illumina sequencing procedure generated  <dig> , <dig> raw nucleotide paired-end reads . the average read length for liver was  <dig>  bp, corresponding to a complete dataset of  <dig>  gb of sequence data, while the deep rna-seq of testis produced reads slightly shorter, with an average length of  <dig>  bp, accounting to  <dig>  gb of sequence data. following the processing steps involving the trimming of adapters and low quality bases, and the removal of short reads and of reads originated by ribosomal rna, the two sequence sets were significantly reduced to  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> high quality sequencing reads from liver and testis, respectively. therefore a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads were used for the de novo assembly. a summary of the trimming step statistics is reported in table  <dig>  a detailed report of quality and statistics for the reads used for the de novo transcriptome assembly is presented in additional file  <dig> 

de novo assembly
the de novo transcriptome assembly performed with trinity  <cit>  by using both liver and testis reads generated a total of  <dig>  contigs. the filtering step used to select only the longest transcript per gene produced  <dig>  contigs, and the additional step applied to remove redundant sequences by mira  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  and to filter sequences shorter than 250 bp further reduced the trinity assembly to a set of  <dig>  transcripts. the de novo assembly produced with the clc genomic workbench  <dig> . <dig>  generated  <dig>  raw contigs. the high quality subset of protein-coding sequences selected to integrate the trinity assembly, as described in the methods section, comprised  <dig>  sequences. a total of  <dig>  clc contigs were detected by blastn as matching existing trinity contigs and significantly longer than them. the corresponding trinity contigs were therefore replaced. the remaining  <dig>  clc contigs were discarded, as they could not significantly improve the trinity assembly.

a total of  <dig>  contigs was obtained following the combination of the data generated by the two de novo assemblers. finally, the filtering step applied to remove poorly covered sequences, resulting from the fragmentation of transcripts expressed at particularly low levels, reduced the contig number to a final high quality set of  <dig>  sequences. a detailed graphical summary of the strategy used and of the results obtained by the de novo assembly of l. menadoensis transcriptome is shown in figure  <dig> 

assembly quality assessment
the goal of these assembly processing steps was to reduce redundancy without losing any valuable sequence data . despite making use of a large fraction of the original sequencing reads , the raw trinity assembly was largely redundant, as the mapping of the reads on the assembled contigs revealed 75% of non-specific matches. on the contrary the raw clc assembly showed virtually no redundancy  but only 33% of sequenced fragments were used to produce the assembly. the sequence redundancy was drastically reduced to  <dig> % after the removal of trinity redundant contigs by mira with no loss of sequence data, as the total number of reads mapped on the updated assembly slightly increased  due to the elongation of  <dig>  trinity contigs by clc. although a large portion of contigs with low expression was discarded , this did not significantly affect the total number of mapped reads  and contributed to a further reduction of sequence redundancy . the comparison between sequence length categories based on average coverage, before and after the contig filtering step , revealed that this procedure was able to sensibly reduce the amount of short sequences, especially those shorter than 500 bp, moving the distribution of contig length towards longer and more reliable sequences.

transcript fragmentation was assessed with the ortholog hit ratio method  <cit> , which relies on the comparison between the observed length of contigs and the full length of known ortholog sequences of other species, detected by blastx. this method is strongly influenced by inter-species divergence and by the different substitution rates observed among genes and can often lead to an under-estimation of transcript integrity  <cit> . to overcome this imperfection of the method we applied a correction considering in the analysis only highly conserved genes . by these means, a sufficiently large set of sequences was analyzed , permitting to obtain a reliable estimate of fragmentation within the high quality liver and testis transcripts. the comparison with ortholog sequences revealed that about a half of the contigs were assembled to their full length . the mean and median ratios resulted to be  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. approximately a quarter of the high quality transcript set is expected to be composed by highly fragmented contigs .

the average length of the contigs obtained, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp, was  <dig>  bp. the n <dig> statistic of the assembly  was  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs longer than  <dig> kb were obtained . a summary of the final assembly statistics is shown in table  <dig> 

transcript annotation
the annotation performed with blastx to the ncbi non-redundant  protein database revealed that  <dig>  of the assembled contigs  had at least one positive hit.  <dig>  contigs did not give any blast hit by the cutoff of 1x10- <dig>  the blast top hit species distribution is shown in figure  <dig>  the blast2go annotation, directly performed on the high quality set of transcripts translated into the six possible reading frames, revealed  <dig>  out of  <dig>  total sequences bearing at least one interpro domain, accounting for  <dig> % of annotated transcripts. the list of the  <dig> most abundant interpro domains is displayed in table  <dig>  with ipr <dig>  being the most represented one, with  <dig>  annotated transcripts, followed by ipr <dig>  and ipr <dig> . the assembled sequences were also annotated with gene ontology  terms as described in the materials and methods section, according to the three major go categories: cell component, molecular function, and biological process. a total of  <dig>  transcripts  were associated with at least one go term; concerning the second level of ontology,  <dig>  were assigned to a cell component category,  <dig>  to a molecular function category, and  <dig>  to a biological process category. the summary of gene ontology mappings is reported in additional file 1: figure s1f. concerning the cellular localization, the majority of annotated transcripts was assigned to cell , followed by organelle  and macromolecular complex . the largely predominant molecular functions resulted to be binding  and catalytic activity . finally, concerning biological processes, cellular process  and metabolic process  were the two go terms most represented.

tes in the coelacanth transcriptome
the analysis carried out with repeatmasker  to identify transcribed repetitive elements of l. menadoensis revealed that  <dig> % of the assembled contigs harbored at least one repeat and that  <dig> % of sequenced bases matched to a repeatmasker entry. the major part of matching contigs harbored a transposable element : sines , lines , ltr retrotransposon families , and dna transposons . the types of repetitive elements less represented were small rnas such as trnas, srprnas, snrnas, and 7sk rnas , and unknown and satellite elements  . furthermore the interpro domain analysis on the  <dig>  high quality contigs allowed to identify  <dig> transcripts containing the ipr <dig> domain ,  <dig> contigs with ipr <dig> domain , and  <dig> sequences harboring ipr <dig> domain .

rna-seq mapping on the african coelacanth genome
globally, the  <dig> % of the trimmed sequencing reads of liver and testis rna could map to the genes annotated of l. chalumnae. ninety three percent of the counted fragments mapped within exons , whereas just  <dig> % of the counted fragments mapped within introns . the observed redundancy was very low, highlighted by a match specificity of  <dig> % and  <dig>  out of the  <dig>  annotated gene models were found to have a positive mapping, meaning that the  <dig> % of the coelacanth predicted genes were expressed in liver or in testis. a larger proportion of reads could map to the full assembled genome , revealing that  <dig> % of the reads account for the expression of genes which are still not annotated. overall,  <dig> , <dig> reads  could not be mapped to the l. chalumnae genomic scaffolds. the summary of the rna-seq data mapping on the african coelacanth genome is presented in table  <dig> 

rna-seq mapping on l. menadoensis transcriptome
the rna-seq mapping performed to calculate the expression levels of the assembled transcripts in both analyzed organs mapped the majority of paired-end reads . in fact, the percentage of counted fragments was  <dig> % in liver and slightly lower in testis,  <dig> %, whereas the fraction of mapping reads was very similar in the two organs, being  <dig> % in liver and  <dig> % in testis, indicating that slightly more than 20% of reads could not be mapped to the final set of assembled contigs. furthermore, it was possible to estimate the number of fragments which were not used at all by the assembly procedure, by comparing the number of paired-end reads mapping in broken pairs with the number of uncounted fragments. only about  <dig> % out of the total number of fragments produced by sequencing did not show any mapping, neither as intact nor as broken pairs .

the rna-seq mapping revealed that a higher number of transcripts were expressed in testis in respect to liver, since the expression of  <dig>  contigs  was found in liver, whereas the expression of  <dig>  sequences  was detected in testis. the comparison between the two organs highlighted that  <dig>  contigs  were expressed in both. nevertheless, the two transcriptomes resulted to be remarkably divergent when comparing expression levels, which for most genes were largely divergent as shown by the expression scatter plot in figure  <dig>  the list of the  <dig> most expressed transcripts in liver and testis is reported in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. with a few exceptions  the  <dig> genes characterizing the two tissues show great differences in expression.

the transcriptome richness was further graphically inspected in figure  <dig> comparing l. menadoensis liver and testis transcriptomes to the rna-seq of l. chalumnae muscle. a steep curve, that reaches quickly the asymptote , means that a low number of genes are expressed at high levels in a specific tissue. on the contrary, the later the curve approaches the asymptote, the more genes are expressed, indicating higher transcriptome richness. among the  <dig> tissues, muscle is the one characterized by the steepest curve, as the 50% of the total gene expression in this organ is given by just  <dig> genes, consistently with observations previously collected in other organisms  <cit> . the two tissues used for the deep rna-seq of l. menadoensis were both richer than muscle, although testis resulted to be, by far, the one expressing a broader range of transcripts. in this tissue  <dig> genes contributed to 50% of gene expression, while in liver the same number of genes accounted for about 65%. the  <dig>  most expressed genes in liver and muscle contributed to about 75% of total transcription, whereas the same number of genes in testis just contributed to 61%.

the overlap between liver, testis and muscle transcriptomes was further investigated by analyzing how many common genes were found among the  <dig>  most expressed in each tissue. a schematic representation of transcriptomes overlap is given in the venn diagram in figure  <dig>   <dig> sequences, likely representing housekeeping genes, whose expression at rather elevated levels is important in all tissues, were found in all the  <dig> sets. in all the three organs analyzed, about 2/ <dig> of the transcripts were identified as tissue specific, highlighting once again the strong link between the biological function of different tissues and gene expression.

discussion
de novo transcriptome assembly
the advent of ngs technologies has had an outstanding impact on many fields of biology, including genetics  <cit> , functional and comparative genomics  <cit>  and molecular ecology  <cit> . the remarkable potential range of application of these techniques will likely move the focus of high throughput sequencing in the near future from genome and transcriptome sequencing to the use in clinical medicine and diagnostics  <cit> . due to its potential application to deep rna-seq, ngs has been praised as a cost-effective and revolutionary tool for transcriptomics since the very early stages of its development  <cit> . although great technical advances have been made in a relatively short lapse of time in the improvement of both sequencing technologies and sequencing data management, significant challenges linked with rna-seq still remain unsolved. the major computational issues in the management of ngs data is represented by the reliable de novo assembly of transcriptomes  <cit> . this is a complex task, due to presence of alternatively spliced transcript variants, gene duplications, allelic polymorphisms and noise due to suboptimal sequence quality, which often leads to the generation of a high number of short and poorly assembled contigs  <cit> .

the massive amount of sequencing reads obtained from l. menadoensis liver and testis allowed us to apply stringent filtering criteria, both in the processing of raw sequencing reads and in the filtering of assembled contigs, in order to achieve a final set of high quality transcripts and to overcome the most common pitfalls of ngs assemblies. we chose to use the trinity assembler, able to efficiently recover full length transcripts across a broad range of expression levels but somewhat redundant because of the inclusion of alternatively spliced variants  <cit> . the trinity assembly was used as a reference sequence set to be appropriately refined and enriched, whenever possible, by a second de novo assembly performed with the assembler included in the clc genomic workbench. the choice of integrating the trinity output with the clc assembly was made because of the empirical observation of a more effective reconstruction of full length transcripts and because of the operational speed of its assembly algorithm, based on de bruijn graph. as this method, although extremely fast, is known to produce assemblies which are quite fragmented in comparison with other assemblers  <cit> , only a selected set of assembled contigs was used to improve the trinity assembly, with a particular emphasis on protein-coding transcripts.

de novo assembly quality assessment
one of the problems most commonly arising from the de novo assembly of rna-seq data is represented by sequence fragmentation  <cit> . in order to minimize this problem, as described in the methods section, all the contigs with an average coverage lower than  <dig> were removed prior to further analysis, reducing the number of contigs from  <dig>  to a final set of  <dig>  high quality sequences, reducing the fraction of short sequences with a proportional enrichment in longer transcripts . furthermore, the contig processing strategy we used, graphically summarized in figure  <dig>  contributed to significantly reduce the sequence redundancy of the assembly , in respect with the trinity output . although several factors can negatively influence the outcome of a de novo transcriptome assembly, affecting the reconstruction of full length sequences, the ortholog hit ratio analysis highlighted good mean and median ratio values and a high proportion of transcripts assembled to their full length . therefore, despite the inevitable presence of broken transcripts, the results of the de novo assembly were extremely satisfying, highlighting that about half of the sequences, contained in the final set of transcripts, was assembled to the full length or very close to it and that just about a quarter of the contigs were resulting from highly fragmented transcripts.

transcript annotation
the analysis of the top hit species distribution resulting from blast  reveals gallus gallus as the first species, followed by xenopus tropicalis. the first teleost fish of the list, danio rerio, ranked at the sixth place of the list, after the mammal monodelphis domestica. these results are clearly biased towards organisms whose genome has been largely and deeply studied and annotated, mainly because of the higher quality of genome assemblies, of the more accurate gene predictions and of the higher number of protein sequences deposited in public sequence databases. nevertheless, the absence of a prominent species with extended sequence homologies to l. menadoensis, neither in fishes nor in tetrapods, is consistent with the phylogenetic placement of lobe-finned fishes. however, for an in-depth analysis of the phylogenetic relationship between coelacanth and these two major vertebrate groups, and for an extended discussion on the implications on tetrapod evolution we refer to the whole-genome scale analysis reported by amemiya and colleagues  <cit> .

compared to those having a positive blast result, a higher number of contigs  were annotated by interproscan. since the presence of interpro domains is a strong indication of coding sequences, these data point out that  <dig> % of the coelacanth de novo assembled contigs are coding for proteins characterized by known interpro domains.

divergence between the two coelacanth species
the evolutionary divergence between the two species of coelacanth has been a subject of debate for a long time. although the complete sequencing of mitochondrial dna highlighted a sequence identity of 96%, variable divergence times have been proposed, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> mya  <cit> . the sequencing of the genome of l. chalumnae permitted to extend the comparison to large genomic regions with the available bacs of l. menadoensis, evidencing an identity of  <dig> %. our transcriptomic data offered the opportunity to assess the sequence identity within the coding regions, which resulted to be surprisingly high, standing at  <dig> % . nevertheless, while the massive amount of information gathered permits a rather easy calculation of divergence rates, the estimate of divergence time is not such a trivial task, given the uncertainties related to the calibration of a molecular clock  <cit> : the slow generation time, the absence of other closely related living species, and the allegedly low rate of molecular evolution of coelacanths.

although both the genic and genomic divergence between the two species are similar to those observed between human and chimp  <cit> , which diverged 6– <dig> mya, we also performed a phylogenomic comparison between coelacanths and t. rubripes/t. nigroviridis, two organisms with a completely sequenced genome, which evolved in an aquatic environment and were subject to somewhat similar selective pressure and whose divergence, based on paleontological evidence, is estimated between  <dig>  and  <dig> mya  <cit> . based on the alignment of approximately  <dig> kb of ortholog transcribed sequences in latimeria, we estimated the substitution rate to be  <dig> /100 bp, whereas the substitution rate in the same set of selected genes in the takifugu/tetraodon pair was approximately  <dig> times higher . a simple molecular clock correlation would indicate that the dating of divergence between african and indonesian coelacanth should be placed between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mya. nevertheless the slower rate of molecular evolution, as well as the considerably longer generation time have to be taken into account, likely moving the divergence time much back in time to a date close to the lower end of the estimates based on mitochondrial dna.

tes discussion
in metazoans repeat elements cover a considerable part of genomes. moreover, the transcriptome analysis allowed the evaluation of the transcriptional activity of transposable elements  which play a key role in gene evolution and genome plasticity. tes are divided in two classes: class i is composed of long terminal repeat retrotransposons  and non-ltrs ; class ii is composed of dna transposons.

the repeatmasker analysis revealed that  <dig> % of contigs harbored a repeat and the most represented elements belong to sine families. the latter result is in line with the studies performed in the indonesian coelacanth genome  <cit> , in which the activity of sine elements in latimeria was inferred. the identification of lf-sines and deusines in l. menadoensis transcriptome might confirm that these elements are actually active. moreover, since their conservation in higher vertebrates, this movement might predate the common ancestor of crossopterygians, for more than  <dig> myr. on the other hand the occurrence of complete sines in contigs bearing protein-coding sequence might reveal the gain of new functional roles   <cit> , as previously described in tetrapod genomes.

concerning the activity of lines, the second most represented interspersed elements, the interproscan analysis identified amino acidic domains linked to these autonomous retrotransposons. chicken repeat  <dig>  elements are the most abundant among lines. in contrast to the g. gallus genome where these elements are predominant but, with very few exceptions, nonfunctional  <cit> , in latimeria they seem to be active. fragmented ltrs and ervs  were identified in the transcriptome. this result is in agreement with the analyses on foamy-like retroviral elements recently discovered in l. chalumnae genome by han and worobey  <cit>  showing many frame-shifts and stop codons. the abundance of the harbinger dna transposons in l. menadoensis genome  <cit>  suggests that class ii elements represent a remarkable fraction of the coelacanth tes, however our analysis indicates that few dna elements are expressed. this discordance may be related to the lack of coelacanth specific sequences belonging to this class in the rm database or to their propagation mode. the identification of mobile elements in transcriptomes sheds light on an unexpected genome dynamicity in an organism considered to be a living fossil even from a molecular point of view  <cit> .

rna-seq mapping on the african coelacanth genome
more than half of the sequence data generated by the rna-seq of l. menadoensis liver and testis mapped on the genes annotated by ensembl on the l. chalumnae genome , revealing an overall good annotation of the african coelacanth transcripts, even though in some cases the rna-seq data produced in this study could provide some evidence of additional exons and alternative splicing, given that the  <dig> % of the reads corresponded to regions annotated as introns.

nevertheless, a rather high proportion of reads, close to 40%, could not be mapped on the genes annotated by ensembl, consistently with the strategy adopted by ensembl for the annotation pipeline, which is automated and mainly focused on protein-coding gene models. in fact, almost the 35% of the sequencing reads could map on the assembled genomic scaffolds outside from the annotated gene boundaries, revealing that a relevant portion of the transcripts expressed in the indonesian coelacanth liver and testis might correspond to genes which were not annotated by the ensembl rna-seq annotation pipeline . therefore, the deep rna-seq of liver and testis can be considered as a fundamental tool for the discovery of novel genes, and in particular, of many not yet annotated non-coding transcripts. as a matter of fact, the ngs sequence data will certainly provide a fundamental source of information for the study of atypical transcripts originated by trans- and circular splicing events, a topic which is currently under investigation .

slightly more than  <dig> million reads did not map on the genomic scaffolds. these sequence data could either correspond to mitochondrial rna  or to coding genes harbored in l. chalumnae genomic regions which were not successfully assembled.

liver and testis transcriptomes comparison
the expression profile of the two organs analyzed was expected to be quite different, considering the largely different tasks they perform and the highly specialized cellular types involved. this difference was immediately evident by the graphical representation of the expression scatter plot . among the  <dig> most expressed transcripts in liver, a large fraction is constituted by plasma proteins, whose synthesis is carried out by this organ  and which constitute the core of the highly expressed genes in this tissue . on the other hand testis invests a significant portion of transcription in genes involved in chromatin and cytoskeletal rearrangements. in particular, a testis-specific histone results to be expressed almost  <dig> times more than the second most expressed gene, prostaglandin h2d-isomerase, and accounts for about 18% of the global testis transcription. a significant amount of the total gene expression is derived from the synthesis of messengers of protamines, used for the replacement of histones and the effective packaging of dna in the sperm acrosome  <cit> . the expression of genes involved in chromatin rearrangement is strictly regulated, as testis-specific histones are transiently and selectively expressed only during specific phases of spermiogenesis  <cit> . in fact, also sperm nuclear basic protein pl-i and histone h1x-like figure among the most representative testis genes. furthermore a relevant number of other testis-specific genes can be linked to the meiotic process carried out in the testicular germinal cells and to the cytoskeletal rearrangements consequently required . moreover, specific types of microtubules are required for the correct assembly of mitotic and meiotic spindles and of the flagellum axoneme of spermatozoa  <cit> . the tubulin genes highly expressed in testis are likely linked to these functions.

although the expression of a large fraction of genes was clearly strictly tissue-specific, thanks to the sequencing depth applied, a relevant overlap between the two transcriptomes  was observed. the issue of transcriptome richness was addressed by analyzing the relative contributions of the expression of each contig to the total observed transcription in the two tissues, and in rna-seq data of l. chalumnae muscle . highly specialized tissues are expected to invest the most gene expression in a selected set of genes, thus being transcriptionally poor, whereas tissues involved in many different biological functions, characterized by the coexistence of many different cell types are expected to be transcriptionally rich, as they express a broader range of transcripts. within this picture, muscle is a classic example of a highly specialized tissue, expressing at particularly high levels a limited set of genes involved in the structural organization of muscle fibers and responsible of contraction. testis expresses a broader range of transcripts, which is in agreement with the assumption that cells in this organ are characterized by drastic morphological and functional changes linked to gamete generation: in this scenario chromatin structure is constantly rearranged and gene expression may therefore be substantially variable during the different stages of spermatogenesis  <cit> . despite being transcriptionally poorer than testis, the rna-seq of liver likely brought a remarkable amount of additional data as pointed out by the extent of the overlap between the two transcriptomes . therefore, although the rna-seq of two different organs like testis and liver was particularly effective to approach the coverage of a complete transcriptome, the incomplete overlap observed between the two l. menadoensis transcriptomes and the l. chalumnae muscle suggests that the sequencing of rnas obtained from additional samples would be useful in order to effectively describe the complete transcriptome of this organism.

CONCLUSIONS
the de novo assembly of the indonesian coelacanth l. menadoensis liver and testis transcriptomes here described contains complete information concerning the expressed sequences involved in the important biological processes held by liver and testis tissues, such as metabolism and reproduction  <cit> . furthermore, thanks to the high sequencing depth applied and to the broad range of transcripts expressed, the assembly also contains a great amount of sequence data originated from genes which are not directly linked to liver and testis, permitting to obtain a good overview of the overall coelacanth transcriptome.

in addition, the rna-seq data generated in the present work provided a valuable resource for the ensembl annotation of the recently sequenced genome of the african coelacanth l. chalumnae. in fact, the paired-end sequence data from liver and testis were processed through the ensembl rna-seq pipeline, generating  <dig>  high confidence gene models, which permitted to improve the genome annotation by the addition of  <dig> new genes and  <dig>  related transcripts  <cit> . this was a considerable improvement with respect to the previous annotation, based both on sequence similarity and on the data provided by the rna-seq of l. chalumnae muscle, a tissue transcriptionally poor if compared with liver and testis.

overall, the rna-seq data here described represent a valuable source of information for the improvement of the genetic and genomic studies of coelacanths, including the analysis of te activity, the occurrence of atypical splice events and the divergence between the african and indonesian congeners. the importance of the obtained results mainly regards the origin of terrestrial vertebrates since the key position of latimeria as the unique extant representative of the lineage from which tetrapods should have arisen. the transcriptome data indicate a higher affinity of this species to several terrestrial vertebrates, even if only in few species the genome and transcriptome have been exhaustively analyzed. therefore, the de novo transcriptome assembly, for the quality of information it generated, may certainly be considered a step ahead in helping to understand the biology of this living fossil.
