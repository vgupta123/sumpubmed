BACKGROUND
the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic  neurons in the substantia nigra  is a well-known characteristic of parkinson's disease . in vivo and in vitro models of pd induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl- <dig> , <dig> -tetrahydropyridine , 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium  or 6-hydroxydopamine  reveal that apoptosis is the principal mechanism underlying neuronal death  <cit> .

the akt/glycogen synthase kinase -3β/caspase- <dig> signaling pathways are among the essential components regulating apoptosis  <cit> . recently, transduction of da neurons with myristoylated akt , a constitutively active form of akt prevents 6-ohda-induced cellular and functional damage of da neurons  <cit> , moreover, increased phospho-akt levels in lingo- <dig> knockout mice provide potent protection of da neurons in 6-ohda- or n-methyl-4-phenyl- <dig> , <dig> -tetrahydropyridine neurotoxicity  <cit> . several lines of evidence indicate that gsk-3β mediates da neuronal death in pd animal models produced by mptp  <cit>  or 6-ohda  <cit> . in addition, tau, a well-known substrate for gsk-3β  <cit> , mediates da neuronal death in mptp-treated mice  <cit> . significantly, a number of studies show that caspase- <dig> contributes to cell death of da neurons in human pd postmortem brain tissue, animal models of pd, primary cultures of rat mesencephalon, and sn-derived da cell lines  <cit> .

gangliosides, sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids that exist in mammalian cell membranes, are particularly enriched in neuronal membranes  <cit> . a variety of neurodegenerative disorders are associated with increased ganglioside levels in cerebrospinal fluid   <cit> . furthermore, gangliosides localized to neurofibrillary tangles  in brain tissue of alzheimer's disease  patients and betz cells of precentral gyrus in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients  <cit> . these findings support the possibility that under pathological conditions, gangliosides serve as cytotoxic factors in the central nervous system .

trisialoganglioside, gt1b, one of the major brain ganglioside  <cit> , possibly acts as an endogenous regulator in the brain. gt1b induces apoptosis in non-neuronal cells, such as thymocytes  <cit>  and keratinocytes  <cit> . moreover, neurotoxic activity of gt1b against da neurons has been reported in the sn in vivo  <cit>  and mesencephalic cultures  <cit> . however, the mechanisms underlying gt1b-induced da neuronal death are not clarified.

in this study, we demonstrate for the first time that gt1b neurotoxicity is accompanied by inactivation of akt, activation of gsk-3β and increase in tau phosphorylation in mesencephalic da neurons, both in vivo and in vitro. our data further confirm that caspase- <dig> is not a major effector of da neuronal death in gt1b neurotoxicity.

RESULTS
characterization of gt1b-induced neurotoxicity in neuron-enriched mesencephalic cultures
consistent with our previous findings  <cit> , 10- <dig> mg/ml gt1b significantly attenuated the number of th-ip neurons by 26-68% and the levels of  da uptake by 31-60% in a dose-dependent manner . to selectivity, additional immunostaining was performed with a neun antibody for general neurons and gaba antibody for gabaergic neurons . treatment with  <dig> mg/ml gt1b significantly reduced the number of neun-ip neurons by 50%, gaba-ip neurons by 54% and th-ip neurons by 50%, compared with non-treated control cultures.

several morphological and biochemical assays were conducted to further ascertain the mode of cell death and association with caspases. as shown in figure 2a-d, dna fragmentation in mesencephalic cultures was confirmed with the tunel reaction. the tunel-positive  cell population was increased in gt1b-treated cultures , compared with non-treated control cultures . hoechst  <dig> nuclear staining clearly disclosed condensation and fragmentation of nuclei in gt1b-treated  but not control cultures . the percentage of tunel  cells ranged from 15% to 41%, as determined from the ratio of tunel  cells to hoechst  <dig>  total neuronal cells at the indicated time-points .

to discriminate between da and non-da neurons, mesencephalic cultures were immunostained with a th antibody specific for da neurons and electron micrographs obtained. in control cultures, both da  and non-da neurons  contained intact nuclei with well-preserved cell membranes. in contrast, fragmented nuclei were clearly visible in both da  and non-da neurons  with a fairly intact cell membrane in gt1b-treated cultures.

gt1b neurotoxicity is independent of caspase-3
accumulating evidence supports the theory that nuclear dna fragmentation results from activation of caspase- <dig>  which plays a pivotal role in da neuronal death  <cit> . accordingly, to determine whether caspase- <dig> is involved in gt1b-induced neurotoxicity, cultures were treated with  <dig> mg/ml gt1b, and caspase- <dig> activity assessed in cell extracts by monitoring cleavage of its fluorogenic substrate, devd-afc, at indicated time-points. in gt1b-treated cultures, caspase- <dig> activity was approximately  <dig> and 4-fold higher than that in control cultures at  <dig> h and  <dig> h, respectively .

next we examined whether caspase inhibitors block gt1b neurotoxicity. cultures were treated with a caspase-3-specific inhibitor, devd, or a non-specific caspase inhibitor, z-vad, together with or without gt1b. surprisingly, neither devd nor z-vad rescued gt1b-induced da neurotoxicity, as evident from th-ip neuron counts and level of dopamine uptake , although the caspase-3-specific inhibitor  significantly attenuated caspase- <dig> activity . z-vad or deve only as controls had no effects . however, devd inhibits not only caspase- <dig> but also caspase- <dig> and - <dig>  thus additional experiments were performed using more specific caspase- <dig> inhibitor, z-dqmd-fmk  <cit> . similar to deve, z-dqmd-fmk was unable to prevent gt1b neurotoxicity as evidence by th immunocytochemistry .

gt1b promotes inactivation of akt and subsequent activation of gsk-3β
the akt signaling pathway is essential for the survival of various cell types  <cit> , including da neurons  <cit> . specific pd-related pathological challenges by dephosphorylation/inactivation of akt and dephosphorylation/activation of its downstream substrate, gsk-3β may be associated with mpp+- or 6-ohda-induced neurotoxicity  <cit> . to examine the involvement of akt in gt1b neurotoxicity, cultures were treated with  <dig> mg/ml gt1b, and western blotting analysis performed using phospho-akt  or phospho-akt  antibody at the indicated time-points. decrease in akt phosphorylation at both ser <dig> and thr <dig> was detected as early as  <dig> h, and sustained up to  <dig> h in gt1b-treated cultures . additionally, akt kinase activity was measured by assessing phosphorylation of its substrate, gsk-3α/β fusion protein by immunoprecipitated akt. akt kinase activity, quantified and expressed as a percentage of phosphorylated gsk-3α/β to total akt, was inhibited by 56% as early as  <dig> h after the application of  <dig> μg/ml gt1b, compared to control cultures  . gt1b  significantly attenuated akt kinase activity  at  <dig> h post-treatment, compared with non-treated control cultures .

gsk-3β is a major substrate of akt. physiologically, activated akt inhibits gsk-3β activity by enhancing phosphorylation at ser <dig>  consequently promoting cell survival  <cit> . accordingly, we hypothesize that the decrease in phospho-akt, in turn, reduces gsk-3β phosphorylation, leading to its activation and eventual cell death. to examine this theory, western blotting analysis was performed using a phospho-gsk-3β  antibody. as shown in figure 5a, gsk-3β phosphorylation was decreased by 12-41% at specific time-points, compared with control cultures  .

to assess whether suppression of gsk-3β activity blocks gt1b neurotoxicity, cultures were treated with the gsk-3β-specific inhibitor, l803-mt   <cit> , together with gt1b for  <dig> h. l803-mt rescued th-ip neuron death by 53% in relation to gt1b-treated cultures . however, l803-mt alone had no effect .

gt1b induces tau hyperphosphorylation through gsk-3β activation
tau is phosphorylated by gsk-3β activated as a result of akt inactivation  <cit> . earlier studies show that hyperphosphorylation of tau inhibits its binding to microtubules, resulting in neuronal cell death  <cit> . accordingly, we examined whether gt1b enhances tau phosphorylation. cultures were treated with vehicle as controls  or  <dig> ug/ml gt1b for  <dig> h  and double-immnuostained with the at <dig> antibody for phospho-tau  and th antibody for da neurons . the results revealed that following gt1b treatment, at8-ip-phosphorylated tau was localized within both th-ip  and non-th-ip neurons  with strongly stained soma and processes , compared to control . consistent with our previous results  <cit> , intranigral injection of gt1b induced degeneration of th-ip neurons in the ipsilateral sn , compared with the contralateral side  at  <dig> h post-treatment. additional double immunostaining using sn tissues revealed that phosphorylated tau  and th-ip neurons  co-localize in gt1b-injected sn . few at8-ip neurons were visible in pbs injected sn as controls .

additional western blot analyses disclosed that  <dig> μg/ml gt1b significantly upregulated tau phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner . to assess whether suppression of gsk-3β activity affects the tau hyperphosphorylation level, cultures were treated with a gsk-3β specific inhibitor, l803-mt, together with gt1b for  <dig> h. l803-mt reversed tau hyperphosphorylation by 47%, compared to gt1b-treated cultures .

discussion
increasing evidence has shown that gangliosides enhance cell death in various cell types. for example, gm <dig> and gt1b produce an increase of cell death in feline thymocytes  <cit> . gm <dig> causes apoptosis, decreases brdurd incorporation, and up-regulates the cdk inhibitor p <dig> kip in proliferating astrocytes  <cit> . many studies also demonstrate that, gd <dig> disrupts mitochondria membrane potential  <cit> , induces cell death and activates caspases in hut <dig>  derived from a human cutaneous t cell lymphoma  <cit> . similarly, neurotoxicity of major brain gangliosides, such as gd1a and gd1b against dopaminergic neurons in mesencephalic cultures has been reported  <cit> . we also found that gt1b was neurotoxic to mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons in vivo and in vitro  <cit> . this is consistent with our present findings that gt1b neurotoxicity produces dna cleavage as well as condensation and fragmentation of nuclei, as evident from the tunel reaction, hoechst  <dig> nuclear staining and immunoelectron microscopic observations, respectively.

gt1b neurotoxicity is not mediated by caspase-3
nuclear dna damage occurs due to activation of caspase- <dig>  which appears to be a major effector of da neuronal cell death in human pd patients  <cit> , animal models of pd  <cit> , and mpp+-treated rat mesencephalic cultures  <cit>  and sn-derived da cell lines  <cit> . regarding this, our data indicated that gt1b-induced nuclear dna damage was accompanied by caspase- <dig> activation, which was effectively suppressed by the specific inhibitor, devd . however, the caspase- <dig> inhibitor, devd, and the non-specific caspase inhibitor, z-vad, were unable to block gt1b-induced neurotoxicity, as confirmed from the number of th-ip neurons and level of dopamine uptake in mesencephalic cultures . these results carefully suggest that under our experimental conditions, caspase- <dig> may not be a major effector of gt1b-induced da neuronal cell death. this hypothesis is supported by recent findings that inhibition of caspases, including caspase- <dig>  does not always prevent neuronal death in mpp+-treated cerebellar granule neurons  <cit> , proteasome inhibitor-mediated death of ht <dig> cells   <cit> , and global ischemia-induced hippocampal neurodegeneration  <cit> . moreover, a wide range of caspase inhibitors, including devd, had no effects on cytotoxicity induced by another major brain ganglioside, gd <dig>  in rat hepatocytes  <cit>  and hut <dig>  a cell line derived from a human cutaneous t cell lymphomas  <cit> .

the akt/gsk-3β/tau signaling pathway is implicated in gt1b neurotoxicity
akt, a serine/threonine protein kinase, is significantly associated with neuronal survival/degeneration  <cit> . in particular, decreased akt signaling is associated with neurodegeneration in the brains of mptp  <cit>  or 6-ohda-induced parkinsonism  <cit>  and drosophila models of pd  <cit> . moreover, several studies demonstrate that transduction of da neurons with myristoylated akt ,  <cit>  and increasing phospho-akt in lingo- <dig> knockout mice  <cit>  provide potent protection against 6-ohda- or mpp+-induced cellular and functional damage of da neurons, respectively, consistent with our present observation that gt1b neurotoxicity is associated with dephosphorylation/inactivation of akt. the result is further supported by previous findings that gt1b-induced apoptosis is mediated by decreased phosphorylation of akt in keratinocyte-derived scc <dig> cells  <cit> , and gt1b depletion increases cell survival through akt activation  <cit> .

akt contains two regulatory phosphorylation sites, thr <dig> and ser <dig>  while phosphorylation at both sites is dependent on phosphoinositide 3-oh kinase , the mechanism of ser <dig> phosphorylation remains controversial. in this regard, there is evidence suggesting that the ser <dig> site is autophosphorylated  <cit>  or phosphorylated by distinct serine kinase, including the integrin-linked kinase   <cit> . in ssc <dig> cells, gt1b-induced cell death is mediated by inhibiting phosphorylation of akt at ser <dig>  but not thr <dig>  through inactivation of ilk that does not require pi3k  <cit> . data from the present study show that gt1b neurotoxicity is accompanied by akt dephosphorylation at both ser <dig> and thr <dig>  therefore, it is likely that in mesencephalic cultures, ilk or pi3k signaling or both participate in gt1b neurotoxicity. however, we did not provide direct evidence of whether gt1b neurotoxicity is mediated by ilk or pi3k signaling or both.

the anti-apoptotic function of akt involves phosphorylation/inactivation of its downstream substrate, gsk-3β. inactivation of akt triggers gsk-3β activity through decreasing phosphorylation, which plays a key role in neuronal loss occurring in neurodegenerative diseases, such as pd  <cit>  and ad  <cit> . two pd mimetics, 6-ohda and mpp+, induce gsk-3β-dependent neurodegeneration in cell types, including sh-st5y, pc <dig>  and cerebellar granule neurons  <cit> , suggesting that gsk-3β is a key mediator of neuronal death. our results show that in mesencephalic cultures, gt1b induces dephosphorylation of gsk-3β, indicative of gsk-3β β involvement. this finding is further supported by th immunocytochemistry data showing that blockage of gsk-3β activation by the inhibitor, l803-mt, leads to reduced gt1b neurotoxicity.

our results are comparable with recent reports showing that suppression of gsk-3β β activity with selective inhibitors, such as indirubin-3'-oxime and ar-a <dig>  prevents mptp-induced loss of da neurons in vivo  <cit> , and novel synthetic inhibitors for gsk-3β protect da neurons against mpp+ toxicity in mesencephalic cultures via suppression of α-synuclein protein expression  <cit> . these results collectively imply that gt1b induces da neuronal death through the akt/gsk-3β signaling pathway .

tau is one of the major microtubule-associated proteins identified in neurons. hyperphosphorylation of tau inhibits its binding to microtubules, leading to neuronal death  <cit>  and is mediated by several protein kinases, including gsk-3β  <cit> . our western blot and double immunostaining data show that in parallel with increased gsk-3β activity, gt1b induces tau hyperphosphorylation in mesencephalic da neurons in vivo and in vitro. in addition, l803-mt, a gsk-3β inhibitor, attenuates tau phosphorylation, suggesting that gt1b neurotoxicity is mediated by the gsk-3β/tau signaling pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we show that gt1b neurotoxicity is associated with inhibition of akt, resultant activation of gsk-3β and increasing cleavaged tau as well as phosphorylation in mesencephalic neurons including da neuron. interestingly, while gt1b activates caspase- <dig>  a key molecule of da neuronal death, inhibition of caspase- <dig> fails to rescue da neurons. our data collectively suggest that gt1b neurotoxicity is associated with akt/gsk-3β/tau, but not with caspase- <dig>
