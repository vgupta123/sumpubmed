BACKGROUND
undaria pinnatifida  suringar is an important economic macroalga that has been used as sea vegetable for a long history in east asian countries  <cit> . in china it has been farmed since 1980s, with the annual yield maintaining around  <dig>  tons in wet weight in recent years, only second to saccharina japonica in brown algae. it is also an invasive species that has spread to all continents except antarctic and africa  and many investigations have been conducted on its invasive mechanism . despite the economic and ecological importance and nutritional value, the genetic study of u. pinnatifida lags far behind that of s. japonica, for which the draft genome sequence has recently been sequenced and characterized  <cit> . comparatively, the genetic exploration of u. pinnatifida is very limited, with only the transcriptome of gametophytes being sequenced till now  <cit> . u. pinnatifida has relatively complex and plastic morphology in comparison with other species of laminariales   <cit> ; however, the underlying genomic basis remains unknown. a genetic linkage map is a basic and robust tool for genetic and genomic research, which can provide a foundation for identification of genomic loci linked to phenotypic variants, mapping of quantitative traits loci  and even anchoring genomic sequence scaffolds . unfortunately there has been no genetic linkage map for u. pinnatifida.

genetic linkage maps have been extensively constructed and applied in land plants, animals and marine animals . in contrast, much fewer genetic maps have ever been reported in macroalgae, so far only in s. japonica, ectocarpus siliculosus and porphyra haitanensis to our knowledge . as a model species of brown algae, the genome of e. siliculosus has been sequenced and a genetic map was constructed to support the assembly of the genome  <cit> . qtl mapping and locating of sex-linked loci were conducted depending on the construction of genetic maps of s. japonica  <cit> . in earlier time these genetic maps were constructed by conventional markers such as amplified fragment length polymorphism , simple sequence repeat  and sequence-related amplified polymorphism , thus limiting the density of the maps. a high-density genetic map of s. japonica has very recently been constructed based on single nucleotide polymorphisms   <cit> , which are more robust markers than the above-mentioned ones because they are the most abundant form of genetic variation in the genome. however, snps used to be very expensive to develop; therefore they were only applied in model or very important species. with the advent of next generation sequencing technology, the sequencing cost has been dramatically reduced. high throughput sequencing technology provides novel strategies for snps development and genotyping. sequencing of reduced representation library , which further reduces the sequencing cost by only sequencing representative parts of the complex genome, can rapidly detect thousands of snp loci  <cit> . accordingly it is very suitable for development of snp markers, in particular in nonmodel species. the most common rrl sequencing methods include restriction site-associated dna sequencing   <cit> , 2b-rad  <cit> , specific length amplified fragment sequencing   <cit>  and genotyping by sequencing   <cit> . among others, the advantage of slaf-seq lies in that it can create a balance between higher genotyping accuracy and relatively lower sequencing cost  <cit> . it has been effectively applied in snps development, high-density genetic mapping and qtl mapping in organisms with or without reference genomic sequence . it is thus expected that this method can also be suitable for snps development and construction of high-density genetic map in nonmodel macroalgal species such as u. pinnatifida.

as a kelp species, u. pinnatifida has a typical life cycle that alternates between microscopic haploid gametophyte and macroscopic diploid sporophyte. male and female sexes are expressed after meiosis, at the haploid stage of the life cycle. this type of sexual system, which has recently been termed as uv, is in common with bryophytes and some other algae  <cit> . the chromosomes of kelp species are very small in size and droplet-shaped, making it difficult to conduct research on the karyotype  <cit> . as a result, there has been a long time debate regarding the exact chromosome numbers of kelp species and whether they possess a sex chromosome. recently, the chromosome number of the haploid gametophyte of s. japonica has been determined to be  <dig> with an improved chromosome preparation and staining method  <cit> . moreover, a female-related frml- <dig> marker  was localized on a unique chromosome of the female gametophyte and sporophyte  <cit> . in spite of this progress, the sex determining mechanism of kelp species still remains largely unknown. genetic mapping can be used to locate the sex-linked locus, thus being very helpful to decipher the sex determining mechanism, as shown by the result that high-density genetic mapping suggested a zw sex determining system in chinese mitten crab eriocheir sinensis  <cit> . similarly, it has recently been revealed that sex of ectocarpus sp. is determined at the haploid stage by a nonrecombining region on linkage group   <dig>  <cit> . this sex determining region  was then sequenced and characterized, which suggested a distinct evolutionary history in brown algae as compared to the xy and zw sexual system. the sex determining locus was also mapped to a unique lg  on the high-density genetic map of s. japonica  <cit> . these results imply that kelp species might have a similar sex determining mechanism to that of ectocarpus sp. the haploid chromosome number of u. pinnatifida was preliminarily determined to be  <dig> by traditional staining method  <cit>  and its genome size was estimated to be  <dig> mbp  <cit> . a sex-linked ssr marker   was identified only present in female gametophytes  <cit> . however, there is no further analysis on either the inheritance pattern or the chromosome location of this marker. furthermore, unusual monoecious zoospore-derived gametophytes were found in u. pinnatifida  <cit> ; however, the genetic basis of this phenomenon is unknown. construction of a high-density genetic linkage map is expected to be an essential step towards the understanding of sex determining mechanism in u. pinnatifida.

in this study, the slaf-seq technique was employed to construct a high-density genetic linkage map for u. pinnatifida, aiming at providing a basic genetic tool for further fundamental and applied research as well as mapping the sex determining locus in this species.

RESULTS
analysis of slaf-seq data and slaf markers
after slaf library construction and high throughput sequencing, a total of  <dig>  gb data including  <dig>  m pair-end reads was obtained. among them, the total read number for maternal and paternal parent was <dig>  m and  <dig>  m, respectively; while the average number of reads per progeny was  <dig>  m. the q <dig>  percentage was  <dig>  % and guanine-cytosine  content was  <dig>  % on average. the raw data of slaf-seq have been submitted to ncbi sra database under a bioproject accession number srp <dig> 

the slafs number of maternal and paternal parent was  <dig>  and  <dig> , with an average coverage of  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold, respectively. the slafs number in the offspring was  <dig> , with an average coverage of  <dig>  fold . in total,  <dig>  high-quality slafs were developed and  <dig>  of them were polymorphic, with a polymorphism percentage of  <dig>  % . among the polymorphic slafs,  <dig>  were classified into eight segregation patterns. because the mapping population was the f <dig> haploid population, only slafs with the aa × bb segregation pattern was used for genetic map construction. a total of  <dig>  slafs fell into this class . after filtering out the slafs with the sequencing coverage less than  <dig> fold in parents, or integrity less than 70 %, or that showing significant segregation distortion ,  <dig> slafs were obtained and used for construction of the linkage map.table  <dig> summary of the developed specific length amplified fragment  markers

discussion
dna markers and mapping population are indispensable elements for construction of the genetic linkage map  <cit> . ssrs have been the traditional markers of choice for genetic map construction due to their codominant nature, high polymorphism and good transferability  <cit> . however, there are only  <dig> genomic microsatellite markers available for u. pinnatifida  <cit> . although a large number of tentative est-ssrs have been developed recently  <cit> , their polymorphism and reliability have not been tested. with the reduction of sequencing cost brought by advanced generation sequencing approach, snps are becoming the first choice for construction of high-density genetic linkage map, in which the average marker interval can reach < 1 cm, thus providing more accurate foundation for discovery of functional genes and analysis of genome structure  <cit> . in this study, a large number of slaf markers were developed and a high-density genetic map was constructed in u. pinnatifida. the quality and quantity of the developed markers were enough to meet the requirements for construction of a high density genetic map. in total,  <dig> slaf and one ssr markers were assigned to  <dig> lgs, which equals the chromosome number identified by yabu et al  <cit> . the average distance between adjacent markers was  <dig>  cm, very similar to the marker density  in the genetic map of s. japonica  <cit> . evaluation with haplotype map and heat map indicated a high quality of the genetic map. to our knowledge, this is the first genetic linkage map of u. pinnatifida to date. with the high-density map and draft genomic sequence of s. japonica being available  <cit> , it is possible to conduct comparative analysis between u. pinnatifida and s. japonica in the next step  <cit> .

in this research, f <dig> haploid population was used to construct the genetic linkage map. similar to bryophyte, the haploid gametophyte of kelp species can propagate vegetatively by mitosis, making it feasible to establish f <dig> haploid population, which is the progeny of one segregating meiosis. as the gametophytes can be preserved for a long time without genetic variation, f <dig> haploid population provides a perpetual resource that can be used for genetic mapping and the further research. genetic markers can be continually added to the map in future studies and the mapping population or the corresponding dna can be shared with different labs for additional analysis. in this sense, f <dig> haploid population is genetically identical to double haploid  population, except for the difference in ploidy. moreover, since the sex trait of kelp species is expressed in haploid gametophyte stage, only gametophyte population can be used to map sex linked loci. f <dig> haploid populations have been used for construction of genetic map and mapping of sex determining locus in the moss ceratodon purpureus and the brown algae s. japonica and ectocarpus sp.  <cit> . because of the single meiosis event it has gone through, f <dig> haploid population suffered from relatively low recombination rate that might be the reason for the short map distance of some lgs in this study such as lg <dig>  in which the recombination rate between most adjacent markers was less than 1 %. this problem is expected to be resolved to a certain extent by constructing a larger f <dig> haploid population using parents with more heterozygosity.

we also associated the mapped slaf markers to sex trait. a major qtl involved in sex determination was detected in lg  <dig>  with a location spanning a region of around 40 cm. this result preliminarily implied that lg  <dig> is the potential sex chromosome for u. pinnatifida. in s. japonica, a sex determining locus was mapped to lg  <dig> in a window about  <dig>  cm in width  <cit> . in eriocheir sinensis, all the sex linked markers in the mapping family were located on a single linkage group, lg  <dig> within a size of  <dig>  cm by using qtl mapping of the sex phenotype  <cit> . in hippoglossus hippoglossus, a major sex associated qtl was also found spanning a region around 22 cm  <cit> . genomic regions with reduced recombination with sex trait are a common characteristic of sex chromosomes. these regions are supposed to contain genes for sex determination. fortunately, five slaf and one ssr markers were found to be completely linked to sex trait in this study, therefore these markers will be of special importance in characterizing the structure of the sex determining region . in previous studies, the ssr marker  has been identified to be tightly linked to quite a number of female gametophytes that were originated from geographically isolated populations  <cit> . this study further confirmed the sex linked characteristics of this marker in a segregating family. in the high-density genetic map of carica papaya, a total of  <dig> aflp markers were found to be cosegregating with sex determination locus  <cit> . similarly,  <dig> markers cosegregated with sex in the genetic map of ceratodon purpureus  <cit> . these results showed that recombination was severely suppressed in the region surrounding the sex determining locus. the large number of cosegregating markers in carica papaya and ceratodon purpureus suggested extensive sequence divergence at the sex determining locus. in comparison, only six cosegregating markers were identified in u. pinnatifida. the male and female sdr scaffolds of ectocarpus sp. have been identified to be approximately  <dig> kilobase pairs, in which four completely sex linked ssr markers were found  <cit> . these results suggest that the sdr of u. pinnatifida might be similar to that of ectocarpus sp., being of small size but highly diverged. mapping of the sex determining locus was just the first step towards deciphering the sex determining mechanism of u. pinnatifida. the physical structure of the sdr needs to be analyzed and characterized in the future. besides the research on genomic level, transcriptome analysis is also necessary to compare the differential gene expression between the two sexes to fully understand the genetic basis of sexual dimorphism. such kind of studies has recently been conducted in fucus and ectocarpus  <cit> . fine mapping in combination with transcriptome analysis will provide new insight into the sex determining mechanism as demonstrated in recent studies  <cit> .

the high-density genetic map built in this study is supposed to provide a robust tool for further fundamental and applied research in u. pinnatifida. however, the mapping population consisted of microscopic gametophytes, thus they cannot be used directly for qtl mapping of important economic traits such as length, width and weight. instead, mapping populations composed of sporophytes must be established for qtl research, which will be another focus in our future study.

CONCLUSIONS
a high-density genetic map was constructed for the first time in the economic brown alga undaria pinnatifida by using slaf-seq technology. a total of  <dig> slafs and one ssr marker  were mapped onto the genetic map, which was  <dig>  cm long, consisting of  <dig> lgs with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers. the length of the lgs ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm. a sex associated locus was mapped to lg <dig> within a window starting at  <dig>  cm and ending at  <dig>  cm with a total of  <dig> slaf markers. the ssr marker and five slaf markers  were identified as sex linked markers, as indicated by the zero recombination rate between sex phenotype and them. these markers are located at the position of  <dig>  cm, which was supposed to be the sex determining region. this map will serve as a basic genetic tool for further fundamental and applied research of u. pinnatifida and may provide a reference for studies in other kelp species.
