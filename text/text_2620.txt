BACKGROUND
aluminum  toxicity is one of the important factors limiting crop productivity in acid soils   <cit> , which occupy approximately 30% of the world's arable land  <cit> . under acidic conditions, al63+  is released into the soil solution at levels that inhibit plant root growth and impair water and mineral uptake  <cit> . despite decades of research on al resistance, little is known about the mechanisms by which legumes respond to and tolerate al stress. the model legume, medicago truncatula gaertn., which is a close relative of alfalfa, has a relatively small diploid genome, short generation time and prolific seed production  <cit>  and therefore serves as an ideal model system to study al toxicity and resistance mechanisms in legumes.

the root apex is considered to be the primary target of al toxicity. exposure of the root apex to al results in a rapid inhibition of root growth  <cit> . al disrupts root cell expansion and elongation, prior to inhibiting cell division  <cit>  and interferes with a wide range of physical and cellular processes. inhibition of root growth may occur as a result of al-induced decrease in cell wall extensibility  <cit> , callose formation  <cit> , inhibition of h+-atpase activity  <cit> , disruption of calcium homeostasis  <cit> , stabilization of cortical cell microtubules  <cit>  and/or alteration in chromatin structure by dna binding  <cit> .

many plant species exhibit significant genetic variability in their ability to resist and tolerate al toxicity. m. truncatula exhibits a natural variation in tolerance to low ph  <cit>  and al toxicity  <cit> . current models for al resistance mechanisms include exclusion of al from the root apex and internal detoxification of al transported into the root symplasm  <cit> . al-induced secretion of organic acid -chelators is considered to be the primary mechanism of al exclusion from the root apex. also, chelation of al by oas within the root symplasm has been observed in some plant species  <cit> . a number of studies have indicated that oa chelation may not be the only mechanism responsible for al resistance  <cit> .

over the last decade, researchers have debated whether the induced expression of genes or the activation of pre-formed proteins or both are necessary to combat al toxicity. the biochemical machinery for root al exclusion via organic acid release appears to be in place before exposure to al in some species  <cit> . in other species a delay in secretion is observed, indicating that gene induction may be required  <cit> . several studies have identified genes that are up-regulated under al stress conditions. however, most of these genes were considered to be general stress response genes since they were induced in response to other stresses  and to similar levels in both al-resistant and al-sensitive genotypes  <cit> .

in this report, we identified al-resistant and al-sensitive m. truncatula lines and quantified differences in al effects on root physiology and gene expression between these lines. based on our findings we propose that multiple responses including al exclusion by al-induced cell death of al-accumulating cells and organic acid efflux and internal detoxification by oa chelation may contribute towards higher al resistance in m. truncatula.

RESULTS
identification of al-resistant and al-sensitive m. truncatula
plants from  <dig> m. truncatula accessions were screened using a hydroponic assay with  <dig>  μm al concentration. at this al concentration, the relative root growth  of the reference m. truncatula genotype a <dig> was 33%. in a previously published study  <cit> ,  <dig>  n koh was used to adjust the ph of the al solutions to  <dig> . the addition of base can result in the hydrolysis of al63+  into monomeric species such as al5oh2+  <cit> . this could have potentially lowered the concentration of the toxic form of al  in the solution. in the current study, we avoided the use of base. therefore, similar levels of root growth inhibition as obtained previously were achieved by using 10-fold lower al concentrations in the current study.

the rrg values of the different lines were normalized to that of a <dig> to rank them according to their level of resistance. eight lines with normalized values greater than  <dig>  were considered al-resistant and eight lines with values below  <dig>  as al-sensitive . no correlation was observed between seed size and root growth . an al-resistant line generated from a single seed of the accession pi  <dig> from morocco , and an al-sensitive line similarly derived from the italian accession pi <dig> , were selected to study physiological and molecular aspects of al resistance. t <dig> showed the highest rrg in al solution and was the obvious choice for the resistant line. although s <dig> was not the most al-sensitive line in the screen, it was selected because plant to plant variation in root growth in nutrient solution was minimal compared to other al-sensitive lines and root growth rates of s <dig> were most similar to that of t <dig> in control solutions .

rrg, ratio of root growth in  <dig>  μm al solution to root growth in  <dig> μm al solution; se, standard error of the mean; p-value, significance comparing mean relative root growth for each line with that of a <dig>  student's t-test  using a two-tailed distribution was employed for the statistical test.

aluminum dose-response root growth
relative root growth of a <dig>  t <dig>  and s <dig> decreased in an al dose-dependent manner over  <dig> h of al exposure . however, differences in al resistance between t <dig> and s <dig> were observed at all al concentrations evaluated. at lower solution al concentrations , t <dig> exhibited the highest rrg values , followed by a <dig> , and s <dig> . the maximum difference in rrg between t <dig> and s <dig> was observed at  <dig>  μm solution al concentration.

within the first  <dig> h of al treatment, root growth inhibition in t <dig> occurred at all al concentrations tested except at  <dig>  μm al . in  <dig>  μm solution al concentration the root growth of t <dig> seedlings was approximately 20% higher than the control seedlings after  <dig> h. this phenomenon has been observed in wheat, and it was suggested that enhanced root growth might be the result of alleviation of h+ stress under acidic conditions by al  <cit> . alternatively, addition of al to the nutrient solution may influence the bioavailability of other ions in a manner that stimulates growth  <cit> . interestingly, it has been shown that the low concentration al-induced increase in root growth of quercus serrata was not caused by the amelioration of h+ toxicity by al  <cit> . in contrast, root growth inhibition occurred at all al concentrations in s <dig> at  <dig> h . by  <dig> h, recovery of root growth to control rates was observed in t <dig> at  <dig>  μm al. depletion of al from the nutrient solution is not a likely explanation for this result given the large solution volume and small root mass involved. in s <dig>  no recovery was observed and root growth inhibition appeared to be constant throughout the time course of the experiment. the stimulation of root growth at  <dig>  μm al and recovery of root growth at  <dig>  μm al suggests that the al resistance of t <dig> is inducible. in an al-resistant maize cultivar, there was a lag time of more than  <dig> h before the root tips were efficiently protected against al toxicity  <cit> . similarly, in  <dig>  μm al solutions, a lag period between al stress perception and functional expression of induced al resistance would explain the observed root growth inhibition and recovery pattern in t <dig> 

al accumulation in t <dig> and s <dig> root tips
the degree of hematoxylin staining in root tips provides a semi-quantitative measure of al content, and is inversely proportional to both the ability of a genotype to exclude al from the root apex, and its al resistance  <cit> . the greatest differentiation between t <dig> and s <dig> was observed at  <dig>  μm al, at which root tips of t <dig> exhibited minimal staining and root tips of s <dig> were more intensely stained . similar differences were observed at  <dig> μm al. however, at  <dig> μm al, root tips of both lines were intensely stained, indicating an inability to effectively exclude al at such high concentrations.

roots of t <dig> and s <dig> were stained with hematoxylin following different lengths of exposure to  <dig>  μm al to determine whether the recovery in root growth observed in t <dig> was a consequence of a decrease in al accumulation in the root tips. within  <dig> h of al treatment, root tips of both lines were lightly stained . by  <dig> h, no staining was observed in t <dig>  in contrast, root tips of s <dig> were intensely stained. the increased al resistance of t <dig> may depend on an induced ability to exclude al, since no visible hematoxylin staining was observed in t <dig> root tips at  <dig> h. if al exclusion is inducible in t <dig>  the al that was initially taken up by the roots would still be present, and would likely be visible by hematoxylin staining. figure 3b shows visible hematoxylin staining approximately  <dig> mm from the root tip at  <dig> h of al treated roots , demonstrating that al had accumulated in root cells prior to root growth recovery. in contrast, s <dig> root tips showed increased al accumulation coupled with severe cell damage that extended  <dig> to  <dig> mm behind the root tip . this pattern of injury is similar to previous observations in al-sensitive maize root apices  <cit> . the hematoxylin staining result is concordant with the root growth data, indicating that greater al accumulation is correlated with greater root growth inhibition in m. truncatula.

differential expression of genes in response to al
the molecular responses underlying differences in al resistance were investigated using the m. truncatula aros  arrays  consisting of probes for approximately  <dig>  m. truncatula expressed genes. al-induced gene expression was compared in t <dig> and s <dig> after  <dig> and  <dig> h of +/-  <dig>  μm al treatment. we selected  <dig> h since root growth inhibition was observed at that time point in t <dig>  we selected the  <dig> h time point since root growth rates recovered to that of the controls by  <dig> h in t <dig>  these time points were chosen to identify transcriptional differences associated with al-toxicity and resistance responses between the two lines. to detect significant genes with al-regulated expression and to eliminate those that have inconsistent expression data among replicated experiments, we employed a statistical method adapted specifically for microarrays, which allows estimation of the false discovery rate  for multiple testing  <cit> . a delta criterion that allowed a fdr <  <dig> % was applied. genes that satisfied the statistical threshold were identified as significantly up- or down-regulated in al-treated roots. in addition, we used a 2-fold change cut-off for the significant genes. normalized and raw data have been submitted to ncbi gene expression omnibus . in both lines, the expression of a majority of transcripts appeared unchanged at both time points with al treatment. as shown in figure  <dig>  more genes were significantly altered by ≥  <dig> -fold in  <dig> h al-treated root tips compared to  <dig> h al-treated root tips. additionally, at both time points, a greater number of al-induced genes were observed in s <dig> root tips . since root growth of s <dig> was inversely correlated with al accumulation at these time points, the greater number of up-regulated genes in s <dig> at both time points likely corresponds to greater al stress perception and may reflect al toxicity responses. in contrast, the numbers of down-regulated genes were similar in both lines and at both time points . it has been suggested that adaptive reprogramming to stressful conditions may require a higher number of down-regulated genes  <cit> ; therefore, the similar numbers of down-regulated genes at both time points in both lines might reflect an overlap in al stress adaptation responses.

the genes showing significantly different transcript accumulation patterns in response to al in t <dig> and s <dig> experiments were further compared to determine the number that were up- or down-regulated in response to al treatment by 2-fold or more in both lines vs. only in one line . at the  <dig> h time point,  <dig> genes were uniquely expressed in t <dig> and  <dig> in s <dig>  by  <dig> h t <dig> had  <dig> uniquely expressed genes and  <dig> were expressed only in s <dig>  these differences may represent differences in al stress perception and adaptation in t <dig> and s <dig> root tips. the large number of shared genes at the  <dig> h time point  might reflect an overlap in the al toxicity responses in both lines. a list of selected significant differentially regulated genes is presented in table  <dig>  functional categorization for all genes was based on gene ontology  process information .

tigr tc, the institute for genomic research tentative consensus sequence id version  <dig> ; tentative annotation, based on tigr/ncbi tblastx tool; go = gene ontology; fold change = ratio of transcript abundance in al treatment/transcript abundance in control  treatment; ns = not significant; nd = not detected.

the al-regulated expression changes in  <dig> significant genes were examined for both lines by quantitative reverse-transcription pcr . the q-pcr results showed the same direction of fold change of transcript abundance as the microarray in all three biological replicates for most genes . in most cases, expression ratios based on q-pcr were higher than those ratios obtained from microarray hybridizations. this difference in expression ratios estimated by the two techniques has been observed previously  <cit>  and reflects the specificity and sensitivity of the q-pcr technique  <cit> . the ratios  of the mean q-pcr fold change values were similar to the ratios of the microarray fold change values for most genes tested, thereby validating the microarray results.

gene expression in response to  <dig> h of al treatment in s <dig> root tips
after  <dig> h of al treatment, the rrg of s <dig> was approximately 45%  with al accumulating mainly in the epidermis and outer cortical cells of the root tip . aluminum has been shown to rapidly bind to the pectic matrix in the cell wall, reduce cell wall  extensibility  <cit> , and consequently inhibit root elongation. thus, as might be expected, a number of cw-related genes potentially involved in cw loosening including a pectinesterase precursor, an expansin-like protein and a xyloglucan endotransglycosylase, were differentially regulated in response to al treatment in s <dig> root tips . pectin methylesterases have been shown to increase the al sensitivity of plants because their ability to demethylate pectin, in addition to altering the sensitivity of the cw to the action of other cw-degrading enzymes  <cit> , might create additional binding sites for al in the cw  <cit> . this can occur by increasing the free organic acid moieties  in the wall, making it more negatively charged. recently, we showed that the down-regulation of a pectin acetylesterase gene in m. truncatula transgenic roots resulted in a modest increase  in root growth under al stress conditions compared to wild-type plants  <cit> . based on these results it appears that plant cells respond to al-induced cw stiffening by enhancing the expression of cw loosening enzymes in an attempt at stimulating cw expansion.

notable at this time point was the accumulation of gene transcripts encoding reactive oxygen species  generating enzymes. genes encoding peroxidases and peroxidase precursors as well as germin-like proteins and carbohydrate oxidase were up-regulated . aluminum toxicity has previously been shown to trigger the expression and activity of ros generating enzymes and ros accumulation has been shown to positively correlate with al sensitivity  <cit> . ros are capable of causing oxidative damage to proteins, dna, and lipids in plant cells and may ultimately lead to cell death  <cit> . the enhanced expression of genes encoding ros generating enzymes suggest that upon al stress, s <dig> root tips experience oxidative damage, which could in turn result in complete root growth inhibition . a number of genes coding for ros generating enzymes were also found to be down-regulated in s <dig> at  <dig> h of al treatment . it is possible that specific peroxidases may be involved in the al toxicity response, consequently resulting in the down-regulation of peroxidases involved in other responses, including ones that might be involved in ros scavenging.

the observed increase in transcript accumulation of ros generating genes may reflect ros accumulation in root tips and therefore may elicit the expression of antioxidant-related genes. consistent with this hypothesis, an increase in the expression of antioxidant genes was observed in s <dig> root tips. genes putatively encoding glutathione s-transferase and thioredoxin were significantly up-regulated . also up-regulated were genes encoding tyrosine aminotransferase and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of α-tocopherols, which function as membrane stabilizers and antioxidants that scavenge oxygen free radicals, lipid peroxy radicals, and singlet oxygen  <cit> .

a number of stresses induce production of ros and lipid peroxidation, including pathogen attack. since al resulted in accumulation of ros generating gene transcripts in s <dig> root tips, the resulting ions and oxidative damage might have triggered the up-regulation of a number of pathogen defense-related and membrane-stabilizing genes . a number of genes encoding isoflavonoid biosynthetic enzymes were uniquely up-regulated in  <dig> h al-treated s <dig> root tips . the isoflavonoids, which are mostly limited to the subfamily papilionoideae of the fabaceae, have been shown to function as phytoalexins  <cit>  and antioxidants  <cit> . their up-regulation in response to al stress may represent a unique response of the legume family to al-induced oxidative stress.

it has been shown that ros triggers cell death by apoptosis, necrosis, or mechanisms with features of both  <cit> . between  <dig> and  <dig> h of al treatment, cell death of al-accumulating epidermal and outer cortical cell layers was observed in s <dig> root tips. fluorescence observed in root tip cells as a result of morin staining depicts al-accumulation while both light microscopy of al-treated root tip cross sections  and root tips stained with evan's blue, which is a dye that measures extent of cell death, indicates cell death . consistent with this phenotypic observation, a number of cell-death associated genes were up-regulated in s <dig> root tips including cysteine proteinase, senescence associated proteins and genes for cw degrading enzymes that may be necessary for cell separation during programmed cell death. hypothetically, gene expression data from s <dig> root tips after  <dig> h of al treatment reflects enhanced cw stiffening, severe oxidative damage probably due to significant ros accumulation and activation of cell death.

gene expression in response to  <dig> h of al treatment in s <dig> root tips
after  <dig> h of al treatment, rrg of s <dig> was approximately 17% . notably, transcript accumulation of cw-modifying genes was observed at this time point  suggesting continued cw stiffening from al treatment. furthermore, the prolonged induction of caffeic acid o-methyltransferase, involved in lignin biosynthesis only in s <dig> root tips could contribute to continued al-induced root elongation inhibition. genes putatively encoding polygalacturonase, pectate lyases, and β- <dig>  4-glucanase, which are cw-degrading enzymes, were significantly up-regulated in s <dig> root tips . it is plausible that cell separation during the persistent cell death response at  <dig> h of al treatment may elicit the prolonged expression of these genes. interestingly, three genes encoding putative arabinogalactan-proteins  were uniquely up-regulated in s <dig> at  <dig> h of al treatment. agps belong to a class of hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins that are abundant in the plant cw and membrane  <cit> , with no clear function. two maize agps were found in disintegrating xylem cells and a role in identifying cells committed to pcd was proposed  <cit> . furthermore, two agp genes were identified as showing enhanced expression in arabidopsis after al stress  <cit> . thus, agps may represent a novel facet of the al toxicity response since they are significantly up-regulated only in the al-sensitive line and may be involved in modulating cell wall architecture and/or involved in the al-induced cell death response.

accumulation of transcripts for enzymes generating ros remained high after  <dig> h of al treatment. the maintenance of peroxidase transcripts up to  <dig> h of al treatment is consistent with previous observations in tobacco cells  <cit>  and arabidopsis  <cit>  in which these genes showed enhanced expression during prolonged al treatments. a few antioxidant genes including thioredoxin, ascorbate peroxidase, and alternate oxidase were uniquely up-regulated in s <dig> root tips at  <dig> h al treatment. however, transcripts for other antioxidant related genes expressed after  <dig> h of al treatment did not show enhanced accumulation at  <dig> h. the enhanced expression of a greater number of ros generating genes compared to antioxidant genes at  <dig> h suggests that the antioxidant capacity of s <dig> root tips might be insufficient to prevent significant ros accumulation. consequently, higher doses of ros without sufficient scavenging, may lead to greater oxidative damage and necrosis in s <dig> root tips. consistent with this hypothesis, the transcripts of four pr-genes and other stress-related genes remained at elevated levels after  <dig> h of al treatment suggesting continued oxidative damage. in addition, cell death and senescence-associated genes were uniquely up-regulated in  <dig> h al-treated s <dig> root tips suggesting the longevity and severity of the cell death response. in agreement with the expression data, we observed a ≥ 10-fold extent of cell death in s <dig> al-treated root tips compared to control root tips after  <dig> h of al treatment . in addition, at these time points, al was observed in some of the inner cortical layers of the root tip as indicated by morin staining .

collectively, the prolonged expression of genes associated with cw loosening, ros generation, cell death and cw degradation after  <dig> h of al treatment implies that the al-induced oxidative damage and cell death response resembles a necrotic response, damaging deeper cell layers and ultimately resulting in irreversible root growth inhibition in s <dig> 

gene expression in response to  <dig> h al treatment in t <dig> root tips
at  <dig> h of al treatment, the rrg of t <dig> was approximately 78%  with al accumulating mainly in the epidermal cell layer of the root tip as indicated by morin staining . the inhibition in root growth, although not as severe as in s <dig>  might induce the expression of cw-related genes. consistent with this hypothesis, cw loosening genes were similarly regulated in s <dig> and t <dig> root tips at  <dig> h of al treatment , indicating an overlap in responses to al toxicity in both lines.

transcript accumulation of genes encoding ros generating enzymes in t <dig> root tips was similar to that observed in s70; however, the total number of up-regulated genes was lower in t <dig> root tips . a number of antioxidant genes accumulated similarly in both lines . however, two quinone oxidoreductase genes, a glutathione s-transferase  gene, and a blue copper protein  precursor were significantly up-regulated only in t <dig> root tips. quinone-oxidoreductases, which are involved in the detoxification of reactive aldehydes derived from lipid peroxides  <cit>  have previously been shown to be induced in response to al treatment in al-tolerant and al-sensitive rice roots  <cit> . previously, bcb and gst genes were shown to be up-regulated in arabidopsis in response to al treatment  <cit>  and plants over-expressing these genes displayed increased resistance to low al concentrations  <cit> . therefore, these genes may represent a resistance response associated with ros scavenging in response to al treatment only in al-resistant root tips. relative to s <dig>  a greater number of ros generating genes including peroxidases and peroxidase precursors were down-regulated in t <dig> . however, in contrast to s <dig>  antioxidant genes were not down-regulated in t <dig>  in addition, up-regulation of fewer pr-genes, isoflavonoid biosynthetic genes, and stress-related genes  reflected a lower extent of oxidative damage in t <dig> root tips. these data suggest that although there appears to be ros accumulation in response to  <dig> h al treatment in t <dig> root tips, the levels may be lower than that observed in s <dig> 

a number of cell-death associated genes were uniquely up-regulated in t <dig> after  <dig> h of al treatment . expression of these genes is consistent with cell death observed at  <dig> h of al treatment . interestingly, cell death appeared to be restricted to cells that accumulate al as visualized by light microscopy of root tip cross sections . it has been suggested that low al concentration treatments induce cell death possibly via a ros-activated signal transduction pathway  <cit> . however, exposure to more toxic concentrations of al may cause necrosis in the root tip cells. likewise, h2o <dig> produced in barley roots, during early phases of al stress, has been suggested to play a role in the induction of cell death  <cit> . therefore, in addition to the observed patterns of expression of ros generating and scavenging genes, the activation of cell death in al-accumulating root tip cells indicate lower ros accumulation in t <dig> after  <dig> h al treatment. accumulation of low levels of ros, which although might be insufficient to cause significant oxidative damage, may play a key role in triggering cell death of al-accumulating cells, as has been demonstrated in cell death responses to other abiotic and biotic stresses  <cit> .

gene expression in response to  <dig> h al treatment in t <dig> root tips
after  <dig> h of  <dig>  μm al treatment, the rrg of t <dig> recovered to approximately 90% . at this time point fewer genes were differentially regulated in response to al treatment in t <dig> root tips  compared to  <dig> h of treatment. notably, fewer ros generating genes were up-regulated, and up-regulation of a number of antioxidant genes was observed . since fewer ros generating genes were up-regulated, the basal antioxidant capacity may have been sufficient to prevent significant ros accumulation. interestingly, there was no significant change in expression of stress-related genes, including pr-proteins and isoflavonoids and cell death genes  suggesting that the ros levels may have been insufficient to cause oxidative damage and cell death. in fact, down-regulation of some stress-related genes and senescence-associated genes was observed at this time point . moreover, probably as a result of new root tip growth, the extent of al accumulation and cell death at  <dig> h was minimal . therefore, we speculate that in t <dig> root tips, the cell death response occurred early on and was aimed at removing al-accumulating cells leading to a recovery in root growth.

a continued response to al stress in t <dig> root tips after  <dig> h of al treatment was indicated by the high transcript accumulation of a putative multidrug and toxin extrusion  gene . although the expression of this gene was significantly up-regulated at both time points of al treatment and in both lines , the prolonged expression of this gene during root growth recovery in the al-tolerant line made it an interesting candidate for al resistance studies. we examined whether the spatial expression pattern of this gene played a role in differential al resistance responses in these lines.

differential pattern of expression of mtmate in t <dig> and s70
to determine the spatial distribution of mate gene expression in response to early  and later  time points of al treatment, in situ pcr was carried out on root tip cross sections. in  <dig> h al-treated t <dig> root tips, a positive signal was visible in cells of the endodermis and the regions encompassing the vascular bundles . in contrast, in  <dig> h al-treated s <dig> root tips, the signal appeared to be more uniformly distributed over the entire section including the epidermis, cortical cells and vasculature . no signal was observed in  <dig> h control  t <dig> and s <dig> root sections . in  <dig> h al-treated t <dig> root tips, a strong signal was visible in the epidermis in addition to the vascular region; however, the signal appeared to be restricted to the epidermis and outer cortical cells in  <dig> h al-treated s <dig> root tips. a positive signal was also observed in the epidermis, cortical cells and vasculature of  <dig> h control s <dig> roots  indicating the uniform expression of this gene under al-free conditions. the intron-specific primers gave no positive signals . overall, the localization of mate expression in al-treated root tips indicated that the transcript of the mate gene accumulated most strongly in the vascular region of t <dig> and mainly in the epidermal and outer cortical layers in s <dig> 

the mtmate shares 67% identity with a putative lupin lamate , 63% identity with a rice mate gene , and 62% identity with the arabidopsis frd <dig> protein . based on studies conducted on different mate genes it has been hypothesized that this family may be involved in transporting a diverse set of small organic molecules either directly out of the cell or into vacuolar compartments  <cit> . recently, frd <dig> was shown to be a citrate efflux transporter and arabidopsis plants ectopically expressing frd <dig> had significantly higher amounts of citrate in their root exudates compared to untransformed controls and possessed an enhanced resistance to aluminium  <cit> . morin staining revealed presence of al in the vasculature of t <dig> root tips at  <dig> h of al treatment . taking the differential root growth rates and al accumulation patterns together with the spatial expression pattern of the mtmate, it is tempting to speculate that the strong vascular expression of mtmate in t <dig> root tips might be involved in transporting al away from the sensitive growing root tip therefore resulting in lower root growth inhibition in t <dig>  internal detoxification of al by formation of organic acid-al complexes has been previously demonstrated in hydrangea and buckwheat  <cit> . in buckwheat, al is chelated internally in the root cells by oxalate and translocated via the xylem to leaf cells where these complexes are then stored in vacuoles  <cit> . likewise, it is possible that in t <dig> the mtmate gene may be involved in the transport of organic acid-al complexes into the aerial parts of the plant followed by sequestration into vacuoles. in s <dig>  the organic acid efflux or al-sequestration into vacuoles might be restricted to the root surface as indicated by the strong expression in the epidermal and cortical cells. in addition, it is possible that the observed expression of this gene under al-free conditions in s <dig> root tips is in response to low ph or low ph-induced nutrient deficiencies. interestingly, the lamate displays enhanced expression under various nutrient stress conditions including -p, -fe, -mn, -n and + al  <cit> . similarly, the frd <dig> gene is induced in response to cold stress and during senescence . alternatively, although al-induced expression of the mate gene occurs in both lines, the subsequent activation of organic acid efflux might be delayed or inhibited in s <dig>  localization of mtmate to either the plasma membrane or the vacuole would reveal its site of action, and identification of the molecule it transports could permit a direct biochemical test of its function in transport.

CONCLUSIONS
one of the most widely studied mechanisms of al resistance is the al exclusion and/or internal detoxification via organic acids , which serve as al chelators. however, induction of oa biosynthetic genes was not observed in this study. this finding was not surprising since, to date, no strong evidence exists for al-induced expression of any of the enzymes catalyzing oa synthesis and metabolism  <cit> . indeed, it is possible that oa biosynthetic enzymes are regulated translationally or post-translationally. in the present study we compared physiological and molecular differences between an al- resistant and sensitive line, which enabled us to identify novel facets of al resistance in medicago truncatula. a number of al-inducible genes with potential roles in al resistance were identified in this study. for example, the al-inducible mate gene might be involved in organic acid exudation and internal detoxification of al in t <dig>  supporting the idea of an al resistance mechanism involving organic acids in m. truncatula. additionally, cell death of al-accumulating cells in t <dig> represents a unique aspect of al resistance in legumes. our results provide a valuable data set for future studies targeted at investigating additional al resistance responses.
