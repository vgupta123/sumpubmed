BACKGROUND
inguinal and scrotal hernias are usually caused by a congenital defect, which occurs as a weakness of the inguinal canal. about  <dig> % of all litters in german pig breeds are affected  <cit> . in several studies the estimated values of heritability for inguinal hernias in pigs range from h <dig> =  <dig>   <cit>  to h <dig> >  <dig>   <cit> . the inguinal/scrotal hernia condition in pigs and in humans is affected by both environmental and genetic factors, with the involvement of multiple genes and likely incomplete penetrance, although the mode of inheritance has not been clarified so far and is still controversially discussed in literature  <cit> . in humans a high segregation ratio suggesting an autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance and sex influence was reported. additionally, the authors of this study noted a preferential paternal transmission of the disease gene and suggested a possible role of genomic imprinting in the aetiology of the hernia condition in man  <cit> . anatomical factors such as an abnormal wide inguinal canal or a not obliterated processus vaginalis are regarded as predisposing for inguinal and scrotal hernia. thus a predisposition takes place during and shortly after testicular descent. the gubernaculum or genitofemoral ligament is emerging as the key anatomical structure in the control of testicular descent. the first phase of testicular migration  <cit>  is characterized by rapid growth of the gubernaculum, which serves to dilate the inguinal canal prior to descent of the testes. this is accomplished through a rapid swelling of the gubernaculum due to formation of hydrated space, mediated mainly by the formation and deposition of hyaluronan  within the gubernacular tissue  <cit> .

during the second phase of testicular descent the gubernaculum involutes, presumably due to the removal of ha, thus allowing the testes to descend into the scrotum  <cit> . enzymes that act in the biodegradation of ha feature the second phase of testicular descent, these are hyaluronidase, β-hexosaminidase and β-glucuronidase.

our hypothesis is that the swelling of the gubernaculum exceeds through accumulation of ha due to a diminished degradation. the inguinal ring is thus extended in an unphysiological way and may remain open predisposing the male pigs for inguinal and scrotal hernia. the limitation of ha degradation may be based on mutations in one or several of the genes coding for the ha degrading enzymes.

a genome-wide linkage scan was conducted to identify chromosomal regions involved in the inheritance of hernia in pigs  <cit> . gusb first considered as functional candidate was mapped within a region on porcine chromosome  <dig>   <cit>  that was found to be associated with congenital inguinal and scrotal hernia. therefore, the gene was considered as a positional candidate in addition to its functional relevance.

here we report the isolation and complete genomic characterization of the porcine gusb gene, its status as a positional candidate gene for congenital inguinal and scrotal hernia in combination with results obtained from linkage and association analysis of ssc <dig>  further, an association study of two snps within the gusb coding sequence was conducted to elucidate their relevance for the phenotype hernia inguinalis/scrotalis.

RESULTS
linkage and association analysis on ssc3
linkage analysis on ssc <dig> was conducted using  <dig> microsatellites. table  <dig> shows the  <dig> microsatellite markers their position on the chromosome and the location of the significant nonparametric lod scores  obtained in single- and multipoint analyses. the information content was  <dig>  on average. two regions on chromosome  <dig>  showed significant npl. the singlepoint analysis revealed a significant npl for markers sw <dig>  and s <dig> , while multipoint linkage analysis gave significant npl values for the five region i markers sw <dig> , sw <dig> , sw <dig> , sw <dig> , se <dig> , and for the two region ii markers sw <dig>  and s <dig> .

the transmission disequilibrium test  was applied to all markers on ssc <dig> the resulting p-values are given in table  <dig>  tdt confirmed the results of the nonparametric linkage analysis within region i for the markers sw <dig>  sw <dig>  sw <dig>  and within region ii for marker s <dig> . a significant tdt score  was also found for marker sw <dig> located at position  <dig>  cm, about  <dig> cm distal of region ii.

physical distances between gusb and microsatellite markers
gusb was mapped by analyses of a whole-genome radiation hybrid panel  <cit>  and fluorescence in situ hybridization, the most significantly linked markers were sw <dig> and sw <dig>  <cit> . twopoint analyses gave a distance of  <dig> cr to sw <dig> and one of  <dig> cr to sw <dig>  hawken and colleagues estimated a conversion ratio  for the panel of  <dig>  kb/cr on ssc <dig>  <cit> . therefore, the distances in cr correspond to a distance of  <dig>  mb between gusb locus and sw <dig> and one of  <dig>  mb between gusb locus and sw <dig> at  <dig>  cm  <cit> .

these results confirmed gusb as a positional candidate gene for congenital inguinal and scrotal hernia in addition to its previously proposed functional relevance.

structural characterization of clone taigp714n09100q
pulsed field electrophoresis after noti digestion of the isolated pac clone taigp714n09100q revealed an insert size of  <dig> kb. subsequent partial sequence characterization confirmed that the clone contained the whole porcine functional gusb gene as well as at least one exon of the so far uncharacterized porcine vkorc1l <dig>  gene.

characterization of genomic sequence and comparative sequence analyses
a contig spanning  <dig>  bp, which contained the entire gusb gene and  <dig>  kb of its 5' and 3' flanking regions was assembled  by a combination of subcloning, primerwalking and sequencing of long range pcr-products. the porcine gusb gene spans over  <dig>  bp  and consists of  <dig> exons ranging in length from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp, which are separated by introns ranging in length from  <dig> bp to  <dig>  bp. while the length of the exons is highly conserved between humans and pig, the size of the introns varies considerably, thus accounting for the larger size  of the human gusb compared to its porcine ortholog.

a comparison of the porcine gusb protein-encoding region  with mammalian orthologs revealed nucleotide sequence identities of 88% with the feline gusb , 87% with the canine gusb , 84% with the human gusb , and 81% with the murine gusb . the observed identities between the known mammalian gusb coding sequences are consistent with the molecular phylogenetic relationships between the different species. pipmaker program  <cit>  was further used to align the porcine sequence dq <dig> to a human bac clone  on chromosome  <dig>  that contains the human gusb gene. based on this alignment  a region of  <dig> kb from position  <dig>  to position  <dig>  of the human bac clone was used for further comparative sequence analyses. the murine sequence was taken from genbank entry j <dig>  the results of screening for cpg islands and repetitive elements are shown in table  <dig>  dq <dig> reveals a high gc content of  <dig> % compared to the mean gc content recently estimated at  <dig> % and  <dig> % for porcine coding sequences and introns respectively  <cit> . the high gc content is consistent with the gc content of  <dig> % of the human gusb gene. contrary to that the gc content in the murine gusb sequence is below 50% although five cpg islands were detected. like many other housekeeping genes, human, murine, and porcine gusb genes contain a cpg island that spans the promoter region, exon  <dig>  and parts of intron  <dig>  only this promoter-associated cpg island is present in the three species, although the human  and the murine  promoter-associated cpg islands are significantly shorter than their porcine counterpart . moreover, the porcine sequence contains three cpg islands in total the mouse ortholog five regions, whereas human gusb contains only two cpg islands. these differences in amount and length of cpg rich regions contribute to the difference in the total gc content between the human, murine and porcine sequences. the cpg islands annotated in table  <dig> matched the commonly defined criteria for a cpg island: 1) regions of dna of at least  <dig> bp in length; and 2) a cg content above 50% and a ratio of observed versus expected cpgs above  <dig>   <cit> .

the human, murine and porcine gusb sequences were also screened for repetitive elements using the repeatmasker database. the total content of repetitive sequences in human gusb accounts  <dig> %. contrary, the porcine gusb contains only  <dig> % repetitive elements. an intermediate repeat content of  <dig> % was found in the murine gusb gene. in all three species the vast majority among the repetitive elements are species-specific sine repeats, with  <dig> % in the human and  <dig> % in the murine but only  <dig> % in the porcine gusb sequence. this discrepancy can be explained by the fact that pig-specific sine repeats   <cit>  are less characterized than human-specific alus or murine b1-b <dig> elements. it is, however, most likely that this discrepancy primarily reflects a true difference rather than a biased detection in the species-specific repeat content, since all human gusb introns are longer than their porcine counterparts and should therefore contain more sine repeats.

furthermore,  <dig> % of the human sines are alu elements, which are specific for primates. recently, the human gusb gene has been described to show an extremely high percentage of alu repeats compared to the human genome average of 6-12%. the authors postulated that the alu elements serve a vital function that precedes pseudogene proliferation within the human genome. therefore, the authors concluded that most of the human gusb pseudogenes have arisen from involvement of alu-alu recombination  <cit> . as the porcine gusb contains only few sines in its 5' region and since we found no evidence for unprocessed gusb pseudogenes within the pig genome during screening of the genomic pac library our results support their hypothesis.

snp analysis
after screening all of the  <dig> gusb exons with the adjacent intron junctions a total of five snps located in exons  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> as well as in introns  <dig> and  <dig> were discovered. at positions  <dig>   and  <dig>   each  thymine is substituted by cytosine, but both substitutions do not lead to an exchange of the encoded amino acid. the transition of guanine to adenine at position  <dig> , however, changes the encoded amino acid from valine to methionine. additionally two snps in intron  <dig>  and in intron  <dig>  were detected, but both of them do not alter splice motifs.

the  <dig> animals of the half-sib pedigree were genotyped for the three snps in exons  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  test assays used for genotyping and resulting allele frequencies for each of the snps are given in table  <dig>  the snp in exon  <dig> was excluded from further analyses, because of the uneven allele frequency distribution with a minor allele frequency of  <dig> .

association analysis for gusb-snps
tdt was applied to the snps in exons  <dig> and  <dig> to test simultaneously for association and linkage with congenital inguinal hernia. tdt analyses gave p-values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the snps in exon  <dig> and exon  <dig>  respectively. therefore, no significant association between the allelic variants and the disease outcome was detected.

CONCLUSIONS
all twelve exons of the porcine gusb gene were screened for snps to evaluate a possible contribution of the gene in the inheritance of hernia. no structural mutation that significantly alters structure of the protein has been detected. in order to evaluate if so far undetected causative mutations that lie in linkage disequilibrium with one of the detected snps may contribute to the disease outcome a straightforward snp-based association analyses was conducted. no association was found for the two tested snps. nevertheless it is well recognized that especially for complex diseases common association analyses in which only one gene is tested at a time might reduce the chance to identify disease susceptibility genes with relatively small effect sizes  <cit> . therefore, continued finemapping and combined association analysis of candidate genes within all disease-linked chromosomal regions should shed further light on the contribution of single genes to the outcome of inguinal and scrotal hernia in pigs.
