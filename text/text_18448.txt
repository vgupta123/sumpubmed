BACKGROUND
chicken anemia virus , is a non-enveloped virus and the causative agent of chicken anemia disease. the disease results in aplastic anemia, lymph organ atrophy and immunosuppression in chickens  <cit> . the virus transcribes and translates three viral proteins, vp <dig>  vp <dig> and vp <dig>  which are respectively encoded by orf <dig>  orf <dig> and orf <dig> of the cav genome. vp <dig> protein  is the sole structural protein of cav and is responsible for capsid assembly  <cit> . the vp <dig> protein  is a nonstructural protein that possesses a dual-specificity protein phosphatase   <cit> . the vp <dig> protein , also called apoptin, is a strong inducer of apoptosis in precursor chicken thymocytes and various human transformed and tumor cell lines but not in normal cells  <cit> . at present, the full anti-tumor mechanism of apoptin remains unclear. however, it is worth mentioning that apoptin-induced apoptosis in tumor cells is p53-independent and also is not suppressed by bcl- <dig> or bcr-abl protein  <cit> . thus, apoptin is thought to be a good candidate for use as a therapeutic protein and has potential to be developed as a cancer treatment, including those cancers that lack p <dig> 

to develop apoptin as an anti-cancer drug, efficient transduction tools such as recombinant virus and a recombinant plasmid within liposomes have been used to deliver apoptin into tumor cells  <cit> . however, these approaches have restrictions in terms of therapeutic application including a size limitation of the genes that can be delivered, insertional mutagenesis and transient expression  <cit> . novel cell-penetrating peptides, such as the trans-acting activator of transcription  protein transduction domain , which consists of  <dig> amino acid residues  have therefore been used as vectors for protein delivery  <cit> . with respect to apoptin, previously studies have been demonstrated that apoptin fused with a tat peptide shows apoptotic activity against tumor cells because the tat peptide’s delivery system is able to move apoptin into cells  <cit> .

up to the present, a number of different expression systems have been used to express apoptin, including e. coli, baculovirus-insect cells and plant cells  <cit> . however, production of recombinant full-length apoptin/vp <dig> protein has generally been possible only in e. coli <cit> . several production problems involving the expression efficiency and protein solubility of apoptin in e. coli have been encountered  <cit> . thus, there is a need to overcome these difficulties in order to scale-up production of full-length apoptin protein using an e. coli expression system. if successful, this would not only allow the efficient development of a therapeutic protein that is able to actively kill cancer cells specifically but the recombinant protein would also be potentially useful when developing diagnostic kits for the clinical detection of cav infection  <cit> .

it is clear that e. coli has a number of limitations and disadvantages in terms of the production of apoptin protein. however, expression of apoptin protein in e. coli is still an attractive alternative to the current production system when assessed in terms of cost, time and operational considerations. in this study, the cav vp <dig> gene was fused to a synthetic gene containing the trans-acting activator of transcription  protein transduction domain . this protein, named tat-apoptin, was expressed using various different expression vectors in order to evaluate tat-apoptin expression and production by a number of different e. coli strains. two expression vectors were used, one harboring a glutathione-s-transferase  tag and the other a 6xhis tag; these were investigated to explore the effect of these fusion tags on the expression of tat-apoptin in the various e. coli strains. in addition, changes in codon usage for various amino acids within the vp <dig> gene were also assessed in terms of their effect on expression of tat-apoptinopt. rare codons for e. coli within the vp <dig> gene of the tat-apoptin protein were optimized using prediction software and the preferred codon usage changed to that of e. coli. after this optimization, the expression levels of the modified vp <dig> genes were examined in various e. coli strains and the various production parameters for tat-apoptinopt protein expression assessed. to the best of our knowledge, the yield of e. coli expressed recombinant tat-apoptinopt in this study after codon optimization of the vp <dig> gene is the highest known to date.

RESULTS
a gst fusion tag improves the expression of recombinant tat-apoptin protein in e. coli
to develop apoptin protein as anti-tumor drug, a composite cdna of the cav vp <dig> gene fused synthetic gene of tat peptide was used to create two distinct expression constructs of tat-apoptin . these constructs, pet-tat-vp <dig> and pgex-tat-vp <dig>  were transformed into three different e. coli strains in order to investigate the effect of the fusion tags on the expression of tat-apoptin. the 6 × his and gst tags were fused with tat-apoptin at the n-terminus using the expression vectors pet28a and pgex-4 t- <dig>  respectively. the expression of these two tat-apoptin constructs in various e. coli strains was explored . when e. coli bl <dig> was used, significant amounts of full-length tat-apoptin protein were present in the whole cell lysate after iptg induction for 4 h with either pet-tat-vp <dig> or pgex-tat-vp <dig> . the 16 kda his-tat-apoptin and the 42 kda gst-tat-apoptin were detected using monoclonal anti-his antibody and anti-gst antibody, respectively . densitometric analysis of the blots showed that total expressed gst-tat-apoptin protein, both soluble and insoluble, from bl <dig> was approximately  <dig> fold greater than that of his-tat-apoptin produced under identical conditions . when his-tat-apoptin and gst-tat-apoptin were induced for between  <dig> and 4 h, the expression of both proteins continued to increase significantly over the 2-4 h induction range  with the highest amount of his-tat-apoptin protein produced being  <dig>  mg/ml at 4 h of iptg induction. in contrast, the highest amount of gst-tat-apoptin produced was  <dig>  mg/ml at 4 h. a similar pattern of expression was observed for the two proteins in bl21codonplus-rp and bl21plyss strains . the highest amounts of gst-tat-apoptin produced by bl21codonplus-rp and by bl21plyss were  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg/ml, respectively, after 4 h of iptg induction . the parallel results for his-tat-apoptin were  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg/ml, respectively . thus the gst fusion tag improved protein expression significantly and allowed large amounts of intact tat-apoptin protein to be produced.

vp <dig> gene encoding apoptin protein of cav is rich in e. coli rare codons
cav vp <dig> gene that encodes the apoptin protein consists of  <dig> amino acid codons. the rare codons for e. coli within the vp <dig> gene were pinpointed using the genscript rare codon analysis tool . the deduced amino acid sequence of apoptin was found to contain 15% basic amino acid residues such as arginine  and lysine  . overall, approximately 21% rare e. coli codons were present in the vp <dig> gene, including arginine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, cysteine, threonine, serine and glycine codons . the presence of these codons is one possible reason for the relatively poor expression of apoptin in e. coli.

enhancement of recombinant tat-apoptin protein expression in e. coli by optimizing the codon usage of the vp <dig> gene
we have shown that expression of full-length tat-apoptin in e. coli is improved by fusing a gst tag to the n-terminus of the tat-apoptin protein. however, adding a his tag to give his-tat-apoptin did not produce such a yield improvement even when the optimal host strain bl21plyss is used . therefore, we next explored the effect on tat-apoptin productivity of optimizing the codon usage of the vp <dig> gene for e. coli. the tat-apoptin gene was engineered such that aga/cga/cgg were changed to cgt or cgc , ccc/cct were changed to ccg or cca , ctc/cta/ttg were changed to ctg , ata was changed to atc , gga/ggg were changed to ggt , act/aca were changed to acc , and caa was changed to cag  . the codon optimized vp <dig> gene was then linked to the tat sequence at 5’ end of the vp <dig> gene to give an intact open reading frame. the new codon-optimized tat-vp <dig> gene, denoted tat-vp3opt, was then cloned into pgex-4 t- <dig> and pet28a to give pgex-tat-vp3opt and pet-tat-vp3opt, respectively . these plasmids were then individually expressed in e. coli. when expression in e. coli strain bl <dig> using whole cell lysate was analyzed by sds-page and western blotting, both gst-tat-apoptinopt and his-tat-apoptinopt were successfully expressed after iptg induction  with a yield after 4 h iptg induction of about 9 mg/ml and  <dig>  mg/ml, respectively. the yield of gst-tat-apoptinopt was almost  <dig> fold higher than his-tat-apoptinopt  . bl21-plyss, similarly, gave increased expression of both his- tat-apoptinopt and gst-tat-apoptinopt . the highest yields of gst-tat-apoptinopt and his-tat-apoptinopt in bl21plyss were obtained after 4 h iptg induction and were  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg/ml, respectively . these results confirm that the codon-optimized of tat-apoptin improved protein expression significantly and allowed large amounts of intact tat-apoptinopt protein to be produced in either e. coli bl <dig> or bl21plyss with either fusion tag.

effect of cultivation temperature and iptg concentration on the protein solubility of e. coli-expressed gst-tat-apoptinopt
in addition to the expression level of tat-apoptinopt, the solubility of tat-apoptinopt protein is also needs to examine and improved. to this end, the cultivation parameters and their effect on the tat-apoptinopt protein solubility were explored, namely cultivation temperature and the iptg concentration for induction; gst-tat-apoptinopt was used as the model protein. protein solubility and the expression levels of gst-tat-apoptinopt were determined using e. coli bl <dig>  at 25 °c and 37 °c. as shown in figure 6a, an increased amount of soluble gst-tat-apoptinopt was obtained after iptg induction at 25 °c. approximately 15% and 65% of the gst-tat-apoptinopt in the whole cell lysate of the bl <dig> strain was soluble at 37 °c and 25 °c, respectively. in addition, the amounts of gst-tat-apoptinopt protein expressed in bl <dig> were  <dig>  mg/ml and  <dig>  mg/ml, respectively, at 25 °c and 37 °c after 4 h iptg induction ; thus the total amount of gst-tat-apoptinopt protein obtained at 25 °c compared to 37 °c was only very slightly lower .

when various iptg induction concentration from  <dig>  to 1 mm were explored for protein induction, the highest amount of gst-tat-apoptinopt protein obtained was with 1 mm iptg induction using the bl <dig> strain  and this gave about 65% soluble protein at 25 °c . the expression level of gst-tat-apoptinopt at  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm iptg was lower than for 1 mm iptg , but the amount of soluble protein was highest at  <dig>  mm  iptg . thus a lower cultivation temperature of 25 °c and an iptg concentration of  <dig>  mm iptg were able to produce the higher amount of soluble gst-tat-apoptinopt protein.

purification of recombinant gst-tat-apoptinopt protein using gst affinity chromatography
using the approximately 95% soluble gst-tat-apoptinopt expressed by e. coli at 25 °c and  <dig>  mm iptg, the lysate was subjected to purification using a gst affinity column. after affinity chromatography, the eluted soluble gst-tat-apoptinopt protein was confirmed antigenically using anti-gst antibody and cav-infected positive serum . a typical elution profile of the protein fractions collected from a gst column is shown in figure 8a after separation by sds-page. fraction  <dig> contains the most eluted protein, has a significant absorbent peak at od <dig> and was eluted at 12 min . the specific 42 kda band eluted in fraction  <dig> was almost purified to homogenicity . when the purified gst-tat-apoptinopt protein was examined by maldi-tof, seven peptides from gst-tat-apoptinopt could be identified after trypsin digestion and these demonstrated good alignment and a high score when compared to the predicted protein . the longest peptide fragment, vnelkeslitttpsrpr, consists of  <dig> amino acid residues and overall the coverage was  <dig> % of the published amino acid sequence of apoptin  without any miss-match . these maldi-tof results confirmed that the purified 42 kda protein is gst-tat-apoptinopt and that the e. coli preferred codon usage optimization within the vp <dig> gene has not altered either the amino acid sequence  or the antigenicity  of the protein.

recombinant gst-tat-apoptinopt protein has apoptotic activity and induces apoptosis in hl-60
to investigate whether gst-tat-apoptinopt protein expressed by e. coli has apoptotic activity when introduced into tumor cells, purified gst-tat-apoptinopt protein was used to examine the protein's apoptotic activity when it was used to treat human premyelocytic leukemia hl- <dig> cells. as illustrated in figure  <dig>  flow cytometry analysis by annexin-v fitc and propidium iodide staining showed an approximately 10% increase in the level of apoptotic levels among hl- <dig> cells that were co-cultured with gst-tat-apoptinopt compared to hl- <dig> cells only, hl- <dig> co-cultured with gst or chromatographic elution buffer. however, compared to the control, hl- <dig> cells co-cultured with gst-tat-apoptinopt induced less apoptosis than when hl- <dig> cells were induced into apoptosis by treatment with cyclohexamide . nevertheless, gst-tat-apoptinopt was able to induce apoptosis in hl- <dig> cells to a meaningful degree. these results indicate that e.coli expressed gst-tat-apoptinopt retains the protein’s original apoptotic activity when used to treated hl- <dig> cells even after the modifications carried out in this study.

discussion
apoptin from chicken anemia virus has been demonstrated to have apoptotic activity and to be able to specifically kill several types of tumor cells including the cell lines hela, saos- <dig>  lung cancer cells h <dig> and hepg <dig>  <cit> . apoptin is not only p <dig> and bcl- independent, but also does not require specific post-modification in order to be able to induce apoptosis  <cit> . therefore, apoptin has great potential to be developed into a protein drug that will be useful as part of the cancer therapy armory. in this context, previously studies have shown that fusing the tat peptide to apoptin, in order to create a recombinant protein vehicle, which allows protein uptake by cells, improves protein translocation into the cell and increases saos- <dig> cell killing  <cit> . this approach is a useful was of overcoming problems associated with the delivery of apoptin into cells without affecting the anti-cancer activity of the protein. however, up to the present, few studies have investigated anti-cancer activity using such a recombinant tat-apoptin protein. the main reason for this lack of progress is the poor expression and low protein solubility of tat-apoptin. previous studies have shown that the large-scale production of recombinant tat-apoptin using a prokaryotic expression is difficult and therefore this has become a bottle-neck  <cit> . even today, in spite of the fact that many eukaryotic expression systems are well established, various factors, such as cost-effectiveness, insertional mutagenesis and transient expression, still need to be resolved for these systems. taking the above into consideration, the effective production of tat-apoptin protein using a prokaryotic system is a crucial key step in developing this protein drug as an anti-tumor therapy. therefore, in this study, the specific aim was to develop a prokaryotic expression system that allowed the efficient production of recombinant tat-apoptin protein. using a prokaryotic expression system to express heterologous recombinant protein has several advantages including time-savings, cost-effectiveness, ease of production, simplified characterization and others. it is for these reasons that e. coli is the most used expression system when evaluating the expression of a foreign protein  <cit> . indeed, the above points are some of the critical factors associated with choosing a suitable production system when developing a protein drug. to this end, problems associated with having a truly effective system for the large-scale production of apoptin protein still needed to be explored.

to improve protein expression and to enhance the solubility of any protein produced in an e. coli expression system, a number of strategies are available. these include cultivation parameters, the effect of fusing the protein to an affinity tag and the optimization of codon usage of foreign gene for e. coli. all of these have been frequently employed to improve the amount of recombinant protein recovered  <cit> . in the present study, we first explored the effect of two different fusion tags on tat-apoptin expression, although others remain available, are untested as yet and may further improve the yield in the future. the presence of a gst fusion tag was found to significantly improve the yield of tat-apoptin compared to a 6 × his tag . in a previous study, liu et al successfully overcame the problem of less efficient expression in e. coli of porcine circovirus  by fusing the maltose-binding protein  to an 8xhis tag  <cit> . the main mechanism by which the mbp-8xhis tag improved protein expression remains unclear. however, one possibility is improved protein solubility  <cit> . similarly, in our previous study, the addition of a gst tag to the cav vp <dig> protein also improved expression in e. coli significantly compared to a his ×  <dig> tag  <cit> . thus it would seem that some fusion tags are able to improve expression of soluble protein in e. coli compared to other tags, perhaps by aiding the correct folding of their fused partner  <cit> .

next we investigated which of three different e. coli strains, bl <dig>  bl21plyss and bl21codonplus-rp, was able to improve protein production and yield. with both gst-tat-apoptin and his-tat-apoptin, bl <dig> was preferred and produced more tat-apoptin protein than either bl21plyss or bl21codonplus-rp . it is worth noting that bl21plyss has a higher growth rate than bl <dig> or bl21codonplus-rp when expressing his-tat-apoptin . this discrepancy may involve either poor protein stability or the cytotoxic nature of his-tat-apoptin when present in bl <dig> and bl21codonplus-rp. these results are similar to those obtained for the production of gst-vp <dig> protein from cav in e. coli at low expression levels  <cit> . bl21plyss superiority may be due to the presence in the strain of the plyss plasmid during protein induction  <cit> . this difference may enable bl21plyss to tolerate cytotoxicity associated with the expression of t <dig> lysozyme by attenuating the transcription leakage by t <dig> rna polymerase  <cit> . however, this phenomenon was not important when gst-tat-apoptin was expressed and the growth profiles of the three strains producing gst-tat-apoptin were almost identical on induction by iptg. in this area, it is possible that the cytotoxicity of gst-tat-apoptin may be less that that of his-tat-apoptin in bl <dig> and bl21codonplus-rp  <cit> . furthermore, the phenomenon of “protein burden” may not have been encountered when bl <dig> was used to express gst-tat-apoptin  <cit> . it was concluded that bl <dig> is the preferred choice for expression of gst-tat-apoptin.

rosenberg et al have proposed that the abundance of a rare codon near the 5’-end of the gene might affect the efficiency of protein translation  <cit> . if this is true, then the approach used in the present study to modify the codon usage in the gene ought to improve the expression of full-length apoptin protein. when genscript optimumgenetm bioinformatic software was used to identify rare codons in e. coli that exist in the wild-type cav vp <dig> gene, the pinpointed amino acid residues included arginine, leucine, proline and lysine; these are commonly found in the n-terminus and c-terminus regions of the apoptin protein. after codon optimization of cav vp <dig> gene, tat-apoptinopt was fused with both tags and successful expressed in e. coli . the amount of expressed gst-tat-apoptinopt in e. coli was substantially higher than that of gst-tat-apoptin and his-tat-apoptinopt when bl <dig> or bl21plyss were used . thus codon optimization within vp <dig> gene of the rare codons in e. coli was able to improve the expression level of tat-apoptin; specifically translation efficiency was improved without the need to supply extra copies of the rare trna genes  <cit> . interestingly, in terms of growth, bl <dig> and bl21plyss performed almost identically when expressing gst-tat-apoptin . however, the growth rate of bl21plyss was significantly slower than that of bl <dig> when expressing gst-tat-apoptinopt . this might be explained in terms of the “protein burden” within bl21plyss when it is producing gst-tat-apoptinopt at a relatively high level early during induction and this protein burden may eventually result in bl21plyss undergoing growth arrest. the growth profile of bl <dig> expressing gst-tat-apoptinopt may involve the balancing of the steady-state growth conditions for the strain with the yield and also suggests that this strain had reached the maximum possible growth rate; as a result the growth profile of bl <dig> during the expression of gst-tat-apoptinopt did not significantly change . in contrast, when producing his-tat-apoptinopt, the growth profiles of bl <dig> and bl21plyss were very similar to the situation when the strains were producing his-tat-apoptin . one possible explanation for this is that the level of produced his-tat-apoptin or his-tat-apoptinopt did not reach the threshold value where there was a protein burden and therefore no growth arrest occurred.

ae. colistrains were cultured at 37 °c.

be. colistrains were cultured at 25 °c.

the presence of a fusion tag and optimization of the codon usage within the gene were both useful strategies for improving the production of tat-apoptin . when compared, the increase level in yield obtained when a fusion tag was used seems to be greater than that derived from codon optimization . specifically, the yield was only increased from  <dig>  mg/ml  to  <dig>  mg/ml  was expressed in bl <dig> 

in order to improve the protein stability of tat-apoptin, various cultivation parameters were adjusted. although a cultivation temperature of 37 °c was able to produce a higher growth rate and greater protein yield, this temperature did not produce a high yield of soluble protein. when 25 °c was used or when a lower iptg concentration was used , it was not only possible to obtain a similar expression level of tat-apoptin within 6 hrs , but there was also a significant improvement in protein solubility . recovering soluble tat-apoptin using the gst tag as an affinity ligand during the purification process is highly convenient in terms of downstream processing. after gst affinity chromatography, approximately 80% of the gst-tat-apoptin produced by the e. coli was recovered and recovery of gst-tat-apoptin even reached over 90% with one batch . the purified target protein can then be subjected to further purification steps in order to obtain a protein drug with high purity.

in this study, human premyelocytic leukemia hl- <dig> cells were used to evaluate the apoptotic activity of the e. coli-expressed tat-apoptin. apoptosis was induced when the hl- <dig> cells were co-cultured with  <dig> ug/ml of gst column purified gst-tat-apoptinopt. there was a 10% increase in apoptosis compared to the non-apoptosis control . however, this is less apoptosis than that induced by chx, which is the positive apoptosis control. previous studies have reported that approximately 70% of tumor cells undergoing apoptosis in the presence of apoptin  <cit> . this discrepancy may be a result of differences in the tumor cell lines used, which may have different levels of tolerance with respect to apoptin. in addition, the tat-apoptin carried the gst fusion tag had not undergo protease cleavage before use and the presence of the tag may have affected the protein drug's apoptotic activity during co-culture with the tumor cells. nevertheless, it is clear that the e. coli-expressed gst-tat-apoptinopt produced in the present study does retain its anti-tumor cell activity and the ability to induce apoptosis.

CONCLUSIONS
the expression of recombinant full-length tat-apoptin protein was established successfully herein using a prokaryotic system, and the yield was significantly improved by fusing the protein with an affinity tag and by optimizing the codon usage of the polypeptide for expression in e. coli. direct engineering of the apoptin protein was a convenient and cost-effective strategy of increasing the expression of tat-apoptin protein in e. coli. this paves the way for the large-scale production of tat-apoptin protein using this approach. in the future, this will also allow tat-apoptin to be used for the development of a protein drug that has anti-cancer activity or as part of a cav diagnostic test.
