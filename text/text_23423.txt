BACKGROUND
the mitochondrial electron transport chain, a central component of cellular energy production, relies on the coevolution of mitochondrial- and nuclear-encoded genes to function  <cit> . mito-nuclear coevolution is however easily disrupted because genomes have different mutation rates, modes of inheritance, number and speed of recombination events, effective population size and selection pressures  <cit> . such disruption can cause the emergence and maintenance of mito-nuclear incompatibilities  that are described by the dobzhansky-muller model  <cit> .

dobzhansky-muller incompatibilities have been implicated in intrinsic post-zygotic barriers  <cit>  and involved in mito-nuclear gene interactions in the fruit fly drosophila  <cit> , the parasitoid wasp nasonia  <cit> , the atlantic eel anguilla  <cit>  and the marine copepod trigriopus californicus  <cit> . studying reproductive isolation is especially relevant in the marine environment, where many marine organisms have a high fecundity, large population sizes and a high dispersive potential  <cit> , and where physical barriers to dispersal are not readily apparent. endogenous barriers to gene flow may therefore be an important factor structuring marine populations in this environment. in addition, marine taxa can be sensitive to glaciation cycles that can promote the establishment of secondary contact zones and therefore lead to admixture of genetically divergent backgrounds  <cit> .

in this context, the baltic clam macoma balthica  is a noteworthy model for studying the role of mnis in structuring marine populations. this infaunal tellinid bivalve occurs on sandy-mud flats from the upper intertidal to the subtidal, in parts of the northern hemisphere. its natural european range extends from eastern russia  to southern france . ma. balthica is characterized by a complex colonization history in europe. with the opening of the bering strait, several trans-arctic invasion events of pacific populations into the atlantic have occurred, leading to secondary contact of divergent lineages in the bay of biscay  <cit>  and in the baltic and white seas  <cit> , allowing gene flow between previously-isolated populations. the long periods of reproductive isolation between these populations  represent strong potential for the accumulation of genetic incompatibilities.

a recent fst scan based on transcriptome data highlighted outlier loci coding for nuclear subunits of the fof1-atp synthase complex  and a putative isoform of the nadh deshydrogenase  <cit> , which are involved in the oxidative phosphorylation  mitochondrial chain  <cit> . these protein complexes are composed of subunits encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial genes  <cit>  and require tight mito-nuclear coevolution to be fully operational. they are therefore prime candidates for the establishment of mnis following secondary contact between previously allopatric populations  <cit> , which may constitute endogenous barriers to gene flow.

sequences from only two mitochondrial genes have been published to date for this species . to work toward the diagnosis of mnis in ma. balthica and further test the hypothesis of mito-nuclear coevolution breakdown among ma. balthica lineages, additional mitochondrial data are therefore required for comparison with the nuclear transcriptomic data at hand. although several mitogenomes have been sequenced for marine bivalves  only one is currently available for the tellinidae . however, mitochondrial sequences of mo. iridescens are highly divergent from those of ma. balthica . we have therefore set to sequence the mitogenomes of six ma. balthica individuals spanning two secondary contact zones  to test whether mitochondrial genes interacting with previously-detected nuclear outlier loci show stronger divergence and selection pressures, compared to other mitochondrial genes. our intents were  to detect and map protein-coding genes  involved in the oxpho chain,  to estimate the degree of divergence and selection pressures across lineages for all pcgs, and  to map mutations onto predicted secondary structure of mitochondrial membrane-embedded protein to help detect potential incompatibilities among mitochondrial and nuclear oxpho subunits. in particular, we characterize a putative atp <dig> gene and discuss its functionality, as  it is absent in about half of the published bivalve mitogenomes, and  its role is potentially relevant to the study of mnis in ma. balthica.

methods
sample collection and dna extraction
previous work on ma. balthica suggested the presence of at least three divergent mitochondrial clades in europe  <cit> , which were targeted in our sampling: a baltic lineage, and two atlantic lineages that are separated by the french finistère peninsula. ma. balthica specimens were collected from  <dig> to  <dig>  and  <dig>  along european coasts, ranging from aytré, france to tvärminne, finland . total genomic dna was extracted from foot muscle tissue using the dneasy™ tissue kit  following the manufacturer's protocol and stored at −20°c until further analyses.table  <dig>

haplotype


initially eight mitogenomes were sequenced, corresponding to two individuals per mitochondrial lineage, as inferred from 313 bp of cox <dig> by becquet et al.  <cit>  . six nearly-complete mitogenomes were eventually obtained, as long-range pcr  failed for two individuals. they correspond to cox <dig> haplotypes h <dig> to h <dig> . h1-h <dig> were originally described in  <cit>  and h <dig> is a newly described haplotype.

primer design and long-range pcr amplification of mtdna
three pairs of primers were designed using primer-blast  <cit>  to amplify the mitochondrial genome of ma. balthica . the first two pairs were designed based on cox <dig> and cox <dig> sequences available on genbank for ma. balthica  <cit> . primer length was maximized  to enhance stability during long-range pcr . when the two-step mitogenome amplification did not succeed, one additional primer set  was used to prime within rrnl. these three primer pairs allowed the amplification of  <dig> to  <dig>  kbp. lr-pcr products were visualised by electrophoresis on a  <dig> % agarose gel stained with gelred™  to assess quality.

library preparation and dna sequencing
the quantity of lr-pcr dna templates  was assessed by spectrophotometry , fluorometry  and quantitative pcr . after quality controls, six libraries  were prepared using the truseq dna sample prep kits v <dig> and truseq universal adapters . a truseq universal adapter was used for each dna library in order to separate reads from different individuals after dna sequencing. library sizes were checked on bioanalyzer chips . paired-end library sequencing was carried out on the illumina miseq plateform  at the get-plage lab .

sequence cleaning, trimming, assembly and gene annotation
genomes were assembled in two rounds, using different read quality filters and assembly parameters, to optimize contig length while controlling for quality. in the first round, reads were de-multiplexed and quality-filtered  using the fastx toolkit . duplicated sequences were removed and adapters were clipped. sequences  were checked for quality before and after fastx filtering using fastqc v. <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . assembly was performed in velvet v. <dig> . <dig>  <cit> , and parameters  were optimized using a custom r script to minimize the number of contigs and maximize contig lengths . optimized k-mer sizes were 89 bp , 97 bp , 103 bp , 107 bp  and 119 bp . optimized k-mer coverages were  <dig>  and  <dig> . assemblies were checked in tablet v. <dig> . <dig>   <cit> .

in the second round of assemblies, we used more stringent quality filters , and fixed k-mer length and k-mer coverage to 247 bp and  <dig>  respectively. in the second assembly, contigs from the first round were used as a reference; sanger sequences for parts of the cox <dig> and cox <dig> genes were included to fill the gaps flanking the lr-pcr primer sequences. sanger sequencing was performed by gatc biotech  using an abi 3730xl automated dna analyzer .

all contigs from the first and second assemblies and parts of cox <dig>  cox <dig> sequences were aligned using sequencher™ v. <dig> . <dig> . resulting contigs  were searched on genbank  in order to control for contaminants. we also searched for the presence of these contigs among the  <dig> transcriptome sequences available for ma. balthica  <cit>  using a local blast database and tblastx . mitochondrial genome annotations were then performed on the mitos webserver, first using default parameters  <cit>  and second using advanced parameters  in order to improve annotation quality and start/stop codon delimitation.

quality control and gene boundary delimitation
mitochondrial genomes were aligned using sequencher™ and each ambiguity and indel was individually checked by eye in tablet. the gene boundaries automatically detected by mitos were checked individually in sequencher™ to correct for misalignments. the location and size of the  <dig> pcgs were evaluated by comparing the location of start and stop codons with that of published mitochondrial genomes . congruence among the pcg hydrophobic profiles of these species was assessed using unipro ugene v <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . the map of mitogenome of ma. balthica was produced using genomevx  <cit> .

trna and atp <dig> protein structure characterization
trna secondary structures were inferred using mitos in default search mode  <cit> . gc content was calculated with ugene. predictions of transmembrane alpha-helices and hydrophilic helices for the atp <dig> protein were inferred with tmhmm v. <dig>   <cit>  and were compared with previously characterized atp <dig> proteins from other bivalves. atp <dig> amino-acid sequences were aligned with muscle v. <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  with manual adjustments and a graphical representation was prepared using texshade  <cit> .

genetic divergence and phylogenetic analysis
genetic divergence among four pairs of haplotypes of ma. balthica individuals was analyzed using the ape v. <dig> - <dig>  <cit>  and seqinr v. <dig> - <dig>  <cit>  r packages  <cit> . the tn <dig>  <cit>  model of nucleotide substitution was determined as the most likely for our dataset based on the bic scores calculated in jmodeltest  <dig>  <cit> . tn <dig> genetic distances within and between specimens with different cox <dig> haplotypes were calculated within a 200 bp window sliding every 10 bp.

nucleotide diversity for synonymous  and non-synonymous  substitutions was calculated across all pcgs for all mitogenomes  and ma. balthica rubra mitogenomes , using a 200 bp window sliding every 10 bp . haplotype networks for each of the  <dig> pcgs were built using the ape and pegas v. <dig> - <dig>  <cit>  r packages. finally, the secondary structure of pcgs was inferred with protter v. <dig>   <cit> . fisher’s exact tests  were computed on each pcg to test for the random distribution of  all mutations and  non-synonymous mutations across mitochondrial compartments .

RESULTS
mitochondrial genome assembly and annotation
one illumina miseq run produced  <dig>  m raw reads, representing  <dig>  gbp after quality filtering . gc content varied between  <dig> and 40% . the second round of genome assemblies yielded a median contig size  of  <dig>  bp and a maximum contig size averaging  <dig>  bp.

mitochondrial genome organization, pcgs & codon usage
six nearly complete mitochondrial genomes from five mitochondrial lineages  were obtained. the mitogenome of individual a <dig> from aytré is considered as our reference genome hereon. the size of the mitogenome is estimated at  <dig>  bp . it is composed of  <dig> genes, including  <dig> pcgs among which an atp <dig> gene, two ribosomal rna genes and  <dig> transfer rna genes . all genes are encoded on the same strand, and gene arrangement is identical among the six mitogenomes sequenced.table  <dig>

, based on specimen a <dig>  ncr indicates the largest non-coding region.



in total, pcgs encode  <dig>  amino acids . with a size of  <dig>  bp , nad <dig> is the largest pcgs and cox <dig>  nad <dig>  cob and nad <dig> genes exceed  <dig>  bp. conversely, nad <dig> and nad4l genes are smaller than 400 bp lengths and atp <dig> gene is the smallest gene with 129 bp .

five different initiation codons were identified. three pcgs begin with att , three with atg  and three with ata . the last one is classically found in the invertebrate mitochondrial genetic code, particularly in bivalves. four nad genes start with ntg codons, corresponding to atg , ttg  and gtg . by contrast, pcgs are most often terminated by taa  rather than tag . these stop codons correspond to the only two possible combinations in the current invertebrate mitochondrial genetic code.

transfer and ribosomal rna genes
the mitogenome of ma. balthica is composed of  <dig> trna genes, which range in size from  <dig> to 69 bp. all of them fold into cloverleaf secondary structures with four arms, some of them presenting folding differences . four trna  have a small supplemental stem loop, trnaasn has not terminal tΨc loop, trnaser <dig> has the dihydrouracil  stem replaced by a big dhu loop and three discriminator nucleotides were detected instead of the single nucleotide usually presents at the 5' end. finally, trnaala, trnaleu <dig> and trnaval do not possess a discriminator nucleotide.

rrns and rrnl have respective lengths of 880 bp and  <dig>  bp, and an at content of  <dig> % and  <dig> %. among specimens, average divergence is low . overall, the same trna and rrna features characterize all six mitogenomes of ma. balthica.

non-coding regions: intergenic spacers and putative cr
intergenic nucleotides represent  <dig>  bp in total , and are divided into  <dig> non-coding regions . the largest ncr is about  <dig>  bp long , is located between rrns and trnamet and is thought to contain the control region . the putative cr could not be fully sequenced  due to its high at content  and numerous tandem repeat motifs, but its size was estimated based on pcr products visualized by gel electrophoresis in strongly denaturing conditions. the other  <dig> ncrs ranged from  <dig> to 121 bp. three overlapping gene regions were detected .

characterisation of a putative atp <dig> gene
local tblastx searches detected the full set of  <dig> mitochondrial pcgs characterized here among the  <dig> transcriptome sequences available for ma. balthica  <cit> , including an atp <dig>  a gene long reported as rare in bivalves. this is the first record of an atp <dig> gene in the tellinidae. up to now, this gene had not been highlighted in mo. iridescens  <cit> . however, using the same data analysis approach as ma. balthica, an atp <dig> gene was also detected between trnamet and trnaser <dig> in publicly available mo. iridescens sequences. indeed, out of  <dig> mitogenomes of bivalves freely available on genbank database, atp <dig> gene had been detected in only  <dig> species.

in ma. balthica, this short gene was detected between trnamet and trnaser <dig> and is separated from atp <dig> by  <dig>  bp. it encodes a  <dig> aa protein  terminated by a complete stop codon . conversely to other bivalves , but as in mo. iridescens, atp <dig> protein starts with an isoleucine rather than a methionine. despite an important length polymorphism in bivalve atp <dig> , 5/ <dig> aa in ma. balthica are shared among all investigated bivalves with an atp <dig>  and within the tellinidae, mo. iridescens and ma. balthica have a 84% aa identity.

secondary structure is highly conserved. indeed, ma. balthica atp <dig> hydrophobicity patterns are congruent with the typical transmembraneous protein pattern for this gene in bivalves . it is composed of a central hydrophobic part corresponding to a transmembraneous helix  and two hydrophilic n-terminus  and c-terminus  extremities. these two domains are positively charged whereas the central part is encoded by negatively charged aa. tmhmm transmembraneous helix prediction of the atp <dig> protein from ma. balthica are congruent with these observations.figure  <dig>

pcgs: sequence divergence and polymorphism
pcg-specific haplotype network topologies  differ in resolution  but present nearly identical evolutionary relationships. the ma. balthica balthica  and ma. balthica rubra  lineages are the most divergent; within the ma. balthica rubra clade , w <dig> is separated from w <dig> and other, more southern individuals.

some regions  are highly conserved and mutations are not evenly distributed along the  <dig> pcgs . the tn <dig> distance among the six mitogenomes ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> %  contrasting with  <dig>  to  <dig> % within intra-rubra . the seven nad genes are highly mutated in comparison to the four cytochrome genes and two atp genes . a10-f <dig> is the most divergent specimen pair  compared to other specimen pairs .figure  <dig>

the ratio of intraspecific nucleotide diversity at non-synonymous  and synonymous  sites is lower when including both subspecies  than within the intra-rubra group . overall, the nad gene group exhibits higher values of πa/πs than the atp and cytochrome genes . among ma. balthica lineages, πa/πs was most elevated in nad <dig>  nad <dig>  nad <dig>  nad <dig> and unexpectedly in cox <dig> . the same pattern  was observed in the intra-rubra group . interestingly πa/πs ratios for these four nad genes are slightly higher in the intra-rubra group than among ma. balthica lineages . minimal πa/πs ratio values were obtained in atp <dig>   <dig>  cox <dig>   <dig> and cob genes .table  <dig>

1global divergence: min - max range  calculated using the tn <dig> model of nucleotide substitutions, as for figure  <dig> 

the number of aa changes  is given for each gene overall and for the extra-, inter- and intra-membranous organellar compartments, as delimited in protter . the distribution of aa changes across different organellar compartments provides a preliminary roadmap for searching for mnis. the positions of aa sites bearing synonymous and non-synonymous mutations are mapped on the inferred protein secondary structures presented in additional file  <dig> 



synonymous and non-synonymous mutations were mapped onto the pcg secondary structured inferred by protter in order to evaluate the potential for mnis . while the sliding window analysis was run using pairs of individuals, the protter analyses were run jointly on all samples. mutation mapping among ma. balthica lineages reveals that nad <dig>  cox <dig>  nad <dig>  atp <dig> and nad4l are the most mutated pcgs , whereas only 11% of cob and cox <dig> are mutated . other pcgs possess intermediate divergence levels, which varied from  <dig> to 16%. within intra-rubra group, the most mutated genes are nad <dig>  cox <dig>  nad <dig> and nad <dig> , and atp <dig> was one of the most conserved genes, with cox <dig> and cob . on average nad genes have more aa bearing bp mutations than any other genes . the number of non-synonymous mutations was twice higher among ma. balthica lineages than within the intra-rubra group , with a maximum occurrence observed within the nad <dig> and nad <dig> genes . by contrast to nad genes, atp <dig> and atp <dig> genes present few non-synonymous mutations . finally, the type and number of mutations were not influenced by the location of the mutation relative to the mitochondrial membrane .

discussion
general mitogenome features
studies of metazoan mtdna have revealed a large degree of variation in gene order that can be explained by multiple rearrangement events as inversions, transpositions, inverse transpositions . in bivalves, on average, the number of mtdna pcgs is 37 ±  <dig>  <cit> , and genome architecture varies depending on the subclass. members of paleoheterodonta present the same gene order whereas pteriomorpha and most importantly heterodonta  are widely rearranged .

the mitogenome of ma. balthica  is among the smallest within the heterodonts  ranging between acanthocardia tuberculata  and venerupis philippinarum . the mitogenomes of ma. balthica and mo. iridescens  <cit>  are similar in pcg length but present some differences in their start and stop codons. genomic architecture is generally highly conserved within mollusc species. for example, the mitogenomes of two individuals of the clam meretrix lamarckii have the same number and order of genes, slightly differed in length, and have identical amino-acid sequences  <cit> . similarly, total genome length varied by < 1% among the six mitogenomes sequenced here, and genome organisation was identical.

atp <dig>  a dispensable gene in bivalves?
in metazoans, the number of genes is highly conserved  and deviations from this number are rare. among pcgs, the atp synthase complex can be encoded by a maximum of three different genes corresponding to mitochondrial subunits  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . however, in many bivalves, especially heterondonts, atp <dig> is lacking, as in the mactridae , arcticidae , solenidae  <cit> , semelidae, solecurtidae and psammobiidae  <cit> . the first bivalve atp <dig> was detected in  <cit>  and was later found in the cardiidae  <cit> , lucinidae  and veneridae . here, the atp <dig> gene is reported for the first time in the tellinidae. strongly divergent features of atp <dig> among bivalves  could have previously hampered the annotation of this gene in the tellinidae  <cit> . in other terms, this gene may evolve so fast in bivalves that it may be missed by homology analyses  <cit> . in mussels, Śmietanka et al.  <cit>  highlighted that the number of nucleotide substitutions in pcgs is in average three times faster in the male mitochondrial lineage than in the female lineage, and varied differentially between respiratory complexes . strong divergence and fast evolution of this gene could also explain why it was not originally detected in mo. iridescens.

overall, gene length is highly variable among phyla , raising the question of its role and dispensability in the functionality of the atp synthase complex  <cit> . to date, the role of atp <dig> stays unclear and little documented in metazoans. the n- and c-terminal domains of atp <dig> seem to be involved in atp synthase activity, particularly assembly and function of the fo rotor  <cit>  and was reported as an essential module in the stator stalk of yeast mtatpase  <cit> . stephens et al.  <cit>  have demonstrated that the n- and c-terminal parts of yeast atp <dig> were located in the intermembranous space and the mitochondrial matrix, respectively, while the rest of the protein was a transmembraneous, central hydrophobic domain. our results in ma. balthica are congruent with these observations, supporting the potential functionality of the atp <dig> protein.

some reviews  <cit>  have attempted to make the link between atp <dig> functionality and its genomic position relative to atp <dig>  indeed, as mentioned by boore  <cit> , in mammals these two pcgs are "translated from a bicistronic transcript, with translation initiating alternatively at the 5′ end of the mrna for atp <dig> or at an internal start codon for atp <dig> " usually, these two genes are adjoined on the same strand, with overlapping reading frame  <cit> . nonetheless, they can also be physically separated while both retaining functionality. alternatively, atp <dig> may be disjoint from atp <dig> and non functional . in ma. balthica, atp <dig> and atp <dig> are separated by  <dig>  bp but seemed to lead to functional proteins . this arrangement could be an "evolutionary stepping stone from the fully functional atp6-atp <dig> coupling, via decoupled but complete genes"  <cit> .

yeast atp <dig> is thought to interact with atp synthase subunits b, f,  <dig> and is also able to cross-link with stator subunit d  <cit> . moreover, assembly of subunits  <dig> and  <dig> into atp synthase requires direct interactions between them  <cit> . yeast fo-f1-atp synthase requires five indispensable subunits  for stator stalk stabilization and loss of any one of these subunits results in a deep functional uncoupling between the f <dig> stator and the fo rotor . this gene, if functional, may therefore coevolve with other atp synthase subunits, and be involved in mnis. indeed, the sixth aa of the c-terminal domain of atp <dig> is different in the ma. balthica balthica and ma. balthica rubra lineages, and multiple non-synonymous mutations were detected in the inter-membranous loops of atp <dig>  furthermore, substitution of only one aa is sufficient to change protein stability  <cit> . this adaptive change could induce conformational modifications and impacted functionality role of pcgs.

pcgs: polymorphism, divergence and selective pressure
a previous fst scan based on nuclear transcriptome data, between populations of ma. balthica spanning the same two secondary contact zones as considered here, detected strong population structure at several genes involved in the atp synthase and nadh deshydrogenase complexes  <cit> . these complexes both rely on the coevolution of multiple nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded protein subunits, and could therefore suffer from mnis. nuclear and mitochondrial data converge toward positive selection pressures on the nadh dehydrogenase . the nad gene group is characterized by high polymorphism levels and high relative prevalence of replacement mutations compared to other pcgs. in particular, the nad <dig> and nad <dig> genes were rich in replacement mutations. comparing the mitogenomes of the european and american eels , jacobsen et al.  <cit>  found some evidence for positive selection on atp <dig>  and nad <dig>  inter-populational comparisons in the copepod tigriopus californicus revealed that nad <dig> was also among the most divergent pcgs, and displayed dn/ds ratios that were twice as elevated as other pcgs  <cit> . similarly, gibson et al.  <cit>  have recently shown that hybrid breakdown in nasonia parasitoid wasps is likely partly due to incompatibilities between nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded oxpho genes of complex i. they identified the nuclear gene ndufa <dig>  coding for a subunit of the nadh dehydrogenase complex as strongly affected by transmission ratio distortion and marked by a prevalence of replacement mutations far greater than what was measured for other nuclear oxpho genes  <cit> . complex i ensures essential functions in the oxpho chain, as it initiates electron transport system  and interacts with the oxpho complexes ii and iii. differential evolution of the mitochondrial- and nuclear-encoded nadh dehydrogenase subunits may therefore lead to coadaptation breakdown and possibly to mnis. further, because of its key role in the oxpho chain, dysfunction of complex i may severely affect all processes downstream of the oxpho chain, and, ultimately, atp production.

the mitochondrial atp <dig> and atp <dig> genes were not detected as outlier mitochondrial genes among the six individuals sequenced based on the number of non-synonymous mutations and πa/πs ratios. this result contrasted with previous data, in which several nuclear-encoded atp synthase subunits were highlighted as potentially being under positive selection  <cit> . several factors could explain this result. first, the very small sample size used here  may have prevented us from detecting significant adaptive polymorphism. indeed, the transcriptomic data suggested an asymmetric gene flow at the nuclear locus coding for the gamma subunit of atp synthase, with a northern allele being apparently fixed in populations north of brittany, and present in about 25% of reads in the population south of brittany . it is therefore possible that the individuals selected here were not representative of the genetic diversity at mitochondrial atp genes. second, a few adaptive mutations can have significant fitness impacts , and the relatively low prevalence of replacement mutations relative to neutral mutations may therefore not be indicative of the effect of protein evolution on fitness. finally, genetic incompatibilities between atp synthase subunits may arise solely between nuclear-encoded proteins.

we hope that future studies, focusing on experimental crosses and sequencing of additional atp synthase subunits will help us determine whether these genes suffer from mnis. looking at the proportion of fixed and polymorphic mutations within and between ma. balthica lineages using a larger sample size  <cit>  will also help us investigate the adaptive value of protein divergence at oxpho loci.

CONCLUSIONS
the participation of mnis to barriers limiting gene flow in the marine environment remains poorly known. in this contribution we characterized the mitochondrial genome of ma. balthica, a high gene flow marine bivalve, in an effort to test whether mitochondrial genes involved in epistatic interactions with previously-detected nuclear outlier loci show stronger nucleotide and protein divergence than average. our results suggest that genes coding for subunits of the nadh dehydrogenase protein complex could be involved in genetic incompatibilities. further investigations will focus on larger intra- and inter-lineage sampling for mitochondrial and nuclear genes of the oxpho chain to more fully characterize mnis. also, experimental crossings ma. balthica rubra individuals sampled on each side of the brittany hybrid zone will help understand the functional effects of pcg divergence.
