BACKGROUND
introduced pathogens have led to devastating epidemics in naïve host populations that lack evolved defences, as demonstrated by the plant pathogen cryphonectria parasitica, the fungus that causes chestnut blight. its introduction from asia  <cit>  practically eliminated the american chestnut  and markedly altered the species composition of forests throughout eastern north america. source pathogen populations are expected to be more diverse than introduced populations because introduced populations have smaller effective population sizes due to losses in genetic diversity from population bottlenecks and genetic drift associated with small founder population sizes  <cit> . however, this pattern could be reversed if multiple divergent lineages from separate sources colonize an area  <cit> . where introductions are few, haplotypes in introduced populations should be a subset of those in the source population  <cit> . additionally, for sexually reproducing organisms, recombination from sexual reproduction may be more prevalent in source or native populations, whereas clonal reproduction may dominate in introduced or marginal populations since multiple mating types necessary for sexual reproduction may not be present  <cit> . however, lack of variation in introduced populations can make it difficult to detect recombination.

the focus of this research is the invasion history and population structure of the grape powdery mildew fungus, erysiphe necator , an obligate parasite of vitis species that was introduced into europe and, eventually, all other wine-producing regions of the world. historical records support the hypothesis that the source of the introduction is eastern north america  <cit> . powdery mildew was described on grapes in north america in  <dig>  prior to its discovery in europe in  <dig>  <cit> . eastern north america is the centre of origin for many wild species of vitis that have relatively high levels of resistance to many diseases and pests of grapevines, including powdery mildew  <cit> . after its introduction to europe, grape powdery mildew was observed throughout all wine-producing regions of the world, including california in  <dig>  <cit>  and australia in  <dig>  <cit> . e. necator most likely dispersed long distances by the movement of grapevines, which were frequently traded between continents in the mid-1800's and later. e. necator remains dormant as mycelium in dormant buds, or as sexual spores in cleistothecia in the bark of vines  <cit> .

population genetic studies on e. necator to date have been limited to introduced populations in europe and australia where two distinct, yet sympatric, genetic groups have been consistently found  <cit> . the groups, designated as a and b , were originally identified using anonymous markers assayed by rapds, issrs and aflps. subsequent gene sequence analysis detected fixed nucleotide differences between groups at several nuclear loci, including  <dig> α-demethylase , the internal transcribed spacer  regions of ribosomal dna   <cit> , and beta-tubulin   <cit> . in india, a third genetic group was found, defined by rapds and a unique its sequence  <cit> . small differences in reproductive fitness  <cit>  and temporal variation have been found between groups a and b  <cit>  leading to the hypothesis that temporal variation between the groups may be maintaining the differentiation by preventing interbreeding  <cit> . group a is genetically less diverse than group b, thus it has been suggested that it is clonal, whereas group b is sexually reproducing  <cit> . groups a and b produce viable sexual progeny  in laboratory crosses  <cit> , but recombinants have not been found in nature.

we had two major objectives for this study. first, to understand the evolutionary processes that led to the existence of groups a and b of e. necator in introduced populations, we tested the hypothesis that a and b were derived from separate introductions, as opposed to diverging after their introduction. to address this question, it was essential to study the population structure in eastern north america, the putative source population. because no information was available on the population genetics of e. necator in north america, our major second objective was to describe the diversity and population structure in the eastern unites states . we tested the hypothesis that if the eastern us population was a potential source of introductions, haplotypes found in introduced populations of europe, australia, and the western us would also be found in the eastern us. moreover, we predicted that populations in the eastern us would have greater haplotype and nucleotide diversity than introduced populations. finally, we tested the hypotheses that the population in the eastern us is structured by geography, vitis host species, or host habitat .

RESULTS
genetic diversity in eastern us and introduced populations
we obtained  <dig> isolates of e. necator from diverse wild and cultivated vitis species collected from the eastern us  and from cultivated v. vinifera from the western us, europe, and australia . we also collected isolates of powdery mildew  from parthenocissus quinquefolia. we sequenced a total of  <dig> nucleotides from three nuclear gene regions: the internal transcribed spacer and the intergenic spacer regions of nuclear rdna , beta-tubulin , and translation elongation factor 1-α . we were unable to amplify igs from isolates sampled from p. quinquefolia. however, e. necator var. ampelopsidis from p. quinquefolia is markedly divergent with  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % similarity to the consensus sequence of isolates from vitis spp. for its, tub <dig>  and ef1-α, respectively. for comparison, the lowest sequence similarity within e. necator from vitis spp. was  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %. among isolates of e. necator from vitis spp. there were  <dig> segregating sites and  <dig> multilocus haplotypes . ef1-α contained the most segregating sites, followed by tub <dig>  and its/igs. all of the polymorphisms in ef1-α and tub <dig> were found in introns or as synonymous substitutions in coding regions.

1vinifera hybrids refer to interspecific hybrids derived from crosses between the european wine grape, v. vinifera, and wild american vitis species other than v. labrusca.

2labrusca hybrids  refer to v. vinifera x v. labrusca hybrids that are derived primarily from v. labrusca because of repeated backcrossing.

3sometimes referred to as muscadinia rotundifolia.

1numbers refer to the multilocus haplotypes; letters in parentheses refer to the haplotypes for its/igs , tub <dig> , and ef1-α , respectively. group a is represented by haplotype  <dig> and group b is represented by haplotypes 41- <dig> 

2only segregating sites are listed, which correspond to the following nucleotide positions in the referenced genbank accessions: its :  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  462; igs :  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  223; tub <dig> :  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  368; ef1-α :  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> 

3regions are: se = southeast us, c = central us, ne = northeast us, w = western us, eu = europe, au = australia. n = the number of isolates from each region with the designated haplotype.

4hosts are: vin = v. vinifera, hyb = vinifera hybrids, lab = v. labrusca and labrusca hybrids, aes = v. aestivalis, rip = v. riparia, rot = v. rotundifolia. n = the number of isolates from each host with the designated haplotype.

based on measurements of tajima's d  <cit> , its/igs and ef1-α do not deviate from neutral evolution . however, tub <dig> deviates significantly from neutrality in the eastern us population. significant negative values for tajima's d can result from population bottlenecks followed by rapid population expansion or from selective sweeps acting on or near the loci under investigation. since this effect is not detected across the entire genome, as would be expected with demographic effects, this is suggestive that the deviation from neutrality in tub <dig> is from selection.

1the introduced population comprises europe, australia and the western us; the eastern us comprises northeast, southeast and central us .

2to account for sample size differences in eastern us  and introduced populations , we used rarefaction analysis  <cit>  for haplotype richness, θw, and π in the native population. diversity estimates where the eastern us population is significantly more diverse than the introduced populations  are in bold.

3numbers in parentheses are the number of observed haplotypes among the  <dig> isolates from the eastern us population without correction by rarefaction analysis.

we estimated several population genetic parameters in the eastern us and introduced populations, including haplotype richness , watterson's theta , and pairwise nucleotide diversity . haplotype richness is significantly greater in the eastern us than in the introduced populations for each locus and the multilocus haplotypes , even when adjustments are made for differences in sample size . additionally, there is greater nucleotide polymorphism  in the eastern us population for tub <dig>  ef1-α and for all three loci combined. there is greater pairwise nucleotide diversity  for ef1-α in the eastern us population. however, π is greater in the introduced population for its/igs.

phylogeography
to determine evolutionary relationships among isolates, we constructed networks for the three gene regions and multilocus haplotypes . ancestral haplotypes identified based on rooting probability  <cit>  and maximum parsimony using e. necator var. ampelopsidis as an outgroup were from the eastern us in all cases. based on maximum parsimony the outgroup haplotypes would be at least  <dig> mutational steps from the putative ancestors for its/igs,  <dig> steps for tub <dig>   <dig> steps for ef1-α, and at least  <dig> steps for the combined multilocus haplotype. because of this degree of divergence tcs did not place the outgroup in the same network. the internal position of haplotypes from eastern north america is particularly noticeable for the multilocus network , whereas all haplotypes of isolates from introduced populations  are at or near the tips of the network. isolates from the western us have the same haplotypes  as isolates in group b from europe , which suggests that populations in the western us were introduced from europe. in addition to the  <dig> isolates from the western us reported here,  <dig> isolates from california and one from oregon had the same igs sequence that is found only in group b . we did not sequence additional loci for these isolates from the western us because all were like group b for igs.

the majority of haplotypes for the individual loci, and especially for the multilocus network, are represented by individuals from the eastern us populations, demonstrating that populations in the eastern us are more diverse than in europe, australia and the western us. the sample size from the eastern us population is larger; however, this difference is accounted for in the comparisons of diversity estimates by rarefaction analyses. although isolates from the central us are represented by diverse haplotypes, they are mostly derived haplotypes at or near the tips of the multilocus network, which suggests that this region is peripheral to the centre of diversity. all isolates obtained from v. rotundifolia belonged to two multilocus haplotypes  at the tips, derived from group a  and not shared by isolates from any other host species.

the haplotype networks show that genetic groups a and b from introduced populations are distinct from each other at all loci and are derived from north american ancestors . because of these differences, and the internal position of north american haplotypes, groups a and b almost certainly represent two separate introductions instead of diverging after introduction. we found no genetic variation among group a isolates, and this same multilocus haplotype  was common in the southeastern us in isolates from diverse wild and cultivated host species, including v. vinifera, vinifera hybrids, v. aestivalis, and v. riparia . in contrast, we found five multilocus haplotypes  forming a discrete lineage in group b; none of these multilocus haplotypes was found in eastern north america. however, group b does not differ from the eastern us population at all loci . it differs for its/igs, yet shares several haplotypes for ef1-α and tub <dig> with the eastern us population.

population differentiation
differentiation was estimated between the eastern us and introduced populations, and among geographic regions, vitis host habitats, and vitis host species in eastern us. eastern us and introduced populations are significantly differentiated . within the eastern us, we detected significant differentiation among geographic regions . geographic differentiation within the eastern us was detected when isolates from all hosts were included in the analysis. because many hosts are more abundant in particular geographic regions , we conducted tests of geographic subdivision on isolates collected only from v. vinifera and vinifera hybrid hosts, which are found abundantly among the three regions, to avoid confounding host and geography. geographic subdivision was still evident when the analyses only included isolates from v. vinifera and vinifera hybrid hosts .

there was no differentiation between populations from wild and cultivated host habitats or among host species within geographic regions , except when isolates from v. rotundifolia were included in the analyses.

discussion
patterns of introduction and invasion
the multilocus haplotype network  demonstrates that the eastern us population is ancestral to the introduced populations  <cit> . therefore, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that e. necator was introduced into europe from eastern north america  <cit>  because populations in italy and france are derived from north american ancestors. additionally, populations in california share haplotypes with populations from europe, suggesting the possibility that they could have been introduced from europe; the reverse direction of introduction is less likely given the historical records of trade in grapevines and that grape powdery mildew was first observed in europe in  <dig>  but not in california until  <dig>  however, we cannot make any firm conclusions because we do not know which genetic group, a or b, was introduced into europe first. populations in the eastern us are more genotypically diverse than those in europe, australia and the western us. several of the haplotypes for individual loci in the introduced populations were found in eastern north america, which is expected when comparing source and introduced populations. an alternative hypothesis, that e. necator was introduced into europe from japan has been suggested  <cit> , but there is no evidence to support this claim and we were unable to obtain samples from japan for this study.

at least two haplotypes of the grape powdery mildew fungus, progenitors of groups a and b, were introduced and successfully invaded europe and australia. if there had been a single introduction, individuals in the introduced populations would represent a monophyletic group; the single introduction hypothesis can be rejected based on the relationships of group a and b haplotypes in the multilocus network . the introductions, and successful invasions, may have occurred at separate times or multiple, distinct haplotypes may have been introduced during a single event. previous studies in french and australian populations of e. necator, based on anonymous markers, also found greater diversity in group b than in group a  <cit>  and it has been hypothesized that group a is predominantly asexual, while group b undergoes sexual recombination. most studies have shown that group a is dominated by a single mating type  <cit> . we expected to find both genetic groups from the introduced populations in the eastern us population. however, we found isolates in the southeastern us with the same multilocus haplotype as that in group a, but we did not find any with the same haplotype as those in group b. group b haplotypes may have diverged by genetic drift from the original founders since the first introductions into europe more than  <dig> years ago. sexual reproduction and recombination in group b, coupled with selection for new haplotypes on a different host species and in environmental conditions in europe, could also have led to divergence. alternatively, our sample size in eastern north america may not have been large enough to include haplotypes that are less common in the eastern us population, which by chance could have been introduced into europe. an alternative explanation is that the unique alleles specific to genetic group b came from an entirely different source, which we did not sample for this study.

genotypic diversity was significantly greater in the eastern us population than in introduced populations, although measures of gene diversity were not always greater . in fact, pairwise nucleotide diversity  was significantly greater for its/igs in the introduced population. one explanation for this finding is that the occurrence of two distinct genetic groups in the introduced populations results in high gene diversity because of fixed nucleotide differences between lineages, but low genotypic diversity because there is little or no variation within groups. this discrepancy is similar to finding high gene diversity combined with low genotypic diversity in clonal diploid populations with fixed heterozygosity  <cit> . multiple introductions of distinct lineages from different sources into new ranges can result in greater diversity than expected during an invasion  <cit> . additionally, gene diversity was overestimated in europe and australia because our samples were not random, but rather were artificially constructed with roughly equal numbers of isolates from the two genetic groups, whereas group b is typically found at a greater frequency than group a in populations in europe  <cit> . moreover, the lack of diversity within groups a and b validated our strategy of sequencing relatively small samples from europe and australia where extensive sampling only found these two discrete groups  <cit> . haplotypic  richness is one of the best measures for reductions in diversity associated with population bottlenecks because rare haplotypes are often lost during founder events even if overall gene diversity is not largely affected  <cit> .

our results are consistent with historical records of the movement of grapevines and plant-mediated introductions of e. necator into europe, california, and australia. after grape powdery mildew spread throughout europe by the mid- <dig> s, additional vines were imported from eastern north america as sources of resistance. unfortunately, this resulted in the introduction of additional grape pests and diseases into europe, including the phylloxera aphid and downy mildew  <cit> . additional importations of grapevines from eastern north america for resistance to these pests/diseases may have led also to additional introductions of e. necator. secondary introductions of e. necator from europe into california and australia are also consistent with historical records of the movement of grapevines. during the 1850's and 1860's large collections of v. vinifera were brought to california from europe  <cit> . powdery mildew was first described in california in  <dig> and in australia in  <dig>  <cit> , so it is likely that it was introduced on vines imported at this time. two of the four group b multilocus haplotypes found in europe are also found in the western us. it is not clear why both genetic groups were introduced into australia, but only group b is present in california. it is possible that group a is present in california, but at such a low frequency that we did not sample it. nevertheless, it is surprising that since its introduction over  <dig> years ago, additional genotypes of e. necator have not been successfully introduced by the movement of vines from the eastern us to europe, australia or the western us.

absence of host specificity among vitis host species, except v. rotundifolia
with the exception of specialization on muscadine grapes, v. rotundifolia, we found no genetic differentiation among populations from vitis host species. this was not unexpected. the best-studied powdery mildew fungus, blumeria graminis, shows specialization among host genera rather than among species within a genus  <cit> . similarly, e. necator demonstrates host specialization at the level of host genus. gadoury and pearson  <cit>  showed that e. necator var. ampelopsidis sampled from p. quinquefolia was only rarely pathogenic on vitis species, and then only with low virulence. multilocus sequencing of e. necator var. ampelopsidis, as in the formae speciales of b. graminis, showed that this type of marked host specialization correlates to marked genetic divergence from e. necator on vitis. alternatively, there may be population divergence of e. necator among vitis hosts, but we are not able to detect it with the conserved genes used in this study. other fungi show specialization at the level of host species. for example, microsatellite markers, which are more polymorphic than multilocus sequences, allowing for better detection of differentiation, showed specialization of microbotryum violaceum at the level of host species  <cit> . the lack of specialization could be also explained by recent colonization of vitis hosts by e. necator or recent diversification of vitis species in north america. in closely related species or populations undergoing speciation, genetic divergence may only be evident at one or a few loci involved in adaptation and reproductive isolation  <cit> .

we found that e. necator populations from muscadines are genetically distinct from populations on other vitis species. although, the haplotypes of muscadine isolates differ from those from other vitis species by one or two mutations there is a strong phenotypic difference that is a potential isolating mechanism. another study demonstrated marked host specialization to muscadine in laboratory inoculations, but not among other vitis species  <cit> . although isolates from muscadines could infect other vitis species in the lab, we did not find haplotypes from the muscadine lineage from other vitis species in the field even when they were sympatric with muscadines. populations of e. necator from muscadine and other vitis species could be in the early stages of speciation resulting from host specialization. alternatively, muscadine isolates may have alleles that evade recognition by host defences in a gene-for-gene interaction. resistance to powdery mildew controlled by a single, but complex, genetic locus has been demonstrated in muscadines, which is a source of resistance in breeding programs  <cit> . it is important to test any new resistant cultivars derived from muscadines with diverse powdery mildew populations from the regions where muscadines are endemic to ensure that the resistance would be durable.

population differentiation of e. necator was not detected between wild and cultivated hosts. in some cases, crop domestication can lead to the divergence of pathogen populations on wild relatives and crop plants  <cit> . moreover, management strategies or high-density cultivation of crop plants can lead to population differentiation between pathogens from natural ecosystems and agricultural ecosystems  <cit> . the lack of population structure in e. necator indicates that gene flow is presently occurring or has occurred historically between the powdery mildew populations from wild and cultivated hosts.

CONCLUSIONS
our results are consistent with the hypotheses that populations of the grape powdery mildew fungus, e. necator, in europe are derived from two separate introductions and that their ancestors were likely from native populations in the eastern us. multilocus sequencing analysis and historical records are also consistent with the hypothesis that the initial introductions into europe were followed by secondary introductions from europe into the western us and australia and were likely the result of plant-mediated dispersal in the grapevines that were frequently traded between continents during the time of introductions. within the eastern us, populations of e. necator do not demonstrate divergence based on host habitat or vitis host species, with the exception of specialization to muscadine grapes, v. rotundifolia.
