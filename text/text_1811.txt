BACKGROUND
in real-time pcr, fluorescence is recorded at each cycle to monitor the generation of product  <cit> . typically, after several cycles with no or minor changes in background fluorescence, there is a short phase with vigorous exponential increase of fluorescence, which then gradually slows down to a plateau phase. in conventional data analysis, for each fluorescence curve a crossing point  alias threshold cycle  is determined from the visible exponential amplification phase using either the fit point method or the second-derivative method  <cit> . it is clear that for proper calculation of initial target levels, differences in efficiency of amplification  must be taken into account  <cit> . even small ea differences amplify to large apparent differences in mrna levels  <cit> . the above methods require the set-up of standard curves from which ea is deduced. the disadvantages of standard curves are  the extra effort and cost to set up additional samples e.g. by serial dilution, and  non-matching eas if inhibitors are present and serially diluted  <cit> .

the alternative to using standard curves is to determine ea directly from the samples  <cit> . the initial exponential amplification can be described in terms of fluorescence  by the following equation:

  fx = f0• x 

see table  <dig> for definition of parameters. note that in this report, ea has limits of  <dig>  and  <dig> ; all references to papers where ea runs between  <dig> and  <dig> have been transformed by adding  <dig>  ideally, one would like to determine the individual ea of each sample to determine accurate f <dig> values; f <dig> is directly proportional to the sample target cdna amount. however, for each trace of fluorescence there are only very few  data points with virtually constant ea which can be used for an analysis according to equation  <dig>  in earlier cycles, there is only background fluorescence , and in later cycles the ea declines due to product accumulation  <cit> . thus, very few qualified data points combined with considerable measurement error makes direct exponential extrapolation inaccurate. one strategy to improve parameter estimation is to include later points of the fluorescence curve and to adjust ea as a function of cycle number  <cit> . however, we have observed that these approaches can not properly model target fluorescence in detail.

very recently, alvarez et al. have introduced into real-time pcr data analysis the useful notion to model the decrease of ea not as a function of cycle number, but as a function of fluorescence, the indicator of product accumulation  <cit> . this insightful concept is more difficult to apply to data analysis though, since it does not allow direct fitting of flourescence as a simple function of cycle number. alvarez et al. calculate, as fi+1/fi ratio, amplification efficiencies for each cycle, then fit  <dig> parameters of a sigmoidal function to these ea values as a function of fluorescence, and finally estimate, with both parameters fixed, f <dig> by iterative discrete fitting. the downsides of this approach are large errors in the fi+1/fi ratios, non-linear regression with fluorescence as the independent variable , fluorescence data  on both axes, and fitting twice to the same set of information. further limitations are indicated in the discussion.

based on the innovative concept of modelling ea as a function of amplicon fluorescence, it was our aim here to overcome the defects of the approach of alvarez et al.. as the key improvement, we find that iterative simulation of the pcr process with ea modelled as a gaussian peak function of amplicon fluorescence yields precise and correct initial ea values, both with hydrolysis probe and sybr green detection. our approach includes, for the first time, simultaneous non-linear fitting to determine ea as a common parameter for all samples of a group. compared to established methods of real-time pcr data analysis, our approach results in more accurate estimates of relative cdna levels.

RESULTS
modelling ea as a function of target fluorescence
initially, we tried to fit equation  <dig> to a limited number  of data points from the very early visible exponential phase, i.e. the first points above background fluorescence. in this phase the ea should still be, as a good approximation, constant and equal to the initial ea. however, this approach was relatively unreliable, even with simultaneous fitting of multiple curves, since there is considerable  experimental error  with every fluorescence reading, yet the last point with the highest fluorescence is always fitted best, even when various weighing options were applied. it is thus necessary to include data points from later cycles in order to mitigate random fluorescence errors. we tested previously reported sigmoid  <cit> , logistic  <cit> , and other  transition functions in order to model target fluorescence as a function of cycle number. all of these, however, showed systematic deviations between calculated and observed fluorescence particularly in the early exponential phase .

with the aim of modelling ea as a function of fluorescence  <cit> , we inspected several of our own experimental data sets, plotted as fi/fi- <dig> versus fi . this made us consider a gauss peak function /c}2]) and a logistic peak function  <dig> with d = exp ) for modelling. since we expected ea  to be maximal at fi =  <dig>  both functions were simplified by setting b to zero. with the gauss function, it follows that ea =  <dig> + /exp  with k =  <dig> * c <dig>  with the logistic function, the analogous equation is ea =  <dig> +  <dig> *  * exp / <dig> with k = c. both functions adequately describe fi/fi- <dig> as a function of fi . as an important difference, the logistic function always yields higher ea <dig> values than the gauss function . however, it is not possible to determine which function is more appropriate from this plot, since the critical region of low fi is unaccessible, because of very large errors.

in order to describe experimental fluorescence as a function of cycle number, we use an iterative approach that yields all  <dig> parameters by a single non-linear fitting procedure. depending on f <dig>  the virtual initial target fluorescence, ea <dig>  the initial efficiency of amplification, and k, the fluorescence is increased cycle by cycle – with ea adjusted as a function of target fluorescence – up to cycle x. note that e.g. function ea =  <dig> + /exp  is valid for the plot of fi/fi- <dig> versus fi. however, in the pcr simulation, it is necessary to calculate – in the other direction – fi+ <dig> from fi; since ea is not a linear function of fi, the available ratio fi/fi- <dig> can not be used. thus, combining ea = fi+1/fi and ea =  <dig> + /exp  gives fi * /exp  + fi - fi+ <dig> =  <dig>  we use the algorithm of newton  <cit>  to solve this equation by iteration. note that alvarez et al. have used a fi+1/fi plot to avoid the need to calculate fi+ <dig> from fi by newton iteration.

selection of data points
like previously reported approaches, neither gauss nor logistic function can reliably model the plateau phase of the pcr fluorescence curve . we therefore exclude all data points beyond the minimum of the second derivative  from analysis. also with the fluorescence difference  data, we define the background interval that is modeled by a straight line .

simultaneous fitting
the ea <dig> values that result from fitting to individual fluorescence curves are still uncertain to an extent that precludes direct use . we thus use simultaneous fitting in the final stage of data analysis to determine an optimal common ea <dig>  for this, all associated curves , with the same points selected as previously for individual fitting, are first pooled into a group by transformation of the cycle numbers . note that the protein of interest and the standard used for normalization, e.g. beta-actin, constitute separate groups, since different primers  are used. samples with markedly different individual ea0s should be gathered into separate groups. with the iterative algorithm described above, a single common ea <dig> is fitted to all curves of a group; at the same time, individual f <dig> and k parameters are fitted for each curve. based on the shared ea <dig>  the final f <dig> values, which are proportional to initial target amount, can be directly used to calculate relative expression levels; for this, normalized ratios, calculated from f <dig> values of the protein of interest and of the corresponding standard protein, are compared.

validation
locked nucleic acid  hydrolysis probe and sybr green assays with  <dig> different targets as shown in table  <dig> were performed to resolve whether to use the gauss function or the logistic function and to validate our approach. for each target,  <dig> identical dilution series of  <dig> samples each were processed in parallel; all  <dig> samples were analyzed as a group. note that these assays are to some extent imperfect, since they were pipetted and operated by  <dig> different persons with ordinary skills. in these comparisons, goodness of fit, indicated by chi squared, was not always better with the gauss function; nevertheless, on average goodness of fit was better i.e. chi squared was smaller by a factor of  <dig>  . decisively, the gauss function performed better than the logistic function according to  <dig> criteria: i) the sum of accuracy errors  is smaller, i.e.  <dig>   vs.  <dig>  . ii) with sybr green detection of the human gapdh amplicon, the logistic function yielded a concerted ea <dig> of  <dig> ; this is significantly higher – the standard deviation from fitting of the concerted ea0s was ≤  <dig>  for all  <dig> targets  – than the theoretical upper limit of 2; by contrast, the gauss function produced an ea of  <dig> . thus, the gauss function was used for all analyses below.

a: logistic model

results of table  <dig> indicate good precision  and accuracy. in order to compare our approach with the standard curve approach  <cit> , each dilution series was analyzed as a separate subgroup as shown in table  <dig>  with our approach, precision was better by a factor of  <dig>  ; more importantly, accuracy was better by a factor of  <dig>  . note that our method yields ea0s both higher and lower than the corresponding eas of the standard curve approach. we suppose that this is caused by the lightcycler software for cp estimation, which can not properly correct a drifting baseline, since the best available baseline adjustment  simply subtracts a constant offset from all data points. table  <dig> shows results from analysis of our data sets with  <dig> of the tools that are available for data analysis without standard curves. estimates from linregpcr analysis  <cit>  were much less precise  and accurate . in comparison to the dart-pcr approach  <cit> , which uses the average of individual eas to calculate f <dig> values, precision was virtually identical ; however, accuracy was in favour of our approach by a factor of  <dig>  . table  <dig> suggests that our approach is better than dart-pcr because individual eas are determined more precisely; sems on average  were smaller by a factor of  <dig> .

surprisingly, with some hydrolysis probe assays we obtained ea0s definitely higher than  <dig> ; concurrently, the measured dilution factors of corresponding dilution series were strikingly wrong. with the same primers, but sybr green instead of hydrolysis probe detection, ea0s ≤  <dig>  were determined, and measured matched intended dilution factors. thus, with lna hydrolysis probes , efficiency of fluorescence generation can be higher than efficiency of amplification. extra fluorescence is not caused by the probe alone, since for one amplicon probe # <dig> gave a higher ea <dig> than the sybr green assay , but for another amplicon detection with same probe matched sybr green . based on sequence analysis and dedicated experiments we have devised a hypothesis, depicted in figure  <dig>  to explain additional exponential probe hydrolysis. we suppose that, given matching partial binding sites as indicated, the tightly-binding lna probe may guide the polymerase to switch to a second antisense strand during synthesis of sense strand. this low-efficiency template-switching  <cit>  generates an extended amplicon with two perfect probe binding sites instead of one. the extended amplicon can be extended further by the same mechanism. in support of the model, when ccca  was replaced by ggtg, ea <dig> dropped from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . residual fluorescence growth may be caused analogously by the sequence tgag  in reverse strand synthesis.

discussion
in real-time pcr, without a doubt, it would be optimal to determine an individual ea for each sample. however, it does not seem possible with present experimental technology to determine individual eas according to equation  <dig> reliably: very few qualified data points  combined with considerable measurement error makes direct exponential extrapolation inaccurate. one strategy to improve parameter estimation is to include later points of the fluorescence curve. however, we find that sigmoid  <cit> , logistic  <cit> , or other functions can not properly model target fluorescence in detail. very recently, alvarez et al. have introduced a fundamentally different approach  <cit> . it appreciates that the decrease of ea is caused by product accumulation  <cit> . this concept allows to embrace even more points for analysis  than other methods, which use the maximum of the second derivative as an upper limit  <cit>  or the center of selection  <cit> . unfortunately, the particular algorithm of alvarez et al., which is based on a sigmoidal function, suffers from a number of disadvantages . in the present report we use iterative non-linear fitting with a gauss function to describe ea as a function of fluorescence. both approaches use the same number of parameters for fitting, i.e.  <dig> parameters plus the actual result, f <dig>  however, our approach has the following advantages over the approach of alvarez et al.: i) parameters ea <dig>  f <dig>  and k are fitted directly to the fluorescence vs. cycle number data without any data transformation except for inevitable subtraction of background; this avoids additional errors  and preserves error composition. ii) all final parameters are estimated in a single round of fitting. alvarez et al. have rejected direct iterative fitting of f <dig> alongside with their  <dig> model parameters because of large uncertainty in the estimation of f <dig>  instead, they use an unfavourable algorithm that involves data transformation and fitting twice to the same data set. by contrast, data from tables  <dig> and  <dig> suggests that our gauss function model allows accurate fitting of the same number of parameters concurrently. iii) ea <dig> can freely surpass 2; this was very instrumental to uncover overestimation of dna amplification with certain lna hydrolysis probe assays. by contrast, with the sigmoid function of alvarez et al., ea <dig> is forced to values < 2; to recognize this flaw of formula design, insert a very large tm/b ratio in equation  <dig> of the cited work. iv) our model is compatible with simultaneous fitting to determine a common ea. note that simultaneous fitting of ea <dig> is not directly possible with the function of alvarez et al., since there ea <dig> is not a single parameter, but a function of  <dig> parameters.

in an extensive comparison, the approach of alvarez et al. displayed the lowest quantification error of all methods of individual curve analysis ; similar results were only obtained with eas estimated from standard curves based on dilution series  <cit> . we have not applied the approach of alvarez et al. to our data, since, as explained above, the approach is based in parts on unfavorable design. however, our comparison with the widely-used standard curve approach suggests that our approach gives markedly better results . also, we find that our approach is much better in terms of precision and accuracy than the linregpcr approach . with the dart-pcr approach, which uses the average of individual eas to calculate f <dig> values, precision was virtually identical; however, accuracy was distinctly better with our approach. we suppose that this is caused predominantly by much more  precise individual eas . moreover, with dart-pcr, the mean eas of  <dig> amplicons were markedly smaller than the corresponding ea0s from our approach; the other  <dig> were not significantly larger. this is not surprising, since dart-pcr assumes a constant ea which is determined around the second derivative maximum and thereby may underestimate the initial ea.

in spite of these improvements, the f <dig> values that result from fitting to individual fluorescence curves are still uncertain to an extent that precludes direct use . the individual eas are useful to identify erratic samples and to judge the quality of primers and probes, but, as was observed previously, they introduce additional error and thus increase data variance  <cit> . indeed, in the afore-mentioned comparison of available individual curve analysis methods, accuracy and precision in quantification of experimental dilution series was poor  <cit> ; similarly, with our data sets, the linregpcr software yielded the least accurate results . given that determination of f <dig> values from individual eas is futile because of experimental limitations, then the next best thing is to analyze related samples as a group with a concerted ea. towards this end, peirson et al. have simply calculated the arithmetic mean of individual eas  <cit> . in the present report we introduce simultaneous non-linear regression to determine an optimal ea for all samples of a group. note that with our large data sets, ea <dig> determined by simultaneous fitting was not dramatically different from the arithmetic mean . however, with few samples per group, for example with  <dig> gapdh amplicon samples , simultaneous fitting  and arithmetic mean  may yield markedly disparate results. we suggest that simultaneous fitting provides the best possible ea <dig> that optimally unifies all related fluorescence curves; simultaneous fitting thus contributes to the better performance of our approach. empirically, for a reliable ea <dig> we would recommend to employ at least  <dig> samples per group.

making good use of accurate ea0s, our study has revealed that fluorescence generation with some lna hydrolysis probe assays may overestimate dna amplification and hence cause incorrect results. to explain this, we assume low-efficiency polymerase template switching that leads to progressive amplicon elongation including additional probe binding sites . it would thus seem advisable to verify each new lna hydrolysis probe amplicon with sybr green detection to avoid spurious fluorescence generation.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present report we introduce a new approach to analyze real-time pcr fluorescence curves without standard curves. our strategy is based on the useful concept of alvarez et al. to model ea as a function of amplicon fluorescence. as the key improvement, we find that a gaussian model overcomes the defects of the original sigmoidal model. iterative simulation of the pcr process up to the minimum of the second derivative of fluorescence yields precise and meaningful initial amplification efficiency values. in the final stage of analysis, a common ea <dig> is fitted simultaneously to all curves of a group of related samples. in comparison to previously reported approaches that are based on the separate analysis of each curve and on modelling ea as a function of cycle number, our approach yields more accurate and precise estimates of relative initial target levels.
