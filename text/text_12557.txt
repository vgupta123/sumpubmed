BACKGROUND
candida albicans is both a commensal and a pathogenic yeast, which is responsible for severe infections in humans, particularly in immunocompromised persons, such as aids and cancer patients, diabetics, newborns and the elderly  <cit> . although several anti-candida agents are currently available, such as amphotericin b, azoles and echinocandins, there is clearly a need for new specific anti-fungal agents and drug-targets  <cit> . the cell wall of c. albicans is an essential organelle that helps to withstand osmotic pressure and determines the shape of the cell. the cell wall is a plastic and dynamic structure, whose macromolecular composition, molecular organization and thickness can greatly vary depending on environmental conditions. the cell wall construction is also tightly controlled in space and time by many genes  <cit> . within a host-parasite relationship, the cell wall of c. albicans lies at the crossroads of pathogenicity and therapeutics. it contributes to pathogenicity through adherence and invasion, and it is the target of both pharmacological and immunological antifungal therapy  <cit> . the cell wall comprises two main layers. the inner layer consists of a network of β <dig> -glucan molecules, accounting for approximately 40% of the cell-wall mass, to which β <dig> -glucan  and chitin  are covalently attached  <cit> . the outer layer is composed of a dense layer of mannoproteins, termed "cell wall proteins" , which account for 35-40% of the cell-wall mass. based on their linkage to other cell wall polysaccharides, two classes of cwps can be distinguished. one class, which constitutes the majority of the cwps, consists of cwps that are covalently linked to β <dig> -glucan via a remnant of a gpi anchor  <cit> . the other class consists of the so-called "alkali sensitive linkage" -cwps, which are covalently linked to the β <dig> -glucan network  through an unknown linkage that is sensitive to mild alkaline conditions  <cit> . the best-described asl-cwps are the family of pir-proteins . pir-proteins are thought to be pre-proteins that are processed at kex <dig> endoprotease recognition sites  <cit> ; the n-terminal part of mature proteins contains conserved internal tandem repeats, and the c-terminal half shares a high sequence similarity including four conserved cysteines.

the mp <dig> gene encodes a cell wall mannoprotein  of c. albicans. in a previous study  <cit> , our research group identified, generated, and intensely studied native and recombinant forms of mp65p and found that it is a major target of immune response in humans and mice  <cit> ; we also found that mp65p is a critical determinant of pathogenicity in experimental models of systemic infection in mice and vaginal infection in rats  <cit> . mp65p is a putative β-glucanase adhesin with one n- and multiple potential o-glycosylation sites, homologous to scw10p of s. cerevisiae, a member of the gh <dig> glycosyl-hydrolase family  <cit> . moreover, it contains a putative kex <dig> peptidase  site  <cit> , where the protein is cleaved for secretion and an rgd motif that characterizes various proteins of eukaryotic organisms involved in adhesion mechanisms, as both adhesins and adhesin receptors  <cit> . furthermore, we found that the mp <dig> gene can be used as a diagnostic marker for systemic c. albicans and non-albicans infections  <cit> . in another study  <cit> , we described the construction of the mp65Δ mutants and some of their genetic traits and biological properties, demonstrating that mp65p is required for hyphal morphogenesis and experimental pathogenicity. in the present study, we explored the role of mp65p in depth, examining whether it is required for cell wall integrity, adhesion to host tissues and biofilm formation.

for morphological observations , the cells were grown at 28°c in yepd in the absence or presence of congo red and observed under a light microscope at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h. the images were captured with nikon microphot-fx and arkon software and imported to adobe photoshop  <dig> . finally, the cropped images were assembled into figures using canvas  <dig> . for the flocculation studies, following o.n. growth, the cultures were transferred to test tubes and incubated for  <dig> min. for scanning electron microscopy  observations, c. albicans cells were grown in yepd in the absence or presence of congo red  at 28°c for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h. after centrifuging, the cells were washed twice in distilled water and fixed with  <dig> %  glutaraldehyde in  <dig>  m cacodylate buffer  containing 2%  sucrose, for  <dig> min at room temperature . after  <dig> washes in the same buffer, the cells were postfixed with 1%  oso <dig> for  <dig> h, dehydrated through graded ethanol concentrations, critical point-dried in co <dig>  and gold coated by sputtering . the samples were examined with a cambridge stereoscan  <dig> scanning electron microscope . for transmission electron microscopy , cells were prefixed with glutaraldehyde, as previously mentioned, then post-fixed with the oso <dig> solution o.n., at 4°c. the cells were then dehydrated in acetone gradient and embedded in epoxy resin , as per routine procedures. ultrathin sections, obtained with an lkb ultramicrotome , were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. these were examined with a philips  <dig> transmission electron microscope .

immuno-labelling studies in electron microscopy 
for β-glucan localization in the post-embedding procedure, the ultrathin sections, obtained as described above, and collected on gold grids, were treated for  <dig> min with  <dig>  mg of sodium borohydride per ml of ice-cold distilled water. after being washed in ice-cold distilled water  and in pbs containing  <dig> %  bovine serum albumin,  <dig> % tween  <dig>  and 5% fetal serum , the sections were incubated with mab 1e <dig>  o.n. at 4°c. after being washed at r.t. for  <dig> h by floating the grids on drops of pbs, the samples were labeled with rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin m  gold conjugate  <dig> nm  and then washed in pbs buffer at r.t for  <dig> h. for negative control, the sections were incubated with igm monoclonal antibody or with goat anti-mouse igg-gold alone.

adhesion to buccal ephitelial cells 
adhesion to buccal epithelial cells  was assayed as described previously  <cit> . yeast cells were grown for  <dig> h at 28°c in winge , washed twice with pbs  and resuspended at  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml in the same buffer by using a bürker hemocytometer. one ml of yeast suspension was added to  <dig> bec and incubated for  <dig> h at 37°c. the non-adhering fungal cells were washed off with  <dig> ml of pbs through a  <dig> μm polycarbonate filter. the filters were then gently smeared on glass slides, which were air-dried at r.t. o.n. stained with crystal violet  and observed under a light microscope. the images were captured with nikon microphot-fx and arkon software at different magnifications, and

imported to adobe photoshop  <dig>  and then assembled into figures using canvas  <dig> . adherence was expressed as yeast cells adhering to  <dig> epithelial cells + standard error.

adhesion to caco-2
the adhesion assay was set up in 24-well polystyrene plates as described previously  <cit> , with only one modification:  <dig> ×  <dig> cells in pbs  were added to each well.

biofilm formation and quantification
cells were grown for  <dig> h at 28°c in yepd broth. these were washed twice with sterile pbs , and resuspended in rpmi  <dig> supplemented with morpholinepropanesulfonic acid  at  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml. the cell suspension  was seeded in presterilized, polystyrene flat-bottom 24-well microtiter plates  and incubated for  <dig> h at 37°c. after biofilm formation, the medium was aspirated, and non-adherent cells were removed by washing the biofilms  <dig> times with  <dig> μl of sterile pbs  <cit> . the yeasts were quantified by the  <dig> -bis -2h-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide  reduction assay. the xtt  and menadione  solutions were prepared immediately before each assay. xtt solution was mixed with the menadione solution at a ratio of 1000: <dig> by volume;  <dig> μl of the xtt-menadione solution was then added to each well. the microtiter plates were then incubated in the dark for  <dig> h at 37°c. following incubation,  <dig> μl of the xtt-menadione solution was recovered and centrifuged ;  <dig> μl of the solution was transferred to new wells, and the color change resulting from xtt reduction was measured at  <dig> nm with a microtiter plate reader . the absorbance values of the controls were then subtracted from the values of the test wells to eliminate spurious results due to background interference. biofilm cultures were grown in triplicate, and each assay was performed  <dig> times. for the photographs, the biofilms were stained with cv  <cit>  and the images captured with a nikon eclipse te <dig> inverted microscope. for dry weight determinations, the biofilms were grown as described above and dried o.n. in a laminar flow hood. three 24-well microtiter plates, for each c. albicans strain were used. the dry weight was given by the difference between the weight of dried plate containing biofilm and the same clean and sterile pre-weighed plate. the dry weight was expressed as the mean + s. d. of  <dig> plates.

quantitative real-time rt-pcr
the quantitative expression of different genes was determined by real-time reverse transcription -pcr starting from total rna of candida cells grown in yepd o.n. at 28°c and then washed with depc treated water. total rna was extracted as previously described  <cit>  and then treated with rnase-free dnase  to remove traces of genomic dna. the absence of dna contamination was confirmed by a reverse transcription reaction using a control set of primers excluding the reverse transcriptase component from the cdna reaction. primer pairs for the target and reference act <dig> genes  were designed using beacon designer software version  <dig> . <dig> and synthesized by primm . the first-strand cdna synthesis from  <dig> μg of rna was performed using quantitect reverse transcription kit . in a total volume of  <dig> μl, iq sybr green supermix ,  <dig> μl of first-strand cdna reaction mixture, and  <dig>  μm of primers were mixed. pcr was performed for samples in triplicate using the icycler iq real-time pcr detection system . a sampling program comprising of 95°c for  <dig> min,  <dig> cycles at 95°c for  <dig> s, and then at 58°c for  <dig> s was used. the amplification products were detected with sybr green, and the specificity of the amplification was confirmed by melting curve analysis. bio-rad iq <dig> software was used to calculate ct values; the analysis of relative gene expression data was performed by the 2-ΔΔct method  <cit> , with act <dig> as the reference gene.

protein extract and western analysis
to investigate if the cell wall integrity pathway was activated by the presence of congo red, c. albicans cells were grown in ypd medium at 28°c, to mid-exponential phase, then treated with congo red ,  <dig>  h before collection. the cells were then washed and resuspended in extraction buffer  and then disrupted with glass beads. the lysate was centrifuged at  <dig>  <dig> rpm for  <dig> min. the protein extracts were quantified using the comassie protein assay reagent . one hundred and fifty μg of protein was separated on a 10% sds-page linear gel and then blotted to the nitrocellulose membrane. before blocking, the equal loading was verified by memcode ™ reversible protein stain kit  together with the intensity of nonspecific bands. the membrane was then blocked in tbs plus  <dig> % tween  <dig> and  <dig> mg/ml dry milk  at r.t. for  <dig> h. the anti-phospho-p44/ <dig> mapk  antibody  was used to detect phosphorylated forms of mkc1p and cek1p mapks. the anti-mapk antibody was used to reveal the total amount of mkc1p. the anti-kss1p polyclonal antibody , raised in rabbit against kss1p of s. cerevisiae, was used to detect the total amount of cek1p. the act1p signal, obtained using the anti-act1p antibody , was used as the loading control.

flow cytometry
to detect antigen expression, a suspension of 106- <dig> yeast cells was fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde at r.t. for  <dig> min. after washing with ice-cold pbs, samples were incubated at 4°c for  <dig> min with mab 1e <dig> diluted 1: <dig> and then with a goat anti-mouse igm-fluorescein-conjugated antibody  diluted 1: <dig>  after washing, cells were immediately analyzed. fluorescence was analyzed with facscan flow cytometer  equipped with a  <dig> mw,  <dig> nm, air-cooled argon ion laser. fitc fluorescence was measured through a  <dig> nm band-pass filter and acquired in log mode. negative controls were obtained by incubating samples with mouse igm lambda . the β-glucan content was expressed in arbitrary units  and was calculated as the ratio of the labeled samples on the mean fluorescence channel  of the corresponding negative controls. the mfc was calculated by cell quest software .

cell wall components
the determination of the sugar monomers, after cell wall polysaccharides extraction with acid hydrolysis, was performed using hplc with a dionex bio-lc system as previously described  <cit> .

statistics
differences in mean values of analytical determinations were assessed by the student's t test, and significance was set at p <  <dig> .

RESULTS
cell wall integrity
to determine the effects of deleting the mp <dig> gene on the integrity of the cell wall, we tested the mp65Δ mutant for sensitivity to different agents whose effects have been associated with an altered cell wall. the sensitivity was measured by microdilution sensitivity and with solid medium spotting assays. in the first method, by performing dose-response experiments, the mp65Δ mutant was more sensitive than the wild type to the cell wall-perturbing agents congo red and calcofluor white, which bind with glucan and chitin, interfering with their synthesis and cross-linking  <cit> . the mp65Δ mutant was also more sensitive than the wild type to sds , tunicamycin , and, though to a much lesser extent, caffeine  . in the second method, the data from single high-dose experiments  confirmed the increased susceptibility of the mp65Δ mutant to all tested perturbing agents. the re-introduction of one copy of the mp <dig> gene  restored growth in the presence of all perturbing agents , demonstrating that the absence of this gene was responsible for the observed phenotype in a stress agent-dependent and gene-dosage dependent fashion.

to further assess the importance of mp65p for cell wall assembly and integrity, we performed a cell wall digestion assay with a cell wall-corrupting β <dig> -glucanase enzyme  by measuring the half-life  of spheroplast lysis.

the mp65Δ mutant proved to be more sensitive to β- <dig> -glucanase activity than the wild type and the revertant strains , indicating marked changes in the cell wall composition, organization or both, which could only in part be recovered by reintroduction of one copy of the mp <dig> gene .

the hypersensitivity of the mp65Δ mutant to cell wall-perturbing agents and the alterations in cell-wall organization  led us to investigate whether the cell integrity pathway was activated in this mutant. given that the induction of the cell integrity pathway resulted in the phosphorylation of the mapk mkc1p, we checked the activation of mkc1p by western blot with an anti-phospho-p44/ <dig> mapk  antibody that binds to phosphorylated mkc1p. as shown in figure 2a, panel  <dig>  mkc1p was activated in the mp65Δ mutant, whereas it was not activated in the wild type and revertant strains. for positive controls, the strains were stressed for  <dig>  h with congo red, whose cell wall-perturbing effect is known to induce mkc1p phosphorylation. also in this case there was activation of the cell integrity pathway. using the mentioned antibody, an additional band, which is usually observed along with mkc1p, and corresponds to the phosphorylated form of the map kinase cek1p, was also detected . the specificity of this antibody was ascertained by: i) the correspondence between the expected and observed band mw; ii) the disappearance of the  <dig> kda band in an mkc1p mutant and its re-appearance in two different mkc <dig> reintegrant strains, as already demonstrated in previous studies  <cit> ; iii) the barely detectable background in western-blots; and iv) the different levels of expression of the examined proteins on the different samples. to rule out that the differences in the band appearance and intensity were due to changes in protein level rather than just their phosphorylated state, we performed a western-blot analysis with anti-mapk and anti-kss1p antibodies, which revealed the total amount of mkc1p and cek1p, respectively . moreover, we assessed equal amounts of proteins before and after loading by protein assay  and by memcode reversible protein stain kit , as specified in the methods section. the act1p signal was used as an internal loading control . since the total level of mkc1p did not change in the mp65Δ mutant compared to the wild type or revertant strains, the higher intensity of the band corresponding to the phosphorylated form of mkc1p most likely resulted from hyperactivation of the upstream signaling pathway occurring in the mp65Δ mutant. overall, we concluded that the mp65Δ mutant exhibited a constitutive activation of the map kinases mkc <dig> and cek <dig>  with a further increase after exposure to congo red.

the above results suggest that the mp65Δ mutant may express cell wall damage response genes in the absence of exogenous cell wall-perturbing agents. we assayed the expression of the following five cell wall damage response genes: ddr <dig>  phr <dig>  stp <dig>  cht <dig> and sod <dig>  <cit> . figure 2b shows that of the five genes mentioned only ddr <dig> and sod <dig> had an altered expression in the mp65Δ mutant when compared to wild type and revertant strains. these findings suggest that the mp <dig> gene was required for the cell wall integrity and that ddr <dig> and sod <dig> may be involved in the recovery of cell wall function when the mp <dig> gene is deleted. overall, the mp <dig> mutation may have had a direct effect on the cell wall, given that mp65p is a cell wall-located putative β1- <dig> glucanase enzyme  <cit> , in addition to the indirect effects due to the altered expression of cell wall damage response genes.

morphological and biochemical properties of the mp65Δ mutant strain
to study the cell-wall defects in more detail, we performed morphological, chemical, cytochemical and cytofluorimetric studies, mostly in cells responding to congo red, which was the most intense perturbing agent. as shown in figures 3a and 3b, congo red-stressed mp65Δ mutant cells showed severe changes, such as swelling, clumping and formation of pseudohyphae and hyphae, compared with the wild type cells, which showed a normal yeast-shape appearance. the revertant strain showed an intermediate phenotype consisting predominantly of yeasts and some hyphae. furthermore, the deletion of the mp <dig> gene affected flocculation: the mp65Δ mutant grown with congo red showed marked flocs .

in the attempt to identify other indicators of cell wall changes, and given that mp65p is a putative β-glucanase, we looked for the presence and distribution of β-glucan in the cell wall, using immunogold labeling and by facs analysis. we used the monoclonal antibody 1e <dig>  which recognizes all β-glucan types present in the c. albicans cell wall  <cit> . as shown in figure 4a, the cells of the wild type strain had the expected intense and uniform labeling of the entire cell wall profile, with numerous gold particles randomly spanning cell wall layers. by contrast, the gold particles were much less numerous throughout the cell walls of the mp65Δ mutant, whereas the immunogold labeling was intense after re-introduction of the mp <dig> gene in the revertant strain. this suggested that the deposition of the β-glucan and its organization within the cell wall layers had changed in mp65Δ mutant strain, which was confirmed by the facs analysis .

we also investigated the possible chemical changes in the cell wall composition. as previously demonstrated in saccharomyces cerevisiae   <cit>  and c. albicans mutants   <cit> , the defective expression in the genes implicated in cell wall biogenesis and regulation may also result in dramatic changes in the chemical composition of the cell wall. hence, we measured the amount of main cell wall polysaccharide components . the comparison of the mp65Δ mutant with wild type indicated no statistically significant differences in any of these components . however, there was a trend of an increase in chitin content in the mp65Δ mutant compared to the wild type cells .

adherence and biofilm formation
to examine the differences between wild type and mp65Δ mutant strains in their adherence to epithelial cells, we used two model cell systems: the exfoliated human buccal epithelial cells  and the caco- <dig> cell monolayers. in the first system ,  <dig> ×  <dig> cells of wild type and mp65Δ mutant strains were incubated with  <dig> bec, and the adherence was expressed as the number of yeast cells adhering to  <dig> epithelial cells ± standard error. the mp65Δ mutant showed significantly reduced adherence to bec , whereas the revertant strain partially regained the ability to adhere to bec, reaching a level similar to that of the wild type . in the second system, the number of c. albicans cells adhering to the surface and those remaining in the supernatant were analyzed in a time-dependent manner . adhesion of the wild type cells to caco- <dig> cells was rapid and efficient: after  <dig> min, about 65% of the cells recovered had adhered to the caco- <dig> cell monolayers, whereas only 35% were recovered from the supernatant. after  <dig> min the percentage of adhering cells increased to 75%, whereas the percentage of cells in the supernatant decreased to 25%. the mp65Δ mutant cells showed significantly reduced adhesion to the caco- <dig> cells: after  <dig> and  <dig> min, the percentage of adhering cells was 38% and 43% respectively, whereas the percentage of non-adhering cells was 62% and 57% respectively. in the revertant cells, the efficiency and kinetics of adhesion were similar to those in the wild type.

to determine the effects of the absence of the mp <dig> gene on biofilm formation, we performed two quantitative in vitro assays , which characterize total and living biomass, respectively. as shown in figures  <dig> b and 6c, the mp65Δ mutant displayed a severe defect in biofilm formation compared to the wild type strain, and the introduction of a single wild type mp <dig> allele in the revertant strain substantially salvaged the defect. these results were confirmed by observation of the biofilms before and after staining with cv, a semi-quantitative colorimetric assay that does not differentiate between live and dead cells . similar results were obtained when the biofilms were grown in spider medium .

in light of these findings, we have now specifically addressed the role of mp65p in cell wall biogenesis and integrity, as well as the adherence to epithelial cells and biofilm formation.

also based on previous work performed with scw4scw <dig> mutants of s. cerevisiae  <cit>  and pkc <dig>  mkc <dig>  hog <dig>  <cit> , pmr <dig>  <cit> , och <dig>  <cit> , sun <dig>  <cit>  and crh mutants of c. albicans  <cit> , we first examined the sensitivity of the mp65Δ mutant to a range of cell wall-perturbing agents to determine the effects of the mp <dig> gene deletion on the integrity of the cell wall.

our data show that mp65p plays an important role in membrane/cell wall stability. this was evident from: i) the increased sensitivity of the mp65Δ mutant to a number of agents whose effects have been associated with altered cell wall; ii) the constitutive activation of the cell wall integrity pathway in the mutant; iii) the increased expression in the mutant, in the absence of stressing agents, of ddr <dig> and sod <dig>  two cell wall damage response genes which code for, respectively, a cell-wall protein and an antioxidant enzyme  <cit> .

interestingly, the cell wall defects consequential to the mp <dig> gene deletion did not bring about gross detectable changes in the cell wall chemistry, as seen in other mutants of β-glucanase enzyme families  <cit> . while further investigations are needed to detect small chemical changes, which are likely to occur in the mutant cell wall, we believe that the mp <dig> gene deletion may mostly affect cell wall organization, with associated remodeling of its main polymeric constituents. this interpretation is supported by the comparable contents of all the  <dig> cell wall polysaccharides , which overall accounted for more than 95% of the cell wall dry weight, and by the rather marked differences in β-glucan expression, zymolyase sensitivity and morphological changes on the other. in particular, the disposition of β-glucan appears to be affected in the mp65Δ mutant, which displays a much lower reactivity than the wild type cell, as detected by an antibody which recognizes both β- <dig>  and β- <dig>  glucan configurations. this would suggest that β glucan is much less accessible to the antibody in the mp65Δ mutant than in the wild type strain. this lower antibody accessibility to the target may modulate immune responses to the pathogen, in view of the critical role exerted by β-glucan polysaccharide in fungal recognition by the immune system  <cit> .

notably, the re-integration of one mp <dig> gene copy in the revertant strain did not induce a full recovery of the lost or decreased function of the mp65Δ mutant. this is in line with the repeatedly observed gene dosage effects in c. albicans  <cit> .

some β-glucanase mutants have been shown to be endowed with low pathogenicity potential which is not entirely attributable to their inability to make tissue invasive hyphae  <cit> . the adherence to host tissues or to abiotic surfaces is an important attribute of candida that is positively correlated with pathogenicity  <cit> . in c. albicans and c. glabrata, but also in the less pathogenic yeast s. cerevisiae, multiple adhesion proteins  have been identified, such as als family proteins, hwp <dig>  eap <dig> in c. albicans and epa proteins in c. glabrata. these proteins provide these organisms with a variety of adherence properties, such as their interactions with other cells  and with abiotic surfaces and host tissues. mp65p is a putative β-glucanase adhesin, which is critical to c. albicans adherence to an abiotic surface  <cit> . in this study, we explored whether the adherence to epithelial cells was also affected in the mp65Δ mutant. we thus compared the ability of the wild type and the mp65Δ mutant strains to adhere to bec and caco- <dig> cell monolayers by using two in vitro adhesion assays. in both assays, the mp65Δ mutant consistently displayed a significant decrease in adherence. these findings, together with the capacity of an anti-mp65p serum to inhibit almost totally the adherence to the plastic by the wild type strain  <cit> , highlights the more exstensive role of mp65p as an adhesin, in that its adhesion is not limited to inert surfaces. nevertheless, the decreased adherence of the mp65Δ mutant could also be indirectly due to the suggested alteration in cell wall organization, with a possible decreased cell surface expression of other c. albicans adhesins, such as those previously mentioned.

biofilms are typically found on medical devices, such as catheter surfaces, and they have attracted attention because of their persistence and resistance to antifungals  <cit> . given that biofilm formation begins with surface adherence and that mp65Δ mutant loses adherence to the polystyrene plates, as demonstrated in our previous paper  <cit> , we also investigated whether the ability of the mp65Δ mutant in forming biofilms had altered. as consistently shown by our data, the mp65Δ mutant displayed a strongly defective biofilm formation, in contrast to wild type that produced abundant biofilm.

CONCLUSIONS
the findings reported in the current paper significantly extend beyond the previously reported role of mp65p in hyphal cell wall biogenesis and actually confirm that morphogenesis and cell wall remodeling are intimately related issues  <cit> . the knock-out of the mp <dig> gene affects biological properties that are of potential relevance for candidiasis. together with the defective hyphal morphogenesis  <cit> , these findings provide some further functional correlates to the previously demonstrated loss of invasive and mucosal pathogenicity by the mp65Δ null mutant. overall, the mp <dig> gene appears to play a role in cell wall structure and stability which, by still unknown mechanisms, are translated into fungal virulence. for all of the discussed reasons, and with the previously reported evidence of mp65p being a major target of host immune response to c. albicans  <cit> , this protein remains an interesting potential target for therapeutic or immunotherapeutic interventions.
