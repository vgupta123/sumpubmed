BACKGROUND
dengue fever is an ancient disease that was first recorded in a chinese encyclopedia of diseases and symptoms published during the chin dynasty   <cit> . referred to as “water poison” in ancient chinese medical literatures due to its association with flying insects bred in clean water, modern science has now confirmed that dengue fever is a viral disease transmitted between human hosts by aedes mosquitoes, particularly aedes aegypti. the ability of aedes aegypti to adapt well to urban living environments plays a significant role in the outbreak of dengue fever  <cit> . currently, dengue fever is the most important tropical infectious disease after malaria, and more than  <dig> countries have reported infections, especially countries in tropical and subtropical regions  <cit> . an estimated  <dig> million cases of dengue fever occur annually. of these,  <dig>  cases require hospitalization, and  <dig>  are fatal  <cit> , particularly in developing and underdeveloped countries where access to healthcare facilities is limited.

in general, the dengue virus  is a plus-strand rna virus of the flavivirus genus of the flaviviridae family  <cit> . the dv has an approximately  <dig> nm envelope and contains a  <dig>  kb single strand rna that is translated into a single polyprotein followed by co-translational cleavage into  <dig> mature proteins. these  <dig> mature proteins consist of three structural proteins , premembrane , envelope ) and seven nonstructural proteins    <cit> . the nonstructural proteins are involved in evading innate immune responses, virion assembly, and the replication of the genome. the structural proteins play a role in the formation of the viral particle  <cit> . to date, the enzymatic activities of ns <dig> and ns <dig> are the best characterized among the non-structural dv proteins. based on a number of studies, the methyltransferase  domain of the dv non-structural protein ns <dig>  is thought to be a promising antiviral target  <cit> .

the stability of dengue viral mrna and the efficient translation are closely related to its cap structure. the 5′ end of the dengue rna has a type  <dig> cap structure , whose formation requires ns <dig> and ns <dig> enzymatic reactions  <cit> . ns <dig> mtase methylates the guanosine cap at the n <dig> position by transferring a methyl group from s-adenosyl-l-methionine  followed by methylation of the 2′-oh position of the first ribose nucleotide  <cit> . a side product, s-adenosyl-l-homocysteine , is produced from n <dig> and 2′-o methylations  <cit> . although mtase exhibits two distinct methylations, it has only single sam binding site in its crystal structure  <cit> . it has been suggested that the substrate gpppa-rna must be re-positioned to accept the n <dig> and 2′-o methyl groups from sam during the two methylation reactions. there are two binding sites connected by a y-shaped cleft. the first site is the sam  binding site, and the second site is a shallow pocket of the rna cap site  <cit> .

ns <dig> mtase has a globular shape with a seven-stranded central β-sheet surrounded by six helices . the crystal structure of ns <dig> mtase with sah and a nucleoside analogue, ribavirin triphosphate , is shown in figure 2b. based on the crystal structure, there are two complexes assigned to two binding sites. one site is for sah and the methyl donor, sam, and the second site is situated on an n-terminal subdomain for guanosine-5′-triphosphate  analogues  <cit> .

currently, there are no vaccines or drugs to inhibit dv replication and transmission. the presence of four serotypes of the dv  has hampered the efforts to develop effective drugs or vaccines against the dv  <cit> . infection with one dv serotype will result in life-long immunity to that serotype; however, sequential infection by other serotypes of the dv will result more severe symptoms. dengue hemorrhagic fever  and dengue shock syndrome  typically occur through antibody-mediated disease enhancement , either from previous dv infection  <cit>  or from vaccine-induced ade  <cit> . the unique properties of the dv make the design and discovery of effective vaccines and drugs against the dv extremely challenging.

in this work, we performed a computer-aided virtual screen of more than  <dig> million commercially available chemical compounds to find potential inhibitors of ns <dig> mtase. we utilized two different approaches: i) structure-based virtual screening using the crystal structure of ns <dig> mtase  and ii) ligand-based virtual screening using active ligands of ns <dig> mtase . structure-based compound screening was performed using the lidaeus  program  <cit> , which maps the active site of the receptor and screens it against approximately  <dig> million commercially available chemical compounds in its database. meanwhile, ligand-based compound screening was carried out using the eduliss  program  <cit> , which utilizes known natural substrates of ns <dig> mtase to find structurally similar compounds from its database. we discovered several compounds that fit into the two binding sites of ns <dig> mtase with a higher binding affinity than its active ligands. these compounds can be further tested to confirm their biological activities against the dv.

RESULTS
in this work, we employed two different approaches to virtually screen potential inhibitors against dengue virus ns <dig> mtase. a structure-based virtual screen was performed using lidaeus to generate a map based on the ns <dig> mtase binding site. this map was used to screen approximately  <dig> million compounds in the lidaeus database for those that fit into the binding site map. meanwhile, a ligand-based virtual screen was done using the ufsrat  algorithm implemented in eduliss to search for compounds that are structurally similar to the two active ligands of ns <dig> mtase, rtp and sah.

we then selected the top  <dig> highest ranked compounds from the eduliss and lidaeus screenings for further molecular docking experiments using autodock vina. even though lidaeus analyzed the initial docking of millions of compounds in its database to methyltransferase, it uses a course-grained docking tool that is essentially rigid body docking . this is the only approach available for working with large datasets. lidaeus tries to get around the rigid-rigid limitation by representing multiple conformers of a small molecule within the dataset. once lidaeus has identified the top small molecules, more accurate analysis/docking trials were performed using autodock vina for flexible ligand docking. this is much more computationally expensive than the rigid-rigid docking carried out with lidaeus. furthermore, eduliss does not have the same automated docking functionality as lidaeus. autodock vina was run to rank the proposed compounds from the eduliss screen based on their binding affinities.

in total, we docked  <dig> unique compounds from the lidaeus screen for molecules that potentially bind to sam binding site  and rna cap site  and from the eduliss screen using rtp  and sah  as templates. binding affinity calculations for all  <dig> compounds were carried out using an algorithm implemented in autodock vina. we identified  <dig> compounds with the highest binding affinities to the sam and rna cap sites  that have stronger binding to their respective binding sites than rtp and sah. the rational basis of selecting compounds with binding affinities higher than that of rtp and sah is that only compounds that bind to ns <dig> mtase with a higher affinity than its natural substrates can be developed as potential inhibitors. only the compounds that are ranked first for the sam and rna cap sites will be discussed in detailed.

validation of the docking
in molecular docking, the size and center of the coordinates of the grid box need to be validated in order to ensure that ligands bind to the binding pocket in the correct conformation. in this work, docking validation was performed by redocking co-crystallized rtp and sah into their respective binding sites. we found that the binding conformations of redocked rtp and sah reproduced the binding modes of the co-crystallized ligands with binding affinities of - <dig>  kcal/mol and - <dig>  kcal/mol for rtp and sah, respectively .

the rna cap site of ns <dig> mtase is an open and shallow pocket. there are three polar interactions formed between rtp and the rna cap site . the backbone oxygen of leu <dig> forms a hydrogen bond with the n <dig> nitrogen of rtp, and the backbone oxygen of asn <dig> forms a hydrogen bond with the n <dig> nitrogen. both n <dig> and n <dig> are located on a pseudobase moiety of rtp, which mimics the interaction between the guanine moiety of gdpmp  and ns <dig> mtase  <cit> . the backbone nitrogen of lys <dig> forms a hydrogen bond with the o1p oxygen of rtp that further stabilizes rtp binding. a hydrophobic interaction between the pseudobase moiety of rtp and leu <dig> of the rna cap site was observed. the aromatic ring of phe <dig> forms an aromatic stacking interaction with the pseudobase ring of rtp .

the sam binding pocket is thought to be more closed than the rna cap site. the backbone oxygen of ser <dig> and the nitrogen of gly <dig> interact with the sah molecule by forming hydrogen bonds with the carboxylic atoms of the homocysteine moiety of sah. the carbonyl atom of the asp <dig> side chain also forms a hydrogen bond with the amino group of the homocysteine moiety of sah. in addition, there were four hydrophobic interactions between the hydrophobic side chains of thr <dig>  lys <dig>  val <dig> and ile <dig> in the sam binding pocket with the adenosine moiety of the sah molecule .

dong and colleagues  <cit>  performed a biochemical and genetic characterization of the dengue virus ns <dig> mtase and identified important interactions between sah and the surrounding residues of the sam binding site. asp <dig> interacts with the amino group of the adenosine moiety of sah, while a hydrogen bond exists between the side chain of his <dig> and 2′-oh of the ribose moiety. four residues  were found to play an important role in n <dig> and 2-o′ methylations. that report emphasized the importance of the sam binding site for both methylations. there are slight differences between our result and the result of dong et al. in terms of the amino acids that are involved in the interaction between sah and the sam binding site. we identified three hydrogen bonds formed between sah and ser <dig>  gly <dig> and asp <dig>  which are not identified in dong’s work. however, our results confirm that lys <dig> and ile <dig> form hydrophobic interactions with sah.

inhibitors bound to rna cap site
we performed molecular docking on  <dig> compounds obtained from the ligand-based eduliss screen. these  <dig> compounds were ranked based on their binding affinities. the top ten compounds with binding affinites for the rna cap site that are more negative than that of rtp are listed in table  <dig>  the two compounds that showed the strongest affinites for the rna cap site of ns <dig> mtase were sph1-103- <dig> and sph1-101- <dig>  each with a binding affinity of - <dig>  kcal/mol. meanwhile,  <dig> compounds from the structure-based lidaeus screen were also docked into the rna cap site. the top  <dig> compounds with more negative binding affinities than that of rtp, indicating stronger binding, are listed in table  <dig>  the compound with the highest affinity discovered through the lidaeus screen was 28sph1-115- <dig>  with a binding affinity of - <dig>  kcal/mol.

compound sph1-103- <dig>  forms three hydrogen bonds between oxygen o <dig> of the carbonyl group and the backbone nitrogen of lys <dig>  oxygen o <dig> of the hydroxyl group and the backbone oxygen of leu <dig>  and oxygen o <dig> of the hydroxyl group and the backbone oxygen of asn <dig>  hydrophobic interactions occur between the aromatic rings of sph1-103- <dig> and leu <dig>  phe <dig>  ser <dig>  pro <dig>  and ser <dig>  the second potential inhibitor, compound sph1-101- <dig> , also forms three hydrogen bonds between the oxygen o <dig> of the carbonyl group with the backbone nitrogen of lys <dig>  oxygen o <dig> with the side chain oxygen of ser <dig>  and oxygen o <dig> with the side chain nitrogen of lys <dig>  in contrast with compound sph1-103- <dig>  only one residue is involved in hydrophobic interaction between sph1-101- <dig> and the rna cap site at phe <dig>  meanwhile, compound 28sph1-115- <dig>  forms a hydrogen bond between oxygen o <dig> of the carbonyl group and the side chain oxygen of ser <dig>  likewise, the side chain nitrogen atom of lys <dig> creates a hydrogen bond with oxygen o <dig>  two hydrophobic interactions are formed between the aromatic rings of 28sph1-115- <dig> and phe <dig> and pro <dig> 

benarroch et al.  <cit> , who studied the binding of rtp with the rna cap site of ns <dig> mtase, suggested a list of residues that are significantly important for ligand binding: lys <dig>  leu <dig>  asn <dig>  leu <dig>  phe <dig>  lys <dig>  ser <dig>  ser <dig>  pro <dig>  glu <dig>  and gly <dig>  our results show that compound sph1-103- <dig> binds to the rna cap site by forming interactions with eight residues: leu <dig>  asn <dig>  leu <dig>  lys <dig>  phe <dig>  ser <dig>  pro <dig>  and ser <dig>  these residues, with the exception of lys <dig> and ser <dig>  interact with rtp in the crystal structure of ns <dig> mtase. compounds sph1-101- <dig> and 28sph1-115- <dig> have fewer interactions with the rna cap site. only four residues are involved in the binding of these two compounds. even though compounds sph1-101- <dig> and 28sph1-115- <dig> have fewer interactions with the rna cap site compared to rtp, these compounds show stronger binding to the rna cap site than rtp. there are several possible explanations for this effect: i) compound sph1-101- <dig> creates three hydrogen bonds with the rna cap site at different parts of the ligand, thus distributing the strength of the binding all over the ligand molecule; ii) compound 28sph1-115- <dig> forms an aromatic stacking interaction with phe <dig> that mimics the interaction of the pseudobase moiety of rtp with phe <dig>  and the ligand binding is strengthened by two hydrogen bonds with lys <dig> and ser <dig> 

inhibitors bound to sam binding site
after  <dig> compounds obtained from the ligand-based eduliss screen were docked into the sam binding site,  <dig> compounds with higher binding affinities for ns <dig> mtase than that of sah were tabulated . the two compounds with the strongest affinity for the sam binding site were sph1-007- <dig> and sph1-111- <dig>  each of which had a binding affinity of - <dig>  kcal/mol. meanwhile,  <dig> compounds obtained from the structure-based lidaeus screen were also docked into the sam binding site, and the  <dig> best compounds are listed in table  <dig>  the best binder was compound 25sph1-103- <dig> .

compound sph1-007- <dig>  forms two hydrogen bonds and several hydrophobic interactions with residues inside the sam binding site. two hydrogen bonds are formed between the side chain oxygen of ser <dig> and the backbone nitrogen of gly <dig> with oxygen o <dig>  in addition, several hydrophobic interactions are formed between compound sph1-007- <dig> with the hydrophobic side chains of gly <dig>  arg <dig>  lys <dig>  glu <dig>  asp <dig>  val <dig>  phe <dig>  and ile <dig>  as for compound sph1-111- <dig> , there are two hydrogen bonds formed with the sam binding site. oxygen o <dig> of sph1-111- <dig> creates a hydrogen bond with the side chain oxygen of asp <dig>  whereas oxygen o <dig> forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone nitrogen of lys <dig>  meanwhile, compound 25sph1-103- <dig>  forms five hydrogen bonds between oxygen o <dig> and the carbonyl oxygen atom of ser <dig>  oxygen o <dig> and the side chain oxygen atom of asp <dig>  oxygen o <dig> and the side chain nitrogen atom of arg <dig>  oxygen o <dig> and the backbone nitrogen atom of trp <dig>  as well as the backbone nitrogen atom of gly <dig>  in addition, several hydrophobic interactions were found between compound 25sph1-103- <dig> and gly <dig>  cys <dig>  gly <dig>  thr <dig>  lys <dig>  phe <dig>  and ile <dig> 

dong et al.  <cit>  suggested that four residues are significantly important ligand binding in the sam binding pocket: lys <dig>  his <dig>  asp <dig>  and ile <dig>  three of the compounds we discovered create one or more interactions with the four important residues in the sam binding site. compound sph1-007- <dig> binds to lys <dig>  asp <dig>  and ile <dig>  compound sph1-111- <dig> binds to lys <dig>  and compound 25sph1-103- <dig> interacts with lys <dig>  asp <dig>  and ile <dig>  our results indicate that these three compounds can block the sam binding site by binding to its critical residues.

discussion
dengue and dhf remain pharmacologically neglected diseases  <cit>  despite the high mortality rate, especially in developing countries where access to healthcare facilities is limited. economic arguments have hampered the progress in discovering effective therapies for dengue  <cit> . the fact that dengue primarily affects poor communities prevents many pharmaceutical companies from making a serious effort to find the cure for this disease. therefore, our research group has taken an initiative to be involved in the discovery of dengue chemotherapy by utilizing a limited laboratory setting similar to those commonly found in many developing countries.

we chose to perform a virtual screen of more than  <dig> million commercially available chemical compounds for two reasons. first, the cost of a screening campaign is sometimes prohibitive for laboratories in poor countries  <cit> . therefore, virtual screening using computational methods may be performed to complement the “real” high-throughput screening  in less-funded laboratories. however, this approach has several disadvantages compared to hts. for example, receptor flexibility is sometimes ignored in order to speed-up the computational screening. second, the “drug universe”  consists of  <dig> molecules  <cit> . thus, it is likely that potential molecules for dengue chemotherapy can be identified from the large universe of chemical compounds. to find potential chemotherapeutic compounds, the best strategy is not to synthesizing more compounds, but rather to use screening strategies to reduce the size of the molecular universe, as eloquently stated by lahana in 1999: “when trying to find a needle in a haystack, the best strategy might not be to increase the size of the haystack”  <cit> .

performing virtual screening from a large database of chemical compounds requires access to multiprocessor computers, either in cluster or grid-based architectures. research institutions in developed countries have launched a number of grid-based drug discovery efforts  <cit> ; however, similar facilities often do not exist in developing countries. this fact motivated us to utilize two web-based drug-like compound databases  for the screening of commercially available chemical compounds as potential inhibitors of dengue ns <dig> mtase. the compounds screened from both databases were subsequently ranked based on their binding affinities to ns <dig> mtase using autodock vina run on a single personal computer. the settings used in our experiments are suitable for most laboratories in developing countries with facilities that are inadequate for hts and limited access to powerful multiprocessor computers.

in this work, we discovered several compounds that are potentially able to block the interaction between dengue ns <dig> mtase and its substrates, suggested that they may be able to stop the dv from replicating. the selection of potential compounds was based on their binding affinities. compounds with stronger binding affinities for the rna cap and sam binding sites than that of sah and rtp  were selected as potential inhibitors. in addition, the selected compounds must interact with residues that are catalytically important for the function of ns <dig> mtase. the mode of interaction between the compounds with the highest affinities and their binding sites was also discussed in detail.

rna cap site
it has been suggested that nucleoside analogues are among the best ns <dig> mtase inhibitors. these compounds are expected to bind to the rna binding site based on the fact that the strongest interaction between guanosine-5′-triphosphate  and the rna cap site is formed by π-π stacking between phe <dig> and the guanine moiety of gtp  <cit> . ribavirin, a nucleoside analogue and a broad antiviral agent, has been shown to inhibit the replication of several dna and rna viruses  <cit> , including the dv, although with weak activity   <cit> . ribavirin triphosphate  has also been shown to inhibit dengue ns <dig> mtase with low activity  <cit> . figure 3a shows that rtp forms π-π stacking between phe <dig> and the pseudobase moiety of rtp. other nucleoside analogues have also been synthesized as antiviral agents, such as 5-ethynyl-1-β-d-ribofuranosylimidazole-4-carboxyamide  <cit> , and 7-deaza-2′-c-methyladenosine  <cit> .

our screening results show that none of the discovered compounds can be classified as nucleoside analogues. nevertheless, the three compounds  show better binding to the rna cap site than rtp, as indicated by their binding affinities. our results are in agreement with other findings showing that molecules without nucleoside moieties may have biological activity against ns <dig> mtase. aurintricarboxylic acid was determined to be a potential inhibitor at the rna cap site of ns <dig> mtase by binding tightly to lys <dig>  <cit> , a residue necessary for correct 2′-o methylation of the rna  <cit> . interestingly, this compound binds to the two binding sites on ns <dig> mtase  with different ic <dig> values   <cit> . podvinec et al. also suggested two non-nucleoside analogues that act as potential inhibitors of ns <dig> mtase by binding to the rna cap site with ic <dig> values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  µm  <cit> .

sam binding site
in contrast to the rna cap site, the sam binding site is rather closed and long. this has hindered the development of several sam analogues as ns <dig> mtase inhibitors, presumably due to off-target activity of the compounds  <cit> . efforts have been made to overcome this problem. for example, lim et al. synthesized sah derivatives that bind selectively to the sam binding site at submicromolar concentrations. these compounds are thought to specifically bind to dengue ns <dig> mtase and do not interfere with related human enzymes  <cit> .

it has been suggested that the guanosine moiety is important for promoting the activity of inhibitors that bind to the sam binding site due to the strong hydrophobic contacts between the guanosine ring and lys <dig> and ile <dig>  <cit> . nevertheless, podvinec et al. reported that two compounds with no guanosine moiety bound to the sam binding site   <cit> . our results confirm the findings by podvinec et al. in that none of the compounds we discovered contain a guanosine moiety. all three compounds  bind to the sam binding site by interacting with several residues important for mtase activity, such as lys <dig>  asp <dig>  and ile <dig>  <cit> .

interestingly, the aromatic rings of compounds sph1-007- <dig> and 25sph1-103- <dig> create hydrophobic contacts with phe <dig> . phe <dig> was not identified as one of the important residues for mtase catalytic activity by dong et al  <cit> . however, in their recent publication, lim et al.  <cit>  identified a new hydrophobic cavity that consists of residues phe <dig>  ile <dig>  gly <dig>  glu <dig>  arg <dig>  arg <dig>  val <dig>  and leu <dig>  phe <dig> blocks the sam binding site in its native conformation, and this residue flips away from the cavity by  <dig> degrees upon binding to larger substrates. compounds sph1-007- <dig> and 25sph1-103- <dig> bind to phe <dig>  suggesting that these compounds may restrain or prevent the hydrophobic cavity of the sam binding site from opening.

CONCLUSIONS
we have discovered several potential inhibitory compounds of dengue virus ns <dig> mtase through virtual screening using structure-based and ligand-based methods. these compounds were predicted to bind to the sam and rna cap sites with higher affinities than sah and rtp. these compounds are commercially available and can be easily purchased for further biological activity tests.

all of the compounds we discovered in this work bind to their respective binding sites by creating hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with important residues in the binding pockets. we performed a detailed analysis of the atomic interactions between each potential compound and residues inside the sam binding site and rna cap site to identify which residues interact with the compounds. we have shown that the interaction between all compounds with the sam binding site and rna cap site are facilitated by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts with residues that are vital for ns <dig> mtase catalytic function. therefore, these compounds may be used as leads for developing an effective dengue drug.

our virtual screening experiments were performed in a laboratory setting that is commonly found in many developing countries. we decided not to develop an expensive multiprocessor computer architecture. rather we utilized two free, web-based drug-like chemical compound databases  and the freely available docking program autodock vina. the new algorithm implemented in autodock vina permits the high-throughput docking of thousands of compounds in a shorter time compared to the classical autodock program. thus, it only requires a single personal computer. similar experiments can be carried out in laboratories with limited funding and facilities. therefore, we hope that more researchers in developing countries can be actively involved in the global effort to fight dengue infection.
