BACKGROUND
chemosensation is an ancient sense, its origins going all the way back to unicellular organisms. in vertebrates and arthropods, two specialized senses have evolved. the olfactory sense serves a host of essential functions, among them search for food or prey, predator evasion, mate choice and reproduction, kin recognition and signalling of social status, whereas the gustatory sense is tasked with vital decisions about safety and desirability of food sources. neuronal representation and the logic of coding sensory input are very different for vertebrate taste and smell . olfactory sensory neurons form one , two  or several  extended sensory epithelia, and directly project to the  brain, whereas small clusters of taste cells  are found distributed across several nonsensory epithelia , and their innervating neurons connect to  brain stem neurons. moreover, different receptor families serve olfaction and taste . olfactory receptor genes are typically expressed in monogenic fashion, whereas co-expression of receptors shapes the response characteristics of taste cells . all these differences notwithstanding, closely related families do segregate between these two senses, gustatory t2rs vs. olfactory v1rs, and t1rs vs. v2rs, respectively.

basic features of olfactory and gustatory representation appear to be conserved across vertebrates . however, the high evolutionary dynamics of olfactory and gustatory receptor gene families allows for considerable variance in neuronal representation of chemosensory signals between species  <cit> . in particular, the relative importance of different chemosensory receptor gene families appears to have changed drastically between tetrapods and teleosts . teleost fish species possess only very small t2r gene families, whereas a much larger variability has been observed in tetrapods, with up to  <dig> genes in an amphibian species  <cit> . even more strikingly, the v1r-related ora gene repertoires of teleosts consist of the same six genes, with an occasional gene loss  <cit> , whereas mammalian v1r gene repertoires are highly species-specific  <cit> .

it has been proposed that chemosensory receptor family sizes adapt to the particular ecological environment of each species. mammalian t2rs and at least one fish t2r signal bitter taste  <cit> , and bitter substances often occur as chemical defense mechanism of plants. accordingly it has been suggested that the size of the t2r repertoire is larger in herbivorous than in carnivorous species  <cit> . mammalian v1rs are assumed to detect volatile pheromones  <cit> , which could be related to the larger size and higher species specificity of mammalian v1r families. in contrast, the homologous ora family of fishes is expected to detect hydrophilic substances, which may serve a different biological function. to examine such hypotheses it would be useful to establish the corresponding receptor repertoires of aquatic species from the tetrapod lineage.

teleosts belong to the ray-finned lineage of vertebrates, whereas mammals and other tetrapods belong to the lobe-finned lineage, which also includes fish like coelacanths of the genus latimeria and lungfish as very early diverging representatives  <cit> . one might expect the v1r and t2r gene repertoires of lobe-finned fishes to resemble those of ray-finned fishes more that those of land-living tetrapods. alternatively, the higher evolutionary dynamics observed for tetrapods could be a common feature of the lobe-finned lineage of vertebrates. recently, the genome of the coelacanth latimeria chalumnae has been published  <cit> , but initial gene searches have resulted in highly contradictory results, showing either a teleost-like small t2r repertoire of only  <dig> genes  <cit>  or a large amphibian-like repertoire of  <dig> genes  <cit> . the v1r family size has alternatively been given as  <dig> or  <dig> genes  <cit> . to clarify these discrepancies, we performed a thorough bioinformatic analysis of the latimeria chalumnae genome to delineate and characterize the t2r and v1r gene repertoires in this species.

we report here that latimeria possess an unequaled large t2r gene repertoire of eighty genes that exhibit strong evidence for positive darwinian selection, and whose genomic neighborhood shows increased density of repeat elements. both these features are absent in the closely related latimeria v1rs, which nevertheless show much less negative selective pressure than their teleost counterparts. together, these findings indicate that high evolutionary dynamics of t2r and v1r gene families are not linked to the loss of aquatic life style in tetrapods, but appear to be an ancient evolutionary characteristic of the lobe-finned lineage.

RESULTS
to delineate the latimeria t2r and v1r gene repertoires we performed a recursive search of the preliminary draft of the latimeria chalumnae genome  <cit>  provided by the broad institute  <cit> , using representative t2r and v1r/ora protein sequences from mouse, frog  and zebrafish as initial queries. no additional candidates were found searching an independently sequenced latimeria genome  <cit> . candidate genes were evaluated by phylogenetic analysis, using a maximum-likelihood method, phyml-alrt  <cit> . published t2r and v1r/ora sequences from lamprey , five teleost fish species, frog, and mouse were used as reference. since t2r genes constitute the closest neighbors of v1r/ora genes, each group served as stringent outgroup for the other one. in initial analyses additional outgroups were used to delineate the combined v1r + t2r group of genes from other rhodopsin-like gpcrs, with very similar results.we observe a clear-cut segregation with very high branch support between a monophyletic t2r and a monophyletic v1r/ora group . this allows to unambiguously assign candidate genes to the respective family.figure  <dig>

an unprecedentedly large t2r repertoire results from extensive gene duplications of a single ancestral t2r gene
eighty t2r genes were identified in the latimeria genome , by far the largest repertoire found in any species so far, nearly double the size of the largest previously reported repertoire, xenopus tropicalis . seventyfive of these latimeria t2r genes have been missed in a recent multi-species study  <cit> , possibly because validation criteria used there have eliminated many bona fide t2r genes. twentytwo of latimeria t2r genes have been missed in a recent multi-family study  <cit>  that seems to have investigated only previously predicted genes, which in our experience  <cit>  does not result in complete coverage of a chemosensory family. our approach is comprehensive and does not rely on any prior annotation whatsoever, as our inclusion criterion is based solely on phylogenetic position of candidate genes, see methods. six of the  <dig> genes we report contain up to  <dig> stop codons and may either represent pseudogenes or databank inaccuracies.  <dig> genes have been validated as full length, and all  <dig> genes contain the expected motifs .figure  <dig> 
three ancestral genes and a single large expansion in the latimeria t2r family. eighty t2r receptors of latimeria were compared with t2r receptors of mouse, xenopus tropicalis, and  <dig> teleost fishes . the phylogenetic tree was generated as described for figure 1; branch support is given as percentage. asterisks, potential pseudogenes, see methods for details. for accession numbers and genomic location of latimeria genes see additional file  <dig>  three ancestral genes are indicated by open circles at the respective nodes.



the vast majority of latimeria t2r genes  appear to result from a single ancestral gene via extensive gene duplications . another ancestral gene only went through  <dig> duplication events, resulting in lc_t2r <dig> to lc_t2r <dig>  and no gene duplication was observed for lc_t2r <dig>  the third ancestral latimeria t2r gene. we would like to point out that lc_t2r <dig> is also the only latimeria t2r gene with any ortholog in other species. three teleost t2r genes, stickleback t2r <dig>  puffer t2r <dig>  and fugu t2r <dig> are direct orthologs of lc_t2r <dig> . as such, lc_t2r <dig> represents the first available evidence for a common origin of individual teleost and tetrapod t2r genes. in total, latimeria chalumnae appears to possess three ancestral genes , two of which were subject to species-specific gene expansions. the extent of one of these gene duplications is unparalleled in any species investigated so far, but nevertheless places the latimeria t2r family in the vicinity of tetrapod t2r repertoires, and far away from teleost t2r repertoires, which only comprise 3– <dig> genes  <cit> .

the latimeria v1r family possesses close orthologs/paralogs of all six teleost ora genes, but also exhibits several gene expansions characteristic of tetrapod v1r repertoires
twenty ora-related v1r genes were identified in the latimeria genome , consistent with results of a recent phylogenetic study using data from an independent genome sequencing approach  <cit> . we expect this number to be very close to final, even though the genome assembly is still in draft stage  <cit> , since the genome has been sequenced with high coverage , and our gene identification approach is not sensitive to assembly quality. phylogenetic analysis shows nine ancestral genes , six of which are shared with teleost fish , and indeed three of these genes  constitute direct one-to-one orthologs of the corresponding teleost ora genes, e.g. lc_v1r <dig> is ortholog to ora <dig> and so forth. the remaining  <dig> ancestral nodes are all located within the ora1/ora <dig> subclade, and exhibit varying degrees of gene expansion, similar to observations for later-derived species in the lobe-finned lineage such as frogs and mammals, cf.  <cit> . a small group of three latimeria v1r genes  emerges as sister clade to the main gene expansion in frog, whereas a larger group of  <dig> latimeria v1r genes  is more closely related to the  mammalian subclade of v1r genes . these two gene expansions appear to have occurred independently within the latimeria lineage, i.e. after divergence from the most recent common ancestor  shared with tetrapods. taken together, the latimeria v1r repertoire shows the divergence characteristic of teleost ora families and the gene expansion characteristic for tetrapod v1r families.figure  <dig>

motif analysis validates the phylogenetic assignment of latimeria v1r and t2r genes and shows considerable species-specific conservation
t2r sequence identities can exceed 90% in pairwise comparisons, and the same holds true for pairwise comparisons of v1r sequences , consistent with an origin of such genes by recent gene duplications. however, overall both gene families are highly heterogenous, with frequent identity values between  <dig> to 50% and minimal identities down to 23% for t2r, and 19% for v1r sequences . it therefore appeared instructive to analyse the evolution of conserved sequence motifs of t2r and v1r families in the tetrapod lineage, and to compare it to the teleost lineage. to the best of our knowledge such motif analysis comparing v1r and t2r families has not been performed in any species so far.

thus we constructed separate multiple sequence alignments for tetrapod t2rs , tetrapod v1rs , teleost t2rs and teleost v1r-related oras, visualized them as sequence logos  <cit> , and compared them with those of latimeria v1rs and t2rs . over  <dig> highly and moderately conserved amino acids were identified, organized in motifs of  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids, among them some motifs conserved in several gpcr families, and many motifs shared between latimeria v1rs and t2rs, as expected from the close phylogenetic relationship of these two families . we identified  <dig> amino acid positions that are conserved in tetrapod and/or teleost t2r, but not in v1r genes. all but one show the same specificity in latimeria. furthermore, many amino acids are solely conserved in latimeria t2rs  and two amino acids are only conserved in latimeria v1r. in one case, the loss of the generally conserved cysteine in ec <dig> of latimeria t2rs is compensated by a cysteine in n- <dig> position, conserved only in latimeria t2rs. either cysteine may form a disulfide bridge with a broadly conserved cysteine in ec <dig>  finally, ten positions are conserved differentially in t2rs vs. v1rs . all these observations support the phylogeny-based assignment of latimeria t2r and v1r genes .figure  <dig> 
motif analysis for latimeria t2r and v1r/ora receptors confirms results of the phylogenetic analysis. sequence logos for  <dig> latimeria t2rs and  <dig> latimeria v1rs are shown. letter height indicates the relative frequency with which a particular amino acid appears at that position. amino acid conservation above 45% is indicated as follows: latimeria t2rs, magenta rectangle; latimeria v1rs, yellow rectangle; other t2rs, upper black squares ; other v1rs, lower black squares . white squares and rectangles, no conservation found; asterisk, the same position is differently conserved between latimeria t2rs and v1rs; grey bars, transmembrane domains.



amino acids that are differentially conserved between t2r and v1r receptors, e.g. yt2r/cv1r in ec <dig>  and c..yt2r/s..qv1r in tm <dig>  may be expected to be relevant for the functional differences between t2r and v1r receptors, and would be plausible candidates for a functional analysis by site-directed mutagenesis in future studies. in several cases residues conserved in latimeria t2rs and/or v1rs are only conserved in either the teleost or the tetrapod lineages, e.g. a latimeria t2r-specific ki motif in the ic <dig> region that is conserved in tetrapod t2rs, but not in teleost t2rs . examples for motifs conserved in teleost t2rs, but not in tetrapod t2rs include a central y in tm <dig> and in tm <dig> . such pattern of conservation is consistent with latimeria genes keeping features of the posited ancestral genes, that were differentially retained in later-deriving members of the lobe-finned lineage  and the ray-finned lineage . it remains to be seen, whether residues shared with teleost, but not with tetrapod v1rs and t2rs, might be specifically relevant for aquatic chemosensation.

overall, however, a high degree of divergence is visible within latimeria t2rs and within latimeria v1rs. such high divergence might be generated by positive darwinian selection, which has been shown to occur in several chemosensory receptor gene families . we have therefore examined nucleotide substitution ratios to obtain an estimate for positive selection in latimeria t2r and v1r gene families.

pronounced positive selection in the t2r family suggested by dn/ds analysis
we compared the rate of nonsynonymous  to synonymous  nucleotide substitutions  separately for all codons, to obtain an estimate for the evolutionary constraints acting on the v1r and t2r gene families of latimeria. a value below  <dig> for dn/ds indicates negative selective pressure, i.e. purifying selection, whereas values larger than  <dig> suggest positive selection, i.e. selection for diversity  <cit> . dn/ds =  <dig> equals neutral selection. to avoid distortion of the dn/ds ratio by beginning saturation of synonymous substitutions  <cit>  the ds values should not exceed a certain value, differently given as  <dig> or  <dig>  <cit> . we therefore verified that this condition was met for all latimeria genes  and all genes from species we examined for comparative purposes . in order to obtain a stringent measure of positive selection we employ two different algorithms, single likelihood ancestor counting  and fixed effects likelihood  to estimate dn/ds, and only report sites, for which both methods give the same prediction with a probability better than threshold, p <  <dig>  . this is twice the number of positively selected sites in frog t2r genes , and suggests a high evolutionary dynamic in latimeria t2r genes, which is unexpected, since latimeria genes generally are evolving slowly  <cit> . many of the positively selected sites even show p values below  <dig>  . positively selected sites are situated in extra- and intracellular compartments as well as most transmembrane regions . a small cluster of  <dig> contiguous positively selected sites occurs in the third intracellular loop, and another accumulation of four sites is observed in the preceding intracellular loop. a high variability in these loops could either diversify the interaction with signalling molecules or indirectly influence the positions of the transmembrane regions, which are believed to constitute the binding pocket for tastants  <cit> . nearly half of the positively selected sites  are within the transmembrane domains , not significantly different from frog t2rs , and at least some of these sites could exert a direct influence on ligand binding.figure  <dig> 
evidence for extended positive selection in latimeria t2r genes. selective pressure for individual codons is shown as consensus of single likelihood ancestor counting  and fixed effects likelihood  algorithm as implemented on the datamonkey server  <cit> . a) number of positively and negatively selected sites  for six clades depicted in figure 1; tel,  <dig> teleost t2rs; lc,  <dig> lc_t2rs; xt,  <dig> xt_t2rs;  <dig> ora2;  <dig> ora <dig>   <dig> lc_v1rs;  <dig> xt_v1rs. b-d) results for t2r clades are presented as snake plot . b) latimeria t2r sequences. twentyeight codons show evidence for positive selection both with slac and fel algorithms. c) teleost t2r sequences. no evidence for positive selection. d) frog t2r sequences. fourteen codons show evidence for positive selection with both algorithms.



in contrast, teleost t2r genes do not exhibit a single positively selected site , suggesting that selection for diversity may be a characteristic feature of taste receptor evolution in the lobe-finned, but not the ray-finned lineage.

the v1r family exhibits neither pronounced positive nor negative selection
teleost ora genes show very pronounced negative selection consistent with previous reports  <cit> , whereas latimeria and frog v1r genes exhibit no or nearly no negatively selected sites . however, overall v1r/ora genes appear to be under higher evolutionary constraints than t2r genes, since we observe only rare positively selected sites in frog and none in latimeria v1r genes . for latimeria v1r genes neither negatively nor positively selected sites were found using both prediction methods, although one of the methods suggests the presence of some negatively selected sites. thus it remains unresolved, whether latimeria v1r genes are truly under neutral selection, or merely under weak purifying selection, undetected by the stringent search criteria applied.

latimeria t2r and v1r genes are intronless
mammalian t2rs and v1rs are monoexonic, while some teleost v1r-related oras are known to harbor  <dig> to  <dig> conserved introns  <cit> . we therefore evaluated all latimeria t2r and v1r genomic sequences individually to obtain reliable exon/intron predictions. we find no evidence for introns in either gene family, including v1r <dig> and v1r <dig>  orthologous respectively paralogous to intron-containing teleost ora <dig> and ora <dig> genes. since the lamprey gene basal to both v1r03/ora <dig> and v1r04/ora <dig> is also intronless  <cit> , we conclude that the intronless state is the ancestral feature, and that the intron gains resulting in polyexonic ora <dig> and ora <dig> genes have happened late in the vertebrate evolution, within the ray-finned lineage .figure  <dig>

intergenic distances between latimeria t2r genes are larger than between latimeria v1r genes
despite the generally small size of t2r-containing contigs, three quarters of t2r genes are found with neighboring t2r genes. also, over two thirds of v1r genes are found with neighboring v1r genes, allowing calculation of intergenic distances . it is noteworthy that t2r genes, with their larger evolutionary dynamics , exhibit also larger intergenic distances, 31 kb median value compared to 16 kb for v1r genes . for two teleost ora gene pairs  we compared the genomic arrangement of their four latimeria orthologs/paralogs . the teleost ora3/ <dig> gene pair is locked in tail-to-tail orientation at few kb distance, cf.
 <cit> . while the corresponding latimeria genes v1r <dig> and v1r <dig> are also neighbors, they are severalfold further apart and have head-to-tail orientation. the latimeria v1r <dig> and v1r <dig> genes, on the other hand, share the head-to-head orientation of their teleost counterparts ora <dig> and ora <dig>  but lie much farther apart, with about 100 kb distance between v1r <dig> and v1r <dig>  five v1r01-related genes are located in the intervening sequence, all sharing the orientation of v1r <dig>  suggesting that several gene duplications of the ancestral v1r <dig> gene resulted in breaking the ancestral close association of v1r <dig> and v1r <dig> .

high density of repeat elements involved in gene duplication is observed close to t2r genes
repeat elements may facilitate gene duplication by increasing the probability of illegitimate cross-over during meiosis. in particular line, sine, and ltr elements  have been shown to correlate with gene duplications and inversions . an increased density of such elements close to t2r genes conceivably could provide a mechanism for the genesis of the record-sized t2r family. we have therefore analysed the distribution of repeat elements in the neighborhood of t2r clusters. since drastically different average values for the contribution of repeat elements to the genome have been reported for latimeria  <cit> , we have generated a reference value ourselves, using ten randomly selected scaffolds. we find that on average t2r cluster regions  contain  <dig> % more sine sequence and  <dig> % more line sequence than the reference regions . ltr elements constitute a comparatively small proportion of all repeat elements, consistent with other reports  <cit> , and show little difference between t2r cluster regions and reference regions .figure  <dig> 
repeat elements are enriched in t2r, but not in v1r genomic neighborhood. transposable elements  were identified using repeatmasker in ten t2r and four v1r gene clusters with up to 100 kb flanking regions and ten reference genomic regions . a) genomic sequence containing class i transposons  and class ii transposons , small rna, and satellites/simple/low complexity repeats is determined as percent of total sequence in t2r and v1r clusters  and the reference regions. color code as indicated. b) average density of class i transposons in 20 kb genomic segments centering on  <dig> t2r  and  <dig> v1r genes  and in  <dig>  mb reference region . significance was evaluated by students t test . c, d) the frequency of class i transposable elements is given as number of elements per kb sequence. the position of the genes is indicated by triangles; dark magenta, ++ ; light magenta,+- . c) ten contigs with t2r gene clusters are shown, from left to right and top to bottom, jh <dig>  jh <dig>  jh <dig>  jh <dig>  jh <dig>  jh <dig>  jh <dig>  jh <dig>  jh <dig>  jh <dig>  d) four contigs with v1r gene clusters are shown, from left to right and top to bottom, jh <dig>  jh <dig>  jh <dig>  jh <dig> 



the strongest association of class i transposable elements with gene duplication is found within 5–10 kb distance from the respective genes  <cit> . in fact, there is evidence for duplication of such 5–10 kb regions for another class of chemosensory receptor genes  <cit> . we have therefore determined the density of line, sine, and ltr elements in 20 kb sequence segments centered on each t2r gene that belongs to an identifiable cluster  . we report that the t2r surround regions exhibit a significantly higher density of line/sine/ltr elements than the reference regions .

finally we have determined for all t2r gene clusters the frequency of repeat elements in the entire contigs using small scale  binning . it is noticable that often pronounced peak frequencies occur in very close association to t2r genes, and on the other hand very few t2r genes are located in stretches of sequence devoid of repeat elements . taken together, analysis on three different length scales  shows an enrichment in repeat elements in the genomic vicinity of t2r genes. these findings suggest that the high evolutionary dynamic of latimeria t2r genes might be at least in part facilitated by an enrichment of class l transposons in the corresponding genomic regions.

v1r gene clusters show no increase in surround density of repeat elements
the latimeria v1r family exhibits only moderate gene expansion, compared to the t2r family. therefore it appeared instructive to compare the density of repeat elements in the vicinity of v1r genes to that found in reference regions as well as t2r clusters. we find on average that regions with v1r clusters  show slightly reduced line and sine levels . ltr elements are nearly completely absent .

in the detailed analysis of 20 kb surround regions of v1r cluster genes the average frequency of retrotransposons is not significantly different from that observed in reference regions . in contrast, the difference to t2r surround regions is highly significant . in the small scale analysis only  <dig> of the  <dig> v1r genes present in clusters is associated with a noticable peak frequency of repeat elements, although several such peaks do exist in the larger vicinity .

in summary, on all levels of analysis the genomic neighborhood of v1r genes is similar to control regions, whereas neighborhood regions of t2r genes show significant increases above control levels. indeed, the frequency of repeat elements in t2r gene surrounds is double as large as that observed in v1r gene surrounds. thus, the increased repeat density surrounding t2r genes is not a general feature of chemosensory genes in latimeria, but is correlated with the unusually large increase in the t2r family size during coelacanth evolution.

discussion
coelacanths  are so-called living fossils, as they are one of the few extant fish in the lobe-finned lineage of vertebrates, from which all tetrapods emerged  <cit> . the fossil record shows remarkable morphological consistency since the early devonian  <cit> , consistent with a generally slow rate of molecular evolution in coelacanth genes  <cit> . chemosensory receptor families are among the fastest evolving gene families  <cit> , and thus we were interested in the evolutionary dynamics of such families in a coelacanth genome. in particular, two of these gene families, the closely related v1r/ora and t2r families, are known to rapidly evolve in tetrapods  <cit> , whereas the corresponding gene repertoires in teleost fish are small and highly conserved  <cit> . it is worth pointing out that this tetrapod/teleost difference is gene family-specific and cannot be generalized, since in another chemosensory gene family opposing trends are observed  <cit> . the sparse information available for cartilaginous and jawless fish  <cit>  suggests that the teleost v1r/ora repertoires may correspond to the ancestral situation.

we report here that latimeria chalumnae possesses  <dig> t2r genes, of which at least  <dig> are intact genes, which is by far the largest repertoire size reported for any species , and nearly double as much as that of the frog xenopus tropicalis, the largest known repertoire so far  <cit> . the biological purpose for latimeria of such a large t2r receptoire is unknown. t2r receptors are bitter taste receptors in mammals  <cit> , possibly also in teleost fish  <cit>  and are assumed to mediate avoidance of potentially toxic food sources. it has been suggested that herbivores would require larger t2r repertoires to guard them against plant chemical defense mechanisms  <cit> . this correlation is weakened by our results, since plants are absent in the habitat of latimeria, the deep sea . however, it cannot be excluded that latimeria t2rs might have extra-gustatory functions, as has been shown for mammalian t2rs  <cit> .figure  <dig>

the unparalleled size of the latimeria t2r repertoire is unexpected, given the overall low mutation rate in latimeria genes, cf.
 <cit> . it is noteworthy that all but four of the latimeria t2r genes are derived from a single ancestral gene, thus the diversification of the t2r repertoire seen here constitutes a recent development within this lineage. the increase in latimeria t2r family size appears to have arisen by repeated local gene duplications, since the large majority of t2r genes are found in small clusters in several short contigs, which presumably will coalesce into larger cluster as the genome assembly becomes more refined. in fact, a comparison with an independent sequencing effort  <cit>  showed two of the clusters found here merging into a larger cluster. the significantly higher density of transposable elements in the immediate vicinity of t2r genes may provide a means to facilitate/enhance gene duplication in this gene family and could thus be part of the mechanism responsible for generating the large t2r family. additionally, closely related neighboring t2r genes themselves might serve as recombination foci.

genesis of a large gene repertoire requires not only gene duplications, but also an efficient path to neo-functionalization for these newly duplicated genes, which may involve positive selection. indeed we found dn/ds values indicative of positive selection for a large number of sites localized in all three major compartments of the protein sequence , with small clusters in two intracellular loops. these sites might contribute either directly  or indirectly via overall conformational changes  to diversification of latimeria taste responses.

we wished to compare the extent of positive selection in latimeria t2r genes to that observed in tetrapod and teleost chemosensory receptor families . however, numerical comparison between results obtained by different algorithms is difficult, and so we also have examined dn/ds ratios for teleost and frog t2r repertoires here. we observe that latimeria t2rs by far show the most pronounced positive selection of all t2r families analysed, an unexpected result considering the generally low mutation rate in latimeria genes, cf.
 <cit> . we have also analysed v1r/ora repertoires from latimeria, teleost and frog, and did not find any evidence for positive selection in latimeria v1rs. neither did latimeria v1rs exhibit the pronounced negative selection observed for the v1r-related ora genes of teleosts  <cit> . in other words, latimeria v1r genes are drastically different from their teleost counterparts, and resemble more those of later diverging tetrapods  neutral evolution of its v1r and fast evolution of its t2r repertoire.

it has previously been hypothesized that the difference between  teleost and  tetrapod t2r and v1r repertoires might reflect an adaptation to the terrestrial lifestyle  <cit> . furthermore these differences have been contrasted with the absence of such drastic changes in v2r  repertoires, resulting in large changes of the ratio of v1r to v2r genes upon the acquisition of the terrestrial life style  <cit> . however, the results we report here for the latimeria v1r family and in particular the latimeria t2r family do not strengthen this hypothesis. latimeria is a purely aquatic organism with a medium-sized v1r and very large t2r repertoire, whereas its v2r repertoire is comparable to that of teleost fishes . consequently, the difference in size between teleost and tetrapod t2r repertoires is not related to the water-to-land transition. instead, frequent gene birth events in particular in the t2r family appear to be a general feature of the lobe-finned lineage of vertebrates, and need to be understood in that context. of course, this does not exclude an additional role, aquired much later, in facilitating the water-to-land transition.

on the other hand, for another parameter, sequence divergence, both the v1r and t2r receptor families of latimeria examined here are more similar to those of teleosts than to those of later diverging members of their own lobe-finned lineage. while latimeria possess sister clades to all mouse and frog t2r genes, they have additionally retained a ‘fish-like’ taste receptor, unlike mouse and frog. furthermore, latimeria exhibits direct orthologs or paralogs of all six teleost ora genes, in contrast to the amphibian xenopus, who lost the majority, and mammals, who lost all direct orthologs, and kept paralogs of only two ora genes. thus, the latimeria t2r and v1r repertoires are more divergent than the corresponding repertoires of the later-derived tetrapods from the same  lineage. the gradual loss of ancestral v1r genes in the lobe-finned lineage correlates with loss of aquatic life style  and conceivably these six highly conserved v1r/ora receptors are specialized for detection of purely aquatic odor stimuli.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together we have shown hybrid features for the t2r and v1r receptor repertoire of a coelacanth, latimeria chalumnae. despite its basal position in the lobe-finned lineage, t2r genes of this species shows many species-specific gene duplications - conceivably facilitated by a high density of transposable elements - as well as evidence of positive darwinian selection characteristic for later-diverged members of this lineage such as amphibians and mammals. at the same time, latimeria retains most of the divergence characteristic of teleost chemosensory receptor repertoires, which to an increasing degree is lost in more modern representatives of the lobe-finned lineage. latimeria thus provides a counter-example to the inverse correlation of genetic divergence and frequency of gene birth events apparent for several previously studied chemosensory repertoires of teleosts and tetrapods  <cit> . furthermore, the large size of the latimeria t2r repertoire, comparable to some of the smaller olfactory receptor gene families, cf.  <cit> , suggests that the sense of taste may require unexpectedly high molecular complexity.
