BACKGROUND
the transcription factor runx1/aml <dig> is an important regulator of hematopoiesis and runx <dig> gene is one of the most frequent target of chromosomal translocations in cells of the myeloid lineage
 <cit> . interestingly, the runx <dig> gene covers  <dig> kbp of chromosome  <dig> but surprisingly, all genomic breakpoints for the leukemia causing translocations  and  are found in intron  <dig> of the gene
 <cit> . presently, factors involved in maintaining the structural integrity and/or enhancing susceptibility of these regions to undergo recombination are unknown. moreover, the breakpoint junctions are devoid of common dna motifs that can explain the high recombination frequency observed. interestingly however, topoisomerase ii and dnase i hypersensitive sites have been found to correlate with breakpoints suggesting that chromatin organization may be responsible for, or contribute to, chromosomal translocation formation
 <cit> . dna regions that exhibit dnase i hypersensitivity have been extensively associated with the presence of cis-acting regulatory elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, insulators and locus control regions
 <cit> . in fact, mapping dnase i hypersensitive sites  within nuclear chromatin is a traditional and powerful method used to identify genetic regulatory elements
 <cit> . therefore, presence of dhs in intron  <dig> of the runx <dig> gene suggests that transcriptional regulatory modules maybe harbored in this gene region. in fact, well conserved and functional enhancer modules have been identified in intronic regions of the mouse runx <dig> gene
 <cit> . these enhancers regulate runx <dig> expression in keratinocytes
 <cit>  and in hemogenic ecs and hscs during early embryonic development and also in long term repopulating hscs  in adults
 <cit> .

it is widely accepted that evolutionary forces drive the architecture of our genomes, and one of the cornerstones of this philosophy is that sequences that remain highly conserved between divergent organisms are likely to be functional. genomic comparison of diverse set of vertebrate species revealed many genomic intervals that have remained conserved throughout the vertebrate lineage
 <cit> . some of these sequences correspond to coding genes and non-coding rnas, however two third of them are unlikely to produce a functional transcript. collectively these sequences are called conserved non-coding sequences 
 <cit> . most of the identified conserved elements harbor transcriptional regulatory modules
 <cit> . therefore, comparative genomics based strategies are now being employed to predict genomic regions involved in transcriptional regulation, even in the absence of knowledge about the specific characteristics of individual cis-regulatory element
 <cit> .

in the present study, through combined application of comparative genome sequence analyses we have identified nine conserved non coding sequences present in the intron  <dig> of the runx <dig> gene. evaluation of transcriptional activity through transfection experiments of two of these sequences has shown that they can regulate transcriptional activity in a position and distance independent manner. moreover, when their transcriptional effect was analyzed in different cell lines, these regions exhibit cell specific transcriptional regulation of a reporter gene. taken together, our results suggest that intron  <dig> of the runx <dig> gene harbor potential cis-regulatory elements.

RESULTS
identification of conserved non coding sequences  in intron  <dig> of the runx <dig> gene
all the breakpoints mapped for the  and  translocations are restricted to intron  <dig> of the runx <dig> gene . previous reports have shown the presence of dnasei hypersensitive sites in this gene region
 <cit> . it is well established that hypersensitivity to dnase i is a hallmark of dna regions harboring cis-acting sequences such as promoters, enhancers and insulators, among others biologically active elements
 <cit> . therefore, we hypothesize that transcriptional regulatory elements maybe located in intron  <dig> of the runx <dig> gene. a useful indicator to identify a sequence with functional relevance is conservation through evolution. indeed, apart from exonic sequence, which comprise approximately  <dig> % of the human genome, there are an additional 1-2% single copy conserved nongenic sequences recognizable by human-mouse comparisons
 <cit> . in recent years, several bioinformatics tools have been developed to aid in genome comparative analysis. in this study, in order to identify sequences in runx1-intron  <dig> that may have a functional role, we performed an in silico analysis using m-lagan software available at m-vista 
 <cit>  looking for conserved non-coding sequences . these analyses are based on the premise that functionally significant parts of the genomic sequences evolve more slowly than their non-functional neighborhood. initially, we carried out a multi-species sequence alignment. to this end, sequences of runx1-intron  <dig> from  <dig> different species, ranging from human to pufferfish fugu rubripes, were compared. consistent with the evolutionary tree, we observed greater than 97% sequence conservation between human and chimpanzee  throughout the whole gene sequence. interestingly, comparative sequence analysis across species revealed presence of eleven highly conserved regions in runx1-intron  <dig>  these regions show greater than 70% sequence identity and are spread throughout the intron. moreover, they are highly conserved across mammalian species. these evolutionarily conserved genomic fragments range in size from  <dig> to greater than  <dig> base pairs.

we next examined in detail the conservation among mouse, rat and human in the runx1-intron  <dig> sequence using both avid and prolangan alignment programs for this analysis. our results confirmed the presence of eleven conserved non-coding regions  among the alignment mouse-human and rat-human, which were predicted by the two alignment methods. additionally, nine of the eleven regions also exhibit evolutionary significance ; therefore we continue our analysis with these nine cns . closer analyses of the cns l show a highly conserved region of approximately 230 bp that is present not only in mammals but in all vertebrate species analyzed .

a common characteristic shared by all potentially functional cnss is that they are present in a single copy in the genome
 <cit> . therefore, we analyzed the representation of the identified cnss in the genome using blastn program with  <dig>  as e-value. the results, shown in table 
 <dig>  confirm that there are no other copies of the identified cnss in the human genome. indeed, these results demonstrate that there is no chance at all of randomly find cns l and t <dig> sequences in the human genome .

interestingly, six of the identified cnss  are located in previously describe breakpoint cluster regions  involved in t formation and two more  localize in close proximity to bcr <dig> . moreover, previous work from our lab
 <cit> , have shown that in hematopoietic cells the bcrs are devoid of histone h <dig> and enriched in acetylated histone h <dig> and h <dig>  the same regions also exhibit hypersensitivity to dnase i and topoisomerase ii
 <cit> . all these characteristics are hallmark of transcriptionally active domains. taken together these results suggest that intron  <dig> of the runx <dig> gene harbor potential transcriptional regulatory elements.

cns k and cns l regulate transcriptional activity
transcriptional activation in higher eukaryotes frequently involves cooperative action of multiple regulatory dna elements located at distant places
 <cit> . the human genome contains several different kinds of regulatory transcriptional elements, such as promoters, enhancers, silencers and insulators among others. analysis of the vista enhancer database revealed that five of the nine cnss identified in runx1-intron  <dig>  are predicted as potential enhancers.

once potential cis-regulatory elements are identified, they have to be verified experimentally; this is usually done by placing the sequences into a reporter construct that is then used for transfection in tissue culture cells or to test for expression in embryos, either as transient assays or stable transgenes. therefore, in order to test their putative transcriptional regulatory role, we cloned two of the identified cns  in pgl3-promoter plasmid. we choose these regions because both are located in one of the breakpoint cluster regions identified for t formation ; they exhibit the highest conservation among rat, mouse and human  and cns l also include an highly conserved region . the pgl <dig> promoter vector contains a sv <dig> promoter upstream of the luciferase gene and allow for insertion of putative enhancer elements either upstream or downstream of the promoter-luciferase transcriptional unit. initially, we cloned either cns k or cns l immediately upstream of the sv- <dig> promoter region. the resulting constructs, named cns k and cns l respectively, were transfected in hela cells and luciferase activity was determined. our results show that both regions modulate transcriptional activity in a statistically significant manner compared to the parental pgl <dig> promoter plasmid . however surprisingly, they exhibit opposite transcriptional effects. in fact, while cns l represses transcription, cns k activates transcription of the reporter gene.

our comparative sequence analysis identified a highly conserved region of 230 bp at the 5’end of cns l, which is conserved between mammals and vertebrates . in order to evaluate if this region exhibit differential regulatory activity, we also cloned it in pgl  <dig> promoter vector ) and compared its transcriptional effect to the full length cns l. our results show that both regions repress transcription of the reporter gene and that there are no statistically significant differences in their effect 

taken together our results demonstrate that cns k and cns l can perform a transcriptional regulatory function.

cns k and cns l are putative enhancer modules
a hallmark of the enhancers is that they act as regulatory modules independent of orientation and distance to the promoter which activity they modulate
 <cit> . therefore, to test if cns k and cns l present this characteristic, we generated constructs where each of the cnss was cloned downstream of the reporter coding sequence. in these constructs, named cns k and cns l, the cns not only is located far away from the promoter, but it can also be considered that is in reverse orientation with respect to the sv <dig> promoter. our results show that both cnss exhibit exactly the same transcriptional effect, independent of the distance, or the orientation, in which the cnss are present with respect to the promoter  with pcns k, pcns l with pcns l and pcns hl with pcns hl, respectively).

another characteristic of the enhancer modules is that they exhibit tissue or cell specific activity. therefore, to test if this was also a property exhibited by cns l and cns k, we transfected the cns k and cns l in three different cell lines: hl- <dig>  jurkat and hepg <dig>  according to our previous results, when transfected in hela cells cns k and cns l exhibit differential transcriptional regulation activity with cns k activating and cns l repressing transcription . surprisingly, in the hematopoietic cells hl- <dig> and jurkat, both cnss repressed transcription of the reporter gene . however, in hepg <dig> cells neither cns k nor cns l exhibit a statistically significant effect in the transcriptional activity of the reporter gene .

an additional level of control exerted by enhancers, and other cis-regulatory sequences, is the three dimensional organization of the genome in the nucleus. in fact, the genome of higher eukaryotes appears precisely organized at the individual chromosome level as well as the total number of chromosomes. for instance, each chromosome occupies a specific region in the nucleus named the chromosomal territory
 <cit> . moreover, the precise location of a given genomic region, or a chromosome territory, depends on the cell-type analyzed
 <cit> . therefore, a direct functional connection between gene nuclear localization and activity has been suggested. for instance, the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors into either erythroid cells or neutrophils is associated with differential spatial relocation of chromosome domains in the two cell types, which relates to differentially expressed genes
 <cit> . this nonrandom nuclear position may also be relevant in chromosomal translocation formation, because for two dna fragments to be joined they must necessarily come in close proximity of each other. for example, the bcr and abl genes, encoded in chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> respectively, whose translocation leads to a fusion protein involved in leukemia, are located in close proximity in normal hematopoietic cells at much higher frequency than would be expected based on a random distribution
 <cit> . therefore, presence of regulatory modules in the breakpoint clusters regions involved in chromosomal translocations may be relevant at least for recombinant partner selection.

our results demonstrate that, in an hetelogous system, both cns k and cns l regulate transcriptional activity independent of distance and orientation respect to the promoter and that their function is cell specific. taken together these results suggest that cns k and cns l may act as cis-regulatory elements in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS
in this report we have analyzed the intron  <dig> of the runx <dig> gene where we have identified, through sequence comparison among different species, nine conserved non coding sequences. using transient transfection assays we have also demonstrated for two of these cnss  that they regulate transcription in a distance and orientation independent manner and that this effect is cell type-dependent. in eukaryotes, transcriptional regulation tends to involve combinatorial interactions between several transcription factors, which allow for a sophisticated response to multiple conditions in the cellular environment
 <cit> . furthermore, shared regulatory sequences impose genome architecture. in fact, two or more genes regulated together by the same sequence cannot be separated, for instance by translocation or inversion, without severely affecting their spatiotemporal expression pattern. interestingly, eight of the nine conserved region that we have identified are either in or very close to a breakpoint cluster region involved in t formation. this association strongly suggests a role for cnss in chromosomal translocation either by facilitating dna double strand break formation, for instance by establishing an open chromatin conformation in these regions, or by determining a specific subnuclear localization and therefore influencing the selection of the recombination partner.
