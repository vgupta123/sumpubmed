BACKGROUND
humans harbor an enormous number of microbes in the intestine. intestinal flora have been suggested to play a critical role in the normal development and physiology of host animals. symbiosis of human commensal bacteria forms a metasystem of nutrient uptake and endobiotic/xenobiotic metabolism whose capacities greatly exceed those provided by the products of genes encoded in the human genome  <cit> . further, gut microbiota are a key regulator of the human immune system. the immune response must be balanced between defending against pathogens while at the same time recognizing commensals as harmless  <cit> . the immune system of the small intestine, which is comprised of a variety of regulatory and effector compartments including peyer's patch cells, intraepithelial lymphocytes, lamina propria mononuclear cells and intestinal epithelial cells, has been extensively documented  <cit> . the normal colon, however, apparently lacks important structures/components such as peyer's patches  and paneth cells, and little is known about the immunology of the large intestine, despite the marked differences in both function and luminal environment between the different regions of the intestine  <cit> .

previous studies using germ-free -, bacteria-reconstituted gf-, specific pathogen-free - and conventional - mice have revealed that enteric bacteria have profound effects on the number and population of immune cells in pp  <cit> , differentiation of paneth cells  <cit> , migration of t cells bearing α/β t cell receptor into the intestinal epithelium  <cit> , development of ifn-γ-driven immune function  <cit>  such as th <dig> skewing  <cit>  and mhc class ii antigen expression  <cit> , and oral tolerance induction  <cit> . although functional genomics have demonstrated that enteric bacteria affect the expression of genes involved in the mucosal barrier and immunological defense  <cit> , the mechanisms by which these immunological changes are induced, especially in the large intestine, are still obscure.

in the present study, transcriptome analysis was performed on colon tissues from iqi mice, an inbred strain established from icr mice  <cit> . iqi mice are an autoimmune-prone strain: they induce a high level of antinuclear auto-antibody following mercuric chloride treatment  <cit> , have thymic b cells  <cit> , show age-related development of sjogren's syndrome-like sialadenitis  <cit> , and exhibit spontaneous skin lesions in aged females  <cit> . comparisons of picryl chloride-induced contact dermatitis in balb/c and iqi mice suggested that enhanced antigen presentation capacity in the ear dermis of iqi mice resulted in prominent t cell infiltration and more severe dermatitis as compared with balb/c mice  <cit> . high sensitivity in the mucosal sites in iqi mice suggests that this strain may be useful for investigating changes in mucosa-associated immune systems induced by bacterial burden. the present results demonstrated that bacterial colonization increases the expression of cryptdin-like products and decreases the expression of regulatory factors that are indispensable prerequisites for massive ifn-α synthesis. our investigation of the cells responsible for these changes by in situ hybridization and time course analysis of ifn-α production suggested that ifn-α plays an important role in the defense response in the large intestine.

RESULTS
genechip analysis of the large intestines of gf and spf mice
there were  <dig> probe sets whose expression levels in spf mice were significantly  higher than in gf mice . among these  <dig> probe sets,  <dig> were those of the cryptdin family. when we applied the same criteria, there were  <dig> probe sets expressed at lower levels in spf mice than in gf mice . the list of decreased genes contains  <dig> genes whose expression has been reported to be induced by type- <dig> interferon. table  <dig> lists glycoprotein galactosyltransferase-alpha  <dig>   and table  <dig> lists ifit1/garg <dig>  and four and a half lim domains  <dig> , which have been noted to change in spf mice or colonized gf mice in previous reports  <cit> . however, there are only a few additional genes, whose function is considered to be "professionally" immune-related.

verification of the changes in gene expression by rt-pcr
we next attempted to confirm the genechip data by using quantitative real time rt-pcr. because the cryptdin family consists of more than  <dig> genes with dna sequences of extraordinarily high homology, we determined the gene identity by dna sequencing. the rt-pcr fragments amplified using the primers common for the cryptdin family were cloned into pt7blue vector. dna sequencing has suggested that the members of cryptdin family predominantly expressed in the colon of iqi gf and spf mice are all cryptdin-related sequences; i.e. defcr-rs  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . no authentic cryptdins were found among the sequences of the aforementioned  <dig> clones. because of the difficulties in designing the primer/probe sets, due to extremely high sequence homology among these genes, further investigation using quantitative rt-pcr has not been done.

when we extended the criteria to genes with a greater than  <dig> -fold ratio of expression in gf mice as compared with spf mice, an additional class of immune-related genes were identified; namely, complement-related genes and mhc-related genes. the latter contains non-classical mhc class 1b genes which are known to be monomorphic or oligomorphic and expressed in a limited number of tissues, such as thymus and intestinal epithelium  <cit> . furthermore, mhc i genes are known to be type  <dig> ifn-inducible genes whose promoter regions contain typical interferon stimulus response elements   <cit> . in addition to the immune-related genes listed in table  <dig>  additional genes  were assessed by rt-pcr analysis  to obtain a more detailed picture of the changes in type  <dig> ifn-related molecules. the expression of ifn-α s , the end products of these signaling cascades, has also been analyzed but expression of ifn-αs was not detected in either spf or gf mice .

verification study using microflora-reconstituted  mice
to verify whether the observed changes were attributable to the presence of intestinal flora, we examined gene expression in microbiota-reconstituted mice. pregnant gf mice were cohabited with spf mice beginning  <dig> to  <dig> days before delivery. the offspring was kept under spf conditions until the age of  <dig> weeks and total rna was prepared from the large intestine. real time rt-pcr was performed, the results of which are shown in table  <dig>  significant changes in gene expression were generally similar to those presented in table  <dig>

production of type  <dig> interferon in the small and large intestines
to investigate whether ifn-related genes play a significant role in the immune defense response in the large intestine, we administered an oral interferon inducer, r11567da, and used elisa to determine the amount of ifn-α produced in the small intestine, large intestine, and blood. as shown in figure  <dig>  after  <dig> hours, high levels of ifn-α were detected in homogenates of large intestine but not in small intestine or serum. after  <dig> hours, ifn-α was also detected in the small intestine and serum, and at higher levels than in large intestine. these data suggest that the large intestine can produce ifn-α very rapidly, prior to the elevation of blood ifn-α levels, even before the commencement of ifn-α production in the small intestine, which contains an abundance of ifn-signaling molecule mrnas and would likely encounter the oral ifn inducers earlier than would the large intestine.

in situ hybridization
to elucidate the cell types responsible for r11567da-induced ifn-α production, we performed in situ hybridization on sections prepared from the small and large intestines with or without 4-hour r11567da treatment in spf mice . in situ hybridization with an ifn-α1-specific probe revealed that ifn-α <dig> was expressed in paneth cells, the small intestine, and discrete cells distributed in the lamina propria in the large intestine. similar results have been obtained with probes for other types of ifn-α-induced genes, such as ifit <dig>  irf <dig>  and oas1g . the localization of tlr <dig> mrna, which has been shown to be expressed in a limited number of cell types, including plasmacytoid dendritic cells  <cit> , showed a similar distribution pattern to that of the aforementioned ifn-related genes. both at  <dig> and  <dig> hours, the number of ifn-α mrna positive cells per mucosal area in the small intestine was larger than that in the large intestine . however, at  <dig> hours, r11567da treatment increased the number of ifn-α-positive cells in the large intestine but not in the small intestine , which is in good accordance with the results of our ifn-α elisa. the number of ifit1-positive cells was increased by r11567da treatment in both the small and large intestine, while the increase in the number of irf7-positive cells occurred only in the small intestine. the number of oas1g and tlr <dig> did not change in either the small or large intestine following r11567da treatment. at  <dig> hours, in the small intestines of r1156da-treated mice, the number of ifn-α and irf7-positive cells increased as compared with the control group, while no difference was seen in the large intestines. the number of tlr7-positive cells decreased in the large intestine at  <dig> hours.

immunohistochemistry
to identify the cells responsible for r11567da-induced ifn-α production, we performed immunohistochemistry on sections prepared from the large intestines with or without 4-hour r11567da treatment in spf mice. the antibody to isg <dig>  a typical type- <dig> interferon-stimulated gene stained discreet single cells or relatively small cell aggregates in the lamina propria in r11567da-treated colons . no signal was detected in the epithelial layers. multiple staining by combinations of antibodies including dendritic cell markers revealed that in the large intestine isg <dig> was produced in a small proportion of cd11b+ cells  and mpdca1+ cells  although more than half of the isg15+ cells were not stained by either cd11b or mpdca <dig> antibody. virtually no isg15+ cells were found among the cd11c+ cells .

discussion
in the present study, transcriptome analysis was performed on colon tissue. this approach to profile transcription in whole tissues may be limited in that the detected changes are derived from composite changes in plural cell types. however, previous transcriptome studies that have focused on intestinal epithelial cells   <cit>  did not appear to adequately characterize the microflora-induced immunological changes in terms of transcriptional profiling, even in the small iecs, the physiology of which is supposed to be profoundly affected by a variety of galt-derived cells and/or mediators. although recent studies have revealed a wide array of immune-oriented functions of iecs  <cit> , the spectrum of immune functions carried out by iecs is limited. by analyses of gene expression using whole colons from commensal gf mice, certain bacteria have been reported to increase the expression of ifn-γ-related genes and immunoglobulins  <cit> .

in the present study, the expression of crss was increased by commensal bacteria. crss are cationic peptides that have a pro-region with high similarity to the pro-region of α-defensins. although mature crs peptides have no sequence homology or structural homology to any other known anti-microbial peptides, crss have been reported to co-localize with cryptdins in the granules of paneth cells in similar amounts to cryptdins and to have potent microbial bacteriacidal activity  <cit> . a previous study using the differential display technique showed higher expression of crs4c in the small intestines of spf icr mice than of gf icr mice  <cit> . if crss function as the first-line defense against microbial invasion, like other various intestinal anti-microbial peptides, it is reasonable that the expression of crss in the small and large intestines of spf mice is higher than that of gf mice. however, apparently normal colons do not have paneth cells, which are the main sites of cryptdin and crs localization in the small intestine. although metaplastic paneth cells expressing antimicrobial proteins such as cryptdins and lysozymes are known to appear in inflammed colons  <cit> , histological examination detected no such cells in the large intestines of spf mice . because cryptdins have been reported to also be present in the epithelial cells of the small intestines  <cit> , crss may be expressed in the colonic epithelium. the localization and biological implication of crss remains to be elucidated in future research.

the most interesting finding of the present study is the possible importance of ifn-α in the defense systems of the large intestine. the most prominent difference in the expression of professional immune molecules was observed for genes involved in the ifn-α induction pathway. many of them, such as ifit <dig>   <dig>  <cit> , ifi <dig>  <cit> , tgtp  <cit> , gbp <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , irgm  <cit> . lgals <dig>  <cit> , and rsad <dig>  <cit>  were originally identified as ifn-α-inducible genes. one molecule, irf <dig>  is a rate limiting transcription factor located in the center of a self-amplifying positive feedback loop of massive ifn-α production  <cit> . microbial infection induces phosphorylation of irf <dig> protein, and phosophorylated irf <dig> is transported into nuclei to strongly induce the expression of ifn-αs and irf <dig> itself. in the presence of kinase activated by infectious agents, newly synthesized irf <dig> continues to activate the loop resulting in the explosive production of ifn-αs. the inducibility of ifn-α production in various tissues/cells and their steady state level of irf <dig> proteins are known to be closely correlated  <cit> . isgf3g  and stat <dig> are  <dig> components of isgf <dig>  a signaling complex that transduces the signal from receptors of ifn-α/β and induces the expression of ifn-α-related molecules including double-stranded rna-dependent kinase eif2ak <dig>   <cit> , 2'-5' oligozdenylate synthetase 1a   <cit> , isg <dig> ubiquitin-like modifier   <cit> , and especially, stat <dig> and irf <dig>  <cit> . changes in the expression of stat <dig>  the other component of isgf <dig>  have also been observed. in contrast, the expression of other interferon regulatory factors such as irf <dig>  irf <dig>  and irf <dig> did not show differences, and expression of end-products such as the ifn-αs, a <dig> and a <dig> was not detected. these data suggest that, although gf and spf mice usually do not express ifn-α, or do so at extremely low levels, once the stimulatory signals are triggered, they might produce different levels of ifn-α due to the difference in basal expression levels of rate-limiting regulatory factors of ifn-α production.

it is unknown, among the wide array of signaling molecules involved in ifn-α production, why only the relatively confined members showed differences in the present study. one possible explanation was provided by the results of ifn-α induction experiments. administration of oral ifn-α inducers resulted in elevated tissue ifn-α content in both the small and large intestines. however, in spite of the high basal levels of ifn-α-related genes, including irf <dig>  the production of ifn-α in the small intestine occurred later than in the large intestines. the extreme rapidness of ifn production in the large intestine suggests a possible involvement of type  <dig> interferon producing cells , which are virtually identical to plasmacytoid dendritic cells   <cit> . ipcs express extremely high levels of irf <dig> mrna and protein constitutively, and can produce  <dig> to  <dig> times more ifn than other blood cell types within several hours following stimulation.

this assumption was further supported by our in situ hybridization analysis using specific probes against the ifn-α-inducible genes, ifnal, ifit, irf <dig>  and oas1g, and the plasmacytoid dendritic cell marker tlr <dig>  in the small intestine, histological analysis clearly indicated that the cells which had positive signals for type  <dig> ifn-related genes and tlr <dig> were mainly paneth cells. in the large intestine, all signals were located in the mononuclear cells scattered predominantly in the lamina propria, although further examination is necessary to determine whether these signals were generated from the same cells. in accordance with the results of our ifn-α elisa, the number of ifna1-positive cells increased in the large intestine but not in the small intestine at  <dig> hours. the increase in irf7-positive cells in the small intestine may reflect amplification of the irf <dig> pool, which is a prerequisite for massive ifn production in most cells types except for ipcs. in good agreement with the results of ifn-α elisa at  <dig> hours, the numbers of ifn-α- and irf7-positive cells increased in the small intestine. the increase in the number of these cells in the large intestine ceased at this time point, suggesting that the detected immunoreactive ifn-α might represent circulating ifn-α in the blood.

these data, collectively, address the possibility that ifn production and biological defense by ifn in the large intestine is borne mainly by ipcs, presumably recruited from the bloodstream to the intestinal lamina propria.

finally, we performed immunohistochemical analysis to confirm whether the cells responsible for ifn-α production in the present study are ipcs/pdcs. we have screened several antibodies raised against type  <dig> ifn-related genes and found that the antibody for isg <dig>  a well-known ifn-stimulated gene  <cit> , stained the cells in the lamina propria of the colon at  <dig> hours after ifn-α inducer treatment. multiple staining by a combination of anti-isg <dig> antibody and various cd markers has demonstrated that isg15+ cells contains cd11b+ cells and mpdca1+ cells but not cd11c+ cells. conventionally, pdcs  have been identified as cd11c+b220+gr-1+ cells or mpdca1+ cells. however, recent studies suggested the phenotype of pdcs, especially in the peripheral tissues, may have a wide variation  <cit> . takenaka s. et al  <cit>  reported that, in the colons of balb/c and c57bl/ <dig> mice, many mpdca1+ cells exist but they are neither cd11c+ nor cd11b+, and no typical cd11c+b220+gr-1+ pdcs were present. these findings have also been obtained in the colons of iqi mice in our study : 1) cd11b+ cells were predominant in the colonic lamina propria; 2) the majority of mpdca1+ cells was stained by neither anti-cd11b nor anti-cd11c antibodies; 3) typical pdcs  were virtually absent. we have found that some cd11b+ cells and mpdca1+ cells were co-stained with anti-isg <dig> antibody, but more than half of isg15+ cells were double-negative for cd11b and mpdca <dig>  colonic ipc may therefore be comprised of multiple cell populations with unique phenotypic characteristics distinct from conventional pdcs/ipcs. accordingly, ifn-α production in ibd model mice has been noted in both cd11b+ and cd11c+ dendritic cells in colonic lamina propria  <cit> . however, the sensitivity and specificity of immunohistochemistry are limited and further extensive studies are necessary to clarify the functional and phenotypic characteristics of colonic ipcs.

among the immune-related genes whose expression differed in the presence and absence of intestinal flora in the present genechip analysis, the ifn-related genes, mhc-related genes, some complements, and immunoglobulins were expressed at lower levels in spf mice than in gf mice. this seems somewhat paradoxical because it is plausible that contact with high levels of microorganisms in spf mice may result in enhancement of certain immunological defense systems in the large intestine. along this line, chowdhury et al.  <cit>  reported that the expression of ifn-related genes including irf <dig>  stat <dig>  stat <dig> and tap <dig> in the small intestines was increased by the colonization of gf piglets with adult conventional swine feces. the discrepancy between our data and theirs may be explainable by the differences in various experimental settings such as the host animal , rna source , microbial status , and age of animals . however, we think that the difference in the period after colonization may be responsible for the difference in expression of ifn-related genes between our study and theirs. the inflammation induced by microbial colonization of gf animals has been known to be only temporary and cease within several weeks  <cit> . after the inflammation is terminated, histological findings return to a state apparently indistinguishable from the normal intestines of mice genuinely harboring the microbes. therefore, the up-regulation of ifn-related genes in the midst of or shortly after inflammation, and their down-regulation after a long period of resumption of integrity of tissues and adaptation to enteric microbes may be quite compatible and it appears that the ifn system may play an extraordinary role in the immunological confrontation, negotiation and reconciliation between microbiota and host animals. the immune systems of the gastrointestinal tract are known to have potent anti-inflammatory and regulatory properties. in the intestinal immune systems, constant exposure to bacteria-derived immunostimulating molecules may crowd up the threshold of activation of the inflammatory aspect of the immune system. alternatively, the immune system may be programmed to develop anti-inflammatory and/or regulatory responses to microbial stimuli as a default setting, unless certain specialized machinery such as toll-like receptors provide the additional signature indicating the stimuli are derived from specific dangerous pathogens. the down-regulation of immune-related genes may represent certain acquired characteristics of the intestinal immune systems to adapt to circumstances in which immune cells are continually exposed to vast amounts of commensal bacteria.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study suggests that microbial colonization, while inducing the expression of certain anti-microbial peptides, results in the down-regulation of a relatively limited range of genes responsible for host defense responses in the li. this may reflect the adaptation process of immune systems in the li to prevent excessive inflammation with respect to continuous microbial exposure. in particular, an extraordinary role of type i ifn has been suggested. further, the repertoire of anti-microbial peptides and the extraordinary role of type  <dig> ifn-producing cells in the li have been found to be distinct from those in the si.
