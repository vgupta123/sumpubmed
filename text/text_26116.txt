BACKGROUND
plasmodiophorids are obligate intracellular plant parasites that were for a long time classified as fungi but based on recent molecular phylogenies, are now classified as members of the protist subgroup rhizaria  <cit> . protists, and in particular rhizaria, are among the least studied and poorly understood subgroups of the eukaryotes  <cit> . the main characteristic shared by all plasmodiophorids is cruciform nuclear division in which a persistent nucleolus elongates perpendicular to the condensed metaphase chromosomes  <cit> . other common features are biflagellate zoospores, multinucleate protoplasts  and long-lasting resting spores  <cit> . plasmodiophorids are parasites of flowering plants, brown algae, diatoms and oomycetes  <cit> . some plasmodiophorids cause additional damage to their host by serving as vectors for viruses. two examples include the potato mop-top virus  and beet necrotic yellow vein virus , which are transmitted by spongospora subterranea  and polymyxa betae, respectively.

one of the most economically important plasmodiophorid pathogens is plasmodiophora brassicae woronin, the causal agent of clubroot disease of cruciferous plants  <cit> . this disease is associated with the formation of clubs or galls on the roots of infected plants, which interfere with water and nutrient uptake leading to severe losses in crop yield and quality. infection begins with germination of resting spores to release biflagellate primary zoospores. motile primary zoospores swim in a film of water in the soil, attach to the root hairs and encyst. microscopic observations by aist and williams  <cit>  revealed that after formation of the cyst, the penetration of the root hair cell wall occurs through a specialized projectile-like structure  that is formed within a tubular cavity . about 15 min prior to penetration, the cyst vacuole enlarges, the rohr is oriented towards the host cell wall and the end of the rohr swells to create a structure called an adhesorium. the stachel then passes down the rohr and penetrates the cell wall, which is followed by the injection of an amoeboid unit into the root hair. after entering the cell, this amoeboid unit goes through a synchronized cruciform nuclear division and forms a multinucleate primary plasmodium. primary plasmodia cleave into secondary zoospores that are released into the soil to initiate secondary infection by penetrating the epidermis and invading the cortical tissues of the main roots. secondary infections lead to the formation of secondary plasmodia that cause hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the infected host cells, ultimately resulting in the club-shaped malformation of the roots typical of clubroot. the secondary plasmodia cleave into resting spores, which are eventually released back into the soil when the galls decompose. the resting spores can survive in the soil for up to 20 years  <cit> , serving as primary inoculum to initiate new infections in subsequent years.

in common with many gall-forming diseases, alterations in the concentrations of plant growth hormones, particularly cytokinin and auxin, have been proposed to play an important role in the progress of infection and development of symptoms . altered cytokinin and auxin concentrations are associated with the stimulation of host cell division, cell expansion and loss of differentiation in p. brassicae-infected tissues leading to the growth of galls. the galls are a strong metabolic sink and provide this obligate biotrophic pathogen with nutrients such as carbohydrates and amino acids. using arabidopsis thaliana as a host, siemens and colleagues  <cit>  reported an alteration in host cytokinin response at early stages of gall formation and a higher auxin response at later stages of infection. this was supported by monitoring the concentration of hormones and expression of phytohormone-responsive genes in roots of a. thaliana plants infected with p. brassicae  <cit> . recent work has shown that p. brassicae-induced gall formation in a. thaliana results from a reprogramming of host vascular cambium activity leading to increased cell proliferation, a maintenance of phloem production but a strong reduction in xylogenesis  <cit> .

all crucifers including brassica crops and wild species such as a. thaliana are potential hosts of p. brassicae. the disease occurs in more than  <dig> countries and is more prevalent in areas where brassica crops are intensively produced such as europe, australia and north america  <cit> . clubroot was first detected in the canadian rapeseed or canola  crop in  <dig>  with the number of p. brassicae-infested fields increasing significantly over the past decade  <cit> . given the economic value of the canola industry to the canadian economy , the spread of this disease represents a major challenge. the predominant pathotype of p. brassicae in canada is pathotype  <dig>  as classified on the differentials of williams  <cit> , although pathotypes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> have also been identified . most of the research on the interaction of p. brassicae with its host has been limited to the plant response during infection. the soil-borne nature and biotrophic lifestyle of p. brassicae have hampered research on the biology of the pathogen.

to obtain insights into the biology of p. brassicae, we have sequenced, using a whole genome shotgun approach, the genomes of pathotypes  <dig> and  <dig> that differ in their host range and virulence, and re-sequenced pathotypes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  comparisons were made among these novel genome sequences, and also with the recently published data from a european pathotype, e <dig>  <cit> . we combined these data with a transcriptomic approach in two host species, b. napus and a. thaliana to gain insights into the processes that underlie pathogenicity, the manipulation of host development and mechanisms of nutrient acquisition by this pathogen.

RESULTS
genome sequencing and assembly
p. brassicae pathotype  <dig>  is the predominant strain of the clubroot pathogen in the province of alberta in western canada, and is highly virulent on b. napus but also infects other brassica species  <cit> . by contrast, pathotype  <dig>  is the predominant strain of p. brassicae in british columbia and ontario, and has a host range limited to vegetable brassicas  <cit> . additional file 1: figure s <dig> shows a comparison of the formation of galls upon infection of brassica by pb <dig> and pb <dig> 

to gain insight into the genome of p. brassicae and genome diversity of various pathotypes, we generated de novo assembled genomes of pb <dig> and pb <dig> and re-sequenced three additional pathotypes: pb <dig>  pb <dig> and pb <dig>  pb <dig> is the most virulent strain of these pathotypes  <cit> . single-spore isolates of pb <dig> and pb <dig>  <cit>  were propagated in the roots of their respective hosts, b. napus cv. dh <dig> and b. rapa var. pekinensis cv. granaat. dna from partially purified spores was used for whole genome shotgun sequencing using a roche  <dig> gs flx titanium platform. in addition, an 8 kb mate-paired library was sequenced for each pathotype . after removal of the host plant dna sequences, the remaining sequence reads were assembled into  <dig> scaffolds for pb <dig> and  <dig> scaffolds for pb <dig> . two pb <dig> scaffolds  and  <dig> ) were considered as potential host contamination based on 99 % identity to brassica ribosomal rna sequence  and were excluded. the size of the assembled genome for both pathotypes was similar and approximately  <dig>  mbp, which is close to pre-existing estimates for the genome size for p. brassicae  <cit>  and to the genome sequence of p. brassicae isolate e <dig> reported recently by schwelm et al.  <cit> . the estimated repeat content for pb <dig> and pb <dig> was less than 2 %, characteristic of a small genome with few repetitive elements. the average gc content of the genome was 59 % for both pb <dig> and pb <dig> 

the total number of predicted genes for pb <dig> and pb <dig> was  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. analysis of the single-copy core eukaryotic genes  via cegma  <cit>  revealed that the pb <dig> genome contained 92 % complete cegs and 93 % as partial sequences. the assembly of pb <dig> yielded lower results, with 85 % of the cegs being identified as complete and 86 % as partial.

close examination of predicted genes and rna sequences  mapped to the pb <dig> genome revealed that the majority of the genes were located in close proximity to each other along the compact genome of p. brassicae. the intergenic distance for the majority of the genes was less than 800 bp . analysis of predicted orfs supported by rnaseq data revealed examples of highly reduced intergenic regions with overlapping utrs indicating shared regulatory elements for at least some of the p. brassicae genes . compact genomes and reduced intergenic space have been reported for several other eukaryotes including two unicellular algal species bigelowiella natans and guillardia theta, as well as the microsporidian antonospora locustae  <cit> .

the overall features reported here for the pb <dig> genome are similar to the recently published genome of p. brassicae isolate e <dig> by schwelm et al.  <cit> . however, the genome assembly of pb <dig> was less fragmented than that of e <dig>  and a higher number of genes were predicted in pb <dig>  than in e <dig> . a comparison of the two proteomes identified  <dig> pb <dig> predicted proteins that did not have an orthologue among those reported for e <dig>  <cit> . a search of pb <dig> rna sequences expressed at various stages of infection supported the presence of transcripts for  <dig> of these  <dig> predicted genes. in addition, only five of the  <dig> pb <dig> genes did not have a match in the e <dig> genome sequence, confirming that almost all of the additional  <dig> genes were present as unannotated sequences in the e <dig> genome assembly. due to the importance of pb <dig> as a highly prevalent and virulent pathotype infecting various brassica crops, and also because of a more complete genome assembly , pb <dig> was selected as the reference genome for further analysis.

genome comparison of p. brassicae pathotypes
alignment of the pb <dig> and pb <dig> genomes revealed a close to perfect synteny with rare examples of inversion of small segments of the pb <dig> genome . the majority of predicted pb <dig> genes had an orthologue in the pb <dig> genome except for  <dig> genes that were unique to pb <dig>  with six of these having no homologue in the ncbi non-redundant  protein database and eight that matched hypothetical proteins . to gain insight into genome variation and its correlation with host specificity we re-sequenced the genomes of pb <dig>  pb <dig> and pb <dig>  a total of  <dig>  snps were discovered by alignment of the genome sequence of pb <dig> and the re-sequenced pathotypes against the pb <dig> reference. paired-end illumina reads generated for pb <dig> were also aligned to the pb <dig> genome. after filtering   <dig>  snps remained and were clustered into  <dig> haplotype blocks. one haplotype block was found to result from a single snp between the reference genome and pb <dig> illumina reads; investigation of this snp indicated that it resulted from a sequencing error and this haplotype  was therefore excluded . of the remaining  <dig> haplotype blocks,  <dig>  % contained more than one snp. comparison of whole genome snp profiles revealed that pb <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> were highly similar and clustered as one group, while the snp profile of pb <dig> was more divergent . the haplotypes correlate with the host range and geographical distribution of these pathotypes, with pb <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> being virulent on b. napus and present in the prairie provinces and pb <dig> failing to cause disease on b. napus and being prevalent in british columbia and eastern provinces of canada . without access to read data, analyses of the e <dig> genome could not be completed as with the other pathotypes. however, by direct sequence comparison  <dig>  out of the identified  <dig>  snps were found to differentiate the genome of e <dig> reported by schwelm et al.  <cit>  and pb <dig>  these snps were grouped into  <dig> haplotypes and showed that e <dig> clustered with pb <dig> .fig.  <dig> graphical representation of the  <dig> snp haplotypes discovered across four re-sequenced pathotypes. pathotype alleles are coded in green or red for the reference  or alternate alleles, respectively. clustering was performed using the default dist fuction of the stats r package



the p. brassicae pathotype  <dig> proteome
to annotate and assign go functions to the predicted genes, predicted pb <dig> proteins were searched for homology to entries in the ncbi nr, go and interpro databases using blast2go-pro  <cit> . of the  <dig>  total predicted proteins for pb <dig>   <dig> did not have hits in the ncbi database .

an ortho-mcl search of protein families identified  <dig> paralogous groups in pb <dig> with the largest groups having up to  <dig> paralogues. a blast search of the ncbi nr database identified matches for only  <dig> of the paralogous groups. a search for orthologous proteins identified p. ramorum as the organism with the highest number of orthologues matching pb <dig> proteins . among these were genes involved in protein and nucleic acid binding, atp and metal ion binding, oxidoreductases, kinases and atpase activity.

we searched the genome of pb <dig> for potential secreted proteins, which might act as effectors, using the criteria described in the methods. the total number of predicted secreted proteins was  <dig> , with  <dig> of these proteins having a probability score  of greater than  <dig> . from this list,  <dig> proteins were defined as small  secreted proteins . nearly 60 % of the pb <dig> ssps  had no homology with any protein in the ncbi nr database. sixty-three of the  <dig> pb <dig> ssps did not have any homologue among the e <dig> predicted proteins . a blastn search confirmed the presence of all but one  of these genes in the e <dig> genome  <cit> . comparing pb <dig> ssps with those predicted for pb <dig> revealed that  <dig> of the pb <dig> ssps did not have a homologue in the pb <dig> genome. further study is required to validate the uniqueness of these  <dig> sps for pb <dig> and to reveal their possible role in determining host specificity. we searched the ssps of pb <dig> for the presence of rxlr motifs. rxlr motifs identified in the effectors of oomycete pathogens are believed to function in translocation of effector proteins into the plant host cells  <cit> . rxlr type effectors are highly prevalent in phytophthora and downy mildew species  <cit> . a potential rxlr motif was found in only  <dig> of the  <dig> predicted ssps  indicating that this motif is not prevalent among the effectors of p. brassicae. the clubroot pathogen is evolutionary distinct from oomycetes and the lack or under-representation of rxlr like motifs might be expected; however, this pathogen resides within the host cell and in this regard it resembles malaria parasites . malaria parasites are also evolutionary distinct from oomycetes but have adapted a similar mechanism for translocation of effector proteins  <cit> . therefore it is possible that a similar mechanism for translocation of virulent proteins operates in p. brassicae. rxlr motifs were also reported for some of the predicted secreted proteins from e <dig>  <cit> .

analysis of host response through transcriptome data
two rnaseq experiments were performed to gain insight into the genes involved in host penetration, infection and gall formation. rna extracted from the roots of the clubroot-susceptible b. napus line dh <dig> sampled at weekly intervals  after inoculation with pb <dig> spores was sequenced. sequences generated for rna prepared from the roots of dh <dig> plants mock inoculated with water at the same time points served as controls. in addition, we sequenced rna from control and infected roots or hypocotyls of a. thaliana plants at the onset  and at late stages  of gall formation with three independent biological replicates. this second experiment used a population of p. brassicae described by malinowski et al.  <cit> .

analysis of differential expression in infected b. napus found significant changes in the expression of  <dig> pb <dig> genes during the 6-week course of infection . within the differentially expressed genes there were genes involved in carbohydrate processing, amino-sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, transporters, cytoskeleton, motor proteins and flagella-associated proteins. of the differentially regulated transcripts,  <dig> were genes encoding for predicted secreted proteins with  <dig> of them being ssps. hydrolases and peptidases were the most common differentially regulated secreted proteins. for the infected a. thaliana samples, ~ <dig> million paired-end reads were obtained from each sample. for the  <dig> dpi samples, ~13 %  of the paired reads matched the p. brassicae genome in both hypocotyl and root samples. for the  <dig> dpi samples, 48 % of the paired reads  from hypocotyl tissue and somewhat less  from root tissue matched the p. brassicae genome. the root and hypocotyl samples at each time-point were very similar to each other. only  <dig> and  <dig> genes showed differential expression  between the  <dig> dpi and  <dig> dpi hypocotyl and root tissue, respectively. in contrast, gene expression differed markedly between the  <dig> and  <dig> dpi samples within each tissue . genes that were differentially up- or down-regulated  between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi samples in both tissue types were identified using deseq <dig> and go terms analysed using blast2go. bar charts showing go terms that were significantly over-represented in genes that were differentially expressed between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi are shown in additional file 11: figure s <dig>  several go terms associated with cytoskeletal and membrane activities  were down-regulated at  <dig> dpi compared with  <dig> dpi, indicative of a shift in metabolic processes associated with the change from plasmodial growth form to spore formation. many genes associated with general cellular metabolism  showed the opposite pattern, with enrichment in the later stages of gall development and spore formation.

p. brassicae manipulates host defence responses
a number of lines of evidence support the view that p. brassicae, in common with many other biotrophic pathogens, manipulates the defence responses of its hosts . analysis of differentially expressed putative pb <dig> effectors within the first 6 weeks post-inoculation provided evidence for the manipulation of plant defence, by the induction of protease inhibitors and possibly suppression of salicylic acid -induced defence. pairwise comparisons of b. napus genes differentially expressed in response to pb <dig> infection using the application hormonometer  <cit>  showed that salicylic acid mediated responses at the earliest stages of infection were negatively correlated with the a. thaliana gene expression profile in response to sa . in addition, the expression of a p. brassicae predicted secreted protein  identified as a benzoic acid/salicylic acid methyltransferase   was extremely low in b. napus infected roots during the first week after inoculation, but increased in week  <dig> and peaked at weeks  <dig> and  <dig>  likewise, expression was higher in infected a. thaliana tissue at  <dig> dpi than at  <dig> dpi. a similar expression pattern for this gene was reported recently by ludwig-müller et al.  <cit> . the authors also confirmed the methyltransferase activity of this enzyme and suggested a possible role for this enzyme in inactivating plant defence by converting sa  to mesa , which acts as a mobile signal in systemic acquired resistance  in plants. transient expression of pb3-bsmt in tobacco induced sar, as was evident by increased resistance against pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci in distal leaves .

hallmarks of biotrophy in the p. brassicae genome
as on obligate biotroph, p. brassicae relies entirely on a living host for completion of its life cycle. a common feature of biotrophic fungal and oomycete pathogens sequenced to date is the reduction of plant cell wall degrading enzymes and inability to synthesize important metabolites  <cit> . we used the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  automated annotation server to identify biosynthetic pathways that are present in the p. brassicae transcript models. we also searched manually the dna sequence of the genome in case the transcript models were incomplete.

toxin production
the genomes of obligate biotrophic plant pathogens typically have few genes associated with pathogenicity that are prevalent in necrotrophic pathogens. many necrotrophs contain polyketide synthases  that are involved in the production of secondary metabolites such as toxins. the genomes of the necrotrophs magnaporthe oryzae, fusarium graminearum and cochliobolus heterostrophus are reported to encode up to  <dig> pkss, but the p. brassicae pb <dig> genome contains only one  which was expressed weakly during gall formation.

cell wall degrading enzymes
another feature of biotrophy is a reduction in plant cell wall degrading enzymes . a search of the carbohydrate-active enzymes  database for cwdes identified  <dig> cwdes enzymes in pb <dig>  which is nearly half of the number reported for necrotrophic and hemibiotrophic fungal plant pathogens. figure  <dig> shows a heat map of normalised expression for these genes in the b. napus and arabidopsis transcriptomes. pb <dig> lacks gh <dig> , gh <dig>  and pectate lyases  of groups pl <dig> and pl <dig>  which are also reported to be absent from the genome of other biotrophic pathogens  <cit> . the only exception was the presence of one gene  encoding for a cellobiohydrolase . the major classes of cwdes enzymes found in the pb <dig> were those for xylan  degradation such as carbohydrate esterase  ce1-ce <dig> and glycoside hydrolase  family  <dig>  two of the most abundant gh families were gh <dig> and gh <dig> that act on chitin and chitosan, respectively. also a carbohydrate-binding module  family  <dig>  which binds chitin, was the most prevalent of the cbm identified in pb <dig> and pb <dig>  all of the predicted pb <dig> carbohydrate-active enzymes are listed in the additional file 14: table s <dig>  although phylogenetically distant from fungi, chitin seems to be prevalent in p. brassicae. chitin is a major component  of the wall of p. brassicae resting spores  <cit> . in their analysis of the e <dig> clubroot genome schwelm et al.  <cit>  identified the importance of chitinases and chitin-binding proteins in infection.fig.  <dig> a heat map of normalised gene expression  of carbohydrate active enzymes in infected b. napus  and a. thaliana hypocotyl   and root  tissues at the onset  and late  stages of gall formation. samples are ordered by similarity but sample similarity dendrograms have been omitted for clarity. aa: auxillary activities, cbm: carbohydrate binding modules, ce: carbohydrate esterases, gh: glycoside hydrolases, gt, glycosyl transferases, pl: pectate lyases. the numbers to the right refer to the class of carbohydrate binding modules as listed in additional file 10: table s5



interestingly, one of the pb <dig> genes with a predicted chitin-binding domain  was highly expressed in the first week of infection of b. napus, with the expression significantly reduced in week  <dig>  and weakly expressed thereafter . a blastp search of ncbi identified a fusarium fujikuroi  chitinase as the best hit . fungal chitinases play a role in cell division, sporulation and spore germination among several other functions  <cit> . given the timing of the expression of this pb <dig> predicted chitinase, it is plausible that this gene is involved in the germination and formation of spores. in addition, there are several chitin synthases, gh family  <dig> and a chitin deacetylase , which were differentially expressed in p. brassicae during b. napus infection. one predicted cda gene  was significantly up-regulated in weeks 3– <dig> after inoculation . another gene  predicted as a cda/polysaccharide deacetylase was significantly up-regulated in the first week of infection. in fungi, it has been suggested that modification of surface chitin by cda could result in protection of the cell wall from enzymatic hydrolysis, and help to avoid generation of an auto-catalytic defence response system in the invaded host plant  <cit> . collectively, these data provide a picture of the fine regulation of genes involved in the synthesis, turn-over  and modification  of chitin in p. brassicae, which correlates with the various life stages of the pathogen.

nutrient acquisition
the p. brassicae genome contains a complete molybdopterin biosynthetic pathway but the thiamine biosynthetic pathway is absent. eleven putative thiamine transporters were identified within the pb <dig> genome, consistent with the acquisition of this essential vitamin from its host. the genome encoded a sulfite oxidase but nitrate reductase was missing, with nitrogen acquired from the host in more complex forms.

additional file 15: table s <dig> shows the biosynthetic pathways for amino acids and their relative completeness in the p. brassicae genome. the shikimic acid pathway to chorismate was complete with incomplete evidence supporting the synthesis of tyr and phe. however, the branch via anthranilate to trp was absent. the his and val/leu/ile pathways were also absent. incomplete pathways were present for thr, met, arg and lys. a complete understanding of the biosynthetic capacity of p. brassicae will require further investigation, but it is clear that this obligate biotroph has lost the capacity to synthesise a number of amino acids and thus must acquire them from the host. the predicted transcriptome contained  <dig> putative amino acid transporters .

inspection of the p. brassicae genome showed a complete glycolytic and tca cycle, indicating a capacity for the utilization of carbohydrate from the host for energy production. however, unlike many biotrophic pathogens , there was no evidence for extracellular invertase genes that would degrade host apoplastic sucrose. therefore p. brassicae is likely to take up sugars directly. the genome contained  <dig> abc transporters, some of which may be involved in nutrient acquisition. pbpt3sc00087_am_ <dig> _ <dig> showed homology  to a sweet sugar permease from ascaris suum, pbpt3sc00016_a_ <dig> _ <dig> was predicted to encode a sucrose proton transporter, whilst pbpt3sc00069_am_ <dig> _ <dig> and pbpt3sc00030_a_ <dig> _ <dig> encode putative monosaccharide transporters. the predicted sucrose transporters were expressed most strongly in developing galls  indicating that these genes may play a role in the development of sink strength during gall formation.

during the annotation process, in which predicted gene sequences were compared with known proteins in the kegg, a series of matches were found against proteins with prokaryotic substrate binding domains. inspection of these sequences found that these encoded a hitherto unknown class of eukaryotic transporters in which a prokaryotic substrate binding domain is fused to a  <dig> alpha-helical transmembrane domain. the structure, predicted solutes transported and expression pattern are shown in fig.  <dig>  no such fusion proteins were found in any other eukaryotic genome suggesting that this class of transporter is unique to p. brassicae. the gene sequences are present within the e <dig> genome but either not annotated as genes or annotated as two separate genes. however, our transcriptome analysis shows clearly that these are single coding regions in each case. although characterisation of the substrates transported by these proteins requires experimental confirmation, sequence homology suggests that pbpt3sc00003_am_ <dig> _ <dig>  pbpt3sc00030_s_ <dig> _ <dig>  pbpt3sc00030_am_ <dig> _ <dig> and pbpt3sc00018_am_ <dig> _ <dig> encode sugar  transporters, whilst pbpt3sc00024_a_ <dig> _1a, pbpt3sc00024_a_ <dig> _1b, pbpt3sc00024_g_ <dig> _ <dig> and pbpt3sc00100_sm_ <dig> _ <dig> encode phosphate transporters. the majority of these transporters were expressed early in infection and during gall development, suggesting they play roles in nutrient acquisition at these key developmental stages.fig.  <dig>

in common with many pathogens, p. brassicae has been shown to synthesize trehalose. the pb <dig> genome contained  <dig> genes encoding trehalose phosphate synthase   and single genes encoding trehalose phosphate phosphatase  and trehalase  in agreement with  <cit> . the tps gene pbpt3sc00059_a_ <dig> _ <dig> matched the fragment isolated by  <cit>  and the corresponding complete gene reported elsewhere  <cit> .

regulation of growth hormones during p. brassicae infection
the plant hormones cytokinin and auxin have long been implicated in pb infection and symptom development. current models favour the involvement of cytokinin in early stages of gall formation with auxin up-regulated at later stages. this model was confirmed by the expression profile of genes, related to plant hormone pathways, during the course of infection of b. napus with pb <dig> . the picture, however, remains complex  <cit> . many gall-forming pathogens have the ability to synthesize plant growth regulators, or related substances and modulate the phytohormone response of the host. for example, rhodococcus fascians and agrobacterium tumefaciens produce auxin and cytokinins to modulate host plant physiology  <cit> . there is also evidence that pb can synthesize cytokinin albeit in limit amounts  <cit> .

cytokinins are derived from adenine and are classified as isoprenoid or aromatic cks based on their side chain. common isoprenoid cks in plants are trans-zeatin , cis-zeatin  and isopentenyl adenine . ck biosynthesis in plants occurs via two routes. the synthesis of ip and tz is catalyzed by an isopentenyl transferase  that preferentially uses adp or atp as the isoprenoid acceptor from dimethylallylpyrophosphate . alternatively, ipts that preferentially use trna as a substrate lead to the synthesis of cz. in a. thaliana, adenine ipts are the most important with ip and tz the dominant active cks – the cz content is low . we searched the predicted proteome of pb <dig> for genes related to cytokinin biosynthesis using the kegg automatic annotation server . two genes were identified with close homology to ipt, pbpt3sc00024_sm_ <dig> _ <dig> and pbpt3sc00040_am_ <dig> _ <dig>  although these enzymes were predicted to be trna ipts associated with cz production, identification of substrate specificity via sequence alignment is unreliable and these may be adenine ipts. we favour this latter view as  <cit>  found that isolated plasmodia supplied with adenine had the capacity to synthesise tz and infected arabidopsis plants do not contain significant amounts of cz  <cit> . the genome also contained all of the genes required for the synthesis of isopentenyl pyrophosphate from acetyl coa via the mevalonate pathway and its conversion to dmapp by isopentenyl-diphosphate_delta-isomerase  .

a predicted protein  with strong homology to an indole-3-acetic acid amido synthetase that synthesizes auxin-amino acid conjugates was also present in the genome. in plants this process is involved in auxin homeostasis and clubroot has been suggested to act as a sink for auxin  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
studies into the genetics and biology of p. brassicae have proven to be difficult because this pathogen is a soil-borne obligate biotroph completing its life cycle inside the host plant cell. the draft genome sequences presented here, along with the re-sequencing data of multiple pathotypes, adds to the previously published genome sequence  <cit>  to provide a set of foundational resources that will partly overcome these limitations. p. brassicae shares many features previously reported for other biotrophic pathogens, namely a reduction in plant cell wall degrading enzymes, a loss of genes for uptake and assimilation of inorganic nitrogen and sulfate, and a loss of enzymes for thiamine biosynthesis and reduction of genes encoding for the production of toxins. these are common features identified in several biotrophic fungal and oomycete plant pathogens  <cit> . what distinguishes the p. brassicae genome is the small size and scarcity of repeats in comparison with most of other obligate biotrophs such as rust and powdery mildew fungi and the downy mildew oomycete hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis  <cit> . transposable and other repetitive elements are factors that contribute to genome expansion, evolution and possible diversification of effector genes in biotrophic fungi. another unique feature of the p. brassicae genome is the reduction  of intergenic distances. this resembles the reduction of intergenic intervals in microsporidia, another group of obligate intracellular parasites in which the reduction of gene space has forced promoters and terminators into adjacent genes and consequently the presence of mrnas that encode sequences from more than one gene  <cit> .

comparison of the snp profile of pb <dig> with four other canadian pathotypes showed a clear difference between pb <dig> and pb <dig> while the snp profile for pb <dig>  pb <dig> and pb <dig> were very similar. interestingly this snp-based grouping correlated with host specificity of these isolates. despite the marked difference between the genome wide snp profile of pb <dig> and pb <dig>  these two pathotypes were very similar with respect to genome structure and their effector profile.

as a biotrophic pathogen p. brassicae relies on host plant carbon sources for growth. among the pb <dig> predicted transporters were a monosaccharide, a sucrose and several major facilitator superfamily  transporters that transport different compounds including simple sugars. we identified a novel group of transporters among the predicted proteins of pb <dig> with substrate binding motifs only found in prokaryotic abc transporters  <cit> . seven proteins with these bacterial transporter motifs had  <dig> transmembrane sweet-taste receptor of  <dig> gcpr  joined with either a bacterial extracellular solute-binding protein  or a bacterial periplasmic-binding  domain. bacterial sbp motifs are essential for transmembrane transport irrespective of solute concentration, as they restrict substrate diffusion away from the cell and improve transporter affinity  <cit> . the evolutionary origin of these transporters remains to be established but they are likely to represent examples of horizontal gene transfer from prokaryotes to eukaryotes which, whilst relatively rare, has been documented in other protist genomes  <cit> . schwelm et al.  <cit>  also reported that a number of p. brassicae gh <dig> chitinases were closely related to bacterial chitinases which have not been reported in other eukaryotes before.

plant biotrophic pathogens are efficient in evading host recognition and suppressing plant defence through secretion of effector proteins. we identified  <dig> small secreted proteins among the predicted pb <dig> proteins of which 60 %  showed no homology to the ncbi nr database. twenty-eight ssps that were differentially expressed during infection consisted of proteins with chitin binding domains, proteinase activity and peptidase inhibitors. salicylic acid  is the main plant hormone for activating defence against biotroph pathogens. we identified a putative pb <dig> effector with homology to plant protein bsmt that function as sa methyl transferase. in planta bsmt generates mesa at the site of pathogen infection. mesa acts as a sar signal in distal leaves of infected plants. a bsmt from p. brassicae was recently reported by ludwig-müller and colleagues  <cit> . here we also showed the function of this gene in induction of sar and that it was differentially expressed during infection. one possible role for p. brassicae bsmt is to dampen the effect of sa in local tissue by converting it to mesa with the potential benefit of protecting above-ground parts of the plant from other pathogens, and thus sustaining the life of the host plant that is required for obligate biotrophic pathogens. sa mediated plant defence is mainly described for foliar plant pathogens and there is little information about involvement of the sa dependent defence pathway in roots. an example of the possible involvement of sa against root colonising pathogens is the induction of a sa marker gene encoding pathogenesis related protein  <dig>  in barley roots during challenge with bipolaris sorokiniana, a root pathogen of barley  <cit> . similarly in a recent paper lemarié et al.,  <cit>  reported that in arabidopsis plants with partial resistance to clubroot sa was induced. two b. napus orthologues of arabidopsis pr <dig>  were expressed in b. napus roots infected with pb <dig> but only one of these orthologues was differentially expressed. expression of this gene started at week  <dig> and then increased at weeks  <dig> and was significantly up-regulated at weeks  <dig> and  <dig> . this pattern of pr <dig> gene expression suggests the suppression of the sa pathway at earlier stages of infection, as was also supported by our hormonometer analysis.
