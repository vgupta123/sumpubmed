BACKGROUND
since the completion of its genome sequence in 1996
 <cit> , almost all newly developed high throughput techniques have been applied to saccharomyces cerevisiae.

due to its high relevance as a model organism, differences in gene expression under different growth conditions in the same strain have been determined, while a smaller number of analyses have compared different yeast strains
 or species
 <cit> . s. cerevisiae was also one of the first species in which transcriptome reconstruction using tiling arrays and rna-seq was evaluated
. these studies allowed both a detailed determination of the transcriptome structure and the identification of entirely new classes of non-coding rnas  such as the stable untranslated transcripts 
 <cit> , whose function remains largely unknown. although suts are pervasively transcribed, the majority of these ncrnas have yet to be assigned a role, and their global functional significance remains controversial
 <cit> . there are only a few exceptions of well-studied ncrna such as srg <dig>  a ncrna which is involved in the repression of ser <dig> transcription
 <cit> , and the ncrna in antisense to the ime <dig> gene that regulates entry into meiosis
 <cit> . in contrast, in other yeast species such as schizosaccharomyces pombe, a systematic program exists in which elevated antisense rnas arising from both ncrnas and overlapping convergent gene pairs determine a substantial reduction in protein levels throughout the genome
 <cit> . these findings suggest that antisense transcripts can have a relevant role in fungal genomes.

despite the high number of genomic studies, however, pivotal aspects of the transcriptome structure, such as its structural variability among different strains, have not been considered at all. the same is also true for the presence of non-coding transcripts in other species belonging to the saccharomyces genus. the reason for this bias in literature studies is that the gene expression analysis performed on the same strain under different growth conditions is technically affordable, while the comparison of gene expression between different strains is more difficult. this is due to the lack of microarray platforms for many s. cerevisiae strains and non-saccharomyces species. arrays designed on a reference strain can actually be used for transcriptome analysis on other strains , but this procedure can lead to biases in gene expression due to differences in the genomic sequences that can influence array hybridization.

although new high-throughput sequencing techniques are a promising approach to absolve the need for “strain-” and “species-specific” microarrays, difficulties in transcriptome assembly and the lack of reference genomes, required for reads alignment, limits comparative studies on transcriptome structure. in principle, directional rna-seq methods are more suitable than tiling arrays to deal with the complexity of the trascriptome, due to their single-nucleotide resolution, higher dynamic range and lower noise level
 <cit> . however, it has been demonstrated that in s. cerevisiae, tiling arrays are more precise for determining the transcriptome structure
 <cit> . this is at least partly due to difficulties in managing the highly non-uniform coverage of the rna-seq data that can produce gaps in the transcriptome assembly
 <cit> . moreover, comparative studies on transcriptome structure have been so far neglected, perhaps due to an underestimation of the transcript variability between different yeast species and strains. however, recent studies have identified more than  <dig>  rna-binding proteins  crosslinking sites in s. cerevisiae, of which a large number are localized in utr regions. since protein-rna interactions are integral components of nearly every aspect of biology, a more detailed knowledge of the utrs is needed. these results can help to better understand the role of this fundamental aspect of gene expression regulation and its variability in different s. cerevisiae strains and saccharomyces species.

in recent years, two main categories of transcriptome reconstruction software tools have been developed: the reference-based software, that rely on reads previously aligned on a reference genome, and the “de-novo” assemblers that analyze rna-seq reads without the need of a reference genome. reference-based software include, for example, cufflinks
 <cit>  and scripture
 <cit> , while trinity
 <cit> , oases
 <cit> , transabyss
 <cit> , rnnotator
 <cit>  and multiple-k
 <cit>  are de-novo assemblers.

many of these software were developed to manage the transcriptome of higher eukaryotes, which are characterized by a large number of introns that determine extensive alternative splicing. instead, with the exception of a software specifically developed for the identification of operons
 <cit> , transcriptome analysis of prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes rely only on programs developed for complex transcriptomes. these software cause an excessive fragmentation in transcriptome reconstruction which complicates further analysis. in contrast to higher eukaryotes, prokaryotes and some lower eukaryotes like s. cerevisiae are characterized by a low number of introns; a distinct characteristic that would require the use of specifically developed software. the presence of polycistronic transcripts must also be considered to obtain a reliable transcriptome reconstruction.

in order to fill this gap, a software named “ora”  was developed in this work. furthermore, this software can be used for transcriptome analysis in prokaryotes because it can also deal with polycistronic transcripts. this work also highlights some of the main problems of the next-generation sequencing methods that made the reconstruction of the transcripts complex. moreover, some computational solutions to improve software reliability were identified and integrated.

as a case study, the transcriptome of six yeast strains that have different origins was chosen. in this analysis, the laboratory strain s288c, a reference frequently used in gene expression studies, a commercial strain  used in winemaking
 <cit>  and four vineyard strains  whose genomes have been recently sequenced
 <cit>  were considered. these strains were selected for their remarkable differences in fermentation that allowed their assignment into three classes of fermentation efficiency: “high” , “intermediate”  and “low” . the availability of the sequences obtained by rna-seq in these six strains presented an interesting opportunity to test our transcriptome assembly software. it was also possible to investigate some poorly studied characteristics, including transcriptome structure variability in different strains and the genomic distribution of ncrnas with unknown functions such as the suts. these transcriptomes were analyzed in two different steps of the fermentation process: in mid-log phase and in early stationary phase. these two steps were named respectively “6 g/l” and “45 g/l” in relation to the amount of co <dig> produced during alcoholic fermentation. additionally, by comparing rna molecules transcribed from orthologous genes, ora allowed a global evaluation of utr regions variability that can potentially influence the phenotype of the yeast strains. the widespread transcription of the ncrnas localized in antisense to the protein-encoding genes was also confirmed in strains other than s288c and in three species of the saccharomyces sensu stricto group  that have accumulated approximately 5– <dig> million years of separate evolution
 <cit> . this comprehensive overview of the transcriptome structure provided an estimation of the conservation level of these ncrnas. finally, our analysis allowed a functional role for a group of ncrnas that are evolutionarily conserved among the sensu stricto group of yeasts to be proposed.

RESULTS
the transcriptome assembly software
ora is a reference-based assembler taking rna-seq reads aligned on a reference genome as input. the transcriptome assembly process is outlined in figure 
 <dig> and described in detail in the methods section. the main concept of the software is to join the overlapped reads aligned on the same strand to obtain “blocks” that, at best, encompass an entire transcript. here, the most common occurrence is to obtain transcripts composed by some “blocks” separated by very short gaps where the coverage is equal to zero, usually due to biases in the sequencing process and/or introns. since it is known that only 5% of s. cerevisiae genes have introns, in most cases these gaps are due to biases in the sequencing process
 <cit> . these sequencing biases were also pointed out in previous studies and can also be evidenced in the coverage profile by the presence of peaks localized in the corresponding genomic position which are separated by low-coverage regions. this suggests that some genomic regions are more prone to sequencing than others. on the other hand, in a low number of cases, the internal gene regions with no coverage can be determined by the presence of introns. however, true introns are identified by a specific part of the software that focuses on “spliced” reads identification . at the end of the assembly procedure, the program provides the predicted transcripts, their coverage, the position on the genome, the gene comprised in the transcribed region and the utrs sizes.figure  <dig>

data reported in this paper refer to different species of the saccharomyces genus, but ora can be used also in prokaryotes and in lower eukaryotes with a small number of introns. as an example the transcriptome structure of naumovia castellii
 <cit>  was analyzed and results are reported in additional file

comparison of the transcriptome reconstruction obtained using different methods
to determine the accuracy of ora in the transcriptome assembly, we compared the results obtained with two previously published analyses . the first
 <cit>  was performed using the 5’-race method that provides a reliable identification of the 5’-end of transcripts, while the second method
 <cit>  is based on tiling arrays. in the last procedure the transcripts identified were manually refined to improve the prediction. the results of these two transcriptome reconstructions have been previously compared
 <cit>  and it was demonstrated that 81% of the 5’-utr predictions differed in less than  <dig> bases . this threshold was used for comparing the results obtained in different experiments, which were considered reliable when differing in less than  <dig> bases. comparison of data obtained with 5’-race and ora revealed that 72% of the predictions  for the 6 g/l experiment are reliable . this percentage rose to 74%  when considering only the transcripts with a coverage higher than  <dig>  similar values were obtained for the experiment performed at 45 g/l .table  <dig>

it is noteworthy that the previous data were obtained from very similar growth conditions and were manually refined to improve the prediction. on the contrary, ora transcripts were determined in different growth conditions and were not manually refined. for this reason, the reliability of ora predictions in this case is underestimated and it could be expected that in the same growth condition the results would be much more reliable.

the comparison of data obtained with ora and those determined with tiling arrays revealed that 71% of the predictions  have a difference equal to or lower than  <dig> bases in the experiment performed at 6 g/l, a value that rises to 73%  when considering only the transcripts with coverage higher than  <dig>  similar values were obtained in the experiment performed at 45 g/l. lower percentages  were obtained when considering the 3’-end of transcripts. the underestimation of the transcripts sizes is due to the loss of the reads overlapped to the polyadenylation site that were removed by the analysis software of the sequencer  .

another comparison was performed between ora and cufflinks
 <cit>  on the same dataset . the predictions obtained for s288c were compared and the two software assembled a similar number of transcripts:  <dig> from ora and  <dig> from cufflinks. using again the results obtained with tiling arrays as a reference
 <cit>  and 50 bp difference as a threshold it was found that ora predicted 13% more reliable transcripts than cufflinks . using the results obtained with 5’-race experiment
 <cit>  as a reference, ora predicted about 11% more reliable transcripts than cufflinks .

the main discrepancy with race is due to an overestimation of the 5’-utr size obtained using cufflinks , probably caused by the very low coverage regions localized at the ends of the transcripts. the same underestimation at the 3’-end seen with ora was highlighted by cufflink. in fact the low percentage of reliable transcripts  is again due to the “loss of sequences” at the 3’-end in the solid sequencing. this result confirms the sequencing method as the principal cause.figure  <dig>

finally, a manual check of specific transcripts was performed to ensure maximum accuracy of the results, as small inconsistencies were observed in the reconstruction process. to simplify this process, a custom perl script was developed to visualize the coverage of the six strains analyzed in a graph .figure  <dig>

analysis of the utr regions in six s. cerevisiaestrains
based on the reliable ora transcriptome structure prediction, the structure of the 5’-utrs of six s. cerevisiae strains  was investigated . strong phenotypic differences between these strains were found in a previous study, with the most relevant being those involved in determining the alcoholic fermentation performance
 <cit> . moreover, the phenotypic characters of these strains have been correlated to their gene expression profiles
 <cit> .

in order to maximize the reliability of the prediction, this analysis focused on the transcripts with a coverage higher than  <dig>  , which amounted to  <dig> in the experiment at 6 g/l and  <dig> at 45 g/l. ora identified between 13% to 20% of the transcripts with variable utrs at 6 g/l , and between 17% to 28% at 45 g/l. transcripts with variable utrs were considered those that differed by  <dig> bases or more. the highest number of variable transcripts was found when comparing s288c with the other strains at 45 g/l. this is due to the greater diversity of this laboratory strain compared to the others that are much more similar at a genomic level
 <cit> . considering the six strains and the two growth conditions in this work,  <dig> pairwise comparisons were analyzed. in order to verify if specific functional classes of genes tend to have differences in the transcript structure between strains we performed a gene ontology  analysis. we considered three group of genes: those with a 5’-utr highly conserved between different strains , genes with variable 5’-utrs  in at least one comparison between strains  and genes with their 5’-utr varying  in 6– <dig> comparisons . no genes varied in more than  <dig> comparisons in a specific growth condition.

the results highlighted some go functional classes significantly enriched in genes with highly conserved 5’-utrs and others enriched in genes with variable 5’-utrs. three go categories are noteworthy for their possible impact on the metabolic processes related to alcoholic fermentation . the most relevant results are the presence of  <dig> genes with variable 5’-utrs found at 6 g/l classified in the “sulfur compound metabolic process” category,  <dig> genes found in the “amino acid catabolic process to alcohol via ehrlich pathway” category, and  <dig> genes involved in sterol metabolic process . the first finding is of particular interest because genes involved in the “sulfur compound metabolic process” are important for the oxidative stress response and resistance to sulfur dioxide in yeast. in fact, so <dig> is a preservative compound widely used in foods and beverages and is toxic at high concentrations
 <cit> . genes involved in so <dig> detoxification  were previously shown to be induced after exposure of yeast cells to this compound
 <cit> . the ehrlich pathway instead is involved in the production of long chain and complex alcohols, representing one of the main classes of fermentation flavors in wine
 <cit> . the third very important class of genes interestingly includes both genes with highly conserved 5’-utrs and also with variable 5’-utrs . concordantly, a high variability in the expression level of genes involved in the biosynthesis of sterols in different yeast strains has been previously reported
 <cit> . it is known that incorporation of sterols into membranes counteracts the stress induced by the high ethanol concentrations that accumulate during alcoholic fermentation

it is still difficult to identify a causal relationship between variations in the transcript structure, its expression and the final phenotypic effect. however, the variability of the transcript structure of genes belonging to specific functional classes suggests that this relationship may actually exist.

a manual inspection was carried out on the most interesting genes .

one of these is aro <dig>  a gene involved in the first step of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis
 <cit> . the 5’-utr region is longer in the oenological strains with a size between  <dig> and  <dig> bases, compared to s288c where it is only  <dig> bases long. in the terminal part of this transcript at 56– <dig> bases from the 5’-end a binding site for a rbp was identified by gpar-clip
 <cit> . from ora’s prediction it could be concluded that this binding site is absent in s288c since this strain lacks the terminal part of the transcript. despite in enological strains the 5’-utr region of aro <dig> is longer, it does not overlap the predicted tata box .

finally, analysis of the rbps was extended to all the binding sites previously identified
 <cit>   and aro <dig> resulted not to be an exception. in fact, among the  <dig> biding sites identified in the 5’-utr region of  <dig> genes,  <dig> are absent in one or more strains at 6 g/l, while  <dig> are absent in transcripts identified at 45 g/l. accordingly, it is possible that differences in the 5’-utr region of the transcripts could represent a major source of variability among s. cerevisiae strains. more generally, this feature, hitherto neglected, could play a relevant role also among strains of other species, with an impact on the stability of the transcripts and on the expression level.

non-coding transcripts  in s. cerevisiaeand in other yeast species
as shown in previous studies
 <cit> , the yeast transcriptome includes numerous ncrnas localized in intergenic regions or in antisense to protein-encoding genes
 <cit> . a high strand-specificity of the reads obtained from sequencing is important for the identification of sauts. this specificity was evaluated by determining the frequency of the saut identified in antisense to genes with different coverage values . from the results obtained, the number of sauts was higher in genes with low expression suggesting that they are not influenced by reads lacking strand-specificity. their expression level determined by ora is on average lower than expression of protein-encoding genes  and of structural rnas of known function . the low expression level  and lack of a functional role for most suts have cast doubt upon their global functional significance
 <cit>  and suggest that some suts could be the result of a “transcriptional background”. in order to clarify their putative role and their effect on transcription, we classified suts by considering their localization with respect to other genes. those found in intergenic regions were named as sut  and those located in antisense to protein-encoding genes as saut . sauts are the more interesting for their putative effect on the transcription and translation of the gene located on the antisense strand
 <cit> . an examination of the putative effect of sauts on gene expression in the opposite strand  did not reveal a common mechanism. in fact, depending on the gene, increased expression of a saut corresponded to either decreased or increased expression of the antisense gene, and sometimes had no effect at all. this finding suggests that only a fraction of the sauts identified have a functional role and they do not have a common mechanism of action.figure  <dig> 
coverage  and length  of six classes of transcripts identified by ora in the s288c strain at 6 g/l. from left to right are reported: transcripts encoding proteins , non-coding transcripts localized in antisense to other genes  , non-coding transcripts localized in intergenic regions , trnas, other non-coding rnas  and ncrnas localized in intronic regions. the number of transcripts identified for each class in the s288c strain at 6 g/l is shown in .



to have a better understanding of the possible role of these transcripts and their conservation level in different strains, we verified the presence of sauts on the antisense strand of the orthologous genes of the six yeast strains analyzed. if an orthologous gene had a saut in the antisense region in all the six strains tested, the saut was considered to be conserved. despite the number of sauts in the genomes being quite high , only  <dig> of them are conserved in all of the strains at 6 g/l and  <dig> at 45 g/l. considering only the conserved sauts, we focused our attention on those with a potential role in the cell, while omitting “strain specific” ones and those representing a sort of “transcriptional background”.

go analysis of the protein-encoding genes present in the antisense strand of conserved sauts was performed. only a small number of biological processes were identified and two of them seem to be particularly affected by the presence of conserved sauts: transmembrane transport and fungal-type cell wall organization .

in order to widen the analysis at a higher taxonomic level, the existence of conserved sauts was evaluated in three species of the saccharomyces sensu-stricto group recently sequenced: saccharomyces paradoxus, saccharomyces bayanus and saccharomyces mikatae
 <cit> . high throughput sequencing data obtained for these three species and also for a diploid s. cerevisiae strain were used
 <cit> . their transcriptome structure was predicted with ora and sauts were identified. like for the previous analysis performed on the six s. cerevisiae strains, only genes with a saut in the antisense strand in all the four species were considered. only two genes  had sauts in all the four species. however, this number rises to  <dig>  when considering the results previously obtained for s288c in a gene expression study
 <cit> . this discrepancy can be explained by the fact that the s288c strain analyzed by busby and colleagues
 <cit>  is diploid, while the strain considered by treu and colleagues
 <cit>  is haploid. it is known that the expression of the antisense transcripts  of some s. cerevisiae genes  decreases in the diploid strain to allow the expression of the protein-encoding gene on the opposite strand
 <cit> . ime <dig> encodes a n6-adenosine methyltransferase required for entry into meiosis that has high expression levels in diploid cells . in haploids, antisense transcription prevents sense transcription of the ime <dig> gene by means of transcription interference. in this process, a strong constitutive transcription of the ime <dig> antisense interferes with transcription of the sense rna. other genes with a lower expression in the haploid strain were previously identified
 <cit>  and some of these are involved in the biosynthesis of the cell wall like dse <dig> , a daughter cell-specific secreted protein with similarity to glucanases. considering normalized values obtained for the s288c haploid and diploid strains, it was found that sauts in antisense to the genes dse <dig> and ime <dig> are more highly expressed in the haploid strain. they are also inversely related to the expression level of the protein encoding transcript . this finding suggests, therefore, that not only ime <dig> but also dse <dig> is regulated by an antisense transcript.table  <dig>

protein-encoding genes with a saut in the antisense strand in all the species of the saccharomyces genus analyzed .
coverage profiles on forward and reverse strands for six selected genes. genes reported in figure belong to the go categories “reproductive process in single-celled organism” , “sporulation resulting in formation of a cellular spore”  and “fungal-type cell wall” . sauts conserved in all the saccharomyces species analyzed  were found in all the genes except ime <dig> and dse <dig>  an inverse correlation in gene expression between the protein-encoding transcript and the saut is highlighted by red/green arrows and was previously demonstrated for ime <dig> <cit> .



of the  <dig> genes identified by the comparison performed among the sensu-stricto yeast species, it was found that sma <dig>  and spo <dig>  encode meiosis-specific proteins . the protein encoded by sma <dig> is required to produce the bending force necessary for the proper assembly of the prospore membrane during sporulation
 <cit> , while spo <dig> is required for spore wall formation during sporulation
 <cit> . prm <dig> gene is a pheromone-regulated multispanning membrane protein involved in membrane fusion during mating
 <cit> . among the  <dig> genes there is also rrt <dig>  a subtilisin-family protease involved in spore wall formation
 <cit> , with a role in dityrosine layer formation. other previous experiments confirmed that the expression of some proteins involved in biosynthesis of the spore wall is lower in diploids than in haploid cells
 <cit> . the regulation of spore wall biosynthesis by the presence of sauts is a major finding and underlines the importance of coordinating the dynamic remodeling of the yeast wall with cell morphogenetic events.

these  <dig> genes  belong to the go class “reproductive process in single-celled organism” that is enriched in genes with an antisense transcript. it is clear that not all of these genes have a common mechanism for regulating the expression level of the protein-encoding gene  . nevertheless, the high conservation level of sauts in different yeast species suggests a functional role for these transcripts in the control of protein expression. in particular, entry into meiosis is a key developmental decision and antisense ncrnas seem to play a relevant role in various steps of this process. these data revealed here for the first time a general role for a group of sauts both in s. cerevisiae and probably in other species belonging to the sensu-stricto group of yeasts.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, a software for the analysis of transcriptional landscapes of lower eukaryotes and prokaryotes was specifically developed. this software, named ora, proved to perform very well when compared with other software and produced results comparable to those obtained via reliable methods such as 5’-race. ora proved to be a very useful tool for the identification of 5’- and 3’-utrs starting from rna-seq reads. in this study the variability of the transcriptome structure of different s. cerevisiae strains was highlighted. furthermore, it was discovered that this variability can influence the binding sites of the rbps in regions localized at the 5’-utr. this finding indicates that differences in utrs can change the stability and the translation efficiency of the transcripts in different strains. finally, we have demonstrated that ora allows the identification of “criptic” transcripts such as sauts. in conclusion, this new software is able to simplify comparative analyses between strains and species and, in some cases, the results can be used to suggest a functional role for unknown transcripts.
