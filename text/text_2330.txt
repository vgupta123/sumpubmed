BACKGROUND
fish-borne clonorchiasis, caused by the oriental liver fluke clonorchis sinensis, is endemic in many asian countries and over  <dig> million people globally are infected with c. sinensis, including an estimated  <dig> million in china  <cit> . the parasite has major socioeconomic impacts in other parts of asia as well. in korea, infection in humans is one of the most prevalent  <cit> . while in vietnam, the prevalence reaches 79% in the haiphong and hanoi area  <cit> . this infection is also becoming increasingly common in non-endemic regions and in developed countries due to growing international markets, improved transportation systems, and demographic changes such as population movements  <cit> . epidemiological data suggested that clonorchiasis has an increasing human-health impact resulted from the greater consumption of raw, frozen, dried, or pickled freshwater fish imported from endemic areas  <cit> .

adult c. sinensis flukes reside chronically in the biliary tract and cause periductal inflammation, fibrosis, pyogenic cholangitis, biliary calculi, cholecystitis, liver cirrhosis and pancreatitis  <cit> . like opistorchis viverrini, c. sinensis is classified as carcinogenic to humans by the international agency for research on cancer for cholangiocarcinoma in  <dig>  <cit> . the disease arises from metaplastic changes of biliary epithelial cells and usually occurs in the secondary intrahepatic bile duct, where the fluke is preferentially situated. however, the exact mechanisms of the carcinogenesis are not clearly elucidated  <cit> .

the prevention and control strategies for this parasite include fecal examination and treatment of individual patients with praziquantel. the world health organization has also recommended mass chemotherapy in humans in endemic areas as the most practical and immediately effective control strategy  <cit> . other efforts to control the parasite include interrupting transmission at the intermediate host level. however, there has been little effect on the impact of snail populations  or on the practice of eating raw fish  <cit> .

micrornas  are 18- <dig> nucleotide, non-coding, small rna molecules found in diverse organisms from viruses  <cit> , plants  <cit> , flies  <cit>  to mammals  <cit> , which regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. they are essential for the complex life cycle of pathogenic parasites for their ability to respond to environmental and developmental signals and are now considered as a key mechanism of gene regulation  <cit> . the discovery of mirna function sheds new light on the control of these parasites. however, there was no mirnas being identified experimentally in c. sinensis.

in light of the probability that mirna species are involved in gene regulation in c. sinensis, here we investigated the expression profile of mirnas and detected potential novel mirnas in c. sinensis adults. due to the similarity in morphology, life cycle and modes of transmission among members of the opisthorchiidae  <cit> , mirna profile research in c. sinensis will shed light on the mirna studies of other species such as o. felineus and o. viverrini.

RESULTS
profile characteristics of short rnas from c. sinensis
deep sequencing yielded  <dig>  million reads , and the raw sequencing data was deposited in geo of ncbi http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ with accession number gse <dig>  after 5' and 3' adaptors, contamination formed by adaptor-adaptor ligation and low quality tags were removed, a total of  <dig>  million reads with high quality were obtained. length distribution analysis showed that most reads were distributed among 20- <dig> nt. the highest percentage was  <dig> % with reads of  <dig> nt long, followed by  <dig> % of  <dig> nt reads . in the next analysis step, reads smaller than  <dig> nt  were removed, and a total of  <dig>  million clean reads remained with  <dig>  million  unique sequences. among the  <dig>  million clean reads, a total of  <dig>  million  were perfectly mapped to the schistosoma japonicum genome, including  <dig>   unique sequences; and  <dig> % of these have only one location on the genome.

among the  <dig>  million reads,  <dig> , <dig>  were ncrnas, including rrna, trna, snrna and snorna. repeat-associated small rnas  coming from high-repeat regions of genome or transposon-regions were found to belong to the two types of repeat: line/rte: <dig> and line/rte: <dig>  the percentage of known mirnas was  <dig> % with  <dig> , <dig> reads which includes  <dig>  unique sequences . except for the mirna, rrna and repeats mentioned above,  <dig> , <dig>  sequences  had no match and were marked as un-annotated .

identification of mirna* and  <dig> novel mirnas
a total of  <dig>  un-annotated unique reads  that can match elements of the s. japonicum genome were marked as potential novel mirna candidates. the secondary structure of the inverted repeat predicted by mfold and evaluated by mircheck showed that  <dig> conserved reads were found . many mirnas were found in multiple locations of the s. japonicum genome, for example, a novel mirna named cis-mir- <dig>  corresponds to  <dig> different locations on different chains of the genome . although we found the homologs of known mirna* of other organisms, we did not obtain any mirna* sequences of this  <dig> novel mirnas in the c. sinensis data set. the sequences and locations of the  <dig> predicted novel reads are shown in table  <dig> and the predicted stem-loop structures for their mirna precursors are shown in figure  <dig>

most mirna* homologs had only one copy in the c. sinensis dataset and the most abundant unique reads was homologs of gga-mir-1627* with only  <dig> counts . although there were abundant mirna* sequences in caenorhabditis elegans and other organisms in sanger mirbase  <cit>  , all these mirna* homologs belonged to different kinds of organisms including vertebrates, insects, virus and some coelomates, such as amphimedon queenslandica, schmidtea mediterranea, locusta migratoria, xenopus tropicalis, mus musculus and gallus gallus, with the exception of parasites and nematodes including schistosoma mansoni, s. japonicum, c. elegans, c. briggsae and all kinds of mosquitoes including anopheles gambiae, aedes aegypti and culex quinquefasciatus, which were deposited in the database . it was reported that though the mirna: mirna* duplex were complementary, their base-pairing was imperfect and mirna* was less stable than the mature mirna  <cit> . the phenomenon above might indicate a fast degradation mature mechanism of mirna* in parasites, at least in c. sinensis.

the phylogenetic evolution of mirnas
some families included many members and showed distribution bias in the c. sinensis dataset. totally,  <dig> conserved mirnas families were found in c. sinensis out of  <dig> , <dig> reads . these conserved families were presented in large category of vertebrates, insects and nematodes, and can be sorted into  <dig> groups based on their phylogenetic distribution. fifty conserved mirna families are showed in figure 3a as examples. four families were found to present among vertebrates, insects and nematodes, including let- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir-124; some families were present in vertebrates and insects, but no nematodes; some were restricted respectively to vertebrates, insects, and invertebrates ; while some were nematode-specific. this phenomenon showed that c. sinensis mirnas were distributed widely, some of which specifically belonged to other animals and there might be a redundant mirna expression in c. siensis. it was reported that there were  <dig> conserved families and  <dig> potential locust-specific mirna families in locust, and these families can only be divided into  <dig> groups  <cit> . it was also reported that  <dig> mirnas belonged to  <dig> mirna families in s. japonicum  <cit> , but no detailed information about mirna families' distribution was reported. considering the complex parasitic life of c. sinensis and the key regulation function of mirnas, possessing mirnas of different kinds of animals would be a perfect strategy for its parasitic life, which could help them to adapt and modify the host and parasitic environments quickly and conveniently. on the other hand, for a large number and kinds of mirna expressed, nucleotides of mirna* need to be reused quickly, and this might be the reason why there were so little mirna* sequences found in this kind of parasite. it is known that c. sinensis is parasitic in animal hosts such as snails, cats, dogs, fishes, mice and human beings. however, due to the widely distribution of its mirna families, we believe that this parasite can easily enlarge its host range when the parasitic situation is convenient.

categorization of conserved mirnas indicated that mirnas of c. sinensis were still in the process of evolution. some of the mirnas belonged to ancient families, such as mir- <dig> and mir-34; while some others appeared to be much younger, such as c. sinensis specific mirnas. the innovation was concentrated along three branches of the phylogenetic tree leading to bilaterians, insects and coelomates. age differences indicated that there was an ongoing process of mirna evolution and the birth and death of a kind of mirna family was a common phenomenon  <cit> .

there might be two innovation approaches of mirna in c. sinensis, including evolution in the middle and tail. we randomly elected  <dig> conserved families, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  and analyzed all of the members of each in mirbase. mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> belonged to vertebrates, insects and nematodes, while mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were present in invertebrates only . if a mirna family of c. sinensis had more than one of its members, we chose the most abundant  <dig> or  <dig> ones, for they were the main part of the family. phylogenetic analysis of mir- <dig> family showed that the cis-mir- <dig> can be easily found for its substitutions and insertions in the middle of mirna, just behind the "seed region" ; in contrast, the cis-mir- <dig> was conserved in the middle, and mosquitoes  and some other insects including b. mori and d. melanogaster innovated at the position. however, it can be found that cis-mir- <dig> evolved from the tail . different members of the cis-mir family showed different innovation rate indicated by phylogenetic trees . the same phenomenon can also be found in families of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> . it was found that the seed regions of all the species were conserved, while one nucleotide right behind the seed region was changed from u to g and another one was deleted in cis-mir- <dig> of mir- <dig> family. in mir- <dig>  one nucleotide was changed from u to c in the middle which was the same as sja-mir- <dig> , and another one was changed from u to a which was the same as bma-mir- <dig> . we supposed that there might be a kind of site-directed evolution and mutagenesis for parasitic life in parasites, however, more mirna information of other kinds of parasites are needed, which are absent in public databases at present.

strong family member bias of mirnas in c. sinensis
almost one third of the reads belonged to mir- <dig> family with a total percentage of  <dig> %, which included mir- <dig> , mir-71a , mir-71b  and mir-71c . it was followed by the family mir- <dig> with most of the reads focusing on mir-2b. this bias phenomenon has also been found in other families, such as mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  except for mir- <dig> which was common in different kinds of animals, mirnas including mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> all belonged to invertebrates .

some families included more members than others. let- <dig> was the second mirna found in nematode c. elegans in  <dig>  <cit>  and it was found that the let- <dig> family was the largest one among the conserved mirnas of c. sinensis, including  <dig> members from let-7a to let-7j and star sequences such as let-7b* and let-7g*. the mir- <dig> family was the second largest family represented in the current dataset, which included  <dig> members. the reads in these families showed strong bias. for example,  <dig> % of the reads focused on let- <dig> in the let- <dig> family.

expression predominance of some mirnas in c. sinensis
some kinds of mirnas were expressed with high predominance. mir- <dig> had the most abundant reads accounting for  <dig> %  of the total reads. it was followed by mir-277b with a percentage of  <dig> % . the third most abundant mirna is mir-71c with a percentage of  <dig> % . the mirna named lin- <dig>  which was firstly found in the nematode c. elegans in  <dig>  <cit> , was also found in c. sinensis . some other mirnas were not found in c. sinensis, including mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> 

there were  <dig> kinds of mirna with copy numbers  fewer than  <dig> , and  <dig> kinds of them with only  <dig> copy. seventy-eight kinds of mirnas had reads of between  <dig>  and  <dig>   <dig>  while there were only  <dig> kinds of mirna with copy numbers between  <dig>  and  <dig> . when the copy numbers were higher than  <dig> , only  <dig> kinds of mirna were represented . this expression predominance phenomenon was also found in the  <dig> novel mirnas. for example, there were  <dig> copies of cis-mir- <dig>  while only  <dig> copies of cis-mir- <dig> and cis-mir- <dig> were found, respectively .

nucleotides bias of mirnas in c. sinensis
the first nucleotide bias analysis of the  <dig> , <dig> reads revealed that nucleotide uracil  was the most frequently used first nucleotide in mirnas of c. sinensis , while g or c was seldom used as the first nucleotide with only  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively .  was found most abundantly with a percentage of  <dig> % on average, reaching a percentage of  <dig> % and  <dig> % at the  <dig> and  <dig> nt positions, respectively .

nucleotide bias analysis at each position showed that a and u mainly appeared at the beginnings and the ends of reads, while c and g occupied a very high percentage at the second position and the positions of 6-9th, which belonged to the "seed region" in other species  <cit> . particularly at the beginning of seed region, the g+c content reached as high as  <dig> % . for a broad range of mirna families which were presented in c. sinensis , the seed regions of them might tend to be conserved. this speculation can be proven by the phylogenetic analysis of the two families of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> . although there were innovations to the families of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in c. sinensis, nucleotide change only happened in the middle and the end. considering the complex life history of the parasite, keeping steady seed region and flexible in other places of mirna might be another strategy for the parasite to adapt to different parasitic situations in different tissues of different hosts.

the analysis showed that u had a high frequency in the 1st, 14th and 22nd positions with percentages of  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively, while it seldom appeared at the 2nd and 24th positions with percentages of  <dig> % and  <dig> %.  was distributed mainly in the front of reads, at the first and 3-5th nucleotides  but less at the second position . c had the lowest percentage  at 15th position. g showed high percentage incidence at the positions of almost every  <dig> nucleotides, such as 6th, 12th and 18th with  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, and it seldom appeared at the end positions, such as the 22nd position . the highest percentage of  was located at the second position with  <dig> %, and it also predominated at the positions of 6-9th and 16-18th. the phenomenon that most a and u were distributed in the front of reads with g and c being focused on the 6- <dig> positions might be concerned with the mechanisms of mirna action, such as binding with the targets for gene regulation.

quantification of c. sinensis mirna expression
using the modified stem-loop rt-pcr, the relative expression levels of the six novel mirnas relative to the actin gene were calculated . among them, cis-mir- <dig> showed a high expression level while that of cis-mir- <dig> and cis-mir- <dig> were very low.

discussion
mirnas are now considered as key regulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and perform a variety of significant functions within cells such as regulation of growth, metabolism, development and cell differentiation  <cit> . due to the complex life cycle of parasites with several developmental stages in vertebrate and invertebrate hosts, it is particularly important to elucidate the roles of mirnas in the growth and development of parasites and their abilities to regulate infection of mammalian hosts. mirnas are involved not only in the normal functioning of eukaryotic cells, but also associated with dysregulation during disease. mirnas can be used as potential new tools for disease diagnostics and gene therapy  <cit>  and a manually curated database  is publicly available aiming at documenting known relationships between mirna dysregulation and human disease  <cit> .

mirnas in c. sinensis of zoonotic significance were identified and characterized by deep sequencing in the present study. we found that the percentage of reads matching the s. japonicum genome was very low  and only  <dig>  unique reads out of  <dig> , <dig> were perfectly matched, whereas this figure can be as high as  <dig> % or higher in some other species  <cit> . the most likely reason for this phenomenon might be that the reference genome used for matching analysis was the s. japonicum genome, rather than c. sinensis, for the c. sinensis genome  was not available at present. although c. sinensis and s. japonicum belong to a common phylogenetic group , there are some significant differences between them, and some mirnas appeared to be species-specific  <cit> .

the distinguishing characteristic of mirnas from other endogenous small rnas is that mirna precursors have the inverted repeat sequence that can form hairpin structures  <cit> . six novel mirnas were predicted from  <dig>  un-annotated genome-matched unique reads. we cannot exclude the possibility that there might be more mirna types in c. sinensis adults.

amongst the conserved mirnas of c. sinensis, bias was found within both kinds of families and family members. the mir- <dig> and its families possessed the highest proportion of total reads, and the mir- <dig> family was conserved in s. mansoni, s. japonicum, ixodes scapularis, and anopheles gambiae being indexed by sanger mirbase, which indicated that mir- <dig> is essential for the life of this flatworm. like mir- <dig>  some mirnas had particularly high copies in c. sinensis, including mir-277b, mir-71c and mir- <dig>  considering the living environment of the adult parasites in the biliary tract of the hosts, as well as the normal function of mirnas, we inferred that these families might be mainly involved in metabolism of the worm.

nucleotides a and u were distributed mainly in the front of reads including the first and the 3-5th nucleotides with the exception of the second position . u was the dominant nucleotide in mature mirnas, especially in the first nucleotide position, and it showed a high frequency in the 1st, 14th and 22nd position, almost at the beginning, the middle, and the end of reads. it was reported by zhang et al.  that the 1st, 9th and the terminal positions were enriched with u and the 1st and 9th positions were the limits of the "seed region" of a mirna, which was responsible for targeting mrnas for gene regulation  <cit> . we showed a similar result in c. sinensis mirnas at the first and the end positions, but there was only  <dig> % on average at the ninth position, while it was  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively at the 11th and the 14th positions. at the positions of 6-9th, g or c occupied a high percentage. because the previously analyzed mirnas were mainly derived from vertebrates including human, rat, mouse and pig, and only a few parasites were involved, we cannot exclude the possibility of species- or even order-specific differences and there might be a different or shifted "seed region" for mirnas in c. sinensis compared with other species  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the present study represented the first large scale characterization of c. sinensis mirnas, which will help us understand the complex life cycle of this zoonotic parasite, which in turn may have implications for the development of novel approaches for the effective control of this parasite. these results will also assist the mirna studies of other related species such as opisthorchis felineus and o. viverrini of human and animal health significance.
