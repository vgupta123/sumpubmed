BACKGROUND
for decades, respiratory tract diseases in pigs have led to high economic losses in pig producing countries. acute disease outbreaks can often be immediately diagnosed based on the detection of clinical signs by farmers and veterinarians, while chronic and subclinical respiratory disorders are difficult to diagnose. in cases with chronic disease, gross pathology at abattoir slaughter provides the only indication of disease presence. in contrast to many diagnostic methods available for detecting bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens in samples of living pigs, methods to diagnose the extent of lung lesions in chronically diseased animals, usually showing no clinical signs, are very limited  <cit> .

actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae , the causative agent of pleuropneumonia in pigs is one of the most important bacterial lung pathogens in swine and is commonly used as a standard model for respiratory disease  <cit>  and was therefore chosen for this study. app is considered both, as a primary and secondary pathogen. in combination with other viral and bacterial pathogens it belongs to the “porcine respiratory disease complex“, representing a typical health problem in pigs  <cit> . co-infection with mycoplasma hyopneumoniae can lead to respiratory diseases with high morbidity and mortality  <cit> .

during the peracute form of disease due to app, sudden death is often the sole finding without premonitory signs, while acute disease is characterised by fever, lethargy, cyanosis, frothy nasal discharge, dyspnea and coughing. acute signs dissipate during the chronic stage of the disease which is associated with intermittent coughing, reduced growth and feed conversion efficiency  <cit> . often, subclinically and chronically infected animals do not show any clinical symptoms. as app is commonly endemic in pig populations, antibody detection by serological tests does not enable discrimination between subclinical infection and disease  <cit> .

typical lung alterations during the acute phase of an app infection are necrotising and fibrohaemorrhagic pneumonia associated with pleurisy  <cit> . fibrous adhesions between the parietal and visceral pleura and consolidations in the form of abscess-like nodular lesions encapsulated by connective tissue are a characteristic gross pathological finding in the chronic stage of the disease  <cit> . a tentative diagnosis of app presence can be made on the basis of the clinical signs  <cit> , and gross pathology is considered characteristic but not pathognomonic  <cit> . thus, only organism detection from affected lung tissue by bacteriology or pcr provides a definitive diagnosis  <cit> .

new prophylactical and therapeutic approaches for respiratory diseases in pigs are crucial. standardised animal challenge models including sequential examinations after experimental challenge are the current method of choice for clinical studies to evaluate such new approaches. however, these animal experiments require a large number of test animals, because necropsy has to be carried out successively at different time points.

the aim of the present study was to detect gross pathological lung lesions in living animals by computed tomography . the diagnostic potential and limitation of this imaging method was analysed in comparison to digital radiography. sequential euthanasia and necropsy of test animals during the course of this study were replaced by ct examinations. a ct scoring system for disease classification was developed, allowing for quantification of pneumonic lung alterations. ct findings during the course of the app infection were compared to findings from clinical, serological and radiological examinations. at the end of the study on day  <dig>  ct findings were also compared to findings from gross pathology and histological examinations. ultimately, the ct methodology is expected to reduce the number of test animals in scientific studies since sequential euthanasia becomes dispensable.

RESULTS
clinical examination
after challenge, the animals showed variable disease severity. on day  <dig> the clinical score ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and on day  <dig> from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . there were five animals on day  <dig> and three animals on day  <dig> free of clinical signs. mild symptoms were observed in three animals on day  <dig> and in  <dig> animals on day  <dig>  two animals showed typical symptoms of app infection with a rise in body temperature up to  <dig> °c, apathy, dyspnoea and anorexia on both examination days. two animals  were euthanized on days  <dig> and  <dig> post-challenge, respectively, due to generalised severe disease signs, including severe dyspnea. nevertheless, they underwent ct and radiographic examination prior to gross pathological examination. findings from those two animals were included in the day  <dig> analyses. no signs of respiratory disease were detected in the control group.

ct investigation
ct scores developed in this study ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  on day  <dig> and from  <dig> to  <dig>  on day  <dig> in the challenge group . following the ct examination on day  <dig>  six animals in the challenge group showed no pathological changes, while the other challenged animals showed ground-glass opacities or consolidations of varying degrees. at day  <dig>  one of the  <dig> control pigs was classified as slightly affected .

on day  <dig>  consolidations and ground glass opacities were observed in  <dig> animals in the challenge group and also in  <dig> pigs in the control group . on days  <dig> and  <dig>  19% and 13% of the pathological changes were in the area of the apical lobes, respectively, 38% and 42% in the area of the cardiac lobe and 43% and 45% in the area of the diaphragmatic lobes, respectively.

in general, ground-glass opacities were recorded by transverse sections as hazy, diffuse and non-homogeneous areas of increased lung tissue density due to decreased aeration and characterised by distinct outlines of the bronchial tree and vasculature. in contrast, consolidations were focal, homogeneous areas, with defined margins and an increase in lung density. the underlying blood vessels and airway walls were obscured.the average density values  of the consolidations were in the positive range of the hounsfield scale on both examination days after challenge.

gross pathology and bacteriology
lung lesion scores ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . the highest lung lesion score in an animal surviving until day  <dig> was  <dig> . at necropsy, eight challenged animals and two animals from the control group lacked any gross pathological changes . six animals from the challenge group and  <dig> animals from the control group were classified as slightly affected . one animal in the control group classified as moderately affected had lung tissue consolidation within the right apical lobe that was considered atypical of app infection, on the basis of histological and bacteriological findings  and negative for app. a slight interstitial pneumonia was examined in all control animals by histological examination.

29% of gross lung lesions were located in the apical, 24% in the cardiac and 47% in the diaphragmatic lobes. the cut surfaces of the multiple, dark red and demarcated consolidated foci were coloured grey-red to off-white . in addition, in  <dig> pigs from the challenge group, fibrinous pleurisy and adhesions were detected. many pigs showed abscess-like nodules encapsulated in connective tissue. one of the two pigs euthanized before day  <dig> showed excessive serosanguinous fluid in the thoracic cavity. in both pigs euthanized before day  <dig>  approximately 50% of lung tissue was affected. in the remaining animals the proportion of grossly affected lung tissue ranged from  <dig> % to 50% of the total lung tissue.

the recovery of app from lung tissue by bacteriological examination and confirmatory pcr was successful in both animals euthanized prior to day  <dig> after challenge and in  <dig> of the remaining  <dig> challenged animals  at day  <dig>  the  <dig> bacteriologically negative pigs in the challenge group all had no gross lesions of app and all were classified as unaffected by ct score .

bacteriological examination of lung tissue of control animals resulted in the detection of bordetella bronchiseptica, e. coli and alpha-haemolytic streptococci, while app was not isolated.

correlation of scores
on days  <dig> and  <dig>  clinical scores significantly correlated with scores of both imaging techniques. on both days, radiographic scores positively correlated with computed tomography scores . on day  <dig>  the lung lesion scores were found to positively correlate with clinical scores, radiographic scores and with computed tomography scores. the spearman’s rank correlation coefficient of the lung lesion scores with the ct scores  was higher compared to the radiographic scores . in order to translate the ct scores to four respiratory disease classes , boundary values of the four ct score classes were chosen to achieve maximum concordance with the lung lesion score disease classes . an agreement in the assessment of disease severity with both methods was maximized by testing potential cut points for disease classes defined by the ct score in a contingency table. disease classification by the different scoring schemes is summarized in table  <dig> 

on day  <dig>   <dig> % of the animals were assigned to identical disease classes by both imaging methods, while  <dig> % of the pigs were judged to be more affected based on x-ray and  <dig> % were judged more severely ill by ct. on day  <dig>   <dig> % of the animals were assigned to identical disease classes by ct and radiography, while  <dig> % of the pigs were judged more severely ill by ct and  <dig> % by x-ray compared to ct examination. compared to gross pathology, results of radiographic examination at day  <dig> were accordance in  <dig> % of pigs, while  <dig> % were judged to be more affected according to radiography, i.e.,  <dig> % were judged as less affected by radiography. after maximization of the agreement between disease classes defined by the ct score and the established lung lesion score  <dig> % of the pigs were assigned to identical disease classes by gross pathology and ct examination on day  <dig>   <dig> % were classified as more severely affected by gross pathology than by ct examination, and no animals were assessed as more severely affected by ct. for the detection of lung changes, the positive predictive value of ct was calculated to be 100% and the negative predictive value was 83% .

discussion
the impact of computed tomography in veterinary medicine has increased during the last few years. especially in small animals and horses ct is useful because of its routine feasibility and diagnostic reliability  <cit> . in contrast, ct has not been established as a routine imaging method in livestock medicine so far due to high investigation costs, time-consuming and personnel-intensive procedures and limited availability of equipment. in addition, ct examination of large animals is limited by the gantry diameter of most ct devices  as well as size and capacity of the examination table with a maximum load of 160 kg  <cit> . therefore, as described by barbee and allen , ct examinations in horses are only carried out on the head, neck and limbs  <cit> . computed tomography in pigs as animal models for human medicine has been used in several studies  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to investigate the characteristic morphological alterations of lung tissue after experimental app challenge using computed tomography in pigs. furthermore, the diagnostic potential and limitations of ct in pigs were compared with those of digital radiography. on the basis of the collected ct findings in living animals, a quantitative scoring system for determining the lung status of diseased pigs was derived. this scoring system is of high practical importance for follow-up studies during the course of experimental challenges with app but can not be transferred to other respiratory pathogens. the ct protocol used, based on 7 mm slices and a reconstruction interval of 5 mm was found appropriate for the detection of macroscopic lung lesions attributed to app. the detection of microscopic lung changes such as interstitial pneumonia  is expected to require slices as narrow as 1 mm  <cit> . these conditions could not be achieved with the type of ct equipment and the short examination times used in our study. the examination time limit has not been determined in this study. it depends on the length of time the pigs remain anaesthetised and the speed of data capture by the ct equipment.

the clinical signs after experimental app challenge of  <dig> pigs ranged from nil to severe symptoms, with two affected animals requiring euthanasia due to severe dyspnoea on days  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. these results were reflected in the gross pathological findings which ranged from normal lungs to severe pleuropneumonia.

ct examination of animals in the challenged group showed ground-glass opacities and consolidations on days  <dig> and  <dig>  ground-glass opacities are caused by partial filling of the alveolar spaces, by thickening of the interstitium, partial collapse of alveoli, or an increased capillary blood volume  <cit> . as shown in several other studies, app infections are accompanied by swelling of capillary endothelia and thickening of alveolar septa in the first hours after challenge, followed by fibrinous exudation, migration of inflammatory cells and haemorrhage  <cit> . these pathological changes were found by ct examination in the form of hazy areas with an increase in lung density as well as more prominent bronchial and vascular outlines.

consolidations are caused by an accumulation of transudate or exudate, which replace the alveolar air or by a collapse  in lobules. therefore, they can be distinguished from ground-glass opacities because of the obscured underlying vessels and airway walls  <cit> . in the present study ct-diagnosed consolidations appeared as focal, homogeneous compaction of the lung with obliteration of the vascular and bronchial walls. these changes are due to focal necrosis, edematous and widened interstitia and serofibrinous exudates. according to the cross-sectional ct images, typical lesions caused by app were characteristically distributed throughout the lungs with a higher prevalence in the diaphragmatic lobes  <cit> . a quantitative measurement of lung tissue density for characterising macroscopic and microscopic lung tissues alterations using ct is possible, however, with some limitations  <cit> . the measurement of tissue density was used to characterise consolidations typical for app infection such as abscess-like nodules encapsulated in connective tissue. galanski  described the density value of abscesses ranging between  <dig> and  <dig> hu while pure pus has a ct value of  <dig> hu  <cit> . others have found connective tissue formation and necrotic processes after experimental piglet infection with bordetella bronchiseptica and pasteurella multocida were of high densities  in ct scans  <cit> . the average density of consolidations occurring in this study was also in the positive range of the hounsfield scale compared to the physiological density of lung tissue which ranges from − <dig> hu to − <dig> hu  <cit> . therefore, density measurement enabled a tentative diagnosis of the presence of accumulated pus, abscess-like nodules and necrotic areas.

density measurements in areas with non-homogeneous, partially compacted and poorly defined ground-glass opacities cannot be performed  <cit> . within these areas varying densities at the observation time occurred due to spontaneous breathing with varying inspiration depth. this variability resulted in high standard deviations of the measured values. others have indicated that reproducible density measurements over time are only feasible at controlled inspiration depth  <cit> .

both the ct and the x-ray examinations strongly correlated with each other and with the clinical findings on days  <dig> and  <dig>  however, for assessing the extent of lung alterations, a clinical scoring scheme alone is considered insufficient  <cit> , due to the fact that severe tissue damage can be compensated by remaining parenchyma without clinical manifestation  <cit> . this observation is supported by our finding that clinical scores showed only a weak correlation with gross pathological findings at the end of the experiment.

frequencies of cases within the severity classifications by ct, x-ray and necropsy were not consistent in all instances. as shown in this and other studies, pleurisy and pleural effusions could not be sufficiently differentiated from other gross pathological changes by ct and radiographic examination  <cit> . in some cases, false positive radiographic findings may occur especially in spontaneously breathing animals if the recordings are not carried out at the point of maximum inspiration  <cit> . false negative results may be due to the curvature of the diaphragm, hiding lung changes, including enlarged lymph nodes within the caudal lobes  <cit> . on the other hand, ct examination without overlapping organs, combined with cross-sectional images and a precise knowledge of anatomical structures enables the recognition of small lung tissue abnormalities. ct score graduation and its assignment to disease severity were chosen to ensure the best concordance with the disease classes defined by the lung lesion score. therefore, the disease severity score graduation developed in the present study should be considered a preliminary guide for the quantification of app induced lung lesions and should be further validated in a larger cohort study. ct of the thorax could also be evaluated in caesarian-derived, colostrum-deprived or in gnotobiotic piglets, because these are widely used for challenge experiments in human medicine.

our current approach compared the ct methodology with other methods that have been established in conventional pigs. based on our findings, it is possible to detect gross pathological lung tissue changes in living pigs, which can be applied to efficacy studies of drugs and vaccines, or pathogenesis studies at certain points of time. in the context of ethical considerations, the number of animals can be reduced, since animals do not have to be sacrificed and necropsied at different time points to monitor the course of infection.

CONCLUSIONS
ct thorax examination facilitated a high-contrast representation of characteristic but not pathognomonic app induced lung alterations. although ct examination is superior to radiography and can therefore be recommended for scientific application, radiography can also be used for diagnosing gross pathological lung changes in subclinically-affected pigs. however, the additional assessment of disease history, histological examination and microbiological findings is still indispensable for accurate diagnosis of respiratory diseases in pigs.
