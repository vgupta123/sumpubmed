BACKGROUND
plants do not passively accept abiotic stresses, such as drought, salinity and variations of temperature, or biotic aggressors, such as viruses, bacteria, insects and fungi. to cope with these environmental stressors, plant cells have developed coordinated and integrated molecular networks for stress signal perception, transduction and adaptation mechanisms under adverse conditions of growth. in general, some adaptive cellular responses to a specific stress condition are interconnected with other environmental responses  <cit> . for instance, conditions of water stress result in both nutritional and osmotic stress, which can also be caused by salt stress. similarly, increasing evidence in the literature has demonstrated the interconnection among the responses to pathogen attack and developmental signals  <cit> . in this complex interplay of physiological stresses, plant cells have evolved both anterograde and retrograde transduction pathways among the organelles to respond to environmental signals in an integrated and coordinated manner. one such major signaling organelle is the endoplasmic reticulum , which integrates a variety of responses against stresses  <cit> .

the er is a multifunctional organelle that supports a series of basic cellular processes, such as protein folding and quality control, the maintenance of ca2+ balance and lipid biosynthesis. any condition that disturbs er homeostasis and er function can induce stress in the organelle. in general, er stress is initiated by an imbalance between the rate of protein synthesis and er protein-processing activities. under conditions in which the nascent, unfolded polypeptide influx into the lumen of the er exceeds the folding and processing capacity of the organelle, unfolded proteins accumulate in the lumen of the er and, in turn, trigger a cytoprotective pathway designated 'the unfolded protein response , which has been described in details in mammalian cells . to alleviate er stress, the coordinated action of three upr transducers, activating transcription factor  <dig> , the inositol requiring kinase  <dig> , and double-stranded rna-activated protein kinase -like endoplasmic reticulum kinase , leads to the activation of the following three types of cellular response:  the up-regulation of er molecular chaperones, such as bip  and calnexin ;  the attenuation of protein translation that is mediated by perk through the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α ; and  the degradation of misfolded proteins by a process called 'er-associated degradation' . however, excessive or prolonged stress can lead to maladaptive responses and, ultimately, can activate apoptotic cell death to protect tissues from necrotic injury  <cit> . recent studies have demonstrated that er stress can also elicit an innate immunity defense to protect tissues in mammalian cells, and in plant cells, er stress is linked to the host defense response to microbial infections  <cit> . thus, in addition to the upr, other signaling pathways radiate from the er to the mitochondria, nucleus and possibly other organelles.

recently, a global expression profiling on tunicamycin-induced and polyethylene glycol -induced soybean leaves uncovered an er stress- and osmotic stress-shared response represented by co-regulated genes that was found to be synergistically induced by both stresses  <cit> . genes in this integrated pathway encode proteins with diverse roles, such as plant-specific development and cell death  domain-containing proteins, represented by the asparagine-rich proteins nrp-a and nrp-b, an ubiquitin-associated  protein homolog and nac  domain-containing proteins. nac proteins are plant specific transcriptional factors that are involved in a variety of developmental events as well as in biotic and abiotic stress responses . they comprise a large family of transcriptional regulator genes and, in the soybean genome, are represented by at least  <dig> sequences  <cit> .

the n-rich protein  genes, which demonstrated the strongest synergistic induction, share a highly conserved c-terminal dcd domain in addition to a high content of asparagine residues at their more divergent n termini  <cit> . this structural organization places nrp-a and nrp-b in the subgroup i of plant-specific dcd-containing proteins  <cit> . we have recently demonstrated that both nrp-a and nrp-b induce a senescence-like response when ectopically expressed in soybean cells and tobacco leaves  <cit> . these studies have demonstrated that er stress and osmotic stress pathways converge at the level of nrp gene activation to potentiate a cell death response. in fact, the combination of both stress signals intensifies the output of the different pathways upon nrp expression; therefore, nrps serve as molecular links that integrate the er stress and osmotic stress responses. this er stress- and osmotic stress-integrating response has been designated as the nrp-mediated cell death signaling, which is synergistically activated by both stress signals. we have recently demonstrated that the transcriptional factor gmerd <dig> acts upstream of nrps and activates the expression of nrp-a and nrp-b in response to osmotic stress and er stress  <cit> . although the integrated signaling pathway has the potential to accommodate general plant-specific adaptive responses, mechanistic knowledge of the pathway is lacking, and downstream components have yet to be identified. here, we describe a member of the nac domain-containing protein superfamily from soybean, gmnac <dig>  as a possible downstream component of the pathway. in addition to being synergistically up-regulated by a combination of er stress and osmotic stress signals, ectopic expression of gmnac <dig> causes senescence-like responses in planta, a phenotype that resembles the nrp-mediated response. we also found that nrps induce promoter activation and expression of gmnac <dig> genes.

RESULTS
gmnac <dig> is induced by er stress and osmotic stress individually but requires both signals for full activation
to identify components of the er stress- and osmotic stress-integrating nrp-mediated cell-death response, we searched among the co-regulated genes by both stresses  <cit>  for those that were synergistically induced by both stress signals. in this regard, we focused our attention on an est encoding a member of the nac domain-containing protein family and extended our search to other members of the soybean nac protein family. at least three members of the nac domain-containing protein family from soybean --gmnac <dig>  gmnac <dig> and gmnac6-- have been associated with senescence or cell death  <cit> . however, only gmnac <dig> was induced by the osmotic stress inducer, peg, and the er stress-inducing agents, tunicamycin  and l-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid , which cause protein misfolding in the er by different mechanisms . er stress  and osmotic stress  marker genes were included in the assay to ensure the efficiency of the tunicamycin and peg treatments. the combination of er stress and osmotic stress promoted a slightly more than additive effect on the accumulation of gmnac <dig> transcripts in a fashion similar to the induction of the nrp-a and nrp-b genes . these results indicate that the integration of er-stress and osmotic-stress signals leads to the full activation of gmnac <dig> 

we also examined the induction of other members of the soybean nac gene family, such as gmnac <dig>  which is up-regulated by peg  <cit>  and tunicamycin  as well as during leaf senescence  <cit> . the combined exposure of soybean seedlings to both stress inducers, however, did not promote an additive or synergistic effect on the induction of gmnac <dig>  taken together, these results substantiate the argument that gmnac <dig>  but not gmnac <dig>  may be a target of the nrp-mediated cell death signaling that integrates er stress and osmotic stress responses.

gmnac <dig> promotes cell death in tobacco leaves and in soybean cells
we have recently demonstrated that the integrated pathway transduces a programmed cell death  signal generated by er- and osmotic-stresses that results in the appearance of markers associated with leaf senescence  <cit> . to assess whether gmna <dig> is involved in cell death, we assayed for hallmarks of leaf senescence, such as chlorotic lesions, chlorophyll loss, lipid peroxidation and the induction of senescence-associated genes in tobacco leaf sectors infiltrated with agrobacterium carrying a 35s::gmnac <dig> construct. after five days post-infiltration, the leaf sectors expressing gmnac <dig> displayed a chlorotic phenotype with necrotic lesions that rapidly evolved to intense necrosis at seven days post-infiltration as a result of massive cell death; this observation was in marked contrast with the expression of an unrelated nig gene  <cit>  used as a negative control . we also noticed that the gmnac6-induced chlorotic phenotype appeared more rapidly than that promoted by expression of nrp-b gene . in fact, under similar conditions, the symptoms induced by nrp-b expression were first visible at  <dig> days post-agro-infiltration when an increase in membrane ion leakage of the nrp-b agroinfiltrated leaves was also observed .

the expression of gmnac <dig>  promoted chlorophyll loss in the agroinfiltrated sectors , an increase in membrane ion leakage of agroinfiltrated leaves  and a significant increase in lipid peroxidation  at five days after infiltration. the latter was examined by measuring the accumulation of thiobarbituric acid -reactive compounds, which was clearly enhanced in the 35s::gmnac <dig> agro-inoculated leave sectors, when compared with the leaf slices that were agro-inoculated with the control 35s::nig gene. these tba-reactive compounds are products of senescence-associated lipid peroxidation, a process that results in the generation of reactive oxygen species  and chlorophyll loss  <cit> .

we further confirmed the gmnac6-induced senescence-like phenotype by monitoring the expression of the senescence-associated gene markers, ntcp- <dig> . gmnac <dig>  which has also been shown to be associated with senescence in soybean  <cit> , induced the expression of npcp- <dig> and, to a much lesser extent, pr <dig> when transiently expressed in tobacco leaves, demonstrating the effectiveness of the assay in this heterologous system. taken together, these results indicate that gmnac <dig> expression induces a senescence-like response in tobacco leaves.

because nrps, effectors of the er stress and osmotic stress-integrating cell death response, have also been shown to induce cell death when transiently expressed in soybean cells, we examined whether gmnac <dig> could induce the activity of caspase 3-like and dna fragmentation in the endogenous system. the transient expression of gmnac <dig> was driven by the 35s promoter in soybean protoplasts and was measured by rt-pcr, relative to a helicase marker to control for any variation in the transformation efficiency . the caspase 3-like activity in total protein extracts from gmnac6-overexpressing soybean cells was  <dig> -fold higher than in extracts from protoplasts transformed with the empty vector . we also used the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dutp nick end labeling  technique to measure fragmentation of dna in individual cells  <dig> hours post electroporation . after tunel labeling, the fomaldehyde-fixed and permeabilized semi-protoplasted leaf cells were also counterstained with propidium iodide . under these conditions, pi stained all cells and the red fluorescence signal concentrates in the nucleus as we treated the samples with rnase . the nuclei of control cells transformed with the empty vector fluoresced intensely with propidium iodide  and exhibited only tunel-negative nuclei . in contrast, the gmnac6-expressing samples had tunel positive nuclei that showed the same extent of staining as nrp-b  and dnase treated positive controls. merged is an overlay of the fluorescent image of tunel labeling with pi staining cells to facilitate the identification of tunel-positive nuclei. from two independent experiments, approximately 21% ±  <dig>  of the semi-protoplasted leaf cells transformed with 35s::gmnac <dig> had tunel- positive nuclei. very likely the low efficiency of protoplasts transformation may account for the relatively low percentage of tunel positive nuclei in protoplasts electroporated with 35s::gmnac <dig>  because caspase 3-like activity and dna fragmentation have been described as biochemical markers associated with programmed cell death in soybean suspension cells  <cit> , our results are consistent with an involvement of gmnac <dig> in cell death events.

nrps and gmnac <dig> are coordinately induced by biotic stresses but with different kinetics
the activation of the nrp-mediated senescence-like response is not specific to er stress or osmotic stress but is, rather, a shared branch of general environmental adaptive pathways. in fact, nrps are also induced by other abiotic and biotic signals, such as drought and pathogen-incompatible interactions  <cit> . as a putative component of nrp-mediated signaling, we examined whether gmnac <dig> is induced by biotic signals as well . we first treated soybean leaves with cell wall-degrading enzymes , which mimic bacterial pathogen attack and induce a defense response  <cit> , and then we inoculated soybean leaves with the incompatible bacterium, pseudomonas syringae patovar tomato , as our experimental system. levels of gmnac <dig> mrna were examined at various times after treatment with cde and inoculation with the bacterial pathogen . as positive controls in the cde treatments, we also examined the expression of the er-resident molecular chaperones, binding protein  and calnexin , which have previously been demonstrated to be induced by cde  <cit> , and the glutathione-s-transferase  gene that is also co-regulated by er stress and osmotic stress  <cit>  in the same fashion as nrps and gmnac <dig> . for assaying the effectiveness of the incompatible bacterium, pseudomonas syringae patovar tomato, in soybean, we examined the induction of the pathogenesis-related genes, pr <dig> and pr <dig> . as with the nrps, both of the treatments promoted the induction of gmnac <dig> but with slightly different kinetics. the cde treatment  and bacterial inoculation  resulted in increased nrp-a and nrp-b transcript levels as early as  <dig> hour and  <dig> hour, respectively, after the treatments. in contrast to the rapid induction of nrps, the induction of gmnac <dig> occurred with delayed kinetics, similar to the er-resident chaperones, bip and cnx,  and the pathogenesis-related genes, pr <dig> and pr <dig> . the induction of gmnac <dig> by the cde treatment and by the inoculation of the incompatible bacterium was first detected  <dig> h after the treatments. the gmnac <dig> transcripts reached maximal accumulation at  <dig> h after inoculation of the soybean leaves with the incompatible bacterium . these results indicate that nrp-a and nrp-b induction precedes the increased expression of gmnac <dig> 

nrp-a and nrp-b induce the expression of the gmnac <dig> gene
the coordinated synergistic induction of gmnac <dig> by osmotic stress and er stress, along with its capacity to promote nrp-like senescence phenotypes and pcd-like responses in plants, linked gmnac <dig> to the er stress and osmotic stress-integrating nrp-mediated signaling. to position gmnac <dig> in this pathway, we examined the expression of gmnac <dig> and nrps in response to each other. the genes gmnac <dig> , nrp-a  and nrp-b  were placed under the control of the 35s promoter and overexpressed in soybean protoplasts derived from cultured cells. we first analyzed the kinetics of nrps and gmnac <dig> induction in response to the plant cell wall-degrading enzymes  used during the protoplasting procedure . nrp-b transcripts were rapidly and transiently induced by cde treatment, whereas the kinetics of gmnac <dig> induction was delayed. consistent with the delayed kinetics of the gmnac <dig> induction by cde treatment and physiological stresses, we found that the transient expression of gmnac <dig> in soybean protoplasts did not result in the increased accumulation of nrp transcripts . in contrast, the transient expression of both nrp-a or nrp-b induced gmnac <dig> expression . the increased accumulation of gmnac <dig> transcripts by nrps was a specific, rather than a general, phenomenon because the transient expression of nrp-a or nrp-b did not promote an up-regulation of other members of the soybean nac domain-containing protein family. these results demonstrate that nrps can induce gmnac <dig>  but gmnac <dig> cannot induce nrps.

transient expression of nrps activates the gmnac <dig> promoter in soybean cells
we next examined whether the observed activation of gmnac <dig> by nrps was at the transcriptional level by a transient expression assay in soybean protoplasts with an nrp-b promoter::β-glucuronidase  reporter construct. in this construct, a 5'-flanking sequence fragment of nrp-b  was used to drive gus expression. because gmnac <dig>  nrp-b and nrp-a are transiently induced during the protoplast preparation by cde  and wounding  <cit> , we measured the activity of the reporter gene at 36-h after transfection, when the expression of nrps returned to basal levels and the accumulation of gus driven by the cde- and wounding-induced gmnac <dig> promoter was expected to decline to lower levels . under these conditions, the transient expression of nrp-a and nrp-b in soybean protoplasts  resulted in increased reporter gene expression , indicating that the control of gmnac <dig> expression by nrp-b and nrp-b occurs, at least in part, at the transcriptional level. we also included the expression of the unrelated nig gene in the assay as a negative control for specific promoter activation.

discussion
in contrast to the upr, the nrp-mediated cell death signaling pathway is a plant-specific er-stress cell-death response that communicates with other environmental stimuli through shared components. in fact, osmotic stress also activates the transduction of a cell death signal through nrps. the convergence of both stress signals on nrp expression in a synergistic manner allows the transfer of information between these two distinct stress response pathways to potentiate a cell death response. therefore, the integration of the er stress and osmotic stress signals into a circuit of cell death occurs through the activation of nrp-mediated signaling. this cell death integrated pathway has emerged as a relevant adaptive response of plant cells to multiple environmental stimuli. nevertheless, knowledge about this signaling pathway is limited to the identification of nrp as a crucial mediator of the cell death response and gmerd <dig> as a transcriptional factor that activates nrps expression. here, we describe a member of the nac domain-containing protein family from soybean, gmnac <dig>  that may act downstream of nrp-a or nrp-b in the integration of the er-stress and osmotic-stress cell death signals. gmnac <dig> was linked to nrp-mediated cell death signaling based on three criteria. first, we showed that gmnac <dig> expression was up-regulated by er stress and osmotic stress individually, but when combined, the two stress signals promoted a synergistic accumulation of gmnac <dig> transcripts. the synergistic induction of gene expression by the combination of er stress and osmotic stress inducers is one of the criteria that link target genes to the er stress- and osmotic stress-integrating pathway. second, similar to the nrps, the transient expression of gmnac <dig> induced a senescence-like response in tobacco leaves and a cell death response in soybean cells. lastly, the ectopic expression of nrp-a and nrp-b in soybean cells promoted the activation of the gmnac <dig> promoter and the induction of gmnac <dig> expression. collectively, these results position gmnac <dig> downstream of the nrps in the er stress- and osmotic stress-integrating pathways . however, whether gmnac <dig> is linearly coupled to the nrps in the integrated pathway is still a matter of debate.

nrps and gmnac <dig> were also induced by biotic signals, such as incompatible interactions and cde treatment, but with different kinetics . while nrps were rapidly induced by both treatments, increased accumulation of gmnac <dig> transcritps occurred with a delayed kinetics. these data were consistent with the delayed induction of gmnac <dig> during protoplast preparation, which generates similar signal as the cde treatment. therefore, an increased accumulation of nrp-b transcripts preceded the induction of gmnac <dig> expression, which supports the argument that gmnac <dig> acts downstream of nrps. this interpretation is further substantiated by the observation that, in our experimental tobacco leaf transient expression system, gmnac6-induced cell death occurred more rapidly than nrp-mediated cell death, as it would be expected from effectors acting downstream of nrps in the cell death signaling pathway.

we found that nrp-b in soybean protoplasts induced gmnac <dig> expression and activated gmnac <dig> promoter. whether the nrp-mediated up-regulation of gmnac <dig> expression is a direct result of nrps transactivation of gene expression or a secondary effect of signal transduction mediated by nrp it remains to be determined. our data favor the latter hypothesis, as we have previously shown that soybean nrps are localized in the cytoplasm in association with the plasma membrane . the arabidopsis nrp homolog is also a cytosolic protein, but is translocated to the mitochondria under stresses conditions  <cit> . we don't know whether the soybean nrps also share a stress-mediated mitochondrial compartmentalization, but we have failed to demonstrate a nuclear localization of nrp-b as it would be expected for a transcriptional activation function. sequence analysis of 1-kb 5'flanking sequences of gmnac <dig> revealed some conserved motifs of most eukaryotic promoters, such as a tata box  and an inverted ccaat box , in addition to several potential regulatory elements of plant promoters, potentially involved in response to events of cell death or to osmotic stress and drought. these include an aba-responsive element, the motif iii of rice rab16b gene <dig> , a binding site  of osbihd <dig>  a rice bell homeodomain transcription factor involved in disease resistance, four putative elements  for the cytokinin-regulated transcription factor arr <dig> and two binding sites  found in the erd <dig> gene, involved in response to dehydration stress and dark-induced senescence. these putative cis-regulatory elements on the gmnac <dig> promoter illustrate potential sites for assembly of transcription factors, which might constitute targets of the nrp-mediated stress-induced cell death response.

the evidence that nrps and gmnac <dig> were also induced by biotic signals implies that the nrp-mediated cell death signaling is a general adaptive response of plants. the protective role of the induction of pcd by pathogens during incompatible interactions, a phenomenon well documented in plants, restricts the pathogenic attack to the inoculated cells  <cit> . the rapid induction of nrp genes by incompatible interactions indicates that the nrp-mediated induction of pcd may be part of the hypersensitive response. consistent with this hypothesis, the transient expression of gmnac <dig> in tobacco leaves promoted the induction of the pathogenesis-related gene  <dig>  pr <dig> and caused necrotic lesions.

in addition to being induced by er stress and osmotic stress, nrp-mediated signaling is also induced by drought  <cit> . these abiotic stress signals induce a shared cell death response through nrps. while the er stress branch of the response is distinct from the molecular chaperone-induced branch of upr  <cit> , we previously showed that the osmotic stress branch of the response may be acid abscisic -dependent  <cit> . in fact, both nrp-b and gmnac <dig> are induced by aba. furthermore, evidence in the literature has demonstrated an antagonistic effect of aba on salicylic acid -dependent defense pathways  <cit> . thus, it may be possible that the activation of nrp-mediated signaling leads to enhanced sa-mediated responses, as shown by the induction of pr <dig> and hypersensitive response-like phenotypes, and acts antagonistically to suppress aba-mediated responses. as aba is a central regulator of plant adaptation to drought  <cit>  and plays a crucial role in the regulation of transpirational water loss  <cit> , it would be interesting to investigate whether an inactivation of the nrp-mediated cell death response would promote tolerance to dehydration.

CONCLUSIONS
we have previously demonstrated that the integration of the er stress and osmotic stress signals into a circuit of cell death occurs through the activation of nrp-mediated signaling pathway  <cit> . expression of nrps has been shown to be regulated by gmerd <dig>  an er- and osmotic-stress-induced transcriptional factor  <cit> . here, we provided several lines of evidence that link the nac domain-containing protein gmnac <dig> to the nrp-mediated cell death response. like nrps, gmnac <dig> is synergistically activated by a combination of er stress and osmotic stress signals and induces a senescence-like response in planta and cell death in soybean protoplasts. nrps and gmnac <dig> are coordinately regulated by a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses but induction of nrps precedes the up-regulation of gmnac <dig>  consistent with this early induction kinetics, expression of nrps activates the gmnac <dig> promoter and induces gmnac <dig> expression. collectively, these results suggest that gmnac <dig> may act downstream of nrps in the er stress- and osmotic stress-integrating cell death response . this interpretation is further substantiated by the observation that transient expression of gmnac <dig> in tobacco leaves induces a more rapid cell death response than that mediated by nrp expression, as it would be expected from effectors acting downstream of nrps in the cell death signaling pathway. however, whether gmnac <dig> is linearly coupled to nrp in the integrated pathway remains to be determined.
