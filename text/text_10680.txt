BACKGROUND
as every cell type within one organism presumably contains the same genes, differential usage of the genome likely modulates functional differences between cell types. human blood cells derive from self-renewing hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells 
 <cit> . differentiating hspcs undergo progressive loss of differentiation capability in response to environmental conditions, resulting in terminally differentiated blood cells . red blood cells derive from hspcs via a common myeloid progenitor  and have a nucleated erythrocyte precursor 
 <cit> . t and b lymphocytes are related immune cell types, both arising through a common lymphoid progenitor 
 <cit> .

gene expression is dynamically regulated during differentiation, concurrent with epigenetic changes, including both atp-dependent and post-translational chromatin modification. brg1-mediated chromatin remodelling contributes to differentiation of both es cells and hspcs
 <cit> . a variety of histone modifications associates with gene expression. methylation of h <dig> lysine  <dig>  catalysed by the mll family of enzymes
 <cit> , positively associates with transcription
 <cit> , whereas trimethylation of h <dig> lysine  <dig>  mediated by the prc <dig> complexes, is associated with silencing
 <cit> . histone variant h2a.z localizes to active genes and destabilizes nucleosomes
 <cit> , enhancing access to the dna and facilitating transcription
 <cit> . integrating datasets has shown that multiple chromatin states associate with expression status
 <cit> , and indicated that histone modification patterns may be associated with cell type definition. in particular, coexistence of active and repressive marks at regulatory regions is linked to preparation of differentiation genes
 <cit> . after differentiation, this bivalency may resolve to allow either activation or repression.

as many previous results were obtained using cell lines cultured in vitro, they may not reflect dynamic changes of histone modifications occurring during differentiation in vivo. particularly, although it has been suggested that differentiation genes are bivalently modified in es cells, it is unclear how bivalency resolves during differentiation in vivo. we therefore took advantage of the well-characterized human hematopoietic system and tested the relationship of tissue-specific gene expression to epigenomic changes, and identified common and tissue-specific regulatory elements that may confer tissue-specific transcriptional regulation. our data indicate that key differentiation genes are primed in progenitor cells by bivalent modification and rna polii binding, some even in embryonic stem cells, prior to their expression in the downstream differentiated lineages. bivalent modification is retained in closely related parallel cell types but is resolved to silent chromatin structure in more remote lineages. using these epigenomic data, we have identified thousands of common and tissue-specific putative enhancers that might have critical roles in controlling the cell fate decisions during hematopoietic differentiation.

RESULTS
characterization of cell type-specific expression in hspcs, erythrocyte precursors, b, and t-cells
hspcs differentiate to generate erythrocytes, b-cells and t-cells. we first sought to characterize cell type-specific  gene expression therein. we calculated gene expression profiles using rna-seq
 <cit>  to identify pair-wise differential expression . e.g.,  <dig> genes were more highly expressed in hspcs than in b-cells and  <dig>  were more highly expressed in b-cells than in hspcs. since b-cells derive from hspcs, this indicates that  <dig> and  <dig>  genes are repressed and activated, respectively, during differentiation.

to identify ts genes, i.e. those expressed in only one cell type, we intersected those highly expressed in each of the pair-wise comparisons . indeed, their overall expression was significantly higher in their specific cell type . these gene lists included the markers used for isolating or defining the populations. e.g., cd <dig> and cd <dig> were hspc-specific; cd <dig> was t-cell-specific; cd <dig> was b-cell-specific; and cd <dig> was prbc-specific.

in addition to cell surface markers, key transcription regulators were also ts . among these genes were pax <dig>  the master regulator of b-cell development; gata <dig>  an important regulator of t-cell differentiation; foxp <dig>  a regulator of regulatory t-cells; and gata <dig>  a master regulator of rbc development. that these genes of known type-specific importance were called type-specific shows that our tests extract high-confidence type-specific transcripts.

kegg pathway analyses of ts genes showed associations with expected functions. the b-cell receptor signaling and iga production pathways were enriched in b-cell-specific genes ; t-cell-specific genes were similarly overrepresented in the t-cell receptor pathway, as well as in immunodeficiency and cell adhesion molecules . although erythrocyte transcripts, including many versions of hemoglobin, were specifically expressed in prbcs, these genes were enriched in kegg pathways of more general biochemical function .

chromatin environment at transcription start sites
to investigate relationships between gene expression and chromatin environment in progenitor and differentiated cells, we profiled genome-wide distributions of several histone modifications , histone variant h2a.z, chromatin remodeler brg <dig>  and rna polii using chip-seq . we then plotted tag densities surrounding transcription start sites  of hspc-specific genes . as expected for expressed genes, polii was highly enriched in these promoters in hspcs  while no appreciable binding of polii to these promoters occurred in prbcs , b-cells  and t-cells . similarly, brg <dig> was enriched in these promoters only in hspcs. h3k4me <dig> and h2a.z were enriched in promoters of hspc-specific genes not only in hspcs but also in t- and b-cells, but and less so in prbcs. while nominal promoter h3k27me <dig> signals were detected in hspcs, they were highly enriched in the other three cell types, confirming that gaining h3k27me <dig> at these hspc-specific genes during differentiation is associated with silencing . to investigate priming of hspc-specific genes, we investigated their histone modification status in embryonic stem cells   using published datasets
 <cit> . in escs, these promoters were enriched in h3k4me <dig>  indicating preparation for their expression in hspcs. however, the promoters were also marked with h3k27me <dig>  which was lost at the hspc stage, indicating further that their expression is associated with loss of h3k27me <dig> 

to expand these observations to further differentiated cells, we profiled chromatin proteins at b-cell-specific genes . we note that, although these genes were not yet expressed in hspcs, they had been associated with high levels of h3k4me <dig>  h2a.z and brg <dig> , and with high levels of h3k4me <dig> in escs , suggesting that priming of these genes occurred before their expression in the differentiated cells. binding of polii was also detected on 17% of these genes in hspcs, suggesting some were poised for expression. t-cells and b-cells descend from similar progenitors. b-cell-specific genes retained substantial signals of h3k4me <dig>  h2a.z and brg <dig> in t-cells , suggesting that these genes may have not been fully silenced and may retain expression potential.

the above analyses of cell type-specific genes indicate that, while h3k4me <dig> signals are generally correlated with gene expression though are sometimes present even in non-expressing cells, changes in h3k27me <dig> are more closely related to inactive expression states in different cell types. to extend this observation, we sorted all genes into  <dig> groups according to their rpkm in hspcs and averaged chip-seq read densities of these two modifications across a 6kb region surrounding tsss . indeed, average profiles of h3k4me <dig> at genes highly expressed in hpscs were consistent across all cell types, which may be related to the h3k4me <dig> signals at house-keeping genes, and levels of h3k4me <dig> positively associated with transcription . dna sequence analysis indicated that promoters associated with constitutive h3k4me <dig> were enriched in cpg islands . of  <dig>  promoters consistently enriched in h3k4me <dig> in the four cell types, 93% also contained a ucsc-defined cpg island
 <cit> ; merely 37% of promoters with no or inconsistent h3k4me <dig> enrichment contained a cpg island. the correlation between h3k4me <dig> and cpg islands was observed previously
 <cit> , however the additional correlation with h3k4me <dig> consistency was not. we also noted that all cell types showed enrichment of h3k4me <dig> upstream and downstream of a depletion at the tss, and that h3k4me <dig> extended further downstream of the tss than upstream. this pattern was similar to polii at the same tss groups, sorted and calculated in the same manner . despite fewer polii-bound than h3k4me3-associated promoters, the majority of tss groups showed some presence of polii positively correlating with expression. h3k27me <dig> signals were mainly enriched in gene groups with low expression and occupied much of the interrogated region, contrasting with h3k4me <dig> and polii .

the widespread signals of h3k27me <dig> suggest that it occupies broad domains, consistent with previous reports
 <cit> . to examine the size of h3k27me <dig> domains during differentiation, we compared the sizes of islands across the four cell types. the distribution of h3k27me <dig> island sizes peaked at around  <dig> kb in escs,  <dig> kb in hspcs, and increased substantially in prbc, t and b-cells , demonstrating that differentiation results in larger regions of h3k27me <dig> enrichment. we also found that h3k27me <dig> marks larger genomic regions in downstream cell types .

to further investigate changes and growth of h3k27me3-modified regions during differentiation, we performed a clustering analysis of regions enriched in h3k27me <dig> in these cell types . we evenly split each united region into ≤ 2kbp sections, creating  <dig>  regions enriched in h3k27me <dig> in at least one cell type. we found that most of the h3k27me3-enriched regions changed during differentiation, underscoring the variability of h3k27me <dig> targeting. in fact, most regions enriched in h3k27me <dig> in downstream cell types were not enriched in hspcs, and there was no cluster enriched in h3k27me <dig> in all five cell types. there were many regions that specifically gained h3k27me <dig> in either the t, b, or prbc stages, but relatively few that became enriched in all three. after assigning regions to their nearest gene within 20kb, we noted that regions enriched in h3k27me <dig> in a single cell type coincided with genes with non-hematopoietic function . genes nearest to h3k27me3-enriched regions in prbcs alone were enriched in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction genes , indicating repression of immunological pathways in this myeloid lineage. several type-specific genes coincided with regions enriched in h3k27me <dig> in one cell type, as highlighted in figure
3g, indicating silencing of signature gene expression. curiously, 80% of genes associated with the cluster of regions enriched solely in hspcs  remained silent in downstream cell types, even in the absence of h3k27me <dig>  this indicates that, while h3k27me <dig> enrichment is indicative of repression, its absence is not necessarily indicative of activation as subsequent factors may maintain silencing and/or activation factors may not be present.

the dynamic regulation of h3k27me <dig> during differentiation is exemplified at the hoxa and hoxb developmental gene loci, which show initial enrichment followed by substantial loss then reconstitution at select genes, corresponding with their expression
 <cit>  . this supports widespread h3k27me <dig> signals together with loss of active histone modifications stabilizing a silent chromatin conformation after differentiation.

bivalent marking of promoters in hspc and resolutions upon differentiation
the above indicates that genes specifically expressed in downstream cell types are associated with active chromatin marks, e.g. h3k4me <dig>  in upstream cell types, although they are not expressed and may be previously marked with silencing h3k27me <dig>  the coexistence of h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig>  termed bivalent modification, was discovered in es and t-cells and proposed as a preparation for genes to be expressed in response to environmental cues
 <cit> . we sought to understand differentiation-coupled bivalency resolution by constructing a heatmap of promoter bivalency status . most of the  <dig>  promoters showing bivalency in any of our five cell types were bivalent in escs and most of these lost bivalency in downstream cell types. stem cells had more bivalent genes than the more committed cell types, but several genes developed bivalency in downstream cell types.

to find examples of genes showing bivalency and resolution, we investigated the bivalent promoters in our cell types . a minor fraction of these was bound by polii. the venn diagram shows different partitioning of bivalent promoters in various cell types . several important genes with ts function were bivalently marked in progenitor or parallel non-expressing cells. the zinc finger transcription factor gata <dig> is essential for development of t-cells
 <cit> . our data indicate that, although the gata <dig> promoter was associated with h3k27me <dig> in hspcs and escs, consistent with its silent state, it also was marked by h3k4me <dig>  suggesting that the gene is primed for expression in progenitor cells . when expressed in t-cells, h3k27me <dig> disappeared from the gata <dig> gene, accompanied by appearance of polii. we note that both the h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> signals remained in b-cells , while the h3k4me <dig> signal largely disappeared in prbcs .

similarly, the gene for paired box transcription factor pax <dig>  the master regulator of b-cells, was associated with h3k4me <dig> and polii, but not h3k27me <dig> in b-cells . our data indicate that the pax <dig> promoter is bivalent and bound by polii in hspcs, and bivalent in escs, suggesting that the gene has been prepared for expression . interestingly, pax <dig> was still bivalent in t-cells, although the polii signal disappeared . in contrast, pax <dig> contained only h3k27me <dig> in prbcs, indicating that the gene is fully silenced therein .

in addition to the regulators discussed above, several other factors were bivalent in different combinations of the cell types . cd8a, a defining marker of cd8+ t-cells, was bivalent in all except the cd4+ t-cells, where it was monovalently active, indicating a potential for plasticity among t-cell subsets. another factor, tcf <dig>  which is essential for t-cell development as well as regulation of the self-renewal/differentiation switch
 <cit> , was bivalent in hspcs and escs, as was cardiac development regulator gata <dig>  in addition to cell type-related genes, several chromatin genes were bivalent. notably, all genes highlighted in additional file
1: figure s <dig>  except the histone genes and hdac <dig>  were also bivalent in escs.

globally, we found  <dig>  promoters bivalent in hspcs and calculated their bivalency status in each differentiated cell type . curiously, 20-40% of these promoters remained bivalent in differentiated cells, some of which may be important for further differentiation as previously seen for t helper cells
 <cit> . generally, more hspc bivalent promoters lost h3k27me <dig> than lost h3k4me <dig>  except in prbcs. we also investigated promoters that became bivalent in downstream cell types and analyzed their status in hspcs. strikingly few promoters had had neither mark in hspcs. we noted that prbcs, which differ from the other cell types as they were differentiated ex vivo from hspcs
 <cit> , showed slight differences in ratios of bivalent hspc promoter resolutions—many more lost h3k4me <dig> than remained bivalent, and fewer newly bivalent promoters had had h3k27me <dig> enrichment in hspcs. this may reflect the degree of commitment of the cell type, as b and t-cells differentiate further. although many bivalent promoters lost h3k27me <dig> enrichment in downstream cell types, most did not gain appreciable expression as a result . this further indicates a role for other factors maintaining silencing in the absence of h3k27me <dig>  many more genes were bivalently marked in escs than hspcs. nearly 40% of promoters bivalent in hspcs were also bivalent in escs. surprisingly few promoters bivalent in hspcs were marked exclusively by h3k27me <dig> in escs, further indicating that genes are primed for expression notably early in development.

we also examined bivalent priming of ts genes . these results indicate that many genes expressed in downstream cell types are primed for expression in progenitor cells. several ts genes with transcription factor activity were bivalent in hspcs , underscoring the importance of bivalency in controlling expression of lineage regulators. however, priming of these genes with polii was not extensive in hspcs. several of these genes had multiple isoforms, which showed differences in bivalency at their discrete promoters, while all isoforms were type-specific by their expression. this suggests a role for chromatin in mediating isoform-specific expression.

prediction and analysis of distal regulatory elements from chromatin profiles
distal regulatory elements play critical roles in lineage fate decisions and may contain cell type-specific chromatin modification patterns
 <cit> . chromatin modifications and binding of chromatin-modifying enzymes indicate the presence of potential regulatory elements
 <cit> . enrichment of h3k27ac and binding of p <dig> are detected at active enhancers
 <cit> . in order to completely survey both active and poised enhancers, we used enrichment of h2a.z and/or h3k4me <dig> to predict genomic regions outside of a promoter  as potential enhancers, since previous studies reported that enhancers are associated with h3k4me1
 <cit>  and the histone variant h2a.z
 <cit> . among enriched sites in each cell type , we identified  <dig>  regions enriched in these marks across all four cell types . we also found regions enriched in these marks in only one cell type  . among the regions enriched in the marks were several from the hemoglobin beta chain gene locus, which have been reported as functional enhancers . other known enhancers predicted by our method included the first intron of the runx <dig> gene, which contains a functional enhancer, a pax <dig> enhancer, and the plat enhancer. these results indicate that our method is successful in finding regions with enhancer activity.

to examine chromatin modifications at these predicted enhancers, we plotted chip-seq reads at the  <dig>  cpes . cpes were consistently enriched in our defining marks  and active marks , but were depleted of h3k27me <dig>  in contrast to cpes, hspc cspes exhibited enhancer-like chromatin only in hspcs . in other cell types, hspc cspes lost active h2a.z and h3k4me <dig> marks, and gained h3k27me <dig>  curiously, h3k27me <dig>  whose function is poorly understood, was present at hspc cspes in all cell types . similarly, b-cell cspes showed elevated active marks in b-cells , and lost active marks but gained the repressive h3k27me <dig> mark in other cell types . we note that b-cell cspes were already associated with elevated levels of brg <dig> binding in hspcs , suggesting that chromatin remodeling by brg <dig> may be required for subsequent establishment of b-cell-specific enhancers, consistent with previous observations in erythrocyte differentiation
 <cit> . the presence of poorly understood h3k27me <dig> is puzzling, as previous analyses have shown that h3k27me <dig> in gene bodies positively correlates with expression
 <cit> , and that it may show some enrichment in enhancers
 <cit> . that these ts elements contain repressive marks in the other cell types is logical, since, combined with the lack of active marks, this could result in silencing of target genes.

to investigate how predicted enhancers correlate with the expression of nearby genes, we compared the counts of cspes associated with ts genes and versus cspes associated with all genes with rpkm greater than  <dig> . we found that type-specific expression tended to associate with more cspes, indicating that these cspes tend to be expression activators.
 <dig> for p-values and discussion.

to associate histone marks at cspes with expression, we compared the distributions of prbc expression of genes associated with prbc-specific cspes enriched in different marks . genes associated with a cspe were more highly expressed than all genes , further indicating that these elements positively correlate with expression. genes associated with a polii-bound cspe tended to show higher expression  . polii at these potential enhancers may result from direct binding of polii to enhancers or indirectly from enhancer-promoter interactions. several histone modifications at cspes were tested for their impact on expression of their nearest genes , showing strong evidence that chromatin environments of these elements correlates strongly with expression.

discussion
epigenomic changes during development are crucial factors that explain type-specific function
 <cit> ,
 <cit> . here we compared expression and epigenomic differences among human hematopoietic progenitors and downstream lineages. our results indicate that genes activated in downstream lineages are marked by bivalent histone modifications and some are also bound by rna polii in progenitor cells. bivalent modifications resolve in specific lineages but may remain in parallel differentiated lineages, depending on the relative distance of the cell types. we also predict enhancer-like elements that may contribute to the observed tissue-specific expression.

co-existence of active and inactive chromatin modifications at promoters has been detected in various cell types
 <cit> . genes with such bivalency preferentially show tissue-specific expression in downstream cell types
 <cit> . these promoters generally resolve to monovalency during differentiation
 <cit> ; most retain h3k4me <dig> in their specific cell type and retain h3k27me <dig> in alternate cell fates
 <cit> . although fewer bivalent genes have been observed in differentiated cell types than in stem cells, it is unclear how bivalency resolves during differentiation of progenitor cells to their direct downstream lineages in vivo. our analysis of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells  and in vitro differentiated erythrocyte precursors , in vivo differentiated cd4+ t-cells, and cd19+ b-cells in the blood compartment indicated that many genes critical for hspc differentiation are primed by bivalent modification and may also be bound by polii in hspcs prior to differentiation. e.g., the t-cell regulator gata <dig> and the b-cell master regulator pax <dig> were both bivalent in hspcs; they became uniquely expressed and resolved to monovalently active in t and b-cells, respectively. polii bound pax <dig> in hspcs. bivalency is not limited to promoters; we noted several enhancer-like regions showing the presence of both active and repressive marks in specific cell types . as suggested by previous publications, bivalency primes these critical genes for expression during differentiation
 <cit> . obviously, bivalent genes are heterogeneous in both histone modification enrichments and expression behavior. they can be separated into different groups based on the ratio between h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> enrichment, and the enormous variation in this ratio translates into important differences in gene expression behavior
 <cit> .

curiously, gata <dig> remained bivalent in b-cells and pax <dig> remained bivalent in t-cells, indicating that these closely related lymphocyte types might possess some potential for plasticity between them. this is consistent with a previous report that bivalent modification of key regulators in t helper cells are linked to their plasticity
 <cit> . although pax <dig> is bivalent in both the progenitor hspcs and t-cells, the chromatin remodeling factor brg <dig> and polii are associated with the promoter in hspcs but not in t-cells, suggesting that changes in chromatin and expression potential have occurred after differentiation to t-cells. in contrast, both the gata <dig> and pax <dig> genes lost h3k4me <dig> in prbcs, silencing them in this distantly related cell type, indicating little likelihood of direct transdifferentiation between these lymphoid and myeloid cell types. indeed, conversion of pax5-deleted b-cells into t-cells has been performed, albeit through de-differentiation into progenitor cell types
 <cit> . factors implicated in chromatin structure and modification, c/ebpα and c/ebpβ, can transdifferentiate b-cells into macrophage-like cells
 <cit> . gata <dig> itself was shown to mediate histone modifications at great distances from its binding sites in mouse
 <cit> . together, these results indicate substantial opportunities for epigenetic-mediated transdifferentiation of blood lineages, which is furthered by our analysis of incomplete silencing of ts factors in parallel cell types

establishment of novel bivalency in partially differentiated progenitors is an underaddressed trait of development. several genes that were not bivalent in hspcs became bivalent downstream. strikingly few genes had neither mark in hspcs and subsequently become bivalent. bivalency seems to thus be both established and resolved in a stepwise manner, as relatively few genes lose both active and repressive marks between differentiation stages . for example, while h3k27me <dig> at the hox loci changes drastically from esc to hspc and beyond , most of the genes in these clusters retained h3k4me <dig> in the promoter regions . this may be explained as h3k27me <dig> targeting genes for selective repression initially, while h3k4me <dig> changes are secondary or occur on final commitment. in fact, we see that many more changes in h3k4me <dig> occur between hspcs and the strongly committed prbcs, while most other notable changes between cell types are h3k27me3-related. the stability of promoter h3k4me <dig> may be related to the presence of cpg islands within the promoter. this establishment of bivalency in non stem-like populations may require further attention to fully investigate its importance. we acknowledge that there are other silencing mechanisms such as h3k9me <dig> or dna methylation in the cells, which may or may not overlap with the h3k27me <dig> pathway. more analyses of these different chromatin modifications are required for a more complete understanding of gene priming, repression and activation during differentiation of these cells.

chip-seq is performed on a population of cells, and homogeneity of this population is crucial to analyses that describe subsets
 <cit> . although the cells used in this study were defined and purity-assessed by the cell surface markers, bivalent modification detection may have resulted from cellular heterogeneity
 <cit> . we have previously shown
 <cit>  via sequential chip that both h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> can exist at the same promoter, but whether or not these marks exist on the same histone, or are functional in a single-nucleosome context is still unknown.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we identified tissue-specific genes in the human blood compartment and compared gene expression status with chromatin modification patterns. based on the gene expression and chromatin modification patterns, we have predicted tens of thousands of potential core regulatory elements shared by all cell types and potential tissue-specific regulatory elements and show that a combination of both h3k4me <dig> and h2a.z is a better predictor of enhancer activity than either alone. we have shown that bivalent chromatin modification in the well-characterized human hematopoietic system is not only resolved but also established during differentiation in a generally stepwise manner. while much of h3k4me <dig> enrichment is stable across cell types, h3k27me <dig> varies more frequently and grows to cover more of the genome during differentiation. these epigenomic data and identification of potential regulatory elements will be useful for further understanding the mechanisms governing decision making and differentiation of hematopoietic cell types.
