BACKGROUND
cassava, manihot esculenta subsp esculenta crantz , is a starchy root crop and the primary staple for over  <dig> million people worldwide  <cit> . native to the neotropics  <cit> , cassava is now cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions in asia, latin america and africa. in  <dig>  africa was the world's largest producer with  <dig> million tons out of a global production of  <dig> million tons  <cit> . cassava can grow under adverse climatic conditions with erratic rainfall and on marginal land under low intensity management  <cit> . because of these attributes, cassava plays an essential food security role in africa. in addition to food, cassava also has important industrial uses for the production of starch-based products, alcohol and animal feed  <cit> .

like most vegetatively propagated crops, cassava is highly heterozygous. low rates of flowering and the long breeding cycle further render conventional breeding of cassava arduous  <cit> . breeders have used controlled wide crosses with wild manihot species for cassava improvement: for example, resistance to mosaic virus and bacterial blight has been successfully transferred from manihot glaziovii to locally adapted cassava cultivars in africa  <cit> . because the genus manihot is largely inter-fertile, wild species could further broaden the genetic base of cultivated cassava  <cit> . natural hybridization between wild manihot and cultivated cassava has also been reported  <cit> .

molecular marker technology is an efficient tool for the characterization and management of plant genetic resources and also in crop improvement programs. among the different classes of molecular markers, microsatellites or simple sequence repeats  are widely utilized for genetic diversity and genetic mapping because they are largely co-dominant, multi-allelic, have good genome coverage and can be multiplexed on semi-automated systems  <cit> . in the case of cassava, ssr markers have been utilized for the characterization of genetic resources  <cit>  and an ssr-based molecular genetic map for cassava comprising  <dig> markers was described  <cit> . despite these advances, the development and utilization of molecular markers for cassava lags behind the achievements of other major crop plants. for example, in case of barley, a high density microsatellite consensus map with  <dig> ssr loci has been described  <cit> .

in recent years, est and cdna resources for cassava have increased substantially  <cit> . cassava genomic and est resources will further vastly increase with the recent completion of a draft cassava genome sequence and associated est projects . these datasets constitute valuable and inexpensive sources of molecular markers such as snps  <cit>  and microsatellites, since these can be readily detected computationally. thus, mining these resources provides an opportunity to greatly expand the database of molecular markers for cassava at minimal cost.

cassava is a member of the euphorbiaceae family. the invasive weed leafy spurge  and the oilseed plant castor bean  are other important members of this family. a draft genomic sequence for castor bean is available and both castor bean and leafy spurge have extensive est resources . with the recent completion of the cassava genome sequence, cassava and castor bean will constitute a valuable comparative genomics system.

the objectives of this study were to  increase the number of ssr markers by mining a previously developed cassava  <dig>  unigene set;  characterize est-derived microsatellite markers in terms of abundance and level of polymorphism; and  assess their transferability to other taxa in the euphorbiaceae. the approach taken has been to characterize and validate  <dig> microsatellites identified in silico from a cassava unigene set by dna fingerprinting a sample set consisting of: cultivated cassava from africa, latin america and asia; four wild manihot relatives; and leafy spurge and castor bean, two more distantly related taxa within the euphorbiaceae.

RESULTS
frequency and distribution of microsatellites in the cassava transcriptome
a total of  <dig>  ests were used in this study, which were clustered in  <dig>  unigenes  <cit> . in total,  <dig> microsatellite repeats were identified in the  <dig>  unigenes . perfect repeats and imperfect repeats, i.e. repeats with small insertions or deletions within the repeat, were identified. mononucleotide repeats were not included due to difficulties in accurate sizing of polymorphisms. of  <dig> est-ssrs,  <dig>  were perfect repeats while  <dig>  were imperfect repeats. a total of  <dig> ests contained perfect as well as imperfect repeats. also, several ests contained  <dig> or more perfect or imperfect repeats. overall,  <dig> ests were identified in the  <dig>  unigene set that contained microsatellite repeats.

ssr loci were classified by repeat type and structure . the most frequent number of repeats per motif was between  <dig> and  <dig>  thus microsatellites in cassava ests are rather small, in agreement with previous findings in coffee  <cit>  eggplant  <cit>  and barley  <cit> . since the unigene set represented  <dig>  mb of the cassava transcriptome, the average distance between ssrs is approximately  <dig>  kb or one ssr-containing est every  <dig>  ests. this number corresponds well with barley where the average distance between ssrs was  <dig>  kb or one ssr-containing est every  <dig>  ests  <cit> , coffea which has an average density of one microsatellite every  <dig>  kb  <cit> , but is lower compared to pepper  where one ssr was found in every  <dig>  kb est  <cit> .

the highest proportion of repeat motifs comprised di-nucleotide  repeats, followed by tri-nucleotide repeats . only five tetra-  and three penta-nucleotides  were found. this result is in contrast with the majority of earlier studies which report tri-nucleotide repeats as the most abundant class of repeats  <cit>  but in agreement with studies in picea species  <cit>  and coffea  <cit>  where di-nucleotide repeats were found to be the most abundant class. reported frequencies and distribution of est-ssrs is variable for different plant and animal species. this can be partly attributed to the microsatellite search criteria and the characteristics of the est database analyzed in these studies. since the cassava est dataset used in this study was sequenced from the 5'end, a greater proportion of the est-ssrs could be located in the 5'untranslated region rather than in the coding region where tri-nucleotide repeats are expected to be the predominant repeat type.

est-ssrs were identified in  <dig> % of the total number of contigs in cassava, compared to  <dig> % for pepper  <cit> ,  <dig> % for coffee  <cit> , and  <dig> % for wheat  <cit> . in this study, the ssr search was conducted on a unigene set which will return non-redundant ssrs. this approach results in a realistic estimate of microsatellite repeat frequency and ensures that est-ssr markers correspond to unique loci in the genome.

est-ssr marker development
out of the  <dig> unique ests containing microsatellites, primer pairs were designed for 346;  <dig> with perfect repeats  and  <dig>  containing imperfect repeats. the remaining sequences were inappropriate for primer design mainly because of insufficient dna sequence flanking the microsatellite core. in addition, duplicates  with an existing cassava ssr dataset  <cit>  were eliminated. one hundred and ninety-two randomly chosen primer pairs flanking di-, tri-, or tetrameric ssrs were optimized for pcr amplification using one or two cassava genotypes, tms <dig> and/or tme <dig>  details of the primer sequences and expected product size with ssr motif are described . of the  <dig> primer pairs tested,  <dig>  yielded scorable amplicons. this percentage of working primers  is in the range previously observed for zoysiagrass   <cit> , clementine   <cit> , eggplant   <cit>  and coffea   <cit> . twenty-seven primer pairs produced weak or no amplicons leading to exclusion from further analysis. nine microsatellites produced amplicons that were significantly longer than expected and most likely indicate the presence of introns. five of these produced fragments larger than  <dig> bp and could not be scored accurately for small differences in fragment size. these were also excluded from further analysis.

next, primer pairs with scorable amplicons were assayed for polymorphism among cassava cultivars from africa, asia and latin america . this panel included cassava landraces, elite breeding lines and some putative interspecific hybrids. to assess transferability of the est-ssrs to other taxa within the euphorbiaceae, the panel also included four wild manihot species, castor bean and leafy spurge. in order to assess the potential of the newly developed est-ssr markers for detecting polymorphism, all  <dig> primer pairs yielding pcr products were tested on this diversity panel or on a subset thereof, hereafter referred to as panel  <dig>  panel  <dig> is a subset of  <dig> genotypes, intended to represent the larger sample set; it includes cassava cultivars from  <dig> different countries in africa, south america and asia, three wild manihot species, plus castor bean and leafy spurge . overall,  <dig> primer pairs  showed polymorphisms in the germplasm analyzed, as illustrated for meessr <dig> . of the  <dig> polymorphic primers,  <dig>  were for perfect ssrs while  <dig>  were for imperfect ssrs. thus perfect ssr repeats were more polymorphic than imperfect repeat types. when only cultivated cassava was considered,  <dig> out of  <dig> markers tested on panel  <dig> were polymorphic, corresponding to a frequency of  <dig> %. the difference in level of polymorphism between cultivated cassava and all genotypes in panel  <dig> is due to the presence of additional, unique alleles in the wild manihot species.

1accessions included in diversity panel  <dig> 

marker polymorphism for cultivated cassava in this study is about  <dig> -fold higher compared to a study on cassava est-ssrs where  <dig> % polymorphism was detected   <cit> . in citrus, more than 90% of est-ssr markers were polymorphic which is higher compared to our results  <cit> . fluctuations in level of polymorphism detected in est-ssrs can be explained in part by the level of diversity among the germplasm surveyed. the higher frequency of polymorphism observed here compared to the study of tangphatsornruang et al.  <cit>  is possibly due to the inclusion of diverse landraces from  <dig> different countries in africa, latin america, asia as well as elite cassava genotypes in this panel. since polymorphism was scored on high resolution agarose gels, it is also possible that the level of polymorphism is higher than the frequency reported here since allelic variants with small size differences may not have been resolved on this system. overall, our results show that mining ests for the development of ssrs is a highly effective strategy to increase the ssr database for cassava.

out of  <dig> markers with clear amplicons tested on the  <dig> cassava cultivars of panel  <dig>   <dig>  showed non-amplifying or null alleles in one or more genotypes. therefore null alleles were common among the diverse cassava cultivars examined here. null alleles for genic ssrs have also been described in other plant species such as for example kiwifruit  <cit> , amongst others. the frequency of null alleles is influenced by several factors, including the diversity of the germplasm tested and technical aspects such as quality of the sequence data for primer development or pcr conditions. in a study on sunflower and related wild relatives, a clear relationship was found between genetic distance and amplification failures, with the frequency of null alleles ranging from  <dig> % for an inbred sunflower accession to  <dig> % among a wild sunflower species  <cit> . in a sample of wheat germplasm consisting of  <dig> diverse genotypes, null alleles for est-ssrs occurred at a frequency of 45%  <cit>  which is higher compared to the result obtained here. in view of the highly heterozygous nature of cassava and the occurrence of point mutations and/or insertion-deletions in the est-ssr alleles outside the microsatellite repeat region , most null alleles observed in the present study are likely due to sequence variation in the primer binding sites.

ssrs are assumed to be locus specific. cassava is considered an allotetraploid with disomic inheritance  <cit> . therefore we expect amplification of one or two bands per locus. out of  <dig> markers tested on panel  <dig>   <dig>  amplified one or two alleles per locus while the remaining  <dig>  markers amplified more than two bands for at least one genotype . in a previous study on genomic microsatellites in cassava  <cit> , approximately 80% of the markers detected one or two alleles per accession, thus suggesting a fairly low degree of genomic microsatellite locus duplication. our results show about a two-fold higher frequency of markers amplifying more than two bands per genotype. this is surprising in view of the fact that genic ssrs are generally considered to be more conserved compared to genomic ssrs  <cit> . however, multiple bands could also be due to the presence of multigene families. therefore, in case of genic ssrs, the multiple bands could be due to cross-amplification of conserved members of multigene families. it should be noted that the frequency of multiple loci reported here represents a minimum estimate, considering that this result is based on high resolution agarose gel electrophoresis which does not resolve all allelic variants . similarly, the frequency of polymorphism reported here is a conservative estimate as markers with an allelic size range of 3- <dig> bp or less may have escaped detection. while the resolution of the agarose gel system is limited to about 3- <dig> bp, it does allow for a rapid screening of candidate microsatellite markers.

cross-species and cross-genera transferability
cross-species transferability of the new cassava-derived ssr markers was tested for three wild manihot species and two other euphorbiaceae taxa; leafy spurge and castor bean. in general, the markers resulted in robust cross-species amplification with alleles of comparable sizes in cassava cultivars and the wild manihot species. out of  <dig> amplicons tested,  <dig> amplified for tms <dig> ;  <dig> for tme <dig> ;  <dig> for tme <dig>  which are cassava cultivars, while  <dig> amplified for m glaziovii ;  <dig> for m brachyandra  and  <dig> for m epruinosa  which are wild manihot species. overall, a transferability of ~94% was observed for the wild manihot relatives, i.e.  <dig> markers amplified alleles from one or more wild species. in agreement with this, it was previously demonstrated in cassava that genomic ssrs can be used to assess its wild relatives  <cit> . by contrast, only  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, of the est-ssr markers yielded amplicons in castor bean and leafy spurge. moreover, the sizes of the amplicons from castor bean and leafy spurge were often outside the allelic range observed in cultivated cassava and the wild manihot species , suggesting that these may not represent orthologous sequences. these numbers are very similar to those obtained in a study on the compositae where transferability from sunflower  to wild species was  <dig> % while transferability to the more distantly related genera safflower  and lettuce  was  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively  <cit> . thus, the cassava est-ssr markers display broad utility within the genus manihot but limited utility beyond the genus level, in agreement with previous studies in plants  <cit> . it should be pointed out that amplification of the genic ssrs in the wild species does not necessarily imply that these loci are polymorphic in these species, since only a single accession was analyzed per taxon.

allelic polymorphism and genetic relationships
a subset of  <dig> randomly selected polymorphic est-ssrs producing one or two amplicons per genotype was tested for their potential in genetic studies by ascertaining the genetic diversity in panel  <dig>  alleles were resolved by semi-automated fluorescence-based genotyping to attain a more accurate estimation of the allelic diversity and size range. good amplification was obtained for all the markers across the tested genotypes. leafy spurge and castor bean produced fewer amplicons compared to cassava and the wild manihot species, in agreement with the results obtained from high resolution agarose gel electrophoresis.

the  <dig> polymorphic est-ssr markers generated  <dig> alleles and discriminated all  <dig> accessions into different clusters according to their phylogenetic relationship. the principal coordinate plot  shows the genetic relationship and distribution of the panel. the first and second principal coordinates accounted for  <dig> % of the total variation, and showed an effective clustering among the species. from the principal coordinate plot, three groups were clearly shown:  the cassava accessions  the wild manihot species and  castor bean and leafy spurge. next, a dendrogram was constructed to show the genetic differentiation of the cassava accessions and wild manihot species . the dendrogram grouping showed the expected separation of the cultivated cassava accessions from their wild relatives, in agreement with the cluster grouping obtained from the principal coordinate plot. in addition, the dendrogram revealed expected genetic relationships between cassava cultivars based on their pedigree or previous diversity studies. for example, tms  <dig> and tms  <dig> are two progeny from tms  <dig> and group together in the dendrogram, in agreement with their shared ancestry  <cit> . genetic similarity was also detected between tme <dig> and tme <dig>  landraces from benin and togo respectively, in agreement with a previous genetic diversity study based on  <dig> genomic ssrs  <cit> . overall, this analysis supports the botanical classification of the germplasm surveyed and suggests the usefulness of the est-ssr markers for genetic diversity studies and other genotyping applications in cassava and its wild relatives.

the allelic diversity and extent of polymorphism for panel  <dig> accessions were also determined and are summarized in table  <dig>  the number of alleles per locus ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> with an average of  <dig>  alleles per marker. the allele size of the original tme <dig> est sequences all fall within the allele size range determined by fluorescence-based genotyping as summarized in table  <dig>  as expected. the number of alleles per locus is higher compared to a previous study on cassava est-ssrs where this ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . in the latter study, alleles were detected on polyacrylamide gels after silver staining. the higher number of alleles observed in our study is likely due to the higher resolution of fluorescence-based genotyping as well as the inclusion of three wild species, leafy spurge and castor bean in the panel. in previous studies on genomic ssrs in cassava, an average of  <dig>  alleles per locus  <cit>  and  <dig>  alleles per locus  <cit>  was detected which is higher compared to the value  <dig>  found here for the genic ssrs. the average allelic size range for the cassava est-ssrs described here is  <dig>  bp which is lower compared to the value of  <dig>  for seven cassava genomic ssrs previously analyzed using fluorescence-based genotyping  <cit> . est-ssr markers were found to be less polymorphic compared to genomic ssrs in other crop plants such as rice and barley  <cit> . in cultivated durum wheat, est-ssr markers were less powerful in discriminating genotypes compared to genomic sources, though they produced higher quality markers, i.e. with fewer stutter bands  <cit> . the polymorphism information content  values of the est-ssr markers identified here varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with an average of  <dig>  . these values are within the range of those reported for other plant species where average pic values of est-ssr markers varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . in terms of allelic polymorphism, our results in cassava seem to support the findings in other species such as rice and maize where microsatellites from coding regions tended to have a narrower allele size range and be less polymorphic than those derived from genomic clones. it will be interesting to compare the est-ssrs described here to the genomic ssrs previously developed for cassava in terms of discriminating power and quality.

est-ssrs as functional markers
to assess functionality of the new markers, blastx searches were performed for  <dig> ests containing polymorphic ssr. these results are summarized  and showed that a putative function could be assigned to  <dig> ests  assuming a threshold of e< <dig> - <dig>  while  <dig>  corresponded to predicted or hypothetical proteins. ten ests  produced no significant match. cassava ests that produced no specific matches, or matches to hypothetical or unknowns, were then compared to annotation of the original cassava est-database  to identify potential arabidopsis homologues. this search resulted in annotation of an additional  <dig> est sequences, bringing the total number of matches to proteins with a putative function to  <dig> . as expected, most searches retrieved sequences from castor bean  followed by poplar , two plant species whose complete genomic sequence has been determined and that are most closely related to cassava.

CONCLUSIONS
in cassava, the number of published ssr markers is limited compared to other major crops. in this study, an in depth analysis of genic microsatellites in terms of density, level of polymorphism, and informativeness is presented. a new set of  <dig> genic ssr markers with pic values comparable to genic ssrs in other plant species was developed. these resources will be of interest to the euphorbiaceae research community in general and the cassava research community in particular, where research focuses on basic and applied aspects of cassava biology, including germplasm characterization, breeding applications, and phylogenetic studies of manihot species. we have shown that mining ests is an effective strategy to identify functional microsatellites in the cultivated cassava gene pool with perfect repeats being more polymorphic that imperfect repeats. nearly all genic ssrs are readily transferable to other species within manihot but much less so with two other genera of the euphorbiaceae examined here, ricinus communis and euphorbia esula.
