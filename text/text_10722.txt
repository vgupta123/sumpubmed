BACKGROUND
bacteria communicate and coordinate population behavior through the mechanism of quorum sensing , which controls the expression of genes that affect a variety of bacterial processes  <cit> . qs is based on small signaling molecules, termed autoinducers , which control factors such as bioluminescence, pigment production, motility and biofilm formation, among many others . the qs, free-living marine bacterium vibrio harveyi produces and responds to at least three distinct ais  <cit> : hai- <dig>  an acyl homoserine lactone  <cit> ; ai- <dig>  a furanosyl-borate-diester  <cit> ; and cai- <dig>  a long-chain amino ketone -3-aminoundec-2-en-4-one   <cit> . ai- <dig> is referred to "universal autoinducer" as it is found in numerous gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . a better understanding of qs actions and novel ways to affect them is providing an opportunity to manipulate bacterial properties that are of major importance in industry, agriculture and medicine.

plant and endogenous cannabinoids have been investigated extensively, particularly as agonists of the endocannabinoid signaling system and as therapeutically active substances  <cit> . both delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol , the major psychoactive constituent of cannabis  <cit>  and cannabidiol , a non-psychoactive constituent, alter immune functions, mostly via suppression. the mechanism governing these activities has not been fully elucidated . in most investigations, these phytocannabinoids have been found to enhance the susceptibility of mice to microorganisms . however, several reports have indicated that administration of thc leads to lower viral loads and moderation of disease progression  <cit> .

the effect of cannabinoids on bacterial qs has never been investigated. we chose to study the activity of the synthetic cannabinoid hu- <dig> , because its physical and chemical properties have been well defined. hu-210 was first synthesized from -myrtenol  <cit> . it displays a multiplicity of biochemical, pharmacological, and behavioral effects, most of which depend on its potent agonistic activity at the cannabinoid receptors cb <dig> and cb <dig>  <cit> .fig.  <dig> chemical structure of the synthetic cannabinoid hu- <dig>  used in this study



RESULTS
effect of hu- <dig> on v. harveyi bioluminescence
to investigate the effect of hu- <dig> on the qs cascade of v. harveyi wild-type strain bb <dig> and qs-mutant strains , bioluminescence was measured with and without hu- <dig> in the growth media. first, we determined whether addition of hu- <dig> to the growth media alters the bioluminescence of the wild-type v. harveyi strain. results showed no significant difference in bioluminescence between samples with and without hu- <dig> . the experiments were repeated with other v. harveyi strains mutated in the qs cascade. addition of hu- <dig> to the growth media resulted in an up to 98 % decrease in the bioluminescence of v. harveyi mutant bb <dig> , in a dose-dependent manner, whereas bioluminescence of the mutant strain mm <dig>  was not significantly affected . however growth of v. harveyi mutant bb <dig>  and other mutant strains  was not affected by hu- <dig>  results indicated that a notable effect of hu- <dig> was specific to ai- <dig> in the qs cascade of v. harveyi, as this ai regulates qs of v. harveyi mutant strain bb <dig> table  <dig>

to further analyze the mode of action of hu- <dig>  another mutant strain, bb <dig>  was tested. bioluminescence in v. harveyi bb <dig> is mainly controlled by ai- <dig>  as this strain is not responsive to ai- <dig> stimulation due to the absence of sensor- <dig>  <cit> . in the presence of hu- <dig>  bioluminescence production by mutant strain bb <dig> was decreased by up to 85 %, further confirming the specific action of hu- <dig> on ai- <dig> . to validate the molecular qs target of hu- <dig>  another experiment was designed in which mutant strain mm <dig> , in the absence or presence of different doses of hu- <dig>  was simultaneously incubated with 10 %  spent medium containing exogenous ai- <dig> and ai- <dig> isolated from v. harveyi mm <dig>  and bb <dig>  respectively. the inhibitory effect of hu- <dig> on bioluminescence production was more pronounced in samples to which exogenous ai- <dig> had been added , suggesting that the effect of hu- <dig> is not only on the production of ai- <dig> signal, but also on the reception of those signal molecules by hybrid sensor kinases present in mutant strain mm <dig> .

interestingly when mutant strain bb <dig>  was supplemented with exogenous ai- <dig> from mm <dig>  and simultaneously treated with different concentrations of hu- <dig>  the latter's dose-dependent inhibitory effect could be reversed and bioluminescence level of this mutant strain restored to the similar level of the wild-type bb <dig>  except in sample with highest hu- <dig> concentration  .

effect of hu- <dig> on v. harveyi biofilm biomass and dna quantity
the effect of hu- <dig> on other qs-controlled processes in v. harveyi, such as biofilm formation, was also tested. biofilms were grown with and without different concentrations of hu- <dig> using different v. harveyi strains . the biofilm biomass formed by the different strains was quantified using crystal violet  staining. the effect of hu- <dig> on biofilm biomass formed by wild-type bb <dig> and mutant strain mm <dig> was minimal, as no significant decrease was observed with increasing concentrations of hu- <dig> . consistent with these results, an up to 80 % decrease was observed in biofilm biomass of mutant strain bb <dig> . inhibition of biofilm biomass formation by hu- <dig> in mutant bb <dig> was found to be dose-dependent .

this anti-biofilm effect was further confirmed using a dna-quantification method which specifically quantified the dna present in different v. harveyi biofilms. dna quantification results showed the same trend of inhibitory action for hu-210: biofilm in the mutant strain bb <dig> was dose-dependently inhibited by up to 80 % , whereas there was no significant decrease in the amount of dna present in wild-type bb <dig> and mutant mm <dig> biofilms.fig.  <dig> dna quantification by qpcr. comparison of quantified dna of v. harveyi bb <dig> , mm <dig>  and bb <dig>  biofilm formed with or without different concentrations of hu- <dig>  presented data are means and sd of three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate.*p <  <dig>  compared with control



biofilm depth, bacterial viability and presence of extracellular polysaccharides 
to further evaluate the effect of hu- <dig> on biofilm formation by v. harveyi, we analyzed the morphology of the biofilms generated by the v. harveyi wild type bb <dig>  and mutants mm <dig>  and bb <dig>  using confocal laser scanning microscopy . the depth of the biofilms formed by the wild type and mutant strain mm <dig> was least affected by the addition of hu- <dig>  however biofilms formed by mutant bb <dig> in control samples  were more confluent  than those formed in the presence of hu- <dig> , and showed a gradual decrease in average depth with increasing concentrations of hu- <dig> .fig.  <dig> analysis of v. harveyi biofilms by clsm.  comparison of biofilm depth of v. harveyi bb <dig> , mm <dig>  and bb <dig>  formed with or without different concentrations of hu- <dig>  presented data are means and sd of three independent experiments.*p <  <dig>  compared with control.  v. harveyi bb <dig> , mm <dig>  and bb <dig>  biofilms grown with or without hu- <dig>  and stained with syto  <dig> dye , which stains live bacteria, and with concanavalin a–alexa fluor  <dig> conjugates , which stain extracellular polysaccharides. biofilm depth of v. harveyi bb <dig> , mm <dig>  and bb <dig>  biofilms in control  is 85 μm, 80 μm ,95 μm and in samples with hu- <dig>  is 80 μm, 85 μm, 55 μm respectively



the amount of eps was normalized to live cells in the biofilm, and we observed less eps in biofilms formed by all tested v. harveyi strains in the presence of hu- <dig> vs. controls. however, the decrease was only significant for mutant strain bb <dig>  where up to 75 % less eps was measured in the presence of 200 μg/ml hu- <dig> vs. controls. bacterial cell viability in the biofilms was not significantly affected by hu- <dig> in any of the tested v. harveyi strains .table  <dig> analysis of biofilms formed by v. harveyi strains in the presence/absence of hu-210

effect of hu- <dig> on swimming motility of v. harveyi
swimming motility assays were performed with wild-type strain bb <dig> and mutant strains mm <dig> and bb <dig>  a significant decrease  in swimming motility was observed in all three strains in the presence of the highest tested concentration of hu- <dig> . this effect of hu- <dig> was most evident in mutant strain bb <dig>  as it interfered with swimming motility at lower concentrations as well  . in both the wild-type strain bb <dig> and the mutant strain bb <dig>  the observed reduction in swimming motility was dose-dependent , whereas in mutant strain mm <dig>  up to 95 % inhibition was observed at the highest hu- <dig> concentration tested .fig.  <dig> comparison of swimming motility of v. harveyi bb <dig> , mm <dig>  and bb <dig>  with different concentrations of hu- <dig> quantified using image j software. presented data are means and sd of two independent experiments 



effect of hu- <dig> on mrna levels of different genes involved in qs regulation
the molecular basis of the inhibitory action of hu- <dig> on qs and biofilm formation in v. harveyi mutant strain bb <dig> was investigated. we quantified mrna levels of six genes which had been previously found to be regulated by the ai-1- and ai-2-dependent qs in vibrio. genes specific to the ai- <dig> qs cascade—luxs, luxp and luxq—were downregulated in the presence of 2 μg/ml hu- <dig> in wild-type bb <dig> and mutant bb <dig>  whereas genes specific to the ai- <dig> cascade—luxm and luxn—were upregulated in wild-type bb <dig> and mutant strain mm <dig>  significant downregulation of ai- <dig> synthase luxs and master regulator luxr was only observed in mutant strain bb <dig> treated with hu- <dig> . results suggested that hu- <dig> can inhibit qs through the ai- <dig> cascade by inhibiting the production of ai- <dig> signal molecules through luxs. furthermore, decreased expression of luxp and luxq in mutant strain bb <dig> also suggested that the mechanism of action proceeds through these hybrid sensor kinases. as an outcome, there was less expression of luxr—the master regulator of qs target genes—resulting in suppressed activity of the ai-2-mediated qs cascade present in mutant strain bb <dig>  this could also explain the specific inhibitory effect of hu- <dig> on bioluminescence, biofilm-forming ability and swimming motility of mutant strain bb <dig> observed throughout the study.table  <dig> relative mrna expression of different genes in v. harveyi

discussion
bacteria communicate via qs using extracellular chemical signaling molecules. ai- <dig> used for qs signaling is found in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. recent studies have focused on finding small molecules analogous to ais which can alter qs-regulated pathogenic behaviors and biofilm formation in bacteria  <cit> . the action of cannabinoids on microbes and viruses has been documented  <cit> . however their effect on bacterial qs pathways is unknown.

v. harveyi is one of the best-characterized model organisms for the study of qs  <cit> . therefore, we investigated the effect of the potent synthetic cannabinoid hu- <dig> on qs-regulated bioluminescence, biofilm formation and swimming motility of v. harveyi strains. further research on cannabinoid–bacteria interactions will involve exploring more derivatives and their effects on other types of bacteria.

our study focused mainly on the effect of hu- <dig> on qs-mediated pathways at concentrations below the minimum inhibitory concentration . growth of v. harveyi strains was unaffected at all tested concentrations  of hu- <dig>  in experiments with v. harveyi wild-type strain bb <dig> and mutant strains bb <dig> and mm <dig>  hu- <dig> only significantly reduced bioluminescence of the mutant strain bb <dig>  strain bb <dig> is a hai- <dig> synthase mutant and inhibition of its bioluminescence by hu- <dig> led us to postulate that this synthetic cannabinoid acts on the ai- <dig> mediated qs cascade. using the bioluminescence reporter strain bb <dig> , we were able to address the specific inhibitory action of hu- <dig> on ai- <dig>  the mutant bb <dig>  was incubated simultaneously with different doses of hu- <dig> and exogenous ai- <dig> and assessed for further effects of hu- <dig>  interestingly, exogenous ai- <dig> reversed hu- <dig> inhibition, indicating complementation by exogenous ai- <dig> for the dose-dependent effect of hu- <dig>  except in samples with the highest tested hu- <dig> concentration . this could be because at the highest concentration , hu- <dig> strongly inhibited ai- <dig> activity  in bb <dig> and the observed bioluminescence production was due only to the excess exogenous ai- <dig> available at the time.

the plant kingdom is a well-known source of medicines, including numerous antimicrobial agents. several other quorum-quenching molecules have been isolated from plants  <cit> . for example, the plant constituent curcumin was recently shown to interfere with qs-mediated bioluminescence production in v. harveyi  <cit> . similarly, extracts of garlic have been shown to block qs of pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> , and vanilla extracts are capable of interfering with qs in chromobacterium violaceum  <cit> .

previous studies have confirmed that biofilm formation is one of the primary attributes toward bacterial pathogenicity and that it is partially controlled by qs  <cit> . results of the present study suggest that hu- <dig> at the tested concentrations significantly inhibited the biofilm-forming capability of v. harveyi mutant strain bb <dig> . the amount of total biomass in the biofilm, determined by cv staining and dna quantification, decreased with increasing concentration of hu- <dig>  since the inhibitory action of hu- <dig> was more prominent in the mutant strain bb <dig>  than in the other tested v. harveyi strains, hu- <dig> seems to interfere with the ai-2-dependent qs pathway, resulting in less qs and ultimately less biofilm formation. results of the current study are consistent with previous observations made in vibrio spp. wherein a pytochemical, resveratrol significantly reduced total biofilm bimoass  <cit> .

the anti-biofilm effect of hu- <dig> was further confirmed by clsm observation of biofilm architecture, showing a significant decrease in the depth of the biofilm formed by mutant bb152; however, there was no such effect on biofilm formed by wild-type strain bb <dig> or mutant strain mm <dig>  the average thickness of the biofilm formed by these strains remained almost the same in hu-210-treated and untreated samples. the substantial reduction in biofilm thickness for strain bb <dig> was comparable to the result of a study in which s6- <dig>  an extract from the marine bacterium bacillus pumilus, was shown to be effective against biofilm formation in a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria  <cit> .

bacterial motility is an important virulence factor in many pathogens. some vibrio spp.  possess dual flagellar systems that are suited to movement under different conditions  <cit> . a recent study reported that qs enhances flagellar motility in pathogenic v. harveyi  <cit> . to further investigate the effect of hu- <dig> on qs, we checked its possible impact on swimming motility of v. harveyi. the results indicated an inhibitory effect of hu- <dig> on qs via its restrictive effect on the motility of the wild type as well as mutant strains bb <dig> and mm <dig>  observations from this study fall in line with another study in which curcumin was shown to affect swimming motility of v. harveyi  <cit> .

biofilm formation is a developmental process due to changes in the structural and regulatory genes required at various steps of its formation . to unveil the molecular basis of v. harveyi bb <dig> bioluminescence and biofilm inhibition by hu- <dig>  we measured differential expression of genes regulating qs-phenotypes in the presence and absence of hu- <dig>  in v. harveyi, the ai-2-mediated qs system is composed of luxs, luxp and luxq. luxs is responsible for the synthesis of ai- <dig>  <cit> . luxp is a periplasmic protein that binds ai- <dig>  and luxq is a hybrid sensor kinase. lux r is the master regulator of all three parallel qs systems in v. harveyi  <cit> . we observed less expression of luxs, luxp, luxq and luxr in mutant strain bb <dig> treated with hu- <dig>  suggesting that this cannabinoid interferes with ai- <dig> production, as well as with reception of these qs signals by sensor kinases, resulting in lower activity of luxr and less activation of qs target genes. this notion is in agreement with several other reports showing disruption of qs-regulated gene expression in v. harveyi by halogenated furanone  <cit> .

it has been reported that three qs systems work in parallel, based on a coincidence detection scheme, to regulate different genes' expression in v. harveyi  <cit> . we noticed that luxm  and luxn  in wild-type bb <dig> as well as in mutant strain mm <dig> were upregulated in the presence of 2 μg/ml hu- <dig>  it has been recently shown that in a growing wild-type v. harveyi culture, ai- <dig> synthesis is quickly followed by that of hai- <dig>  <cit> . based on this knowledge, it becomes evident that the observed limited effect of hu- <dig> on wild-type bb <dig> bioluminescence and biofilm formation is a result of the coincidence detection scheme in which ai- <dig> of bb <dig>  complements the qs system when ai- <dig> activity is interfered with by hu- <dig> 

the present study is the first report on the effect of a cannabinoid on qs-mediated processes, namely bioluminescence, biofilm formation and swimming motility of a bacterial species. the inhibitory action of hu- <dig> was found to proceed through ai- <dig> and it was the result of altered expression of genes involved in the ai- <dig> qs cascade. ai- <dig> is known as the "universal autoinducer" and interference in its activity opens a broad spectrum of applications for synthetic cannabinoids in future research with prokaryotes. further investigations need to be carried out to establish the molecular aspects and mode of action of cannabinoids' effects on qs.

CONCLUSIONS
the synthetic cannabinoid hu- <dig> has an inhibitory effect on qs and qs-dependent properties, such as bioluminescence, biofilm formation and swimming motility of v. harveyi, without affecting its growth. furthermore, hu-210's effect was found to proceed through the ai-2-mediated qs cascade. results of the present study suggest a novel mode of action for synthetic cannabinoids on bacteria via the bacterial communication system, and potential use of cannabinoids as anti-qs agents.
