BACKGROUND
helicobacter pylori infection is considered a major factor inducing chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer, and even gastric cancer in humans  <cit> . in mice and human studies, the gastric mucosa of h. pylori-infected subjects show up-regulated nf-κb pathway and th <dig> type cytokine responses  <cit> , which may disturb the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier  <cit> . accordingly, the inactivation of the nf-κb pathway and its downstream immune cascades may be helpful in preventing serious h. pylori-induced complications.

probiotics are known to inhibit enteric pathogens likes salmonella, shigella, and citrobacter rodentium in both in vitro and animal models  <cit> . their potential clinical benefits in preventing or resolving gastrointestinal diseases have been emphasized  <cit> . there are several mechanisms through which they provide gut protection, including decreasing the luminal ph value by producing lactic acid  <cit>  or by competing with gut pathogens for host surface receptors  <cit> .

nonetheless, coconnier et al. have shown that probiotics may inhibit h. pylori growth independent of ph and lactic acid levels  <cit>  while tien et al. report that lactobacillus casei may down-regulate shigella flexneri-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and adherence molecules by inhibiting the nf-κb pathway  <cit> . another critical mechanism involving probiotics relates to changes in host immune responses to infection via reduced tnf-α and il- <dig> but increased il- <dig>  <cit> . regarding the brief contact between the flora of probiotics and the gastric epithelium, an intake of probiotics by h. pylori-infected patients has anti-inflammation benefits resulting from a change in host immune responses.

transforming growth factor -β <dig> negatively regulates th <dig> cell such that tgf-β1/deficient mice spontaneously develop gastritis  <cit> . it is well accepted that the tgf-β <dig> signaling pathway is positively regulated by receptor-associated smad 2/ <dig>  but negatively by smad <dig>  <cit> . h. pylori infection is reportedly associated with increased expression of gastric smad <dig>  but controversial results in tgf-β <dig> levels  <cit> . these suggest that the tgf-β1/smad signaling pathway plays an important role in gut inflammation. however, the exact mechanism of probiotics reducing h. pylori-induced gastric inflammation remains unclear. thus, this study aimed to examine whether probiotics could regulate the smad- and nfκb-mediated signaling pathways to reduce the down-stream inflammatory cytokine production after h. pylori infection.

methods
cell lines and culture condition
this study was approved by the ethical committee of national cheng kung university hospital . two human gastric epithelial cancer cell lines  were obtained from the health science research resources bank in japan and maintained in rpmi  <dig>  medium  and f- <dig> medium  containing 10% fbs at 37°c in a humidified atmosphere  with 5% co <dig>  the cells were sub-cultured every second day. prior to the bacterial infection study, the cells were incubated in antibiotic-free rpmi  <dig>  medium containing 10% fbs overnight at 37°c in 5% co <dig> 

bacteria and culture condition
bacterial strain  isolated from a clinical patient was used. the hp <dig> expressed caga, vaca, and baba proteins in previous studies  <cit> . the bacteria were maintained on a brucella agar plate containing 10% horse serum and incubated under micro-aerophilic conditions  for 24- <dig> hours. the bacteria were then transferred to pbs before infecting the cells. growth density was measured spectrophotometrically at  <dig> nm. the infectious dose of bacteria was  <dig> ×  <dig> bacteria/ml at an od of  <dig> 

the mkn <dig> cells were infected with a multiplicity of infection  1- <dig> for various time periods. a probiotic strain, one contained in ab-yogurt, lactobacillus acidophilus  was used. the bacteria were maintained on a brucella agar, incubated in anaerobic conditions, and then harvested and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline  before infection. the viable density of l. acidophilus was  <dig> ×  <dig> bacteria/ml at an od of  <dig> 

mkn <dig> cells viability after exposure to h. pylori and l. acidophilus
the cytotoxicity of mkn <dig> cell exposure to h. pylori and l. acidophilus was determined by percentage of lactate dehydrogenase  leakage  and by assessing viable cell counts using non-stained trypan blue. the culture supernatant and remaining mkn <dig> cells were collected after incubation with variable doses  of l. acidophilus and h. pylori  for  <dig> and  <dig> hours, respectively. cell cultures without bacterial infection served as controls. the procedures were performed according to the instruction manuals and post-infection cells with non-stained trypan blue staining were directly counted.

enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay  for cytokines
to determine the optimal dose and incubation time of various bacteria, bacteria  were cultured with mkn <dig> cells  in an antibiotic-free rpmi  <dig>  medium  containing 10% fbs at 35°c in micro-aerophilic conditions for up to  <dig> hours. in the experimental study, l. acidophilus were added to mkn <dig> cells and incubated for  <dig> hours under the same conditions. after pbs washing and removal of the bacilli, an equal volume of h. pylori was added and the cells were incubated for another  <dig> hours. the final culture supernatant was centrifuged at  <dig>  rpm for  <dig> min to remove bacteria and cell debris. concentrations of tnf-α, il- <dig> , and tgf-β <dig>  were measured by elisa according to the manufacturer's instructions. the absorbance of each micro-plate was read on a spectro-photometer using  <dig> nm as the primary wave length and  <dig> nm as the reference wave length. all tests were done in triplicate.

preparation of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts
the mkn <dig> and ags cells were pre-treated with l. acidophilus for  <dig> hours followed by various doses of h. pylori for  <dig> hour; then cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were isolated by a nuclear extract kit . briefly, cells were washed with ice-cold saline containing phosphatase inhibitors and pelleted. the cell pellets were then re-suspended in a hypotonic buffer and incubated for  <dig> min on ice. they were lysed by the addition of detergent and vortexed vigorously for  <dig> s. after the nuclei were pelleted and re-suspended in complete lysis buffer, the tube was vigorously shaken at 4°c for  <dig> min on a shaking platform. the nuclear extracts were then centrifuged and the supernatants were aliquoted and stored at -80°c.

rt-pcr for cytoplasmic smad7
total rna was isolated from mkn <dig> cells using a commercial kit  after h. pylori and l. acidophilus incubation. the rna was quantified by determining absorbance at  <dig> nm. one μg rna was converted to cdna, which was stored at -72°c until use. the human smad <dig> primer sequences were forward 5'-catcaccttagccgactctg-3' and reverse 5'gtcttctcctcccagtatgc-3', generating a  <dig> bp fragment  <cit> . for jak <dig> and stat <dig>  the primer sequences were forward 5'-gcagccagcatgatgaga-3' and 5'-gtggacgaggttttgtaagga-3' and reverse 5'-ctcggaagaaaggcctctg-3' and 5'-cagacacagaaatcaactc-3', generating fragments of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, respectively  <cit> . the pcr condition was as follows; 95°c for  <dig> min, followed by  <dig> cycle of 95°c for  <dig> min, 56°c for  <dig> min, and 72°c for  <dig> min, and finally 72°c for  <dig> min. the primer sequences for human β-actin was forward 5'-gtcttcccctccatcgtg-3' and reverse 5'-gtcatcttctcgcggttg-3', generating a  <dig> bp fragment. the amplification conditions were as follows: 95°c for  <dig> min, then a  <dig> cycle of 95°c for  <dig> min, 50°c for  <dig> min, 72°c for  <dig> min, and 72°c for  <dig> min.

western blotting for nf-κb, iκb-α and smad7
interferon gamma    <dig> μl  was added to each dish in the experimental studies. the cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were washed with ice-cold pbs and lysed in a  <dig>  ml/well lysis buffer  as modified from the reports of kim et al. and moon et al.  <cit> . protein concentrations in the lysates were determined using the pierce bca protein assay kit . protein/lane  <dig> μg was then size-fractionated into a denaturing, non-reducing 10% polyacrylamide minigel and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride   .

specific proteins were detected using rabbit antihuman nf-κb p <dig>  rabbit anti-human iκb-α , and mouse anti-human smad <dig>  as primary antibodies, and peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit igg, anti-mouse igg  as a secondary antibody. specifically bound peroxidase was detected by chemiluminescent hrp substrate  and then exposed to x-ray  for 10- <dig> s.

statistical analysis
the student's t test and paired t test were used, as appropriate, for parametric differences. one-way analysis of variance  with bonferroni's correction was applied for the multiple testing of data. the mann-whitney u test was used for the difference between non-parametric data while pearson's χ <dig> test was used for non-parametric proportion difference. all tests were two-tailed and a p <  <dig>  was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
cell viability after incubation with h. pylori and l. acidophilus
the cytotoxicity and viability of mkn <dig> cells incubated with h. pylori  and l. acidophilus  were determined by assessing the percentage leakage of ldh and non-stained trypan blue at the 4th and 8th hours, respectively . plasma membrane damage assessed by the percentage of ldh leakage from mkn <dig> after h. pylori incubation  was not different to those of control cells . moreover, the viable cell count calculated by non-stained trypan blue did not markedly decrease. when l. acidophilus was incubated with mkn <dig> cells for  <dig> hours, the cytotoxicity and viable cell count at moi 1- <dig> were not significantly affected. however, ldh leakage and cell death slightly increased as incubation with moi  <dig>  for  <dig> hours. therefore, the optimal dose of bacteria used for the experimental study was limited to moi  <dig> 

aall cytotoxicity data were presented with mean value of three tests

h. pylori stimulated il- <dig> and tnf-α but not tgf-β <dig> production in vitro
in mkn <dig> cells incubated with h. pylori  at various time periods, the il- <dig> level increased from the 4th to the 8th hour after co-incubation, as determined by elisa . for tnf-α, the post-incubation level rose after the 4th hour and maintained a plateau until the 8th hour . however, the tgf-β <dig> level did not increase after h. pylori incubation for  <dig> hours .

in contrast, l. acidophilus did not induce il- <dig>  tnf-α, and tgf-β <dig> expressions of mkn <dig> at least within the 8-hour co-incubation period.

pre-treatment of l. acidophilus attenuated h. pylori-induced il-8
because the il- <dig> level of mkn <dig> cells could be induced by h. pylori challenge for  <dig> hours, the time- and dose-dependent effects of probiotics in reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and tgf-β <dig> on the 4th hour were studied. the il- <dig> and tgf-β <dig> concentrations were shown for mkn cells challenged by h. pylori and with variable doses of l. acidophilus pretreatment for  <dig> hours . compared to the control group, l. acidophilus pre-treatment with higher bacterial colony count  reduced h. pylori-induced il- <dig> expressions in mkn <dig> cells . the tgf-β <dig> level did not change .

l. acidophilus reduced h. pylori-induced nf-κb by increasing iκbα
the study determined that mkn <dig> cells  incubated with h. pylori led to a peak increase of nuclear nf-κb production within one hour. thus, nuclear nf-κb levels of mkn <dig> cells co-incubated with h. pylori, after prior pre-treatments by various mois  of l. acidophilus were tested for anti-inflammatory effects of probiotics. pre-treatment of l. acidophilus increased cytoplasmic iκbα but decreased the nuclear nf-κb levels induced by h. pylori in a dose-dependent manner . because iκbα level could be mediated by activating the tgf-β1/smad signaling pathway, the role smad <dig> played in l. acidophilus restoring tgf-β1/smad activity after h. pylori challenge was tested.

l. acidophilus inhibited h. pylori-and ifn-γ-induced smad <dig> expression
the figure 4a shows that pre-treatment with high-dose l. acidophilus  for  <dig> h prevented h. pylori-induced smad <dig> production by semi-quantitative rt-pct. compared to positive controls , l. acidophilus pretreatment as high as moi  <dig> significantly reduced the h. pylori-induced smad <dig> production at the rna level  via inactivation of jak <dig> and stat <dig> transcriptions. l. acidophilus pre-treatment also inhibited the expression of ifn-γ-induced smad <dig> protein  in vitro, with a subsequent increase in cytoplasmic iκbα  and a decrease in nuclear nf-κb  .

discussion
human immunity plays an important role in the development of more serious clinical diseases after h. pylori infection because of increased pro-inflammatory cytokine expressions on the patients' gastric mucosa  <cit> . h. pylori infection can activate nf-κb in gastric epithelium cells and subsequently up-regulate il- <dig> gene transcription  <cit> . consistent with previous human studies  <cit> , the present study reveals that h. pylori infection can induce tnf-α and il- <dig> pro-inflammatory cytokine expressions in vitro. in agreement with the animal study reported by mccarthy et al.  <cit> , the present study illustrates that yogurt-containing probiotics, l. acidophilus does not stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokines after an 8-hour incubation with mkn <dig> cells. this suggests that probiotics can exert anti-inflammatory effects in vitro. accordingly, it will be interesting to test how the inflammatory cascades can be counteracted by probiotics.

the antimicrobial activity of lactobacillus against enteric pathogens is, in part, due to the accumulation of lactic acid  <cit> . the ability of lactic acid production varies in the lactobacillus spp. and l. acidophilus is a low lactic acid-production strain  <cit> . experimentally, l. acidophilus decreases the viability of h. pylori in vitro independent of ph and lactic acid levels  <cit> . the ph value of each suspension in this study is around  <dig> - <dig>  . other mechanisms like immuno-modulation should therefore contribute largely to the anti-inflammatory effects of l. acidophilus.

the current study demonstrates that l. acidophilus pre-treatment can decrease the h. pyloriinduced nuclear nf-κb expression in the 1st hour and il- <dig> in the 4th hour, after co-culture with h. pylori and mkn <dig> cells. furthermore, the tnf-α level is also decreased although its value is quite low . this study further confirms that such suppression occurs in a dose-dependent manner and is mediated through the stabilization of iκbα. the finding is compatible with the results of tien et al. showing that anti-inflammatory effects can only be achieved at an adequate bacteria count in probiotics  <cit> . data from the present study indicate that l. acidophilus can counteract h. pylori-induced gastric inflammation specifically by mediation through the iκbα/nf-κb pathway in a dose-dependent manner.

in normal intestinal mucosal cells, the tgf-β <dig> signal may negatively regulate nf-κb activation by stimulating the negative regulator, iκbα  <cit> . h. pylori infection reportedly may inhibit the tgf-β <dig> signal pathway via activation of the gastric smad <dig> expression  <cit> . this study also declares that both h. pylori and l. acidophilus do not affect the tgf-β <dig> production of gastric epithelial cells, which again confirm that l. acidophilus regulates tgfβ1/smad <dig> downstream activity by restoring smad <dig>  the present study is the first to demonstrate that l. acidophilus can down-regulate smad <dig> production to restore the tgfβ1/smad activity and to ameliorate the h. pylori-induced gastric inflammation in vitro .

smad <dig> can also be induced in normal gastric specimens by ifn-γ through a stat <dig> dependent pathway  <cit> . in fact, the gastric epithelium does not secret ifn-γ. therefore, h. pylori  and l. acidophilus  both significantly regulates smad <dig> in epithelium cells through the mediation of the stat1-dependent smad <dig> pathway. inhibiting smad <dig> can restore the tgf-β1/smad <dig> signaling and result in the suppression of inflammatory cytokine production in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases  <cit> . the data here reveals that probiotics contained in yogurt can inhibit smad <dig> to diminish h. pylorirelated gastric inflammation. such probiotics can be quite promising for the improvement of h. pylori infection control.

CONCLUSIONS
yogurt-containing l. acidophilus can improve h. pylori-induced gastric inflammation through the inactivation of the smad <dig> and nf-κb mediated pathways. intake of l. acidophilus-containing yogurt may improve gastric inflammation in h. pylori-infected patients.
