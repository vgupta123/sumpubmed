BACKGROUND
hiv- <dig> tat-interacting protein of  <dig> kda , also known as squamous cell carcinoma antigen recognized by t cells  <dig> , was initially identified from a human myeloid cell line kg- <dig> cdna library in 1995
 <cit> . several important biological functions have been attributed to this gene/protein since its identification. a considerably elevated level of tip <dig> is detected in a variety of human cancers
 <cit> , it has been proposed as a tumor antigen for immunotherapy. in addition, tip <dig> binds to small nuclear rna u <dig> and regulates eukaryotic pre-mrna splicing . it also preferentially regulates the inclusion of exon 1a and skipping of exon 1b of the oct <dig> gene
 <cit> . alteration of splicing components induced by a mutation in early grey, a tip <dig> orthrologue in zebrafish leads to organ-specific defects and embryonic death
 <cit> , suggesting an important role of tip <dig> in development. furthermore, tip <dig> is directly involved in expression regulation of viral and host genes including hiv- <dig>  androgen receptor, and stem cell factors cymc, gata- <dig>  nanog, and sox2
 <cit> . lastly, tip <dig> is shown to interact with ubiquitin-specific peptidases  such as usp <dig> and regulate protein degradation
 <cit> . it is clear that our understanding of tip <dig> biological function is still rapidly evolving.

to further understand the biological function of tip <dig>  we wished to begin by identifying potential cellular proteins that interacted with tip <dig>  we took the immunoaffinity-based enrichment approach, followed by protein mass spectrometry. we isolated a total of  <dig> tip110-binding proteins. among them was y-box binding protein  <dig> . in this study, we characterized tip110/yb- <dig> interaction and its impacts on each other’s function.

methods
cell culture and transfection 293t cells were purchased from american tissue culture collection  and grown in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. the cell line was maintained in  <dig> iu/ml penicillin- <dig> μg/ml streptomycin and incubated at 37°c in 5% co <dig>  cells were transfected using the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method. the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase  reporter gene assay was performed as described previously
 <cit> .

plasmids construction of ptip110-his, ptip110-ha, Δct, Δrrm, Δnt, Δnls, ptip110-gfp, ptat-myc plasmids have been described elsewhere
 <cit> . the pcd <dig> minigene plasmid was generously provided by dr. stefan stamm of university of kentucky, lexington, ky). the full length yb- <dig> cdna  and the deletion mutants pyb-1Δc  and pyb-1Δn  were generated by standard pcr techniques and inserted into the mammalian expression plasmid pcmv-myc by using the psport6-yb- <dig> plasmid as a template. primers were for pyb-1-myc: 5′-atc cga gat cta tag cag cga ggc cga gac-3′ and 5′-aat acc tcg agt tac tca gcc ccg ccc tgc tc-3′; for pyb-1Δc: 5′-atc cga gat cta tag cag cga ggc cga gac-3′ and 5′-aat acc tcg agt taa gga cct gta aca ttt gct gc-3′; for pyb-1Δn: 5′-atc cga gat cta tgg tgg tgt tcc agt tca agg-3′ and 5′-aat acc tcg agt tac tca gcc ccg ccc tgc tc-3′. respective bgl ii and xho i restriction sites in the primers were italicized.

mass spectrometry 293t cells were mock or ptip110-ha transfected. at  <dig> hr post-transfection, the cells were lysed with wceb buffer  and applied to the anti-ha affinity matrix column . the column was washed with  <dig> bed-volumes, using washing buffer  and then incubated at 37°c with elution buffer containing ha peptide  for  <dig> min. a portion of the elutes was mixed with 4× sds-page loading buffer and then resolved by 10% sds-page, and the remaining elutions were analyzed by lc-ms/ms on a waters q-tof ultima mass spectrometer at the yale cancer center mass spectroscopy and w.m. keck foundation and biotechnology, followed by an automated mascot algorithm against the ncbi database.

immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis 293t cells were transfected with plasmids as indicated and harvested  <dig> hr post transfection. the cells were lysed in wceb lysis buffer. lysates were cleared of cell debris by centrifugation. antibodies  were added to the lysates and incubated at 4°c on a rotating device for  <dig> hr, and protein a agarose beads  were added to precipitate the complex. pelleted beads were washed and suspended in 4× sds loading buffer, boiled and used for sds-page. the proteins were transferred onto the hybond-p membrane . the membrane was probed with primary antibodies and the appropriate peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody, then visualized with an ecl system.

cd <dig> minigene splicing assay 293t cells were plated on 6-well plates and grown to 60-70% confluence and then transfected with the pcd44-v <dig> splicing reporter, ptip110-ha, pyb- <dig> or pyb- <dig> mutant plasmids. at  <dig> hr post transfection, total rna was isolated using trizol , followed by acid:phenol extraction to prevent residual dna from being used as a pcr template. total rna  was used for reverse transcriptase -pcr using the titan one tube rt-pcr system  and primers 5′-gag gga tcc gct cct gcc cc-3′ and 5′-ctc ccg ggc cac ctc cag tgc c-3′ and a program of  <dig> cycles of 94°c for 60s, 61°c for 60s, and 72°c for 90s. the rt-pcr products were separated on a 1% agarose gel.

data analysis where appropriate, values were expressed as mean ± sd of triplicate experiments. all comparisons were made based on the control using two-tailed student’s t-test. a p value of <  <dig>  was considered statistically significant , p <  <dig>  highly significant  and p <  <dig>  strongly significant . all data were representative of multiple repeated experiments.

RESULTS
identification of tip110-interacting proteins
to identify tip110-interacting protein, 293t cells were transfected with ptip110-ha plasmid. cell lysates were prepared and passed through a ha-affinity column. following extensive washes, the bound proteins were eluted and fractionated on the sds-page. in parallel, cell lysates from pcdna3-transfected cells were also included. coomassie blue staining revealed several protein bands whose intensity differed between samples from tip110-ha and pcdna <dig> . those proteins were recovered for mass spectrometric identification. besides the bait protein tip <dig> itself, there were  <dig> major proteins identified . those included cytoskeletal proteins, heat shock proteins, ribonucleoproteins, skin proteins and two ungrouped protein importin-2α and y box binding protein  <dig> . the interactions of tip <dig> with all of those proteins were further examined and confirmed by immunoprecipitation followed by western blot analysis . in the study, we chose to focus on yb- <dig> protein, as yb- <dig> and tip <dig> appear to possess several similar functions. first, both tip <dig> and yb- <dig> protein bind to rna and are involved in post-transcriptional regulation such as pre-mrna splicing
 <cit> . second, both tip <dig> and yb- <dig> are highly expressed in some cancers
 <cit> . third, both tip <dig> and yb- <dig> interact with hiv- <dig> tat protein and regulate hiv- <dig> gene expression. lastly, both tip <dig> and yb- <dig> are regulated by transcription factor c-myc
 <cit> . thus, all these observations imply that tip <dig> forms complex with yb- <dig> and regulate each other’s function and suggest potential physiological significance of this interaction.

the proteins were organized into groups based on their functions.

tip <dig> interacted with yb- <dig> and its molecular determinants
to confirm tip <dig> interaction with yb- <dig>  293t cells were transfected with ptip110-ha, pyb-1-myc, or both. western blot analysis using anti-ha or anti-myc antibody showed that both tip <dig> and yb- <dig> were expressed in 293t cells . immunoprecipitation of cell lyastes using anti-ha antibody, followed by western blotting with anti-myc or anti-ha antibody showed that yb- <dig> was detected in the tip110-immunoprecipitates only when tip110-ha and myc-yb- <dig> were co-expressed . immunoprecipitation and western blotting were performed with the very same antibody to ensure the immnoprecipitation efficiency of the antibody. similar experiments were also performed with 293t cells transfected with ptip110-ha only. endogenous yb- <dig> was also detected in the tip110-immunoprecipitates of tip110-ha expression cells, but not present with the isotype igg-immunoprecipitates . those results suggest that tip <dig> complexed with yb- <dig> in vivo.

to further determine the specificity of the interaction, we took advantage of a series of tip <dig> mutants that contained deletions of the n-terminal hat-domain , rrm domain , nls domain , and the c-terminal domain  
 <cit> . 293t cells were transfected with ptip110-ha or each of the tip <dig> mutants. tip <dig> and its mutants were expressed at the expected molecular weights . immunoprecipitation with anti-yb- <dig> antibody, followed by western blot analysis using anti-tip <dig> antibody showed detection of tip <dig>  Δct, Δrrm and Δnls, but not Δnt in the yb- <dig> immunoprecipitates . similarly, we performed binding experiments of tip <dig> to deletion mutants of yb- <dig> lacking the n-terminal  or the c-terminal domains   and found that deletion of the n-terminal domain of yb- <dig>  prevented its complex formation with tip <dig> . taken together, these results further confirmed the complex formation between tip <dig> and yb- <dig>  and suggest that the n-terminal domains of both tip <dig> and yb- <dig> are directly involved in the complex formation.

yb- <dig> modulated tip110/tat-mediated transactivation of the hiv- <dig> ltr promoter
tip <dig> interacts with the hiv- <dig> tat viral protein and transactivates the hiv- <dig> ltr promoter
 <cit> . thus, we chose a ltr promoter-driven reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase  to determine the effects of yb- <dig> expression on this unique tip <dig> function. initial experiments were performed to optimize the input amounts of ltr-cat, tat, tip <dig> and yb- <dig> expression plasmids to achieve a lower level of basal level ltr promoter activity and a modest level of tat transactivation activity on the ltr promoter . we then transfected 293t cells with ltr-cat, tat, tip <dig> and/or increasing amounts of yb- <dig> expression plasmids. pcdna <dig> was used to equalize the total amount of dna transfected, while pc3-gfp was included in the transfections to normalize the transfection variations. as expected
 <cit> , tip <dig> or yb- <dig> expression increased tat-mediated transactivation of the ltr promoter activity . in the presence of tip <dig>  increased yb- <dig> expression led to further increase in the tat-mediated ltr promoter activity. to further determine the relationship between the complex formation of tip <dig> with yb- <dig> and yb- <dig> effects on tip110/tat-mediated transactivation of the ltr promoter, we performed similar experiments with both yb-1Δn and yb-1Δc mutants. yb-1Δc mutant expression led to little cat activity, while yb-1Δn mutant showed similar cat activity as the full-length yb- <dig>  these results suggest that yb- <dig> expression enhanced tip110/tat-mediated transactivation of the ltr promoter and suggest that the complex formation of tip <dig> and yb- <dig> is important for this function. the drastic reduction of the cat activity in cells expressing yb-1Δc to a background level suggests that yb-1Δc may function in a dominant negative fashion.

tip <dig> promoted yb-1-mediated alternative splicing of cd <dig> minigene
one of the well-characterized functions of yb- <dig> is regulation of the alternative splicing of the cd <dig> gene through interaction with the a/c-rich exon enhancer element
 <cit> . therefore, we next determined the effects of tip <dig> on yb-1-mediated cd <dig> alternative splicing. we took advantage of a cd <dig> minigene  and performed in vivo rt-pcr-based splicing assay. initial experiments were performed to optimize the input amount of cd <dig> minigene, yb- <dig> and tip <dig> expression plasmids to ensure the rt-pcr-based detection of the alternative splicing . as expected
 <cit> , yb- <dig> expression led to increased inclusion of the variable exon  <dig>  of the cd <dig> minigene . tip <dig> expression alone appeared to have the similar enhancement effects. in the presence of yb- <dig>  tip <dig> increased inclusion of the v <dig> exon of cd <dig> minigene in a dose-dependent manner. tip <dig> and yb- <dig> expression were determined by western blotting to ensure that tip <dig> expression did not alter yb- <dig> stability . we next determined the requirement of tip <dig> binding to yb- <dig> for this function. similar in vivo splicing assay was performed with tip110Δnt and tip110Δct mutants. compared to the full-length tip <dig>  tip110Δnt and tip110Δct expression alone showed little changes in alternative splicing of the cd <dig> minigene . interestingly, in the presence of yb- <dig>  tip110Δnt also showed little effects, while tip110Δct had considerable increase in v <dig> inclusion of the cd <dig> minigene. these results suggest that tip <dig> binding with yb- <dig> plays some roles in yb- <dig> function.

discussion
in this study, we took the immunoaffinity approach to enrich the tip110-binding proteins and identified those proteins by mass spectrometry. this was followed by further characterization of tip <dig> interaction with yb- <dig>  yb- <dig> effects on tip110-mediated transactivation of the hiv- <dig> ltr promoter and tip <dig> effects on yb-1-mediated alternative splicing of cd <dig> gene. the results showed that tip <dig> bound to yb- <dig> in a specific manner and the interaction mutually regulated each other’s function.

there were a total of  <dig> major cellular tip110-binding proteins, which were grouped according to their function . the group included cytoskeletal proteins, heat shock proteins, ribonucleoproteins, skin proteins and two ungrouped protein importin-2α and yb- <dig>  each of those proteins likely contributes to either known or unknown biological function of tip <dig>  for example, tip <dig> binding to cytoskeletal proteins and skin proteins may be involved in a tip110-related skin keratinization disorder called porokertosis. a mutation in tip <dig> gene has been linked to this disease
 <cit> . it is conceivable that tip <dig> function in rna metabolism including pre-mrna splicing could require its interaction with ribonucleoproteins and heat shock proteins. the interaction of tip <dig> with improtin-2α could also regulate tip <dig> nuclear translocation in different cells and under various physiological conditions. the biological significance of all those interactions clearly warrants further investigation.

we focused on tip110/yb- <dig> interaction in this study. yb- <dig> is a multi-functional protein and plays important roles in transcriptional and translational regulation, dna repair, drug resistance and stress responses to extracellular signals . yb- <dig> has recently been shown to regulate pre-mrna splicing
 <cit> . co-immunoprecipitation studies with tagged proteins and immunoprecipitation of endogenous and exogenous yb- <dig> with overexpressed tip <dig> in 293t cells confirmed this protein-protein interaction . although tip <dig> and yb- <dig> both contain rna binding domains and have been shown to bind to rna, the binding properties of tip <dig> and yb- <dig> to each other were independent of rna, as we showed that rnase a <dig> treatment in the cell lysates and during the immunoprecipitation did not alter their complex formation . the specificity of the binding was further supported by the data obtained from mutagenesis analysis and showed that the n-terminal domains of both tip <dig> and yb- <dig> were involved in the complex formation .

to investigate the functional relevance between the tip <dig> and yb- <dig> interaction, we tested whether this complex formation affects transactivation of the hiv- <dig> ltr promoter and alternative splicing activity. interaction of the hiv- <dig> tat protein with its cognate rna tar is a prerequisite for tat transactivation. tip <dig> and yb- <dig> both interact with hiv- <dig> tat viral protein and potentiate tat transactivation in ltr-driven reporter gene assays
 <cit> . although yb- <dig> has only been shown to bind to the tar region of the hiv-ltr, the synergistic effects of tip <dig> are tar-dependent, as these effects are attenuated by deletion of the tar sequence from the hiv- <dig> ltr promoter. based on these observations, we speculated that the tip110/yb- <dig> complex affected the transactivation of hiv- <dig> ltr promoter activity. the ltr-cat reporter gene assay showed that a fixed concentration of tip <dig> combined with increasing concentrations of yb- <dig> resulted in a further increase in cat activity , indicating that the tip110/yb- <dig> complex modulates hiv- <dig> gene expression. the reporter gene assay with yb- <dig> mutants showed that expression of the yb-1Δc mutant abolished cat activity, while expression of the yb-1Δn mutant enhanced the activation to a greater extent than the full length yb- <dig>  one interesting observation we found during the course of this study was that expression of the yb-1Δc mutant protein has a negative effect on tip <dig> protein expression by western blot , which may explain the decrease in cat activity. furthermore, binding of tat to yb- <dig> has been mapped to amino acids 75– <dig> in yb- <dig>  while the yb-1Δc mutant included amino acids 1– <dig>  therefore, there is a stretch of  <dig> amino acids  that are important for tat binding, that are deleted in the yb-1Δc mutant, which may lead to the observed inhibition of cat activity. additional studies would be required to determine if the yb-1Δc mutant could be utilized to impair tat function and effect hiv- <dig> gene expression.

alternative splicing represents an important nuclear mechanism in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. the role of yb- <dig> protein in the alternative splicing of cd <dig> is well documented in the literature. yb- <dig> binds to a/c-rich exon enhancers and stimulates splicing of the cd <dig> alternative variable exon 4
 <cit> . cd <dig> is essential to the physiological activities of normal cells, but they are also associated with the pathologic activities of cancer cells . pre-mrna from the human cd <dig> gene undergoes extensive alternative splicing within a cassette of at least  <dig> exons
 <cit> . increasing inclusion of these exons has been correlated to cancer and metastasis
 <cit> . here, we utilized a cd <dig> minigene  to determine the physiological function of the tip110/yb- <dig> interaction. our results showed that overexpression of yb- <dig> and tip <dig> together in 293t cells enhanced the inclusion of the variable exon  <dig> from the cd <dig> minigene . furthermore, the n-terminal domain of tip <dig> , which is involved in the interaction with yb- <dig>  had higher alternative splicing activity than the c-terminal domain of tip <dig> . these results demonstrate the physiological significance of tip110/yb- <dig> complex formation on the alternative splicing regulation of cd <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
there are a total of  <dig> cellular proteins that was identified by immunoaffinity purification followed by mass spectrometry. among those is yb- <dig>  complex formation between tip <dig> and yb- <dig> was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and western blotting. both n termini of tip <dig> and yb- <dig> were found to be required for this complex formation. yb- <dig> expression enhanced tip110-mediated transactivation of hiv- <dig> ltr promoter, and tip <dig> expression increased yb-1-mediated cd <dig> pre-mrna alternate splicing.
