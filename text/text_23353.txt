BACKGROUND
xylan represents the second most abundant polysaccharide in the biosphere after cellulose, and therefore is a potential source of sugars for the production of biofuels. complete degradation of xylan to monomeric sugars requires synergistic action of several xylanolytic enzymes. endo- <dig> -β-xylanases  hydrolyze the xylan backbone and β-d-xylosidases  sunder the resulting xylooligomers to free xylose  <cit> . availability of free xylose is immensely important to the overall efficiency of conversion of biomass to biofuels in the fermentation industry.

xylanases have also been suggested to complement the activity of cellulases for the efficient hydrolysis of lignocellulose  <cit> . kumar and wyman  <cit>  reported increased efficiency of cellulases on lignocellulosic biomass after addition of endo-xylanase and β-xylosidase. β-xylosidase degrades xylose oligomers before or during enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass to reduce inhibition on cellulases by xylose oligomers. but under industrial processes, xylose could accumulate to levels that strongly inhibit performance of the catalyst. to overcome this limitation, a xylose-tolerant xylosidase is desirable which can resist high concentrations of the xylose  <cit> . a number of thermostable β-xylosidases are reported from thermophilic and hyperthermophilic bacteria including species of the genera geobacillus, thermoanaerobacter, thermatoga, and thermoanaerobacterium  <cit> . the thermostable enzymes are of interest in industrial processes due to their long shelf lives, compatibility with heat pretreatment, decreased microbial contamination at high temperatures and activity for longer durations  <cit> .

the bacterial β-d-xylosidases mainly belong to glycosyl hydrolase families gh  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  family  <dig> enzymes belong to the largest glycoside hydrolase clan , whose members share a tim-barrel  <dig> structure and a conserved catalytic machinery  <cit> . reports on characterization of gh <dig> family β-xylosidases from thermophilic microorganisms are scarce. in this study, we report the cloning and characterization of gh <dig> thermostable β-xylosidase from geobacillus sp. strain wsucf <dig>  this strain was isolated from samples collected from a compost facility and is an aerobic spore forming thermophile  <cit> .

RESULTS
phylogenetic analysis of wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase
genome sequence of wsucf <dig> revealed several genes encoding glycoside hydrolases. out of  <dig> orfs for carbohydrate metabolism,  <dig> orfs were found to be involved in polysaccharide degradation  <cit> . it was found that the wsucf <dig> genome contained two genes coding for putative β-xylosidases - wp_ <dig>  and wp_ <dig> . the deduced amino acid sequence analysis of these two β-xylosidases using pfam showed homology with that of the gh <dig> and gh <dig> family, respectively. literature shows that there is only one report  <cit>  on the cloning and characterization of a gh <dig> family β-xylosidase from geobacillus spp. therefore, the wp_ <dig> β-xylosidase was selected for further study.

figure  <dig> shows the phylogenetic comparison of the putative wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase amino acid sequence to other β-xylosidases. it shows that the wsucf <dig> enzyme clusters with other gh <dig> family β-xylosidases. within the gh <dig> group, β-xylosidase from wsucf <dig> formed sister clades supported by high bootstrap values with sequences belonging to geobacillus spp. . β-xylosidases from different gh families  made separate clusters on the phylogenetic tree .figure  <dig>

alignment of the amino acid sequences of wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase  revealed  <dig>   <dig>  and 91% identity with gh <dig> β-xylosidases from geobacillus stearothermophilus strain t- <dig> , geobacillus sp. y412mc <dig> , and geobacillus sp. g11mc <dig> , respectively. β-xylosidase from geobacillus thermoleovorans  belonging to gh <dig> family and geobacillus stearothermophilus  belonging to gh <dig> family showed only  <dig> and 33% identity respectively.

expression, purification, and characterization of wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase
for functional analysis, the gene encoding wp_ <dig> β-xylosidase was amplified from the geobacillus sp. strain wsucf <dig> genome. the gene was cloned in the prham™ n-his sumo kan vector, expressed in e. coli, and purified using ni-nta affinity chromatography. sds-page analysis of the purified β-xylosidase showed a prominent band of 58 kda  which was consistent with the predicted mass of the β-xylosidase enzyme. no enzyme activity was detected by zymogram analysis of the 58 kda protein. by omitting the heat treatment prior to electrophoresis, the apparent mass of the prominent protein increased to 230 kda, which displayed β-xylosidase activity in zymogram analysis .figure  <dig>

the recombinant β-xylosidase from wsucf <dig> exhibited activity in a broad range of ph  with optima at  <dig>  . β-xylosidase activity increased linearly when ph was increased from  <dig> to  <dig> , but decreased when ph was further increased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  it retained more than 80% activity in the ph range of  <dig>  -  <dig>  at high ph of  <dig>  and  <dig> , it retained  <dig> and 46% relative activity respectively. effect of different temperatures on wsucf <dig> xylosidase activity is shown in figure 3b. it exhibited maximum activity at temperature of 70°c. the enzyme was active between temperatures of  <dig> to 75°c, with more than 50% relative activity.figure  <dig>

wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase was highly thermostable in the range of 50-70°c . the enzyme was optimally stable at 50°c for 1 day without any loss of activity while about 93% activity was retained after incubation for 9 days. at 60°c, about 99% residual activity was detectable after 1 day of incubation and it lost only 17% of its original activity after incubation for 9 days. the enzyme retained 94% of its original activity after incubation of 1 day at 70°c, with a half-life of 9 days. the effect of the presence of metal ions on enzyme activity was studied . wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase retained its activity in the presence of different metal ions except cu2+ and hg2+. more than 70% activity was retained in the presence of zn2+, co2+, ni2+, ca2+, mn2+, and mg2+ whereas it lost  <dig> and 100% activity in the presence of cu2+ and hg 2+, respectively.figure  <dig>

the kinetic parameters were calculated from lineweaver-burke plots of specific activities at various substrate concentrations . the km and vmax values for wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase with paranitrophenyl- beta-xylopyranoside  were  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  u/mg, respectively. the substrate specificity of the purified wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase was determined using various substrates. wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase was highly active on p-nitrophenyl β-d-xylopyranoside . no specificity was observed for other p-np substrates such as p-nitrophenyl β-d-cellobioside, p-nitrophenyl α-d-xylopyranoside, p-nitrophenyl α-l-arabinofuranoside, and p-nitrophenyl β-d-glucopyranoside . in addition, polysaccharides such as oat-spelt xylan, beechwood xylan, and birchwood xylan did not serve as substrates for wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase.

effect of various xylose concentrations on wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase activity was investigated. results showed that concentrations of up to 50 mm xylose did not have much inhibitory effect. the enzyme retained  <dig> and 66% of its activity with  <dig> and 210 mm xylose concentrations, respectively . when the xylose concentration was increased to 300 mm, the enzyme still retained 50% activity. these data suggest that the wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase is resistant to inhibition from high concentrations of xylose.figure  <dig>

hydrolysis of xylo-oligosaccharides and xylan
thin layer chromatography  results showed that wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase actively hydrolyzed xylo-oligosaccharides . it was found that enzyme was active on all xylo-oligosaccharides and released xylose and the other xylo-oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization <dig> unit smaller than the substrate. for example, after 2 hours of hydrolysis, most of the xylotetraose was converted into smaller units with increase in xylose concentration. in case of xylopentaose hydrolysis, after 6 hours xylotetraose, xylotriose, xylobiose, and xylose were detected. with increase in time of hydrolysis of xylo-oligosaccharides from  <dig> to 6 hours, xylose yields were increased .figure  <dig>

mixtures of recombinant wsucf <dig> endo-xylanase  <cit>  and wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase were utilized to hydrolyze birchwood xylan. it was interesting to note that endo-xylanase alone produced different concentrations of oligosaccharides , but after addition of β-xylosidase, most of these xylo-oligosaccharides were converted to xylose . xylan conversion increased with time. sugar analysis results revealed that mixture of endo-xylanase and β-xylosidase worked efficiently and converted approximately 90% of xylan to xylose.figure  <dig> 
synergistic action of endoxylanase and β-xylosidase on hydrolysis of xylan. twenty mg xylan was incubated with wsucf <dig> endoxylanase  and β-xylosidase  at 60°c for 24 h. yields  is equal to the theoretical maximum concentration of xylose released from xylan. short title: synergistic action of endoxylanase and β-xylosidase on xylan hydrolysis.



discussion
cellulose and hemicellulose components of lignocellulosic biomass are a renewable source of sugars. the main component of hemicellulose is xylan which can be converted into xylose using an effective enzyme system of endo-xylanase and β-xylosidase. β-xylosidase is known to be the key enzyme for converting xylo-oligosaccharides to xylose. thermostable β-xylosidases produced from thermophiles are of importance due to their prolonged activity during the hydrolysis which may allow a reduced dose of enzyme and cost-efficient conversion  <cit> . out of various gh families for β-xylosidase, reports of gh <dig> family thermostable β-xylosidases are scarce. to date, most of the reported β-xylosidases from geobacillus spp. are from gh <dig> and gh <dig> family. for example, β-xylosidases of geobacillus thermodenitrificans tsaa <dig>  <cit> , geobacillus stearothermophilus  <cit> , geobacillus pallidus  <cit> , bacillus stearothermophilus  <dig>  <cit>  belonged to gh <dig> family and geobacillus thermoleovorans it- <dig>  <cit> , geobacillus thermoleovorans it- <dig>  <cit>  belonged to gh <dig> family .table  <dig>

a high specific activity of β-xylosidase enzyme for xylo-oligosaccharides is an important attribute for efficient enzymatic hydrolysis of the hemicellulose component of lignocellulose  <cit> . wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase specific activity is  <dig>  u/mg, which is high in comparison to other bacterial β-xylosidases such as thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum jw/sl-ys <dig>  <cit> , geobacillus thermoleovorans it- <dig>  <cit> , g. thermodenitrificans tsaa <dig>  <cit>  and g. pallidus  <cit>  that showed specific activity of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  u/mg respectively. specific activity was also higher than the β-xylosidases reported from fungal sources paecilomyces thermophila -  <dig>  u mg− <dig>  <cit> ; aspergillus awamori x- <dig> -  <dig>  u mg− <dig>  <cit>  and commercial enzymes like cazyme™ xylosidase  <dig> from lucigen -  <dig> u mg− <dig> 

omitting heat denaturation prior to sds-page resulted in an increase in the apparent mass of the β-xylosidase from 58 kda to 230 kda. interestingly, only the 230 kda protein displayed xylosidase activity in the zymogram. this suggests that the wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase is resistant to full denaturation by the detergent alone, and retains at least some of its quaternary structure which is necessary for successful recovery of catalytic activity following sds-page. based on the 4-fold increase in apparent mass, it appears that that the wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase exists in tetrameric form. gh <dig> β-xylosidase from thermoanaerobacterium sp. has been reported to exist as a tetramer  <cit> . property of retaining its activity in the presence of detergent could make it suitable for commercial applications in need for xylosidases resistant to denaturation with detergents.

wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase was active across a broad ph range of  <dig> - <dig>  with maximum activity at ph  <dig> . β-xylosidase from geobacillus stearothermophilus t- <dig> also exhibited maximum activity at  <dig>   <cit>  whereas β-xylosidases from geobacillus thermoleovorans it- <dig>  <cit> , geobacillus thermodenitrificans tsaa <dig>  <cit>  and g. pallidus  <cit>  showed their ph optima at  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. activity at broad ph range is a critical feature of applicability of industrial enzymes. β-xylosidases from other reported geobacillus spp. had a narrow ph range except g. pallidus  <cit> . at ph  <dig> , less than 10% and 40% relative activity for geobacillus thermoleovorans it- <dig>  <cit>  and geobacillus thermodenitrificans tsaa <dig>  <cit> , respectively compared to 46% from wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase whereas g. pallidus  <cit>  retained 89% activity.

wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase was also active across a broad temperature range with optima at 70°c. temperature optima was higher than geobacillus stearothermophilus t- <dig> , geobacillus thermoleovorans it- <dig> , geobacillus thermodenitrificans tsaa <dig> , and thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum jw/sl-ys <dig> . at a temperature higher than its optima , wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase retained 77% relative activity which was comparable to relative activities from geobacillus thermodenitrificans tsaa <dig>  <cit>  and g. pallidus  <cit> . geobacillus thermoleovorans it- <dig>  <cit>  β-xylosidase retained less than 40% relative activity at 75°c.

the performance of an enzyme mainly depends upon its operational stability. enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass is usually carried out for ≥ 3 days, so there is utmost requirement of enzymes which could retain their stability during this period. therefore, thermostable enzymes are gaining wide industrial and biotechnological interest due to their ability to withstand the often relatively harsh conditions of industrial processing  <cit> . wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase was found to be highly thermostable when compared with other reported β-xylosidases from thermophiles. wsucf <dig> xylosidase retained  <dig>   <dig> and 50% activity at  <dig>   <dig> and 70°c after the period of 9 days. β-xylosidase from geobacillus pallidus  <cit>  had a half-life of 50 h at 60°c, bacillus halodurans xylbh <dig> and xylbh <dig> displayed approximate half-life values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  h, respectively at 60°c, geobacillus thermoleovorans it- <dig>  <cit>  retained more than 70% activity after 1 h, thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum jw/sl-ys <dig>  <cit>  exhibited half-life of 1 h at 67°c, geobacillus thermoleovorans it- <dig>  <cit>  retained 50% activity after 35 min at  <dig> °c. at 50°c, the wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase retained almost 100% relative activity, and therefore this enzyme could be used as a component of commercial enzyme cocktails mainly working optimally at ≤ 50°c. various studies have also been published to enhance thermal stability of xylanases using genetic engineering  <cit>  whereas wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase is highly thermostable in its native form. thus β-xylosidase from geobacillus sp. wsucf <dig> appears to be among the most thermostable β-xylosidases from thermophiles having optimum growth temperatures of ≤ 70°c reported to date . higher thermal-stability of wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase will allow hydrolysis for extended times to convert lignocellulosic biomass into sugars, leading to decreased amount of enzyme needed for saccharification. it has also been stated that enzymes are the main cost in lignocellulosic conversion process  <cit> . due to high thermostability of wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase, it could be recycled with its full activity for the subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis. several studies have been reported on enzyme recycling, which significantly reduce overall cost of the process  <cit> . these discussions showed that thermostability is an essential attribute of an enzyme for its commercial application.

the kinetic properties of wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase  were significantly different from those of the other reported β-xylosidases. compared to wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase, thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum jw/sl-ys <dig> β-xylosidase  <cit>  and geobacillus thermodenitrificans tsaa <dig> β-xylosidase  <cit>  showed higher km of 28 mm and  <dig>  mm, respectively, which shows wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase has more specificity towards substrate.

β-xylosidase plays a vital role in the conversion of xylobiose and other higher xylo-oligosaccharides to xylose during enzymatic hydrolysis  <cit> . at commercial scale, performing enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass at high solid loadings is beneficial as it increases product concentrations and utilize less water. on the other end, this increased product concentrations could lead to enzyme inhibition called end-product inhibition  <cit> . therefore for industrial processes, utilization of a xylose tolerant β-xylosidase is very important in order to achieve high concentrations of xylose by avoiding end product inhibition. wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase exhibited tolerance to high concentrations of xylose, retaining 80% of initial activity at 100 mm xylose i.e. higher tolerance than β-xylosidase from paecilomyces thermophila which retained only 54% activity in the presence of 100 mm xylose. the other β-xylosidases reported for exhibiting strong tolerance to xylose inhibition are from scytalidium thermophilum  indicating that it is a true β-d-xylosidase  <cit> . addition of thermostable wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase along with endo-xylanase during birchwood xylan hydrolysis increased final xylose yields to approximately 90% which would further improve the fermentation product yields. similar observations were observed in β-xylosidases from paecilomyces thermophila  <cit>  and thermotoga thermarum  <cit> , which were active on different xylo-oligosaccharides obtained after xylan hydrolysis.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, a gh <dig> β-xylosidase from the thermophile geobacillus sp. strain wsucf <dig> was cloned and purified. compared to β-xylosidases from other thermophiles, wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase showed more thermostability. it also displayed various other desirable properties including high specific activity, high xylose tolerance, excellent hydrolytic activity on p-nitrophenyl-xylopyranoside and xylo-oligosaccharides, and resistance to detergent. a high degree of synergy was found with respect to the release of reducing sugars from xylans when β-xylosidase was combined with the endo-xylanase. these findings open a path to potential industrial applications of the wsucf <dig> β-xylosidase.
