BACKGROUND
biotic stresses, caused by highly specialized obligate parasites are among the most damaging diseases of wheat worldwide. while genetic resistance is a cost-effective, safe, and environmentally-sound method of disease control, our current ability to generate durable resistance in wheat is limited by our poor understanding of the genetic mechanisms and gene interactions involved in the wheat resistance response  <cit> .

the interaction between a pathogen and its plant host represents a highly complex and dynamic system. upon pathogen attack, a complex series of signaling events must occur in order to ensure that the proper cellular responses are activated. multiple layers of molecular cross-talk between plant and microbial proteins and between plant proteins determine the outcome of the interaction and the intensity of the disease state  <cit> . the signaling cascades that activate plant defenses are typically initiated following the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns or pathogen effectors by plant receptors or by host detection of pathogen induced modifications  <cit> . complex signaling cascades involving kinases and transcription factors  ultimately result in the transcriptional activation of defense mechanisms. the successful biotrophic lifestyle depends upon the ability of the pathogen to avoid or suppress host defenses via perturbations of critical nodes of these defense response pathways  <cit> .

physical interactions between proteins  play a critical role in the cascade of events associated with the activation of defense responses to pathogens  <cit> . for example, protein-protein interactions govern the interaction of host pattern recognition receptors with their ligand and downstream signaling proteins and are also important for effector recognition  <cit> , protein phosphorylation  <cit>  and transcriptional co-factor recruitment  <cit> . therefore, a better understanding of the defense response interactome will be helpful for an intelligent manipulation of the resistance pathways, and to select combinations of resistance genes that maximize their durability  <cit> . genome-wide interactome maps can be developed using high-throughput experimental techniques, such as yeast two-hybrid system  and mass spectrometry  <cit> . the systematic mapping on a genome-wide scale of interactions has been undertaken in model plant species whose complete genomic sequences are available, such as arabidopsis thaliana <cit>  and rice  <cit> . as a result of these efforts high-quality large-scale interaction maps for protein kinase signaling pathways and for the biotic and abiotic stress responses have been developed  <cit> . the rice stress response interactome has already provided a powerful tool for the dissection of the signal transduction pathway mediated by xa <dig>  a pattern recognition receptor  <cit>  that confers resistance to xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae . genetic analyses of proteins identified through these studies validated their function in the defense response and provided new insights into the signal transduction pathways governing disease resistance  <cit> .

unlike rice and arabidopsis, two diploid species with relatively small genomes , commercial wheat species are polyploid  and have large genomes . the sequence of the non-repetitive portions of the t. aestivum genome was only very recently made available . the complete sequence of the rice genome has provided an extremely useful parallel road map for genetic and genomics studies in wheat. the co-linearity between large blocks of wheat and rice chromosomes allowed the development of high-density maps that have enabled the isolation of genes encoding important wheat agronomic traits  <cit> . comparative rice and wheat genome analysis have greatly improved gene structure prediction  <cit>  and transcript annotation  <cit> .

similarly, the recent development of a protein-protein interaction network  of the rice defense response promises to advance knowledge in wheat and other grasses, which have more limited genomic resources. in order to use the rice stress response interactome as a template for dissection of the protein-protein interaction network controlling defense responses in wheat it is necessary to determine first the degree of conservation of these interactions in these two species. the objective of this work was to evaluate the conservation of these protein-protein interactions. we selected six proteins from the rice stress response interactome that represent key nodes controlling the rice defense response. these include  the protein folding chaperon complex rar1/sgt1/hsp <dig>  <cit> ,  the systemic acquired resistance regulator npr <dig> , and  the pattern recognition receptor xa <dig>  <cit>  and  xb <dig>  a shikimate kinase-like protein that interacts with xa <dig>  <cit> .

the rar1/sgt1/hsp <dig> complex plays a critical role in plant immunity  <cit>  by mediating the proper folding/stability of many nb-lrr r-proteins  <cit> . for example wheat lr21-mediated resistance to leaf rust requires the expression of rar <dig>  sgt <dig>  and hsp <dig> <cit> . npr <dig>  is a critical regulator in the salicylic acid -mediated signal transduction pathway that activates the systemic acquired resistance  responses  <cit> . arabidopsis npr <dig> mutants do not induce pr gene expression and fail to initiate sar responses upon pathogen challenge or treatment with sa or with the sar inducer,  <dig> -dichloroisonicotinic acid. when up-regulated, the rice npr <dig> homolog <dig>  confers robust resistance to xoo <cit> , whereas its down-regulation leads to loss of benzothiadiazole-induced resistance to pyricularia oryzae <cit> . the rice xa <dig> gene encodes a pattern recognition receptor that confers broad-spectrum resistance to xoo, the causal agent of bacterial blight disease. xa <dig> consists of an n-terminal leucine rich repeat domain , a transmembrane domain, a juxtamembrane domain  and a cytosolic c-terminal non-rd  kinase domain  <cit> . upon recognition by xa <dig> of a highly conserved sulfated peptide derived from the ax <dig> n-terminal domain  <cit> , xa21-mediated immunity is activated through a signaling cascade involving xa <dig> jm domain-mediated protein-protein interactions and nuclear translocation of the xa <dig> kinase domain . the molecular role of xb <dig> remains unclear.

in this work we identified and cloned the wheat orthologs of rice rar1/hsp90/sgt <dig>  npr1-nh <dig>  xa <dig> and xb <dig> and their known direct interactors. we then evaluated the degree of conservation in protein-protein interaction in rice and wheat by pair-wise interaction tests using yeast-two hybrid assays  and in vivo bimolecular fluorescence complementation . to facilitate the description of the different interactions the rice genes and protein names will be preceded hereafter by an “r” and the corresponding wheat orthologous genes and proteins by a “w”.

RESULTS
the rar1/sgt1/hsp <dig> protein complex
the wheat sequences of all the protein components of the rar1/sgt1/hsp <dig> complex were previously described and deposited in genbank . genes homologous to sgt <dig> and rar <dig> were identified in wheat, with high protein identity levels . these levels of protein identity are within the range usually observed between conserved rice and triticeae orthologous proteins . rice sgt <dig> is located on rice chromosome  <dig>  in a region that is collinear with wheat chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , where the wheat sgt <dig> homolog was mapped. a single sgt <dig> gene was found in wheat and a reciprocal blastp search of the rice predicted proteome using the wheat sgt <dig> protein sequence results in a single rice match with high similarity , providing further support that these genes are true orthologs. the phylogenetic relations determined using the neighbor joining  method as implemented in mega <dig>  <cit>  also supports the orthologous relation between the rice and wheat sgt <dig> proteins .

 <dig> the proportion of identical and similar amino acid sites were calculated using blastp local alignments.

 <dig> for xa <dig> similarities are computed based on alignments of the cytosolic domains including the c-terminal kinase domain and the juxtamembrane  as in  <cit>  that were used in the protein-protein interaction tests.

rar <dig> is also a single copy gene in wheat and in rice, but unlike sgt <dig>  rar <dig> was not found in syntenic regions in the two grasses. the rrar <dig> gene is located on rice chromosome  <dig> in a region that is syntenic with wheat chromosome  <dig>  not with wheat chromosome  <dig> where wrar <dig> was found. rar <dig> was mapped in barley on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , which is co-linear with wheat chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . the wheat - barley synteny at the rar <dig> locus together with the observation that the b. distachyon rar <dig> copy is located on chromosome  <dig> , which is syntenic with rice chromosome  <dig>  suggests that the rar <dig> locus change in chromosomes location occurred after divergence between b. distachyon and wheat, but before the wheat barley divergence. the nj phylogenetic tree based on the multiple-alignment of rar <dig> protein sequences reflects the evolutionary history of these grass species  <cit> . these phylogenetic relationships together with the high level of similarity between single copy genes  supports the orthologous relationship between the wheat and rice rar <dig> genes in spite of their non colinear location .

three hsp <dig> genes have been described in wheat, whsp <dig> , whsp <dig> , and whsp <dig> , but only the last two have been implicated in disease resistance  <cit>  and will be discussed in this study. a phylogenetic analysis of the wheat and rice hsp <dig> complete cdnas  <cit>  indicates that the whsp <dig>  gene located in the short arm of wheat homeologous group  <dig> is more closely related to the rice gene rhsp <dig> , which is located in the co-linear rice chromosome  <dig> . the whsp <dig>  gene located in the long arm of wheat homeologous group  <dig> is more closely related to the recently duplicated rice genes rhsp <dig>  and rhsp <dig> , which are both located in the colinear rice chromosome  <dig> and differ from each other only by a single amino-acid .

full-length coding regions of wrar <dig>  wsgt <dig>  whsp <dig>  and whsp <dig>  were pcr-amplified from t. aestivum cdna and cloned into pnlex and plaw <dig> or plaw <dig> vectors for both lexa and gal <dig> based y2h assays. a lexa based system was previously used to developed the rice immune response interactome  <cit>  and was adopted in this study to test all wheat - rice protein interaction to facilitate direct comparisons with previous rice-rice protein interactions determined using this system  <cit> . for wheat - wheat protein interactions we implemented the gal <dig> based matchmaker gold yeast two-hybrid system . this system includes four independent reporters that allow testing interactions at different stringencies and is being used in our laboratory to establish ab initio wheat protein interaction networks using cdna y2h library screening . by using the same gal <dig> system we will be able to seamlessly integrate the interactions observed in this and other studies into our developing wheat interactome map.

we observed a strong interaction between wrar <dig> and wsgt <dig>  which was confirmed in media lacking both histidine  and adenine , that results in a more stringent selection pressure . we then tested all possible pair-wise interactions between wrar <dig>  wsgt <dig>  whsp <dig> , and whsp <dig>  . the two whsp <dig> proteins interacted with both wsgt <dig> and wrar <dig> in the absence of h, but not in absence of both a and h. the rar1-sgt <dig> and hsp90s-sgt <dig> interactions were also observed when wheat proteins were tested with the corresponding rice proteins .

all five y2h positive interactions observed between wheat proteins of the rar1/sgt1/hsp <dig> complex  were further confirmed using bifc assays in rice protoplasts  <cit> . bifc allows direct visualization of protein-protein interactions in living plant cells. for all five interactions between wheat proteins of the rar1/sgt1/hsp <dig> complex we observed strong positive cytosolic signal in the rice protoplasts generated by the complementation of the yellow fluorescence protein  . no fluorescence was observed when individual wheat proteins were co-transfected into rice protoplasts with empty split yfp vectors in the control experiments .

the npr <dig> node
the full-length wheat ortholog of rice npr1-homolog <dig>  was isolated from t. turgidum ssp. durum cdna. initial amplification was carried out using oligonucleotides designed to conserved regions identified in the barley npr1-like protein . the cloned wnpr1-like gene was 86% and 84% identical to the b. distachyon  and rnpr <dig>  nucleotide sequences, respectively. a phylogenetic analysis of the encoded npr <dig> proteins from monocots and dicots was performed using the neighbor joining method  <cit> . the analysis also included sequences from close paralogs, such as the rice nh2- <dig> copies and the arabidopsis thaliana npr <dig> and npr <dig> copies . wheat npr <dig> formed a distinct and well-supported clade  with the other graminaceous npr <dig> proteins supporting the orthology between wnpr1-like and rnpr <dig>  a larger clade, also well-supported , grouped together the monocot and dicot npr <dig> sequences. rice, b. distachyon, and wheat npr1-like genes were also found within syntenic chromosomes further supporting the orthologous relationship between them . the full-length wnpr1-like coding sequence was cloned as bait and tested for its ability to establish protein-protein interactions with known rice rnpr <dig> interactors .

in the available wheat databases we identified orthologous copies of seven of the eight known rice proteins that were shown to interact with rnpr <dig> . specific members of the tga family of basic-region leucine zipper  transcription factors are known to interact with npr <dig> and mediate its function both in rice  <cit>  and arabidopsis  <cit> . we identified and cloned the wheat orthologs of all three tgas which interact with rnpr <dig>  their orthology was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis  and location in syntenic chromosomes . we also identified two wheat orthologous copies of the rice nrr protein  that was previously shown to strongly interact with rnpr <dig> and negatively regulate its activity  <cit> . the dna identity between wnrr-like <dig> and wnrr-like <dig> is 86%, which is much lower than the average 97% identity expected between genes duplicated by polyploidy . this result suggests that these two wnrr genes are paralogous copies. based on their position in the phylogenetic tree  and the absence of multiple nrr copies in the complete genomes of rice and b. distachyon, the wnrr-like <dig> and wnrr-like <dig> appear to be the result of a recent duplication event that occurred in the triticeae lineage. without a complete barley genome it was not possible to determine if the nrr-like  <dig> homologue in barley was deleted or simply not available in current databases. rice rnpr <dig> was also shown to interact with three rnrr paralogs  and a bzip transcription factor similar to the maize protein liguless gene . among these other interactors, we could identify and isolate the wheat orthologs of rnrrh <dig> and rlg <dig> .

wnpr1-like showed strong interactions with all the eight known rice rnpr1-interacting proteins, with the exception of rnrrh <dig>  for which a weaker interaction was observed . the three wtgas were pcr-amplified from cdna of t. monococcum, whereas the other four genes were synthesized using different templates: wnrr-like <dig> and wnrr-like <dig> used t. aestivum ests dr <dig>  and fgas <dig>  while wnrrh <dig> and wlg <dig> used de novo transcriptome assemblies from diploid wheat t. urartu  and the sequences where deposited in genbank . all seven wheat genes were cloned in the yeast prey vector and were shown to interact strongly with wnpr1-like . all y2h interactions between wnpr <dig> and wheat proteins, with the exception of wlg <dig>  were also confirmed in rice protoplasts using the bifc system where sharp fluorescent signals produced by the yfp reporter protein were detected in the protoplast nuclei .

the xa <dig> node
using the amino acid sequence of rice xa <dig>  as a query for tblastn searches of the publicly available wheat sequence databases, we identified two potential orthologous copies in the wheat genome . the two partial sequences were used as a template to clone the full-length wheat xa21-like genes  from t. aestivum. the kinase domain of wxa21-like <dig> and wxa21-like <dig> showed 71% and 66% amino-acid identity and 82% and 78% similarity to the kinase domain of rxa <dig>  respectively. an additional and more distant homolog of rxa <dig> was identified in the ae. tauschii genome . this third copy shares slightly lower similarity to rxa <dig> than wxa21-like <dig> .

to further determine the orthologous relationship between rxa <dig> and the identified wheat genes, the amino-acid sequences of the wheat xa21-like genes were aligned to rxa <dig> and other known xa <dig> homologs in rice and brachypodium distachyon, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed . xa <dig> proteins from grass species  were previously divided into  <dig> major clades, with clade  <dig> including rxa <dig> together with its closest rice paralogs and b. distachyon homologs  <cit> . the tree resulting from our phylogenetic analysis is consistent with the previous report  with clade  <dig> and clade  <dig> supported by high bootstrap values of 100% and 89%, respectively. both wxa21-like copies were part of clade 1a, whereas wxa21-like <dig> clustered together with the b. distachyon protein bradi3g <dig>  within the clade 1b . the location of wxa21-like <dig> on chromosome  <dig> is syntenic with rice chromosome  <dig> that carries rxa <dig> , which provides further support for the orthologous relationship between wxa21-like <dig> and rxa <dig>  however, because of their phylogenetic position within the same clade and their similar identity to rxa <dig>  both wxa21-like <dig> and  <dig> genes were considered potential orthologous copies of rxa <dig> and were both used to analyze the degree of conservation of the protein-protein interactions in rice and wheat.

both the c-terminal kinase domain and the jm domain of xa <dig> have previously been shown to serve as high affinity binding sites for downstream signaling proteins  <cit> . therefore, the entire cytosolic portion of rxa <dig> spanning both jm and kinase domain and comprising  <dig> amino-acids was previously used as bait for the library screens that resulted in the development of the xa21-centered interactome  <cit> . the same truncated forms of the rice and wheat xa <dig> proteins were used in this study.

protein-protein interactions between wxa21-like proteins and the known protein interactors of rxa <dig>  were tested using the same lexa based yeast two hybrid assay  as was used to test the rice-rice protein interactions  <cit> . the cytosolic domains of both wxa21-like genes were cloned into the gateway-compatible vector pnlex as baits. y2h pb42ad prey vectors carrying  <dig> different rice xbs were available  <cit> . of the  <dig> wheat-rice interactions tested, wxa21-like <dig> interacted with  <dig> of them. four of these interactions were strong  and the other five were weaker . wxa21-like <dig> interacted with seven rxb proteins , including the four showing strong interactions with wxa21-like <dig> and rxb <dig> and rxb <dig> . none of the two wheat wxa <dig> proteins interacted with rxb <dig> and rxb <dig> 

out of the  <dig> known interactors of xa <dig> in rice, we were able to isolate nine putative orthologous wheat copies. wheat orthologs of rxb <dig> and rxb <dig> were not identified. partial sequences of the wheat homologous genes of rice xbs were identified in the publicly available est collection . chromosome location , sequence similarity  and phylogenetic relationship between the rice, b. distachyon and wheat copies , supported the orthologous relationship between the cloned wheat genes and their rice homologs. orthologous relationships were confirmed for all wheat-rice orthologous protein pairs by reciprocal blastx searches .

the two wxa21-like genes and the wxb orthologs were pcr-amplified from cdna of t. aestivum and t. monococcum, respectively. the wxa21-like <dig> and wxa21-like <dig> genes were cloned in yeast vectors both as prey  and bait . most wxb orthologs were cloned in the yeast prey vector, with the exception of wxb <dig>  wxb <dig>  wxb <dig> and wxb <dig> that showed auto-activation when cloned in this vector. these last four wheat genes were cloned as baits and tested with wxa21-like <dig> and wxa21-like <dig> proteins cloned as preys . both wxa21-like <dig> and wxa21-like <dig> showed a strong interaction with wxb <dig> and weaker interactions with wxb <dig>  wxb <dig> and wwrky <dig> . as observed with rxb <dig>  none of the wxa21-like paralogs interacted with wxb <dig>  but unlike what was observed with rice xa21-xb interactions, we did not detect interactions for both wxa21-like paralogs with wxb <dig>  wxb <dig>  and wxak. since some wrky proteins have been shown to be nuclear transcription factors connecting disease resistance pathways  <cit> , we tested if wnpr <dig> was able to interact with wwrky <dig>  we observed a strong interaction of wwrky <dig> with wnpr <dig> both in -h and –h-a selection media .

to further explore the conservation between wheat and rice protein interactions we tested a secondary node of the rxa <dig> interactome. we selected the rxb <dig> node because its function is still unknown due to the lethality of the xb <dig> silencing in rice . putative wheat orthologs of three known rice interactors of rxb <dig>  were isolated from t. turgidum ssp. durum cdna . the wheat wxb <dig> protein showed strong interaction with rice rxa <dig>  but no detectable interactions with the two wxa21-like proteins. the wxb <dig> protein also showed strong interactions with wxb12-ip <dig>  wxb12-ip <dig>  and wxb12-ip <dig> and with the corresponding proteins from rice . in rice, rxb <dig> was shown to interact with the rar1/sgt1/hsp <dig> protein complex through a direct association with rhsp <dig>  <cit> . we tested the interaction of wxb <dig> with all the rice and wheat components of the rar1/sgt1/hsp <dig> protein complex. only a very weak interaction between wxb <dig> and both wheat and rice sgt <dig> was observed , confirming the association of xb <dig> with the protein complex, although through the association with a different interactor.

wheat y2h interactions detected for the xa <dig> and xb <dig> nodes were further validated using bifc rice protoplast . both wxa21-like genes were cloned in frame to the c-terminal fraction of the yellow fluorescent protein  <cit> , whereas wwrky <dig>  wxb <dig>  wxb <dig>  wxb <dig>  and wxb <dig> were all fused to the n-terminal fraction of the yfp protein. in rice protoplast interactions were detected for only a few of the pair-wise bifc tests carried out . we observed weak cytosolic and nuclear interactions between xb <dig> and both wxa21-like proteins, and between wxb <dig> and wxa21-like <dig> . in rice protoplasts we also detected the interaction between wxb <dig> and wxb12ip <dig> .

discussion
to determine the degree of conservation of the interactions between proteins involved in defense responses in wheat and rice, we identified and cloned the wheat orthologs of rice genes encoding proteins involved in four well-characterized nodes of the rice interactome and tested their protein-protein interactions using both rice-wheat and wheat-wheat protein pairs. despite more than  <dig> million years of divergence time from their common ancestor, we observed an extensive conservation in the interactions of these proteins in rice and wheat. in total we tested  <dig> binary protein interactions using y2h assays;  <dig> interactions were tested between rice and wheat proteins and  <dig> between wheat proteins. eighty three percent of the known interactions were confirmed between wheat proteins and rice interactors and 76% were confirmed using wheat protein pairs.

orthologous relationships between wheat and rice gene pairs
the identification of orthologous gene pairs is the first critical step for a reliable comparison of protein interactions  <cit> . the availability of comprehensive wheat est databases,  <dig> sequencing reads, and the complete annotated genome of the close relative b. distachyon greatly facilitated this task. the reciprocal highest sequence similarity between genes in two organisms is a valid indication of orthologous relations between genes  <cit> . the knowledge of syntenic relationships between rice, b. distachyon, and wheat chromosomes provided an additional parameter to establish orthology  <cit> . among all the wheat orthologs identified in this study, a lack of co-linearity between rice, b. dystachyon, and wheat was found only for rar <dig>  this gene, however, was co-linear in barley and wheat suggesting that the chromosome rearrangement for this locus occurred after the divergence between b. distachyon and the wheat-barley lineage  <cit> .

we identified and included in this study  <dig> wheat orthologs out of the  <dig> targeted rice proteins targeted in this study. despite the absence in the currently available databases of wheat orthologs for nrrh <dig>  nrrh <dig>  xb <dig>  xb <dig>  we cannot rule out the existence of functional copies of these genes in the wheat genome since the sequence of the complete wheat genome is not yet available. in those cases where we observed gene duplication events that occurred in wheat after the divergence between rice and wheat, such as for the wheat copies of rxa <dig> and rnrr, we included the available wheat paralogs in the analysis. only once a high quality and fully annotated wheat genome becomes available it will be possible to determine if the wheat nrrh <dig>  nrrh <dig>  xb <dig>  xb <dig> orthologs are present and if there are additional wxa <dig> and wnrr paralogs.

complete network conservation in the rar1/sgt1/hsp <dig>  npr <dig>  and xb <dig> nodes
the complete conservation of the interactomes for the rar1/sgt1/hsp <dig> and npr <dig> nodes likely reflects the importance of their functions in the immune responses across the plant kingdom. it has been demonstrated that both nodes play critical roles in the integration of signaling pathways in multiple plant species to direct defense responses against a broad range of pathogens . while a role of xb <dig> and its interactors in the rice defense response has yet to be defined, the lethal phenotype resulting from its down regulation indicates that this gene is essential for rice survival . the essential role of xb <dig> may explain the complete conservation of the interactions centered on xb <dig> tested in this study.

in cereals the rar1/sgt1/hsp <dig> molecular chaperone is known to be required for the resistance mediated by many nbs-lrr resistance genes such as barley mla <dig> and mla <dig>  effective against powdery mildew  <cit> , wheat lr <dig>  effective against leaf rust  <cit>  and the rice xa <dig> pattern recognition receptor  <cit> . the functional centrality of this node extends across the entire plant kingdom. for example, in arabidopsis, perturbations of this complex resulted in higher sensitivity to bacterial and viral pathogens  <cit> . importantly, this functional conservation is also associated with the retention of protein-protein interaction specificities even between monocots and dicots as suggested by the observation that barley rar <dig> can interact with two recently duplicated arabidopsis sgt <dig> paralogs  <cit> .

npr <dig> functions as a central regulator of salicylic acid-mediated systemic acquired resistance, the induction of systemic resistance by rhizobacterium spp., and the interaction between defense signaling pathways  <cit> . many pathogen proteins from evolutionary distant pathogens target a limited set of highly connected hubs to disrupt the normal deployment of immune responses  <cit> . sequence diversity between npr <dig> alleles in arabidopsis suggests strong positive selection imposed by pathogen pressure compatible with an “arms race” model of evolution, further supporting a critical position of npr <dig> in the immune response network  <cit> . the npr <dig> signaling pathway was demonstrated to be conserved between rice and arabidopsis  <cit> . our study extends this observation to wheat. although npr <dig> function remains to be mechanistically linked to disease resistance in wheat, the observation that benzothiadiazole  treatments induce acquired resistance in wheat and enhance resistance to powdery mildew suggests that npr <dig> may play a similar role in wheat as observed in other plant species  <cit> .

interaction differences between rice and wheat in the xa <dig> node
all the interaction differences detected in this study between rice and wheat were observed in the xa <dig> node, where 66% of the interactions between rice proteins involved in this node were not detected between the corresponding wheat homologs. this lower conservation might be related to the different duplication history of the xa <dig> gene family in the wheat and rice lineages. although xa <dig> duplications were found in the wheat – b. distachyon lineage, the degree of expansion appears to be much greater in rice than in wheat and other grasses  <cit> . recombination events at conserved dna sequences between paralogs, large sequence duplications, and transposable element insertions have contributed to the amplification and diversification of the rxa <dig> gene family  <cit> . an analogous larger expansion in rice than other plant species was also demonstrated for the rlp genes   <cit> . it is tempting to speculate that the higher duplication levels of xa <dig> in rice may be related with its particular growth conditions in standing water and its subtropical distribution, which might increase the pressure of bacterial pathogens. to test if the wxa21-like copies acquired novel interactors in wheat we have initiated the y2h screening of wheat cdna libraries.

a higher positive selection on proteins involved in biotic stress responses may accelerate the divergence of the related protein-protein interactions. in drosophyla melanogaster, saccaromyces cerevisiae, caenorhabditis elegans and homo sapiens significantly faster rates of changes in protein-protein interactions were observed in network nodes involved in immune and abiotic stress responses  <cit> . in particular, proteins that are part of intracellular signaling cascades were about two-fold more likely to show altered protein interactions than proteins involved in primary metabolism. a possible explanation is that these proteins involved in signaling cascades carry domains that can interact with diverse and common structural motifs and, thus, are more efficient in gaining novel interactors  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the high conservation of protein-protein interactions centered on key regulators of the rice defense response suggests that the existing experimentally generated rice interactome is a useful initial predictor of wheat protein interactions. our results also point to a higher degree of interaction divergence in those interactome nodes that show divergent duplication history, perhaps related to selective pressure by species-specific pathogen types. a genome-wide search of wheat orthologs to the rice genes included in the stress response interactome can be used to generate a predicted wheat interactome. the hypothetical interactions will need to be validated experimentally and be complemented with wheat cdna library screens to identify wheat-specific protein interactions. finally, available wheat tilling mutant populations  <cit>  or transgenic approaches can be used to validate the biologically relevance of genes coding for protein located at nodes of the wheat stress interactome.
