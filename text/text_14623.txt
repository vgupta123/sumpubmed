BACKGROUND
urothelial bladder cancer  has a high incidence, with  <dig>  new cases and  <dig>  deaths from ubc in europe in  <dig>  <cit>  and a high prevalence due to the fact that it is commonly an indolent disease. ubc has a higher incidence in males than in females  and it is the fourth most common cancer in men. age, smoking, chlorination byproducts, and occupational exposures are the major risk factors  <cit> .

ubc displays a high level of clinical and pathological heterogeneity. morphologically, tumors can show papillary vs. solid growth patterns. a clinically relevant issue is the level of invasion of the bladder wall: tumors are classified as non-muscle invasive  or muscle-invasive . the majority of patients  present with papillary nmibc, most of whom have a good prognosis. patients with high-grade nmibc, and those with mibc, have an aggressive disease that can lead to patient’s death, emphasizing the need to better classify these tumor subgroups.

approximately 70% of nmibc harbour activating mutations in fgfr <dig>  the main oncogene involved in ubc  <cit> . pik3ca mutations occur in 15% of ubc, often in association with fgfr <dig> mutations  <cit> . an additional 10% of tumors have mutations in ras genes, mutually exclusive with fgfr <dig> mutations  <cit> . mibc tend to have a low frequency of mutations in fgfr <dig>  and develop predominantly through the inactivation of the p <dig> and rb pathways  <cit> . unlike nmibc, these tumors are genomically unstable  <cit> ; several studies have reported the most commonly gained and lost regions  <cit> . tert promoter mutations occur in >70% ubc, regardless of stage/grade  <cit> .

tumor cell lines are invaluable research tools. they are readily amenable to experimental manipulation, providing opportunities for functional analyses and contributing to improved knowledge  <cit> . cell lines have proven useful in preclinical pharmacological studies  <cit>  and will be very important to characterize the function of new cancer genes identified through massive parallel sequencing. however, cell lines often fail to faithfully reflect the genetic and phenotypic diversity of primary tumors and do not fully recapitulate their complexity because the stromal and inflammatory components are not represented in vitro. in addition, tumor cells may behave differently in vitro due to the lack of interactions with non-neoplastic cells. therefore, a thorough knowledge of their genotype and phenotype is essential in order to optimize their use while considering their limitations.

cell lines from primary ubc are commonly used as disease models. it is crucial to identify those lines best suited to answer specific biological questions and to place the studies in the context of patient’s tumors. the genetic make-up of ubc cell lines has been analyzed using array comparative genomic hybridization  <cit> . high-resolution gene copy number information for  <dig> ubc lines is published as part of the cancer cell line encyclopedia  <cit>  but a detailed comparison of mutations, gene copy number changes, and gene expression is not available. importantly, the nci- <dig> panel does not contain any ubc line  <cit> . here, we compile high-resolution genomic information on the largest panel of ubc lines analyzed so far and provide a comprehensive overview of their genetic/genomic architecture. in addition, we use the global transcriptomics data to place the cell lines in the context of the recently reported molecular taxonomy of ubc. this will serve as a reference to the bladder cancer research community and will help to select the most adequate cells to answer specific biological questions.

the genomic architecture of ubc lines
information on  <dig>  autosomal probes covering  <dig>  mb of the genome was analyzed using the wavicgh web server. all of these probes were called as altered  in ≥ <dig> cell lines. an average of 1349 mb  were altered across the panel: 592 mb were gained  and 757 mb were lost . the line showing the lowest fraction of the  genome altered was mgh-u <dig> . 639v cells showed the highest fraction of gains/losses: 2111 mb  . the remaining lines showed variable fractions of the genome altered over a continuum; no discrete categories could be identified . losses were more frequent than gains: an average 28% of covered genome was lost as compared to 21% gained . most cell lines showed loss or gain of multiple whole chromosomes .figure  <dig> genomic alterations in cell lines included in the ubc- <dig> panel.  fraction of the genome altered .  whole chromosome and whole chromosome arm alterations in the cell lines.  fraction of the genome affected by upds.



alterations in oncogenes and tumor suppressors
table  <dig> shows the mutational status of ubc-relevant oncogenes and tumor suppressors. figure 2a and additional file 1: table s <dig> summarize these results and compare mutation prevalence in cell lines and in primary ubc using information retrieved from the cosmic database. fgfr <dig> mutations were significantly less frequent in cell lines than in tumors . rt <dig> and rt <dig> cells exhibited amplification of a  <dig> and 79 mb region, respectively, encompassing fgfr <dig> and part of the neighboring tacc <dig>  fgfr <dig> mrna expression was higher in fgfr3-mutant lines  . these two lines, and sw- <dig>  have recently been shown to harbour activating translocations involving fgfr <dig>  <cit> . pik3ca mutation frequency was similar in lines and ubc tissues . five of  <dig> lines  harbored a mutation in both fgfr <dig> and pik3ca, comparable with the frequency in cosmic ubc tissues . mutations in hras , kras , nras , and akt <dig>  were less frequent . um-uc- <dig> demonstrated amplification of a  <dig>  mb region including kras. there were no amplifications in pik3ca, hras, or nras.figure  <dig> alterations in the most relevant oncogenes and tumor suppressors involved in ubc.  comparison of mutation frequency in ubc lines and tumors.  frequency of loh or homozygous deletion of tumor supressor genes in ubc lines and tumors.  association between fgfr <dig> mutation status and mrna expression.  association between ink4a copy status and mrna expression.  association between pten copy status and mrna expression. hd = homozygous deletion, loh = loss of heterozygosity, wt = wild type.*p <  <dig>  **p <  <dig> .



to assess the status of key tumor suppressors  both mutations and genomic losses were considered . vm-cub- <dig> was the only line harboring a point mutation in ink4a; gene losses were present in 63% of cell lines, including both loss of heterozygosity   and homozygous deletions  . ink4a mrna expression was significantly lower in lines with loh  or hd than in wild type lines . as of pten, 23% and 19% of the lines harboured mutations or loh. j <dig> and um-uc- <dig> had a pten mutation and a partial hd. 639v, t <dig>  and um-uc- <dig> harboured a missense mutation and retained a wild type allele whereas  <dig>  rt <dig>  and sw- <dig> were wild type and showed loh. cell lines with loh or mutant pten had a significantly lower expression of pten mrna than wild type lines . pten mutations were also significantly more frequent in cell lines than in tumor tissues . regarding tp <dig>  mutations were significantly more frequent in cell lines than in tumors . loh was found in 47% of the lines.

figure 2b compares the frequency of tumor suppressor gene losses in cell lines and tissues analyzed using the same assay platform , categorized as non-aggressive vs. aggressive. gene loss in cell lines and aggressive tumors was comparable . however, non-aggressive tumors showed a lower frequency of alterations as compared to cell lines . the frequency of ink4a and pten loss was similar in cell lines and tumors  but the frequency of tp <dig> loh was higher in cell lines .

original tumor grade, oncogene/tumor suppressor status, and genomic instability
the grade of the original tumor from which  <dig> lines were isolated was available . genomic instability, assessed as the size of the genome with copy number alterations, was compared in samples harbouring - or not - mutations in ubc oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.

in agreement with the genomic analyses of tumors, fgfr <dig> mutant lines showed lower genomic instability . by contrast, tp <dig> mutant lines showed higher genomic instability  . cell lines isolated from low-grade tumors  tended to be more stable than those isolated from high-grade tumors  . similar tendencies were observed when using  <dig> different metrics to assess genomic instability . fgfr <dig> mutant lines tended to fall within the genomically stable group whereas tp <dig> mutant and high-grade lines tended to fall within the genomically unstable-high group .

copy number changes involving whole chromosomes/whole chromosome arms
because distinct mechanisms lead to alterations in whole chromosomes or chromosome arms and to interstitial changes, these were assessed separately. most cell lines showed losses and gains of multiple whole chromosomes/whole chromosome arms . chromosomes most frequently gained were chr. <dig> , chr. <dig> , chr. <dig> , and chr. <dig> . the chromosome arms most frequently gained included 5p , 8q , 3q , 7p , 9q , 1q , 20q , 20p , and 9p . chromosomes most frequently lost were chr. <dig> , chr. <dig> , chr. <dig> , chr. <dig> , chr. <dig> , chr. <dig> , and chr. <dig> . the most common arm losses included 8p , 18q , 3p , 9p , 17p , and 2q .table  <dig>

figure  <dig> shows copy number calls of individual probes for each line; table  <dig> shows statistically significant minimal common regions  identified using wavicgh, a permutation-based method  <cit> . altogether,  <dig> statistically significant  mcrs were identified , ranging from  <dig>  kb-156 mb in size . six mcrs almost entirely covering chromosome  <dig> were identified; some mcrs overlapped with whole chromosome or chromosome arm changes, such as gains in 1q, 3q, 5p,  <dig>  and  <dig> and losses in 3p,  <dig>  and  <dig>  other mcrs included gains at 11p <dig> and losses at 6p <dig> -6p <dig> , 10q <dig> , and 13q <dig>  . all recurrent focal losses were hemizygous.figure  <dig> genome wide copy number calls across the genome in ubc lines. gender and oncogene/tumor suppressor status are also annotated.

x chromosome analysis
data regarding the x chromosome could be evaluated in  <dig> lines . large structural alterations were rare:  <dig> lines showed complete loss of xp whereas  <dig> lines showed almost complete gain of xq. no significant mcrs were identified although peak gains were seen at xp <dig> , xp <dig> , xp <dig> , xq <dig> , xq <dig>  and xq <dig> and peak losses at xq <dig>  and xp <dig> - <dig>  .

uniparental disomies 
autosomes were analyzed for the presence of upd , defined as copy number neutral or amplified regions showing loh. examples of different categories of upd events are shown in additional file 2: figure s4a-f. overall,  <dig> upd events were identified in  <dig> lines: upds were absent from bc <dig>  rt <dig>  and mgh-u <dig>  interestingly, these lines are among those showing lower fraction of the genome altered . all autosomes displayed ≥ <dig> upd event in ≥ <dig> lines. the median number of upd events per line was 4; cell line 97- <dig> showed  <dig> upd events. focal upds were the most common event , ranging in size from 2-129 mb. there were  <dig> upds involving whole chromosomes and  <dig> upds of a whole chromosome arm. upds involving whole chromosomes were most common in chr.  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> figure  <dig> genome wide assessment of regions showing upd identified in ubc lines.



many upd events occurred in regions that are lost in other lines, supporting the occurrence of tumor suppressors therein. for example, region 3p <dig> -3p <dig> , lost in 46% of lines, coincides with a recurrent upd. in addition,  <dig> lines show upd of chr. <dig>  or 3p arm . the number of upd and their total genome size correlated with the genome size affected by copy number alterations  . fgfr <dig> mutant cell lines had significantly fewer upd events and overall size of the genome affected by upd than wild type lines, supporting that upd associates with aggressiveness .

gene-level analysis of copy number alterations
gene copy number data was newly generated from  <dig> low-risk and  <dig> high-risk primary ubc. some gains  and losses  occurred with similar frequency in lines and tumors .figure  <dig> genome wide copy number calls in primary bladder tumors  with t and g annotation.



tumors typically showed whole chr. <dig> loss, likely targeting multiple tumor suppressors  whereas the cell lines had a high frequency of both gains and losses of chromosome  <dig>  often in association with upd affecting either the whole chromosome or its q-arm . partial chr.  <dig> upds were found in several cell lines although there was no overlap among the regions affected. chr. <dig> and chr. <dig> were more frequently lost in lines whereas they were more often gained in tumors .

comparison of gene copy number alterations and expression
the complete expression dataset is provided in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the  <dig> regions amplified in ≥ <dig> cell lines  include  <dig> protein-coding genes with microarray expression information;  <dig> of them had a higher average expression in lines with gains/amplifications vs. those without them. this difference was statistically significant for  <dig> genes . among them are cdkal <dig> , asrgl <dig> , atp2b <dig> , itga <dig>  prpsap <dig>  and c17orf <dig> , all with a fold-change difference between amplified and non-amplified tumors of  <dig> - <dig>  .

gene expression information for  <dig> genes in the  <dig> lost regions was available;  <dig> had a lower average expression in cell lines with loss vs. those without loss. of them,  <dig> showed statistically significant differential expression, including anxa <dig> , arap <dig> , cds <dig> , and ptprg  .

genomic analyses of new genes involved in ubc identified through exome sequencing
we analyzed copy number, upd status, and expression of new driver ubc genes  identified through exome sequencing  <cit> . several of them are in genomic regions with either whole chromosome/chromosome arm gain/loss. loh, and gains were more common than upd . pdzd <dig> and csmd <dig> were often gained  whereas ank <dig>  fat <dig> and mll were often lost ; mll is on chromosome  <dig> - which is not frequently altered in ubc - and is significantly under-expressed in cell lines with loh . tsc <dig> showed both gains  and upd ; a similar pattern was observed for other tumor suppressor genes. tp <dig> and ep <dig> were affected by both loh and upd.

ubc cell lines represent molecularly defined bladder cancer subtypes
we applied the ubc molecular classifier based on gene expression defined by sjodahl et al  <cit>  to identify lines most representative of the taxonomical groups proposed. figure 6a shows that cell lines could be adscribed to the “urobasal a”, “urobasal b”, and “scc-like” classifiers . the “genomically unstable” group was most commonly represented among the lines. rebouissou et al. have recently reported on a 40-gene basal-like signature  <cit> . we have applied their 40-gene classifier to the cell line dataset and identify  <dig> major groups: lines with a predominant enrichment in the “basal-like” signature; lines with a predominant enrichment in the “non basal-like” signature; lines with enrichment of both signatures; and lines in which none of the signatures is enriched . in agreement with the gene mutation/copy number change data indicating that cell lines are biased towards a more aggressive type, the “non basal/luminal” phenotype is less represented among the available established cell lines.figure  <dig> clustering of ubc lines according to the expression of gene signatures used to molecularly classify primary tumors.  cell lines displaying expression patterns of the “urobasal a”, “urobasal b”, and “scc-like” by sjodahl et al  <cit> . the “genomically unstable” category is poorly defined.  cell lines displaying expression signatures of “basal-like” or “non basal-like” tumors according to the classification of rebouissou et al.  <cit> .



discussion
this is the most comprehensive analysis of the genomic landscape of ubc lines reported to date, including mutation, copy number, and expression data for a panel of ubc lines. as we have complete copy number and gene expression data for  <dig> of them, we have named this dataset ubc- <dig> 

we provide detailed information on the source of the cell lines used in order to avoid “mistaken identity”. when surveying the literature, there are conflicting reports regarding the mutation status of some of the genes studied possibly due to cell contamination or mislabeling; similar problems have been reported with lines from the nci- <dig> panel  <cit> . for example, mgh-u1/ej and some subcultures of j <dig> are derived from t <dig>  <cit>  and ku <dig> was cross-contaminated with hela  <cit> . cell lines extensively cultured in different laboratories may have evolved independently and ultimately acquired mutations or genomic changes absent from the original line  <cit> . nevertheless, fundamental features of these cell lines show stability and have allowed their extensive use as models of ubc in a wide variety of studies; this is the case of fgfr3-dependent rt <dig> cells  <cit> . the clustering shown in figure  <dig> allows to propose, using two independent classifiers, prototype cell lines of papillary/luminal tumor phenotypes , and basal-like tumors . interestingly, a few cell lines display enrichment in both basal and non-basal gene signatures . this information will be useful for selecting the best models to address specific functional studies.

most of the lines analyzed here were generated many years ago, have been extensively passaged, and do not have matched normal tissue - or lymphoblastoid b cells - from the same patient available. therefore, it is not possible to define the somatic variants they carry, this being the reason why we have not conducted exome sequencing. consequently, and because the lines available only represent incompletely the spectrum of ubc as it relates to low-grade tumors, renewed efforts should be placed in the establishment of new cell lines and xenografts to facilitate preclinical studies. improved sample processing, matrigel embedding, and orthotopic implantation, as well as more reliable systems for primary culture and passage  <cit> , should contribute to improve efficiency. furthermore, efforts should be made to biobank non-neoplastic material from the same patients.

the summary data reported here provides an overview and the detailed datasets should serve as a resource to the research community in order to identify which - among these lines - serve best as disease models for specific tumor subtypes. the recent discovery of new driver genes involved in ubc through massive parallel sequencing  <cit>  and the information provided here should be useful to select lines appropriate for their functional analysis and for preclinical studies.

CONCLUSIONS
- tp53-mutant lines show high genomic instability whereas fgfr3- or pik3ca-mutant lines are more genomically stable.

- we have identified for the first time upd events in ubc lines, pointing to new regions containing putative tumor suppressors.

- we provide novel information on chr. x losses, where new important tumor suppressor genes have been identified .

- we identify novel regions deserving research as they are frequently altered in ucb lines as well as in primary tumors.

- some cell lines are more representative of the fgfr3-driven tumor pathway  whereas others are more representative of the tumor suppressor-driven pathways . we propose that - as has already been done, in part - these cells be used as models of non-aggressive and aggressive ubc, respectively.

- the ubc lines available cover a wide range of tumor genotypes and phenotypes. while they do not fully represent the spectrum of tumors found in patients and are enriched towards a more aggressive genetic architecture, the main genetic pathways involved in ubc are represented in this panel.

- future efforts should be placed to establish new ubc lines, mainly focusing on less aggressive tumors, as well as collections of patient-derived xenografts.
