BACKGROUND
the molecular dynamics involved in embryogenesis is now being elucidated. in the early cleavage stage of embryogenesis, the localization of cell surface molecules periodically changes and is spatio-temporally controlled. cytokinesis is a fundamental process of cell cleavage in which the daughter cells split after nuclear division, and it is driven by actin-dependent narrowing of a contractile ring as well as furrow-specific addition of membrane  <cit> . the latter contributes to dynamic rearrangement of cell surface proteins and provides molecules required to construct the complex machinery of cytokinesis. for example, the cell surface adhesion molecule e-cadherin is drastically rearranged in a close correlation with the dynamics of cortical actin  <cit> . it is well documented that e-cadherin is located predominantly in membrane domains involved in cell-cell contacts of adjacent blastomeres and mediates adhesion between blastomeres of preimplantation mouse embryos from 8-cell stage onwards  <cit> .

a new aspect of the cell membrane structures called "lipid rafts" has been postulated  <cit> . lipid rafts have been described by lingwood and simons as "fluctuating nanoscale assemblies of sphingolipid, cholesterol, and proteins that can be stabilized to coalesce into platforms that function in membrane signaling and trafficking"  <cit> . during cell cleavage in embryogenesis, lipid rafts were shown to play an essential role in central spindle assembly and cleavage furrow ingression  <cit> . for example, gm <dig> is a monosialylated ganglio-series glycosphingolipid , which is most commonly used as a raft marker. the lipid rafts enriched in gm <dig> at the cleavage furrow were shown to possess signaling machinery that contributes to cytokinesis during the cleavage of sea urchin eggs and mouse preimplantation embryos  <cit> .

we recently reported finding that monoclonal antibody  6e <dig> raised against human embryonal carcinoma cell line recognizes the globo-series gsl msgb5cer is present at the interfaces between blastomeres of living mouse embryos  <cit> . msgb5cer carries an epitope of stage-specific embryonic antigen- <dig> , which expressed only in the early cleavage stage of mouse embryos. lipid rafts enriched with msgb5cer was also reported to interact with e-cadherin in breast cancer cell lines  <cit> . therefore, msgb5cer is expected to form lipid rafts on mouse preimplantation embryos and play an important role in the process of cleavage division. to elucidate the functional role of msgb5cer enriched-lipid rafts in embryogenesis, in this study we investigated the dynamics of msgb5cer in preimplantation embryos during the course of early embryonic cleavage.

RESULTS
msgb5cer and e-cadherin localize at the interfaces between the blastomeres in mouse preimplantation embryos
msgb5cer, e-cadherin, and gm <dig> were visualized in living mouse preimplantation embryos, and their localizations are shown in the optical slice images in figure 1a. msgb5cer and e-cadherin were stained with mabs 6e <dig> and eccd- <dig>  respectively, and they were localized on the cell surface in dotted form in unfertilized eggs but excluded from the area over the meiotic spindle. gm <dig>  on the other hand, was stained with the cholera toxin b subunit  and had accumulated in a perivitelline space in unfertilized eggs, and its accumulation accelerated after fertilization. preferential localization of msgb5cer and e-cadherin at interfaces between blastomeres was also observed in compacted 8-cell stage embryos, whereas gm <dig> mainly localized at the outer surface area and only a small amount of gm <dig> was detected at the interfaces. a part of msgb5cer was localized similar to gm <dig> at the outer surface area of blastomeres. these results indicate that msgb5cer and e-cadherin, but not gm <dig>  are similarly distributed in preimplantation embryos.

next, we enzymatically prepared fluorescence-labeled msgb5cer or gm <dig> and introduced into embryos instead of staining with gsl-specific mab 6e <dig> or ligand ctx-b to visualize gsls on embryos. as shown in the optical slice images in figure 1b, bodipy®fl-msgb5cer was distributed mainly at the interfaces between blastomeres, whereas bodipy®fl-gm <dig> was evenly distributed over the surface and in the perivitelline space. in contrast, bodipy®fl-c <dig> fatty acids, as a negative control, were not detected at all. the results coincided with that shown by immunostaining. the prolonged culture of bodipy®fl-msgb5cer-introduced embryo in the presence of 6e <dig> at the same concentration used for immunostaining in figure 1a did not affect preferential localization of msgb5cer, or did not induce the aggregation of msgb5cer . therefore, it is indicated that the preferential localization of msgb5cer at interfaces is due to spontaneous accumulation of msgb5cer at interfaces and is not due to the artifactual aggregation of msgb5cer induced by cross-linking with antibody.

msgb5cer accumulates in the cleavage furrow of preimplantation embryos during cytokinesis, and then at the interfaces after cytokinesis
time-lapse images of msgb5cer visualized with msgb5cer-specific mab  are shown in figure 2a. msgb5cer began to accumulate at the site of the future furrow  of the spherical zygote at  <dig> minutes, and accumulation later accelerated and peaked at  <dig> minutes. accumulation at the interface also accelerated, and after peaking at  <dig> minutes, gradually decreased to the initial level at  <dig> minutes . the means ± s. d. of the fluorescence intensities in the furrow and at the interface of  <dig> embryos in the round stage, during cytokinesis, after cytokinesis, and in the late 2-cell stage are shown in figure 2c. msgb5cer accumulated in the furrow at the start of cytokinesis and moved to the interface as cytokinesis proceeded. after cytokinesis, the accumulation was gradually broken, and msgb5cer eventually became evenly distributed over the entire cell surface, including the interface.

overlapping distribution of msgb5cer with cholesterol
cholesterol is known to be an important constituent of lipid rafts. since msgb5cer is thought to be also involved in the formation of raft membrane domains in preimplantation embryos, we examined the distribution of cholesterol with filipin iii in the 6e2-stained and fixed embryos. the merged images of msgb5cer and cholesterol showed overlapping localization at the interfaces between blastomeres .

mbcd causes de-compaction and subsequent suppression of cell division
since cholesterol has been postulated to be an absolute requirement for raft integrity, mbcd, which depletes cholesterol from the cell surface, has been used as a tool in lipid raft research  <cit> . to investigate the correlation between raft integrity and the distribution of msgb5cer, gm <dig>  and e-cadherin in the embryos, compacted 8-cell embryos were pretreated with various concentrations of mbcd for  <dig> minutes and then examined. as shown in figure 4a, pretreatment of the embryos with  <dig>  mm mbcd induced decompaction and decreased expression of msgb5cer at the interface between blastomeres. the expression on the outer membrane of blastomeres was not decreased and rather seemed to be increased. at a higher concentration , expression of msgb5cer on the cell surface was further reduced, whereas expression of gm <dig> and e-cadherin was unaffected. the green fluorescence signals detected in the zona pellucida of  <dig> mm mbcd-treated embryos are thought to be derived from msgb5cer released from the embryo. treatment with  <dig> mm mbcd caused complete loss of msgb5cer, and decreased expression of gm <dig>  but there were no change in e-cadherin expression.

next, we investigated the importance of raft integrity in viability of embryos. pretreatment of 8-cell embryos with mbcd suppressed normal development in a time- and concentration-dependent manner . all embryos in the control culture survived and developed normally into blastocysts by  <dig> hours of culture, whereas none of embryos pretreated with  <dig>  mm mbcd had survived by  <dig> hours of culture. these results suggest that msgb5cer is more sensitive than gm <dig> to raft integrity, and that lipid raft is prerequisite to cell adhesion and normal development of preimplantation embryos.

extensive accumulation of msgb5cer to interfaces is related to delay and suppression of normal development
as shown in figure 5a, incubation for  <dig> hour in the presence of  <dig> μg/ml of anti- msgb5cer mab 6e <dig>  but not of the isotype-matched control mab 15b <dig>  led to extensive accumulation of msgb5cer at the interfaces in the embryos, and a large aggregate of bodipy®fl-msgb5cer was found.

prolonged culture of 2-cell embryos in the presence of 6e <dig> caused a decrease in survival rate, and more than 90% of the embryos died before developing into blastocysts . 80% of embryos were died after  <dig> hour culture in 6e <dig>  whereas all of embryos cultured in control mabs were alive. after  <dig> hour-culture, embryos cultured in 6e <dig> cleaved abnormally, and their cleavage rate was delayed as compared with those cultured in control mabs. the morula embryo, which was able to avoid being injured, seemed to be compacted . the anti-msgb5cer mab 6e <dig> we used in this study is not toxic and do not have non-specific effects on preimplantation embryos, because  <dig> μg/ml of 6e <dig> antibody does not affect viability of blastocyst stage embryos that no longer express msgb5cer . in addition, when either the isotype-matched control mab 15b <dig> or anti-e-cadherin mab eccd- <dig> was similarly tested, they did not affect viability of embryos .

in the 2-cell embryos cultured for  <dig> hours with 6e <dig>  a large amount of f-actin accumulated at the interfaces, whereas no e-cadherin was detected at the interfaces, and it almost localized on the outer surface of blastomeres . the entry of e-cadherin into the interfaces in living embryos was inhibited after treatment with mab 6e <dig> in a dose-dependent manner .

msgb5cer did not accumulate at the interfaces in actin-depolymerized 2-cell embryos
actin filaments are thought to generate a mechanical force that drives membrane molecules or domains during cytokinesis. we investigated the effect of disruption of actin filaments with ccd on the localization of msgb5cer. as shown in figure  <dig>  when 2-cell stage embryos preincubated with  <dig>   <dig> , and  <dig> μg/ml of ccd were immunostained with anti-msgb5cer mab 6e <dig>  accumulation of msgb5cer at the interface was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner. these results suggest that inhibition of f-actin polymerization by ccd prevents the localization of msgb5cer at the interface.

absence of e-cadherin causes heterotopic localization of msgb5cer on the blastomere surface
to investigate the involvement of e-cadherin in the localization of msgb5cer at the interface, we generated embryos lacking maternal e-cadherin, and examined them. in control 2-cell embryos , msgb5cer and e-cadherin exhibited a similar distribution pattern and accumulated at the interface . in e-cadherin null mutant 2-cell embryos , adhesion between the blastomeres was weaker and the area of the interface plane was greatly reduced . in these embryos, msgb5cer formed heterotopic aggregates  or assembled at the outer surface membranes of the blastomeres . these results suggest that e-cadherin is required not for assembly, but for localization of msgb5cer at the interface of blastomeres.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we investigated the involvement of msgb5cer in the development of mouse preimplantation embryos. as presented in figure  <dig>  msgb5cer moved to the future site of the cleavage furrow and accumulated at the interfaces between blastomeres as cytokinesis proceeds during embryonic development of mouse preimplantation embryos. once, however, cytokinesis is complete the msgb5cer have accumulated at the interfaces evenly redistribute themselves over the cell surface .

msgb5cer is thought to be involved in the formation of raft membrane domains. indeed, we observed overlapped localization of msgb5cer and cholesterol, an important constituent of lipid rafts . the finding that disruption of the integrity of lipid rafts by removal of cholesterol from the cell membrane with mbcd caused the release of msgb5cer into the perivitelline space  should further support above notion. interestingly, as we presented in this study , gm <dig> and msgb5cer localize differently, suggesting that they may belong to different lipid rafts that possess distinct functions as described in several studies  <cit> .

since gm <dig> is easily detected with ctx-b, it is considered one of the most important marker gsls for lipid rafts. comiskey and warner reported observation that gm <dig> visualized with biotinylated ctx-b were enriched at the cleavage furrow in mouse 2-cell and 4-cell embryos which actively undergo cytokinesis  <cit> . burgess dr and his co-workers also reported that plasma membrane domains enriched in gm <dig> contain signalling machinery that contributes to cytokinesis and accumulate in the equatorial plasma membrane at mid-anaphase in sea urchin eggs  <cit> , and further revealed that cells are polarized upon insertion of distinct basolateral membrane at the first division using the apical marker gm <dig> and the apkc-par <dig> complex  <cit> . although gm <dig> is constantly expressed throughout the cleavage stage in preimplantation embryos, msgb5cer is expressed only in the early cleavage stage from the unfertilized egg stage to morula stage embryos and more abundantly enriched at the cleavage furrow than gm <dig> during the course of cytokinesis . msgb5cer should therefore play a more specific role as a constituent of lipid rafts at this stage.

as described above, mbcd-mediated disruption of the integrity of lipid rafts caused the release of msgb5cer into the perivitelline space and decompaction of compacted 8-cell embryos and suppressed cell division. comiskey and warner also showed that cholesterol depletion by treatment of zygotes with mbcd inhibits preimplantation development from zygotes to blastocysts stage in culture in a dose-dependent manner  <cit> . on the other hand, heavy cross-linking of msgb5cer with msgb5cer-specific mab induces extensive aggregation of msgb5cer  and suppressed cytokinesis. as a consequence, normal embryonic development would be terminated in both cases. therefore, lipid rafts enriched in msgb5cer should play an important role in cytokinesis as well as in embryogenesis.

during cytokinesis, the cortical actin network form a scaffold for membrane proteins and thereby transfer them toward the cleavage furrow  <cit> . e-cadherin knockout mice display embryonic lethality and embryos are unable to form adhesion complexes  <cit> . in this study, we also presented close correlations between lipid rafts enriched in msgb5cer and e-cadherin as well as the cortical actin network. in preimplantation embryos, msgb5cer and e-cadherin are similarly distributed at the interfaces between blastomeres in 8-cell embryos, while mbcd-treatment caused the release of msgb5cer into the perivitelline space, decompaction of compacted embryos and even distribution of e-cadherin on the cell surface. in 2-cell embryos lacking e-cadherin, however, the msgb5cer-enriched lipid rafts accumulated heterotopically at sites other than the interface, indicating a close association with e-cadherin in maintaining the integrity of msgb5cer movement. on the other hand, disruption of polymerization of f-actin with ccd dose-dependently inhibited accumulation of msgb5cer at the interfaces, suggesting that the movement of msgb5cer-enriched lipid rafts into interfaces is driven by f-actin. during extensive aggregation of msgb5cer induced by cross-linking with specific antibody, all of the f-actin accumulated at the interfaces.

although the details are still remaining to be clarified and further experiments are clearly needed, these results suggest that msgb5cer-enriched lipid rafts are driven into the furrow by the cortical actin network in close association with e-cadherin and play a role in cytokinesis in the early cleavage stage of mouse preimplantation embryos and our findings in this study should provide clues to the functional role of lipid rafts in early embryogenesis.
