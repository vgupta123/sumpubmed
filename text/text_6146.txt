BACKGROUND
brassica species belonging to the u’s triangle  <cit>  consist three diploids – b. rapa , b. nigra  and b. oleracea , and their allopolyploids – b. juncea , b. napus  and b. carinata . these are major oilseed and vegetable crops that are grown worldwide barring the tropics. this complex of crop species is of critical importance to global food and nutritional security, and extensive breeding programmes are in place to enhance their yield potential. breeding research has received a major fillip from next-generation sequencing efforts, with genomic resources allowing for more involved molecular mapping and marker based introgressions . these genomic resources allow a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind critical qualitative and quantitative traits.

b. napus is a major oilseed crop of europe, canada and china, and has received great attention  <cit> . the two constituent species of b. napus, namely b. rapa and b. oleracea, are important in their own right as they contain important vegetable crops  <cit> . a representative type of b. rapa <cit>  and also of b. oleracea <cit>  has been sequenced. b. juncea, a major oilseed crop of the indian sub-continent, has received much less attention  <cit> . furthermore, little genetic or genomics work has been carried out on b. carinata and b. nigra as they are minor crops. however, they could be important sources of resistance to many biotic and abiotic stresses, and be of use for the improvement of more extensively grown brassica species.

in india, b. juncea is grown on approximately 6– <dig> million hectares of land  <cit> . the crop is well adapted to cultivation in the dry land areas of north-western parts of india, and is grown during the winter season, thus taking advantage of residual soil moisture availability following the end of the rainy season . due to its high yield potential under low water availability, b. juncea is a potential crop for other regions of the world that have low moisture availability and mild winters.

b. juncea has two distinct gene pools: the indian, and the east european gene pool  <cit> . the indian gene pool has narrow genetic diversity  <cit> . despite this limitation, extensive efforts in pure line breeding have led to varieties with a yield potential of around  <dig>  tons/hectare under protective irrigation. the east european gene pool shows more diversity at the molecular level  <cit> . hybrids between indian and east european types are heterotic for yield, with a potential of up to  <dig>  tons/hectare. numerous qualitative and quantitative traits have been mapped in a doubled haploid  population developed from a cross between varuna, a national check variety belonging to the indian gene pool, and heera, a canola quality or ‘00’ line belonging to the east european gene pool . the positive value traits in each of the two gene pools need to be fine mapped, and transferred to the pool with lower value. this will improve the two gene pools and facilitate the development of hybrids that outperform current hybrids in yield and quality.

we have carried out rna-seq of varuna and heera lines and used the sequence data to develop snp markers for genome wide and specific-region fine mapping, following methods described earlier for oleiferous lines of b. rapa <cit> . it is well established that the three diploids of u’s triangle, b. rapa, b. nigra, and b. oleracea evolved through a genome triplication event, described as the b event  <cit> . however, extensive gene fractionation has led to some genes being present as a single copy, some as two paralogues, and some as three paralogues in the diploid genome species  <cit> . as an example, for b. rapa the brad database lists  <dig>  single copy gene models,  <dig>  two copy and  <dig>  three copy paralogous gene models  <cit> . there are adequate snps available in the single-copy gene models of b. rapa, even in closely related lines, for genome wide mapping  <cit> . however, the availability of snps needs to be assessed in the allotetraploid b. juncea. it is expected that most single-copy genes of b. rapa  will have a homoeologue in the b genome. as a consequence, both hsvs  and allele specific snps are required to be identified for the development of co-dominant markers for each locus.

we report that there are enough snps available between varuna and heera to identify homoeologues between a and b genomes, and paralogues within a and b genomes for both genome wide and specific -region fine mapping. contigs obtained from rna-seq data of b. juncea have been separated into a and b genome specific gene models by comparison with the brad database for the a genome and to our unpublished work on the rna-seq of b. nigra for the b genome. the transcriptome based contig assemblies have been used to identify snps, and an extensive molecular map has been developed using dh lines derived from a heera and varuna cross. this map has provided new insights into the arrangement of a to x blocks of a. thaliana <cit>  in the a and b genomes of b. juncea.

comparative mapping between a and c genomes and the model crucifer a. thaliana was first performed in b. napus   <cit> . based on the gene collinearity between a and c genomes in relation to a. thaliana, it was proposed that the a. thaliana genome could be represented as a to x gene blocks  <cit> . each gene block of a. thaliana was shown to be represented as three copies in both the a and c genomes of b. napus, with high levels of collinearity in gene arrangement in the blocks  <cit> . we found similar block triplication in the b genome of b. juncea using intron-polymorphism  markers when comparing block organization in the a and b genomes of b. juncea <cit> . the addition of  <dig> snp markers to the earlier map  <cit>  has allowed identification of new blocks in the b genome in the present study. comparative mapping between the a and b genome reveals that none of the linkage groups  of the two genomes are homoeologous along their entire length, and that there are variations in the fragmentation pattern of some of the blocks. we discuss the implications of the gene block arrangements and block fragmentation patterns discerned in this study to the evolutionary relationship of a and b genomes.

RESULTS
transcriptome assembly
rna isolated from various tissues of the two b. juncea lines heera and varuna, was used for transcriptome sequencing. libraries were sequenced using a genome analyzer iix instrument , with  <dig> , <dig> raw sequence reads obtained for heera and  <dig> , <dig> for varuna. these sequences were filtered for low-quality reads. additionally,  <dig> bases with low quality values were trimmed from the 3′ end of each of the sequences, following parameters described earlier  <cit> . this resulted in  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> paired-end sequences of 70 bp length for heera and varuna, respectively . assembly of the cleaned sequences was carried out using the velvet de novo assembly program at k-mer values ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  at an interval of two  <cit> . the data obtained was evaluated based on average contig length, n <dig> values, and percentage of reads assembled . assembly at a k-mer value of  <dig> was found to be optimal for transcriptome assembly of both heera and varuna. a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs were obtained for heera and varuna, respectively.

identification of a and b genome specific contigs
the assembled contigs contained both paralogues present within the a and b genomes, and homoeologues across the two genomes. these paralogues and homoeologues were separated in a two-step gene identification process based on the proven premise that paralogues within the a and b genomes are more divergent compared with respective homoeologues between the two genomes  <cit> .

in the first step, the assembled contigs of b. juncea lines were searched against protein sequences of b. rapa line chiifu  using the blastx program. contigs showing similarity with proteins recorded in the b. rapa proteome database at an e-value of ≤ 1e− <dig> were grouped against the listed proteins. based on this analysis,  <dig>  b. rapa gene models were found to be represented in the assembled contigs of heera. a similar approach for varuna identified  <dig>  gene models in the brad database in the varuna transcriptome assembly.

in the second step, sequences grouped based on protein similarity were compared at the nucleotide level with b. rapa cds sequences available in the brad database , and to the transcriptome sequences of two b. nigra lines, sangam and ic <dig>  that have been analysed in our laboratory . custom perl scripts enabled contigs to be grouped based on their maximum identity with either a or b genome reference sequences. contigs that showed ≤ 80% sequence identity in ≤ 100 bp sequence stretches were removed from the analysis. at this step, the paralogous and homoeologous contigs could be identified and separated. all contigs showing identity to either the b. rapa line chiifu gene model or its homoeologues in b. nigra, as per the criteria described above, were considered to be part of the a or b genome gene model. for heera,  <dig>  gene models representing the a genome, and  <dig>  representing the b genome were identified. for varuna,  <dig>  and  <dig>  gene models could be identified for the a and b genomes, respectively. gene models were grouped into ‘b. rapa vs heera a genome’, ‘b. nigra vs heera b genome’, ‘b. rapa vs varuna a genome’ and ‘b. nigra vs varuna b genome’; these groups are described in further detail in additional file  <dig>  analysis of the read length of the identified gene models for both heera and varuna revealed that over 70% of the gene models had > 60% coverage in both a and b genomes . approximately 40% of the gene models for the a genome had > 90% coverage. whereas, only 30% of the gene models for the b genome had > 90% coverage .figure  <dig> 
coverage of the assembled gene models in the heera and varuna genomes. assembled gene model coverage in the heera a, heera b, varuna a, and varuna b genomes compared with gene models described for b. rapa in the brad database. more than 70% of identified gene models could be assembled at greater than 60% coverage.



 <dig>  contigs of heera, and  <dig>  contigs of varuna had no similarity to predicted protein sequences reported for b. rapa. the contigs were also checked against the b. rapa genoeme sequences and contigs showing >80% identity in > 100 bp sequence with the b. rapa genome were removed from further analysis. the remaining unique contigs were compared with the b. nigra transcriptome sequences.  <dig>  contigs with high level of identity with the b. nigra transcriptome sequences were identified as b genome specific contigs.

identification of snps between heera and varuna and marker development
of the  <dig>  and  <dig>  a genome specific gene models identified for heera and varuna,  <dig>  gene models had overlapping sequences. similarly, of the  <dig>  and  <dig>  b genome gene models for heera and varuna,  <dig>  gene models had overlapping sequences. the mummer program  <cit>  identified  <dig>  snps between the allelic gene models of the two lines. these included  <dig>  snps specific to the a genome, and  <dig>  snps specific to the b genome.  <dig>  gene models from the a genome and  <dig>  gene models belonging to the b genome were identified with snps . for the a genome  <dig> %  gene models did not show any nucleotide variations between varuna and heera, and for the b genome  <dig> %  gene models were found to be fully conserved. the frequency of snps in the a and b genomes of b. juncea revealed that a genomes of heera and varuna are more variable and therefore, more diverse than the b genomes of the two lines.figure  <dig> 
number of gene models obtained after each step of marker development. a larger number of a genome gene models were identified with snp differences than b genome gene models. at each step of marker development, gene models not meeting the criteria for marker development were removed.



the  <dig>  gene models with snps  were classified into three categories i) unique to the b genome  ii) present as one copy in the a genome and one homoeologue in the b genome,  and iii) more than one paralogue in the a genome and one or more homoeologue in the b genome. further, snps suitable for kaspar technology  <cit>  were identified. this analysis yielded  <dig>  snp containing gene models,  <dig>  from the a genome and  <dig>  from the b genome .

as comparative analysis of the a and b genomes was one of the major objectives of this study, developing markers for the gene models present as a single copy in the a genome that also had a single copy homoeologue in the b genome, was considered the ideal strategy for genome wide linkage analysis, and for studying the comparative organization of a and b genomes. the positions of a genome gene models were checked in the b. rapa database  <cit>  for selecting snp markers that were well dispersed throughout all  <dig> a genome chromosomes, and representating all gene blocks.  <dig>  markers were identified, and these were classified into three categories: i) those developed from a genome gene models and their homoeologues in the b genome  ii) those developed from a genome gene models, but no markers developed from their b genome homoeologues due to lack of polymorphism , and iii) those developed from b genome models which had conserved homoeologues in the a genome . additionally,  <dig> markers were selected from b genome specific gene models to enrich marker coverage of the less explored b genome. the sequences and features of the selected  <dig>  snp markers are provided in additional file  <dig> 

snp marker based mapping in b. juncea
successful kaspar assays could be designed for  <dig>  of the  <dig> in silico selected snp markers. of these,  <dig> were found to be polymorphic between varuna and heera, the parents of the dh mapping population. fifty-two of these markers showed significant deviations from the expected segregation ratios and were not used for mapping. a linkage map was developed using genotyping data of  <dig> snp markers along with  <dig> ip markers developed earlier  <cit> . this linkage map, with  <dig> loci distributed over  <dig> lgs  is given in additional file  <dig>  block arrangement in relation to a. thaliana gene blocks a–x is also provided in the map. the total map length is  <dig>  cm, with an average interval size of  <dig>  cm. constituent a and b genomes showed genetic map lengths of  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm, with  <dig> and  <dig> markers, respectively . all the a genome specific markers mapped on a genome lgs at the expected positions vis-à-vis brad database  <cit> . the b genome markers mapped to the b genome lgs, thereby showing that the identification of a and b genome contigs, described earlier, is largely accurate.

genes involved with glucosinolate content had earlier been mapped on lgs a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  and b <dig> and those involved with erucic acid on lgs a <dig> and b <dig>  <cit> . introgression of low glucosinolate and ‘0’ erucic acid loci from heera into indian types of b. juncea with available markers  <cit>  led to a reduction in yield of the recipient lines, most likely due to linkage drag. therefore, a minimal donor region around these genes needs to be introgressed into the recipient lines to maintain yield potential. the transcriptome data generated in this study was used to analyze mapped loci for the presence of snp containing genes. approximately  <dig> genes, which flanked candidate genes, were selected from the b. rapa reference genome  <cit>  and checked for representation in the transcriptome database and for the presence of snps in the represented genes. approximately 50% of gene models were present in the transcriptome database. for glucosinolate loci on lgs a <dig>  a <dig>  and a <dig> over 30% of gene models around the candidate gene were found to have snps, while for the glucosinolate locus on lg b <dig> 25% of gene models had snps. for low erucic acid locus a <dig> and b <dig>  > 50% gene models were represented in the assembled transcriptome, and approximately 24% and 15%, were marked by snps in the a and b genomes, respectively. we developed  <dig> co-dominant markers for genes around those loci; these could be mapped to corresponding locus positions. information on available genes with snp differences and the developed markers is provided in additional file  <dig> 

gene block arrangement on the a and b genomes of b. juncea
the genome sequence of b. rapa line chiifu has recently been used  <cit>  to position all  <dig> triplicated ancestral blocks  along the  <dig> lgs. the extent of the gene fractionation of each of these triplicated blocks allowed the following classifications: mf <dig> , mf <dig> , and lf   <cit> . we compared the block arrangement on the a genome of b. juncea using snp/ip markers with sequence based arrangements  <cit>  to ascertain the extent of coverage. for b. juncea a genome lgs, a block was identified even when a single marker of that block could be mapped to regions where a block had been identified in the b. rapa reference genome  <cit> . based on this criterion, we could place most of the blocks defined in the reference genome of b. rapa onto our map. gene collinearity and block arrangement patterns were the same in the a genome of b. juncea vis-à-vis the a genome of b. rapa. blocks that could not be identified in this study were as follows: a small block wa on lg a <dig>  block d at the distal end of lg a <dig>  block hb on lg a <dig>  blocks la, lb, ob, and mb on a <dig>  and block c on a <dig> . on lg a <dig>  blocks b, t, and s could not be separated as per the reference genome. additional markers will help to identify some of these minor blocks.figure  <dig> 
comparative block arrangement in the lgs of the a and b genomes of
b. juncea
.  lgs a1*–a10* ; a1–a <dig>   b1*–b8* ; b1–b <dig> . for the a genome, blocks that could not be identified in relation to the reference genome are highlighted by darker shading. for the b genome, newly identified blocks are shown in bold, and blocks identified in only one of the two maps being compared are highlighted by darker shading.



we identified  <dig> blocks in the b genome . blocks in the b genome were marked only when two or more block specific markers were mapped in that region. as the coverage of the a genome in this study is fairly extensive and accurate, it is likely that the block coverage obtained for the b genome is substantial. a comparison was made with the block arrangement suggested earlier for the b genomes of b. juncea <cit>  and b. nigra <cit> . a number of new blocks were identified . on the top end of lg b <dig>  where no blocks were placed in the earlier map  <cit> , block c, and a few gene markers from the b, t, s, and u blocks  were identified. blocks l, w, and x were also identified on lg b <dig>  on lg b <dig>  blocks o and t, which were not discerned earlier, and block w which was previously reported in b. nigra, were identified. the arrangement of the blocks on lg b <dig> remained the same, with the exception of an additional p block. on lg b <dig>  there seemed to be an insertion of s, t, and n blocks within the e block, and the position of the s block was different to that reported for b. nigra. in lg b <dig>  blocks s and i were identified. however, block c, which was reported in b. nigra <cit> , was not identified. a number of additional blocks namely l, k, v, c, h have been placed on lg b <dig>  and block b has been identified on lg b <dig>  the presence of block u between a and b blocks on lg b <dig> reported in b. nigra was not confirmed. block l has been added on lg b <dig>  and blocks t and x have been identified within block u. block v, previously identified in the b. nigra map  <cit>  and now classified as wa  <cit> , could also be placed on lg b <dig> of b. juncea.

comparison of gene block arrangement and block fragmentation patterns between the a and b genomes of b. juncea
to compare the block arrangements between lgs of the a and b genomes of b. juncea, we first identified the homoeologous blocks between the two genomes. this was possible because some snp markers represented gene models present as a single copy in both a and b genomes. blocks were only marked as homoeologous if a minimum of two snp/ip markers from the same block region were placed on both genomes. as snp markers were developed from gene sequences with gene ids known in both b. rapa and a. thaliana, the gene content within the identified homoeologous gene blocks could be compared with the block boundaries defined in a. thaliana <cit>  to study block fragmentation patterns between the homoeologous blocks in the a and b genomes.

the comparative arrangement of the homoeologous blocks and block fragmentation patterns of all b. juncea lgs, along with the markers used in this study, are shown in figure  <dig>  additional file  <dig>  and are described below.figure  <dig> 
block homoeology between the a and b genomes of
b. juncea. gene blocks on the eight lgs of the b genome  that show homoeology to corresponding blocks on the a genome lgs are shown by the connecting lines. blocks showing variations in their fragmentation pattern in the b genome are shown in bold with an asterisk. genomic blocks assigned to the subgenomes lf , mf <dig>  and mf <dig>  are colour coded as in the previous b. rapa study  <cit> .



lg b <dig> gene blocks were homoeologous to blocks spread over four a genome lgs, namely a <dig> , a <dig> , a <dig> , and a <dig> . the blocks at the top end of this lg showed gene collinearity with lg a <dig>  but could not be separated into distinct blocks. in the middle section of lg b <dig>  the contiguous block arrangement l-w-q-x showed homoeology to a similar arrangement on lg a <dig>  with all blocks being from subgenome mf <dig>  no changes were observed in the gene order and orientation of blocks f and d, which showed homoeology to lg a <dig>  the second f block on this lg showed homoeology to the f block of lg a <dig> belonging to sub-genome mf <dig> 

as with ip markers  <cit> , the gene blocks on lg b <dig> were homoeologous to lg a <dig> , and a <dig> . single markers from block p on lg a <dig> and from block n on lg a <dig> also suggested the presence of these blocks on this lg.

the block order n-m-p-o-p-j-w-r on lg b <dig> showed homoeology with blocks from three a genome lgs: a <dig> , a <dig> , and a <dig> . of the two p blocks on lg b <dig>  the one next to the m block showed gene collinearity with the p block on lg a <dig>  and the other with that from lg a <dig>  block o was a mix of gene markers from lgs a <dig> and a <dig>  with the upper half showing gene collinearity with the lg a <dig> o block, and the lower half with the lg a <dig> o block. within the block order r-w-j-p-o, which shares homoeology with lg a <dig>  one marker each for w and i blocks was located between j and p blocks in lg b <dig> , suggesting that these two blocks may also be present on lg b <dig> 

lg b <dig> was previously shown to be homoeologous to lg a <dig> along its entire length  <cit> . in this study it was shown to contain gene blocks homoeologous to five a genome lgs: a <dig> , a <dig> , a <dig> , a <dig> , and a <dig> . this lg is highly chimeric with four of the blocks  showing variations in block fragmentation pattern vis-à-vis their homoeologous blocks on the a genome lgs. block e was observed to be disrupted due to the presence of blocks s, t, and n within this block. block a on lg b <dig>  present as a complete block as defined in a. thaliana , is present on two different lgs in the a genome: lg a <dig>  and lg a <dig> . similarly block s, which is disrupted in the a genome to sa  on lg a <dig> and sb  on lg a <dig>  is present as one unit on lg b <dig>  block x, broken into three fragments in the a genome, xa  on lg a <dig>  xb  on lg a <dig>  and xc  on lg a <dig> is present as a combined xb and xc block on lg b <dig>  gene markers from block xa mapped onto lg b <dig>  block n on lg b <dig> had gene markers from at3g51870–at3g <dig> of subgenome mf <dig> of lg a <dig> and at3g52770–at3g <dig> from lg a <dig> belonging to subgenome mf <dig> .

lg b <dig> had an f block homoeologous to the f block of lg a <dig>  however, blocks j-i-s on this lg had homoeology to a similar block arrangement on lg a <dig>  in our earlier research  <cit>  lgs a5/b <dig> were shown to be homoeologous along their entire length. however, evidence from the present study showed that lg b <dig> had homoeologous blocks from two lgs of the a genome.

lg b <dig>  which was previously shown to be homoeologous to lg a <dig>  <cit> , had homoeology to blocks present on three different lgs, a <dig> , a <dig> , and a <dig> . the block arrangements q-k-v and l-k-v-c-d-h showed gene collinearity along the entire stretch in the two genomes. the a and b blocks of the arrangement a-b-c on lg b <dig> showed continuous sequence collinearity with a. thaliana genes at1g07640–at1g <dig>  whereas a and b blocks of similar arrangement in lg a <dig> of the a genome had block a spanning a. thaliana genes at1g07640–at1g <dig> and block b from at1g19850–at1g <dig>  block c on lg b <dig> had markers from at1g47960–at1g <dig> , as did lg a <dig>  according to sequence collinearity, the arrangement of these blocks in the b genome was ab-b-cb, as compared with cb-ab-ba in the a genome.

lg b <dig> had homoeology with gene blocks on lgs a <dig> , a <dig> , and a <dig> . block b, in the arrangement a-b-u, showed sequence collinearity with a. thaliana genes at1g19850-at1g <dig> on lg b <dig>  whereas the homoeologous b on lg a <dig> has been reported to be present as four segments, ba, bb, bc, and bd, which are disrupted by other blocks   <cit> . in the arrangement a-b-u, only genes from segment ba are present along with complete a and u blocks on lg a <dig>  another b block observed on this lg showed homoeology to b blocks present on lgs a <dig>  and a <dig>  in the a genome . block e on lg b <dig>  which showed collinearity to the e block on lg a <dig>  is also composed of e blocks belonging to subgenomes lf and mf <dig>  as in the a genome.

lg b <dig> is highly chimeric, and has the maximum number of blocks. blocks on this lg show homoeology with blocks of four lgs from the a genome, a <dig> , a <dig> , a <dig> , and a <dig> . three of the blocks show differences in their fragmentation pattern in the a and b genomes. the block arrangements r-w, l-w, and t-n-x from lgs a <dig>  a <dig>  and a <dig> respectively, showed gene collinearity along their entire stretch in the two genomes. the block arrangement g-h-i on lg b <dig> had gene markers from three a genome lgs: block g from a3; block h from a <dig>  a <dig>  and a9; and block i from a <dig>  the gene order in this block arrangement in the b genome showed continuous sequence collinearity with a. thaliana genes at2g05170–at2g26660s. block q on lg b <dig> had markers present from a. thaliana genes at5g23030–at5g <dig>  which were also present as qa on lg a <dig> and qb on lg a3; both belonging to subgenome lf. similarly, block u on lg b <dig> had gene markers from a. thaliana genes at4g16250–at4g <dig>  which were present as ua on lg a <dig> and ub on lg a <dig> in the a genome. the u block on b <dig> was observed to be disrupted differently due to the presence of blocks t, n, x, and q from lg a <dig> within this block, with a. thaliana orthologues at4g16250–at4g <dig> forming part a, and at4g24190–at4g <dig> part b.

discussion
there were two major objectives for this study on rna-seq for snp discovery in b. juncea – an assessment of the availability of snp markers for general mapping and specific -region fine mapping, and analysis of comparative genome organization between the constituent a and b genomes. the frequency of snps in the lines heera and varuna revealed that the a genome of the two lines is more diverse than the b genome. in our earlier b. rapa rna-seq study we found that there was a very high snp frequency between b. rapa vegetable and oleiferous types, and between oleiferous lines of ssp. trilocularis and ssp. oleifera <cit> . low variability was found only between two b. rapa ssp. trilocularis types yspb <dig> and tetralocular, both of which are yellow sarson types. our results demonstrate that only a limited variability of b. rapa types have been captured in the allopolyploid b. juncea lines of the two gene pools .

the available heera and varuna snps allow both general and fine-mapping to be successfully performed using snp markers. it was possible to carry out fine-mapping of regions containing the high value traits of low erucic and low glucosinolate in the heera line. we made use of co-dominant snp markers marking both snps and hsvs. however, many more of the genes in the region can be covered by gene-specific dominant markers . this information will help in converting major indian gene pool lines into ‘canola’ quality or ‘00’ lines through marker based introgressions.

as rna-seq based markers are gene specific, the limited number of snp markers developed in this study used in conjunction with gene based ip markers provided new insights into the arrangement of homoeologous blocks on the lgs of a and b genomes of b. juncea. the u’s triangle species have gone through two events of polyploidization – b and u <cit> . the b event gave rise to the three diploids – b. rapa , b. nigra , and b. oleracea . the much more recent u event led to the development of the three allotetraploids – b. juncea , a. napus , and b. carinata . the u event is characterised by suppression of pairing between homoeologous chromosomes  <cit> , and a maintaining of the gene block arrangement of the parental diploid species. evolution of the three diploid genomes a, b, and c is much more complicated. these diploid species are derivatives of a genome triplication event of an n =  <dig> karyotype ancestor  <cit> . this is strongly supported by triplication of each gene block  identified in the ancestral crucifer karyotype  or proto-calepineae karyotype   <cit>  in the a, b, and c genomes. genome triplication has been observed in many other taxa of tribe brassiceae by in situ hybridization  <cit>  and genetic mapping .

the following evolutionary aspects are well established for brassica species

b. rapa sequencing data has shown that a–x blocks of a. thaliana are present in triplicate in the a genome. based on gene fractionation, the three genomes that exist today in b. rapa have been classified as mf <dig>  mf <dig>  and lf  <cit> . these are represented as x, y, and z progenitor genomes, respectively.

it has been suggested that the b event hexaploidization occurred in two steps – first the formation of a tetraploid  followed by the entry of the z genome, which is the least fractionated in b. rapa in terms of gene loss  <cit> .

paralogous genes of x, y, and z genomes that contribute to the a genome, and x′, y′, and z′ genomes of the b genome are more divergent than homoeologous genes across x-x′, y-y′, and z-z′  <cit> . synonymous substitution rates between x, y, and z paralogues show an evolutionary divergence time of ~ <dig> mya, and between the x-x′, y-y′, and z-z′ homoeologues, a divergence time of ~ <dig> mya. the x, y, and z progenitor genomes  evolved from a brassica ancestor, which split from a. thaliana approximately  <dig> mya  <cit> .

very strong evidence for a minimum of two reciprocal crosses for the b event of polyploidization comes from the presence of two distinct plastid lineages in the tribe brassiceae – rapa/oleracea  lineage and nigra/sinapis  lineage . the plastid genome of the two lineages diverged ~ <dig> mya, a time scale similar to the divergence of the x, y, and z genomes that constitute the genome of present day diploid species of the u’s triangle. phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> brassica species, based on plastid genome intergenic region sequences, revealed eight plastid lineages in the tribe brassicaceae <cit> . therefore, the b event could have involved multiple crosses between divergent progenitor genomes.



we looked at the a and b nuclear genome organization to answer the following questions:-

were a and b genomes independent hexaploidization events, or were they derived from a single hexaploidization?

did chromosome rearrangements take place in the xxyy tetraploid, and again when the z genome entered to complete the b event? or was xxyy a strict allotetraploid, and chromosome changes occurred only after crosses with z genome species?



comparison of collinearity between the a, b, and c genomes clearly show that while simple translocations and inversions could explain the divergence of a and c genome  <cit> , the same cannot be claimed for b genome . with the exception of lgs b <dig> and b <dig>  which can be derived from two lgs of the a genome, gene block arrangements on all other lgs of the b genome show blocks homoeologous to blocks from three or more lgs of the a genome . in addition to the variations observed in the genomic block architecture, analysis of gene collinearity within the gene blocks of the a and b genomes vis-à-vis a. thaliana showed variations in block fragmentation patterns between the two genomes. some gene blocks, like a, b, h, q, s, u, and x are disrupted into two or more sub-blocks in the a genome, but present as complete blocks in the b genome . similarly, genes from blocks such as b, f, q, t, and u are represented on two different lgs in the b genome, but present as complete blocks in the a genome. four gene block associations resulting from recombination between homoeologous segments have been reported in the a genome  <cit> , of these only e/e could be located in the b genome. two block associations unique to the b genome were identified, o/o on lg b <dig> and n/n on lg b <dig> figure  <dig> 
chromosome collinearity comparison among a, b, and c genomes. a and c genome collinearity is based on a b. napus study  <cit> . lf , mf <dig> , and mf <dig>  blocks are colour coded as in the previous b. rapa study  <cit> . the figure shows that the block arrangement pattern between the a and b genomes is much more complex than that between the a and c genomes.



the presence of two copies of the block association e/e  on lgs b <dig> and b <dig>  appears to be a unique feature of the b genome, and is not observed in either the a or c genomes. some parts of blocks such as a, n, and u were duplicated on two different lgs in the b genome . another uniqueness of the b genome is the presence of the block arrangement g-h-i on lg b8; this showed continuous sequence collinearity with a similar arrangement in a. thaliana, whereas the h block of the similar arrangement in the a genome is fragmented into three sub-blocks, which are present on different lgs, with blocks g and h belonging to subgenome mf <dig> and block i to subgenome lf . similarly, blocks a and b of block arrangement a-b-c on lg b <dig> showed continuous sequence collinearity with a. thaliana. the presence of such contiguous arrangements in the b genome is likely to be due to their presence in one of the subgenomes that took part in the hexaploidization event.

the comparison of a and b genomes in this study does not completely rule out the two genomes being outcomes of independent meiotic events from a common hexaploid ancestor. however, the presence of extensive differences in the nuclear genome organization of a and b genomes, coupled with the well-established fact that the two genomes belong to two distinct plastid lineages, makes the hypothesis of a and b genomes being outcomes of independent hexaploidization events the most plausible  <cit> .

despite a large number of unique block associations in the b genome, some block associations, including r-w-e-o-p , r-w-j-i-p-o , l-k-v-d-h , and a-b-u  are conserved in a, b, and c genomes . of the common block motifs shared by all three genomes, r-w-e-o-p, r-w-j-i-p-o and a-b-u have also been observed in the related species raphanus sativus and sinapis alba. since the rapa/oleracea lineage also includes r. sativus, and the nigra lineage includes s. alba, the presence of common motifs in both lineages indicates that these block arrangements took place before reciprocal crosses led to the evolution of the two plastid lineages. additionally, we observed that all blocks in these motifs belong to subgenomes mf <dig> and mf <dig> in all three genomes, indicating that these arrangements had possibly occurred in the ancestral tetraploid , which provided mf <dig> and mf <dig> genomes for the a and b genomes.

thus the most plausible hypothesis is that a and b genomes have evolved from independent hexaploidization events  <cit> , and that the tetraploid  underwent chromosomal reshuffling and some gene fractionation before hybridization with the z genome, which is the least fractionated sub-genome present in the a and b genomes.

CONCLUSIONS
rna-seq of the b. juncea lines varuna  and heera  provided a large number of snps for general and specific -region fine mapping. large numbers of snps were identified between the a and b genomes, and the a genome was found to be more divergent than the b genome of b. juncea. a linkage map, developed using snp and ip markers, identified many new gene blocks in the b genome. a number of genes were marked with co-dominant snp markers around loci controlling low glucosinolate  and low erucic acid  traits. this will allow the future transfer of ‘00’ traits from heera into indian lines. comparative analysis of gene block arrangement and genome fragmentation patterns revealed that the constituent a and b genomes of b. juncea are diverse, and supported the hypothesis that the two genomes evolved from independent hexaploidization events. genic snp markers will help development of physical maps for b. juncea and b. nigra, and in assembling the b. nigra genome.
