BACKGROUND
cd <dig>  an extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer , is a plasma membrane-bound glycoprotein that functions as an adhesion molecule. it is expressed at high levels on a variety of malignant human cancers and some immortalized cell lines. our laboratory previously identified a novel hepatoma associated antigen named hab18g, which was obtained by cloning a human hepato-cellular carcinoma  cdna library and screening with the anti-hepatoma monoclonal antibody hab <dig>  <cit> . the nucleotide acid and amino acid sequences of hab18g are identical to those of cd <dig>  <cit> . hab18g/cd <dig> was highly expressed by hcc cells and tissues, and increased hab18g/cd <dig> expression stimulated both the growth and invasiveness of hcc cells, much as cd <dig> functions in other cancer cells  <cit> .

the acquisition of resistance to anoikis, a form of apoptosis triggered by loss or alteration of cell-cell or cell-matrix anchorage, is critical for the survival of cells in tumor progression and suspension growth used in engineering. resistance to anoikis is emerging as a hallmark of metastatic cancer cells, important in tumor progression because it increases survival times in the absence of cell anchorage, facilitating migration and reattachment, and therefore increasing the probability of metastasis  <cit> . furthermore, acquisition of anoikis resistance is required for cells used in engineering during adaptation to suspension culture and spheroid growth.

more recently, cd <dig> has been reported as an anoikis suppressor, promoting anchorage-independent growth by stimulating hyaluronan production  <cit>  and regulating the anoikis signal pathway by upregulating bim  <cit> . however, it is not clear whether the role of cd <dig> in anoikis resistance is related to cell adhesion, which is a basic function of this molecule in addition to its role in stimulating matrix metalloproteinase  secretion  <cit> . different bioactive epitopes of cd <dig> involved in regulating cell adhesion have been identified  <cit> . cd <dig> has also been reported to participate in forming compacted cell aggregates by regulating fibronectin matrix assembly  <cit>  and cell-cell adhesion  <cit> . the binding of cd <dig> mab to cd <dig> may mimic natural ligand-receptor binding and induce homotypic u <dig> monocytic cell aggregation via the lfa-1/icam- <dig> pathway  <cit> . in contrast, cho reported that antibodies to cd <dig> are potent inhibitors of homotypic u <dig> aggregation induced via cd <dig> ligation  <cit> . because the establishment/maintenance of cell-cell contacts is considered an important environmental condition for physiological resistance to anoikis, we hypothesized that cd <dig> may confer anoikis resistance by mediating cell-cell adhesion. unfortunately, direct evidence for the role of cd <dig> in mediating cell-cell contacts and anoikis resistance is very limited and even self-contradictory. furthermore, it is not clear whether cd <dig> is directly involved in cell adhesion either as an adhesion signal transmitting molecule or a regulator.

the aim here was to explore whether hab18g/cd <dig> is involved in forming cell-cell contacts, and whether this contributed to its role in regulating anoikis resistance. a transformed cell line, human embryonic kidney   <dig>  was chosen as the model because our previous results confirmed that these cells express hab18g/cd <dig>  <cit> . we also acquired an anoikis-resistant subpopulation  from the anoikis-sensitive parental hek <dig> cells. together, these two cell types provide an ideal model for exploring the role of hab18g/cd <dig> as a cell-cell adhesion molecule preventing anoikis. our results show that hab18g/cd <dig> cell-cell contacts confer anoikis resistance and this function also involves e-cadherin expression in hek293ar cell spheroids.

RESULTS
anoikis-resistant hek293ar cells survive anoikis by the formation of cell-cell contacts
to explore the role of cell-cell contacts in preventing anoikis, we generated a subpopulation  with an anoikis-resistant phenotype derived from hek <dig> cells using sequential cycles of adhesion and suspension culture  <cit> . upon detachment, the apoptotic ratio in hek293ar cells was lower than in the parental cells, as shown by quantifying the proportions in sub-g <dig> by flow cytometry . when hek293ar cells were cultured in suspension for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days, the mean sub-g <dig> proportions were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> %, respectively, with little change in the apoptotic ratio . moreover, this subpopulation maintained the anoikis resistance phenotype in vitro for  <dig> months . additionally, after ~6- <dig> h suspension culture, the hek293ar cells spontaneously and gradually formed cell-cell contacts and generated multi-cellular spheroids that could still grow as adhesion cultures, whereas the parental hek <dig> cells did not . ultrastructural examination demonstrated that the suspended spheroids comprised many single cells. in each spheroid, chromatin masses of moderate electron density were dispersed in the nuclei, and the nucleoli were conspicuous . cells within the multi-cellular spheroids adhered laterally to each other through diverse specialized intercellular junctions . pretreatment with edta solution to disrupt calcium-dependent cell-cell contacts also disrupted the adhesions and caused massive dna fragmentation in hek293ar cells, as shown by tunel assay . interestingly, single cells detached from the aggregates gave more intense tunel staining . in contrast, tunel assays and ultrastructural examination demonstrated that hek <dig> cells clearly underwent anoikis . it was previously reported that cell-cell contacts prevent anoikis in primary human colonic epithelial cells  <cit> . the present results also suggest that adjacent hek293ar epithelial cells form cell-cell contacts, suppressing anoikis under matrix-deficient conditions.

hab18g/cd <dig> promotes hek293ar cell survival in suspension by mediating cell-cell contacts
we next explored whether hab18g/cd <dig> was involved in hek293ar cell spheroid survival by mediating cell-cell contacts. hab18g/cd <dig> expression was compared between hek293ar and hek <dig> cells in suspension culture. hek293ar cells expressed significantly more hab18g/cd <dig> than the parental cells after  <dig> h . positive immunofluorescence staining for cd <dig> was restricted to the cell-cell contacts of hek293ar . these results may imply a correlation between hab18g/cd147expression and cell-cell contacts-directed anoikis resistance, as the level of hab18g/cd <dig> expression was similar in both cell types in adhesion culture . to obtain further insight into this correlation, hek293ar cells were treated with hab18g/cd <dig> sirna in adhesion culture, and apoptosis and cell-cell contacts formation were determined in suspension culture. when hab18g/cd <dig> expression was reduced by ~70% , hek293ar cells underwent anoikis with a sub-g <dig> proportion of  <dig>  ±  <dig> % . cell-cell contacts formation was totally inhibited after suspension, whereas the control cells formed multicellular aggregates after as little as  <dig> h in suspension . these results indicate that hab18g/cd <dig> confers anoikis resistance of hek293ar cells to anoikis by mediating cell-cell contacts formation.

cell-cell contact-directed survival in suspension involves e-cadherin
upon detachment, anchorage-independent ewing sarcoma cells suppressed anoikis through a pathway involving e-cadherin-dependent cell-cell adhesion  <cit> . thus we explored whether e-cadherin was also involved in suppressing anoikis by mediating cell-cell adhesion in hek293ar cells. as anticipated, increased e-cadherin expression was confirmed in hek293ar cells after  <dig> h suspension culture , and positive staining was partly located around the cell-cell contacts . also, no significant expression of e-cadherin in completely suspended parental hek <dig> cells or in the initially suspended hek293ar cells was found by immunofluorescence. a reasonable explanation could be that e-cadherin expression decreases dramatically upon cell-cell detachment  <cit> . in addition, a 70-80% reduction of e-cadherin expression by sirna , as determined by western blotting, totally inhibited cell-cell contacts formation  and decreased the degree of cell aggregation with 70-80%, scored as described in methods. knockdown of e-cadherin led to a marked increase in the mean sub-g <dig> proportion and a little shifted peaks in flow cytometric histogram , and it also decreased the cellular dna content via fluorescent dye binding determined with a cyquant® nf cell proliferation assay kit , which is closely proportional to cell number. these results suggest that cell-cell contacts formation and anoikis resistance in hek293ar cells may also be mediated by e-cadherin.

hab18g/cd <dig> mediates cell-cell contacts and anoikis resistance through e-cadherin cell-cell contacts
as hab18g/cd <dig> and e-cadherin are both related to cell-cell contact-directed survival of hek293ar cells in suspension, they may be functional connected. to test this hypothesis, we investigated the relationship between these two molecules by rnai. figs. 4a, b and 4c show that e-cadherin expression decreased dramatically in hab18g/cd <dig> sirna-treated hek293ar cells according to immunofluorescence staining density  and western blotting . interestingly, with time after hab18g/cd <dig> sirna treatment, cell-cell contacts and spheroids gradually disrupted . in contrast, blocking of e-cadherin binding by an anti-e-cadherin and inhibition of cell-cell contacts with edta showed no significant effect on hab18g/cd <dig> expression at the single cell level according to immunofluorescence staining , although the degree of cell aggregation was decreased in suspension culture . furthermore, treatment of hek293ar cells with e-cadherin sirna under adhesion conditions did not alter the level of hab18g/cd <dig> expression of hek293ar in suspension . together, these results indicate that the effect of hab18g/cd <dig> on cell-cell adhesion and anoikis suppression is mediated by e-cadherin.

pi3k pathway is involved in the cell-cell mediated resistance to anoikis
the ras-erk1/ <dig> or pi3k/akt pathway is involved in e-cadherin or hab18g/cd147-mediated cell adhesion and survival  <cit> . to determine the situation, we investigated whether these two pathways were involved in cell-cell contact-directed survival in suspension. hek293ar spheroids were treated with ly <dig>  or pd <dig> . as shown in figs. 6a, b, ly <dig>  inhibited the cell-cell contacts formation and decreased the degree of cell aggregation in a dose-dependent manner, but not pd <dig>  tunel assay showed that the ly <dig>  treatment resulted in positive staining of tunel in hek293ar cells , but pd <dig>  did not. additionally, ly <dig>  decreased relative fluorescent intensity indicating the cellular dna content in a dose-dependent manner  and this result indicated that ly <dig> treatment decreased the cell number of hek293ar in suspension in a dose-dependent manner, as the cellular dna content via fluorescent dye binding is closely proportional to cell number based on the instruction of the assay kit . in contrast, pd <dig> did not significantly affect the relative fluorescent intensity even at  <dig> μmol/l . these results indicate that pi3k pathway inhibition suppresses cell-cell contacts formation and results in decrease of cell number in suspended hek293ar cells.

discussion
anoikis resistance is a key to the survival of cells in malignant transformation and metastasis  <cit> . it may also be a key to the adaptation of cells to suspension culture and spheroids growth used in engineering. for epithelial cells, suppression of anoikis upon detachment seems to be induced when cell-cell contacts are formed. for example, cadherin-mediated homotypic interactions maintain the survival of human prostate carcinoma du- <dig> cells in the absence of extracellular matrix  attachments  <cit> . also, disruption of e-cadherin cell-cell contacts showed more important for suppressing anoikis of normal enterocytes after detachment from villus epithelium, as compared to cell-ecm disruption  <cit> . growth as spheroids renders tumor cells less sensitive to exogenous apoptotic stimuli, and spheroids have greater drug resistance than the corresponding monolayers  <cit> ; and some cells used in engineering also grow as spheroids in suspension. thus, elucidating the mechanisms by which spheroids survive through cell-cell contacts has potentially profound value for understanding survival mechanism of such cells and may also be applied to the control of growth of cells used in biomedical engineering. however, much less is known about how survival pathways are activated under anchorage-independent matrix-deficient conditions in these cells.

recently, marieb et al. found that the adhesion molecule cd <dig> promotes anchorage-independent, hyaluronan-dependent growth of human breast carcinoma cells  <cit> . cd <dig> is also reported to regulate cell-matrix adhesion  <cit> . however, it is not clear whether cd147-mediated cell-cell contact has a role in anoikis resistance or the growth of spheroids of cells used in engineering. using our sophisticated model, which we established from anoikis-resistant hek293ar and the parental hek <dig> cells, we found that hab18g/cd <dig> cell-cell adhesion suppresses anoikis in an e-cadherin-dependent manner. in addition, we have shown that cell-cell adhesion-based survival signals arising from adjacent hek292ar cells may inhibit anoikis in a pi3k/akt-dependent manner . in all, our results indicate that hab18g/cd147-mediated cell-cell contacts mediate anoikis resistance specifically through an e-cadherin-dependent pathway, and that anoikis suppression mediated by cell-cell contacts in hek293ar cells involves the pi3k/akt pathway.

although the data suggest that elevated hab18g/cd <dig> expression is correlated with the progression and invasion potentials of human hepatoma cells  <cit> , the role of hab18g/cd147-mediated cell-cell contacts in acquiring resistance to anoikis remains obscure. earlier evidence suggested that cd <dig> promotes cancer cell survival by regulating intercellular contacts and inhibiting anoikis  <cit> ; in that study, cells transfected with the cd <dig> gene and expressing different levels of cd <dig> were used. in our study, we first found evidence that elevated endogenous expression of hab18g/cd <dig> contributes to cell-cell adhesion and subsequently confers resistance to anoikis under suspension conditions . our anoikis-resistant hek293ar cell model would be more suitable for investigating cell-cell contact-directed anoikis suppression, since it is closer to the natural in vivo status of physiological models and cells used in engineering. in addition, owing to the use of hek <dig> cells in biotechniques, our cell model and the elucidation of the cell spheroid mechanism may be relevant to bioengineering.

cell-cell contact-triggered cell survival also involves anti-apoptotic signalling through e-cadherin-, src-, and pi3k/akt-dependent pathways  <cit> . for instance, e- cadherin, a classical cadherin that promotes calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion, suppresses anoikis in squamous carcinoma and normal proximal tubular cells  <cit> . in ewing tumor spheroids, e-cadherin cell-cell contacts may activate the erbb <dig> rtk signal pathway  <cit> . homophilic e-cadherin binding is also involved in activating akt kinase, which ultimately inhibits caspase- <dig> activity and prevents anoikis  <cit> . we found that e-cadherin expression was elevated in the anoikis-resistant hek293ar cells  after  <dig> h suspension culture. also, high levels of e-cadherin expression inhibited anoikis by mediating cell-cell contacts upon cell-matrix detachment, which was required by hab18g/cd <dig>  functioning as an anoikis suppressor. likewise, knockdown of hab18g/cd <dig> disrupted cell-cell contacts and anoikis ensued . in addition, as comparison of e-cadherin expression between the hek293ar and its parental cell focused on the contrast of this protein after  <dig> h suspension culture, this time course should be long enough for the stabilisation of ligated e-cadherin and this may preclude the e-cadherin increase from the stabilisation of ligated e-cadherin at sites of adhesion and therefore help in valuing the function of this protein accurately in anoikis resistance. an important conclusion is that hab18g/cd <dig> may have a more prominent role in suppressing anoikis than e-cadherin, and e-cadherin may be a downstream effector of cd <dig> in the development of anoikis resistance, although the precise mechanisms by which e-cadherin complexes are remodeled and degraded remain to be determined.

the pronounced effect of hab18g/cd <dig> knockdown on cell survival may result from a direct decrease in e-cadherin expression and subsequent loss of cell-cell contacts . in addition, our more recent data have shown that ly <dig>  a specific pi3k inhibitor, significantly reduced the effect of hab18g/cd <dig> on cell adhesion and metastatic invasion  of human hepatoma cells  <cit> . e-cadherin, predominantly expressed at cell-cell contacts, is stably bound to the pi3k complex; this protein expression is necessary and sufficient for activating the pi3k/akt pathway  <cit> . we have also demonstrated that hab18g/cd147-mediated cell-cell contacts can mediate cell survival under anchorage-independent condition in an e-cadherin-dependent manner; and that cell-cell contacts mediated resistance of anoikis involves pi3k pathway in our model. based on all these results, we may, at least in part, infer that hab18g/cd <dig> conferred anoikis resistance through e-cadherin mediated cell-cell contacts, which may activate the pi3k/akt pathway and promote spheroids formation by establishing cell-cell contacts. however, we do not wish to imply hab18g/cd <dig> or e-cadherin stimulates survival via pi3k stimulation, since this does not occur directly in response to cd <dig> and e-cadherin upregulation in our model. and how hab18g/cd <dig> affects e-cadherin expression needs further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
using a sophisticated anoikis-resistant model that we have developed reveals a novel role of hab18g/cd <dig> in cell-cell adhesion leading to anoikis resistance and cell spheroid growth. our results support the observation that hab18g/cd <dig> confers anoikis resistance through e-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts; and that cell-cell mediated resistance of anoikis has been shown to involve the pi3k pathway. as cell- contact-directed survival is important for tumor cells in metastasis and invasion, these results should be relevant to a bitter understanding of the cell survival mechanism seen in tumor progression. furthermore, with the exception of cells of lymphoid origin, most cultures of mammalian cells used in bioengineering need to be adapted to suspension conditions of growth and also capable of forming spheroids in suspension for survival, these results are also relevant to our understanding of the survival mechanism of such cells.
