BACKGROUND
methylation is an enzymatic modification of dna that occurs post replication and epigenetically contributes to transcriptional regulation. many important biological processes are modulated by dna methylation including regulation of gene expression  <cit> , development  <cit> , and control of retrotransposon elements  <cit> . dna methylation is also responsible for maintenance of chromatin structure  <cit>  and inactivation of chromosome x in female mammals  <cit> . dna methyltransferases  catalyze dna methylation, which in humans and higher eukaryotes occurs predominantly at the c5-cytosine  in cpg dinucleotides  <cit> . dna methylation can silence genes by directly blocking the interaction of transcription factors to their regulatory sequences  <cit> . dna methylation can also attract methyl-binding protein, which recruits histone deacetylases and histone methyltransferases, resulting in an inactive chromatin structure  <cit> . defects in establishing or maintaining dna methylation patterns are associated with a number of human diseases and conditions such as cancers  <cit> , schizophrenia  <cit> , and aging  <cit> .

entamoeba histolytica is a protozoan parasite and the causative agent of amebic dysentery and amebic liver abscesses. these diseases result in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in developing countries, where an estimated  <dig> million cases of invasive amebiasis result in up to  <dig>  deaths annually  <cit> . an active dna methyltransferase  of the dna methyltransferase  <dig>  family has been characterized in e. histolytica  <cit>  and ribosomal dna  <cit>  and a heat shock protein  <dig>  gene  <cit>  have been shown to be methylated in this parasite. additionally, an amebic protein which binds preferentially to methylated dna has recently been identified   <cit> . importantly e. histolytica strain hm-1:imss grown with 5-azacytidine , a potent inhibitor of dna methyltransferase, had been shown to have significantly reduced virulence in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . furthermore, the decrease in parasite virulence was reversible upon removal of the drug, indicating that drug exposure likely did not cause significant permanent mutations in the e. histolytica genome sequence  <cit> . on the other hand, over expression of ehmeth in e. histolytica resulted in accumulation of multinucleated cells, up regulation of heat shock protein  <dig>  expression, and resistance to oxidative stress  <cit> . all these findings suggest that dna methylation has important biological functions in this parasite.

information on the effects of dna methylation in simple eukaryotes is relatively limited. 5-azac treatment of trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes in culture induces active cell proliferation as evident from an increase in the cell number and  thymidine incorporation into dna  <cit> . dna methylation increases during development of dictyostelium discoideum and dna methyltransferase mutant cells exhibit morphological defects in late development, indicating that dna methylation has a regulatory role in dictyostelium development  <cit> . in ciliates, cytosine methylation occurs in transposon-like elements in the course of macronuclear differentiation in stylonychia lemnae  <cit>  and 5-azac treatment induces encystment in colpoda inflata  <cit> .

several microarray-based studies have demonstrated that inhibition of promoter methylation by a drug that inhibits dna methyltransferase results in altered gene expression  <cit> . in arabidopsis thaliana transcriptional profiling revealed that inhibition of dna methylation by 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine  altered the expression of  <dig> % of genes tested, with  <dig> being up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated by more than  <dig> fold  <cit> . similarly 5-aza-dc treatment of a human gastric cancer cell line caused up-regulation of about  <dig> % of the genes by at least 16-fold  <cit> . treatment of esophageal squamous carcinoma cells with  <dig> μm of 5-aza-dc caused at least 3-fold or more up regulation of  <dig> % of  <dig>  genes  <cit> .

in order to identify the genome-wide effects of dna methylation on gene expression in e. histolytica, we performed transcriptional profiling of parasites treated with and without 5-azac. using a short oligonucleotide microarray representing  <dig>  of the predicted  <dig>  open reading frames from e. histolytica  <cit>  we identified  <dig> genes  as being modulated at least 2-fold by 5-azac. of these,  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> genes down regulated. these data indicate that epigenetic gene silencing is operational in e. histolytica although it does not effect a large portion of the amebic genome.

RESULTS
treatment with 5-azac did not significantly affect parasite growth but reduced virulence in vitro
in order to elucidate the effects of inhibiting genomic dna methylation in e. histolytica, we grew parasites in  <dig> μm 5-azac for up to seven days with routine passaging and assessed growth rates and in vitro virulence. we used two different e. histolytica strains hm-1:imss and 200:nih, both of which are considered virulent  <cit> . for e. histolytica hm-1:imss parasites exposed to  <dig> μm 5-azac there was some reduced growth at day  <dig>  compared to the untreated control, however, the parasite numbers in subsequent days were consistently equivalent . in e. histolytica 200:nih treated with  <dig> μm 5-azac, we did not observe any statistically significant effect on growth for up to seven days compared to the untreated control . additionally, we grew e. histolytica hm-1:imss for five consecutive days without routine subculturing, and did not observe any growth differences in parasites grown with or without  <dig> μm 5-azac . we could not reliably grow parasites for > <dig> days without subculturing due to overcrowding of the cultures and parasite death. for the 200:nih strain, the parasite numbers in 5-azac treated and untreated cultures were also equivalent at all time points tested, up to day  <dig> . under these conditions, we assessed the protein content per cell of e. histolytica hm-1:imss parasites at days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of growth, and found that there were no significant differences in protein content per cell between drug treated and untreated parasites or between parasites at different time points . similar data were observed for the 200:nih strain . we also grew the e. histolytica hm-1:imss strain  with routine subculturing every two days with an equal volume of culture medium and parasites passed at each time. under these conditions, the growth of the parasites in  <dig> μm 5-azac was slightly reduced at day  <dig>  however the rate of growth was subsequently equivalent to the untreated control at days  <dig> and  <dig> . overall, these data indicate that there is not a substantial and sustained effect on the growth of the e. histolytica parasites for up to 6– <dig> days in the presence of  <dig> μm 5-azac.

for both e. histolytica hm-1:imss and e. histolytica 200:nih, 5-azac exposure for  <dig> or  <dig> days resulted in parasites that were reduced in virulence  . exposure to 5-azac at  <dig> μm did not affect cho cell viability and addition of  <dig> μm 5-azac to the parasites at the time of the cho cell killing assay did not affect parasite virulence . thus the reduction in ability of the parasites to kill cho cells was dependent on prior exposure of the parasites to 5-azac. although this was an in vitro cell killing assay and thus an indirect measure of parasite virulence, our results correlate with previously published data of in vitro and in vivo virulence attenuation in e. histolytica hm-1:imss grown with  <dig> μm of 5-azac for  <dig> week  <cit> . since e. histolytica parasite strains are genomically diverse   <cit>  and have genome-wide expression differences  <cit> , it was not clear if the effects of 5-azac could be generalized to other e. histolytica strains. we have now shown that two genetically distinct, but virulent, strains of e. histolytica, are similarly attenuated in their virulence potential by 5-azac treatment. whether this virulence attenuation is due to a direct effect of the 5-azac on e. histolytica genomic dna methylation, is due to some other effect on the parasite, or is simply an associative phenomenon, cannot be definitively stated at present.

microarray expression profiling reveals genes modulated by 5-azac treatment
in order to identify genes whose expression was modulated by 5-azac treatment, expression profiling of  <dig>  amebic genes was performed for untreated and 5-azac treated e. histolytica hm-1:imss. we chose to perform expression profiling with the e. histolytica hm-1:imss strain for a number of reasons:  this is the strain for which the genome sequence is available and the array was designed,  transcriptome data are available for this strain from an invasive mouse model of colitis and can be used for comparative purposes  <cit> ,  this is the strain for which there are published data for potential roles of the retrotransposon elements  and short interspersed nuclear elements ) in amebic pathogenesis and gene silencing  <cit> ,  there are substantial genomic differences in coding and non-coding regions of the 200:nih strain compared to hm-1:imss  <cit> , and  the vast majority of relevant literature is for the hm-1:imss strain.

to identify genes affected by genomic dna methylation, we chose to look at both early  and late  time points after 5-azac exposure. we chose the early time point to identify genes that are likely modulated by 5-azac as a primary effect . however, in case certain genomic regions were more resistant to the effects of 5-azac, we also analyzed the parasite transcriptome after seven days of drug exposure. importantly, for both these time points, there were no significant effects on parasite growth rates and both time points gave consistently attenuated virulence phenotypes in both e. histolytica strains .

genes that are endogenously silenced by genomic dna methylation should be transcriptionally upregulated under 5-azac treatment. we considered genes transcriptionally regulated if they were modulated at both time points of 5-azac treatment compared to the untreated controls . to confirm the array data, a subset of genes whose expression was modulated by 5-azac exposure were tested by semi-quantitative rt-pcr and in all cases the array data were confirmed . a total of  <dig> transcripts  were significantly modulated with  <dig> genes upregulated and  <dig> genes down regulated in 5-azac treated parasites compared to control, untreated parasites . approximately 58% of these genes were annotated as hypothetical or of unknown function. whether all the genes that were upregulated by 5-azac treatment are methylated or were secondarily controlled by other genes cannot be definitively stated. however, we required that genes be transcriptionally modulated at both early and late time points, thus hopefully minimizing the potential secondary downstream effects. genes whose expression decreases with 5-azac treatment are expected to be secondary or downstream effects of regulation of another gene. inhibition of genomic dna methylation would not, to the best of our knowledge, be directly expected to repress gene expression  <cit> .

genomic regions previously known to be methylated in e. histolytica are the heat shock protein  <dig> , ribosomal rna , and heat shock protein  <dig> , and the repetitive region ehmrs <dig>  <cit> . of these, the only gene known to be transcriptionally modulated by dna methylation is ehsp <dig>  <cit> . in the study by bernes et al., the ehsp <dig> gene transcript could not be detected in untreated e. histolytica hm-1:imss parasites but was upregulated in 5-azac-treated and heat-shocked parasites  <cit> . this gene is represented by locus  <dig> m <dig> in the e. histolytica tigr genome database  <cit>  and represented by the  <dig> m00187_s_at probe set in our microarray. however, in our studies this probe set showed significant hybridization under standard culture conditions in e. histolytica hm-1:imss parasites and was not modulated by inhibition of dna methylation . this probe set was also showed significant hybridization in the 200:nih strain . since this probe set also represented a number of other genes , we confirmed the array results by rt-pcr using gene specific primers as designed by bernes et al  <cit> . the rt-pcr analysis, specific to the ehsp <dig> gene, confirmed our microarray data and indicated that in our e. histolytica hm-1:imss strain the ehsp <dig> gene was expressed under baseline culture conditions and was not modulated by 5-azac treatment . other genes associated with the heat shock or stress response were not expressed in our parasites under standard culture conditions, indicating that the parasite cultures were not generally stressed . the difference in basal ehsp <dig> gene expression between our cultures and those of bernes, et al.  <cit>  may be due to differences in the parasite strains. it has been shown that different clones of e. histolytica hm-1:imss have different expression levels for certain genes, including retrotransposons  <cit> , and have other biologically distinct properties relating to gene silencing  <cit> .

using bisulfite treatment followed by sequencing of the coding and promoter regions we confirmed that the ehsp <dig> gene in our parasite strain was methylated . however, the extent of dna methylation in the promoter and coding regions of the ehsp <dig> gene in our hm-1:imss parasite clone was slightly lower compared to that of bernes, et al.  <cit> . for example, position  <dig> of the promoter  was found to be unmethylated in  <dig> out of  <dig> clones tested in our hm-1:imss parasite strain while  <dig> out of  <dig> clones in bernes' hm-1:imss showed evidence of methylation. similarly, for other positions fewer clones in our strain showed methylation compared to their parasites . whether this slight difference in dna methylation in our strain compared to that of bernes, et al.  <cit>  was responsible for the baseline higher expression under standard conditions is not clear at present. while our microarray does not contain probe sets for rrna genes, other genes previously known to contain cytosine methylation such as hsp <dig>  were not modulated by 5-azac treatment. in fact, it has been shown that the expression of hsp <dig> is not regulated by its cytosine methylation  <cit> ; thus, our data are consistent with this observation. we also identified other genes, whose transcription was marginally modulated  but whose promoters were methylated  .

thus, there appear to be at least two subsets of genes in e. histolytica. first are those that are endogenously silenced by genomic dna methylation and for which 5-azac treatment induces significant transcriptional de-repression . the second category of genes are those that have genomic dna methylation, but are not endogenously silenced   <cit> . whether the second category of genes  are more resistant to 5-azac  <cit>  or are those in which the methylation profile is not due to methyltransferases but instead due to other factors, such as dsrna-directed methylation  <cit> , is not clear at present.

rt-pcr confirmed the array data
in order to confirm the microarray data, we isolated rna from 5-azac treated and untreated e. histolytica hm-1:imss, and performed semi-quantitative rt-pcr on five genes: two each from significantly up  and down-regulated gene sets , respectively, and one invariant gene , based on affymetrix analysis. rt-pcr agreed with the microarray data for all five transcripts tested .

genomic dna methylation apparently silences a small subset of amebic genes
of the total  <dig> genes modulated in 5-azac treated e. histolytica hm-1:imss,  <dig>  were significantly up regulated by inhibition of genomic dna methylation . approximately 72% of these were annotated as hypothetical proteins. among the others were four putative protein kinases , two bspa-like leucine rich repeat protein genes , transcription initiation factor tfiid , and a dna mismatch repair protein gene . there are two other putative transcription initiation factor tfiids annotated in the e. histolytica genome , both of which were expressed in detectable levels in untreated hm-1:imss parasites and were not regulated by 5-azac treatment . it is not clear whether these two tfiid genes contain genomic dna methylation. in contrast, the  <dig> m <dig> gene had very low basal gene expression and was up regulated in 5-azac treated parasites, and has genomic dna methylation of the coding region . to the best of our knowledge, no such basal transcription factors have been shown to be modulated by dna methylation in other systems. in prokaryotes dna methylation is involved in dna mismatch repair, and it was interesting to see that the amebic dna mismatch repair gene was also regulated by dna methylation  <cit> .

overall,  <dig> genes went from undetectable baseline expression  to a detectable expression levels after treatment by 5-azac; only  <dig> genes were up regulated by ≥ 3-fold, and only  <dig> up-regulated by ≥ 10-fold . thus, cytosine methylation apparently silences a relatively small number of amebic genes. as we have shown that  <dig> μm 5-azac treatment for seven days was adequate for inhibiting methylation of the ehsp <dig> gene , we disfavor a technical reason for this observation. however, we cannot exclude that this parasite contains other types of rare dna methylation   <cit> , which remained unaffected by 5-azac treatment or that some amebic genomic regions have 5-methylcytosine that is resistant to  <dig> μm of 5azac treatment. in arabidopsis thaliana treatment with 5-aza-dc resulted in up-regulation of  <dig> % of all genes in the array by ≥ 3-fold  <cit> . this suggests that dna methylation silences a relatively small number of genes in these two systems.

identification of genomic dna methylation by bisulfite treatment and dna sequencing
it has been previously shown that the e. histolytica hm-1:imss ehsp <dig> gene contained methylation in both the promoter and coding regions  <cit> . in order to confirm these data for our e. histolytica hm-1:imss strain, we performed a bisulfite reaction followed by strand-specific pcr of the ehsp <dig> gene. this procedure converts unmethylated cytosine residues to uracil, giving rise to thymine after amplification by pcr  <cit> . only methylated cytosines are refractory to the deamination and are still seen as cytosines after pcr amplification. we demonstrated that the ehsp <dig> gene is methylated at both the coding and promoter regions and that 5-azac treatment  significantly inhibited methylation of this gene . the level of demethylation we observed was similar to that observed by bernes, et al.  <cit> . this confirmed that the 5-azac was working as expected under our usage conditions.

in order to determine the extent of genomic dna methylation in genes that were transcriptionally up regulated by 5-azac treatment, we performed sodium bisulfite treatment, pcr and sequencing of three genes significantly upregulated by 5-azac treatment . these three genes had extremely low basal gene expression  . we identified that two genes  contained cytosine methylation in both coding and corresponding promoter regions, while the third one  showed only limited methylation in the coding region . cytosine methylation in the coding region has been implicated in gene silencing in other systems  <cit>  and appears to be responsible for the endogenous silencing of the  <dig> m <dig> gene in e. histolytica. overall the trend was for greater methylation in coding than promoter regions, as also seen by bernes, et al.  <cit> . thus, our microarray data identified novel genes whose expression was endogenously silenced by genomic dna methylation.

since the number of genes that were apparently regulated by dna methylation was limited, we investigated whether genes that were somewhat transcriptionally modulated  may also be genomically methylated. four such genes were subjected to bisulfite treatment and sequencing:  <dig> m <dig>   <dig> m <dig>   <dig> m <dig>  and  <dig> m <dig>  we picked genes that were transcriptionally upregulated early   in order to improve our chances of finding genes partially regulated by methylation. surprisingly, all four genes had substantial methylation in their promoter regions . interestingly, despite the significant extent of genomic dna methylation, these four genes were not transcriptionally silenced under basal conditions  . a similar trend was previously noticed for the hsp <dig> gene, which has genomic methylation, but is not transcriptionally modulated by dna methylation  <cit> . additionally, in our strain of e. histolytica hm-1:imss, the ehsp <dig> gene is methylated but not endogenously silenced or transcriptionally modulated by 5-azac treatment .

thus, the extent of genomic dna methylation in e. histolytica is likely greater than that indicated by the expression profiling as not all genomic regions that are methylated appear to be either transcriptionally silenced or substantially regulated by 5-azac treatment. we do not feel that this represents a technical flaw  as  <dig> μm 5-azac for  <dig> days did completely abolish methylation at the hsp <dig> coding region . additionally, higher does of 5-azac  are rapidly lethal to the parasite . as mentioned earlier, each gene that is methylated in e. histolytica does not necessarily respond to 5-azac treatment  <cit> . similar observations have also been made in several insect systems. dna methylation of defensin gene in the lepidopteran mamestra brassicae is not involved in gene silencing as it is constitutively expressed  <cit> . likewise, highly expressed genes in myzus persicae  <cit>  and planococcus citri  <cit>  contain dna methylation.

as expected, a gene whose expression levels significantly decreased after 5-azac treatment showed no cytosine methylation . genes whose expression decreases after exposure to 5-azac would not be expected to be directly transcriptionally modulated by drug treatment, but likely change expression levels as a downstream effect of other transcriptional changes in the parasites.

the majority of genomic dna methylation in e. histolytica is not at cg di-nucleotides
in most systems, genomic dna methylation occurs at cpg dinucleotides  <cit> . the skewed at content of the amebic genome  predicts that methylation will frequently not occur at cpg dinucleotides  <cit> . the majority of methylations we identified were located in non-cpg sites, confirming previous data for the ehsp <dig> gene  <cit> . non-cpg methylation was also detected in entamoeba invadens  <cit> . in order to determine if we could bioinformatically predict the location of potential dna methylation in e. histolytica genomic dna, we analyzed the frequencies of mono- and di-nucleotides in genes transcriptionally regulated by 5-azac compared to the whole genome. no significant differences in any of the mono or di-nucleotides were identified in up-regulated or down-regulated genes compared to the whole genome . thus, in the e. histolytica genome the frequency of the mono- or di-nucleotide occurrence was in itself not predictive of transcriptional regulation by genomic dna methylation.

genes adjacent to retrotransposable elements are not substantially silenced by genomic dna methylation
retrotransposable elements can have substantial effects on genome structure and gene expression  <cit> . one method by which they can modulate gene expression is by regulating the expression of adjacent genes by methylation  <cit> . retrotransposable elements are abundant in e. histolytica and some are maintained in hundreds of copies per genome  <cit> . previously we have identified that two such retrotransposable elements, lines and sines, have higher expression in virulent strains of e. histolytica hm-1:imss compared with nonvirulent entamoeba  <cit> . in the reptile parasite entamoeba invadens the reverse transcriptase of line  contains dna methylation and it has been suggested that both e. invadens and e. histolytica possess a mechanism for dna methylation of line retrotransposons  <cit> . it is also not clear how many fully functional line and sine elements are present in e. histolytica  but we do know that at least some of the line and sine elements are transcribed  <cit> .

we were unable to detect the transcriptional profile of lines/sines as there are no probe sets representing these regions in our microarray. we wished to determine if genes adjacent to lines or sines were preferentially modulated by 5-azac treatment. the normalized expression values for all genes adjacent to lines or sines were  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , respectively, in untreated e. histolytica hm-1:imss, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , respectively, in 5-azac treated e. histolytica hm-1:imss. thus, we did not identify any significant association of genes that were modulated by 5-azac and their genomic proximity to line or sine elements compared with untreated parasites. this finding indicates that even if the line/sine elements in e. histolytica contain dna methylation they do not necessarily co-regulate adjacent genes by this mechanism.

additionally, we identified that adjacent loci in the same scaffold did not show co-regulation by dna methylation . this phenomenon is also observed in arabidopsis thaliana, in which transcriptional profiling reveals that 5-aza-dc responsive genes are distributed randomly throughout the chromosome arms and are not clustered in any obvious pattern  <cit> .

effect of 5-azac on e. histolytica virulence
virulent strains of e. histolytica hm-1:imss and 200:nih grown with  <dig> μm of 5-azac for three or seven days showed no substantial growth differences but displayed severely reduced virulence phenotype compared to untreated parasites   <cit> . importantly, others have demonstrated that the effect of 5-azac on parasite virulence is reversible and parasite virulence returns to baseline when drug exposure is withdrawn  <cit> . whether the effect of 5-azac on parasite virulence is simply an associative or causal finding is unclear at present. however, we did find some genes that were down regulated in 5-azac treated parasites, which have previously been shown to function as virulence determinants . these included a putative cysteine proteinase , lysozyme , and a myosin ca-binding protein . cysteine proteinases  are important virulence determinants in e. histolytica and serve a number of functions including degradation of colonic mucin and extracellular matrix  <cit> . genetic proof of their importance in virulence has been shown as parasites in which members of the cp family are down regulated are less virulent in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . lysozymes are important for degrading intracellular bacteria and thus play an important role in e. histolytica virulence  <cit> . motility is an important aspect of amebic pathogenesis and parasites that are altered in their myosin ii are less virulent  <cit> . likewise, toxoplasma gondii myosin a has been implicated in powering parasite gliding and host cell invasion  <cit> . in addition, five protein kinase genes and eight gtpase family protein genes were also down regulated significantly in 5-azac treated parasites. protein kinases can affect the functions of a large number of genes and the gtpase gene family is important in vesicle trafficking, an important aspect of biology in the professionally phagocytic e. histolytica  <cit> . thus, some roles of these genes in amebic pathogenesis can be anticipated, although functional genetic proof will be necessary to assign a definitive role to these genes in amebic virulence. importantly, eight of the genes down regulated under 5-azac treatment also had decreased expression in a non-virulent strain of e. histolytica, rahman, compared to the virulent e. histolytica hm-1:imss    <cit> . interestingly, in e. histolytica rahman, treatment with  <dig> μm 5-azac did not significantly change the transcriptional profile of these genes . a number of genes that have decreased expression in avirulent entamoeba strains and species have been shown to be virulence determinants including the gal/galnac light subunit lectin  <cit> , cp <dig> and cp <dig>  <cit> , and amebapore  <cit> . in addition, four genes down regulated by 5-azac treatment  are significantly up regulated during parasite invasion in a mouse model of amebic colitis   <cit> . since e. histolytica trophozoites passed through a mouse model become more virulent, some of the upregulated genes from the in vivo mouse model of colitis may have direct roles in virulence. thus, data from a number of different angles indicates that genes that are down regulated by 5-azac treatment are good candidates on which to perform directed functional studies to elucidate their potential contributions to amebic virulence.

discussion
cytosine methylation is the most frequent endogenous modification of dna in eukaryotes and is involved in regulating gene expression  <cit> . dna methylation has been implicated as having a multitude of effects in entamoeba histolytica, however, the extent of dna methylation and its overall roles in epigenetic gene silencing in this parasite were unknown. here we report for the first time whole genome transcriptional profiling of e. histolytica parasites treated with 5-azac, an inhibitor of dna methyltransferase. our findings indicate that  <dig> genes  are endogenously silenced by methylation in this parasite.

we identified dna methylation in the coding regions of some e. histolytica genes and in some instances higher levels of cytosine methylation in the coding regions compared to the promoter regions. in the transcription initiation factor tfiid gene  we only identified methylation in the coding region and yet this gene was transcriptionally silenced by endogenous methylation. this is consistent with the observation that dna methylation within the body of genes may also have a dampening effect on transcriptional elongation. it has been suggested that methyl binding proteins might be involved in inhibiting elongation, either directly or by their effects on the surrounding chromatin structure  <cit> . a recent report of dnmt <dig> protein having a novel trna methyltransferase activity in mouse, arabidopsis, and drosophila suggests that the biological role of this protein is broader than was previously anticipated  <cit> . interestingly, the cytoplasmic localization of the dnmt <dig> protein in mammalian cells is in contrast to the nuclear localization seen in e. histolytica  <cit> . it is not currently known whether the e. histolytica dnmt <dig> may also have a trna methyltransferase activity.

the e. histolytica genome is littered with retrotransposon elements of the line and sine category. as a measure of genome defense, organisms often methylate these elements  in an attempt to silence them and prevent adverse effects of random transposition . our analysis indicates that in e. histolytica hm-1:imss genomic regions adjacent to the line and sine elements are not significantly modulated by treatment with 5-azac. however, methylation of some line elements in entamoeba have been reported and a dna methylation based mechanism for controlling these elements is anticipated  <cit> . thus, either the methylation is specific to the line elements  and does not spread to adjacent genomic regions, or the adjacent loci have a methylation pattern that is resistant to  <dig> μm 5-azac treatment. additionally, although a line element was identified as being methylated  attempts to identify a specific genomic copy of the line element that is methylated in e. histolytica have been unsuccessful to date  <cit> . taken together the data indicate that methylation is involved to some degree in controlling lines in e. histolytica, but is likely not a genome-wide phenomenon and that other mechanisms to control retrotransposition in e. histolytica likely exist.

despite the relatively few changes in gene expression induced by 5-azac treatment , there was marked reduction in monolayer destruction by two virulent strains of e. histolytica . since the two parasite strains are genetically distinct  <cit>  and have unique expression profiles  <cit> , the consistent effects of 5-azac treatment on amebic phenotype are interesting. thus, genes that had differential expression in 5-azac treated parasites  deserve further directed functional studies to characterize their potential roles in parasite virulence. importantly, it has previously been reported that the decrease in parasite virulence by exposure to 5-azac was reversible upon removal of the drug, suggesting that drug exposure likely did not impart significant permanent mutations in the e. histolytica genome  <cit> .

our findings indicate that, although dna methylation is operational in e. histolytica, this epigenetic mechanism of gene expression regulation affects a relatively small portion of amebic genes.

CONCLUSIONS
dna methylation has roles in many crucial biological functions including regulation of gene expression. the genome-wide extent of dna methylation and its subsequent effects on gene expression are unknown in many eukaryotes. we investigated the effects of dna methylation in the protozoan parasite entamoeba histolytica using whole genome expression profiling of parasites treated with 5-azacytidine, a potent inhibitor of dna methyltransferase. drug treatment modulated the expression of ~ <dig> % of all amebic genes including  <dig> genes that were up-regulated and  <dig> genes that were down regulated.
