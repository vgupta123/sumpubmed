BACKGROUND
white adipose tissue  plays an important role in homeostasis by storing and releasing triglycerides and by releasing many hormonal factors called adipokines such as leptin or adiponectin. high caloric intake leads to the expansion of wat by an increase of adipocyte numbers , by expanding the volume of existing adipocytes  or a combination of both  <cit> . in order to understand, which mechanisms drive hypertrophic or hyperplastic obesity, we need to understand the mechanisms controlling growth and differentiation of adipocytes.

many factors have already been identified, mainly by rna analysis, which regulate cell fate and control the transformation of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes. this process confers massive changes in the structure of the cell, which leads to storage of fat and the formation of fat vacuoles. the orchestrated changes in the structure of the preadipocyte require tight control of the involved factors.

an extensively studied model for adipogenesis in vitro is the mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line 3t3-l <dig>  <cit> . 3t3-l <dig> cells are grown to confluency and among stimulation with a hormone cocktail consisting of insulin, dexamethasone and isobutylmethylxanthine , cells re-enter cell cycle within  <dig> to  <dig> h. two rounds of cell division are performed after which they permanently withdraw from the cell cycle, begin to accumulate lipid, and undergo terminal differentiation into mature adipocytes. until recently, regulating mechanisms of the earliest step in the differentiation process are poorly understood in comparison to later stages of adipogenesis.

the orchestrated changes in the expression of structural proteins require changes in the expression and activity of factors controlling the expression of structural proteins. induction of adipogenesis by hormones leads to the expression of c/ebpβ and c/ebpδ within  <dig> hours  <cit> , which activate the expression of pparγ and c/ebpα at low levels. pparγ and c/ebpα activate each others' expression in a positive feedback loop that promotes and maintains the differentiated state  <cit> . the latter proteins orchestrate the changes in gene expression typical for mature adipocytes. besides the c/ebp family and pparγ, many other factors are known that play a role in adipogenesis. most of these factors are regulated on the transcriptional level and mrna steady state levels can be easily measured. however, there is increasing evidence that proteins, which are controlled at the translational level, are of uttermost importance for adipogenesis and other cellular processes. a handful of translationally controlled proteins has been characterized in adipogenesis up to now. the c/ebp factors c/ebpα and c/ebpβ are regulated at the posttranscriptional level, whereupon various isoforms arise from a unique mrna by differential initiation of translation  <cit> . in 3t3-l <dig> cells, high eif <dig> and eif4e activity shifts the ratio of c/ebp isoforms expression toward more truncated isoforms  <cit> . an important factor that controls adipogenesis at the translational level is hzf  <cit> . hzf enhances translation of c/ebpα mrna by binding to its 3´-untranslated region. knock-down of hzf disrupts adipogenesis.

in most cases, translation efficiency is closely related to ribosomal association of the respective mrna. the degree of ribosomal association can be easily measured by separation of the mrnas in a sucrose gradient by velocity sedimentation  <cit> . the gradient is fractionated, mrna is isolated from each fraction and the ratio of the 28s/18s rrna is used to determine the fractions containing free rna  and polysomal rna  <cit> . by use of microarrays, the composition of the rna pools can be determined easily  <cit> .

we used velocity sedimentation and microarray analysis to identify mrnas that change in ribosomal association during the first  <dig> hours after hormonal induction of adipogenesis of 3t3-l <dig> cells and assessed changes of translational activity by western blotting of some candidate genes.

RESULTS
adipogenesis
adipogenesis was assessed microscopically by oil red o staining . in comparison to the fibroblastic phenotype of preadipocytes, mature adipocytes´ phenotype is round and cells accumulate lipid droplets in the cytoplasm. additionally, adipogenesis was assessed by the analysis of mrna steady state levels of c/ebpβ and pparγ by means of q-pcr in total rna at time points day  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  ct-values were calibrated to day  <dig>  normalized with βactin, . c/ebpβ was up-regulated 3times at day  <dig> and back to base levels at day  <dig>  pparγ was up-regulated at day  <dig>  no significant change of mrna steady state levels were detected at day  <dig> . these data confirm correct adipogenesis  <cit> .

velocity sedimentation and polysome analysis
we analyzed mrna distribution in samples taken immediately before  and  <dig> hours after hormonal stimulation .  <dig> fractions of  <dig> ml each were collected from the top of the ultra centrifuged gradient. stability of linear gradients was proved by refractive index of sucrose concentration . the gradients showed high stability in fraction sucrose concentration. after rna isolation, the ratio of 28s to 18s rrna was measured to determine the distribution of free rna and polysomal rna. non-polysomal rna shows 28s/18s ratios unequal to two, while polysomal fractions show 28/18s ratios close to two  <cit> . fractions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were pooled and considered as free rna . fractions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were pooled and considered as polysomal rna. fraction  <dig> to  <dig> contained mainly buffer, remaining cell lysate and fat, fraction  <dig> and  <dig> contained cell debris. these fractions were not used for ribosome profiling. fraction  <dig> was not used in order to obtain a clear separation of polysomal and non-polysomal fractions.

microarray analysis
microarray analysis was performed according to standard protocols in three biological replicates   <cit> . expression levels were normalized to the spike values and the quality control revealed the expected clustering of fractions into polysomal and non-polysomal ones as well as clustering of time points . data were submitted to geo . we identified  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes with a false discovery rate  < <dig>  and with m-value ) > <dig>  to exclude false positives from decreasing total mrna steady state levels  only genes with values of p <dig> > p <dig>  p <dig> > np <dig>  np <dig> < np <dig>  p <dig> < np <dig> were included in the analysis. for the present study, only genes with m-value >  <dig> were considered.  <dig> genes showed highest abundance in polysomal fractions at time point  <dig> h after hormonal induction and were identified as up-regulated . two genes were identified as down-regulated with m-values < - <dig>  p <dig> < p <dig> and p <dig> > np <dig> . determination of unchanged gene expression between  and  was based on two one-sided tests for equivalence gene-by-gene  <cit>  in which a magnitude of  <dig>  was chosen for the region of similarity and  <dig> genes fit these parameters .
quantitative real time-pcr 
in order to assess up-regulation of genes as determined by microarray analysis, we chose three up-regulated genes  and one gene with unchanged mrna  for target verification by q-pcr. the rna preparation used for q-pcr was the same as the one used for agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer-analysis. q-pcr data confirmed microarray results. rpl27a was up-regulated  <dig>  times in microarray analysis  , and  <dig>  times up-regulated in q-pcr . eif4b was  <dig>  times up-regulated in ma  and  <dig>  times up-regulated  in q-pcr. impdh <dig> was  <dig> times up-regulated in ma  and  <dig>  times up-regulated  in q-pcr. ube2k was neither up nor down-regulated in ma  or q-pcr. hence, up-regulation of three randomly chosen genes was successfully confirmed by q-pcr .

western blotting
to confirm up-regulation of protein levels of mrnas identified in microarray assays and confirmed by q-pcr, 3t3-l <dig> cells were differentiated for  <dig> hours and protein levels were analyzed by western blotting. we analyzed protein levels of the three up-regulated proteins eif4b, impdh <dig> and rpl27a and the unchanged gene ube2k in three biological replicates, each biological replicate being performed twice. changes in protein expression were quantified by densitometry and normalized with appropriate expression data of βactin . eif4b and rpl27a protein levels were  <dig>  fold higher  at  <dig> +  <dig> h than at  <dig> h. impdh <dig> and ube2k/hip <dig> showed no significant differences in protein levels between  <dig> h and 0+  <dig> h after hormonal induction.

cluster analysis
we used panther db to classify genes into functional groups. for  <dig> of the  <dig> up-regulated mrnas, no function is known. the known genes code for proteins that are nucleic acid binding - either rna or dna - , form part of ribosomes , act on the regulation of translation  or transcription , as chaperones , nucleotidyl transferase , amino acid transporter , kinase inhibitor , aminoacyl-trna synthetase , peroxidase , oxidoreductase , oxygenase  or hydrolase  and peptide hormone . panther informations are shown in additional file  <dig> 

discussion
we analyzed the changes in the abundance of mrnas in free or ribosome bound fractions from velocity sedimentation during the first hours of adipogenesis in 3t3-l <dig> mouse cells. we identified  <dig> genes that were significantly increased in the polysomal fraction at t <dig>  and two genes with lower abundance   <dig> hours after the induction of adipogenesis by administration of a hormone cocktail to the confluent cell culture. we confirmed ma data by q-pcr of three randomly chosen up-regulated genes. finally, we analyzed protein levels of the three up-regulated genes eif4b, impdh <dig> and rpl27a and the unchanged gene ube2k/hip <dig> . in western blots, impdh <dig> protein levels were unchanged. it is subject to further investigation, if ribosomes on impdh <dig> mrna are stalled, protein levels increase later in the course of adipogenesis or if other mechanisms are employed to keep the protein levels unchanged. eif4b and rpl27a levels were confirmed to be up-regulated and we assume that as a general rule, changes in translational activity are predicted by changes of ribosomal association as has been demonstrated before  <cit> .

there are several studies of transcriptional changes during adipogenesis and many factors have been identified that play an important role in this process. burton et al.,  <dig> identified  <dig> clones with a greater than fivefold deviation of expression during the first  <dig> hours of adipogenesis  <cit> . in our study, none of these factors showed changes greater than fourfold with the exception of c-myc. we conclude that analysis of translational activity is important for a full understanding of the processes controlling adipogenesis.

in the last few years, interest increased in the dynamics of the proteome and there is a handful of studies in man and mouse  <cit>  about changes of the proteome, comparing preadipocytes and adipocytes in tissues, or later stages of adipogenesis. here, we report changes as soon as  <dig> hours after hormonal induction of adipogenesis, a timepoint, at which clonal expansion of 3t3-l <dig> cells is induced and expression of mitotic and adipogenic genes is initiated.

3t3-l <dig> adipocytes are grown to confluency and upon stimulation with a hormone cocktail , post-confluent g <dig> cells reenter one to two rounds of cell-cylce called mitotic clonal expansion   <cit> . it has been proposed that mce might facilitate the dna remodeling for the adipogenesis gene expression program  <cit> . as 3t3-l <dig> cells reenter cell cycle by passing from g <dig> to g <dig> phase, it might be expected that the translation machinery is activated after hormonal stimulation. in fact, we detected a shift of mrnas toward the higher molecular weight polysomal fractions, mostly derived from a general activation of gene expression. expression of ribosomal proteins, ribosome assembly proteins and ribosomal rna  are up-regulated in mitotic active cells. hence it is not surprising that ribosomal proteins  are prominent among the up-regulated proteins . additionally, for some rps, extraribosomal functions have been demonstrated. many of these extraribosomal functions can be attributed to the regulation of cell cycle and for several rps a role in cancer, promotion of cell growth or differentiation has been shown  <cit> . some of these known extraribosomal functions might well explain the role of the rps in the early phase of adipogenesis .

rpl <dig> was initially identified as up-regulated in gastric multidrug-resistant cancer cells  <cit>  and was shown to protect gastric cancer cells from drug-induced apoptosis. furthermore, rpl <dig> over-expression promotes g <dig> to s phase transition of gastric cancer cells and promotes cell growth  <cit>  . rpl7a interacts with the human thyroid hormone receptor and inhibits transactivation. thyroid hormone signalling stimulates adipogenesis  <cit>  and up-regulation of rpl7a might participate in mitotic control. rpl <dig> was shown to inhibit autophosphorylation of the double-stranded rna-activated protein kinase  and pkr mediated phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eif2α. over-expression of rpl <dig> reduced eif2α phosphorylation and stimulated translation of a reporter gene in vivo  <cit> . over-expression of rpl <dig> is thought to promote protein synthesis and cell growth through inhibition of pkr activity  <cit> , which also might hold true for adipogenesis. a polymorphism in the promoter region of the rpl27a gene was associated with meat marbling  in japanese black beef cattle  <cit> . furthermore, rpl27a is ubiquitinated in a cell-cycle specific manner, leading to increased translational efficiency of the ribosomes  <cit> .

rpsa, which was up-regulated in our study, was previously known as 37-kda laminin receptor precursor/67-kda laminin receptor . it has a number of functions depending on its subcellular localisation. in the nucleus, rpsa binds to dna by histone binding, in the cytoplasm it is associated with the 40s small ribosomal subunit and at the cell surface it acts as a receptor for various components  <cit> . it confers an anti-obesity effect when stimulated by the green tea catechin egcg  <cit> . interestingly, rpsa inhibits insulin stimulation of 3t3-l <dig> mitogenesis and egcg inhibited differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes  <cit> .

most of the rps up-regulated immediately after hormonal induction were shown to stimulate cell cycle which is concordant with the fact that 3t3-l <dig> cells undergo mitosis after stimulation. translational control allows for rapid changes of protein redundancy and it may be speculated that proteins that initiate mce and reprogramming of gene expression are regulated at the translational level. therefore we suggest that the rapid increase of l <dig>  l7a, l <dig>  l27a, sa, and s <dig> may reflect their importance of adipogenesis control in 3t3-l <dig> cells.

higher translation rates require transport of amino acids, and we detected up-regulation of the amino acid transporters slc25a <dig> and slc25a <dig>  higher translation rates also lead to increased misfolding of nascent polypeptide chains. up-regulation of chaperones in translation promoting conditions has been described before and was also observed in our study .

the pi3k-akt-mtor pathway, which is stimulated by insulin, has been identified to be essential for many cellular processes . mtorc <dig> is a protein complex containing mtor  and raptor. mtorc <dig> activates s6k <dig>  a kinase that promotes protein synthesis and cell growth by phosphorylation of multiple substrates including components of translation initiation or elongation such as ribosomal protein s <dig>  eif4b and eukaryotic elongation factor  <dig> kinase  <cit> . one target of this pathway is eif4b  . it was suggested that phosphorylation of eif4b by s <dig> kinases, which are regulated by mtor, stimulates its function. indeed, this phosphorylation event favors recruitment of eif4b into complexes with eif <dig>  which promotes the recruitment of ribosomes to the 5´end of the message . eif4b, which was up-regulated in our study, stimulates the rna helicase activity of eif4a in unwinding secondary structures in the 5´-untranslated regions  of mrnas  <cit> . by knock-down of eif4b, selective reduction of translation was observed for mrnas harboring strong to moderate secondary structures in their 5´-utrs. these mrnas code for proteins that function in cell proliferation  or cell survival . silencing of eif4b also leads to decreased proliferation rates and caspase-dependent apoptosis: eif4b is required for cell proliferation and survival by regulating the translation of proliferative and prosurvival mrnas  <cit> . pparγ expression is stimulated in response to mtorc <dig>  <cit> . pparγ is a key adipogenic factor and exogenous expression is sufficient to induce adipogenesis. zhang et al.,  <dig> discuss the possibility that akt and mtorc <dig> facilitate adipogenesis by up-regulation of pparγ via regulation of foxo <dig>  <cit> . however, they do not discuss the activation of eif4b upon mtorc <dig> activation with subsequent changes in the preference of ribosomes for certain mrnas. we think that regulation of c/ebpα could possibly be explained by up-regulation of eif4b activity, as members of the c/ebp family are regulated at the translational level .

microarray results of polysomal fractions from 3t3-l <dig> cell lysate  show up-regulation of eif4b and myc  and down-regulation of ghrelin . ir, insulin receptor; pol i/ii/iii, rna polymerase i/ii/iii

c-myc over-expression in cycling cells has been reported to block exit from the cell cycle, accelerate cell division, and increase cell size . when c-myc levels are high, 3t3-l <dig> adipoblasts are locked in a proliferation-competent state and normal differentiation can not be activated. persisting high levels of c-myc can inhibit the expression of genes that promote adipogenesis namely c/ebpα and pparγ <dig> and therefore prevent terminal differentiation of preadipocytes to mature adipocytes  <cit> . in microarray analysis, c-myc was up-regulated in 3t3-l <dig> cells several hours after hormonal induction in a study by burton et al.,  <dig>  <cit>  and at day  <dig> of differentiation in a study by kim et al.,  <dig>  <cit> . c-myc is an important regulator of ribogenesis, as it activates pol i, pol ii and pol iii leading to activation of expression of rrna, trna, ribosomal proteins, initiation factors of translation and other cell cycle relevant genes  <cit> . therefore, c-myc activation might be important for activation of the translation apparatus at the entry of 3t3-l <dig> cells into g <dig> 

in our study, two genes were down-regulated: ifit <dig> and ghrelin/obestatin prepropeptide . the members of the ifit gene family are silent in most cell types, but are activated by e.g. interferons  <cit> . ifit proteins are considered silencers of translation and down-regulation might be another factor of translation stimulation.

ghrelin has been described as a pro-adipogenic factor released by the gut and is involved in control of food intake, energy metabolism and cytokine secretion . treatment of 3t3-l <dig> preadipocytes with ghrelin significantly increases the mrna levels of c-myc, and induces the transition from g <dig> to s  <cit> . as a supplement in media, ghrelin promotes the proliferation and differentiation of 3t3-l <dig> preadipocytes by increasing the mrna levels of pparγ and c/ebpα  <cit>  . ghrelin mrna over-expressing 3t3-l <dig> cells, on the other hand, demonstrated significantly attenuated differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes  <cit> . in the recent study we found ghrelin ~  <dig> times down-regulated in polysomal fractions of 3t3-l <dig> cells six hours after hormonal induction. down-regulation of ghrelin levels in the early phase of adipogenesis fits the known facts indicating a role of decreased endogenous ghrelin levels in promoting adipogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
we have analyzed changes in translational control at  <dig> hours after induction of adipogenesis in 3t3-l <dig> preadipocytes and detected  <dig> translationally up-regulated and two down-regulated mrnas with a minimal change of  <dig> fold. the alternatively regulated mrnas play roles in cell cycle control, control of transcription, control of translation, energy supply, protein folding, amino acid transport and other cellular processes. a large number of rps is up-regulated in the first hours of adipogenesis. many rps play a special role in cell cycle regulation and expression control of genes and mrnas that are required for the differentiation process. most of the nucleic acid binding factors we detected bind to rna and play a role for ribosome function or translation control. we conclude that after stimulation of adipogenesis, translation control changes and forms a new layer of control which might be, at least in part, self-regulating. the changes in translation might come from changed properties of ribosomes in response to hormonal stimulation and from increased eif4b activity. further analysis of how protein levels of adipogenic genes are controlled will deepen our understanding of the complex steps during the initiation of adipogenesis and help further to develop strategies to inhibit fat cell accumulation.
