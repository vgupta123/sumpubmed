BACKGROUND
heterotrimeric  guanine nucleotide binding proteins  constitute a family of regulatory gtp hydrolases associated with the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane  <cit> . their activity is characterized by a cycle of gtp-binding and hydrolysis. the gtp- and gdp-bound complexes define the active and inactive states of the g proteins, respectively. the binding of specific ligands to transmembrane receptors activates the heterotrimeric g protein subunits that are responsible for the flow of information in many eukaryotic signal transduction pathways  <cit> . the traditional g proteins coupled receptors  share a characteristic topological structure of seven transmembrane domains and recognize diverse extracellular signals. the cytoplasmic c-terminal region contains the gα binding activity.

recently, a new class of seven transmembrane receptors has been identified in humans and other vertebrates and has been classified as belonging to the paqr superfamily   <cit> ). their activity has not been directly associated to heterotrimeric g proteins but indirect evidence suggests that they might be associated to g protein alpha subunits  <cit> .

the paqr superfamily includes three classes of membrane receptors. class i paqrs are adiponectin receptors and include: adipor <dig> , adipor <dig> , paqr  <dig> and paqr  <dig>  <cit> . these receptors respond to adiponectin that is an insulin-sensitizing peptide hormone found in vertebrates  <cit> . low serum adiponectin levels have been identified as a high risk factor for type  <dig> diabetes and other complications such as atherosclerosis and hepatic steatosis. adiponectin has been reported to have a positive effect on insulin sensitivity and energy metabolism  <cit> .

class ii paqrs respond to progesterone and include: mprα , mprβ  and mprγ   <cit> . for a long time progesterone had been observed to mediate immediate cellular effects not attributable to the classical nuclear progesterone receptors that involve mrna and new protein synthesis  <cit> . with the identification of the paqr membrane receptors for progesterone the rapid effects of this hormone, not dependent on gene transcription, can be explained  <cit> . the response of steroid membrane receptors can be rapid, as in the case of sperm hypermotility, or can occur over a prolonged period of time as in the case of oocyte maturation in fish  <cit>  and amphibians  <cit> .

class iii are the hemolysin iii-related receptors that have the deepest evolutionary roots but whose agonists are not known, these are paqr  <dig> and paqr  <dig>  <cit>  and the bacterial hemolysin iii large class of proteins, expressed in many bacterial species  <cit> . the latter have been shown to induce cytolysis of eukaryotic cells by pore formation  <cit> .

in saccharomyces cerevisiae, the izh genes encode membrane proteins that also belong to the ubiquitous protein family that includes hemolysin iii and vertebrate membrane paqr homologues. the izh family  consists of  <dig> different proteins: izh <dig>  izh <dig>  izh <dig> and izh <dig>  all but the izh <dig> have the  <dig> transmembrane domains of the paqrs  <cit> . the agonist for izh <dig> has been identified as osmotin, a plant defense protein that is a homologue of adiponectin  <cit> . yeast mutants of the izh proteins exhibit defects in zinc tolerance. izh proteins have been reported to be regulated by exogenous fatty acids, suggesting a role in lipid metabolism  <cit> . the effects of izh proteins on zinc homeostasis have been related either directly or indirectly to their effects on lipid metabolism  <cit> .

the effects of steroid hormones in the development of the parasitic forms of pathogenic dimorphic fungi, drug resistance and susceptibility to infection, makes the identification of specific steroid receptors and steroid binding proteins of outmost importance in the treatment of fungal infections [reviewed in  <cit> . in paracoccidioides brasiliensis the susceptibility to infection was observed to be dependent on gender, men being more susceptible than women, while in the case of coccidioides immitis, pregnancy increases the risk of developing the disease  <cit> . in both of these cases, hormones were suggested as responsible for these differences. on the other hand, in vitro studies of the phase transition from mycelium to yeast in p. brasiliensis showed that the transition to the yeast form was inhibited in the presence of estrogen  <cit> . in candida albicans, steroids were found to alter the response to antifungal drugs  <cit> .

nevertheless, the identification of progesterone membrane receptors in fungi has been elusive. as mentioned above, specific receptors for steroid hormones in pathogenic fungi have not been thoroughly studied and identified. progesterone has been reported to bind to fungal membranes but the direct identification of specific progesterone receptors has not been reported until now. in rhizopus, membrane ligand-binding assays suggest the presence of a progesterone receptor but that has not led to the identification of the specific receptor  <cit> .

in this work we identified a homologue of the paqr family as an interacting protein of the s. schenckii g protein alpha subunit, ssg <dig>  using the yeast two-hybrid analysis. using a yeast-based assay we determined that progesterone was the ligand of this s. schenckii paqr . this assay was used because it is specific for paqrs and was intended for the study of these receptors without the intervention of other possible progesterone binding proteins. the receptor was expressed in s. cerevisiae that has no other known progesterone receptor. we also report the effects of this agonist on the growth of the fungus from conidia and on the intracellular cyclic 3′, 5′ adenosine monophosphate  levels in s. schenckii yeast cells at various time intervals following exposure to the hormone.

RESULTS
yeast two-hybrid screening
a yeast two-hybrid assay was done using the complete coding sequence of ssg- <dig> as bait and a s. schenckii yeast cells cdna library. in this screening, a  <dig> bp insert from a blue colony growing in quadruple drop out  medium  was sequenced and found to encode the last  <dig> amino acid of the c-terminal residues of a protein homologous to izh <dig> from s. cerevisiae .

sequencing of the sspaqr <dig> gene
figure <dig> shows the cdna and derived amino acid sequence of sspaqr <dig> gene obtained using 5′ race. this figure shows a  <dig> bp cdna with an orf of  <dig> bp encoding a  <dig> amino acid protein with a calculated molecular weight of  <dig>  kda. the genbank accession numbers for the cdna and derived amino acid sequence, respectively are: eu <dig>  and aca <dig> . the panther classification system identified this protein as a member of the paqr family   with an extremely significant e value of  <dig>  e- <dig> <cit> . 

figure <dig> also shows the characteristic residues that identify the members of the class ii paqr family of receptors. the class ii paqr family  is characterized by the presence of  <dig> transmembrane domains, and three highly conserved amino acid motifs  <cit> . these include: motif a , consisting of the sequence nx3h found n-terminal to tm1; motif b, consisting of the sequence sx3h  at the end of tm <dig> and an aspartic acid residue at the beginning of tm <dig>  and motif c , consisting of the sequence, hx3h in the loop region between tm <dig> and tm <dig>  <cit> . it is of interest to note that motif c includes part of the original sequence isolated in the yeast two-hybrid assay; this sequence is underlined in figure <dig> 

figure <dig> shows the results obtained when the sspaqr <dig> sequence was analyzed for transmembrane domains using the tmhmm server v.  <dig>  and topo  <dig>  <cit> . this figure shows the  <dig> transmembrane domains that characterize these receptors. according to the tmhmm server, sosui server and psipred protein structure prediction server  analyses  <cit> , the n-terminal domain is extracellular and the c-terminal domain is intracellular as shown. psort ii analysis identified the localization of this receptor in the plasma membrane with a 45% probability  <cit> . signal peptide analysis using predotar  <cit> , targetp  <cit>  or mitoprot  <cit>  showed that the sspaqr <dig> has no mitochondrial targeting signal peptide at its n-terminal as compared to paqr  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> that have mitochondrial localization signals. memsat-svm analysis identified a signal peptide comprising the region from amino acids  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . this signal sequence possibly allows its passage through the er to its final destination. 

a multiple sequence alignment of the derived amino acid sequence of sspaqr <dig> to other fungal homologues and the human paqr <dig> is included in additional file  <dig>  blast search for the predicted amino acid sequence identified this protein as  <dig> to 80% identical to other paqrs of fungi such as: neurospora crassa, magnaporthea oryzae, giberella zeae, among others. it is also shows that it is approximately 50% identical to s. cerevisiae izh <dig> family channel protein.

co-immunoprecipitation  and western blots
the ssg-2/sspaqr <dig> interaction was corroborated using co-immunoprecipitation and western blot as shown in figure <dig>  lane  <dig> shows the band obtained using anti-cmyc antibody that recognizes ssg- <dig>  this band is of the expected size  considering that ssg- <dig> was expressed fused to the gal- <dig> binding domain. lane  <dig> shows the results obtained in the western blot when the primary anti-cmyc antibody was not added . lane  <dig> shows the band obtained using anti-ha antibody that recognizes the original sspaqr <dig> fragment isolated from the yeast two-hybrid clone. this band is of the expected size  considering that only the last  <dig> amino acids of the protein were present and that this fragment was fused to the gal- <dig> activation domain. lane  <dig> shows the results obtained in the western blot when the primary anti-ha antibody was not added .

yeast-based assay
to identify the agonist of the sspaqr <dig>  a yeast-based assay was used  <cit> . this assay is based on the fact that paqrs expressed in yeasts, activate a signal transduction pathway that represses the expression of the fet <dig> gene. yeast cells were co-transformed with plasmids, yep <dig>  and a plasmid containing the paqr insert, either pyes2ct or pgreg <dig>  the response of fet <dig> fused to the lacz gene was used as a reporter for paqr receptor activity. figure4a shows the effects of sspaqr <dig> on fet3-lacz when over-expressed in yeasts using the gal <dig> promoter for randomly selected colonies. these results show that in the absence of agonist, sspaqr <dig> did not significantly repressed fet3-lacz using the student’s t-test . figure4b, shows that when exposed to  <dig> mm progesterone, transformed yeasts cells expressing sspaqr <dig> elicited a significant repression of fet3-lacz  when compared to yeast cells transformed with the empty plasmid or the sspaqr1-containing plasmid with added ethanol . a small repression of fet3-lacz was observed in yeasts transformed with the empty plasmid if progesterone was added; nevertheless, the level of repression of fet3-lacz was significantly larger when yeast cells transformed with the plasmid expressing sspaqr <dig> were treated with the ligand . this figure also shows the results obtained with paqr  <dig> used as a positive control. paqr  <dig> is a previously characterized progesterone receptor. this figure shows the combined data of the effects of progesterone on fet3-lacz expression of  <dig> randomly picked colonies of cells transformed with the plasmid pgreg <dig> containing paqr  <dig>  the differences on fet3-lacz expression were significant using the student’s t-test . figure4c and 4d show no significant repression of fet3-lacz when thaumatin  or adiponectin  were used as ligands for the same  <dig> colonies transformed with the plasmid expressing sspaqr <dig> when compared to the controls . 

intracellular camp levels in s. schenckii treated with progesterone
figure <dig> shows the camp levels of s. schenckii yeast cells exposed to progesterone  <dig>  mm for different time intervals  before harvesting for camp determinations. this figure shows that there was an immediate significant increase in the levels of camp in cells treated with progesterone within  <dig> min after the addition of progesterone when compared to the controls . a significant decrease in camp levels was observed when cells were treated with progesterone for  <dig> h. analysis of variance between groups, done using bonferroni test for differences between means revealed that there were no differences in the camp levels between samples taken at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> minutes following exposure to progesterone but all were significantly different when compared to that obtained after  <dig> min of exposure.

effects of progesterone on growth of s. schenckii
progesterone inhibited growth of s. schenckii conidia in medium m agar plates. table <dig> shows the colony diameter of conidia incubated at 25°c and 35°c in medium m agar plates for  <dig> days at different concentrations of added progesterone. this table shows that conidia did not germinate at concentrations of progesterone of  <dig>  mm or above at 35°c. these same conidia inoculated in medium m plates with different concentrations of added progesterone and incubated at 25°c grew at all concentrations of the hormone. nevertheless the growth was significantly smaller at concentrations of progesterone  <dig>  mm or above when measured as the diameter of the colony .

this table shows the colony diameter attained after conidia were inoculated at 25°c and 35°c in a modification of medium m agar plates with different concentrations of added progesterone. no growth was observed at concentrations of progesterone of  <dig>  mm or above, at 35°c while conidia incubated at 25°c germinated and showed growth at all concentrations of progesterone tested. the data represents the average diameter ± one std deviation of  <dig> independent experiments.

a the cultures were incubated at the desired temperature for  <dig> days.

b all cultures were inoculated with 5μl of a suspension containing 106/μl conidia.

c the values given are the average of  <dig> independent determinations.

* the values marked with an asterisk are significantly different from the values where no progesterone was added to the medium.

discussion
a seemingly universal new family of receptors, the paqrs, that originated from ancestral bacterial hemolysin encoding genes has been described in eukaryotes  <cit> . much controversy surrounds these receptors specifically, their membrane topology and the possibility of being coupled to g protein signalling pathways  <cit> . nevertheless, the nature of the ligands bound by a particular receptor has been solved for most paqrs. they have been observed to bind either the peptide hormone adiponectin or the steroid hormone progesterone  <cit> . this brings up another consideration; should the adiponectin and progesterone receptors be considered members of the same family of receptors? the fact that the nature of the ligands are so different, together with the differences observed in membrane topology between the class i  and class ii  suggest inherent difference between the two classes. class i receptors have been predicted to have the n-terminal in the interior of the cell while class ii receptors have the usual gpcr topology of the n-terminal outside of the cell and the c-terminal inside the cell  <cit> . due to the predicted membrane topology of the progesterone receptors, it is suggests that they might be a new class of gpcrs. in this paper we report a new member of the class ii paqrs and address the issues regarding membrane topology, ligand binding and its relationship to the s. schenckii g alpha subunit ssg- <dig>  in an effort to characterize the sspaqr <dig> 

the fact that sspaqr <dig> was identified in a y2h assay with a g protein alpha subunit as bait, offers for the first time direct evidence of the association of these receptors to the heterotrimeric g protein signalling pathways. this association was verified using co-ip. indirect evidence of the association of progesterone paqrs to g proteins has been reported by other investigators. one of these instances involves fish oocyte maturation where response to a novel progesterone hormone was associated to a pertussis-sensitive gαi subunit pathway  <cit> .

transmembrane analysis of the sspaqr <dig> described here predicts that this protein has the  <dig> transmembrane domains characteristic of gpcrs like other progesterone binding members of the paqr family. the bioinformatic analyses described above  predicted that the n-terminal region is localized outside the plasma membrane while the c-terminal region is intracellular. this orientation has also been observed in progestin receptors, paqr <dig> and mpra  <cit> . in the case of the adiponectin members of the paqr family such as the human adiponectin receptor  <dig> and  <dig>  the orientation seems to be the opposite, as stated previously  <cit> .

bioinformatic analyses also show that sspaqr <dig> and its fungal homologues from m. oryzae, t. reesei, n. crassa and p. anserina, among others belong to the paqr receptor family. these homologues exhibit approximately  <dig> to 80% identity to sspaqr <dig>  the transmembrane domain analyses of some of these fungal homologues showed that most have the  <dig> transmembrane domains characteristic of the gpcrs. tmhmm analysis also shows that they have the traditional orientation of an external n-terminal domain and an internal c-terminal domain as sspaqr <dig>  except in the case of izh <dig> where the n-terminal is inside and the c-terminal is outside . it is also of interest to note that in many filamentous and dimorphic fungi where whole genomes have been sequenced, the sspaqr <dig> homologues encode proteins of approximately  <dig> amino acids in addition to at least one more izh homologue of smaller size .

steroid binding proteins have been described for various yeasts  <cit> . many studies have predicted the existence of a progesterone receptor in the membrane of filamentous fungi such as rhizopus nigricans <cit>  but the molecular basis of steroid signalling in fungi remains unresolved  <cit> . progesterone has been reported to bind to enriched plasma membrane fractions of r. nigricans with high affinity and this hormone has been reported to induce an activation of g proteins that decreases in the presence of cholera toxin  <cit> . nevertheless, to date no progesterone receptor has been directly identified in this or any other fungi. this work identified a membrane progesterone receptor for the first time in fungi. progesterone was identified as the ligand corresponding to sspaqr <dig> using the yeast-based assay  <cit> . this assay was used previously to identify the ligands of human paqrs heterologously expressed in s. cerevisae <cit> . this assay is specific for paqrs and was intended for the study of these receptors without the intervention of other possible progesterone binding protein. using this assay, sspaqr <dig> was expressed in s. cerevisiae and progesterone was identified as the ligand for sspaqr <dig>  yeasts carrying the empty expression vector showed that progesterone did not affect fet <dig>  showing that the effect was not due to a nonspecific effect of progestrone on s. cerevisiae. progesterone responsiveness was only observed if sspaqr <dig> was being expressed. these results put an end to the uncertainty regarding the presence of a membrane progesterone receptor in fungi.

however, the question as to why fungi have a steroid hormone receptor remains unanswered. the effects of progesterone and other steroids on fungi have not been fully documented. in candida albicans the response to steroid hormones leads to the activation of transcription of genes encoding the atp-binding cassette of drug efflux pumps  <cit> . in s. cerevisiae exposure to progesterone results in the up-regulation of stress response genes such as those involved in transport, oxidative stress response, growth, cell division and cell wall biogenesis, among other  <cit> .

in the filamentous fungi, most of the information regarding progesterone and fungi is related to bioconversion of the different steroid metabolites by fungi. recently, a progesterone-hydroxylating enzyme system was studied and found to be dependent on the g protein beta subunit and camp in fusarium oxysporum <cit> . the authors proposed that progesterone is toxic to this fungus and that by the induction of the enzymes involved in the hydroxylation of progesterone, the fungus is able to reduce the toxicity associated with the hormone. this transformation results in a more soluble compound that can be excreted to the medium.

the toxicity of progesterone results in an inhibition of growth in r. nigricans <cit> . this inhibition of growth was explained as resulting from a decrease in camp caused by progesterone. in this work we also report an inhibition of growth of both the mycelium and yeast forms of the fungus in the presence of progesterone, the yeast form being the most affected. nevertheless, we could not correlate this inhibition of growth to a decrease in camp concentrations.

another major area of concern regarding progesterone paqrs is the determination of the specific signal generated upon the interaction of the receptor with its ligand. different theories have suggested that camp and/or calcium could be involved. nevertheless, even in situations where adenylate cyclase has been identified as a target of the possible effects of progesterone, there is still disagreement if the hormone causes a decrease or an increase in camp, and the time considered reasonable for the effect on this cyclic nucleotide to be observed  <cit> . the addition of progesterone to s. schenckii yeast cells prior to harvesting for camp determinations showed that the levels of intracellular camp increased during the first minute after exposure to the ligand and decreased significantly after five hours incubation with the hormone. the increase in the cytosolic concentration of camp could be the result of the interaction of the ligand and the receptor resulting in the activation of ssg- <dig> that in turn triggers the cascade of events leading to an increase in camp. the response to the ligand in steroid membrane receptors has been identified as occurring in  <dig> to  <dig> min in the case of sperm motility to up to 6- <dig> h in the case of oocyte maturation experiments  <cit> .

the work reported here identifies the presence of a progesterone receptor in s. schenckii for the first time and establishes the presence of homologous of this receptor in other fungi as well. other authors who studied the response of fungi to progesterone have proposed the existence of this receptor. although the question still remains regarding the benefit of having such receptors in fungal cells remains open, one could argue that fungi are in contact with plant and other fungal steroids in their environment and that they have the capacity to transform these molecules to suite their needs  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the information available concerning members of the paqr receptor family is limited and controversial. several investigators have proposed the existence of a progesterone receptor in fungal membranes. in this work we identified for the first time a progesterone receptor belonging to the paqr class ii family in s. schenckii. a yeast-based assay similar to the one used to identify the ligand for the human paqrs, was used to identify the ligand of this receptor. this study constitutes the first evidence of the interaction of a fungal gα subunit with a member of the paqr family using both yeast two-hybrid assay and co-immunoprecipitation and western blot. the association of a g protein alpha subunits with sspaqr <dig> suggests that these receptors are g protein coupled. as with many g protein coupled receptors, the hormone affects the growth of the fungus possibly by a mechanism involving camp. the progesterone receptor that we have identified in s. schenckii, brings to a close the search for a membrane progesterone receptor in fungi.
