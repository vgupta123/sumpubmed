BACKGROUND
phytoplasmas are pathogenic bacteria associated with diseases of several hundred plant species, with many newly emerging diseases being reported
 <cit> . symptoms typical of phytoplasma infection are virescence , phyllody , proliferation, stunting and yellowing – symptoms that mimic hormone imbalances and/or perturbations of normal plant development. phytoplasmas belong to the mollicutes, the class of bacteria characterised by an absence of cell walls, and small  genomes as a result of genome reduction
 <cit> . despite considerable efforts, a procedure to culture phytoplasmas axenically has yet to be developed, which has hindered research into these economically important organisms.

apart from poinsettia-branch-inducing phytoplasma found in poinsettia , the only other phytoplasmas found in new zealand belong to ‘candidatus phytoplasma australiense’
 <cit> . phormium yellow leaf  was first reported in  <dig>  but was only determined to be a phytoplasma-associated disease in 1969
 <cit> . since the late 1970s, this phytoplasma has been discovered associated with diseases in new zealand of cordyline, coprosma, strawberry, and more recently potato
 <cit> . in addition, ‘ca. phytoplasma australiense’ is associated with at least five diseases in australia
 <cit> . although the 16s rrna gene sequences of all isolates are very similar, sequence variation observed in protein coding genes, such as tuf and rp, has enabled sub-species differentiation
 <cit> . there has been nothing, however, about the groupings that could explain the emergence of the more recent diseases, as representatives of the two tuf groupings found in new zealand were associated with both pyl and the more recently emerged diseases. that ‘ca. phytoplasma australiense’ is being detected in increasing numbers of plant species has heightened the need to devise effective methods to control or manage the pathogen.

the development of molecular tools has greatly assisted in the detection, identification and classification of phytoplasmas. further advances in understanding the biology of phytoplasmas and how they cause disease are being made with the sequencing and analysis of complete genomes.

to date, the genome sequences of four phytoplasmas have been published. they are onion yellows mild strain 
 <cit> , aster yellows witches’-broom 
 <cit> , ‘ca. phytoplasma australiense’ australian isolate 
 <cit> , and apple proliferation phytoplasma 
 <cit> . analysis of these genomes has revealed that phytoplasmas lack numerous biochemical pathways previously thought to be essential for a living organism. in particular, phytoplasmas lack the ability to synthesise many fundamental biochemicals essential to bacteria
 <cit> , and instead rely on their importation from the environment. this is reflected in the numerous transporters contained in their genomes. as many as  <dig> transporter genes were reported in oy-m
 <cit>  and more than  <dig> in paa
 <cit> . despite the propensity for phytoplasmas to undergo genome reduction, most phytoplasma genomes consist of repeated elements that consist of genes associated with gene replication and transposition, termed potential mobile units 
 <cit> . concern about the true nature of inverse repeats at the boundaries of pmus causes some researchers to prefer the term sequence-variable mosaics, as they believe that it more accurately reflects the origin and function of these units
 <cit> . these authors contend that rather than being mobile units, the areas are hot-spots for insertion by mobile elements, and their composition is a result of multiple targeted bacteriophage attacks
 <cit> . it has been hypothesised that such areas could be “gene factories” where new genes are created through rearrangement, insertion, deletion and gene fusion. furthermore, it has been proposed that the genes associated with pmus –referred to as mobile unit genes  - are distinct from genes positioned elsewhere in the genome – termed fundamental genes or fugs
 <cit> .

whole genome analyses have revealed the considerable diversity in the genus candidatus phytoplasma. at, which at  <dig> kbp is the smallest of the published phytoplasma genomes, differs significantly from the others. unlike the other published genomes, it is composed of a linear chromosome with repeated arrangements at the arm ends, and a conserved core of housekeeping genes. furthermore, at does not appear to have pmus other than isolated gene remnants, but does, however, have a greater complement of genes associated with homologous recombination and excision repair
 <cit> .

phytoplasma genomics has also led to the identification of genes that could be involved with pathogenicity and virulence. such genes are those annotated as haemolysins and adhesion-related proteins, as well as genes associated with insect transmission
 <cit> . duplication of a set of glycolytic genes in the virulent strain of onion yellows has been proposed as a cause of increased pathogenicity
 <cit> . more recently, studies of potential pathogenicity factors have focused on proteins with putative signal peptides, identifying proteins capable of nuclear localisation
 <cit> , as well as phytoplasma genes that produce phytoplasma-like symptoms when inserted into arabidopsis plants
 <cit> .

the complete genome of a sly isolate  of ‘ca. phytoplasma australiense’ is presented, together with a comparison with paa, another isolate from the same species. this comparison enabled us to examine the variation that occurred over a comparatively short phylogenetic difference and to contribute further to understanding the genetic requirements and evolution of these enigmatic plant pathogens.

RESULTS
general features of the ‘ca. phytoplasma australiense’ sly isolate genome
the genome of ‘ca. phytoplasma australiense’ nzsb <dig>  consists of a single circular chromosome of  <dig>  bp  and a single plasmid of  <dig>  bp . sequence analysis of ppasb <dig> was reported previously
 <cit> . in accordance with the precedent established with oy-m, the initiation codon for the dnaa gene was chosen as the start point for numbering the genome. there are  <dig> orfs in sly genome that are predicted to be protein-coding genes , two rrna operons, and  <dig> trnas . the majority of translation initiation codons for the predicted protein-coding genes are atg , while gtg  and ttg  are also proposed. a putative function has been assigned to  <dig> orfs, while  <dig> orfs have no assigned function, and are described as hypothetical proteins. in accordance with previous phytoplasma genome sequencing projects, tga was interpreted as a stop codon. the general features and comparison with other phytoplasma genomes is summarised in table 
 <dig> 

general features of the chromosomes of complete phytoplasma genomes for ‘candidatus phytoplasma australiense’ isolates sly and paa, ‘candidatus phytoplasma asteris’ isolates oy-m and aywb, and ‘candidatus phytoplasma mali’ isolate at.

gene duplications and repeated areas are prevalent in the sly genome. the most notable is a region of approximately  <dig> bp between positions 134234– <dig>  which is 100% identical at a nucleotide level to the region 497732– <dig>  these represent orfs between sly160- <dig> and sly571- <dig>  at one end, the repeat sequence ends abruptly, corresponding to c.  <dig> bp of the 5′ utr of rpod. other areas of direct repeats are between sly <dig> and sly <dig>  which corresponds to the area between sly <dig> and sly <dig>  and an area between sly <dig> and sly <dig>  which is duplicated twice more between sly <dig> and sly <dig>  and sly <dig> and sly <dig> 

of  <dig> orfs predicted for the sly genome, approximately  <dig> are present in the genome as a single copy. there are only  <dig> putative genes  that are present in more than one copy and  <dig> that occur more than  <dig> times . of putative genes with more than  <dig> copies, all but one  feature in clusters that are duplicated numerous times throughout the genome. these  <dig> clusters are similar in gene composition and structure to the genomic features previously described as potential mobile units .

in sly we identified  <dig> clusters of repeated genes that corresponded in composition to the pmus described by bai et al. <cit> . the margins of each pmu area are listed in table 
 <dig>  in most cases the boundaries of the pmu were represented by a tra <dig> transposase, although other determinants were rpod, putative prophage protein gepa, atp-dependent zn protease hflb, and chps  closely associated with the repeated gene clusters. although referred to as pmus, the regions described may contain more than one “unit” and may reflect a coalescence of numerous “pmus”. the sequences of the pmus as defined constitute  <dig> base pairs, which amount to 39% of the sly genome. see additional file
 <dig> for graphic depiction of their distribution in the genome.

comparison between paa and sly genome sequences
a comparison of putative orfs in the 61% of the genome that is not composed of pmus indicates that the gene complements of the two ‘ca. phytoplasma australiense’ isolates paa and sly are almost identical. of the annotated orfs, there are only two that are present in sly but absent in paa. they are three fragments of a putative reca gene , and sly <dig> . in paa, there are a number of annotated orfs that are not present in sly. pa <dig>  for example, is annotated as a restriction-modification enzyme “restriction enzyme alpha subunit”. other examples are orfs associated with the two “pmu5” found in paa, which in general are not found in sly. one exception is sly <dig>  annotated as dnab, which at the amino acid level has the greatest similarity  with pa <dig> - a dna helicase associated with paa-pmu <dig> 

at  <dig> bp, the sly genome is  <dig> bp larger than paa. the difference in the size is largely due to the number and size of pmus in the sly genome. in paa, the  <dig> pmus appear to constitute a lower percentage of the genome than the 39% assessed for sly. although tran-nguyen et al.
 <cit>  cites  <dig>  bp or  <dig> % of the paa genome as being in pmu clusters, their definition of what constituted a pmu was more conservative than ours. using parameters similar to those for sly, we estimate the comparable figure for paa is  <dig> bp, which constitutes 35% of the genome .

the dna sequence of  <dig> single copy genes - not associated with pmus - from sly and paa were compared. the similarity at a nucleic acid level was never lower than 99%, even in male which contained a  <dig> bp insertion-deletion . in contrast, a subset of  <dig> of these genes from the two isolates from ‘ca. phytoplasma asteris’  ranged from 91% to 97% .

although the housekeeping genes were >99% similar at a nucleotide level, gene order differed between the two isolates. a comparison of orfs not associated with pmus revealed syntenic variation between sly and paa . the blocks have been labelled “a” to “n”, with paa used as the reference strain. the most obvious differences were that in sly the blocks labelled “c” to “e” were located between blocks “f” and “l”. block “f” in sly appeared after block “k” and was a single unit, but in paa this cluster was divided into “f1” and “f2” as a result of a  <dig> kbp indel . block “j” was divided into  <dig>  as there were several areas of differences within an otherwise ostensibly syntenous region. we note that two examples of the “paa-pmu5” were situated either side of block “h” in paa, whereas this type of pmu was not found in sly.

syntenous blocks of ‘candidatus phytoplasma australiense’ isolates paa and sly, as determined by unambiguous orthologus open reading frames . nucleotide starts and finishes correspond to the starts and finishes of the orfs and are not intended to indicate accurately and precisely where the junctions of orthologous sequence begin and end.

seventeen areas where the sequence of the two isolates diverged were examined . in three cases areas  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  junctions were marked by sequence overlaps ranging from four to eleven base pairs. no pattern was evident, however, as none was the same, and none corresponded to an obvious restriction endonuclease site, which might indicate a mechanism of insertion or excision. in areas  <dig> and  <dig> where the genomes differed as a result of an insertion event, direct repeats were identified at both ends of the insertion. these were either  <dig> bp or  <dig> bp, with the larger associated with a  <dig> kbp insert in between blocks “j4” & “j5” of sly. these direct repeats could be examples of footprints left as a result of a duplication / insertion event.

the type of junction at area  <dig> was the most prevalent type of junction observed. this variation in sequence occurred at the end of block “e”, and signalled a major difference in synteny. in paa, block “e” led into block “f”, whereas in sly it led into a pmu prior to block “l”. when sly sequence was superimposed on paa, there was a four-base overlap of “gaat”  <dig> bp 5′ of sly <dig> . more significantly, perhaps, this junction corresponded to  <dig> bp of the 5′ utr region of sly <dig>  in the sly genome.

pmus of ‘ca. phytoplasma australiense’
of the more than  <dig> distinct orfs found within the areas designated as pmus, there are a number that are highly conserved. amongst these are a group of co-located three genes: thymidylate kinase , a conserved hypothetical protein that appears to be associated with tmk, and a dna helicase.

there are  <dig> orfs that are annotated as thymidylate kinase  in the sly genome, and these can be further classified into tmk-a and tmk-b, as proposed for oy phytoplasma
 <cit> . in sly there is one copy of tmk-b  and  <dig> copies of tmk-a, although one  is truncated and should be considered a pseudo-gene. the position of tmk-b in all published phytoplasma genomes is conserved, and is not associated with a pmu.

in sly all tmk-a orfs follow a conserved hypothetical protein, which we have described as “chptap” . the one exception is in sly-pmu <dig>  where the tmk-a is severely truncated because of a gross deletion after  <dig> nucleotides . there are  <dig> copies of chptap in the sly genome, and they are very highly conserved. chptap appears to be highly conserved throughout the genus, with analogues detected in oy-m, ay-wb, paa, clover phyllody , loofah witches’ broom , and ‘ca. phytoplasma solani’ . chptap is 60% - 70% similar with the analogues in these phytoplasmas, except for paa where the similarities are greater than 90%. no discernable analogue was detected, however, in apple proliferation phytoplasma. in sly, the orfs of chptap and tmk-a overlap by  <dig> nucleotides, suggesting that this gene arrangement could be operonal. both tmk-a and chptap are closely associated with a dna helicase , although  <dig> of  <dig> putative dnac/b genes are not associated with chptap and tmk-a.

in sly there are  <dig> orfs that are annotated as dnac. of these, only two  are not associated with a pmu. the putative full-length dnac gene products associated with pmus have 79% identity when compared with one another, but with only 30% and 50% identity to sly <dig> and sly <dig> respectively. when compared with dnac from other phytoplasmas, sly <dig> was identical  to pa <dig>  with 72% identity to pam <dig> and aywb_ <dig>  which were annotated as dna helicase “dnab”, and 50% with atp_ <dig>  annotated as dnab <dig>  furthermore, the position of this orf was highly conserved in the genome, situated in all cases upstream of peptide chain release factor , and downstream of 50s ribosomal protein l <dig> . sly <dig> is 96% similar to pa <dig>  and the two are syntenic, although the synteny of the two genomes differs after the orf. no obvious orthologue was detected in other phytoplasmas, and there was no more than 30% identity with other dnac annotated proteins. it has been annotated as a “replicative helicase” because of strong similarity at the carboxyl terminus, and it has greatest similarity with the dnac associated with pmus. the putative protein sequences of the dnac genes associated with pmus from sly had 51% - 56% identity to that of pam <dig>  compared with 21% - 26% with the other pmu-associated dna helicases in oy-m.

sly <dig> is annotated as dnab, and is orthologous to pa <dig> , pam <dig> , aywb_ <dig>  and ap_ <dig> , with identities in brackets. sly <dig>  also annotated as dnab, is orthologous to a number of orfs in paa , ay-wb and oy-m, all of which seem to be associated with pmus. oy-m and ay-wb have only one orf annotated as dnac . the proteins from those putative genes had 52% identity to sly <dig>  which is annotated as dnai “primosome subunit”. in paa the orthologue is pa <dig> , which is annotated as “tmrna” – “putative dna replication protein”.

there appear to be two distinct types of pmu based on the arrangement of three to four key orfs. these orfs are annotated as tmk-a, dnac or b, dnag, and a conserved hypothetical protein  that appears to be associated with tmk-a. the arrangement of these orfs in ay-wb pmus is in the order  tmk-a, chptap, dnab, and dnag. in sly these orfs are  dnac, chptap, and tmk-a, with no dnag . in paa, the majority of pmus have the arrangement as found solely in sly; however, two of the ay-wb arrangements are also present. in oy-m, only one example of the sly arrangement can be detected, and that is in the pmu containing orfs 428– <dig>  although the dna helicase  is of comparable size to the dna helicases from pmus of sly, pam <dig> and pam <dig> are truncations of the respective orfs found in the sly pmus. consequently we conclude that this oy-m pmu seems to be accumulating errors and is possibly in the process of being eliminated.

there are a number of other putative genes that appear to be conserved in the pmus. two classes that seem to be associated with differences between paa and sly are those annotated as methylases, and those annotated as sigma factors associated with dna-directed rna polymerases.

there are  <dig> orfs in the sly genome that are annotated as rpod - dna-dependent rna polymerase. those orfs annotated as rpod are all associated with pmus and are quite distinct from the dna-dependent rna polymerase not associated with a pmu , which is annotated as siga. in paa there are five orfs annotated as flia . they are pa <dig>  pa <dig>  pa <dig>  pa <dig> and pa <dig>  there are also two orfs  annotated as “rna polymerase sigma factor”. in sly the orfs characterised as dna-dependent rna polymerase can be divided into four groups: siga, rpoa, rpob, rpoc, and rpod. the orfs annotated as rpod can be further divided into group a and group b. the rpod a &b groupings are complex because the protein sequences appear to be a mix of motifs that may be shared between otherwise distant sequences and not present in those seemingly more closely related. the groupings are more distinct when the 5′ utr regions are compared, as the regions of c.  <dig> bp  and c.  <dig> bp  are highly conserved . our assessment is that paa orfs annotated as flia are orthologous to rpod group b, whereas pa <dig> and pa <dig> are orthologous to rpod group a .

the conserved 5′ utr sequences of rpod appear at the boundaries of a number of insertion / duplication events. the boundary at one end of the exact duplications at position  <dig> &  <dig> in sly corresponds to the  <dig> bp 5′ utr of rpod gpa. furthermore at this boundary, sly <dig> appears to be disrupted by the intrusion of the 5′ utr of sly <dig>  another example of a gene having been altered by the intrusion of the 5′ utr of rpod is sly <dig>  annotated as methylase lladchia. there is 92% - 100% similarity at the nucleotide level over the  <dig> putative full-length lladchia orfs. sly <dig> differs significantly c.  <dig> nucleotides from the 3′ end of the gene. this sequence corresponds to the conserved  <dig> bp 5′ utr of sly <dig>  . the 5′ utr of rpod is also implicated in the differences between paa and sly. comparison of the syntenic differences between the two ‘ca. phytoplasma australiense’ isolates revealed that on at least seven occasions the junction where the gene order of the two genomes varied was at the conserved 5′ utr of rpod .

there are five putative modification methylases annotated in the sly genome, representing  <dig> orfs . they are yhhf, lladchia, hpaim, chpmethylase and xoriim. sly <dig> is annotated as hpaim, but the predicted protein sequence spans a number of methylases compared with the orfs from paa . apart from yhhf , which appears to have orthologues in all phytoplasma genomes, the other methylases tend to be specific to the candidatus species .

list of putative methylases reported in ‘candidatus phytoplasma asteris’ , ‘ca. phytoplasma australiense’ , and ‘ca. phytoplasma mali’  excluding those common to all five genomes. possible additional genes or gene fragments are given in brackets.

there are  <dig> copies of a conserved hypothetical protein - chpmethylase in sly. annotated as putative methylases, , they are either  <dig> or  <dig> aa in length, except for three copies which are truncations. they are very highly conserved, with the putative full length proteins having 82% - 100% identity over the common  <dig> aa stretch. there are nine copies in paa, but no apparent orthologues in oy-m, ay-wb or at. they have, however, 51% - 58% identity to a hypothetical protein from spiroplasma citri , the only match found in any other mollicute. these putative methylases are associated with pmus in all but two cases . sly <dig> is a truncation having only the first  <dig> aa at the amino terminus, while sly <dig> is a  <dig> aa protein with 97% - 98% identity with the other  <dig> aa paralogues. there is only one copy of lladchia in paa  where it is annotated as dam “site-specific dna methylase”. this has 90% - 97% identity at an amino acid level with the  <dig> full-length proteins in sly . there do not appear to be orthologues to this protein in any of the other published phytoplasma genomes. the closest match outside of ‘ca. phytoplasma australiense’ is to three putative methylases in ‘ca. phytoplasma asteris’. these orfs are aywb_ <dig>  pam <dig>  and pam <dig>  are annotated as “dam methylase”, and the percentage identity is much lower, at 38% - 40%. pa <dig> is annotated as “restriction enzyme alpha subunit” and is located in a pmu between blocks “h” and “i”. no orthologue is detected in sly; however, a blastp search revealed a 38% identity with apple proliferation phytoplasma genes atp_ <dig> and atp_ <dig>  which are annotated as n- <dig> dna methylases.

there are ten orfs in sly that are annotated as xoriim. five copies consist of a  <dig> amino acid protein and five orfs that are fragments. this gene is very highly conserved, with the full-length copies differing at only 3/ <dig> nucleotides, which results in two amino acid changes . it is annotated as a putative methylase, and the predicted protein has 46% identity to that of helicobacter acinonychis str. sheeba . another orf for which the closest match is to a helicobacter acinonychis str. sheeba orf  is sly <dig> , coding for a conserved hypothetical protein  <dig> aa in length. there are two other orfs in the sly  that are truncations of this protein, and they both also follow orfs that code for xoriim  . like xoriim, the putative amino acid sequence for this chp is very highly conserved, and differs at only  <dig> out of  <dig> aa residues , and the two fragments are identical to each other at a protein level. the 3′ end of sly <dig>  overlaps the 5′ end of sly <dig> by  <dig> nucleotides, which suggests that these two genes were possibly part of an operon. subsequently we have termed sly <dig> and paralogues: chpxap . two fragments of xoriim are present in paa  as consecutive orfs, which together cover the amino and carboxy termini of the putative complete gene. chpxap occurs as orf pa <dig>  pa <dig> is truncated when compared with the sly orthologue , and differs by only  <dig> aa over that length. the two truncations of chpxap in sly are part of an exact  duplication. in sly it seems as though xoriim has been duplicated by being incorporated into a pmu. the accompanying orf chpxap has only become partially incorporated and as a result the complete orf has not been successfully duplicated. because xoriim and chpxap are highly conserved in sly and paa, and these genes have not been reported in any other firmicute, the possibility that these genes have been acquired by lateral  gene transfer after the divergence of ‘ca. phytoplasma australiense’ and ‘ca. phytoplasma asteris’ is discussed below.

other genes involved in genome plasticity
as noted above, with the exception of ltra almost all genes repeated more than  <dig> times in sly are associated with pmus. paa, sly and oy-m code for orfs annotated as ltra, an intron ii reverse transcriptase. sly has eight orfs annotated as ltra, although five appear to be fragments of the three longer versions . paa has  <dig> orfs annotated as retron-type reverse transcriptase, although all appear to be truncations of the full length gene. at five locations the fragments are consecutive, because of in-frame stops caused by indels or single nucleotide polymorphisms .

the single orthologue in oy-m is pam <dig>  and two fragments have been reported from ‘ca. phytoplasma solani’: caj <dig>  and caj <dig> . the fragments from ‘ca. phytoplasma solani’ have 93% - 94% identity to that of pam <dig>  but only 71% identity with sly <dig> over that same area. no apparent orthologues have been reported in the other published mollicute genomes, although this gene appears to be present in other firmicutes such as the clostridia and lactobacilli. unlike other putative transposable elements found in sly, ltra does not appear to be closely linked to the pmus, with only  <dig> of the  <dig> orfs being within a pmu region. however, the gene appears to be associated with some genome rearrangements. sly <dig> , for example, appears to split a tra <dig> gene in two. when the  <dig> bp insert is removed , the tra <dig> has a restored orf. in paa, a  <dig> bp pmu is inserted in the orthologue of sly <dig> . between paa and sly, the  <dig> bases of the 5′ utr and c.  <dig> bases of the 3′ utr of ltra have a high degree of conservation , which may give an indication of the mode of action of this putative retron-type reverse transcriptase.

the putative peptides produced by the three reca fragments  constitute a protein that matches the complete reca of acholeplasma laidlawii . a putative full-length reca is present in apple proliferation phytoplasma . the preservation of these fragments may indicate that a functional reca protein is produced, and that these are programmed frameshifts. in sly the putative complete orf is interrupted by a single base deletion before the end of the first fragment, and a single base insertion before the end of the second fragment. the putative complete orf in oy-m is disrupted by single base mutations that introduce two additional in-frame stops. the two putative full length phytoplasma recas have 66% identity to each other at an amino acid level, and 58% to that of a. laidlawii. when compared with at reca, the identities are oy-m 63%, sly 61%, and a. laidlawii 60%.

discussion
sly is the largest phytoplasma genome sequenced to date, with the variation in size due to the number and size of pmus. this is evident in the comparison of paa and sly, two isolates of ‘ca. phytoplasma australiense’. a comparison of  <dig> genes not associated with pmus, reveals a difference between the two isolates of less than 1% at a nucleotide level. by contrast, a comparison of similar genes between oy-m and aywb  reveals differences of at least 4% - 5%. this very close phylogenetic relationship gives a unique insight into the variation occurring over shorter times of divergence in phytoplasma genomes, and thus provides additional insight into the evolution of these unique mollicutes.

the differences between sly and paa are not restricted to the number and size of pmus; there is also some variation in synteny. it is possible that a measure of changed gene order is due to misassembly of the sequencing data. the large amount of repeated sequences posed considerable problems in the assembly of sly. this is reflected in the fact that  <dig> clones from the 8– <dig> kb insert library needed to be completely sequenced before the final assembled contig could be established. however, identification of sequences that are unique to each isolate suggests that there are differences between the two genomes that could not simply be the result of one genome being misassembled.

there appear to be three main causes of plasticity in the ‘ca. phytoplasma australiense’ genomes. the first is pmus, the second is centred on the putative retrotransposon, ltra, and the third is the acquisition of new genetic material.

lateral gene transfer
in our analysis of sly, we have found an example of recent acquisition of genetic material that is most easily explained by lateral gene transfer . orfs sly005- <dig> are fragments of a putative methylase - xoriim, and the closest match by blastp search was to helicobacter acinonychis str. sheeba . the next putative orf in sly , which we labelled chpxap, codes for a chp, with the closest match being the next orf in helicobacter acinonychis str. sheeba . these two orfs have not been detected in any firmicutes other than ‘ca. phytoplasma australiense’, so consequently we deduce that this acquisition has occurred after the separation of ‘ca. phytoplasma australiense’ and ‘ca. phytoplasma asteris’. it is interesting to note that in sly, of these two orfs only the putative methylase seems to have become incorporated into the pmus and replicated six more times, whilst the chpxap appears twice more as amino terminal fragments only. furthermore, only one copy of xoriim and chpxap occurs in paa and this is outside a pmu. consequently we interpret this as being the likely site of initial introduction. in paa, however, these orfs have not been incorporated into a pmu for further dissemination. if this scenario is correct, then this also gives an indication of how quickly an orf can be duplicated once it is incorporated into a pmu.

retrotransposon
the gene ltra is annotated as intron ii reverse transcriptase. in ‘ca. phytoplasma australiense’ one copy of this gene  appears to be inserted into a tra <dig> gene – a putative insertion sequence  element. this corresponds with the characteristics of bacterial group ii introns in that they are inserted either between genes, or in mobile dnas, such as is elements or plasmids
 <cit> . when a  <dig> bp fragment was removed in silico, a putative complete tra <dig> protein sequence was restored. the inserted sequence comprised  <dig> bp 5′ utr,  <dig> bp orf, and  <dig> bp 3′ utr. this sequence was highly conserved in ‘ca. phytoplasma australiense’, and may provide an insight into the mechanism by which this sequence inserts into the phytoplasma genome. two mechanisms are reported by which ltra operates, one of which requires reca <cit> . while the putative genes ltra and three reca fragments are present in oy-m and sly, they are absent in ay-wb. the three reca fragments are also missing from paa, but this loss may be a recent event, as evidenced by the fact that paa and sly are very close phylogenetically, and the remnant is still present in oy-m. this could explain why there does not appear to be full length ltra in paa. possibly full length copies stopped being duplicated or reincorporated with the absence of reca, and the existing copies are accumulating errors and are in the process of being eliminated. if correct, then this may indicate that sly and oy-m produce a functional reca from three orf fragments by a mechanism such as ribosome slippage. translational frameshifting has been reported for insertion sequence family is <dig>  where the sequence can be divided between two overlapping reading frames orfa and orfb and a fusion protein produced by a − <dig> translational frameshift
 <cit> . the presence in sly of at least two is-like elements belonging to the is <dig> family  with orfs that seem to be arranged in this manner indicates that phytoplasmas possibly possess such a mechanism.

pmus
by far the greatest influence on genome variation in ‘ca. phytoplasma australiense’ is the pmu, which we estimated constituted 39% of the sly genome. bai et al.
 <cit>  identified clusters of genes in ay-wb and oy-m that were repeated throughout the genome. the presence of insertion sequences and other genes involved in recombination and repair strongly suggested that these clusters were mobile, and thus they were named potential mobile units 
 <cit> . when we further examined the composition of these gene clusters, we discovered that within each pmu there is an arrangement of three orfs, consisting of a dna helicase , a thymidylate kinase , and a conserved hypothetical protein that appears to be associated with tmk-a , which extends the identification of conserved pmu genes by arashida et al. <cit> . in sly, the order of these genes is dnac, chptap and tmk-a. this contrasts with the analogous gene set in ay-wb, which is orientated in the reverse order tmk-a, chptap and dnab, followed by an additional gene – dnag . both oy-m and paa have examples of both types of pmus, while ay-wb has just the one type. sly possesses only one type, although it does have a solitary dnab that appears to be a remnant of the ay-wb-type. it would appear therefore that there were at least two types of pmus present in the last common ancestor of ‘ca. phytoplasma australiense’ and ‘ca. phytoplasma asteris’. this supports the proposal of jomantine et al. <cit>  that these multi-gene clusters were introduced early in the development of the phytoplasma clade. it also appears that some form of competition has occurred, resulting in one type become predominant within each isolate. this presumably reflects the contribution of pmus to the fitness of the phytoplasma by acquiring or developing genes that endow the mollicute with extra capability. this could be through propagation of new genetic material that may be introduced by lgt, of which xoriim may be an example, or by creation of new genes by means of deletion, fusion and rearrangement.

methylases
a further difference between sly and paa is the type and number of putative methylases present. in paa, chpmethylase  is the dominant methylase with  <dig> copies, although  <dig> copies of a putative methylase  were detected, of which  <dig> appear to be fragments of the putative full-length protein. otherwise there are  <dig> other putative modification methylases annotated as lladchia , xoriim , hpaim , and “restriction enzyme alpha subunit”  that are present in  <dig> or  <dig> copies. in sly, at least  <dig> types were detected: chpmethylase , lladchia , hpaim , a fragment that has similarity with pa <dig>  and xoriim. although xoriim was present in paa, it was not associated with a pmu. no analogue of paa gene , annotated as a restriction-modification enzyme “restriction enzyme alpha subunit”, is present in sly.

at least one putative methylase is present in each sly pmu except for pmu <dig> and pmu <dig>  sly-pmu <dig> was identified as an abnormal pmu, as the dnac was spread over two orfs, and the tmk-a was truncated to the extent that it does not register as an orf. sly-pmu <dig> could be undergoing the same process. it is the smallest of all the putative pmus, encompassing a mere  <dig> bp, and the tmk-a for this pmu  is severely truncated.

methylases are associated with a number of functions in prokaryotes including nucleotide mis-match repair, dna protection and gene regulation and control. methylation has also been associated with transposition, so it is not surprising that they are closely associated with pmus. of the putative genes that occur in the phytoplasma genomes released to date, methylases appear to be the most diverse group, particularly those associated with pmus. apart from yhhf , which appears to have orthologues in all phytoplasma genomes, the other methylases tend to be specific to the candidatus species . it is not known if these proteins are functionally different, but if they are, then perhaps they play a role in producing the distinctive symptomology associated with each organism. even if the primary consequence of methylases in phytoplasmas has been to assist in the perpetuation of pmus, a secondary effect could be to alter the methylation of plant host genes, thereby causing developmental effects that are characteristic of phytoplasma-associated diseases. this could require these proteins to be exported from the mollicute into the host. alternatively, another mechanism such as rnai could be activated and genes involved with the methylation of plant host genes could be silenced. in this way, pmus could resemble pathogenicity islands present in other pathogenic bacteria.

analysis of the two isolates of ‘ca. phytoplasma australiense’ revealed the 5′ utr of the putative gene rpod to be very highly conserved. the 5′ utr is an area associated with gene regulation and control, and so a high degree of conservation would be expected. in ‘ca. phytoplasma australiense’, however, it seemed to present a discrete boundary associated with genome rearrangements. in sly, it marked the start of a c.  <dig> kbp exact repeat, and there are two occasions where an orf has been altered as a result of the intrusion of the 5′ utr of an rpod gene. this strongly indicates that the orf disruption is the result of an insertion event, with the 5′ utr of rpod being one of the boundaries of the inserted sequence. it has also featured as distinct junctions in ‘ca. phytoplasma australiense’ where the sequences of the two isolates differ. this supports our belief that these highly conserved sequences represent one boundary of these mobile units, and may help us to understand how pmus replicate throughout the genome. that only one boundary is discrete may reflect how the transposed sequence is integrated. presumably the discrete boundary reflects the origin of insertion, perhaps as a result of a double stranded break  and ligation reaction, analogous to the asymmetric t-dna insertions as a result of agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated plant transformations
 <cit> .

the inability to culture phytoplasmas axenically has undoubtedly hindered research into these important plant pathogens. despite this handicap, much is being discovered about these organisms, with genomics leading the way. as more and more genomes are published, it is anticipated that our understanding of the biology of phytoplasmas, including how they cause pathogenicity, will increase, eventually leading to robust methods for their control or elimination. such methods may involve targeting key phytoplasma-specific genes, or genes involved in pathogenicity using micrornas.

CONCLUSIONS
the complete assembled sequences of two closely related ‘ca. phytoplasma australiense’ genomes has provided an opportunity to understand the dynamic nature of phytoplasma chromosomes. although the housekeeping genes of the two isolates differ by less than 1% at a nucleotide level, the genomes vary considerably in size and in their syntenic organisation. this genome plasticity is caused by several factors, including the presence of a putative retrotransposon ltra. one mechanism for ltra to operate requires a functional reca, which might indicate that the reca gene, which in sly is fragmented by two indels, might actually produce a functional protein by a mechanism such as ribosomal slippage.

the main cause of variation between paa and sly is due to the proliferation of pmus – clusters of genes that are adept at spreading through the genome. in this paper we have identified a number of conserved genes and gene arrangements that appear to be core to these pmus. comparison of these core genes and their syntenic arrangement also leads us to conclude that there are at least two species of pmus in ‘ca. phytoplasma’. one key feature of these units, and one that possibly contributes to their fitness, is the acquisition of methylases. our analysis indicated that the complement of methylases seemed distinctive to each ‘ca. phytoplasma’ species. the putative methylase xoriim provided a possible explanation of how this occurs.

we believe that xoriim was acquired by ‘ca. phytoplasma australiense’ by lateral gene transfer. in sly it had been incorporated into a pmu and disseminated widely throughout the genome, whereas in paa it remained as a single copy outside a pmu.

we also identified a conserved area of the 5’ utr of the rpod gene that seems to be associated with a discrete boundary of the pmus. this should provide a guide to the mechanism of how these elements replicate and integrate into the genome.

identification of such factors could only be done by comparison of assembled genomes, and is vindication of the effort that went into ensuring that that occurred. the development of next generation sequencing will provide the opportunity for many more genomes to be sequenced in a timely and cost-efficient manner. some of the benefits of that data will only come about if there are robust assembled genomes for comparison, together with an understanding of how rearrangements occur. identification of units or components of the genome that are involved in genomic reorganisation, such as have been described in this paper, will assist with this next phase of phytoplasma genomic studies.
