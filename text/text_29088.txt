BACKGROUND
to prevent inflammation-related collateral tissue damage and immune pathology caused by an excessive immune response to autoimmune-related self-antigens or pathogen-associated antigens, the immune system has developed a diverse spectrum of mechanisms allowing efficient regulation and suppression of innate and adaptive immune responses that maintain a homeostatic environment. one important cellular component mediating the control of immune responses is regulatory t cells , which comprise various subpopulations. the so-called naturally occurring treg cells  have been described as being cd4+ t cells expressing high levels of the interleukin- <dig> receptor alpha-chain  and exhibiting immune-suppressive capability to self- and non-self-antigens  <cit> . the ntregs develop in the thymus along with conventional t cells and are considered to be the primary component for the establishment and maintenance of peripheral immunological self-tolerance  <cit> . later it has been found that ntregs in mice can be identified by the expression of the transcription factor  forkhead box p <dig>   <cit> .

mutations in the human foxp <dig> gene are linked to the immunodysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy x-linked syndrome , which is accompanied by a defect in the development of ntregs. this defect affects the peripheral tolerance and surveillance of auto-reactive t cells, thereby promoting systemic autoimmunity  <cit> .

interestingly, most mutations can be mapped to the forkhead-binding protein domain   <cit> , which mediates the general interaction of foxp <dig> with genomic dna  <cit>  and with foxp <dig> transcription factor binding sites  in particular. tfbss can be defined by consensus sequences that have been determined for foxp <dig> in several studies. de novo identification of human foxp <dig> consensus sequences revealed the sequence 5′-gtaaacaa-3′ <cit> . furthermore, in vitro optimization studies demonstrated that the sequence 5′-gtaaaca-3′ is preferred for foxp <dig> binding to dna  <cit> .

the human foxp <dig> gene consists of  <dig> exons encoding for various splice variants. besides the full-length  <dig> aa variant, three truncated transcript variants lacking exon  <dig> , exon  <dig> , or both  have been described  <cit> . however, the full-length and the Δ <dig> variant are the main isoforms and are equally expressed in resting human ntreg cells  <cit> . generally, all isoforms share the same protein domain entities: an n-terminal repressor domain, a c2h <dig> zinc-finger domain, a leucine zipper domain and a c-terminal fkh domain, which also contains a nuclear localization signal. although all known foxp <dig> isoforms share the fkh domain, it is important to note that foxp <dig> can also act as a co-regulator independent of the fkh binding domain  <cit> .

currently, the only contribution of foxp <dig> to a full ntreg phenotype that can be defined either by gene expression patterns or on a functional level exhibiting the whole bandwidth of ntreg suppressive mechanisms is under constant controversial discussion, especially in the human system  <cit> . nevertheless, because of their immune modulatory capability tregs are considered key candidates for therapeutic interventions aimed at treating a broad variety of immunological diseases. if we are to better define the role of foxp <dig> within ntregs, we must first gain knowledge about its condition-dependent global binding behavior, about its functional tfbss throughout the genome, and about its competence in regulating the expression of adjacent genes.

here we present the results of chromatin immunoprecipitation in combination with genomic tiling microarray  analysis of foxp3Δ <dig>  one of the main human foxp <dig> isoforms, ectopically expressed in a jurkat t-cell line under resting and mitogen-stimulated conditions. the main focus of the study was to investigate direct foxp3/dna interaction mediated by means of the fkh having direct impact on adjacent gene loci. the analyses revealed global distribution characteristics of human foxp <dig> tfbss and identified the cytokine il- <dig> as a previously unknown direct transcriptional target of foxp <dig> in activated t cells.

RESULTS
ectopically expressed foxp <dig> suppresses il- <dig> production in human t cells
to study foxp <dig> tfbss by chip-on-chip analysis, we generated a human t-cell line stably expressing foxp3Δ <dig>  jurkat t cells were retrovirally transfected with either a viral construct expressing foxp3Δ <dig> and green fluorescent protein  as a reporter  or an empty viral construct expressing only gfp . transfected gfphigh t cells were sorted and subsequently expanded in vitro.

foxp <dig> over-expression was confirmed by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction , flow cytometry, and western blot analysis, as shown in figure  <dig>  foxp <dig> mrna levels were nearly  <dig> times higher in j-foxp <dig> t cells than in j-gfp control cells or wild-type jurkat t cells. western blot analysis and intracellular foxp <dig> staining also confirmed foxp <dig> over-expression on the protein level exclusively in j-foxp <dig> t cells.

because interleukin- <dig>  is one of the best-studied direct target genes of foxp <dig>  with confirmed foxp <dig> binding sites in the il- <dig> promoter  <cit> , we confirmed the functionality of ectopically expressed foxp <dig> protein by evaluating its influence on il- <dig> production. we determined il- <dig> expression by using real-time rt-pcr  and intracellular cytokine staining followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting  analysis in untreated and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate /ionomycin–stimulated jurkat t cells . as expected, j-foxp <dig> t cells produced less il- <dig> on both the transcriptional level and the protein level than did control or wild-type cells, a finding demonstrating the ability of ectopically expressed foxp <dig> to suppress il- <dig> production. taken together, the generated j-foxp <dig> t cell line produced a functional foxp <dig> protein and thus met an important requirement for the subsequent chip-on-chip studies.

mapping of genomic foxp <dig> binding regions
it has been previously demonstrated that foxp <dig> binding capability is sensitive to cellular ca2+ influx and that it can be dramatically increased in t cells upon stimulation with pma and ionomycin  <cit> . therefore, we analyzed foxp <dig> tfbss in both resting and pma/ionomycin–activated j-foxp <dig> t cells in two independent replicate experiments involving a foxp3-specific chip procedure, as described in materials and methods.

our experiments identified  <dig> chip regions in resting j-foxp <dig> t cells and  <dig> chip regions in stimulated j-foxp <dig> t cells. more than 50% of these chip regions were smaller than  <dig> bp; this size provided a sufficient mapping resolution for the chip regions . the number of chip regions per chromosome in general was positively correlated with the overall size of the chromosome . a table of the identified foxp <dig> chip regions and a visualized genomic map can be found in additional file  <dig> 

foxp <dig> preferentially binds in intronic regions located + <dig>  kb from tss
to deduce biological meaning and more universal genome-wide characteristics of foxp <dig> binding, we had to link the identified chip regions to known genome annotations and thus to potential foxp <dig> target genes. to this end, we first used the cis-regulatory element annotation system   <cit>  to describe the positions of the chip regions in terms of known genomic feature annotation. figure 3a gives a summary of the annotation categories provided by the ceas database. according to the annotation, in both resting and stimulated j-foxp <dig> t cells more than 50% of annotated chip regions are located between the transcription start site  and - <dig> kb. this finding was not unexpected, considering the fact that this range reflects most of the entire promoter coverage area interrogated by the tiling microarray. however, nearly 40% of annotated chip regions are located within an intron and thus are situated within the comparably small range from tss to + <dig>  kb. the remaining chip regions  fall into the positional categories: 5′ untranslated region , exon, 3′ utr and immediate downstream. taken together, the findings of the ceas annotation show that foxp <dig> binds preferentially to intronic regions, independent of mitogenic stimulation.

to analyze the positional distribution of foxp <dig> tfbs in reference to the tss in more detail, we annotated the identified chip regions with the genomic position annotation tool   <cit> . gpat was used in the promoter search mode, and annotation results were restricted to the tiling array’s promoter coverage range . gpat annotation resulted in  <dig> annotated chip regions referencing  <dig> gene entities in resting j-foxp <dig> t cells and in  <dig> chip regions referencing  <dig> gene entities in stimulated j-foxp <dig> t cells. the distances from all annotated chip regions to the closest tss are presented in a histogram . interestingly, the positional distribution of chip regions downstream of tss shows a marked peak at an average distance of about + <dig>  kb from tss. this main peak can be considered to result from foxp3-bound intronic chip regions. however, the chip region distribution appears similar in both resting and stimulated conditions. a random compilation of chip regions matching the experimental region size and frequency distribution was further analyzed and underlined the meaning of the experiment-driven output of genomic positions for foxp <dig> binding.

pathway analysis of gene entities that were derived by gpat annotation and that represented potential direct foxp <dig> target genes was performed with genego software . especially under resting conditions, the analysis identified significant  enrichment of genes involved in pathways for co-stimulation of t cells, such as the cd <dig>  cd <dig>  icos, and ctla- <dig> signalling pathways. genes involved in pathways with general importance for t-cell activation, such as the nfat, akt, calcium and camp signaling pathways, were also overrepresented . of note, the il- <dig> signalling pathway also appeared to be affected  in the presence of foxp <dig> protein.

foxp <dig> binding to certain promoter regions is associated with transcriptional changes
to link the potential competence of identified chip regions to foxp3-dependent expressional changes in jurkat t cells, we performed whole-genome expression analyses and then determined the association between expression data and promoter occupation data derived from the chip-on-chip studies. expression analysis was performed on resting and pma/ionomycin–stimulated j-gfp and j-foxp <dig> t cells. finally, we applied an analysis strategy  to compile a list of  <dig> transcripts that exhibited foxp3-dependent transcriptional changes. expression data from these  <dig> transcripts were hierarchically clustered, resulting in  <dig> gene clusters. the complete set of microarray expression data is provided in additional file  <dig>  we combined the expression data with the gpat chip region annotation list to determine the association between observed expressional changes and the binding or absence of binding of foxp <dig> to the promoter region of a certain transcript. figure  <dig> shows the hierarchical clustering of the  <dig> regulated transcripts and also indicates whether and in which experimental condition the associated gene was found in the chip region annotation list. of the  <dig> regulated transcripts,  <dig> were associated with at least one chip hit in at least one of the two experimental conditions.

il- <dig> is a direct transcriptional target of human foxp <dig> transcription factor activity
in stimulated j-foxp <dig> vs. j-gfp t cells, the cytokines tgf-β <dig> , il- <dig>  and il- <dig>  were among the most down-regulated genes. their foxp3-dependent repression after treatment with pma/ionomycin was confirmed by real-time rt-pcr . interestingly, as shown in figure  <dig>  the observed down-regulation of il- <dig> in stimulated j-foxp <dig> t cells was accompanied by foxp <dig> binding only under stimulated conditions. thus, we hypothesized that il- <dig> might be a stimulation-dependent direct target gene of foxp <dig>  interestingly, the il- <dig> genomic locus is part of a small gene cluster comprising ifn-γ, il- <dig>  and il- <dig>  the il- <dig> gene lies on the minus strand of the human genome and encodes for  <dig> exons. figure 6a shows the local genomic situation at the il- <dig> locus in more detail.

interestingly, a reproducible foxp <dig> binding site can be found in proximity  to the il- <dig> tss, a finding suggesting that this site is responsible for the observed stimulation-dependent repression of il- <dig> expression in pma/ionomycin treated j-foxp <dig> t cells. a prerequisite for a direct foxp <dig> target gene is the occurrence of at least one foxp <dig> binding site in the gene’s promoter region. hence, under this aspect we analyzed the corresponding il- <dig> promoter chip region  with a length of  <dig> bp. figure 6b shows the dna sequence of the il- <dig> chip region on chromosome  <dig> and the corresponding foxp <dig> fkh consensus sequence  <cit> . strikingly, in the middle of the chip region there was a perfectly matching foxp <dig> consensus site with the following genomic coordinates: chr <dig>  <dig> –  <dig> . genomic site-specific real-time pcr of this binding region confirmed about 5-fold chip enrichment .

to ultimately check whether foxp3-dependent suppression of il- <dig> following pma/ionomycin treatment occurs in primary ex vivo isolated foxp3+ t cells as well, cd4+cd25+foxp3+ treg cells and naïve cd4+cd25-foxp3- t cells were isolated from healthy donors using macs technology. following  <dig> h of pma/ionomycin stimulation the cells were analyzed for foxp <dig> and il- <dig> expression in comparison to resting cells using real-time pcr . as expected, the fold induction of il- <dig> expression was significantly reduced  in foxp3+ treg cells compared to conventional naïve foxp3- t cells.

discussion
we chose to identify the functional genomic sites of direct dna occupation by foxp3Δ <dig> protein by using a combination of matching chip-on-chip and expression microarray data from human foxp3-expressing jurkat t cells under resting and stimulated conditions. mitogenic stimulation with pma and ionomycin ensures a strong simultaneous and swift t-cell activation circumventing the upstream t-cell receptor signaling, thereby allowing efficient triggering of its downstream signaling events, including activation of protein kinase c and triggering of ca2+ influx, both of which are known to increase foxp <dig> binding to genomic dna  <cit> . thus, our dataset allows us to distinguish foxp <dig> binding and reversal of binding under resting conditions from alterations in foxp <dig> binding behavior under stimulated conditions and to determine the direct impact on transcriptional alterations under the very same circumstances. since in previous human foxp <dig> chip studies by sadlon and colleagues  <cit>  and bierzele and colleagues  <cit>  only chip dna from stimulated cell material has been analyzed, our dataset provides deeper insights into condition-dependent foxp <dig> interaction with genomic dna.

the tiling microarray we used interrogates proximal promoter regions of genes , thereby defining comparatively narrow genomic regions predominantly with potential competence for direct transcriptional regulation of adjacent gene loci. we identified  <dig> chip hits with proximity to  <dig> gpat-annotated gene entities under resting conditions and  <dig> chip hits with proximity to  <dig> gpat-annotated gene entities under stimulated conditions. of  <dig> markedly foxp3-dependent transcripts, as defined by the expression microarray analysis,  <dig>  were associated with at least one chip hit within the promoter coverage range of the tiling microarray. the discrepancy between the much higher number of gene entities with nearby foxp <dig> chip hits within their promoter regions as opposed to the number of transcripts that are in fact transcriptionally altered has been observed in previous murine and human foxp <dig> chip-on-chip studies as well  <cit> . this finding stresses the apparent presence of numerous silent or ineffective yet specific foxp <dig> binding events in proximal promoters. however, about the biological meaning of such silent binding events can be speculated, but may for instance be explained in part by the interaction of foxp <dig> with other transcription factors that may attenuate or block its functional influence on the transcription of an adjacent gene.

to compare our annotated chip data to those from previous human foxp <dig> chip studies by sadlon  <cit>  and bierzele  <cit> , which similarly provide lists of experimentally identified foxp <dig> target genes, we matched all annotations to  <dig> known and approved unambiguous gene symbols provided by the hugo gene nomenclature committee   <cit> . our data represent  <dig> entries in resting j-foxp <dig> cells,  <dig> entries in stimulated j-foxp <dig> cells and  <dig> combined hgnc entries . data from sadlon et al. resulted in a set of  <dig> hgnc gene symbols, and data from birzele et al. resulted in a set of  <dig> hgnc gene symbols. combined, both sets represent  <dig> unambiguous gene symbols. consistently, 41%  of the gene symbols in our dataset are also present in the combined sadlon/birzele gene table. combining all four datasets separately resulted in an significant overlap of  <dig> loci  that have been consistently identified as targets for foxp <dig> binding . given all technical variances that had an impact on the four datasets, e.g., the source of the cell material  and the type of cell treatment  and its duration , it is likely that these  <dig> genes are highly important for determining the basic treg cell phenotype and function and are predominant targets of foxp <dig> under both resting and stimulated conditions. among these genes there are prominent ones such as ctla <dig>  nfat <dig>  nfkb <dig>  runx <dig>  and tnfsf <dig>  all of which have previously been substantially associated with treg phenotype, foxp <dig> interaction, or both  <cit> . 

both the foxp3Δ <dig> isoform and the foxp3Δ <dig> isoform can inhibit t-cell activation  <cit>  and contribute to the phenotype of human ntregs  <cit> . however, foxp <dig> exon  <dig>  which encodes for a portion of the foxp <dig> repressor domain, has been specifically shown to be essential for interaction with and repression of retinoic acid–related orphan receptors α and γt   <cit> . both the rorα and the rorγt tfs are in turn essential for th <dig> commitment of t cells  <cit> . thus, foxp <dig> expression is considered a key element preventing the establishment of a full th <dig> phenotype in t cells  <cit> .

however, in the context of t-cell plasticity some reports indicate that human rorγt+foxp3+ tregs exhibit the characteristics of both tregs and th <dig> cells. consistently, it has been shown that isolated il- <dig> producing foxp3+ t cells that express rorγt share features of conventional rorγt+ th <dig> cells. interestingly, rorγt+foxp3+ tregs cannot sufficiently produce il- <dig> after pma/ionomycin stimulation  <cit> . because we found that the presence of foxp <dig>  is sufficient to suppress the expression of the th17-related cytokines il- <dig> and, especially, il- <dig>  it is reasonable to speculate that the identified foxp <dig> tfbs in the il- <dig> promoter explains the inability of rorγt+foxp3+ t cells to produce il- <dig> on the transcriptional level.

CONCLUSIONS
we successfully applied a combination of the state-of-the-art chip-on-chip analysis and expression microarray analysis to identify direct transcriptional targets of the human tf foxp3Δ <dig> expressed in jurkat t cells under resting and mitogen-stimulated conditions. our results demonstrate that foxp <dig> prefers intronic regions, independent of the cellular activation status. notably, we found that genes important for the co-stimulation of t cells are transcriptional targets of foxp <dig>  in particular, we identified the th <dig> lineage-related cytokine il- <dig> as a previously unknown direct target gene of foxp <dig>  these results complete the picture of foxp <dig> as a transcription factor and demonstrate its competence as a transcriptional regulator.
