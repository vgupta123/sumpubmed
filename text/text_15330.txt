BACKGROUND
the development of functional genomic resources in wheat is critical for determining function, especially for genes controlling agronomic traits. the creation of such resources involves disruption of genes either by mutagenesis or gene knockout. extensively used, mutagenesis creates a large and discrete spectrum of lesions that are subsequently detected by forward or reverse genetic approaches. ethylmethane sulfonate  has been a long standing and popular choice to create mutagenized populations in a wide array of species . ems introduces mostly point mutations usually through alkylation of guanine resulting in gc to at transitions  <cit> . to date, mostly forward screening approaches have been used in wheat to identify mutants . however, owing to the large and complex polyploid genome of wheat, phenotypic screening-based forward genetic approaches are less likely to identify mutants for agronomically relevant genes. targeting induced local lesions in genomes , one of the reverse genetic approaches, is often the method of choice to identify mutants in a target gene of known sequence . tilling combines the use of chemical mutagenesis followed by application of mismatch detection assays or high throughput sequencing of pcr amplicons. along with the requirement of prior gene sequence information to generate pcr primers, tilling entails significant time and effort and seems to be a prohibitive approach in crops where genome sequence is not available. in bread wheat , despite the availability of considerable sequence information in expressed sequence tag  database, it is difficult to design genome-specific pcr primers because of the presence of three very closely related homoeologs.

a diverse set of publicly available mutants is needed in wheat to help assign function to its genes including potential candidates of agronomic importance. recent technical and bioinformatic advancements have made dna sequencing cheaper and more robust but not enough to perform complete genome sequencing of a large sized mutant population. thus, a rapid, facile, high throughput, and cost effective method to detect induced mutations in the polyploid genome of wheat is necessary. contemporary improvements in terms of high throughput sequencing platforms have facilitated the discovery of large-scale natural variation in several genomes including model  <cit>  as well as crop plants such as maize, sorghum, and soybean in a time and cost effective manner . sophisticated algorithms with improved accuracy in snp calling have been developed and are being applied to identify induced point mutations in diploid and tetraploid species  <cit> . applying high throughput sequencing technologies coupled with variant detection software will likely prove to be efficient in detecting mutations in bread wheat as well. furthermore, sequence-based detection of mutations will bypass the pre-requisites such as genome-specific markers needed for tilling and other currently used mutation detection methods.

bread wheat has a very large genome  of which it is estimated that 1– <dig> % represents coding sequence  <cit> . since mutations present in the coding regions of the genome are of main interest, any sequencing-based mutant detection strategy has to target the coding part of the genome. the use of reduced representation libraries followed by sequencing  is one such approach  <cit> . it reduces the genome complexity and targets the genic part of the genome by the use of methylation sensitive restriction enzymes. this approach also allows sample pooling that further reduces the per sample cost and it has been successfully used to assess natural sequence variation in a number of species including switchgrass  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , maize  <cit> , arabidopsis, and lettuce  <cit> . it should be equally beneficial to detect sequence variation present in mutant populations.

with a long-term objective of developing a community resource to quickly identify mutants for a target gene; here we report an efficient approach to identify induced mutations by accurately differentiating those from the sequence changes present among the three wheat homoeologs. the efficiency of the bioinformatics pipeline was tested by detecting the known sequence changes in the three wheat genes with known sequence for all the homoeologs and paralogs.

RESULTS
unigene-based reference sequence for hexaploid wheat
as an ordered genome sequence is not available for hexaploid wheat, we used the ncbi unigene build #  <dig>  as a reference transcriptome. as unigenes represent only the genic portion, thus the complexity of the wheat genome is further reduced. dataset contained  <dig> , <dig> sequences of which  <dig> % were mrna sequences,  <dig> % 5′ ests,  <dig> % other ests,  <dig> % 3′ ests, and  <dig> % high-throughput cdna  sequences. these sequences encompassed key developmental stages of wheat from cultivars chinese spring, recital, kitakei <dig>  norstar, valuevskaya, thatcher, atlas <dig>  scout <dig>  and stephens. alignment and clustering by ncbi of these sequences resulted in  <dig>  unique contigs, of which about  <dig> % were singletons and  <dig> % contained multiple sequences. functional annotation was available for merely  <dig>  % of the unigenes. the unigene length ranged from  <dig> bp to  <dig>  bp with an average length of about  <dig> bp. about  <dig> % of the unigenes were longer than  <dig> bp whereas the length of the remaining  <dig> % ranged from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp. the unigene set covered about  <dig> million basepairs  of the genic part of the wheat genome.

mapping of the sequence reads
genotyping-by-sequencing of the 24-plant apeki library using illumina hiseq <dig> platform  generated a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads. about  <dig> % of the reads contained the barcode and of these the  <dig>  % containing the remnant apeki cut site were selected  . these  <dig> , <dig> reads were further sorted into  <dig> files according to their barcode using a custom written perl script. plant #  <dig> had poor quality reads, thus it was not used for further analysis, reducing the dataset to  <dig> plants. the barcodes were removed and the read sequences were trimmed to  <dig> bases  . the number of reads among mutant plants ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig> , <dig>  whereas the average number of reads for the two wild type plants was  <dig> , <dig> . using the burrows-wheeler aligner   <cit> , these reads were aligned with the ncbi wheat unigene-based reference sequence . a very narrow range of mapped reads per plant was observed   and overall  <dig> % of the filtered reads mapped to the reference unigene sequence. among the  <dig> plants, the number of identified unigenes ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>   consistent with the number of reads generated from these plants .fig.  <dig> schematic diagram for mutation detection using novel application of genotyping-by-sequencing . a dna of  <dig> plants including  <dig> ems generated m <dig> and two wild types was digested with apeki followed by unique barcode  and common adapter  ligation. all samples were pooled together before pcr amplification. pooled sample library was evaluated for its quality and size. sequencing of the library was performed on illumina hiseq <dig>  b raw data files processed according to the filters described in methods section. differentiation of ems snps from homoeologous snps is shown from three mutant plants where homoeologous snp positions are marked in red and blue while mutational snps are highlighted in purple




sequencing reads of all mutants and two wild type plants were submitted to the national center for biotechnology information  sequence read archive .

sequence coverage and depth of unigenes
selected reads from the  <dig> mutant and the two wild type plants aligned with  <dig>  unigenes with an average unigene coverage of  <dig> % . not including the reads from wild type plants, all the mutants reads aligned with  <dig>  unigenes with an average coverage of  <dig> % . the unigenes coverage varied from  <dig> to  <dig> % with a maximum number of unigenes  with 11– <dig> % base coverage. eighty-eight percent  of the unigenes had coverage up to  <dig> % with the mapped reads. a similar distribution of unigenes in different base percentage coverage class is observed for  <dig> pooled mutants with minimum depth of  <dig> reads .fig.  <dig> distribution of mapped unigenes according to different classes of percent base coverage. a mapped unigenes from  <dig> mutant and  <dig> wild plants. b mapped unigenes from  <dig> mutant plants only. c mapped unigenes from  <dig> mutant plants only when minimum depth was set to  <dig>  x-axis represents the range of classes based on percent base coverage and y-axis represents the mapped unigene count



considering  <dig> plants, the read depth per unigene ranged from one to > <dig>  for  <dig> %  of the unigenes, the reads depth per unigene was ≤ <dig> whereas for  <dig> %  of the unigenes, the number ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . a similar pattern of read depth distribution per unigene was observed considering the reads from  <dig> mutants .  <dig> %  of the unigenes from  <dig> mutants were retained after filtering for a minimum depth of  <dig> reads per unigene and the maximum number of unigenes  fall into 11– <dig> read depth class .fig.  <dig> distribution of mapped unigenes according to different classes of read depth. a mapped unigenes from  <dig> mutant and  <dig> wild plants. b mapped unigenes from  <dig> mutant plants only. c mapped unigenes from  <dig> mutant plants only when minimum depth was set to  <dig>  x-axis represents the range of classes for read depth and y-axis represents the mapped unigene count. asterisk denotes range of one to ten reads in a and b and only ten reads in c




reads from the  <dig> plants were also sequentially aligned to analyze the pattern of change of depth and coverage for the mapped portions of the unigenes. sequential addition of samples was performed starting with the plant containing the least number of mapped reads to  <dig>  unigenes and culminating with the plant containing the highest number of mapped reads to  <dig>  unigenes. the number of unique unigenes increased with the increase in each sample addition up to a certain limit. thereafter, the number of unigenes increased at a decreasing rate. the percent unigene sequence coverage followed the same pattern whereas the depth per unigene showed the opposite pattern .

to verify that our pipeline is capturing all the sequence changes including homoeologous as well as mutational, a read depth analysis with constant coverage of  <dig> bp was performed . the number of captured changes per read were significantly higher when read depth was increased from  <dig> to  <dig>  however, the number of changes per read remained same with depth ≥  <dig> 

differentiating mutations from homoeologous changes
composite alignments of the selected reads from the  <dig> plants with the unigene set were evaluated based on different parameters in samtools .

alignment of all the selected reads from  <dig> plants with the unigenes revealed a total of  <dig>  variants including  <dig>  % snps and  <dig>  % indels. application of a qual ≥  <dig> filter reduced the number of variants to  <dig> , including  <dig>  % snps and  <dig>  % indels. of these sequence changes,  <dig>  met the criteria of dp <dig> per variant location and mq ≥  <dig>  further, using the criteria of requiring reads from two or more plants in an alignment around a sequence change,  <dig>  variants were retained.  <dig>  of these changes were sequence differences among wheat homoeologs as were present in more than one plant. about  <dig>  % of these changes were snps and  <dig>  % were indels. additionally, intervarietal changes constituting  <dig>  snps and  <dig>  indels were identified. the remaining  <dig>  sequence changes present in only one of the plants were thus categorized as ems mutations . about  <dig> %  of these changes were snps and the remaining  <dig> %  were indels. out of  <dig>  snp changes, homozygous mutations represented as 1/ <dig> or 0/ <dig> only in single plant constituted  <dig> % and heterozygous mutations represented as 0/ <dig> only in single plant constituted  <dig> %.

overall,  <dig>  mutational changes were observed in  <dig>  wheat unigenes with an average of two changes/unigene. for individual plants, the number of unigenes showing mutational changes ranged from  <dig> in plant #  <dig> to  <dig> in plant #  <dig>  consistent with the number of reads generated in these samples. of these mutational changes, the smallest number of mutational snps was observed in plant #  <dig> with only  <dig> sequence changes. the highest number of  <dig>  snps was observed in plant #  <dig> . on an average,  <dig> induced snp changes were observed for each plant. the average number of unigenes showing mutational snps per plant was  <dig>  similarly, a total of  <dig> ems induced indels were identified ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with  <dig> indels per plant . of these,  <dig> of the indels were due to insertions and  <dig> were due to deletions. the size of deletions ranged from one to three bp and the size range for the insertions was one to four bp.fig.  <dig> distribution of ems induced changes and unigenes in mutant plants at read depth  ≥ <dig>  ems induced snps and the unigenes harboring these snps. b ems induced indels and the unigenes harboring these indels. blue bar represents the number of ems snps in a and indels in b red bar represents the number of unigenes hit in a and b




characterization of the snps induced by ems
among all single base changes induced by ems,  <dig>  %  were transitions and  <dig>  %  were transversions . the most frequent transition was c → t  followed by g → a , a → g , and t → c . among transversions, c → a  was the most frequent followed by g → t , g → c , and c → g . the frequency of other transversions was: a → t , t → a , a → c , and t → g .fig.  <dig> characterization of snps induced by ems. x-axis denotes the type of changes and y-axis denotes the number of changes of each type



for each unigene hit by ems, the longest stretch of open reading frame was extracted using a custom perl script to categorize these sequence changes as synonymous or non-synonymous.  <dig> % were found to be synonymous and  <dig> % as non-synonymous.

distribution of ems induced changes
the  <dig>  ems-induced snps were present in  <dig>  unigenes with an average frequency of two/unigene. the number of ems-induced snps/unigene, referred as alleles, ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . about  <dig> % of the  <dig>  unigenes had only one snp change and  <dig> % had two changes.  <dig> % of the unigenes had three to five alleles per unigene. only  <dig> % of unigenes showed more than six changes per unigene. the  <dig> ems induced indels were present in  <dig> unigenes with an average frequency of one/unigene.  <dig> unigenes had both indels and ems induced snps. further, the unigenes harboring both indels and snps had an average of six snps compared to two in the unigenes containing only snps.fig.  <dig> distribution of allelic variation induced by ems in unigenes. proportion of unigenes carrying different number of alleles is shown in different colors



out of  <dig>  unigenes with ems changes, functional annotation was available only for  <dig> unigenes . therefore, we classified these unigenes based on the annotations given to rice genes using a highly stringent e-value of < 1e- <dig> using standalone ncbi batch blast . as a result, an additional  <dig>  unigenes were annotated and a large proportion  of which were classified as genes performing metabolic processes followed by  <dig> % annotated as expressed proteins.  <dig> % of each fell under the category of transcription factors and transposable elements . to localize the ems hit unigenes on the wheat chromosomes, in-silico mapping was performed using the mapped wheat est database  <cit> . using consensus physical maps, a total of  <dig>  ests were mapped on seven groups of chromosomes . standalone batch blast performed using fasta sequences of  <dig>  ems hit unigenes with the mapped  <dig>  est sequences at an e-value of ≤ 1e- <dig> assigned mapping position to  <dig> unigenes. mutations within each chromosome arm region were normalized to the total number of unigenes mapped to that region. wheat homologous group  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are more vulnerable to ems induced changes compared to group  <dig> and  <dig>  homologous group  <dig> and  <dig> showed intermediate susceptibility for mutational change . for homologous group  <dig> and  <dig>  more number of mutations was mapped on short arm whereas for chromosome group  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  more number of mutations was mapped on long arm. for chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  mutations were equally distributed on both arms. by and large, genes present in the distal regions of the chromosomes showed a higher tendency to be hit by ems followed by middle region and the least susceptibility shown by the genes present in the proximal regions .table  <dig> physical mapping of ems induced mutations to three regions on each arm of consensus chromosomes of all  <dig> groups of wheat



identification of mutations in target genes
we tested accuracy of our pipeline to differentiate mutational changes from homoeologous changes; and evaluated the possibility of identifying mutations in target genes by considering three genes viz. rht <dig> , taabcb <dig> , and c-ph <dig>   <cit>  for which complete gene sequence was available from the three genomes of hexaploid wheat. the accession numbers for rht <dig> – a, b and d copies are jf <dig>  jf <dig> and he <dig>  respectively. the ability of the pipeline to correctly detect homoeologous snps was tested on all the intervals of these genes where the sequenced reads were mapped. with a minimum depth of  <dig> reads, maximum coverage was  <dig> % for rht <dig> , followed by  <dig> % for taabcb <dig> , and  <dig> % for c-ph <dig> . analysis of the covered part of the three copies for each of the gene sequences from cultivar chinese spring revealed  <dig> homoeologous snps for rht <dig>   <dig> for taabcb <dig>  and six for c-ph <dig>  with the minimum depth of  <dig> reads for each change, our analysis pipeline revealed  <dig> homoeologous snps for rht <dig> and  <dig> for taabcb <dig>  none of the six homoeologous changes for c-ph <dig> were detected by our pipeline. one ems induced snp was identified for each of the rht <dig> and taabcb <dig> gene while two ems induced snps were identified for c-ph <dig> gene in the ems treated plants.

similar analysis performed with redefined parameter  identified  <dig> homoeologous changes for rht <dig>   <dig> for taabcb <dig>  and three for c-ph <dig> the number of ems induced snps increased to two for taabcb <dig> and four for rht <dig>  no mistakes were detected with both the stringent  and redefined  criteria to detect and differentiate homoeologous and induced sequence changes, thus validating our pipeline to efficiently differentiate homoeologous snps from ems induced changes.

the empirically developed redefined criteria of detecting changes were then used to identify mutational changes. with the new procedure, a total of  <dig>  mutational snps were identified compared to the  <dig>  that were previously detected. the number of unigenes showing mutational changes increased to  <dig>  compared to  <dig> . furthermore, in the redefined criteria, the number of ems induced snps, homoeologous snps and indels, intervarietal snps and indels increased to  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. ems induced snps ranged from  <dig> in plant #  <dig> to  <dig>  in plant #  <dig> and the average number of ems snps detected was  <dig>  from an average of  <dig> unigenes hit per plant. though the largest and smallest insertion and deletion remained the same as that of the previous criteria, redefined criteria resulted in  <dig> more ems induced indels  ranging from no indels in plant #  <dig> to  <dig> in plant #  <dig>  on an average, each plant had  <dig> indels. if only ems induced snps are considered, the allelic variation generated per unigene by ems varied from a minimum of one to a maximum of  <dig>  the frequency of unigenes’ class carrying single alleles reduced by  <dig> %, two and three alleles each increased by  <dig> %, four–five alleles increased by  <dig>  %, six–ten alleles remained same, and 11– <dig> alleles increased by  <dig>  % as compared to the previous classification.

mutation rate and ems induced mutation calling error rate
alignment of reads from all mutant plants with the wheat unigenes covered  <dig> , <dig> bp. with the first criteria,  <dig>  mutational changes were identified, thus, resulting in one mutational change per  <dig>  kb of the wheat genome. with the redefined criteria,  <dig>  mutational changes were identified equaling one change per  <dig>  kb. only  <dig> %  of the wheat genes showed mutational changes in  <dig> mutagenized plants. error in mutation calling was determined by utilizing the stringent criterion in the variant calling protocol  for wild type plants. using the retained variants of  <dig>  after application of qual ≥  <dig>  dp <dig> per variant location, mq ≥  <dig>  and presence of reads from two or more plants in an alignment, the number of variants showing presence of wild-type reads as well were determined. wild-type reads were present for  <dig>  variants. any mutation showing up in the wild type plants can only be due to error. treating the wild-type plants in a similar manner to mutant plants, if we found an occurrence of 0/ <dig>  0/ <dig>  or 1/ <dig> only in the wild type plant as compared to a uniform genotype for the rest of the mapped samples, we considered it as an error in calling ems induced mutation. for  <dig> variants out of  <dig> , 0/ <dig>  0/ <dig>  or 1/ <dig> genotype was present only in the wild type plant resulting in an error rate  <dig>  %. while using the redefined criteria an error rate of  <dig>  % was observed in the wild type plant.

discussion
tilling has been a popular method to identify mutations in a target gene sequence. the selected plants undergo extensive characterization and the identified mutants are eventually confirmed by sequencing of the target gene. tilling requires a significant amount of time to identify mutants for a large number of genes. with plummeting sequencing costs, sequencing based genotyping is routinely used and mutation detection is beginning to rise  <cit> . here application of a gbs approach has been tested and shown for the first time to be an efficient method for the discovery of induced mutations in polyploid species such as wheat. the discovery of induced mutations using this method and the analysis pipeline are expected to increase in wheat with the availability of genome sequence for all the genes in wheat. the method described here and the pipeline developed can be easily utilized for diploid species. large scale mutation detection is feasible using gbs as we have identified nearly five times larger number of genes than that of previous studies  <cit> .

despite the equal amount of dna used per plant, the number of reads generated in individual samples composing the apeki library had a higher coefficient of variation than reported in elshire et al.  <dig>  however, a 12-fold difference was observed in the number of reads generated in a barley experiment  <cit> . also, different sequencing platforms can result in a large variation in the number of reads generated per sample  <cit> . one limitation of gbs for mutation detection using single-end reads is that it is not possible to remove duplicate reads. non-removal of duplicate reads could increase the errors caused by pcr but removal of these reads would also significantly decrease the depth and subsequently loss in identification of low level mutations. irrespective of the number of reads generated per sample, the number of mapped reads showed a consistent value . however, the number of ems induced changes increased proportionally in the plants containing higher number of selected reads. alignment of only  <dig> , <dig> reads to the reference transcriptome can be attributed to the lack of a comprehensive wheat reference genome. in order to investigate how much over or under representation is exhibited by wheat unigenes in the form of  <dig>  sequences, batch blast was performed using three types of rice databases viz. rice cds consisting of  <dig>  loci including  <dig>  te loci, rice cds consisting of only  <dig>  non-te loci and  <dig>  cdna sequences as query against wheat unigenes. comparison of these datasets was performed under different e-values ranging from ≤ 1e- <dig> to ≤ 1e- <dig> .  <dig> % of the rice genes were covered with the wheat unigenes. the paradigm shown by adding sequential addition of samples for unique unigenes, unigene sequence coverage, and depth suggests that higher multiplexing can be done during library preparation while cutting the cost of mutation detection to redistribute the number of reads towards coverage rather than depth. however, more coverage of unigenes may also be targeted by using a two enzyme gbs approach  <cit> .

next-generation sequencing experiments are becoming a routine to find rare or novel variants leading to disease problems in humans  <cit> . however, sequencing artifacts are naturally associated with these experiments and can conceal the identification of true variants. usually, two main parameters – read depth and phred score are employed to curtail the variants . the high penalty imposed by these filters often removes the real variants. to overcome these limitations, we used these parameters in a more liberal way. however, we added an additional set of filters due to the hexaploid nature of the wheat genome. by using a combination of moderate read depth, phred score, mq  <dig> and presence of ems induced variant only in single plant, we separated a large portion of the homoeologous variants, while retaining the highest possible number of ems induced variants.

for the variant to be induced by ems, we computed the gq for the plant yielding the change which is based on the likelihood of a particular genotype being called in comparison to the likelihood of the other two genotypes being called: l versus l and l. the low gq suggests a low confidence in those calls, which may be due to poor individual sequencing reads. so all the ems variants were retained that showed a high gq . we chose to have a read depth of  <dig> assuming at least 3x coverage from each of the three homoeologous copies. ems induced change was called when the change was present only in single plant as it is very unlikely that a similar mutation will be consistently produced at the same particular location. in addition to rapid identification, sequencing based mutation detection also offers simultaneous mapping of these mutations.

we expect that one of the possibilities of not detecting all the homoeologous snps in the three genes tested with the redefined criteria is due to the alignment of only those copies of the gene that do not possess the homoeologous snp or no homoeologous snp exists at that location due to the intervarietal differences. however, the reads mapped to respective genes showing homoeologous changes can be easily used to generate snp based markers for genotyping studies, provided those changes are conserved in different cultivars. while various pipelines are available that can be employed to differentiate between true and false variants  <cit> , we focused on developing an analysis pipeline that is easy to use, adopt and applicable particularly for polyploid species.

our analysis clearly indicates that genes differ in their susceptibility to ems as the range was much wider  compared to average number of two snps/unigene. it is also evident that ems mutations are unevenly distributed among the wheat genes and on wheat chromosomes. only  <dig>  unigenes out of  <dig>  showed ems changes. further, genes present at the distal ends of the chromosomes showed higher rates of mutation compared to those present in the proximal region. characterization of this mutant population through the screening of several unigenes revealed mutation densities of average one mutation per  <dig> kb . this mutation density is higher than those found by earlier studies based on tilling . the expected array of mutations in an ems-treated population is primarily gc/at transition. in wheat, the majority of the identified mutations are gc/at transitions  <cit> . in this study, we also found a preponderance of gc to at transition , though at a lower level. large deletions  and insertions  were reported in rice  <cit> , but our pipeline does not seem to be capable of detecting huge indels however it clearly shows small indels caused by ems mutagenesis. the ability to detect two or more allelic versions caused by ems in  <dig> % of the unigenes emphasizes the potential of this strategy to accelerate the pace of wheat functional genomics.

our first analysis identified a total of  <dig>  ems induced snps in the  <dig> plants with a range of  <dig> to  <dig> . with an error rate of  <dig>  % and about  <dig> % of the mutational changes in the non-synonymous bases, the effective ems induced snps would be  <dig> . since, on average  <dig> % of the unigene sequence was covered for  <dig>  unigenes, extrapolation of these numbers for  <dig> % unigene coverage will result in  <dig>  effective number of mutations. for  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig>  mutational changes are expected.

CONCLUSIONS
this study represents a simple but accurate pipeline to reliably differentiate the mutational changes from the homoeologous changes in a polyploid species. we conclude that sequencing based mutation detection is a valuable method to identify induced mutations at large. by utilizing this reverse genetic approach in the future, more mutagenized populations can be characterized in a time efficient manner. ems mutations show bias for different genes present at different locations on the chromosome. genes present at the distal ends of the chromosomes showed higher rate of mutation compared to those present in the proximal regions. therefore, ems will serve as a desirable mutagen if the genes of interest are localized towards the telomeric regions.
