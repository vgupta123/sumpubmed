BACKGROUND
aspergillus flavus is a ubiquitous fungus and a plant and animal health concern. it can colonize seeds of maize, peanuts, cotton, and tree nuts during development and contaminate them with the carcinogenic secondary metabolite, aflatoxin , which affects food safety and agricultural trade  <cit> . a. flavus is also the second leading cause of aspergillosis in humans and the leading causative agent of chronic indolent invasive sinonasal infection in immunocompetent patients  <cit> .

due to the significant health and economic impacts of af contamination, much attention has been paid to the biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology of the af biosynthetic pathway  <cit> . the genes encoding the biosynthetic pathway are clustered in a  <dig> kb region of the chromosome  <cit> . many factors, such as nutrition, ph, temperature, exogenous stress, and fungal development have been observed to affect af production  <cit> . however, it still remains unclear how these factors influence af production and how regulatory elements such as the aflatoxin pathway transcription factor aflr are controlled.

an available genome sequence of this fungus holds promise in addressing important questions concerning pathogenicity and the regulatory elements involved in af biosynthesis. future studies will require an efficient and reproducible a. flavus transformation system. a successful transformation system relies on effective selectable markers, a highly efficient and reproducible transformation procedure, and a rapid and reliable screening procedure for transformants. the most commonly used method to select for genetic transformants in aspergillus species utilizes auxotroph complementation. while such selection can be effective, it requires that the recipient strain be mutated for auxotrophy  <cit>  and it is difficult to generate a double mutant strain for genomic analysis.

marker genes encoding resistance to antibiotics have been used in genetic engineering and molecular biology research in various organisms  <cit> . unfortunately, a. flavus and many other species of aspergillus are relatively resistant to these antibiotics, rendering them unusable as selectable markers. the antibiotic phleomycin has now been widely applied in transformation of plant and animal cells, and fungi  <cit> . however, there is no report, to date, utilizing this antibiotic for a. flavus transformation. we described here the use of phleomycin resistance combined with uracil auxotrophy for a. flavus transformation. this technology allows the creation of double mutant strains and the transformation of prototrophic strains of a. flavus.

gene disruption and overexpression play central roles in the analysis of gene function related to aflatoxin biosynthesis. homologous recombination is, in principle, the most efficient method of disrupting or replacing a target gene. however, deletion of many genes is not expected to result in a readily detectable phenotype, and no data on the frequency of gene replacement in most organisms  is available. establishing a simple and reliable method for screening transformants is important for detecting transformants which have the correct gene deletion/replacement from within a large pool of transformants. pcr  is among the assays that have been applied to the rapid screening of transgenes. dna extraction is usually the most time-consuming requirement of this process and this can hinder its effective deployment when either a large number of samples need to be analyzed or when there is only a small amount of material for dna extraction  <cit> . dna extraction protocols for fungi  <cit>  are inefficient in releasing the cellular contents from mature hyphae or spores. we report a rapid pcr-based screening method for identifying transformants of a. flavus.

RESULTS
sensitivity of a. flavus to antibiotics
the resistance of a. flavus  <dig> to kanamycin  and hygromycin  was tested because they have been used widely in other systems and are relatively inexpensive. spores of a. flavus  <dig>  were inoculated onto mm plates  supplemented with kanamycin at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> μg/ml, or hygromycin at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> μg/ml. no sensitivity to either antibiotic was detected at any of the tested concentrations. similarly, growth of a. flavus spores  was not inhibited on ypd medium supplemented with either  <dig> or  <dig> μg/ml of nourseothricin. in contrast, growth of a. flavus was inhibited on mm medium amended with  <dig> μg/ml or  <dig> μg/ml phleomycin. medium ph affected the activity of phleomycin. no growth was detected at either concentration of phleomycin when the ph of the medium was  <dig> ; however, inhibition of growth was inconsistent on medium at ph  <dig> .

phleomycin as a selection marker in a. flavus transformation
to examine the potential for phleomycin as a selectable marker for transformants of a. flavus, strain  <dig> was transformed with pbc-phleo, a construct containing the ble gene for phleomycin resistance controlled by the a. nidulans gpda promoter and the s. cerevisiae cyc <dig> terminator  <cit> . transformants were clearly visible on phleomycin-containing mls medium after  <dig> days of incubation at 37°c. selection of stable transformants was enhanced at ph  <dig>  as compared to ph  <dig> . a few colonies were found on the no-dna transformation control plates when the protoplasts were plated onto mls medium containing  <dig> μg/ml of phleomycin at ph  <dig> . in contrast, no growth was observed in the control plates at either  <dig> or  <dig> μg/ml of phleomycin when the ph was adjusted to ph  <dig> 

the concentration of phleomycin in the regeneration medium also affected the selection of stable transformants. twice as many colonies were observed when transformants carrying pbc-phleo were plated on mls plus  <dig> μg/ml of phleomycin versus  <dig> μg/ml . to determine the stability of these transformants,  <dig> colonies from media amended with each phleomycin concentration were plated first on non-selective pda medium  and then later transferred to both pda  and pda  supplemented with  <dig> μg/ml of phleomycin. only those transformants that grew equally well on pda plus phleomycin as on pda were considered stable transformants. after three transfers, only  <dig> of  <dig> colonies from the original plate selected on  <dig> μg/ml of phleomycin maintained resistance to phleomycin. conversely,  <dig> of  <dig> colonies selected on  <dig> μg/ml of phleomycin remained phleomycin-resistant after subculturing. thus both  <dig> μg/ml phleomycin and  <dig> μg/ml were inhibitory to fungal growth, but more stable transformants were obtained using  <dig> μg/ml of phleomycin. when  <dig> μg/ml of phleomycin was used for selection, we were able to consistently obtain transformants with a single integration of the ble gene as shown by southern analysis .

isolation of pyrg mutants of a. flavus nrrl 3357
no uracil auxotroph of a. flavus strain nrrl  <dig> is available. because the genome sequence is complete for this strain, the selection of a uracil mutant will allow genetic transformation of this strain by established protocols and facilitate studies on its pathogenicity and toxin production. a. flavus nrrl  <dig>  was inoculated onto plates containing mm medium  supplemented with 5-fluoroorotic acid  at  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , or  <dig>  mg/ml. no growth was observed on any plates containing foa. conidia of a. flavus  <dig> were subjected to nqo mutagenesis and incubated on mmu containing  <dig>  or  <dig>  mg/ml of foa at 30°c for one week. a total of  <dig> colonies were randomly selected from both foa-containing media. the colonies were cultured on either mmu or mm simultaneously for three generations, and then transferred to four different media  to confirm and identify pyrg mutants. six colonies originally selected on  <dig>  mg/ml foa grew on all four media, indicating they were foa resistant mutants but not uracil auxotrophs. in contrast eight colonies originally selected on medium contained  <dig>  mg/ml foa grew on mmu and mmu plus foa but not on mm and mm plus foa, indicating they were foa resistant mutants and uracil auxotrophs.

thin layer chromatography  analysis confirmed that eight colonies selected still possessed the ability to produce aflatoxin . the ability of the pyrg mutant to produce aflatoxin is essential for studies designed to examine aflatoxin biosynthesis. mutant colonies # <dig>  # <dig>  and # <dig> were randomly chosen for quantification of af production using hplc. these three strains produced aflatoxin concentrations comparable to the original strain  <dig> . the mutants were designated a. flavus strains 3357- <dig>  3357- <dig>  and 3357- <dig> 

* the ph value of the medium was measured after culturing for  <dig> h.

transformation of mutant 3357- <dig> with the heterologous pyr <dig> gene from neurospora crassa and pyrg gene from a. nidulans was performed to further confirm this putative pyrg mutant. transformants of either the pyr <dig> gene or pyrg gene exhibited a uracil-prototrophic phenotype, which appeared to be stable for more than  <dig> generations. comparison of this strain with the original strain  <dig> showed that there were no phenotypic differences when cultured at different temperatures  or at different phs . however, the growth of mutant 3357- <dig> was a little slower than the wild-type  <dig> when cultured on pda supplemented with only uracil. the growth of the mutant is improved when the medium is supplemented with both uracil and uridine .

strain 3357- <dig> was also used for transformation using the phleomycin marker . a gene knockout for a rho-dissociation inhibitor was created in 3357- <dig> by use of the pyr <dig> gene to complement uracil auxotrophy; this strain was then complemented with the native gene using the pbc-phleo vector. in another transformation using the ble gene, strain 3357- <dig> was transformed with a plasmid designed for overexpression of a gtpase while retaining the pyrg mutation.

factors affecting transformation of a. flavus
we evaluated factors responsible for efficient transformation of a. flavus through introduction of circular and linear dna into a. flavus strain 3357- <dig>  cell wall lysis and protoplasting were accomplished using the mixture of enzymes as described in the methods section. we found that the composition of the digestion buffer influenced the number of transformants obtained from the transformation protocol. a buffer consisting of 7% nacl,  <dig> mm napo <dig>  and  <dig>  mg/ml bsa produced protoplasts which gave a transformation efficiency of 200– <dig> colonies per μg of pbsk-pyr <dig> dna. the addition of bsa to the enzyme solution greatly increased transformation efficiency in this system .

using this protocol we found two types of transformants after 2– <dig> d of incubation on mls at 37°c. type  <dig> colonies  grew fast and sporulated normally. the majority of transformants were type  <dig> colonies, which failed to grow past the initial growth observed after  <dig> or  <dig> h of incubation, and almost none sporulated. to determine whether these two types were stable transformants, individual colonies were picked onto pdau and incubated for 2– <dig> d at 30°c. the picked transformants were then transferred to both pdau and pda medium, grown for an additional 2– <dig> d, and serially transferred from pdau to both pdau and pda for 4– <dig> iterations. more than 90% of the type  <dig> colonies remained prototrophic for uracil after the serial transfers while only 3% of the type  <dig> colonies were prototrophs. in an attempt to increase the number of stable type  <dig> colonies, the following regeneration media were examined:  <dig>  m sorbitol;  <dig>  m sorbitol;  <dig>  m 2so <dig> ;  <dig>  m 2so <dig> ;  <dig>  m 2so4;  <dig>  m kcl;  <dig>  m kcl;  <dig> m sucrose; and  <dig>  m sucrose. none of these media improved the stability of the type  <dig> transformants. interestingly, we found similar stable transformation frequencies when either the pyr <dig> or the pyrg gene was used to complement the uracil mutation; however, no type  <dig> colonies were observed in the transformation using pyrg for complementation.

co-transformation of pyr <dig> and ble genes and comparison of transformation frequency between these two genes
co-transformation of a. flavus strain 3357- <dig> with  <dig> μg pbsk-pyr <dig> and  <dig> μg pbc-phleo was performed using mls regeneration medium  supplemented with either  <dig> μg/ml phleomycin plus uracil, or  <dig> μg/ml phleomycin only, or neither phleomycin nor uracil. after  <dig> d of incubation,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> colonies were obtained on mls + phleomycin + uracil , mls , and mls + phleomycin  respectively. we observed that the transformation frequency  differed between pbsk-pyr <dig> and pbc-phleo. the transformation frequency of pbc-phleo is much higher than pbsk-pyr <dig> upon co-transformation and when transformed separately.

colony pcr analysis to identify a gene knockout strain
a gene predicted to be a superoxide dismutase  was deleted in a. flavus 3357- <dig> using an overlap pcr technique  <cit>  . various genomic dna extraction procedures that included using germinated conidia, heating conidia in a microwave oven, digesting conidia via an enzyme cocktail , treating conidia with sds plus phenol, or ctab were attempted. pcr was performed to identify deletion mutants following selection on uracil-deficient medium. we found the ctab dna extraction method to be efficient and to yield repeatable results. figure  <dig> shows the results of colony pcr from genomic dna extracted using the ctab method, using the primer pairs p <dig> and p <dig> to identify the transformants. a pcr product of  <dig> bp in length identifies the native locus . alternatively, a pcr product of  <dig> bp in length identifies gene replacement by the pyr <dig> marker gene . the presence of pcr products of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp in length indicates that the gene deletion construct inserted ectopically in the a. flavus genome . to further confirm if the target sequence was replaced by pyr <dig>  another set of pcr was performed for selected knockout mutants sod# <dig>  and sod# <dig>  using primer pairs p <dig> and p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  and p <dig> and p <dig> . we found that the target sequences in these  <dig> knockout mutants were exactly replaced by the gene deletion construct through homologous recombination. further southern blot analysis confirmed that there is only one copy of pyr <dig> in the genome of sod# <dig> strain and that strain sod# <dig> may have one or more ectopic copies in addition to the site directed integration .

discussion
we developed a new transformation protocol for a. flavus based on phleomycin resistance. to our knowledge this is the first report of phleomycin being used as a marker for a. flavus transformations. one factor important for the success of this procedure is the ph of the regeneration medium containing phleomycin. we found a. flavus to be the most sensitive to phleomycin at ph  <dig> . interestingly, this ph differs from the optimum ph for selection of n. crassa transformants. austin et al.  <cit>  found ph  <dig> – <dig>  to give the best selection of n. crassa transformants. also important for the selection of stable transformants using this marker is the concentration of phleomycin in the regeneration medium. while phleomycin at  <dig> μg/ml resulted in more apparent transformants, they did not maintain stable resistance upon subculturing. we found that regeneration of transformed protoplasts on medium containing  <dig> μg/ml phleomycin to result in a higher percentage of stable transformants.

other commonly used chemicals for selection of transformants were examined in our study. neither hygromycin, kanamycin, nor nourseothricin were found to be toxic to the fungus. our results on the toxicity of hygromycin differ from those of ramesh et al. who reported the disruption of the serine proteinase gene  in a. flavus using the hygromycin resistance gene as a selectable marker  <cit> . this discrepancy may reflect a genetic difference between the two strains examined.

the ability to use phleomycin in a tranformation protocol for nrrl  <dig> allows a researcher to avoid using the complementation of an auxotrophic mutation for selection of transformations, which is currently the most commonly used procedure for the aspergilli. this is important for two reasons. first, the generation of auxotrophic mutants often requires a mutagenic agent, which may result in other changes in the strain that may not be readily apparent. second, auxotrophic strains can be problematic when used in pathogenicity studies. this second point is particularly true if it is desirable to characterize the function of a gene by first doing a gene deletion and then adding a functional gene back in the same strain. such a comparison would require two auxotrophic mutations, one of which would not be complemented in the gene deletion mutant. the presence of the nutritional mutation may compromise the growth of the gene deletion strain on natural substrates that cannot be supplemented with the necessary nutrient. we demonstrated in this study that phleomycin selection can be used to complement the function of a gene previously deleted in the same strain by a dna deletion construct containing pyr <dig> 

the transformation efficiency differed among the two selectable markers. a percentage of the pyr <dig> transformants formed tiny abortive type  <dig> colonies, which was reported before in our laboratory  <cit> . this phenomenon also has been observed in transformation of a. nidulans with the heterologous a. nidulans trpc gene  <cit>  and n. crassa pyr <dig> gene  <cit> . in contrast, fewer of the ble and the pyrg transformants formed type  <dig> colonies.

in this study also we provide an improved protocol for genetic transformation of a. flavus. regardless of the selective marker, an efficient transformation protocol remains critical to functional analysis. several conditions were examined in the existing protocol developed in this lab  <cit> . the most significant increase in transformation resulted from the addition of bsa to the digestive mixture used to release the protoplasts. the addition of bsa in digestion mixture has been used for protoplast isolation of tuber borchii, aspergillus sp., and penicillium brevicompactum  <cit> . the effect of bsa is not always positive, and thus its effect may be species specific. we found the addition of bsa in the protoplast-generating buffer to be critical for increasing the transformation efficiency of a. flavus. the positive effect of bsa is unknown, but may be related to the overall quality of the protoplasts from a. flavus. the changes made in the protocol consistently improved transformation efficiency of a. flavus. both circular plasmid and linear pcr products were transformed into a. flavus with high frequency. we could also easily obtain co-transformants of plasmids containing the phleomycin-resistance marker and plasmids containing the pyr <dig> marker, which provides a powerful tool for the introduction of any non-selectable genetic material into a. flavus.

we further tested a. flavus strain 3357- <dig> to see if it could be used for gene disruption experiments. we generated a pyr4-containing disruption construct of a putative superoxide dismutase gene and used it to transform strain 3357- <dig>  we obtained several transformants and characterized them by pcr. the results from pcr  showed that many of the transformants contained the full length knockout construct. a large percentage of these also contained the native gene indicating ectopic integration. this result is similar to what we have obtained with other knockout constructs. in order to further test for gene disruption, we performed a southern analysis. we chose two transformants, sod# <dig> and sod# <dig>  based on the number of bands generated by pcr. we used a full length pyr <dig> probe to test for multiple integration events. consistent with a single site directed integration event, we observed one band with sod# <dig>  two bands were observed with sod# <dig> indicating one or more ectopic integrations .

another important consideration for high throughput functional genomics is the selection of transformants because the transformation efficiencies of filamentous fungi remain low compared to yeast  <cit> . to aid in this process we developed a rapid screening protocol to detect transformants containing transformed dna. colony-pcr is a powerful approach because it is less laborious and time-consuming than southern analysis. for this procedure to be efficient it is necessary to quickly obtain quality template dna for dna amplification. several methods for isolation of dna from conidia were examined with little success. fortunately, we were able to obtain high quality dna from a. flavus conidia using the ctab protocol, which is routinely used to obtain dna from plants. this is a simple dna extraction method for pcr-amplification that worked extremely well regardless of the age of the conidia.

the protocols for functional analysis described here make the study of the aflatoxin biosynthetic pathway more straightforward, and may possibly be extended to other filamentous fungi.

CONCLUSIONS
the available genome sequence and whole genome dna microarrys for aspergillus flavus make it a model system for understanding pathogenicity and mycotoxin production in a seed infecting fungus. to better understand the function of genes in this fungus it is necessary to have an efficient system for gene replacement and complementation. this study reports the use of the antibiotic phleomycin as a dominant selectable marker for transformation and overall improvements in both the transformation protocol and the selection of transformants of a. flavus. this transformation protocol provides an efficient and powerful system for functional analysis in this fungus. previous transformation systems for this fungus rely on auxotrophic markers that require a mutation within the recipient strain. using the phleomycin transformation protocol no prior mutation is needed. further, phleomycin can be used in conjunction with other markers to readily disrupt two genes in the same strain. this research will be of interest to those working on pathogenicity and the molecular biology of aflatoxin metabolism in a. flavus.
