BACKGROUND
bamboo is important not only to human industry, but also in the environment and for animal habitat. because bamboo has a long juvenile phase, an unpredictable flowering time and dies after flowering, it is difficult to investigate its reproductive biology. in large bamboo forests, bamboo flowering can cause economic and ecological damage. for example, in 1970– <dig>  a widespread flowering of the bamboos bashania fangiana and fargesia denudata in china threatened the food source of pandas in the affected area  <cit> . in 1963– <dig>  two-thirds of the phyllostachys bambusoides stands were flowering in japan, limiting the bamboo industry  <cit> . therefore, the mechanism timing bamboo flowering is of interest outside academic pursuits. to investigate this topic, a reliable source of reproductive materials is required. using tissue culture, bamboo can be induced to flower  <cit>  by addition of cytokinin  <cit> . additionally, vegetative shoots can be induced by auxin treatment  <cit> . using tissue culture, genomic resources have been established for the bamboo bambusa edulis, including microarray  <cit>  and expressed sequence tag  libraries  <cit> .

next generation sequencing  has been employed to supplement the microarray and est libraries for non-model plants  <cit> . this method was also applied to the bamboos dendrocalamus latiflorus <cit>  and p. heterocycla <cit> . the bambusa genus comprises more than one hundred species, which are widely distributed in the tropical and subtropical areas of asia, africa, and oceania. there are many important economic species, such as b. edulis and b. oldhamii, which are grown for human consumption, b. pervariabilis and b. tuldoides, which are grown for building and furniture supplies, b. textilis and b. rigida, which are grown for fiber, and b. ventricosa and b. multiplex var. riviereorum, which are grown for ornamental use. additionally, bambusa has been used for cross-breeding with other bamboo genera  <cit> . compared with the transcriptome resources of dendrocalamus and phyllostachys, the transcriptome data from bambusa is limited.

generally, flower morphology is diverse and unique, and therefore serves as an excellent material for taxonomic and evolutionary studies  <cit> . recent studies on floral development-related genes in dicot plants can be understood by the abcde model of flower initiation  <cit> . a and b class genes cooperate to form the petal. b and c class genes cooperate to form the stamen. a whorl that only expresses a c class gene develops into a carpel. d class genes are related to ovule identity. e class genes are expressed in all four whorls of floral organs and ovule and correlate to the floral meristem determinacy  <cit> . interestingly, all genes thus far identified in this model, except ap <dig>  which belongs to the apetala2/ ethylene-responsive element binding protein  family, are mads genes. mads genes encode transcription factors. based on amino acid sequences, these genes can be divided into two types: type i  and type ii . in plants, the mef-like mads-domain proteins contain four conserved domains: the mads  domain, the intervening  domain, the keratin-like  domain and a c-terminal domain. therefore, these type ii proteins are called mikc-type mads-box proteins. all mads genes in the abcde model of plant floral development are mikc-type mads.

the abcde model was developed through research in dicot plants. however, the monocots, specifically the family poaceae, contain important cereal crops, such as rice , maize , wheat , and barley   <cit> . together with bamboo, these species form the bambusoideae, ehrhartoideae  and pooideae  phylogenetic clade. similarities and differences in the genetic sequences and expression patterns of floral development genes in this clade are informative for both macroevolution  <cit>  and agricultural application. furthermore, since monocot flower development can directly affect the grain yield, the mechanism of flowering is an important topic in poaceae research. additionally, the morphology of monocot floral organs is different from that in the dicots. in rice and bamboo, the inflorescence is composed of spikelets. each spikelet contains one floret. the floret is divided into four whorls, namely: lemma and palea , two lodicules , six stamens , and gynoecium   <cit> . in rice, mads genes have been identified and divided into the abcde gene classes  <cit> . compared with rice , relatively fewer mads-box genes have been characterized in bamboo  <cit> . therefore, to systematically study mads-box genes involved in floral formation in bamboo, the b. edulis ngs transcriptome databases were developed and searched to identify putative flower development-related mads  genes.

RESULTS
rna-seq, de novo assembly and sequence analysis
three b. edulis transcriptome libraries  were constructed from rna derived from different developmental stages and various tissues in vitro . to comprehensively cover the b. edulis transcriptome, equal amounts of total rna from each sample were pooled together before the mrna was isolated, enriched, sheared into smaller fragments, and reverse-transcribed into cdna. we performed rna-seq analyses by either roche  <dig> or illumina sequencing platforms based on the two-phase assembly approach. the resulting sequencing data were subjected to bioinformatic analysis.

the size distribution of the b. edulis unigenes identified from the three transcriptome datasets is shown in figure 1a and table  <dig>  these set of unigenes were annotated using blastx searches of a variety of protein databases, taking into account the identity between the unigene sequence and the sequence in the database . the size distributions of the blast-aligned predicted proteins in the three b. edulis transcriptome datasets are shown in figure 1b.

transcriptome databases

a50% of the assembled bases were incorporated into contigs of 562 bp or longer.

b50% of the assembled bases were incorporated into unigenes of 361 bp or longer.

c50% of the assembled bases were incorporated into unigenes of 730 bp or longer.

currently, there are several ngs platforms, i.e. illumina/solexa genome analyzer, roche  <dig> gs flx and applied biosystems solid, used in genome and transcriptome research, each with advantages and weaknesses. in research using ngs, the accuracy and length of the sequences are important. for instance, while the read length obtained using the sanger method is longer, the method is more expensive. illumina technology has higher sequencing coverage, resulting in higher accuracy, but the read length is short, making it difficult to obtain long contigs during de novo assembly. therefore, integration of multiple sequencing platforms is one strategy for de novo sequencing when there is no reference genome available  <cit> . through a hybrid assembly, contigs averaging  <dig> nts were constructed, an average length longer than that reported for the d. latiflorus transcriptomes, which only used illumina methods  <cit> .

some pre-assembled sequences were lost during the integration of the illumina and  <dig> sequences. therefore, in this report, the transcriptomes derived from each sequencing platform are also presented. this allowed searches for dna sequences of interest in two de novo transcriptomes and one virtual hybrid transcriptome, with the results further assembled after hunting in the three databases.

functional annotation of b. edulis transcriptome
to predict the function of these assembled transcripts, non-redundant sequences were submitted to a blastx  search against the following databases: gene ontology , ncbi non-redundant database , swiss-prot, kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway  and orthologous groups of proteins  . nearly  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of all predicted unigenes significantly matched a sequence in at least one of the four databases used for annotation . in order to determine if a complete representation of the known genes within a gene family could be found in our datasets, the mads gene family was used for further transcriptome validation.

sixteen putative bemads genes identified from b. edulis transcriptome database
using <dig> floral-specific rice mads protein sequences,  <dig> bemads genes were identified . when using the data from only one sequencing platform, most of the sequences were partial and some could not be identified. for example, bemads <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were not found in the illumina database. bemads <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were not found in the  <dig> database. combining the sequences from the three databases resulted in identification of full-length transcripts for bemads <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . these results indicated that combination of different sequencing platforms resulted in longer sequence lengths and more complete transcriptome assembly. the same observation was made in the phalaenopsis transcriptome study  <cit> .

the high sequence homology in the mads gene family, especially the highly conserved m domain in the n-terminal region, can be a problem in distinguishing between paralogs during de novo assembly and promoter walking. to identify the promoter region and to clone full length genes, a bac strategy was used  <cit>  to identify  <dig> additional full length bemads genes in b. oldhamii .

in addition to a sequencing strategy, it is possible to search databases from other closely related species. according to chloroplast genome results, p. heterocycla, d. latiflorus and b. oldhamii are highly homologous species  <cit> . some bamboo gene sequences, including genomic, full-length cdna, and est, have been published  <cit> . from the ncbi database, p. heterocycla and d. latiflorus mads genes were identified. integration of the data from different bamboo species will prove important not only for gene identification, but also for evolutionary studies.

evolutionary relationships among bamboo and other monocot mads genes similar to genes in the abcde model of floral development
to identify the putative functional classification of the bamboo bemads in relation to the abcde model and to understand the phylogenetic relationships with other known mads-box genes regulating floral development, we collected full-length amino acid sequences of mads from bamboo , rice   <cit> , maize   <cit>  and wheat   <cit>  to perform phylogenetic analysis . our phylogenetic tree is organized with an overlay of the abcde model classes for ease of discussion, based on this  <cit> .

bemads <dig>  bemads <dig> and bemads <dig> belonged to the ap <dig> family in the a class , which includes the ful <dig>  ful <dig> and ful <dig> clades  <cit> . bemads <dig>  like osmads <dig>  belonged to the ful <dig> clade. bemads <dig> sorted into the ful <dig> clade, close to zap <dig> from maize and osmads <dig> from rice. bemads <dig>  like osmads <dig>  belonged to ful <dig> clade. these genes, identified as transcripts from b. edulis, clustered with genes that were hypothesized to occur twice in grass genomes due to duplication events  <cit> .

bemads <dig>  bemads <dig> and bemads <dig> were most orthologous to the b class proteins . bemads <dig> and bemads <dig> belong to the pi family, with bmads <dig> closely related to osmads <dig> and maize zmm <dig>  and bemads <dig> most closely related to osmads <dig> . bemads <dig> was most closely related to osmads <dig>  in the ap <dig> clade. the presence of one ap <dig> ortholog  and two pi orthologs  is similar to the other monocots and bolsters the hypothesis that early in the evolution of the monocots there was an ancient gene duplication event of the pi ortholog  <cit> .

four proteins, bemads <dig>  bemads <dig>  bemads <dig> and bemads <dig>  belong to the ag family , which functionally classifies as a c/d class mads protein. in the c class functional group, bemads <dig> and bemads <dig> were most closely related to rice osmads <dig> and osmads <dig>  respectively. bemads <dig> and bemads <dig> were most orthologous to the d class functional group and closely related to rice osmads <dig> and osmads <dig>  respectively . based on the phylogenetic tree analysis, the d class had four subclades in the grasses, and each subclade contained at least one gene from rice, maize or wheat. the ag family of proteins is divided between the c and d classes, the first of which contains the rice proteins osmads <dig> and osmads <dig> – which are like ag, shatterproof <dig> , and shatterproof <dig>  in arabidopsis - and the second of which contains osmads <dig> and osmads <dig> – which are like seedstik  in arabidopsis  <cit> . our data show that the bamboo bemads proteins in the c/d group also contain one gene in each subclade , which can be interpreted as a major gene duplication event that occurred in both grass c and d clades before the separation of the maize, rice, wheat and bamboo lineages  <cit> .

five proteins, bemads <dig>  bemads <dig>  bemads <dig>  bemads <dig>  and bemads <dig>  were most closely related to the sep family, which belongs to the e functional group . the class e genes in rice belong to two clades - the sep-clade  and the lofsep-clade   <cit> . the osmads1/leafy hull sterile  <dig> , osmads5/osm <dig>  and osmads34/panicle phytomer  <dig>  grouped into the lofsep-clade  <cit> . while this class can be divided into multiple layers of derived clades, the most informative may be the five distinct subclades, 1– <dig>  <cit> . this phylogenetic division indicates that the bamboo bemads genes in e-group are closely related to the osmadss in each clade and that at least one bemads falls into each subclade , similar to the homologous genes identified from rice, maize and wheat. according to these results, the common ancestor of these species may contain at least five sep-like genes.

there is one family of mikc-mads that does not have a defined role in the abcde model, the agl <dig> clade. recently, it was reported that osmads6/mosaic floral organs  <dig>  plays a synergistic role in regulating floral organ identity, floral meristem determinacy and meristem fate with class b , c , and d  genes and with the yabby gene drooping leaf , which was previously known to function in carpel specification  <cit> . these results suggest that rice agl6-clade gene may have an e-class function. our phylogenetic analysis indicates that bemads <dig> belongs to the agl <dig> family and is most similar to osmads <dig> . past phylogenetic analysis showed that agl6-like genes are sister to the sep-like genes  <cit> . interestingly, sep genes were only identified in angiosperms, but agl6-like genes were identified in both angiosperms and gymnosperms.

as a whole, this phylogenetic tree shows that bamboo contains mads proteins not only in each putative functional group but also in each sub-clade and that the bemads are most often sister to the rice osmads. therefore, functional experiments in bamboo can be designed based on previous work in monocots. recently, two ap1/squa-like mads-box genes from bamboo , ppmads <dig>  and ppmads <dig> , were found to play roles in floral transition, since they caused early flowering through upregulation of ap <dig> when overexpressed in arabidopsis. yeast two-hybrid experiments demonstrated that ppmads <dig> and ppmads <dig> might interact with different partners to play a part in floral transition of bamboo  <cit> .

bemads gene expression
the expression patterns of the  <dig> bemads were analyzed by real-time quantitative rt-pcr using gene-specific primer sets across several tissue types and floret ages . data are grouped by functional classes, a-e, on the right. most of the bemads genes were highly expressed in the floral organ . bemads <dig> was expressed in various tissues, but most highly expressed in stem . this result is different to the presumed ortholog in rice, osmads <dig>  which is ubiquitously expressed but highly expressed in spikelet and has been shown to be involved in inflorescence and spikelet development  <cit> .

the process of bamboo flower development can be divided into  <dig> stages, from small floral buds to mature flower . the expression level of the a-, b- and e-class bemads genes were high in the youngest floral buds  and decreased through floral maturity. the expression of c- and d-class bemads genes were reduced in stage  <dig>  slightly increased in stages  <dig> to  <dig>  and decreased in stage  <dig> . expression of bemads in class e showed two overall patterns, one that was high throughout floral development and one that was high just in stage  <dig> 

we further analyzed the expression patterns of the bemadss in bamboo floral organs. from the outer whorl to the inner whorl within the floral organ, we divided the flower into lemma , palea , lodicule , anther  and pistil . our results showed that for the a- class genes, bemads <dig> was expressed throughout, but higher in the lemma and pistil, bemads <dig> was expressed in the lemma and palea, and bemads <dig> was most highly expressed in the pistil . the bemads <dig> homolog osmads <dig> was only detected in inflorescence and developing caryopses by transcript analysis  <cit> . based on in situ hybridization analysis, osmads <dig> was expressed in the early spikelet meristem, the primordia of flower organs, and the reproductive organs, but did not express in the vegetative organs  <cit> . these data are consistent with that of bemads <dig>  which was only expressed in floral organ . the bemads <dig> homolog osmads <dig> was first detected in the spikelet meristem and then in vegetative organs only after emergence of spikelet organs, including lodicules, palea, lemma, and glumes  <cit> . bemads <dig> showed a similar expression pattern, but very low expression in the lodicules , same like the ortholog in wheat, taap1- <dig> <cit> . the expression pattern of bemads <dig> was different from the rice ortholog osmads <dig> and the wheat ortholog taap1- <dig>  osmads <dig> is expressed in roots, leaves, inflorescences, and developing kernels, but not in young seedlings. the osmads <dig> transcript was also detected in leaves following germination after four weeks and increased during the reproductive phase  <cit> . a similar gene expression pattern was also found for wheat taap1- <dig>  which is highly expressed in roots, stems, leaves, different developmental stages of spikes and different spikelet organs, including the glumes, lemma, and palea  <cit> . it is interesting that taap1- <dig> was also expressed at low levels in developing caryopses, lodicules, stamens and pistils  <cit> . however, our result showed that bemads <dig> was more highly expressed in the fourth whorl  than in other whorls in the floral organ. while bemads <dig> is classified into the a class by sequence similarity and phylogenetic analysis, its expression pattern differs somewhat from typical a-class genes from other grasses. perhaps bemads <dig> functions in pistil formation with other functional genes in the c or e class.

a single copy of an ap3/def-like gene but two copies of the pi/glo-like genes is a phenomenon common in other plant species, including arabidopsis, antirrhinum, rice, maize, and wheat, and also bamboo . b class genes are required to specify petal and stamen identity  <cit> . whether of pi/glo or ap3/def lineage, the mrna of b class genes  showed a similar expression pattern: mainly in flower, with low levels detected in lemma and palea, but high levels in lodicules and anthers . this may indicate redundant function as a safety measure to insure flower development. transcripts of the ap3/def-like osmads16/spw <dig> and maize silky <dig>  were detected mainly in the lodicules and stamen primordia during floral development, but not in developing carpels  <cit> . the expression patterns of bemads <dig> and wheat taap <dig> are similarly in mature female organs  <cit> , but the function of taap <dig> is unknown. the pi/glo-like bemads <dig> and bemads <dig> display similar expression patterns, but bemads <dig> was highly expressed in anthers and bemads <dig> was highly expressed in lodicules. however, bemads <dig> and bemads <dig> expression patterns were still similar to other members of the pi family in the floral organ  <cit> . rice in situ hybridization data showed that in the late stage of floral development osmads <dig> mrna was not detected in the glumes, lemma, palea, pistil primordia or developing pistils, but limited to and highly expressed in lodicules. expression in stamens occurred in later developmental stages once all the floral organs were differentiated  <cit> . to further explore the spatial and temporal expression pattern of bemads <dig> in early floral bud development of bamboo, we investigated the expression pattern of genes by in situ hybridization. bemads <dig> was highly expressed in the anthers of second flowers . this result correlated with the qrt-pcr data . we also found that bemads <dig> and bemads <dig> showed similar expression patterns to wheat orthologs tapi- <dig> and tapi- <dig>  including the initial expression in spike primordia and later expression in developing caryopses , lodicules, stamens, and pistils from fully emerged spikes  <cit> .

the c class genes are part of the ag-lineage and include bemads <dig> and bemads <dig>  which were mainly expressed in the floral bud and then later in anthers and pistils, with especially high levels in pistils . this result is consistent with the involvement of the c class genes in development of the third  and fourth  whorls  <cit> . a similar result was also found for the other c class genes osmads <dig>  osmads <dig>  taag- <dig>  and taag- <dig>  in rice, in situ hybridization results indicated that osmads <dig> and osmads <dig> were limited to stamens, carpels, and ovule primordia. only osmads <dig> was strongly expressed in the presumptive region from which the stamen, carpel, and ovule primordia subsequently differentiate, whereas osmads <dig> remained during differentiation and development  <cit> . wheat taag- <dig> and taag- <dig> transcripts gradually increased during spike development and were only detected in the stamens and pistils  <cit> . the spatial and temporal expression of bemads <dig> and bemads <dig> requires further analysis.

the d class genes also belong to the ag-lineage and include bemads <dig> and bemads <dig>  which were mainly expressed in flower and concentrated in pistils . this expression pattern of d class genes was consistent with the gene function in ovule identity determination and floral meristem determinacy  <cit> . the d class genes osmads <dig>  maize zag <dig> and arabidopsis stk have a similar expression pattern in floral organs  <cit> . the gene expression of rice osmads <dig> was very low in developing anthers, carpels, styles/stigmas, and ovule  <cit> . during the late stage of flower development, osmads <dig> was particularly evident in the inner cell layers of the ovary and in the ovule integuments, an expression region that overlapped with that of osmads <dig> <cit> . based on the qrt-pcr results, the expression amount was no different between bemads <dig> and  <dig>  the expression localization was also similar: highly expressed in pistil.

the e class genes, such as arabidopsis sepallata , function in specification of sepal, petal, stamen, carpel, and ovule  <cit>  and interact with genes from the other four abcd groups at the protein level to form higher order mads-box protein complexes that control the development of the fourth whorls within the flower  <cit> . the e class genes in the sep lineage in bamboo were bemads <dig>  bemads <dig>  bemads <dig>  bemads <dig> and bemads <dig>  bemads <dig> was located in the agl <dig> lineage. the six genes were expressed in various flower structures, but were most highly expressed in the lemma , lodicule , and pistil  for the  <dig> sep-like genes and in the palea and lodicule for the agl6-like bemads <dig> . the expression pattern of e class genes in rice differed from bemads in the same group, such as the bemads <dig> homolog osmads <dig>  osmads <dig> was not detected before glume primordia emergence, after which it was mainly present in the spikelet meristem, and then limited to the lemma and palea, with very low expression in the carpel  <cit> . bemads <dig> was expressed through the entire flower development, at all examined stages and tissues, but was highly expressed in the pistil, moderately expressed in lemma and anther, and very limited in anthers and lodicules . we also investigated the spatial and temporal expression pattern of bemads <dig> in early floral bud development of bamboo by in situ hybridization. our result showed that the transcripts of bemads <dig> could also be detected in the pistil , correlating with the expression pattern determined by qrt-pcr . the other e class genes in rice, osmads <dig> and osmads <dig>  were first detected in spikelet meristems, were not in lemma or palea primordia at a later stage, but were found in developing lodicules, stamens, and carpels during spikelet development  <cit> . our result also showed that bemads <dig> and bemads <dig> have similar expression patterns in floral organs, but low levels in the anthers . the expression of bemads <dig> was high in the fourth whorl   and differed to that of its rice ortholog osmads <dig>  which was initially expressed throughout the floral meristem and subsequently detected in palea, lemma, and the sporogenic tissue of the anthers in the mature flower  <cit> . a previous expression study showed a grass agl6-like gene to mainly express in the inflorescence  <cit> . the bemads <dig> homolog in rice, osmads <dig>  was first detected in the floral meristem and later in palea, lodicules, and pistil and at lower levels in stamens  <cit> . this similar expression pattern in floral organs was also shown for bemads <dig> .

in summary, we used transcriptomics to identify  <dig> bemads genes and used amino acid homology to cluster them according to their similarity to genes in the abcde model of floral development. gene expression analysis demonstrated, except for bemads <dig> and  <dig>  that most bemads have similar expression patterns during flower development as their better studied orthologous genes in rice.

subcellular localization of bemads proteins
the putative functions of all the bemads proteins are as transcription factors. the localization of these proteins was predicted to be nuclear. to investigate the subcellular localization of bemads family members, b. edulis leaves and lemmas were used for transient transformation of gfp-bemads fusions . except for some of the signal for bemads1-yfp, the fifteen bemads proteins, representing each of the  <dig> classes, were found throughout the cytoplasm when transiently expressed in leaves .

when lemma was used as bombardment material for subcellular localization, some of the bemads proteins were localized to the nucleus . interestingly, all of the signal for bemads <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were localized in the nucleus . in lemma, bemads <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  did not localize into the nucleus. these results indicated that bemads proteins were only translocated into the nucleus in the tissues  where the gene is normally expressed. since it is difficult to obtain the bamboo flowers from the field, in vitro bamboo flowers were used as target tissues.

because mads proteins form tetramers with other mads proteins when functioning in floral development  <cit> , we hypothesized that some bemads proteins do not translocate into the nucleus of lemmas without another mads protein to assist their import. these  <dig> bemads genes  were co-transformed into lemmas with other nucleus bemads proteins . our results indicated that only bemads <dig> could facilitate the translocation of these bemads proteins into the nucleus in lemma cells . except bemads <dig> , most of the mads proteins were translocated to the nucleus, either completely  or partially . bemads <dig> protein was still in the cytosol when co-transformed with bemads <dig> . the subcellular localization of mads proteins can be affected by plant growth regulators, growth conditions, like sugar starvation  <cit> , or other protein. for instance, the arabidopsis mads soc <dig> can interact with agl <dig> and then translocate into nucleus to activate leafy  expression  <cit> . according to our results, bemads <dig> plays an important role  in translocation of other cytosol bemads proteins into the nucleus, where they presumably can then function as transcription factors.

these data support previous studies using comprehensive matrix-based screens for petunia and arabidopsis mads-box transcription factor interactions, such as fret -flim  imaging and yeast two-, three- or four- hybrid analyses that revealed that mads-box proteins form multimeric complexes  <cit> . this is the first report on monocot mads subcellular localization using co-transformation with other proteins or testing different tissue for transient expression.

CONCLUSIONS
using two different sequencing platforms, a transcriptome database of b. edulis was established from plant material grown in tissue culture. the n <dig> and number of genes in the combined databases are higher than previous bamboo transcriptome results, which used only illumina methods. the cost of the combined strategy is less than whole genome sequencing. although the contigs do not contain full length cdna sequences, these cdna can be identified by using other public resources, such as moso bamboo whole genome sequences or b. oldhamii bac sequences. to show the usefulness of this strategy,  <dig> members of the floral development-related mads gene family were further investigated and cloned. gene expression and amino acid sequence phylogeny were analyzed and compared to results from other monocot plant species. since bamboo flowers are difficult to obtain as material for taxonomic and evolutionary studies, these protein sequences may be able to supplement morphological assessments of relatedness and serve as evidence for taxonomy both within bambusideae and within the wider bep monocot group.
