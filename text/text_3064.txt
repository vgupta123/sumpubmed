BACKGROUND

nasturtium officinale r. br. is an aquatic perennial herb that generally grows in around clear, cold water. it is primarily found in europe, north and south america, and asia, where it is commonly known as “watercress.” in some regions, n. officinale is considered an aquatic weed and is consumed as a fresh salad plant or soup garnish, or used in other recipes  <cit> . it is well documented that n. officinale is recognized as a valuable traditional medicinal plant, because of its numerous health-benefiting constituents, such as vitamins b, c, and e, pro-vitamin a, folic acid, carotenoids, glucosinolates, and many minerals, including ca, fe, i, and s  <cit> . in particular, watercress contains high amounts of gluconasturtiin , which is hydrolyzed by myrosinase to produce 2-phennethyl isothiocyanate  <cit> . this latter metabolite has been demonstrated to suppress carcinogen activation through the inhibition of phase i enzymes and induction of phase ii enzymes  <cit> . recent study has shown that watercress accessions from the university of south-ampton germplasm collection contain various gluconasturtiin contents and antioxidant  capacity  <cit> . in addition, n. officinale is now known to play a role in the prevention of several other diseases including diabetes, inflammatory diseases  <cit> , and lymphocyte dna damage  <cit> .

glucosinolates are sulfur-rich anionic secondary metabolites derived from glucose and amino acids. approximately  <dig> different glucosinolates are known to occur naturally in plants  <cit>  and are found almost exclusively within the order brassicales. these compounds play roles in defense against pests and have various biological activities related to human health . glucosinolates can be classified into three main groups, depending on the content of modified amino acids: aliphatic glucosinolates, derived from methionine, isoleucine, leucine, or valine; aromatic glucosinolates, derived from tyrosine or phenylalanine; and indole glucosinolates, derived from tryptophan  <cit> . biosynthesis occurs in three independent phases:  side chain elongation of precursor amino acids with an additional methylene group,  partial amino acid conversion to form the core structure, and  secondary modification of the amino acid side chain  <cit> . several glucosinolate biosynthetic genes are generally involved in these three independent phases of glucosinolate biosynthesis. elongation of methionine is initiated by methylthioalkylmalate synthase , bile acid transporter <dig> , and branched-chain aminotransferase  . core structure formation of glucosinolates is accomplished in five steps via oxidation by cytochrome p <dig> of cyp <dig> and cyp <dig>  followed by c-s lyase, s-glucosyltransferase, and sulfotransferase . finally, secondary modification is mediated by several genes, including gs-ox, gs-aop, gs-oh, bzo <dig>  and cyp81f <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, various transcription factors are implicated in the regulation of glucosinolate biosynthesis. high aliphatic glucosinolate <dig> /myb <dig>  hag2/myb <dig>  and hag3/myb <dig> are the main regulators of aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis  <cit> , whereas high indolic glucosinolate <dig> /myb <dig>  hig2/myb <dig>  and altered tryptophan regulation <dig> /myb <dig> regulate indolic glucosinolate biosynthesis. among these regulators, atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> play major roles in indolic glucosinolate biosynthesis and atmyb <dig> is presumed to play an accessory role in indolic glucosinolate biosynthesis  <cit> . iqd <dig>  a nuclear-localized calmodulin-binding protein, controls the biosynthesis of aliphatic and indolic glucosinolates  <cit> . atdof <dig>  induces the transcription of cyp83b <dig> and increases the levels of aliphatic and indolic glucosinolates  <cit> .

whole transcriptome sequencing technologies have been widely utilized as powerful tools for high-throughput genotyping because they are inexpensive, rapid, accurate, and reproducible  <cit> . among next-generation sequencing  technologies, the illumina sequencing platform  <cit>  has been successfully used for de novo transcriptome sequencing of numerous species, such as rice   <cit> , maize   <cit> , soybean   <cit> , sweet potato   <cit> , barley   <cit> , chickpea   <cit> , tea plant   <cit> , and chinese bayberry   <cit> .

in this study, we used an illumina nextseq <dig> sequencer to analyze the transcriptome of n. officinale seedlings and generated  <dig> , <dig> raw reads that were assembled into  <dig>  transcripts. the n. officinale transcriptome showed highest species similarity and annotation ratio to arabidopsis thaliana. from the transcriptome data, we identified several candidate genes that encode enzymes related to glucosinolate biosynthetic pathways. to validate the spatial distribution of glucosinolate-related genes, we analyzed the expression of glucosinolate biosynthesis genes and transcription factors in different organs of n. officinale using quantitative real-time rt-pcr. metabolite profiling using hplc-uv analysis identified eight different glucosinolates in the different organs of n. officinale, and the total glucosinolate contents were found to be highest in flowers. among the eight identified glucosinolates, the level of gluconasturtiin was considerably higher than that of any other glucosinolate, irrespective of the organ. taken together, the data obtained from this comprehensive transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling will provide an invaluable resource for a better understanding of glucosinolate biosynthetic pathways, as well as strategies for exploiting the anti-carcinogenic properties in n. officinal.


methods
plant material and growth conditions

nasturtium officinale seeds were purchased from asia seeds co., ltd  and grown under field conditions at the experimental greenhouse of chungnam national university . different organs were harvested from mature plants at approximately 2 months after sowing. the samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at -80 °c for rna isolation or freeze-dried for subsequent analysis by high performance liquid chromatography .

illumina sequencing of the transcriptome
total rna was isolated from frozen seedlings of n. officinale using the rneasy mini kit  and cleaned by ethanol precipitation. we removed rrnas in total rna using the ribo-zero rrna removal kit  and constructed a cdna library for rna sequencing using the truseq stranded total rna sample prep kit-lt set a and b  according to the manufacturer’s protocols . the cdna library was sequenced in 76 bp length paired-end  reads in an illumina nextseq <dig> sequencer  to produce  <dig> , <dig> raw sequencing reads.

de novo assembly and annotation of the watercress transcriptome
the quality-trimmed reads of watercress rnas were assembled as contigs of the watercress transcriptome using the trinity software package   <cit> . the trinity program combines the overlapping reads of a given length and quality into longer contig sequences without gaps. the characteristic properties, including n <dig> length, average length, maximum length, and minimum length of the assembled contigs were calculated using transrate software   <cit> . we clustered the watercress transcriptome contigs based on sequence similarity using cd-hit-est software   <cit> . to infer the biological functions of watercress transcripts, we performed a homology search of the transcripts in the various public protein and nucleotide databases. a blastx search was performed using the national center for biotechnology information   nr and clusters of orthologous group   protein databases, brad  brassica rapa protein database, tair  arabidopsis thaliana protein database, and the ebi swiss-prot  database. a blastn search was performed using the ncbi nucleotide database. the best scored hit from the blastx and blastn results passed the cutoff of e-value < 10− <dig> and was selected for annotation of query transcripts for each database search. transcript lists and sequences are presented in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  the functional category distributions of watercress transcripts in terms of gene ontology  and cog were evaluated using the results of the homology search. cog functional category information attached to the hit cog proteins was used for determining cog functional category distribution, and go information attached to the hit uniprot proteins was collected and re-analyzed using the wego tool   <cit>  in terms of the level for the three go categories.

differentially expressed gene analysis
to quantify watercress transcript expressions, we aligned preprocessed quality-trimmed reads on the watercress transcript sequences and calculated the expression values with the aligned read counts for each transcript. bowtie <dig>  software  <cit>  was used to align the quality-trimmed reads on the transcript sequences, and express  software  <cit>  was used to evaluate gene expression, in terms of fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped fragments , from the aligned results. the fpkm method provides a comparison between genes within a sample or between samples by normalizing the amount of sequencing for samples and gene length bias during gene expression evaluation.

identification of candidate genes related to glucosinolate biosynthetic pathways
we searched for candidate genes involved in glucosinolate biosynthetic pathways using functional annotation data based on the orthologous gene names. in addition, the glucosinolate biosynthetic genes of arabidopsis obtained from tair were used as queries to search for homologous sequences in the watercress transcriptome database. following this, each sequence was confirmed by the blast program in the ncbi genbank database.

quantitative real-time rt-pcr
for quantitative real-time rt-pcr, gene-specific primer sets were designed for each gene using the primer <dig> website . real-time rt-pcr was performed in a cfx <dig> real time system  using 2x real-time pcr smart mix  under the following conditions: 95 °c for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °c for 15 s, annealing for 15 s at 56 °c, and elongation for 20 s at 72 °c. pcr products were analyzed using bio-rad cfx manager  <dig>  software. gene expression was normalized to that of the ubc <dig> gene, used as a housekeeping gene. the results of the real-time rt-pcr assay were calculated as the mean of three different biological experiments using seeds and different plant organs  of individual plants. real-time rt-pcr product sizes and primer sequences are shown in additional file 3: table s <dig> 

extraction and hplc analysis of glucosinolates
hplc-uv analysis of glucosinolates was performed according to previously described methods with some modification  <cit> . glucosinolates were extracted with 70%  methanol from 100 mg lyophilized powder in a water bath at 70 °c for 5 min. after centrifugation at  <dig>  × g for 10 min, the supernatant was loaded onto a mini-column packed with deae-sephadex a- <dig> . after an overnight reaction at ambient temperature, the desulfo-glucosinolates were eluted with  <dig>  ml of high-purity water and filtered through a  <dig>  μm hydrophilic ptfe syringe filter  in a vial. desulfo-glucosinolates were quantified using a  <dig> series hplc system  equipped with an inertsil ods- <dig>  column 150 ×  <dig>  mm i.d., particle size 3 μm . hplc analysis was performed with a flow rate of  <dig>  ml min− <dig> at a column temperature of 40 °c and a wavelength of 227 nm. the solvent systems employed were  water and  100% acetonitrile. the gradient program used was as follows: 0 min, 0% solvent b; 0–2 min, 0% solvent b; 2–7 min, 10% solvent b; 7–16 min, 31% solvent b; 16–19 min, 31% solvent b; 19–21 min, 0% solvent b; 21–27 min, 0% solvent b . the individual glucosinolates were determined by their hplc peak area ratios and response factors  with reference to a desulfo-sinigrin external standard.

RESULTS
sequencing and de novo assembly of the n. officinale transcriptome
as shown in fig.  <dig>  watercress can grow to a height of  <dig> to 120 cm and has slender hollow stems and small round leaves . tiny white flowers are formed in clusters and become small pods containing two rows of seeds . to provide an overview of the n. officinale transcriptome, we performed rna-sequencing analysis of n. officinale seedlings using the illumina nextseq <dig> platform . after removal of adaptor sequences,  <dig> , <dig> reads comprising a total of  <dig> , <dig>  nucleotides were obtained for assembly . these reads were assembled using the trinity program, resulting in  <dig>  contigs with an average length of 724 nt and an n <dig> of 994 nt. after clustering with cd-hit-est, the contigs were assembled into  <dig>  transcripts with a mean size of 681 nt and n <dig> of 930 nt. the size distribution of the transcripts exhibited the following pattern:  <dig> %  of the transcripts were less than 300 nt,  <dig> %  of the transcripts ranged from  <dig> to 1000 nt in length,  <dig> %  of the transcripts ranged from  <dig> to 3000 nt, and  <dig> %  were more than 3000 nt in length .fig.  <dig> photographs of mature plant , inflorescence , and seedling  of n. officinale







functional annotation and classification of n. officinale transcripts
for functional annotation, the transcripts were identified based on the blastx algorithm  against the non-redundant  protein database and nucleotide  database with an e-value cutoff of  <dig> x 10− <dig> . of the total  <dig>  transcripts,  <dig>  transcripts  had blast hits to known proteins in the nr database and  <dig>  transcripts  had blast hits to nucleotides in the nt database. in addition, some transcripts were aligned to public databases, including  <dig>   transcripts in the swiss-prot protein database,  <dig>   transcripts in the brassica database ,  <dig>   transcripts in the arabidopsis information resource  database,  <dig>   transcripts in the clusters of orthologous group  database, and  <dig>   transcripts in gene ontology  database. in total,  <dig>  transcripts were identified, representing approximately  <dig> % of all assembled transcripts.table  <dig> summary of annotations of the n. officinale transcripts

the expression of glucosinolate-related transcription factors was analyzed in the leaves, stems, roots, flowers, and seeds of n. officinale by quantitative rt-pcr . the expression of nomyb <dig> and nomyb <dig> was highest in the stems, which is consistent with the transcript levels of brmyb <dig>  brmyb29- <dig>  and brmyb29- <dig> in the stems of b. rapa  <cit> . nomyb <dig>  nomyb <dig>  nomyb <dig>  and nodof <dig>  were more strongly expressed in the roots compared with other organs. finally, the highest expression of noiqd1- <dig>  which is involved in both aliphatic and indolic glucosinolate biosynthesis, was observed in leaves. most glucosinolate biosynthetic genes were more highly expressed in the flowers compared with the leaves, stems, roots, and seeds. however, nomam <dig>  nomam <dig>  nocyp83a <dig>  nogstu <dig>  nost5c, and nofmo gs-ox <dig>  which are involved in aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis, had the highest expression levels in stems, roots, leaves, seeds, roots, and leaves, respectively . in addition, among the indolic glucosinolate biosynthetic genes, the highest expression levels of nocyp79b <dig>  nogstf <dig>  nocyp81f <dig>  and nopen <dig> were observed in roots .fig.  <dig> expression of glucosinolate transcription factors in different organs of n. officinale. the expression level was measured in 2-month-old n. officinale. relative expression level was plotted after normalization to ubc <dig>  mean values and sds from triplicate biological experiments are plotted

analysis of glucosinolate content in different organs of n. officinale
in hplc analysis, we identified eight different glucosinolates in the different organs of n. officinale; glucoiberin, glucotropaeolin, 4-hydroxyglucobrassicin, glucosiberin, glucohirsutin, glucobrassicin, 4-methoxyglucobrassicin, and gluconasturtiin . the levels of these glucosinolates distributed over the different organs of n. officinale . the amount of total glucosinolates was highest in the flower,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  times higher than that in the root, stem, leaf, and seed, respectively. among the eight glucosinolates, the level of gluconasturtiin was considerably higher than any other glucosinolate, irrespective of the organ. in particular, the gluconasturtiin content in the flower and seed was considerably higher than that in other organs. the content of gluconasturtiin in the flower was  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  times higher than that in the root, stem, leaf, and seed, respectively. the content of glucotropaeolin was also highest in the flower, with concentrations  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  times higher than that in the stem, leaf, and root, respectively. the second highest level of total glucosinolates was observed in the seed. the seed contains higher amounts of glucoiberin, glucosiberin, and glucohirsutin than the other organs of n. officinale. the level of glucoiberin was  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  times higher in the seed than in the root, leaf, stem, and flower, respectively. the content of glucosiberin was highest in the seed, with levels  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  times higher than those in the stem, root, leaf, and flower, respectively. the amount of glucohirsutin was highest in the seed, being  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  times higher than that in the stem, leaf, root, and flower, respectively. although the total glucosinolate content was lowest in the root, the amount of 4-hydroxyglucobrassicin was highest in the root, with levels  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  times higher than that in the seed, stem, leaf, and flower, respectively. the root also contained the highest amount of glucobrassicin.table  <dig> glucosinolates identified by lc-esi/ms in n. officinale

discussion
despite the health-benefiting importance and economical value of watercress, there is still limited genomic and physiological information available for n. officinale. in this study, we performed comparative analyses of the phytonutritional property of n. officinale, using both transcriptomic and metabolomics approaches. in our transcriptome analysis of n. officinale seedlings, we revealed total  <dig>  transcripts and annotated  <dig>   of total transcripts of n. officinale using public databases. on the basis of the annotations and sequence identities of n. officinale, we identified  <dig> candidate genes encoding enzymes related to glucosinolate biosynthetic pathways and analyzed the expression of these genes in the leaves, stems, roots, flowers, and seeds of n. officinale. furthermore, we also profiled glucosinolate metabolic data via hplc-uv analysis and identified eight glucosinolates in different organs of n. officinale. among these eight glucosinolates, the level of gluconasturtiin was considerably higher than any other glucosinolate in individual organs. these transcriptomic and metabolomics results are highly consistent with those obtained in a recently published study by voutsina et al.  <cit> . these authors performed rna-sequencing analysis of  <dig> watercress accessions to investigate the genetic basis of two key watercress nutritional attributes: antioxidant  capacity and glucosinolate  content. the transcriptome analysis of n. officinale yielded  <dig>  transcripts , of which  <dig>   transcripts were annotated using a blastx search against arabidopsis. differentially expressed gene  analysis comparing watercress accessions with “high” and “low” ao and gls revealed  <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed loci for ao capacity and gls, respectively. deg analysis between the high and low gls watercress identified links to gls regulation and novel transcripts warranting further investigation. in the deg analysis, they identified two differentially expressed shikimate pathway genes, c33663_g1_i2; similar to shikimate kinases and c37926_g1_i6; dehydroquinateshikimate dehydrogenase, acting upstream of the glucosinolate pathway. our transcriptome data for n. officinale also revealed seven putative genes encoding glucosinolate transcription factors and  <dig> putative glucosinolate biosynthetic genes . the seven putative genes encoding glucosinolate transcription factors, nomyb <dig>  nomyb <dig>  nomyb <dig>  nomyb <dig>  nomyb <dig>  nodof <dig> , and noiqd <dig> , are thought to act in glucosinolate biosynthesis regulation . intensive research on the relationship between shikimate pathway genes and glucosinolate biosynthetic genes in watercress will enhance our understanding of functional genomic approach, including glucosinolate biosynthetic pathways.

many indole glucosinolate biosynthetic genes are specifically expressed at highest levels in the roots and flowers. in n. officinale, the accumulation patterns of indole glucosinolates, such as 4-hydroxyglucobrassicin and glucobrassicin, coincide with the expression patterns of the genes related to these indole glucosinolates. in contrast, the accumulation patterns of aliphatic glucosinolates did not coincide with the expression pattern of aliphatic glucosinolate-related genes in n. officinale. most of the aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthetic genes were more highly expressed in the flowers compared with the leaves, stems, roots, and seeds, whereas the contents of aliphatic glucosinolates, such as glucoiberin, glucosiberin, and glucohirsutin, were relatively higher in the seed. several genes involved in the regulation of glucosinolate biosynthetic pathways and external stimulations could be linked to accumulate the glucosinolate contents  <cit> . although there are many reasons for this discordance, the shift in developmental stage from flower to seed might possibly explain the discrepancy between gene expression pattern and metabolite content.

CONCLUSIONS
in rna sequencing analysis using an illumina nextseq <dig> sequencer, we identified a total  <dig>  transcripts and annotated  <dig>  transcripts, which provide basic information for further research on the secondary metabolites in n. officinale. our transcriptome data reveal that several genes encoding enzymes related to glucosinolate biosynthetic pathways are well conserved in n. officinale and that these genes have high similarity to those in other cruciferous plants such as arabidopsis thaliana, brassica rapa, and camelina sativa.

on the basis of our gene expression study and hplc analysis, we identified that most glucosinolate biosynthetic genes are highly expressed in flowers and that the content of total glucosinolates was also higher in flowers than in other organs, indicating a positive correlation between the expression of glucosinolate-related genes and glucosinolate contents in different organs of n. officinale. the results of this research provide comprehensive information on the n. officinale genome and enhance our understanding of the glucosinolate biosynthesis pathways in this plant.
