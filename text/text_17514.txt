BACKGROUND
pharmacokinetics is a field of study that analyzes and predicts behaviors of drugs in organisms  <cit> . a major purpose of this study area is to predict pharmacokinetic properties of new drugs in humans, without performing clinical studies, in order to accelerate the efficiencies of new drug development processes. another important purpose is to facilitate the proper use of not only newly developed drugs but also already existing drugs. there are numerous factors altering pharmacokinetics, such as drug-drug interactions   <cit> , pharmacogenetics  <cit> , or disease states  <cit> , which can cause large inter-individual variability in drug responses. by studying these complicated phenomena, we may be able to explain and predict the alterations in clinical settings to administer drugs properly to each patient  <cit> .

physiologically-based pharmacokinetic  modeling and simulation are essential in understanding and predicting the above-mentioned, complicated pharmacokinetic phenomena  <cit> . the basic idea of pbpk modeling is to reproduce physiological functions  in mathematical equations in order to understand the physiological phenomena extensively from the information obtained from in vivo studies and to predict unknown phenomena quantitatively. pbpk models are becoming more important because of the increase in complicated pharmacokinetic phenomena, such as ddis involving multiple interaction sites  <cit>  or the combined effect of multiple inhibitors  <cit> . current draft guidance on ddi studies by the u.s. food and drug administration  <cit>  emphasizes the importance of pbpk simulation in deciding whether clinical ddi studies are required or not during new drug developments.

in analyzing complex pharmacokinetic phenomena with pbpk models, gauss-newton or its modified algorithm is often used for parameter estimation. however, these methods require feasible initial parameters beforehand, which are often difficult for the pathways with little or no prior information, such as pharmacokinetic parameters of metabolites, or of enterohepatic circulations . optimized parameters may highly depend on the initial parameter settings as well. additionally, the pbpk model contains a lot of parameters to estimate in nature, compared to the limited information available in clinical studies, making the accurate estimation of parameters more difficult. since the accuracy of the parameter estimation process is quite important in pbpk analyses, these characteristics make the interpretations or extrapolations of the obtained results complicated.

aoki et al. recently developed a new parameter estimation algorithm called cnm  <cit> . in this algorithm, we first prepare a group of virtual samples with random samplings from a certain initial range for each parameter to estimate. then, linear approximations of a projection from parameter space into target values give the initial parameter values for the next iteration. in our experience, fewer than nine iterations of this process achieve the final, optimized parameters, which can reproduce clinically observed phenomena.

this algorithm has multiple advantages over conventional parameter estimating algorithms. the first advantage is the simplicity of the initial parameter settings. the new method only requires the designation of relatively broad parameter ranges as an initial setting, while the conventional algorithm requires the identification of feasible initial parameters. the second advantage is low computational costs owing to the deterministic nature of this algorithm, unlike other algorithms that use collective intelligence, such as genetic algorithms or particle swarm optimization. the last and the most important advantage is that the results are obtained as a group of optimized parameter sets. it allows us to interpret the phenomena with higher confidence and to extrapolate the obtained insights into new phenomena.

aoki et al. previously applied cnm for analyzing a complicated pharmacokinetic phenomenon  <cit>  using a pbpk model  <cit> , in which the pharmacokinetic properties of an anti-cancer drug, irinotecan , differs a lot between a bile-duct cancer  patient and other cancer  patients  <cit> . after intravenous administration, irinotecan is metabolized by cyp3a <dig> or carboxylesterase  <dig>  to form apc, npc, sn- <dig>  and m <dig>  <cit>  . npc and sn- <dig> are further metabolized by ces <dig> and ugt1a to form sn- <dig> and sn-38g, respectively. organic anion transporting polypeptide 1b <dig>  is involved in the hepatic uptake of sn- <dig>  while oatp1b <dig> does not actively transport irinotecan or sn-38g, according to an in vitro study  <cit> . sn-38g is said to be deconjugated to form sn- <dig> by Î²-glucuronidase in intestinal microflora  <cit> . possible involvement of enterohepatic circulation  in determining irinotecan pharmacokinetics  <cit>  makes the estimation of parameters difficult because of the model structure and limited information about the feasible parameter values of ehc.

since the previous report is mainly focused on the establishment of cnm, the pbpk model was not suitable from the pharmacokinetic viewpoint. most importantly, the previous pbpk model did not contain ehc. biliary drainage in the bdc group was not considered either. furthermore, our preliminary investigation showed that the original cnm is not applicable to analyze the phenomena with ehc in a pbpk model.

in this paper, we improved both the pbpk model of irinotecan and the cnm algorithm itself. firstly, we included ehc and biliary drainage in the pbpk model to properly interpret our obtained results. we also tried to improve the cnm algorithm itself to maintain the diversity of virtual samples during iterations, since the application of the original cnm algorithm failed using the new pbpk model in this study.

RESULTS
improvements in cnm for analyzing irinotecan accumulation profiles
in this study, we have applied and improved the cnm algorithm for the accumulation profiles of irinotecan and its metabolites by using the pbpk model shown in figure  <dig> and in additional file  <dig>  parameter estimation in the pbpk model was performed with  <dig> and  <dig> objective values for oc and bdc, respectively . initial ranges of parameters were set as shown in table 1b, which were thought to be large enough to contain the real value for each parameter.

a fixed parameters for calculation, b initial parameters to estimate, and c objective values are shown. minimum and maximum values of the initial ranges were represented for the parameters to estimate. we used the same initial ranges for each of the five parameters for irinotecan and the metabolites, except for #16- <dig> and # <dig>  we used the same parameter value of # <dig> for irinotecan and the metabolites. parameter # <dig> was fixed and set to be zero and fixed when analyzing the oc group. the total amount of urinary, fecal, and biliary accumulation was normalized to the amount of dose . bdc, bile-duct cancer patients; cl <dig>  clearance from a rapid to a late equilibrium compartments; clces, <dig>  metabolic clearance of irinotecan by ces <dig> to form sn-38; clces, <dig>  metabolic clearance of npc by ces <dig> to form sn-38; clbile,total, sum of biliary clearance to a transit compartment and biliary clearance to biliary t-tube; cl3a <dig> , metabolic clearance of irinotecan by cyp3a <dig> to form apc; cl3a <dig> , metabolic clearance of irinotecan by cyp3a <dig> to form npc; clr, renal clearance; clugt, metabolic clearance of sn- <dig> by ugt to form sn-38g; k <dig>  kinetic constant from a late to a rapid equilibrium compartment; ka, absorption rate constant; kfeces, kinetic constant for the transit from large intestine to feces; kli, kinetic constants for the transit from small intestine to large intestine; kp,h, concentration ratio between liver and rapid equilibrium compartment; ktransit, kinetic constant for the transit in bile compartments to small intestine; oc, other cancer patients; qh, blood flow rate in liver; vh, volume of a liver; vrapid, apparent volume of a rapid equilibrium compartment.

firstly, we performed the modified cnm with various ds values, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> . the modified cnm replicates a group of parameters towards the direction of the estimated feasible solution space with the ratio of ds after each iteration . we examined the effect of ds values on the convergence in this system, which was newly introduced in the algorithm to maintain parameter diversities as explained in the methods section, and the calculation with ds of  <dig> is identical to the original cnm algorithm. by changing the ds values from  <dig> to  <dig> , we performed cnm on the accumulation profiles in the bdc group with the same initial parameter ranges. as shown in figure  <dig>  the objective values converged well to the observed values when ds was no less than  <dig>  . for the oc group, ds of at least  <dig>  was needed to complete the process .

when ds was smaller than  <dig> , the ranges of the objective values remained similar to the initial range . particularly, parameters got diverged after  <dig> iterations for ds of  <dig> to  <dig> , or after  <dig> iterations for ds of  <dig>  . the divergences of parameters after  <dig> iterations were smaller with higher ds values. it might be due to the capability to maintain parameter diversities with higher ds values. since we have some parameters sensitive to the changes in ds values, such as a biliary clearance to a transit compartment of sn- <dig> , we might be able to control the convergence by observing the behaviors of sensitive parameters. these results suggest the importance of maintaining parameter diversities in performing cnm using the ds algorithm, while further investigations should be needed to rationally determine feasible ds values in other cases.

some pharmacokinetic parameters gradually converged to a feasible solution space along with the iterations of the parameter estimation process with high ds values. the residuals in objective values were decreased towards zero as well. figure  <dig> illustrates the estimated parameters and the objective values after iterations with ds of  <dig> , and the corresponding values are described in additional file  <dig>  while the ranges of parameter values seem stable only after the first iteration, the residuals in objective values continued to decrease until the third iterations. this observation may suggest that correlations among parameter values converged while maintaining the diversity of the absolute value in each parameter.

after  <dig> iterations, we observed high convergence of certain parameters, such as renal clearance  of irinotecan  in both the oc and the bdc groups, and ratio of biliary clearance into t-tube to biliary clearance into a transit compartment  in the bdc group . in particular, the estimated values of irinotecan clr in oc  was close to the values calculated from the original report . furthermore, the averages of estimated irinotecan clr values with two different initial distributions were within three fold of the values from the original report . we do not have clear explanations of the convergences in clearance parameters without information on plasma concentrations, since these parameters are defined as the ratio between urinary, biliary, or fecal accumulations of drugs with area under the blood concentration-time curve . we suspect that these parameters were determinants of the behavior of our pbpk model structures, and that the relationships with other parameters restricted the absolute values.

the calculation time required for the whole process was short; it took less than  <dig> minutes with ten iterations and  <dig> virtual samples .

after the application of cnm, we simulated the accumulation time-profiles using estimated parameter sets to compare them with the reported values . in both groups, some parameter sets reproduced the observed time profiles well, and the range of the estimated parameters became smaller when we selected samples which reproduced the observed time profile well .

differences in optimized parameters between oc and bdc
we compared the estimated parameter distributions between oc and bdc. when comparing the distribution of parameters with all samples, parameter distributions were similar in the two groups . as mentioned in the previous section, we observed strong convergence in parameter # <dig>  clr of irinotecan. expansions of parameter ranges were also similar between the two groups. on the other hand, the distributions of the numbers of parameters were shifted when we considered accumulation time-profiles . interestingly, these parameters are mostly involved in hepatobiliary or intestinal pathways . these results may suggest the importance of hepatobiliary and intestinal pharmacokinetic processes in determining the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan in the bdc patient, and are partly in a good agreement with the reports on reduced mrp <dig> expressions in liver with biliary cancer  <cit>  or in the duodenums of patients with hepatic cholestasis  <cit> , and altered pharmacokinetics of irinotecan and its metabolites with genetic polymorphisms of mrp <dig>  <cit> . however, further investigations are needed to clarify the cause of the pharmacokinetic alterations, since most of the parameter ranges in bdc group are actually included in the parameter ranges in oc group.

correlations among parameters
finally, we have observed correlations among the estimated parameter values . we selected parameters with an r <dig> value of more than  <dig>  against at least one other parameter in this figure. tendencies in parameter correlations were similar between the two groups, while the number of parameter combinations having higher correlations was large in bdc group. the number of objective values might again be the cause of this observation.

most of these relationships can be explained theoretically. for example, in both groups, parameters among # <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> have a strong linear relationship with each other to keep the ratio of parameters to maintain the ratio in the final outcome. another example is the inverse proportional relationship of # <dig> to # <dig> and # <dig>  when the amount of bile collected in the t-tube was increased , biliary clearances decreased  to keep the amount of compounds excreted into the t-tubes. while these phenomena can be explained retrospectively, we cannot easily observe the actual parameter dependencies quantitatively without performing this kind of parameter estimation algorithms.

CONCLUSIONS
efficient and reliable estimations of parameter values are important for the analysis of complex pharmacokinetic phenomena with pbpk models. in this study, we have successfully improved and applied cnm to estimate  <dig> or  <dig> parameters in the irinotecan pbpk model, by implementing ds function in the algorithm. the application of this method presented not only the control parameters in this pbpk model, but also correlations of parameters, which are important in determining the behaviors of the pbpk model.
