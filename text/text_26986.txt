BACKGROUND
voltage-gated ion channels are often highly localized in electrically excitable cells such as nerve and muscle. as originally noted by trimmer and colleagues  <cit> , the kv <dig>  delayed rectifier is expressed primarily in the somatic region of hippocampal neurons where it is found in cell surface clusters that can co-localize with ryanodine receptors and sr-like subsurface cisterns  <cit> . interestingly, these clusters also co-localize with cholinergic synapses in spinal motor neurons  <cit> . kv <dig>  represents the predominant delayed rectifier current in hippocampal neurons where its activity and localization are highly regulated  <cit> . glutamate or carbachol treatments induce both kv <dig>  dephosphorylation and declustering  <cit> . both treatments also result in a  <dig> mv hyperpolarizing shift in the activation curve for ik. chemically-induced ischemia also induces declustering, dephosphorylation, and the hyperpolarizing shift in the activation midpoint  <cit> . similar regulation is observed in kv <dig>  transfected hek cells  <cit> . these data suggest a strong link between cluster formation, channel phosphorylation, and the voltage-dependence of activation. the increase in channel activity that is linked to declustering has been proposed to be a neuro-protective response to hypoxia/ischemic insult  <cit> . however, kv <dig>  trafficking to the cell surface is also implicated in cortical neuron apoptosis  <cit> , emphasizing that the trafficking and regulation of kv <dig>  must be under tight physiological control.

while it is commonly assumed that ion channel localization must involve static tethering to scaffolding proteins that in turn are linked directly to the cytoskeleton, our recent studies indicate that the kv <dig>  surface clusters are formed when mobile kv <dig>  channels are corralled behind a cortical actin-based fence  <cit> . this sub-membrane fence is selective towards only the confined channels, with other membrane proteins being free to cross it. thus, the kv <dig> -containing surface clusters represent a new mechanism for the stable localization of ion channel proteins to specific cell surface domains. our previous studies also indicate that the surface clusters are specialized surface sites for the membrane insertion of kv <dig>  channels, functioning as intracellular trafficking vesicle targets  <cit> . during the course of our studies we often observed gfp-kv <dig>  clusters forming in a single proximal neurite of a transfected hippocampal neuron. while the expression of kv <dig>  within the axon initial segment  of cultured hippocampal neurons has previously been referred to as a tissue culture artifact  <cit> , ais localization was often the only cell surface expression observed in an individual cell. the study presented here was initiated by this apparent contradiction between the literature and our data obtained in hippocampal neurons transfected with gfp-kv <dig> .

we report here that both transfected and endogenous kv <dig>  often show a real preference for the ais in cultured hippocampal neurons. the kv <dig>  clusters within the ais are similar to those found on the cell body in that they consist of mobile channels trapped by a perimeter fence. however, perhaps due to the sub-membrane diffusion barriers in the ais  <cit> , the clusters themselves appear to be more confined than their cell body counterparts  <cit> . kv <dig>  concentration within the ais also occurs in both cortical and hippocampal neurons of adult brain, confirming that ais localization is not a tissue culture artifact. ais-localized kv <dig>  is predicted to regulate both the frequency and back propagation of the axonal action potential.

RESULTS
exogenously expressed kv <dig>  targets to the axon initial segment in cultured hippocampal neurons before accumulating on the soma
our initial imaging experiments involved expressing gfp and ha epitope-tagged kv <dig>   in rat hippocampal neurons grown in culture for 7– <dig> days. the extracellular ha epitope allowed detection of surface channel via the binding of an anti-ha alexa-594-conjugated antibody to living cells as previously described  <cit> . in contrast to the expected soma and proximal neurite expression  <cit> , 85% of neurons expressing egfp-kv <dig> -ha exhibited surface accumulation at only one of the proximal neurites at  <dig> h post transfection . this targeting of kv <dig>  to a single proximal neurite was observed with little or no clustering on the cell body. in neurons expressing kv <dig>  for  <dig> h, surface clusters within the soma  became more apparent relative to that observed at  <dig> h postransfection . by  <dig> h after transfection, the classic distribution of kv <dig>  into compact surface clusters was observed on the cell body along with expression in proximal neurites. however, kv <dig>  surface density remained the greatest in a single proximal neurite . note that the majority of the cell body gfp fluorescence at the  <dig> h and  <dig> h time points most likely represents er-localized channel. these representative data, showing that expressed kv <dig>  is targeted to a single proximal neurite prior to clustering at other surface somato-dendritic sites, suggest that kv <dig>  may have a preference for the axon initial segment  and may be targeted to this region via a mechanism distinct from the one responsible for delivery to somatic sites.

a defining characteristic of the ais in hippocampal neurons is the enrichment of ankyring  in the first 20– <dig> μm of the unmyelinated axon  <cit> . in addition, map <dig> immuno-reactivity is greatly reduced within the axon but is maintained within dendrites and the cell body  <cit> . thus, map <dig> and ankg expression were used to define the ais in our culture system. neurons transfected with egfp-kv <dig> -ha were fixed approximately  <dig> h after transfection and immuno-stained for map <dig> or ankg as illustrated in fig.  <dig>  the clustering of kv <dig>  in the proximal segment of a neurite with reduced map <dig> labeling suggests this neurite is likely to develop into the axon and therefore the proximal ais . however, a stronger indication that the region of kv <dig>  accumulation is indeed the ais is the ankg staining shown in fig. 2b. consistent with ais formation in hippocampal cultures, nav <dig>  co-localized with ankg and was enriched in areas devoid of map <dig> staining in parallel cultures .

endogenous kv <dig>  also preferentially localizes to the ais
exogenous expression can lead to artifactual localization. to confirm that kv <dig>  is indeed a component of the ais in hippocampal cultures, non-transfected cells were immuno-stained for endogenous kv <dig>  and map <dig>  kv <dig>  localization in a single proximal neurite with diminished map <dig> staining, i.e. the ais , was observed in 35% of  <dig> div neurons and 63% of  <dig> div neurons . the remaining cells showed no ais localization and a clustered distribution primarily on the cell soma  as previously reported  <cit> . interestingly, as shown in fig.  <dig>  while all cells showed some kv <dig>  localization to the soma, the most intense staining in div  <dig> and  <dig> cultures was within the proximal axon. as the cells matured, i.e. in  <dig> and  <dig> div cultures, the cluster intensity within the cell soma became more equivalent to that in the ais. we observed kv <dig>  expression on map2-positive neurites in only 10% of the  <dig> div neurons and 2% of the day  <dig> and  <dig> cells. consistent with reports of multiple axon formation in this culture paradigm  <cit> ,  <dig> and 25% of the  <dig> and  <dig> div cells, respectively, showed kv <dig>  accumulation in two ais domains. by the  <dig> div time point, approximately 87% of the cells showed dense kv <dig>  expression in one or two ais domains along with expression over the soma. these expression patterns, and the percentage of cells expressing each pattern, are illustrated in additional file  <dig>  to further establish that the endogenous kv <dig>  accumulates at the ais, we used antibodies directed against ankg in conjunction with endogenous kv <dig>  immuno-detection. consistent with ais localization of kv <dig> , the sites of clustering within a proximal neurite corresponded with sites of ankg enrichment .

heterogeneity within the culture system
we did observe variability in the endogenous kv <dig>  expression pattern, for 12% of  <dig> div neurons showed no ais localization. this heterogeneity is not surprising given that hippocampal cultures are heterotypic. under culture conditions similar to ours, previous reports have placed the amount of pyramidal neurons between 80–90% whereas glutamic acid decarboxylase -positive inhibitory interneurons are present at approximately 10–15%  <cit> . hippocampal cultures were stained with an anti-gad <dig> antibody in conjunction with anti-kv <dig>  staining to characterize the distribution of kv <dig>  in interneurons as compared to pyramidal neurons. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the gad-positive neurons  did not exhibit ais localization of kv <dig>  while the gad-negative neurons did . gad-positive neurons did display large kv <dig>  clusters mainly within the cell body as previously described  <cit> . together, these data suggest kv <dig>  preferentially targets to the proximal region of the pyramidal neuron axons . consistent with previous reports, 10% of the neurons in our culture were gad-positive  <cit> .

ais localized kv <dig>  clusters are stable structures containing mobile, but diffusion limited, channels
our previous work with the kv <dig>  clusters on the soma shows that while these structures are stable, they are also highly dynamic, often fusing and fragmenting over several min . to address the long term stability of the ais localized kv <dig>  clusters, we utilized a photoactivatable form of gfp  fused to the n-terminus of kv <dig>   <cit> . we co-transfected  <dig> div hippocampal neurons with equal amounts of mrfp-kv <dig>  and pagfp-kv <dig> -ha and performed live cell image acquisition the following day. taking advantage of the tetrameric nature of kv channels, the mrfp-kv <dig>  construct was included solely to localize the ais targeted channel for photoactivation. the ais localized mrfp/pagfp-kv <dig>  was selected for photoactivation under rfp optics  and successive imaging was performed every two minutes thereafter. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the photo-activated kv <dig>  within the ais remained within the activation area and did not significantly re-distribute over the  <dig> min imaging period. there was no decrease in total ais associated gfp fluorescence over the imaging period . these results imply that the kv <dig>  ais clusters show little lateral diffusion within the membrane and that the channels contained within the ais have residence times that will be measured in hours as opposed to minutes.

our previous studies demonstrated that the kv <dig>  surface clusters on the hippocampal cell body are formed not by the tethering of individual channels to sub-membrane scaffolding proteins but rather by the trapping of mobile channels behind a cytoskeletal-based corral  <cit> . given the stable nature of the ais clusters illustrated in fig.  <dig>  we next sought to determine whether a similar localization mechanism existed within the ais. as in our previous work  <cit> , we used frap within the cluster to address kv <dig>  mobility within the cluster perimeter. as illustrated in fig.  <dig>  when one half of an ais cluster was photo-bleached, gfp fluorescence recovery occurred rapidly with a time constant of  <dig>  sec in this representative example. overall, the mean time constant was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  sec, n =  <dig>  these time constants are nearly identical to the  <dig>  ±  <dig>  sec value observed within clusters on the neuronal cell body  <cit> . this recovery, along with the corresponding decrease in fluorescence in the unbleached cluster half, is indicative of channel mobility within the cluster perimeter and is most consistent with mobile channels being restrained behind a perimeter fence in the ais just as they are on the cell body.

kv <dig>  localizes to hippocampal and cortical ais domains in the intact rat brain
the data presented thus far indicate that both the endogenous and exogenously expressed kv <dig>  accumulate at the ais in hippocampal cultures, often preferring this region to other cell surface sites early in expression. to demonstrate that the robust ais localization observed in our culture system is physiologically relevant, we undertook immuno-localization studies in rat brain. while kv <dig>  immuno-localization within the rat brain had been previously undertaken by several investigators  <cit> , including ourselves , there was no previous suggestion that kv <dig>  exists within the ais, probably due to the difficulty in identifying the relatively narrow ais domains within the dense cell body layers of the hippocampus. however, as illustrated in fig.  <dig>  the use of ankg staining to identify the ais  greatly simplifies matters. within the hippocampal ca <dig> layer, kv <dig>  clusters localized over the neuronal cell body as previously described  <cit>  . however, a linear array of kv <dig>  clusters was also observed within the boundaries of the ankg positive ais , up to  <dig> μm from the cell body . consistent with the localization observed in our cultures of hippocampal neurons, not all the ankyring-defined ais domains contained kv <dig>  clusters . ais localization was also observed within the ca <dig> layer  and ca <dig> . surprisingly, kv <dig>  immuno-localization was not detected in hippocampal sections prior to postnatal day  <dig>  while channel might be diffusely expressed at these earlier developmental time points, the clustered localization typical of adult tissue was never observed. in adult tissue, the percentage of samples showing kv <dig>  positive ais domains in the ca <dig>  ca <dig>  and ca <dig> hippocampal layers were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and 100% , respectively.

as shown in additional file  <dig>  we also observed ais localization in cultured cortical neurons. thus, kv <dig>  targeting to the ais in cortical brain regions was examined also. fig.  <dig> illustrates the localization of kv <dig>  to the neuron cell body and ais in situ in cortical layer iv. in contrast to that observed in the hippocampus, localization of kv <dig>  clusters to the cell body and ais in cortical sections was observed at early developmental times points, even occasionally at post natal day  <dig> 

discussion
any kv <dig>  localization to the ais in cultured hippocampal neurons has been proposed to be a simple tissue culture artifact  <cit> . however, the data presented above indicate that both transfected and endogenous kv <dig>  often preferentially target to the ais prior to accumulating at somatic cluster sites. most importantly, we routinely detected ais localization of kv <dig>  in the hippocampus and cortex of adult rats, suggesting a role for kv <dig>  in regulating axon excitability in vivo. the ais-localized kv <dig>  channels reside within clusters similar to those found on the soma in that mobile channels are corralled within a perimeter fence  <cit> . however, the clusters themselves appear to be more stable within the ais as compared to their cell body counterparts, consistent with ideas that cytoskeletal structures restrict the diffusion of membrane components within the ais  <cit> .

our results indicate that transfected kv <dig>  accumulates at the ais of hippocampal neurons prior to other cell surface sites . endogenous channel also concentrates at the ais in  <dig> and  <dig> div neurons . given that the kv <dig>  surface clusters are sites where trafficking vesicles deliver channel to the cell surface  <cit> , it is possible that vesicles containing newly synthesized kv <dig>  are delivered first to the ais. a fraction of the ais localized channel could then be internalized and redistributed over the soma. another possibility is that kv <dig>  is inserted into the soma membrane and then diffuses into the ais clusters where it becomes trapped. such a diffusion-trap mechanism has been proposed for voltage-gated na+ channels that are ais localized  <cit> . alternatively, perhaps delivery occurs equally at the ais and soma sites but since the ais is the only neurite receiving the nascent channel, and the newly inserted channel is diluted over all the soma sites, we are left with only the appearance of selective ais insertion. future experiments will distinguish between these possibilities.

more than 87% of  <dig> div neurons demonstrate endogenous kv <dig>  concentration at the ais. why this localization has not been observed by other investigators is unclear. perhaps subtle differences in tissue culture conditions could account for the discrepancy. previous kv <dig>  localizations in adult brain, as performed by other investigators  <cit>  and ourselves , also failed to detect kv <dig>  expression in the ais. it is possible that the ais localization was missed because without simultaneous ankyring staining and high resolution confocal imaging, it is difficult to identify the ais structure within the dense layers of neuronal cell bodies in the hippocampus. the finding that not all hippocampal neurons show kv <dig>  localization in the ais agrees with the fig.  <dig> data showing a lack of ais localization in gad-positive inhibitory neurons.

CONCLUSIONS
while a high concentration of sodium channels at the ais ensures axonal action potential generation  <cit> , it is not clear what role kv <dig>  plays in this specialized cell surface domain. kv <dig>  has slow activation kinetics and is therefore unlikely to contribute significantly to repolarization during a single action potential. however, kv <dig>  could regulate axonal excitability following trains of action potentials, for studies by mcbain and co-workers indicate that reduction of kv <dig>  in pyramidal neurons results in a broadening of the action potential waveform  <cit> . recently, the kv <dig>  channel, which cannot form heterotetrameric complexes with kv <dig> , has been localized to the ais of neurons in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body  <cit> . kv <dig> , which is functionally similar to kv <dig> , is proposed to enhance the recovery of ais sodium channels from the inactive state by hyperpolarizing the membrane potential during repetitive action potential firing  <cit> . kv <dig>  could be performing a similar function. in addition, concentration of kv <dig>  at the ais could regulate the back-propagation of depolarization into the soma. given that multiple phosphorylation sites within the kv <dig>  c-terminus influence the voltage-dependence of activation  <cit> , the phosphorylation of ais-localized kv <dig>  provides a mechanism to regulate axonal excitability.
