BACKGROUND
plant breeders use genetic variation from elite and diverse lines as the primary source for cultivar development and trait improvement. in some cases, traits of interest cannot be found within this “standing” variation in the current germplasm. however, mutagenesis or genetic transformation can provide a means to introduce such traits. standard mutagenesis treatments, such as fast neutron  irradiation, alter dna sequences at random loci throughout the genome in an attempt to generate novel trait variation  <cit> . genetic transformation, alternatively, attempts to insert one or few transgenes to confer a novel trait or disrupt the activity of an endogenous gene.

the genetic transformation of most crop species requires plant tissue culture methods, which can introduce heritable phenotypes caused by unintended genetic and epigenetic changes  <cit> . these unintended changes, known as somaclonal variation, may theoretically compromise the safety of transgenic plants  <cit> . therefore, it is important to understand the coupled effects of genetic transformation and tissue culture  <cit>  and how these compare to standing and other types of induced variation.

naturally occurring variation is a well-established source of novel phenotypes in many vegetatively propagated fruits and vegetables, where they are commonly known as ‘sports’  <cit> . somaclonal variation induced through tissue culture, first observed in sugarcane   <cit> , has been reported in many other plant species  <cit> . desirable agronomic traits and released cultivars have even been derived from this type of induced variation  <cit> . the molecular underpinnings of somaclonal variation can include dna sequence changes, chromosome rearrangements, aneuploidy, activation of transposable elements, and epigenetic restructuring  <cit> . genome-wide single nucleotide changes resulting from tissue culture have been recently observed using next-generation sequencing  in arabidopsis  <cit>  and rice . these studies suggest tissue culture might increase the single nucleotide mutation rate and may activate transposons  <cit> .

the insertion of a transgene is also known to create localized or dispersed genomic changes. recent studies found that transformation can result in dna inserted at multiple loci, multiple transgenes per locus, fragmented t-dna, and chromosome rearrangements , though such complex events are rare and often discarded rather than commercialized. in arabidopsis, transgene insertion is generally random across chromosomes, in both genic and non-genic sequences, and frequently associated with a deletion ranging from  <dig> to 100 bp in size  <cit> . for soybean , agrobacterium based transformation methods occasionally result in multiple insertion sites, tandem insertions, and integration of plasmid backbone sequences  <cit> . recently, resequencing methods have been used to accurately localize and resolve transgene insertions in different plant species . while advanced technologies have helped detect the local and dispersed effects of tissue culture and transformation, limitations still exist due to sequencing errors, genetic heterogeneity of plant accessions, and reference bias  <cit> .

separating the changes induced by transformation from pre-existing genetic variation can be a challenge  <cit> . plant genomes can vary dramatically between cultivars. a large portion of this variation occurs as genomic structural variants , such as large deletions and duplications  <cit> . these sv are associated with a number of biologically and agriculturally important traits  <cit> . previous studies in soybean have used array-based comparative genomic hybridization  or resequencing approaches to observe levels of standing sv among accessions  <cit> , or sv induced through fn mutagenesis  <cit> . however, no comparable studies have addressed the incidence of tissue culture and transformation on rates of genome-wide sv in soybean.

this study investigates five transgenic  soybean plants derived from standard agrobacterium-mediated transformation. sv in these five plants was assessed by cgh and two of these plants were resequenced to ascertain the frequency of nucleotide substitutions. these data allow for comparisons of genomic variation in transgenic plants to the genomic variation observed in mutagenized and standing accessions. these analyses provide new insight towards understanding somaclonal variation, the effects of transgene insertion, the inheritance of sv, and the genomic consequences of developing mutant and transgenic stocks as compared to the standing variation already present in the soybean germplasm.

RESULTS
genome-wide structural variation
a cgh tiling microarray with  <dig>  million features was used to estimate the genomic locations and sizes of sv events in the genomes of three classes of germplasm. the first class consisted of five transgenic plants each derived from a unique agrobacterium-based transformation event. each transgenic plant contained a different transgene , and each event was specified by a unique whole plant transformation  identifier. a range of different transgene types were represented among the five plants, including a green fluorescence protein  transgene, an rnai hairpin, a zinc-finger nuclease , a transcription activator-like effector nuclease , and an mping-pong transposon. genotyping was done on the t <dig> generation. genome-wide cgh screens for deletions and duplications revealed single, unique sv in four of the five genotypes. these consisted of three deletions and one duplication . the plant wpt_312-5- <dig>  did not exhibit any sv.table  <dig> results from cgh, breakpoint sequencing, tail-pcr, and resequencing of transgenic plants

the second class, sampling fn-induced variation, consisted of a sub-set of plants from a larger mutant population developed in the genotype ‘m92-220’  <cit> . this subset included ten plants with an associated mutant phenotype  and  <dig> plants that exhibited no obvious mutant phenotypes, and were thus referred to as “no-phenotype”. the final class, representing inter-cultivar variation, came from a previous study of genic sv  <cit> , and consisted of  <dig> parental lines from a soybean nested association mapping  population .

all three datasets  were designed to detect sv in each individual genotype as compared to an appropriate reference . the transgenic plants were compared to the transformation parent line , the fn plants compared to the mutagenesis parent line , and the soynam parents were compared to the reference genotype ‘williams 82’. the methods section includes analysis details and information on how extant heterogeneity within the background cultivars was addressed.

as shown in fig.  <dig>  cgh results varied by chromosome and by class. in this figure each black dot represents a single probe’s log <dig> ratio score. clusters of dots above or below zero are putative duplications or deletions, respectively. inter-cultivar variation, shown as the comparison of soynam parent ld02- <dig> to ‘williams 82’ , occurs frequently and on nearly every chromosome. the amount of inter-cultivar variation is strikingly high when compared to a fn or transgenic plant . the sv observed in fn or transformed plants was easier to detect, but occurred much less frequently.fig.  <dig> visual comparison of cgh data for individuals from the three germplasm classes and control. each black dot represents a single probe and its log <dig> ratio score. data are shown from chromosome  <dig> on the left and chromosome  <dig> on the right for all samples. a the standing inter-cultivar variation between lines ld02- <dig> and ‘williams 82’ is shown. b fast neutron  plant 1r19c96cfr293amn <dig> is compared to the fn parent line ‘m92-220’. c transgenic plant wpt_389-2- <dig> is compared to the parent line ‘bert’; it shows relatively little noise and one true sv on chromosome  <dig>  d the control cgh compared ‘bert-mn-01’ to itself



the number of genes putatively deleted or duplicated varied widely among the classes. among the inter-cultivar comparisons, the total number of genes overlapping with duplications ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> per pairwise cultivar comparison, while the number of genes overlapping with deletions varied from  <dig> to  <dig> per comparison . the fn class had a lower median genic sv per plant  but was highly variable, as the number of genes overlapping with duplications ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  per plant, and the number of genes overlapping with deletions ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> per plant. the average size of the sv in the fn plants was over  <dig>  bp, which is inflated by a small number of exceptionally large sv. nevertheless, this value is substantially larger than those observed in the inter-cultivar class, where the average was less than  <dig>  bp . of the four sv events in the transgenic plants, only two affected gene space. this included one deletion in plant wpt_389-2- <dig> that affected four genes on chromosome  <dig>  and one duplication in plant wpt_301-3- <dig> that encompassed two genes on chromosome  <dig> . overall, the average number of genes affected by cgh-detectable sv in transgenic plants was estimated to be one order of magnitude less than that induced by fns and two orders less than that observed among soybean varieties.fig.  <dig> distribution of genic sv from the three germplasm classes. genic sv are found in individuals as standing variation in diverse cultivars , induced by fast neutron mutagenesis , or induced by the transformation process . each column in the graph is a single genotype. light gray bars represent “duplicated genes,” those overlapping putatively duplicated regions. dark gray bars represent “deleted genes,” those overlapping putatively deleted regions

validation of sv in the transgenic plants
the four incidences of sv detected with cgh in the transgenic plants were confirmed using pcr. two sv events overlapped with genes, including a  <dig>  bp deletion on chromosome  <dig> in wpt_389-2- <dig>  and a  <dig>  bp duplication on chromosome  <dig> in wpt_301-3- <dig> . the two non-genic deletions included  <dig>  bp on chromosome  <dig> in wpt_384-1- <dig>  and  <dig>  bp on chromosome  <dig> in wpt_391-1- <dig> . sequence data from all four sv junctions showed evidence of microhomology-mediated dna repair .

screening a subset of these sv by pcr confirmed they were not intra-cultivar variation in the ‘bert’ or ‘williams 82’ backgrounds, as is known to exist at some loci  <cit>  , or derived from contamination or outcrossing from other lines . the deletions on chromosome  <dig> and chromosome  <dig> were stably inherited in t <dig> siblings and t <dig> offspring , indicating these events were both present in their respective t <dig> generations. the deletion on chromosome  <dig> was homozygous and therefore present in the t <dig> generation assuming sv is induced on a single chromosome and then becomes a homozygous deletion through genetic segregation. these data indicate these sv were derived de novo. the duplication on chromosome  <dig>  however, is not found in any individual other than the t <dig> transgenic genotype, wpt_301-3- <dig>  the offspring , siblings , and parent  of this individual were all tested and showed no evidence of the duplication on chromosome  <dig> . this evidence suggests the duplication arose in a post transformation generation and may not be directly attributable to the transformation process.

transgene insertion sites
transgenic plants were analyzed for number of transgene insertions and location of transgene. southern blots of siblings or parents of wpt_301-3- <dig>  wpt_312-5- <dig>  and wpt_389-2- <dig> each showed evidence for single locus integration . thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr  mapped the single insertion sites in wpt_389-2- <dig>  wpt_384-1- <dig>  and wpt_301-3- <dig>  resequencing data were also used to localize the t-dna insertion site in wpt_389-2- <dig> and wpt_391-1- <dig>  transgene results are summarized in table  <dig>  transgenes were all found to occur on different chromosomes than the aforementioned sv . transgene insertion and repair was observed to coincide with microhomology between the genome and the left border .fig.  <dig> transgene insertion locus and induced homozygous deletions in transgenic plant wpt_389-2- <dig>  a a graphical interpretation of the transgene orientation and induced deletions at this locus is shown. the transgene insertion on chromosome  <dig> contains four primary elements between the left and right borders: pong, mping, tpase, and bar. colored lines correspond to the breakpoint sequence results. b results of breakpoint sequencing show a  <dig>  bp deletion adjacent to the t-dna right border . the deletion results in a unique junction connecting two genomic segments  immediately adjacent to a 6 bp track of filler sequence , and then the t-dna right border . c a 37 bp deletion is found at the left border-genome junction . microhomology occurs across the large deletion and between the left border and the genome



according to the whole genome resequencing data from two transgenic plants, transgene insertions in wpt_389-2- <dig> and wpt_391-1- <dig> both induced adjacent deletions too small for cgh detection . the deletion induced by the transgene insertion in wpt_391-1- <dig> was ~ <dig>  bp and occurred adjacent to the transgene .

the transgene locus from wpt_389-2- <dig> was more complex. as outlined in fig. 5a, the transgene  induced two deletions and a 6-bp insertion of filler sequence in the t-dna integration process. this transgene integration and associated mutations occurred in the promoter region and 5′utr of glyma13g <dig>  the wpt_389-2-2 t-dna and adjacent mutations were homozygous in this t <dig> plant. the resequencing data aligned to the transgene found nine read-pairs that spanned the mping-pong portion of the construct  suggesting one of the homologous chromosomes has a transgene where this mping-pong portion was deleted or jumped out , as has been demonstrated with this element  <cit> . had this transposon reintegrated in the genome, the methodology used for transgene mapping should have detected it.

genome-wide single nucleotide substitutions
resequencing data were used to assess the frequency of nucleotide substitutions within the inter-cultivar, fn, and transgenic classes. based on earlier studies, it has been established that pairwise comparisons of soybean cultivars typically identify over one-million single base substitutions  <cit> . we tested our substitution identification pipeline by resequencing cultivars ‘archer’ and ‘noir 1’. these data corroborated earlier studies, as ‘archer’ and ‘noir 1’ respectively exhibited  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> homozygous substitutions compared to the soybean reference genome ‘williams 82’.

resequencing data were then used to assess the frequency of nucleotide substitutions in the previously sequenced ten mutant phenotype fn plants and the fn parent ‘m92-220’  <cit>  . substitutions were detected and filtered so only those homozygous and novel to one plant were included. this filtering method was based on previous mutation accumulation studies  <cit> . the fn mutagenized plants had on the order of tens of unique homozygous substitutions per individual , with the highest individual exhibiting  <dig> substitutions. however, most of these substitutions may be attributed to spontaneous processes  <cit>  rather than the fn treatment, as the nonmutagenized ‘m92-220’ control also exhibited  <dig> unique substitutions relative to the ten fn plants. as shown in fig. 6a, substitutions in the fn plants were distributed across many more chromosomes than sv.fig.  <dig> genome wide view of induced variation detected through cgh and resequencing. the genomic locations of nucleotide substitutions , large duplications , and large deletions  are shown for ten fast neutron plants  and two transgenic plants . regions were filtered for background line heterogeneity such that only variants unique to one individual are shown. a fast neutron plants, including the parent ‘m92-220’  and fn02-fn <dig>  are shown. background is shaded according to fast neutron irradiation dosage: gray is the non-irradiated parent ‘m92-220’, light red is 32 gy , and green is 16 gy . b unique genetic variation in two different sequenced ‘bert’ parent individuals , and transgenic plants wpt_391-1- <dig> and wpt_389-2- <dig>  is shown. transgene insertion sites are noted by green arrows and bars




the two resequenced transgenic plants were also analyzed for homozygous and novel substitutions, along with two non-transgenic ‘bert’ control plants . the number of novel homozygous base-pair substitutions per individual were as follows: two in plant wpt_391-1- <dig>  eighteen in plant wpt_389-2- <dig>  one in the first ‘bert’ control plant, and two in the second ‘bert’ control plant. the location of the substitutions in the transgenic plants appeared unrelated to the location of the transgene insertions or the induced sv  and did not occur in coding regions .

discussion
in this study, we observed the rates of sv and single nucleotide substitutions in transgenic and fn plants and explored the genetic nature of the unintended consequences of these breeding practices. the primary safety concern relating to these genomic changes is that novel genetic variants might disrupt genes or pathways leading to an unforeseen harmful byproduct  <cit> . therefore, we focused our comparisons specifically on the protein-encoding gene space, with less emphasis on intergenic space and heterochromatin. furthermore, we focused on the number of genes affected by new mutations rather than on the risk associated with a specific mutation or disruption of a specific gene. while the latter is of critical importance, it is impossible to estimate the specific effects of mutating each of the over  <dig>  soybean genes. therefore, for this discussion, differences in the number of total genes disrupted serves as a proxy for the amount of risk associated with each of these tools for genetic variation.

the sv observed in the inter-cultivar comparison was widespread throughout the genome, including many events that were repeatedly found in multiple lines and several events that encompassed only a single gene. this diversity has presumably accumulated through ongoing spontaneous mutation over numerous generations. each of the genetic variants seen in this class would not be perceived to pose a new risk to consumers, as they likely already exist in the current marketplace. furthermore, the genetic variation currently segregating in these lines represents only a subset of the total genetic diversity found in glycine max or the wild progenitor glycine soja  <cit> . genetic variation arising spontaneously, or introgressed from diverse lines into elite cultivars, is a process by which even cultivars developed through traditional breeding methodology unintentionally introduce novel variants to the marketplace.

the sv observed in the fn plants contrasts with the patterns of sv in the inter-cultivar class. sv induced through fn mutagenesis are oftentimes large and highly variable from plant to plant in terms of the number of genes affected. the large sizes of some of the sv observed in the no-phenotype fn plants were unexpected, as multigene deletions and duplications would be expected to cause noticeable phenotypic changes.

the transgenic class had so few sv that it is difficult to compare with the other classes. the events observed through cgh are moderate in size, impacting a combined total of only six genes among the five plants. while this likely represents a single generation increase in the sv mutation rate compared to the spontaneous sv mutation rate in soybeans, the total amount of genetic disturbance is substantially less than that observed in the standing soybean collection or the fn-induced plants. working under the aforementioned assumption that each gene deleted or duplicated may pose a safety risk, one would conclude that the transgenic plants in this study are of lower risk than the vast majority of the fn plants analyzed, in terms of background genome disruption. furthermore, while some induced variation may occur at the transgene locus, extensive backcrossing to introgress transgenes into elite backgrounds  makes any new sv event unlinked to the transgene inconsequential to the final cultivar.

while these transformation-induced events seem inconsequential when compared to those induced through fns or found as standing variation, the novel sv identified in these plants exhibited several interesting properties. the discovery of locally induced deletions, the addition of filler sequence, and microhomology between the left border and the insertion site, corroborate previous patterns of t-dna insertion in arabidopsis  <cit> . the ~1 kb deletions found at transgene insertion sites in both of the resequenced soybean plants are substantially larger than the deletions previously found in arabidopsis, but the sampling of only two plants is not sufficient to infer a general pattern. short sequence homology was observed at the t-dna insertion sites and also at the breakpoints of the four sv observed at non-transgene loci in these plants. these results imply that the microhomology-mediated end joining pathway  <cit>  may be frequently involved in the dna repair of these events.

the use of fn mutagenesis or tissue culture/transformation has been previously reported to result in a single generation increase in single nucleotide substitutions . a single nucleotide substitution disrupting a coding or regulatory region could similarly have an assumed safety risk associated with a novel byproduct. the fn and transgenic plants in this study accumulated a similar number of unique homozygous substitutions compared to a subset of previously published results. for example, a fn mutagenesis study in arabidopsis detected between  <dig> and  <dig> novel homozygous substitutions per m <dig> plant  <cit>  and a similar study of arabidopsis tissue culture reported between  <dig> and  <dig> novel homozygous substitutions per r <dig>  plant  <cit> . in rice, a fn mutagenesis study observed between  <dig> and  <dig> mutations per line in an m <dig> population, with the majority of mutations being single base substitutions  <cit> , and a tissue culture study found no considerable difference in the number of variants in transgenic compared to control  plants  <cit> . in the present study, the number of unique homozygous substitutions observed in our control plants was similar to the number in the fn or transgenic plants, respectively. this implies that most of the identified substitutions were likely due to spontaneous mutation rather than a treatment effect of mutagenesis or transformation. in terms of single nucleotide substitutions, this result indicates that there is minimal difference in the safety risks associated with the three germplasm classes. this result stands in contrast to some of the previous studies of tissue culture in rice, where the authors concluded that there was a significantly higher number of induced homozygous substitutions and associated mutation rates  <cit> . a number of confounding factors might affect these incongruities, including differences in the species examined, snp calling methods and thresholds, adjustments for intra-cultivar heterogeneity, fn dosage or tissue culture conditions and timeline, the inclusion of a control plant, and the number of plants sampled.

based on data from the present study, it appears the use of fn mutagenesis can produce profound new sv events and may slightly increase the number of single nucleotide substitutions. tissue culture/transformation methodologies can also produce new sv and possibly increase the nucleotide substitution rate. however, the number of sv and single nucleotide polymorphisms existing as standing variation in soybean cultivars dwarfs the induced variation observed in both fn and transformed plants. while these findings are noteworthy, it is unclear how broadly they can be applied. all of the transgenic plants in this study were obtained from agrobacterium-mediated transformation; further work would test other transformation techniques such as biolistic-based methods. similarly, fn irradiation was the only mutagenesis system tested; other mutagens  would likely induce different mutational profiles. furthermore, a deeper sampling of mutated and transformed plants, perhaps among different plant species, would be required to generalize the sv and nucleotide trends observed. detailed sequence analysis of specific transgene loci did identify a small number of intermediate-sized deletions adjacent to transgenes, but there was no systematic attempt to detect intermediate-sized  deletions/duplications genome-wide. additional variants have also been reported to exist in fn  <cit>  and transgenic plants  but were not assessed within this dataset, including insertions, inversions and translocations, as well as epigenetic or transcriptional perturbations. lastly, soybean is a palaeopolyploid species. it is likely that a true polyploid  species may exhibit differential tolerance or lack of tolerance to the type of genetic perturbations associated with these technologies.

CONCLUSIONS
the total findings of this study help to inform the discussion currently surrounding the unintended consequences of genetic transformation in crop improvement  <cit> . first, the frequency of induced sv events appears to be low, particularly in comparison to the frequency of those induced by fns. additionally, these rare sv events are likely indistinguishable from other spontaneously occurring sv or those already present in the existing germplasm. as demonstrated by the genetic variability in the no-phenotype fn plants, sv generated de novo are not necessarily associated with novel or noticeable phenotypic traits, even when these sv events are large. therefore, the speculated risk of unintended genetic consequences in tissue culture/transformation may only merit as much consideration as given to variation arising spontaneously, through traditional breeding practices, or other genetic variation induction methods.
