BACKGROUND
the pelota gene  encodes an evolutionary conserved protein which has been identified in various species  <cit> . the protein contains an rna binding domain similar to that found in members of the eukaryotic release factor  <dig>  family, which are involved in terminal stop of protein synthesis  <cit> .

the biological role of pelo was originally identified in d. melanogaster. in male mutants, mitosis during germ cell development is normally progressed, but the cell cycle of the first meiotic division is arrested in late prophase stage. on the contrary, during oogenesis only mitotic division is affected. moreover, the eye of mutant flies has disordered ommatidial array and the orientation of bristles suggests the impairment of planar cell polarity during eye development  <cit> . the role of pelo in meiotic and mitotic division was also confirmed in s. cerevisiae, where the deletion of the pelo orthologue gene dom <dig> causes growth retardation and defective sporulation. the decrease of polyribosomal and increase of free ribosomal fraction in dom34? mutants suggest a participation of pelo in the machinery of protein synthesis or in the regulation of mrna translation  <cit> .

translational control of eukaryotic gene expression plays an essential role in the development and differentiation of cells and provides an important checkpoint for cell growth and differentiation. deletion of the pelo gene in mice revealed that pelo-deficient embryos failed to develop after implantation. culture of blastocyts in vitro demonstrated the failure of mitotically active inner cell mass  of pelo-/- blastocysts to expand in growth. these results suggest that pelo is essential for regulation of the cell cycle during gastrulation  <cit> . another interpretation for the failure of the icm to proliferate might be due to the fact that stem cells of pelo-/- embryos fail to self-renewal. the role of pelo in control of germ stem cell  self-renewal has already been shown in d. melanogaster  <cit> 

to further elucidate the possible function of pelo, we searched for proteins that bind to pelo. we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using pelo as a bait. several positive clones including hax <dig>  eif3g and srpx were isolated. using gst pull-down assay and co-immunoprecipitation, we confirmed the specific interactions of pelo with the putative interacting proteins and found that the c-terminal and acidic tail domains are responsible for the interactions with partner proteins. to further support the specificity of interactions between pelo and its putative partners and to determine the subcellular localization of the interacting proteins, we performed bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay , and observed that protein complexes resulting from the interactions between pelo and either hax <dig>  eif3g or srpx are associated with the cytoskeleton.

RESULTS
pelo is subcellularly localized at the actin microfilaments
rna analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of pelo  <cit> . to determine the subcellular localization, anti-pelo antibodies were generated against a gst-pelo fusion protein containing the full-length human amino acid sequence. affinity-purified gst-pelo antibodies predominantly detected a  <dig> kda protein band , which is consistent with the predicted molecular mass of pelo. detection of the  <dig> kda protein was greatly reduced or even not found after preabsorption of the antibody with the antigen, to which it was, raised . pelo expression was then examined by western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. western blot analysis showed that anti-pelo recognizes the  <dig> kda protein band in a wide variety of mammalian cells and tissues . the subcellular localization of pelo was firstly studied by western blot analysis, we used two different biochemical fractionation techniques as described in methods part to produce cytoskeletal, cytoplasmic, nuclear and membrane extracts. purity of the fractions was assessed by examining each fraction for the presence or absence of α-actinin, a cytoskeletal marker, and phospho h <dig> histone, a nuclear marker. as expected, α-actinin and phospho-histone h <dig> were only found in the cytoskeletal and nuclear fractions, respectively. pelo was exclusively present in the cytoskeletal and in the membrane fractions . the proportion of pelo in the cytoskeletal fraction was higher than that in the membrane fraction. to confirm the association of pelo with the cytoskeleton, cultured primary fibroblast was immunofluorescently stained with anti-pelo antibody. a fibrillar staining pattern was observed in the cytoplasm. pelo also localized at some regions of plasma membrane and near the nuclear membrane presumably to the endoplasmic reticulum . to study whether pelo is associated with the actin cytoskeleton, cells were probed with fitc-labelled phalloidin that stains polymerized f-actin . overlay images demonstrate co-localization of f-actin and pelo , that implies that pelo is associated with actin microfilaments. this result is consistent with that obtained by western blot analysis.

pelo overexpression disrupts actin stress fibers and reduces cell growth and spreading
to determine the effect of pelo overexpression, hep2g cells were transfected with either myc-tagged pelo or an empty pcdna vector as a control and stable transfected clones were selected. expression and specificity of the transfected construct were confirmed by western blot analysis using monoclonal antibody against the c-myc epitope. as shown in figure 2a, the anti-myc antibody specifically recognizes a  <dig> kda myc-pelo fusion protein in extracts of recombinant clones, but not in control cell line. we then used the clones l <dig> and l <dig>  which exhibit higher and lower levels of myc-pelo expression, respectively, in further experiments. to determine cytoskeleton organization in myc-pelo-overexpressing cell lines, cells were stained with fitc-phalloidin. in cells expressing high levels of myc-pelo , no stress fibers were detected by phalloidin staining . however, f-actin is still present in these cells as shown by diffuse cytoplasmic phalloidin-fitc labelling . in contrast, actin stress fibers were intact in low myc-pelo-expressing cells  . these results suggest that expression of pelo at high levels results in disassembly of stress actin.

proliferation assays showed a significant reduction in growth rate of stable myc-pelo-overexpressing cell lines l <dig> and l <dig> as compared to control cells . the level of reduction in growth rate between both myc-pelo-overexpressing cell lines correlated with the expression level of myc-pelo . anchorage-independent growth is a generally accepted indicator of the transformed phenotype in vitro. to investigate whether the overexpression of pelo alters the anchorage-independent growth ability of hepg <dig> hepatoma cells, we compared the ability of l <dig> and l <dig> to growth in soft agar. as shown in figure 2e, the number of colonies in l <dig> and l <dig> cell lines was significantly lower than those of mock-transfected hepg <dig> cells . the anchorage-independent growth capacity was also correlated with the level of pelo protein in each cell line. to investigate whether the disruption of actin stress fibers in myc-pelo-overexpressing cells affects the spreading behaviour, cells were seeded onto fibronectin-coated plates. at  <dig> min after seeding, the majority of myc-pelo-overexpressing and control cells had not spread and exhibited a round morphology. at  <dig> h after seeding, 34% and 70% of l <dig> and l <dig> cells were spread, respectively, compared with 90% of control cells . taken together, these results indicate that myc-pelo-overexpression affects cell proliferation and spreading following cell adhesion.

pelo interacts with hax <dig>  eif3g and srpx
to determine the molecular basis of pelo association with the cytoskeleton, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed to identify pelo-interacting proteins. as a bait, we cloned full length pelo into the screening vector. with this screening, several putative interacting partners for pelo were identified. among them, two clones contain a cdna sequence for hax <dig>  and two clones coding a sequence of eif3g and srpx. the identified cdna fragments contained the partial coding sequences of hax <dig> , eif3g  and srpx . several control experiments were performed to assess the fidelity of these interactions in yeast. neither the bait nor hax <dig>  eif3g or srpx vectors autonomously activated the reporter genes in the yeast two-hybrid system, when grown in the appropriated nutrient-deficient media  .

to identify and verify the region of pelo responsible for specific interactions with hax <dig>  eif3g and srpx, several gst-pelo fusion proteins were generated containing deletions of different pelo domains . next, the binding activity of the different gst-pelo fusion proteins with the putative interacting proteins was tested in a gst pull-down assay. cells lysates from hela cells transiently transfected with myc-tagged hax <dig>  eif3g or srpx expression vectors were incubated with different gst-pelo fusion proteins bound to glutathione-sepharose beads. after extensive washing, proteins bound to beads were immunoblotted with monoclonal anti-myc antibody. as shown in the top panel of figure 3c, gst- <dig> and gst- <dig> fusion proteins, but not gst- <dig>  gst- <dig> and gst- <dig> interact with the  <dig> kda myc-hax <dig> . deletion of the acidic tail domain  of pelo  in both gst- <dig> and gst- <dig> fusion proteins demonstrates that the at domain of pelo is responsible for binding to hax <dig>  in further pull-down assays with protein extracts of hela cells transfected with either myc-tagged eif3g or srpx constructs, gst- <dig>  gst- <dig> and gst- <dig>  but not gst- <dig> and gst- <dig> exhibited strong association to the  <dig> kda myc-eif3g  and  <dig> kda myc-srpx, respectively . these results indicate that the c-terminal domain of pelo  is essential for binding to eif3g and srpx in vitro. taken together, these results confirm the interactions of pelo with hax <dig>  eif3g and sprx, which were found as interaction proteins of pelo in a yeast two-hybrid assay.

the interactions of pelo with the putative interacting proteins were further studied in hela cells, which were transiently co-transfected with ha-tagged pelo  expression vectors and either myc-tagged hax <dig>  eif3g or srpx constructs. cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal anti-myc antibody or control mouse igg, followed by western blot analysis with a polyclonal anti-ha antibody. a single polypeptide band of  <dig> kda in size, consistent with the molecular mass of pelo-ha, was detected in input lysates and in all immunoprecipitated assays with anti-ha, but not in control mouse igg-immunoprecipitates . in the opposite experiments, lysates of co-transfected hela cells with pelo-ha and either myc-tagged hax <dig>  eif3g or srpx construct were immunoprecipitated with either ha-tag or pelo antibodies. the precipitates were then immunoblotted and probed with monoclonal myc-tag antibodies. single polypeptide bands of  <dig> kda,  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda in size, consistent with the expected molecular masses of cloned myc-hax <dig>  myc-eif3g and myc-srpx, respectively, were shown in input lysates and in anti-ha tag and anti-pelo immunoprecipitates but not in rabbit igg-immunoprecipitates . collectively, these results clearly demonstrate that pelo forms protein complexes with hax <dig>  eif3g and srpx in hela cells.

co-localization of pelo and its interacting proteins at the cytoskeleton
similar to the subcellular distribution of pelo, hax <dig> was also reported to be localized to actin stress fibers  <cit> . transiently co-transfected hela cells were immunofluorescent stained with anti-ha and anti-myc antibodies to show whether pelo and its binding partners hax <dig>  eif3g or srpx are associated with the cellular cytoskeleton. pelo-ha and myc-hax <dig> were diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm of co-transfected cells . these results further support our finding that the overexpression of pelo in stable overexpressing cell lines disrupts the organization of the actin cytoskeleton.

to overcome the failure to determine the subcellular localization of the protein interaction in living cells and to further support the biochemical interactions of pelo with its putative binding partners, we performed bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays . this approach is based on the complementation between two non-fluorescent fragments of egfp when they are brought together by interaction of two proteins fused to each fragment. this assay is effective in determining the interaction of proteins by visualization of fluorescence on protein complexes in living cells  <cit> . for bifc analysis, we generated an expression vector by fusing the full-length pelo cdna in-frame to the c-terminal half of egfp , whereas the n-terminal half of egfp was fused with hax <dig> , eif3g  or srpx . cells transfected with either both empty vectors or with either pelo-gfpc or hax1-gfpn alone did not show any fluorescence . in contrast, cells co-transfected with pelo-gfpc and hax1-gfpn displayed fluorescence, which was mainly accumulated at the cytoskeletal filaments . similar patterns of subcellular localization of fluorescent complementation were observed when the fusion proteins pelo-gfpc with either eif3g-gfpn or srpx-gfpn were expressed in hela cells . in a control experiment, cells co-transfected with pelo-gfpc and mos-gfpn containing the sequence of the mos gene, which did not show to be an interacting-protein of pelo, did not reveal any fluorescent staining . taken together, these results demonstrate that pelo interacts with hax <dig>  eif3g and srpx, and the resulting protein complexes are associated with the cytoskeleton.

discussion
current data on the consequences of pelo deficiency in drosophila and mouse suggest that pelo is involved in the regulation of stem cell renewal  <cit> . in yeast dom 34/pelo has been described to play a critical role in a new surveillance pathway termed no-go decay  <cit> . this pathway clears cells from mrnas that induce translational stalls through endonuclease cleavage that is thought to be mediated by dom34/pelo and its interacting protein hbs <dig>  dom <dig> and hbs <dig> are related to the translation termination factor erf <dig> and erf <dig>  respectively. beside the role of erf <dig> and erf <dig> in translation, both proteins are involved in cytoskeleton organization in yeast  <cit> . deletion of erf <dig> disrupted actin cytoskeleton in most cells. in contrast, these effects were not observed in cell deficient for erf <dig>  a structural homolog pelo  <cit> .

following cell adhesion, cells rearrange their cytoskeleton and spread by increasing their contact with extracellular matrix, and through formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions  <cit> . analyses of stable pelo-expressing cell lines revealed that cell lines showing higher pelo expression, which was correlated with reduced growth rates, spread much slower. these results suggest that expression of pelo at higher levels resulted in the disassembly of actin stress fibers and reduced cell spreading.

to gain more insight into the function of pelo, a cdna library was screened by yeast two-hybrid assay for pelo-interacting proteins. this lead to the identification of three proteins that interact with pelo: multifunctional protein hax <dig>  the eukaryotic initiation factor eif3g and the apoptosis-inducing tumor suppressor srpx/rds. the interactions of pelo with hax <dig>  eif3g and srpx in yeast were corroborated by three lines of evidences. all gst-pelo fusion proteins except those lacking the c-terminal domain of pelo extracted the recombinant myc-hax <dig>  myc-eif3g and myc-srpx from extracts of transiently transfected hela cells suggesting that the c-terminal domain of pelo is responsible for specific binding with interacting proteins. pelo was specifically co-immunoprecipitated with hax <dig>  eif3g and srpx from cell extracts. finally, bifc analysis revealed that formed protein complexes are localized at the cytoskeleton of mammalian cells.

hax <dig>  a  <dig> kda polypeptide, interacts with a heterogeneous group of proteins including the α-subunit of the heterodimeric g-protein gα <dig> and cortactin, which are colocalized with hax <dig> at the actin cytoskeleton. overexpression of hax <dig> in stably transfected cells reduces the formation of actin stress fibers  <cit> , a phenotype which was also shown in pelo-overexpressing cell line. hax <dig> is a multifunctional protein, active in different cellular compartments and involved in various cellular processes. attention has been focused on its function in apoptosis and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. however, it has been reported that hax <dig> is an rna-binding protein and may be has a regulatory role in stabilization and/or transport of mrna  <cit> .

eif3g represents a subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor  <dig> . the eif <dig> complex consists of at least  <dig> subunits and plays a central role in the pathway of protein translation initiation  <cit> . eif3g has been reported to associate with the cytoskeletal protein  <dig> r and with aif that induce apoptosis through inhibition of protein synthesis  <cit> .

a third pelo-interacting protein, srpx, was originally isolated as a suppressor of v-src transformation  <cit> . subsequent reports found that srpx induces apoptosis via a novel er-mediated pathway and suggest that this pathway might contribute to the suppression of tumor formation  <cit> .

various studies have shown that mrna, polysomes and different components of the protein synthesis machinery, such as aminoacyl-trna, eukaryotic initiation factors and elongation factors are associated with the cytoskeleton and that this association may influence the transport and translation of mrna  <cit> . therefore, binding of pelo to cytoskeleton-associated proteins may facilitate pelo to detect and degrade aberrant mrnas, at which the ribosome is stalled during translation.

pelo has an endonuclease activity that catalyzes the mrna cleavage near the stall site of the ribosome and subsequent degradation  <cit> . however, mutations inactivating the proposed endonuclease domain do not affect no-go decay . these results suggest that the proposed endonuclease activity of dom34/pelo is not required for mrna cleavage in ngd  <cit> . the interactions of pelo with components of the protein synthesis machinery and apoptosis raise the question whether pelo has a role in linking mrna and protein synthesis to apoptosis. several studies revealed an increase of mrna degradation during cell death. such increase of mrna degradation seems to be correlated very well with the inhibition of protein synthesis  <cit> . therefore, it is probable that mrna decay makes a significant contribution to the reduction in global protein synthesis during apoptosis  <cit> . the link between mrna decay and protein synthesis has been supported by the observation showing that the rnasel regulates mitochondrial mrna decay during apoptosis through its interaction with mitochondria initiation factor  <dig> . this interaction brings rnasel into close association with the mrna, where it can act as an endonuclease  <cit> . these observations lead us to suggest that the interaction of pelo with eif3g mediates the inhibition of protein synthesis during cell death by global mrna decay or by inhibiting translation initiation.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the experiments here have demonstrated that pelo is localized to actin cytoskeleton. yeast two-hybrid, gst pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation studies revealed that pelo interacts with hax <dig>  eif3g and srpx. these results were further confirmed by bifc assay showing that protein complexes resulting from the interactions between pelo and either hax <dig>  eif3g or srpx were mainly localized to cytoskeletal filaments.
