BACKGROUND
each year 300– <dig> million people suffer from malaria while  <dig>  to  <dig> million, mostly children, die as a result of the infection . the lethal form of human malaria is caused by the infection with the obligate intracellular protozoan parasite plasmodium falciparum, which displays a developmental life cycle alternating between a vertebrate and an invertebrate host. infection by the sporozoite form of the parasite occurs after the female anopheles mosquito's bite. the parasite then enters hepatocytes and multiplies by an asexual division process named schizogony. the resulting merozoites then invade erythrocytes and the parasite goes through a series of morphological changes upon massive rounds of asexual division . the intermittent fevers, characteristic of malaria infection, are attributed to cycles of erythrocyte invasion, asexual reproduction by schizogony, and release of asexual parasites  after rupture of infected red blood cells. for completion of the host-vector cycle, some intra-erythrocytic asexual forms do not undergo schizogony but transform into sexually dimorphic male and female gametocytes upon differentiation. gametocytes are taken into the mosquito's midgut during a blood meal and complete their sexual development to gametes which will fuse to form a motile zygote named the ookinete. the ookinete grows into an oocyst, dividing into numerous sporozoites that will invade the salivary glands of the mosquito ready for a new cycle of infection  <cit> .

during the complex life cycle of p. falciparum which takes place in both a vertebrate and an invertebrate host, the intracellular development of the different asexual and sexual stages proceeds through a dynamic and multistep process for which the parasite has evolved complex molecular strategies. several pioneering studies have previously demonstrated that transcriptional regulations are involved in the control of gene expression in the various p. falciparum life cycle forms  <cit> . the recent completion of the full genome sequence of p. falciparum has been useful in studying the global and complex gene expression patterns using microarrays and proteomic approaches. indeed, these studies suggested that there is a coordinated program of gene expression during the intra-erythrocytic development of the parasite. microarray data have revealed a sequential expression of transcripts in which messenger rnas involved in protein synthesis peak at first, followed by metabolism-related genes, then adhesion/invasion genes, and lastly protein kinases  <cit> . global proteome analysis of sporozoites, merozoites, trophozoites, and gametocytes using tandem mass spectrometry analysis have been used to show that many co-expressed proteins are encoded by genes that are clustered on certain chromosomes  <cit> . these recent studies on gene expression also show that transcription of multiple genes may be achieved by a single developmental induction event resulting in a cascade of gene expressions. this further suggests that only a few specific transcription factors may be required  <cit> . nevertheless, it has been established that the gene structure of p. falciparum is similar to that of other eukaryotes  <cit> , with the common features including the monocistronically transcribed genes, the presence of 5' and 3' untranslated regions, introns, promoter regions and probably the myriad of transcription factors that are involved in eukaryotic gene expression in general.

transcription in eukaryotic structural genes requires the assembly of rna polymerase ii  and the general transcription factors  on the promoter to form a pre-initiation complex. these basic factors include rna polymerase ii itself and at least six gtfs: tfiia, tfiib, tfiid, tfiie, tfiif and tfiih, most of which are themselves multiprotein complexes  <cit> . while the rna polymerase i, ii, iii and tata-binding protein  <cit>  have been described in p. falciparum, the elucidation of the mechanisms involved in transcriptional regulation in the parasite is still challenging. for example, the identification of orthologous proteins including the general transcription factors  involved in the rnap ii transcription machinery remains elusive. therefore, the composition and nature of the highly conserved general transcription factors associated with the rnap ii are presently unknown in p. falciparum. in contrast to most eukaryotic genomes, the extensive analysis of the p. falciparum genome has only revealed a few general transcription factors, like tbp and tfiib  <cit> . more recently, coulson et al.  <cit>  have utilized profile-hidden markov models  of transcriptional regulators and found a relatively low number of malarial transcription-associated proteins  including the general transcription factors associated with rnap ii. only tfiib, tfiieα and a few components of tfiih were identified in p. falciparum. in addition, no homolog of the rnap ii-associated tfiid complex, which is essential for the basal transcription in eukaryotes, was found, except the tata-binding protein   <cit> . therefore, it has been suggested that only a few specific transcription factors may be required for transcription regulation in the parasite. however, the parasite protein levels may also be primarily determined by posttranscriptional mechanisms  <cit> . the high proportion of orphans in the plasmodium genome relative to other organisms  suggests that the paucity of recognizable orthologous gtfs associated with rnap ii in p. falciparum may be explained in a different way. as orf, gene and function predictions have been performed in a similar way in plasmodium and in other sequenced genomes , two hypotheses can be raised. first, it is possible that the parasite proteins have structurally evolved beyond the point where they cannot be identified by simple similarity searches  <cit> . second, the extraordinary bias toward a+t richness  in nucleotide composition of the parasite, may introduce large changes in both dna and amino acid sequences which may affect the search procedures. this is particularly striking with an overall high a+t nucleotide content in protein-coding regions, leading to a remarkable bias toward the presence of stretches composed of a few amino acids only. therefore, it is likely that a substantial number of the unusually high proportion of malarial orphan proteins with no predictable function may actually correspond to «hidden» orthologues. interestingly, we and others  have observed that there is a strong selection against low complexity inserts within core secondary elements of secondary structures of p. falciparum proteins. the low complexity sequences are mostly located between two adjacent globular domains and only infrequently invade globular domains.

in the present study, we postulated that the hydrophobic cores of globular domains in functional proteins of p. falciparum should be largely conserved. consequently, these hydrophobic cores could be identified using appropriate tools involving the analysis of the secondary structure, which is often much more conserved than the primary structure  <cit> . we have developed and applied a two-dimensional approach of sequence analysis, called hydrophobic cluster analysis , which has been useful for the prediction of orthologous proteins in different eukaryotic lineages  <cit> . hca is based on the physico-chemical and topological properties underlying the fold of globular domains. it allows a direct access to the gravity centers of regular secondary structures . this information can be used to pick up hidden relationships within non-significant results provided by standard similarity search methods, based on literal approaches. indeed, the positions of hydrophobic clusters defined using hca, which distinguish from simple binary patterns, mainly correspond to those of regular secondary structures  <cit> . importantly, hca is not sensitive to gaps, even large, the handling of which is one of the main obstacles of conventional sequence comparison methods. the distribution of the secondary structures also indicates the limits of structured domains. this information can help the computational analysis, in particular for p. falciparum sequences for which low complexity regions often disturb standard similarity searches. using the hca methodology in combination with standard similarity search methods, we have explored the p. falciparum sequences for the presence of subunits of the basal transcription factors and cofactors associated with rna polymerase ii . our data suggested that several orphan proteins of p. falciparum can be predicted as general transcription factors involved in the parasite rnap ii transcription machinery.

RESULTS
we have collected protein sequences from the different subunits of the basal transcription factors and cofactors in different genomes. the homo sapiens and saccharomyces cerevisiae sequences used are listed in table  <dig>  these sequences were used as queries for psi-blast searches within the non-redundant database  at ncbi. this search leads to the construction of profiles specific to each protein or protein domain. all p. falciparum sequences predicted in this study are underlined in table  <dig> and shown in red in fig.  <dig>  several p. falciparum sequences were easily identified as significantly matching with some subunits of known basal transcription factors of the complex rnap ii machinery. it appears that only a few of these putative parasite transcription factors such as tfiib, tfiie-α and several components of tfiih, correspond to those reported elsewhere  <cit>  . however, in several cases, the two-dimensional analysis provided by hca led to extend the similarity outside of the limits initially reported by psi-blast . when no significant similarity was highlighted in the psi-blast data, marginal similarities  were investigated using hca. this led to the prediction of several hypothetical protein or orphans as novel, potential orthologous basal transcription factors and cofactors associated with the rnap ii machinery in p. falciparum  in table  <dig>  indicated in red in fig. 1).

the general transcription factors which were identified in this report are underlined and shown in bold; * and + indicate similarities which were identified in this report after assessing psi-blast marginal similarities at the sequence 2d level or after extending the comparison at the 2d level outside the limits primarily defined by psi-blast, respectively. the swiss-prot accession numbers are given for the human and yeast sequences. when a swiss-prot identifier is not available, the genbank identifier  is indicated in italics instead. the references of the human taf <dig> and taf <dig> sequences can be found in  <cit>  and  <cit> , respectively. $ : see text for comments on these putative homologues of cdk7/kin <dig> and cyclin h/ccl <dig>  the presence of nuclear localization sequences , nuclear export sequences , and the expression of these predicted general transcription factors using microarray and proteomics on different parasite stages  are indicated. g: gametocyte, t: trophozoite, lt: late trophozoite, sc: schizonte, r: ring, : absent, : present, : cannot be found.

in all cases with marginal similarities , the alignment with the candidate hypothetical protein has low expected e-values, proximal to the threshold value. these values are lower than those observed for alignments with other p. falciparum hypothetical proteins. however, other potential candidates  were carefully checked by hca for similarities that might be supported at the 2d level.

except one of the hypothetical proteins, all predicted proteins here as general transcription factors in p. falciparum have corresponding sequences in other plasmodium species , with identity levels above 50%. taf <dig> is the only exception as it is apparently not present in p. yoelii . this overall conservation provides support for the prediction of the p. falciparum hypothetical proteins listed in tables  <dig> and  <dig> as potential important components of the basic transcription machinery.

the general transcription factors predicted in this study are listed with the corresponding sequences in plasmodium yoelii yoelii, plasmodium chabaudii and plasmodium berghei. reciprocal searches were performed using each predicted transcription factor, leading to the finding of similarities with the corresponding subunit in the crown group eukaryotes ). the percentages of identity with the p. falciparum sequences are indicated , as well as the lengths of the considered protein sequences. $ : calculated on the similarity regions discussed in the text *: likely uncomplete sequence; °: presently corrected sequence; genomic: found in the genomic sequences, using tbastn.  <dig> . <dig> 

reciprocal searches were carried out for all the predicted gtf components. in most cases , these led to the retrieval, with significant e-values, of the corresponding sequences in other eukaryotes. the reciprocal searches were often conducted using as a probe the similarity region, excluding low complexity regions that are abundant in p. falciparum sequences. however, the profiles deduced from the p. falciparum sequences are generally less informative than those constructed using as probes the human or yeast sequences. as a consequence, such reciprocal searches resulted, in a few cases, in the retrieval of the corresponding sequences in other eukaryotes with marginal, but low expected e-values . it should be noticed that the sequences of another apicomplexan parasite, cryptosporidium parvum, often constituted the link between plasmodium and the crown group eukaryotes.

additional support for our predictions also comes from other data, such as the prediction of nuclear localisation and nuclear export signals , as well as the analysis of expression patterns . however, it should be mentioned that nuclear factors do not always require the presence of nls or nes for their targeting into the nucleus. for instance, it has recently been described that the nuclear transport of human taf <dig>  which lacks both nls and nes, is mediated by its interacting partners, which contain the nuclear targeting signals  <cit> .

throughout this study, we decided to designate the putative transcription factor, pftfiia for p. falciparum ortholog of higher eukaryote tfiia. the same nomenclature will be used for the other basal transcription factors and cofactors identified here.

pftfiia
the tfiia proteins form a ternary complex with tbp and dna. it stabilizes the tbp-dna binding and promotes the binding of tfiid complex to dna. yeast tfiia is composed of two subunits , which can each be divided in two parts, a n-terminal helical region and a beta-strand containing c-terminal region. the n-terminal regions of the two subunits form together a four-helix bundle, whereas the two c-terminal ones fold as a six-stranded beta-barrel contacting tbp-dna  <cit> . the human tfiia homologue is made of three polypeptide chainsα/β  and γ   <cit> .

the p. falciparum orthologous tfiia large subunit was easily identified using the yeast toa <dig> sequence. we found that the c-terminal part of this first subunit toa <dig> sequence  can be aligned with a significant psi-blast e-value  with the c-terminal part of the hypothetical protein mal7p <dig>  from p. falciparum . although no similarity was highlighted by psi-blast with the n-terminal part of the proteins, hca indicates the presence of large helices in the n-terminal part of the malarian protein, which can be aligned with those of the yeast and human sequences . this n-terminal sequence similarity could not be detected, even in the background noise, using the first  <dig> amino acids of either tfiia α  or mal7p <dig>  as queries in psi-blast searches. thus, the hca methodology allowed in this particular case to significantly extend the similarity between the human/yeast and malarian proteins over their whole lengths, suggesting that mal7p <dig>  can be predicted as the pftfiia large subunit. the amino acid region separating the n- and c-terminal parts is highly variable between species  <cit> . in the putative pf tfiia large subunit , this region between the n- and c-termini is shown to be smaller than in the yeast and human sequences .

using the sequence of the yeast small subunit toa <dig>  as query in a psi-blast search, no significant sequence similarity could be found with p. falciparum proteins derived from the whole genome databases at convergence by iteration  <dig>  however, a marginal similarity  was highlighted with the pfl2435w hypothetical sequence, over  <dig> amino acids . this similarity was supported at the 2d level using hca . it covers the n-terminal region as well as the two first strands of the c-terminal region. the third strand can be tentatively identified at the c-terminus of the p. falciparum sequence, when a large insertion is made between the second and third beta-strands. this large insertion likely corresponds to a globular sequence, as assessed by the presence of hydrophobic clusters. a large loop region also exists in this location in the human and yeast sequences, but was not observed in the solved corresponding three-dimensional structures. another marginal similarity was observed at similar level of expected-value in the psi-blast results with a hypothetical protein of p. yoelii . however, this hypothetical protein does not correspond to the pfl2435w homolog. instead, the py <dig> homolog in p. falciparum corresponds to the pfi1630c hypothetical protein . this similarity was however not detected by psi-blast because the pfi1630c sequence was incorrectly predicted . the corresponding alignment was also supported at the 2d level using hca . the pfi1630c hypothetical protein contains an n-terminal extension, relative to the human tfiia γ/yeast toa <dig> sequences. this suggests that two genes could exist as functional tfiia small subunits in plasmodium falciparum. multiple genes that encode general transcription factors have already been described for the tata-box binding protein  in several species  <cit>  and for tfiia α/β in humans  <cit> .

pftfiib
tfiib, which associates with tfiia, is the only putative general transcription factor  that was so far identified during the annotation of p. falciparum genome. it was confirmed by specific hmm searches performed by coulson et al.  <cit> .

pftfiid
evidence for the presence of some p. falciparum tbp-associated factors  involved in the multiprotein pftfiid complex
the tata-binding protein  and many tbp-associated factors  form the multimeric tfiid complex  <cit> . while tbp is sufficient for basal transcription in vitro, the taf subunits of tfiid are essential cofactors for transcriptional activation by providing interaction sites for activators. yeast tfiid contains  <dig> tafs and homologues of many of these tafs are found in metazoans . analysis of the architecture of yeast and metazoan tfiid revealed that more than half of the tafs contains a histone fold motif  . these hfds specifically assemble into five histone-like pairs.

while tbp was clearly identified in the p. falciparum genome , no orthologous tafs have been described so far from the genome sequence data of several apicomplexan parasites including several plasmodium species  <cit> , cryptosporidium parvum  <cit>  and t. gondii . this suggests that this taf detection failure cannot only be ascribed to the a+t richness of the genome. indeed, unlike plasmodium species, the other apicomplexan parasites do not display a bias toward a+t richness. instead, it is likely that the amino acid sequences of tafs in apicomplexan parasites reached a point of divergence that hinders their prediction using classical similarity searches. here, we searched for the presence in p. falciparum of each of these tafs, including those which contain histone fold motifs.

• pftaf <dig> 
in metazoan, the largest tfiid subunit has three enzymatic activities  and ubiquitin-activating and conjugating  activities) involved in transcriptional regulation . metazoan taf <dig> possess a pair of c-terminal bromo domains, which recognize acetylated histones. in yeast taf <dig>  which otherwise lacks kinase activity, these bromodomains are not present. instead, two interacting proteins bdf <dig> and bdf <dig> provide the missing enzymatic activity and functional domains. we focused our searches on the conserved domain of proteins of the taf <dig> family, which is critical for hat activity  <cit>  . we identified, by iteration  <dig>  a significant similarity with p. yoelii py <dig> , and by iteration  <dig> with p. falciparum pfl1645w  . these similarities were supported at the 2d level using hca . these two orthologous hypothetical proteins possess one bromo domain in their c-terminal parts. careful study of their hca plots led to define the limits of the conserved domain between aa  <dig> and  <dig> . clear hinge regions could also be identified. using this domain as query in psi-blast led to the identification of all members of the taf <dig> family by iteration  <dig>  no other protein from the p. falciparum genome data was identified, suggesting that pfl1645w might be the genuine taf <dig> ortholog.

• pftaf <dig> 
taf <dig> proteins have a non-specific aminopeptidase domain in their n-terminal parts. we therefore focused our searches on the c-terminal parts of the proteins. using psi-blast and the yeast taf <dig> c-terminal domain  as query, a significant hit appeared by iteration  <dig> with the p. yoelii py <dig> hypothetical protein , together with those relative to other metazoan taf <dig>  the identification of p. yoelii orthologous taf <dig> has been used to discover the p. falciparum taf <dig>  which is currently named in the annotated genome as the hypothetical protein mal7p <dig> . this sequence was scored with a significant e-value  by iteration  <dig> . this similarity is supported at the 2d level and concerns the region which is most conserved in the taf <dig> c-terminal domain amongst the different species. this suggests that the p. falciparum protein pinpointed here might be the taf <dig> ortholog in the parasite.

• pftaf <dig> 
taf <dig> proteins possess a conserved domain , located between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig>  or amino acids  <dig> and  <dig>   <cit> . using this domain as query in psi-blast led to the identification of significant similarities from the second iteration with both p. yoelii py <dig>  and p. falciparum pfi1425w  hypothetical proteins. this similarity, limited to the first part of the tafii <dig> protein conserved region , is supported at the 2d level . this similarity was also retrieved when scanning the pfam database . however, the globular domain of the p. falciparum proteins in which the tafii55-like region is included appears to be larger , and thus might share a similar length to the complete tafii <dig> protein conserved region. the region of similarity shared by p. falciparum pfi1425w and other taf <dig> was previously shown to be critical for interaction with the bromo domain factor bdf <dig> of yeast cells  <cit> .

• pftaf <dig> and the apparent lack of tafs assembling into histone-like pairs in p. falciparum
the histone fold domain , the core of which is characterized by three alpha-helices, is a fundamental interaction motif involved in heterodimerization of the core histone  and their assembly into a nucleosome octamer. this motif is thought to have arisen from the duplication of a minimal helix-extended-helix structure. the two middle helices of the duplicated structure would have fused to form a long, central helix. the histone fold domain can be accompanied by n- or c-terminal extensions, also made of alpha-helices and is found in several non-histone proteins, in addition to core histones  <cit> .

analysis of tfiid has shown that more than half of the tafs constituting this complex are hfd containing proteins . this led to the first hypothesis of a compact nucleosome-like octamer core in tfiid, which could bind dna and around which other tafs could associate  <cit>  . this proposal has however to be revisited in light of recent experimental data, highlighting a more complex situation than initially thought. first, irrespective to the nature of the quaternary structure , it has been shown that surface residues of core histones known to make critical contacts with dna in the nucleosome are generally not conserved in taf hfds  <cit> . this suggests an alternative role for hfd in tafs than dna binding. second, immunolabeling electron microscopy experiments have demonstrated that the hfd-containing tafs are located in three distinct substructures of tfiid, which are assembled by thin linker domains in a molecular clamp architecture  <cit> . the taf4/taf <dig> – taf6/taf <dig> assembly was shown to co-localize in one of the three lobes of native tfiid  <cit> . these structural data were supported and enriched by additional mapping of other tfiid functional sites  <cit> .

our searches for hfd-containing tafs in the plasmodium genome did not lead to the identification of any of the five histone-like pairs currently known in other eukaryotic species . these searches were performed using as queries the full-length sequences of yeast and human tafs, their hfds, and specific domains accompanying hfds ; the hfd  and the tafh sequence ; smart00549; aa  <dig> to 649)).

only one candidate for taf <dig> was retrieved in the plasmodium genome. the taf <dig> subunit in yeast, taf <dig>  heterodimerizes with taf <dig>  and taf <dig>   <cit> . it is one of the essential component common to tfiid and saga  <cit> . yeast taf <dig> was predicted to have a hfd, with which it can dimerize with its partner  <cit> . however, the presence of hfd in yeast taf <dig> has not yet been experimentally demonstrated. searching databases using the yeast taf <dig> sequence as a probe led to the identification by convergence of marginal similarities with the p. falciparum pfe1110w hypothetical protein . these similarities were supported at the 2d level . a reciprocal search yielded the taf <dig> proteins as the first hits above the threshold value.

taken together, our data strongly suggest the apparent and unexpected lack of hfd containing tafs in p. falciparum, except from taf <dig>  this taf however remains to be determined as a genuine hfd-containing factor in the parasite and also in the other eukaryotic cells.

other undetected tafs within the multiprotein pftfiid complex
• pftaf <dig> 
this protein, interacting with tfiifβ, contains wd <dig> repeats. we specifically limited our searches to the wd <dig> associated region in tfiid subunit , but these did not lead to the identification of potential taf <dig> candidates. we were thus unable to report the presence of a putative taf <dig> ortholog in p. falciparum.

• pftaf <dig> 
taf <dig>  named af <dig> in human and taf <dig> in yeast, is the only non-essential taf. it is also a component of tfiif in yeast. taf <dig> contains two globular domains, the n-terminal one belonging to the yeats family of domains, which are found in several proteins involved in chromatin modification and transcriptional regulation  <cit> . a yeats protein can be found in the p. falciparum mal8p <dig>  protein, described as a gas <dig> homologue. however, the p. falciparum mal8p <dig>  protein does not possess the c-terminal domain common to ytaf <dig> and haf <dig>  the similarity between the c-terminal domains of these proteins can be only detected using hca . however, the clusters typifying the architecture of the c-terminal taf <dig> domain are not found in mal8p <dig>  protein, suggesting that this protein may not correspond to a genuine pftaf <dig> 

pftfiie
tfiie is an heterotetramer composed of a large and a small subunit, referred as α / tfa <dig>  and / tfa <dig> , respectively  <cit> . a clear homologue of the tfiie α subunit, the mal7p <dig>  hypothetical sequence, was readily identified from the first iteration starting from human tfiie α sequence . this tfiie α homologue was also reported by coulson et al.  <cit>  and has recently been designated in sequence databases as the putative tfiie α-subunit. the n-terminal sequence pinpointed here is required for activation of basal transcription in vitro through interactions with tbp and pol ii  <cit> . this n-terminal sequence contains an extended winged helix domain  <cit>  followed by a zing finger  <cit> . most importantly, the analysis reported here led to extend the similarity between the human and p. falciparum proteins over a small c-terminal globular domain of tfiie α, as secondary structure similarities, supported by sequence identities, could be clearly identified . this similarity was not detected by psi-blast , even if only this small domain instead of the whole protein was used for similarity searches. the small acidic globular domain, for which no known fold could be predicted by threading procedures  , is absent in the yeast sequence, the c-terminal of which is likely unstructured  <cit> . this domain may thus be specific of higher eukaryotes and p. falciparum. this region binds directly to tfiih and has a stimulatory effect on basal transcription  <cit> .

no p. falciparum orthologue could be found for the second subunit of tfiie, named tfiie  in a first approach using as queries the human and yeast sequences in psi-blast searches. these two sequences display a low level of sequence identity , especially concentrated in the c-terminal segment. we adopted an iterative strategy, by using distant sequences of the family described in the psi-blast data and thereby discovered potential relationships with plasmodium proteins. hence, using the sequence of the hypothetical protein cnbi <dig> from cryptococcus neoformans, which shares 22% of sequence identity with the s. cerevisiae tfa <dig> over  <dig> amino acids , we found by iteration  <dig>  a significant similarity with the c-terminal fragment of a hypothetical sequence from p. yoelii . this relationship was supported at the 2d level , especially highlighting well conserved hydrophobic clusters common to distant members of the family . the corresponding sequence in p. falciparum, mal13p <dig> , was found by searching the predicted annotated proteins within plasmodb . the comparison of the whole set of sequences of the tfiie β subunit family revealed a region of variable length in the middle of the tfiie β domain. this region is particularly rich in cysteine residues in the proteins of apicomplexan parasites such as p. falciparum, p. yoelii and cryptosporidium .

pftfiif
tfiif, a tetramer of two subunits, named α  and β , is intimately associated with the rna polymerase ii enzyme  <cit> . the tfiif complex directly binds promoter dna, tfiib and the taf <dig> subunit of tfiid, and recruits tfiie and tfiih to the preinitiation complex  <cit> 

the β-subunit can be divided into two globular regions separated by a central, less structured region. the structures of these two globular domains have been solved in human rap <dig>  <cit> . the n-terminal domain is responsible for rap <dig> and tfiib binding  <cit> , and forms with the n-terminal domain of rap <dig> a triple barrel dimerization fold  <cit> . the c-terminal domain, containing a winged-helix  <cit> , binds non-specifically to dna  <cit> . using the human rap <dig> and yeast tfg <dig> sequences as queries in psi-blast, no significant similarities with p. falciparum proteins were detected at convergence by iteration  <dig>  however, marginal similarities were detected above the threshold value with the hypothetical pf11_ <dig> protein . these similarities were supported at the 2d level . some of the regular secondary structures constituting the core of the globular domains are particularly well conserved, whereas the region separating these domains appears less similar, as observed for other β subunits of different species. however, a good conservation was observed only for the strands beta- <dig>  beta- <dig> and beta- <dig> of the n-terminal domain, suggesting that the structure of the parasite protein may locally differ from that of human rap <dig> 

rap <dig>  also possesses two n- and c-terminal globular domains, separated by an unstructured linker sequence. as indicated above, the n-terminal domain, which is responsible for taf <dig> and rap <dig> binding, forms with the rap <dig> n-terminal domain a triple barrel dimerization fold  <cit> . the c-terminal domain, interacting with tfiib, fcp <dig> and dna, folds as a winged-helix  <cit> . we thus restricted our queries to these two domains, the limits of which were identified through hca . however, we found no significant similarity with any parasite proteins including several plasmodium species and cryptosporidum parvum. we also did not see any marginal similarity, which could be confirmed at the 2d level. given the single core structure that the two subunits form together, with three interwoven beta- barrels, it seems unlikely that the rap <dig> homolog exists alone in apicomplexan parasites. alternatively, either the rap <dig> subunit is too divergent to be detected using the available tools, including hca, or it does not really exist, suggesting the replacement of a α-β heterodimer by a β-β homodimer instead, given the similar architecture of the two subunits.

pftfiih
the general transcription factor tfiih is the largest and most complex of all. indeed, it is composed of nine subunits with molecular mass  similar to that of rna pii, with several subunits having enzymatic activities . tfiih has a dual action in both transcription initiation and nucleotide excision repair . it is organized into two structural and functional entities. the first of these, the tfiih core, includes four polypeptides  and the xeroderma pigmentosum b  helicase. the second functional entity, the cdk-activating kinase  complex, is composed of the cyclin-dependent kinase cdk <dig>  cyclin h and mat <dig>  the xpd  helicase bridges the two complexes, being associated either with the core or cak. in addition to this, a new subunit of the tfiih core, tfb <dig>  has recently been discovered, associated in humans with dna repair-deficient trichothiodystrophy  <cit> .

tfiih is the most thoroughly documented complex in plasmodium falciparum. indeed, five out of six core subunits  can easily been identified using profile-based searches. the xpd  helicase and components of the cak complex  <cit>  were also identified . however, no direct homologue of cdk <dig> and cyclin h, sharing a high level of sequence identity with the human and yeast counterparts, was identified. nevertheless, several cdk <dig> and cyclin h putative homologs with lower identity values can be identified. however, their exact nature remains to be determined. coulson et al.  <cit>  noticed the presence of a cyclin k homolog , which was shown to be associated with rnap ii  <cit> . we focused our searches on the missing p62/tfb <dig> subunit, which possesses two copies of a bsd domain  <cit>  and was recently shown to possess in its n-terminus a domain with a ph fold  <cit> . plasmodium sequences marginal similarities were detected by searching databases using the human p <dig> as query. the sequence alignments display e-values of  <dig>  with plasmodium yoelii py <dig> and  <dig> with plasmodium falciparum mal3p <dig> . the corresponding similarities were supported at the 2d level . the similarities with these plasmodium sequences were found to be significant when the yeast tfb <dig> sequence was used instead as query . most of the similarities were focused on the bsd domains , but longer alignments within the c-terminal part of the sequences were also observed. these c-terminal alignments were also supported at the 2d level, as illustrated in fig.  <dig> panel c, and include sequences which are predicted to form long helical structures. finally, hca suggests that the n-terminal sequence of p62/tfb <dig>  corresponding to the ph domain  <cit> , might also be aligned with the plasmodium sequences, although this relationship was not highlighted using psi-blast .

only a few components of the general transcription machinery have been identified to date in p. falciparum  <cit> . of the  <dig> general transcription factors listed in table  <dig>  only one third  were predicted from simple similarity searches  <cit>  and previous analysis  <cit> . this percentage may reflect the poor proportion of gene with automatically predicted function in the complete parasite genome  <cit> . hence, the tata binding protein or tbp is the only known component of the tfiid complex, which has been identified. the multicomplex tfiid remains however essential for accurate and higher transcription levels in eukaryotic cells. therefore, the paucity of both defined malarial tfiid orthologous components and of general transcriptional factors, contrasts significantly with the situation reported for the crown group eukaryotes, in which tfiid is well conserved even though some differences can be seen for transcription cofactor complexes. here, the use of the sensitive hydrophobic cluster analysis  in combination with profile-based search methods suggests that the genome of p. falciparum contains several gene products annotated as hypothetical proteins, which can be predicted as putative general transcription factors  associated with rnap ii. these include several members of tfiid even if most of the taf containing histone fold domains  remain undetected using the sensitive hydrophobic cluster analysis . nine other gtfs were predicted in this way, which brings the total number of predicted subunits of the general transcription machinery to approximately 60% that of the number observed in the crown group eukaryotes.

the lack of detection of several gtfs in the parasite using conventional methods for sequence similarity searches could be ascribed to a higher divergence of these proteins, as well as to the bias introduced in the searches by the overall high a+t nucleotide content. the apparent divergence between plasmodium gtfs relative to their orthologs in free-living organisms is consistent with the observation previously reported by coulson et al.  <cit> . these authors have noticed that transcription-associated proteins family taxon specificity appeared to correlate with evolutionary distance and not cellular complexity. on the other hand, plasmodium sequences are very difficult to analyze due to a particular amino acid bias, reflecting the overall high a+t nucleotide content. this results in unusually high proportions of asparagine and lysine, and to a lesser extent also of isoleucine and tyrosine, which are all encoded by at-rich codons. this abundance contrasts with a relative paucity in arginine, alanine, proline and glycine, encoded by gc-rich codons . however, part of the most abundant amino acids, asparagine and lysine, is located within the low complexity regions that are often located outside functional domains . when we evaluated the presence of the hydrophobic core forming amino acids  which are crucial for fold stability, the p. falciparum proteome is similar to the other organisms for the frequencies of phenylalanine, methionine and tryptophane. in addition, there is a nearly perfect balance between valine, leucine and isoleucine, which are chemically related and often interchangeable at the structural level. the last amino acid of the hydrophobic class, tyrosine, is the most coil-forming residue of this class  <cit>  and the increase of its frequency in p. falciparum may actually not affect the general balance of domain hydrophobic cores. the high frequency of lysine, which is on average the most exposed amino acid in globular domains  <cit> , might be balanced by those of arginine and alanine. within the third class , the low frequencies of proline and glycine, which have on average a similar behavior relative to α, β and coil states  <cit> , might be together compensated by the considerable high frequency of asparagine residues. asparagine immediately after glycine, shares with it the ability to adopt left-handed helical local conformations, widely represented in coil regions. thus, the conservation of the total proportion of hydrophobic amino acids in p. falciparum, and the compensative behavior of other amino acid couples, gives evidence for the conservation of hydrophobic cores of functional domains. this also suggests that an appropriate delineation of these domains through hca, and their specific use for sequence similarity searches, can lead to the finding of significant relationships within proteins, which otherwise remain orphan if their sequences are analyzed as a whole. the development of an automatic procedure allowing a fast prediction of the structured domain boundaries can help to apply such a strategy at the genome-scale level .

a first original feature in the p. falciparum predicted gtf sequences is the presence of two genes candidates for the tfiia small subunit. the presence of two genes has already been described for some gtfs. indeed, tbp-like proteins are found in a. thaliana, d. melanogaster and h. sapiens  <cit> . moreover, a functional homolog of tfiia α/β subunit, which is expressed almost exclusively in testis, has been described  <cit> . this multiplicity of gtfs is thought to contribute to tissue- and gene-specific regulation. it is therefore possible that the gene candidates for the tfiia small subunit in p. falciparum are stage-specifically expressed in the parasite life cycle.

another striking observation is that, among the gtfs associated with rnap ii predicted here, no hfd-containing tafs could be identified, except for the putative ortholog of taf <dig>  which was reported by gangloff and colleagues  <cit>  as containing a potential hfd. however, the potential hfd of taf <dig> might correspond to a distant member of the hfd family and remains to be experimentally proven. on the other hand, taf <dig> is the only "hfd" protein which is shared by tfiid and saga  <cit> . it is interesting to note the apparent lack of taf <dig> candidate in p. yoelii , suggesting that this protein might not be essential in all plasmodium species. this may be consistent with the apparent absence of other hfd-containing tafs in all plasmodium species. the apparent absence of canonical hfd tafs leads to the hypothesis of a higher divergence of proteins of the hfd family in the plasmodium genome than that of other proteins, beyond the point where they can be identified using homology searches, even the most sensitive of them. alternatively, if the absence of hfd containing tafs is confirmed, this will provide evidence for a striking difference in the quaternary structure of tfiid by comparison to the yeast or human complexes. the latter display a similar architecture, formed by three lobes organized into a molecular clamp  <cit> . experimental investigations are needed to further explore this hypothesis. to date, the only plasmodium proteins with hfd domains listed in the histone database  <cit>  corresponds to classic nucleosomal histones h2a, h2b, h <dig> and h <dig>  the linker histone h <dig> is not found  <cit> . this suggests that the apparent absence of histone fold proteins in plasmodium is not only restricted to the taf proteins of tfiid complex.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have shown that more general transcription factors can be predicted in the genome of p. falciparum than initially thought. it can be anticipated that the hca method can also be an additional and important tool for the finding of new orthologs amongst the high proportion of hypothetical proteins or orphans in p. falciparum and other apicomplexan parasites such as cryptosporidium parvum, eimeria and toxoplasma gondii. virtually nothing is known about transcription regulation in these apicomplexan parasites. to our knowledge, this study describes for the first time the prediction of general transcription factors in the genome of p. falciparum using a sensitive predictive method based on secondary structure considerations . based on the gtf orthologs predicted here, there are some differences in the composition, and probably in the nature of some multicomplex factors, as illustrated by the possible absence of hfd containing tafs in the tfiid complex. the identification of novel transcription elements and understanding how the basal transcription differs in the parasite may be exploited to design selective therapeutic agents against p. falciparum. additionally, further elucidation of mechanisms controlling transcriptional expression in protozoa may provide a unique perspective on how these systems evolved in early eukaryotic cells.
