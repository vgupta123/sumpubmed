BACKGROUND
extensive genome sequencing and genetic mapping studies have been performed on members of the brassicaceae family which contains the most widely studied model species, arabidopsis thaliana  and many economically important vegetable and oilseed crops belonging to the genus brassica. an avowed goal of structural and functional genomics of at is to develop improved strategies for precision breeding of crop plants related to the model species. since the genome size of brassica species   <cit>  is much larger than that of at , there is a high probability that novel gene interactions have evolved in the brassicas through the processes of sub-functionalization and/or neo-functionalization of paralogs  <cit> . comparative mapping between at and brassica species, coupled with the base knowledge of mutation-based functional analysis in at and qtl mapping in crop brassicas, could greatly contribute towards a better understanding of the genetic architecture for the conserved as well as the evolved traits of agronomic value in the brassicaceae.

the three diploid brassica species, b. rapa , b. nigra  and b. oleracea  and the two allopolyploids, b. napus  and b. juncea , have been subjected to extensive genetic mapping using molecular markers to identify loci associated with various qualitative and quantitative traits of agronomic interest  <cit> . some of the mapped quantitative traits like pod size, pod number, pod density, seed size, seed number per pod and oil content are of great importance in improving the yield of the oilseed brassica species  <cit> .

recent attempts to develop a unified comparative genomics system in the brassicaceae has recognized the existence of  <dig> conserved genomic blocks  <cit>  which is an extension of  <dig> syntenic blocks identified in b. napus in an earlier study  <cit> . comparative mapping studies between members of family brassicaceae  <cit> , at and arabidopsis lyrata  <cit> , at and capsella rubella  <cit>  and the identification of an ancestral karyotype   <cit>  have also stimulated interest in the evolutionary processes involved in the diversification of different lineages in the brassicaceae and variations in chromosome number of different species vis-à-vis their ploidy status. most of the earlier studies on comparative mapping in brassica species  <cit>  have relied on the use of rflp markers. however, the deployment of rflp markers in large segregating populations is a rather cumbersome and laborious process. in recent years, several studies have highlighted the immense potential of polymorphisms in intron sequences for the development of markers for genetic mapping  <cit> .

in the present study, we have successfully used pcr-based intron polymorphism  markers for the development of a comparative map between b. juncea, related brassica species  and at. we also analyzed the segmental structure of the a and b genomes of b. juncea in terms of the  <dig> genomic blocks  proposed earlier  <cit> . we compared colinearity of the b. juncea and at genomes and also analyzed synteny between the a, b and c genomes of the brassica species. additionally, homoeologous linkage groups of the three genomes were identified. on the basis of homoeology among the three genomes, we propose a re-designation of the b genome linkage groups assigned earlier for b. nigra  <cit>  and b. juncea  <cit> . the comparative map between b. juncea and at developed in this study, in conjunction with the extensive information available from functional genomics studies of the at genome, will greatly facilitate the identification of candidate genes and novel gene interactions responsible for the domestication and evolution of the yield influencing traits in b. juncea and other crop brassicas.

RESULTS
comparative map of b. juncea and arabidopsis thaliana  using intron polymorphism  markers
single copy genes from arabidopsis   <cit> , physically located at an approximate distance of 100– <dig> kb, were used to design pcr primers spanning intronic sequences. in cases where large genomic regions were devoid of single copy genes, primers were designed from multiple copy genes. primers for pcr amplification were designed from exon sequences which showed strong nucleotide conservation between at and the corresponding est or gss sequences described for any brassica species  <cit> .

of the  <dig> primer pairs thus designed,  <dig>  showed polymorphism between the b. juncea lines, heera and varuna, parents of the dh mapping population used in this study and in the earlier mapping studies on b. juncea  <cit> . genotyping using the  <dig> polymorphic primer pairs  generated  <dig> loci in b. juncea of which 67% were scored as co-dominant markers and the remaining 33% were scored as dominant markers. these  <dig> loci were incorporated into the framework map developed by pradhan et al.  <cit> . additionally  <dig> rflp markers placed earlier on the b. juncea map  <cit>  were assigned corresponding at loci by subjecting the available sequence data to ncbi blastn search and identifying the most significant blastn hit as the source at gene. a linkage map of b. juncea consisting of  <dig> at loci  and covering a total genetic length of  <dig>  cm is shown in figure  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  the ten a genome linkage groups  of the b. juncea map were designated a1–a <dig> and correspond to the n1–n <dig> linkage groups of b. napus  <cit> . the remaining eight b genome lgs were designated b1–b <dig> based on homoeology between the a, b and c genomes as determined in the present study. the corresponding linkage group nomenclature proposed earlier for the b. nigra genome   <cit>  and the b genome of b. juncea   <cit>  is also given in parentheses in figure  <dig>   <dig> and table  <dig> 

the figures in the parentheses are the corresponding lgs of b. juncea and b. napus  <cit>  for the a genome and the corresponding lgs of b. juncea and b. nigra  <cit>  for the b genome.

the  <dig> at loci mapped with variable frequencies to all the  <dig> linkage groups of b. juncea . linkage group a <dig> contained the highest number of markers  while b <dig> had the least with only  <dig> markers. overall, 63% of the markers mapped to the a genome  at an average marker density of  <dig>  and average marker interval of  <dig>  cm . the b genome  contained the remaining 37% of the markers with a marker density of  <dig>  at an average marker interval of  <dig>  cm, indicating that there is less polymorphism in the b genome as compared to the a genome in the intronic regions. as a result a number of unmapped islands were found in the b genome  .

an uneven distribution of at loci originating from each arabidopsis chromosome was observed in the genome of b. juncea. among the  <dig> lgs of the a genome , all the linkage groups except a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> contained at loci from each of the five arabidopsis chromosomes . a <dig> and a <dig> were devoid of loci from at c <dig> and at c <dig> respectively. a <dig> did not contain any locus from at c <dig> and at c <dig>  the linkage group a <dig> was composed of markers from at c <dig> and at c <dig> while a <dig> was composed of markers from at c <dig> and at c <dig> . linkage group a <dig> was found to be the most chimeric linkage group consisting of  <dig> genomic blocks followed by a <dig> with  <dig> blocks. linkage group a <dig> was least chimeric with only  <dig> blocks followed by a <dig> with  <dig> blocks and a <dig> and a <dig> with  <dig> blocks each. the simplest genomic organization was observed in linkage groups a <dig> , a <dig> , a <dig>  and a <dig> . uneven distribution of the at loci was also observed in the b genome  of b. juncea of which linkage groups b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> contained loci derived from all the five chromosomes of arabidopsis .

the organization of the b. juncea linkage map with respect to the at genome was also studied on the basis of the distribution of  <dig> genomic blocks  described for a hypothetical ancestor of the at and brassica lineages by schranz et al.  <cit> . this approach facilitated the identification of conserved blocks between at and b. juncea. a conserved block was defined as a region that contained at least two at loci from the same block region. in some instances, a block was recognized even with a single mapped marker if one or more markers of the same block were found mapping at the corresponding region in earlier maps for the a and b genomes  <cit> . using this criteria, a total of  <dig> genomic blocks were identified in the a genome of b. juncea with an average of  <dig>  paralogous blocks for each block recognized in the hypothetical ancestral species . as compared to the a genome, we identified a lesser number of blocks  in the b genome . among the  <dig> blocks identified in the b genome of b. juncea, the larger blocks viz. e, f, j, r and u were observed to be represented by three paralogous blocks within the b genome .

comparative block arrangement in the a genomes of b. juncea and b. napus
the a genome of b. juncea  was compared with the a genome of b. napus  <cit>  based on the arrangement of the  <dig> genomic blocks. for comparison, all the rflp markers mapped on b. napus were converted to corresponding at loci based on the information available in the supplementary table s <dig> of parkin et al.  <cit>  and assigned to different blocks  . the comparative block arrangement in the a genomes of b. juncea and b. napus has been shown in figure 6a.

in terms of the arrangement of the blocks, the a genomes of both b. juncea and b. napus were essentially collinear. we identified five new blocks  in the a genome of b. juncea which were not detected in the corresponding a genome lgs of b. napus . all these new blocks were identified in regions with a reasonably high density of ip markers. additionally, we also established the presence of some blocks   in the a genome of both b. juncea and b. napus which were not designated earlier in b. napus by schranz et al.  <cit> . block status to these regions were assigned as we observed the presence of at loci from these blocks not only in the homoeologous lgs of the a and c genomes of b. napus  <cit>  but also in the corresponding lgs of the a genome of b. juncea in the present study . blocks l, w and x observed in the linkage groups n <dig>  n <dig> and n <dig> of b. napus  could not be detected in the homoeologous a genome lgs of b. juncea in the present study. this, in all probability, is due to the absence of ip markers representing these blocks in the map. these regions show up as large gaps in the map shown in figure  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> 

potential centromeric regions were predicted in the linkage groups a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> of b. juncea based on the non-rearranged blocks that flank the centromere in ak and at as proposed by schranz et al.  <cit> . the i-j non-rearranged blocks in a <dig> represent the conserved centromeric regions between the brassica species and ak, while the g-h non-rearranged blocks in a <dig> represent the conserved centromeric regions between the brassica species, ak and at. similar centromeric regions were predicted for the corresponding n <dig> and n <dig> lgs of b. napus  <cit> . in a <dig> and a <dig> of b. juncea, alternate centromere sites could also be predicted  due to the presence of mapped markers corresponding to the pericentromeric regions in at. in n <dig> of b. napus, a conserved centromere was predicted between the j-i blocks  <cit> . however, our mapping data on b. juncea suggests that the centromeric region is present between the g-h blocks. all the five markers representing the g-h blocks in a <dig> were derived from the pericentromeric region of at c <dig> . moreover, a <dig> shared the block arrangement of f-g-h with the ancestral karyotype   <cit>  unlike in at where the f and g-h blocks are located on different chromosomes. the possibility of a centromere between the j and i blocks in a <dig> is further weakened by the fact that the orientation of the j block is inverted with respect to the i block in a <dig> of b. juncea which is otherwise non-rearranged in ak  <cit> . in n <dig> of b. napus, a centromere is predicted between the b-c blocks  <cit> . based on the presence of several markers from the pericentromeric region between the j and i blocks in a <dig> of b. juncea, an alternate probable site of the centromere has been predicted in this linkage group.

comparative block arrangement in the b genomes of b. juncea and b. nigra vis-à-vis at
comparative organization of the a genomes of b. juncea and b. napus  based on the block boundaries defined by schranz et al.  <cit>  confirmed that the set of  <dig> genomic blocks  can be used to delineate the genomic organization of brassica genomes. the same block definition was therefore used to study the segmental organization of the b genome of b. juncea. the segmental structure of the b genome  of b. juncea in relation to the at genome is represented schematically in figure  <dig>   <dig>  since our study allows for a detailed gene-to-gene alignment between the b genome of brassica and at which has not been reported earlier, the description of the genomic organization of the eight linkage groups  with respect to at is described in detail below.

b <dig> : b <dig> predominantly consists of two long stretches of collinear genes from at c <dig> , one each at the two ends of the linkage group. the two f blocks constitute about 62% of the total mapped area. the colinearity of gene order in comparison with at is suggestive of at least one inversion each in both the f blocks signifying that inversions occurred prior to the diversification of the two blocks. the orientations of the f blocks are inverted with respect to each other. the presence of duplicated f blocks on a single linkage group appears to be a unique feature of the b. nigra genome and has not been observed in the a and c genomes. the middle segment of b <dig>  has markers from block q  and block d .

b <dig> : this lg consists of four blocks, e-m-r-u, with the e block  constituting 20% of the top segment and the u block  constituting 54% of the lower segment of this linkage group. except for minor rearrangements, the gene order in the u block is highly collinear with its corresponding at c <dig> region. these rearrangements also explain the presence of markers from the adjacent r and m blocks in this region.

b <dig> : b <dig> is constituted of blocks n-m-o-p-j-w-r. blocks n and m, constituting the top segment of b <dig>  share colinearity of gene order with their counterparts in at. blocks o and p harbour at least one inversion each which explains the break in colinearity of the gene order as compared with at. the middle segment of b <dig> is represented by block j . a minimum of two inversions within the j block could have resulted in the reshuffling of gene markers as compared with at. blocks r and w constitute the terminal region of b <dig>  a mixture of markers from at c <dig>  at c <dig> and at c <dig> is seen between the j and w blocks. three of these markers viz. at3g <dig>  at4g07666b and at4g <dig> belong to blocks m and p. their placement between the j and w blocks could be a consequence of the inversions described above.

b <dig> : b <dig> consists of small collinear stretches contributed by all the five chromosomes of at. the block order is represented by e-t-n-a-j, with an x block insertion within the j block. the top of the lg is made up by blocks e, t and n. the arrangement of the genes in the n block is suggestive of rearrangements within the block.

b <dig> : this linkage group consists of two major blocks: f, constituting 30% and j contributing 12% of the total mapped area. the gene order in these two blocks are collinear with the f and j blocks of at.

b <dig> : about 70% of the total mapped area in the lower part of the b <dig> linkage group is made up of blocks from at c <dig> in the order c-b-a-d. the upper part of the linkage group shows the presence of the k block from at c <dig> while the remaining portions above the k block could not be assigned to any syntenous block as no at loci could be mapped to this region.

b <dig> : this lg consists predominantly of gene markers from at c <dig>  representing ~53% of the mapped area. the block order is a-b-u-a-e-h. the distribution of the at c <dig> specific markers is suggestive of the presence of three large collinear regions separated by large gaps and constituting the top, middle and terminal segments of b <dig>  the top portion of this lg comprises of an a block harboring a minimum of one inversion breaking its colinearity with its counterpart in at. the middle segment is formed by a collinear stretch of genes belonging to the b and u blocks. the terminal segment of b <dig> comprises another a block followed by a long stretch of genes belonging to block e. the gene order in this block indicates two inversions since its divergence from at.

b <dig> : this is a highly chimeric linkage group comprising nine blocks  with loci derived from all the five chromosomes of at. the terminal segment of the linkage group is consists of a u block from at c <dig> with insertions from the n and q blocks. the gene order of at loci in this block revealed the presence of two sub-blocks ordered in opposite orientations. this break in colinearity can be explained by at least one major inversion which would also explain the appearance of two regions harboring markers from the q block. the middle portion of this lg is formed of a large collinear region from at c <dig> . above the r-w block, there is a contiguous stretch of markers derived from blocks g, h and i. this contiguous block arrangement, g-h-i, is observed in at c <dig> whereas it is shared between linkage groups  <dig>  and  <dig>  in ak with a predicted centromere between the g and h blocks in both at and ak  <cit> . on the basis of the foregoing, a conserved region constituting the centromere could be predicted between the g and h blocks in b <dig> 

lagercrantz  <cit>  reported a comparative map in b. nigra by mapping  <dig> rflp loci generated from  <dig> at dna fragments. to compare the block arrangement in the b genome of b. juncea with its diploid progenitor b. nigra, the rflp loci of the b. nigra map, wherever possible, were converted to orthologous at loci and assigned to different blocks  . for the conversion, the rflp probes whose genbank sequences could be retrieved, were subjected to ncbi blastn search to assign the best corresponding homologous at loci. for the other rflp probes  in the b genome of b. juncea which were not detected in the earlier study. conversely, we also identified some blocks in the b. nigra map  <cit>   which could not be identified in the b genome of b. juncea in this study . these discrepancies in block arrangements between the two maps could be due to a limited coverage of at loci in the b genome of b. juncea  and our inability to convert some of the at rflp loci described earlier  <cit>  in the b. nigra map. further saturation of the b genome map would facilitate greater accuracy in assigning block status to these regions found to be different between the two genomes. among the different blocks identified in the b genome, f, j, r and u were the major blocks with the maximum coverage. these were represented as three homoeologous blocks in both the maps. a similar triplication for three of these blocks  was also reported in the previous study by lagercrantz  <cit> .

identification of homoeology between the a, b and c genomes of brassica species
considerable homoeology has been reported between the lgs of the a and c genomes  <cit> . with the mapping information for the b genome derived from the present study, we were able to compare the block-based architecture of the lgs of the three diploid brassicas to understand the extent of homoeology shared between the three genomes. this analysis provided insights into the prominent rearrangements that shaped the three genomes and also identified those ancestral blocks which remained unaltered in all the three diploid brassica genomes. for this comparative study, the rflp loci of the c genome of b. napus  <cit>  were converted to their corresponding at loci . figure  <dig> provides an overall view of the homoeology between the three genomes.

the comparative map of the a , b  and c  genomes of brassica  is based on the consensus block arrangements identified in the comparative map of the a genome of b. juncea  and b. napus  reported earlier  <cit> , b genome of b. juncea  and b. nigra  reported earlier  <cit>  and c genome of b. napus   <cit> . this comparative analysis shows that all the linkage groups of the c genome except n <dig> and n <dig>  <cit>  correspond to lgs of the a genome based on the extent of the homoeology between them. hence, we propose that n <dig> and n <dig> should be designated as c <dig> and c <dig> respectively . based on the homoeology observed among the a, b and c genomes in our study, a similar nomenclature is proposed for the b genome . this homoeology-based designation will enable greater accuracy and uniformity in the international nomenclature of the three diploid progenitor genomes.

all the linkage groups belonging to the three diploid brassica species could be divided into ten categories or groups  based on the extent of homoeology between them . group  <dig> consists of a1/b1–b2/c <dig>  a <dig> was entirely homoeologous to c <dig>  both being constituted by the block arrangement f-t-u. the f-t-u arrangement was specific to the rapa/oleracea lineage. interestingly, this f-t-u arrangement was found repeated in both the a  and the c  genomes  but was absent from the b genome. the linkage group b <dig> shared the f block with a1/c <dig> in group <dig>  due to the presence of two f blocks in b <dig>  this linkage group also had homoeology with group  <dig>  b <dig>  which shared the u block with a <dig> and c <dig>  could also be placed in this group. in group  <dig> , a <dig> and c <dig> were completely homoeologous, while b <dig> showed homoeology with a <dig> and c <dig> for the block motifs r-w-e-o-p. one inversion in b <dig> could explain the separation of the e block from the r-w block combination . group  <dig>  members shared the common block arrangement r-w-j-i-p-o. b <dig> was almost entirely composed of this block arrangement, while an additional f-t-u block was present in a <dig> and c <dig>  members of group  <dig>  shared the block motif j-i-s-n-t. a <dig> and b <dig> appeared to be homoeologous along their entire length, while c <dig> had acquired an additional j block. the presence of two j blocks in c <dig> was a c genome-specific rearrangement. due to the presence of an additional j block, c <dig> has also been placed in group  <dig>  in group  <dig> , a <dig> and b <dig> were homoeologous along their entire length sharing the block motif j-c-f. c <dig> shared partial homoeology  with a <dig> and b <dig>  the terminal j block present in a <dig> and b <dig> was however absent in c <dig>  in group  <dig> , a <dig> and b <dig> were homoeologous along their entire length sharing the block arrangement c-b-a-v-k-l-q. one inversion in either of the two genomes could explain the reverse orientation of the blocks constituting the lower segment of a6–b <dig> . two c genome lgs  are also components of this group. c <dig> shared the a-b-c block arrangement with a6/b <dig> while c <dig> was homoeologous for the block arrangement v-k-l-q with a6/b <dig>  members of group  <dig>  shared homoeology for a large e block while group  <dig>  members were homoeologous for blocks a-b-u. group  <dig>  had a <dig> sharing homoeology with c <dig> for the blocks o-q-x-h-d-v which constituted the top half of both the linkage groups. the lower segment of a <dig> shared the block arrangement n-i-h-a with c <dig>  no lg from the b genome seemed to possess any major block homoeologous with a <dig>  members of group  <dig>  shared the blocks r-w which constituted a major portion of the linkage group in all the three genomes.

karyotype changes that led to the divergence of a, b and c genomes of brassica species
the identification of homoeologous chromosomes among the three genomes of brassica sp.  in the present study allows us to predict the possible, macro-level karyotype changes that led to the divergence of the a, b and c genomes. it has been predicted that the nigra  and the rapa/oleracea  lineages separated from each other about  <dig>  mya  <cit>  followed by the splitting of the rapa and oleracea lineages. three linkage groups of the b genome  have retained similar block organization as their corresponding a genome lgs . for the remaining five b genome chromosomes , we propose two types of changes:  rearrangements without any change in the chromosome number: blocks constituting four lgs of the a/c genome  could be reshuffled to explain the block arrangement in four lgs in the b genome  . no reduction in chromosome number seems to have taken place here. in the process however, both the f-t-u block motifs of the a/c genome lost their identity in the b genome while a unique lg with two f blocks emerged in the b genome.  rearrangements with variations in chromosome number: the genomic block arrangement of b <dig> could be derived by fusing two linkage groups from the a/c  genome . this also explains the difference of one lg between the a/c and b genomes.

a high level of similarity between the a and c genomes was established in earlier studies  <cit> . however, it was not clear whether the changes that were observed between the two occurred in one of the lineages after their divergence or occurred independently in both the lineages. the similar organization of a1–c <dig>  a2–c <dig>  a3–c <dig> and a7–c <dig> lgs of the a and c genomes  indicated the absence of any structural changes in these chromosomes after the divergence of the a and c genomes. we therefore predict the following types of changes in the evolution of the a and c genomes:  rearrangements related to the c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> chromosomes are specific to the c genome  and occurred after the diversification of the a and c genomes since the corresponding lgs of the a and b genomes are identical . these changes, mainly translocations, break the homoeology between the a and c genomes . the remaining two lgs  appear to be made up of rearranged blocks constituting three lgs of the rapa genome . the block arrangement of c <dig> can be achieved by fusing half of a <dig> with almost the entire a <dig> lg. similarly, the other half of a <dig> and the entire a <dig> represent the block arrangement of the c <dig> chromosome . these rearrangements would have contributed to the difference of one chromosome between the a and c genomes.

discussion
in this study, we generated a detailed comparative map between b. juncea and arabidopsis thaliana containing  <dig> at loci including  <dig> ip markers. although exons of at and brassica species share around 75–90% homology  <cit> , tapping polymorphism available in the intronic sequences is an efficient method to generate pcr-based markers from otherwise highly conserved genes. thirty two percent of the primers designed in this study were found to be polymorphic between the b. juncea lines, varuna and heera, used as parents of the mapping population. screening the amplified fragments for snps could lead to a further increase in the number of polymorphic loci. previous reports on comparative analysis between at and brassica species have been based mostly on rflp probes  <cit> . screening large segregating populations with rflp markers is rather cumbersome. in contrast, the polymorphisms obtained using ip markers were easily discernable on simple  <dig> – <dig> % agarose gels and would therefore enable rapid screening of large segregating populations. additionally, being genic in origin, ip marker-based genetic maps would directly reflect the syntenic relationship between the two species, b. juncea and at. since the ip markers used in this study were designed from conserved sequences between at exons and available brassica est/gss sequences, they also possess enormous potential for wider applicability across various brassica species. as the at genome is partially duplicated  <cit> , the use of multicopy at loci to establish syntenic relationships in other species would raise issues of paralogy and orthology. in contrast, analyzing the distribution of at singletons in brassica would give an unambiguous representation of various rearrangements that have occurred between the two lineages since their divergence. the major emphasis in this study was therefore on generating ip pcr primers predominantly from single copy loci in arabidopsis. our genomic block definitions were based mostly on at singletons in contrast to earlier studies  <cit> . irrespective of the approach used to define synteny, the number of times each block is represented in the a genome of b. juncea was found to be highly similar to that observed for b. napus. this observation supports the earlier hypothesis which advocated the occurrence of duplications in the arabidopsis genome prior to its divergence from the brassica lineage  <cit> .

in the present study, we analyzed the segmental organization of the b. juncea genome based on the  <dig> conserved genomic blocks described by schranz et al.  <cit> . these blocks represent the conserved regions common to the ak, at and b. rapa  <cit> . block order obtained for b. juncea in this study was compared with the available maps for the a and c constituent genomes of b. napus  <cit>  and the b genome of b. nigra  <cit> . a high level of conserved macro-level colinearity was observed between b. juncea and its diploid progenitors. the rapa  genomes of both b. juncea and b. napus were found to be highly comparable . similarly, the b genome of b. juncea appeared to maintain similar genomic block architecture as its diploid counterpart in b. nigra . this signified the absence of large scale perturbations during the formation of the allopolyploid brassicas contrary to earlier reports by many groups working on synthetic brassica polyploids  <cit> . additionally, the conserved identity of both the constituent diploid genomes in the brassica polyploids suggests the involvement of a strong and active gene action which inhibits pairing between the homoeologous chromosomes. thus, survival of the allopolypoids b. napus, b. juncea and b. carinata, in all probability, was based on hybrid vigour and suppression of pairing of the homoeologous chromosomes.

defining the constitution of the a, b and c brassica genomes based on these genomic blocks facilitated the reconstruction of the ancestral karyotype to decipher the evolution and diversification of the brassica lineage. common block arrangements shared between the three lineages suggest an ancestral origin. several such conserved block motifs were identified in this study. these include blocks r-w-e-o-p ; blocks r-w-j-i-o-p  and blocks j-i-s-t-n  . since the two lineages within the tribe brassiceae  diverged approximately ~ <dig>  mya  <cit> , the block motifs shared by the a and b genomes would also be ancestral. thus, the block motifs shared between the members of group  <dig>  and group  <dig>   are speculated to be ancestral in origin although their identity in the oleracea lineage is lost. based on the comparative genome analysis of the three diploid brassica species carried out in this study the constitution of the ancestral brassica karyotype  in terms of the block arrangement could be predicted for at least five lgs . earlier studies on chloroplast dna analysis  <cit>  clearly established that the b. rapa/b. oleracea are very closely placed in one lineage and b. nigra belongs to a different lineage. our results suggest significant similarity between the a and b genome for five linkage groups. we therefore propose that besides the five lg putative ancestor, there were divergent parents  involved in the evolution of the two major brassica lineages.

comparative analysis of block organization revealed certain major rearrangements  that were pivotal to karyotype diversification in the different brassica lineages. complete homoeology in terms of block organization was seen for three linkage groups each between the rapa  and oleracea  genomes  and the rapa  and nigra  genomes . this implies that although the rapa and oleracea lineages are more closely related, certain block arrangements have been retained by the rapa and nigra lineages while being lost from the c genome. if the rearrangements in the block organization of the remaining lgs are compared, rearrangements leading to lineage-specific karyotype diversification become evident. our study also highlights certain rearrangements  that appear to have originated in the oleracea lineage after its divergence from rapa. since the chromosome number of the common brassica ancestor remains uncertain, one cannot discern whether the splitting of chromosomes led to the successive increase in chromosome number in the three brassica lineages or fusions led to a reduction in the chromosome number. however, in the present study, the rearrangements leading to the difference of one lg each between the a-b and a-c lineages could be deciphered .

previous studies suggested that two reciprocal translocations, three chromosome fusions and at least three inversions were instrumental in the derivation of at from the ancestral karyotype-ak  <cit> . in the process, several new block boundaries were created. we compared the genomic block organization of ak, at and the three brassica genomes to identify new/common block junctions to gain further insight into the evolution of the crucifer genomes. in the three brassica genomes analyzed, block r was found to be almost always associated with block w  and block q was associated with block x. these associations are characteristic of the brassica genome and are not found in ak or at  <cit> . the rapa/oleracea a3/c <dig> lgs shared the ancestral pattern of blocks f-g-h   <cit>  while in at, f and g-h occupy different chromosomes. similarly, with the extent of saturation available for the three genetic maps of brassica, the c-d, k-g and q-s block fusions characteristic of at are lacking in brassica. this suggests that different rearrangements led to the formation of the arabidopsis and the brassica ancestor. a more detailed view of karyotype evolution would be available once all the centromeres for the brassica genomes are identified.

the identification of homoeology based on the conserved  <dig> genomic blocks would help build a unified comparative genomics system in the brassicaceae as has been done for the gramineae family by the generation of the 'crop-circle'  <cit> . this will facilitate the transfer of information from one species to another for which ip markers would be most useful. with the elucidation of genes involved in many biochemical pathways and the availability of gene expression data, information generated in the model species arabidopsis holds enormous potential for application in breeding of brassica crops. establishment of syntenic relationships between at and brassica would be highly beneficial for the identification of candidate genes contributing to traits of agronomic value from corresponding regions in at and also serve as an exhaustive resource to generate more markers for fine mapping in syntenic regions of brassicas.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study conclusively establishes the efficacy of ip markers for the development of a comparative map between a model plant and a polyploid crop species. the comparative genome analysis performed in this study has contributed significantly to our understanding of the homoeology shared between the a, b and c brassica genomes. the study also identifies, at the macro-level, the evolutionary rearrangements leading to karyotype diversification among the three genomes. additionally, some of the putative ancestral brassica-specific block motifs were identified. syntenic relationships thus established between b. juncea, b. napus, b. nigra and at will facilitate precision breeding and identification and positional cloning of candidate genes contributing to traits of agronomic value in brassica species.
