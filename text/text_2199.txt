BACKGROUND
tyrosine kinase signaling pathways play a major role in the regulation of cell growth, division and motility. it is unsurprising, therefore, that aberrations of these pathways can underlie cancerous phenotypes  <cit>  and that tyrosine kinase pathways have been the targets of several successful anti-cancer agents  <cit> . these targets have included extracellular and cytoplasmic domains of receptor tyrosine kinases, but downstream binding partners may also prove to be important targets for new therapeutics  <cit> .

grb <dig> is a member of a family of adapter proteins that includes grb <dig> and grb <dig>  and serves to couple activated tyrosine kinases to downstream signaling pathways  <cit> . these proteins share a region with sequence homology to the mig- <dig> c. elegans gene required for migration of neuronal cells in embryonic development, suggesting a role for the grb <dig> family in cell migration  <cit> . this role is consistent the presence of grb <dig> in focal adhesions, where it is bound and phosphorylated by focal adhesion kinase  in the process of cell migration  <cit> . grb <dig> is also found in the cytoplasm where it interacts with other upstream binding partners  <cit>  including the members of the erbb receptor family  <cit>  whose activities play a critical role in the regulation of cell proliferation  <cit> .

although the precise downstream activities of grb <dig> are not yet known, there is compelling evidence that grb <dig> represents an important new cancer target  <cit> . grb <dig> is frequently overexpressed in invasive and metastatic cell lines. grb <dig> is tightly co-amplified with the erbb <dig> receptor in breast cancer cell lines and there is a strong correlation between erbb <dig> and grb <dig> over-expression in primary breast cancer specimens  <cit> , as well as in oesophageal and gastric carcinoma  <cit> . recent data suggest that upregulation of grb <dig> impacts on both the proliferative and invasive potential of the cancer cells. an inhibitor peptide specific for grb <dig> was shown to inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation with no effect on non-malignant cells  <cit> . in a separate study, the same grb <dig> inhibitor was demonstrated to significantly attenuate the migratory potential of pancreatic cancer cells  <cit> . grb <dig> is thus an important candidate for the development of inhibitors that block aberrant grb <dig> downstream signaling in cancer progression.

members of the grb <dig> family share a conserved multi-domain structure comprising an n-terminal proline rich domain, a ras-associating-like  domain, a plekstrin homology  domain, a c-terminal src-homology  <dig>  domain and a region between the ph and sh <dig> domains termed the bps domain  <cit> . the interaction with upstream tyrosine kinases is predominantly mediated by the sh <dig> domain, which recognizes specific phosphotyrosines. the adjacent bps domain has also been shown to contribute to recognition of the insulin and insulin-like growth factor- <dig> receptors by grb <dig> family members  <cit> . phosphotyrosine  recognition occurs via a highly positively charged pocket at the surface of the sh <dig> domain  <cit> . substrate differentiation is conferred by amino acid residues immediately surrounding the phosphotyrosine and in particular those located c-terminal to the phosphotyrosine  <cit> .

despite the sh <dig> domains of grb <dig>  grb <dig> and grb <dig> proteins exhibiting between  <dig> – 72% sequence identity, the domains recognise different phosphotyrosine containing sequences. the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain displays a strong preference for phosphotyrosines contained within a pyxn motif, where x is any amino acid  <cit> . the presence of the asparagine at the + <dig> position  is thought to facilitate the formation of a turn in this region, enhancing the interaction with the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain  <cit> . in contrast, grb <dig> sh <dig> domain recognition sequences contain a hydrophobic residue at the + <dig> position relative to the phosphotyrosine  <cit> . a consensus binding sequence for the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain has yet to be determined although several py binding sites have been identified, including tyr- <dig> of pdgf-rβ, tyr- <dig> of elk and the phosphorylated activation loop of the insulin receptor  <cit> .

due to the implication of grb <dig> in cancer cell progression, an inhibitor specific for grb <dig> sh <dig> domain has been developed that targets the grb <dig> sh <dig> py peptide binding site  <cit> . such a peptide provides the opportunity to test the role of grb <dig> in cancer progression, and may potentially lead to novel anti-cancer therapeutics  <cit> . the peptide, termed g7-18nate , was developed using phage display screening for peptides able to specifically bind grb <dig> sh <dig>  <cit> . g7-18nate bound to the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain, but not to grb <dig> sh <dig> domain or to the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain that has also been shown to preferentially bind to a yxn motif. furthermore, in a recent study by tanaka and colleagues, g7-18nate was shown to not only selectively block the interaction between grb <dig> and fak in vivo, but to significantly attenuate the migration of pancreatic cancer cells  <cit> . in addition to effects on cell migration, cell permeable g7-18nate peptides have recently been shown by pero et. al. to inhibit the proliferation in a variety of different breast cancer cells with no effect on non-malignant cells. co-treatment of cell permeable g7-18nate peptide plus chemotherapeutic drugs doxorubicin or herceptin resulted in significant reduction of the drug ec <dig> value in breast cancer cells  <cit> . g7-18nate thus represents the first specific inhibitor of grb <dig> and the first stage in the development of a potential anti-cancer therapeutic. this grb <dig> inhibitory peptide has potential to be developed as a therapeutic agent alone, in combination with traditional chemotherapy, or in combination with other targeting molecules for treatment of cancer.

as a step towards determining the means by which grb <dig> sh <dig> recognizes its specific py peptide substrates and the g7-18nate peptide inhibitor we report the crystal structure of the human grb <dig> sh <dig> domain to  <dig>  Å resolution. this facilitates the first high resolution comparison of the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain with grb <dig> and grb  <dig> sh <dig> domains, allowing us to better understand the basis for their differential binding specificities  <cit> . we also describe the structural basis for the previously reported grb <dig> sh <dig> domain dimerisation  <cit>  and show this also takes place for full-length grb <dig>  with implications for the regulatory mechanism of grb <dig> activity. furthermore, we present biophysical studies of the interaction between the g7-18nate peptide and the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain, using isothermal titration calorimetry and nmr spectroscopy, which provide insight into the basis of their binding affinity and specificity. together, the data has allowed us to propose a model of the interaction that may assist the further development of potent and specific inhibitors of grb <dig> 

RESULTS
the overall structure of the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain
as a first step towards describing the g7-18nate/grb <dig> interaction we solved the crystal structure of the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain to  <dig>  Å. this was achieved using molecular replacement, employing the crystal structure of the grb10γ sh <dig> as a search model . the final grb <dig> sh <dig> model consists of four protein chains each containing residues 420– <dig> of the human grb <dig> protein,  <dig> water molecules and  <dig> sulphate anions, and has an r-factor of  <dig> %  . interpretable electron density was missing for the  <dig> n-terminal residues of the construct  in all four chains. the side-chains of several residues in the bc, de and cd loops and the αa helix were also omitted from the final model due to poorly defined electron density. the pairwise α-carbon root mean square deviations  for the four protomers are between  <dig>  and  <dig>  Å.

the monomer fold of the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain is typical of the sh <dig> domain family, forming a βαβββββαβ configuration  <cit>  . the standard nomenclature for sh <dig> domain secondary structures devised by eck et al.  <cit> is adopted throughout this report. thus the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain comprises a central antiparallel β-sheet, formed by the βb, βc and βd strands, which is sandwiched by the two α-helices, αa and αb. an extension of the βd strand , along with the βe strand, forms a second, smaller anti-parallel β-sheet. an n-terminal helix was observed prior to the start of the sh <dig> domain and designated the name h <dig>  the βf strand, observed in other sh <dig> domains, does not form in grb <dig> 

comparison with other sh <dig> domains and the grb <dig> sh <dig> nmr derived structure
the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain superposes with grb <dig>  and grb  <dig>  sh <dig> domains, across grb <dig> sh <dig> residues 431– <dig>  with α-carbon r.m.s.d.s of  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å respectively. relative to the archetypal src sh <dig> domain  the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain shows a slightly greater divergence due to loop structure differences . this is, in part, due to a three residue insertion in the acidic de loop characteristic of the grb <dig> family members. the cd loop is also shorter by five residues. this combination of differences is, to the best of our knowledge, unique to grb <dig> family sh <dig> domains.

the grb <dig> sh <dig> structure differs markedly from that in complex with the erbb <dig> receptor derived peptide, py <dig> determined using nmr spectroscopy  with the two structures overlaying for residues 431– <dig> with an α-carbon r.m.s.d. value of  <dig>  Å . the nmr derived grb <dig> sh <dig> structure appears to be loosely defined by the nmr derived constraints relative to other sh <dig> domain structures. more importantly, however, the nmr structure deviates from the crystallographic grb <dig> sh <dig> domain in the region of the de loop which is not extended in the nmr structure, due to an alternative hydrogen bonding network between the βd' and βe sheets. this difference propagates to a rearrangement of the ef loop, βb helix and bg loop that follow. whilst it may be argued that these differences reflect structural changes that occur upon py peptide binding, such dramatic structural rearrangements, that involve a rearrangement of a hydrogen bond network, have not previously been observed upon peptide binding to sh <dig> domains, although subtler differences have  <cit> . owing to the considerable differences between the nmr derived grb <dig> sh <dig> domain and all other sh <dig> domain structures , we propose that the current crystallographically derived structure is a more accurate model of the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain, and a better starting point for modeling interactions with bound ligands.

the ligand binding site assumes a bound bc loop conformation
the ligand binding site within sh <dig> domains comprises the phosphotyrosine  binding pocket and adjacent peptide binding site that confers specificity for the residues immediately c-terminal to the py  <cit> . the grb <dig> sh <dig> py binding pocket exists in a cleft formed by residues in the central β-sheet, the αa and the bc loop  and possesses a large positive potential for interacting with the phosphotyrosine . although the bc loop within apo-sh <dig> domain structures usually exhibits poorly defined electron density  <cit> , the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain bc loop is well defined and closely resembles that of sh <dig> domains in their peptide bound conformation. the bc loop is held in this conformation by a complex network of hydrogen bond contacts formed with a sulphate anion that appears to mimic the phosphate moiety of the natural ligand . these contacts include a bidentate ionic interaction with the side-chain of the invariant arg  <dig> . additional hydrogen bonds are formed with the side-chains of arg  <dig> , ser  <dig>  and the main-chain amide of gln  <dig> .

the adjacent peptide binding site of the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain differs from that observed in typical sh <dig> domains, such as the archetypal src sh <dig> domain, which bind phosphopeptides in an extended conformation  <cit> . in these sh <dig> domains, the side-chain of the + <dig> residue of the phosphopeptide is accommodated within a hydrophobic pocket that is lined by residues in the bg and ef loops, along with the βd strand and αb helix  <cit> . analysis of the molecular surface of the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain indicates that it lacks this classical + <dig> binding pocket. instead, it is filled by the side-chain of the bg <dig> residue  sealing off the pocket. this is consistent with the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain binding a peptide with a turn-containing structure as displayed by the grb <dig> and gads sh <dig> domains  <cit> .

the grb <dig> sh <dig> dimer interface
the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain crystallised as a dimer, forming a dimerisation interface  analogous to that observed for grb <dig> and grb <dig> domain structures  <cit> . the grb <dig> sh <dig> dimer is formed by the anti-parallel arrangement of two sh <dig> domains with residues in the βe strand, ef to fb loop region, αb helix and bg loop contributing to the dimer interface . phe  <dig> , the mutation of which has previously been shown to abrogate grb <dig> sh <dig> dimerisation  <cit> , occupies a key position at the centre of the dimerisation interface forming hydrophobic contacts with its equivalent in the opposing protomer  and the side-chains of thr 500*, phe  <dig>  and asn  <dig> . the side-chains of thr  <dig>  and leu*  <dig>  pack together and this interaction caps the dimerisation interface. dimer formation is also stabilised by a number of hydrogen bonds. both od <dig> and nd <dig> of asn  <dig>  form hydrogen bond contacts to the main chain atoms of arg 501*. the side-chain of gln  <dig>  is hydrogen bonded to the backbone carbonyl of glu 510* . the side-chain of glu  <dig>  was also found to form two hydrogen bonds to the side-chain of arg 524*  in one of the two dimers. a similar network of hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions stabilises the grb <dig> sh <dig> dimer  <cit> . the loss of accessible surface area upon dimerisation is about  <dig> Å <dig> per monomer, representing approximately  <dig> % of the monomer surface area. the intermolecular interactions between the two protomers that make up the dimer may help define the positions of residues in the bg and ef loops. this is reflected in the b-factors of these residues , which are lower than the b-factors determined for residues in other loop regions.

a second dimerisation interface  was also observed within the asymmetric unit. this interface is not formed within the crystal packing of other grb <dig> family member sh <dig> domains. it occurs with a buried surface area of approximately  <dig> Å <dig> per monomer and involves contacts between the aa and bc loops and the αa helix of the a chain, and the βd, βd' and βe strands and the bc, de and ef loops of the d chain. this buried surface area is smaller than that between the ab and cd dimers and is peculiar to this grb <dig> sh <dig> domain crystal form. since this interface does not involve phe  <dig>  shown to be critical to dimerisation in solution, we propose that this is not the dimer that predominates in solution.

full-length grb <dig> dimerises in vitro via its sh <dig> domain
the observation of dimer formation in the crystal structure prompted us to investigate the strength of the interaction between grb <dig> sh <dig> domains as well as between full-length grb <dig> molecules. the dimer dissociation constant was calculated for both the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain and full-length grb <dig> at 20°c using analytical ultracentrifugation. figure  <dig> shows profiles recorded for the two proteins that could be fitted globally to a monomer-dimer self-association model using nonlin  <cit> . this yielded a dissociation equilibrium constant for the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain of  <dig>  μm. this represents a slightly weaker association than that determined in previously reported experiments conducted at 4°c  <cit> , consistent with the lesser role of hydrophobic interactions at the higher temperature. the profiles obtained for full-length grb <dig> at  <dig> μm yielded a dissociation equilibrium constant of  <dig> μm. although some sample heterogeneity, possibly due to protein aggregation or degradation, prevented a simultaneous fit with profiles recorded at higher concentrations, the data demonstrated that full-length grb <dig> forms dimers in vitro with a similar affinity to that exhibited by the sh <dig> domain alone. this suggests that the grb <dig> molecule may exist as a dimer in vivo via its sh <dig> domain, as also thought to occur for the grb <dig> and grb <dig> molecules  <cit> .

the g7-18nate peptide binds grb <dig> sh <dig> with micromolar affinity
the g7-18nate peptide  is the first non-phosphorylated peptide to be discovered with binding specificity for the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain. it has been found to bind to the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain, preferentially over the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain, and have the capacity to interfere with grb <dig> interactions with the erbb family of receptors  <cit>  and fak in vivo  <cit> . these interactions may underlie the observed inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation and decrease in cell migration of pancreatic cancer cells treated with g7-18nate, making it of considerable importance to further characterise this peptide and its interactions with grb <dig> sh <dig> domain. isothermal titration calorimetry was thus used to determine the binding affinity of g7-18nate for the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain . this data showed that the peptide bound to the sh <dig> domain with an affinity of kd = ~ <dig>  μ m. this is only an order of magnitude less than the kd =  <dig>  μm measured by lyons and co-workers for the binding of the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain to py <dig>  a native phosphopeptide ligand derived from the erbb <dig> receptor  <cit> .

the g7-18nate peptide perturbs grb <dig> sh <dig> residues at the peptide binding site and the dimerisation interface
in order to further characterize the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain/g7-18nate interaction nmr titration experiments were used to identify sites of grb <dig> sh <dig> perturbation upon binding by the g7-18nate peptide. 1h-15n-hsqc spectra were acquired for 15n-labelled grb <dig> sh <dig> as g7-18nate was titrated in to slight excess . approximately 80% of the amide crosspeaks exhibited line broadening, consistent with an 'intermediate' rate of exchange of free and bound forms of the protein . other peaks remained unperturbed throughout the titration or exhibited a chemical shift change rather than linebroadening. this behavior is common for interactions for which the dissociation constant is between 10- <dig> and 10- <dig> m.

this titration experiment revealed which residues of grb <dig> sh <dig> domain are perturbed upon g7-18nate binding. grb <dig> sh <dig> domain amide resonances have previously been assigned and were kindly provided  <cit> . a plot of the rate of change of signal intensity for each amino acid  is shown in figure 6b. those that broadened most rapidly  were considered significant. upon mapping these residues onto the structure of the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain, they clustered into two regions on the protein surface . the first region  is on the peptide binding face of the domain, and includes residues from the βc and βdβd' sheets as well as the ef loop. these perturbations are similar in position to those reported for the py <dig> peptide binding to grb <dig> sh <dig>  <cit>  and are consistent with the same binding site being adopted by g7-18nate.

the second region  occurs along the αb helix and bg loop, which forms part of the dimerisation interface of grb <dig> sh <dig>  where direct contacts with the peptide ligand would not be expected to take place. such perturbations may result from impact of g7-18nate binding on the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain dimer-monomer equilibrium. a shift from dimeric to monomeric grb <dig> sh <dig> domain has previously been reported upon binding by the py <dig> peptide  <cit> . this was verified by nmr relaxation time measurements, which reduced from  <dig>  ns to  <dig>  ns upon py <dig> binding  <cit> . the perturbations at the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain dimerisation interface upon g7-18nate binding are thus also likely to be due to a shift in equilibrium towards the monomer.

other grb <dig> sh <dig> residues perturbed by g7-18nate binding were located outside these two domains and may result from distal structural rearrangements in these regions resulting from the peptide binding. interestingly, no major perturbation of the grb <dig> sh <dig> de loop region was observed in either our study of g7-18nate, or the study of py <dig> binding. it is thus unlikely that the conformational rearrangement of the de loop reported in the nmr derived structure of the grb <dig> sh2/py <dig> peptide complex occurs upon to peptide binding.

model of the g7-18nate/grb <dig> sh <dig> complex
together the structural data has allowed a model of the g7-18nate peptide interacting with the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain to be constructed. in separate studies we have shown that the g7-18nate peptide has an intrinsic propensity for a turn conformation about the ydn motif  <cit> . the current study also confirmed that g7-18nate binding impacts on the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain surface in a similar way to the py <dig> peptide, and is thus likely to bind at the classical peptide binding site. a model of the g7-18nate peptide was hence positioned at the peptide binding site of the crystallographically determined grb <dig> sh <dig> domain structure by analogy to the shc derived peptide  which interacts with grb  <dig> sh <dig> domain in a turn conformation  . in this model asn <dig>  in the + <dig> position relative to tyr <dig>  is positioned to form hydrogen bond interactions via its sidechain carbonyl and amine functionalities with backbone nh and carbonyl groups of the βd <dig> residue. the non-phosphorylated tyrosine  is able to adopt a position in which its hydroxyl is positioned in the positively charged py binding site. the aromatic ring of tyr  <dig> forms van der waals contacts with the βd <dig> residue sidechain  that may be important for the positioning of the peptide ligand. glu <dig> is also positioned in the py binding site. electrostatic interactions formed by the glu <dig> sidechain may compensate for the lack of a phosphate moiety on the tyrosine. the side chain of asp <dig> is oriented away from the binding cleft and is in proximity of the backbone nh of the βd <dig>  residue with which it could form a hydrogen bond. other residues, constrained in a cyclical conformation, may make contacts at the surface of βc, βd' and ef loop residues shown to be perturbed by nmr spectroscopy. whilst this model should remain speculative, it suggests a likely basis for the relatively high affinity and specific interaction between g7-18nate and the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain.

discussion
the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain has been identified as a potential target for the development of agents to reduce the invasive potential of cancer cells in which grb <dig> is overexpressed. its crystal structure to  <dig>  Å resolution provides structural detail for understanding the basis of interaction with natural targets and designed inhibitors. we have shown that the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain adopts the classic sh <dig> domain fold excepting, as also observed for grb <dig> and grb <dig> sh <dig> domains, an extension of the βd' and βe strands resulting in a longer de loop  <cit> . along with residues in the ef loop and αb helix, the extended de loop contributes to the dimerisation grb <dig> sh <dig> domain. also like the grb <dig> and grb <dig> sh <dig> domains, the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain + <dig> py peptide binding site is occluded, suggesting that peptides are preferentially bound in a turn-like conformation  <cit> .

despite the similarity of the grb7/10/ <dig> sh <dig> domains only grb <dig> shows preferential binding for a yxn motif  <cit> . grb <dig> sh <dig> is reported to interact strongly with tyr- <dig>  of the erbb <dig> receptor while grb <dig> does not  <cit> . furthermore, the g7-18nate peptide, selected on the basis of its yxn motif, was shown to bind to the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain but not to the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain  <cit> . a key mutagenesis study investigating the molecular basis for erbb <dig> receptor binding by grb <dig> revealed the critical role of the βd <dig> residue  in grb <dig> sh <dig> domain target recognition  <cit> . when this residue was mutated to the grb <dig> equivalent residue , binding to the erbb <dig> receptor was completely abrogated. conversely, the mutation of the βd <dig> residue of grb <dig> sh <dig> domain to the grb <dig> equivalent residue  imparted it with high affinity for erbb <dig>  the leu  <dig> residue thus holds the key to grb <dig> sh <dig> domain binding specificity.

the current structural data allows the impact of the βd <dig> residue on the structure of grb <dig> sh <dig> domain to be examined. the βd <dig> residue occurs at the peptide binding interface at the "specificity determining region" alongside the phosphotyrosine binding pocket. by analogy to the interaction between the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain and pyxn containing phosphopeptides, the βd <dig> residue forms critical hydrogen bond contacts with the side-chain functionalities of the + <dig> asn via both its backbone nh and carbonyl moieties  <cit> . this is consistent with the perturbation of residue  <dig> observed upon the titration of g7-18nate as detected in the current nmr experiment. interestingly, a direct structural comparison of the crystallographically determined grb <dig> and grb <dig> sh <dig> domains shows that the βd <dig> residue backbone atoms are equivalently positioned in grb <dig> and grb <dig>  thus no direct disturbance to the formation of hydrogen bonds to the + <dig> asn would be expected to occur when the βd <dig> residue is a gln rather than a leu. instead, grb <dig> binding to a yxn motif is likely to be impacted on by the position and chemical nature of the βd <dig> residue sidechain. the sidechain of βd <dig> residue forms part of the phosphotyrosine binding pocket and it may be that subtle changes to the phosphotyrosine binding position, caused by mutation of the βd <dig> residue from a leu to a gln, results in the observed loss of affinity for a yxn motif.

the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain was found to be dimeric in the crystal structure and in solution, forming an analogous dimerisation interface to that observed for grb <dig> and grb <dig> sh <dig> domains  <cit> . dimerisation of full-length grb <dig> was demonstrated to occur in solution with a kd of the same order of magnitude as that obtained for the sh <dig> domain alone. this suggests that the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain forms the principle dimerisation interface within the grb <dig> dimer. a similar conclusion was reached for grb <dig> by hubbard and co-workers who found that mutation of phe  <dig> to an arg in full-length grb10γ  generates a monomeric form of the full-length protein  <cit> .

the physiological importance of grb <dig> sh <dig> domain dimerisation is still uncertain. it has been suggested for grb <dig> and grb <dig>  that the dimeric state of the protein may contribute to a cooperative association of two grb molecules to form a dimeric activated tyrosine kinase receptor  <cit> . more recently it has been shown that grb <dig> binding to the insulin receptor is enhanced by its dimerisation  <cit> . in this and other studies, however, it has been shown that peptide binding by the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain impacts on the dimer interface and shifts the dimer-monomer equilibrium towards the monomer  <cit> . whether grb <dig> and grb <dig> also undergo a dimer to monomer transition upon peptide binding is yet to be ascertained, but this would seem to be in conflict with enhanced tyrosine kinase receptor binding by dimer formation. it may be that a dimer to monomer transition upon peptide binding is peculiar to grb <dig> 

the structure of the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain, elucidated by our crystallographic study, has permitted its interaction with a recently developed inhibitor peptide to be examined more closely. the g7-18nate peptide is an important lead peptide in the development of novel therapeutics targeting cancer cell migration  <cit> . we report a binding affinity of kd = ~ <dig>  μm. only an order of magnitude lower affinity than that measured for the py <dig> peptide with grb <dig> sh <dig> domain  <cit> , it represents a relatively high affinity interaction for a non-phosphorylated peptide. in general the affinity of an sh <dig> domain/non-phosphorylated peptide interaction is  <dig> –  <dig> times weaker than the affinity measured for the binding of the sh <dig> domain to a phosphorylated form of the peptide, with the difference in the total free energy of complex formation largely the result of the electrostatic interactions between the sh <dig> domain and the phosphate moiety  <cit> . the lack of an electrostatic interaction with a phosphate group may be partially compensated for by the entropic advantage of the cyclized structure of the peptide.

a modeled interaction of the g7-18nate peptide with the grb <dig> sh <dig> structure, consistent with both the crystallographic and nmr derived data, provides a starting point for understanding the structural basis for the binding specificity observed. as discussed above, the positioning of tyr  <dig> against the βd <dig>  sidechain of grb <dig> sh <dig> may be critical for constructive interactions with the ydn motif. the modeled interaction also demonstrates that the lack of a phosphate moiety on the tyr <dig> of g7-18nate may be partly compensated for by electrostatic interactions between the glu <dig> and the positively charged cleft. whilst glutamate is often used as a py mimetic, here it may contribute to binding alongside a non-phosphorylated tyrosine. asp  <dig> at the + <dig> position is also likely to be favoured due to its accommodation without steric hindrance in a pocket of the grb <dig> sh <dig> surface with potential for the formation of hydrogen bond contacts. based on these observations, second generation peptides and peptidmimetic molecules are currently being developed to potently and selectively inhibit grb <dig> in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS
the crystallographically determined structure and dimer formation of the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain has been described providing a new level of insight into grb <dig> target specificity and the likely basis of grb <dig> dimer formation in vivo. the interaction of grb <dig> sh <dig> domain with a non-phosphorylated inhibitor peptide  has been examined, revealing that this peptide binds with unexpectedly high affinity at the classical peptide binding site and that this impacts upon the dimerisation status of the molecule. the structural basis for their interaction has been modeled based on the biophysical data and represents a starting point for the development of second generation inhibitors of grb <dig> based cancer cell migration and proliferation.
