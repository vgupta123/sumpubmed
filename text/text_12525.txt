BACKGROUND
as ubiquitous elements in nature, many heavy metals not only inhibit crop growth and reduce yields and quality but also pose a great threat to human health via food chain  <cit> . cadmium  is non-essential for all living organisms and extremely toxic to humans in micro molar concentrations. therefore, even healthy crops with very low level of cd could be toxic to humans  <cit> .

many studies have been conducted to elucidate the underlying responses of plants to cd stress and mechanisms conferring cd tolerance  <cit> . plants have developed two major strategies to resist cd stress: “excluder” and “includer and tolerance”  <cit> . under the “excluder” strategy, plants reduce the amount of cd entering their roots and shoots. for instance, these plants can restrict cd bioavailability from the soil, reduce the expression of transport proteins involve in cd uptake, and increase the expression of membrane transporters that extrude cd  <cit> . the second strategy is “includer and tolerance” strategy, which relies on compartmentation and detoxification of cd in a controlled manner, allowing plants to accumulate metals to high concentrations  without damaging normal functions of cells  <cit> . these cd detoxification strategies rely on the combined activation of membrane transport and signal transduction pathways, which differ among plant species and among genotypes within a species  <cit> .

accordingly, gene identification and characterization are fundamental steps for deciphering the molecular mechanisms of plant cd tolerance/accumulation for developing cd-tolerant and low cd accumulation transgenic crops  <cit> . molecular approaches have been extensively applied to elucidate how plants respond to cd toxicity  <cit> . dna microarray technology has been employed to analyze the transcriptional responses of grey poplar under cd stress  <cit> . zhao et al. performed a comparative transcriptome analysis and found that cd stress induced general and specific genes in arabidopsis thaliana roots  <cit> . quantitative rt-pcr is often used to validate the data obtained in microarray analyses. the gene expression profile  of limonium bicolor under salt stress were confirmed through qrt-pcr experiments  <cit> .

as an rna-dependent post-transcriptional gene-silencing technique, rna interference  represents an ideal alternative to gene disruption in many organisms  <cit> . over the past ten years, transgene-induced rnai had been developed as an efficient tool for the functional characterization of plant genes for crop improvement  <cit> . for instance, cd accumulation was reduced by about 50 % in the rice grains of rnai-ospcs <dig>  transgenic plants with no apparent difference of growth between rnai and parental plants  <cit> . zn- and fe-regulated transporter-like protein  gene family have been characterized and shown to be expressed through different growth stages of rice. oszip <dig> and oszip <dig> seem to be important for zn uptake from soil, oszip <dig>  oszip <dig> and oszip <dig> for root to shoot translocation, while oszip <dig> and oszip <dig> could be particularly important for zn transport to seed  <cit> . cadmium translocation occur mainly via the same ca2+, zn2+, fe2+, mn2+ transporters  <cit> , so the decrease of root-to-shoot metal translocation could be a major goal in cereals grown in cd contaminated soils. disruption of these transporter genes could prove their function and may suggest a strategy to limit cd accumulation in crops.

barley  is an established model crop for genetic and physiological studies on abiotic stress tolerance  <cit> . in previous studies, we reported comprehensive investigation of physiological and cellular differences between cd-tolerant and sensitive barley genotypes in response to cd stress  <cit> . we demonstrated distinctive genotypic difference between low-grain-cd-accumulating  and high-grain-cd-accumulating  genotypes in response to cd stress  <cit> . however, our knowledge of candidate genes related to low grain cd accumulation in these unique barley genotypes is still limited. therefore, we hypothesize that there are large differences in genome-wide response to cd stress and that the functions of some cd-responsive genes are distinct between the two genotypes.

in this study, we employed multiple technologies, such as dna microarray, qrt-pcr, rnai, confocal microscopy, atomic absorption spectrometry, and gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence analyses to decipher the mechanisms underlying the differential expression and functions of cd-induced genes in two barley genotypes. our aims were to:  elucidate cd distribution in different functional regions and cell types in roots;  identify cd-induced differentially expressed genes responsible for low grain cd accumulation and cd tolerance; and  characterize the function of zip transporter genes  in rnai transgenic barley lines. our results provide significant insights into the complex mechanisms of cd transport, accumulation, and tolerance in barley.

RESULTS
cd affects a range of physiological parameters in the two contrasting barley genotypes
barley plants exposed to cd treatments showed a significant decrease in plant height, root length, and shoot and root dry weight . the symptoms of cd toxicity differed significantly between low-grain-cd-accumulating  and high-grain-cd-accumulating  genotypes with more severe growth reductions in the low-grain-cd-accumulating genotype. in 50 μm cd, for instance, shoot dry weight was reduced by  <dig>  % in w6nk <dig> while it was only  <dig>  % reduction in zhenong <dig> .

after 15 days cd exposure, maximal photochemical efficiency of ps ii , photosynthetic quantum yield of photosystem ii  and coefficient of photochemical quenching  had decreased significantly under increased cd levels in w6nk <dig>  however, the reduction of these parameters in zhenong <dig> was less than in w6nk <dig> . moreover, cd stress induced a significant reduction in net photosynthetic rate , transpiration rate  and stomatal conductance  in both genotypes . in 500 μm cd, pn was completely inhibited in cd-sensitive genotype w6nk <dig>  while zhenong <dig> reduced by  <dig>  % compared with control . leaf chlorophyll a and b contents were also significantly decreased in both genotypes under the three cd treatments  but the reduction of chlorophyll content was smaller in zhenong <dig>  than in w6nk <dig>  under 50 μm cd .

the accumulation and distribution of cd differ significantly between the two genotypes at the tissue and cellular levels
cd concentration increased proportional to the elevated external cd levels, with up to 20-fold higher concentrations being observed in roots than the shoots . there were significant genotypic differences in cd concentrations detected in plants in relation to different cd levels, tissues, and regions of roots, except for shoot cd concentrations treated with 5 μm cd after  <dig> and 10 days. after exposure to 50 μm and  <dig> μm cd both shoot and root cd concentrations in zhenong <dig> were significantly higher than in w6nk <dig> .fig.  <dig> effect of cd levels and time of cd exposure on cd concentration in barley shoots and roots. the data are cd concentration in shoots of w6nk <dig>  and zhenong <dig> , and in different regions of roots of w6nk <dig>  and zhenong <dig> . cd concentration was measured after  <dig>   <dig> and 15 days of cd treatments. data are mean ± sd . * and ** denote significant difference at p <  <dig>  and p <  <dig>  between zhenong <dig> and w6nk <dig> at each of the four cd levels over 15 days



confocal imaging experiments confirmed the above results, demonstrating significantly higher cd accumulation in the 1-cm root tips of zhenong <dig> plants in comparison to w6nk <dig> . the preferential location of cd in roots of zhenong <dig> plants treated with 50 μm cd after 5 days was in the root apex, and this effect was more pronounced under increased cd concentrations and exposure times . on the contrary, there was no cd detected by the cd-sensitive fluorescent probe  in the root tips of w6nk <dig> plants after 5 days of 50 μm cd treatment. cross-sectional images of roots revealed that most cd accumulated in inner epidermis and endodermis. when the two genotypes were compared, there was more green fluorescence observed in endodermis and cortex of w6nk <dig>  while there was stronger green fluorescence in inner epidermis and stellar cells of zhenong <dig> .fig.  <dig> localization of cd2+ in barley roots exposed to cd treatments. representative micrographs show the binding of cd2+ to leadmium™ green am dye at longitudinal and cross sections of root tips from two barley genotypes zhenong <dig>  and w6nk <dig>  after 15 days of cd treatment a the first two lines are images from the green fluorescence indicate the fluorescent dye in cd2+, the third and fourth are images of bright-field plus green flurescence. roots were exposed to  <dig> and 50 μm cd for  <dig>   <dig> and 15 days before staining. scale bars = 250 μm. b relative cd2+ fluorescence density from longitudinal section of root tips. black, white, shaded and grey bars represent  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  500 μm cd, respectively. data are means ± sd . * and ** denote significant difference at p <  <dig>  and p <  <dig> , respectively, between zhenong <dig> and w6nk <dig> at each of the four cd levels over 15 days. arrows denote specific differences between two genotypes



cd stress results in large-scale changes in gene expression
the physiological distinctions observed in response to cd stress  between the two unique barley genotypes led to further exploitation of their differences at the transcriptome level. overall, we found that compared to the control plants, the gene expression profiles the leaves of two genotypes were significantly altered after 15 days in 5 μm cd. cadmium stress induced differential expression of  <dig> genes. among these genes,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were up-regulated  in w6nk <dig> and zhenong <dig>  respectively, with a fold change of at least  <dig>  . these genes represented  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the total genes in the two genotypes . there were distinct differences in gene expression between the two genotypes , with  <dig> genes being up-regulated in w6nk <dig>  but unchanged in zhenong <dig> , while another  <dig> genes were up-regulated in w6nk <dig> , but down-regulated in zhenong <dig>  .table  <dig> membrane transport related genes up-regulated in w6nk <dig> and down-regulated or no change in zhenong <dig> after 15 days exposure to 5 μm cd



the differentially regulated cd-responsive genes were clustered into  <dig> categories according to the similarities in their expression profiles . among the genes that were up-regulated in the low-grain-cd-accumulating genotype w6nk <dig> but down-regulated or unchanged in zhenong <dig>  or no change in w6nk <dig> but down-regulated in zhenong <dig>  27 % were related to stress and defense responses and 11 % represented functions related to transport . the genes that were up-regulated in the high-grain-cd-accumulating genotype zhenong <dig> but down-regulated or unchanged in w6nk <dig>  or unchanged in zhenong <dig> but down-regulated in w6nk <dig>  except for unknown classified and none function sections the largest portion with 15 % was related to photosynthesis, followed by transcription with 13 % . the genes that were up-regulated in both genotypes were mainly involved in stress and defense responses  and carbohydrate metabolism  except for category with unknown function  . furthermore, the genes that were down-regulated in both genotypes mainly involved in unknown classified and none function sections, followed by photosynthesis , stress and defense responses equal to transcription and transport , meanwhile, there were a small amount genes related to protein synthesis, signal transduction and so on .

cd stress leads to higher expression of genes involved in transport, stress and defense responses, carbohydrate metabolism and signal transduction in the low-grain-cd-accumulating genotype
the most relevant group related to low grain cd accumulation were the genes up-regulated in cd-sensitive w6nk <dig> and down-regulated or unchanged in cd-tolerant zhenong <dig> plants, or unchanged in w6nk <dig> but down-regulated in zhenong <dig> . among them, category  <dig> contained  <dig> transport related genes . a closer inspection of the genes involved in transport revealed that they were expressed at a significantly higher level in w6nk <dig> than in zhenong <dig> under cd treatment. for instance, cd-induced fold changes in the transcript levels of zinc transporter  <dig> and a putative abc transporter were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, in w6nk <dig>  whereas they were − <dig>  and − <dig>  in zhenong <dig>  moreover, the transcripts of two macronutrient transporters  were highly expressed in w6nk <dig> under cd stress, showing  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold changes, respectively . category  <dig> contained  <dig> stress and defense response-related genes, others were  <dig> carbohydrate metabolism-related genes, and  <dig> signal transduction-related genes .fig.  <dig> schematic diagram of membrane transporter genes involved in low cd accumulation in barley leaves. some representative genes encoding membrane transport proteins transport cd and other ions on the plasma membrane and tonoplast in w6nk <dig> and zhenong <dig>  squares and circles represent transporter genes expressed in w6nk <dig> and zhenong <dig>  respectively. red, grey and green symbols indicate cd-induced up-regulation, no change and down-regulation of the transporter genes in comparison to the control, respectively. abc, abc transporter family protein; amtp, ammonium transporter; asl, atp sulfurylase; ha, h+-atpase; hxcp, hexose carrier protein; itysl, iron transporter yellow stripe 1-like; ktp, potassium transporter; mst, monosaccharide  transporter; org. ac., organic acids; pc, phytochelatin; pept, peptide transporter; pta, p-type atpase; ros, reactive oxygen species; srrp, stripe rust resistance protein; sutp, sugar transport protein; zfp, zinc finger protein; zip, zinc transporter protein

cd stress leads to higher expression of genes involved in photosynthesis, protein synthesis and transcription in the high-grain-cd-accumulating genotype
interestingly, we found that genes that were higher expressed in cd-tolerant zhenong <dig> plants were very different from those in w6nk <dig> . they included  <dig> genes that were up-regulated in zhenong <dig> and down-regulated or no change in w6nk <dig>  or unchanged in zhenong <dig> and down-regulated in w6nk <dig>  the numbers of these genes involved in different processes as follows: photosynthesis , transcription , protein synthesis , transport , and stress and defense responses  . the cd-induced expression of some key genes was many fold higher under cd treatment vs. the control in zhenong <dig> than in w6nk <dig> . for examples the changes of genes expression level encoding proteins such as plastid-specific ribosomal protein  <dig> precursor were  <dig>  folds, ribonucleo protein  <dig>  folds, rubisco large subunit-binding protein beta subunit  <dig>  folds, lipid transfer protein  <dig>  folds and adenosine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphatase  <dig>  folds. we assumed that they could be related to cd accumulation.

there were  <dig> genes up-regulated in both w6nk <dig> and zhenong <dig> after 15 days exposure to 5 μm cd, of which 23 % were related to stress and defense response, 19 % to carbohydrate metabolism . aside,  <dig> genes were down-regulated in both w6nk <dig> and zhenong <dig> after cd exposure, however 72 % of them were unknown classified  .

the differential expression of transporter genes are verified via qrt-pcr
to verify the microarray data, we selected  <dig> representative genes from different gene categories. the primers targeting these genes are listed in additional file 12: table s <dig>  expression analysis of selected genes via quantitative real time pcr  confirmed the transcript levels observed in dna microarray . nineteen representative genes  showed consistently higher expression levels in w6nk <dig> compared to zhenong <dig>  for instance, the average relative expression of two zip genes in w6nk <dig> was approximately  <dig> times higher than in zhenong <dig> after cd treatment .

silencing hvzips leads to significantly higher accumulation of cd and a reduction of zn and mn in barley grains
as zip genes are key transporters of toxic cd and the essential minerals zn and mn, we utilized rnai technology to further investigate whether disruption of these genes at mrna level affects cd and mineral accumulation in barley grains. in this experiment, a highly conserved portion of the hvzip gene was cloned into the pstargate vector  . we made three rnai constructs, harboring hvzip <dig> and hvzip <dig> isolated from w6nk <dig> and hvzip <dig> isolated from zhenong <dig>  and transgenic lines were generated. out of  <dig> transformed immature barley embryos,  <dig> transgenic lines were regenerated and  <dig> transgenic barley lines showed the presence of hvzip <dig> and hvzip <dig> antisense sequences detected via pcr.

the expression of the antisense transcripts from the hvzip rnai constructs in the transgenic barley primary transformants  and the next generation  lines were evaluated and compared to that in the parental cv. golden promise using qrt-pcr . the relative expression in cv. golden promise was set to  <dig> as a reference for estimation of the relative expression level of hvzip <dig> or hvzip <dig> in the rnai lines. the relative expression levels in the rnai lines were  <dig>  to  <dig> -fold lower than in the parental plants, and the w6nk <dig> zip3- <dig> and zhenong <dig> zip8- <dig> lines showed the highest transcript levels of hvzip3and hvzip <dig>  respectively . the relative expression of zip in next generation  lines revealed similar results as was observed in the primary transformants .

the levels of cd and two related microelements, zn and mn, were then determined in parental barley and the t <dig> rnai grains . the cd concentrations in all of the rnai grains were significantly increased, by up to 70 % compared to parental cv. golden promise plants. in addition, the cd level in the zip <dig> line was much lower than in the six zip <dig> lines excepted for w6nk2-zip8- <dig> line. in contrast, the silencing of hvzips resulted in a significant decrease in zn and mn concentrations in all of the t <dig> rnai grains, with the exception of the zn concentration in the zhenong zip8- <dig> line . examination of cd concentration in t <dig> transgenic grains  have conformed this results. both under control and cd added conditions, concentrations of cd in grains of transgenic lines were significantly higher than that in parental line. similarly, the concentrations of zn and mn in grains of transgenic lines showed a significant reduction compared to the parental line. in addition, the cd concentration in all of the t <dig> transgenic grains under cd treatment was significantly higher than that under normal condition . however, the zn and mn concentrations under cd treatment were lower than under normal condition .fig.  <dig> concentrations of cd, zn and mn in grains of different zip-rnai lines and the parental barley under normal condition and cd treatment. w-zip <dig>  transgenic plants with hvzip <dig> rnai in w6nk2; w-zip <dig>  transgenic hvzip <dig> rnai in w6nk2; z-zip <dig>  transgenic hvzip <dig> rnai of zhenong <dig>  different number represents transgenic lines. data are mean ± sd . * and ** indicates significant difference between transgenic lines and the parental line at p <  <dig>  and p <  <dig> , respectively. the zip-rnai lines in left panel  are t <dig> grains without cd; the ones in middle panel  are t <dig> grains under normal condition; the ones in right panel  are t <dig> grains under cd treatment with artificial contamination of 5 mg kg− <dig> cd in soil



silencing hvzips leads to change of grain ultrastructure
scanning electron microscopy  observations showed that the central endosperm of barley grains that were exposed to cd was packed with a- and b-type starch granules with some protein matrix that surrounded the large a-type starch granules and engulfed the smaller b-type starch granules . compared with the parental cultivar, when exposed to cd, a-type granules in transgenic lines exhibited much more serious surface erosion or deformation. furthermore, the proportion of b-type starch granule was lower in transgenic lines than that in parental cultivar. it was noted that some large starch-associated proteins accumulated around the starch granules of transgenic lines, while very few were observed in wild type. additionally, it was noted that some large protein-rich deposits accumulated around the starch granules of transgenic lines. in contrast, very few deposits were observed in golden promise.fig.  <dig> scanning electron microscopy  image of matured grains. the sem images illustrate the starch–protein interface in the parental line  compared to the t <dig> transgenic grains . the ones in left panel  are grains under normal condition, and the ones in right panel  are grains under cd treatment with artificial contamination of 5 mg kg− <dig> cd in soil. note the higher amount of associated protein in transgenic lines, which surrounds the large a type starch granules  and engulfs the smaller b-type starch granules . pd, protein deposits; pm, protein matrix among large and small starch granules. arrows denote specific differences between parental line and transgenic grains or between control and cd treatment



discussion
can we identify low-grain-cd-accumulating and cd-tolerant barley genotypes?
cadmium contamination remains a potential threat to human health due to its long biological half-life and easy uptake by plants. overall cd tolerance but low cd accumulation in grains are important characteristics in cereals and considered as two key traits related to cd toxicity  <cit> . however, as it was reported previously and reinforced in the present study, these two traits do not always co-exist in a single species or genotype  <cit> .

cd stress caused a significant decrease in growth, photosynthesis, pigment levels and yields in both studied genotypes, with w6nk <dig> being more strongly affected . in addition, cd-tolerant zhenong <dig> showed significantly higher cd accumulation in shoots and various regions of roots than w6nk <dig> . these results were in accord with our previous studies  <cit> . therefore, our comprehensive transcriptome analysis of these contrasting genotypes provided insights into the molecular mechanisms and genes responsible for the cd tolerance but low cd accumulation traits in barley.

compared to other crop species , barley  possesses high genetic diversity  <cit>  and shows higher tolerance to many abiotic stresses, such as drought  <cit> , salinity  <cit> , and acidic soils  <cit> . the work on tibetan wild barley has shown some promising results regarding the identification of low-grain-cd-accumulating and cd-tolerant genotypes  <cit> . seventy percent of  <dig> examined tibetan wild barley lines are more salt-tolerant than the well-known salt tolerant elite cultivar cm <dig>  most of these highly salt-tolerant lines accumulate significantly less na+ than the cultivated barley genotypes  <cit> . if similar mechanisms also apply to cd tolerance, it is our interest to further investigate these wild lines for potential use in breeding to obtain low-grain-cd-accumulating and cd-tolerant genotypes.

comparative transcriptome analysis reveals key transporter genes associated with low cd accumulation
to our knowledge, no detailed molecular evaluation of low cd accumulation has previously been conducted in barley. in this study, many genes were differentially induced in w6nk <dig> and zhenong <dig> in response to cd stress . based on the identified cd-responsive transporter genes, we were able to produce an integrated schematic diagram of the potential mechanisms involved in low cd accumulation . this has provided some novel clues to the molecular mechanisms underlying low cd accumulation in barley.

our previous studies demonstrated that zn interferes with cd uptake and translocation and significantly alleviates cd stress in barley  <cit> . at the molecular level, the toxicity of cd to plants is generally finely regulated by many membrane transporters  <cit> . in this study, genes encoding more than  <dig> of these membrane transporters, including three members of the zip transporter family: zinc transporter  <dig>  the zinc transporter zip <dig>  and a zip-like zinc transporter, were found to be highly expressed in w6nk <dig> plants under cd stress . hence, the zip transporters are crucial for the transport of both essential micronutrients  and non-essential heavy metals such as cd . recently, milner et al. found that  <dig> out of the  <dig> arabidopsis zip family members complement a yeast zn uptake-deficient mutant. atzip <dig> and atzip <dig> are zn and mn transporters present at the root stele tonoplast and plasma membrane, respectively  <cit> . our results in agreement with these findings and showed that the levels of cd, zn and mn are significantly affected in zip-rnai barley lines . in addition, atp-binding cassette  transporter family is responsible for the transport of heavy metals, xenobiotics and lipids, and its members are involved in the vacuolar sequestration, distribution and homeostasis of cd in plants  <cit> . for example, disruption of atmrp <dig> leads to changes in guard cell anion levels and calcium channel activity in arabidopsis  <cit> . in this study, the transcripts encoding four abc transporters were significantly highly expressed in w6nk <dig> than in zhenong <dig> . we therefore propose that w6nk <dig> might be more efficient in vacuolar cd sequestration and cd extrusion from cells in the shoots and roots, resulting in lower cd accumulation in barley grain compared to zhenong <dig> 

tightly regulated transporters of essential nutrients such as ammonium, k, fe and phosphate and ph homeostasis are essential for plant performance under cd stress. among the eight p-type atpases  found in arabidopsis, hma <dig> and hma <dig> are essential for the transport and root-to-shoot translocation of zn and cd  <cit> . in this study, the observed cd-induced up-regulation of genes encoding two p-type atpases in w6nk <dig> may indicate its efficiency in reducing grain cd concentration . moreover, we detected cd-induced up-regulation of genes encoding iron transporter yellow stripe 1-like , a potassium transporter , an ammonium transporter  and a phosphate translocator only in w6nk <dig> . under cd stress, nitrogen can be recycled and translocated from the shoots to roots as a cd protection and storage strategy, with ammonium representing the preferred form of nitrogen  <cit> . a recent publication shows that the arabidopsis nitrate transporter nrt <dig>  functions in the removal of nitrate from the xylem sap and mediates cadmium tolerance  <cit> . plasma membrane ktps contribute to cellular homeostasis and excitability in higher plants  <cit> . a significantly negative relationship has been discovered between fe and cd concentrations  <cit> , and iron deficiency stimulates heavy metal transport in plants  <cit> . it has been suggested that yellow stripe  <dig>  and zmys <dig> play unique roles in delivering a broad range of essential metals in barley and maize  <cit> .

in summary, the cd-induced up-regulation of these transporters may contribute to the low grain cd accumulation observed in w6nk <dig> through the direct transport of cd via zip and abc transporters and through indirect regulation of ammonium, k, fe, phosphate and ph homeostasis. in the low-grain-cd-accumulating genotype  hence the up-regulation of these transporters may contribute to the low grain cd accumulation perhaps by limiting the export to of cd being accumulated in vegetative tissues and less in the grains. from the other hand the down-regulation of the same transporters in the high-grain-cd-accumulating genotype  could have led to the cd to be exported to the grains.

cd-tolerant genotype utilizes different strategies at the transcriptome level for combating cd stress
in the present work, many unique genes were found to be up-regulated in cd-tolerant genotype zhenong <dig> in response to cd stress . based on the identified cd-responsive genes, an integrated schematic diagram of the mechanisms related to cd tolerance was proposed . this integrated schematic diagram of cd-tolerance-related genes may provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cd tolerance in barley, in contrast to the mechanisms that are relevant to low grain cd accumulation. the cd-tolerant genotype zhenong <dig> showed several strategies that were very different from those observed in w6nk <dig> but were effective in altering its transcriptome in response to cd stress.

twenty-nine photosynthesis-related genes were found to be up-regulated in zhenong <dig> but unchanged or down-regulated in w6nk <dig> under cd treatment  and the up-regulation of these genes was translated into 6-fold higher net co <dig> assimilation . the negative impact of cd on photosynthesis is well documented  <cit> . as the most abundant protein in plants, rubisco catalyzes the first step in co <dig> assimilation and photo respiratory carbon oxidation  <cit> . here, we identified candidate genes encoding large and small subunits of rubisco that were up-regulated, showing up to 20-fold changes, in cd-tolerant zhenong <dig> plants under cd treatment. ferredoxin nadp oxidoreductases catalyze electron transfer between nadp and ferredoxin. knockout of atlfnr <dig> decreases the contents of chlorophyll and light-harvesting complex proteins and markedly reduces the psi/psii ratio in the mutant compared to wild-type plants  <cit> . additionally, other genes, encoding nadph-protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase b, psbp and psbp-related thylakoid lumenal proteins, may also play key roles in the improvement of photosynthesis in zhenong <dig> under cd treatment.

many stress defense signalling related genes encoding jasmonate- and ethylene- forming-enzyme-like proteins and calcium-dependent protein kinases were found to be up-regulated in zhenong <dig>  these genes have been well characterized regarding the roles in abiotic stress tolerance  <cit> . ja, et and ca signals play significant roles in the adaption of plants under various stresses, both independently and through synergistic and antagonistic cross-talk  <cit> . cd stress triggers the accumulation of ja and et in arabidopsis and beans, respectively  <cit> . fuhrer et al. reported that under cd-induced stress, ethylene restricts the water and cd flux into bean leaves  <cit> . additionally, the ca2+-binding protein calmodulin  transduces second messengers in cellular responses  <cit> . cd may enter cells via ca2+-selective channels or specific transmembrane transporters to compete with ca2+ for cam-binding sites, resulting in a reduced ability of plants to sense stress signals  <cit> . our results indicated that cd induced a greater increase in the expression of genes related to stress defense signaling in zhenong <dig> compared to w6nk <dig>  which could contribute the cd tolerance of zhenong <dig> 

among the  <dig> protein synthesis genes that were up-regulated in zhenong <dig> and down-regulated in w6nk <dig> in response to cd  <dig> encoded ribosomal proteins and their precursors. protein synthesis is critical for abiotic stress tolerance in plants  <cit> . pytharopouloua et al. suggested that under cd2+-mediated stress, protein-synthesizing activity is reorganized both quantitatively and qualitatively, and cu2+ causes a progressive loss of the ability of 40s-ribosomal subunits to form the 48s pre-initiation complex, decreasing to 34 % of the control level at the end of exposure  <cit> . plastid ribosomal proteins  are essential for ribosome biogenesis, plastid protein biosynthesis, chloroplast differentiation, and early chloroplast development, and nuclear-encoded prps <dig> plays an important role in chloroplast development in rice  <cit> . prps are crucial for the establishment of the transcription/translation apparatus during the build-up step in chloroplast differentiation in maize  <cit> . a lack of prps has diverse phenotypic effects in plants, including decreased photosynthetic capacity, reduced plant height or even lethality  <cit> . our finding suggested that ribosomal proteins are crucial for cd tolerance in barley as well.

finally, in this study, h+-atpase, atp synthase and atp-sulfurylase encoded by detoxification-related genes were found to be up-regulated in zhenong <dig> but down-regulated in w6nk <dig> . the cd-induced high expression of these genes may be one of the important components of cd tolerance in zhenong <dig>  heavy metals could alter membrane permeability properties and inhibit both proton transport and h+-atpase activity, and the regulation of this enzyme may therefore be relevant to cd tolerance  <cit> . the cation antiporter activity driven by the vacuolar atpase-dependent proton motive force contributes significantly to the detoxification of cd via vacuolar compartmentalization in plants  <cit> . in addition, cd has a high affinity for metabolic processes related to sulfur metabolism via atp- sulfurylase and adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate sulfotransferase  <cit> . once cd enters the cytosol, another system strictly related to sulfur metabolism is promptly activated to produce phytochelatins for cd detoxification  <cit> .

suppression of hvzip expression using antisense constructs confirms the role of hvzips in high accumulation of cd in barley grains
our microarray data provided strong evidence that up-regulation of genes encoding zip and many other membrane transporters was crucial for reducing cd accumulation in w6nk <dig>  both directly and indirectly . we investigated whether rnai-mediated silencing of hvzips could lead to high cd accumulation, constituting an opposite effect. indeed, hvzip <dig> and hvzip <dig> antisense lines showed a large increase in cd accumulation and a significant decrease in the zn and mn concentrations in barley grain . zip transporters are involved in zn, fe, mn and cd homeostasis  <cit> . the rice zip transporter family has been shown to have diverse functions in zn uptake in different tissues and cell types  <cit> . additionally, over-expression of arabidopsis atzip <dig> zn transporter in barley results in increases in short-term zn uptake and grain zn contents  <cit> . the results with hvzip <dig> and hvzip <dig> rnai lines suggested that up-regulation or over-expression of hvzip <dig> and hvzip <dig> genes may result in lower cd transport and accumulation. further efforts will be devoted to comprehensively characterizing each of these transporter genes and their potential roles in both low cd accumulation and cd tolerance.

CONCLUSIONS
together with comprehensive physiological analysis of the two contrasting barley genotypes, microarray analysis of the complex cd-induced gene expression pattern and zip rnai transgenic analysis provided new insights contributing to a more in-depth understanding of the low cd accumulation and cd tolerance observed in two contrasting barley genotypes. cd stress resulted in large-scale changes in gene expression, which differed substantially between the two genotypes. cd stress led to higher expression of genes related to transport, carbohydrate metabolism and signal transduction in the low-grain-cd-accumulating genotype w6nk <dig>  whereas it up-regulated genes involved in photosynthesis, protein synthesis, stress anddefense responses and transcription in the high-grain-cd-accumulating, cd-tolerant genotype zhenong <dig>  in addition, it was suggested that the cd-induced high expression of genes encoding zip and abc transporters is associated with low cd accumulation in barley. rnai analysis further validated the functions of hvzip <dig> and hvzip <dig> related to low grain cd accumulation. the results illustrated that many of these transporters could be applied in biotechnology to decrease cd accumulation in grains and improve cd tolerance in barley. however, elucidating the mechanisms underlying cd stress accumulation and tolerance in barley remains an ambitious endeavor for future research.
