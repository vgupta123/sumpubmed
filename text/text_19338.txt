BACKGROUND
curbing the spread of vector borne diseases such as malaria or dengue is possible by
eliminating the transmission capabilities of the insect vectors. one of the many
approaches to achieve this is population transformation of vector species. in the most
commonly discussed application of population transformation the aim is to introduce
transgenes into insect populations which render them refractory to spreading diseases.
usually the technique seeks to use evolutionary principles to establish such transgenes
at high frequency in populations through the release of genetically transformed stocks
. synthetic disease refractory genes have already been developed for human
malaria, dengue fever and avian malaria  <cit> . however, to stably transform insect populations with transgenes that are not
selectively advantageous it will be necessary to link refractory transgenes to systems
that drive them to high frequency in a population  <cit> . three transgenic population transformation systems have been shown to be
effective in laboratory populations of insects. one is a homing endonuclease based
system , which works by converting heterozygotes to homozygotes  <cit> . the remaining two systems work by reducing the average fitness of
heterozygotes and are: medea  <cit>  and a bi-allelic form of underdominance  <cit> . here we explore theoretically a mono-allelic form of underdominance the
implementation of which has to date not been published.

while most studies examine the theoretical properties of transgenic constructs embodying
single drive mechanisms  <cit> , the observation that “most of them have specific characteristics that
make them less than ideal” led huang et al.  <dig>  <cit>  to explore combinations. they demonstrated that certain combinations resulted
in enhanced properties relative to single systems while others had the opposite effect.
here we take an analogous approach for autosomal medea and mono-allelic underdominance
constructs . we provide a rigorous and flexible analytical framework to explore salient
properties across the entire parameter space. intuitively, the inclusion within a single
transgenic construct of more than one drive mechanism provides a degree of resilience to
either mutations in the transgenic construct or to drive-resistance alleles which may
exist in target population. while the value of this desirable functional redundancy is
not analytically explored here, it does however provides an additional motivation for
analyzing the properties of combined systems. similar to huang et al. <cit>  the motivation for the analysis presented here comes from the realization
that intuitive predictions about combined systems can be misleading and that identifying
the parameter space where synergistic enhancements occur can motivate technical
developments, including the development of mono-allelic form of underdominance.

we briefly summarise the previously known properties of medea and mono-allelic
underdominant systems separately. then we look in turn at each of the properties of
interest and determine if the combined model performs better than each of the techniques
independently. the discussion focuses on the impact of a combined system and provides an
assessment of its strengths and weaknesses.

medea
natural maternal effect dominant embryonic arrest
 alleles were first discovered in tribolium flour beetles  <cit>  and have also been reported in the mouse  <cit> . they derive their ability to invade populations by maternally induced
lethality of wildtype offspring not inheriting a medea allele   <cit> . thus the wildtype homozygous offspring of the heterozygous mother die
with a certain probability d. despite the mechanism by which natural
medea elements exert their maternal effect remaining unknown, chen et al.  <cit>  were able to generate a synthetic system  which mimics their evolutionary properties.
heterozygous for medea. if the mother is a medea carrier then she
deposits a toxin in the oocytes. only the offspring who have a copy of the
medea allele are rescued. thus the wildtype homozygous offspring of a
heterozygous mother are affected  and die with a certain probability
d.

to date, the only published medea construct  has been inserted on an autosomal chromosome in d.
melanogaster <cit> . autosomal medea insertions unlike sex-chromosome insertions  <cit>  exhibit a high-frequency stable equilibrium when the transgenic construct
is associated with any fitness cost . as
described previously  <cit>  this stable equilibrium results in the persistence of wildtype alleles in
populations transformed with autosomal medea constructs .
population consists of the genotype given by that vertex . in the interior the population composition is a combination of
all the three genotypes with frequencies proportional to the perpendicular
distance from the vertex. unstable equilibrium points are shown as white
circles and are always internal within the simplex. stable equilibrium are
shown as black circles and occur on edges . the fitness of the wildtype homozygote is
assumed to be  <dig> and the fitnesses of the other genotypes relative to it are
given by ω= heterozygotes and ν= homozygotes. the
lethality effect of the medea allele is given by the parameter d. the
three panels describe:  “medea only”, an unstable and
stable equilibrium occur. these parameters equate to a strong medea phenotype
associated with a significant fitness cost that is substantially dominant. the
m allele frequency at the stable threshold is  <dig>  and at the unstable
threshold is  <dig> .  “underdominace only”, an unstable
equilibrium occurs, always in the right half of the simplex.these parameters
equate to weak underdominace with a significant fitness cost in transgenic
homozygotes. the unstable threshold frequency of the m allele is  <dig> .
 a combined medea and underdominance system, shows only an
unstable equilibrium occurs. we assume multiplicative fitness for
ν from the values in  and , the unstable threshold
frequency of the m allele is  <dig> , which is the ideal threshold for
transformation and reversibility . the black line shows the
hardy-weinberg equilibrium. note that the system under study easily diverges
from the hardy-weinberg null model.

underdominance
when the heterozygote is less fit than both the possible homozygotes then we have a
case of underdominance. however there are only a few examples where alleles at a
given locus have been robustly inferred to exhibit underdominance  <cit> . in a random mating, hardy-weinberg population, rarer alleles have larger
sojourn times in the heterozygote state, consequently where an underdominant
construct is rare it will mostly be in this unfit genotype. due to the inherently
unstable nature of underdominance, if the construct exceeds a threshold value through
releases of sufficient homozygotes it is predicted to proceed to fixation within the
population . intentional underdominant population
transformation is inherently reversible where it is realistically possible to release
sufficient wildtype individuals to traverse the unstable equilibrium in the lower
frequency direction. however, underdominant constructs can be viewed as unappealing
when transforming large populations due to the high release numbers required to
initiate population transformation   <cit> . the mono-allelic underdominance modeled here describes the situation
where there is a transgenic allele at a single autosomal locus . we have only examined situations where an insert
is underdominant in both sexes. a recent publication  <cit>  describing the development of a single locus bi-allelic form of
underdominance where there are two functionally distinct transgenic alleles is not
applicable to the mono-allelic underdominance analysis described here.

medea and underdominance in a single transgenic construct
here we explore the properties of combining both medea and underdominance in a single
transgenic construct on an autosome. as single locus transgenic underdominance
effective in both sexes cannot by definition be configured on sex chromosomes we have
modeled both systems on autosomes to permit the most direct comparison between single
and combined systems. by combining systems, some properties will be discounted,
remain the same or synergistically enhanced. we find a broad parameter space where
the applied properties of single systems can be argued to be synergistically
enhanced. the principle criteria being:  lower transformation threshold, 
faster population transformation and  enhanced spatial stability of the
transformed population.

methods and 
RESULTS
genotype fitnesses and expected dynamics
the recursion dynamics are analysed for genotype frequencies as maternal-effect
killing violates the hardy-weinberg principle. with medea the action of selection on
wildtype homozygotes depends not only on their current state but also on the maternal
genotype. here we have the three genotypes, wildtype homozygous, transgenic
homozygous and the heterozygous represented by ++, mm, and m+ respectively. we set
the fitness of the wildtype homozygote, ++, to  <dig>  the relative fitnesses of the mm
homozygote and the m+ heterozygote are given by ν and ω.
the parameter d measures the degree of lethality of homozygous wildtype
offspring from medea carrying mothers, from no medea effect  to
complete lethality . using table  <dig> we calculate
the expected frequencies of all three genotypes in the next generation as, 

  g¯x′=νx2+xy+y24g¯y′=ωxy+yz+2xz+y22g¯z′=z2+yz2+yz2+y <dig> 

m

m
m
where x, y, and z are the frequencies of mm, m+, and ++
respectively in the current generation and x′, y′, and z′ are the expected frequencies in the next generation . the total contribution from all
genotypes in the population  is given by g¯. it is the sum of the right hand sides of the set of eqs.   <cit> . another way to view the recursion equations is x′=xfx/g¯, where f
x
 is the average fitness of the mm genotype  <cit> . equating the fitnesses of the three genotypes helps us to solve for the
fixed points of this dynamical system . for d= <dig> there can be
an unstable internal equilibrium ). from the point of view of
reversibility it is ideal to have this equilibrium as close as possible to one-half
. this is possible when the fitness values of the
heterozygote and the medea homozygote sum up to unity ) as can
be seen in figure  <dig>  the fitnesses of the systems described
here are assumed to relate only to the drive mechanism . in figure  <dig> we illustrate how selecting a
medea construct with appropriate parameters results in the combined system having an
internal equilibrium closer to the ideal one-half. the release thresholds are
determined by the unstable fixed points of the system. as illustrated in figure  <dig>  combined systems have the potential to be engineered towards an
optimal unstable equilibrium value of  <dig>   and ). a release threshold
substantially smaller than  <dig>  would make the construct unappealing from the point of
view of reversibility . however, if the size of the
target population is large and the capacity to reverse population transformation is
not important, then a ‘medea only’ construct would be the most efficient
approach. solely from the perspective of initiating population transformation,
‘underdominance only’ is disadvantageous as it requires multigenerational
release of a large numbers of individuals .
relative to the wild population is plotted as a function of the unstable
equilibrium given by the frequency of the medea allele p=x^+ŷ/ <dig>  to achieve population transformation the release
size must be above the solid red line ). to
reverse a transformation the release must be above the dashed blue line
/p). the combined transformation-reversal
release sizes are above the thick black line
−2), which has a minimum at
p=1/ <dig> 
lethality . the position of the internal
unstable equilibrium is illustrated which needs to be traversed for population
transformation and for reversal. as the value of ν increases the
unstable equilibrium moves closer to the all ++ vertex. the different values of
ω trace a curve which intersects the hardy-weinberg
equilibrium line at ν=ω. for underdominance the
fixed points are always below the hardy-weinberg curve . this also graphically demonstrates eqs.  and 
i.e. the frequency of the medea allele is 1/ <dig> when
ν+ω= <dig> . note that when the unstable equilibrium is above
the hardy-weinberg equilibrium line, there also exists a stable root on the m+
– mm edge given by =. disks indicate the positions of results plotted
in figure  <dig> for the ‘medea only’ system 
and the combined system .

it is generally appreciated that once releases commence, population transformation
should occur as rapidly as possible and proceed to complete fixation. this minimizes
the possibility of selection for insects resistant to the transformed construct.
furthermore the pathogen itself could evolve mechanisms to evade the effects of the
linked refractory genes. a rapid and complete fixation of the transgenic construct
and elimination of the pathogen minimizes both possibilities . clearly, releasing as many individuals as is feasible is an
effective way to speed population transformation  <cit> . we show that the time taken to achieve population transformation can also
be reduced by combining two systems, where even very weak medea
 has a large impact on the speed of transformation. . the acceleration can also
occur during reversal of population transformation. knowledge of this effect will
permit the design of efficient release strategies for both the initiation of
population transformation and for its rapid reversal.
frequencies of the mm genotype. with the parameter values for the
combined system  we begin on the ++ - mm edge at different frequencies.
the time required to reach mm frequencies > <dig>  are plotted as the critical
times. starting with the frequency of mm genotypes of  <dig>   only if
d≥ <dig>  the system moves to the mm vertex. as the medea
lethality increases the all mm vertex can be reached by starting at lower
frequencies of mm genotype. starting at already high frequencies  the time to reach fixation quickly drops to the levels which are
almost the same as that of complete medea lethality. ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ). for the recursions, eqs.  were employed.

population structure dynamics
we consider a simple two-deme model of population structure, where two populations of
large and equal size are coupled by a symmetrical fraction of migrants m
between the populations in each generation. considering asymmetries in population
sizes, migration needs to be dealt with separately, as in  <cit> . also migration dynamics with an explicitly set spatial system has been
recently assessed  <cit>  . in population i the expected
genotype frequency of genotype k after migration is gk,i′=gk,i+mgk,j, where g
k,i
 is the frequency of the k
t
h
 genotype in population i and g
k,j
 is the k
t
h
 genotype frequency in population j. these adjusted genotype
frequencies can then be substituted into eqs. .

we initialize the two populations where the medea allele is almost fixed in one and
almost lost in the other. the recursions were performed for different migration
rates, slowly incremented in units of 10− <dig>  the migration rate where
the difference in allele frequencies between the two populations fell below
1% , was
recorded as the critical migration rate. at lower than critical migration rates the
combined systems will not spread far from a successfully transformed zone, and will
be resistant to loss by immigration. we evaluated the critical migration rate which
allow the transformation of a local population stably . for a varying heterozygote fitness ω ranging from  <dig>  to
 <dig>  we consistently see that having a medea construct provides more geographical
stability as compared to a system without medea even as we move from a system with
directional selection against medea to an underdominant system. figure  <dig> shows that a combined system has a higher geographic stability in terms
of limiting the unintentional transformation of adjacent wildtype populations for a
wide range of values of transgenic homozygote fitness ν . interestingly, in combined systems geographic stability does not
increase monotonically with respects to ν. this can result in maximal
geographic stability for combined systems at intermediate values of ν
. the levels of sustained migration, which maintain
geographic stability, can be surprisingly high and of an order expected between
highly interconnected demes rather than between isolated populations  <cit> . in addition to the obvious regulatory benefits of robust geographic
stability, this property can be exploited to limit the number of transgenic
individuals in which unintended mutational events can occur or to lower the
probability that pathogens evolve resistance to linked refractory genes.
of genotype and medea parameter configurations. using the recursion
equations eq.  with modifications as described in the “population
structure dynamics” section we explore the pattern when there is no medea
effect  and complete medea lethality . for
different values of the heterozygote fitness  we explore the
genotype configurations going from directional selection to underdominance. the
transition in the fitness structure between these two states is indicated
within the plots using token bar charts . over a wide range of parameter space the combined construct exhibits
substantially higher critical migration thresholds than ‘underdominance
only’. interestingly the d= <dig> dynamics are not monotonic. the
figure illustrate how migrational stability can be enhanced, even with a
reduction in fitness of the genetically modified homozygote. disks indicate the
positions of results plotted in figure  <dig> for the
‘underdominance only’ system , the combined system  and
‘medea only’ . comparing the combined system with with
‘medea only’ system we see that not only medea but underdominance
also is necessary to get the desired migrational stability in experimental
systems.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
in the theoretical analysis of combined population transformation systems huang et
al. <cit>  considered the combination of a transgenic two-locus form of underdominance
. both wolbachia and sex-linked meiotic drive were demonstrated to have
the potential to significantly impact the feasibility and dynamics of population
transformation in both positive and negative ways. it was clearly shown that intuitive
expectations of combined systems could be misleading and that mathematical modeling was
essential in identifying potentially useful combinations and parameter values . an excellent example is the huang et
al. <cit>  theoretical analysis of the two-locus form of engineered underdominance which
has been only recently realised  <cit> .

here we have followed an analogous approach to explore the properties of combining two
currently developed transgenic drive systems within a single autosomal construct. the
underdominant and medea systems are assumed to be physically interspersed in a manner
that maximizes the probability that they remain linked . the described modeling framework has allowed us to identify a broad
parameter space where combined systems can in some circumstances outperform single
systems in terms of  optimizing release thresholds   increasing the speed of
population transformation and   enhancing the
geographic stability of population transformation . in
addition, the reliance on two distinct mechanisms for population transformation could
reduce the probability that resistance to the transgenic construct arises in the target
insects. if however, long term selective pressures within successfully transformed
target populations would result in the loss of the underdominance mechanism, this
essentially leaves a ‘medea only’ construct at high frequency. this
‘medea only’ construct would be impractical to remove  and could spread to adjacent populations.
conversely, loss of the medea mechanism from a combined construct has a considerably
smaller impact on reversibility and stability . recognizing that the loss of medea is preferable to loss of
underdominance, it would be prudent to engineer underdominance which is more
mutationally stable than medea . it is also noteworthy that many of the synergistic enhancements
ascribed to combined systems are to a significant extent shared by medea constructs
inserted on sex-chromosomes  <cit> . consequently, depending on the empirical properties of autosomal versus
sex-chromosome inserts the relative merits of both approaches would warrant evaluation
within the specific objectives of a given program.

it has been assumed throughout that fitness costs are directly associated with the drive
mechanism or mechanisms in a transgenic construct, however it is also likely that
additional costs will also be associated with anti-plasmodial or anti-viral genes
included as part of a working construct. the analytical framework described here will
permit the prediction of the properties of combined systems loaded with such disease
refectory genes. the fitness cost of refractory genes has in some, but not all,
circumstances been estimated to be quite high  <cit> . consequently the illustrative parameters values used in figure  <dig> may represent plausible values for ‘loaded’ constructs
. the immediate practical use of this method could help protect d.
melanogaster from an unintended species wide medea transformation if combined
with underdominance for testing in the lab. the most likely application of population
transformation is in species of the genera anopheles and aedes which
act as devastating disease vectors  <cit> . within these genera there are significant differences in dispersal
capacities estimated at various locations, in some instances individuals migrate
hundreds of meters over their lifetime  <cit> . consequently, the capacity to restrict transgenic constructs to particular
populations is likely to be considered of high value. various configurations of
underdominance have been proposed as representing the most likely system to maintain
geographic stability  <cit> . geographic stability is generally achieved by maximizing the fitness of
transgenic homozygotes fitness ν. however where this is not possible due
to cost arising from the underdominant drive mechanism or of refractory genes, our
analysis indicates that maximal geographic stability can be achieved by combining
systems for intermediate values of ν .
exploitation of this phenomena, in addition to the value of functional redundancy in
drive mechanisms, could provide a valuable practical incentive to explore combined drive
systems experimentally.

appendix
average genotype fitnesses and calculating the equilibria
the frequencies of the genotypes in the next generation are given by x′, y′ and z′. in equilibrium we have x′=x, y′=y and z′=z. however the expressions for the next generation
frequencies are rational functions given by, x′=xfx/g¯, y′=yfy/g¯ and z′=zfz/g¯ where the fitnesses of the genotypes are given by, 

  g¯x′x=fx=νx+y+y24xg¯y′y=fy=ωx+z+2xzy+y2g¯z′z=fz=z+y2+y2+y24z. 

now in equilibrium the frequencies of the genotypes do not change over generations
but it is a consequence of their average fitnesses being the same. hence we can
deduce the equilibria of the system just be equating the average fitnesses. this is
just another way of writing x′=x, y′=y and z′=z, which reduces to fx=fy=fz=g¯. considering the average fitness of the genotypes in a pairwise
fashion, two genotypes are neither increasing or decreasing relative to each other if
their average fitnesses are equal, e.g., f
x
=f
y
. this argument is obvious when we view the system in continuous time. while
the recursion equations predict the dynamics of the system in the next time step, one
at a time, we can explore the complete dynamics by analysing the analogous
differential equations given by, 

  x˙=xy˙=yŻ=z. 

where the time derivative of a variable is given by x˙=dx/dt and so forth for y and z. from the form of these
differential equations the equilibrial solutions are evident, either when the
frequencies are zero  or
when the bracketed terms are zero. since the genotype frequencies sum up to  <dig>  we can
solve for just two frequencies. the solutions obtained though are complicated
expressions with a possibility of imaginary roots.

assuming complete medea lethality , the equilibrium of the system is
given by, 

  x^=21+ν−ω;ŷ=2ω1+ν−ω;z^=ω2−ω+ν1+ν−ω. 

when it exists  then it is always unstable. of particular interest is the case
where the medea allele frequency  at the unstable equilibrium is  <dig> , 

  p=1/ <dig>  

as this is ideal from the point of view of reversibility . in order to cross an unstable equilibrium threshold, to ultimately
transform a population, releases have to be made of a minimum size of
p/ relative to the wild population size. to cross
this boundary and then recross it  requires two releases with a minimum combined size of
1/p− <dig>  this function approaches positive
infinity at p= <dig> and p= <dig> and has a minimum at p=1/ <dig> with
the release ratio being twice that of the wild population . thus, an unstable threshold of p=1/ <dig> is ideal from the
perspective of population transformation and reversibility and is still much lower
than release sizes used in successful applications of the sterile insect technique.
substituting the equilibrium values in eqs.  into eq.  gives 

  ν+ω= <dig> 

at d= <dig> . for t< <dig>  there may
exist two internal equilibria, the lower allele frequency one is unstable and the
higher frequency one is stable, given by 

  x^=ν2ω−ν;ŷ=1−x^;z^= <dig>  

however, in case of underdominance if eq.  holds then only the unstable internal
equilibrium exists at p=1/ <dig>  this is graphically illustrated in figure  <dig> 
for d= <dig>  the high-frequency unstable
equilibrium and stable equilibrium were determined numerically for d=1
over a range of fitness values. in the shaded region an unstable equilibrium
exists within the interior of the simplex. in the meshed region a stable
equilibrium exists on the m+ to mm edge of the simplex the non-mesh region
corresponds to underdominance. the dark diagonal line denotes an ideal unstable
threshold in terms of ease of populations transformation and reversal
 . disks indicate the positions of
results plotted in figure  <dig> for the ‘medea
only’ system  and the combined system .
