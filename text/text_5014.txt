BACKGROUND
pleistocene events have shaped the phylogeography of many taxa worldwide  <cit> . particular emphasis has been put on these dynamics in temperate regions  <cit> . tropical biomes have also been shown to have undergone complex ecological dynamics following worldwide pleistocene climate changes  <cit> , but their genetic signatures in present-day natural populations are much less explored. the genetic structure of natural populations is not only shaped by these ancient processes but also by ongoing natural  and more recent anthropogenic factors  <cit> .

one model region for the study of the combined effects of ancient and recent factors is madagascar. this island has been isolated from all other landmasses during the last  <dig> million years  and different vertebrate groups have undergone complex phylogeographic histories  <cit> . moreover, madagascar has been strongly affected by anthropogenic disturbances during the last  <dig> years following the arrival of humans on the island  <cit> . approximately 90% of the original vegetation is believed to have already disappeared  and most forests are now heavily fragmented  <cit> . this poses a particular threat to forest-dependent species, since barriers such as novel savannahs can significantly modify their genetic structure  <cit> . such barriers can notably reduce gene flow between populations which can lead to a loss of alleles, an increase in homozygosity and inbreeding through isolation  <cit> .

lemurs are an endemic mammal group on madagascar. within lemurs, mouse lemurs  form an exceptionally diverse genus. the number of described microcebus species has increased from four to  <dig> in recent years  due to largely increased sampling efforts and to the application of phylogenetic analyses of dna sequences. mouse lemurs are small, nocturnal, solitary foragers that inhabit a large variety of forest habitats with no more than two species co-occurring in a given area .

the high species diversity of lemurs in general and of mouse lemurs in particular has been explained as a joint effect of topographic barriers  and/or pleistocene climatic and vegetation changes  <cit> . recent studies indicate that most large rivers act as genetic barriers for mouse lemurs  <cit>  and it has been suggested that a long-term separation between adjacent inter-river-systems  promoted speciation in this clade  <cit> . this process may explain the very limited distributions of many species.

in contrast to most other lemur species, the grey mouse lemur  has a wide distribution as it inhabits the dry deciduous forests from southern to northwestern madagascar  <cit> . the apparent lack of speciation events within this taxon could be the result of a lower speciation rate, a higher migratory potential, or a relatively recent expansion of this species into the western irss of madagascar. the latter hypothesis is supported by three lines of evidence and shall be further investigated in this study: i) in a recent study kappeler et al.  <cit>  estimated the age of the m. murinus clade to about  <dig>  my, which sets an upper pleistocene limit for its expansion; ii) m. murinus possesses an ecological preference for dry habitats  <cit>  which are typical for southern madagascar; iii) m. murinus is the closest relative of m. griseorufus from southern madagascar  <cit>  which suggests that this expansion may have originated in southern madagascar. this geographic setting would indeed suggest a late pleistocene or even postglacial colonization of western to northwestern madagascar by the grey mouse lemur.

grey mouse lemurs occur in partial sympatry with the golden-brown mouse lemur  and with the bongolava mouse lemur  in two adjacent irss at their northern distribution limit . the effect of natural and anthropogenic factors on population structure and genetic diversity of m. ravelobensis and m. bongolavensis has been studied in some detail using mtdna  <cit>  and microsatellites  <cit> . these studies revealed a negative influence of forest fragmentation on genetic diversity  <cit>  and showed an effect of isolation-by-distance for m. ravelobensis  <cit> . moreover, large rivers and savannahs were shown to reduce or even prevent gene-flow between populations and have generated genetic structure  <cit> .

this study aims to assess the effects of phylogeographic processes, anthropogenic pressures , and natural features  on the genetic structure of the grey mouse lemur at its northern distribution edge. populations in this area are predicted to show signs of a pleistocene spatial expansion from the likely southern origin towards the northwestern irss. spatial simulations were used to identify the expansion model which fitted best to the patterns of molecular diversity observed in extant m. murinus populations. the results are compared to previously published data on m. ravelobensis, which may have arrived before. by means of spatial simulations, we could detect signals of two successive spatial expansions of m. murinus in northwestern madagascar which could be preliminarily dated to the late pleistocene and the early holocene.

RESULTS
genetic diversity
a total of  <dig> monomorphic  and  <dig> polymorphic positions  were identified in the d-loop sequences  of the  <dig> individuals. a total of  <dig> different haplotypes were found which differed in 1- <dig> positions in pairwise comparisons.

the genetic diversity of sites varied in the anp, as well as among the isolated forest fragments . three sites exhibited no genetic variation. these were two sites with small sample sizes in the anp  and one forest fragment with a large sample size . however, we found no overall significant influence of sample size on the number of haplotypes or on haplotype diversity  =  <dig> , n.s.; haplotype diversity: r <dig> =  <dig> , f =  <dig> , n.s.).

h: number of haplotypes; hd: haplotype diversity; ar: allelic richness, corrected for sample size; nd : nucleotide diversity; iff: isolated forest fragment; anp: national park; -: values could not be calculated due to the lack of polymorphism  or small sample size ); *: p <  <dig> .

in general, the anp samples showed the highest genetic diversity, in particular sites with larger sample sizes . the four samples with most haplotypes  were located within the anp. the three anp samples with only one or two haplotypes were also the smallest samples with three or five individuals, respectively. among the isolated fragments, tanambao possessed the highest number of haplotypes , while the other sites were less diverse. when comparing haplotype diversity, allelic richness or nucleotide diversity statistically between the sites in the anp and the isolated forest fragments, however, no significant difference could be revealed : u =  <dig> , n <dig> =  <dig>  n <dig> =  <dig>  n.s.; nd: u = 17; n <dig> =  <dig>  n <dig> =  <dig>  n.s.). this lack of statistical evidence could be due to a lack of power given the small overall number of study sites and some variability among fragments and among anp sites.

demographic history
the mismatch distributions were not significantly different from those expected under one spatial expansion  for any of the samples . the visual inspection of the distributions, however, revealed three distinct peaks, despite the relative raggedness of the mismatches for single samples . the presence of three modes was particularly clear when all samples of irs <dig> were grouped together to increase sample size . the first mode was located at zero pairwise differences and was visible in all samples and in the expected distribution generated by the simulation of one spatial expansion . the second mode ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> pairwise differences and the third from  <dig> to  <dig> pairwise differences. only two of the three modes observed in the data were produced in simulations of one spatial expansion , either the first and the second or the first and the third . this pattern indicates that a more complex model is necessary to better fit the data, suggesting that two spatial expansions separated by a period of demographic contraction may be more accurate . as no specific statistical test is available to determine if a mismatch distribution fits the model  <dig>  we tested this hypothesis using simulations.

tau: age estimator for the expansion   <cit> .

as shown in figure 3b, the two simulated successive expansions did indeed produce three modes which can be explained by three main phases of coalescence. going backward in time these phases can be described using the terminology that wakeley  <cit>  used to describe the coalescent in structured models: they are called the "scattering" and the "collecting" phases . s is characterized by a series of recent coalescent events which correspond to individuals in the sample that are related . the two older phases  correspond to the "collecting phases" which occur at the level of the metapopulation, and in our case during the spatial contraction . they correspond to the alleles whose common ancestor can be traced to the time of the range expansion . in a widely distributed but randomly mating population, coalescent events are rare and randomly distributed in time , but during a range expansion from one region, many coalescent events occur around the time of the expansion because individuals are restricted to a smaller geographic area. in the simulated model  <dig>  the three main periods of coalescence translate into three modes in the mismatch distribution. in the gene genealogy , we thus see that if one population expands during two separate periods, we can expect to observe two collecting phases, which will generate mismatch distributions similar to those observed in the dataset . note that when looking at single simulations instead of the average distribution, the three modes are not always clearly visible together . this result fits well with our observed mismatch distributions for single samples .

genetic differentiation between populations
pairwise Φst values ranged widely from  <dig> to  <dig>  but most values  were above  <dig>  and only seven were not significant . therefore, the sites can be generally regarded as genetically differentiated from each other. genetic  and geographic distances  were significantly and positively correlated in the irs <dig>  suggesting the existence of isolation-by-distance within irs <dig> 

influence of the mahajamba river
the importance of the mahajamba river as a barrier to gene flow between irs <dig> and irs <dig> was tested with an amova and with permutation tests. all variance components and fixation indices were large and significantly different from zero. the highest proportion of the molecular variance  was explained by the variations between sites within each irs while  <dig> % is explained by the river . these values should be interpreted with care, however, since we only had two samples in irs <dig> which are almost fixed for very different haplotypes. the permutation tests showed that average Φst values across the mahajamba river were significantly higher than those between samples from the same side of the river , but we note that some pairwise Φst values between populations from the same side of the river were also very high .

influence of forest fragmentation
pairwise Φst values were significantly higher between populations separated by a savannah  than between populations separated by a "continuous" forest habitat . this was confirmed by the analysis of the residuals, which were significantly higher for samples separated by savannah stretches. this suggests that populations separated by savannah stretches are more prone to drift than those within the anp, probably due to the more limited size of the fragments they live in.

genetic structure by haplotype network
thirteen of  <dig> haplotypes  were shared among several sites . these sites were all located within the anp with the exception of the ste marie fragment which shared all its haplotypes with different anp populations. ste marie, however, is located only  <dig> km from the anp. within the anp, haplotype sharing mostly occurred between neighbouring sites. the remaining four forest fragments had only private haplotypes.

the network analysis revealed three distinct sets of haplotypes which were separated by more than  <dig> mutation steps from each other . the first set was within irs <dig>  it contained  <dig> different haplotypes which showed 1- <dig> pairwise differences, and could be grouped into four clusters separated by more than  <dig> mutational steps. even though the most divergent haplotypes are very different, there are many intermediate haplotypes. the other haplotypes were located within the irs <dig> and were separated by at least  <dig> mutation steps from each other and by 24- <dig> mutations from the closest irs <dig> haplotype. one haplotype was limited to maroakata and the other three to tsinjomitondraka. in contrast, the spatial structure was not as obvious within the irs <dig>  as haplotypes observed within one site were not always more similar to each other than to haplotypes from other sites. however, a spatial structure was revealed after mapping the representation of the four clusters in irs <dig> . the sites in the anp could be partitioned into a homogenous western and eastern division, respectively, and a zone of heterogeneous composition in the centre. the four westernmost sites in the anp  mainly contained haplotypes of cluster  <dig>  whereas the four eastern sites in the anp  and the fragment mangatelo mainly contained haplotypes of cluster  <dig>  haplotypes of cluster  <dig> were only found in three heterogeneous central park populations  and the two fragments ste marie and tanambao. finally, cluster  <dig> which consists of one haplotype, was only present in the northernmost fragment tanambao.

discussion
this study provides evidence for two successive spatial expansions of m. murinus in northwestern madagascar  but could also demonstrate some effects of forest fragmentation, geographic distance and the large river mahajamba on the genetic structure of this widely distributed mouse lemur species. these anthropogenic and environmental effects shall be discussed first, before we move to the phylogeographic processes.

effects of forest fragmentation and environmental features on genetic diversity and genetic structure
our results suggest that forest fragmentation significantly increased genetic drift in the isolated fragments. however, even though the genetic diversity of samples from the anp was generally high, the difference with isolated fragments was not significant. this suggests that a larger dataset  would be required to draw stronger conclusions about the effect of forest fragmentation on the diversity of m. murinus. when compared to the sympatric m. ravelobensis, the number of haplotypes and the haplotype diversity per site were not significantly different . therefore, the effect of fragmentation on genetic diversity can be assumed to be similar in both species.

besides affecting the genetic diversity within populations, fragmentation also increased the genetic differentiation between them beyond the effects of isolation-by-distance which was also detected. the average Φst values between sites isolated by savannah were significantly higher than those between sites from the anp  despite comparable geographic distances. furthermore, haplotype sharing was typically not observed between isolated fragments but only between sites in the anp. the only exception was ste marie that shared its four haplotypes with different park populations. it must be emphasized, though, that ste marie is separated from the anp only by a  <dig> km stretch of savannah. surprisingly, a previous study on m. ravelobensis in ste marie did not find haplotype sharing with anp populations  <cit> . these differences in their genetic diversity may be the result of divergent colonization histories or of different migration abilities during the fragmentation process.

our study provides evidence for a significant influence of the mahajamba river on genetic differentiation but not as high as in their reddish sister species. guschanski et al.  <cit>  found that  <dig> % of the molecular variance in the reddish mouse lemurs of northwestern madagascar was explained by the sofia and mahajamba rivers, while we found that the mahajamba river explained only 32% of the molecular variation in m murinus. note that at that time m. ravelobensis and m. bongolavensis specimen were still believed to form two clades within the same species. d-loop haplotypes from the western or eastern side of the river mahajamba differed in more than  <dig> base pairs  <cit> , compared to the minimum of  <dig> bp differences found in this study for m. murinus. a later study showed that the two reddish clades had already diverged into two separate species and that the river had probably promoted this speciation event  <cit> . this comparative evidence suggests that either the common ancestors of the reddish mouse lemur species colonized the irs <dig> and irs <dig> earlier than m. murinus or that m. murinus possesses larger migratory abilities that sustain gene flow between the irss , counteracting genetic drift on both sides of the river. the latter explanation seems to be less likely, since the haplotypes of either side of the river have diverged completely, indicating that the river effectively prevents gene flow between the irss. a later arrival of m. murinus in the northwest compared to the ancestors of m. ravelobensis and m. bongolavensis would also explain why the grey mouse lemur clade did not yet undergo speciation in these two irss. ultimately, this barrier function of the river may be sufficient so that populations in the two irss may eventually diverge into distinct species.

taken together, the amova and the network analyses suggest that the genetic differentiation in m. murinus within irs <dig> and irs <dig> reached levels comparable to the ones existing between the irss. this may indicate that the genetic lineages within the irss have diverged very early during the colonization process or that they result from several colonization events. these hypotheses are discussed in the next section.

signatures of a recent colonization history
assuming a pleistocene colonization scenario which is suggested by its recent date of divergence  from its southern sister species  <cit> , we predicted that populations might still show signs of the initial spatial expansion into the irs <dig>  the occurrence of a range expansion was confirmed by our spatial analyses, as none of the samples significantly rejected the hypothesis of spatial expansion . surprisingly, most samples pointed to only one of the two different periods of expansion. our modelling approach  showed that two successive spatial expansions in small-sized populations generate a trimodal distribution similar to the observed distributions. it may be surprising that model  <dig> is not significantly rejected even when there are three modes in the mismatch distribution. this can be explained by the fact that the test is always picking up the bigger of the two last modes as a signal of spatial expansion, without considering the smaller one . the estimations for the age of the expansion  also correspond to this largest mode. the fact that only very few tajima's d and no fu's fs values were significantly negative, may seem contradictory to the mismatch distribution results. this apparent contradiction may be explained by the lower statistical power of these statistics compared to mismatch distributions to detect spatial expansions when local demes exchange only few migrants  as demonstrated theoretically  <cit>  and empirically in the eastern tiger salamander  <cit> . this is also confirmed by our simulations of the double expansion where only  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the respective tajima's d and fu's fs were negative and only  <dig> % and  <dig> % of those values were significant. furthermore, a very recent simulation study by städler et al.  <cit>  confirmed that even when populations are undergoing a very important spatial expansion, tajima's d can exhibit positive values . finally, these tests may also be affected by the recent fragmentation as noted above. altogether, these analyses show the limitations of single statistics such as tajima's d and fu's fs to detect demographic events when more than one such event has taken place  <cit> .

the fact that we pick up the signals of spatial expansions in the mismatch analyses suggests that they took place relatively recently. it has already been suggested that the malagasy forest habitats underwent severe changes during the pleistocene due to climatic changes associated with the glacial and interglacial periods  <cit> . together with the estimate of  <dig>  my for the last common ancestor of m. murinus  <cit> , it seems likely that m. murinus may have colonized the irss at its northern distribution range in the second half of the pleistocene.

based on the modes of the observed mismatch distributions expected under a spatial expansion model, it is possible to calculate rough estimates for the dates of these two successive spatial expansions. assuming a constant mutation rate of 10- <dig> per site per generation  and using the range of modes obtained for the samples, we can calculate the time of the expansions as tau*/, where tau* is the mode of the mismatch distribution and mu is the mutation rate for the whole sequence. the first expansion was thereby estimated to have occurred between  <dig>  to  <dig>  years ago . the more recent expansion would then have taken place between  <dig>  and  <dig>  years ago . these estimations suggest that two recent expansions took place rather recently, one before and one after the last glacial maximum . apparently, some populations have kept memory of the older and others of the more recent expansion, as was predicted by our simulations .

CONCLUSIONS
given the results of this study, the following scenario for the colonization of irs <dig> by m. murinus is proposed: one ancestral population of m. murinus colonized the irs <dig> probably before the last glacial maximum . m. murinus may then have retreated when forests contracted during the dry period associated with the lgm towards the persisting riverine forests along the mahajamba and betsiboka. it subsequently re-colonized the area  in a period of recent forest expansion following the lgm. this second spatial expansion is supported by the detection of a contact zone with high haplotype diversity, which parallels the events that were described in several other species as a result of postglacial expansions with subsequent admixture  <cit> . this contact zone is running through some central sites which exhibit haplotypes from three different haplotypes clusters. this interesting and new hypothesis deserves further investigations and needs to be formally tested in the future. in particular, the results obtained with our mtdna dataset must be confirmed and complemented by other markers, such as nuclear strs. moreover, more refined simulation work taking into account different factors such as environmental heterogeneity or uncertainties about the mutation rate is needed to better define and date these processes. indeed, no reliable estimate for the mutation rate is currently available for mouse lemurs. using a mutation rate of 10- <dig>  <cit> , for example, would increase the age of the expansions by one order of magnitude . although such a shift would still indicate a late pleistocene dynamics, a reliable dating of these colonization processes would enable us to understand in more detail the evolution of madagascar's extraordinary biodiversity and the underlying driving forces of diversification. so far, most studies have emphasized the ancient processes that triggered the many radiations that occurred on this island  <cit> . this is the first study detecting a potential genetic signature of late pleistocene and maybe even postglacial biogeographic dynamics on this mini-continent. the further exploration of modern molecular modelling approaches may ultimately allow us to judge upon the relative importance of certain pleistocene climate changes for the development of the biogeographic pattern that we can observe today. mouse lemurs are an extremely suitable model to explore these processes across all madagascar.
