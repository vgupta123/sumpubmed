BACKGROUND
advances in next-generation sequencing methodologies have significantly reduced the time and cost constraints of determining genome-wide expression levels of various organisms, including bacteria. these technologies present major advantages over hybridization-based microarrays  <cit> . along with high throughput, they allow single-nucleotide resolution as well as quantification of absolute rna abundance. these benefits combined with strand-specificity and greater dynamic range in gene expression measurement have provided great insight into the transcriptional landscape of various bacteria under different growth conditions  <cit> . however, no deep rna sequencing  studies have so far reported a transcriptome analysis of a bacterial cell cycle, which would provide an important step toward understanding the genetic pathways involved in bacterial multiplication.

the ease of obtaining synchronized cell populations of the gram-negative bacterium caulobacter crescentus through a physical method  <cit>  has made this organism a prominent bacterial model for analyzing the cell cycle  <cit> . the cell cycle of c. crescentus has also generated interest because of its inherent association with a developmental process  <cit> . each division produces two distinct daughter cells: a flagellated and piliated “swarmer”  progeny and a slightly longer, stalk-containing “stalked”  progeny . sw cells, which can be isolated from an asynchronous culture using a simple gradient centrifugation method  <cit> , are in g <dig> phase as they cannot replicate their single chromosome until they grow to a similar size to their st siblings  <cit> . following flagellum ejection and pili retraction, dna replication initiates and a polar stalk develops to produce a st cell . after some growth, cell constriction is initiated and a new flagellum is built at the pole opposite to the stalk. completion of cytokinesis followed by cell separation results in the production of the sw and st progeny. the sw cell then reiterates the aforementioned cell cycle whereas the st cell skips the g <dig> phase and initiates the s phase immediately.

decades of single-gene studies in c. crescentus have uncovered regulatory components and molecular mechanisms that govern the cell cycle and the spatial and temporal biogenesis of different organelles and molecular machineries. following the resolution of the c. crescentus genome  <cit> , a variety of “omics” and modeling studies have been undertaken to understand the c. crescentus cell cycle at a system level  <cit> . important studies have led the way to understanding the transcriptional cascades generated by the oscillatory expression of cell cycle master regulators  <cit> .

in this work, we took advantage of the benefits of rna-seq to provide absolute measures of gene expression during the c. crescentus cell cycle, using biological replicates for each cell cycle stage. we uncovered novel properties of gene expression and regulation, identified over  <dig>  cell cycle-regulated genes, and organized them into a co-expression network. furthermore, we expanded phylogenomics  <cit>  to co-expression network study by comparing network and gene evolutionary properties, and discovered strong correlations between co-expression and evolution.

RESULTS
single-nucleotide resolution whole-genome mapping of rna-seq
to examine the cell cycle transcriptome of c. crescentus, cells grown in the m2g minimal medium were subjected to ludox  density centrifugation to isolate swarmer  cells, which were then re-suspended in m2g medium to resume cell cycle progression synchronously. samples were collected for rna extraction at  <dig> different time points  following synchronization, with each time point corresponding to a different cell cycle stage referred to as swarmer , stalked , early predivisional , predivisional , and late predivisional  . by performing synchronies on different days, we obtained a total of three biological replicates of each cell cycle stage. the extracted rnas were labeled in a strand-specific manner and sequenced using the solid platform. in total, we obtained over  <dig> million  solid rna-seq reads. fifty bp-long reads were trimmed of 10 bp from the 3′ end, and 300 m of these reads were mapped on the genome of c. crescentus na <dig> . this resulted in a single nucleotide resolution transcriptome composed of  <dig> sets of mappings with a sum of 962x coverage per nucleotide. figure 2a shows a bird’s eye view of the whole transcriptome, and figure 2b shows the rna-seq mapping details of the two asparagine trnas, both using the sw cell stage as an example. when comparing biological replicates, we found that, in some regions, the mapping was less consistent than in others, and that the regions of low consistency were correlated with enriched gc content , as previously reported  <cit> . since the c. crescentus genome is gc-rich , traditional quantitative methods such as calculating mean coverage on genes or rpkm  may reduce the accuracy of gene expression quantification  <cit> . therefore, we employed a dynamic segmentation algorithm based on coefficient of variation  analysis of the replicates to locate and discard low consistency mapping regions, and we only used the highly reliable mapping regions to calculate gene expression values . the level of gene expression was then calculated as the average coverage of retained nucleotides within the gene. with this quantification method, we obtained an average coverage of 278x  for gene expression. we found that the distribution of gene expression for each cell cycle stage follows a power-law distribution , in agreement with the evolutionary conserved power-law organization of genome-wide expression levels  <cit> . the whole transcriptome data, with raw mapping results and normalized gene expression values, are provided in additional files  <dig>   <dig>  4: table s1a-c.

genes cluster into three groups according to their expression level
past rna-seq studies have shown that the distribution of expression levels in bacteria is continuous, without an obvious breaking point between background transcription and biologically relevant expression  <cit> . while this continuum in gene expression levels was confirmed in our study , we found that cv analysis of replicates as a function of gene expression can identify global patterns of gene expression and regulation . the cv, which is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, was used here as a convenient way to quantify both “signal”, from regulated expression, and “noise”, from background transcriptional activity. background transcription due to random binding of the rna polymerase is expected to generate low amounts of rna and to be poorly consistent across replicates, thereby generating a high cv value. conversely, transcription that is biologically relevant should have higher expression and lower cv value, the latter because of a higher reproducibility between biological replicates. plotting the cv values for all genes as a function of their average expression  reveals that the genes fall into three groups. the first group consists of  <dig> genes, or almost a fifth of the genome, that have a low expression level  and an average cv value of  <dig> . in this group , the cv negatively correlates with expression . this negative correlation no longer exists for other genes with expression values above 5x. the enrichment of high cv values for genes with expression values below 5x suggests that it includes transcriptional noise. while small integers tend to generate higher cv values, gene phylogeny and essentiality analyses  further support the notion that this first group primarily includes background transcription. in figure 3a, the cv curve reaches a plateau at about  <dig>  for expression values between 5x and 1000x. this plateau defines the second group of genes, which consists of  <dig>  genes or 79% of the c. crescentus genome. the constant low cv value suggests that expressions of most genes follow the same shape of distribution and are under precise biological regulation. interestingly, the cv curve slightly increases when the expression levels rise above 1000x. this third group of genes, which consists of  <dig> highly expressed genes , had an average cv of  <dig> . a statistical test  confirmed that this group of genes indeed had higher cv values than the second group, which includes the majority of genes. fifty-four of the  <dig> highly expressed genes are non-coding rnas . when we considered these  <dig> rnas alone, their average cv increased to  <dig> , suggesting that these highly expressed rnas may be under less stringent regulation than most genes; while they have strong promoters, the cells may not  have an efficient mechanism to maintain the precise amount of such rna species within the cell.

a recent genome-wide transposon insertion study in c. crescentus has identified  <dig> essential or high-fitness-cost genes  <cit> . as shown in figure 3b, we found that gene essentiality is correlated with gene expression as the essential genes generally had higher expression values  than non-essential genes , with the high-fitness-cost genes having intermediate values . only  <dig> essential and  <dig> high-fitness-cost genes fell to the group of poorly expressed genes . their essentiality was determined based on colony formation on solid rich growth medium  <cit> . the low expression levels of these genes under our experimental conditions  suggests that their essentiality may be specific to growth conditions.

gene essentiality as determined by laboratory mutagenesis are dependent on experimental contexts, and only identifies genes whose inactivation results in rapid lethality or high-fitness cost under the tested conditions. on the other hand, gene persistence, which measures how widely conserved a gene is among extant species  <cit> , informs about the importance of a gene in natural environments, with competitions, under harsh conditions, and over  <dig> billion years of natural evolution  <cit> . therefore, we also compared the gene expression levels with evolutionary gene persistence. to obtain a persistence index   <cit>  of each c. crescentus gene, we first determined the distribution of orthologs among  <dig> bacterial species selected to represent an unbiased phylogenetic tree . the expression level of each gene was then plotted as a function of its pi , with pi> <dig> and pi< <dig> used as borders to distinguish “persistent” genes that have been retained in most species during evolution  from the “less conserved” genes . we found that poorly expressed genes, as a group, have been poorly conserved during evolution as among the  <dig> genes with low expression ,  <dig> of them  had pi< <dig>  and only  <dig> poorly expressed genes had a pi> <dig> . when considering all genes, chi-square test clearly showed that as expected  <cit> , the persistent genes overall display a higher expression than less conserved genes . the positive correlation between expression and persistence in very broadly conserved genes  is in good agreement with the toolbox model of bacterial evolution  <cit> . interestingly, however, we observed a few highly expressed  genes that were present almost equally among both persistent and poorly conserved genes . in fact, when we only examined highly expressed  genes, there was no longer a correlation between pi values and expression levels . this indicates once again that highly expressed genes tend to behave distinctly from the rest of the genome; they are under different regulatory and evolutionary constraints than most genes.

identification of  <dig>  differentially expressed genes
to identify cell cycle-regulated  genes, we used the bayseq package. this program took the gene expression values from the biological replicates across the  <dig> cell cycle time points, and estimated posterior likelihoods of differential expression via an empirical bayesian method  <cit> . through this analysis , we identified  <dig>  genes  that we will hereafter refer to as ccr genes. we note that a small fraction of our ccr genes are likely to be false positives due to the potential stresses  associated with the cell cycle synchronization technique . most genes whose transcription is induced with the method are expected to display a peak expression in the first time point  with a lower expression profile in subsequent time point samples. the presence of these method-induced genes does not, however, affect our conclusions because we obtain similar results when the whole set of sw/g1-specific genes is excluded from all the analyses .

a variety of cell cycle expression patterns were observed among the  <dig>  ccr genes . for verification, we used  <dig> experimentally identified ccr genes as a gold reference . all of these genes were correctly assigned as ccr genes in our analysis. we also compared our list of ccr genes with two previously reported ccr gene sets obtained from dna microarray studies that used the same synchronization technique  <cit> . these two sets include  <dig> and  <dig> genes, with an overlap of  <dig> genes. the reason of the relatively small gene overlap between these two sets is unclear and may be attributed to differences in methods used, or to a lack of experimental replicates in these studies. combining these two ccr gene lists results in a set of  <dig> genes, and  <dig>  of them are reported in our new ccr list. importantly, because our study includes biological replicates, the bayseq likelihood value from  <dig> to  <dig> provides a measure of confidence in cell cycle expression for each ccr gene . this information is useful because, while there is a positive correlation between the fold of change in expression and the likelihood, small differences in expression level during the cell cycle can be associated with high likelihood values , indicating that they are highly reliable.

in general, the level of peak gene expression does not appear to influence the bayseq likelihood values . among the  <dig>  ccr genes that we identified, 84%  of them had expression changes >  <dig> fold . the maximal fold of change in cell-cycle expression was over  <dig>  and the mean was  <dig> . in terms of peak expression, 96%  ccr genes had coverage > 5x  and therefore, are likely above background transcription.

among the ccr genes,  <dig> were annotated non-coding rnas  . for example, the expression of ccna_r <dig> varies by 23-fold during the cell cycle, with a peak expression of ~1550x . the remaining ccr genes  were predicted to encode proteins whose ontology we surveyed. using the uniprot-goa data set, which includes  <dig>  c. crescentus na <dig> genes  <cit> , we obtained the gene ontology  annotation for  <dig>  protein-encoding ccr genes . in a previous microarray study,  <dig> metabolism-related genes had been reported to change their expression during the c. crescentus cell cycle  <cit> . in our ccr gene dataset,  <dig> genes were assigned under primary metabolic process category, and  <dig> genes were annotated as cellular metabolic process. these two go terms included a total of  <dig> ccr genes, indicating that over one third of all ccr genes are related to metabolic functions. a total of  <dig>  genes of the c. crescentus genome are classified under primary and cellular metabolic processes based on uniprot-goa  <cit> . thus, over 40% of them display differential cell cycle expression under our conditions. this is surprising as metabolic genes are often thought of as housekeeping genes and as such, are expected to be constitutively expressed during the cell cycle. their cell cycle regulation suggests potential fluxes of primary metabolites during the cell cycle.

go term enrichment analysis that compares ccr with non-ccr genes revealed over-representations and under-representations of genes with particular go terms . for example, genes associated with flagellar motility, chemotaxis, division and dna synthesis were enriched among ccr genes, consistent with their known cell cycle regulation. genes encoding two-component signal transduction proteins  were also significantly enriched among ccr protein-encoding genes, while genes encoding sequence-specific dna-binding proteins  were overall under-represented. in addition, this analysis showed that some metabolic pathways  were over-represented in terms of cell cycle regulation while others  were under-represented.

five-hundred forty-one ccr genes did not have a go term and these genes were in general less conserved across the phylogenetic tree than the  <dig>  ccr genes with go terms based on pi distributions . however, a subset of them  were subject to strong selective pressure with pi >  <dig> . these conserved genes are interesting candidates for future cell cycle studies.

cell cycle co-expression network and modules
since genes with correlated expression profiles can suggest correlations in biological function or regulatory mechanism, we used weighted gene correlation network analysis   <cit>  to determine co-expression profiles among the  <dig>  identified ccr genes. from this analysis, we were able to cluster the ccr genes into  <dig> modules. each module contains genes with similar cell cycle expression profiles, and the overall expression profile of each module can be represented by the first eigenvector of the module. on average, the first eigenvector was able to explain over 85% of the total variance, with even the worst case  still explaining 78% of the total variance .

figure 6a shows one of the modules as an example, with each node representing a specific gene of the module and with the size of the node being proportional to its contribution to the module . the edges between genes  indicate connectivity; wider lines indicate stronger connectivity and are indicative of greater similarity in cell cycle expression profile between the two connected genes. all  <dig> modules are displayed in additional file 13: figure s <dig>  we used the eigenvectors to cluster the  <dig> modules according to their cell cycle expression profiles to examine the relationship between the  <dig> modules . this clustering analysis, by and large, resulted in three large groups with peak expression primarily at the sw, st or pd cell cycle stage .

individual modules can be searched for functional relationships among genes, and this search can be broadened to modules with similar expression profiles  to identify functionally related genes. for example, genes involved in the assimilation of sulfur into cysteine are among the strongest contributors of the magenta module , with changes in expression up to 130-fold and with peaks of expression in the st and epd cell cycle stages . aside from its use in protein synthesis, cysteine is the primary donor of sulfur in the metabolism of a variety of sulfur-containing compounds, including methionine, s-adenosylmethionine , coenzyme a, glutathione, thiamine, lipoic acid, cobalamin, biotin, molybdenum cofactor, and iron-sulfur clusters  <cit> .

when we examined co-expression modules that cluster with the magenta module because of their similarity in cell cycle expression pattern, we identified genes from pathways tangential to cysteine synthesis. using this strategy, we were able to identify the metabolic network involved in cysteine, methionine, serine, glycine, glutathione, and sam synthesis . the entire network is created from  <dig> genes, expressed from at least  <dig> transcriptional units . of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> display differential cell cycle expression, and most are up-regulated at the st and/or epd cell time point . thus, gene and module clustering can be used to infer functional coupling between genes and pathways.

cell cycle transcriptome analysis from an evolutionary perspective
in terms of gene persistence, ccr genes and non-ccr genes showed no differences . however, the contribution of each ccr gene in forming a co-expression module was not equal, with the persistent genes  being more prone to be major contributors compared to the rest of ccr genes . in other words, ccr genes that are widely conserved across bacterial phyla tend to determine the expression profile of their module, suggesting that evolution plays a role in shaping gene co-expression networks.

previous studies have shown a correlation between co-expression and co-evolution by examining conserved synteny and/or co-expression of conserved gene pairs across different organisms,  <cit> . we were therefore interested in understanding the link between co-expression and evolutionary relatedness from the perspective of a model organism’s biological network by leveraging our co-expression modules. for each module, we computed the phylogeny clustering of its member genes  using the k-statistics  <cit>  in the picante package  <cit> . sixty-nine  modules had strong phylogenetic signals ; that is, the genes in these  <dig> modules are phylogenetically clustered . to more precisely study this phylogenetic clustering, we calculated the mean pairwise distance  and mean nearest taxon distance  values using picante. the mpd value can provide a measure of the phylogenetic tree-wide patterns of clustering. mntd is, on the other hand, more sensitive to clustering closer to the tips of the phylogenetic tree  <cit> . for example, some genes may be randomly distributed across the tree, but phylogenetically clustered near the tips. mntd would show a significant value for such clustering. genes that are specific to species or to narrow clades will also show significant mntd values. the distribution of mpd and mntd z scores are shown in figure 8a. we found that values ≤ - <dig> for both mpd and mntd z scores are significant . hence, we divided the mpd and mntd coordinates into  <dig> quadrants using the cut-off value - <dig> . forty-nine  modules in quadrants  <dig> and  <dig> display tree-wide clustering; the salmon module is such an example . eleven modules in quadrant  <dig> are more likely to be clade- or species-specific modules; the yellowgreen module provides an example . the evolutionary profile of each module is provided in additional file 19: figure s <dig>  whereas the mpd and mntd z scores are listed in additional file 18: table s <dig> 

collectively, these phylogenetic analyses suggest that gene conservation and co-expression are highly correlated: broadly conserved genes presumably organized into functional modules in ancestral species and have co-evolved as groups into many extant organisms, whereas narrowly conserved genes tend to be co-expressed together as clade- or species-specific modules. understanding the mechanism that drives co-expressed genes to co-evolve, or co-evolved genes to be co-expressed, will be of great interest, as it is beyond the influence of operon organization  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we leveraged the cv analysis of biological replicates to refine our expression measurements and to correct systematic biases associated with gc-rich genomes. using this strategy, we identified three global patterns of gene expression that appear to be under distinct regulatory constraints. by integrating two popular tools, wgcna and bayseq, we generated a list of ccr genes and identified previously unknown relationships between these ccr genes. through phylogenetic analysis of expression network modules, we found a correlation between stronger co-expression and broader conservation of genes. by investigating the evolutionary profiles of the modules and their mpd/mntd coordinates, we found that most  modules with strong tree-level clustering were dominated by widely conserved genes, and that  <dig> modules with strong tip-level clustering were dominated by clade-specific genes. in total, this accounted for 79% of the  <dig> modules, which argues that evolutionary profiles are highly related to gene co-expressions and that evolution has shaped the cell cycle expression network. this further implies that selective pressure is not on single genes but rather on the relationships between genes , emphasizing the value of including phylogenetic analysis to the study of gene co-expression networks.
