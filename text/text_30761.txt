BACKGROUND
the proper functioning of a cell is facilitated by a precise regulation of protein levels, which in turn is maintained by a balance between the rates of protein synthesis and degradation. protein degradation mediated by proteolysis is an important mechanism for recycling of the amino acids into the cellular pool and to possibly generate energy during starvation. proteins like enzymes, transcription factors, receptors, structural proteins etc. require proteolytic processing for activation or functional changes. proteolysis also contributes to the timely inactivation of proteins and is a major biological regulatory mechanism in living systems  <cit> .

serine proteases are ubiquitous enzymes with a nucleophilic ser residue at the active site and believed to constitute nearly one-third of all the known proteolytic enzymes. they include exopeptidases and endopeptidases belonging to different protein families grouped into clans. over  <dig> serine protease families are currently classified by merops  <cit> . they function in diverse biological processes such as digestion, blood clotting, fertilisation, development, complement activation, pathogenesis, apoptosis, immune response, secondary metabolism, with imbalances causing diseases like arthritis and tumors  <cit> . thus, many serine proteases and their substrates are attractive targets for therapeutic drug design.

proteases play a significant role in adaptive responses of prokaryotes to changes in their extracellular environment by facilitating restructuring of their proteomes. prokaryotic serine proteases are involved in several physiological processes associated with cell signalling, defense response and development  <cit> . degp proteases belonging to the trypsin family have been implicated in heat shock response  <cit> , subtilisins in growth and defense response in several bacteria  <cit> , in nutrition and host invasion  <cit> , serine β-lactamases in helping certain bacteria acquire resistance to β-lactam antibiotics  <cit>  and clp and lon proteases in the removal of the misfolded proteins  <cit> . in addition, serine proteases are required for virulence in many pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . however, an understanding of the biological functions of large numbers of prokaryotic serine proteases remains elusive. a better understanding of their distribution and evolution in the prokaryotic lineages would help unravel their potential roles in the various cellular processes including pathogenesis and help develop effective antibacterial therapies. therefore, five serine protease families- trypsin , subtilisins , dd-peptidases , clp proteases  and lon proteases , which have been implicated in diverse physiological processes in prokaryotes and represent some of the independent evolutionary lineages of the serine proteases were chosen as the model representatives for a genome-wide survey in select prokaryotic genomes.

the availability of the complete protein sequences of several bacterial and archaeal species makes it possible to carry out a comprehensive analysis to examine the complexity and the evolutionary relationships between the serine protease families and identify new proteolytic components in prokaryotes. bioinformatics searches for the serine protease-like proteins belonging to the five serine protease families were performed in the  <dig> representative prokaryotic genomes  for which complete genomic data are available, using various sensitive sequence search methods. manual analysis was performed for serine proteases, identified above, to assess the presence or absence of key residues responsible for catalysis and substrate specificity. in several serine proteases, adjacent domains are often responsible for substrate specificity and/or involvement of serine proteases into specific physiological pathways. therefore, the domain organisations of the putative serine proteases predicted based on the sequence similarity were analysed to understand their evolution and the probable biological roles.

methods
search for serine proteases in prokaryotic genomes
complete proteomes for the  <dig> representative prokaryotic species were obtained from ncbi  <cit> . to facilitate the coverage of the serine protease repertoire in diverse genotypes, the proteomes of the select prokaryotes representing the different taxonomic lineages in prokaryotes and occupying diverse ecological niches were chosen for the analysis. these include extremophiles ; commercially significant microorganisms ; pathogenic prokaryotes that infect bacteria, insects, plants, animals and humans , symbiotic prokaryotes , model organisms  etc. a search for serine proteases was performed using blastp  <cit>  on the prokaryotic proteomes, using sequences for each serine protease family, as classified by merops  <cit>  for preliminary queries, complemented by a multi-fold approach that employs sensitive sequence search methods such as hmmpfam  <cit>  and rps-blast  <cit>  as described previously  <cit> .

relative densities of distribution of serine proteases in prokaryotic genomes
the relative abundance of the five serine protease families in various prokaryotic lineages was also examined in the form of their relative densities. relative density is defined here as the total number of serine proteases identified in a taxonomic lineage divided by the total number of genomes of that lineage considered for the study. comparison of relative density values provides insights into the relative significance of the five serine protease families in different prokaryotic lineages, which in combination with the data from other sources such as phylogeny and domain architectures can provide useful insights into their probable functional associations.

identification of co-existing domains in prokaryotic serine proteases
co-existing domains were predicted using hmmpfam of the hmmer suite  <cit> . each serine protease sequence was matched to the dataset of hidden markov models  obtained from the pfama database  <cit>  with the e-value thresholds set to  <dig>   <cit> . conservation of the domain architectures across the lineages was examined with ncbi-cdart  <cit>  and pfam  <cit> .

multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
multiple sequence alignments of the serine protease domains were performed using clustalw  <cit> ; an overall phylogenetic tree was inferred from the multiple sequence alignment with phylip   <cit>  and phylogenetic analysis was performed as described previously  <cit> . representations of the calculated trees were constructed using mega program  <cit> . clusters with bootstrap values greater than 50% were defined as confirmed subgroups and sequences with lower values added to these subgroups according to their sequence similarity in the alignment as judged by visual inspection.

RESULTS
distribution of the five serine protease families in the prokaryotic genomes
a total of  <dig> serine proteases belonging to the five serine protease families were identified in the  <dig> prokaryotic genomes for which the complete genomic data is available. these include  <dig> putative catalytically inactive serine protease homologues  that either lack the amino acid residues essential for catalysis or carry amino acid substitutions at those positions. such inactive enzyme homologues are present in many enzyme families and are believed to acquire newer functions during evolution  <cit>  . trypsin , subtilisin  and d-ala-d-ala carboxypeptidase   families were found to have a higher number of representatives than clp protease  and lon protease  families . the five serine protease families have a relatively lower representation in the archaeal genomes than the bacterial genomes. however, the relative densities  of subtilisin and lon protease families  in archaeal genomes are much higher than other three families  . the dd-peptidase family shows maximum abundance in the alphaproteobacteria , while trypsins, subtilisins and clp proteases have higher number of representatives in the actinobacteria  and lon proteases in the gammaproteobacteria . higher densities for trypsins, subtilisins and lon proteases are observed in the delatproteobacteria, largely due to only two deltaproteobacteria genomes considered for the present analysis and the overrepresentation of the trypsins and the subtilisins in bdellovibrio_bacteriovorus. high representations of some serine proteases were observed in other genomes such as streptomyces avermitilis, indicating specific requirements . expansion of the specific protein families and/or superfamilies often occurs as a consequence of specialisation of an organism for its environmental niche and an investigation of the relative abundance of the specific protein families within the different prokaryotic species is likely to provide useful insights into their evolution and specialisation  <cit> . thus, higher representation of the trypsin, subtilisin and the dd-peptidase families suggests the evolution of specialised functions for the gene products corresponding to the three families in many representative species chosen for the present analysis . putative serine proteases thus, identified, were further analysed for the presence of the co-existing domains. the occurrence, the domain organisation and the phylogenetic patterns of the select serine protease domains in the specific prokaryotic genomes are discussed below.

trypsin 
trypsins  constitute the largest group of proteolytic enzymes that display diverse specificities and function as endopeptidases. their catalytic apparatus consists of the conserved asp-his-ser "charge relay" system, called the catalytic triad. this triad was initially identified in trypsin-like serine proteases and later found in the other distinct folds such as subtilisins, serine carboxypeptidases and clp proteases, though the catalytic residues occur in a different order in their sequences: a typical example of convergent evolution of the same biochemical mechanism in structurally distinct folds  <cit> . broadly, three main activity types for cleavage of amide substrates have been recognised for this enzyme family: trypsin-like enzymes show overwhelming preference for arg/lys at the p <dig> site , chymotrypsin-like enzymes prefer aromatic amino acids at the p <dig> position, while elastase-like enzymes prefer substrates with small hydrophobic amino acids at p <dig> positions  <cit> . in prokaryotes, trypsin-like serine proteases function in diverse processes such as bacterial cell wall lysis  <cit> , heat shock response  <cit> , transcription regulation  <cit> , as toxins  <cit> , as fibrinolytic enzymes  <cit> etc.

a total of  <dig> putative trypsin-like serine proteases  were identified in the  <dig> prokaryotic genomes under study . they are well-represented in all the prokaryotic lineages considered in the present analyses, though a low representation was observed in archaeal genomes . over half of the trypsin-like proteins identified in the present study were found to be multi-domain polypeptides. a significant number of the eukaryotic trypsin-like serine proteases have been found to carry accessory domains, which are believed to contribute to their functional diversity  <cit> . this suggests that the ancillary domains in the prokaryotic trypsin homologues may contribute to diversification in their function. distribution of the trypsin-like serine proteases was not uniform across the genomes considered here . their over-representation in some species is probably a consequence of the organisms' adaptation to their environment. for instance, the highest numbers of trypsin-like proteins were identified in bdellovibrio bacteriovorus  that preys on the other gram-negative bacteria, which include plant, animal and human pathogens. the bacterium employs an extensive array of hydrolytic enzymes to invade its prey and consume the host biopolymers such as proteins. proteases constitute the largest group of such paralogous hydrolytic enzymes, strongly suggesting their significant contribution to the life cycle of the bacterium  <cit> . the present analysis reveals a high abundance of the trypsin-like proteins in bdellovibrio bacteriovorus . considering that trypsin-like serine proteases  are known to function in bacterial cell wall lysis  <cit> , it is likely that many trypsin-like proteins in bdellovibrio bacteriovorus may be associated with its predatory activities. since all but one of these trypsin-like proteins are single-domain proteins , it is likely that a precise and timely regulation of gene expression patterns may play a major role in regulating their activity  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis reveals the presence of several taxa-specific and species-specific clusters of the trypsin-like proteins in the prokaryotes . trypsin-like proteins identified in bdellovibrio bacteriovorus were found to cluster into four major groups . bdellovibrio bacteriovorus deploys its hydrolytic arsenal at three distinct stages of its lifecycle  <cit> , therefore, it is possible that various lineages of bdellovibrio bacteriovorus trypsin-like proteins identified here may represent putative components of the hydrolytic machinery that drives the bacterium's predatory lifestyle. this makes them an attractive target for further characterisation, which may help to understand their mechanism of action better and aid in the development of new anti-microbial strategies. trypsin-like proteins accompanied by colicin_v domains, which are believed to function in pathogenesis, were observed only in the gram-positive bacteria . in the phylogenetic trees constructed with the protease domains alone, all the trypsin-like proteins associated with a colicin_v domain fall into a single cluster . since co-existing domains in a multi-domain protein are often known to spatially interact with each other, the interface regions in the trypsin protease domain may acquire a pattern uniquely different from the homologous domains. phylogenetic analysis also reveals clusters of trypsin-like proteins populated by members from different taxa, providing important clues to the evolution of this gene family in prokaryotes. for instance, while the trypsin-like protein np_ <dig>  from gloeobacter violaceus co-clusters with the other trypsin-like proteins from cyanobacteria , the other trypsin-like proteins from the same genome co-cluster with trypsin-like proteins from other taxa. for example, np_ <dig>  co-clusters with np_ <dig>  from bacillus subtilis , while np_ <dig>  co-clusters with np_ <dig>  from rhodopseudomonas palustris . such occurrence may indicate a putative horizontal gene transfer of some trypsin-like proteins between gloeobacter violaceus, a cyanobacterium and the other taxa . indeed, horizontal gene transfer events have been documented between cyanobacteria and other phyla  <cit> . the abundance of the trypsin-like proteins in the prokaryotes may have partly resulted from the multiple horizontal gene transfer events between different species.

subtilisin 
subtilisins constitute the second largest family of serine proteases identified till date and known members span across eubacteria, archaebacteria, eukaryotes and viruses. subtilisins utilise a highly conserved catalytic triad similar to the members of the trypsin family, but have a different order of the asp, his and ser residues in the sequence . most members of the family exhibit broad substrate specificity, with a preference to cleave after the hydrophobic residues; however, some members of the s8b subfamily cleave peptide bonds just after dibasic amino acids  <cit> . subtilisins in prokaryotes function in diverse processes such as cellular nutrition and host invasion  <cit> , facilitating the maturation of diverse polypeptides  <cit>  such as bacteriocins like lantibiotics  <cit> , extracellular adhesins  <cit> , enzymes such as the spore cortex-lytic enzyme in clostridium perfringens  <cit> etc. most known subtilisins are multi-domain polypeptides that consist of a protease domain accompanied by one or two co-existing domains  <cit> , which also accounts for the diversity in their function.

a total of  <dig> subtilisin-like proteins  were identified in the present study . they are well represented in all the prokaryotic lineages suggesting that the subtilisin repertoires were established early in evolution . a significant number of subtilisin-like proteins were identified in bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, a predatory gram-negative bacterium  were found to fall into distinct clusters . since prokaryotic subtilisins are known to function in the physiological processes associated with pathogenesis such as host invasion  <cit> , it is likely that some subtilisin-like proteins may function as the specific components of the hydrolytic machinery employed by bdellovibrio bacteriovorus for predation on the other gram-negative bacteria  <cit> ; the presence of the co-existing domains adjacent to the protease domain in many of these subtilisin-like proteins may also influence their involvement in different pathways, which in turn may regulate the predatory lifestyle of the bacterium . a significant number of the subtilisin-like proteins were also identified in streptomyces avermitilis , a commercially important gram-positive soil bacterium known for its diversity in the production of the secondary metabolites. to facilitate this diversity, the bacterium contains several metabolic pathways for the biosynthesis of the secondary metabolites  <cit> . subtilisins are known to function as the maturation proteases for several enzymes  <cit> , and may thus, regulate the components of various metabolic pathways in streptomyces avermitilis. subtilisins are also known to function as maturation enzymes for the bacteriocin-like lantibiotics  <cit> , which are peptide antibiotics produced by the gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . it is likely that some subtilisins may process similar peptide antibiotics synthesised in streptomyces avermitilis, thereby regulating their activity. co-existing domains, associated with some subtilisin-like proteins in streptomyces avermitilis , may facilitate the involvement these gene products for a regulatory role in the different metabolic pathways or for the recognition and processing  of the various secondary metabolites. however, for the other single domain proteins , a precise and timely regulation of their transcription may play a major role in regulating their activity.

phylogenetic analysis reveals the presence of several taxa-specific and species-specific clusters of subtilisin-like proteins . subtilisin-like proteins identified in bdellovibrio bacteriovorus were found to fall into different clusters that may correspond to gene products associated with the predatory machinery of the bacterium . five major clusters of the subtilisin-like proteins in streptomyces avermitilis were also recognised, indicating the evolutionary and possibly the functional diversity of these gene products in the bacterium . like trypsins, some subtilisin-like proteins associated with the specific co-existing modules cluster together in the phylogenetic tree constructed with the subtilisin protease domain sequences alone. the subtilisin-like proteins from betaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria that are associated with the autotransporter modules were observed to cluster together . many subtilisin-like proteins from the gram-positive bacteria  that at least carry a duf <dig> module, c-terminal to the predicted protease domain, cluster together . the probable spatial interactions between the subtilisin protease domain and the adjacent modules may result in the acquisition of unique or differential patterns in the interface region of the protease domain. phylogenetic analysis also reveals some associations between subtilisins identified in different prokaryotic species that suggest probable horizontal transfer of subtilisin genes between prokaryotes. the co-clustering of a subtilisin-autotransporter gene product np_ <dig>   with similar proteins from betaproteobacteria i.e. np_ <dig>  ; np_ <dig>   and np_ <dig>  instead of the gammaproteobacteria, suggests a lateral acquisition of the former from the betaproteobacteria. archaeal subtilisins yp_ <dig>   and np_ <dig>   co-cluster with np_ <dig>   and yp_ <dig>  , while yp_ <dig>  and yp_ <dig>  , np_ <dig>   and np_ <dig>   co-cluster with np_ <dig>   and np_ <dig>   suggesting a lateral transfer of some subtilisin genes between bacteria and archaea. it is possible that the abundance of the subtilisins in the prokaryotes may have been facilitated in part by multiple horizontal gene transfer events.

d-ala-d-ala carboxypeptidase b family 
the d-ala-d-ala carboxypeptidase b  family is a diverse family that consists of proteins performing varied functions such as d-alanyl-d-alanine carboxypeptidase b , aminopeptidase , class a, c β-lactamases etc. dd-peptidases  are β-lactam sensitive enzymes that process precursor peptides that facilitate peptidoglycan cross-linking during bacterial cell wall biosynthesis  <cit> . studies have led to the identification of their active site residues . the active site ser and lys residues form a sequential motif that is highly conserved across family members. the tyr active site residue occurs in a conserved y-x-n motif situated on a loop in the all α-domain, with tyr residue being replaced by ser in some proteins  <cit> . β-lactamases are hydrolases that catalyse the hydrolysis of the β-lactam ring of β-lactam antibiotics such as penicillins. and probably evolved as a means of protection against the β-lactam antibiotics that restrict the sacular growth  in bacteria by inhibiting dd-peptidase activity  <cit> . class a  proteins were the first to be identified and are the most common β-lactamases. dd-peptidase-like proteins are widespread in the bacterial genomes, and their corresponding genes may occur on bacterial chromosomes or on plasmids. this allows for their transfer to the distant species and may account for their distribution and diversity  <cit> . the absence of dd-peptidase-like proteins in most eukaryotic lineages is attributed to the absence of peptidoglycans especially in metazoa  <cit> .

a total of  <dig> dd-peptidase-like proteins  were identified in the current analysis . while they display a widespread distribution in the bacteria, a low representation is observed for these enzymes in the archaeal genomes considered in the present study . this is probably due to the different pathways for cell wall biosynthesis in archaea which involve pseudomureins. the abundance of the dd-peptidase-like proteins in bacterial lineages is attributed to their ancient evolution as important constituents of the cell wall biosynthesis in bacteria, specialisation of a significant repertoire as β-lactamases for protection against the β-lactam compounds and their retention in adaptation to probable subsequent modifications in the β-lactam synthesising pathways that share the acv synthetase gene, which is widely distributed in the bacterial genomes  <cit> . a closer inspection of the distribution of the dd-peptidase-like proteins in the prokaryotic species considered in the present study reveals a high representation in the genomes of some pathogenic bacteria: bacillus anthracis ames , bacillus thuringiensis konkukian , bradyrhizobium japonicum , mycobacterium tuberculosis  and streptomyces avermitilis  . for effective pathogenesis, these bacteria deploy an extensive arsenal of biomolecules or virulence factors that would allow them to overcome host defense machinery and appropriate their resources. studies have highlighted that the peptidoglycan turnover and the release of derivative elicitor molecules such as muropeptides, facilitated by the dd-peptidases plays significant roles in pathogenesis  <cit> . antibiotic compounds form a major component of bacterial defense response against invading pathogenic bacteria and thus, the latter would require mechanisms to neutralise such compounds for successful invasion. the significant representation of the dd-peptidase-like proteins  in these genomes suggest that some of them may have been recruited as the components of the invasive machinery deployed to neutralise host defenses and facilitate effective pathogenesis.

phylogenetic analysis shows the presence of several clusters of dd-peptidase-like proteins . while several clusters of taxa-specific and species-specific dd-peptidase-like proteins were observed, several clusters were populated by proteins from distinct species. for instance, a dd-peptidase-like protein yp_ <dig>   co-clusters with proteins from alphaproteobacteria bradyrhizobium japonicum  and rhodopseudomonas palustris  suggesting a probable lateral transfer of some dd-peptidase-like genes between these bacterial species. similarly, np_ <dig>   co-clusters with dd-peptidase-like proteins from alphaproteobacteria, while yp_ <dig>   co-clusters with dd-peptidase-like proteins from bacillus sp.  and oceanobacillus iheyensis  . thus, phylogenetic analysis suggests that the abundance of dd-peptidase-like proteins in prokaryotes was probably facilitated by their dissemination into various prokaryotic species through multiple horizontal gene transfer events.

clp protease family 
clp proteases are a group of atp-dependent serine endopeptidases  <cit> . e. coli clpp is an atp-dependent serine protease consisting of a smaller protease subunit clpp, and a larger chaperone regulatory atpase subunit . though the protease domain is capable of proteolysis on its own, atpase subunits are essential for effective levels of proteolysis. the catalytic triad residues ser-his-asp  are enclosed in a single cavity that allows for degradation of small peptides but precludes the entry of the large folded polypeptides  <cit> . clp proteases do not show any strict specificity for the residues at the p <dig> or p1' positions in their substrates, but seem to prefer hydrophobic or non-polar residues at these positions  <cit> .

a total of  <dig> clp protease-like proteins  were identified in the present study . phylogenetic analysis shows the presence of many clusters of clp protease-like proteins and significantly populated clusters were identified for firmicutes, gammaproteobacteria, cyanobacteria and actinobacteria . this is consistent with observations on diversity of clp protease functions in various prokaryotic lineages  <cit>  that they have been implicated in radioresistance and regulating cell division in deinococcus radiodurans  <cit> , regulating metabolic pathways associated with nutrition in bacillus subtilis  <cit> , regulation of zinc homeostasis in e. coli  <cit> , cell viability in cyanobacterium synechococcus  <cit>  and survival during stationary phase in e. coli  <cit> etc. phylogeny also reveals co-clustering of clp protease-like proteins from distinct species. np_ <dig>   co-clusters with yp_ <dig>   and np_ <dig>   suggesting a putative lateral transfer of some clp protease gene products between these bacterial species. similarly, yp_ <dig>   co-clusters with np_ <dig> , yp_ <dig>   and np_ <dig>   suggesting multiple lateral transfer of clp protease-like proteins between the bacterial species. yet another instance of probable lateral transfer of clp proteases was observed with the co-clustering of np_ <dig>   with np_ <dig>   and np_ <dig>    suggesting that the distribution of clp proteases in prokaryotes may have been facilitated by multiple lateral gene transfer events.

lon protease family 
lon proteases are a group of atp-dependent serine proteases, where unlike the clp proteases, the catalytic protease domain and the atpase domain reside in the same polypeptide. e. coli lon protease was the first atp-dependent protease to be described and consists of three functional domains: the n-terminal domain , a central atpase domain  and a c-terminal proteolytic domain . the n-terminal lon domain, along with the aaa module, is believed to impart substrate specificity to lon proteases. lon proteases employ a ser-lys  catalytic dyad. based on the conservation of residues around the catalytic serine residue, lon proteases maybe divided into two subfamilies lona  and lonb   <cit> . they display broad sequence specificity in degrading polypeptides, with a slight preference for hydrophobic residues at p <dig> position  <cit> . in addition to their role in protein quality control by removal of misfolded proteins, lon proteases are known to regulate a variety of physiological processes such as cell differentiation, sporulation, pathogenicity and stress response in bacteria  <cit> .

a total of  <dig> lon protease homologues  were identified in the present analysis. they display a higher representation in euryarchaeota than trypsins, dd-peptidases and clp proteases . based on the conservation of the residues around the catalytic serine, most lon protease homologues identified here correspond to the lona subfamily. however, a significant number of the archaeal and the bacterial lon proteases were identified as belonging to the lonb subfamily. phylogenetic analysis reveals several taxa and species-specific clusters of the lon proteases . lon protease-like proteins identified as the lonb subfamily members fall into a single cluster, which includes two subclusters of the bacterial and the archaeal lon proteases. while, most bacterial lonb proteins identified here belong to the gram-negative bacteria , a few homologues were identified in the gram-positive bacteria  . distinct subclusters of archaeal and bacterial lonb members suggest diversification of the lonb repertoire in the two kingdoms as a consequence of the organisms' adaptation to their specific environments. however, phylogeny also reveals co-clustering of bacterial lonb members from distinct species . yp_ <dig>  was observed to co-cluster with yp_ <dig>  ; np_ <dig>  ; np_ <dig>   etc suggesting that some of the lonb-like proteins in bacteria were disseminated to different species through multiple lateral gene transfer events . similar inferences can be drawn based on the clustering observed for archaeal lon protease-like proteins. for instance, an archaeal lonb-like protein yp_ <dig>  from thermococcus kodakaraensis kod <dig> closely associates with np_ <dig>   and np_ <dig>  . similarly, a thermococcus kodakaraensis kod <dig> lon protease-like protein yp_ <dig>  co-clusters with np_ <dig>   and np_ <dig>   . literature reports have suggested the possibility of horizontal gene transfer between thermococcus kodakaraensis and pyrococcus sp.  <cit>  suggesting a lateral transfer of lon protease-like proteins in the three archaeal species. in another instance, a bacterial lon protease-like protein np_ <dig>   co-clusters with two archaeal lon protease-like proteins np_ <dig>   and np_ <dig>  , suggesting the possibility of the lateral transfer of lon protease genes between bacteria and archaea .

analysis of domain architectures
serine protease-like domains often exist as a part of multi-domain polypeptides. in several enzyme families, changes in the domain alliances are known to modulate the enzyme function, usually by altering the substrate specificity or enzyme efficiency. the co-existing domains may also play a key role in the substrate specificity of these proteins, either by facilitating protein-protein interactions or their specific involvement in pathways  <cit> . such additional modules may introduce newer and more diverse functions for the serine proteases in the various cellular networks. therefore, an investigation of various domain combinations in serine protease families would be extremely useful in further understanding of their evolution and the biological functions. the domain architectures of serine protease-like proteins identified in the present study were carefully examined using sensitive sequence and profile search procedures and the known functions of the domains tethered to the serine protease domains were taken into consideration to approximate the putative functional associations for the multi-domain serine protease-like proteins. the propensity of the five families to harbour co-existing domains and the tendency for specific co-existing domains was also analysed. the distribution of the varied domain combinations and the known functions of the co-existing domains associated with the serine protease domain in these proteins were employed to obtain insights into their probable biological function associations.

single domain vs multi-domain serine proteases
of the  <dig> serine protease-like proteins identified in the present study,  <dig>  were found to carry co-existing domains. however, the distribution of the multi-domain proteins is not uniform across the five families, which display unequal preferences to enter into domain alliances. while, trypsins and subtilisins have a significant proportion of the multi-domain representatives, dd-peptidases and clp proteases are overwhelmingly single-domain polypeptides. most lon protease representatives are multi-domain proteins . while some protein domain superfamilies are highly versatile and may co-exist with diverse neighbouring domains, some others have a limited repertoire of partner domains  <cit> . different domain combinations contribute to functional diversity within and across the lineages  <cit> . different propensities of the five serine protease families to form diverse domain combinations may be indicative of selection pressures and possible functional associations. the diversity in the domain combinations and their possible implications for individual serine protease families is discussed below.

domain architectures in the tryspin  family
of the  <dig> gene products identified as harbouring the trypsin protease-like domains,  <dig>  were multi-domain polypeptides, where  <dig> different domain architectures were observed. the impact of some unique domain combinations observed in prokaryotic trypsin-like proteins and their likely influence on the biological functions of these proteins are discussed.

trypsins with protein-protein interaction modules
analysis of the domain combinations in the trypsin-like proteins identified in the current study reveals the pdz domains as the most abundant domain partners and their tethering to the c-terminal of the trypsin-like domain. of the  <dig> multi-domain trypsin-like proteins identified,  <dig> were found to have either one  or two  pdz domains tethered to the c-terminus of the trypsin-like domain . pdz domains are one of the most common protein-protein interaction domains found in diverse organisms from bacteria to humans. they play a major role in the assembly of the multimeric protein complexes involved in cellular signaling and trafficking. this functional role for the pdz domains is facilitated by their ability to recognise and bind short specific motifs located in the c-termini of the target proteins and/or to the internal peptide sequences, which enables them to recognise and bind to diverse ligands. they modulate the function and the localisation of their associated proteins and are involved in substrate recognition and binding in certain proteases  <cit> . s1-pdz couple was the only domain combination identified in the four of six archaeal genomes where trypsin-like proteins were identified, suggesting that the additional pdz domain was recruited later in evolution, possibly in response to the need for bacterial trypsin homologues to be recruited for diverse functions. other protein interaction modules were also found associated with trypsin-like proteins in prokaryotes. ppc module was found associated with trypsin homologues  in hahella chejuensis . ppc is distantly related with pkd module  and is believed to mediate protein-protein and protein-carbohydrate interactions in secreted proteins  <cit> . four fg-gap modules, important for ligand binding in certain proteins  <cit> , were found tethered to the c-terminus of the trypsin protease domain in np_ <dig>  in streptomyces avermitilis. anf-receptor module corresponding to the ligand binding region of several receptors  <cit>  was found associated with a trypsin homologue  in symbiobacterium thermophilum  <cit>  .

trypsins with modules associated with pathogenesis and cell recognition
many trypsin homologues identified in the present analysis reveal their association with modules that function in cellular recognition and pathogenesis  clearly suggesting the biological role of such trypsin domains in host pathogenesis. for instance, eight trypsin homologues were found associated with colicin_v domain, n-terminal to the protease domain . colicin_v domain kills target cells by disrupting their membrane potential  <cit>  and may assist pathogenesis and/or defense. interestingly, all eight colicin_v domain containing trypsin-like proteins identified in the present study were found in gram-positive bacteria of actinobacteria lineage . perhaps, such domain combinations are required for bacteria that live in harsh conditions since several of them are soil bacteria and may have disseminated to these species via multiple horizontal gene transfer events. np_ <dig> , carrying cw_binding_ <dig> repeat, was identified in streptococcus pneumoniae. this repeat is believed to be important in mediating recognition of choline-containing cell walls  <cit>  .

trypsins with modules associated with signalling and metabolism
some trypsin homologues were found associated with regions most similar to modules likely to function in signalling and metabolism . trypsin homologue yp_ <dig>   was also found associated with an scp domain  likely to have a calcium chelating function and is involved in many signalling processes  <cit> . np_ <dig>  from bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is associated with two fha  domains n-terminal to the protease domain, fha domain which is found in diverse proteins associated with metabolic processes such as dna repair, signalling, transport etc  <cit> . np_ <dig>  in streptomyces avermitilis was associated with a cbm_5_ <dig> module c-terminal to the protease domain; these are presumed to have a carbohydrate-binding function. yp_ <dig>  in pseudomonas syringae was associated with terd module n-terminal to the protease domain; this domain, found in tellurite resistance proteins, is required for growth in toxic medium. this is not functionally characterised to our knowledge. np_ <dig>  in fusobacterium nucleatum carries an endonuclease_ns domain, which encodes an endonuclease that acts on double and single-stranded nucleic acids  <cit>  .

co-existing domains that likely modulate the trypsin protease domain
trypsin homologues  from streptomyces avermitilis were associated with alpha lytic protease prodomain , usually associated with alpha-lytic endopeptidases – a subset of trypsins involved in lysing and degrading soil organisms . it is required for the correct folding of the adjacent protease domain and acts as an inhibitor of the mature enzyme when attached to the protease domain  <cit> .

other domains associated with the trypsin homologues in prokaryotes
modules of indeterminate function were also found associated with some trypsin-like proteins. for example yp_ <dig>  from pelodictyon luteolum was found associated with six sel <dig> repeats that were originally identified in a negative regulator of notch signalling pathway in caenorahbditis elegans  <cit> . however, their functions in mammalian species are unknown and the absence of the components of the notch signalling pathway in prokaryotes suggests their involvement in some other physiological processes.

domain architectures in the subtilisin  family
subtilisins were found to be the most versatile of the five serine protease families.  <dig> out of  <dig>  proteins with subtilisin-like domains were identified as multi-domain polypeptides and a total of  <dig> different domain combinations were discerned, many of which are specific to bacteria or unique to certain prokaryotic species .

subtilisins with protein-protein interaction modules
several subtilisins identified in the present study reveal their association with domains that contain regions facilitating protein-protein interactions . subtilisin-like proteins containing one  or two  ppc domains c-terminal to the protease domain were identified in different prokaryotic lineages. while the single ppc-domain containing subtilisin-like proteins were identified only in archaea and gram-negative bacteria , subtilisin-like proteins with two ppc domains were identified in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria as well as archaea . twelve gene products  were identified that carry pa domain inserts in the subtilisin protease domain. pa domain is suggested to form a lid-like structure that covers the active site in the protease and is believed to be involved in protein interactions or mediate substrate recognition by proteases  <cit> . subtilisin-like proteins  associated with pkd domain were also identified. pkd domains are predicted to be involved in protein-protein and protein-carbohydrate interactions  <cit>  .

subtilisins with modules associated with pathogenesis and cell recognition
several subtilisin-like proteins identified here were found in association with modules that function in cellular recognition and pathogenesis . for instance,  <dig> subtilisin-like proteins  were identifiedthat carry an autotransporter beta-domain, c-terminal to the subtilisin domain . this module encodes for a β-barrel domain that usually occurs at the c-terminus of the various domains which it translocates across the outer membrane of the gram-negative bacteria, sometimes followed by an autocatalytic cleavage of the passenger domain. they are often associated with virulence functions such as cell adhesion and invasion  <cit> . interestingly, a subtilisin-like protein associated with an autotransporter module np_ <dig>  was identified in a gram-positive bacterium fusobacterium nucleatum . subtilisin-like proteins with gram_pos_anchor modules, which helps to gain access to host cells were identified . np_ <dig>  in sterptococcus agalacticae additionally carries a closely related motif called ysirk type signal peptide  <cit> . dockerin i type repeats, which are critical components of cellulosome, that degrades crystalline cellulose  <cit> , were found associated with the subtilisin domain in np_ <dig>  from halobacterium. cleaved_adhesin domain found in hemagglutinins and peptidases that in porphyromonas form components of extracellular virulence complex rgpa-kgp  <cit>  was associated with a subtilisin-like protein yp_ <dig>  in symbiobacterium thermophilum. big_ <dig> domain possibly associated with cell adhesion in bacteria was found encoded by subtilisin-like protein np_ <dig>  in the predatory bacterium bdellovibrio bacteriovorus where it is likely to be associated with the hydrolytic machinery that facilitates the bacterium's predatory lifecycle  <cit>  and in np_ <dig>  in thermoanaerobacter tengcongenesis, which also carries a pair of slh domains believed to anchor the peptidoglycans  <cit> . some other domains associated with cell adhesion were also identified in some subtilisin-like proteins such as hemolysincabind, which is probably involved in calcium mediated binding to the specific receptors and in the folding of the protein subsequent to the transmemembrane translocation  <cit>  ; cardb-cell adhesion related bacterial domain   <cit> ; fibronectin type iii  domain involved in cell surface binding  <cit>   .

subtilisins with modules associated with signalling and metabolism
many subtilisin-like proteins were identified with the regions most similar to the modules likely to function in signalling and metabolism flanking the protease domain . np_ <dig>  gene product in methanosarcina acetovirans  carries a nosd module c-terminal to the subtilisin domain; nosd is a periplasmic protein believed to insert copper into exported reductase apoenzyme  <cit> . np_ <dig> , a gene product in lactobacillus johnsonii, encodes a multi-domain protein with five fivar modules, a putative sugar binding domain mostly found in cell-wall associated proteins  <cit> . np_ <dig>  in bdellovibrio bacteriovorus was found to carry a cub domain, an extracellular module associated with diverse functions in development and signalling in eukaryotes, however, its role in prokaryotes is not clear  <cit>  .

co-existing domains that likely modulate the subtilisin domain
some subtilisin-like proteins were found associated with the domains that likely modulate the function of the adjacent subtlisin protease domain . a subtilisin-coexisting domain, that occurs n-terminal to many subtilisins including those in plants  <cit>  and is subsequently cleaved prior to activation, was found in several subtilisin-like proteins identified in the present study . np_ <dig>  gene product in bdellovibrio bacteriovorus codes for a proprotein convertase p-domain c-terminal to the subtilisin domain. it is associated with the kex2/subtilisin endopeptidases in eukaryotes, gammaproteobacteria and few others and is believed to be necessary for the folding and maintenance of the subtilisin domain and regulating its calcium ph specificity  <cit> . np_ <dig>  in thermoplasma acidophilum  encodes for a thermopsin module, n-terminal to the subtilisin domain, similar to those found in the thermostable acid proteases in archaebacteria  <cit>  .

other domains associated with the subtilisin homologues in prokaryotes
several modules of unknown or indeterminate function were also found associated with subtilisin-like proteins in prokaryotes . these include grp module  in np_ <dig>  in sinirhizobium meliloti; domain of unknown function duf <dig>  also associated with some plant subtilisins  <cit>  seen in yp_ <dig>  in lactobacillus acidophilus; duf <dig>  in np_ <dig>  in geobacter sulfurreducens; bnr repeats in np_ <dig>  in streptomyces avermitilis; pilz domain in np_ <dig>  in bdellovibrio bacteriovorus; tryptophan rich  domain in yp_ <dig>  in synechococcus  <cit>  and so on .

domain architectures in dd-peptidase  family
dd-peptidase-like proteins were found to be extremely rigid in terms of domain combinations. only five of  <dig> proteins carrying dd-peptidase-like domains were identified as multi-domain polypeptides, in sharp contrast to other serine protease families analysed here, except clp proteases . these exceptional prokaryotic dd-peptidase multi-domain architectures are discussed here. dd-peptidase-like protein yp_ <dig>  in hahella chejuensis was found to encode a region most similar to abc transporters that function in translocation of diverse compounds across biological membranes  <cit> . another homologue np_ <dig>  in streptomyces avermitilis carries three each of condensation , amp-binding  and pp-binding  modules n-terminal to the predicted dd-peptidase domain. two dd-peptidase-like proteins identified in the gram-negative bacteria , np_ <dig>   and yp_ <dig>   were found associated with the glyco_hydro_ <dig> module found in the o-glycosyl hydrolases that hydrolyse the glycosidic bond between two or more carbohydrates. yp_ <dig>  also carries a glyco_hydro_3_c module, often found in association with glyco_hydro_ <dig> and is involved in catalysis and binding β-glucan  <cit>  .

domain architectures in clp protease  family
clp proteases show an overwhelming preference for existence as single domain polypeptides. only three of  <dig> clp protease homologues identified in the current study were found to carry additional domains . all three multi-domain clp homologues np_ <dig>  , np_ <dig>   and np_ <dig>   were identified in hyperthermophilic archaea and are associated with nfed-like module c-terminal to the protease domain . nfed-like domain corresponds to a family of proteins that include nodulation efficiency proteins and protease homologues. although exact function of this family remains unknown, it is unlikely to be involved specifically in nodulation  <cit>  . the lack of multi-domain polypeptides amongst clp protease homologues can be viewed in terms of their known functional associations. clp proteases are known to extensively form complexes with aaa+  modules, which are one of the most diverse and promiscuous modules known to associate with diverse domains and function in a wide range of physiological processes  <cit> . by extension, the association of clp protease domains with aaa+ mediated assemblies of protein complexes would allow them to modulate a host of cellular and physiological processes where aaa+ modules are required and would facilitate the availability of diverse substrates for degradation by clp protease domain. therefore, it would seem that clp proteases may rely on forming complexes with aaa+ modules to ensure their association with diverse processes.

domain architectures in lon protease  family
lon proteases display a marked preference for existence as multi-domain polypeptides. of the  <dig> lon protease-like proteins identified here,  <dig>  gene products were found to retain co-existing domains and display a conserved domain architecture . fifty eight of the  <dig> lon protease-like proteins were found to possess the canonical lon protease domain combination, consisting of an n-terminal domain , a central atpase domain  and a c-terminal proteolytic domain . the n-terminal lon domain, together with the aaa  module, selectively interacts with the target protein and is believed to impart substrate specificity to the lon proteases  <cit> . a significant repertoire was found associated with the sigma54_activat module that has atpase activity and interacts with the sigma- <dig> factor involved in the bacterial rna polymerase mediated transcription initiation  <cit> . it is likely that the adjacent lon protease domain may be involved in processing the sigma54_activat domain. two predominant architectures were observed for the sigma54_activat associated lon protease homologues: sigma54_activat-s <dig> architectures found only in the archaeal proteins such as np_ <dig>   and the sigma54_activat-aaa-s <dig> in gene products such as yp_ <dig>   . the magnesium chelatase, subunit chli domain, which is involved in synthesis of the bacteriochlorophyll  <cit>  was found associated with five archaeal lon protease-like proteins, where it occurs n-terminal to the lon protease domain . an archaeal lon protease-like protein np_ <dig>   carries a magnesium chelatase and a sigma54_activat domain n-terminal to the predicted lon protease domain . interestingly, all the mg_chelatase domain containing lon protease-like proteins are assigned as the putative members of the lonb subfamily of lon proteases based on the sequence and phylogenetic analysis , suggesting a specific acquisition of the mg_chelatase module by some archaeal proteases belonging the lonb subfamily. a lon protease-like protein yp_ <dig>  from azoarcus was found associated with the dnab helicase c-terminal domain that unwinds the dna duplex in the prokaryotes. the domain contains an atp-binding site and is a likely site for atp hydrolysis  <cit> . its co-occurrence with the lon protease domain suggests a putative alternate mechanism for facilitating atp-dependent lon protease activity. np_ <dig>  in bacillus subtilis was found associated with a pdz domain  n-terminal to lon protease domain, which may facilitate interactions with specific substrates .

CONCLUSIONS
genome-wide studies reveal a large number of serine proteases belonging to the trypsin, subtilisin, dd-peptidase, clp protease and lon protease families in prokaryotes. however, there is only a limited knowledge available about their probable biological functions. trypsins, subtilisins and the dd-peptidases have a higher number of representatives than the clp protease and the lon protease families in the genomes considered for the present analysis. the differences in the representations of the five serine protease families probably arose due to the selection of specific classes of serine proteases during evolution as an adaptation to different cellular and extracellular environments. for instance, the high abundance of the trypsins and the subtilisins in bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is likely due to their involvement as the components of the hydrolytic arsenal deployed for pathogenesis by the bacterium. similarly, the abundance of the dd-peptidase-like proteins in some pathogenic bacteria  suggests their probable functions as virulence factors and in antibiotic resistance. interestingly, while trypsins are also well represented in the eukaryotes, subtilisins  and dd-peptidases are less abundant in higher organisms suggesting that such enzymes were likely lost during the evolution as an adaptation to the cellular  environment in the eukaryotes. phylogenetic analysis suggests putative lateral transfer of serine protease genes between different bacterial and archaeal species and also between some bacteria and archaea. it is likely that some serine protease-like proteins may have been disseminated in the different prokaryotic species through probable horizontal gene transfer events. the lateral transfer of the serine protease genes in bacteria may possibly confer an evolutionary advantage on the recipient  <cit> .

in the absence of the experimental characterisation for the most of the proteins sequences, an approximation of their biological functions is often inferred based on their sequence similarities to the proteins of known function. studies have shown that the overall biological functions and the interactions of the multi-domain proteins are conserved by the retention of the domain composition and sequential arrangement  <cit> . therefore the domain architectures of the multi-domain serine protease-like proteins were investigated to obtain insights into their probable functional associations. a differential distribution of the multi-domain proteins across the five families indicates different selection pressures and possible functional associations. enzymatic and non-enzymatic domains such as those associated with protein interaction, signaling, pathogenesis, cell adhesion, metabolism etc were found tethered to the serine protease domain. addition of new domains would permit these enzymes to acquire new functions and specificities contributing to the functional diversities of these gene families. however, a lack of significant repertoire of accessory domains does not necessarily indicate lack of functional diversity. enzyme families may adopt alternative mechanisms to expand their functional repertoire, such as associating with limited but functionally diverse modules and other proteins or effecting changes in key amino acid residues. for instance, the clp proteases form extensive complexes with the functionally diverse aaa+ modules that would enable them to modulate various physiological processes. the presence of multiple copies of the same accessory domain  in many serine protease-like proteins is another likely approach to expand their functional repertoire. some domain combinations  were found to be widespread and conserved in prokaryotes suggesting a critical roles. unique domain combinations of some prokaryotic serine protease-like proteins suggest their involvement in species-specific functions. several domain architectures identified in prokaryotic serine proteases in the present analysis are very different from those reported in eukaryotic serine proteases. this highlights the distinct biological roles for the prokaryotic serine proteases compared to those in the eukaryotes. some of these prokaryotic serine protease-like proteins with atypical domain combinations are attractive targets for experimental characterisation. some pathogen peptidases identified in the present analysis with no identifiable homologues  in their hosts may be promising drug targets  <cit> . for example, a putative trypsin np_ <dig>   and a subtilisin-like protein np_ <dig>   in streptococcus pneumoniae, a human pathogen, are postulated to function in pathogenesis based on the domains associated with the serine protease domain. some serine protease-like proteins such as np_ <dig>   in bdellovibrio bacteriovorus and yp_ <dig>  in pelodictyon luteolum  are associated with domains similar to eukaryotic signalling modules with no known functions in prokaryotes. a systematic deletion of the one or more co-existing domains in the gene products with atypical domain combinations and the resulting phenotypes may help understand their roles in pathogenesis and other prokaryotic physiological processes and the role of the co-existing domains in modulating the functions of these serine proteases. similarly, a phylogenetic cluster of the trypsin-like proteins  that contain a colicin_v domain known to function in pathogenesis, tethered c-terminal to the protease domain, suggests an acquisition of the unique patterns in the interface region of the trypsin domain in these gene products. identification of the conserved domain-domain interface regions and mutagenesis may help understand the function of these gene products and the role of the interactions between the adjacent domains.

the systematic analysis of the five serine protease families in the representative prokaryotic genomes is expected to enable a better understanding of the previously uncharacterised serine proteases encoded in the various genomes. the numbers of the serine protease-like proteins is likely to increase with the increasing amounts of the prokaryotic genomic data and the present analysis should help provide paradigms that would be useful in extending such analyses to a broader repertoire of the prokaryotes. the diversity of the functional domains co-existing with the protease domain in the serine protease-like proteins has provided clues to their biological functions, much of which are yet to be characterised experimentally. experimental characterisation of some of these gene products as proposed here may help uncover the specific functional roles for the serine proteases in various cellular and physiological processes and help understand their influence on growth and development in the prokaryotic species.
