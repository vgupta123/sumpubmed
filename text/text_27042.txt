BACKGROUND
the development and function of many organs is responsive to and regulated by the physiological demands placed upon it  <cit> . the mammary gland is no exception and regular removal of milk is critical to maintaining milk secretion. during early lactation, the milk production potential of the mammary gland is particularly sensitive to the nutritional needs of the offspring such that an increase in demand  elicits an increase in milk production  <cit> . this is an adaptive strategy, regulated at the level of the mammary gland, to meet the demands of the offspring  <cit> . in dairy production systems, frequent suckling by the offspring can be mimicked by frequent machine milking  to stimulate milk production in ruminants by  <dig> to 14%  <cit> . as a result, frequent milking of dairy cows has become a successful management tool for increasing milk production efficiency and many dairy producers have adopted three times daily milking of their cows.

more recently, it has been reported that increased milking frequency  or more) for the first few weeks during early lactation elicits an increase in milk production that partially carries over through the remainder of that lactation, even after the milking frequency is returned to 2×  <cit> . although the mechanisms underlying this response are unknown, we have shown that both the acute and the long-term increases in milk yield are regulated locally, at the level of the mammary gland  <cit> . with respect to possible mechanisms for regulating the increase in milk yield in response to imf, changes in cell number, activity, blood supply and/or mammary metabolism have been proposed  <cit> .

recently, connor et al.  <cit>  investigated the transcriptional response of the mammary gland to imf during early lactation. they observed changes in mammary expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, cellular remodeling, and nutrient transport. mammary cell proliferation, however, was not consistently affected  <cit>  and was not affected by imf in other experiments  <cit> . therefore, although there is a clear transcriptional response to imf, the functional implications of this response remain unclear. we recently reported that the milk yield response to imf is mediated by genes acutely regulated by removal of milk from the mammary gland  <cit> . many of the differentially expressed genes have been associated with cell proliferation and apoptosis; however, those processes were not affected by imf based on direct functional measurements  <cit> . that experiment was designed to investigate the mechanisms involved in the increase in milk yield early in the response to imf  and, like other experiments  <cit> , biopsies were obtained during the acute phase of frequent milking treatment, when differential milk yield was increasing. the milk yield response to imf is dynamic, however, characterized by a marked increase in milk yield during imf that peaks by day  <dig> of lactation; followed by a marked, acute decrease in milk yield upon cessation of imf; and finally a carryover effect that maintains an increased level of milk production that is stable and persistent. therefore, we adopted a sequential tissue sampling approach to provide insight on the potential mechanisms involved at each of those stages.

in the current experiment, we used a half-udder model and a functional genomics approach to determine the physiological and transcriptional changes associated with each phase of the milk yield response to frequent milking during early lactation. we hypothesized that the dynamic milk yield response would be associated with changes in mammary cell proliferation, apoptosis, and/or gene expression. in addition, we hypothesized that the persistent increase in milk yield would be associated with persistent changes in mammary gene expression. our objectives were to determine the cellular and transcriptional responses associated with: 1) sustained  unilateral 4× milking during early lactation; 2) the acute decline in milk yield upon cessation of unilateral 4× milking; and 3) the persistent increment in milk yield after resumption of 2× milking in glands initially milked 4×. our results revealed a coordinated transcriptional response of at least  <dig> genes that was strongly associated with differential milk yield over time, implicating those genes in the autocrine regulation of milk production. in addition,  <dig> of these genes were differentially expressed on day  <dig> of lactation, suggesting they may regulate the stable and persistent increment in milk yield after 4× milking in early lactation.

RESULTS
milk yield
on day  <dig> of lactation, udder halves produced similar amounts of milk . during ufm, milk production from the 4× udder half increased dramatically and on day  <dig>  average milk production of 2× and 4× udder halves was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  vs.  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kg/day, respectively ; hence the milk yield differential was  <dig>  kg/day. during the entire ufm treatment period, differential milk production of 4× udder halves averaged  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kg/day more milk than the 2× udder half . immediately after cessation of ufm, milk production from the 4× udder halves decreased  by day 23; however, the 4× udder half continued to produce  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kg/day more milk than the 2× udder half through d  <dig> of lactation .

mammary cell proliferation and apoptosis and tissue architecture
incorporation of -thymidine into dna in vitro averaged 74 ±  <dig> disintegrations per min/μg of dna and was not affected by 4× milking or by day of lactation . the percentage of epithelial cells or stromal cells that were tunel positive averaged  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively, and was not affected by 4× milking or by day of lactation . proportions of tissue space occupied by epithelial or stromal cells were remarkably consistent and were not affected by treatment or time .

microarray analysis of gene expression
identification of genes associated with milk yield
one of the main objectives of our microarray experiment was to identify genes whose expression changed in association with changes in differential milk yield. therefore, we analyzed the data to identify genes whose differential expression  reversed  from day  <dig> of lactation  to day  <dig> of lactation . we identified  <dig> genes that exhibited a significant reversal or reduction in differential expression . to refine the number of candidates, we then imposed an additional filter to include only those genes whose differential gene expression  changed by a magnitude of ≥  <dig> between day  <dig> and day  <dig> of lactation . five of the identified genes were non-annotated transcribed loci with no significant homology to known transcripts ).

1cows  were assigned to twice daily milking  of the left udder half and four times daily milking  of the right udder half during d  <dig> to  <dig> of lactation. mammary biopsies from both udder halves were obtained on d  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of lactation. differential gene expression was detected using affymetrix genechip® bovine genome arrays.

genes differentially expressed during and after ufm
after we identified genes associated with differential milk yield , we then went on to investigate the effect of 4× milking on those  <dig> genes at each individual timepoint. within the set of  <dig> genes, expression of  <dig> genes was lower, whereas expression of  <dig> genes was higher, in 4× vs. 2× udder halves during ufm . after cessation of ufm , expression of  <dig> genes was higher in 4× vs. 2× udder halves . on day  <dig> of lactation, expression of  <dig> of the  <dig> genes was lower in 4× vs. 2× udder halves .

cluster analysis
because there were clear differences in the expression of the  <dig> genes over time, we grouped them into  <dig> clusters based on the temporal pattern of differential expression . cluster  <dig>  included genes whose relative expression in 4× vs. 2× udder halves was lower on day  <dig>  higher on day  <dig> , and subsequently lower on day  <dig> of lactation. cluster  <dig>  included genes whose expression in 4× relative to 2× udder halves was lower on day  <dig>  higher upon cessation of 4× milking on day  <dig>  and remained higher or did not differ on day  <dig> of lactation. cluster  <dig>  included genes whose expression was higher in 4× vs. 2× udder halves on day  <dig>  lower upon cessation of 4× milking on day  <dig>  and higher or not different in 4× vs. 2× udder halves on day  <dig>  finally, cluster  <dig>  included genes whose expression in 4× relative to 2× udder halves was higher on day  <dig>  lower on day  <dig> and remained lower or not different on day  <dig>  the average change in differential expression of genes in clusters  <dig> and  <dig> was negatively correlated with the change in differential milk yield between day  <dig> and day  <dig> of lactation  as well as across all three time points , whereas the average differential expression of genes in clusters  <dig> and  <dig> was positively associated with differential milk yield between day  <dig> and day  <dig> of lactation  as well as across all three time points .

pathway analysis
ingenuity pathway analysis  was used to gain insight into functions of, and to detect potential connections between, the  <dig> genes whose expression was correlated with differential milk yield. pathway analysis indicated that within the set of  <dig> genes, there were known interactions among  <dig> of them . expression of five of those genes was measured using rt-qpcr , and the results for each gene were consistent with the microarray findings for the effect of 4× and day of lactation on mammary gene expression. not surprisingly, ipa did not provide useful findings based on this small set of  <dig> genes. therefore, we constructed four larger sets of differentially expressed genes that were selected based solely on a p-value cutoff  for the effect of imf at each of the three timepoints and for the change in differential expression  of genes from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  genes that were differentially expressed during imf, on day  <dig> of lactation , were predicted by ipa to be associated with the inhibition of transforming growth factor -β and interferon-γ  signaling in 4×- relative to 2×-udder halves , and were predicted to enrich several canonical pathways, including several growth factor and cytokine signaling pathways, as well as some associated with leukocyte signaling or function . there were no significant ipa findings based on differential gene expression on day  <dig> of lactation, probably due to the small number of genes . genes that were differentially expressed on day  <dig> of lactation, 19 days after ufm had ceased , were associated with weak activation of insulin-like growth factor - <dig>  and significant enrichment of canonical pathways including several in common with those identified for day  <dig>  as well as several unique to day  <dig>  notably including prolactin , growth hormone , and igf- <dig> signaling . analysis of genes that exhibited a significant change in differential expression from day  <dig> of lactation to day  <dig> , predicted differential activation of several cytokines and growth factors including gh, igf- <dig>  prl, and tgf-β , as well as significant enrichment of canonical signaling pathways for several growth factors and cytokines . in general, analysis of this latter set of genes did not identify unique regulatory molecules or signaling pathways  but often linked different genes to these common responses.

discussion
in agreement with our previous observations  <cit> , unilateral 4× milking elicited an acute increase in milk yield that partially persisted long after cessation of treatment. half-udder milk yield was measured once weekly in our previous experiments, whereas it was measured every 3 days in the current experiment. these additional measurements confirmed that the acute milk yield response to 4× was indeed rapid and peaked by day  <dig>  about 60% of the peak difference in milk yield between 4× and 2× udder halves was lost between cessation of 4× on day  <dig> and the next measurement on day  <dig>  nevertheless, the difference in yield then stabilized and averaged an increment of  <dig>  kg/day for the remainder of lactation. this increment represented about 40% of the peak difference or about a 15% increase relative to milk yield of 2×-udder halves. as expected, repeated biopsy of mammary tissue did not appear to influence the difference in milk yield.

the effect of imf on mammary cell proliferation and apoptosis has been investigated previously, but interpretation of findings has differed. hale et al.  <cit>  reported increased mammary cell proliferation  and increased epithelial cell apoptosis  on day  <dig> of lactation in cows that were milked 4× for the first  <dig> wk of lactation, compared to cows milked 2×, and concluded that milk yield responses may result from increased proliferation. however, those cellular responses were not observed in all groups of cows milked 4× and an alternative marker of proliferation, ki67-expression, did not yield consistent results. overall, indicators of proliferation or apoptosis were not consistently related to milk yield responses, hence an equally plausible interpretation of their results would be that there was no significant effect on cell population dynamics. consistent with the latter interpretation, both norgaard et al.  <cit>  and wall et al.  <cit>  reported that despite eliciting an increase in milk yield, there was no significant effect of imf on mammary cell apoptosis or proliferation during  <cit>  or after  <cit>  imf treatment. the results of the current study are consistent with those observations. in addition, we found no indication that the milk yield response was related to changes in tissue architecture, based on the similar proportions of epithelial and stromal cells.

we identified a set of  <dig> genes whose expression was associated with differential milk yield. many of these genes were previously identified as responsive to imf in dairy cows  <cit> , and the direction of differential gene expression in the current study agreed with previous observations. moreover, in our previous investigation of the acute response to imf on day five of lactation  <cit> , we identified  <dig> of the genes listed in table  <dig>  as putative responders to removal of milk from the udder and concluded that they must be among those that mediate the milk yield response to imf. our current results support that conclusion, and reveal that many genes previously identified as responders to 5 days of imf  <cit>  were not only also differentially expressed after 21 days of imf, but their differential expression on day  <dig> was reversed on day  <dig>  concomitant with a decline in differential milk yield. these two lines of evidence both link differential expression of these genes to changes in milking frequency and the resultant milk yield responses, suggesting that they are coordinately regulated and may comprise a novel mechanism for autocrine regulation of milk yield and mammary adaptation to imf  <cit> .

it was notable that of the  <dig> genes associated with differential milk yield,  <dig> were down-regulated in response to 4× milking whereas only  <dig> were up-regulated. down-regulation of gene expression in response to functional stimulation of the mammary gland has been observed previously  <cit> . in agreement with our observations, connor et al.  <cit>  reported that the majority of differentially expressed genes were down-regulated in response to 4× milking. during the transition from late pregnancy to lactation in both mice  <cit>  and cows  <cit>  most of the differentially expressed genes in the mammary gland are down-regulated. in contrast, during mammary involution and loss of secretory function, more genes are up-regulated than are down-regulated  <cit> . lemay et al.  <cit>  speculated that pro-lactational stimulus of the mammary gland is not associated with gain of function, but is associated with the suppression of broad functions thereby sparing metabolic support for the specific function of milk synthesis. the stimulus of increased milking frequency may elicit additional streamlining of cellular functions, akin to homeorhetic support of lactation.

one of our objectives was to identify the genes and functions involved in each phase of the milk yield response to imf; those phases being the acute increase in milk yield during imf; the partial decrease in milk yield after cessation of imf, and the persistent increment in milk yield that remained long after imf. based on the results of ipa analysis, it was clear that there were both common and distinct pathways responsive during vs. after imf. for example, differential activation of igf- <dig> was predicted by ipa both during and after imf, whereas inhibition of complement component  <dig> was predicted during imf only. pathway analysis also predicted that at least nine cytokines or growth factors were in an inhibited state during imf but it is not clear whether or how this may relate to the milk yield response or mammary function. the second phase of the response involved the reduction of difference in milk yield between udder halves after cessation of 4× milking. despite this dynamic change, ipa did not predict effects on any canonical pathways or regulatory molecules, probably due to the small number of genes that were differentially expressed on day  <dig> . this result suggests that the decrement in milk yield was associated with reduction of pro-lactational gene expression rather than activation of novel, inhibitory genes. this reasoning is supported by the finding that most genes whose expression was correlated with the reduction in differential milk yield from day  <dig> to  <dig> were predicted to be associated with signaling of multiple growth factors and cytokines. with respect to the third, or carryover, phase of the milk yield response , ipa predicted weak activation of igf- <dig> signaling and enrichment of numerous canonical signaling pathways, including gh, igf- <dig>  and prl, all of which have been linked to regulation of mammary development and cell activity  <cit> . in addition, both igf- <dig> and prl and have been hypothesized to be involved in the response of the mammary gland to imf  <cit> . therefore, although ipa did not provide insight into functional significance of differentially expressed genes, it did predict changes in signaling molecules and pathways that may mediate imf-induced changes in milk yield and mammary function. notably, those pathways were predicted to remain affected long after cessation of treatment, perhaps maintaining the sustained increment in milk production.

to gain additional insight into adaptation of the mammary gland to altered milking frequency, we used evidence from the literature, as well as the gene ontology , to determine functions associated with genes differentially expressed in response to imf that might regulate milk yield responses.

of the differentially expressed genes that were downregulated during 4× and were negatively correlated with milk yield, several have been previously linked to mammary development, differentiation and remodeling; all of which may be functionally relevant to the adaptations of the mammary gland to changes in milking frequency. chitinase 3-like - <dig> is a secreted protein that is associated with mammary involution and remodeling in dairy cows  <cit> , goats  <cit> , and sheep  <cit> . more recently, expression of chi3l <dig> mrna was linked to lactogenesis of the mammary gland in cell culture  <cit> . in other tissues, chi3l <dig> is involved in cellular differentiation and remodeling  <cit> , and also in the cellular response to mechanical stimuli and pressure  <cit> . it is therefore not surprising that our results have consistently shown that chi3l <dig> is involved in the response of the mammary gland to the stimulus of imf. similar to chi3l <dig>  clusterin is a secreted protein that has been associated with involution and remodeling of the mammary gland  <cit> . in addition, clusterin has been used as a marker for apoptosis and dna damage in both mammary gland and prostate  <cit> . consistent with a role in the response of the mammary gland to imf in the current experiment, mammary expression of clusterin is down-regulated by milk removal in rats  <cit> . keratin - <dig> expression was also lower in 4× vs. 2× udder halves, consistent with previous observations  <cit> . conversely, expression of krt <dig> was increased during decreased milking frequency  <cit> . it has been reported that krt <dig> can protect liver cells from fas-mediated apoptosis by preventing dna fragmentation  <cit> . although we did not detect an effect of 4× milking on mammary cell apoptosis, it is possible that imf rescues “surplus” cells that may otherwise be destined for deletion via apoptosis and instead recruits them into an active state. we have previously discussed this possibility in terms of a “use it or lose it” concept  <cit> . in support of this idea, sex determining region y-box - <dig> and − <dig> were down-regulated by ufm, and these genes have been implicated in the determination of cell fate and cellular differentiation during key phases of development in reproductive tissues  <cit> . therefore, the findings of our manual literature searches complement our ipa results by indicating possible functional roles of individual genes in the adaptive response to imf that may be associated with long-term changes in mammary cell activity and differential milk yield. shorten et al.  <cit>  presented a hypothetical model proposing that imf increases the number of active alveoli by increasing the proportion of active to quiescent cells in the mammary gland, which could increase the number of actively secreting alveoli and enhance milk producing capacity for the remainder of lactation.

expression of early growth response - <dig> and thrombospondin - <dig> genes was lower in 4× vs. 2× udder halves both during ufm  and after the carryover increment in milk yield had been established . early growth response- <dig> is a mechanosensitive transcription factor that is regulated by physical stress in the vasculature  <cit>  and lung  <cit> , among other tissues. similarly, thbs <dig> plays a role in vascular  <cit>  and lung  <cit>  development, and it is often co-regulated with egr <dig> <cit> . therefore, the lower expression of these genes in 4× glands might be related to reduced mammary distension in the 4× udder half, due to more frequent bouts of milk removal. similar transcriptional responses to distension and stretch have been described in bladder  <cit> . in the current model, however, it is unclear how such a mechanical response could continue to influence mammary function even after cessation of imf.

several genes were more highly expressed in 4× vs. 2× during ufm and post-treatment when the milk yield increment persisted. this group included lipin- <dig>  low density lipoprotein-related protein - <dig>  and myostatin . low density lipoprotein-related protein- <dig> is a nutrient transporter involved in the endocytic uptake of vitamin d by mammary tissue  <cit> , and it has been suggested to play roles in mammary cell proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . we have shown that expression of lrp <dig> in mammary tissue of dairy cows is physiologically regulated  <cit> , further supporting a specific role for this gene in mammary development and function. expression of mstn, which is also known as growth and differentiation factor- <dig>  has previously been associated with differentiation of the mammary gland in sows  <cit>  although the opposite has been reported in mice  <cit> . the current findings support a new role for these genes in the response of the mammary gland to changes in milking frequency and consequent changes in milk yield. because many genes were differentially expressed both during ufm , and during the carryover effect on milk yield , it is plausible that the stimulus of imf elicited epigenetic programming of the mammary gland.

epigenetic programming is the process by which cells retain a biological memory of environmental events that occur during critical periods of development. such events initiate stable changes in gene expression without changing nucleotide sequences  <cit> . the primary mechanisms regulating epigenetic alterations in gene expression are methylation of cytosine residues on the dna, and histone modification  <cit> . although epigenetic programming was initially thought to be stable and heritable, it is now considered to include transient, reversible changes stimulated by environmental conditions  <cit> . during critical phases of development, epigenetic programming can be initiated by a variety of environmental stimuli, including exposure to hormones, or activity of/demand on the tissue or organ  <cit> . in the mammary gland, gene expression and cellular function can be controlled by epigenetic mechanisms; plachot and lelievre  <cit>  reported that dna methylation plays a role in mammary cell proliferation and differentiation. exposure of the virgin rat to the hormones of pregnancy is associated with persistent changes in mammary gene expression, which may be involved in the protective effect of pregnancy against breast cancer  <cit> . in addition, it has been proposed that epigenetic mechanisms underlie acute changes in mammary function and gene expression in dairy cows  <cit> . importantly, some of the genes implicated in the acute  and carry-over  effects of imf on milk yield are known to be epigenetically regulated including egr <dig> <cit> , and thbs <dig> <cit> . therefore, it is possible that, during early lactation, those genes and perhaps others are susceptible to epigenetic modifications that influence the functional capacity of the mammary gland for the remainder of lactation.

taken together, the results of this experiment indicate that the transcriptional response to changes in milking frequency is characterized by a dynamic yet coordinated pattern of differential expression of at least  <dig> genes that was correlated with both up- and down-regulation of milk yield in paired udder halves. therefore, these genes appear to comprise a novel transcriptional program involved in the autocrine regulation of milk production in the mammary gland. moreover, based on the persistently altered expression of  <dig> of these genes, we propose that imf triggers an epigenetic mechanism that sets a new threshold of expression of those genes and their respective functions as an adaptive strategy for matching mammary output to imf or, in the wild, to demands of suckling neonates during early lactation. we suggest that this represents a novel form of epigenetic regulation that could be called “lactational programming,” since the stimulus of imf for a short period during early lactation elicits changes in gene expression and cellular functions that persist long after treatment has ceased.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that imf during early lactation does not alter mammary cell population dynamics but is associated with coordinated changes in expression of  <dig> genes in the mammary gland. the temporal pattern of differential expression of these genes is correlated with changes in differential milk yield. moreover, twenty nine of these genes were persistently differentially expressed, further implicating them in the long-term alteration of mammary function. together, our findings indicate that we may have identified a novel form of epigenetic regulation, which could be termed “lactational programming,” characterized by coordinated and persistent changes in gene expression during and after increased milking frequency. those genes which remain differentially expressed may mediate the persistent effect on milk yield resulting from increased milking frequency during early lactation of dairy cows.
