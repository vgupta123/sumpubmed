BACKGROUND
mirnas are known as regulators that control various types of biological functions in eukaryotic cells. most mirna genes are transcribed to primary mirnas  by rna polymerase  ii, while other mirnas may be transcribed by rnapol iii  <cit> . then the pri-mirnas are processed to single-stranded stem-loop precursors  by dicer protein in animals or dicer-like  in plants  <cit> , and pre-mirnas are further processed to mirna:mirna* duplexes. the mirna:mirna* duplexes are methylated by hen <dig> on the 3’ terminal  <cit>  and exported to cytoplasm by export factors like exportin- <dig> in animal or hasty in plant  <cit> , then the mature mirnas and mirna* are produced. mature mirnas are loaded into rna-induced silencing complex  that contains argonaute  protein to guide the cleavage of target mrnas that are complementary to the mirnas, while the mirna*s are degraded gradually  <cit> . plant mirnas were first reported in  <dig> in arabidopsis <cit> . they are usually 20- <dig> nt in length and their precursors have various length ranging from  <dig> nt to longer than  <dig> nt. unlike mirnas in animals, plant mirnas have near-perfectly complementary sequences to their targets sites  <cit> . there are two major regulation mechanisms of plant mirnas, known as mrna cleavage and translational inhibition. the positions of  <dig> and  <dig> of mirnas are critical for the mrna targeting and cleavage at 3’ utr region  <cit> . beside mrna cleavage, plant mirnas can also function through translational inhibition that can decrease the level of target proteins  <cit> . to date, most identified targets of plant mirnas are transcription factors that are involved in many biological processes such as developmental patterning, cell differentiation and stress response  <cit> . recently, the roles of plant mirnas were widely studied in various organisms including arabidopsis, rice, maize and sorghum.

mirnas are involved in many regulatory pathways that controls seed development, and mirna loss-of-function may lead to developmental defects or even lethality  <cit> . in arabidopsis, mir <dig> targets spl <dig>  and spl <dig>  and over accumulation of these targets leads to abnormal cell divisions  <cit> . plants expressing mir160-resistant arf <dig>  may cause abnormal embryo symmetry  <cit> . overexpression of mir <dig> reduces the cuc1/cuc <dig>  transcripts and results in cotyledon development defect  <cit> . the sequences of mir <dig> and mir <dig> are nearly identical and both can affect seed size. mir <dig> targets several apetala <dig> -like transcription factors that control seed mass and yield  <cit> . therefore, further focus on developmental roles of mirnas may reveal more detailed functions of mirnas in seed development.

currently, there are  <dig> discovered maize mirnas in the mirna database mirbase   <cit> , most of which is primarily identified by similarity comparison to mature mirnas from other plant species  <cit> . the genome-wide analysis of mirnas and their targets in maize had proved the importance of mirnas in gene regulation network throughout plant development  <cit> . to further study these mirnas in seed development, we sequenced two srna libraries from developing seeds and young leaves, leading to the identification of  <dig> and  <dig> known mirnas in seeds and leaves, respectively, and the discovery of  <dig> novel maize mirnas. small rna deep-sequencing is a ideal way for mirna profiling due to the high throughput comparing with other approaches. we further characterized the mirna expression by mirna microarray study, and both sequencing and microarray data uncovered the similar expression pattern of several known mirnas in developing seeds.

RESULTS
small rna sequencing
to study the role of mirna during seed development, a small rna library from five stages of immature seed  was generated and sequenced by illumina’s genome analyzer. after removal of low quality reads and adaptor sequences, a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads representing  <dig> , <dig> unique reads from  <dig> to  <dig> nt in length were obtained. the most sequenced srnas were 24-nt in length , which was the feature that some sirnas had, followed by 22-nt  and 21-nt , which were the length of canonical mirnas . the abundance of unique reads was remarkably different, however. for example, zma-mir168a/b, with the total count of  <dig> , is the most sequenced read, but around 82%  of total signatures was sequenced only once, indicating that the small rna population in maize might be highly complicated. then, the reads were mapped to the maize genome  using bowtie  <cit>  with a tolerance of one mismatch. the results indicated that  <dig>  reads matched perfectly to the maize genome, representing  <dig>  unique srnas, and  <dig>  reads had one nucleotide differed from the genome, representing  <dig>  unique srnas. approximately  <dig> % unique reads matched other non-coding rnas including rrna , trna , sirna , snrna  and snorna , which made up  <dig> % of total sequenced reads .

to see if the expression of mirnas was different from other tissues, another small rna library from young leaves was also sequenced and data were processed by the same procedure as described above. unlike in seeds, the dominant reads in leaves were 21-nt srnas , and 24-nt srnas only accounted for  <dig> % compared to seeds. other abundant signatures included 20-nt  and 22-nt  srnas . a total of  <dig>  srnas matched perfectly to the genome and  <dig>  srnas differed from genome by one nucleotide. around  <dig> % of total srnas were annotated as other non-coding rnas .

the srnas length distribution of the two libraries suggested a distinct srna population in seeds. as mentioned above, 24-nt srnas were highly accumulated in seeds , which was consistent with two recent studies in maize  <cit> .

identification and characterization of conserved mirnas
since mirna plays a important role in plant development, there is a growing number of both mature and precursor mirnas registered in the mirna database mirbase . there are currently  <dig> maize mature mirnas and  <dig> mirna precursors in the database . to identify conserved mirnas, small rna sequences were aligned to maize mature mirnas and precursors with perfect matches, and  <dig> conserved mirnas belonged to  <dig> mirna families and  <dig> mirnas belonged to  <dig> mirna families were identified in seeds and leaves, respectively. despite the similar family number, these conserved mirnas were generally more abundant in leaves , indicating that the regulation network that involves mirnas is more complicated in the vegetatively growing seedlings. however, there are mirnas that were less expressed in young leaves but relatively rich in seeds. our result indicated that the zma-mir319a/b/c/d and zma-mir169o were detected only in seeds, with  <dig> and  <dig> reads respectively, similar with mir <dig> expression in the developing seeds reported previously  <cit> . mir <dig> targets several tcp transcription factors in arabidopsis <cit>  and can affects seed size. several studies also revealed that mir319c, rather than mir319a/b, played a important role in arabidopsis leaf development  <cit> . in maize, mir <dig> was predicted to target several transcription factors including myb and tcp domain proteins  <cit> . most members of zma-mir <dig>  zma-mir <dig> and zma-mir <dig> families not only had higher reads but the reads were higher in seeds . mir <dig> targets several arf transcription factors that are important in controlling seed dispersal. a recent study reported that mir <dig> was sequestered by ago <dig> to prevent its loading to ago <dig>  consequently several hd-zip iii transcription factors were suppressed and this was critical for shoot apical meristem development  <cit> .

zma-mir <dig> and zma-mir <dig> were the top sequenced in seeds and leaves, respectively . intriguingly, one target of mir <dig> was ago <dig> which was essential for mirna maturation  <cit> , and the interaction between mir <dig> and ago <dig> maintained proper embryo development. besides, mir <dig> was also responsive for several salt-stresses in maize  <cit> . recent studies suggested that mir <dig> showed significant repression under low nitrate condition in maize roots and shoots  <cit> , while in t. dicoccoides, mir <dig> was down-regulated in leaves during drought stress  <cit> . other mirnas in high abundance include zma-mir <dig>  zma-mir <dig> and zma-mir <dig>  which were more than  <dig>  reads in both two tissues. in summary, these suggested a developmental and tissue-specific expression of mirnas, and therefore the more abundant mirnas in seeds should have key functions in regulating seed development.

diverse expression pattern of small rnas in seeds and leaves
as mentioned above, seeds and leaves had preferential expression of small rnas, these might be mainly due to the different developmental stage they stayed in. previous studies suggested that in the early stage of embryogenesis, mirnas inhibited genes from prematuration to preserve proper developmental stage  <cit> . in the immature seeds, a variety of environment and stress-response genes were relatively less expressed, and a number of these genes were the targets of mirnas, therefore the regulation network that involved mirnas could be less complicated than in other developmental stage. whereas the ever-growing seedings need more nutrition, and had to confront all substantial stresses and adjust themselves to survive. therefore, regulatory srnas in leaves should be more complicated. previous studies also suggested that, the mirna held at a relatively lower level in plant seeds rather than in other tissues  <cit> . the similar situation was also found in animal, as the targets of several mirnas were highly expressed in embryo than in other tissues, and the mirnas in turn were in low level in embryo  <cit> . the sequencing data in this study showed a similarity with those discussed above. total reads of conserved mature mirnas were more than 7-fold higher in leaves  compared with those in seeds , which was consistent with previous studies  <cit> . in the seed sequencing library, around 50% of signatures were 24-nt in length , and 20- <dig> nt srnas only took up  <dig> % of the population. in contrast, the most signatures in leaves were 21-nt srnas that accounted for 25% of total reads. previous study indicated that a number of seed srnas were most likely derived from repeat-associated sirnas   <cit> . in our case, the same situation was also found by scanning the folded clusters of srnas by repeatmasker. another sirna, called trans-acting sirna , was involved in controlling seed size, and both this tasirna and its target were conserved in rice and maize  <cit> . a recent study suggested that the sirna-mediated dna methylation was enhanced in seeds  <cit> . these findings indicated the sirna’s important role in seed development. in summary, our study showed that mirnas were lower expressed in seeds considering both total and unique number, indicating that mirna expression was still in initialization in seeds.

the role of mirna*s in plant development
during mirna biogenesis in plants, mirna:mirna* was spliced by dcl <dig> to produce functional mature mirna, while mirna* was assumed to be gradually degraded  <cit> . the established model of selection of functional mature strand was based on the thermodynamic structures of mirna:mirna* duplexes  <cit> , whereas the unstable strand was so-called “mirna*” and assumed to degrade to a nearly undetected level  <cit> . nevertheless, previous research suggested that mirna*s could also accumulate to a considerable level and down-regulate their target genes in both plants and animals  <cit> . in mouse, both the mir-30e-5p and mir-30e-3p could suppress the expression of their targets  <cit> . more recently, new evidence of mirna*-mediated mrna cleavage was found in medicago truncatula by degradome sequencing  <cit> . the same situation was found in maize as well  <cit> , indicating the yet less discovered function of mirna*. besides, due to the over-expression of mirna precursors, the enrichment of mirnas or mirna*s was proposed to affect their precursors via a feedback pathway. we noticed that in our sequencing result, a few of mirna*s had been highly sequenced in both two sequencing libraries . the total reads of mir408b* and mir396a*/b* were greater than the corresponding mature sequences, and both showed higher abundance in young leaves. mir408b* had the max reads of  <dig>  in leaves, which was even higher than the mature zma-mir408b . similarly, mirna396a*/b* were also more sequenced  than the mature mirna  in seeds. since mirna* may have the same function as mature mirna  <cit> , it is possible that these mirna*s can be de facto mirnas as well. in summary, these mirna genes should have alternative expression preferences according to the special developmental stage and environment.

validation of known mirna expression by mirna microarray
to further study the expression of conserved mirnas in maize seeds, we carried out mirna microarray analysis. the result indicated that, compared to leaves, all  <dig> mirna members from mir <dig> family had a average of  <dig> times detection signals higher in seeds, which further confirmed our sequencing result . moreover, mirnas of at least  <dig> times expression level higher in seeds were all from mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> family , indicating the important roles of these mirnas in seed development. mir <dig> was predicted to target basic-leucine zipper  genes in maize  <cit> , which could regulated many processes such as seed maturation, stress signalling and flower timing  <cit> . mir <dig> was predicted to target gras transcription factor that controlled gibberellic acid  signaling and phytochrome a signal transduction  <cit> . the more abundant mirnas in leaves were mir399a/c/d/e, mir <dig>  mir159c/d, mir156k/j, mir160a/b/c/d/e and mir164a/b/c/d, while the expression of mir399e was nearly 10-fold higher than that in seeds . mir <dig> targeted sbp transcription factor  <cit> , which affected shoot maturation in arabidopsis, mir159c/d and mir <dig> were predicted to target myb domain transcription factors  <cit> , and mir <dig> targeted arf transcription factors  <cit> . taken together, the highly expressed mirnas and the target types of these mirnas indicated the developing plants had a more sophisticated gene regulation mechanism and thus needed a number of regulators such as mirnas.

identification and characterization of novel maize mirnas
in plants, the pri-mirna transcript was spliced twice by dcl rnase  <cit> , and a hairpin-like mirna precursor was produced after the first cleavage. since the special structure, secondary structures of clusters were predicted by a rna folding program rnafold  <cit> , sequences that matched to the genome from seeds and leaves totally folded  <dig>  and  <dig>  clusters, respectively. previous studies suggested that the mirna precursors had a average minimal folding free energies index  of  <dig> , which was significantly higher than other non-coding rnas such as mrnas , rrnas  and trnas , and 90% of mirna precursors had an mfei greater than  <dig>  while no other rnas had this feature  <cit> . to validate these clusters, the mfei of these clusters was checked that it should be no less than  <dig> , finally  <dig> and  <dig> clusters were regarded as novel mirna precursors in seeds and leaves respectively , while the most abundant mirnas were regarded as novel mirnas. these novel mirnas can be further grouped into  <dig> mirna families from both seeds and leaves, representing  <dig> individual novel mirnas .four novel mirnas were experimentally validated by stem-loop rt-pcr and sequencing .

1“intron/intergenic” indicates full-length of pre-mirna localizes to that region, and “overlap” indicates pre-mirna overlaps with intron/exon or exon/intron .

as a further evidence, we had also detected some corresponding mirna*s of novel mirnas, though these mirna*s were low in abundance . the nucleotide composition analysis showed that more than 20% of novel mirnas start with u, which is statistically the typical property of mature mirnas  <cit> , and the overall nucleotide composition showed higher percentage of a and g . the genomic position analysis of these novel mirna precursors showed that most of pre-mirnas  localized to the intergenic regions, more than one third of pre-mirnas  were located within the intronic regions of protein-coding genes, and  <dig> pre-mirnas overlapped with adjacent intron/exon  or exon/intron  . the exact location of novel mirna genes may differ a little since the pri-mirnas were not cloned experimentally. to see if the newly identified mirnas were conserved in other plants, mirna sequences were blastn searched against the genome sequence of arabidopsis, rice and sorghum . the result indicates that  <dig> mirnas were conserved in sorghum,  <dig> mirnas conserved in rice and  <dig> mirna conserved in arabidopsis .

target prediction of novel mirnas
since the mirna and target duplexes are near-perfectly matched in plants, it is possible to find targets by computational approach. among the  <dig> newly identified mirnas,  <dig> had predicted targets that fulfilled the criteria described previously  <cit> . to make the prediction more reliable, we didn’t allow any mismatches at mirna position 2- <dig> with a max of  <dig> discontinuous mismatches in the pairing region . the additional screening suggested that  <dig> mirnas had the almost perfectly paired targets , while  <dig> out of the  <dig> targets had functional annotations in the interpro entries  <cit>  . the predicted targets belonged to various classes of molecular functions, such as dna/rna binding protein, protein kinase and other enzymes, or of biological processes, such as thiolase, cation transporter and lipid metabolic enzymes, or of several cellular components, indicating the mirna’s extensive role in gene regulation network. as shown in additional data, several mirnas targeted transcription factors, consistent with their functions reported earlier. zma-mir <dig> and zma-mir <dig> were predicted to target bzip- <dig> transcription factor, zma-mir <dig> targeted both mads-box and k-box transcription factor, and zma-mir19a and zma-mir20a targeted genes with myb dna-binding domain . all these genes had important regulation roles throughout plant development  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we had studied the mirna expression profile during maize seed development by combining small rna sequencing and mirna microarray. by srna sequencing,  <dig> and  <dig> conserved mirnas were identified in the developing seeds and young leaves, respectively. furthermore,  <dig> novel mirnas were identified which were not reported before, and potential targets were also predicted with strict criteria as described. both deep-sequencing and mirna microarray suggested that mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were highly expressed in the developing seeds. in addition, we found mirna408b* and mir396a*/b* had been accumulated to a level higher than their mature sequences.
