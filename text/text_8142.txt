BACKGROUND
well-resourced culture collections distribute bacteria mostly as freeze-dried ampoules  <cit> . on the other hand, most research labs generally do not exchange lyophilized cultures and over the past  <dig> years a good proportion of bacterial exchanges were either in agar stabs or on impregnated glycerolized discs, as also used by the coli genetic stock center . generally, comparison of storage and shipping conditions test for viability and all of the above methods work well in this regard for escherichia coli. recently however, we became concerned about heterogeneity arising during storage and exchange of cultures for two reasons. firstly, our recent studies with the ecor collection  <cit>  indicated a number of phenotypes had changed from those reported earlier . others have also noted discrepancies in results with the ecor collection between laboratories  <cit> . secondly, in recently exchanged stock cultures of e. coli k- <dig> between the ferenci and spira laboratories, we noted heterogeneities in some of the phenotypes we routinely assay. in this communication, we investigated the source of this heterogeneity and the role of storage conditions during shippage.

the instability of cultures and possible heterogeneities have been noted in several settings. bacteria in long term stab cultures were found to change in a number of respects  <cit> . extended incubation over several days in rich media also gives rise to population heterogeneity  <cit> . in both cases, one of the targets of change was the rpos gene. the sigma factor rpos is the master regulator of the general stress response in e. coli  <cit> . rpos coordinates the transcription of genes associated with the protection of bacteria against different types of stress, such as high osmolarity, oxygen free radicals, low temperature and others  <cit> . bacteria that lack rpos are more sensitive to environmental stresses, thus though rpos is not an essential gene, its presence strongly increases bacteria survival rates in stressful environments.

rpos levels are also shifted up under nutritional stress, namely carbon and phosphate starvation  <cit> . in stationary phase or in nutrient-limited chemostats, the accumulation of rpos in the cytosol reduces the expression of growth-related genes due to the competition between rpos and the vegetative sigma factor σ <dig> for a limited amount of rna polymerase core units  <cit> . this characterizes a trade-off in which the bacterium sacrifices growth in favour of expressing protection-related genes. under prolonged starvation periods a genetic adjustment follows when mutations in rpos or in genes that control rpos expression occur, resetting the spanc  balance  <cit> . the rpos gene is highly polymorphic and many different alleles are found in both natural isolates and laboratory strains of e. coli  <cit> . this strong variation is expected given the pivotal role of rpos in determining the spanc balance  <cit>  and is central to the instabilities we observe in mailed cultures.

the strain we exchanged was a derivative of mc <dig>  a widely used e. coli strain spread in many laboratories around the world. mc <dig> stored at ferenci's laboratory in australia  <cit>  was shown to express high levels of both rpos and ppgpp  <cit> . this version of mc <dig>  efficiently exhibits protection-related phenotypes, such as resistance to stresses and glycogen production but is less competent in metabolising alternative carbon sources. it also tends to accumulate mutations in rpos following 2- <dig> days of growth in a chemostat under carbon or phosphate limitation  <cit> . it has been shown that a pair of point mutations at the n-terminus of the ppgpp-hydrolase spot is responsible for the high levels of ppgpp displayed by mc4100tf  <cit> . because ppgpp has a positive effect on rpos  <cit> , the high level of ppgpp partially explains the strong rpos-related phenotypes in mc4100tf. in addition, genome sequencing of this strain revealed the presence of an is <dig> insertion in the rssb locus  <cit> . rssb acts as a chaperone that presents rpos to the protease clpxp, enhancing rpos proteolyis  <cit> . thus, it was postulated that disruption of rssb contributes to the high-rpos level in this strain, but no direct evidence has been presented.

here we show that mc <dig> readily accumulates mutations that suppress the high-rpos phenotype when incubated in lb-stabs either during shipping or under laboratory conditions. ten of these segregants were analysed and shown to carry null mutations in the rpos orf. it is also demonstrated that the is <dig> insertion in rssb is the main factor that upregulates rpos in mc <dig> 

RESULTS
segregation of rpos mutants in lb stabs
lb stabs of mc4100tf have been sent from ferenci's laboratory in australia to spira's laboratory in brazil by air mail on three different occasions. upon arrival bacteria were streaked on lb agar and isolated colonies were checked for their rpos status by iodine staining . mc4100tf stains darkly with iodine, but many colonies from these shipments displayed heterogeneity in iodine staining; this generally means variations in rpos levels  <cit> . the third shipment consisted of two lb stabs, one containing mc4100tf and the other one strain bw <dig> . bacteria were removed from each stab, suspended in  <dig> % nacl, diluted and plated on lb agar and stained with iodine. the proportion of low-staining colonies in these stabs was between 29% and 61%.

this prompted us to ask whether the shipping conditions to which the bacteria were exposed during the transcontinental flights selected mutations that caused the loss of the high-staining phenotype. to mimic the conditions during transport, a single fresh colony of mc4100tf was inoculated into an lb stab, and incubated at room temperature for  <dig> days. following the incubation period bacteria were streaked on minimal medium plates supplemented with the alkaline phosphatase  substrate x-p ; ap expression is inversely correlated with rpos level  <cit> . several colonies were light blue, but others showed a more intense blue colour, indicating a low-rpos status . ten of these low-rpos segregants were isolated and further analysed.

the segregants were tested for rpos-dependent phenotypes , for rpos concentration by immunoblotting and for the presence of the is <dig> insertion in rssb . amplification of rssb by pcr showed that all segregants retained the is <dig> insertion and were therefore, rssb deficient. despite that, all segregants stained lightly with iodine and showed a strong blue colour on tgp+x-p plates, suggesting that rpos is very low or lacking in these strains . a western-blot analysis revealed that with the exception of segregant number  <dig>  a band corresponding to rpos could not be detected in the nine other strains, suggesting that they carry null mutations in rpos .

to identify the mutations present in the  <dig> low-rpos segregants, the rpos orf of each strain was sequenced. the results are summarised in table  <dig>  six strains  carry an adenine deletion at position  <dig> of rpos orf, which results in a frameshift and the formation of premature stop codons. segregants  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> have a taaag deletion , which also causes a frameshift. finally, segregant  <dig> carries an i128n substitution in the rpos protein. this strain displayed high levels of rpos , but behaved as an rpos null mutant, suggesting that rpos activity was severely undermined by the i128n mutation. residue  <dig> is located in region  <dig>  of the rpos protein. the exact function of region  <dig>  is unknown, but a tentative tertiary structure of this region showed that it is formed by a helix whose polar surface constitutes one of the primary interfaces with rna polymerase  <cit> . replacement of a hydrophobic by a polar amino acid at this position is likely to impair rpos interaction with the core rna polymerase, strongly inhibiting the formation of eσs holoenzyme and consequently the transcription of rpos-dependent genes, such as glgs, involved in glycogen synthesis  <cit> . as predicted by the trade-off hypothesis, once rpos loses the ability to compete with σ <dig> for the binding to core rna polymerase, the expression of σ70-dependent genes, such as phoa would increase, explaining the high level of ap showed by this mutant  <cit> .

to further measure the frequency of emergence of rpos mutations in lb stabs, a set of  <dig> stabs were inoculated each with a single mc4100tf fresh colony. the stabs were incubated for several weeks at room temperature and every week three stabs were tested for the rpos status in each population. each time bacteria were scraped off two different stabs, resuspended in saline, serially diluted and plated on lb agar. bacteria from a third stab were streaked directly onto an lb plate for a qualitative analysis of the rpos status. the colonies were then stained with iodine. figure  <dig> shows the evolution of rpos segregation in the stabs. at day  <dig>  all tested bacteria were rpos+, but by day  <dig> onwards, the presence of many low-rpos colonies became apparent both in the quantitative  and qualitative  plates. the exact proportion of these mutants varied from week to week, but was never lower than 40%.

a common and inexpensive alternative to lb-stabs is a bacterial suspension in filter disks in the presence of glycerol. to test this transporting method, a culture of mc4100tf was resuspended in 15% glycerol  and  <dig>  ml of the suspension was applied onto a filter disk, which was placed in a small plastic bag and sealed. glycerol filter disks were prepared along with the stabs reported in figure  <dig> and stored at room temperature. every week a pair of disks was removed from their plastic bags suspended in a small volume of saline and streaked on lb agar. until day  <dig> all colonies recovered from the filter disks displayed a high-rpos phenotype . from day  <dig> onward a significant proportion  of the bacteria recovered from the filter disks were low-rpos. furthermore, there was an increasing reduction in the number of colonies recovered every week, possibly due to prolonged starvation and dehydration of the filter disks . it is clear, though, that the glycerol filter disks preserved the genetic integrity of the bacteria for a longer period of time than the lb-stabs. therefore, the use of glycerol filter disks for bacterial shipment is preferable.

the data presented here indicate that the use of lb-stabs for the exchange of bacteria between laboratories is undermined by genetic instability. alternative storage and shipment forms, such as freeze-drying, glycerol filter disks or dry ice must be considered. some of them are costly  or dependent on specific equipments  and none is free of drawbacks. as a matter of fact, induction of mutations during the freeze-drying process has been reported  <cit> . glycerol filter disks provide an inexpensive and easy alternative for bacterial shipping. since the filters lack essential nutrients we expect very little or no bacterial growth and hence a significant reduction in mutant segregation.

ever since the pioneer work of the kolter group  <cit> , several papers have reported the occurrence of rpos mutations that confer selective advantage in stationary phase   <cit> . accordingly, sequence variation of rpos in e. coli natural isolates is extensively well documented  <cit> . even in archival cultures, a high proportion of rpos mutants has been observed  <cit> . this is not surprising because genomic rearrangements in stab cultures stored for long periods of time are common  <cit> , implying that long-term storage in stabs produces an environment that selects for a variety of mutations. indeed, discrepancies among archival strain collections, like the ones found in the ecor collection  <cit>  and in bacterial strains used in compendial microbiological tests  <cit>  are not uncommon.

to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on rapid evolution in lb-stabs. this has implications not only for the storage of bacteria in the laboratory, which is less significant today because most bacteria collections are kept at -70°c freezers, but mainly to bacterial exchange by the scientific community. we demonstrated the emergence of mixed populations of rpos+ and rpos attenuated bacteria in lb-stabs of mc4100tf  even after one-week incubation. this strain exhibits high levels of rpos. high-rpos strains tend to accumulate mutations in rpos in order to reset the spanc balance, i.e., to eliminate the competition between σ <dig> and rpos enhancing the transcription of growth-related genes. however, rpos loss is not restricted only to mc4100tf as other e. coli strains, even some with not particularly high rpos  have shown to accumulate mutations in rpos under nutrient limiting conditions  <cit> . although in the present study, the only tested variation was regarding rpos, it is clear that other genes, such as lrp  may also be affected during short-term incubation in lb-stabs, and this caveat should be taken into account when posting bacteria via air mail. it should also be noted that evolution in lb stabs are likely to occurr in other bacteria species, even in the ones regarded as more stable . this possibility can be empirically tested in the future.

the relation between rssb and rpos in mc <dig> derivatives
sequence analysis of mc4100tf showed that it carries an is <dig> insertion at the 5'-end of the rssb orf  <cit> , whose product facilitates the proteolysis of rpos  <cit> . disruption of rssb is likely to contribute to the intrinsic high level of rpos in mc4100tf because stocks of mc <dig> maintained in other laboratories around the world do not carry the is <dig> insertion in rssb and do not exhibit high levels of rpos  <cit> , but a direct evidence is still lacking. furthermore, none of the tested segregants have reverted the rssb mutation, though a rssb+ allele would supposedly diminish the level of rpos in this strain.

therefore, to test if the is <dig> insertion in rssb is related to the intrinsic high-rpos level in mc4100tf, a series of experiments was conducted. the rssab+ operon was cloned in a low-copy plasmid  and transformed into mc4100tf to complement the rssb::is <dig> mutation. in parallel, the rssb gene of mc4100bs  was knocked-out by the introduction of a kmr cassete. rpos-dependent phenotypes, such as glycogen accumulation, alkaline phosphatase activity and growth on acetate as the sole carbon source   <cit>  were assayed in strains mc4100tf, mc4100bs, mc4100bs rssb::kmr and mc4100tf carrying pbs <dig>  figure 3a shows that mc4100tf and mc4100bs rssb::kmr stained dark with iodine, showed low ap activity and poor growth on acetate, as expected for high-rpos strains. conversely, mc4100bs and mc4100tf carrying pbs <dig> accumulated less glycogen, more ap and grew stronger on acetate, all characteristics of low-rpos strains. an immunoblot with an anti-rpos serum confirmed that both mc4100tf and mc4100bs rssb::kmr displayed high levels of rpos when compared to mc4100bs  . altogether, these results demonstrate that the intrinsic high level of rpos in strain mc4100tf is indeed caused by the is <dig> insertion in rssb. there is a priori no reason why the rssb+ genotype would not be restored in mc4100tf, but we did not detect it in any of the tested low-rpos segregants. on top of its role in rpos proteolysis rssb helps modulating polyadenylation and degradation of specific mrnas, and its overexpression is toxic for the cell  <cit> . thus, it is possible that under the conditions tested , mutations in rpos would be less costly than reversion of the rssb::is <dig> mutation. indeed, many evolution experiments in chemostats with mc4100tf have been carried out, but reversion of the rssb::is <dig> mutation has not been observed in any of them  <cit> .

another potential input that might be upregulating rpos in mc4100tf is ppgpp  <cit> . ppgpp synthesis and degradation are driven by the products of the rela and spot genes  <cit> . mc4100tf carries two mutations in spot   <cit> . when transferred to another e. coli strain, this spot allele increased both ppgpp and rpos levels. however, high levels of ppgpp and the same spot mutations are present in mc4100bs as well  <cit> . therefore, ppgpp cannot explain the high rpos level in mc4100tf, which is mainly due to the knock-out of rssb.

CONCLUSIONS
mutations in the rpos locus or in genes that regulate rpos expression are powerful drivers of genetic instability or adaptability both in the laboratory and in nature. growth and storage of bacteria in lb-stabs for short periods, such as the time it takes to mail a letter between different continents, is sufficient for the accumulation of rpos mutations in high proportions. mutations that inactivate or attenuate rpos confer on the bacteria the gasp phenotype, explaining why they are so common across the species e. coli. a better alternative for the shipment of bacterial strains is the use of glycerol filter disks, in which a small volume of a bacteria culture resuspended in 15% glycerol is applied to a filter disk in a sealed plastic bag. finally, of the many inputs that regulate rpos, it was demonstrated that the high level of rpos in strain mc4100tf is mainly due to an is <dig> insertion in rssb.
