BACKGROUND
flower color of soybean  merr.) is primarily controlled by six genes   <cit> . under w <dig> genotype, soybean genotype with w3w <dig> has dark purple, w3w <dig> has dilute purple or purple throat, w3w <dig> has purple, and w3w <dig> has near white flowers  <cit> . flower color of genotypes with allelic combination w1w3w <dig> was indistinguishable from those with white flowers under many environments, suggesting that environments affect flower color under the allelic combination  <cit> . w <dig> and w <dig> encode dihydroflavonol 4-reductase   <cit> . w <dig>  w <dig>  wm and wp encode flavonoid 3′5′-hydroxylase, myb transcription factor, flavonol synthase and flavanone 3-hydroxylase, respectively  <cit> . the roles of these genes in the biosynthesis of anthocyanin and flavonol are presented in figure  <dig> 

the flavonoids in flower petals of soybean were analyzed  <cit> . the primary components of anthocyanin were malvidin  <dig> -di-o-glucoside, petunidin  <dig> -di-o-glucoside, delphinidin  <dig> -di-o-glucoside and delphinidin 3-o-glucoside. in addition, eight flavonol glycosides, kaempferol 3-o-gentiobioside, kaempferol 3-o-rutinoside, kaempferol 3-o-glucoside, kaempferol 3-o-glycoside, kaempferol 3-o-rhamnosyl--, kaempferol 7-o-glucoside, kaempferol 7-o-diglucoside and quercetin 3-o-gentiobioside, and one dihydroflavonol, aromadendrin 3-o-glucoside were identified. no anthocyanins were detected in clark-w <dig>  a near-isogenic line  of us cultivar clark at the w <dig> locus. anthocyanins were not detected in a clark-w <dig> in  <dig> and  <dig>  but trace amounts were detected in  <dig>  <cit> , indicating slight responsiveness to environmental conditions in agreement with the previous report  <cit> .

a mutable allele of the w <dig> locus was discovered in a cross between two experimental lines with white and purple flowers, respectively  <cit> . the mutant line was designated as t <dig>  and the mutable allele was designated as w4-m. mutant lines t <dig> with w4-dp allele  and t <dig> with w4-p allele  were isolated from descendants of t <dig>  <cit>  . a  <dig> -kb transposable element  was isolated from the second intron of the dfr <dig> gene  <cit> . in t <dig> and t <dig>  tgm <dig> was excised from the second intron, leaving behind 4- and 0-bp footprints, respectively  <cit> . a 5′ end fragment of tgm <dig>  was integrated at a position 1043 bp upstream of the transcription start site in t <dig>  a fragment of tgm <dig> was inserted at a position 1034 bp upstream of the transcription start site in t <dig>  soybean has two other dfr genes, dfr <dig> and dfr <dig> <cit> . dna marker analysis suggested that w <dig> locus might correspond to the dfr <dig> <cit> .

flower color of the wild relative of soybean, glycine soja sieb. & zucc. is almost exclusively purple; by contrast, 33%  of the soybean accessions in the usda soybean germplasm collections have white flowers . one white-flowered plant was found in  <dig> among the progeny of a purple-flowered g. soja accession that was introduced from south korea  <cit> . genetic analysis indicated that the white flower was caused by a recessive allele at the w <dig> locus similar to the white-flowered soybeans  <cit> . the mutation may have occurred during propagation at usda. in  <dig>  a variant with light purple flowers, b <dig> was discovered in southern japan  <cit> . genetic analysis suggested the light purple color was controlled by a new allele at the w <dig> locus, w1-lp. flower petals of b <dig> contained lower amounts of the four major anthocyanins common in purple flowers and contained small amounts of the 5′-unsubstituted versions of the abovementioned anthocyanins, peonidin  <dig> -di-o-glucoside, cyanidin  <dig> -di-o-glucoside and cyanidin 3-o-glucoside  <cit> . b <dig> may be the first example of a flower color variant of g. soja found in nature.

lines varying in flower color were obtained from mutagenized populations of us cultivar bay. line 222-a- <dig> with near white flowers was isolated from an x-ray treated population, whereas line e30-d- <dig> with light purple flowers was developed from an ems-treated population  <cit>  . dr. donghe xu  found kw <dig>  a g. soja accession with near white flowers, among accessions introduced from south korea  . it is unknown if the accession has near white flowers in the natural habitat. this study was conducted to investigate the genetic and chemical basis of flower color variants in g. max  and in g. soja .

analysis of flavonoids
banner petals were collected at the day of opening from field-grown plants in  <dig>  three 200 mg samples of banner petals were collected in 2 ml of meoh containing  <dig> %  hcl for anthocyanin analysis. three 200 mg samples in 2 ml of absolute meoh were also collected for the determination of flavonol and dihydroflavonol. high performance liquid chromatography  of anthocyanins, flavonols and dihydroflavonol was performed following previously described protocols  <cit> . the 2 ml extracts were filtered through disposable filtration units  and 10 μl from each sample was subjected to hplc analysis. the amount of flavonoids was estimated from the pertinent peak area in the hplc chromatogram . the peak area was subjected to analysis of variance using the statistica software .

molecular cloning

molecular cloning
dna fragments of about  <dig>  kb were amplified by rt-pcr in clark, bay, 222-a- <dig> and e30-d- <dig> . fragments of about  <dig>  kb were amplified from clark-w <dig>  no amplification product was observed in kw <dig>  the coding region of dfr <dig> gene of clark and bay were 1065 bp long and they encoded  <dig> amino acids. amino acids were identical except for two substitutions around the c-terminus at positions  <dig>  and  <dig> . comparison of nucleotide sequences between cdna and genomic dna of clark revealed that the dfr <dig> gene has six exons and five introns similar to a previous report   <cit> .

bay had a t at nucleotide position  <dig> which was absent in 222-a- <dig>  this deletion probably generated a truncated polypeptide consisting of only  <dig> amino acids . the polypeptide lacked the nadph binding domain  <cit> . in e30-d- <dig>  a single base was substituted from g to a at nucleotide position  <dig> compared with bay . the base-substitution altered amino acid at position  <dig> from arginine to histidine. the 5′ upstream region of e30-d- <dig> was identical with that of bay and clark. in clark-w <dig>  cdna had a 344-bp insertion compared with clark and bay. the insertion corresponded to the fourth intron with five nucleotide substitutions compared with clark, suggesting that the fourth intron was retained in clark-w <dig>  in clark-w <dig>  a single-base g at the start of the fourth intron was changed to a compared with the genome sequence of clark . the base substitution may have abolished the 5′ splice site  resulting in the retention of the intron . the retention caused a mutation from amino acid position  <dig> and premature translation termination at amino acid position  <dig> .

in kw <dig>  transcripts of the dfr <dig> gene in the flower petals were not detected by rt-pcr. the genomic fragment containing the entire coding region was amplified by pcr. six exons and five introns were assumed similar to clark . the amino acid sequence was identical with that of clark. a 367-bp fragment was deleted in the third intron of kw <dig> . the 5′ upstream region of kw <dig> had six single-base substitutions, three single-base indels, two two-base indels and a three-base alteration including one indel .

caps analysis
pcr with caps primers generated amplified products of 377 bp in bay, clark, clark-w <dig>  222-a- <dig> and e30-d- <dig> . digestion with bsrgi generated a band of 194 bp in e30-d- <dig>  whereas the bands were not digested in the other materials . caps analysis of an f <dig> population derived from a cross between e30-d- <dig> and clark-w <dig> together with the f <dig> progeny tests revealed that plants fixed with light purple flowers had only a shorter band, plants fixed with near white flowers had only a longer band and plants segregating for flower color had both bands. thus, the caps marker co-segregated with flower color.

quantitative real-time pcr
results of real-time pcr are presented in figure  <dig>  transcript level of t <dig> was low and  <dig> % of bay. transcript levels of 222-a- <dig>  e30-d- <dig> and clark-w <dig> were much lower at  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively. transcripts of the dfr <dig> gene of kw <dig> were not detected by real-time pcr. in contrast to the above flower color variants, the transcript level of t <dig> was about  <dig>  times of bay .

discussion
previous studies revealed that the w <dig> gene was mutated in flower color variants, clark-w <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig>  <cit> . in this study, complementation tests revealed that the flower color of 222-a- <dig> and e30-d- <dig>  and that of a g. soja accession, kw <dig>  was also controlled by this gene. amino acid polymorphism or null expression of the dfr <dig> gene was associated with flower color variation.

in 222-a- <dig>  a single-base deletion caused a frame-shift mutation from amino acid position 11; this is expected to produce a truncated polypeptide of only  <dig> amino acids that lacked the nadph binding domain. thus, the dfr <dig> transcript of 222-a- <dig> may be nonfunctional. in clark-w <dig>  the first nucleotide of the fourth intron was substituted from g to a. the base substitution in clark-w <dig> may have abolished the 5′ splice site . retention of the fourth intron caused a frame-shift mutation and changed subsequent amino acids. translation was prematurely terminated at amino acid position  <dig>  dfr genes have many amino acids conserved across plant species in the downstream of the mutation  <cit> . the results strongly suggest that the dfr <dig> gene of clark-w <dig> is not functioning. in kw <dig>  the dfr <dig> gene was not expressed in flower petals. a 367-bp fragment was deleted from the third intron of this gene in kw <dig>  however, it is not clear whether the deletion in the intron might be responsible for null gene expression. therefore, we investigated the 5′ upstream region to check if any mutation occurred in the promoter region. there were many nucleotide polymorphisms in the 5′ upstream region; six single-base substitutions, three single-base indels, two two-base indels and a three-base alteration including an indel. the accumulation of a substantial number of mutations in the promoter region, which is probably the reason for non-transcription of this locus in kw <dig>  is characteristic of genes that are being deactivated into pseudogenes. promoter assays may be necessary to determine which polymorphism is critical for gene expression. features of dna sequences in clark-w <dig>  222-a- <dig> and kw <dig> strongly suggest that complete loss-of-function of dfr <dig> gene may lead to substantial reduction of anthocyanins and near white flowers.

soybean has three variants of dfr genes, dfr <dig>  dfr <dig> and dfr <dig> <cit> . the function of dfr <dig> may be partially supplemented by the activity of other dfr genes depending on environmental conditions. the transcript level of clark-w <dig> and 222-a- <dig> was substantially lower than that of bay, probably because of nonsense-mediated mrna decay, a surveillance mechanism to eliminate aberrant mrna transcripts that contain premature stop codons  <cit> .

the 5′ upstream regions of the dfr <dig> gene in e30-d- <dig>  bay and clark were identical. in the first exon of e30-d- <dig>  however, a single-base substitution altered an amino acid at position  <dig> from arginine to histidine. the position of the residue was slightly downstream of the nadph binding region. no catalytic domain has been assigned to the region, but the arginine residue is conserved across eight plant species  <cit> . further, caps marker to detect the base substitution co-segregated with flower color. these results suggest that the amino acid substitution might have affected transcript abundance and/or dfr function resulting in reduced anthocyanin contents and paler flower color. transgenic experiments may be necessary to ascertain the functional importance of this residue.

flavonol glycoside content in flower petals of t <dig> was similar to that of clark. in contrast, that of t <dig> was  <dig> % of clark. the dfr <dig> gene was over-expressed in flower petals of t <dig> but it was barely expressed in t <dig>  the reduction of flavonol glycosides in t <dig> may be explained by substrate competition between over-expressed dfr and flavonol synthase . flower petals of t <dig> contained substantially lower amounts of d <dig> but it had unique dihydroflavonol components, d <dig> and d <dig>  that are absent in the soybean and g. soja accessions analyzed so far. over-expression of dfr <dig> gene may be responsible for the unique dihydroflavonol composition. chemical structure of d <dig> and d <dig> should be determined to investigate the novel features of dfr <dig> function displayed by t <dig> 

in t <dig> and t <dig>  tgm <dig> was excised from the second intron of the dfr <dig> gene, leaving behind 4- and 0-bp footprints, respectively  <cit> . a 5′ end fragment of tgm <dig>  was integrated at the 1043 bp upstream of the transcription start site in t <dig>  a fragment of tgm <dig> was inserted at the 1034 bp upstream of the transcription start site in t <dig>  <cit> . in both cases, excision of tgm <dig> may not be the cause of flower color change, because tgm <dig> resides in the intron, and footprints, if any, are not likely to substantially affect gene expression. instead, re-insertion into the promoter region is more likely responsible. the upstream promoter regions of structural anthocyanin biosynthesis genes contain cis regulatory elements that affect pigmentation patterns or intensity  <cit> . it is interesting to determine the role of 9-bp differences in the tgm <dig> integration site in the expression of the dfr <dig> gene. detailed promoter assays may be necessary to identify the cis element regulating the expression of this gene.

dfr <dig> gene of soybean controls intensity and distribution of pigmentation in flower petals. mutation of the gene results in unique flavonoid composition and a wide variety of flower color patterns, from near white, light purple, dilute purple to pale.

CONCLUSIONS
the flower colors of 222-a- <dig>  clark-w <dig>  e30-d- <dig>  kw <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> were controlled by the w <dig> gene encoding dfr <dig>  in 222-a- <dig>  a single-base deletion probably produced a truncated polypeptide consisting of  <dig> amino acids. in clark-w <dig>  base substitution of the first nucleotide of the fourth intron abolished the 5′ splice site, resulting in the retention of the intron. the dfr <dig> gene of kw <dig> was not expressed. the above results suggest that complete loss-of-function of dfr <dig> gene leads to near white flowers. flower color of e30-d- <dig> was controlled by a new allele of the w <dig> locus, w4-lp. in e30-d- <dig>  a single-base substitution changed an amino acid at position  <dig> from arginine to histidine. in t <dig>  expression of dfr <dig> gene was  <dig>  times that of purple flowers, and the flower petals contained unique dihydroflavonols which are absent in other g. max and g. soja accessions. thus, mutations of dfr <dig> gene results in unique flavonoid compositions and a wide variety of flower color patterns in soybean, ranging from near white, light purple, dilute purple to pale.
