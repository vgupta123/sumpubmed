BACKGROUND
hdgf  is a heparin binding protein originally isolated from conditioned media of a human hepatoma  cell line. hdgf was subsequently shown to be a mitogen for many cell types with nuclear localization necessary for its mitogenic activity  <cit> . expression of hdgf is developmentally regulated in at least the renal, cardiovascular and pulmonary systems  <cit>  and re-expressed at least in the both the lung  <cit>  and the arterial wall in response to injury  <cit> , suggesting a role in tissue repair. hdgf has also been identified at least as an important prognostic marker in pathologic cell growth, as it is overexpressed in a number of cancers with expression linked to a poor outcome in lung, esophageal, pancreatic and hepatic cancer  <cit> .

many nuclear proteins undergo post-translational modification to regulate their activity. this is most clearly demonstrated by the cell cycle regulatory cyclin and cdk proteins which undergo both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation to regulate their activity . previously we had shown by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis that hdgf in human melanoma cells has multiple isoforms that migrated with the same mass in sds but had different pi  <cit> , suggesting post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation. in addition, in a proteomic screen for phosphorylated nuclear proteins, hdgf was identified by mass spectrometry to have multiple phosphorylated serines  <cit> . whether hdgf is indeed phosphorylated in vivo, and whether phosphorylation affects hdgf function are all unknown.

in the present study, we detail that hdgf is indeed a phosphoprotein, identify s <dig> as a significant phosphorylation site and demonstrate that phosphorylation of s <dig> plays a critical role in regulating hdgf mitogenic function.

methods
cell culture
hek-293t, mda-mb <dig> and cos- <dig> cells were obtained from atcc . low passage mouse primary aortic vascular smooth muscle cells  were isolated as previously described  <cit>  and all lines maintained in dmem supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum  at 37°c in 5% co <dig>  for proliferation experiments vsmc were serum starved for  <dig> hours, then incubated overnight with brdu . for cell cycle arrest studies, mda-mb <dig> cells were seeded at  <dig> cells/ml in  <dig> well dishes containing a cover slip and dmem with 10% serum. after  <dig> h cells were left in serum free  media for overnight. next morning cells were re-stimulated with 10% fcs. after  <dig> h cells were treated with or without  <dig> nm nocodazole for next  <dig> h. next morning cells were briefly washed with ice cold pbs and fixed with 4% formaldehyde in dpbs.

plasmids and transfections
full length wild type rat hdgf was cloned in pk7-gfp and pkh <dig>   <cit>  and substitution of serine   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> to alanine  or aspartic acid  was done using pcr .  <dig> ×  <dig> hek-293t, cos- <dig> or vsmc cells were plated in  <dig> mm dishes and transfected the following day with  <dig> ug of plasmid dna using calcium phosphate  or fugene  according to the manufacturers' recommendations.

fluorescent activated cell sorting
hek-293t cells were transfected as above to express gfp or gfp-hdgf fusions.  <dig> hours after transfection cells were processed for cell cycle facs analysis with gating for no gfp and gfp after the method of schmid and sakamoto  <cit>   using modfit lt software . cell cycle analysis was expressed as percent in g <dig>  g <dig> and s. each facs analysis was performed in triplicate with the results pooled from 4- <dig> separate experiments.

antibodies and immunoblotting
anti-phospho-s103-hdgf was generated by biosource  using a synthetic phosphopeptide corresponding to amino acids 95- <dig> of human hdgf with an n-terminal cysteine qkks) for coupling to keyhole limpet hemocyanin.

western blot analysis was performed as previously described  <cit> . briefly, phosphorylated proteins were enriched from  <dig> ×  <dig> cos- <dig> cells using the phosphoprotein purification kit  following the manufacturers instructions. for immunoblot analysis, cos- <dig> whole cell lysates and isolated proteins  were separated by 10% sds-page and transferred to trans-blot transfer medium . blots were blocked in tbs-t  and 5% bovine albumin  for one hour and probed with either anti-phospho-s103-hdgf  or anti-hdgf  in tbs-t for  <dig> hour at room temperature. after washing with tbs-t membranes were incubated with an anti-rabbit secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase . after washing, the blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence .

immunocytochemistry
immunocytochemical analysis was performed as previously described  <cit> . briefly, cos- <dig> cells grown on glass coverslips in six well plates were fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde for  <dig> minutes at room temperature then washed with cold pbs. separate coverslips were incubated with the anti-hdgf  or anti-phospho-s103-hdgf . control coverslips were incubated with no primary antibody or preabsorbed primary antibody with  <dig> μg of the s <dig> phosphopeptide described above at the same concentration as the primary antibody. for brdu detection, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for  <dig> minutes at room temperature, with brdu detected using a mouse monoclonal anti-brdu antibody . vector red  was used as a fluorescent substrate to identify specific hdgf or brdu staining and dapi as a specific dna counterstain. images were acquired on a nikon eclipse  <dig> microscope equipped with a micropublisher digital camera  and merged using adobe photoshop cs software . for nocodazole cell cycle arrest studies, mda-mb <dig> cells were immunostained for anti-phospho-s103-hdgf and fluorescent microscope acquired images analyzed by nikon nis-element software. the total number of cells was counted by detecting size and intensity of dapi staining. the number of phospho-s <dig> positive cells was identified as having at least  <dig> times more intense staining than non-treated control cells. cells were counted from at least  <dig> different fields per coverslip for each experiment with a total of  <dig> individual experiments performed. results were expressed as percent of phospho-s103-hdgf positive nuclei analyzed using a non-paired t-test with a p value of <  <dig>  considered as significant.

RESULTS
hdgf is a phosphoprotein
previously we found multiple forms of hdgf by 2d gels and suspected this was due to a post-translational modification such as phosphorylation that could change the pi of the protein. the netphosk  <dig>  computer algorithm  <cit>  using statistical ranking identified s <dig> as the most likely candidate site for phosphorylation . in addition, s <dig> and s <dig> were recently identified as phosphorylation sites in hdgf by mass spectrometry of hela nuclear and ht- <dig> cell extracts  <cit> . sequence comparisons confirmed that s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> are conserved in mouse, rat and human hdgf. cos- <dig> cells were transfected to express gfp fusions of wild type hdgf or s103a, s165a or s202a substitution hdgf polypeptides and metabolically radiolabeled with  orthophosphate for  <dig> hours. the tagged proteins were recovered by anti-gfp immunoprecipitation and as shown in figure  <dig>  hdgf wt was phosphorylated and phosphorylation of the s103a, s165a and s202a were reduced relative to wild type  demonstrating that all three of these serines were kinase substrates.

hdgf s <dig> is phosphorylated during mitosis
to further explore hdgf s <dig> phosphorylation we developed a phospho-s103-hdgf antibody. western blotting of enriched cos- <dig> phosphoproteins demonstrated detection of s103-hdgf phosphorylation . the phospho-s103-hdgf antibody identified both the high and low mass hdgf protein bands from the same cos- <dig> cell lysate detected with a wild type hdgf antibody  <cit> . with the phospho-s <dig> hdgf antibody, the higher mass hdgf band was less distinct compared to the lower mass band, but obvious with longer exposure. to map the expression of s103-hdgf, we immunostained cos- <dig> cells with both total and phospho-s103-hdgf antibodies . using the total hdgf antibody and cos- <dig> cells, hdgf was highly expressed in  <dig> % of nuclei and with the phospho-s103-hdgf antibody, only  <dig> % of cell nuclei were immuno-positive . of interest, the nuclei positive for phospho-s103-hdgf were all undergoing mitosis , based on the condensed chromatin. importantly preabsorbing the antibody with the target phosphopeptide, or the absence of the primary antibody in the immunostaining reaction demonstrated that staining was specific . further study  revealed that phospho-s103-hdgf was only detected during mitosis. phospho-s103-hdgf was first detectable at the time of nuclear condensation and breakdown of the nuclear envelope, peaks at metaphase with alignment of chromosomes along the metaphase plate and disappears with daughter cell separation in anaphase. this was also evident when we cell cycle arrested cells with nocodazole and stained those cells with the phospho-s103-hdgf antibody . nocodazole mitotic arrest significantly increased the number of phospho-s103-hdgf positive cells when compared to controls .

phosphorylation of s <dig> is necessary for hdgf mitogenic function
hdgf is a potent mitogen for vsmc  <cit> . to examine the role of hdgf s <dig> phosphorylation in function as a mitogen, mouse vsmc were transfected to express gfp-hdgf s103a. cells were serum starved for  <dig> hours then pulse-labeled with brdu. brdu incorporation  into dna  by transfected  cells was detected by fluorescent immunocytochemistry. as shown in figure  <dig>  hdgf-s103a traffics normally to the nucleus, demonstrating that s <dig> phosphorylation is not required for nuclear translocation or retention. however as shown in figure  <dig>  hdgf-s103a did not stimulate brdu incorporation, showing it was not acting as a mitogen.

phosphorylation of hdgf s <dig> is necessary for cell cycle progression
to test for a possible role of phosphorylation in hdgf function, s <dig> was mutated to an aspartic acid  as a phospho-mimic residue. the effect of hdgf-s103d on cell proliferation was tested with asynchronous hek- <dig> cells transfected to express, gfp fused to wild type hdgf, hdgf s103a or s103d and cell cycle analysis performed by facs on the gfp positive cells and the gfp negative cells from the same sample as a control. as shown in figure 7a, consistent with hdgf being a growth factor, hdgf significantly decreased the percentage of cells in g <dig>  and increased the percentage in g <dig>  as compared to gfp. unlike hdgf, hdgf s103a did not decrease the cell population in g <dig> , or increase the fraction of cells in s+g <dig> . in contrast to hdgf s103a, hdgf s103d significantly decreased the fraction of cells in g <dig>  and increased the fraction of cells in the s+g <dig> phase . therefore expression of hdgf s103d, a phospho-mimic, was a more potent mitogen than wild type hdgf and loss of phosphorylation on s <dig> abrogated hdgfs mitogenic function. this effect on the cell cycle was limited to transfected cells as non-transfected cells from the same plate demonstrated normal cell cycle proportions . this demonstrates that the effects on the cell cycle were not transfection artifacts.

discussion
hdgf is an abundant nuclear protein with activity as a mitogen, in that it stimulates cell cycle progression. in this study we demonstrate phosphorylation of s <dig> during mitosis and show this phosphorylation is required for hdgf mitogenic activity. our study of hdgf phosphorylation in vivo was suggested by the computer search engine netphosk  <dig>  <cit>  that matches amino acid sequence to known protein kinase phosphorylation motifs, with statistical ranking for significance. this type of search engine is useful for identifying potential phosphorylation sites within a protein of interest. separate studies had identified hdgf as a phosphorylated nuclear protein based on mass spectroscopy   <cit>  or by in vitro kinase assays  <cit> . these studies indicated s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  t <dig> and s <dig> were phosphorylated in hela or ht- <dig> cells  <cit> . our results identify s <dig> as a new, previously unknown significant hdgf phosphorylation site not previously identified by ms. because s <dig> is only phosphorylated during mitosis, based on immunostaining with a phospho-amino acid specific antibody, this likely explains why ps <dig> was not found by ms in non-synchronized cells. this is supported by the relatively low levels of ps103-hdgf we observed by immunoblotting whole cell extracts. it is also unclear from these global ms studies whether the peptide containing s <dig> was detected. we demonstrate that s <dig> and s <dig> are also phosphorylated in vivo, but at possibly lower levels in cos- <dig> cells relative to s <dig>  based on differences in radiolabeling of the mutated proteins. it is of interest that previously s <dig> had been predicted to be a cdk <dig> substrate based on sequence, however mutation of s <dig> had no effect on the nuclear targeting of hdgf or on its mitogenic activity  <cit> . although the kinase for s <dig> is not known, salvi et al  <cit>  have shown that hdgf can by phosphorylated in vitro by casein kinase  <dig>  it is not known whether s132/ <dig> are phosphorylated in vivo or whether s132/ <dig> phosphorylation is functionally significant.

we found that phosphorylation of hdgf-s <dig> has a significant effect on hdgf mitogenic activity. a substitution mutation in hdgf to s103a to prevent phosphorylation nullified hdgf mitogenic activity, whereas a s103d phospho-mimic mutation was constitutively active, resulting in an increased mitogenic activity relative to wild type hdgf. this data would suggest that one model of vsmc proliferation is that activation of mitotic kinases results in phosphorylation of s103-hdgf, leading to increased cell proliferation. as the impact of the s <dig> mutants on the cell cycle was much more profound than the wild type protein, this would suggest that hdgf mitogenic function is dependent on phosphorylation and not just dependent on the amount of hdgf present.

although the mechanism of phospho-s103-hdgf function during mitosis is unclear, it is of interest that another hdgf family member ledgf, demonstrates metaphase chromatin binding, requiring cooperative interaction of the pwwp and at-hook domains. although hdgf does not contain at-hook domains, it does bind dna directly requiring a large  <dig> bp recognition sequence and requires the pwwp domain for dna binding  <cit> . it is unclear how phosphorylation regulates this process either to induce a conformational change to increase binding or enhance binding with a chromatin binding protein. the hdgf pwwp domain was recently shown to dimerize on heparin and whether phosphorylation plays a role in potentially regulating hdgf dimerization on chromatin via the pwwp domain is an area of active research.

it is of great interest that a s282p mutation in the dna methyltransferase 3b  gene results in the icf syndrome   <cit> . this serine is  <dig> amino acids carboxy to the pwwp domain in dnmt3b, and homologous to the location of s <dig> in hdgf. the conservation of this serine in relation to the pwwp domain and its mutation associated with a human disease, strongly implicates these serines in the function of pwwp proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
hdgf is a mitotic phosphoprotein and phosphorylation of s <dig> plays an important role in regulating the proliferation of cells and the mitogenic function of hdgf.
