BACKGROUND
alzheimer's disease  is characterized by extracellular aβ deposition, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal loss, and cerebral microvascular pathology, resulting in progressive learning and memory deficits  <cit> . extensive evidence supports a dynamic role for inflammation in the ad pathogenesis. microglia, the macrophages that reside in the central nervous system, are activated around aβ deposits in the brains of ad patients  <cit> . levels of inflammatory mediators including tnf-α and c-reactive protein  are also increased in the peripheral blood of ad patients  <cit>  and associated with increased risk of ad  <cit> . activated microglia/macrophages derived from the brain and blood produce chemokines, cytokines, and free radicals, which participate in aβ plaque formation and the neurodegenerative process in ad  <cit> .

several epidemiological studies have demonstrated that the relative risk of ad is significantly reduced in rheumatoid arthritis  patients treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  for longer than  <dig> yrs  <cit> . in meta-analysis of  <dig> epidemiological studies, protective effects of arthritis and anti-inflammatory drugs have been observed against ad  <cit> . these studies have raised the hypothesis that anti-inflammatory drug treatment protects against ad, but arthritis or ra itself could modulate ad risk. cyclooxygenase- <dig> , an inducible cyclooxygenase known to mediate inflammation in ra and ad, has been proposed as a positive regulator for amyloid plaque formation and cognitive deficit in ad. in support of this hypothesis, administration of ibuprofen, a mixed cox-1/cox- <dig> inhibitor, reduces microglial activation, aβ production, plaque burden, and cognitive impairment in tg <dig> mice  <cit> . amyloid plaque formation is enhanced in app/ps <dig> mice overexpressing human cox- <dig>  <cit> . however, the beneficial effects of nsaids have not been verified in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials for ad patients  <cit> . in such clinical trials, nsaids were administered for less than  <dig> yr due to increased risk of acute myocardial infarction in patients receiving nsaids for longer than  <dig> months  <cit> . in a recent report from alzheimer's disease anti-inflammatory prevention trial  with nsaids, treatment of asymptomatic individuals with naproxen for  <dig> yr was shown to reduce incidence of ad after  <dig> to  <dig> yr  <cit> . therefore, the preventive and disease-modifying potential of nsaids remains to be determined in ad patients treated with nsaids for a long period of time .

in a recent study, amyloid plaque formation and cognitive impairment were reduced in ad mice that were subjected to subcutaneous administration of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor , an inflammatory cytokine shown to increase in ra, for  <dig> d  <cit> . combined with findings from epidemiological studies indicating that the incidence of ad is reduced in ra patients with prolonged nsaid treatment, ra is expected to directly modulate ad onset and progression. to examine this hypothesis, 2-month-old app/ps <dig> mice were injected with bovine type ii collagen  in complete freund's adjuvant , which has been widely used to induce ra in rodents  <cit> . aβ burden, microglia/macrophages, and cerebral vascular pathology were investigated in app/ps <dig> mice  <dig> months after the injections of cii in cfa to determine whether ra directly modulates amyloidosis and microvascular pathology in ad.

RESULTS
induction of collagen-induced arthritis  in app/ps <dig> mice
app/ps <dig> mice and wild-type littermates injected with cii in cfa revealed pathologic features of ra. paw swelling and redness of the joint were manifest immediately after the second immunization, reached a peak  <dig> month later, and significantly persisted over the next  <dig> months when animals were sacrificed . in contrast to cia induced paw swelling in all four paws in dba/ <dig> mice  <cit> , paw swelling was confined to the injection site in wild-type and app/ps <dig> mice. plasma levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines il-1β and tnf-α were increased within  <dig> d after the second immunization and remained elevated over the next  <dig> weeks in wild-type and app/ps <dig> mice . paraffin-embedded joint sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin revealed severe bone erosion, cartilage/chondrocyte degradation, and proliferative synovitis in wild-type  at  <dig> months after the second immunization. such joint pathology was similar in app/ps <dig> mice treated with cia .

effects of cia on amyloid plaque pathology in app/ps <dig> mice
we examined the effect of cia on aβ deposition in app/ps <dig> mice. app/ps <dig> mice received cii in cfa at  <dig> months of age before aβ deposition was evolved. when aβ deposition was analyzed  <dig> months after cia, levels of aβ deposition were moderate in app/ps <dig> mice  <cit> . aβ plaques were widespread in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of 6-month-old app/ps <dig> mice . contrary to expectations, cia substantially reduced aβ plaque accumulation in app/ps <dig> mice. image analysis of aβ deposition showed that aβ plaques that were positive for 4g <dig> or thioflavine-s were significantly reduced in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of 6-month-old app/ps <dig> mice treated with cia, compared with vehicle-treated app/ps <dig> mice . the effect of cia on aβ levels was analyzed in the opposite hemisphere using an elisa that detects sds-soluble and sds-insoluble aβ  <dig> and aβ  <dig>  levels of soluble aβ  <dig> and aβ  <dig> appeared reduced by 48%  and 20%  in app/ps <dig> mice  <dig> months after cia, respectively, compared with vehicle-treated app/ps <dig> mice. app/ps <dig> mice treated with cia revealed substantially significant reduction in levels of insoluble aβ  <dig> and aβ  <dig> .

enhanced activation of microglia/macrophage in app/ps <dig> mice  <dig> months after cia
cia-induced systemic inflammation likely triggers brain inflammation that contributes to internalization and degradation of aβ through activated microglia. iba- <dig> or mac-1-immunoreactive microglial cells were observed in the brains of wild-type mice and increased in the brains of app/ps <dig> mice at  <dig> months of age . immunoreactive mac- <dig> positive cells were transiently increased in the cortex and hippocampus of wild-type mice over the course of  <dig> d after the second immunization injection. however, by  <dig> weeks after cia mac- <dig> immunoreactivity had returned to levels that were comparable to the levels in vehicle-injected mice . in app/ps <dig> mice treated with cia, the number of iba- <dig> or 1-immunoreactive cells in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus increased  <dig> months later. cd45-positive activated microglia or macrophages were not observed in wild-type mice at  <dig> months after cia . activated microglia or macrophages were observed in the cortex of 6-month-old app/ps <dig> mice and increased in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of app/ps <dig> mice treated with cia up to approximately 210%  and 230%  . immunoreactivity to il-1β and tnf-α was increased in microglia and astrocytes in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus of app/ps <dig> mice compared to wild-type as previously reported  <cit> . cia further increased expression of il-1β and tnf-α in app/ps <dig> mice . in cia-treated app/ps <dig> mice, iba-1-positive or cd45-positive cells were observed adjacent to aβ plaques .

effects of cia on permeability of the blood-brain barrier  in app/ps <dig> mice
cia has been shown to increase bbb permeability in dba/ <dig> mice  <cit> . cia likely causes the infiltration of monocytes and activation of microglia/macrophages that contribute to clearance of aβ peptide in app/ps <dig> mice  <cit> . immunoreactivity to a macrophage mannose receptor  antibody was observed sparsely in the perivascular and leptomeningeal regions of wild-type and app/ps <dig> mice. cd206-positive macrophages were increased in the vicinity of vessels in wild-type and app/ps <dig> mice subjected to cia , suggesting the possibility that cia induces the migration of macrophages into the brain parenchyma through the disrupted bbb. in support of this hypothesis, levels of immunoglobulin g  were significantly increased in the brains of wild-type and app/ps <dig> mice  <dig>  and  <dig> months after cia compared with relevant vehicle .

cia induces cerebral microvascular pathology in app/ps <dig> mice
finally, we examined whether cia would cause cerebrovascular pathology. cerebral microvessels were immunolabeled with an anti-collagen type iv antibody, a marker of the endothelial basement membrane. cia significantly reduced vascular density and length in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of app/ps <dig> mice  <dig> months later . cia also induced cerebral microvascular pathology, such as vascular segments and atrophic string vessels . at  <dig> months after the injection procedure, survival of vehicle-treated app/ps <dig> mice was approximately  <dig> %, while the survival of cia-treated mice was reduced to  <dig> % .

discussion
administration of cii in cfa produces features of ra including joint swelling, bone and cartilage degeneration, synovitis, and infiltration of inflammatory cells at the injection sites accompanied by sustained elevation of il-1β and tnf-1β in plasma of wild-type and app/ps <dig> mice. cia reduces levels of aβ and plaque burden in the cortex and hippocampus of app/ps <dig> mice. the reduced amyloidosis is associated with bbb disruption and activation of microglia/macrophage. in contrast to the clearance of aβ plaques, cia enhances microcerebral pathology and mortality in app/ps <dig> mice.

inflammation can reduce amyloidosis and cognitive deficit in transgenic mouse models of ad. amyloid plaque formation is enhanced in app/ps <dig> mice overexpressing human cox- <dig>  the inducible isoform of cyclooxygenase that is essential for prostaglandin e <dig> -mediated inflammation  <cit> . chronic administration of ibuprofen, a mixed cox-1/cox- <dig> inhibitor, prevents microglial activation, and reduces levels of inflammatory cytokines, aβ, and amyloid plaque formation in tg <dig> mice  <cit> . the administration of cox- <dig> inhibitors prevents aβ-mediated suppression of long-term plasticity and improves synaptic plasticity in tg <dig>  <cit> . cox-2-mediated pge <dig> production can enhance amyloidosis by reducing the phagocytic function of microglia and stimulating aβ production through activation of the prostaglandin e <dig> and e <dig> receptors  <cit> .

several lines of evidence suggest that inflammation negatively regulates amyloidosis and cognitive deficit in transgenic mouse models of ad. overexpression of tgf-β <dig> or il- <dig> reduces amyloid plaque formation through microglial activation in tg <dig> and tgcrnd <dig> mice  <cit> . administration of g-csf or m-csf induces brain inflammation and ameliorates amyloid pathology and cognitive deficit in transgenic ad mice, including tg  <dig>  <cit> . the intracerebral infection of borna disease virus, which induces microglial cell activation, also reduces amyloid plaque formation in tg <dig> mice  <cit> . furthermore, overexpression of soluble complement receptor-related protein y, a complement inhibitor, reduces microglial activation, produces neurodegeneration, and enhances aβ production and accumulation in human amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice bearing the amyloidogenic k670m, n671l, and v717f mutations  <cit> .

aβ produced in the brains of app/ps <dig> mice or ad patients induces the expression and secretion of chemotactic cytokines, such as monocyte chemotactic protein  <dig>  which enhances the transmigration and differentiation of monocytes from the bloodstream  <cit> . circulating monocytes are increased in cia-treated mice or ra patients, and are expected to transmigrate through the bbb into the brain areas exposed to aβ. the brain monocytes can be differentiated into macrophages by cytokines such as m-csf and il- <dig>  which are induced by aβ or after cia  <cit> . macrophages and activated microglia contribute to aβ clearance. alternatively, cia may reduce the aβ plaque burden by increasing passive transport to the periphery through increased bbb disruption.

aβ accumulation in the cerebral vessel triggers bbb disruption by reducing the expression of tight junction proteins such as occludin, claudin- <dig>  and zona occludins- <dig> <cit> . aβ can induce oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the activation of caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways, possibly through mechanisms involving interaction with rage, resulting in endothelial cell degeneration  <cit> . in the present study, we provide evidence that cia-treated app/ps <dig> mice develop vascular segments and atrophic string vessels characteristic of cerebrovascular pathology observed in ad patients.

alzheimer's disease is occasionally accompanied by epileptic seizures  <cit> . cortical and hippocampal seizures are detected in three different app transgenic mice models of ad  <cit> . seizures are frequently observed in app/ps <dig> mice at  <dig> and  <dig>  months of age and correlated with mortality that peaks at  <dig> to  <dig> months of age  <cit> . in the present study, two app/ps <dig> mice died at  <dig> to  <dig> months of age . in thirty nine app/ps <dig> mice treated with cia, nine mice died at  <dig> to  <dig> months of age . thereafter, no death was observed. thus, cia may increase mortality of app/ps <dig> mice by enhancing seizures, which is likely related with sustained inflammation and enhanced cerebrovascular pathology.

while further study is needed to delineate mechanisms underlying the effects of cia on vascular pathology, elevated monocytes and neutrophils in cia-treated app/ps <dig> mice likely migrate to the cerebral vessel, release cytotoxic molecules such as superoxide, matrix metalloproteases, and tnf-α, and then contribute to endothelial cell degeneration and mortality in a cooperative way with aβ. recently, systemic administration of lipopolysaccharide for  <dig> weeks was shown to induce sustained microglial activation and tau hyperphosphorylation in the hippocampus of 3x tg-ad mice harboring three mutant human genes   <cit> . considering that lipopolysaccharide triggers systemic inflammation and bbb disruption, cia may exacerbate tau pathology as well as vascular pathology in ad.

CONCLUSIONS
cia induced before the onset of amyloid pathology reduces aβ burden over  <dig> months in app/ps <dig> mice, presumably by enhancing the clearance and efflux of aβ. however, such beneficial effects of cia are accompanied by enhanced microvascular pathology and mortality. the present findings suggest that transient systemic inflammation may be beneficial in lowering aβ burden; however, the chronic systemic inflammation demonstrated in ra is a serious risk factor for cerebral microvascular pathology and hypoperfusion in ad, which likely lead to neurodegeneration and cognitive deficit.
