BACKGROUND
micrornas , a class of small non-coding rna of ∼ <dig> nucleotides, are significant regulation molecules for diverse cellular processes such as cell development, proliferation and differentiation . pairs of mirnas can work cooperatively to regulate an individual gene or a cohort of genes that participate in similar processes  <cit> . this cooperativity  is a frequent regulation mechanism of mirnas for an enhanced target repression which has exhibited distinctive and fine-tuned target gene expression patterns  <cit> . investigation on mirna cooperativity can systematically understand mirna functions  <cit>  to detect their potential disease links  <cit> .

using mirnas as diagnostic and therapeutic targets, mirna therapeutics is a promising research area that designs sophisticated strategies to restore or inhibit mirna expression for the treatment of cancer and other diseases. for example, a therapy with the vector-encoded pair mir-15a and mir-16- <dig> has been proposed for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia   <cit> ; the microrna cluster mir-216a/ <dig> was reported to target genes pten and smad <dig> to induce the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which can promote the drug resistance and recurrence of liver cancer  <cit> . such co-functional mirna pairs are more suitable as drug targets instead of using individual ones. large scale detection of novel co-functional mirna pairs is an important pre-step to identify proper mirna pairs as more effective drug targets. currently, abundant disease-gene association information are stored in online mendelian inheritance in man   <cit>  and comparative toxicogenomics database  <cit> ; disease-mirna associations are recorded in mir2disease  <cit>  and hmdd  <cit> ; and mirna-target regulations are recorded in mirecord  <cit>  and mirtarbase  <cit> . linking and integrating these databases, it can be inferred which diseases are correlated with the same genes or with the same mirnas, and which mirnas have the same target disease genes. our hypothesis is that some of the mirnas can regulate their common targets cooperatively and have roles in the development of a series of diseases.

the focus of this work is on the detection and prioritization of multi-disease associated co-functional mirna pairs. a multi-disease associated co-functional mirna pair is a pair of mirnas whose common target genes are associated with a series of diseases. here, the definition of co-function for the mirna pairs is broader than the definition of cooperativity as proposed in  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows an example of multi-disease associated co-functional mirna pairs detected from a disease-gene-mirna  tripartite network. from this example, we can see that multi-disease associated co-functional mirna pairs may hold a vast mechanism underlying multiple disease development, similarly like the basic cellular functions maintained by housekeeping genes. more importantly, these mirnas can be considered as the common drug targets of these diseases for the design and development of multi-purpose drugs.
fig.  <dig> an example: from a dgr tripartite network to a co-functional mirna pair. the network in panel a contains known associations between the genes g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  and g <dig>  the diseases d <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig>  and d <dig>  and the mirnas r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig>  and r <dig>  in this example, mirnas r <dig> and r <dig> are both associated with all the four diseases. however, the other three mirnas are each associated with only one of these diseases. all these four diseases are associated with two common genes g <dig> and g <dig>  meanwhile, both of g <dig> and g <dig> are the targets of mirnas r <dig> and r <dig>  it is believed that r2-r3-g4-g <dig> in panel b may form a functional module that associated with the development of all the four diseases




mirna co-function mechanisms have attracted intensive research recently  <cit> , with the focus on the analysis of mirna-target networks or on the analysis of disease-mirna associations for a specific disease. our work advances the current research with two steps:  we reconstruct a dgr tripartite network through the integration of existing databases with our newly predicted disease-mirna associations, and  we propose a novel scoring method to prioritize the potential multi-disease associated co-functional mirna pairs. since the relationships between the exact mirnas and diseases are largely unknown, computational methods are required to make prediction of disease-related mirnas for constructing the disease-mirna network in the dgr tripartite. for example, network-based or semi-supervised prediction methods , or the methods via support vector machines  <cit>  can be used among some other prediction methods . the key idea in the similarity assessment adopted by most of these methods is that: similar rnas  are always associated with similar diseases . during the training of the existing prediction methods, the disease-mirna pairs without known relationships are thought to be ranked at bad positions or are regarded as negative samples directly. as some  of the unknown disease-mirna pairs in the training data are true in fact, the false positive rates by the literature methods are high in the prediction of disease related mirnas. on the other hand, the use of negative samples by the literature methods is straightforward without consideration of gene expression properties of mirnas.

to improve the prediction performance, we propose a new method to make predictions of disease-related mirnas. two new ideas are explored. one is the construction of a set of reliable negative samples of disease-mirna association through mirna expression comparison between control and diseased subjects. the second idea is the use of precomputed kernel matrix for support vector machines, which can avoid the step to tune the parameters of the kernel functions. the area under the roc curve performance of our method is much superior to the literature methods on bench-marking data sets. our case studies have demonstrated that our prediction method can also work well even when a disease has no currently known disease-related mirnas. combining our predicted disease-mirna associations with those literature-maintained associations between diseases, mirnas and genes, we construct a more complete dgr tripartite network to detect and prioritize multi-disease associated co-functional mirna pairs. given a mirna pair, our scoring method cfscore considers the function relationship between the two mirnas, the co-dysexpression of the two mirnas in the disease tissues and the relationship between the common target genes and the associated diseases of these mirnas. we are also interested in finding the exact targets dysregulated by the co-functional mirna pair during the diseases’ development. we call them the co-functional targets of the co-functional mirna pair. the flowchart of our work is described in fig.  <dig> 
fig.  <dig> the flowchart of our prediction and scoring method. our work includes the parts such as material collection, similarity computing, association prediction, network reconstruction, scoring and prioritization of the co-function mirna pairs and result output




this method was tested on the cancer and non-cancer disease related dgr tripartite networks. the top  <dig> multi-disease associated co-functional mirna pairs were concentrated for deep analysis. we found that most of them were from the same mirna families or mirna clusters. the comparison of the co-functional pairs from the two dgr networks suggests that the dysregulation mechanisms of mirnas in the cancers are more complex. it has also been shown that the analysis of multi-disease associated co-functional mirnas can help understand the regulation mechanisms of mirnas in the development of different diseases and thus can provide new knowledge for the diagnosis or treatment of the diseases.

RESULTS
multi-disease associated co-functional mirna pairs and their common dysfunctional target genes
two cancer-gene-mirna tripartite networks were constructed to investigate the performance of our method for detecting and ranking multi-cancer associated co-functional mirna pairs. as a pre-processing step, we merged the mircancer database  <cit>  with mir2disease  <cit>  and hmdd  <cit> , and collected  <dig> cancer-mirna associations between  <dig> cancers and  <dig> mirnas. connecting these mirnas and diseases to their associated genes, the first cancer-gene-mirna tripartite network was constructed. then, all the  <dig> cancer-mirna associations  and a balanced set of  <dig> negative samples of cancer-mirna association in this tripartite network were used together to train our prediction model for inferring new cancer-mirna associations. the prediction model was applied to all the un-connected disease-mirna pairs between the  <dig> cancers and  <dig> mirnas to predict whether some of them have associations or not. when a pair was predicted to have an association between a cancer and a mirna, a probability was also estimated. a total of  <dig> top-ranked associations were added to the first cancer-gene-mirna tripartite network to form the second cancer-gene-mirna tripartite network . those associations can be found in the additional file  <dig> 

on average, the  <dig> mirnas are associated with  <dig> or  <dig> cancers for the first and the reconstructed network respectively; and there are  <dig> and  <dig> mirna pairs in these two networks that have a cfscore larger than  <dig> and that are associated with at least  <dig> cancers. there are very few literature proving the mirna pairs can co-function in the development of more than  <dig> different diseases. to understand whether these mirna pairs co-function in the development of some of the diseases, we manually searched and examined relevant literature to confirm that the individual mirnas in the pairs can function cooperatively to regulate the same targets. of the top-ranked  <dig> mirna pairs from our reconstructed network,  <dig> pairs can be validated to be co-functional pairs by the literature, in comparison with  <dig> of the top  <dig> pairs from the first tripartite network. this implies that the addition of the predicted disease-mirna associations into the tripartite network is useful and effective for the study of co-functional mirna pairs. here, we can just confirm these pairs of mirnas are co-functional mirna pairs but not multi-disease associated co-functional ones. we could not find any literature that discusses the relationship between mirnas and a series of diseases.

details of the  <dig> mirna pairs are shown in fig.  <dig>  where on the label of every edge, the first number represents the ranking position of the mirna pair. if the rank number is followed by one or more gene names, it represents that the mirna pair is a co-functional pair and has validated common targets. the number at the end of the label is the number of diseases that may associate with this co-functional pair. these multi-cancer associated co-functional mirna pairs are mostly from the same clusters or families such as from the let- <dig> family  and the mir- <dig> ∼ <dig> cluster . it has been known that clustered mirnas or those mirnas from the same family are evolved from a common ancestor and can target functionally related genes  <cit> . thus, it can be easily understood that mirnas from the same cluster or family have similar functions and can always function cooperatively. however, not all those mirnas in the same families or clusters can co-function with each other as their target genes are not completely overlapped. moreover, some mirnas that belong to different families or clusters can be co-functional mirnas. for example, the 17th-ranked pair mir-497-5p-mir-424-5p is a co-functional mirna pair. however, as recorded by mirbase, mir-424-5p is a member of mir- <dig> gene family while mir-497-5p stems from the mir- <dig> family. the pair is also not clustered.
fig.  <dig> the  <dig> top-ranked co-functional mirna pairs from the reconstructed cancer-mirna-gene network. the labels along the edges illustrate the co-function information of the mirnas. the first number of each label is the rank of the corresponding pair according to our prioritization method. the following gene symbols are the validated common targets during the co-functioning of the pair of mirnas. the last number shows the potential diseases that related to this co-function pair




the 5th-ranked pair, mir-15b and mir- <dig>  both belong to the mir- <dig> family, and both of them can target gene bcl <dig>  an important apoptosis inhibitor. this pair of mirnas can also work together with another mirna  in regulation  <cit> . we hypothesize that this co-functional pair may dysregulate their targets cooperatively, leading to the development of  <dig> different cancers such as prostate cancer , prostate carcinoma , stomach cancer , and breast cancer . the top three potential common targets of this mirna pair are genes bcl <dig> , cdkn1a , and ccnd <dig>  we have verified that these three genes are individually related to most of  the  <dig> cancers. furthermore, these three genes are all involved in four kegg  <cit>  pathways: hsa05215: prostate cancer , hsa05206: micrornas in cancer , hsa04151: pi3k-akt signaling pathway  and hsa05200: pathways in cancer  as revealed by the david functional annotation tool  <cit> . moreover, the three genes all have the functions of the cellular response to dna damage stimulus  and response to drug , which are important functions for the normal cells. based on these analysis and evidences, it is suggested that the pair of mir-15b and mir- <dig> may contribute to the development of all the  <dig> different types of cancers via a similar regulation mechanism. more details of the discovered mirna pairs and references are listed in additional file  <dig> 

we were also interested in the problem of whether the co-functional phenomenon for the non-cancer disease related mirnas is the same as those of cancers. thus, we constructed a non-cancer disease related dgr tripartite network containing  <dig> non-cancer disease-mirna associations between  <dig> mirnas and  <dig> diseases extracted from the three existing databases and also containing  <dig> predicted associations . there were just  <dig> multi-non-cancer-disease associated co-functional mirna pairs having a cfscore bigger than  <dig> and associating with no less than  <dig> different diseases. again, we manually examined these candidate co-functional mirna pairs. we found that  <dig> of them can be validated with strong evidence from literature . furthermore,  <dig> of the  <dig> pairs overlap with the cancer related top  <dig> mirna pairs. this indicates that the co-functional mechanism exists not only for the cancer related mirnas but also for non-cancer disease related mirnas.

an in-depth analysis of the  <dig> overlapping co-functional mirna pairs
to further understand the regulation mechanism of the co-functional mirna pairs, we particularly focused on the common targets of the  <dig> overlapping co-functional pairs . the first two columns list the two individual mirnas in the co-functional mirna pairs, the third column shows the ranks of those co-functional mirna pairs. in the forth column, the number of diseases that may relate to the mirna pairs are displayed, and the last column lists the co-functional targets of these mirna pairs which are related to multiple diseases. here, a target gene is ranked higher if it relates to more diseases. it can be seen that even though there are common co-functional mirna pairs between cancers and non-cancer diseases, the co-functional targets of these mirna pairs are different from each other. for example, for the two mirna pairs that both are members of the mir- <dig> family , the top three possible co-functional targets for the non-cancer diseases are ifng, mthfr, rarb, while for cancers are bcl <dig>  cdkn1a and ccnd <dig>  meanwhile, there are a lot of genes repeatedly relate to various mirna pairs such as the last three mirna pairs from table  <dig>  thus these mirna pairs may function cooperatively and can form a co-functional module. this co-functional module is related to both of multi-cancers and multi-non-cancer diseases.



to reveal the detailed regulation mode of these mirnas associating with multiple cancers and non-cancer diseases, we conducted a deep case analysis. in fig.  <dig>  the top ten common target genes of each co-functional pair were combined to be a gene set. the david functional annotation tool  <cit>  was applied to analyze these gene sets of the co-functional pairs in the module mir-29a-mir-29b-mir-29c, where the threshold of the pathway enrichment analysis  <cit>  was set as p-value ≤ <dig>  . the labels on the edges from the diseases to the genes are the probabilities of genes to be the co-functional targets of the mirna co-function module. for example, the edge from the diseases to the gene vegfa has the label of “c 77% n 23%”. this label means that the co-function module may dysregulate the gene vegfa to contribute to the development of the  <dig> cancers  with the probability of 77%. this gene may also be the common target of the co-functional module during the dysregulation in the development of those  <dig> non-cancer disease  with the probability of 23%. the labels along with the edges connecting the genes and the pathways indicate that the genes from the target gene sets of the diseases  or non-cancer diseases ) associated co-function module can be mapped to the corresponding pathways. for instance, there are three edges connecting the genes with the pathway ‘hsa05219: bladder cancer’ together with the labels of “c n vegfa”, “c n mmp2” and “c mdm2”. the labels mean the genes vegfa, mmp <dig> and mdm <dig> from the target gene set of the cancers  associated co-function module can be mapped to the bladder cancer pathway. for the non-cancer diseases , only two genes  can be mapped to this pathway. those genes that cannot map to any pathways or those diseases that are not associated with all of the three co-functional pairs are ignored in the figure. the cancer related gene sets can be mapped to many different pathways, we just show the top ten pathways according to their p-values.

it is uncovered that the co-functional module mainly dysregulates the ‘hsa05219: bladder cancer’ and the ‘hsa05200: pathways in cancer’ to contribute to the development of the  <dig> non-cancer diseases. the module also regulates eight other pathways  to involve in the development of the  <dig> cancers. the cancer developments are more complex with more common genes involved. this observation is consistent with the hypothesis that similar diseases may be related to similar mirnas and genes. the top three non-cancer disease genes regulated by the co-functional module and mapped to the pathways are mmp <dig>  vegfa and casp <dig>  while for the cancers are bcl <dig>  mdm <dig> and vegfa. with the gene ontology enrichment analysis, we found that the former three genes have the function of angiogenesis , macrophage differentiation , negative regulation of cysteine-type endopeptidase activity involved in apoptotic process  and response to hypoxia. the latter three genes can play roles of cellular response to hypoxia , response to iron ion , ovarian follicle development  and the other related functions. the co-functional module can regulate two same pathways during the development of both the cancers and non-cancer diseases. the possible common targets also have the similar function such as response to hypoxia. these indicate that the mir-29a/b/c regulation module may contribute to the disease development partly via similar dysregulation mechanism. on the other side, the co-functional module may prefer to function by dysregulating the same genes in the development of various cancers rather than those non-cancer diseases. during the carcinogenesis of  <dig> kinds of cancers, averagely more than 70% of those cancers relate to the dysfunction of the above three genes . for the three non-cancer diseases related genes , the percentage is just around 30%. those cancers related genes are more likely to involve in the same pathways which indicates the close relationships between their functions. this is mainly due to the fact that cancers are more similar to each other than those non-cancer diseases.

interestingly, there are a number of literature which have reported the co-function of the mir- <dig> family members in the development of the cancers such as non-small-cell lung cancer  <cit> , renal cell carcinoma  <cit> , breast cancer  <cit> , ovarian cancer  <cit>  and others types of cancers  <cit> . furthermore, the myc-mediated mir- <dig> repression mechanism for the therapy of aggressive b-cell malignancies   <cit> ) by applying the hdac <dig> and ezh <dig> as therapeutic targets  <cit>  was reported. another report in  <dig> also discussed the adoption of mir-29s  as candidate epi-therapeutics for curing hematologic malignancies  <cit> . according to our findings and literature, we can claim that it is reasonable to consider mir-29a/b/c as potential drug targets for the treatment of multiple cancers.

the predicted mirnas that are related to breast and prostate cancer: case studies
in this section, we report details of the predicted mirnas which are likely related to breast cancer and prostate cancer. breast cancer is the leading type of cancer in women, accounting for 25% of all women cancer patients  <cit> . prostate cancer is the second most common type of cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death in men  <cit> . we have taken the following three steps for this case study:  the prediction model was trained on the rlsmda data set of disease-mirna associations  <cit>  which contains  <dig> disease-mirna associations;  the prediction model was applied to make predictions for those disease-mirna pairs whose relationships were unknown in this data set;  the positively predicted disease-mirna pairs were evaluated using the latest version of databases such as mircancer  <cit> , mir2disease  <cit>  and hmdd  <cit> , which stores newer disease-mirna associations than the rlsmda data set does. in fact, the rlsmda data set stores only  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas associated with breast cancer and prostate cancer respectively. however, the latest version of the three databases stores  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas which have been found related to breast and prostate cancer. thus, our predicted results can be fairly verified by the literature ground truth. as some of the predicted disease-mirna associations were not covered by the three databases, we also searched other web sources to confirm the prediction results.

we constructed  <dig> prediction models , each time using all the  <dig> disease-mirna pairs as the positive samples and a set of randomly selected  <dig> negative samples from the negative_expression data set . if a unknown cancer-mirna relationship is positively predicted by all the  <dig> models, then a strong association exists between the cancer and the mirna. the association probabilities derived by the  <dig> models is averaged to indicate the strong association. figure  <dig> shows the  <dig> top-ranked positively predicted mirnas related to breast and prostate cancer in terms of the average probabilities of the  <dig> models for the mirnas. the edges at the  part represent the breast cancer-mirna associations while the edges at the  part show the prostate cancer-mirna associations. the labels on these edges represent the ranking positions and evidence type of the prediction results. the characters “*”, “#” or “$” stand for that the corresponding associations can be confirmed by the records in the mir2disease database, the hmdd database or the mircancer database respectively. the character “@” means that the association can be confirmed by other articles. otherwise, the predicted associations could not be confirmed to our best knowledge. overall,  <dig> of the  <dig> predicted disease-mirna relationships can be verified by the newer databases or by other literature work.

a novel association predicted by our method is about hsa-mir-15b  and breast cancer. hsa-mir-15b is ranked as the 5th leading breast cancer related mirna. this mirna is an epidermal growth factor induced mirna, and its association with breast cancer has not been recorded by any existing databases. however, a new discovery in  <dig> can verify that there is an inverse correlation between the high expression of mirna-15b and the low expression of its target gene mtss <dig> in the tissues of breast cancer patients with the aggressive basal subtype  <cit> . the growth factor-inducible mirnas can mediate the mechanisms underlying the progression of breast cancer. another novel association predicted by our method is about hsa-mir-29c  and prostate cancer. this association is also ranked at the 5th position among the predicted prostate cancer related mirnas, but it has not been recorded by any existing databases. a recent report claimed that mir-29c together with other five mirnas such as mir-29a, mir-29b, mir-26a, mir-26b and mir- <dig> can control the expression of metastasis-promoting loxl <dig> gene during the development of prostate cancer  <cit> .

for the association mir-20b-prostate cancer which cannot be verified, moltzahn et al.  <cit>  had reported an upregulation of mir-20b in prostate cancer patients comparing with the healthy samples. however, this upregulation was not statistically significant at the follow-up pcr experiments. with our prediction, there may be an association between mir-20b and prostate cancer.

for some diseases, there have no currently known associations with any mirnas. to test whether our prediction algorithm is still applicable for such situations, we conducted another experiment. in the experiment, we removed all the known mirna associations with breast cancer or prostate cancer from the rlsmda data set. the objective was to see whether our model can correctly predict these purposely removed and currently known breast cancer-mirna or prostate cancer-mirna associations. the prediction results are shown in figure 6
b. our model has a superior performance for predicting disease-mirna associations even when there is no known association for these two cancers. of the top  <dig> predicted disease-mirna associations, all the predicted breast cancer-mirna associations can be confirmed by the existing databases or literature, while 96% of the top  <dig> predicted prostate cancer-mirna associations can be confirmed. the confirmation rates for the top- <dig> predicted associations can still maintain at a very high level. moreover, the breast cancer-hsa-mir-15b-5p and the prostate cancer-hsa-mir-29c-3p can still be predicted and ranked highly. more details of the predicted and verified disease-mirna pairs can be found in additional file 2: table s3–s <dig>  the code in the additional file  <dig> which implements our prediction algorithm has a default setting to output no more than  <dig> mirnas for a given disease.

performance comparison: prediction of disease-mirna relationships by different methods
a number of methods have been proposed to make predictions of unknown disease-mirna relationships. we compared the performance of our prediction method with three state-of-the-art methods: rlsmda  <cit> , the method proposed by xu et al.  <cit> , and jiang’s method  <cit> . rlsmda is a semi-supervised method that does not need any negative samples. xu’s method is a supervised approach and it collects the negative samples according to tissue-specific and expression properties of the mirnas. jiang’s method is also a supervised method. it has utilized a set of  <dig> negative samples randomly selected from the un-connected disease-mirna pairs of a mirna-disease bipartite network.

we first optimized our prediction model with two experiments such as selecting optimal precomputed kernel matrix and determining the best size of the negative samples comparing to positive ones during the training of our model. the results illustrate that our model can achieve best performance with the following settings: applying the squared root type of precomputed kernel matrix, setting the weight parameter α= <dig>  and selecting the same size of negative samples as positive samples. in addition, we did the permutation test  <cit>  which has proved that the performance of our prediction model was not produced occasionally but contains biological significance. the performances of our model with negative samples selected from our collected negative sample set or from all the un-connected pairs were compared. selection of negative samples from our negative sample set has been proved to be a better choice. more detail of these procedures and the results can be found in the contents and additional file 2: figure s1–s <dig> 

the source codes of these above three literature methods were not available. we implemented the rlsmda algorithm, but not the complicated xu’s or jiang’s method. it is not possible for us to compare various methods with a independent test set. for a fair comparison, their data sets and performance metrics , precision, accuracy and auc) were exactly used by our method. more details of the implementation and data sets are described in additional file  <dig>  the positive samples are listed in additional file  <dig> 

the specificity, recall, accuracy and auc performances are benchmarked in table  <dig> . the roc curve of our method is depicted in fig.  <dig> in comparison with the curve of the rlsmda method under the same data set and the same leave-one-out cross-validation . the roc curves for the comparison of our methods with all the three methods are also showed in additional file 2: figure s4–s <dig>  our prediction model achieves much better auc values than the three state-of-the-art methods. this is the main reason why our prediction method was used to predict unknown mirna-disease associations and the top-ranked ones were added to reconstruct the disease-gene-mirna tripartite networks. the superior performance of our prediction method is mainly attributed to the careful selection of reliable negative samples as well as the precomputed kernel matrix which can identify more positive samples.

discussion
a more challenging problem is to detect and prioritize multi-disease associated co-functional mirna groups containing more than two members. an intuitive approach is to integrate all the co-functional pairs that overlap. as the co-function of more than two mirnas is rarely reported by the literature, it is hard to validate the existence of multi-mirna co-functional groups. the prioritization of multi-mirna co-functional groups is one of our future research topics.

as demonstrated, our method has a much better performance for the prediction of disease-gene associations. a key idea of our method is the use of reliable negative samples screened and obtained through the fold change information of mirna expressions. an alternative approach to the screening can be through pairwise test statistics. combining expression fold change and pairwise test statistics may lead to decreasing the false positives in the set of negative samples. in the future work, we will examine the trade-off between the performance improvement and the quadratic pairwise time complexity.

multi-disease associated co-functional mirna pairs are also linked to the concept of competing endogenous rnas   <cit>  which covers the regulation relationships of mirnas and their targets including both mrnas and long non-coding rnas. characteristics of mirnas in the cerna networks can be considered to analyze the co-functions of mirnas. for instance, if two mirnas are involved in the same cerna network, they may always co-function with each other.

CONCLUSIONS
we have conducted a cross disease analysis of co-functional mirna pairs on a reconstructed disease-gene-mirna tripartite network. we made the following contributions:  we proposed a new idea for selecting reliable negative samples of disease-mirna relationship which can overcome the problem of lacking negative samples for machine learning methods to make reliable predictions of disease-associated mirnas;  our prediction model does not need to do feature selection, and it is applicable for large scale prediction of disease-associated mirnas;  our prediction model can work well for those mirnas that have no currently known mirna-disease associations;  we designed a scoring function to prioritize the candidate multi-disease associated co-functional mirna pairs and their potential co-regulated genes;  we performed detailed case studies to understand the mirna co-functional phenomenon for both cancers and non-cancer diseases; and  we performed deep case studies to reveal novel associations between mirnas and breast cancer and those between mirnas and prostate cancer. it can be concluded that our prediction method has a superior performance for the prediction of unknown mirna-disease associations, and that the integration of the top-ranked ones into the existing database is useful and effective for the cross disease analysis of co-functional mirna pairs.
