BACKGROUND
polyphenol oxidases  are implicated in a range of biological functions in diverse systems. in addition to a role in black/brown pigment biosynthesis, ppos may also have protective roles in plants against pathogens and environmental stress. while ppo-induced browning is a major problem in the food industry, causing massive losses through unacceptable discolouration in fruit and vegetables  <cit> , it is also implicated in plant defence against bacterial and fungal diseases of diverse plant species  <cit> . down-regulating constitutive and induced expression of ppos in tomato by antisense methods resulted in increased pathogen susceptibility  <cit> . in the forage legume trifolium pratense l. , ppo activity also provides some protection against natural infestations of sciarid fly, thrips and aphids under semi-controlled conditions  <cit> .

ppo activity in red clover is an agriculturally and environmentally important trait. red clover provides a significant and sustainable component of grazed pastures in low-input organic and conventional farms and is harvested for conservation as hay or silage in europe and north america  <cit> . major nutritional benefits of ppo activity have been recognised in this crop; high levels of ppo activity confer protection against protein degradation by micro-organisms in the animal rumen  <cit>  and by plant enzymes during ensilage  <cit> . lower protein degradation in the rumen and during ensiling results in increased nitrogen absorption by ruminants and simultaneously decreases nitrogen loss to the environment through the animal's urine.

ppo enzymes are ubiquitous and found in a broad range of dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous species. in legumes only a latent form of ppo enzyme was reported in leaves of the grain legume, vicia faba  <cit> , but active ppo enzymes are constitutively expressed in both aerial and root tissues in t. pratense. thus, t. pratense offers an ideal opportunity to study a ppo gene family and aspects of ppo function. complete coding sequences, but not promoter regions, of ppo genes ppo <dig>  ppo <dig> and ppo <dig>  have previously been reported  <cit> . expression patterns of the three known ppo genes vary in red clover: ppo <dig> is most abundant in young leaves, ppo <dig> in flowers and petioles, and ppo <dig> in leaves and also possibly in flowers  <cit> . in tomato , expression profiles of a six-member ppo gene family  revealed differential ppo expression  <cit> . ppo b is highly expressed in young tomato leaves, whereas transcripts of ppo b, e and f dominate in the inflorescence. specific ppo transcripts are also associated with different trichome types.

the tomato ppo gene family has six paralogous genes, which all appear to be clustered on a  <dig> kb region on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . the genomic relationship between members of the t. pratense ppo gene family is unknown, but similarities in gene structure and function, combined with differences in individual ppo gene expression profiles in red clover  <cit> , suggest that these red clover ppo genes are also paralogues. such gene duplication, followed by divergence from the parent sequence by mutation and selection or drift, is believed to provide a platform for evolutionary change within genomes  <cit> .

the haploid genome size of t. pratense has previously been estimated as  <dig> mb when measured by microdensitometry of feulgen-stained nuclei  <cit>  and, more recently, as  <dig> mb when measured by flow cytometry  <cit> . two red clover libraries already exist  <cit>  but they have relatively small insert sizes. here, we describe the creation of a new t. pratense bac library with a larger insert size and its use in isolating additional ppo genes and their regulatory regions and in determining the relationship between ppo gene family members within the t. pratense genome.

RESULTS
bac library construction and validation
the t. pratense bac library was constructed from partially digested gdna in a single, high molecular weight, size selection experiment. a total of  <dig>  bacs were picked into  <dig> 96-well plates, with an estimated average insert size of  <dig> kb per bac clone, based on  <dig> randomly selected bac clones .

pcr-based screen of bac library and ppo sequence analysis
the primer pairs specific to ppo <dig>  ppo <dig> and ppo <dig> identified 5– <dig> bacs each, indicating one copy of each gene. by contrast, the ppo <dig> primer pair identified at least  <dig> bac clones . all ppo genes were sequenced directly from selected bac clones. an iterative process of sequencing and primer design revealed a subfamily of ppo <dig> 

a20/ <dig> pcr products from gdna superpools of bac library were sequenced and confirmed as ppo1/ <dig> 

three variants ppo1/ <dig>  ppo1/ <dig> and ppo1/ <dig> could be clearly distinguished based on their coding regions  and were further distinguished by differences in their flanking sequences. primer pairs specific to variants ppo1/ <dig> and ppo1/ <dig> initially identified four and nine bac clones, respectively . in contrast, at least  <dig> bac clones with ppo1/ <dig> were identified from the pcr-based screen of the bac library .

sequencing confirmed the presence of ppo1/ <dig> on two bac clones and ppo1/ <dig> on four bac clones. five of the  <dig> bac clones harbouring ppo1/ <dig> were analysed further. three of the five bacs also harboured other ppo genes, while the remaining two contained ppo1/ <dig> alone; bac-end sequencing showed homology regions with fully sequenced bac  <dig> g <dig>  indicating that the solitary ppo1/ <dig> gene resided within this larger bac clone.

further sequence analysis of ppo1/ <dig> revealed that one of the four bac clones contained a  <dig> bp deletion in  <dig>  kb of 3' non-coding flanking region; otherwise there was > <dig> % identity in both ppo coding and flanking sequences, differing only in six separate, single bases. ppo1/ <dig> has the highest homology  with the previously reported ppo <dig>  <cit> .

sequence analysis of ppo <dig> and ppo5
full length coding dna sequences of ppo <dig>  and ppo <dig>  were deduced from bac sequences; neither gene contained introns. ppo <dig> and ppo <dig> sequences encode predicted proteins comprising  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids with molecular weights of  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda, respectively. identity between ppo <dig>  ppo <dig>  ppo <dig>  ppo <dig> and ppo <dig> genes at the cdna and amino acid sequence levels are 84–94% and 70–88%, respectively, with ppo <dig> and ppo <dig> showing highest homology . flanking dna sequences show little homology, indicating that the ppo genes are in different positions on the genome and therefore verify their separate identities .

ppo gene clusters
some bac clones contained more than one ppo gene and this information was used to create a map of a predicted ppo cluster . for example, out of five separate bac clones containing ppo <dig>  one contained ppo1/ <dig> alone , a second contained ppo <dig>  ppo1/ <dig> and ppo1/ <dig> , a third contained ppo1/ <dig>  ppo1/ <dig> and ppo <dig> , a fourth contained ppo1/ <dig>  ppo1/ <dig> and ppo <dig> , and a fifth contained ppo1/ <dig> and ppo <dig> . analysis of four of these bac clones containing  <dig> identified ppo genes provided evidence of a potential cluster of six distinct ppo genes within 190– <dig> kb . the full sequence of bac  <dig> g <dig> confirmed the presence of three ppo genes  and no other plant genes; however, retrotransposons were detected. the minimum ppo cluster length is based on  <dig>  bp of sequence from bac clone  <dig> g <dig> plus sequence from ppo <dig>  ppo1/ <dig> and ppo <dig> genes and their flanking regions and a calculation of sequence overlap between bac clones  <dig> f <dig> and  <dig> d <dig> with  <dig> g <dig> 

alignment of sequenced bac  <dig> g <dig> and bac  <dig> a <dig>  containing the single copy of ppo1/ <dig>  revealed about  <dig>  kb identical flanking sequences; in addition, m <dig>  derived bac-end sequence of bac  <dig> a <dig> was contained within bac  <dig> g <dig>  indicating that this ppo gene also lies within the proposed gene cluster.

ppo <dig> has not been identified in this red clover bac library. however, both ppo <dig> and ppo <dig> have been detected by sequencing pcr products of individual plants from cultivars sabtoron, britta and milvus, including the genotype used to generate the bac library, using diagnostic primers. coding regions of ppo <dig> and ppo <dig> differ , but show 98% homology over  <dig> bp of 3' flanking region.

a search of the genbank database revealed that rice has two ppo genes in tandem on a  <dig>  bp sequence  , with at least one of these rice ppo genes being expressed . in medicago truncatula  there are two ppos, which differ by 11%, on an  <dig> kb genomic sequence, but no equivalent ests have yet been deposited in the databases.

relationship of dna sequences of ppo
a phylogenetic analysis of dna coding sequences confirmed sequence similarities within species, and showed differences between ppo sequences from solanaceous and leguminous species . bootstrapping exercises were applied to the datasets to measure how consistently the data support given taxon bipartitions. all the tree branches support values generated in this study have high support values  and therefore provide uniform support.

sequences from different ppo genes of the solanaceous species, solanum tuberosum and lycopersicon esculentum , showed a high level of similarity between, as well as within, species . within the legumes, ppo sequence from medicago sativa was more similar to the two m. truncatula and vicia faba sequences than to the seven t. pratense sequences. in t. pratense ppo1/ <dig>  ppo1/ <dig> and ppo1/ <dig> exhibited the highest similarity, followed by ppo <dig> and ppo <dig> .

discussion
characteristics of bac library
the genome size of t. pratense was previously estimated as  <dig> mb  <cit>  and  <dig> mb  <cit> . the average bac insert size was estimated as  <dig> kb therefore, the predicted genome coverage of the library was 6– <dig> ×. this library complements two existing red clover libraries with smaller average insert sizes at  <dig> and  <dig> kb  <cit> . a library with a larger insert size offers an advantage in reducing the number of clones required for adequate coverage of the genome. this will also simplify screening the generation of bac contigs as demonstrated in this study and physical mapping.

ppo copy number
numbers of bac clones in the library containing ppo <dig>  ppo <dig>  ppo <dig> and ppo <dig> varied from four to ≥  <dig> . between five and six copies of ppo <dig>  ppo <dig> and ppo <dig> were detected in the library, suggesting that these genes are present as single copies in the red clover genome. both ppo <dig> and ppo <dig> were detected in genotypes of three red clover cultivars, suggesting separate genes. the high homology of their 3' flanking sequences may indicate a duplication event. however, ppo <dig> was not identified in the bac library. this may have resulted from an uneven distribution of restriction enzyme recognition sites throughout the genome  <cit> . regions with low numbers of restriction sites may be under-represented, while regions with higher number of restriction sites may create fragments smaller than the cut off fragment size, which in our case was < <dig> kb.

by contrast, a minimum of  <dig> potential bac clones containing ppo <dig> were identified in the library, indicating multiple copies. sequencing indicated three ppo <dig> variants: ppo1/ <dig>  ppo1/ <dig> and ppo1/ <dig>  . ppo1/ <dig> was detected in four bac clones indicating a single copy in the genome, whilst ppo1/ <dig> was detected in at least  <dig> bac clones suggesting either multiple copies or an over-representation of this gene in the bac library. the latter is most likely since bac ends of both bac clones that contain ppo 1/ <dig> alone map onto bac  <dig> g <dig>  indicating that the solitary ppo1/ <dig> gene actually resides within the ppo cluster. ppo1/ <dig> was detected in a total of nine bac clones, representing one or possibly two predicted copies. four ppo1/ <dig> genes were sequenced; while three were identical, the fourth had near identical homology in both gene and flanking sequences and a  <dig> bp out of  <dig>  kb deletion in the 3' flanking region, suggesting allelic variation.

ppo family of genes and genome structure
the results presented in this manuscript indicate that there are five distinct paralogous genes in the red clover multigene ppo family: ppo1–ppo <dig>  the bac library has yielded full length gene sequences and upstream regulatory regions for two new ppo genes, ppo <dig> and ppo <dig>  and for two variants of ppo <dig>  ppo1/ <dig> and ppo1/ <dig>  there were no introns identified in the newly identified red clover ppo genes and variants. this was in agreement with results reported previously for ppo in other dicotyledonous species, including hybrid poplar  <cit> , potato  <cit> , tomato  <cit>  and red clover  <cit> , and as predicted from m. truncatula genomic sequences , but is in contrast to ppo genes identified in monocotyledonous species, such as pineapple  <cit> , wheat , rice , lolium perenne  and festuca pratense .

the occurrence of multiple ppos on single bac clones and the putative alignment of four bac clones with six distinct ppo genes on an estimated 190– <dig> kb fragment is strong evidence for a ppo gene cluster in t. pratense . the order and presence of three ppo genes were confirmed by sequencing a  <dig>  bp bac clone,  <dig> g <dig>  similar ppo clusters were previously reported in tomato  <cit>  where seven genes were reported as clustered over  <dig> kb and detected both in m. truncatula, where there are two ppo genes present in  <dig> kb of sequence  and in rice, where two active ppo genes and a redundant ppo pseudogene  are present in  <dig> kb of sequence; rice ppo <dig> also contains a  <dig>  kb retrotransposon-like insert exhibiting 94% homology with a gypsy-type retrotransposon in rice   <cit> . retrotransposon insertion into the maize waxy gene does not appear to have impaired protein coding ability  <cit> .

no other genes were identified in the vicinity of the red clover ppo cluster, although retrotransposons and regions of homology with m. truncatula and lotus japonicus genomic sequence were found on the sequenced bac  <dig> g <dig>  retrotransposons are implicated in gene duplication, altering patterns of gene expression and generating new functions in legumes and maize  <cit> .

clustering of duplicated genes is a well-established phenomenon in plants. this could influence gene function and facilitate co-ordinated expression, and, in duplicated genes, such as ppo genes, minor changes in position may allow subtle changes in regulation, which may benefit the plant under new selection regimes by creating novel tissue-specific or environmentally induced expression.

evolutionary implications
gene clustering and the occurrence of paralogous sequences in the ppo gene family can hint at underlying gene evolution and function mechanisms. for example, paralogous genes are widely recognised and expected to have diverged by a minimum of 10% over time  <cit> . four of the five ppo genes have diverged by 10% or more at the cdna or amino acid levels , whereas ppo <dig>  <cit>  and the newly sequenced ppo <dig> share 94% identity. this is substantially higher than the 80–90% identity expected for ancient paralogues. nearly identical paralogues  have been defined as paralogous genes that exhibit ≥ 98% identity  <cit> . such nips are claimed to allow differential expression within the gene family and increase plasticity of the transcriptome  <cit> . in red clover, variants of ppo <dig> may be considered as nips: ppo1/ <dig>  ppo1/ <dig> and ppo1/ <dig> exhibit more than 98% identity.

the different ppos, including the three nips of ppo <dig>  have presumably arisen due to partial genome duplication, the extent of divergence relating to the timing of the duplication event. ppo gene sequences vary considerably, forming clear phylogenetic groups for higher plants, vertebrates, fungi and bacteria  <cit> . dna sequences show high homology within species and within families, such as solanaceae  and fabaceae  .

the divergence of ppo genes within red clover is similar to that observed within other plant species. for example, the two ppo genes identified in m. truncatula have 90% identity  whereas the seven clustered genes  in the tomato ppo family have between  <dig> and 97% identity  <cit> .

red clover possesses a large, functional ppo gene family . while ppo enzymes are expressed constitutively in aerial and root tissues of t. pratense, ppo enzymes only exist in a latent or inactive form in leaf tissue of both t. repens  and v. faba  <cit> . by contrast, ppo activity is not detected in other agronomically important forage legumes, such as medicago sativa  and lotus corniculatus , or in the model species m. truncatula and l. japonicus . at least one ppo gene is present in m. sativa, and two in m. truncatula yet, to date, no ests have been reported for either species. it is possible that conditions have not yet been determined that elicit ppo gene expression in these species, but the apparent lack of ppo transcript concurs with failure to detect ppo enzyme activity in tissues of either species.

these observations raise questions about the evolution of ppo genes both within t. pratense and between t. pratense and its close relatives. phylogenetic trees of divergence of t. pratense ppo dna sequences  confirm the level of identity of red clover ppo at the genetic level, with ppo <dig> nips being most similar and probably, therefore, most recently diverged  <cit> .

diversification of plant genomes is powered in part by gene duplication, which can result in new gene functions  <cit> . such gene duplication may occur by creation of polyploids, by segmental duplication or duplication in tandem arrays resulting in the production of gene clusters. positive selection is believed to play a crucial role in the retention of such duplicated genes  <cit>  but the effect of positive selection on tandem arrays or clusters of genes is not clear  <cit> . over time, individual ppo genes and ppo clusters may have originated, duplicated and subsequently been lost, their function governed by mutations in regulatory elements. a comparison of selected ppo dna sequences in both red clover and tomato , indicates that such gene duplication has occurred leading to clusters of six or seven similar ppo genes, each with known, different expression patterns.

ppo localisation and function
the biological effects of ppo appear to be subtle, possibly requiring specific or even multiple triggers for expression in vivo. enhanced localised ppo expression under biotic and abiotic stress provides evidence of its involvement in plant protection in various species, for example, localised ppo expression in leaf abscission zones during drought  <cit> . a multiple regulatory trigger might explain the prerequisite of plant hardening, by low temperature and low light mimicking autumn conditions, before any difference in susceptibility to sclerotinia trifoliorum was detected between late and medium-late flowering types of red clover  <cit> . similarly, differences in survival of low ppo-mutant and wild-type red clover plants only became apparent under multiple, natural infestations  <cit> .

the high degree of homology in active sites of red clover ppo indicates similar enzymic properties. however, differences do occur in localisation of ppo enzyme activity and specific ppo gene expression in both red clover  <cit>  and tomato  <cit> , suggesting significant differences in their regulatory elements; this is supported by observed differences in sequenced promoter regions of four red clover ppo genes. red clover ppo genes are differentially expressed in aerial tissues and root tissues  <cit>  conferring the potential for enhanced or localised expression following differing abiotic and biotic stimuli.

CONCLUSIONS
the red clover bac library has yielded novel full-length gene sequences of ppo <dig>  ppo <dig> and the ppo <dig> nip ppo1/ <dig>  which will be used in functional studies involving techniques such as rnai, and the ppo promoter sequences will be used for localisation studies using promoter::reporter gene fusions. it has also revealed recent gene duplication events in the form of nips and evidence of gene clustering. the bac library will provide a useful tool for the map-based cloning of target qtl, physical mapping, genome structure analyses and the alignment of specific regions of the t. pratense genome with its close relatives the model legume, m. truncatula, and other legume species such as alfalfa, revealing any genomic changes or divergence at these sites. the high degree of synteny between t. pratense and t. repens with both m. truncatula and m. sativa  <cit>  will allow comparative mapping between model and agronomically important legumes.
