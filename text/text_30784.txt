BACKGROUND
toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite that can invade and replicate in the nucleated cells of many animal species, including humans. in several host species, t. gondii is associated with congenital infection and abortion  <cit> , and it can also cause encephalitis or systemic infections in immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with aids  <cit> . t. gondii can affect pro- and anti-inflammatory host cell signaling in such a way as to maximize parasite multiplication and spread, while maintaining host survival  <cit> . an aspect of this is the up-regulation of interleukin- <dig> -dependent production of interferon gamma , which is critical for host survival during acute toxoplasmosis  <cit> . to perform this essential role in host defense, immune cells must migrate to the site of infection, where they release ifn-γ, which is critical for macrophage and t cell activation  <cit> .

leukocytes are used by t. gondii for transport throughout a host animal  <cit> . when a host ingests t. gondii-containing cysts or oocysts, free parasites are released into the gut lumen. after invading enterocytes, infected cells secrete chemokines such as chemokine  ligand  <dig> , ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  and chemokine  ligand  <dig> , to recruit leukocytes into the lamina propria extravascular space  <cit> . the parasites then spread to several distant tissues such as the spleen, lungs and brain  <cit>  and t. gondii-infected cd11b+ leukocytes actively travel through the lymphatic system and blood vessels  <cit> .

t. gondii possesses a unique mechanism for stimulating immune responses and cell migration in the host. profilin, a t. gondii actin binding protein, enhances the production of il- <dig> via myeloid differentiation protein- <dig>  and toll-like receptor   <dig>  <cit> . it has been reported that t. gondii heat shock protein 70-induced nitric oxide  release was dependent on tlr <dig>  myd <dig> and the il- <dig> receptor-associated kinase  <dig>  <cit> . this immunomodulatory effect also involves cysteine-cysteine chemokine receptor  <dig>  triggering in dendritic cells  and macrophages, through the secretion of t. gondii cyclophilin   <cit> . tgcyp <dig> appears to induce il- <dig> production by interacting directly with ccr <dig>  this effect can be blocked by cyclosporin a  <cit> , suggesting that this is a unique property of tgcyp <dig> 

interestingly, tgcyp <dig> recruits immature mouse dcs in vitro; it appears to act as a structural mimic of ccr5-binding ligands, albeit one with no sequence similarity to known host ligands  for this receptor  <cit> . in a previous study, we showed that tgcyp <dig> controlled the migration of macrophages and spleen cells in vitro in a dose- and ccr5-dependent manner  <cit> . however, our in vitro studies also showed that cytokine production and macrophage proliferation occurred in a ccr5-independent manner  <cit> . therefore, elucidation of tgcyp <dig> functions in regard to t. gondii dissemination throughout a host will be important for understanding transport mechanisms in host cells and parasites. this study, therefore, aimed to investigate the role of tgcyp <dig> in cellular recruitment and parasite dissemination in a ccr5-independent manner through the use of recombinant parasites that had been transfected with tgcyp <dig>

transfection and selection of t. gondii
electroporation of tachyzoites was performed as previously described  <cit> . briefly, purified t. gondii rh tachyzoites were resuspended  in cytomix buffer  supplemented with 2 mm adenosine triphosphate  and 5 mm glutathione. cells were electroporated  using a gene pulser ii . after transfection, tachyzoites were allowed to infect vero cells for 18 h in drug-free culture medium to permit phenotypic expression of the dhfr-ts and gfp genes as selectable markers, after which pyrimethamine was added at a final concentration of 1 μm. polyclonal transfected pyrimethamine-resistant tachyzoite cultures were subjected to plaque purification. cultures were passaged at least four times in the same medium containing 1% agarose and a single plaque was obtained. positive clones were identified by indirect fluorescent antibody tests  using an anti-ha. <dig> mouse monoclonal antibody . the resultant recombinant t. gondii clones, pdmg-tgcyp18ha and pdmg, are hereafter designated rh-oe and rh-gfp, respectively. the tgcyp <dig> expression levels among three independent clones from each transfectant were examined by western blotting and tgcyp <dig> secretion assays, and a representative clone was selected for further study.

western blot analysis
tachyzoites  of wild type parasites , rh-oe or rh-gfp were harvested, washed and suspended in 10 μl of pbs, sonicated, and then mixed with 10 μl of 2 × sodium dodecyl sulfate  gel-loading buffer  under reducing conditions. samples were heated at 95°c for 5 min and separated on a 15% polyacrylamide gel. after sds polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the protein bands in the gel were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane . after washing twice with pbs containing  <dig> %  tween  <dig> , membranes were blocked with pbs containing 3%  skimmed milk  for 12 h at 4°c. after two further washes, the membranes were incubated with an anti-tgcyp <dig> rabbit antibody at 1: <dig>  <cit> , an anti-tgsag <dig> mab  or an anti-ha. <dig> mab  for 1 h at room temperature. after washing three times, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase -conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin g  diluted in pbs-sm, for 1 h at 37°c. after washing three times, the proteins were visualized on x-ray film using ecl™ western blotting detection reagents  according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

parasite infections in mice
parasites purified from in vitro cultures were washed in sterile pbs and tachyzoites  were inoculated intraperitoneally into mice. three or five days after the infection, cells were collected from the peritoneal cavity of naïve or parasite-infected mice by peritoneal washing with 5 ml of cold pbs. after harvesting, the cells were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min and suspended in cold pbs. these cells were then subjected to flow cytometry. supernatants were used to measure tgcyp <dig>  il- <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig> and cxcl <dig> production. to determine the parasite burden and chemokine expression levels in the mice, tissues including the brain, liver, lungs and spleen from t. gondii infected and uninfected animals were collected at  <dig>   <dig> and 5 days post-infection .

sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  detection of tgcyp18
the presence of tgcyp <dig> in mouse ascites fluid and tgcyp <dig> secreted by extracellular parasites in infected mice was determined by a sandwich elisa as described previously  <cit> . to detect tgcyp <dig> from extracellular tachyzoites, purified t. gondii tachyzoites  were incubated in  <dig>  ml of git medium  at 37°c. before transferring parasite suspensions from ice to 37°c for a secretion assay, 250 μl of the parasite suspension was removed and processed as the time zero reading. the remainder of the parasite suspension was incubated at 37°c in a water bath. after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 120 min, 250 μl of parasite suspension was removed. the culture supernatants were centrifuged  together with the ascites fluid from the in vivo experiment, and then subjected to sandwich elisa.

microtiter plates were coated with 1 μg of rabbit anti-rtgcyp <dig> polyclonal igg  <cit>  diluted in  <dig>  m carbonate buffer , which was used as the capture antibody at 4°c overnight. blocking was performed with a blocking solution  at 37°c for 2 h. microtiter plates were incubated at 37°c for 30 min with each supernatant in triplicate. after washing six times with pbs-t, anti-tgcyp <dig> mouse serum  was added to each well as the detection antibody. after a further six washes, the plates were incubated with hrp-conjugated goat anti-mouse igg . binding was visualized with substrate solution . absorbance at 415 nm was measured using a mtp- <dig> microplate reader . the tgcyp <dig> concentration in each sample was calculated by standardization against the recombinant tgcyp <dig> protein  <cit> .

dna isolation and quantitative pcr  detection of t. gondii
tissues  and peritoneal fluids from t. gondii-infected animals were collected at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi. dna was extracted from tissues by resuspending the samples in extraction buffer  followed by incubation at 55°c. dna was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. amplification of parasite dna was performed using primers specific for the t. gondii b <dig> gene , which is present in all known strains of this species of parasite  <cit> . the pcr mixture  contained 1 × sybr green pcr buffer, 2 mm mgcl <dig>  200 μm each dntp, 400 μm dutp,  <dig>  u of amplitaq gold dna polymerase, and  <dig>  u of amperase uracil-n-glycosylase  ,  <dig>  μ moles of each primer and 50 ng of genomic dna. amplification was performed by a standard protocol recommended by the manufacturer . amplification, data acquisition, and data analysis were carried out in an abi 7900ht prism sequence detector , and cycle threshold values  were exported to microsoft excel for analysis. parasite loads were estimated by comparison with internal controls, with the level of the internal control calculated per parasite  <cit> . briefly, numbers of parasites were calculated by interpolation on a standard curve, with ct values plotted against a known concentration of parasites. after amplification, pcr product melting curves were acquired via a stepwise temperature increase from 60°c to 95°c. data analyses were conducted with dissociation curves version  <dig>  f .

peritoneal macrophage cultures
mouse peritoneal macrophages were collected from mice four days after their intraperitoneal injections with 1 ml of  <dig> % brewer modified bbl™ thioglycolate medium . collected cells were washed with 5 ml of cold pbs, then centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min and suspended in rpmi  <dig> medium  containing 10% fbs. the macrophage suspension was then added to 24-well tissue culture microplates . suspensions were incubated at 37°c for 3 h, washed thoroughly to remove non-adherent cells, and incubated further at 37°c. macrophages were treated with purified tgcyp <dig> recombinant protein  <cit>  at 37°c for 20 h. cells were then harvested for qpcr analysis to determine their chemokine expression levels.

RESULTS
characterization of recombinant t. gondii
recombinant parasites expressing tgcyp <dig> fused to ha were established. three independent clones expressing tgcyp18-ha were isolated from transfected polyclonal cultures. the reactivity of the recombinant parasites to an anti-ha. <dig> mab and gfp were confirmed by ifats. ifat analyses showed that tgcyp18-ha and gfp expression was detected within the parasite cytosol of the intracellular parasites . in addition, ha expression was not observed in t. gondii expressing gfp  or in wild type parasites . western blot analysis was performed to confirm expression of endogenous tgcyp <dig> and transfected tgcyp18-ha . an anti-sag <dig> antibody was used as an internal control to confirm that each lane contained an equal amount of parasite lysate. western blotting with an anti tgcyp <dig> antibody indicated that the three pdmg-tgcyp18ha clones  each expressed an additional band of a slightly larger size  than that of the endogenous protein , as shown in rh-wt  and rh-gfp . expression of tgcyp18-ha from rh-oe was confirmed using the anti-ha. <dig> mab. reactivity against anti-ha. <dig> mab was not seen in rh-wt  and rh-gfp parasites . the 19 kda band was seen in the three rh-oe clones. the band at 19 kda was consistent with that observed on the anti-tgcyp <dig> western blot. the band at 20 kda, seen in the three rh-oe clones, might be premature tgcyp18-ha. furthermore, there was no significant difference in the growth of rh-gfp clones, or the three rh-oe clones in vero cells . in a tgcyp <dig> secretion assay, the c <dig> clone produced more tgcyp <dig> protein than the other clones . thus, the rh-oe c <dig> clone was selected for further studies.

detection of tgcyp <dig> in extracellular parasites and infected mice
extracellular rh-oe parasites spontaneously secreted higher levels of tgcyp <dig> into the medium compared with rh-wt or rh-gfp . time-dependent secretion of tgcyp <dig> by the extracellular parasites was observed. in addition, statistically significant higher levels of tgcyp <dig> were detected in the ascetic fluid from rh-oe-infected mice at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi compared with that of the rh-gfp-infected animals .

effects of tgcyp <dig> induction on il- <dig> production in vivo
upon in vitro infection with rh-oe parasites, il- <dig> production was not significantly different in the infected peritoneal macrophages than those infected with rh-gfp parasites . to compare cytokine production between the wt and ccr5−/− mice following t. gondii infection, ascetic fluid was collected from rh-gfp- and rh-oe-infected animals . significant increases in il- <dig> production were apparent in the ccr5−/− mice infected with rh-oe at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi compared with infections with rh-gfp. however, there was no significant difference in il- <dig> production levels between wt and ccr5−/− mice infected with the same parasite strain.

effects of tgcyp <dig> on immune cell recruitment
absolute numbers of cd11b+ , cd11c+ , cd3+  and ccr5+ cells recruited to the site of infection were measured . at both  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, rh-gfp infection enhanced the migration of cd11b+ cells, while ccr5+, cd11b+, cd11c+ and cd3+ cell migration were all enhanced by rh-oe infection. at  <dig> dpi, ccr5+, cd11b+ and cd3+ cell migration was enhanced in wt mice infected with rh-oe compared with rh-gfp. at  <dig> dpi, the absolute number of ccr5+ cells was significantly different in wt mice infected with rh-oe than in uninfected and rh-gpf-infected mice. a comparison of infection rates for rh-gfp and rh-oe in ccr5+ cells showed there was no significant difference between the two strains at  <dig> dpi . ccr <dig> expression levels increased in the rh-oe-infected ccr5+ cells from mice at  <dig> dpi . further analysis of host cell recruitment was conducted by analyzing the peritoneal cells of wt and ccr5−/− mice infected with rh-gfp or rh-oe at  <dig> dpi . t. gondii showed cd11b+ cell tropism, with no significant difference in the rates of infection , or the absolute numbers of rh-oe and rh-gfp parasites in these cells . at  <dig> dpi, cd11b+ cell migration was enhanced in wt and ccr5−/− mice infected with rh-oe compared with those groups infected with rh-gfp . however the differences were not statistically significant between wt and ccr5−/− mice infected with same parasite strain . in addition, no significant differences in the numbers of parasites in the peritoneal cavity of the different groups of infected mice at  <dig> dpi were found . this chemotactic result was correlated with high levels of tgcyp <dig> production caused by rh-oe infection.

effects of tgcyp <dig> on parasite trafficking properties
to further elucidate the role of tgcyp <dig> in trafficking parasite-infected leukocytes, the brains, livers, lungs and spleens from infected animals were collected at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, and the parasite numbers were determined . parasites were detected at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi in the livers, spleens and lungs of mice infected with rh-gfp and rh-oe. parasites were not detected in brain tissue at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi . wt and ccr5−/− mice infected with rh-oe had increased parasite loads in the liver compared with the rh-gfp-infected mice. there was no significant difference in parasite load between wt and ccr5−/− mice infected with the same parasite strain.

effects of tgcyp <dig> on expression of the ccr <dig> ligands and chemokines involved in macrophage migration in vitro and in vivo
to investigate the role of tgcyp <dig> on the expression of ccr <dig> ligands , peritoneal macrophages were treated with recombinant tgcyp <dig> protein in vitro . ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> expression was not affected by tgcyp <dig> treatment. however, ccl <dig> expression was enhanced by tgcyp <dig>  partially in a ccr5-dependent manner. additionally, we investigated the effects of the tgcyp <dig> recombinant protein on expression of the chemokines involved in macrophage migration to confirm chemokine expression occurred in a ccr5-independent manner . ccl <dig> expression was enhanced 2-fold in a ccr5-dependent manner. in the absence of tgcyp <dig>  the expression levels of ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and cx3cl <dig> in ccr5−/− macrophages were significantly lower than those in wt macrophages. cx3cl <dig> expression was down-regulated by tgcyp <dig> in a ccr5-dependent manner. ccl <dig> expression in ccr5−/− macrophages was significantly increased by tgcyp <dig> 

next, the spleens and livers of mice infected with rh-gfp and rh-oe were examined in vivo . t. gondii infection up-regulated expression of ccr <dig> ligands in the liver, but had no obvious effect on the spleen. in the liver, significantly increased ccl <dig> expression in wt mice infected with rh-gfp and rh-oe occurred at  <dig> dpi, while significantly increased ccl <dig> expression in wt mice infected with rh-oe occurred at  <dig> dpi, suggesting that ccl <dig> expression took place in a tgcyp18-dependent manner. as shown in figure  <dig>  comparisons of ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig> and cxcl <dig> expression in vivo indicated that higher ccl <dig> and cxcl <dig> expression occurred in the livers of ccr5−/− mice infected with rh-oe at  <dig> dpi compared with uninfected ccr5−/− mice; this suggests that the tgcyp18-mediated ccl <dig> and cxcl <dig> expression occurred in a ccr5-independent way. moreover, higher levels of ccl <dig> in the ccr5−/− mice infected rh-gfp at  <dig> dpi and ccl <dig> in the wt mice infected with rh-gfp at  <dig> dpi were detected, compared with the uninfected mice.

in view of the results of our in vitro and in vivo studies, we examined ccl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and ccl <dig> production in the peritoneal fluids of the infected mice . there was no significant difference in the production of ccl <dig> and cxcl <dig> in the peritoneal fluids of the infected wt and ccr5−/− mice. however, significantly higher levels of ccl <dig> were observed in ccr5−/− mice infected with rh-oe at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, indicating ccl <dig> production took place in a tgcyp18-dependent and ccr5-independent way.

discussion
control of acute toxoplasmosis relies on a potent th <dig> cell response that requires il- <dig> and ifn-γ production, which are generated through both innate and adaptive responses  <cit> . it appears that toxoplasma is unique in that it possesses two mechanisms that trigger il- <dig> production in dcs and macrophages  <cit> . one of these mechanisms is dependent upon the common adaptor protein myd <dig>  and is likely to involve tlr <dig>  <cit> . the other mechanism is dependent upon tgcyp <dig>  which is released by extracellular tachyzoites, triggering il- <dig> production through binding to ccr <dig>  <cit> . recently, our group reported that tgcyp <dig> induced production of no, tnf-α and il-12p <dig> in macrophages, and also up-regulated the production of ifn-γ and il- <dig> in these cells  <cit> . in the present study, the levels of il- <dig> in the ascetic fluid of rh-oe-infected ccr5−/− mice were significantly higher than those in rh-gfp-infected ccr5−/− mice, suggesting that cytokine production arose via tgcyp18-dependent and ccr5-independent mechanisms. tgcyp <dig> stimulated il- <dig> production in macrophages  <cit>  and dcs  <cit> . therefore, macrophages and dcs both play a role in il- <dig> production in the present study. further investigations are required to distinguish the relative contributions made by these cells. these results suggest that ccr5-independent accumulation of inflammatory cells at the site of infection might produce higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in ccr5−/− mice.

the ability of t. gondii to attract, invade, and survive inside immune cells , along with the migratory properties of dcs and macrophages that allow parasite dissemination around the host have been reported previously  <cit> * <cit> . our results revealed that while t. gondii could infect cd3+, cd11c+, and cd11b+ cells, it exhibited a preference for cd11b+. we observed enhanced recruitment of cd11b+ cells after infection with rh-oe. this chemotactic effect of tgcyp <dig> was correlated with the ability of rh-oe to increase ccr <dig> expression levels. thus, overproduction of tgcyp <dig> during rh-oe infection enhanced cellular recruitment. recruitment of cd11b+ cells in ccr5−/− mice infected with rh-oe was also higher than that in rh-gfp-infected mice. additionally, there was no significant difference in the recruitment of cd11b+ cells between wt and ccr5−/− mice that were infected peritoneally with rh-gfp tachyzoites. recently, our group demonstrated that recombinant tgcyp <dig> controlled the in vitro migration of macrophages and lymphocytes in ccr5-dependent and -independent ways  <cit> . therefore, the results presented here suggest that the tgcyp18-induced cell migration occurred in a ccr5-independent way in our in vivo experimental model.

migration of macrophages and lymphocytes to the site of infection would enhance t. gondii invasion into these cells, after which the parasite-infected cells, such as cd11b+ leukocytes, are transported to other organs  <cit> . our quantitative pcr analyses revealed that infection with rh-oe resulted in an increased parasitic load in the liver compared with rh-gfp infection. these results suggest that cells recruited by tgcyp <dig> are used to shuttle the parasite to other organs. in general, chemokines and their receptors play an important role in the migration of immune cells. a previous study showed that an early burst of ccr <dig> ligand production occurred in the tissue of wt and ccr5−/− mice by day  <dig> after oral infection with t. gondii strain 76 k cysts  <cit> . our present study showed that recombinant tgcyp <dig> increased the expression levels of ccl <dig> in macrophages. in addition, significantly higher levels of ccl <dig> were detected in the peritoneal fluids of ccr5−/− mice infected rh-oe. moreover, ccl <dig> levels in the livers of wt mice infected with rh-oe at  <dig> dpi were higher than those in the other experimental groups. consistent with our findings, a previous study showed that the parasite numbers in the livers of ccr5−/− mice were higher than those of the c57bl/ <dig> wild-type animals, while the parasite numbers were similar in other organs of the wt and ccr5−/− mice  <cit> . therefore, tgcyp18-mediated ccl <dig> production might contribute to macrophage migration to the site of infection and the transport of t. gondii-infected cells to the liver. besides ccr <dig>  ccl <dig> has been shown to interact with other receptors, including ccr <dig> and ccr <dig>  therefore, activation of ccr1- and ccr3-signaling may contribute to ccl5-mediated pathology during t. gondii infection. hence, the chemokines up-regulated in ccr5−/− mice infected with rh-oe may play a crucial role in ccr5-independent macrophage migration.

to test this idea in our study, the expression levels of chemokines related to macrophage migration were investigated. in vitro analysis showed that tgcyp <dig> increased the expression of ccl <dig> in a ccr <dig> independent manner. however, the in vivo data showed that a higher level of ccl <dig> was observed in the livers of the ccr5−/− mice infected rh-gfp at  <dig> dpi compared with those infected with rh-oe. although we do not know the reason for the difference between the in vitro and in vivo data, it is possible that ccl <dig> expression might have been induced before  <dig> dpi in the livers of the ccr5−/− mice infected with rh-oe. it is interesting to note that ccl <dig> expression was slightly increased in macrophages treated with recombinant tgcyp <dig>  moreover, the expression levels of ccl <dig> and cxcl <dig> were significantly higher at  <dig> dpi in the livers of ccr5−/− mice infected with rh-oe compared with the uninfected mice. thus, tgcyp18-mediated production of ccl <dig> and cxcl <dig> in the liver may trigger transport of t. gondii-infected macrophages via a ccr <dig> and cxcr3-dependent mechanism, respectively. ccr2−/− mice have profound defects in monocyte recruitment although constitutive trafficking remains unaffected  <cit> . ccr2−/− mice or ccl2−/− mice failed to recruit gr1+ inflammatory monocytes, which are required for mucosal resistance to t. gondii <cit> , or to control systemic toxoplasmosis by intraperitoneal infection  <cit> . furthermore, another group reported that the cxcr <dig> ligands, cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig>  were induced markedly at the levels in the spleen, lung, and liver following infection with t. gondii <cit> . induction of these chemokines was similar in wt and ccr5−/− mice up to day  <dig>  <cit> . cxcl <dig> is required to maintain t-cell populations and to control parasite replication during chronic ocular toxoplasmosis  <cit> . these results suggest that ccr <dig> and ccl <dig>  or cxcr <dig> and its ligands, play a crucial role in cell migration and control of t. gondii infection.

diana et al.  <cit>  showed that a t. gondii excreted-secreted antigen induced recruitment and migration of human dcs in a ccr5-dependent fashion. other studies in mice have reported that t. gondii activates dcs and triggers their migration to the spleen to activate proliferation of t cells, or to potentiate parasite dissemination  <cit> . tgcyp <dig> can attract mouse dcs in vitro <cit> . ccr <dig> plays an important role in the migration of intraepithelial cd8+ t cells, and in the regulation of an inflammatory response following t. gondii infection  <cit> . ccr <dig> also has a role in the migration of nk cells, with severe deleterious effects observed in infected mice  <cit> . thus, it has been shown that increased immune cell migration is involved in the pathogenesis and control of infection with t. gondii. in the present study, based on survival rates, significant differences were not detected in the parasite-challenged  mice . all mice  infected intraperitoneally with  <dig>  tachyzoites died by 8– <dig> dpi. all mice  infected intraperitoneally with  <dig> tachyzoites died by 11– <dig> dpi. histopathological lesions in livers, spleens and lungs were observed in all mice infected with rh-gfp and rh-oe, but there were no remarkable differences in the severity of the lesions among the experimental groups . this was probably related to the high virulence of the t. gondii type i strain. in addition, to determine whether macrophages assisted with t. gondii dissemination in the mice, c57bl/ <dig> mice were subject to macrophage depletion by treatment with clodronate liposome, and then challenged with the t. gondii plk strain . the survival rates of the clodronate-treated and untreated mice were 71% and 43% , respectively. therefore, it appears likely that macrophages assisted with t. gondii dissemination in the mice. however, the pathogenesis of infection with the rh strain is quite different from that of infection with the plk strain. hence, further investigations are required to confirm the contribution of tgcyp <dig> to parasite pathogenesis and the role of macrophages in parasite dissemination.

the recombinant strain  of the parasite expresses tgcyp <dig> fused to ha. therefore, it is unclear whether the effects of infection with rh-oe were due to tgcyp <dig> or ha . to address this, we generated a recombinant t. gondii parasite that expressed the tgcyp18-ha fusion protein as mutants , which when tested, exhibited reduced interactions with ccr <dig> . there was no significant difference in il- <dig> production levels in ascites fluid and recruitment of immune cells between the mice infected with rh-gfp and rh-dn . therefore, these data suggest that the effects of infection with rh-oe were not due to the ha tag. in addition, the interaction between tgcyp <dig> and ccr <dig> played a role in il- <dig> production and recruitment of immune cells in the wild type mice.

taken together, it appears that tgcyp <dig> might enhance its effects directly through binding with ccr <dig> and/or another receptor or receptors not yet identified. regarding tgcyp18-ccr <dig> dependent or independent responses, there are two explanations that might clarify our observations. first, optimal production of tgcyp <dig> may under normal circumstances work on ccr <dig> and/or other receptor to recruit immune cells that produce cytokines. this possibility seems obvious in view of our previous results that showed that tgcyp <dig> controlled the in vitro migration of macrophages and spleen cells in a ccr5-dependent manner  <cit> . in contrast, tgcyp <dig> may initiate cytokine production and macrophage proliferation in a ccr5-independent manner  <cit> . second, it is possible that stimulation of host cells with tgcyp <dig> via ccr <dig> and/or other receptor could trigger expression of chemokine receptors and its ligands for cell migration. increased ccl <dig> levels in the livers of the wild-type mice infected with rh-oe parasites indicates that parasite migration to this organ occurred in a tgcyp18- and ccr5-dependent manner. furthermore, parasite migration, which occurred in a ccr5-independent and tgcyp18-dependent way, can be explained by the higher levels of ccl <dig> and cxcl <dig> in the liver and ccl <dig> in the ascites fluid of ccr5−/− mice infected with rh-oe. thus, the present results suggest that tgcyp <dig> has the ability to enhance host-cell migration via ccl <dig> and parasite dissemination by ccl <dig> and cxcl <dig> in a ccr5-independent manner.

CONCLUSIONS
we determined that tgcyp <dig> plays a crucial role in the migration of cd11b+ cells to the site of t. gondii infection, and that the mechanisms responsible could be both dependent on and independent of ccr <dig> expression levels. enhanced migration of host cells will mediate t. gondii transport to organs, especially the liver. we have shown that there are several options available to t. gondii for completing its infection cycle, one of which is ccr5-dependent, others of which involve tgcyp18-mediated production of chemokines in a ccr5-independent manner. additional work will be required to clarify the precise role that tgcyp <dig> plays in parasite-infected host cells and in parasite migration in the host.
