BACKGROUND
biofilms are generally considered as surface-associated microorganism communities encased in a hydrated polymeric matrix  <cit> . in marine environment, most of the solid man-made structures as well as natural surfaces are covered by microbial biofilms. together with diatoms, bacteria constitute the major components of biofilms occurring in the marine environment  <cit> . furthermore, all types of bacteria can form biofilms, making this sedentary lifestyle their favourite mode of existence in nature  <cit> . this mechanism is described as considerably important for survival of marine bacteria by providing a favourable environment  <cit> . this lifestyle, compared to the planktonic one, indeed improves access to nutrients and protects against stress, antibiotics and predators  <cit> .

quickly after immersion of a clean surface in the sea, microorganisms colonize it and subsequently develop biofilms with highly diverse three-dimensional  structures which can include channels allowing the flow of liquids, nutrients and wastes . the early stages of biofilm formation are based on the interactions of free-living bacteria with the surface which generates an initial layer of microorganisms and polymers  <cit> . thereafter, growth of the primary colonizing bacteria changes the surface characteristics of the substratum, rendering it suitable for subsequent colonization by other microorganisms. finally, the mature biofilm community is formed through synergistic and/or competitive interactions  <cit> .

few studies have reported the species composition of bacterial communities in marine biofilms. in particular, the roles and surface specificities of primary colonizers are largely unknown for most surface types  <cit> . the early-stage biofilms were dominated by the same major classes of bacteria that were most abundant in planktonic communities, with the latter demonstrating a higher diversity when compared with that of biofilm bacteria  <cit> . the alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria were recognized as the pioneering microorganisms in marine biofilm formation . then, acidobacteria, actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, chloroflexi, cyanobacteria, firmicutes, planctomycetes, verrucomicrobia and beta, delta and epsilon groups of proteobacteria were identified as minor phyla also belonging to these biofilms . however, the bacterial composition of early-stage biofilms may be affected by the physicochemical properties of the solid surface  <cit>  and by the variation of environmental conditions due for example to the seasons or the characteristics of the immersion sites  <cit> .

in the present work, we studied bacteria of two original types of marine biofilms from the french atlantic coast, displaying different characteristics. the first one is a non-permanent benthic biofilm sampled from an intertidal mudflat, which plays a central role in the production of oysters. indeed, oyster larvae can directly digest and assimilate bacterial carbon  <cit> . moreover, this biofilm indirectly feeds the planktonic trophic network through re-suspension of the biofilm in the water column. however, current knowledge on the structure as well as the functioning of this biofilm is largely conceptual and theoretical. the second one is a permanent biofilm formed on carbon steel structures immersed in a french atlantic harbour and involved in the early stages of the biocorrosion phenomenon  <cit> . in seawater, complex biofilms closely linked with corrosion products quickly develop on metallic structures. this can influence the deterioration of metal by microorganism activity, thus causing great damages to harbour infrastructures, resulting in economic losses. to date, the initiation of the microbiologically-influenced corrosion processes remains unclear.

understanding the initial stage of marine biofilm formation is highly important to explain the biofilm formation phenomenon. unlike the studies in which the structure of pioneering communities, developed on immersed artificial surfaces in seawater, is directly investigated  <cit> , our approach was first to build a collection of culturable marine bacteria isolated from two kinds of biofilms and then to screen for the ability of each isolate to adhere to artificial surfaces and to form biofilms under the same controlled conditions. the objective of this work was to obtain model strains with high forming-biofilm abilities, suitable for further experiments which would allow a better understanding of the colonization of a surface as well as the interactions that can occur between bacteria in a marine biofilm.

RESULTS
screening of bacteria for their ability to adhere and to form biofilms on polystyrene surfaces
in order to efficiently select strains able to adhere and to form biofilms, the whole bacterial collection of  <dig> heterotrophic aerobic bacteria, isolated as described in the “methods” section, was first screened with a rapid method, based on crystal violet staining of biofilms formed in 96-well microtiter plates . the bacteria that efficiently formed biofilms onto this surface after a  <dig> h adhesion step and  <dig> h of growth were identified by 16s rdna sequencing. this screening revealed that the biofilm formation ability was very variable according to the bacterial strains .fig.  <dig> quantification of bacterial biofilm formation on polystyrene microtiter plates under static conditions. bacteria were isolated from intertidal mudflat biofilms  and from corrosion product-microorganism composite biofilms developed on harbor metallic structures . after  <dig> h of growth, single-species biofilms were quantified with crystal violet and the ratios of od <dig> /od <dig>  were calculated. the ratios are represented on the y axis. dotted bars: bacteria with a ratio od595/od <dig> > <dig>  bars represent means ± standard deviations for three replicates



under our experimental conditions, out of  <dig> isolates from the intertidal mudflat biofilms,  <dig> strains were able to form a biofilm with a ratio of cel1s grown in biofilm/planktonic cells higher than  <dig> . these biofilm-forming bacteria were distributed in  <dig> bacterial classes: flavobacteriia , gammaproteobacteria , alphaproteobacteria , bacilli  and actinobacteria . the flavobacterium sp. ii <dig> strain, with a ratio of  <dig>  showed the best ability to form a biofilm on polystyrene. other bacteria displayed a strong ability to form a biofilm on polystyrene: postechiella sp. i <dig>  roseobacter sp. i <dig> and iv <dig> and shewanella sp. iv <dig> showed a ratio higher than  <dig> . the proportion of benthic bacterial strains able to form biofilms according to the sampling time at low tide is presented in fig. 2a. bacteria forming a biofilm were found at all emersion times . however, when less than  <dig> strains were isolated from a sample, no biofilm-forming bacterium was detected in this sample, whatever the emersion time .fig.  <dig> proportion of bacterial strains able to form biofilms on polystyrene microtiter plates under static conditions. results are presented according to the emersion time for bacteria isolated from mudflat biofilms  or the immersion time for bacteria isolated from corrosion product-microorganism composite biofilms . mudflat sampling was performed three times at low tide during three days . white bars: number of strains tested. black bars: number of forming-biofilm strains. *: no forming-biofilm strain detected



concerning the bacteria isolated from biofilms developed on corroded carbon steel immersed in sea water,  <dig> strains among the  <dig> isolates were able to form biofilms after  <dig> h  . these strains were affiliated to the same taxonomic groups as the benthic bacteria, but the proportion of bacteria from each class varied:  <dig> % alphaproteobacteria,  <dig> % flavobacteriia,  <dig> % gammaproteobacteria,  <dig> % bacilli and  <dig> % actinobacteria. under our experimental conditions, the ratios of cel1s grown in biofilm/planktonic cells obtained for these bacteria were lower than for the benthic bacteria. the ratio of  <dig>  for the roseovarius sp. va <dig> strain, was the highest value obtained for bacteria isolated from corroded structures . erythrobacter sp. iva <dig> was also interesting with a ratio higher than  <dig> . the results presented in fig. 2b show that bacteria able to form a biofilm on polystyrene were found in all samples, but the highest number was isolated from the steel immersed for  <dig> weeks.

in conclusion, this first screening allowed us to detect  <dig> benthic bacteria and  <dig> bacteria from corroded structures able to develop a biofilm in 96-well polystyrene microplates.

ability of the selected strains to adhere and to form biofilms under static conditions on glass surfaces
the above screening method in polystyrene microplates was rapid and convenient to detect the bacterial ability to form biofilms, but did not provide any structural information on these biofilms. to get this kind of information and thus study more accurately stable biofilms, the experiments had to be performed in dynamic conditions with biofilm observation by confocal laser scanning microscopy. such observations required glass surfaces, and it was uncertain whether strains able to develop a biofilm on polystyrene would also be able to do it on glass. since the biofilm study in dynamic conditions was labour intensive and time consuming, all bacteria that formed biofilms on polystyrene were then screened for their ability to form a biofilm on glass surfaces, first of all in static conditions. after a  <dig> h adhesion step and  <dig> h of growth, the biofilm was stained with dapi, and microscopic fluorescence observations were performed to detect the strains behaviour on the glass surface. among the previously selected bacteria , only the postechiella sp. i <dig>  flavobacterium sp. ii <dig>  flaviramulus sp. ii <dig>  roseobacter sp. iv <dig> and shewanella sp. iv <dig> benthic bacteria and the roseobacter sp. iiia <dig> and roseovarius sp. va <dig> strains from corroded structures were able to form biofilms under these conditions . microscopic observations of their biofilms showed a high percentage of colonized surfaces, from  <dig>  % for postechiella sp. i <dig> to  <dig> % for roseobacter sp. iv <dig> . on the bases of the biofilm structures, two types of biofilms could be distinguished . the postechiella sp. i <dig>  flavobacterium sp. ii <dig> and roseobacter sp. iv <dig> biofilms were very heterogeneous and contained large cell aggregates whereas the roseobacter iiia <dig>  roseovarius sp. va <dig>  flaviramulus sp. ii <dig> and shewanella sp. iv <dig> biofilms contained more evenly distributed cells. to classify the strains, bacteria were gathered when they exhibited no significant biofilm thickness differences. thus, flavobacterium sp. ii <dig>  roseobacter sp. iv <dig>  shewanella sp. iv <dig> and roseovarius sp. va <dig> were grouped. they built significantly thicker biofilms . roseobacter sp. iiia <dig> and flavobacterium sp. i <dig> biofilms were significantly thinner than all other biofilms, with an average of  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  μm respectively , and formed another group. finally, flaviramulus sp. ii <dig> biofilm exhibited an intermediate average thickness , significantly different from all other strain biofilms .fig.  <dig> fluorescence microscopic 3d reconstitutions and quantification of biofilms formed on glass surfaces under static conditions. after  <dig> h of growth under static conditions, biofilms were stained with dapi. microscopic 3d images were reconstituted , the average thicknesses of the biofilms were determined and the differences between them were statistically tested . a, b, c, d, e: bacterial isolates from mudflat biofilms. f, g: bacterial isolates from corrosion product-microorganism composite biofilms. scale bar:  <dig> μm. cp: percentage of colonized surface. these values are averages of data from three independent experiments, with standard deviations lower than  <dig> % of each value. *: p <  <dig> ; **: p <  <dig> ; ***: p <  <dig> . ns: not significant. circles with the same color indicate bacteria with no significant biofilm thickness differences. blue circles: thickest biofilms. red circles: thinnest biofilms. black circle: intermediate thickness



study of the bacterial biofilm structures under dynamic conditions in flow cells
through the previous steps, seven bacteria have been selected for their capability to form a thick biofilm under static conditions on polystyrene as well as glass surfaces. these bacteria were then studied under dynamic conditions, to further investigate strains able to develop stable biofilms. thus, bacterial biofilms were grown on glass slides in three-channel flow cells and observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy after staining with the syto  <dig> fluorescent dye.

the seven strains were able to attach onto the glass slide during a  <dig> h adhesion step in artificial seawater without flow, but the biofilms of three strains were not sufficiently stable and only four strains  were able to form biofilms after  <dig> h of growth under a continuous culture medium flow. the microscopic observations of these strains are shown in figs.  <dig> and  <dig>  after the adhesion step, flavobacterium sp. ii <dig>  shewanella sp. iv <dig> and roseovarius sp. va <dig> began to form aggregates or microcolonies, whereas roseobacter sp. iv <dig> cells were more individually attached . roseovarius sp.va <dig> cells were more filamentous. about  <dig> % of the glass surfaces were covered for all strains, except for the roseobacter sp. iv <dig> strain, which exhibited a significantly  lower percentage of colonized surface . after  <dig> h of biofilm growth, four different 3d architectures were observed . flavobacterium sp. ii <dig> biofilms harbouring numerous mushroom-like structures with a non-uniform distribution are reminiscent of biofilms of the well-known pseudomonas aeruginosa model  <cit> .fig.  <dig> confocal laser scanning microscopy images of attached cells after  <dig> h of adhesion on glass surfaces. bacteria were allowed to attach into the flow cells during  <dig> h in artificial seawater without flow. syto  <dig> red was used to stain the attached cells. a, b, c: bacterial isolates from mudflat biofilms. d: bacterial isolate from corrosion product-microorganism composite biofilms. scale bar: 47μm. cp: percentage of colonized surface. these values are averages of data from three independent experiments, with standard deviations lower than  <dig> % of each value

the flavobacterium sp. ii <dig> biofilms presented significantly higher maximal thicknesses compared to biofilms of the three other strains, due to the mushroom-like structures, but their average thicknesses were only significantly higher than those of the shewanella sp. iv <dig> biofilms . shewanella sp. iv <dig> displayed hairy biofilms with horizontal fibres, whereas roseovarius sp. va <dig> developed heterogeneous and tousled biofilms with cell aggregates . roseobacter sp. iv <dig> biofilms were quite homogeneous with a bacterial distribution covering the entire surface . the average and maximal thicknesses of roseobacter sp. iv <dig> biofilms were the same , confirming the regular distribution of cells. no significant differences were observed between shewanella sp. iv <dig>  roseovarius sp. va <dig> and roseobacter sp. iv <dig> for the average and the maximal biofilm thicknesses . similarly, the biovolumes of all  <dig> biofilms were not significantly different from each other.fig.  <dig> comstat analyses of biofilms formed on glass surfaces, after  <dig> h of growth under dynamic conditions. a, b, c: bacterial isolates from mudflat biofilms . d: bacterial isolate from corrosion product-microorganism composite biofilms . significant differences were only observed in isolate pairs a-b, a-b, a–d for maximal thickness, a–c for average thickness and are indicated by *  or **  on the upper part of the figure. in all the other cases, the differences were not significant



in conclusion, only four strains, flavobacterium sp. ii <dig>  roseobacter sp. iv <dig>  shewanella sp. iv <dig> from the mudflat and roseovarius sp. va <dig> from the steel structure, were able to develop a stable single-species biofilm under dynamic conditions. each biofilm had a specific structure. interestingly, these strains were the four bacteria that displayed the thickest biofilms  on glass surfaces under static conditions .

discussion
in this work, we studied bacteria that inhabited two types of marine biofilms. out of  <dig> isolates of our marine bacterial collection, only  <dig> strains from the mudflat biofilms and  <dig> strains from the corroded metallic structures were able to form single-species biofilms on polystyrene surfaces. this low number of biofilm forming bacteria could be explained by the experimental conditions. for instance, monospecies biofilms were performed, whereas in natural environments, the presence of different bacteria may help to build a biofilm. moreover, the substratum we used differed from that of the original ecosystem, and the time we let for the bacteria to attach to their support was  <dig> h only. this step was particularly relevant for pioneer bacteria known to settle in few hours in marine biofilms  <cit> . cell density, medium, temperature… may also influence the biofilm formation.

among our marine cultured strains collection, the most important bacterial classes able to form a biofilm in microtiter polystyrene plates were alphaproteobacteria , flavobacteriia , gammaproteobacteria  and bacilli . only  <dig> strain from each kind of biofilm belonged to the actinobacteria class. this is consistent with dang et al.  <cit> , who identified members of alphaproteobacteria , gammaproteobacteria , and bacteroidetes  groups, as the most common and dominant surface colonizers in their study.

out of the  <dig> alphaproteobacteria able to build a biofilm on microtiter plates, we finally selected two strains belonging to the roseobacter clade, roseobacter sp. iv <dig> and roseovarius sp. va <dig>  for their capacity to also form a biofilm on glass surface under dynamic conditions. it is well known that the roseobacter clade members are the dominant and ubiquitous primary surface colonizers whatever the type of surfaces, in temperate coastal waters   <cit> . moreover, dang et al.  <cit>  suggested that roseobacter were early steel surface colonizers, but also participated to the process of biofilm growth, while roseovarius would only be pioneer surface colonizers. roseobacter sp. iv <dig> and roseovarius sp. va <dig> are therefore two interesting models of potential pioneering bacteria in marine biofilms.

among the  <dig> gammaproteobacteria able to form a biofilm on polystyrene,  <dig> were alteromonadales, with  <dig> shewanella and  <dig> alteromonas. when lee et al.  <cit>  studied the succession of bacterial communities during the first  <dig> h of biofilm formation on acryl, glass and steel substratum in seawater, they observed that some species of gammaproteobacteria, such as alteromonas, were predominant during the first  <dig> h. shewanella sp. was until now not described as a predominant bacterium in atlantic marine biofilms, but was recently observed in early biofilms from mediterranean sea  <cit> . shewanella sp. iv <dig> was selected in this work for its ability to develop an original hairy biofilm with horizontal fibres under dynamic conditions.

we observed a very high diversity among the  <dig> flavobacteriia strains able to adhere on polystyrene: they belong to  <dig> different genera. previous works showed that bacteria of the bacteroidetes phylum  constituted a dominant and diverse bacterial group on carbon steel coupons, at all early immersion stages  <cit> , and it was suggested that different strains might be involved at different stages of the surface colonizing and development microbiota  <cit> . in our work, only one flavobacteriia strain, flavobacterium sp. ii  <dig>  was finally able to form a biofilm in dynamic conditions. both in static and dynamic conditions, flavobacterium sp. ii <dig> displayed a very thick biofilm. it is known that pathogenic flavobacterium species are responsible for great losses of fish in aquaculture farming worldwide  <cit> . aquaculture surfaces are easily colonized and persisting flavobacterium sp. inhabiting biofilms might serve as a source of infection or reinfection  <cit> . although flavobacterium sp. are important pathogens in the aquaculture setting and have been detected in industrial, domestic, and medical environment biofilms, the manner in which they form biofilms has not been elucidated  <cit> . therefore, the flavobacterium sp. ii <dig> strain constitutes a very interesting model.

we detected  <dig> bacteria affiliated to firmicutes  able to form biofilms on polystyrene. however, firmicutes were identified as minor phyla found in biofilms formed on acryl, glass and steel substratum in seawater  <cit> . in our experiments, the firmicutes then represent a high proportion compared to what occurs in natural environments. however, none of these strains was able to adhere to glass surfaces and they could not be retained as models. the same phenomenon was observed for the two actinobacteria strains.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this work allowed us to finally select four bacteria able to form a thick biofilm on polystyrene as well as glass surface under dynamic conditions: flavobacterium sp. ii <dig>  roseobacter sp. iv <dig>  shewanella sp. iv <dig> from the mudflat biofilm, and roseovarius sp. va <dig> from the corrosion product-microorganism composite biofilm. moreover, each of the four strains was able to develop a biofilm with a specific 3d structure. it will then be possible to accurately study potential pioneering bacteria in marine biofilms. primary colonizers are known to be responsible for the initiation of biofouling and may cause various damages in maritime activities and industries. the paramount importance of the bacterial primary colonizers in surface community formation, dynamics, and function needs to be explored. in future studies, we will investigate the interactions between these high forming-biofilm bacterial models and other marine bacteria from the same ecosystems in order to better understand the initial stage of marine biofilm formation.
