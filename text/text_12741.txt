BACKGROUND
over one billion people are infected by one or more neglected tropical diseases   <cit> . these diseases comprise a group of parasitic and bacterial infections that affect some of the poorest and most marginalized populations around the world, many who live on less than  <dig>  usd a day  <cit> . leishmaniasis is one such ntd that is endemic in  <dig> countries with a total of  <dig> million people at risk. the disease is associated with a global prevalence of  <dig> million cases, a yearly incidence of  <dig>  to  <dig> million cases, and an annual mortality rate of over  <dig>  deaths  <cit> . caused by leishmania species, the disease can manifest itself in varying clinical pathologies including visceral, cutaneous or mucocutaneous forms  <cit> . these parasites transition through different morphological stages - from flagellated promastigotes within a female phlebotomine sandfly  gut to non-flagellated amastigotes in host macrophages  <cit> . leishmaniasis and other ntds tend to be overshadowed by research that is focused on malaria, tuberculosis and hiv/aids  <cit> . there may also be a lack of interest by pharmaceutical companies in pursuing drug development against ntds due to a complicated profit motive  <cit> . issues with high toxicity, life-threatening side-effects, cost, parenteral administration and emergence of resistance are drawbacks common to existing antileishmanial drugs such as sodium stibogluconate, meglumine antimoniate, pentamidine and amphotericin b  <cit> . therefore, with limited viable treatment options and few alternatives on the pipeline, there exists an obvious need to develop radically new strategies and conceptual frameworks to identify compounds with novel antileishmanial activity.

computational metabolic networks have been reconstructed for several pathogenic organisms  <cit> , including leishmania major, an agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis  <cit> . implementing constraint-based modeling techniques, such as flux balance analysis , on network reconstructions has yielded valuable insight into gene essentiality and enzyme robustness under varying environmental conditions  <cit> . accordingly, analysis of pathogen intracellular processes can be used to predict critical protein targets that when perturbed singly or in combination have adverse effects on virulence and/or growth. here, a direct metabolic network-driven method that incorporates single gene essentiality and synthetic lethality predictions is proposed that generates a set of high-priority l. major targets, which are in turn associated with a select number of food and drug administration -approved drugs that are candidate antileishmanials. subsequently, candidate drugs, which are already in clinical use for other indications, can begin to be investigated for clinical use against leishmaniasis. in addition, the selection of high-priority double-drug combinations that demonstrate superadditivity might provide for an attractive and alternative avenue for drug discovery against leishmaniasis. by integrating publicly available resources using a direct and efficient method, the approach presented here offers significant implications to future drug discovery and drug repurposing strategies against leishmaniasis and other ntds.

RESULTS
conceptual platform of metdp: a pipeline for prioritization of targets and fda-approved drugs
the flowchart and conceptual framework for the prioritization of drug and drug targets against l. major  is presented in figure  <dig>  the specific datasets, tools and cutoffs used in the process of prioritizing effective drugs and drug targets against l. major are depicted in the diagram presented in figure  <dig>  the previously published metabolic reconstruction of l. major accounted for the function of  <dig> genes  <cit> . using bioinformatics tools, a mapping was created between these  <dig> genes and drugs in publicly available drugbank and stitch databases. using blast-based sequence similarity, an association was made between l. major genes and known targets and then transitively to drugs. deliberately implementing an e-value cutoff and a stitch confidence metric as well as selecting for only approved drugs resulted in  <dig> l. major genes being linked to  <dig> fda-approved drugs .

subsequently, a set of criteria was imposed to select for those approved drugs that might demonstrate effective antileishmanial activity. constraints were applied to both l. major genes  and drugs . to arrive at suitable cutoff values, the sensitivity associated with various cutoffs used in metdp was explored . in the selection of high-priority l. major targets, the first metric applied was a druggability score for l. major genes ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . druggability indices were obtained from the tdr targets database. the imposition of a moderate druggability constraint of  <dig>  selected for  <dig> l. major genes associated with  <dig> drugs . next, computational predictions of abnormal growth phenotype  from performing fba on the metabolic reconstruction were also applied for the selection of priority l. major genes. following sensitivity analysis , only those genes that when knocked out from the metabolic model yielded greater than 30% growth defect were selected. at this cutoff,  <dig> l. major genes linked to  <dig> drugs remained . further, flux variability analysis  was performed on the metabolic network of l. major to determine flux ranges for gene-associated  reactions. the motivation to use an fva score for genes was based on an assumption that genes linked to reactions with little variability in flux might be good targets to disrupt in the metabolic network. to elaborate, it was assumed that enzymatic reactions inflexible to take on a wide range of flux values may not necessarily be robust to network perturbations. hence, an fva score for genes was computed  and used as a metric alongside the druggability index and in silico gene essentiality analysis to prioritize l. major targets. with the fva cutoff of  <dig> , the number of l. major genes reduced to  <dig> with only  <dig> fda-approved drugs passing the cutoff .

*  lethal,  growth-reducing; †  endoplasmic reticulum

in parallel, high-priority synthetic lethal targets were also selected as part of the metdp framework. the motivation for investigating synthetic lethal targets was that there may be other drugs that act on multiple l. major targets whose simultaneous perturbation results in growth inhibition of the parasite. using this rationale, a synthetic lethality constraint was introduced into metdp in order to account for those fda-approved drugs that target genes involved in a 'non-trivial lethal' double combination . using the metabolic network reconstruction of l. major,  <dig> double gene deletions  were previously identified as non-trivial lethal  <cit> . once again, a moderate druggability constraint within the  <dig>  to  <dig>  range was considered: gene combinations with an average druggability index greater than or equal to  <dig> . in addition, both genes in the combination needed to have moderate druggability indices of  <dig>  or higher . a total of  <dig> non-trivial lethal double gene combinations satisfied this criterion . with the synthetic lethality and druggability constraints together yielding only  <dig> double gene deletions, an fva constraint was not applied in the search for high-priority synthetic lethal targets.

the final step in metdp involved considerations of tolerance and toxicity in order to place emphasis on drugs that have potential clinical relevance against leishmaniasis. drugs that are known common metabolites or chemical elements  and present in the metabolic reconstruction were removed from further analysis. also, any illicit drugs and controlled substances  were also removed. second, lethal dose  <dig>  data were culled from drugbank database and material safety data sheets available online, and a toxicity rating based on the hodge and sterner scale  was applied. following tolerance and toxicity analysis, the  <dig> single drug targets were associated with  <dig> drugs with a toxicity rating greater than or equal to  <dig> . meanwhile, a total of  <dig> drugs were associated with the  <dig> non-trivial lethal gene combinations. of these,  <dig> drugs were mapped to both genes involved in any one combination and  <dig> of them were unique when compared to the list of  <dig> drugs .

consequently, upon implementation of metdp by means of iterating through the pipeline , the prioritized list of single l. major targets included  <dig> metabolic genes  while the prioritized list of synthetic lethal targets included  <dig> double-gene combinations . collectively, these lists of high-priority targets were associated with  <dig> fda-approved drugs . the list of prioritized l. major targets is presented in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  the list of  <dig> fda-approved drugs  is presented in additional file 1: table s <dig>  and the list of all drugs associated with the  <dig> synthetic lethal targets is presented in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

in summary, metdp is a direct and rational method of prioritizing drugs and drug targets with a metabolic network as an underlying framework all the while providing for a possible mechanism of action for many of the drugs selected .

target validation: comparison of target predictions with observations from previous literature
as an initial validation, several of the genes in table  <dig> were identified as proven drug targets in the literature and some have previously identified inhibitors in leishmania or other related species. a particularly interesting target is lmjf <dig>  encoding for trypanothione reductase. in trypanosomatids, trypanothione reductase takes the place of glutathione reductase for the maintenance of intracellular redox balance  <cit> . trypanothione reductase is required for the survival of leishmania sp. and one important physiological role of this enzyme is defense against oxidative damage when parasites are resident inside macrophages  <cit> . host glutathione reductase and parasite trypanothione reductase have mutually exclusive substrate specificities conferring an advantage for the purposes of drug targeting against the parasite enzyme  <cit> . many inhibitors have been identified for trypanothione reductase, including trivalent antimony ) ions as recently demonstrated  <cit> . also, two nitrofuran derivative compounds were experimentally shown to be effective non-competitive inhibitors of trypanothione reductase in trypanosoma cruzi, a trypanosomatid organism and causative agent for chagas disease  <cit> . metdp predicted the efficacy of two nitrofurans associated with lmjf <dig>  namely, nitrofurazone and nitrofurantoin . other interesting targets in the prioritized list include lmjf <dig>  and lmjf <dig>  encoding for ornithine decarboxylase and spermidine synthase, respectively. similarly to trypanothione reductase, both genes are essential to leishmania sp. and model predictions are consistent with experimental observations  <cit> . ornithine decarboxylase is also an important target in trypanosoma brucei, another trypanosomatid organism and causative agent for human african trypanosomiasis, with a well-established inhibitor   <cit> . see also a discussion on false negative target predictions in additional file  <dig> 

drug validation: comparison of drug predictions to literature findings and existing high-throughput screens
as additional preliminary validation, the literature was mined to consider drugs that have been evaluated clinically against leishmaniasis . there were nine positives in lm254: amphotericin b  <cit> , ketoconazole  <cit> , fluconazole  <cit> , clotrimazole  <cit> , itraconazole  <cit> , miconazole  <cit> , terbinafine  <cit> , metronidazole  <cit>  and allopurinol  <cit> . note that for some of these drugs, the literature is controversial with regards to their efficacy in treating leishmaniasis. from the computational network analysis, seven of the positive candidates are predicted to exclusively target l. major enzymes involved in steroid biosynthesis, with exceptions being ketoconazole and allopurinol. the anti-fungal ketoconazole is predicted to be associated with four l. major enzymes: three involved with steroid biosynthesis and one participating in fructose and mannose metabolism. and, allopurinol is associated with an enzyme involved in methionine metabolism . previous research has identified the azole drugs ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole and fluconazole to be sterol 14-demethylase inhibitors that have been evaluated in vitro against t. cruzi parasites or in mouse models of t. cruzi infection  <cit> . additionally, in the fungal species candida albicans, clotrimazole and terbinafine have been shown to be inhibitors of sterol 14-demethylase and squalene monooxygenase, respectively  <cit> . these references from other organisms serve as a check for some of the computationally predicted links in metdp between l. major genes and drugs.

there were also four false negative results: imiquimod  <cit> , paromomycin  <cit> , pentamidine  <cit>  and sodium stibogluconate  <cit> . imiquimod is a modulator of the innate immune response  <cit> , and paromomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that binds to the aminoacyl decoding site of the ribosomal 16s rna  <cit> . since both imiquimod and paromomycin do not primarily target l. major proteins, their exclusion from lm <dig> was obvious. however, the reasons for exclusion of all four drugs from lm <dig> were examined in further detail . hence, nine out of thirteen  clinically relevant drugs for leishmaniasis were present in lm <dig>  three other drugs used clinically against leishmaniasis  were not considered in the analysis as they were not present in drugbank.

additionally, several high-throughput drugs screens against in vitro growth of leishmania and trypanosoma species have been recently published  <cit> . in particular, one study by sharlow et al. screened  <dig>  compounds at  <dig> μm against l. major promastigotes  <cit> . a total of  <dig> fda-approved drugs that were also in drugbank database overlapped with the set of  <dig>  compounds;  <dig> out of  <dig> were present in lm <dig>  of these  <dig> drugs, seven  were active as primary hits in the high-throughput screen, and the remaining  <dig> were classified as inactive as they did not meet the 50% inhibition threshold when evaluated at  <dig> μm. furthermore, during assay optimization and validation screening in the same study, two additional drugs not included in the list of  <dig>  tamoxifen and mycophenolic acid, were also deemed to be primary hits  <cit> . these two drugs were also included in lm <dig>  a second high-throughput screening  study for inhibitors cytotoxic to bloodstream form t. brucei tested  <dig>  fda-approved drugs, bioactive compounds and natural products and produced  <dig> hits when assayed at a concentration of  <dig> μm  <cit> . one drug, paclitaxel, which was included in the list of  <dig> hits was also present in lm <dig>  paclitaxel was not included in the set of  <dig> drugs evaluated in the sharlow et al. study. in previous literature, paclitaxel along with ifnγ was shown to induce killing of l. major infected murine macrophages  <cit> . in summary, from comparison to hts data,  <dig> out of  <dig>  drugs from lm <dig> that were experimentally evaluated via hts were classified to be potential antileishmanial hits.

taken together, the inclusion of all clinically relevant candidates and existing hts data yields a total of  <dig> drugs  as having potential for antileishmanial activity . the hts data and data on drugs that have been used clinically against leishmaniasis account for only  <dig> out of  <dig> drugs. any drugs in lm <dig> not previously evaluated against l. major parasites  serve as prime candidates for future investigation into the discovery of antileishmanial compounds.

in vitro experimental evaluation of halofantrine
the next step involved the in vitro evaluation of candidate antileishmanials as prioritized using metdp. halofantrine, an antimalarial agent, was one of  <dig> drugs that was selected via synthetic lethality analysis , and was experimentally evaluated for antileishmanial activity against l. major promastigotes. this drug was not included in the hts data that were used to validate the selection of high-priority drugs. halofantrine showed noticeable antileishmanial activity in a concentration response assay . when compared to the 'no drug' control, the effect of halofantrine at  <dig> μm and higher concentrations was statistically significant . the ic <dig> for halofantrine against l. major promastigotes was calculated to be approximately  <dig>  μm .

originally, from the drugbank database, halofantrine was associated with vacuolar atp synthase catalytic subunit a from plasmodium falciparum. upon implementation of the metdp pipeline, halofantrine was associated with the following synthetic lethal pairs: lmjf <dig>  &lmjf <dig> , genes encoding for f-type h+-transporting atpase alpha chain, and lmjf <dig>  &lmjf <dig> , genes encoding f-type h+-transporting atpase beta chain. while the exact mechanism of action for halofantrine in l. major requires further investigation, the model predictions for halofantrine represent testable hypotheses. towards that end, an atp bioluminescence assay was performed to further investigate the effect of halofantrine on atp levels in l. major promastigotes.

as figure 4d demonstrates, parasites were incubated with or without  <dig> μm halofantrine in various conditions as follows:  media,  hepes-buffered saline  for 'no inhibition',  hbs with sodium azide for 'inhibition of f1-atpase and cytochrome c oxidase',  hbs without glucose, but supplemented with 2-deoxy-d-glucose and sodium pyruvate for 'inhibition of glycolysis', and  hbs without glucose, but supplemented with sodium azide, 2-deoxy-d-glucose and sodium pyruvate for 'inhibition of both'. in the assay, sodium azide was used to inhibit mitochondrial oxidative atp generation  <cit> . further, 2-deoxy-d-glucose  was used along with sodium pyruvate in glucose-free buffer to inhibit glycolytic atp synthesis  <cit> . in figure 4e, when the parasites were subject to 'no inhibition,' halofantrine caused a significant reduction in atp levels. figure 4e also shows that atp levels in parasites under 'inhibition of f1-atpase and cytochrome c oxidase' dropped significantly when halofantrine was added. likewise, atp levels in parasites under 'inhibition of glycolysis' dropped significantly when halofantrine was added. in both these instances, atp levels dropped to a level comparable to parasites subject to the simultaneous inhibition of glycolysis and f1-atpase/cytochrome c oxidase . hence, the atp bioluminescence assay suggests that halofantrine has an effect on either one or both of glycolytic and mitochondrial oxidative atp generation mechanisms. future experimental efforts can be directed at more precise characterization of the underlying mechanism of action of the drug and elucidating other potential metabolic targets of halofantrine in l. major. correspondingly, absorbance was monitored to make certain that the effects that were seen with regard to atp levels were not a function of variations in cell count across the various conditions . finally, although halofantrine is known to be associated with cardiotoxicity  <cit> , its potential as an antileishmanial agent should be investigated in more detail.

model-guided drug combinations as an alternative strategy against leishmaniasis
with the ability to computationally simulate synthetically lethal gene deletions, there exists an opportunity to predict and prioritize multiple combination drug therapies that may be superadditive/synergistic. a potential advantage of superadditive drug combinations is overcoming toxicity or side-effects linked to high doses of individual drugs needed to establish the same inhibitory effect as the combination  <cit> . one strategy of prioritizing for clinically-relevant drug combinations was to selectively focus on one drug that demonstrated excellent antileishmanial activity in vitro and was associated with low-toxicity. all combinations involving that particular drug could be prioritized for experimental analysis. selection of such high-priority drug combinations through the power of network analysis can augment single compound discovery strategies.

since disulfiram was previously shown to have a sub-micromolar ic <dig>  <cit>  , the goal was to identify superadditive drug combinations that involve disulfiram. marketed as antabuse, disulfiram has an ld <dig> of  <dig> mg/kg  and is used in the treatment of alcoholism. at a moderate stitch confidence of greater than  <dig> , none of the  <dig> high-priority synthetic lethal gene predictions were associated with disulfiram. therefore, the search criterion was expanded to include gene-drug interactions at a lower stitch confidence .

with the relaxation of the stitch confidence constraint, one pair of high-priority synthetic lethals was associated with disulfiram: lmjf <dig>  &lmjf <dig> , genes encoding f-type h+-transporting atpase beta chain. after tolerance and toxicity analysis, both genes were associated with the same  <dig> drugs . since the  <dig> drugs are predicted to act on both genes in a synthetic lethal pair, they are consequently predicted to be effective individually as well. all possible drug combinations involving disulfiram  were then selected. combinations of disulfiram with six other drugs  were experimentally evaluated against l. major promastigotes using the alamarblue assay. figure  <dig> demonstrates the superadditive nature of the experimental combinations of disulfiram with kanamycin, clozapine, amoxicillin, and chlorpromazine. in all four cases, the experimental combinations had a significantly greater inhibitory effect on parasite growth as compared to the calculated additive results . combinations of disulfiram with doxycycline and isoniazid did not show statistically significant superadditivity .

two of the combinations that demonstrated superadditivity involved antibiotics - kanamycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic and amoxicillin is a common β-lactam antibiotic. the other two combinations involved antipsychotics - clozapine and chlorpromazine are used in the treatment of symptoms associated with schizophrenia. of the four combinations, disulfiram + amoxicillin had the best overall toxicity rating. moreover, only clozapine and chlorpromazine demonstrated inhibitory effects on l. major promastigotes when tested individually . kanamycin and amoxicillin did not demonstrate any inhibitory effect at the concentrations tested .

interestingly, along with disulfiram, kanamycin and chlorpromazine are also present in lm <dig>  in the future, evaluating two-drug combinations where both drugs are predicted to be effective individually by acting on single lethal or growth-reducing targets may have certain advantages. based solely on synthetic lethality analysis, in the event that the parasite develops resistance to one of the drugs  due to mutations in an enzyme/gene product encoded by a single gene in a synthetic lethal deletion, the overall drug combination would be predicted to be ineffective. however, by considering only those drug combinations where the individual drugs involved are also independently effective antileishmanial agents, this limitation can be potentially overcome. if the organism becomes resistant to one of the drugs during infection, there is a potential compensatory mechanism in place for the other drug to inhibit growth. this redundancy may serve to prevent or delay the onset of resistance  <cit> .

discussion
recent literature has described the applicability of metabolic network analysis towards target identification and drug discovery in general. one study  used a variety of network analyses and bioinformatics-based sequence/structural assessments to predict a list of targets against mycobacterium tuberculosis  <cit> . by prioritizing targets using a layered approach, proteins that did not pass sequential cut-offs were filtered out  <cit> . another study implemented network analysis and molecular docking simulations to identify small molecule inhibitors of type ii fatty-acid biosynthesis enzymes in escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus and experimentally evaluated the computational predictions  <cit> . fba was also used to simulate drug synergy effects by assigning synergy scores to combinations of enzymes that would inhibit growth of e. coli in various environmental conditions  <cit> . network reconstructions of p. falciparum and vibrio vulnificus have also guided the prediction of drug targets, and investigational compounds were experimentally evaluated against these pathogens  <cit> .

here, a novel pipeline for the prioritization of drugs and drug targets is presented that is in many ways distinct from approaches previously developed. instead of restricting the search to compounds that may only target non-human proteins or have computed tanimoto similarity to important metabolites, metdp undertook a more expansive strategy in making use of protein-compound interactions present in both drugbank and stitch resources. importantly, a clear majority of the approved drugs target human proteins as opposed to proteins in any other single organism . therefore, rather than avoiding the selection of pathogen targets that are similar to human proteins, metdp explicitly sought out such targets in order to create a link between l. major genes and drugs that are already approved. the side-effects caused by any of the drugs in the prioritized list that act on related human targets are relatively well known.

in addition, by restricting the search to only fda-approved drugs and eliminating investigational drugs from the selection process, major regulatory hurdles that novel compounds are subject to before approval for widespread clinical use are bypassed. for instance, on average, it can take more than  <dig> years and over  <dig> million usd to bring a single novel drug to market  <cit> . moreover, only  <dig> to  <dig> new drugs are approved by the fda annually  <cit> . instead, drugs already approved for clinical use have known pharmacokinetics and toxicity/safety profiles   <cit> . therefore, by demonstrating novel antileishmanial activity for a drug already in clinical use for another indication, a candidate drug or perhaps combinations of drugs can begin to be effectively repurposed by being evaluated in phase ii clinical trials and bypassing approximately 40% of the overall cost that it takes to bring a novel drug to market  <cit> . besides, an fda-approved drug with demonstrated antileishmanial activity can also be prescribed off-label, thus making it accessible to patients urgently in need of an alternative treatment option.

CONCLUSIONS
ultimately, metabolic reconstructions provide a framework for the interrogation of human pathogens and serve as a platform for generation of future experimental hypotheses. this metabolic network-driven approach identified  <dig> l. major genes as high-priority targets,  <dig> high-priority synthetic lethal targets, and  <dig> fda-approved drugs as potential antileishmanial agents. as experimental validation, the antimalarial drug halofantrine was shown to have noticeable antileishmanial activity. moreover, through the atp bioluminescence assay, halofantrine affected either one or both of glycolytic and mitochondrial atp generation mechanisms. additionally, synthetic lethal predictions from the metabolic network aided in the selection of drug combinations with potential for superadditivity. for proof-of-concept, double-drug combinations were evaluated in vitro against l. major and four novel superadditive combinations involving the drug disulfiram were discovered. selection of such high-priority double-drug combinations guided by metabolic network analysis might provide for an attractive and alternative avenue for drug discovery against infectious diseases like leishmaniasis.

a rational method of prioritizing drugs and drug targets with a metabolic network as an underlying framework also provides for a possible mechanism of action for many of the drugs selected . surely the mechanism of action is only predicted and needs to be validated with follow-on experimentation. however, given a drug and potential target, a starting experimental hypothesis is provided. a network-driven approach guiding the selection of prioritized drugs can be immensely advantageous in terms of cost and efficiency in the beginning phases of drug discovery and can offer significant implications to future drug repurposing strategies against a variety of ntds.
