BACKGROUND
dna methylation, a major epigenetic modification of the genome found in most eukaryotes, is essential for normal development and crucial in many biological processes, such as gene expression regulation, genomic imprinting, x-chromosome inactivation, suppression of repetitive elements, and carcinogenesis. dna methylation preferentially occurs at the 5′ position of cytosine in cpg dinucleotides, which are mostly found in clusters known as cpg islands   <cit> . dna methylation in the promoter or the first exon of a gene  <cit>  generally leads to transcriptional silencing  <cit> . profiling dna methylation maps across the genome is important to understand dna methylation changes that occur during development and in disease phenotypes. the genome-wide dna methylation maps of many organisms, such as human  <cit> , chicken  <cit> , rat  <cit> , arabidopsis <cit> , rice  <cit> , and silkworm  <cit>  has been reported. however, the methylation pattern of cattle remains unknown.

somatic cell nuclear transfer   is a promising technology with numerous potential applications, including reproduction of high-value domestic or endangered mammalians, biomedical research, human xenotransplantation, transgenic research, disease models, and therapeutic cloning. however, low cloning efficiency and a high incidence of developmental abnormalities in scnt clones markedly hinder the use of this technology. developmental abnormalities include the large offspring syndrome, respiratory problems, placental deficiency, obesity, prolonged gestation, short life span, fetal edema, dystocia, hydramnios, and perinatal death  <cit> . the developmental abnormalities in scnt clones usually involve the placenta; the placenta is central to the onset of pathologies  <cit> , and most cloned fetuses die in utero because of placental deficiency  <cit> . we also found that placental weight and mean placentome weight were high, but the number of placentomes was low, in deceased cloned calves compared with calves produced by normal sexual reproduction  <cit> . the expression and dna methylation levels of several imprinted genes were also aberrant in the placenta of deceased cloned calves  <cit> . gene expression analyses of the placenta of cloned calves show that multiple pathways are affected  <cit> . placental abnormality may be the main cause of fetal death in clones. the principal cause of the developmental abnormalities of the fetus and placenta in cloned animals is aberrant epigenetic nuclear reprogramming of the donor somatic cell, which involves various epigenetic modifications. dna methylation is a major epigenetic modification of the genome and is crucial in nuclear reprogramming during scnt.

in this study, we analyzed the genome-wide dna methylation pattern in the placentas of cattle with the use of methylated dna immunoprecipitation combined with high-throughput sequencing  by illumina genome analyzer ii. the dna methylome distribution in the bovine genome was shown for the first time. two placental tissues were used in this study, namely, the placental tissues of deceased cloned calves  and normally produced calves .

RESULTS
global mapping of dna methylation in cattle
to study the global mapping of dna methylation in cattle, we generated a total of  <dig>  gb medip-seq data from two placental samples, including  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig>  raw reads. of the total reads,  <dig> % and  <dig> % were mapped to the reference genome for the scnt and control placentas, respectively, of which  <dig> % and  <dig> % were mapped to specific regions in the cattle genome .

medip-seq reads were detected in most chromosomal regions  . genome coverage was the percentage of bases mapped by genome-wide reads. in addition to cpg, 5-methylcytosine can also be found in several eukaryotic organisms in other sequence contexts, such as chg and chh , which are named as non-cg methylation. therefore, we analyzed the genome coverage of the cg, chg, and chh sites under different sequencing depths . additional file  <dig> shows that the genome coverage of the cg, chg, and chh sites negatively correlates with read depth; a large number of regions had low-depth coverage, and a small number of regions had high-depth coverage. additional file  <dig> shows the distribution of medip-seq reads in different cg density regions.

the read distribution on different genome regions represents the features of genome-wide methylation pattern. analysis of the read distribution in different components of the genome showed that uniquely mapped reads were mainly present  in intron regions . the proportion of reads distinctly mapped to cgis in the scnt and control placentas was only  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively . many cpg islands were located in repetitive elements.

dna methylation profile in bovine genes
the dna methylation profile in the gene region was calculated by the reads that were aligned on a distinct locus in the genome. generally, the dna methylation level dramatically decreased in the 2 kb region upstream of the transcription start sites  and dropped to the lowest point before the tss. the dna methylation level sharply increased in the 3′ direction and peaked just before the transcription termination site , and subsequently, the level dropped rapidly and remained constant at the middle level of dna methylation after tts . the dna methylation level of the control placentas was higher than that of the scnt placentas in the gene region. however, medip-seq technology is dependent on high sequences, such that only regions of relatively high cpg abundance are obtained. thus, many genes with spaced cpg sites may not be detected by medip-seq, even if few cpg sites present are actually methylated.

distribution of highly methylated regions
the uniquely mapped reads were used to detect the highly methylated regions , which are also called peaks. the hmr distribution in different genome regions was further analyzed. for the first time, we obtained  <dig>  hmrs in the scnt placenta  and  <dig>  hmrs in the control placenta . the average length of hmrs was approximately  <dig>  bp, and the hmr coverage on the genome was  <dig> % to  <dig> % . additional file  <dig> shows the cpg number in hmr. most of the hmr have  <dig> to  <dig> cpg sites. analysis of hmr distribution in the different components of the genome showed that the hmrs are mainly in the intron  and the coding sequence  regions . analysis of hmr coverage in the different components showed that the genome coverage in 5′ utr, cds, 3′utr, downstream 2 k, upstream 2 k, and intron was approximately 96%, 92%, 66%, 50%, 46%, and 10%, respectively . genome coverage was obtained as follows:  ×  <dig> 

cpg islands in bovine placenta
in this study, cpg islands that overlapped with the hmrs were considered methylated cpg islands. for the first time, we identified a total of  <dig>  cpg islands in cattle genome . of these cpg islands, only  <dig> %  , and  <dig> %   were methylated in the scnt and control placentas, respectively. these results indicated that most cpg islands were unmethylated in bovine placenta. most of the methylated cpg islands were present in the introns and cds regions .

methylated genes in bovine placenta
methylated genes were defined in this study as genes overlapping  with hmrs in the promoter or gene-body regions. a total of  <dig>  methylated genes were found in the scnt placenta, among which  <dig> genes were methylated only in promoters,  <dig>  only in gene bodies, and  <dig> in both promoters and gene bodies . a total of  <dig>  methylated genes were found in the control placenta, among which  <dig> genes were methylated only in promoters,  <dig>  only in gene bodies, and  <dig> in both promoters and gene bodies .

medip-seq data validation by bisulfite sequencing
we conducted bisulfite sequencing for nine selected gene regions on each unpooled samples. there were three individual samples in scnt and control groups, respectively. the dna methylation status of nine gene regions between scnt and control groups were analyzed by one-way anova and lsd tests using the spss  <dig>  software. in medip-seq results , upstream 2 k  of igf <dig> , tcf <dig> , and ube2s  were methylated in the control placentas, but unmethylated in scnt placentas. upstream 2 k of senp <dig> , znf <dig> , usp <dig> , and cd <dig>  were methylated in scnt placentas, but unmethylated in control placentas. cpt1b , not expressed in placenta, was hypermethylated in both scnt and control placentas. the bisulfite sequencing results of the eight aforementioned gene regions were in accordance with the medip-seq results . the upstream 2 k of hsp90aa <dig>  was methylated in both scnt and control placentas in medip-seq results, contrary to the bisulfite sequencing results, which showed that the region was unmethylated in scnt placentas. these validations were almost in accordance with the medip-seq results , indicating the reliability of our methylation data obtained by medip-seq.

dna methylation and gene expression level
we analyzed the gene expression in the placental tissues of deceased cloned calves  and normally produced calves  using rna-seq . we categorized genes into five groups according to expression levels :  <dig> , 0– <dig> , 1– <dig> , 20– <dig> , and >  <dig> . the dna methylation profile in and around gene bodies were compared among these five gene expression levels. a clearly negative and monotonic correlation was found between dna methylation levels around the tss of genes and gene expression levels. the tss regions of highly expressed genes were relatively insufficiently dna methylated, whereas the genes expressed at low levels were increasingly methylated . however, medip-seq technology is dependent on high sequence. thus, only regions with relatively high cpg abundance were obtained, and many genes with spaced cpg sites may not be detected.

however, the relationship between gene-body dna methylation and expression levels shows a non-monotonic correlation . moderately expressed genes generally have the highest levels of gene-body methylation, whereas the highly and lowly expressed genes, as well as the silent genes, show moderate dna methylation levels. the housekeeping genes show the lowest dna methylation levels.

in the downstream 2 kb regions of tss, the silent genes and housekeeping genes show low dna methylation levels, whereas moderately expressed genes also have the highest levels of gene-body methylation.

online data deposition

discussion
over the past decade, multiple methods have been developed and applied to analyze genome-wide dna methylation profile, including medip-seq, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing , and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing . wgbs is an excellent approach to determine the dna methylome. the dna methylome uses sodium bisulfite to convert unmethylated cytosine nucleotides to uracils and leaves methylated cytosines unmodified, which can be subsequently distinguished by sequencing. wgbs has high resolution, but it is costly, time consuming, involves complex data, and lacks comprehensive analytical tools, which considerably limit its popularity and applicability  <cit> . in medip-seq, anti-5-methylcytosine antibody was first used to specifically recognize methylated cytosines, and the methylated dna fragments were subsequently enriched. medip-seq is a suitable method to analyze the dna methylation status of heavily methylated genome regions. many recent studies have shown that medip-seq can reflect the relative genome-wide dna methylation profile  <cit> . therefore, we selected medip-seq to analyze genome-wide profiles of dna methylation in cattle in this study. however, medip-seq technology is dependent on high sequence dependence. thus, only regions of relatively high cpg abundance are obtained, and many genes with spaced cpg sites may not be detected. the methylation status of sequences where cpg sites are spaced  may appear unmethylated even if the few cpg sites present are actually methylated. therefore, this method is no longer the technology of choice.

genome-wide dna methylation maps of many organisms have been reported, but the methylation pattern of cattle remains unknown. in this study, we report for the first time the genome-wide profiles of dna methylation in the placentas of cattle. cattle show analogous dna methylation profiles to those of mammals and plants  <cit> . in cattle, the dna methylation level sharply decreased before the tss, dramatically increased towards the 3′ direction, and stayed at a plateau until the 3′ end of the gene body.

in bovine placentas, the methylation levels in the gene body are relatively high, whereas the promoter  remains hypomethylated, a finding that is consistent in human  <cit>  and chicken  <cit> . most of the promoter regions were hypomethylated, and dna methylation in the promoter repressed gene expression  <cit> . laurent et al. investigated the correlation of methylation profile with the expression level in human embryonic stem cells and found that the 20% of most highly expressed genes exhibited the lowest methylation levels at ±1 kb from the tsss. the methylation levels increased. we also analyzed the relationship between dna methylation and expression levels with decreasing gene expression. consistent with previous reports in humans  <cit>  and chicken  <cit> , dna methylation levels around tsss at the 5′ ends of genes are negatively correlated with the gene expression level, a finding indicating that promoter methylation is a repressive epigenetic mark that downregulates gene expression. dna methylation within gene bodies is more prevalent than in promoters, but information on the role of dna methylation in gene bodies is insufficient. gene-body methylation and expression levels apparently have a complex relationship. gene-body dna methylation is positively correlated with gene expression in humans  <cit> . however, the relationship between gene-body dna methylation and gene expression levels is not monotonic but rather bell-shaped in plants, invertebrates, and even in humans; moderately expressed genes have the highest methylation levels  <cit> . in bovine placentas, moderately expressed genes have the highest degree of gene-body dna methylation.

aberrant epigenetic nuclear reprogramming during scnt causes low cloning efficiency and developmental abnormalities in cloned animals. dna methylation is a major epigenetic modification of the genome, and many studies have shown that abnormal dna methylation reprogramming is found in cloned embryos and fetuses  <cit> . chan et al. investigated genome-scale dna methylation patterns of scnt-reconstructed mouse embryos using rrbs for the first time and found that epigenetic reprogramming after nuclear transfer in scnt mouse embryos does not fully recapitulate the natural dna demethylation events that occur at fertilization, which results in aberrant methylation at some promoters and repetitive elements that may contribute to developmental failure  <cit> . bovine scnt blastocysts bear significantly higher methylation levels than in vitro-fertilized embryos at satellite i sequence  <cit> . in addition, the dna methylation levels of several imprinted genes were found aberrant in various tissues of deceased scnt calves  <cit> . however, the genome-wide analysis of aberrant methylation in cloned animals has not been reported. in the present study, we screened out potentially aberrant methylated genes in the placentas of deceased cloned calves, which may have caused developmental abnormalities and ultimately resulted in the death of the cloned cattle. for example, igf <dig> was found hypomethylated in placentas of deceased scnt calves but hypermethylated in those of normal calves in this study. the placenta-specific paternally expressed imprinted gene igf <dig>  which is a major modulator of placental and fetal growth  <cit> , acts in the placenta to directly control the supply of maternal nutrients to the fetus. igf <dig> was overexpressed in cloned bovine embryos  <cit>  and various tissues of deceased cloned calves  <cit> . yang and colleagues also found that igf <dig> was drastically over-expressed in the bladder, brain, heart, and lung of cloned calves suffering from the large offspring syndrome compared with normal controls  <cit> . igf <dig> expression was also aberrantly upregulated in the heart tissues of deceased cloned calves, and igf <dig> showed aberrant dna methylation levels in the kidneys of deceased cloned calves  <cit> . in humans, igf <dig> upregulation is important in the pathogenesis of beckwith-wiedemann syndrome   <cit> , which is characterized by somatic overgrowth that is similar to the large offspring syndrome in ruminants. based on these results, we inferred that hypomethylated igf <dig> and the upregulated igf <dig> expression may promote overall fetal growth, and thus can be related to the large offspring syndrome and death of cloned animals.

for the first time, we have completed the genome-wide mapping of dna methylation in bovine placentas. this mapping can be used as a basis for further studies on epigenetic gene regulation in cattle and other ruminants.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have generated the genome-wide mapping of dna methylation in cattle for the first time, and our results can be used for future studies on epigenetic gene regulation in cattle. this study contributes to the knowledge on epigenetics in cattle.
