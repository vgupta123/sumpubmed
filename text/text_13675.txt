BACKGROUND
umbilical cord  blood is currently used as a transplantable source of hematopoietic stem cells  in humans, despite adult bone marrow representing the most common source of mesenchymal cells  for clinical applications  <cit> . recently, several groups have reported the isolation of adult scs or mesenchymal stromal cells  from human amniotic fluid, amniotic membrane and the umbilical cord  <cit> . specifically, the mscs have been isolated from umbilical cord, umbilical vein sub-endothelium, and the wharton’s jelly   <cit> . within the wj layer, mscs have been isolated from three relatively indistinct regions: the perivascular zone, the intravascular zone, and the subamnion area  <cit> . however, whether mscs isolated from the different compartments of the uc represent different populations remains unknown  <cit> .

the wj cells are not derived from uc but from the cushioning matrix in between the umbilical blood vessels  <cit> . this cell population meets the criteria for stem cells in that they can self-renew and can be induced to differentiate into various cell types  <cit> . contrary to what has been observed for adult mscs, wj cells share several of the properties unique to fetal-derived mscs. first, they have a greater expansion potential in vitro than adult mscs  <cit> . second, wj cells express hla-class i surface markers but do not express hla-class ii markers  <cit> . besides, uc-wj cells sharing common surface markers with bone marrow mscs, they also express low levels of transcription factors found in mouse and human embryonic stem cells  <cit> . these factors play a central role in the regulation of pluripotency and self-renewal. these factors include the pou  domain-containing protein oct- <dig>  sox- <dig> and nanog  <cit> . indeed, it has been shown that wjcs are immune suppressive in mixed lymphocytes assays by inhibiting t-cell proliferation  <cit> . this is a desirable mscs behavior to be use in cell therapy.

the mscs population in wharton´s jelly of uc has properties that make it of interest. for example, it is simple to harvest by non-invasive means, provides large number of cells without risk to the donor, could be expanded, genetically manipulated and differentiated in vitro <cit> . recently, mscs were isolated from bovine umbilical cord blood for the first time  <cit> , even though mscs have been already isolated from sheep and horse  <cit> . the wj-uc cell structure is embryonic in origin and it encloses the yolk sac, which is the source of primordial germ cells and the first hematopoietic stem cells  <cit> .

today, mscs are usually expanded in vitro in culture media supplemented with fetal bovine serum , a highly variable and undefined component which is known to be an excellent additive for in vitro culturing of various cell types  <cit> . fbs is used in cell culture media as a supplement for robust undifferentiated msc expansion, cell attachment, growth factors and vital nutrients. fbs contains xenogenic proteins, possibly inducing immunological responses and transmitting viral and prion diseases. it is also described the variability of lot-to-lot components  <cit> .

the possibility of stem cell isolation for use in cell therapy motivates veterinary researchers to direct their studies towards new sources to obtain a relevant number of cells and to minimize risks for the donors and recipients  <cit> . in  <dig>  for the first time in veterinary medicine, wharton’s jelly was obtained from porcine umbilical cord  <cit> . because of the high potential of these cells to be subcultured and differentiated in vitro <cit> , they have generated great interest for their uses in cell and gene therapy, cloning, virological and biotechnological studies. in vitro stem cell research is commonly carried out by culturing cells as monolayers using conventional tissue culture techniques. growing cells on plastic dishes provides a simplified and adequate approach to studying the effects of isolated niche components on stem cell activity. in an attempt to recreate this complex microenvironment and for more comprehensive understanding of the conditions experienced by cells in the body, the use of three-dimensional  culture systems is gaining increasing attention  <cit> . studies of the last years demonstrated that mimicking the components of the stem cell niche will facilitated self-renewal and controlled differentiation ex vivo  <cit> . further, the establishment of a simplified stem cell niche in vitro, allows future works to study physiological as well as pathophysiological mechanisms on the stem cell.

the aim of this study was to isolate and propagate the bovine derived-uc-wj cells collected from five pregnant calves by surgery procedure. additionally, it was compared the characteristics in terms of growth kinetics, cell viability, telomerase activity, phenotype, plasticity and multipotency. this study highlights the possibility potential source of multipotent mscs and may support many therapeutic and biotechnological roles in large animals.

RESULTS
isolation of bovine uc- wj cells
the wj collected from five bovine uc were isolated based on the capacity of mscs to adhere to a plastic surface, without the need for any enzymatic digestion, stripping of the cord vessels or dissection . the umbilical cords were sectioned into longitudinal segments  to expose the wj, and incisions were then made to the matrix with a sterile scalpel to expose a wider area of tissue for contact with the plastic surface . the segments were plated, and colonies of cells were observed with fibroblastic morphology . the cultures were continued until cells reached subconfluence . the cells were then expanded by successive passages  with no statistical differences among cultures. all five cultures were successful in producing viable cells at p <dig>  the isolation of mscs is based on the migratory and plastic adhesion capacities and normally show spindle shaped, plate adherent and able to be substantially subcultured in vitro. the bovine uc-wj cells described in this study presented the same morphology for all  <dig> initial sources. to date, most groups have used an enzymatic treatment including several proteases, such as collagenase, hyaluronidase, or trypsin, which can be associated with or without a mechanical removal of the uc vessels  <cit> . however, it is well known that the drawback to this enzymatic digestion is the over digestion of tissue, which may result in diminished cellular viability, degradation of cellular surface receptors and altered cellular function  <cit> . the possibility of obtaining human mscs from the umbilical cord matrix using nonenzymatic isolation has been recently established, however few reports describes this procedure for animal models  <cit> . this procedure diminishes the cell damage and increase cell viability which can explained the successful results obtained from five umbilical cords  <cit> .

serum-free media has already been used for human msc expansion and has been shown to result in better cell proliferation, as compared to medium containing fbs  <cit> . however, it has been demonstrated species-dependent differences when this procedure was applied in adipose derived stem cells with non-affected differentiation capacity  <cit> . in this study, it was possible to cultivate uc-wj cells from five different sources using a serum-free condition and reach  <dig> consecutive passages with isolated bovine stromal mscs.

cell viability, cfu, karyotype and telomerase activity analysis
after 15 days of culture, the first passage  was performed, and from p1- <dig>  p15- <dig>  p25- <dig>  p35- <dig> and p45- <dig> the mtt and colonies forming units cfu assays were applied. at p1- <dig>  after 5 days of culture,  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells / ml were obtained. from p <dig> to p <dig> the cell concentration remained between  <dig>  -  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells / ml . the cfu was not altered from p <dig> to p <dig> with  <dig> cfus counted on each plate . to measure the viability of the bovine-derived uc-wj cells in continuously cultured conditions, an mtt assay was applied. the only negative control that was used was the medium, and the results demonstrated that from p <dig> to p <dig>  the cells were in good quality utilizing the culture system applied in this study . additionally, a positive correlation  was found between cell viability and its concentration for five studied cultures . to verify the cell viability, an mtt assay was applied, and the results revealed good in vitro adaptation of these cells using any growth factor in addition to medium. moreover, the percentage of living cells did not decrease when the passage number remained at a constant level. previous studies in humans as well as one study reported to date in dogs describe the same culture condition for uc-wj cells, however the fbs was added as supplement  <cit> . until now, this is the first report on bovine uc-wj cells growth under serum-free medium.

the bovine uc-wj cells had a normal karyotype after in vitro culture, which proves that the tissue culture procedure employed does not alter chromosomal organization . in addition, the activity of telomerase was verified . this enzyme represents a reverse transcriptase that can elongate telomeric repeats and usually is diminished after divisions, and this activity triggers cellular senescence and apoptosis. besides, it has been described the importance of telomerase activity in mscs  <cit> . germ cells, stem cells, continuous cells and cancer cells express high levels of telomerase activity. this physiological mechanism maintains a stable telomere length with unlimited replication capacity revealed in mscs isolated from dog foetal adnexa  <cit> . as expected, bovine uc-wj cells expressed high levels of telomerase activity. to our knowledge, this is the first study to report that bovine uc-wj cells show telomerase activity and this phenomenon could explain the long term of cell culture  observe in this study.

differentiation of bovine-derived uc- wj cells
pluripotency was confirmed by the ability of bovine derived-uc-wj cells to differentiate into osteocytes, chondrocytes, adipocytes and neuron-like cells for all  <dig> bovine uc-wj cells. importantly, this suggests that bovine derived-uc-wj cells are capable of differentiation into multiple germ layers, an essential characteristic also observed in porcines, dogs, horses, duck and avian species  <cit> .

to ensure that the mscs properties were maintained during all passages, rt-pcr was used to measure mesenchymal and embryonic such as pou5f <dig> and itsn <dig> gene expression. all undifferentiated bovine-derived uc-wj cells expressed both genes in all passages .

undifferentiated cells were included in all analysis . to study chondrogenic differentiation, the cells were fixed and stained with safranin o at 21 days of induction. the presence of glycosaminoglycans was shown  as red deposits. osteogenic differentiation was detected by the matrix calcification shown by alizarin red staining. for all samples from p <dig> to p <dig>  a mineralized matrix was formed after 20 days of induction . the alkaline phosphatase activity for differentiated cells was intense  in contrast to undifferentiated cells  . this was observed at all passages. after induction, adipogenic differentiation of bovine-derived uc-wj cells was observable between 10–15 days. the cells contained a high number of very small lipid vacuoles that stained positively using oil red solution . the evidence of lipid vacuoles was frequently observed at p1- <dig>  but less so from p30- <dig> . the neurogenic induction occurred after 48 h when spindle-shaped cells began to contract and became to irregularly shaped . after 1 week of induction, all uc-wj cells in all passages expressed n <dig> ; however, the undifferentiated cells were negative for n <dig> . bovine derived- uc-wj cells exhibited a typical msc phenotype, with a gene expression profile that includes the expression of embryonic and mesenchymal cell markers at all cell passages. in mammals, embryonic markers are commonly expressed in pluripotent stem cells such as embryonic and induced mscs and regulate self-renewal and pluripotency  <cit> . an important property to evaluate in stem cells to assess their usefulness in allogenic regenerative medicine is the expression of markers related to their immunogenicity  <cit> . the inhibition of t-cell proliferation in response to mitogens was observed. future work includes studies to determine the capacity of bovine derived-ucwj cells in regenerate damage tissues as already performed in horses  <cit> .

expression of msc markers on cell surface and suppression of t-cell proliferation
the density plot expressed the isotype negative control of flow cytometric analysis generates the histogram of negative control applied in all measures . the expression patterns by immunophenotyping undifferentiated uc-wj cells revealed cells positive for cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> mscs markers  and negative for cd <dig> and cd <dig>  both cd <dig> and cd <dig> are considered hematopoietic surface markers that were not expected to be expressed in uc-wj cells as confirmed in the present study. to confirm the neurogenic potential of uc-wj cells in this study, we measured the expression of cxcr <dig>  snap- <dig>  along with the neuronal cell markers n <dig> and gfap. there were positive rates in n <dig> and cxr <dig>  70-90% . however, fewer numbers of cells  were positive for gfap and snap- <dig> cell markers . these results were repeated for all passages in this study. last, we assessed the ability of bovine-derived uc-wj cells to inhibit t-cell proliferation in response to mitogens. the addition of uc-wj cells to blood monocytes stimulated with cona or pma/ionomycin inhibited their proliferation less than 20% in comparison to no addition of uc-wj cells 89% of proliferation. this indicates that uc-wjs also exert immunosuppressive effects on bovine t-cells.

contamination of uc-wj cells with hematopoietic scs is a concern when cells are isolated from tissues containing clotted blood  <cit> . because bovine uc-wj cells did not expressed both cd45+ and cd36+, which are considered to be a common leukocyte antigen and platelet collagen receptor, are expressed in hematopoietic progenitors, they may be all considered mesenchymal origin.

uc-wj in vitro 3d culture system
based on the size of spheroids recommended by manufacture´s  we found out that 1 ×  <dig> cells/well and three week of observation was sufficient to produce  <dig>  spheroids/well with size of  <dig>  μm  as shown in figure 6b. this is the first report describing the uc-wj derived from bovine cultured in 3d system. the advantage of algimatrix® system is based mainly on biocompatibility and easy manipulation.

significant alterations in cell behavior have been identified, when they are grown in 3d compared to 2d conditions; including changes in cell morphology, differentiation capacity, replicative ability, cell signaling, as well as significant increases in their therapeutic potential  <cit> . however, in veterinary stem cell therapy this condition has not been evaluated. the successful 3d culture in this study open new perspectives in mscs studies involving animal model. however, further studies are still necessary to understand the mechanisms of cell-to-cell interactions, matrix remodeling and proliferation of animal mscs cultured under 3d serum-free condition.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a simplified isolation and characterization procedure for mscs from wharton’s jelly of the bovine umbilical cord and suggests that these cells have the potential to be a resource for isolating stem cells to be used for cloning, virological and biotechnological studies in veterinary medicine. further studies are undergoing in order to establish a serum free and 3d culture media to support bovine-derived uc-wj cells maintenance and evaluate their application on cell therapy and biotechnology.
