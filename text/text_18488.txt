BACKGROUND
calcium is an important intracellular messenger involved in most physiological process from protozoa  <cit>  to vertebrates  <cit> . in nucleated rbcs ca2+ regulates several cell functions including membrane permeability  <cit>  and cell differentiation  <cit> . the mechanisms of ca2+ homeostasis involve the extrusion of this ion by a ca2+-atpase on the plasma membrane and storage within intracellular organelles. most, if not all, intracellular organelles are capable of storing ca2+ including the er, acidic pools, and mitochondria among others  <cit> . calcium uptake into organelles proceeds against its chemical gradient and requires energy to operate. in the er there is a specialized ca2+-atpase   <cit> . in mitochondria the energy is provided by the membrane potential  <cit> . the mitochondria have the capacity to store high concentrations of ca2+, not only by atp hydrolysis but, mainly, by energy derived from substrate oxidation.

present in the immature stage of mammalian erythrocytes, birds, amphibians, fishes and reptiles, nucleated rbcs differ from mature mammalian erythrocytes by the presence of a nucleus and organelles. despite this, few studies of the mechanisms of ca2+ homeostasis in nucleated rbcs have been performed  <cit> . by studying signal transduction pathways in lizard rbcs from different families, we have been able to infer phylogenetic aspects and mechanisms for these cells to maintain its ca2+ homeostasis.

the squamates are divided in two large groups – scleroglossa and iguania. the first assembles the snakes, amphisbaenas, and a diverse array of lizard families, among them the teiidae, while the last comprise a less diverse assort of lizard families which includes the tropiduridae. we have previously shown that rbcs from the teiid lizards ameiva ameiva and tupinambis merianae  display two distinct types of intracellular compartments involved in calcium homeostasis. these cells display the p2y type purinoceptors that are probably coupled to g protein and promote an increase of c through the insp <dig> pathway  <cit> . here we show that rbcs of the tropidurid tropidurus torquatus  store calcium in the classical compartment er and in mitochondria. differently from the teiidae studied, there is a p2x purinoceptor in tropidurus torquatus that promotes an increase of c by influx of ca2+ from extracellular medium.

RESULTS
intracellular ca2+ stores in t. torquatus rbcs
by using spectrofluorimetry and loading rbcs from tropidurus torquatus with fluo- <dig> am, we characterized the intracellular pools involved in calcium homeostasis within these cells. we found c in the rbcs of tropidurus torquatus around  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm . in order to verify if t. torquatus rbcs contain intracellular ca2+ stores compartments, the cells were treated with the tumor promoter thapsigargin, known to specifically inhibit the ca2+ atpase from the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum   <cit> . fig 1a shows that the addition of thapsigargin  resulted in a sustained increase of cytosolic ca2+  of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm  when the cells were incubated in ca2+ medium . addition of thapsigargin in ca2+-free medium  resulted in an increase of fluorescence in rbcs of t. torquatus loaded with fluo- <dig> am. subsequent addition of ionomycin  resulted in further increased fluorescence  indicating the presence of other ca2+-stores. if the calcium pools were depleted by ionomycin, thapsigargin does not elicit any further calcium release . the increase in arbitrary fluorescence units observed on fig 1b and 1c indicate an increase on intracellular ca2+ on tropiduridae lizards rbcs. as these experiments were performed in a free ca2+ medium we therefore could not calculate the intracellular changes on ca2+..

differently from teiidae family, rbcs from tropiduridae lizards are not sensitive to monensine   nor nigericine  .

purinergic receptors in t. torquatus rbcs
atp triggers calcium release in the rbcs of ameiva ameiva and tupinambis merianae lizards. in these cells, we have characterized the g-protein coupled p2y type receptor as atp mobilized calcium from internal pools in a calcium-free medium. we also reported that the second messenger insp <dig> could be the signal for calcium mobilization from internal pools within these cells. in tropidurus torquatus, the addition of atp  promotes a sustained increase of c of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm  when the cells are incubated with fluo- <dig> am in ca2+ medium  . to verify if the purinergic receptor was a p <dig>  we have used a non hydrolysable atp analogue atpγs. in fig 2b, we showed that atpγs  induced an increase in the c of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm . to observe the presence of a p2y purinoceptors we treated the rbcs with a specific antagonist to this type of receptor. we have shown that addition of α2metatp  did not induce an increase of c in rbcs from t. torquatus loaded with fluo- <dig> am . when the experiments were performed in a medium without ca2+ in the presence of egta  no effect was observed in fluorescence with addition of atp , although further addition of ionomycin  promotes ca2+ release . when we incubated the rbcs-loaded with fluo- <dig> am- with the purinergic receptors p <dig> type inhibitors such as suramin  , for  <dig> min, no c increase was observed with addition of atp . these results indicate that the increase of c, promoted by purinergic receptors agonists, is from extracellular medium by activation of a ca2+-channel in the plasma membrane, probably a p2x type.

role of mitochondria in ca2+ homeostasis
to verify the role of mitochondria on ca2+ storing in rbcs from t. torquatus we loaded the erythrocytes with mitochondria indicator mito fluor green    and with ca2+ mitochondrial indicator rhod- <dig> am   . co-localization of the indicators  denotes the presence of mitochondria around the nucleus. similar to er in t. torquatus rbcs mitochondria are able to store ca2+. the disruption of mitochondrial potential by antimicin a   , fccp   and oligomicine   denotes its role on ca2+ storage.

mitochondrion has an important role on ca2+ homeostasis in t. torquatus rbcs. these cells were incubated with the citosolic ca2+ indicator fluo  <dig> am and with mitochondrial ca2+ indicator rhod- <dig> am. the addition of atp , as shown previously in fig 2a, induced an increase of intracellular ca2+ by activation of a membrane purinoceptor p2x type that promotes an influx of the ion. here we show the increase of mitochondria mt after an increase of c induced by atp  in t. torquaturs rbcs loaded with both fluo  <dig> am and rhod- <dig> am   . in contrast to what is shown above, in a free ca2+ medium, atp did not induce an increase of c and in this case we did not observe an increase of mt.  . similar results were observed when we depleted the er by the addition of thapsigargin    or with the ionophore ionomycin   . the experiments in fig.  <dig> provide evidence that there is a temporal correlation between the mitochondrial ca2+ rise and the levels of nadph. when we promoted an increase of citosolic ca2+ by atp  or ionomycin  in a ca2+ medium, we observed an increase of mitochondrial ca2+ and a concomitant increase of auto fluorescence of nadph. however in a free ca2+ medium atp is not able to induce an increase of c and in this case there is no increase of mitochondrial ca2+ or nadph  .

discussion
the effect of serca inhibitor thapsigargin indicates that in rbcs from t. torquatus er can sequester ca2+ and that blockage of the pump results in a rapid release of this ion to the cytosol. the fact of the increase of c, induced by thapsigargin, in t. torquatus was lower than the values found for rbcs in the previously studied teiid lizards suggests that the capacity of the er to sequester ca2+ is higher in the teiidae, or the affinity of serca pump to thapsigargin is lower in t. torquatus. differences on serca pump sensitivity to thapsigargin have been reported in different models. for example, micromolar concentrations of thapsigargin inhibit sercas in non-mammalian vertebrate cells of turtles  <cit>  and chicken granulosa cells  <cit>  or parasites  <cit> . thapsigargin induced a sustained intracellular ca2+ increase in a calcium medium. differently, in a calcium free medium a calcium spike occurs. these data indicated that, in a calcium medium, there is ca2+ mobilization from er and an activation of influx of ca2+ from extracellular medium. this mechanism, known as "capacitative calcium entry" is very common in non excitable cells  <cit>  and our previous reports have shown the presence of this mechanism on rbcs from teeidae family  <cit> .

not only er but almost all intracellular organelles are able to store ca2+ the diversity of ca2+ pools varies among different cell types. here we show that endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria are able to store ca2+ in rbcs from t. torquatus. we also observed that ionomicyn was able to deplete calcium stores after thapsigargin treatment. however reversing the addition do not result on calcium release from thapsigargin. this data indicates the existence of a third calcium pool in rbcs from t. torquatus. this could be a golgi-type ca2+ pool – which is insensitive to thapsigargin. another possibility was the presence of unidentified subcompartment of er expressing an thapsigargin-insensitive ca2+-atpase  <cit> .

the mitochondria, in most mammalian cells loaded with fluorescent indicators, appear disperse in the cytosol  <cit> . however, as we showed, in t. torquatus rbcs mitochondria is located around the nucleus, similar to other nucleated rbcs  <cit> . this indicates that this organelle is concentrated in a small region of the cell. in nucleated rbcs the advantage of organelles being concentrated in a small region of the cell leads to an increase of hemoglobin storage and consequently increasing the oxygen transport to tissues. mitochondria is able to accumulate ca2+ by the increase of cytosolic ca2+ induced by influx of ca2+ from intracellular medium or by mobilization from intracellular stores in several models  <cit> . the capacity of mitochondria accumulates ca2+ at higher concentrations, in response to an agonist, was explained by rizzuto et al   <cit> . the authors have demonstrated the proximity of mitochondria and er and the presence of microdomains in the cytosol where high concentrations of ca2+ are observed. by loading of mitochondrial ca2+ with rhod  <dig> am we show that in lizards rbcs mitochondria has a fundamental role in ca2+ homeostasis. there is an increase of mitochondrial c promoted by mobilization of ca2+ from er or by influx of this ion by activation of purinergic receptors in the plasma membrane.

in squamates all types of purinergic receptors have been found. in the same organ or tissue most subtypes of receptor are present. for example, in the aorta the lizard agama sp    <cit>  and the snake thamnophis sirtilis   <cit> . in nucleated rbcs the presence of purinoceptors  have been reported in avian species  <cit>  and lizards from teiidae family  <cit> . in t. torquatus our results indicate the presence of a p2x  purinergic receptor that promotes an influx of ca2+ from an extracellullar medium. we also show that p <dig> purinergic receptor antagonist suramin  <cit>  is able to block the effect of atp in rbcs from t. torquatus. the presence of other types of purinoceptors cannot be ruled out. possibly there are other signaling pathways involved in the signal transduction in the lizard's rbcs. for example, rbcs from t. torquatus could show a coupled g-protein purinoceptor that promotes an increase or decrease of other second messengers, such as camp or cgmp.

probably these mechanisms appeared separately in the evolution of these lizard's families.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work we founded that t. torquatus rbcs do not store calcium at acidic pools and display different mechanisms for controlling intracellular calcium levels when compared with rbcs from the teiid family. interestingly, the purinergic receptors present in these cells was found to be a p2x type. these receptors were activated in a medium containing extracellular calcium.

these studies open new perspectives to comprehend how calcium homeostasis and signaling in nucleated rbcs evolved.
