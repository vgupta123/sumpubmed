BACKGROUND
trees in temperate zones show periodicity by alternating active and dormant states to adapt to natural conditions, such as light, temperature and drought. growth arrest is the first step of plant dormancy, followed by the dormant state, which can be divided into two stages: ecodormancy  and endodormancy . in ecodormancy, plants can restore active growth upon exposure to growth-promoting conditions, while plants in endodormancy cannot  <cit> .

photoperiod has been known to govern the growth cessation of many trees in temperate climates. plants sense changes in the photoperiod through the leaves and send a graft-transmitted message to the terminal, so that the terminal initiates dormancy  <cit> . the identification of poplar flowering locus t  and constans  as mediators of growth cessation induced by the short day  photoperiod was a significant breakthrough in the study of dormancy transition regulations  <cit> . like-ap <dig> , a poplar ortholog of the arabidopsis gene apetala <dig> , mediates the photoperiodic control of seasonal growth cessation downstream of co/ft  <cit> . another environmental factor that controls dormancy transition is temperature. low temperature plays an important role in inducing growth cessation and dormancy  <cit> . however, a continuous chilling must occur to release endodormancy and switch to ecodormancy, and then warm temperatures in the spring subsequently reinitiate growth  <cit> .

environmental factors are thought to regulate the precise annual cycle’s time course by modulating phytohormone levels or altering the sensitivity of the cells to phytohormones. so far, gibberellins and auxin are widely recognized as the most important phytohormones involved in the dormancy transition  <cit> . applications of exogenous gibberellins could cause the dormant poplar buds to sprout without chilling, and it is shown that a low temperature could alter the expression of key regulators in the gibberellin signal pathway  <cit> . auxin has crucial roles in cambial cell division, which makes it very important in the dormancy-active growth transition  <cit> . a recent study shows that the induction of cambial growth cessation and dormancy involves changes in auxin responses rather than auxin content  <cit> . another phytohormone that may participate in the dormancy-active growth regulation is abscisic acid , which peaks in poplar apical buds after growth cessation and before bud set  <cit> .

so far, the studies on mechanisms of the cambial dormancy-active growth cycle have mainly focused on hormonal  <cit>  and transcriptional regulation  <cit> . the switch between plant dormancy and active growth is a complex biological phenomenon that involves a large number of genes and many metabolic processes, as well as the interactions of a variety of hormones. multiple levels of control networks are involved in such complex biological events, in addition to transcriptional and protein regulation.

small rnas , short  non-coding rnas, are important regulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level during plant development and response to environmental stress  <cit> . srnas, in particular micrornas , have been studied extensively in poplar, including genome-wide profiling of srnas and mirnas  <cit>  and stress responses to drought  <cit> , salt  <cit> , cold  <cit>  and pathogens  <cit> . in addition, some mirnas have been found to be of great importance in tree development. for instance, mir <dig> is reported to be involved in vascular tissue development  <cit>  and may be related to the cambial active period  <cit> . mir <dig> and mir <dig>  which is well studied in arabidopsis, appear not only to control flowering and the timing of sensitivity in response to vernalization, but also vegetative phase changes in trees  <cit> . although comprehensive work has been done to describe mirnas in trees during various cellular processes, there is no report on the expression profiling of mirnas in the cambial meristem during the dormancy-active growth transition and little is known about the regulation of mirnas in the process. in this paper, we present a deep sequencing profile on a genome-wide scale that reveals stage-specific mirnas in the cambial zone during this process. millions of srna reads were obtained, and after further analysis, we found  <dig> known mirnas, including developmental-, phytohormone- and stress-related mirnas, which showed significant expression-level changes during dormancy-release by chilling. furthermore,  <dig> novel mirnas expressed in the cambium zone were identified, and  <dig> of them had high detection frequencies and unique expression patterns. the target genes of these novel mirnas were predicted and some of them were validated. our results revealed the expression changes of mirnas in cambium dormancy-release by chilling in poplar, and provided evidence of mirna involvement in the regulation of the dormancy-active growth transition of trees.

RESULTS
dormancy-active growth transition induced by photoperiod and chilling in poplar
the induction of dormancy and resumption of growth in poplar were constructed according to espinosa-ruiz et al.  <cit>  with some modifications. after 8 weeks of the short day  treatment of 8 h light/16 h dark, the tree growth was arrested. dormant apical buds formed  and the layers of cambial cells  decreased from 6– <dig> to 1– <dig> . although trees were transferred to the long day  condition of 16 h light/8 h dark at this time, they would not resume growth, indicating their endodormant state. to release endodormancy, the 8-week sd-treated trees were exposed to chilling temperatures of 4°c. only trees exposed to a chilling treatment for at least 4 weeks could resume growth, which was shown in bud burst, and cambial cell division and differentiation, when they were transferred to ld conditions at 25°c for 3 weeks . the results indicated that the endodormant state was released and that the trees had shifted to the ecodormant state after 5 weeks of the chilling treatment. then, the active growth state was induced by 3 weeks of the ld condition at room temperature.figure  <dig>

deep sequencing of srnas in cambium during dormancy-release in poplar
to investigate the mirna component of srnas and the changes of mirnas in cambial meristem during dormancy-release in poplar, three srna libraries from the cambium of poplar, representing endodormancy with an 8-week sd treatment , ecodormancy with a 5-week chilling treatment  and active growth under a 3-week ld condition  after chilling, respectively, were generated and sequenced by illumina high-throughput sequencing technology. raw read totals of  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> from sd <dig>  c <dig> and ld <dig>  respectively, were acquired. after removal of low-quality sequences, adapter sequences, polya sequences, sequences smaller than  <dig> nucleotides and other artifacts, we obtained  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> high-quality  <dig> to 30 nt srna clean reads in sd <dig>  c <dig> and ld <dig>  respectively, for further analysis .table  <dig>

srna libraries generated by sequencing were complex in composition, including mirnas, sirnas, rrnas, trnas, small nuclear rnas  and small nucleolar rnas . to annotate the srnas, we first mapped the srnas of  <dig> to 30 nt to the populus trichocarpa genome  using soap software , and then characterized each kind of srna by aligning them to certain databases. known mirnas were identified by alignment to sequences in mirbase  <dig>  with no mismatches. meanwhile, the rfam <dig> , ncbi and genbank databases were employed to annotate the other kinds of srnas, including scrnas, rrnas, trnas, snrnas and snornas. the repeats that represented the srnas positioned at repeat loci were identified using tag2repeat software. in addition, there were possibly degraded species of mrnas in the srna libraries, which were determined through intron/exon alignment. the remaining unannotated srnas were candidates for predicting novel mirnas and potential mirna seeds edit. as a result,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique srnas in sd <dig>  c <dig> and ld <dig>  respectively, were mapped perfectly to the genome, and the proportions for each kind of srna were listed in table  <dig>  interestingly, the mirnas represented  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total srna reads in sd <dig> and c <dig>  respectively, but only  <dig> % in ld <dig>  there were ~ <dig> more unique mirnas in ld <dig> than in both endodormancy and ecodormancy , indicating that the mirna population in active cambium was more diversified, which may be due to the complex cellular processes associated with active growth.table  <dig>

identification and expression profiles of known mirnas in cambial meristem during dormancy-release in poplar
known mirnas in the cambium of poplar were annotated by alignment to the sequences in the available poplar mirna database. as a result, we identified  <dig> mature mirna, two mirna-5p, two mirna-3p and  <dig> pre-mirnas in sd <dig>   <dig> mature mirna, two mirna-5p, two mirna-3p and  <dig> pre-mirnas in c <dig>  and  <dig> mature mirna, two mirna-5p, two mirna-3p and  <dig> pre-mirnas in ld <dig>  all the mature mirnas identified belonged to  <dig> conserved and non-conserved mirna families, of which  <dig> known mirnas in  <dig> mirna families showed significant expression-level changes during this process .

to elucidate the potential regulatory roles of these mirnas in the dormancy-active growth transition, we analyzed the mirnas with unique expression patterns during the process, which were mainly involved in plant development and stress response, as well as the plant hormone signal pathway.

in our dataset, eight differentially expressed known development-related mirna families were detected, including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> . these mirnas functioned in cell proliferation   <cit> , vascular development   <cit>  and mirna biogenesis   <cit> . most of these development-related mirnas were enriched in the active growth stage. mir <dig> increased dramatically from sd <dig> to c <dig> and continued at a high expression level from c <dig> to ld <dig>  suggesting that the expression of mir <dig> may be affected by the chilling treatment. however, mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> showed no obvious, or only slight, changes from sd <dig> to c <dig>  but increased in ld <dig>  intriguingly, unlike other development-related mirnas, mir <dig> was enriched in sd <dig> and c <dig>  and was nearly undetectable in ld <dig>  the members of the mir <dig> family showed different expression patterns; some of them were highly expressed, while some were repressed during the active growth, indicating that members from one family could have distinct functions in this process.figure  <dig>

mir <dig> and mir <dig> are well known for controlling the meristem cell fate transition in maize  <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit>  and the vegetative phase change in trees  <cit> . in our study,  <dig> mirna members of the mir156/ <dig> family and six mirna members of the mir <dig> family were identified. intriguingly, mir <dig> was highly expressed in sd <dig> and c <dig>  and then decreased in ld <dig>  while mir <dig> had the opposite expression pattern , which showed a similar expression pattern during the vegetative phase change in trees  <cit> .

to investigate mirnas involved in the process through the plant hormone pathway, the dynamic expression levels of hormone-related mirnas were analyzed. auxin signaling-related mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> had distinct differential expression patterns in the dormancy-active growth transition . the expression of mir <dig> peaked in c <dig>  which was the phase sensitive to auxin treatment in dormancy. the unique enrichment in ecodormancy suggested mir <dig> had an important role in the transition from endodormancy to ecodormancy. unlike mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> maintained low expression levels from sd <dig> to c <dig>  and then increased dramatically from c <dig> to ld <dig> , indicating that mir <dig> and mir <dig> may function in the auxin pathway during active growth.figure  <dig>

several members of the mir <dig> family, whose target genes participated in aba resistance  <cit> , were identified in the cambium during the dormancy-active growth transition. the expression levels of all the mir <dig> members stayed basically unchanged during sd <dig> and c <dig>  while in ld <dig>  they displayed opposite trends . these findings showed that members of the mir <dig> family had different functions in this process.

the mir <dig> family repressed the conserved gamyb-like genes that have been implicated in gibberellin  signaling in anthers and germinating seeds  <cit> . we found that mir <dig> was highly expressed in c <dig> and kept rising in ld <dig> . the ga signal had already been proven to be a key factor during dormancy-release in poplar  <cit> . the expression change of mir <dig> raised the possibility that it may be involved in this mechanism through the ga signal pathway.

identification and expression profiles of novel mirnas
the mireap software was employed to screen novel mirnas from candidates by exploring not only the secondary hairpin structure, but also the dicer cleavage site and the minimum folding free energy . according to the analyses, more than 80% of the candidate novel mirnas in sd <dig> and c <dig> began with a 5′uridine, which was a conserved feature of mirnas recognized by the argonaute  <dig>  protein  <cit> . however, in ld <dig>  this ratio was reduced to ~50%. to ensure the authenticity of novel mirnas, several conditions must be satisfied: the lengths of the mature candidate novel mirnas varied from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides, the number of reads was greater than five, and all the unique sequences were identified in at least one library. as a result, we obtained  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> unique sequences in sd <dig>  c <dig> and ld <dig>  respectively. after removing the redundancy,  <dig> novel mirnas were identified in the three libraries. the average mfe value of novel mirnas in each library was − <dig>  ±  <dig>  kcal/mol in sd <dig>  − <dig>  ±  <dig>  kcal/mol in c <dig> and − <dig>  ±  <dig>  kcal/mol in ld <dig>  most of these novel mirnas were only expressed at a specific stage, and only a few of them were expressed in two of three libraries. we found  <dig> specific unique sequences in sd <dig>   <dig> in c <dig> and  <dig> in ld <dig> . most of these novel mirnas had low detection frequencies in all three libraries. here, we listed the mirnas whose detection frequencies were greater than  <dig> in at least one library and that had marked expression-level changes .table  <dig>

to validate the predicted novel mirnas and confirm the expression profiles determined by illumina high-throughput sequencing technology, we performed quantitative real-time pcr  on a subset of six mirnas sequences, including two conserved and four novel mirnas from sd <dig>  c <dig> and ld <dig> . most of the expression patterns were in agreement with our sequencing data, while a few mirnas did not show the same expression trends. for example, the expression level of a-m0126_3p in c <dig> was measured to be higher by qrt-pcr than by the sequencing reads, which may be caused by a lack of sequence depth.figure  <dig>

prediction of novel mirna targets and race validation
a web-based mirna target prediction program was employed to hunt for potential mirna target genes. a total of  <dig> unigene sequences were predicted to be the targets of  <dig> novel mirnas in sd <dig>   <dig> unigene sequences to be the targets of  <dig> novel mirnas in c <dig> and  <dig> unigene sequences to be the targets of  <dig> novel mirnas in ld <dig>  the number of predicted targets varied from  <dig> to  <dig> per mirna and most had three to seven targets. to focus on the biological processes, we predicted the targets of novel mirnas that were specifically expressed in one phase or that had expression changes during the phase transition . although the target genes of some of these mirnas showed distinct functions, a portion of them predicted the target as a single gene or members of a gene family. many of these targets were involved in energy metabolism and solute transport, representing the dramatic metabolism changes between dormancy and active growth. several targets were annotated as nbs resistance protein and leucine rich repeat protein, suggesting the direct response to adverse environment. additional, some novel mirnas targeted cell signaling-related genes, which could lead to expression change of these genes in the annual cycle.table  <dig>

to validate the cleavage events of novel and known mirnas, a modified rna ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cdna ends  experiment was performed to verify the mirna-guided mrna cleavage events. we tested four novel mirnas and two known mirnas to verify their ability to cleave their targets. all of the cleavage sites were located between  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides relative to the 5′end of the complementary mirna sequence, which was the characterized cleavage site of almost all of the known mirnas . the race products of mir <dig> and mir <dig> were cloned and sequenced. their alignments to the poplar genome showed that the targets of mir <dig> and mir <dig> were homologs of the dna-binding transcription factors squamosa promoter binding protein-like  and apetala <dig> , respectively, and the targets of other novel mirnas were identical with the computer prediction in table  <dig> figure  <dig>

discussion
plant mirnas have a wide range of regulatory functions in many biological and metabolic processes, including developmental regulation, cell differentiation, signal transduction, growth control, and biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . although an increasing number of poplar mirnas have been identified in tissues or under certain environmental conditions  <cit> , and some of them have been well characterized to involve various developmental process  <cit> , little is known about the roles of mirnas in the cambium dormancy regulation in trees. we have presented here a comprehensive analysis of srnas in the dormancy-active growth transition at the genome-wide level, which revealed dynamic features of srna populations in the annual growth cycle and expression patterns of mirnas involved in this process. in addition, a set of novel mirnas with notable expression pattern changes was identified. together, these results provide novel insights into the regulatory mechanism of the dormancy-active growth transition mediated by mirnas.

deep sequencing reveals a diverse set of srnas in the cambium of poplar
using high-throughput sequencing technology, we obtained more than  <dig> million unique srnas reads from three cambium samples during the dormancy-active growth transition in poplar. although srnas are complex in composition, the large majority are 21 nt and 24 nt in plants  <cit> , and the proportion of mirnas varies between different species and upon environmental conditions  <cit> . the 24 nt srnas were mainly composed of sirnas associated with repeats and transposons  <cit> . in our case, the srna length distribution patterns diverged during the dormancy-active growth transition. in dormancy, including endodormancy and ecodormancy, the 21 nt long srnas constituted the most abundant class, while in active growth the 24 nt long srnas constituted the most abundant class. we determined the size distributions in previous studies in poplar, and found that the 21 nt srnas were the major component in leaves and vegetable buds  <cit> , while the xylem tissue has a major peak at 24 nt  <cit> , which was in agreement with our data during active growth. we also found that the proportion of total mirnas in dormancy, including both endodormancy and ecodormancy, was greater than that in active growth, which confirmed the induction of the 21 nt mirna by dormancy. the increase in 24 nt srnas during active growth suggested that the 24 nt srnas, which would be mainly sirnas known to guide dna methylation and heterochromatin formation  <cit> , may participate in the regulation of cambium activity, including cell division, cell differentiation and phytohormone regulation. the reversal of 21 nt and 24 nt srna abundance in the dormancy-active growth transition also indicated that these two kinds of srnas may play different roles during the annual growth cycle.

unique expression patterns of mirnas in dormancy-release in poplar
hundreds of mirnas have been surveyed in poplar since next generation sequencing technology has become widely used, but little is known about mirnas in tree dormancy regulation, especially the transition between dormancy and active growth. in this study, we found a series of mirnas that might be involved in this process. for instance, most of the developmental-related mirnas, especially those involved in meristem activity or cell proliferation, presented specific expression patterns. in arabidopsis, increasing evidence shows that mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and their targets form a mirna regulatory network to regulate cell proliferation, leaf development and meristem activity  <cit> . intriguingly, these three mirnas showed similar expression pattern during the endodormancy release process. the increasing expression levels of these three mirnas in active growth suggested that a mirna network regulating cell proliferation also existed in active cambium cells. considering that both cambium and the leaf primordium are capable of cell division, the high level of these three mirnas in active growth is quite reasonable, and the cessation of cell division in dormancy may cause the low abundance of these three mirnas. another mirna that is crucial for vascular development is mir <dig>  which regulates the class iii homeodomain-leucine zipper family of transcription factors. the relationship between mir <dig> and its target is essential for leaf abaxial/adaxial polarity establishment  <cit> . unlike other developmental-related mirnas, mir <dig> was more abundant in dormancy, and had a very low expression level in active growth, which was in agreement with a previous study in poplar  <cit> . these results indicated that mir <dig> was down-regulated in active growth to increase the expression level of its target gene, which had an important role in vascular development. in addition, the original functions of these mirnas were mainly found in the shoot apical meristem or leaves, thus the existence of these mirnas in cambium suggested they may share the same regulatory mechanism in different tissues.

interestingly, mir <dig> was found to be up-regulated in active cambium. the target of mir <dig> was ago <dig>  which was the key regulator of mirna biogenesis  <cit> . the high expression level of mir <dig> leads to the repression of ago <dig>  which causes a reduction in the mirna expression level. as expected, the total mirnas in active growth decreased, indicating that mir <dig> was involved in the mirna biogenesis as a feedback regulator in the cambium stage transition.

mir <dig> and mir <dig> target dna-binding transcription factors spl and ap <dig> genes, respectively, which control the juvenile-to-adult vegetative transition both in annual herbs  <cit>  and woody perennial plants  <cit> . they show converse expression patterns and regulatory relationships during the phase transition  <cit> . surprisingly, the expression levels of mir <dig> and mir <dig> also had opposite expression patterns in our study. the 5′race results confirmed the cleavage events in mir <dig> and mir <dig>  suggesting that the two mirnas were functional during the dormancy-active growth transition. these similar expression patterns suggested the complementary of mir <dig> and mir <dig> might play an important role in this process, which needed to be experimentally confirmed.

auxin-related mirnas may participate in the regulation of endodormancy release
a continuous chilling is the only natural way to release endodormancy and transition to ecodormancy. the main difference between endodormancy and ecodormancy is that ecodormant trees have the ability to respond to growth-promoting signals, such as auxin or appropriate outside conditions. in other words, the chilling triggers the ability of the tree to respond to auxin. in our data, most mirnas had significant expression-level changes between dormancy and active growth, but only a few of them had changes between endodormancy and ecodormancy. among them, mir <dig>  whose target was auxin response factor 10/16/ <dig>   <cit> , was highly expressed in ecodormancy. lu et al. studied the cold-responsive mirnas in poplar by microarray analysis, and showed that ptc-mir160a-g were strongly induced by cold treatment for 12 h, and that this induction disappeared after 16 h of treatment  <cit> . in our case, the chilling lasted 5 weeks, so this high abundance of mir <dig> in ecodormancy may not be due to cold tolerance, but ecodormancy itself. in arabidopsis, mir160’s target genes are negative regulators of auxin signaling  <cit> , so it is possible that the highly expressed mir <dig> may enhance the auxin signal by repressing its targets. the other two auxin-related mirnas, mir <dig> and mir <dig>  increased dramatically during active growth, suggesting that they are involved in the auxin signal pathway during active growth. the results showed that the mirnas mediating the auxin signal pathway had complex regulatory roles in the cambium dormancy phase transition.

novel mirnas and their putative targets during the dormancy-release in poplar
hundreds of novel mirnas as well as their targets were identified in this study. some of them may have important roles in the dormancy-activity transition. for instance, 0a-m0062_3p which had a high expression level in active growth targeted a histone acetyltransferase gene. considering the close link between histone acetylation and gene activation  <cit> , this result suggested that some changes of gene expression in endodormancy could be caused by the regulation of the histone-modifying enzyme by mirnas. additional, one putative target of an active growth-specific novel mirna, a-m0165_5p, was annotated as a homolog of domains rearranged methyltransferase  <dig>  which catalyzes de novo methylation and is responsible for rna-directed dna methylation in arabidopsis  <cit> . together, these findings might suggest a mirna-guided regulation of epigenetic modifications in dormancy and active growth. among dormancy-highly-expression novel mirnas, 0a-m0077_5p, which pairs with an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and 0a-m0149_5p, which matches a plant invertase/pectin methylesterase inhibitor, were also detected, suggesting different protein levels and cell wall components in annual cycle. compared with the higher numbers in active growth and endodormancy, only four novel mirnas with high expression levels in ecodormancy are listed in table  <dig>  among them, 5a-m0010_5p targeted a homolog of the no apical meristem  protein, suggesting that this novel mirna may participate in meristem activity. interestingly, the target of 5a-m0104_3p with the highest expression in ecodormancy was race validated and annotated as a homolog of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, which is an oxidative carboxylase that catalyzes the decarboxylating reduction of 6-phosphogluconate into ribulose 5-phosphate in the presence of nadp. since a previous study showed that the activity of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase underwent a significant change in poplar xylem between winter and summer  <cit> , the high expression level of 5a-m <dig> in ecodormancy may contribute to the physiological change during the transition from endodormancy to active growth. these findings raised the possibility of a regulatory role for mirnas in metabolism and cell signaling, as well as epigenetic changes between dormancy and active growth.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, a genome-wide srna profile of the cambial meristem was performed to present the mirnas involved in the cambial dormancy-active growth transition. as a result,  <dig> known mirnas, comprising  <dig> mirnas families with obvious expression changes, were obtained, which included developmental-, phytohormone-, stress- and physiological-related mirnas. in addition,  <dig> novel mirnas expressed in the cambium were identified, and  <dig> of them displayed unique expression patterns during the dormancy-active growth transition process. the relative expression levels of four novel and two known mirnas were also confirmed by qrt-pcr. we predicted the target genes of these novel mirnas and experimentally validated some of them using 5′race. this revealed not only important known mirnas, which may contribute to the regulation of the dormancy-active growth transition, but also novel mirnas and their possible target genes, which would provide new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of the process in trees.
