BACKGROUND
quantitative trait loci  have been described for a number of economically important traits in cattle  <cit> . previous genetic maps  <cit>  were sufficient to map qtl to broad regions. narrowing those regions to fine-map the qtl, and eventually identify specific genes affecting a trait requires denser genetic maps with markers that can be associated with genes. recently,  <dig> microsatellite markers were added to the bovine genetic map  <cit>  jointly developed by the shirakawa institute of animal genetics  and the united states meat animal research center , reducing the average interval between markers from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm. the updated map provides a tool to refine qtl locations, but, because it predominately represents anonymous markers, provides limited information about genes underlying the qtl. a second-generation radiation hybrid  map of the bovine genome, representing  <dig> gene markers  and  <dig> microsatellite markers that have also been placed on linkage maps has also been described  <cit> . the utility of this gene-rich physical map is limited, however, by relatively sparse connections to genetic markers that can be associated with animal performance. dense genetic and physical maps  are needed to efficiently identify genes, and sequence variation, responsible for phenotypic variation. dense connections between the physical maps and genetic marker maps are also needed, to associate animal phenotypes with the underlying genes and genomic sequence.

recent efforts have added some gene-specific markers to bovine genetic maps. several single-nucleotide polymorphism  markers have been developed to map specific targeted genes  <cit> , or positional candidate genes near qtl  <cit> . seventy snp markers, developed using randomly selected bovine est with human orthologs, were added to the bovine linkage map via twopoint linkage  <cit> . two-point linkages for thirty other est-based snps, selected to refine the comparison of bovine chromosome   <dig> with human chromosome  <dig>  were also obtained  <cit> . the present study extends est-based snp mapping to develop a linkage map representing nearly  <dig> snps throughout the bovine genome. this map will provide a resource for gene-based genome-wide qtl scans and fine-mapping qtl. only a few of the snps added to the linkage map are likely to represent genes directly influencing production. these snp markers will, however, further define comparative relationships between the bovine linkage map and the well-annotated human and model organism genome sequences. these est-based snps may facilitate identification of positional candidate genes that could ultimately affect costs of production and consumer acceptability of meat and milk products.

RESULTS
cattle genotyped for the siag-marc linkage map represent four-breed crosses and backcross families  <cit> . f <dig> dams were produced by mating piedmontese, longhorn or nelore bulls to non-inbred hereford and angus dams. the f <dig> dams were mated to two paternal half-sib gelbvieh × simmental bulls, producing full-sib four-breed cross calves by multiple ovulation embryo transfer . the backcross families were produced by mating a nelore × hereford bull to non-inbred hereford dams, and a brahman × angus bull to non-inbred angus dams, with full-sib backcross calves also produced by moet. this population allows a potential of  <dig> informative meioses for autosomal markers  <cit> .

the current siag-marc bovine linkage maps represent  <dig> markers, with  <dig> markers on autosomes . all of the  <dig> snps on the linkage maps  are assigned to autosomes, including the  <dig> mapped in this work. in addition to the newly developed and mapped snps,  <dig> other markers including  <dig> previously described with two-point positions  <cit>  were added to the multipoint autosomal linkage maps.

e other types include sequence tagged allelic restriction sites , erythrocyte antigens , single strand conformational polymorphisms , serum protein markers , phenotypic observations  and sequence tagged site  markers from previous bovine maps <cit> .

a total of  <dig> snp were identified in this study;  <dig> from est sequences  and  <dig> from bac subclone sequence . one or both of the half-sib bos taurus  sires are heterozygous for 46%  of the snps genotyped in the two sires, and one or both of the bos taurus × bos indicus  sires were heterozygous for 78%  of the snps genotyped . given costs of sequencing and genotyping, not every sire was sequenced or genotyped for every snp. because of an early observation that snp were more prevalent in the bos taurus × bos indicus sires, there was a tendency to examine those bulls first, so the bos taurus sires, progeny and mates may or may not have been genotyped for snps detected in bos indicus cross animals.

eighty percent of the snps developed in this study  were positioned on the linkage maps. the  <dig> unmapped snps include  <dig> that did not have significant two-point linkage  to markers on the  <dig> marc linkage map  <cit> , and  <dig> that were assigned to linkage groups but not placed on the multipoint map because they increased length of the linkage group excessively. a similar percentage of attempted snp were placed on the multipoint swine linkage maps swine using similar genotyping and map construction strategies . unidentified genotyping errors are one possible cause of failure to map markers, both failure to detect significant twopoint linkage and rejecting markers inflating the map. re-genotyping and verifying genotypes by sequencing, however, did not reveal systematic errors with the genotyping system. a more probable cause of individual marker failure may be the limited ability of the software to solve positions for biallelic markers with a small number of informative meioses encompassing a high percentage of like-heterozygote parents and offspring. maps will inflate if a marker is placed incorrectly relative to other markers on the map, and if the most likely placement solvable by crimap  <cit>  results in an inflated map, that marker is rejected rather than allowing it to remain on a potentially distorted map. more correct placements may not be solvable by crimap on 32-bit processors because the computations require more memory than can be addressed by 32-bit processors.

the  <dig> autosome markers  are placed in  <dig> unique positions, with a mean  of  <dig>  cm  between markers. this is only slightly more dense than the maps without these snps  <cit> , which contained  <dig> markers in  <dig> positions covering  <dig> cm on autosomes . the new snp markers occupy  <dig> distinct positions,  <dig> positions only represent these snp and  <dig> are shared with other markers. the mean interval between the new snp markers is  <dig>  cm, with intervals up to  <dig>  cm . each autosome contains at least one gap of  <dig>  or more cm between snp positions. snp markers are spaced evenly along some chromosomes, other chromosomes contain clusters of several snps within a few cm.  total length of the autosomes is  <dig> cm,  <dig> cm longer than the  <dig> microsatellite map  <cit> , and  <dig> cm longer than the  <dig> map  <cit> . the increased length, relative to the  <dig> map, is due to recombinations introduced by new marker genotypes. these apparent recombinations may largely be attributed to incorrect ordering, when possibly more likely orders could not be solved by crimap  <cit> .

adding snp markers resulted in minimal rearrangement of the linkage map. correlations between marker positions on the  <dig>  <cit>  and current maps were near unity  for all autosomes. eighty-nine percent of the markers on autosomes from the  <dig> map remained in the same index position . eight percent were shifted by a single position, and four percent moved by two to five positions. the most substantial shifts were with ambiguously placed markers, which can be included at any one of several positions without affecting map likelihood.

adding est- and bac-based snps substantially increased comparative points defined by alignment of marker sequences against the human genome. human homologues were identified for  <dig> markers, including  <dig> markers from the  <dig> map  <cit> . newly developed snp add  <dig> homologies, and  <dig> are from other markers added to the multipoint maps.

utility of the current map to explore regions of the genome that influence animal performance can be demonstrated by examining the regions surrounding previously described qtl. a region of bta  <dig>  from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm on the  <dig> marc map  <cit> , bounded by microsatellite markers igf- <dig> and bm <dig>  has been associated with preweaning gain  <cit> . allowing for changes in the map, the region defined by these two markers now spans  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm. the two markers are separated by one marker on the  <dig> map. the  <dig> siag-marc map  <cit>  placed nine microsatellites in the region; and the current map shows the same nine microsatellites as well as five snps. the recent bovine rh map  <cit>  contains four gene markers and the bm <dig> microsatellite in the corresponding region, from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cr <dig>  three of the gene markers  were aligned with human chromosome   <dig> sequence, from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mbp. the fourth gene marker  aligned with hsa  <dig> at  <dig>  mbp. sequences associated with linkage markers also align with hsa  <dig> and  <dig>  sequence associated with microsatellite dik <dig> aligns with hsa  <dig> at  <dig>  mbp. sequences containing an snp  and two microsatellites  align with hsa  <dig>  from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mbp. these alignments suggest that the qtl region contains a break in synteny, in agreement with the break described by the bovine rh – human comparative map  <cit> .

agreement in comparative alignments between the current linkage and rh maps suggests either map might be used to identify positional candidate genes underlying this qtl. taken together, information from both maps may provide more complete coverage than that indicated by either map alone. the polymorphic linkage markers will be more useful to identify relationships between marker genotype and phenotype and fine-map the qtl, although further marker development will be necessary to isolate causative polymorphisms.

accuracy of placing snps on the linkage map was a concern, because bi-allelic snps are generally less informative than highly polymorphic microsatellite markers . most markers  with three or more alleles have unambiguous placement, while a single, most likely, position can be determined for only 36% of the bi-allelic markers, and the mean  <dig>  cm three-lod confidence interval for multi-allelic markers is narrower than the  <dig>  cm confidence interval for bi-allelic markers.

discussion
the current linkage map, representing over  <dig> anonymous markers and several hundred gene-specific snps, provides a resource to link genetic variation in animal performance to underlying dna sequence variation. the procedures used to construct this map were designed to allow frequent updates, so new markers can easily be added. the reduction of mean space between markers, from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm, primarily because of recently added microsatellites  <cit> , increases opportunities to fine-map qtl. addition of est-based snps increases connections between the genetic map and gene maps, including currently available bovine rh maps, annotated human and model organism sequence, and eventually bovine sequence  <cit> . these connections may increase efficiency of identifying genes and causal mutations affecting animal performance. where qtl regions can be narrowed, and the regions include markers connecting the region to annotated sequence, the list of positional candidate genes that might partially explain phenotypic variation may be shortened considerably.

the current or future versions of the bovine genetic map will be useful to assemble and validate bovine genomic sequence. the genetic map represents the intact living genome, so it is not subject to cloning and assembly problems associated with other mapping and sequencing techniques  <cit> . however, resolution of the genetic map is limited, and markers that were not separated by recombination in the experimental population cannot be correctly ordered on the linkage map. genetic mapping data can be combined with bovine rh  <cit>  and bac map data  <cit> , exploiting resolution characteristics of both genetic and physical mapping data  <cit>  to obtain a high resolution, well ordered consensus map useful to guide and refine bovine sequence assembly  <cit> , and anchor qtl on the draft sequence  <cit> . even after complete assembly of the bovine genome, the sequence will not replace the genetic map. the genetic map, especially if it is continually updated to represent new snps and other markers, should provide valuable links between phenotypes and associated marker genotypes, in order to identify and exploit genomic variation influencing economically important traits.

CONCLUSIONS
more than  <dig> est- and bac-based snp markers were added to the bovine linkage map. order of previously mapped markers was largely unaffected. the snps increased the density of the map somewhat, and substantially increased connections to gene-rich physical maps, including annotated human sequence. the number of linkage markers with human homologues was more than doubled by addition of these snp and other markers. the map provides a resource for fine-mapping quantitative trait loci and identification of positional candidate genes, and can be integrated with other data to guide and refine assembly of bovine genome sequence. the map can easily be updated with a cyclic map construction process, and it will continue to be a useful resource connecting observable phenotypes and animal genotypes to underlying genes and molecular mechanisms influencing economically important beef and dairy traits.
