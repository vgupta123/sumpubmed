BACKGROUND
macrophages are efficient phagocytes of the immune system that produce reactive oxygen species  during the phagocytosis of pathogens, considered as a marker of cell activation. the well-established classical pathway of macrophage activation induced by interferon -γ and/or lipopolysaccharide  is known to play a vital role in host defence during inflammation. macrophages activated in this manner express high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates that are crucial in the defence against intracellular pathogens  <cit> . the ap- <dig> transcription factor plays a key role in regulating cell growth and environmental stress responses  <cit> . in classically activated  macrophages, ap- <dig> plays a central role together with nf-κb in signal-dependant gene expression that is crucial for innate immunity  <cit> . jund is a member of ap- <dig> that is constitutively expressed and has been previously shown to protect cells from oxidative stress and to reduce tumour angiogenesis by limiting the production of ros  <cit> . the chronic oxidative stress generated by the inactivation of jund, has been shown to promote aging and increase tumour development  <cit> . in various tissues, including the kidney, the absence of jund led to the over-expression of hypoxia inducible factor -target genes in podocytes, most likely as a result of increased oxidative stress  <cit> .

wistar kyoto  rats are uniquely susceptible to nephrotoxic nephritis , a rat model of crescentic glomerulonephritis   <cit> . the macrophages of this strain show a 20-fold increase in jund mrna expression as well as increased specific jund protein binding to ap- <dig> consensus sequence nucleotides  when compared with the ntn-resistant lew strain  <cit> . in addition wky bmdms show greater superoxide anion production when stimulated with pma  and significantly increased nos <dig> expression  <cit>  when stimulated with lps, suggesting that the macrophages of this strain have a genetically determined pro-inflammatory phenotype characterised by increased oxidative stress. we have previously shown that jund is a determinant of the macrophage oxidative burst associated with crescentic glomerulonephritis. in a genome-wide linkage analysis and haplotype analysis for ntn-related phenotypes in wky and lew rats, we delineated a minimal genomic region of  <dig> kb on rat chromosome  <dig> where jund was the only markedly over-expressed transcript. the functional role of jund was established by sirna knock-down of jund in wky bmdms  <cit>  which resulted in reduced fc receptor mediated oxidative burst confirming the previously reported antioxidant role of jund in other tissues  <cit> . furthermore, the role of jund in tlr4-induced primary human macrophage activation was established. sirna knockdown of jund in these cells resulted in a significantly reduced secretion of tnfα, il- <dig> and il- <dig>  <cit> . one possible mechanism for this was suggested by smolinska and colleagues who showed that hck kinase mediates tlr4-induced transcription of both tnf and il- <dig> through binding of ap- <dig> heterodimers composed of c-fos and jund  <cit> . based on these results, we hypothesised that jund controls respiratory burst and the related oxidative stress in basal and classically activated  macrophages.

to identify genes and pathways regulated by jund-mediated macrophage activation in wky bmdms, we have carried out microarray-based gene expression studies following sirna knock down of jund in basal and lps-stimulated conditions. chip-seq analysis was performed on basal and lps-stimulated wky bmdms and used to complement the microarray results in order to identify primary jund targets. chip-seq and microarray analyses were also carried out in a jund congenic strain  known to have reduced jund mrna and protein levels  <cit> . in this strain, the jund locus was transferred from the lewis strain into the wky strain by back-crossing over nine generations. genome-wide integration of all datasets identified primary jund-target genes and a regulatory network involved in oxidative stress and il-1β expression in macrophages leading to increases in mature il-1β production in bmdms and glomeruli from the wky strain.

RESULTS
jund regulates macrophage gene expression that controls primarily oxidative stress and il-1β synthesis
a description of the macrophage function related to different levels of jund expression in different inbred rat is summarised in table  <dig>  in order to identify genes under the transcriptional control of jund in primary macrophages, expression levels of jund were first silenced by rna interference in the wky bmdms that over-express jund   <cit> . following confirmation of knockdown by qrt-pcr and western blot , the samples were subjected to microarray analysis . because ap1/jund regulates lipopolysaccharide -tlr <dig> mediated cytokine secretion in primary human macrophages  <cit> , microarray analysis was also performed in samples treated with jund sirna  and stimulated with lps for  <dig> h . genome-wide analysis of the bmdm transcriptome identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes between unstimulated bmdms transfected with jund sirna compared to scrambled control and  <dig>  differentially expressed genes following  <dig> hours of lps  stimulation . jund acted both as an activator and as a repressor of gene expression in bmdms. transfection of wky bmdms with jund sirna, thereby lowering jund expression, resulted in the reduced expression of  <dig> genes out of  <dig>  demonstrating that jund had an activatory role in gene transcription. alongside this, jund knockdown also increased the expression of  <dig> genes  demonstrating that jund could also have a repressive effect on transcription. after eight hours of lps stimulation,  <dig> genes had reduced expression in the jund sirna knockdown group compared to controls and  <dig> genes demonstrated higher expression following jund knockdown. validation by qrt-pcr of a set of differentially expressed genes following jund sirna knock-down that encompassed a range of fold change differences between the two sirna groups confirmed the microarray findings  in  <dig> out of the  <dig>  genes selected. the directional change  of the microarray data was confirmed in all  <dig> genes.

amongst the genes showing the most marked expression changes following jund sirna knock-down in wky bmdms,  <dig> genes were found to have greater than threefold differences in expression between the two sirna groups  in the unstimulated state and  <dig> genes were identified in the lps stimulated state . interestingly, the individual functions of the majority of these genes belong to two main categories: oxidative stress  and il-1β synthesis . this suggests that jund has a primary role in regulating macrophage gene expression associated with oxidative stress and il-1β synthesis. to investigate this further, we performed genome-wide expression analysis by microarrays over an eight hour time course of lps stimulation in wky and wky.lcrgn <dig> bmdms . the latter is a jund congenic strain generated by introgression of the jund locus on chromosome  <dig> from the lewis donor onto the wky recipient genome. wky.lcrgn <dig> rats have significantly less jund mrna and jund protein levels in their bmdms when compared with parental wky bmdms . the microarray results between the wky and wky.lcrgn <dig> bmdms identified that  <dig> genes were differentially expressed over the eight hour timecourse. they were functionally associated with multiple immune terms focused on responses to stimuli including lps and the regulation of cell activation  and were validated by qrt-pcr . a set of  <dig> genes that were common with the jund sirna knockdown was identified. amongst these, seven transcripts showed a fold change greater than  <dig>  including metallothionein 2a , arginase  and cysteine dioxygenase, type  <dig> , genes associated with oxidative stress. the significant differential expression of these transcripts together with jund between wky and wky.lcrgn <dig> bmdms was confirmed by qrt-pcr . taken together the combined rnai and congenic whole genome differential expression analysis identifies genes primarily regulating oxidative stress and il-1β synthesis under transcriptional control of jund.

differentially expressed transcripts with greater than three-fold difference in expression  were identified at a <5% fdr threshold following  <dig>  permutations. fold changes are of control sirna versus jund sirna expression. a positive fold change indicates higher expression in bmdms transfected with scrambled control sirna i.e. with a higher level of jund expression compared to jund sirna. abbreviations: chr.; chromosome, fdr: false discovery rate.

jund expression levels determine the extent of the jund cistromes
we next combined our microarray approaches investigating jund-mediated transcriptional control of genes with a cistrome analysis of jund between basal and two hour lps stimulated wky and wky.lcrgn <dig> bmdms using chip-seq . the aligned sequencing reads  were analysed using bayespeak  <cit>  in order to identify areas of sequencing enrichment that signified jund-binding events, termed peaks. this analysis identified a greater number of peaks in wky basal and lps-stimulated bmdms compared to wky.lcrgn <dig> bmdms in both conditions . peaks were linked to a gene if they were located within  <dig> kilobases of the transcriptional start site or were located within the gene body. this meant that genetically determined differences in jund levels resulted in an almost 50% reduction in the number of chip-seq peaks that were linked to a protein coding gene in the basal state and an 87% reduction after lps stimulation . fourteen peaks were successfully validated by chip-qpcr in wky bmdms with all the peaks showing at least two-fold enrichment for jund above background . the reduced level of jund expression in the wky.lcrgn <dig> strain was reflected in the lower levels of enrichment for the seven peaks analysed . the majority of chip-seq peaks in all the strains were located in intergenic regions  whilst the wky bmdms had a higher proportion of jund peaks within the body of the gene  compared to wky.lcrgn <dig> bmdms in both the unstimulated and lps stimulated states . the distance from the nearest gene to each peak was calculated and peaks were found to be preferentially located close to the tss in both strains . de novo motif discovery using homer identified a  <dig> base pair motif in 63% of peaks in wky lps stimulated bmdms with a strong similarity to the consensus ap- <dig> motif that has been previously recognised and shown to be functionally active  <cit>  . additional motifs identified included cac binding and rest/nrsf in basal wky bmdms  and the ascl <dig>  caccc binding motif for klf factors, eomes and ets  in lps stimulated wky bmdms. furthermore the jund binding to the promoters of il1b and prkca, two of the most markedly differentially expressed transcripts following jund sirna were confirmed by chip-qpcr in both the basal and lps stimulated conditions 

peaks were identified using bayespeak v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  using a posterior probability threshold of  <dig> . peaks were linked to a gene if they were located within  <dig> kilobases of the transcriptional start site or were located within the body of the gene.

gene ontology analysis of the jund-bound genes in the different strains and states identified marked similarities between the enriched terms in basal wky bmdms  and wky.lcrgn <dig> bmdms  as well as lps stimulated wky.lcrgn <dig> bmdms  covering multiple autoimmune disease pathways and core macrophage functions such as antigen processing. this suggested that regardless of expression level, jund binds to genes involved in core macrophage processes. following lps stimulation in wky bmdms enrichment was seen for immune processes linked with the response of the macrophage to stimulation such as intracellular signalling cascades and the mapk signalling pathway  highlighting the role played by jund in the lps response.

integration of microarray and chip-seq datasets identifies primary jund targets in macrophages
in order to identify the set of primary jund targets, we integrated all the genomic datasets and identified the genes that correlated closely with the expression pattern of jund during the lps timecourse that were also differentially expressed following sirna knockdown of jund and showed a chip-seq peak in wky bmdms. this identified two major networks  with  <dig> genes in the basal state  and  <dig> genes after lps stimulation  as primary jund targets through which jund mediates its effect on macrophage activation. the primary jund targets correlate with jund expression levels in two independent datasets  and have a jund chip-seq peak in wky bmdms. these are genes where the expression is under direct control of jund/ap <dig> binding, correlating with cellular jund levels. the transcription factor runx <dig> was identified as primary jund targets together with several genes involved in oxidative stress such as trpv <dig>  vav <dig>  ifi <dig>  nqo <dig>  and p2ry <dig>  ctnnb <dig> and bcl2l <dig> additional file 1: figure s5).

jund expression levels determine active il-1β secretion in primary macrophages and nephritic glomeruli
since the previous role of jund is regulating macrophage oxidative burst is known  <cit>  and our data shows that jund regulates genes involved in il-1β synthesis , we investigated whether jund regulates active il-1β secretion following nlrp3-inflammasome activation in primary rat macrophages. western blot analysis of mature il-1β in bmdms primed with lps and activated by atp demonstrated a reduction in mature il-1β between wky and wky.lcrgn <dig> bmdms . importantly, there was a marked increase in mature il-1β production in lew.wcrgn <dig> bmdms compared to lew confirming that the jund congenic interval was able to alter mature il-1β production . these results were confirmed by elisa for il-1β in lps primed and atp stimulated bmdms which showed significant differences between the production of il-1β by wky bmdms compared to wky.lcrgn <dig> and lew bmdms . the production of il-1β in nephritic glomeruli from wky, wky.lcrgn <dig>  lew and lew.wcrgn <dig> rats was examined . this showed a significant reduction in il-1β production in all the other strains compared to wky demonstrating a role for the crgn <dig> congenic interval in il-1β production.

discussion
the aim of the present study was to investigate genes regulated by jund mediating macrophage oxidative burst and pro-inflammatory cytokine production leading to enhanced cell activation in the wky rat. we used combined microarray and jund/ap <dig> chip-seq analyses in primary bmdms from wky  and congenic wky.lcrgn <dig>  rats. microarray analysis was performed in two experimental settings: following jund sirna knockdown using lipid-based transfection in wky bmdms and between wky and wky.lcrgn <dig> primary macrophages. chip-seq analysis was also performed between wky and wky.lcrgn <dig> bmdms in order to identify primary jund targets. microarray and chip-seq experiments were also performed in macrophages activated with lps to assess the role of jund in macrophages activated through lps/tlr <dig> 

jund reduces tumour angiogenesis by limiting ras-mediated production of reactive oxygen species  implicated in the pathophysiology of various diseases, including cancer , regulates genes involved in antioxidant defence and enhances the transcription of vegf-a, a potent proangiogenic factor  <cit> . in addition jund deficient mice display persistent hyperinsulinaemia resulting from enhanced pancreatic islet vascularization owing to chronic oxidative stress  <cit> . in crescentic glomerulonephritis jund deficiency may cause increased oxidative stress in the glomerular podocytes, leading to altered vegfa expression and subsequent glomerular injury  <cit> . in the rat ntn model of crgn, reduced jund expression in the congenic wky.lcrgn <dig> strain is associated with 11% reduction in glomerular crescent formation  <cit> . we have carried out a combined chip-seq and transcriptome approach in macrophages, the main effector cells of crgn, in order to identify jund targets that may explain its modulatory role. alongside a general effect by jund to alter the immune response to lps in the overall gene sets, the functions of strongly dysregulated  expression changes suggested that primary gene targets of jund are key effectors in mediating protection from oxidative stress and il-1β synthesis. interestingly, this approach identified genes regulating oxidative stress that were previously identified to be under the regulation of jund in fibroblasts  suggesting that jund may have common targets in the oxidative stress pathway in different cell types. jund regulates il-1β secretion in rat bmdms and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in human monocyte-derived macrophages  <cit>  suggesting that its role of the regulation of the m <dig> macrophage activation is conserved across the species. taken together these observations suggest that jund regulates oxidative stress various diseases with both common and cell specific targets.

current understanding of jund function on a genome wide scale has been limited by studies performed on a candidate gene or promoter basis  <cit> . the encyclopaedia of dna elements  project has carried out chip-seq for jund in human transformed cell lines though not in a macrophage or monocyte cell lines  <cit> . jund has been categorised as a middle-level transcription factor and such factors regulate information-flow bottlenecks and may be the best therapeutic targets for strongly affecting the flow of information through regulatory circuits  <cit> . the cistrome of jund was also found to be highly context and cell type specific  <cit> . we used primary macrophages from two inbred rat strains expressing different amounts of jund in a comparative chip-seq analysis to identify the genomic regions uniquely bound by jund. the overall landscape of jund binding in the bmdms from wky and wky.lcrgn <dig> bmdms was comparable to that of other transcription factors studied in primary macrophages stimulated by lps  <cit> . we found that after lps stimulation in wky bmdms, there was enrichment for genes involved in multiple immune processes linked with responses to multiple different stimuli. in combination with the gene expression data, these findings suggest that genetically determined up-regulation of jund expression resulted in enhanced macrophage activation in the wky strain.

de novo motif analysis identified additional transcription factor motifs that were unique to the wky strain suggesting that the increased levels of jund expression facilitated new partnerships with other transcription factors that did not occur in wky.lcrgn <dig> bmdms. key findings included the caccc-binding domain which binds krüppel-like family  transcription factors and are regulators of signalling following activation of macrophages  <cit>  and the ets- <dig> motif, a factor controlling the expression of cytokine and chemokine genes in a wide variety of cells  <cit>  in lps stimulated wky bmdms. in basal wky bmdms a rest-nrsf motif was identified consistent with the functional findings of neuron development and differentiation in unique core jund-bound genes in wky bmdms and potential roles for jund in excitoxic neuronal cell death and ischaemic injury  <cit> .

the main goal of the study was to identify primary jund target genes responsible for the macrophage activation seen in crgn-susceptible wky rat. the sirna knockdown experiments identified that genes with the greatest changes in expression were associated with il-1β synthesis. the transcriptional control of il1b expression by jund was further confirmed by investigating il-1β secretion upon inflammasome activation in the wky and reciprocal jund congenic strain bmdms and nephritic glomeruli . our integrative analysis identified primary jund targets through which jund could primarily regulate macrophage activation. in the basal state multiple targets have links with oxidative stress including trpv <dig> <cit> , vav <dig> <cit> , ifi <dig> <cit> , nqo <dig> <cit>  and p2ry <dig> <cit> . this was also seen after lps stimulation with transcripts such as ctnnb <dig> <cit>  and bcl2l <dig> <cit>  highlighting the key role of jund in the regulation of oxidative stress in wky bmdms. moreover, the transcription factor runx <dig>  has been identified as a primary jund target suggesting that novel transcription factor interactions in macrophages may underlie some jund-mediated macrophage activation.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together our data show that genetically determined differences in physiological levels of jund affect its genome-wide binding patterns in basal and lps-stimulated primary macrophages. these results identified transcriptional programs underlying jund-mediated oxidative stress and il-1β synthesis in primary macrophages which may play a role in susceptibility to crgn.
