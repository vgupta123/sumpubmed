BACKGROUND
the persistent division of neural progenitor cells  and the production of new neurons in the adult brain raise hope for potential therapies targeting the npcs to compensate for neuronal loss in injured or disease brains. this process of continual neuron production, also known as adult neurogenesis, occurs in discrete brain regions that include the subgranular zone  of the dentate gyrus, the subventricular zone  of the lateral ventricle, and the rostral migratory stream  which is the rostral extension of the svz  <cit> . previous studies have detected increased npc proliferation under pathological conditions, and the neural precursor cells generated were recruited to the affected brain regions  <cit> . to develop effective strategies that harness the npcs as a renewable source for repair, it will be necessary to understand how neurogenesis is regulated in the mature brain.

there have been considerable advances in knowledge concerning the regulation of adult neurogenesis over the past two decades  <cit> . adult neurogenesis is a multifactorial process that encompasses several stages including proliferation, migration, and then the differentiation and survival of new neurons. each stage is dynamically regulated by both extrinsic and intrinsic factors  <cit> . regulation at early stages of neurogenesis, most notably the proliferation of npcs, is especially complex as a wide range of extracellular factors, stimuli, transcription factors, and epigenetic modifiers have been identified  <cit> . a number of morphogens including wnt, notch, sonic hedgehog, and ephrins have also been shown to regulate cell proliferation in the adult svz  <cit> . external stimuli such as age, exercise, sleep, and stress have been shown to influence npc proliferation  <cit> . to control the proliferative behaviour of npcs, these extrinsic factors must act on an intrinsic system where pro- and anti- proliferative genes are differentially regulated to provide instructions to the npcs on the appropriate time and frequency to divide. the genetic basis of npc proliferation, however, is not fully understood.

it has also been previously shown that adult neurogenesis is significantly dependent on the genetic background, and the genetic diversity among inbred strains can serve as a reservoir for gene discovery  <cit> . a wide range of differences in the number of proliferative npc has been quantified in the rms of nine inbred strains  and  <dig> axb/bxa recombinant inbred  strains derived from the initial mating of c57bl/6 j and a/j mice  <cit> . genome-wide mapping of strain differences in rms cell proliferation using the axb/bxa panel led to the identification of a significant quantitative trait locus  on distal chromosome   <dig> that accounts for ~20% of the phenotypic differences observed among the strains  <cit> . from this earlier work, we suspected the involvement of more than one locus in regulating npc proliferation. therefore, in order to fully appreciate the complexity of this process, we explored a separate genetic reference panel called the bxds. the bxds is one of the largest murine mapping panel consists of  <dig> unique bxd ri strains, which is three times the size of the axb/bxa resource. the bxd ri strains were derived from an initial mating between c57bl/ 6 j and dba/2 j that was followed by inbreeding f <dig> progeny for ≥ <dig> generations. the substantial differences in cell proliferation in the rms of the bxd ri strains allowed us to detect additional qtls that modulate npc proliferation. functional annotation and gene expression analyses using pre-existing transcriptome data highlighted a subset of candidate genes in the mapped chromosomal regions. common features shared by these candidate genes include expression in the rms, functional implication in cell proliferation/cell cycle progression, and participation in signalling pathways important for neurogenesis. these findings provide insights into the dynamic interplay of genetic loci and underlying genes that may modulate npc proliferation in the adult brain.

RESULTS
significant strain-differences in rms cell proliferation among the bxds
a substantial range of cell proliferation in the rms, as detected by the uptake of brdu, was identified in  <dig> bxd ri strains, with a 3-fold difference among the strains . this range extends beyond the differences detected between the two parental strains, c57bl/6 j and dba/2 j . significant inter-strain differences in rms linear density was detected , and heritability of cell proliferation in the rms is estimated to be  <dig>  .

there is no significant sex effect  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; females =  <dig>  ±  <dig> ; males =  <dig>  ±  <dig> ) or body weight effect  on the number of proliferative cells in the rms. we also examined the batch effect as the bxd panel has three epoch substructures: i) bxd 1– <dig> generated by benjamin a. taylor in the 1970s  <cit> , ii) bxd 33– <dig> generated by benjamin a. taylor in the late 1990s  <cit> , and iii) bxd 43– <dig> generated by peirce and colleagues in the early 2000s  <cit> . no significant batch effect on rms linear density was detected . however, age had a significant effect on rms linear density .

we also correlated our rms linear density data to  <dig> traits previously generated using the bxd ri reference panel. rms linear density  is significantly associated with traits from other brain regions such as the hippocampal volume , dentate gyrus volume , hippocampus granule cell number , dorsal striatum volume , and striatal neuron number . these phenotypic correlations suggest common genetic determinants underlying rms cell proliferation and other traits.

qtls regulating npc proliferation in the rms
to gain insights into the complex genetics regulating adult npc proliferation, we performed qtl analysis for the differences in rms linear density among the bxd ri strains. we discovered a highly significant locus on chr  <dig>  and a suggestive locus on chr  <dig>  that modulate npc numbers in the rms . since age had a significant effect on rms linear density, we regressed the rms linear density for each animal against age to ensure the observed genotype-phenotype association is not confounded by differences in age. qtl mapping of the adjusted rms linear density identified the same significant and suggestive qtls on chr  <dig> and chr  <dig>  respectively . separate qtl analyses were also performed to confirm that mapping results are not confounded by strain epochs. qtl mapping of the old  bxd strains and the new  bxd strains both identified the same significant qtl on chr  <dig>  which again demonstrate the robustness of the chr  <dig> qtl .

we used marker regression analysis to estimate the allelic effect sizes of the mapped qtls. the genotype of single-nucleotide polymorphism  and microsatellite markers underlying the chr  <dig> qtl revealed that the c57bl/6 j allele is associated with ~ <dig> brdu + cells/mm increase in rms cell proliferation compared with having a dba/2 j allele. conversely, genetic markers in the chr  <dig> qtl region showed that a dba/2 j allele has an additive effect of ~ <dig> brdu + cells/mm compared with having a c57bl/6 j allele. these findings suggest the complex genetic modulation of npc proliferation with the involvement of more than one qtl.

composite interval analysis revealed secondary intervals on chr  <dig>  and chr  <dig>  work additively with the chr  <dig> qtl in modulated npc proliferation in the rms . one-way anova confirmed the allelic effects of the chr  <dig> , chr  <dig> , and chr  <dig>  on rms proliferation.

pair-scan analysis was performed to assess two-way interaction between pairs of genetic markers from different chromosomes. once again, we found significant association of markers in chr  <dig> qtl with markers in the secondary chr  <dig> and chr  <dig> intervals . to further assess the type of interaction among these loci , the bxd strains were split into groups according to their genotypes at these qtl intervals, and an average rms linear density was calculated for each group. the plotted rms linear densities show how different allele combinations at these loci are associated with different levels of rms linear density . the major effect of the chr  <dig> qtl is demonstrated where strains carrying the c57bl/6 j allele in the chr  <dig> interval are associated with higher rms linear densities compared to having the dba/2 j allele, irrespective of the genotypes at the chr <dig> or chr <dig> qtl intervals. when the genotypes at these secondary qtl regions are taken into account, having the c57bl/6 j allele at either the chr  <dig>  or chr  <dig> intervals  are associated with even higher rms linear densities compared to having the dba/2 j alleles. the c57bl/6 j alleles in the chr  <dig> and chr  <dig> qtl regions are respectively associated with ~ <dig> brdu + cells/mm and ~ <dig> brdu + cells/mm increase in rms cell proliferation compared with having dba/2 j alleles. these findings suggest the major chr  <dig> qtl works additively with loci on chr  <dig> and  <dig> when modulating npc proliferation in the rms.

mapped loci harbour genes that may serve as modulators of npc proliferation
we predict the mapped genomic regions harbours genes regulating the number of proliferative npcs in the rms. to test our hypothesis, we implemented a combination of bioinformatics tools including qtlminer at genenetwork  and david  to obtain information on genes in the qtl regions. we prioritized genes according to 1) the presence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms  and/or insertion/deletions, 2) expression of the gene in the rms neuroblast transcriptome, 3) presence of transcripts in other neurogenic regions  in the adult mouse brain, and 4) association with gene ontology  terms such as neurogenesis, cell cycle, or proliferation. in the significant chr  <dig> qtl region  there are  <dig> genes that have known or predicted functions but only  <dig> genes met all our criteria . two of these genes, transforming growth factor alpha  and minichromosome maintenance deficient  <dig> mitotin  have been implicated in adult neurogenesis  <cit> . pathway analysis showed tgfa to be involved in the erbb signalling pathway, which regulates diverse biological processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and survival. whole genome mapping and composite interval analyses also revealed secondary qtls influencing cell proliferation in the rms. to determine whether these suggestive loci interact with the major chr  <dig> locus at the molecular level, we further examined the candidate genes residing in the suggestive qtls. in the suggestive chr  <dig> qtl region ,  <dig> genes have known/predicted functions and three genes met our candidate gene criteria . one of the candidate genes is secreted acidic cysteine rich glycoprotein  which has been previously shown to promote cell proliferation in the sgz of the dentate gyrus  <cit> . in the chr  <dig> qtl region , which was revealed through composite interval mapping, there are  <dig> genes with known/predicted functions and  <dig> of these met all the criteria listed above: cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor  <dig>  and glucosamine-phosphate n-acetyltransferase  <dig> . despite not being directly linked to neurogenesis, both of these genes regulate cell cycle progression  <cit> . in the chr  <dig> qtl region , there are  <dig> genes that have known/predicted functions. five genes met all of our candidate gene criteria . one of these genes, smad family member  <dig>  has been directly implicated in adult neurogenesis  <cit> . pathway analyses revealed the gene calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii alpha  in chr  <dig> qtl is involved in the erbb signalling pathway, a pathway also shared by tgfa in the major chr  <dig> qtl. camk2a also participates in the wnt signalling pathway. two other genes ppp2ca in the suggestive chr  <dig> qtl and smad <dig> in the chr  <dig> qtl are also components of the wnt signaling machinery. these signalling pathways identified from our analyses have been shown to regulate npc proliferation in the adult brain  <cit> .

co-expression of candidate genes further revealed pathway dynamics
we further explored the interconnectivity of the candidate genes based on their expression level in the adult brain. we suspect polymorphisms in these candidate genes are likely to affect gene expression level, similar to the heritable differences in number of rms proliferative cells observed among the bxd. since there is no rms transcriptome data available for the bxds, we used the bxd hippocampal microarray data available at the genenetwork  to investigate expression co-variation among our candidate genes. the hippocampal transcriptome was selected based on findings from our earlier phenotypic correlation analysis where cell proliferation in the rms is significantly associated with several hippocampal traits including hippocampus and dentate gyrus volumes and dentate gyrus granule cell number. the transcripts levels of each candidate genes were extracted from the bxd hippocampal expression database. a network graph  was then generated showing how the expression of the candidate genes residing in different loci positively or negatively correlated with each other. we found genes participating in cell proliferation exhibited similar expression levels where gfpt <dig>  is highly correlated with the expression of two other candidate genes, sparc  and ppp2ca . ppp2ca, which is involved in the wnt signalling pathway, is also significantly correlated with camk2a in the chr  <dig> qtl . this finding is consistent with the general assumption that genes in the same pathway exhibit similar gene expression profiles  <cit> . in addition to gene expression covariance, we also detected significant correlation between gene expression and the phenotype . the expression of candidate genes anxa <dig> , ppp2ca , gnpnat <dig> , and camk2a  varied across the different bxd strains, and their transcriptional differences are significantly correlated with the phenotypic differences in rms linear density observed among the bxds .

cell proliferation in the sgz is regulated by a different set of qtls
the high correlation between the rms linear density and the hippocampal traits such as volume and cell numbers, which harbours the sgz of the dentate gyrus, led us to suspect common genetic determinants underlying these two neurogenic sites. we first assessed cell proliferation in the sgz one-hour post brdu injection. similar to what was observed in the rms, the number of brdu + cells in the sgz significantly differs among the bxd ri strains  . heritability of cell proliferation in the sgz is estimated to be  <dig>  . the number of brdu + cells in the sgz was  <dig>  fold higher in c57bl/6 j compared to dba/2 j, which was opposite to the parental strain differences observed in the rms. however this reversal in phenotypic direction was not observed in the bxd ri panel. for example, bxd <dig> had both high numbers of brdu + cells in the rms and sgz. whereas, bxd <dig> had low numbers of brdu + cells in the rms and sgz.

the effects of confounding variables on cell proliferation in the sgz were also examined. age had a significant effect on the number of brdu + cells in the sgz . strain epoch, sex, body weight differences did not significantly influence the number of proliferative cells in the sgz.

qtl mapping of cell proliferation in the adult sgz revealed suggestive qtls on chr  <dig> , chr  <dig> , and chr  <dig>  and no significant qtl was identified . qtl mapping of sgz proliferation corrected for differences in age revealed the same suggestive qtls on chr  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . these sgz qtls do not correspond to the loci associated with cell proliferation in the rms and therefore suggest a different set of genetic modulators regulating the number of proliferative cells in the sgz. this is further supported by the lack of phenotypic correlation between cell proliferation in the sgz and rms .

discussion
adult neurogenesis is a multi-stage process that is complex in terms of regulation as each stage is modulated by different genetic and environmental factors  <cit> . the earliest phase of adult neurogenesis is the proliferation of the npcs in the adult sgz, svz, and rms. npc proliferation is highly heritable and dependent on the genetic background. the effects of genetic variations on npc proliferation is likely through a network of genes which will be difficult to reveal from conventional single gene study. here, we used a systems genetics approach where we correlate genetic variation and expression data to npc proliferation in the adult mouse brain. we took advantage of the genetic and phenotypic diversity in the bxd reference panel, and through genome-wide qtl mapping, we discovered novel genetic loci that likely house modulators of npc proliferation in the rms. a closer examination of candidate genes in the mapped loci  identified a subset of genes associated with adult neurogenesis and/or cell proliferation. we further demonstrated interconnectivity among some of these candidate genes by showing they co-vary at the transcriptional level and participate in the same pathways previously shown to control adult neurogenesis.

to probe the genetic architecture of a polygenic phenotype as complex as npc proliferation requires a large genetic reference panel that can provide high resolution and power to identify genes with subtle but significant effects on npc proliferation. in this study, we utilized the genetic diversity among the bxd ri strains as a tool to identify genes and pathways involved in npc proliferation. our bxd panel of  <dig> strains is the largest mapping panel employed thus far to study adult neurogenesis, and it is over twice the size the axb/bxa ri set we have previously examined  <cit> . in addition, over half of the bxds in our panel  were from the more recent uthsc bxd set, which have approximately twice the number of recombinations per strain compared to the older bxd subset produced by taylor. these features of our bxd panel improved the statistical power to map qtls at high resolution as well as uncover loci-loci interaction. normal distribution of the rms linear densities in the bxd genetic reference panel indicates that more than one genetic locus is involved in npc proliferation. subsequent genome-wide interval mapping provided novel insights into the genetic regions regulating npc proliferation. a significant chr  <dig> qtl was identified to account for 19% of the inter-strain differences, and this locus was found to interact additively with two other genomic regions on chr  <dig> and chr  <dig>  pairwise interaction between chr  <dig> qtl and these secondary loci explained ~40% of the inter-strain differences. genome-wide mapping also revealed a suggestive locus on chr  <dig> that accounts for ~11% of the phenotypic variance in the bxd population and it does not directly interact with the chr  <dig> qtl. the identification of interacting and non-interacting genetic loci suggests the genetic network modulating npc proliferation is comprised of regulatory pathways of variable interactivity.

to better understand the regulatory pathways modulating npc proliferation in the rms, we needed to first identify the molecular players participating in these pathways. it is presumed that the mapped loci harbor genetic modifiers of npc proliferation. our rather stringent candidate gene analyses revealed several genes in the significant chr  <dig> qtl regions that are associated with neurogenesis and cell proliferation. one of them is tgfa, which is a growth factor that binds to the epidermal growth factor receptors . upon binding to its receptor, tgfa activates the erbb signalling pathway and subsequently triggers the mitogen-activated protein kinase  signalling cascade. these pathways play crucial roles in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. the absence of tgfa resulted in attenuation of npc proliferation in the dorsolateral corner of lateral ventricles and reduction of newborn neurons in the ob  <cit> . another candidate gene implicated in adult neurogenesis is mcm <dig>  this gene encodes for a component of the dna replication machinery for the s phase of cell cycle. mcm <dig> has been used as a proliferation marker in adult svz and hippocampal neurogenesis  <cit> . hypomorphic expression of mcm <dig> resulted in decreased npc proliferation in the svz  <cit> . in addition to genes in the chr  <dig> region, genes in the suggestive qtl regions also harbour promising candidates that have been previously implicated in adult neurogenesis. one of which is sparc in the chr  <dig> qtl. sparc encodes a cysteine-rich acidic matrix-associated protein, which is involved in extracellular matrix synthesis, regulation of cell shape, and cellular response to growth factor stimulus. sparc also affects hippocampal neurogenesis with the knockout of sparc resulting in decreased cell proliferation in the sgz of the dentate gyrus  <cit> . smad <dig> in the suggestive chr  <dig> qtl has been directly implicated in adult neurogenesis  <cit> . smad <dig> encodes for a signal transduction protein that participates in the bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathway, wnt signaling pathway, and the transforming growth factor beta  signaling pathway. conditional knockout of smad <dig> in the svz neural stem cells greatly impaired neuron production in the ob and induced ectopic oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum  <cit> .

candidate gene pathway analysis further provided insights into the interconnection among the candidate genes. both the tgfa gene in the major chr  <dig> qtl and the camk2a gene in the secondary chr  <dig> qtl are involved in the erbb signalling pathway, which regulates diverse biological processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and survival. tgfa serves as one of the extracellular ligands that bind to epidermal growth factor receptors and subsequently triggers downstream intracellular signalling pathways, which is modulated by camk2a. camk2a also participates in the wnt signalling pathway as well as ppp2ca in the suggestive chr  <dig> qtl. ppp2ca is one of the major ser/thr phosphatases which has been previously implicated as a negative regulator of cell proliferation. ppp2ca interacts with axin, a scaffold protein that down-regulates the wnt signalling pathway by destabilizing β-catenin  <cit> . these findings highlight the complexity of npc regulation where genes at different loci converge on the same regulatory pathway and possibly exert their effects in an additive manner. overlap in genes participating in seemingly independent pathways such as erbb signalling pathway and wnt signalling pathways further suggests crosstalk between these pathways. previous reviews have described the regulation of adult neurogenesis as a fine balance of the different systems of networks  <cit> . the interconnectedness between pathways indicates that the perturbation of one may trigger compensatory changes at others  <cit> .

the interconnectivity among candidate genes is further reflected at the transcriptional level. because there is no bxd transcriptome data available for the rms, we probed the hippocampal gene expression database for the transcript levels of our candidate genes. we later confirmed the expression of these candidate genes in the mouse rms using the microarray data of laser microdissected rms generated by khodosevich et al.  <cit> . our gene co-expression network indicates the candidate genes glutamine fructose-6-phosphate transaminase  <dig>  in the significant chr  <dig> qtl as a highly-connected node that positively co-vary with ppp2ca and sparc in the suggestive chr  <dig> qtl. gfpt <dig> also negatively co-varies gnpnat <dig> in the chr  <dig> qtl and seh1l in the chr  <dig> qtl. gfpt <dig> is a rate-limiting enzyme of the hexosamine pathway, and despite not directly implicated in neurogenesis, studies have shown gfpt <dig> to positively regulate cell proliferation and regeneration of other tissues  <cit> . the gfpt <dig> regulated-hexosamine biosynthesis pathway has been shown to drive the levels of β-catenin and cell proliferation  <cit> . the expression of β-catenin is the downstream target of the canonical wnt pathway , which is regulated by other qtl candidate genes such as ppp2ca. these findings demonstrate the dynamic interplay of candidate genes and the convergence of different pathways to influence cell proliferation in the adult brain.

the high correlation between cell proliferation in the rms and several hippocampal traits such as the number of granule cells in the dentate gyrus led us to suspect shared genetic determinants underlying proliferation in rms and dentate gyrus. we examined the qtls modulating cell proliferation in sgz of the dentate gyrus using our expanded panel of bxds. the number of proliferative cells in the sgz differed ~ <dig> fold among the  <dig> bxd ri strains. a similar fold difference was reported by kempermann and colleagues where they used ki <dig> as a proliferative marker and quantified the number of dividing cells in the sgz of  <dig> bxd ri strains  <cit> . the proliferative differences we detected among the bxds were mapped to three suggestive qtls on chr  <dig>  chr  <dig>  and chr  <dig>  these loci did not overlap with the qtls regulating rms cell proliferation. from these findings we concluded that there are separate sets of genes that differentially modulate npc proliferation at the rms and sgz.

CONCLUSIONS
the bottom-up approach, starting with the manipulation of a single gene to induce changes in phenotype, has yielded valuable insights into a gene’s role in adult neurogenesis. however, this approach is limited in capturing the full complexity of adult neurogenesis where several genes and signalling pathways can regulate neurogenesis in the adult brain. in this study, we gained insights into the genetic architecture underlying npc proliferation using a top-down, phenotypic-driven approach.

the rich genetic and phenotypic diversity in the expanded panel of bxd ri strains has allowed us to probe the complex networks regulating npc proliferation in the adult mouse brain. here, we performed genome-wide scans for qtls associated with the differences in the number of npcs among the bxd ri strains. novel qtls and significant loci-loci interaction were detected. using bioinformatics resources and transcriptome databases, we further identified several candidate genes with correlating expression patterns and discovered the convergence of these genes on the same/parallel signalling pathways that are known to regulate adult neurogenesis. the combinatorial influence of these regulators on npc proliferation remains to be elucidated. nevertheless, our findings provide a firm starting point to unravel modifier genes of npc proliferation and offer novel insights into the dynamic interplay of regulatory pathways controlling this process.
