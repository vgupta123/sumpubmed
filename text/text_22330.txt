BACKGROUND
the cop <dig> signalosome  is a conserved protein complex, which controls eukaryotic protein degradation via the ubiquitin  proteasome system   <cit> . in mammals the core complex consists of  <dig> subunits   <cit> , the exact function of which is not exactly known. csn <dig> exhibits a mpn+/jamm domain  <cit>  responsible for metalloprotease activity. as a complex-bound protein csn <dig> removes nedd <dig>  an ubiquitin-like protein, from cullins. this cleavage of an isopeptide bond called deneddylation controls the ubiquitination by cullin-ring ub ligases , a large family of multisubunit e3s  <cit> . cullin proteins  are components of crls functioning as scaffolds of the ub ligase complexes. cullin neddylation and deneddylation regulates the crl complex assembly in a substrate dependent manner as it has been shown for cul1-scfskp <dig> and p27kip   <cit> . in addition, crls contain ring-domain proteins, frequently rbx <dig> or rbx <dig>  which are responsible for ubiquitination as well as for neddylation  <cit> . substrate specificity of the crls is determined by components called substrate receptors including f-box proteins in cul1-based crls and btb-domain proteins in cul3-complexes  <cit> .

the csn is associated with a cysteine protease called ub specific protease  <dig> , which belongs to the family of deubiquitinating enzymes   <cit> . usp <dig> is able to cleave linear as well as branched ub chains. the cleavage of lysine 48-linked poly-ub chains requires a functional zn finger  <cit> . the cysteine protease regulates the activity of crls by protecting rbx <dig>  <cit>  as well as f-box and btb-domain proteins  <cit>  from autoubiquitination and degradation.

in addition, the csn is associated with kinases such as ck <dig>  pkd  <cit> , akt  <cit>  and inositol  <dig> ,4-trisphosphate 5/ <dig> kinase  <cit> . the kinases modify substrates of the ups and determine their stability  <cit> . the ck <dig> binds to subunits csn <dig> and csn <dig> whereas the pkd interacts with csn <dig>  <cit> . csn-associated ck <dig> phosphorylates the tumor suppressor p <dig>  <cit>  and the inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases p <dig>  <cit> , which targets the proteins to degradation by the 26s proteasome. in contrast, phosphorylation of c-jun stabilizes the transcription factor towards the ups  <cit> . inhibitors of csn-associated kinases such as curcumin or emodin elevate the amount of p <dig>  which causes apoptosis in tumor cells  <cit> . on the other hand, by blocking phosphorylation these compounds target c-jun to rapid degradation by the ups  <cit> . subunit csn <dig> directly interacts with c-jun  <cit> , p <dig>  <cit>  as well as with p <dig>  <cit> , which is presumably necessary for csn-mediated phosphorylation and degradation of the proteins, although the exact interrelations are not yet clear. the impact of permanent downregulation of csn <dig> in hela cells on the stability of c-jun and p <dig> was investigated in the present study.

to analyze functional characteristics of genes in yeast, knockouts have been performed. unfortunately knockouts of csn genes in yeast possess only weak or no phenotypes  <cit> . in contrast, csn knockouts in drosophila  <cit> , in plants  <cit>  and in mammals  <cit>  are lethal. recently functional genomic studies in mammalian cells include specific sirna oligos that cause degradation of the target gene mrnas. for example, the conditional knockdown of csn <dig> expression in hek <dig> cells using a doxycycline-inducible shrna system led to the degradation of f-box proteins accompanied with reduced crl activity  <cit> . it has been shown that downregulation of jab1/csn <dig> in leukemia cell lines prevented p <dig> degradation  <cit> . recent knockdown studies in drosophila revealed a role of the csn in the cell cycle  <cit> .

by using specific sirna oligos against csn <dig>  csn <dig> and csn <dig> permanently expressed in hela cells, we studied the impact of csn subunit knockdowns on the csn complex stability and target protein degradation. we demonstrate that knockdowns of csn <dig> or csn <dig> led to a downregulation of the entire csn complex, whereas in case of csn <dig> downregulation the remaining complex was stable. the decrease of the binding subunit csn <dig> in sicsn <dig> cells as well as diminished csn complex in sicsn <dig> and sicsn <dig> cells led to reduced stability of rbx <dig> and c-jun, whereas p <dig> was stabilized in sicsn <dig> cells.

RESULTS
the csn <dig> knockdown is unique compared to csn <dig> or csn <dig> knockdowns in hela cells
in order to study the influence of individual subunits on csn composition and functions csn <dig>  csn <dig> as well as csn <dig> were downregulated by specific sirna oligos permanently expressed in hela cells. as a control hela cells permanently expressing sirna oligos against gfp  were used. fig. 1a demonstrates the impact of sirna oligos against csn <dig> , csn <dig>  and csn <dig>  on the protein levels of the corresponding csn subunits in hela cells. the western blot shows that downregulation of csn <dig> and csn <dig> is accompanied by a reduction of subunits csn <dig> and csn <dig>  as it has been shown earlier under these conditions csn <dig> and csn <dig> protein levels were reduced below 40%, which was paralleled by a similar reduction of the holocomplex  <cit> . in contrast, downregulation of csn <dig> below 20% had little effect on the stability of csn <dig>  non-denaturing gel electrophoresis and glycerol gradient centrifugation revealed that sicsn <dig> cells possessed csn complexes with less or no csn <dig> as compared to control cells . in native gels the csn migrated to the same position as the control holocomplex, however, exhibiting only about 20% of the wild type  csn <dig> content . in glycerol gradients performed with lysate from sicsn <dig> cells the csn <dig> protein was hardly detectable in all fractions whereas the csn <dig> protein was not significantly changed in the common csn fractions . these data indicated that the knockdown of csn <dig> had little impact on the total amount and the size of the csn in hela cells. this differs from csn <dig> or csn <dig> knockdowns where the amount of the csn holocomplex decreased proportionally to the reduction of the csn subunits  <cit> . in sicsn <dig> cells deneddylation of cul <dig> was reduced compared to the control with sigfp cells . there was an increase in mono-neddylated cul <dig> as indicated by the western blot. this effect could be reversed by overexpressing csn5wt into sicsn <dig> cells. as shown in fig. 1d, deneddylation of cul <dig> was restored by exogenous csn <dig> indicating that the subunit was integrated into the complex.

csn knockdowns destabilize the ring-domain protein rbx1
it has been shown before that the csn, most likely by the csn-associated deubiquitinating enzyme usp <dig>  protects components of crls including the crl ring-domain component, rbx <dig>  against autoubiquitination and degradation  <cit> . therefore, by cycloheximide chase  experiments we investigated whether downregulation of csn subunits has any influence on the stability of rbx <dig>  as shown in fig. 2a and 2b, in sicsn <dig>  sicsn <dig> as well as in sicsn <dig> cells rbx <dig> was degraded faster as compared to the control. however, as demonstrated by densitometric analysis the csn <dig> knockdown was significantly less effective in stimulating rbx <dig> proteolysis as compared to csn <dig> and csn <dig> knockdowns .

there are differential roles of csn subunits in affecting target protein stability
the deneddylating mpn+-domain protein csn <dig> interacts with a large number of ligands. it can be called a substrate receptor of csn interacting proteins including important regulators such as c-jun and p <dig> . in contrast, csn <dig> and csn <dig> interact with csn-associated kinases  <cit> . one might postulate that knockdowns of csn <dig>  csn <dig> and csn <dig> should cause reduced csn-mediated phosphorylation of c-jun and of p <dig>  however, due to different reasons.

c-jun is stabilized by csn-mediated phosphorylation towards the ups  <cit> . to see whether c-jun stability is changed in sicsn <dig>  sicsn <dig> and in sicsn <dig> cells, we measured the proteolysis of the transcription factor in chx experiments. we expected an accelerated degradation in hela cells with downregulated csn subunits. as shown in fig. 3a, c-jun degradation is significantly faster in sicsn <dig>  sicsn <dig> as well as in sicsn <dig> cells as compared to the control. the half-life of c-jun declined from approximately  <dig> min in the control down to  <dig> min in csn <dig> knockdown cells. the changes in sicsn <dig> cells might be the result of the reduced csn <dig> substrate receptor, which is necessary for c-jun binding and subsequent phosphorylation. to prove this hypothesis sicsn <dig> cells were transfected with csn5wt as in fig. 1d. as shown in fig. 3b, left panel, overexpression of csn5wt increases c-jun half-life to a level, which is similar to that in sigfp cells . then we asked whether the deneddylating activity of csn <dig> is necessary for c-jun stabilization. for this purpose the csn5d151n mutant, which lost its metalloprotease activity, was transfected into sicsn <dig> cells. as seen in fig. 3b, right panel, overexpression of the csn5d151n mutant rescued c-jun just like csn5wt, indicating that the mutant supports binding of c-jun to the csn and perhaps subsequent phosphorylation. in sicsn <dig> and in sicsn <dig> cells overexpression of csn5wt should not block accelerated degradation of c-jun. this was tested with sicsn <dig> cells and is shown in fig. 3c.

to analyze whether cellular csn lost its ability to phosphorylate c-jun or p <dig> in sicsn <dig> cells, the csn was immunoprecipitated from sigfp and sicsn <dig> cells with the anti-csn <dig> antibody and kinase assays were performed with the precipitates. as shown in fig. 4a, autophosphorylation of csn <dig> and of csn <dig> was detected indicating that the csn-associated kinases precipitated from sicsn <dig> cells were active. it seemed that overall phosphorylation was slightly reduced, although autophosphorylation of csn <dig> increased. the phosphorylation of recombinant c-jun was diminished by more than 50% with the precipitate from sicsn <dig> cells as compared with the control . the effect is even more obvious with recombinant p <dig>  almost no phosphorylation was observed with the immunoprecipitate from sicsn <dig> cells .

the above data indicate that downregulation of csn <dig> led to a reduced phosphorylation of c-jun by the immunoprecipitated csn , which correlated with an accelerated degradation of the transcription factor . since csn-mediated phosphorylation of p <dig> accelerates its degradation by the ups  <cit> , we expected a stabilization of p <dig> in cells with csn subunit knockdowns. therefore, sicsn <dig> cells were synchronized by serum-deprivation for  <dig> h and then driven into g <dig> phase of cell cycle by serum complementation as performed before  <cit> . as seen in fig. 5a, there is a significant stabilization of p <dig> after serum starvation  in the cytoplasm as compared to the control, which is most likely due to a reduced degradation in sicsn <dig> cells during starvation. ten hours after reentry into the g <dig> phase the cell cycle inhibitor was still detectable in sicsn <dig> cells, whereas it disappeared in sigfp cells.

a decreased phosphorylation in sicsn <dig> cells has been shown for the microtubule-end-binding protein  <dig>   <cit> . just like c-jun the protein binds to csn <dig> and is stabilized by csn-mediated phosphorylation. by in vitro pulldowns with purified csn and recombinant gst-eb <dig> and by adding increasing amounts of recombinant csn <dig> it was demonstrated that eb <dig> can be competed away from its csn <dig> binding site . a similar experiment was performed in cells. csn5wt or csn5d151n mutant was overexpressed in hela cells and the binding and phosphorylation of endogenous eb <dig> to the csn was indirectly estimated by eb <dig> stability. as seen in fig. 5c, overexpression of csn5wt led to an accelerated degradation of eb <dig>  most likely because it was competed away from the csn and was less phosphorylated. the same effect was obtained by overexpressing csn5d151n indicating that the metalloprotease activity of csn <dig> is not necessary for this competition.

discussion
in the present study we compared the effects of csn subunit downregulation on the structure and functions of the holocomplex. the data presented here as well as in our recent work on eb <dig>  <cit>  demonstrate that downregulation of csn <dig> and csn <dig> by specific sirna oligos permanently expressed in hela cells led to a proportional downregulation of the csn holocomplex. in other words, knockdowns of csn <dig> and csn <dig> cause a proportional reduction of all determined csn subunits paralleled by a decrease of the holocomplex. none of the csn subunits were detected as free proteins under these conditions. similar data were obtained by kato and co-workers in murine embryonic fibroblasts were a reduction in the level of csn <dig> protein with sirna decreased the total amount of the holocomplex  <cit> . the complete deletion of the csn <dig> subunit in mice and also in other higher eukaryotes is lethal, which presumably can be due to the complete disappearance of the csn complex  <cit> . these data indicate that in mammalian cells exists a coordinated up and down regulation of csn subunits accompanied by an assembly or disassembly process of the holocomplex.

on the contrary, downregulation of subunit csn <dig> had little or no effect on other csn subunits and did not lead to the proportional disappearance of the residual complex. similar effects were observed by downregulation of csn <dig> in drosophila as well as in hela cells  <cit> . in other words, in sicsn <dig> cells csn complexes possess less or no csn <dig>  this might indicate that csn <dig> has a different impact on the coordinated assembly of the csn as compared to csn <dig> and csn <dig>  on the other hand, a complete depletion of csn <dig> in arabidopsis resulted in csn instability and the decay of various csn components  <cit> . interestingly, overexpressed csn5wt is most likely integrated into the csn complex in sicsn <dig> cells, because it is able to restore deneddylation activity of the particle .

although csn <dig>  csn <dig> as well as csn <dig> knockdowns led to destabilization of rbx <dig>  the effects are different. whereas in sicsn <dig> and sicsn <dig> cells rbx <dig> degradation is significantly accelerated, in sicsn <dig> cells the ring-domain protein is less destabilized . the protection of rbx <dig> from autoubiquitination and degradation is mostly due to the associated deubiquitinating enzyme usp <dig>  which interacts predominantly via csn <dig> with the csn  <cit> . this might explain why the stability of rbx <dig> in sicsn <dig> cells is less affected as compared to sicsn <dig> or sicsn <dig> cells. our sirna studies confirm the hypothesis that the csn stabilizes crl components by protecting them against autoubiquitination  <cit> . with less csn and its associated usp <dig> in cells there is less protection of the crls.

we speculate that changed stabilities of c-jun, p <dig> and eb <dig> in sicsn <dig>  sicsn <dig> as well as sicsn <dig> cells can be due to reduced csn-mediated phosphorylation of these proteins. in sicsn <dig> and sicsn <dig> cells the amount of the csn platform itself together with its associated kinases was decreased. in csn <dig> knockdown cells the reduction of the substrate receptor csn <dig> might be sufficient to cause a diminished phosphorylation of the tested substrates . immunoprecipitated csn from sicsn <dig> cells was less efficient in phosphorylating c-jun as well as p <dig> as compared to the control. this effect can be explained by the reduction of csn <dig> and, at least in part, by reduced overall kinase activity  perhaps caused by a changed csn structure. in contrast to sicsn <dig> cells the accelerated degradation of c-jun in sicsn <dig> cells was blocked by overexpression of csn5wt as well as of csn5d151n mutant . based on these data we came to two conclusions.  the overexpressed csn5wt was integrated into csn5-deficient csn complexes and acts as substrate receptor allowing normal substrate phosphorylation.  the rescue of c-jun stability by overexpressing csn5d151n demonstrates that the mutant is as potent as the csn5wt indicating that the metalloprotease activity of csn <dig> was not responsible for the effect.

presumably reduced phosphorylation of p <dig> in csn knockdown cells resulted in a stabilization of the cell cycle inhibitor during serum starvation . thus, the csn might control the ubiquitination of p <dig> by two different activities. first, it regulates the assembly of the appropriate cul1-crl complex for p <dig> ubiquitination by deneddylation  <cit> . second, it seems to be a platform for p <dig> phosphorylation that most likely accelerates p <dig> ubiquitination.

our data also show that one should be cautioned with the overexpression of csn <dig>  in hela cells free csn <dig> is undetectable under our conditions. overexpression of csn <dig> produces a free csn <dig> protein pool, which stimulates the degradation of eb <dig>  as shown by competition experiments in fig. 5b and 5c, this is most likely due to the trapping of eb <dig> by free csn <dig> and, as a result, to reduced csn-mediated phosphorylation and destabilization of eb <dig>  we speculate that overexpression of csn <dig> might exert artificial effects on other substrates that interact with csn <dig> as well.

future knockdown experiments with other csn subunits are necessary to fully understand the relationship between structure and function of the csn complex. in addition, the integration of diverse mutated subunits into the csn complex where possible will elucidate specific functions of subunit domains.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that downregulation of csn <dig> and csn <dig> reduced the csn holocomplex. in contrast, downregulation of csn <dig> did not change the remaining csn complex, although csn <dig> protein was reduced. all studied knockdown cells were characterized by a destabilization of the crl component rbx <dig> and of the transcription factor c-jun. in csn <dig> knockdowns c-jun destabilization was rescued by csn <dig> overexpression, demonstrating the substrate receptor role of csn <dig>
