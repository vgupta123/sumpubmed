BACKGROUND
bacteria contain a class of regulatory non-coding  rnas that are transcribed in trans from distinct promoters  <cit> . they are typically between  <dig> and  <dig> nt in size  <cit>  and have become known as bacterial small rnas, or srnas. the majority of known srna genes are located in intergenic regions, but it is becoming increasingly evident that a relatively large number of rnas are also being transcribed from within protein coding regions, but from the opposite strand . even though their roles are still mostly unknown, it is likely that anti-sense rnas also play important roles in gene regulation. cis-encoded anti-sense rnas share extensive complementarity to their messenger rna  target, whereas trans-encoded rnas typically show limited complementarity  <cit> . although cis-encoded rna regulators can be encoded from within their mrna target, they are typically located in front of protein coding regions as part of the mrna. here they change the expression of the corresponding protein by binding small metabolites   <cit> .

srnas typically bind to the 5' end of mrnas through short imperfect base-paring and induce degradation of itself and the target  <cit> . other mechanisms, like direct interaction with proteins to modulate their activities or increase stability of mrnas, also occur. finding the function and/or mechanism of srnas can however be a daunting task, and the spot  <dig> srna represents a striking example. it was first described as an unstable rna species of  <dig> nt in escherichia coli that accumulated under growth in the presence of glucose  is low)  <cit> . during growth with a non-glucose carbon source , the spot  <dig> concentrations were found to be significantly lower. later experiments showed that over-expression of spot  <dig>  resulted in impaired growth and lowered ability to adapt to shifts to richer media or shift from glucose to succinate as the carbon source  <cit> . also, deletion of the gene that encodes spot  <dig>  i.e., spf , resulted in viable spf null mutants, which indicated that the spot  <dig> rna is non-essential  <cit> . the direct responsiveness of spot  <dig> levels to glucose and camp is due to repression of spf by a camp-crp  complex  <cit> . it was unclear for some years if the function of spot  <dig> was mediated through the  <dig> nt rna itself or through a  <dig> amino acids long peptide that is hypothetically encoded from within the srna. this controversy was settled by rice et al.  <cit> . they used a filter binding assay and other methods to show that spot  <dig> bound very inefficiently and nonproductive to purified 70s ribosomes, and concluded that spot  <dig> function is mediated by the rna itself. later, the proximity of spf to pola  lead dahlberg and co-workers to test whether the products of these genes could influence each other  <cit> , and they found that reduction in spot  <dig> levels, either by deletion of spf or by manipulating the growth conditions, both resulted in reduction in dna pol a activity. the underlying mechanism remains however unknown. the first direct spot  <dig> target was discovered by m√∏ller et al.  <cit> , who showed that the srna can bind specifically by base pairing with a short complementary region of the translation initiation region of galk , which is the third gene of the galactose operon . the spot 42-binding region overlaps with the galk shine-dalgarno region, thereby blocking ribosome binding. spot  <dig> is therefore responsible for a discoordinate regulation of the gal operon. finally, in a recent work beisel and storz  <cit>  demonstrated with microarray analysis and reporter fusions that spot  <dig> plays a broader role in metabolism by regulating at least fourteen operons dominated by genes involved in uptake and catabolism of non-favored carbon sources. several of these operons are regulated by both spot  <dig> and crp, and these two regulators can therefore be considered as participating in a feed-forward loop.

in this study, we used our model bacterium aliivibrio salmonicida, which belongs to the vibrionaceae family of gamma-proteobacteria, to further address the biological roles of spot  <dig>  when we started the project, galk was the only known spot  <dig> target. interestingly, we found that a. salmonicida naturally lacks the gal operon, but contains a highly conserved spf gene, and we therefore considered this bacterium as an excellent model for studying spot  <dig> roles other than in galk regulation. even though other spot  <dig> targets have since been proposed  <cit> , our study is still valid, and our goal remains the same, i.e., to identify all biological roles of spot  <dig>  we generated an a. salmonicida spf deletion mutant and used microarray and northern blot analyses to find more clues to its function. deletion of spf has a surprisingly large effect on the transcriptome, with the most dramatic effect on expression of a pirin-like protein gene. in the process, we also discovered a neighboring srna, named vssrna <dig>  which is encoded from the same intergenic region  and  <dig> nt downstream of spf. interestingly, this rna is expressed in a pattern opposite to that of spot  <dig>  and its expression is repressed by glucose.

RESULTS
spf is highly conserved in vibrionaceae and is located upstream of a previously unrecognized srna gene named vssrna24
we first surveyed available genome sequences from the vibrionaceae family and found that orthologs of spf are found in virtually all  <dig> currently available genomes. available genomes include representatives of the vibrio, aliivibrio, photobacterium, and grimontia genera. six v. cholerae genomes lack a recognizable spf gene, but we suspect that this is due to the poor quality of these genomes  or the lack of data. by using the spf sequence of a. salmonicida as the query in a blastn search, the gene was also identified in fourteen gamma-proteobacteria genera  in the enterobacteriales order.

next, we examined the sequence upstream of spf for potential transcription factor binding sites to gain insights into regulation of spf transcription. sequences that weakly resemble the e. coli crp binding site, and - <dig> and - <dig> promoter regions were predicted upstream of vibrionaceae spf sequences.

expression of spot  <dig> and the adjacent vssrna <dig> is highly dependent on glucose
it is established that expression of e. coli spot  <dig> is repressed by the transcription factor crp and camp  <cit> . expression is also highly dependent on concentrations of available glucose since camp adenylyl cyclase  is inhibited as a side-effect during glucose transport into the cell. as a result, camp levels are low when glucose is rich and is being transported into the cell for consumption, and vice versa.

to test if a. salmonicida spot  <dig> is expressed similar to that in e. coli, the bacterium was cultured in lb with  <dig> % nacl added  under standard lab conditions, and samples were collected throughout the growth cycle. at od <dig> nm  <dig>  the culture was split, and one half was supplemented with  <dig> mm camp   <cit>  . at early growth phase the intracellular levels of camp are expected to be low. similarly, the starting culture was also split at od <dig> nm  <dig> , and glucose was added to one half to a final concentration of  <dig> mm . cell samples were collected at various time points after the addition of camp or glucose to monitor the levels of spot  <dig> by northern blot analysis. figure 2b shows that spot  <dig> is found at high levels during the early phases of growth, but is gradually lost and is below our level of detection at od <dig> nm  <dig> . the level of spot  <dig> is significantly reduced  after addition of camp or is significantly increased  after addition of glucose. these results are in agreement with results from e. coli, which suggest that a. salmonicida spot  <dig> serve roles similar to that in e. coli, i.e., in carbohydrate metabolism.

in the same experiment we also monitored the levels of the putative srna named vssrna <dig>  which is encoded from the same igr as spot  <dig>  this srna produced a signal corresponding to an rna of approximately  <dig> nt in length, with an expression pattern opposite to that of spot  <dig>  also, expression of vssrna <dig> is repressed by glucose , but appears independent of camp. these observations and the close proximity of vssrna <dig> to spot  <dig> suggested to us that vssrna <dig> might also play roles in carbohydrate metabolism, perhaps in concert with spot  <dig> 

finally, in a simple experiment we subjected a. salmonicida to different stress conditions  or to one of two quorum sensing signal molecules , and monitored levels of spot  <dig> and vssrna <dig> by northern blot analysis . this was done to test if expression of spot  <dig> and/or vssrna <dig> is dependent on external stress factors or communication molecules, which could indicate potential roles in stress response or quorum sensing, respectively. a. salmonicida was grown to od <dig> nm  <dig>  and subjected to the different treatments. samples were then collected at various time points after treatment, but none of the stress conditions dramatically changed the expression pattern, maybe except for low iron conditions  that resulted in reduction in spot  <dig> levels .

to summarize, we found that expression of a. salmonicida spot  <dig> is repressed by camp and activated by glucose, whereas expression of a new srna, named vssrna <dig>  is repressed by glucose and is independent of camp. we also found that expression of both spot  <dig> and vssrna <dig> is, in general, not affected by external stress factors or by the addition of quorum sensing signals.

microarray analysis of a a. salmonicida spf deletion mutant identifies potential roles and targets
we constructed a spf deletion mutant  to identify potential biological roles and possible mrna targets for a. salmonicida spot  <dig>  the transcriptome of the spf deletion mutant was compared on a global scale to that of the wild-type strain by using microarray analysis. to create growth conditions in which spot  <dig> was highly expressed in the wild-type strain, the cells were cultured in asmm minimal medium and then stimulated by adding glucose as the main carbon sources. specifically, in three independent experiments , cells were grown to od <dig> nm  <dig> , and  <dig>  mm glucose was added. samples were collected  <dig> min after addition of glucose, total rna was extracted, and the three independent samples were pooled before cdna synthesis and hybridization to three a. salmonicida whole genome custom dna chips . rna from glucose treated wild-type and spf deletion cells were labeled with fluorescent dyes and run on same dna chips.

using the limma framework in bioconductor  <cit>  we considered genes with ‚â•  <dig> fold differential expression and adjusted p-values ‚â§  <dig> . figure  <dig> shows a graphical presentation of the functional classes and the number of differentially up- or downregulated genes in the spf deletion mutant  <dig> min after addition of glucose. details on differentially regulated genes are shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig> . from these data it is clear that the spf deletion is affecting the expression of a relatively large number of genes  that belong to a wide range of categories, such as "foreign dna", "carbohydrate metabolism", "cell envelope", "transport proteins", "motility", "iron homeostasis", and "quorum sensing". spot  <dig> therefore has a broad effect on multiple cellular functions.

major findings are, first, that a gene encoding a pirin protein is by far the most upregulated gene. the log <dig> ratio between spf deletion mutant and wild-type is  <dig>  , whereas the same value for the second most upregulated gene, i.e., vsal_i <dig> that encodes a methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein, is  <dig>  . the pirin protein  has  <dig> and 24% identity, and  <dig> and 49% similarity to the e. coli  and s. marcescens  pirin proteins, respectively, when all positions in the protein sequences are considered . second, the top  <dig> list of most upregulated genes is highly enriched with genes involved in motility and chemotaxis . upregulation of genes with functions in motility and chemotaxis is potentially a result of upregulation of the flagellar biosynthesis sigma factor , encoded by flia , the spoiiaa anti-sigma f factor antagonist , and finally the anti-sigma  <dig> factor . these are the most upregulated genes  of all sigma factor-related genes in the complete dataset. flagella-related genes are known from other bacteria to be regulated by the sigma  <dig> factor . almost all upregulated motility and chemotaxis genes are located in the same gene cluster . third, frubk are both on the top  <dig> list of upregulated genes, whereas frua is also significantly upregulated . fruab constitute the fructose-specific eii-component of the phosphotransferase system . therefore, the upregulation of fruabk supports a similar role for a. salmonicida spot  <dig> as in e. coli where uptake of less favorable sugars is suppressed by spot  <dig> . finally, the top  <dig> list of most downregulated genes is dominated by foreign dna  and genes encoding non-coding rnas , including a number of predicted srna genes.

in summary, the microarray analysis shows that deletion of spf has a broad effect on many genes and cellular functions. interestingly, the most upregulated gene encodes a putative pirin protein. in s. marcescens, pirin has been found to regulate the activity of pyruvat dehydrogenase e <dig>  <cit> . pirin is therefore a key regulator in the central metabolism by selecting the destiny of pyruvat, either through fermentation or respiration through the tricarboxylic acid  cycle and electron transport. because a. salmonicida spot  <dig> directly or indirectly regulates pirin, spot  <dig> likely plays a critical regulatory role in the central metabolism.

upregulation of pirin and repression of multiple srnas are supported by northern blot analysis
inspired by findings from the microarray analysis we next used northern blot analysis to evaluate results of particular interest. first, we wanted to validate levels of spot  <dig>  and therefore generated a corresponding -labeled dna probe. figure 4a shows the resulting autoradiogram which confirms that spot  <dig> is rich in wild-type cells in the presence of glucose, and is absent from spf deletion cells. as expected, spot  <dig> is virtually absent in wild-type cells grown without any added glucose.

we were intrigued by the dramatic effect of spf deletion on levels of a putative pirin-encoding mrna. in agreement with the microarray result a pirin probe produced no visible band when using total rna from wild-type cells, whereas total rna from spf deletion mutant cells treated with glucose produced a distinct and readily visible band of the expected size . the increase in intensity corresponds to a fold change value of approx.  <dig> folds . we next used the rnahybrid software  <cit>  to test for potential interactions between spot  <dig> and the 5' region of the pirin mrna. this software calculates the most energetically favorable base pairing between a small rna and a larger target rna  <cit> . additional file  <dig> shows that when using a. salmonicida spot  <dig>  and a sequence extending from - <dig> nt to +  <dig> relative to the pirin start codon as input sequences to the program, significant potential for base-pairing between spot  <dig> and the 5' untranslated region  of the pirin mrna is found. given that spot  <dig> binds directly to this region then this would be similar to the most common form of srna-mrna interaction, i.e., base pairing within the 5' utr region  <cit> . further analysis to address potential interactions between spot  <dig> and pirin mrna will come from biochemical methods, such as gel mobility shift assay, fusion-reporter assays, structure probing and site directed mutagenesis.

our microarray data suggest that many predicted srnas are significantly downregulated in the spf deletion mutant. this can potentially be explain by reduction in hfq  and/or upregulation of rnasee , which can destabilize srnas in general. however, the microarray data indicate that mrna levels of the corresponding mrnas are virtually unchanged. next, we designed probes against the new vssrna <dig>  and the ryhb and qrr srnas that are critical components in regulation of iron homeostasis and quorum sensing, respectively. these srnas were found to be downregulated approx.  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> folds, which is in good agreement with the corresponding numbers  from the microarray analysis. the underlying mechanism for the apparent reduction in srna levels remains however unclear. it should however be noted that vssrna <dig> is encoded  <dig> nt downstream of the deleted region in the spf mutant strain, and it is therefore possible that the deletion has affected the promoter and therefore expression of vssrna <dig>  in the same experiment we also included a vssrna <dig> deletion mutant. here, ryhb is also significantly downregulated , whereas levels of spot  <dig> and qrr appear unchanged.

CONCLUSIONS
we have studied potential biological roles of a a. salmonicida spot  <dig> homolog and discovered a neighboring srna, named vssrna <dig>  the expression of spot  <dig> is similar to that in e. coli, i.e., expression is repressed by camp and activated by glucose. expression of vssrna <dig> is, in contrast, repressed by glucose but unaffected by camp. a microarray analysis revealed that deletion of spf affects a wide range of cellular processes and the expression of a surprisingly large number of genes. after addition of glucose at mid exponential growth phase , the most differentially upregulated gene in the spf deletion mutant was vsal_i <dig>  which encodes a pirin protein with 21% identity and 45% similarity to the e. coli pirin. other notable results are upregulation of many genes involved in motility and chemotaxis, and downregulation of predicted srna genes and foreign dnas. expression of spot  <dig>  vssrna <dig>  qrr, ryhb and pirin were validated by northern blot analysis. figure  <dig> shows a hypothesis of the main findings. it should be stressed that it should be regarded as a hypothesis that must be tested further, and solid evidence can come from e.g., gel mobility shift assay or fusion-reporter assays to address potential interactions between spot  <dig> and potential mrna targets, or complementation assay to restore spot  <dig> functions.

the majority of bacterial regulatory rnas, like srnas, probably remain to be identified. eighty-seven srnas are known in e. coli  <cit> , whereas the corresponding number is much lower for other bacteria. once identified, finding the function and targets of each srna represents a formidable task. in general, the current knowledge on srna function is therefore limited. although one or a few targets have been identified for a given srna, it is likely that many additional targets remain to be found. for example, in e. coli, the transcript of the multi-cistronic gal operon was for many years the only known spot  <dig> target  <cit> , but a recent microarray analysis in which over-expression of spf with an isopropyl Œ≤-d-thiogalactopyranoside -inducible promoter was used, suggests many additional targets  <cit> . the list of targets is enriched in genes involved in sugar transport  or sugar catabolism . we have used a knock-out approach to find overexpressed genes that could be potential spot  <dig> targets in a. salmonicida. interestingly, the majority of genes that corresponds to mrna targets in e. coli are apparently not present  in the a. salmonicida genome . also, apparent homologs of the remaining e. coli targets were in general not significantly differentially expressed in our dataset. these results suggest that there are significant differences in spot  <dig> regulation between e. coli and a. salmonicida.

perhaps our most intriguing finding is that a. salmonicida spot  <dig> appears to directly or indirectly regulate the levels of pirin mrna. this is in agreement with its currently known role in carbohydrate metabolism, and that the level of spot  <dig> is repressed by camp and activated by glucose. we are also pursuing potential roles of the neighboring srna, named vssrna <dig>  its expression is repressed by glucose, and we suspect that this srna also could have important roles in carbohydrate metabolism.
