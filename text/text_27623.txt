BACKGROUND
triacylglycerols  are the major storage lipids which accumulate in developing seeds, flower petals, anthers, pollen grains, and fruit mesocarp of a number of plant species  <cit> . tags are thought to be not only the major energy source for seed germination but also essential for pollen development and sexual reproduction in many plants  <cit> . in oilseeds, tag bioassembly is catalyzed by the membrane-bound enzymes of the kennedy pathway that operate in the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> . the biosynthesis of tags is catalyzed by the sequential acylation of the glycerol backbone involving three acyltransferases: glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase , lyso-phosphatidic acid acyltransferase  and diacylglycerol acyltransferase . dgat catalyses the final acylation of dag to give tag, which has been suggested to be the rate-limiting step in plant lipid accumulation.

in the traditional kennedy pathway dgat was thought to be the only enzyme that is exclusively committed to tag biosynthesis using acyl-coa as its acyl donor. the first dgat gene was cloned from mouse and is a member of the dgat <dig> family, which had high sequence similarity with sterol: acyl-coa acyltransferase  <cit> .

we had previously characterized an ems-induced mutant of arabidopsis, designated as <dig>  which displayed a decrease in stored seed tag, delayed seed development, and an altered fatty acid composition  <cit> . we analyzed wt vs. as <dig> lipid pools and kennedy pathway enzyme activities in fractions isolated from green mid-developing seed, and performed parallel labeling of intact seeds at this developmental stage, with  acetate. we found that compared to wt, there was an increase in all fatty acids in the dag pool of as <dig> seeds at mid-development, and, to a lesser extent, an associated backup of fatty acids in the pc pool. dag was elevated from 1% in wt to 10-12% in as <dig> and pc pools were elevated from about 2% in wt, to 8-12% in as <dig>  cell-free fractions from wt and as <dig> green seeds at mid-development were compared for their ability to incorporate -18:1-coa into glycerolipids in the presence of g-3-p. proportions of labeled lpa and pa formed during the incubation period were similar in wt vs as <dig>  indicating that the activities of the kennedy pathway enzymes gpat and lpaat  were relatively unaffected in the as <dig> mutant. however, the proportion of labeled tag was much lower and that of dag was much higher in as <dig>  the tag/dag ratio was therefore consistently 3-5-fold lower in as <dig> compared to wt at all developmental stages . furthermore, the ratio of 18:3/20: <dig> dramatically increased about 7- <dig> fold  <cit> .

cumulatively, this data suggested a lesion in dgat <dig> which was subsequently demonstrated upon cloning the mutated gene from as <dig>  there is an  <dig> bp in-frame insertion consisting entirely of exon  <dig> in the transcript from as <dig>  the exon  <dig> in the repeat is properly spliced, thus the alteration of the transcript does not disturb the reading frame. however, this additional exon  <dig> sequence in the as <dig> transcript would result in an altered dgat protein with a  <dig> amino acid insertion   <cit> . it is important to note that two other labs independently and simultaneously cloned the a. thaliana dgat <dig>  <cit> .

studies manipulating the expression of dgat <dig> followed: we demonstrated that expression of the arabidopsis dgat <dig> cdna in a seed specific manner in the as <dig> mutant restored wild type levels of tag and vlcfa content. the acyl distribution, specifically, the sn- <dig> composition of the tags, was also restored to wt proportions. furthermore, overexpression of the arabidopsis dgat <dig> in wild type plants led to an increase in seed oil content and seed weight  <cit> . over the past  <dig> years, dgat <dig> expression has been genetically manipulated to produce brassica napus prototypes containing increased seed oil  <cit> .

a second family of dgat genes , first identified in the oleaginous fungus morteriella ramanniana, has no sequence similarity with dgat <dig>  <cit> . a human dgat <dig> and plant dgat2s from tung and castor were subsequently identified by cases et al.  <cit> , shockey et al.  <cit>  and kroon et al.  <cit> , respectively. the putative dgat <dig> from arabidopsis has been studied by several labs including ours; functional expression in yeast has not been successful, and therefore whether it is a true functioning dgat is still in question. notably, an arabidopsis dgat <dig> knockout mutant has a wild-type seed oil content and fatty acid composition  <cit> .

tag can also be formed by an acyl-coa-independent enzyme, phosphatidylcholine: diacylglycerol acyltransferase , in which the transfer of an acyl group from the sn- <dig> position of pc to the sn- <dig> position of dag yields tag and sn- <dig> lyso-pc  <cit> . during the exponential growth phase in yeast, pdat <dig> is a major determinant in tag synthesis. in arabidopsis, two close homologs to the yeast pdat gene have been identified: pdat <dig> at5g <dig> and pdat <dig> at3g <dig>  <cit> . mhaske et al.  <cit>  isolated and characterized a knockout mutant of arabidopsis which has a t-dna insertion in the pdat <dig> locus at5g <dig> . lipid analyses were conducted on this mutant to assess the contribution of pdat <dig> to seed lipid biosynthesis; surprisingly, and in contrast to the situation in yeast, the oil content and composition in seeds did not show significant changes in the mutant. at the time, these results were interpreted to indicate that pdat <dig> activity as encoded by at5g <dig> is not a major determining factor for tag synthesis in arabidopsis seeds.

nonetheless, because the arabidopsis dgat <dig> mutant as <dig> shows only a 30-35% decrease in oil content  <cit> , it was apparent that other enzymes must contribute to oil synthesis in the developing seed  <cit> . thus, an examination of the contribution of dgat <dig>  pdat <dig> or pdat <dig> to oil deposition in an as <dig> background was studied by performing double mutant crosses with as <dig>  <cit> . while the dgat2-ko line has no oil phenotype, homozygous double mutants from cross of as <dig> with dgat2-ko mutant showed an oil fatty acid profile similar to as <dig>  the same pattern was observed with the pdat2-ko mutant alone and in crosses of the pdat2-ko mutant with as <dig>  in contrast, while the pdat1-ko has no oil or fatty acid composition phenotype, crosses of the pdat1-ko with as <dig> were embryo-lethal in the double homozygous condition; only heterozygous lines produced by having expression of the pdat <dig> or dgat <dig> gene only partially inhibited using rnai, allowed an examination of the double mutants. these detailed studies resulted in the finding that dgat <dig> and pdat <dig> have overlapping functions in both embryo development and tag biosynthesis in the developing seed and in pollen. when dgat <dig> is compromised in as <dig>  it is pdat <dig>  and not dgat <dig> or pdat <dig>  that is responsible for the remaining 65-70% of tag which is synthesized. this finding suggested a major, perhaps dominant role of pdat <dig> in this process  <cit> .

recently, a castor bean-specific pdat, pdat1- <dig>  was cloned and found to be highly expressed in developing seeds and localized in the er, similar to the castor fah <dig> hydroxylase. transgenic arabidopsis co-expressing the castor pdat1- <dig> and fah <dig> showed enhanced ricinoleate accumulation to up to 25% in tags   <cit> . this study suggests that specialized pdats may play a significant role in channeling pc-synthesized unusual fatty acids such as ricinoleic , or epoxy fatty acids , into tags.

the discovery of the critical role pdat <dig> has in tag synthesis  <cit>  suggested the importance of re-acylation of lysophospholipids and especially lpc, since it is produced as a result of pdat <dig> activity. we hypothesized that in a situation where the responsibility for tag synthesis is shifted to pdat <dig> such as in the as <dig> dgat <dig> mutant, profound changes in activity of re-acylation enzymes would be evident. as candidates of genes coding such enzymes, we proposed the two arabidopsis genes lplat <dig>  and lplat <dig> , characterized by ståhl et al.  <cit>  as possessing broad specificity lysophospholipid acyltransferase activity. although both of the genes to some extent could acylate a range of different lysophospholipids, they were shown to have a strong preference towards lpc. for this reason we chose to name the two genes lpcat <dig>  and lpcat <dig> , in the current study.

here we report the further genetic and biochemical characterization of the as <dig> dgat <dig> mutant. during the course of microarray and qrt-pcr studies of as <dig> vs wt gene expression in mid-developing siliques, we found that lpcat <dig>  encoding acyl-coa:lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase  <dig> , was up-regulated while lpcat <dig> was not affected. by a series of biochemical studies and key crosses of as <dig> with either lpcat <dig> or lpcat <dig> knockout mutants, we determined that lpcat <dig>  is most critical for tag synthesis in the as <dig> mutant, primarily to maintain the pc pool for tag assembly primarily catalyzed by pdat <dig> 

RESULTS
summary of the as <dig> mutant developmental and oil phenotypes
the as <dig> mutant line was about one week behind wt in bolting and entering the generative phase and thus, under our growing conditions, as <dig> seed set was also delayed to four weeks post-anthesis instead of three, as typically observed in wt. for comparison, we studied another dgat <dig> mutant, which we designated a <dig>  which is a homozygous salk line  with a t-dna insertion in the last exon of the same dgat <dig> gene . a <dig> shows a developmental delay similar to that exhibited by as <dig> .

using protein fractions prepared from wt and as <dig> mid-developing siliques containing embryos at mid-development  we were able to determine the relative changes of tag assembly activity in the mutant line. tag synthesis capacity was measured in wt and as <dig> lines with 14c-labeled diolein and unlabeled oleoyl-coa as co-substrates; the  <dig> c-labeled triolein product was measured by radio-hplc as described previously  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  by stages 7- <dig> there was a 35% decrease in the acylation of radiolabeled dag in as <dig>  a finding which was strongly correlated with the ca 30% reduction in oil content in mature as <dig> seed  <cit> .

heterologous expression of mutated arabidopsis dgat1s from both a <dig> and as <dig> in yeast strain h1246matα
the altered fatty acid and low tag phenotype in as <dig> seed raised questions as to how the as <dig> mutant still manages to make 65-70% of wt levels of seed oil. because as <dig> has a reduced tag phenotype, it was essential to determine whether the dgat <dig> in as <dig> was merely mutated and exhibited reduced activity as we initially suggested  <cit> , or whether it is, in fact, non-functional. this has not heretofore been confirmed. the importance of doing so will become apparent in the pcr assessment of the dgat <dig> transcript in both as <dig> and in some genetic crosses performed in the current study, and discussed below. the cdna from the as <dig>  was cloned into a yeast expression vector pyes <dig>  under the control of the galactose-inducible gal <dig> promoter, and the construct was used to transform a yeast mutant strain h1246matα, which lacks all four genes, are <dig>  are <dig>  dgat <dig> and lro <dig>  which were found to contribute to tag synthesis  <cit> . this yeast mutant has been successfully used in studies of dgat function wherein wt and mutated forms of plant dgat1s have been expressed and thereby function or lack thereof in the plant inferred  <cit> . h1246matα yeast cells harboring an empty pyes <dig>  vector plasmid or transformed with wt dgat <dig> cdna were used as a negative and positive controls, respectively . a western blot of the microsomal membrane fractions isolated from the induced yeast h1246matα cells  showed that both the mutated as <dig> and a <dig> and wt dgat <dig> proteins  were stably expressed. in the pyes plasmid-only transformant, there was neither detectable dgat <dig> protein, nor non-specific cross-reactivity of the antibody with non-dgat <dig> proteins of a similar size. the western showed that the as <dig> dgat <dig> was slightly larger  than that of wt, while for the a <dig> dgat <dig>  the largest possible stable transcript  encoded a protein that was significantly smaller than wt. however, as shown in figure 2b, the as <dig> dgat <dig> could not compensate for the inability to produce tag in this yeast quadruple mutant. equally, when we assayed the transformed yeast microsomal protein fractions in vitro for dgat activity using unlabeled oleoyl-coa  as an acyl donor, and  <dig> c-sn- <dig>  diolein  as acceptor, enzyme activity was not detected in the yeast strain harboring the mutated dgat <dig> cdna from the as <dig> mutant and empty control pyes <dig>  vector, but was found in the positive wt control. this indicated, perhaps not unexpectedly, but for the first time, that the mutated dgat <dig> from as <dig> is non-functional. equally, the truncated dgat <dig> from the a <dig> mutant  was shown to be non-functional when expressed in h1246matα cells .

thus our results strongly support that dgat <dig> is not functioning in the developing seed of the as <dig> mutant line. clearly, the  tag formation observed in protein fractions from as <dig> was coming from another path and not via reduced dgat <dig> catalysis.

given the importance of pdat <dig> in oil biosynthesis in arabidopsis as we earlier defined  <cit> , and combining this new information with the 14c tag biosynthesis results in assays of wt vs as <dig> protein fractions reported above, it raised the question that, if not from dgat <dig>  dgat <dig> nor pdat <dig>  what biochemical steps besides pdat <dig> may be critical for tag biosynthesis?

as <dig> microarray and qrt-pcr analyses
these cumulative findings prompted us to examine a broader inventory of gene transcripts/encoded proteins that may be involved in regulating lipid biosynthesis in as <dig> when dgat <dig> activity is compromised, compared to their corresponding expression pattern in wt. thus we performed a microarray analysis of gene expression in mid-developing seeds of mutant as <dig> and wt arabidopsis. based on selected probable lipid assembly-related transcripts  <cit>  differentially expressed through the microarray study, we complemented this with a semi-quantitative qrt-pcr analysis and compared the % change in as <dig> transcript relative to wt, for each. while neither method is truly quantitative, the qualitative trends in each study were highly consistent .

some general observations from these combined gene expression studies follow: in as <dig>  fae <dig> is down-regulated, fads  <dig> & <dig> are up-regulated; this is consistent with the as <dig> acyl composition profile . dgat <dig> expression was not significantly affected. interestingly, lpcat <dig> was up-regulated by an average of 65%, while lpcat <dig> expression was indifferent. pdat <dig> was only marginally affected, but pdat <dig> expression was up-regulated by an average of 62% compared to wt.

given the critical role of pdat <dig> in embryo development and tag deposition in both pollen and seeds  <cit> , we were interested in the relative differences in lpcat <dig> and lpcat <dig> expression between the as <dig> mutant and wt. we hypothesized that an acyl-coa-dependent lpcat may be critical to maintain the pc pool as one of the co-substrates for pdat1-catalyzed tag synthesis, particularly in the absence of a functional dgat <dig>  and performed a series of genetic and metabolic studies to examine these relationships.

rt-pcr characterization of the lpcat <dig>  lpcat <dig> and dgat <dig>  mutants
in addition to the wt and as <dig> lines, we selected accession lines with putative mutations in lpcat <dig> and lpcat <dig>  and characterized each of the individual mutants using rt-pcr to confirm the transcript phenotype of each line. as shown in figure  <dig>  in the putative lpcat <dig> mutant the ca  <dig> bp transcript was absent, but it was amplified in the control  sample, indicating that the mutant at1g <dig> is indeed a knockout for the lpcat <dig> gene. similarly as shown in figure 5b, lane  <dig>  the band amplified for the lpcat <dig> transcript is absent in the putative lpcat <dig> mutant, but present in the wt and as <dig> mutant  confirming that line at1g <dig> is a knockout for the lpcat <dig> gene. as expected, both the wt and the lpcat <dig> mutant samples are positive for the wt dgat <dig> amplicon . as shown in figure 5a, lane  <dig>  the as <dig> mutant dgat <dig> transcript is present, encoding the in-frame exon  <dig>  27-amino acid repeat, the amplified fragment being  <dig> bp larger than that found in the wt and in the lpcat <dig> mutant. however, as demonstrated in figure  <dig> and discussed above, though present, we have very strong evidence from yeast expression studies that the mutant dgat <dig> encoded by this transcript is non-functional.

metabolic studies
we performed in vitro lpcat assays in a time course incubation of protein fractions from as <dig> and wt mid-developing seed, in the presence of sn- <dig> palmitoyl- <dig> h lpc +  <dig> c-18:1-coa and followed the  <dig> h and  <dig> c labeling patterns in pc. as shown in figure 6a the  <dig> h accumulation pattern indicated that tritiated pc was rapidly synthesized from  <dig> h lpc at a rate that was  <dig> -fold higher in as <dig> than wt within  <dig> min. based on the proportion of sn- <dig>  <dig> c oleoyl moieties incorporated into pc, the lpcat activity was consistently 40-60% higher in as <dig> at all time points . equally, the proportion of 3h in lpc concomitantly decreased in as <dig> relative to wt over this period . this indicated that in as <dig>  the lpcat activity was strongly enhanced relative to wt.

we also performed an in vivo feeding study wherein we supplied  <dig> c acetate to bolted stems containing pods with mid-developing seeds of both as <dig> and wt plants, and then analyzed the label patterns in various lipid fractions in the mid-developing seeds after a chase period of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h. two major differences were immediately obvious : as <dig> showed a higher relative incorporation of  <dig> c into pc and a lower relative incorporation of  <dig> c into tag over the time course. these trends were entirely consistent with an elevated lpcat activity and reduced tag synthesis in as <dig> as shown in the in vitro lpcat  and dgat <dig>  assays.

based on these trends we were confident that in addition to dgat <dig> and pdat <dig>  lpcat plays a significant role in tag biosynthesis, and postulated that it is important not only for membrane development and acyl turnover therein, but also to replenish the supply of pc for pdat1-catalyzed tag biosynthesis in the developing seed. to resolve this question we needed to study what occurs when both dgat <dig> and lpcat expression are co-disrupted.

genetic crosses
it had previously been shown, following expression in a yeast lca1Δ mutant background, that both arabidopsis lpcat <dig>  and lpcat <dig>  are functional lpcats. in the presence of sn- <dig>  16:0-lpc and 18:1-coa , expressed lpcat <dig> and lpcat <dig> proteins had activities of  <dig> nmol/min/mg/mg protein and  <dig> nmol/min/mg protein, respectively  <cit> .

as confirmed by rt-pcr , lpact <dig>  and lpcat <dig>  are t-dna insertion knockouts for their respective genes, while as <dig> encodes a mutated and non-functional  dgat <dig>  to examine the relationship between these two lpcats and dgat <dig> in tag biosynthesis, we performed crosses of the as <dig> dgat <dig> with the lpcat <dig> or the lpcat <dig> t-dna insertion knock-out mutants and characterized the hemizygous/homozygous and double knockout seed oil profiles.

dgat <dig> × lpcat1
the lpcat <dig> mutant is devoid of any significant oil phenotype compared to its null segregant or to wt . crosses of as <dig>  with the lpcat <dig> yielded progeny homozygous for both mutations. the double homozygous mutant showed normal plant development and seed set. zhang et al.  <cit>  showed that without dgat <dig>  the pdat <dig> route contributed 75% oil in as11; thus even without combined contributions from , the pdat <dig> route could still provide up to 70% oil in the developing as <dig> seeds. in other words, the co-incident loss of lpcat <dig> with dgat <dig> reduced the capacity for pdat1-catalyzed oil synthesis by only 5%.

while oil content in the dgat1/lpcat <dig> h/h line is reduced, it is interesting to note that with respect to seed weight, there is a significant increase  relative to the dgat1/lpcat <dig> null/null control . thus, while there was no penalty in this regard, further study is needed to ascertain which components of the seed e.g. protein or cellulosic biomass of the seed coat) account for this observation.

the fatty acid profile from the lpcat <dig> mutant is identical to that of its null segregant . the as <dig> x lpcat <dig> double knockout lines show an as11-like profile ; the 18: <dig> proportion is about 2-5% lower than in as <dig> alone. the latter is not inconsistent with the fact that lpcats are involved in the shuttling of 18: <dig> moieties to the pc backbone for desaturation by fads  <dig> and  <dig> 

dgat <dig> × lpcat2
the lpcat <dig> mutant does not have a significant oil phenotype compared to its null segregant-i.e. it is similar to wt . the fatty acid composition is essentially identical to wt and to that exhibited by the lpcat <dig> null segregant . when we performed the as <dig> x lpcat <dig> crosses, the dgat1/lpcat <dig> he/h shows only a small reduction in oil content which suggests that when dgat <dig> is partially expressed , and lpcat <dig> is knocked out , there is a reduced capacity for compensation in tag biosynthesis, probably because pdat is insufficiently "fueled" with its co-substrate, pc. in these lines there is a severe penalty on seed development; there are many gaps in developing siliques due to non-fertilized ovules .

relative to the dgat1/lpcat <dig> double null, in the lpcat <dig> h and dgat1/lpcat <dig> he/h lines, seed weight is increased by about 10% . however, the dgat1/lpcat <dig> h/h lines show an strong decrease in seed weight even beyond that observed in the dgat <dig> mutant alone or when the double mutant genotype has dgat <dig> in the homozygous condition, taken together with the seed weight increases cited above for the lpcat <dig> mutant studies, these findings make it very clear that both the lpcat <dig> or lpcat <dig> mutations have a complicated effect on seed weight which may or may not be related to changes in oil content.

the acyl composition of the dgat1/lpcat <dig> he/h lines was again essentially like the lpcat <dig> ns . in contrast, the dgat1/lpcat <dig> h/he lines have an as11-like reduction in oil content which is about 70% of that found in the wt and the lpcat <dig> null segregant . interestingly, there is no developmental penalty in this heterozygous combination and seed set is normal as in the as <dig> background, provided expression of lpcat <dig> is in the heterozygous state . not unexpectedly, the acyl composition of the oil in these lines is consistent with the as <dig> profile .

the results were quite different in the as <dig>  x lpcat <dig> double homozygous mutant. shown in figure  <dig> is a pcr confirmation of the genotype of putative h/h lines # 6-3-10- <dig>  # 6-3-20- <dig> compared to wt, as <dig> and lpcat <dig> lines. as <dig>  and dgat1/lpcat <dig> h/h lines # 6-3-10- <dig> and # 6-3-20- <dig> have the expected  <dig> bp insert indicating they are homozygous for the insertion mutation resulting in a non-functional dgat <dig> , while the wt and lpcat <dig> samples do not. t-dna screening was done on the samples of the same lines to test for the presence of lpcat <dig>  samples were amplified using  or with  primer. the lpcat <dig> and the dgat1/lpcat <dig> h/h lines # 6-3-10- <dig> and # 6-3-20- <dig> have a homozygous knockout of the lpcat <dig> gene. qrt-pcr also confirmed the transcript profile in these two lines for both dgat <dig>  and lpcat <dig>  .). biochemically, in the double homozygous mutant  there is a severe penalty on tag synthesis; there is a 65% reduction in oil content relative to wt: mature seeds have only about 30% oil content relative to the wt and the lpcat <dig> null segregant proportions . without dgat <dig> , recent studies suggested that pdat <dig> catalyzes the synthesis of essentially all the oil which accumulates at 70-75% of that found in wt  <cit> . without both lpcat <dig> and dgat <dig>  pdat <dig> is able to synthesize only about 35% of wt oil levels. thus, the loss of lpcat <dig> strongly reduces the capacity of pdat <dig> to synthesize oil. this suggests a strong link between pdat <dig> and its supply of pc as a co-substrate in tag synthesis; clearly lpcat <dig> plays a strong role in supplying this pc. when the dgat <dig> mutation is homozygous, the as <dig> acyl profile dominates when the lpcat <dig> mutation is in the he condition . however, in both the lpcat <dig> homozygous mutant and in the double mutant dgat1/lpcat <dig> h/h lines, the 20: <dig> and 18: <dig> are slightly increased while 18: <dig> is decreased . it is significant to note that shen et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that an arabisdopsis line transformed with an lpcat1-lpcat <dig> double rnai construct, partially repressing the expression of both genes, also exhibited a 3% increase in the proportion of 20: <dig>  a  <dig> % increase in 18: <dig> and a concomitant 3% decrease in 18: <dig> in seed tags compared to wt. while the current phenotype is difficult to interpret without further study, these findings will be important in future analyses of lpcats in terms of substrate selectivity and potential channeling of fatty acids into oil.

plant growth and development is also delayed in the double homozygous mutant , as it is in as11: the seedlings are small and slow to develop . once transferred to soil, bolting to enter the generative phase is delayed in dgat1/lpcat <dig> h/h , but is normal in dgat1/lpcat <dig> h/he . seed development is poor, as in the dgat1/lpcat <dig> he/h lines; there are many non-fertilized ovules in developing siliques resulting in seed which is visibly reduced compared to that normally observed in wt or lpcat <dig> null segregant . thus, it is clear that some level of lpcat <dig> expression is necessary for normal seed development, especially in an as <dig> background. however, future investigations of this preliminary observation, including scoring of developmental phenotypes and a microscopic study of pollen viability, will be required to confirm a disturbed pollen functionality as a result of the double mutation in the dgat1/lpcat <dig> h/h lines.

summarizing the mutant crossing experiments, in lpcat <dig> × dgat <dig>  oil synthesis, vegetative growth and seed set are severely penalized. compared to the relative oil content in dgat <dig> alone , there is only a 5% further relative decrease in dgat1/lpcat <dig> oil  which suggests that lpcat <dig> is the major determinant and can almost fully compensate for the loss of lpcat <dig>  in contrast, in the co-incident absence of lpcat <dig> and dgat <dig> , relative oil content drops to 30% of wt, which suggests that lpcat <dig> can only partially compensate for the loss of lpcat <dig> with respect to oil. metabolic and microarray studies in as <dig> alone support this hypothesis as lpcat <dig> expression and lpcat activity are up-regulated in the absence of dgat <dig>  in addition, the acyl profiles indicate that any altered oil composition phenotype observed in the lpcat <dig> x dgat <dig> is predominantly influenced by the dgat <dig> lesion. collectively, the data from the crosses of as <dig> with lpcat <dig> or lpcat <dig> mutants strongly suggest that in an as <dig> background, while both lpcat <dig> and lpcat <dig> can contribute to pdat1-catalyzed tag synthesis, it is lpcat <dig> up-regulation , which is primarily responsible for assisting in pdat1-catalyzed tag biosynthesis by supplying an enhanced pool of pc as co-substrate to transfer sn- <dig> moieties to the sn- <dig> position of the enlarged as <dig> dag pool. nonetheless, while lpcat <dig> is the most important for maintaining pdat1-catalyzed tag synthesis in the as <dig> background, the partial over-lapping function of lpcats  <dig> and  <dig> identified in this study require further investigation to determine their relative roles in oil synthesis when dgat <dig> is functional in a wt background.

the recent discovery of a phosphatidylcholine: diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase , encoded by the arabidopsis rod <dig> gene, indicates that the issue of dag-pc interconversion during tag biosynthesis is considerably more complex than previously thought  <cit> . the pdct enzyme catalyzes transfer of the phosphocholine headgroup from pc to dag and is thought to be a major reaction for the transfer of 18: <dig> into pc for desaturation by fad <dig> and fad <dig>  as well as enabling the reverse transfer of 18: <dig> and 18: <dig> into the tag synthesis pathway. in the rod <dig> mutant, the accumulation of pufas in tags is reduced by 40%. however, in as <dig> where 18: <dig> is strongly increased, and notably, shows a strong stereospecific shift to the sn- <dig> position of tags  <cit> , it is unclear whether there is a strong involvement of pdct; were it so, one would expect a more even distribution of 18: <dig> at the sn- <dig> and sn- <dig> positions. however, the strong re-distribution of 18: <dig> proportions to the sn- <dig> and away from the sn- <dig> position in as <dig> suggests that the major shift in positional composition has to do with pdat <dig> catalysis. thus there are still many questions to address with respect to the roles rod <dig> and other pc-related metabolic steps such as cptase might play in oil synthesis in arabidopsis and in as <dig> in particular.

CONCLUSIONS
based on the cumulative results of these studies, in figure  <dig> we summarize our current hypothesis regarding the tag biosynthesis pathway in wt vs. that observed when dgat <dig> is compromised as in as <dig>  when both dgat <dig> and pdat <dig> are operating they both contribute to tag synthesis, but the consensus of recent literature supports pdat <dig> as a major route in arabidopsis. when dgat <dig> is eliminated, the pdat <dig> pathway produces up to 75% of wt oil levels  <cit> . pdat <dig> acylates the sn- <dig> position of dags which are accumulating , to give tag. the acyl composition of as <dig> with highly enhanced pufas and reduced vlcfas at the sn- <dig> position  <cit>  supports the donation of acyl groups, especially 18: <dig>  from the sn- <dig> position of pc to the sn- <dig> position of dag as the major route for tag synthesis in arabidopsis.

this adjustment in the tag assembly route in as <dig> is aided by enhanced lpcat <dig> activity to supply the additional pc required by pdat <dig>  given these findings and the implicit plasticity of arabidopsis tag assembly mechanisms to overcome critical bottlenecks, it will be interesting to determine the relative roles played by dgat <dig> and  during tag assembly in higher oilseeds .
