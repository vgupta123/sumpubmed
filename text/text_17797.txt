BACKGROUND
mammalian nuclei are extremely dynamic organelles. they are structured into domains and contain numerous distinct architectural features related to their function  <cit> . macromolecules important for the cell nuclei are shuttled between the nuclear and cytosolic compartments under the direction of nuclear localization signals  and nuclear exclusion signals  that are responsible for nuclear import and for nuclear export of proteins, respectively  <cit> , through the nuclear pore complexes  <cit> . the nlss and ness are recognized by the nucleocytoplasmic transport factors. most nucleocytoplasmic transport factors belong to the family of karyopherin β protein known as importin-β  <cit> . importin-β is a complex protein carrier and acts as a transport factor for proteins carrying nlss  <cit> , as it is able to function either as a direct carrier or via an adapter protein binding to the typical nlss of proteins  <cit> . nlss are short regions with a high amount of the basic amino acids arginine, lysine, and proline  <cit> . the main classes of typical nlss are  sv40-like nlss pkkkrkv, which are composed of a single peptide region containing basic residues  <cit> ,  the nucleoplasmin signal, which is composed of two peptide regions containing basic residues that are separated by ten residues  <cit> , and  the unusual kipik nls, which can be found in the amino-terminal signal of the mat α <dig> yeast protein  <cit> .

nuclear protein import in mammalian cells requires soluble cytoplasmic co-factors  <cit> . importins associate with their macromolecular cargo in the cytoplasm. they directly or indirectly translocate to the opposite side of the nuclear envelope via npcs and release their cargo. most β-karyopherins bind their cargoes directly, and importin-β is able to recognize cargo substrates without the need for any adaptors  <cit> . however, in some cases, instead of binding directly to nlss, importin-β binds to importin-α, which then binds the nlss. the typical nls is imported exclusively by importin-β in conjunction with members of the importin-α family. many other import signal peptides are basic and are often part of protein domains that bind rna and dna, and these signal peptides can bind in vitro to different importins  <cit> .

important clues to the function of novel and uncharacterized proteins can be obtained by identifying the potential nuclear translocation of a protein  <cit> . in addition, a comprehensive definition of the nuclear proteome will undeniably represent a key step toward a better understanding of the biology of this organelle. this manuscript describes research conducted as a part of the fantom <dig> project, in which the main goal was to decipher the transcriptional regulatory networks in nucleus underpinning monocyte differentiation  <cit> . the fantom <dig> project used a complete catalog of nuclear proteins derived from the literature. although the fantom <dig> project uncovered key features of the transcriptional network, knowledge of a more complete and experimentally derived list of proteins being able to translocate in the nucleus will undoubtedly be of significant impact and reveal additional important interactions.

there are several high-throughput experimental screening methods used to examine the sub-cellular localization of proteins and their nuclear localization: gene trap screening  <cit> , systematic in situ orf  tagging mediated by oligonucleotide-directed homologous recombination  <cit> , large-scale gene-tagging  <cit> , and random cdna-gfp fusions  <cit> . however, these experimental approaches focus mainly on the predominant localizations of proteins and transient translocation of a protein into the nucleus can easily be overlooked.

here, we report the development of a reporter-based system to systematically analyze the nuclear translocation potential of proteins. our system is based on a modification of our high-throughput mammalian two-hybrid system  <cit> . it has two key advantages: sample preparations are mediated by pcr and a quantitative luciferase reporter assay is used in lieu of a read-out. those two features allow for the deployment of an analysis pipeline with enough throughputs to achieve a proteome-scale analysis of nuclear translocation potential.

RESULTS
development of the nuclear translocation assay
we have developed a high-throughput assay to systematically identify a protein's potential for nuclear translocation according to the level of luciferase reporter activity . our system is composed of three constructs. the first construct, act, encodes for a transactivation domain  that is fused with the coding sequence of a domain a and a coding sequence  that we test for its ability to translocate to the nucleus. the second construct, bind, encodes for a gal4-dna binding domain that is fused with the coding sequence of a domain b. the fusion proteins encoded in the act and bind constructs can interact with each other via the selected interacting domains a and b. the third construct, a pg5luc vector containing five gal4-dna binding sites upstream of a minimal tata box, which drives the expression of the luciferase  gene, acts as the reporter for the interaction between act and bind constructs. the gal <dig> dna binding domain sequence used in the bind construct contains a nls that is sufficient for gal <dig> nuclear localization  <cit> . therefore, the fusion proteins generated by the bind construct are constitutively able to enter the nucleus. we designed our system so that translocation of the fusion protein encoded by the act construct depends on the presence of a nls in the target cds; we have carefully engineered the interacting domain a and the transactivation domain ta which are capable of activating expression of the luciferase reporter gene and do not possess any localization signals. therefore, the domain a::ta::cds fusion protein is able to enter the nucleus only if the target cds contains one or several nlss. it interacts with bind via the interacting-partners pair and reconstitutes an active gal <dig> transcription factor that will induce the expression of the luciferase reporter gene . on the other hand, the luciferase reporter gene will not be induced if the cds lacks motifs encoding for nlss .

optimization of interacting partners in act and bind constructs
a key feature of the system is the interaction of the act and bind fusion proteins in the nucleus via domains a and b. this interacting pair, a and b, must satisfy the following criteria: 1) their interaction is well-characterized, 2) both domains are as small as possible so as not to be a limiting factor for the generation of fusion protein constructs containing large investigated cdss, 3) the interaction is easily detected by the luciferase reporter expression, yet its affinity is weak enough that the act fusion proteins are seldom transported into the nucleus by associating with the bind protein, 4) domain a does not possess any nlss, and 5) domain b does not possess transactivation activity.

satisfying criteria  <dig> and  <dig>  we selected tip- <dig> and rhotekin as the domains a and b, in which the reported interaction is mediated by the small domains, the pdz domain of tip- <dig> and the c-terminus sequence of rhotekin  <cit> . further, the interaction affinity between the pdz domain and its binding peptide has been reported as relatively weak   <cit> . we independently confirmed this interaction with the mammalian two-hybrid system from which the method reported herein is derived  <cit> . after we confirmed that the gfp-tip- <dig> expression in mammalian cells is not localized in the nucleus , we decided to further tailor rhotekin. using the mammalian two-hybrid system, we tested a series of gal <dig> dna binding domain::rhotekin mutants fusion in which progressive deletion of rhotekin n-termini, rhot443aa, rhot257aa, rhot111aa, and rhot20aa were co-transfected with vp <dig> transactivation-tip- <dig> fusion and the luciferase reporter plasmid into cho-k <dig> cells. gal4-rhot20aa  was the optimal choice because we could maximize the signal resulting from the interaction with tip- <dig> and minimize the background signal noise .

selection of the transactivation protein
we selected a transactivation domain  to fuse to the tip- <dig> pdz domain that would 1) result in a small fusion protein and not interfere with the translocation potential of the added cds, 2) possess a strong transactivation activity inducing the expression of the luciferase reporter, and 3) not induce translocation to the nucleus except when fused with a tested cds possessing a nls. we turned to our previous protein-protein interaction work in which we had systematically screened for protein self-activity: that is, a protein that when fused to gal <dig> dna-binding domain is able to interact with the transcriptional machinery and induce the expression of the reporter gene in the mammalian two-hybrid system  <cit> . tnnc <dig>  appeared as the optimal choice as it fulfilled all of our requirements .

bind construct and high-throughput act construct preparation
each act construct bearing a cds of interest was created by a two-step pcr reaction. the cds of each target gene was amplified with specific forward and reverse primers  that produce two common sequences tag <dig> and tag <dig> at 5'- and 3'- terminus, respectively . we also generated two common resources of pcr-amplified flanking fragments: the first one containing cmv-tip-1-tnnc <dig> and the second one containing a sv <dig> poly-adenylation site . both resources of common dna fragments were purified prior to use. next, those pcr products were directly subjected to an overlapping pcr where the two common tag-derived sequences were used as margins to connect the dna fragments of cmv-tip-1-tnnc <dig>  the target gene, and sv <dig> . this two-step pcr reaction is performed without any intermediate purification steps, which further enhances the throughput of large collection preparations. the length of the pcr products was confirmed by 1% agarose electrophoresis . using this approach, we could successfully amplify act constructs of up to  <dig>  kb.

to generate bind constructs, we employed a similar strategy; the dna fragments for cmv-gal <dig>  and sv <dig> were amplified from the pbind vector, purified, and used in an overlapping pcr to connect the dna fragments of cmv-gal <dig>  rhot20aa, and sv <dig> .

selection of cells and conditions for the assay
to test if cdss of interest can translocate to the nucleus, we rely on the detection of the interaction between tip- <dig> and rhotekin , both of which can be expressed only transiently. thus, the assay only requires the transfection of pcr products, which is a process that is easily automated and systematic. as a proof of concept, we tested the system using mt1m, a metallothionein protein annotated to predominantly localize in the nucleus, and snx <dig>  a member of the sorting nexin family involved in cytoplasmic trafficking of proteins. the act, bind, and luciferase reporter constructs were transfected into the cho-k <dig> cell line using lipofection. as we expected, we found that mt1m containing act constructs induced high reporter activity, while the induction of the luciferase reporter gene was marginal for the act construct containing snx <dig> cds .

next we explored whether the type of cell line in which we performed our assay influenced the results. the act constructs for mt1m and snx <dig>  together with the bind and luciferase reporter constructs, were transfected into the same number of cho-k <dig> and hela cells. we observed that mt1m shows higher luciferase activity than snx <dig> in both cell lines although cho-k <dig> cells shows higher luciferase counts than hela cells . thus, the use of non-human mammalian cell line  did not seem to impair the in vivo assay, and we decided to use cho-k <dig> cells for further analysis.

large proteins generally translocate to the nucleus more slowly than smaller ones. we therefore evaluated the adequacy of incubating for  <dig> hours post-transfection before lysis of cells in the luciferase reporter assay . we selected three coding sequences representative of a wide range of protein sizes: crip <dig> , nanog , and arnt <dig> , and estimated their translocation after incubation for  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours. we did not observe any significant differences in the read-out intensities or ratios for any of the three sampled coding sequences, suggesting that  <dig> hours of incubation is sufficient for obtaining a robust luciferase reporter gene activation even for large coding sequences.

next, we investigated if the presence of a strong nuclear exclusion signal affected the assay read-out . we made artificial constructs in which we fused the nuclear export sequence  of the protein kinase inhibitor α  to the carboxy terminus of two coding sequences that are able to be translocated to the nucleus : nanog and elk <dig> . we then measured and compared the nuclear translocation of each of those two nuclear protein fusions to their respective pkia nes fusion counterparts. the addition of the strong pkia nes did not affect the nuclear translocation of nanog. in contrast, the addition of pkia nes to the carboxy terminus of elk <dig> resulted in a drastic decrease in the luciferase ratio compared to that obtained with the native elk <dig> act construct. the analysis of the sub-cellular localization of the gfp fusion version of those constructs corroborated the results of our luciferase-based reporter assay. together, those results showed that our assay, as well as the gfp-fusion based assays, may be affected by the balance between the nuclear localization signal and the nuclear export signal of any given sequence.

small-scale validation of the assay
to test the ability to detect the translocation of proteins in the nucleus, we analyzed two sets of genes with nuclear localization reported in hprd  <cit> . the first set was composed of  <dig> genes annotated as nuclear proteins  and the second set was composed of  <dig> genes annotated as cytoplasmic proteins . for each gene in those two sets, we performed the nuclear translocation assay in triplicate and conducted sub-cellular localization experiments by generating gfp-fused proteins. the gene-specific primers used to generate the  <dig> gfp constructs for the sub-cellular localization experiments were similar to those used to fuse the first pcr products of our luciferase reporter system. we then compared the results obtained from our luciferase reporter assay with our gfp sub-cellular localization experiments, hprd annotation, and sequence-based sub-cellular localization in-silico predictions  .

we considered assays reporting an average 5-fold ratio of the luciferase signal with the bind construct co-transfected to luciferase signal without the co-transfected bind construct to represent confident nuclear translocation potential, based on empirical results. eight of the  <dig> genes were observed exclusively in the cytoplasm,  <dig> were exclusively in the nucleus, and  <dig> were diffusively localized both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus when gfp fusions were transiently expressed in cho-k <dig> cells. our mammalian two-hybrid derived assay was designed to detect the nuclear translocation potential of a cds; therefore, we considered gfp sub-cellular localization assay reporting diffuse localization of encoded fusion protein both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus to represent true positive results. though the luciferase ratio was  <dig>  , lgals4-gfp fusions localized exclusively in the cytoplasm. therefore, compared to the gfp sub-cellular localization assay, the false-positive rate was 7% . reciprocally, while dlx <dig> and tlx <dig> appeared to be located in the nucleus when fused to gfp, the luciferase ratios of those two genes were only  <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively. as a result, we can conclude that compared with a gfp sub-cellular localization assay, our system performed with a false-negative rate of 22% .

we also used the program psort ii to predict the sub-cellular localization of those  <dig> genes and compared the most probable localization reported by the program to our assay. again, although we predicted from the results of our assay that dlx <dig> and tlx <dig> are unable to translocate to the nucleus, psort ii predicts them to be nuclear proteins, thus yielding a 22%  false-negative rate when compared with computational predictions. four proteins with luciferase ratios ranging from  <dig>   to  <dig>   were predictd by psort ii to be cytoplasmic proteins which results in a false-positive rate of 30% .

sub-cellular localization annotations reported in hprd agreed poorly with our assay. under the 5-fold luciferase signal threshold that we used to define proteins as able or not to translocate to the nucleus, our comparison of the reporter-based system with the hprd annotations showed a 46%  false-positive rate and a 55%  false-negative rate. it is important to note that this poor false-positive rate was in large part due to proteins for which our assay gave results that were very close to the 5-fold threshold we defined;  <dig> out of  <dig> false-positive results arose from luciferase assay in the  <dig>   to  <dig>   range. thus, under a stricter definition of the cut off for which a protein is considered to be able to translocate into the nucleus, comparisons of our assay to hprd annotations would result in a more reasonable 14% false-positive rate. additionally, our observations of crip <dig> nuclear localization in the gfp-fusion and luciferase reporter-based assays as well as psort ii prediction contrasts with the lack of nuclear annotation noted for crip <dig> in hprd. similarly, the relatively high false-negative rate can be counter-balanced by the observation that 1) both ankrd <dig> and irf <dig> that were also consistently predicted by our luciferase assay, our gfp fusion assays, and psort ii as not localized in the nucleus and 2) tlx <dig> and dlx <dig> were also mistakenly characterized in our assay when compared to our own gfp-fusion assay.

finally for each of the  <dig> gfp fusions, we conducted a quantitative analysis of the distribution of gfp signal located over the nuclear versus that distributed in the cytoplasm. for  <dig> to  <dig> single-cell images per construct, the dapi and gfp signals were used to locate, respectively, the nucleus boundary and the extent of the cytoplasmic compartments. the average intensity of gfp within the nucleus boundary was then computed and compared to that of the cytoplasm. a good correlation between those gfp signal intensity ratios and luciferase activities was observed, providing yet another line of evidence that the luciferase activity measured in our assay accurately reflects the nuclear translocation potential of a particular coding sequence .

to test the capacity of our method to detect the translocation potential of proteins located in the cytoplasm during steady state but known to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, we selected three known cases and assayed their nuclear translocation: gtse- <dig>  <cit> , dishevelled/dvl <dig>  <cit> , and survivin/birc <dig>  <cit>  . we could accurately predict the nuclear translocation potential of gtse- <dig> and disheveled, yielding an average luciferase ratio of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. on the other hand, the average luciferase ratio obtained for birc <dig> was only  <dig> . a possible explanation for the failure to detect survivin/birc <dig> translocation potential could be the loss of its anti-apoptotic property upon nuclear localization  <cit> .

discussion
the assay described here can be used to systematically characterize human gene products ability to translocate in the nucleus. it is easy to prepare samples by designing the gene-specific forward and reverse primers, in which no purification or cloning steps are also required the assay uses a luciferase reporter to directly and quantitatively measure if the easily engineered hybrid protein is able to undergo nuclear translocation. since both the pcr-based sample preparation and the luciferase-based reporter assay can easily be manipulated in 96- or 384-well plate formats, we believe that our system can achieve the throughput required for a proteome-scale analysis of nuclear translocation potential. we demonstrated the validity of our approach using hela and cho-k <dig> cells, but as long as lipofection of pcr products is tolerated, a wide range of alternative cell types can be employed.

while our luciferase reporter system gave results relatively consistent with those obtained by gfp fusion assay, our results did not correlate well with literature-derived localization reported in hprd. perhaps protein localizations that are too often reported in the literature are limited to the predominant localizations of a protein, with minor sub-cellular localizations often hardly accessible to search for location and therefore are poorly described. in addition, methods relying on ectopic protein over-expression to report sub-cellular localization may overlook minor localizations of proteins, or even induce unusual sub-cellular localization. on the other hand, a fusion with tip- <dig> pdz domain and tnnc <dig> trans-activation domain, which our system relies on, may also hamper the genuine localization of the protein. in some cases, the binding of rohtekin to the tip <dig> pdz domain could be altered by the fusion of particular cds, thus preventing the reconstitution of a transcriptionally active bind-act construct and the detection of the effective translocation of act in the nucleus by the luciferase reporter gene. this scenario is probably the most plausible reason for failing to detect the nuclear translocation of tlx <dig> 

methods used to characterize sub-cellular localizations of proteins usually focus on a description of cellular compartments where the proteins are predominantly localized. on the other hand, our system can provide information concerning the localization or function of a gene product that is not apparent from previous studies  <cit> . since this system is able to report the potential nuclear translocation potential of any given protein-coding sequence, it allows for a much more thorough cataloging of the mammalian nuclei proteome. such a comprehensive parts-list is a key element for deciphering the biology of such an extremely dynamic organelle such as the nucleus. the nuclear translocation data accumulated can be cross-referenced with the static protein-protein interaction network or gene expression atlas. our assay also has the advantage of having a quantitative read-out. in order to compare the continuous values reported to annotations derived from our gfp-fusion assays, computational predictions, and literature-derived annotations, we have performed discretization of its outcome and empirically chosen a 5-fold ratio of the luciferase signal with the bind construct co-transfected to the luciferase signal and without the co-transfected bind construct to confidently represent potential nuclear translocation. it is important to note that this minimum fold ratio threshold remains open to refinement, in particular in the light of further experiments with proteins for which the sub-cellular localizations are richly documented. finally, our assay also offers unprecedented potential for scaling up and analysis of nuclear translocation potential under different cellular conditions such as drug treatment, knockdown-mediated silencing, or conversely over-expression of genes involved in nuclear translocation. we also expect our system to be quite valuable for the identification of novel localization sequences in proteins that translocate to the nucleus but have atypical nlss.

CONCLUSIONS
we have described a new method of analyzing the nuclear translocation potential of a given coding sequence. our method can easily be employed in parallelized settings to analyze nuclear translocation potentials upon different cellular conditions and treatments. the major advantages of the method are its ease of use and the scalability of both sample preparation and final read-out. since the pcr-based sample preparation and the luciferase-based reporter assay can be used in 96- or 384-well plates, we believe that our system can achieve the throughput required for proteome-scale analysis.
