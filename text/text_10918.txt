BACKGROUND
rice blast, caused by magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most devastating diseases in rice growing regions worldwide, causing 11-15% yield loss annually  <cit> . genetic tractability as well as economic importance makes this disease a model pathosystem to understand plant-microbe interactions. the genome sequences of both organisms are available  <cit> , and both forward and reverse genomic studies to understand molecular mechanisms for pathogenesis on a genome scale have been undertaken  <cit> . understanding the precise molecular mechanisms of infection will facilitate design of novel control strategies.

the process of m. oryzae infection starts when a conidium lands on the rice leaf surface. after germination by hydration, an appressorium develops at the tip of the germ tube, from which a penetration peg emerges to penetrate the cuticle layer into the rice cell using mechanical force. within the plant cell, the fungus faces two different fates. in an incompatible interaction, resistance gene products recognize corresponding avirulence gene products from the invading pathogen and invoke a series of defense responses to restrict pathogen growth  <cit> . in a compatible interaction, however, the host plant mobilizes defense responses much later, resulting in visible coalescing lesions. from these expanding lesions, a conidiophore emerges, releasing tens of thousands of new conidia able to start a second round of infection. in this respect, the gene products of the pathogen expressed during infectious growth may play roles as pathogenicity factors required for evasion of the host's defense responses and successful colonization. this theory is supported by our previous pilot study in which analysis of in planta expressed genes identified by est sequencing of an m.oryzae infected rice cdna library  <cit> . by sequencing  <dig> randomly selected cdna clones,  <dig> of  <dig> ests could be assigned as fungal genes with sequence similarity to ncbi entries. among them, mhp <dig>  encoding a class ii hydrophobin, was preferentially expressed during infectious growth and was involved in full virulence of rice blast fungus, acting in the late stages of infection  <cit> . we also identified novel pathogenesis-related protein genes that are upregulated in rice after pathogen infection  <cit> . jantasuriyarat et al.  <cit>  performed large-scale analysis of ests during m.oryzae/rice interactions at the early stage of infection. plant defense genes were well represented in this study. however, fungal genes involved in interactions with the host were scarce, primarily because they harvested infected tissue at  <dig> and  <dig> h after inoculation, at which time fungal spores had just started to penetrate. genome-wide transcriptome analyses have also been conducted on this fungus within the last few years through the use of est, sage, and rl-sage  <cit> . most of these studies focused on pre-penetration stages, such as conidiation and appressorium formation, and on growth in a variety of in vitro conditions, including complete medium, minimal medium, nitrogen starvation, and rice cell wall medium. from these global efforts,  <dig>  est sequences comprising  <dig>  uniests of m. oryzae are registered in the dbest of ncbi, which covers about 80% of the genes electronically annotated for this fungus  <cit> . however, our knowledge of the molecular basis of the establishment of disease and proliferation within the plant cells remains limited.

during recent years, studies aimed at cataloging pathogen genes expressed during interactions with their host have been conducted in many pathosystems. large-scale est analysis with cdna libraries from infected plant tissues has been used for this purpose  <cit> . more than  <dig>  fungal genes could be identified out of  <dig>  est sequences from senescent leaves  with lesions containing visible pycnidia. however, few fungal genes could be recovered from fusarium graminearum infected wheat leaves   <cit> , from brassica napus stem segments with expanding lesions caused by sclerotinia sclerotiorum   <cit> , from wheat roots infected by take-all fungus   <cit> , or m.oryzae infected rice leaves   <cit> . low-level representation of fungal genes may be because they harvested infected tissues at early time points. suppression subtractive hybridization was also applied to identify genes expressed during the pathogen's interaction with its host  <cit> . broeker et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici genes by sequencing  <dig> random clones from rust-infected wheat plants subtracted from those of healthy leaves. in this study, we used two complementary approaches: est analysis and suppression subtractive hybridization and subsequent sequencing to catalog genes expressed during rice-m.oryzae interactions at the genome level.  <dig> fungal genes were identified from  <dig>  uniests and their putative functions were assessed with go. we were able to identify  <dig> novel fungal genes specific to infection. cdnas with full-length orfs were used to correct ab initio gene models annotated from genome sequences, and to analyze fungal splice site context.

RESULTS
generation of infection ests
we identified in planta expressed fungal genes by est analysis of a m.oryzae-infected rice cdna library in a previous study  <cit> . seventy-two ests comprising  <dig> unigenes were assigned as fungal genes. to expand our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying plant-microbe interactions, cataloging gene repertoires at a genome-wide level was carried out with two complementary strategies. first, an infection library  was constructed with rnas from leaves showing rapidly expanding lesions. cdnas more than  <dig>  kb in size after gel filtration were used for library construction. the titer of the primary library was  <dig>  × 107pfu/μg vector, and the insert size ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb. sequencing of  <dig>  randomly selected cdnas generated  <dig>  non-redundant ests, of which  <dig> ests formed  <dig> contigs and  <dig>  ests remained as singletons . second, to enrich for fungal genes expressed during colonization and propagation within the plant cells, as well as plant genes induced by the invading pathogen, we used suppression subtractive hybridization technology  <cit> . cdnas synthesized with rna from uninfected rice leaves were used as the driver, while those from heavily infected rice leaves were used as the tester. a total of  <dig>  subtracted clones were sequenced, generating  <dig> nonredundant ests. in the subtraction library , the redundancy of the sequences was relatively high, with  <dig>  clones assembled into  <dig> contigs. when the sequences from two libraries were analyzed together, all the  <dig>  ests fell into  <dig>  non-redundant ests, in which  <dig>  ests consisted of  <dig> contigs and  <dig>  ests remained as singletons . about 69% of these  <dig>  nrests had high or moderate sequence similarity to the entries of the non-redundant database in ncbi through blast search.

 <dig> il means infection library constructed in uni-zap xr vector.

 <dig> sl means subtraction library in which rna from m. oryzae infected rice leaves was used as tester and that from uninfected leaves as driver.

the most frequently represented sequence was contig <dig>  which showed sequence similarity to elongation factor 1-α of the dimorphic fungus ajellomyces capsulatus  <cit> . it occurred  <dig> times from sl and five times from il. contig <dig> was sequenced  <dig> times only from sl, and contig <dig>  showing sequence similarity to senescence-associated protein of pisum sativum  <cit> , appeared  <dig> times in sl and once in il. the repertoire of highly redundant clones differed between the two libraries . in il, genes involved in photosynthesis, such as rubisco activase  and rubisco small subunit c , and plant defense-related genes, such as metallothionein  and pathogenesis-related protein  <dig> , were included in the  <dig> most redundant contigs. only two contigs  of the  <dig> most redundant contigs were considered to be of fungal origin. however, fungal genes made up 50% of the most redundant  <dig> contigs of sl. additionally, after subtracting, genes involved in photosynthesis, defense-related genes including senescence-associated protein , probenazole-induced protein , and metallothionein i  were the most abundant sequences.

annotation of the origin of genes
after initial analysis, the origin of ests was predicted. we took advantage of the most recent genome assembly of rice  <cit>  and m.oryzae  <cit> , as well as the deep cdna sequence resources available for the host and pathogen. est sequences were initially mapped on the genome sequence of both organisms, with  <dig>  ests  being mapped to the fungal genome and  <dig>   to the rice genome . some of the ests were mapped to both genome sequences with the criteria we used . therefore, blastn data against  <dig>  nrest sequences from nine different libraries of m. oryzae  <cit> , and  <dig>  rice full-length cdna  sequences  <cit>  and blastx data against ncbi non-redundant protein database were further analyzed together to assign the origin of uniests. as a result,  <dig>  uniests could be grouped into  <dig> fungal genes  and  <dig>  plant genes . there were still  <dig> uniests of unidentified origin due to the lack of sequence similarity to either organism. the fungal genes consisted of  <dig> singletons and  <dig> contigs from  <dig>  ests, whereas the rice genes consisted of  <dig>  singletons and  <dig> contigs from  <dig>  ests. ests from each library were evaluated in terms of origin of the genes. of  <dig>  uniests  obtained from il,  <dig> uniests  could be assigned as fungal genes, which is  <dig> % of the uniests . for the  <dig> uniests of sl,  <dig> uniests, comprising 40% of uniests, were found to be of fungal origin. the proportion of fungal genes increased to 50% when the raw est sequences were taken into consideration, as  <dig>  ests of  <dig>  ests from sl were grouped as fungal genes. of the  <dig> uniests of fungal origin,  <dig> uniests were il-specific and  <dig> uniests were only found in sl. seventy-five genes were sequenced from both libraries. similarly,  <dig> uniests from sl were added to the  <dig>  rice genes identified from il. we then questioned whether the fungal genes could cluster in the genome by aligning to the current genome assembly. however, infection ests did not cluster, but were rather spread evenly throughout the genome .

the origin of sequences were determined by the searches of rice  and m. oryzae  draft genome sequence, dbest with blastn algorithm at expect value of <e- <dig> and ncbi non-redundant protein db with blastx algorithm .

* proportion was calculated based on  <dig>  uniests.

go-based functional classification
to assess the putative function of the ests, gene ontology  based classification was conducted. fungal and rice ests were translated in six frames, and the in-frame orf sequences were subjected to interpro and go annotation, with  <dig> %  of rice ests and  <dig> %  of fungal ests being assigned go terms. in terms of biological process,  <dig> rice and  <dig> fungal genes were assigned; most were associated with metabolism, followed by cell growth and/or maintenance. nine uniests encoding fungal genes were assigned to cell communications , which contained two class ii hydrophobins , four gtp-binding proteins , and an nadp-dependent oxidoreductase . for molecular function,  <dig> rice and  <dig> fungal ests were assigned, most of which possessed binding and catalytic activity. in the  <dig> rice and  <dig> fungal ests assigned to cellular components,  <dig> rice and  <dig> fungal ests were associated with the cell, and were especially distributed within the intracellular and membrane .

proteins assigned as extracellular were poorly represented in this analysis, although secretion proteins are thought to play important roles in host interactions  <cit>  and virulence  <cit> . thus, we screened  <dig>  uniests for signal peptides using signalp <dig>   <cit> . because most est sequences did not bear a start codon, genomic resources were used. for fungal genes, ab initio annotated protein sequences matched to infection ests were subjected to signalp analysis. in the case of rice genes, where  <dig>  full-length  cdna sequences are available, fl cdna sequences matched to infection ests were translated and in-frame amino acid sequences were screened with signalp. as a result,  <dig> fungal genes and  <dig> rice genes of  <dig>  uniests were believed to have a signal peptide. among these were three hydrophobins , two of which have been identified as secreted and associated with the cell wall  <cit> . ests encoding spore coat proteins  and cell wall degrading enzymes, such as chitinase <dig>  and  <dig> -beta-d-glucan cellobiohydrolase , were also identified.

search for novel genes uniquely or preferentially expressed during rice-m. oryzae interactions
we questioned whether there were novel genes as yet unidentified because the condition used  is uncommon. to identify novel genes preferentially expressed during rice-m. oryzae interaction,  <dig>  uniests were compared with est or cdna sequences of each organism using blast. m. oryzae uniest sequences  were downloaded from cogeme phytopathogenic fungi and oomycete est database . rice full-length cdna sequences  were downloaded from the kome  website. for fungal genes, both cogeme est and infectionest collections were mapped on the m. oryzae genome, and the physical positions on the genome were compared between the two populations. of the  <dig> putative fungal genes,  <dig> infectionests were not contained in the cogeme uniests. these est sequences were further examined for sequences that represent different segments of the same gene present in other libraries to determine if they were truly novel genes. in the case of genic regions represented by two or more ests, these ests were considered to be the same gene. if two or more ests matched to non-genic sequences, they were connected end to end or placed with gaps less than  <dig> nts, these ests were also considered to represent the same gene . through this analysis, we finally assigned  <dig> fungal uniests  as uniquely or preferentially expressed during infectious growth . of these,  <dig> genes were not able to be assigned a putative function through the blastx search of ncbi non-redundant protein database. there were three groups of genes predicted to be functioning during direct interaction between the two organisms: genes involved in nutrient uptake and primary metabolism , cell wall processing , and lipid metabolism . among these novel genes were two different members  for phosphatidic acid phosphatase , which is an enzyme that deposphorylates phosphatidic acid  to generate diacylglycerol , both of which are known to be involved in lipid metabolism and intracellular signal transduction  <cit> . the remaining member  was sequenced from the nitrogen-starved library  <cit> . a gene  homologous to avenacinase, which detoxifies plant saponins to determine the host range, was also identified as expressed in planta. with a similar approach,  <dig> rice uniests did not match the rice est sequences registered in the dbest of ncbi. most of them showed no sequence similarity to the non-redundant protein database, suggesting a unique role during interactions with the pathogen.

expression profiles of infection-enriched genes
expression profiles of  <dig> infection est-specific genes were analyzed by real-time rt-pcr. fold changes  during infectious growth were analyzed in terms of relative abundance  of transcripts during in vitro growth in complete media , compared with the cyclophilin  expression level . analyzed genes were grouped into three categories according to the expression level in cm. expression level of six genes were  <dig> - to  <dig>  fold that of cyp <dig> in cm; three were induced and three were repressed during infectious growth. transcript levels of  <dig> genes were  <dig>  to  <dig> % that of cyp <dig> in cm; six of them were induced during in planta growth. four genes were scarcely expressed in cm, but their expression was elevated in planta. expression of nine genes upregulated more than twofold in planta was further examined during development and in nutrient conditions . expression of f <dig> encoding 3-phytase a was highly induced during infection and also induced more than twofold in all conditions tested. expression of f <dig> encoding aminopeptidase was co-up-regulated during infection, carbon starvation, and in minimal medium, while it was down-regulated during conidia germination. f <dig>  with unknown function, and f <dig>  encoding atp-dependent rna helicase, shared their expression pattern and were co-up-regulated during infection, asexual sporulation, conidia germination, and nitrogen starvation. the expression pattern of f <dig>  showing sequence similarity to avenacinase , and f <dig>  homologous to mads-box homolog umc <dig> , was the same, with induction in planta, in developing spores, and during carbon starvation, and repression in germination and minimal media. f <dig>  with sequence similarity to yeast maintenance protein dam <dig>  had specific up-regulation during growth within the plant cell. three members of genes encoding phosphatidic acid phosphatase showed differential expression patterns: two of them  were up-regulated during infection, but the other  was down-regulated. f <dig> was induced in nitrogen starvation, mgg_ <dig> in carbon starvation, and all three were down-regulated during conidiation and conidia germination.

use of ests in validation and improvement of genome annotation
ests can complement automated genome annotation efforts  <cit> .  <dig> uniests showed no sequence similarity to ab initio annotated gene sequences, but matched the genome assembly. these loci can now be re-annotated as genes. blastx results against the ncbi non-redundant protein database were carefully examined for ests that matched from a start codon to search for ests having full-length cdna sequences. among the  <dig> fungal genes,  <dig> uniests were found to have full-length orfs through analysis of blastx results. these include genes uniquely identified from the infection est, including genes encoding cytochrome p <dig> , co-chaperone , and alcohol dehydrogenase  . representative clones were retrieved, and entire inserts were sequenced using primer walking. it is possible that polymorphisms may be found by comparing the cdna sequences to the genome, because our cdna sequences were derived from m. oryzae strain kj <dig>  not strain 70- <dig>  which was used for genome sequencing; however, on average, the two strains are more than 99% identical in exon regions. of  <dig> genes compared, eight had single nucleotide polymorphisms, and  <dig> bases out of  <dig>  nucleotides  compared were different between two strains in the exon region . next, full-length cdna sequences were compared with genome sequences comprising each locus and orf sequences automatically annotated from the genome. the average orf length translated from cdna sequences was  <dig> bases . there were discrepancies between ab initio genome annotation and full-length cdna in  <dig> of  <dig> clones , suggesting incorrect annotation or the possibility of alternative splicing. there were five types of mis-annotation . one group had long n-terminal extensions in the electronic annotation, compared with coding sequences  inferred from cdna sequences. in the second group, electronic annotations revealed relatively short cds in which the start codon resided in an intron or in the middle of coding regions of cdna sequences. in four cases, the electronically annotated locus had long c-terminal extensions due to erroneous splicing. another group of loci started at the same site of cdna, but had another intron in the cdna, resulting in short orfs. these sequences did not seem to be the splicing variant between fungal strains, because ests from strain 70- <dig> in which the genome sequence was revealed matched exactly with our cdna sequences. in these four cases, electronic annotations started and stopped at the exact sites, but depicted other internal exon-intron boundaries. these analyses showed that, in most cases, erroneous splicing was attributed to mis-annotation. therefore, the splicing site context of the m.oryzae genome was further analyzed using full-length cdna sequences.

splicing site context
fungal gene expression, as in higher eukaryotes, accompanies accurate splicing via the coordinated efforts of a spliceosome. cis elements, consisting of the 5'- and 3'-splice sites, have been found universally to be predominantly gu and ag, respectively, the branch point a and surrounding motif, and polypyrimidine tracts  <cit> . these fl-cdna sequences were also used to identify accurate exon-intron boundaries and conserved intron cis elements in m.oryzae.  <dig> intron sequences from  <dig> genes were extracted by aligning ests to genomic sequences, and these intron sequences with adjacent exon sequences were examined for correct splicing. the mean intron length was  <dig> nucleotides . all but one intron examined had the canonical 5'gu...ag3' donor acceptor splicing site pair. the consensus sequences for the region of the 5'-ss, branch site, and 3'-ss are shown as a component of the structure logos in fig. 6b. the 5'ss consensus sequence was found to be ng|gurmgy, which is more degenerate than ng|guragu, a filamentous fungal consensus sequence suggested by kupfer et al.  <cit> . the 3'ss consensus sequence was yag, which is characteristic of metazoans. more than 98% of the introns appeared to have a potential branch site, a key intron element required for lariat formation during the splicing process, according to icat.pl script. the consensus sequences could be derived to be rcuray, where the underlined a is the branch point. this is consistent with the results of kupfer et al.  <cit> . the branch point a could be localized to a position between  <dig> and  <dig> nt from the 3'-end of the intron, in which most of them  were localized between  <dig> and  <dig> nt. polypyrimidine tracts, another conserved element in mammalian introns, which function as a binding site for spliceosomal protein u2af <dig>  were also found in most introns  screened in this study. about 43% of them were only located from the 5'ss to the branch point, and  <dig> % were located on both sides of the branch point. these results are also in agreement with kupfer et al.  <cit> .

discussion
fungal genes expressed during infectious growth within their host and plant genes expressed after attack by their pathogen may have important role in virulence and defense responses. in this study, we identified  <dig>  uniests expressed during rice-m. oryzae interactions using two complementary approaches. the first approach was est analysis  of blast fungus-infected rice leaves with rapidly expanding typical blast lesions. we harvested leaves with typical lesions and collected these daily from  <dig> days after inoculation.  <dig>  uniests were identified from the est analysis. the second strategy was using ssh  to enrich fungal genes and rice genes, whose expression was induced during interactions, resulting in the generation of  <dig> uniests.

fungal genes expressed during infectious growth were identified
cdna libraries were constructed with rna from rice leaves infected with rice blast fungus. thus, pathogen genes, as well as host plant genes expressed during their interaction, were contained in these libraries. assigning the origin of ests can be complex. the g+c content was successfully used to identify oomycete genes from soybean genes infected with phytophthora sojae  <cit> ; however, this approach is not applicable for pathosystems involving ascomycete fungi. sequence similarity to previously identified genes is widely used as a major criterion to distinguish their origin  <cit> . however, ests that did not show significant sequence similarity to database entries could not be annotated. this ranged from 30% to more than 40% of ests, depending on the organism. we could not identify the origin of  <dig> % of ests in our previous study  <cit> . li et al.  <cit>  adapted codon usage pattern as a subsidiary tool to differentiate sclerotinia sclerotiorum genes from brassica napus genes. however, rice and m. oryzae genes do not show significant differences in their codon usage pattern when we analyzed full-length cdna sequences . in this study, we took advantage of genome sequences and many est sequences of both organisms to distinguish the origin of the ests. with the blastx results against ncbi nr, blastn data against genomic and est sequences of both organisms, 99% of uniests could be annotated for their origin . among these,  <dig> uniests were identified as fungal genes, comprising 31% of the  <dig>  uniests.  <dig> uniests  were from the infected library, comprising 24% of the uniests , and  <dig> uniests were added from the subtraction library.

a relatively high proportion of ests were of fungal origin. this result is consistent with our previous study  <cit> , where about  <dig> % of uniests were believed to be fungal genes. interaction transcriptome  <cit>  approaches have been used for understanding molecular mechanisms of defense and/or pathogenicity in a variety of pathosystems  <cit> . however, only a limited number  of fungal genes were identified. this is primarily because previous authors used plant material at early stages of infection, or partially resistant host cultivars. jantasuriyarat et al.  <cit>  analyzed  <dig>  ests from eight cdna libraries including six constructed from rice leaves infected with rice blast fungus, and found only four fungal genes. they collected rice leaves at  <dig> and  <dig> h after blast fungus inoculation, which are the very early stages of infection when fungal conidia have just germinated or just started to penetrate into rice epidermal cells. talbot et al.  <cit>  estimated fungal biomass to be 10% at  <dig> h after inoculation, at which time lesions start to appear. recovering a high portion of fungal genes in this study might be attributed to the leaf material from which total rna was isolated. we collected diseased leaves at late stages of infection daily up to  <dig> days after inoculation, when the whole leaf blade was covered with expanding lesions and had started to wither. thus, fungal genes found comprised 27% of uniests in the infection library; this result was not unexpected. these fungal genes will provide a good resource to understand fungal pathogenicity, especially at later stages of infection.

subtraction efficiency is high
 <dig> % of fungal genes  were obtained from a subtraction library. 50%  of the ests from the subtraction library were identified as fungal genes. we used uninfected rice rna as a driver to enrich fungal genes as well as rice genes that were up-regulated on fungal infection. gilleroux and osbourn  <cit>  used two driver cdna populations  to subtract cdnas from g.graminis-infected wheat roots. however, they did not identify any fungal gene using this strategy, possibly because fungal genes comprise a low proportion of infected root tissue and/or the fungal genes expressed during plant infection are also expressed during growth in vitro, to be subtracted out by the fungal driver. using uninfected plant rna as a driver turned out to be a useful strategy to identify candidate fungal genes to be functionally characterized. in addition to cataloging fungal genes expressed during infection, we could identify suites of rice genes encoding abc transporter families specifically obtained from the subtraction library. forty-two ests  showed sequence similarity to  <dig> different abc transporter families, of which  <dig> ests were from the subtraction library. seventeen ests encoded pdr <dig>  expression of which is induced by environmental stresses, such as heavy metals, hypoxic stress, and redox perturbations  <cit> . direct evidence for a role of abc transporters in plant defense was obtained from the study of nppdr <dig> , a plasma membrane pdr type abc transporter of nicotiana plumbaginifolia, which was induced by the elicitor analog sclareolide, sclareol, a virulent strain of pseudomonas syringe pv. tabaci and by non-pathogenic pseudomonads, p. fluorescens and p.marginalis pv marginalis  <cit> , and is believed to be involved in the secretion of the antimicrobial diterpene, sclareol  <cit> . transgenic plants in which nppdr <dig> expression was prevented by rna interference showed reduced resistance to the fungal pathogen botrytis cinerea  <cit> . thus, abc transporters identified in this study may play a role in rice defense against the invading fungus. these results lead us to suggest that various materials toxic to plant cells might be excreted from invading fungal cells into the plant cytosol, and that plant cells struggle to pump out and/or detoxify these deleterious materials. this was further supported by the fact that a high proportion  of in planta expressed fungal genes encoded proteins with a signal peptide.

there was little overlap in the fungal genes identified from the two libraries in terms of uniest. this may be attributed to the low depth of coverage in this study. another explanation may be drawn if we consider the number of total ests, as most overlapped sequences are highly redundant so that  <dig> ests comprised  <dig> uniests.

novel genes identified
although est collections form the foundation for various genome-scale experiments within as yet unsequenced genomes  <cit> , they provide valuable information for gene discovery, genome annotation, and expression profiles, even in organisms where the genome sequence is available. they have also been successfully applied to identify genes expressed during the interaction of the plant pathogen with its host  <cit> . although  <dig>  uniests of m. oryzae from nine different libraries  <cit>  were already available, we found  <dig> previously unidentified unigenes through analysis with strict criteria. this exactly identified 14% of the  <dig> fungal genes. sixty seven unigenes were sequenced from the infection library, while  <dig> genes were added from the subtraction library. the nine libraries that ebbole et al.  <cit>  used were constructed with rna covering the fungal life cycle, including conidia, appressoria forming germlings, and mixed culture undergoing mating, which are stress conditions thought to mimic the environment the fungus might encounter in nature, such as rice cell walls, complete medium, minimal medium, nitrogen starvation, and mixed stress conditions, and mycelia from mutants that could not elaborate the infection structure, the appressorium. nutrient starvation, especially nitrogen-deprived conditions, is regarded as an environmental cue for the fungus to infect the plant  <cit> . m. oryzae secrets proteins that cause senescence of rice leaves, reminiscent of the symptoms caused by the fungus itself when it is under nitrogen starvation  <cit> . npr <dig> and npr <dig>  nitrogen-regulatory genes non-allelic to nut <dig>  were reported to positively regulate both nitrogen metabolism and pathogenicity  <cit> . however, many genes were newly identified only from in planta ests, indicating that the repertories of genes expressed during infectious growth and under nutrient stress might differ, and that nutrient stress might not fully represent the conditions that the fungus would meet within the plant cell, as suggested in our previous work  <cit> .

resources for improvement of genome annotation
ests can be used in gene discovery and genome annotation. of  <dig> ests from this study,  <dig>  did not match any electronically annotated gene. these sequences will help in further correction of genome annotations. validation of genome annotation could further be confirmed by comparing full-length cdna sequences with genome sequences. full-length or near full-length cdna encompassing the complete orf can serve as a valuable resource for accurate genome annotation and functional analysis. large-scale full-length cdna sequencing projects with the aim of identifying the complete transcriptome have been conducted and used for improving genome annotation in many model organisms, including arabidopsis thaliana  <cit>  and rice  <cit> , as well as humans  <cit>  and mice  <cit> . for example, 32% of the first version of the arabidopsis gene model was found to be inaccurately annotated, of  <dig>  genes having fl-cdna sequences, and was improved by incorporation of fl-cdna sequences  <cit> . the rice genome community has recognized the value of fl-cdna sequences and deep est resources, and acquired more than  <dig>  fl-cdna clones prior to completion of the genome sequence  <cit> . few efforts have been made to collect and use full-length cdna sequences in filamentous fungi, in which targeted gene deletion mutants could readily be obtained by homologous recombination due to the haploid nuclear status. however, full-length cdna sequences from filamentous fungi still have the same significance for accurate genome annotation, functional analysis, and for proteomics as in other eukaryotes, because fungal genomes are also interspersed with non-coding dna sequences. in this respect, full-length cdna clones acquired in this study could be a valuable resource for the community. of  <dig> full-length cdnas,  <dig>  showed different gene structures from the ab initio annotated gene model. electronic annotation started at different positions in  <dig> cases and erroneously stopped in eight cases, resulting in longer or shorter orfs. in the remaining cases, electronic annotation started and stopped at the exact sites, but depicted erroneous internal exonintron boundaries. in most cases, erroneous splicing was attributed to the wrong gene model. the intron cis elements  were also conserved in the m. oryzae genome, and were consistent with results for other filamentous fungi, with more degenerate 5'-splice sites, as suggested by kupfer et al.  <cit> . these results can be used to further improve genome annotation.

in summary, genome-wide identification of genes expressed during the interaction between rice and the invading fungal pathogen m. oryzae was carried out and resulted in cataloging of  <dig>  uniests. more than  <dig> fungal genes were identified, of which  <dig> genes were newly identified in this study, and more than  <dig> genes with full-length orf sequences were used to validate the genome annotation. further characterization of the genes reported here will help to unravel the mechanisms of pathogenicity, especially at later stages of infection, as well as the defense responses of the host plant.

CONCLUSIONS
infection of plants by pathogens and the subsequent disease development are accompanied by substantial changes in the physiology of both partners. analysis of genes expressed during these interactions represents a powerful strategy to obtain insights into the molecular events underlying these changes. here, we used two complementary strategies, est and ssh, to catalog genes during a compatible rice and blast fungus interaction at late stages of infection. fungal genes constituting as many as 30% of uniests, as well as plant defense genes, were identified. we identified  <dig> previously unreported fungal genes despite the wealth of genome resources on this fungus. additionally, whole sequences from clones having full-length cdnas were determined by primer walking, which was used to verify the ab initio annotated gene model of m. oryzae genome sequences and splicing context analysis. taken together, the data obtained in this study will serve as a valuable resource to expand our understanding of genome organization and molecular aspects during rice m. oryzae interactions.
