BACKGROUND
in the united states, prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer in men and is the second most deadly cancer in men killing more than  <dig>  annually  <cit> . nearly one in six men will develop prostate cancer at some point in their life, with the majority of incidences occurring after the age of  <dig>  the major biomarker for prostate cancer diagnosis is prostate specific antigen , however, the sensitivity and specificity of the psa assay is limited  <cit> . improved biomarkers will result from a better understanding of molecular mechanisms that regulate this disease.

global gene expression analyses have led to a better understanding of growth control of prostate cancer cells  <cit> . ongoing studies identified more than  <dig> genes predominantly expressed in prostate cancer epithelial cells  <cit>  and included genes likely to influence growth of prostate cancer cells, such as growth factors, growth factor receptors and tfs . two of the tfs identified in the prostate cancer epithelial cells were the wilms tumor gene  and the early growth response gene , zinc finger transcription factors that bind at g-rich promoters of genes that regulate growth. in fact, the wt <dig> tf binds at several g-rich sites , including the egr <dig> consensus binding site gcgggggcg  <cit> . both wt <dig> and egr <dig> have been identified in prostate cancer cells, although their function in prostate epithelium is unknown  <cit> . wt <dig> has an essential role in the normal development of the urogenital system and has been shown to suppress transcription of the promoters of many important growth factors  <cit> .

while identifying prostate growth control pathways potentially regulated by wt <dig>  we have focused our studies on candidate genes belonging to known growth regulatory pathways. we have previously described wt <dig> regulation of the androgen receptor  and vascular endothelial growth factor  gene promoters  <cit> . to go beyond the candidate genes approach and identify novel gene targets coordinately expressed with wt <dig> in tumor epithelial cells, a more systematic and unbiased high-throughput computational approach was used. these in silico analyses were based on  <dig> genes expressed in prostate cancer epithelium that were likely to influence growth of prostate cancer cells. putative tfbs were computationally predicted; however, the identification of functional tfbs is a challenge and requires an alternative approach. availability of complete genomic sequence from multiple species allows identification of evolutionary conserved elements, e.g. cis-regulatory elements. functionally important elements are likely to experience purifying selection pressure  <cit> , thus, we can utilize the degree of evolutionary conservation to identify tfbs that are likely to be functional. our approach was to identify regions  evolutionary conserved across multiple mammalian genomes, including those separated by  <dig> million years   <cit> . overall, this targeted approach identified important candidate binding elements in genes coordinately expressed with wt <dig> in prostate cancer epithelial cells. identifying genes regulated by zinc finger tfs expressed in prostate cancer cells will enhance understanding of the altered pathways in these tumor cells and provide useful biomarkers for prostate cancer progression.

RESULTS
evolutionary conservation analysis: tfbs conserved in prostate cancer growth genes
genomic sequences of proximal promoter regions of  <dig> genes expressed in prostate cancer epithelial cells  were analyzed to determine the degree of evolutionary conservation and to identify potentially important regulatory regions. binding sites for six tfs  were investigated for evolutionary conservation over a range of eight different mammalian species  . tables  <dig> and  <dig> highlight  <dig> of these genes whose promoter sequences could be aligned in at least five mammalian species  and were found to have at least one evolutionary conserved tfbs.

among the tfbs investigated, wt <dig>  egr <dig> and sp <dig> sites showed the highest frequency of evolutionary conservation in the gene promoters surveyed. for example, the promoters of egr <dig>  gata <dig> and wt <dig> were found to have multiple wt <dig>  egr <dig> and sp <dig> candidate binding sites that were conserved through multiple species . in the egr <dig> promoter, 50% of wt <dig> sites are conserved between human and primates. additionally, in the gata <dig> gene promoter, 94% of wt <dig> sites, 70% of sp <dig> sites, and 100% of egr <dig> sites are conserved between human and other primates . similarly, in the wt <dig> gene promoter 50% of sp <dig>  43% of wt <dig> and 100% of egr <dig> sites are conserved between human and other primates . wt <dig>  egr <dig>  and sp <dig> tfbs within the promoters of igfbp <dig>  klk <dig>  npy, sox <dig>  sox <dig>  and tfap2c are also conserved between human and other primates .

importantly, for the wt <dig> and egr <dig> gene promoters this conservation extended into the marsupials . the egr <dig> gene promoter is relatively conserved between human and opossum with 20% of predicted egr <dig>  12% of predicted wt <dig> and 14% of predicted sp <dig> sites conserved between human and opossum. similarly, the wt <dig> gene promoter exhibited conservation between human and opossum, with 33% of predicted sp <dig> and 14% of predicted wt <dig> sites shared between human and opossum. in the gata <dig> promoter only 12% of predicted wt <dig> sites are shared between human and opossum . overall, tfbs for the three tf  were evolutionary conserved between human and the distantly related species, opossum, in seven different promoters .

tables  <dig> and  <dig> show that there were fewer sp <dig>  ap <dig> and gata <dig> than wt <dig>  egr <dig> and sp <dig> tfbs in the  <dig> gene promoters analyzed. while evolutionary conservation between primates was similar for all six tfbs, conservation between human and rodents diminished for sp <dig> and ap <dig> tfbs. ap <dig> sites in the promoters of the gata <dig>  wt <dig>  and npy genes showed 25% to 100% conservation between human and other primates. conservation of ap <dig> sites was the strongest in the npy gene promoter as these sites are also conserved between human and opossum . in addition to conservation of gc-rich tfbs, the at-rich gata <dig> binding sites were shown to be highly conserved in several gene promoters including sox <dig>  egr <dig>  igfbp <dig> and npy . all of the gata <dig> sites in these four promoters are conserved between human and chimpanzee, and for the sox <dig> gene promoter this strong conservation extends to rodents as well.

the overall evolutionary conservation of predicted tfbs of these  <dig> different genes expressed in prostate cancer cells was analyzed. as would be expected, conservation of tfbs decreased as species became more evolutionarily divergent . tfbs were found to be the most conserved among primates, followed by rodents, and the least amount of conservation was found between human and opossum. of the  <dig> predicted wt <dig> sites in the  <dig> genes analyzed, primates had 68% of these sites conserved between human and primate genomes, while rodent genomes had only 15% of these sites being conserved, and opossum only 6% of these sites conserved, clearly showing a drastic drop in conservation as species diverge. this same pattern was shown for the other tfbs that were analyzed, including egr <dig> and sp <dig>  in particular, 85% of the egr <dig> sites were conserved between human and other primates, 26% between human and rodents, and 19% between human and opossum. similarly, there were  <dig> predicted sp <dig> binding sites, of which 62%, 22% and 12% were conserved between human and primates, rodents, and opossum genomes, respectively, therefore, exhibiting decreasing conservation of these sites with evolutionary divergence. thus, with this approach of identifying evolutionary conserved sequences we were able to pinpoint specific candidate binding sites that could be tested for functional relevance.

conservation of overlapping wt <dig>  egr <dig>  and sp <dig> tfbs
several of the genes investigated have multiple overlapping wt <dig>  egr <dig>  and sp <dig> binding sites in their proximal promoter regions. for example, the promoter of the human egr <dig> gene has evolutionary conserved overlapping wt1/sp <dig> binding sites . both the overlapping wt <dig>  and sp <dig>  sites are conserved between seven of eight species compared, and the sp <dig> site is also conserved between human and opossum. a second wt <dig> site  located  <dig> bp downstream overlaps an egr <dig> site  and both sites are conserved among all eight species, including opossum . the promoter of the gata <dig> gene also contained overlapping sp <dig> and wt <dig> tfbs  that are conserved among several mammalian genomes . the wt <dig> gene promoter also has overlapping wt1/sp <dig> binding sites and when aligned with multiple species, one 3' wt <dig> site  was conserved between all primates, rodents, and opossum, thus, depicting millions of years of conservation of this particular site . the sp <dig> site  is conserved between all primates and rodents tested, and overlaps with a wt <dig> site  that is conserved between human and chimpanzee . interestingly, the sequence similarity is so great between human and chimpanzee for this wt <dig> promoter region that no insertions or deletions were observed in either genomic sequence; thus, these tfbs were located in exactly the same positions relative to the start atg codon.

identification of overlapping tfbs in the gene promoters indicated that wt <dig> and egr <dig> may compete for binding. analyses of the promoter regions of  <dig> genes expressed in prostate cancer epithelial cells showed that wt <dig> tfbs overlapped sp <dig> and egr <dig> tfbs, either separately or together. overall, it was found that there were  <dig> overlapping sites in the promoter regions of these genes. there were  <dig> wt1/sp <dig>  seven sp1/egr <dig>  three wt1/egr <dig>  and three wt1/sp1/egr <dig> overlapping sites . these overlapping sites were found in  <dig> of the  <dig> gene promoters analyzed. seven overlapping sites were identified in the promoter region of the egr <dig> gene, and three of these seven overlapping sites are conserved between human and other species. three other gene promoters, gata <dig>  igfbp <dig>  and tfap2c, have three overlapping sites each, with one sp1/egr <dig> site conserved between human and opossum for both the tfap2c and igfbp <dig> promoters. the wt <dig> and klk <dig> promoters have overlapping wt1/sp <dig> and sp1/egr <dig> sites, respectively. all of these overlapping tfbs are excellent candidates for functional testing to determine whether competition for tf binding at these sites results in activation or suppression of the genes they are regulating.

a position numbers are based on predicted tfbs in the human sequences. pr = both primates , c = chimpanzee, m = macaque, ro = both rodents , op = opossum.  <dig> = no overlapping wt1/egr <dig>  sp1/egr <dig>  wt1/sp <dig>  or wt1/sp1/egr <dig> tfbs for that particular gene.

sequence conservation of tfbs indicates a potentially functional wt <dig> binding site in the klk <dig>  promoter
one of the  <dig> genes differentially expressed in prostate cancer epithelial cells was klk <dig> , an important diagnostic marker. sequence alignment of the klk <dig> promoter revealed three wt <dig> sites and two sp <dig> sites, with two-thirds of the wt <dig> and one-half of the sp <dig> sites conserved between human and other primates . given the premise that evolutionary conserved sites are more likely to be functionally relevant, we tested these conserved sites for their ability to bind tf in vivo. pcr primers were designed to flank the region where adjacent conserved wt <dig>  and the sp <dig> sites  were identified . both of these binding sites in the psa promoter were tested by chromatin immunoprecipitation  in hormone responsive lncap prostate cancer cells . since lncap cells express little wt <dig>  <cit> , they were transfected with a green fluorescent protein -tagged wt <dig> expression construct  <dig> hours prior to the chip assay. after crosslinking, the chromatin and tf complexes were immunoprecipitated by both wt <dig> and sp1antibodies, as demonstrated by pcr amplification of the promoter region. wt <dig> and sp <dig> may bind at adjacent sites within the psa promoter or at overlapping sites, since the sp <dig> site overlaps the egr <dig> site, to which wt <dig> may also bind  <cit> . the importance of these wt <dig> and sp <dig> tfbs as candidate binding sites was confirmed by the in vivo chip assay.

functional wt <dig> and sp <dig> binding sites in the vegf promoter are conserved between human and other primates
having tested the significance of identified evolutionary conserved sites, we then asked whether tfbs known to mediate transcriptional regulation would also be conserved. two genes that regulate prostate cancer progression by enhancing growth and blood supply, ar and vegf, have multiple wt <dig> and sp <dig> binding sites in their proximal promoter regions  <cit> . we have previously identified an egr <dig> site in the vegf promoter that binds both wt <dig> and sp <dig> protein in vitro  <cit> , and here demonstrate by chip assay that this promoter region binds wt <dig> and sp <dig> in vivo . chromatin from both embryonic kidney  <dig> cells and lncap cells expressing a gfp-tagged wt <dig> expression construct was immunoprecipitated by wt <dig> and sp <dig> antibodies and amplified by pcr. using primers specific for the vegf proximal promoter region, products ~ <dig> bp in size were amplified from chromatin of both  <dig> and lncap cells . these chip assays also demonstrated selective wt <dig> binding, since an adjacent site  <dig> nucleotides downstream failed to bind wt <dig> in the same assay . these sites were validated as being transcriptionally regulated in several different assays, including luciferase reporter assays  <cit> , so we asked whether they were evolutionary conserved in different species. in silico analyses predicted that an overlapping egr <dig>  and sp <dig>  site and a wt <dig> site  were conserved between primates and dogs, but not in rodents . furthermore, as seen with the psa promoter region, wt <dig> and sp <dig> may bind at adjacent sites or potentially at overlapping sites since wt <dig> also binds at egr <dig> sites  <cit> . both psa and vegf promoter regions contain evolutionary conserved wt <dig> sites adjacent to overlapping egr1/sp <dig> tfbs, to which wt <dig> is also likely to bind, thus facilitating either cooperation or competition between tfs.

similarly, wt <dig> binding sites previously identified in the ar proximal promoter region by emsa analysis and verified to mediate transcriptional regulation in luciferase reporter assays  <cit>  were confirmed by chip using pcr primers flanking the wt <dig> and sp <dig> tfbs . since these binding sites were tested in vivo, evidence of sequence conservation was sought, as described. as shown in figure 4b, both a wt <dig> site  and an egr <dig> site  were identified within the region amplified by chip. this less common pyrimidine-rich egr <dig> tfbs, consisting of tcc repeats, has been shown to bind both wt <dig> and sp <dig>  <cit> , thus all three zinc finger tfs could compete for binding at this site. evidence for evolutionary conservation between human and other primates was limited by the lack of genomic sequence information available for chimpanzee .

discussion
identification of evolutionary conserved sequences derived from comparisons of multiple genomes  has been successful in identifying functionally important regions, including those regions that regulate gene expression  <cit> . however, some regulatory genomic sequences do not appear to be conserved or the level of evolutionary conservation varies between different genomic comparisons  <cit> . importantly, some functional regions have been reported to experience a relatively fast rate of turnover, where the functional significance of the element is retained despite changes at the nucleotide sequence level . thus, it is likely that gene expression in mammalian genomes is controlled by both types of regulatory elements, i.e., those elements that exhibit evolutionary and functional conservation and those that exhibit functional conservation only. moreover, while numerous algorithms are available to computationally predict potential regulatory elements, it is often challenging to narrow down the list of those that are likely to be functional, particularly for relatively short elements such as tfbs. one of the approaches that utilizes evolutionary conservation as a predictor of tfbs functionality is the rvista tool that uses pairwise sequence alignments to identify the most highly conserved tfbs between the pair of genomic sequences  <cit> . another set of tools, the mulan, takes advantage of evolutionary conservation information obtained from multi-sequence alignments of several genomes  <cit> . however, the latter requires the tfbs to be shared among all genomes present in the alignment  <cit>  and may potentially miss the lineage-specific regulatory elements that are absent from some subsets of genomes. therefore, in this work we used tfbs elements shared between some but not necessarily all of the available genomes.

we used evolutionary sequence conservation, as determined by both the multi-species sequence alignments and the in silico tfbs predictions, to identify those sites most likely to regulate expression of target genes that influence growth of prostate cancer cells. regulatory regions with functional importance can be expected to exhibit sequence conservation due to selection. thus, predicted tfbs that are located in the orthologous positions in multiple genomes are likely to be truly functional. our identification of evolutionary conserved wt <dig> and sp <dig> binding sites in the psa promoter indeed supports this notion . as expected, conservation of tfbs decreased as species became more evolutionarily divergent  <cit> , so those tfbs that were conserved between multiple species including opossum are more likely to be functionally important in the regulation of gene expression.

the abundance of overlapping zinc finger tfbs also supported the functional importance of these regulatory regions. thus, we identified many tfbs in potential target genes that were co-expressed with wt <dig> in prostate cancer epithelial cells. evolutionary conserved wt <dig> and sp <dig> sites in the psa promoter were confirmed by chip to bind both wt <dig> and sp <dig> in lncap prostate cancer cells chromatin. although it is a novel discovery that both sp <dig> and wt <dig> bind the psa promoter and may play a role in its regulation, reporter assays are needed to confirm their contribution to transcription. in addition, a wt <dig> binding site known to transcriptionally regulate the vegf promoter  <cit>  was confirmed by chip and found to be in an evolutionary conserved region. interestingly, transcriptionally active wt <dig> and egr <dig> binding sites in the ar promoter  <cit>  were not conserved between human and macaque, although adjacent genomic regions could be aligned between multiple species . this suggests that the ar promoter may have experienced faster turn-over than the vegf promoter, yet remained functionally conserved despite sequence changes at the nucleotide level.

many of the genes expressed in prostate cancer epithelial cells have previously been reported to interact and regulate each other, suggesting multiple potential targets for altered pathways that may lead to prostate cancer progression. we and others have identified gene interactions  <cit>  that are consistent with wt <dig> regulating the progression and/or growth of tumors in the prostate. however, psa was a candidate gene target identified by our in silico evolutionary conservation approach and confirmed by in vivo chromatin binding assays. psa is a member of the kallikrein family of serine proteases and is a marker of epithelial differentiation in the prostate  <cit> . it is up-regulated in prostate cancer cells when compared to normal adjacent tissue  <cit>  and its expression is regulated by the ligand bound androgen receptor   <cit> . since wt <dig> activates the ar promoter in prostate cancer cells  <cit> , this suggests that wt <dig> may directly or indirectly regulate psa gene expression.

in addition to psa, genes that were co-expressed with wt <dig> in prostate cancer epithelial cells and that could potentially interact with, or be regulated by, wt <dig> included gata <dig>  ecad, egr <dig>  and ndrg <dig>  <cit> . gata binding proteins are zinc finger transcription factors that bind the wgatar consensus motif and are expressed in multiple tissues, including endocrine glands  <cit> . interestingly, gata tfs regulate wt <dig> expression, as multiple gata tfbs are found within the wt <dig> promoter and enhancer regions  <cit> . gata binding protein  <dig>  has been shown to be one of the main gata family members expressed in the prostate of human and mouse  <cit> . it has been suggested that gata <dig> plays a role in androgen mediated regulation of psa expression, possibly through interaction with ar, as gata sites are adjacent to ar tfbs in the psa promoter  <cit> . wt <dig> could contribute to gata <dig> mediated regulation of target genes in prostate cancer cells, if wt <dig> also physically interacts with gata <dig>  this notion is consistent with the observation that wt <dig> interacts with gata <dig> to regulate sry gene expression  <cit> . this complex pattern of zinc finger-protein interaction between wt <dig> and gata, along with regulation of wt <dig> expression by gata tf, suggests a potential for wt <dig> feedback control of gata activity.

the wt <dig> promoter is itself a target of autoregulation by wt <dig>  <cit> . wt <dig> is a multifunctional transcription factor; its four major isoforms are formed by alternative splicing at two sites resulting in the inclusion or exclusion of  exon v and/or  a tripeptide  in exon  <dig> that alters the zinc finger dna binding structure  <cit> . while the functions of the various isoforms of wt <dig> are still being discovered, the -kts isoform is a transcriptional regulator with g-rich recognition sequence  <cit> . the +kts isoform is also likely to be present in prostate cancer cells but would contribute to gene regulation via splicing and post-transcriptional gene regulation  <cit> . here we have identified potential target genes with well-described dna binding sites recognized by the -kts isoform and have not assessed the less well understood rna binding sites recognized by the +kts isoform  <cit> .

the early growth response  <dig> gene  is a homolog of wt <dig>  <cit> . although it has only three zinc-fingers, it shares some tfbs with wt <dig>  egr <dig> has been implicated as a cancer suppressor gene and activates genes required for differentiation  <cit> . in human prostate cancer, egr <dig> is over-expressed  <cit>  and in a mouse model of prostate cancer, egr <dig> regulates genes essential for progression of tumor growth  <cit> . since wt <dig> regulates the egr <dig> promoter in vitro  <cit>  it may indirectly regulate other egr <dig> target genes, such as the n-myc downstream regulated gene  <dig> , an α/β hydrolase. in many cancer cell lines it has been shown to be up-regulated by both hypoxia and hormone treatment suggesting that it could be linked to androgen induced differentiation and signaling in the prostate  <cit> . since egr <dig> regulates ndrg <dig>  wt <dig> could either directly or indirectly regulate ndrg <dig> 

while analyzing the homologous sequences of the different gene promoters, numerous overlapping tfbs were found, suggesting competition for binding and differential regulation of these gene promoters. several studies have shown that egr <dig> and sp <dig> tfbs often overlap  <cit> . when egr <dig> binds to a site also bound by sp <dig>  it displaces the sp <dig> "activator" from the binding site and represses transcription of these genes  <cit> . for example, the promoter of ndrg <dig> was shown to be regulated by an overlapping egr1/sp <dig> binding site  <cit>  . it was shown that this evolutionary conserved site was vital in positively regulating expression of ndrg <dig>  <cit> . similarly, our results showed evolutionary conserved overlapping egr1/sp <dig> sites in several other gene promoters, including vegf and psa. in the latter, overlapping egr1/sp <dig> sites were found to be conserved between human and two other primate species .

additionally, wt <dig> and egr <dig> compete for binding at shared tfbs. wt <dig> recognizes and binds to egr <dig> sites on the promoters of many different genes  <cit> . wt <dig> generally functions as a transcriptional repressor when bound to egr <dig> tfbs in the transforming growth factor-beta  <dig>  and egr <dig> promoters, while egr <dig> functions as an activator  <cit> . many gene promoters with overlapping wt <dig>  egr <dig>  and sp <dig> binding sites have been identified . for example, three-way competition occurs between egr <dig>  sp <dig> and wt <dig> for binding and regulation of superoxide dismutase expression  <cit> . however, the mechanisms of gene regulation at overlapping sites, including tf competition, are not well understood.

combinations of adjacent and overlapping egr <dig>  wt <dig> and sp <dig> tfbs conserved between multiple species were found in multiple gene promoters. adjacent sites were found in the psa promoter where an overlapping egr1/sp <dig> site is  <dig> base pairs downstream of a wt <dig> site and in the vegf promoter where an egr1/sp <dig> overlapping site is  <dig> base pairs away from a wt <dig> site. such sites can facilitate synergistic interactions or may be required for inducible expression, as described for ar and gata <dig> interactions in the psa promoter  <cit> . additionally, in the vegf promoter an sp <dig> site adjacent to a non-canonical estrogen receptor  tfbs contributes to hormone induction of vegf expression  <cit> . similarly, wt <dig> appears to interact with er at neighboring sites in the insulin like growth factor  <dig> receptor  promoter  <cit> . these complex arrangements of egr <dig>  wt <dig> and sp <dig> tfbs could facilitate cooperative or competitive binding by these tfs and would have pleiotropic effects on the regulation of these genes. genes with evolutionary conserved overlapping tfbs could be part of a prostate epithelial cell transcriptome regulated by wt <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
genes coordinately expressed in prostate cancer epithelial cells have conserved regulatory elements and an abundance of overlapping zinc finger tfbs. potential wt <dig> gene targets were identified based on tfbs sequence conservation, and the significance of the wt <dig> tfbs in the psa promoter was verified in vivo by chip assays. similarly, a transcriptionally active wt <dig> binding site in the vegf promoter was confirmed by chip and found to be in a region conserved amongst primates. thus, these genes could be part of a novel network of regulatory pathways initiated by wt <dig> and have important implications in the progression of prostate cancer.
