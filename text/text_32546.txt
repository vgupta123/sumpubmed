BACKGROUND
the genus pseudomonas is one of the most diverse and ecologically significant bacterial groups on the planet. the large size and the plasticity of their genome explain at least partly their ability to cope with different forms of stresses  resulting in their widespread distribution  <cit> . the genus pseudomonas includes more than  <dig> species, a number that is increasing in time  <cit> . nearly each year, a new species is indeed discovered, like p. duriflava, p. batumici or p. litoralis for example, isolated from a desert soil  <cit> , the caucasus black sea coast  <cit>  or from mediterranean seawater  <cit> , respectively. due to its heterogeneity, the genus pseudomonas has undergone numerous taxonomic changes depending on the criteria employed for their definition and delineation: phenotypic, physiologic or metabolic characteristics, siderotyping, phylogeny based on 16s rrna and/or “housekeeping” genes, analysis of 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacers  or the use of functional and ecological genetic markers such as oprf, oprd or gaca <cit> .

p. aeruginosa is by far the most studied species in the genus pseudomonas. it is an opportunistic pathogen that provokes nosocomial infection and causes severe acute and chronic infections either in healthy or in immunocompromised individuals  <cit> . other pseudomonas species have been suspected in human infections  <cit> . for example, the very common environmental contaminant p. fluorescens has also been associated to various clinical cases  <cit> . this bacterium may particularly colonize the airways, the urinary tract and blood of immunocompromised patients. recently, some p. fluorescens strains were found to behave as human pathogens, since they have a high hemolytic activity and dispose of a complete type three secretion system arsenal  <cit> .

p. mosselii is a novel species, which has been characterized in  <dig>  <cit> . it has been linked to p. putida clinical strains using 16srdna, oprf and oprd as markers for phylogeny-based studies  <cit> . in  <dig>  mclellan and partridge  <cit>  presented a case of prosthetic valve endocarditis caused by p. mosselii. these authors proposed that p. mosselii should be regarded as a potential pathogen.

in a previous study, we have found that p. mosselii strains were able to adhere and to display a necrotic potential on rat glial cells  <cit> . to get further insights into p. mosselii virulence, we investigate in the present work the cytotoxicity and proinflammatory effects of two clinical strains of p. mosselii  on caco2/tc <dig> cells, the transepithelial permeability of caco2/tc <dig> monolayers and the actin network. the behavior of these bacteria was compared to that of the well-known opportunistic pathogen p. aeruginosa pao <dig> 

RESULTS
cytotoxicity assay
the cytotoxic effect of p. mosselii atcc baa- <dig> and mfy <dig> on caco-2/tc <dig> cells was determined by quantification of lactate dehydrogenase  released in culture medium . the results show that p. mosselii atcc baa- <dig> was the less cytotoxic strain with only  <dig>  +/− <dig> % of cell lysis after 24 h of infection. p. mosselii mfy <dig> exhibited a cytotoxic activity reaching  <dig>  +/− <dig> % of lysis and the cytotoxic activity of p. aeruginosa pao <dig> was higher with  <dig>  +/− <dig> % of lysis. enumeration of p. mosselii atcc baa- <dig> , p. mosselii mfy <dig>  and p. aeruginosa pao <dig> , at the end of the infection period showed that higher cytotoxicity was not due to bacterial overgrowth.

bacterial invasion assay
the capacity of p. mosselii atcc baa- <dig> and mfy <dig> to enter caco-2/tc <dig> cells has been investigated using the gentamicin exclusion test . the results show that the two p. mosselii strains studied can have an invasive behavior with  <dig>  +/− <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig>  +/− <dig>  × 105 cfu.ml- <dig> detected intracellularly for p. mosselii atcc baa- <dig> and mfy <dig>  respectively. the invasive capacity of p. aeruginosa pao <dig> was significantly higher with  <dig>  +/− <dig>  × 105 cfu.ml- <dig> that entered caco-2/tc <dig> cells.

quantification of il- <dig>  il- <dig> and hbd- <dig> secretion
the bacterial proinflammatory effect of p. mosselii atcc baa- <dig>  p. mosselii mfy <dig> and p. aeruginosa pao <dig> was assessed by measuring il- <dig> and il- <dig> secretion in caco-2/tc <dig> after 24 h of infection. the results show that the two strains of p. mosselii studied did not induce significant stimulation of il- <dig>  and il- <dig>  secretion in caco-2/tc <dig> compared to uninfected cells. on the contrary, the infection of caco-2/tc <dig> cells with p. aeruginosa pao <dig> led to a major secretion of il- <dig> with  <dig> +/−13 pg.ml- <dig> .

the human β-defensin- <dig>  was also quantified in caco-2/tc <dig> cells supernatant. the results show that the two strains of p. mosselii were able to induce hbd- <dig> secretion by caco-2/tc <dig> cells . infection with p. mosselii atcc baa- <dig> and mfy <dig> strains led to a major increase of hbd- <dig> production by caco-2/tc <dig> with  <dig> +/−26 pg.ml- <dig> and  <dig> +/−31 pg.ml- <dig>  respectively, compared to the  <dig> +/−2 pg.ml- <dig> basal secretion of hbd- <dig> in uninfected cells. the induction of hbd- <dig> by the two p. mosselii strains was almost similar to that obtained with p. aeruginosa pao <dig> .

transepithelial electrical resistance measurements
the effect of the bacteria on epithelial permeability was evaluated by measuring the ter across differentiated caco-2/tc <dig> monolayers. ter values were measured at the onset of the experiment and at times  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 24 h. up to 9 h after the beginning of the experiment, the ter values of the infected monolayers remained unchanged . after 24 h of infection, the ter values of the monolayers exposed to the bacteria were significantly decreased . the decrease of ter induced by p. mosselii mfy <dig> was  <dig>  +/− <dig> % compared to uninfected control cells whereas p. mosselii atcc baa- <dig> led to a decrease of ter reaching  <dig> +/−  <dig> % and p. aeruginosa pao <dig> provoked a deeper decrease of the ter value . these falls in ter cannot be attributed to damages provoked by acidification of the medium since the ph of the medium remained constant over the studies.

actin visualisation
the effect of p. mosselii atcc baa- <dig> and mfy <dig> on the organization of the sub-membrane f-actin microfilament network was studied and compared to that of p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  whereas the staining pattern of untreated caco-2/tc <dig> cells showed a continuous fine meshwork of microfilaments lining the cell border , the cells exposed for 24 h with p. mosselii atcc baa- <dig>  p. mosselii mfy <dig> or p. aeruginosa pao <dig> lost their normal organization. all these bacteria induced a dramatic disruption of f-actin.

discussion
p. mosselii was formally described as a novel species in  <dig> through a polyphasic taxonomic approach including 16srdna phylogeny, numerical analysis, dna–dna hybridization, thermal stability of dna–dna hybrids and siderophore-typing methodology  <cit> . the several strains of p. mosselii described to date were isolated in hospital and some have been suggested as emerging human pathogens  <cit> . our study aimed at investigating the virulence potential of two of these strains, namely atcc baa- <dig> and mfy <dig>  belonging to the same cluster strongly related to the hospital-isolated p. putida on the basis of both oprd or oprf-linked phylogenies  <cit> . although p. putida species is mostly known for its huge capacity in degradation of numerous carbon sources  <cit> , some clinical strains have emerged, causing infections in immunosuppressed hosts and patients with invasive medical devices. more recently, p. putida has been involved in war wound infection, and should be considered as a potential human pathogen, for a review see carpenter et al.  <cit> .

in the present study, we further investigated the cytotoxicity of p. mosselii atcc baa- <dig> and mfy <dig> strains, and show that they provoked the lysis of the intestinal epithelial cells caco-2/tc <dig>  with a major damage obtained after infection with p. mosselii mfy <dig>  the cytotoxic levels were lower compared to the well-known opportunistic pathogen p. aeruginosa pao <dig> but almost similar to those observed for p. mosselii strains on rat glial cells  <cit> , and for the clinical strain p. fluorescens mfn <dig> on caco-2/tc <dig> cells  <cit> . the gentamicin exclusion test showed that p. mosselii atcc baa- <dig> and mfy <dig> can enter caco-2/tc <dig> cells. the invasion capacity of the two p. mosselii strains studied was similar and lower than that of the pathogen p. aeruginosa pao <dig> 

the bacterial proinflammatory effect of p. mosselii atcc baa- <dig> and mfy <dig> was then assessed by measuring the secretion of il- <dig> and il- <dig> cytokines in caco-2/tc <dig> after 24 h of infection. the results showed that the two strains did not induce the production of these proinflammatory cytokines. we hypothesize that this may serve as a strategy for p. mosselii to escape the immune system. however, p. mosselii atcc baa- <dig> and mfy161were found to strongly increase the secretion of hbd- <dig>  human beta-defensins are known to play a key role in host defense. in fact, in addition to their potent antimicrobial properties against commensal and pathogenic bacteria  <cit> , beta-defensins were demonstrated to function as multieffector molecules capable of enhancing host defense by recruiting various innate as well as adaptive immune cells to the site of infection. nevertheless, some pathogens can be resistant to hbd- <dig>  <cit>  and surprisingly can induce and divert hbd- <dig> secretion in intestinal epithelial cells to enhance its capacity of virulence  <cit> .

the effect of p. mosselii atcc baa- <dig> and mfy <dig> on epithelial permeability was then evaluated by measuring the ter across differentiated caco-2/tc <dig> monolayers. the f-actin cytoskeleton was stained with alexa- <dig> phalloïdin and examined using a confocal laser scanning microscope. we observed that the ter of the monolayers exposed to the bacteria was significantly decreased and that the f-actin cytoskeleton was completely broken. similar results of ter decrease and f-actin disruption were previously observed with many pathogens including salmonella typhimurium, p. aeruginosa and escherichia coli <cit> .

infections caused by multidrug-resistant  gram-negative bacilli have become a growing challenge in hospital  <cit> . in a recent study, giani et al.  <cit>  suggested that unusual human opportunistic pathogen like p. mosselii may probably play a role as shuttles for acquired metallo-β-lactamases resistance thus an antibiogram was made for p. mosselii atcc baa- <dig> and mfy <dig> . we found that the two strains were resistant towards  <dig> of the  <dig> antibiotics tested including the ticarcillin beta-lactam, which could support the above hypothesis.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our study demonstrates that p. mosselii atcc baa- <dig> and mfy <dig> are cytotoxic towards caco-2/tc <dig> cells, have low invasive capacity, induce secretion of human β-defensin  <dig> , alter the epithelial permeability of differentiated cells and damage the f-actin cytoskeleton. these strains are less virulent than p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  but their behavior resembles that of cytotoxic strains of p. fluorescens <cit>  and by thus may be considered as potential emerging human pathogen.
