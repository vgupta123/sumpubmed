BACKGROUND
urinary tract infection  due to uropathogenic e. coli is a common clinical problem, estimated to affect 40–50% of women at least once in their lifetime  <cit> . frequent recurrence is an important characteristic of uti especially among young women. up to 25% of women who experience a first uti will develop recurrent infections within  <dig> months despite appropriate treatment of the initial infection  <cit> .

recent research has demonstrated that uro-epithelial cells from the kidney and the bladder have the capacity to internalise e. coli into membrane-bound vacuoles  <cit> . inside cells e. coli can establish long-lived intracellular reservoirs within the bladder mucosa that serve as a source for recurrent acute infections  <cit> . e. coli encode a variety of virulence factors that facilitate colonisation of the urinary tract, such as fimbrial adhesins  and toxins )  <cit> . in addition, uro-pathogenic strains are usually resistant to serum bactericidal activity  <cit> . of the known virulence factors associated with e. coli, the type  <dig> fimbriae associated adhesin fimh, dr family adhesins and bacterial toxin cnf <dig> have been shown to directly trigger and/or modulate bacterial entry into host epithelial cells  <cit> .

in addition to pathogen virulence factors, complement c <dig> secreted by host cells also influences the ability of e. coli to invade cells and tissues within the urinary tract. studies from our group have shown that mice deficient in c <dig> are resistant to ascending infection and complement can alter bacterial uptake by mouse proximal tubular epithelial cells , a primary target of e. coli during the acute phase of pyelonephritis  <cit> . recently we reported that c <dig> concentration in the urine rises sufficiently during renal tract infection and e. coli are readily opsonised by urinary c <dig>  <cit> . moreover, c <dig> opsonisation promotes e. coli invasion of human uro-epithelial cells via cd <dig>  a complement regulatory protein expressed on host cell membranes  <cit> . cd <dig> was not involved in the binding of e. coli to epithelial cells. therefore, we hypothesised that other bacterial factors may be involved in c3-dependent e. coli internalisation.

in the present study, we examined whether c3-dependent internalisation by host uro-epithelial cells is a general feature of e. coli and studied features of the bacterial phenotype that may account for any heterogeneity.

methods
bacterial strains and culture
bacteria were grown in  <dig> ml of static luria-bertani  broth at 37°c for  <dig> hours to induce fimbrial expression prior to use in experiments. for each experiment bacterial concentration was standardised by photospectrometry at  <dig> nm, and colony number confirmed using serial dilutions and plating to agar plates. e. coli strain j <dig>  was provided by dr. r. welch, . it is a serum resistant, haemolysin secreting e. coli strain that expresses both type  <dig> and p fimbriae  <cit> . cystitis isolate nu <dig> and the isogenic fimh- mutant nu14- <dig> were provided by dr. s. hultgren   <cit> .  <dig> e. coli isolates were obtained from the department of microbiology, guy's and st. thomas' national health service foundation trust, of which, sixteen strains were isolated from urine samples of patients suffering from acute uncomplicated cystitis and fifteen isolated from blood cultures with simultaneous uti symptoms. the urine and blood samples were spread onto blood agar and bromothymol blue agar for the isolation and identification of e. coli. diagnosis of uti was made based on clinical symptoms and more than  <dig> colony-forming units  of e. coli per ml of urine. samples associated with more than one bacterial species were excluded from the study.

cell line and culture
the human ptec line was a gift from professor. l.c. racusen   <cit> . the cells were grown in dmem-f <dig> supplemented with 5% fcs,  <dig> μg/ml insulin,  <dig> μg/ml transferin,  <dig> ng/ml sodium selenium,  <dig> u/ml penicillin and  <dig> μg/ml streptomycin.

sera and complement inactivation
normal human serum  was obtained from  <dig> healthy volunteers. after collection, serum was pooled and stored at -70°c for up to  <dig> months. complement activity in serum was inactivated by incubation at 56°c for  <dig> minutes . complement inactivation was confirmed by loss of haemolytic activity using standard methodology .

c <dig> deposition on e. coli
bacteria were opsonised as described previously  <cit> . briefly,  <dig> × 108c.f.u e. coli were washed and incubated in dmem-f <dig> containing 5% nhs at 37°c for  <dig> minutes. bacteria were washed in  <dig> mm edta to stop further complement activation. bacterial-bound complement proteins were eluted with  <dig> mm sodium carbonate,  <dig> mm sodium bicarbonate  for  <dig> hours at 37°c. bacteria were removed by centrifugation. eluted proteins were separated by 10% sds-page under reducing conditions and transferred to a hybond-c extera membrane . the membrane was sequentially incubated with blocking buffer  at 4°c overnight, rabbit anti-human c3c , and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit igg . the membrane was then developed using the ecl system .

assessment of bacterial binding and internalisation
ptecs were seeded into  <dig> well plates and grown to confluence. overnight cultures of e. coli were adjusted to an od of  <dig>  at  <dig> nm . culture medium was replaced with  <dig> μl of pre-warmed dmem-f <dig> in presence of  <dig> μl nhs or his  and ptecs were infected with  <dig> μl of the bacterial suspension. bacterial contact with host cells was increased by centrifugation of plates at  <dig> g for  <dig> minutes. after  <dig> hours of incubation at 37°c, bacteria bound to ptecs were measured by lysing cells with 1% triton x- <dig> after vigorous washing to remove unattached bacteria. this would include internalised bacteria, but since binding exceeded internalisation by approximately  <dig> fold no correction was made. to assess the number of internalised bacteria, after  <dig> hours incubation ptecs were washed  <dig> times and then incubated for  <dig> hour in medium containing  <dig> μg/ml gentamicin to kill extra-cellular bacteria. cells were then washed and lysed in 1% triton x- <dig> in sterile h2o, and then plated on cled agar plates . the agar plates were incubated at 37°c for  <dig> hours and the c.f.u counted. to investigate the involvement of type  <dig> fimbriae in the complement -dependent internalisation process, d-mannose or glucose was added to ptec monolayers  <dig> minutes before bacteria were added and the internalisation assay carried out as above. in each experiment assays were performed in quadruplicate.

assessment of bacterial fimbrial adhesin expression
expression of fimbriae was determined by haemagglutination of guinea pig  or human erythrocytes in the presence and absence of mannose. erythrocytes were prepared in  <dig> % sodium chloride or  <dig> mm d-mannose in  <dig> % sodium chloride . bacterial cultures were centrifuged at  <dig>  g for  <dig> minutes and resuspended to  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu/ml in  <dig> % sodium chloride. one hundred μl of e. coli suspension was added to an equal volume of erythrocyte solution on white tiles and gently rocked at room temperature for two minutes. agglutination of guinea pig erythrocytes and the inhibition of agglutination in the presence of d-mannose confirmed the presence of type  <dig> fimbriae. p fimbriae were identified by agglutination of human erythrocytes that was not inhibited by addition of mannose.

detection of haemolysin production
to demonstration of haemolysin production bacteria were serially diluted  <dig> in  <dig> in pbs and  <dig> μl  plated onto sheep blood agar . plates were incubated for  <dig> hours at 37°c. production of haemolysin was determined by haemolysis of the sheep erythrocytes producing a clear ring of agar around individual colonies.

presence of the cnf <dig> gene
cnf <dig> gene expression was determined by rt-pcr. the genomic dna from e. coli strains was extracted using a quick alkaline lysis method  <cit> . a single colony was suspended in  <dig> μl of  <dig>  n naoh and incubated at room temperature for  <dig> minutes.  <dig> μl of  <dig> m hcl was added and the lysate diluted in  <dig> μl of sterile water, spun at  <dig>  g for  <dig> minutes and the supernatant collected. pcr was carried out with  <dig> μl of lysate,  <dig>  pmol each of primers ,  <dig> μm of dntps,  <dig> u of gotaq® dna polymerase in a  <dig> μl of reaction buffer . the pcr cycle consisted of  <dig> seconds of denaturation at 94°c,  <dig> minute of primer annealing at 35°c, and  <dig> minute of extension/synthesis at 72°c. after  <dig> cycles of amplification, samples were incubated for another  <dig> minutes at 72°c. a  <dig> bp pcr products were visualised after electrophoresis on  <dig> % agarose gel containing ethidium bromide.

serum sensitivity assay
serum sensitivity was assessed according to the method of miller and robinson  <cit> .  <dig> cfu/ml of bacteria were washed and incubated in serially diluted nhs or his  for  <dig> hour at 37°c. samples of the bacterial suspension  were plated onto agar plates. serum resistance was determined by comparing the number of colonies from cultures incubated in nhs with those incubated in his. serum resistance was defined as killing of less than 50% of organisms, intermediate resistance as killing of 50–99%, and serum sensitivity as > 99% of bacteria killed following incubation in up to 50% normal human serum.

statistical analysis
bacteria binding and internalisation assays were performed in  <dig> replicate wells. data from two separate experiments  was pooled and analysed by students t-test for comparison of two variables, anova with bonferroni post test for multiple comparisons, mann whitney test or fischer's exact test. p <  <dig>  was regarded as significant.

RESULTS
c3-dependent internalisation of e. coli isolates by ptecs
the ability of uro-epithelial cells to internalise bacteria has been recognised for some time. our previous study suggested that the e. coli strain j <dig> can utilise c <dig> to increase internalisation into human ptecs. however it is still unknown whether this is a general feature of e. coli. therefore, we determined whether c3-dependent internalisation by ptecs is seen with e. coli isolates from patients with acute uti.

 <dig> e. coli isolates from the urine of patients with symptoms of acute lower uti  and  <dig> isolated from blood cultures   were assessed to determine whether they demonstrated c3-dependent internalisation. the number of intracellular bacteria was quantified after co-incubation of ptecs and e. coli isolates in the presence of 5% nhs or his. only some e. coli isolates showed an increase in the number of intracellular bacteria after incubation with nhs . the ratio of intracellular bacteria in the presence of nhs and his was used to assess the effect of complement on internalisation . c3-dependent internalisation was arbitrarily defined as a five-fold increase in the number of bacteria internalised in the presence of nhs compared with his. using this criterion,  <dig> isolates from urine culture  and  <dig> isolates from blood  demonstrated c3-dependent internalisation. therefore, by this criterion, c3-dependent internalisation is not a feature of all strains of e. coli, suggesting the requirement for a strain-dependent bacterial factor to act synergistically with complement opsonisation.

the level of c <dig> opsonisation of e. coli isolates
opsonisation of the bacteria by c <dig> is critical for c3-dependent internalisation. following activation, c <dig> is cleaved into c3a and c3b, exposing an internal thiolester bond allowing the c3b to bind covalently to hydroxyl groups  or amine groups  on the pathogen surface. to determine the level of c3b deposition on the surface of the e. coli isolates, we performed c <dig> western blotting using elute from isolates incubated with 5% nhs. the intensity of c3b was comparable in isolates irrespective of whether or not they demonstrated c3-dependent internalisation . therefore, the differences in internalisation could not be explained by differences in the level of complement opsonisation.

virulence factors that lead to heterogeneity between e. coli isolates
three broad classes of virulence factors have been identified in e. coli associated with uti: adhesins, siderophores, and toxins. other factors, such as capsules, lipopolysaccharide and serum sensitivity may also be important. therefore, we examined the expression of these factors in the  <dig> e. coli isolates.

in  <dig> urine e. coli isolates, bacterial virulence factors  were examined to determine their correlation to c3-dependent internalisation . all experiments were repeated at least three times.

the strength of association between virulence factors and c3-dependent internalisation was determined using fischer's exact test.

in fifteen blood isolates, type  <dig> fimbriae were also expressed by all of the isolates demonstrating c3-dependent internalisation  . a greater proportion of blood isolates expressed invasion factors such as p fimbriae and α-haemolysin than urine isolates, as would be predicted from previous reports  <cit> , however their presence did not correlate with c3-dependent internalisation.

in  <dig> blood isolates, bacterial virulence factors  were examined to determine their correlation to c3-dependent internalisation . all experiments were repeated at least three times.

the strength of association between virulence factors and c3-dependent internalisation in blood isolates was determined using fischer's exact test.

effects of mannose on bacterial binding and c3-dependent internalisation
previous studies have shown that type  <dig> fimbriae alone can mediate pathogen adherence to host epithelium and induce pathogen internalisation  <cit> . mannose can prevent type  <dig> fimbriae-mediated bacterial adherence to uroepithelial cells. therefore, we used mannose blockade to study the interaction between type  <dig> fimbriae-mediated bacterial adherence/internalisation and c <dig> opsonisation. assessment of bacterial binding showed that the presence of mannose in culture medium inhibited type  <dig> fimbriae-mediated j <dig> binding to ptecs in a dose dependent manner . 3% mannose also reduced c3-dependent internalisation by ptecs. in contrast the same concentration of glucose had no effect on bacterial internalisation . therefore, blocking type  <dig> fimbriae-mediated binding can efficiently inhibit c3-dependent internalisation.

fimh mediates opsonised e. coli adherence and invasion of ptecs
fimh mutation provided another means of blocking type  <dig> fimbriae-mediated bacterial adherence and internalisation of human ptecs. type 1-fimbriated cystitis isolate, nu <dig> or the isogenic fim h- mutant nu14- <dig> were co-cultured with ptecs in the presence of 5% nhs. as shown in figure  <dig>  a significant reduction in the number of bacteria bound to and internalised by ptecs were seen in fimh- mutant strain compared to the type  <dig> fimbriated wild type strain . this result further confirmed that type  <dig> fimbriae-mediated binding is required for c3-dependent internalisation.

discussion
whether or not complement opsonisation increased internalisation into renal epithelial cells was assessed for  <dig> e. coli isolates from the urine of patients with cystitis and  <dig> isolated from blood cultures taken from patients with simultaneous uti. not all e. coli isolates demonstrated c3-dependent internalisation . this was only evident in 44% of urinary and 20% of blood isolates. complement proteins are present in the urine and their concentration increases significantly in the presence of urinary tract infection, sufficient to opsonise bacteria  <cit> . therefore isolates of e. coli which were internalised more efficiently when opsonised may be able to gain access to a favourable intracellular niche, protected from immune attack and antibiotic treatment. whether these isolates are more likely to cause persistent or recurrent infection has not been addressed in this current study.

we next investigated whether there was an association between a specific bacterial phenotype and increased internalisation when opsonised with complement. all strains that demonstrated c3-dependent internalisation also expressed type  <dig> fimbriae, suggesting that there is co-operation between c <dig> and type  <dig> fimbriae to achieve maximal bacterial internalisation. to confirm the importance of type  <dig> fimbriae, internalisation was assessed in the presence of excess mannose to prevent type  <dig> fimbriae-mediated binding to epithelial cells. only very low levels of internalisation were seen under these conditions, even in the presence of complement opsonisation. therefore, type  <dig> fimbriae-mediated binding is an absolute requirement for internalisation irrespective of c <dig> opsonisation. in addition, a deletion of the fimh adhesin significantly abrogated binding and intracellular invasion of opsonised e. coli, further confirming that type  <dig> fimbriation is required for c3-dependent internalisation.

we could not demonstrate a role for p fimbriae in intra-cellular invasion by e. coli. p fimbriae, and specifically the class ii papg adhesin, are clinically associated with acute pyelonephritis in humans. they bind to galgalβ moieties present in membrane glycolipids of the human kidney  <cit> . fimbrial transformation and mutant studies have suggested p fimbriae can enhance bacterial binding and induce a robust inflammatory response during the early kidney colonisation  <cit> . however, consistent with our present data, a previous study on bladder cells suggested that adherence mediated by the papg did not result bacteria internalisation  <cit> .

notably, the percentage of isolates expressing type  <dig> fimbriae is much lower in bacteraemia isolates than in urinary isolates . in contrast a higher percentage expressing p fimbriae was seen  in bacteraemia isolates. it is likely that 'crosstalk' occurs between the regulators of the different fimbrial systems in pathogenic e. coli. classically pyelonephritis strains are more likely to contain and express p fimbrial gene clusters and therefore down-regulate type  <dig> fimbriae expression  <cit> . this may explain the different patterns of clinical infection caused by different strains of e. coli.

CONCLUSIONS
type  <dig> fimbriae mediated-binding is essential for c3-dependent internalisation. we do not know whether this is a co-operative, synergistic action or the additive activities of two factors. since, fimh alone can mediate intra-cellular invasion, we suggest that the c <dig> opsonisation augments the signalling initiated by fimh-mediated binding . studies to analyse the mechanism by which c <dig> receptor  and the receptors for fimh interact are important to fully understand invasion of human urinary tract by pathogenic e. coli.
