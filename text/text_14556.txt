BACKGROUND
the pharynx is a simple muscular epithelial tube responsible for the ingestion and maceration of food in c. elegans. there are  <dig> cell nuclei from five cell types present in the pharynx: muscle cells, nerve cells, marginal cells, epithelial cells and gland cells  <cit> . the pharynx is sometimes considered to be evolutionarily related to the heart because:  like the heart, the pharynx is a rhythmically contracting muscular pump  <cit> ;  the muscle cells of the pharynx have autonomous contractile activity reminiscent of cardiac myocytes  <cit> ; and  ceh- <dig>  the c. elegans homolog to the homeobox gene nk2x. <dig> that plays an important role in heart development in vertebrates, participates in pharyngeal development  <cit> . parallels between pharyngeal development and mammalian kidney tubulogenesis have also been made based on the similarity of the cellular processes by which these biological tubes form de novo through epithelialization and cell polarity rearrangements  <cit> .

several c. elegans mutants have been reported to exhibit a twisted pharynx phenotype. two of these mutants, dig- <dig> and mig- <dig>  were isolated in screens for mutants with defects in the shape of the hermaphrodite gonad and likely reflect migration defects by the distal tipcells  <cit> . the molecular identity of mig- <dig> is unknown. dig- <dig> corresponds to the predicted gene k07e <dig> a/b, which encodes a large protein of  <dig>  <dig> amino acids containing several egf-like domains, immunoglobulin domains, von willebrand factor type a domains, fibronectin type iii domains, and one sushi domain   <cit> . dig- <dig> likely straddles the basement membrane mediating specific contacts between cells and their environments.

the uncoordinated mutant unc- <dig> also has a twisted pharynx. unc- <dig> encodes a septin, that is a gtpase required for cytokinesis and other processes requiring spatial organization of the cell cortex, and which can regulate actin dynamics as well as form filamentous polymers. interestingly, a mutation in the other c. elegans septin, unc- <dig>  does not cause a twisted pharynx; this is thus one of thefew phenotypes for which unc- <dig> and unc- <dig> differ  <cit> .

finally, the mnm- <dig> mutant was isolated in a screen for abnormal morphology of the m <dig> pharyngeal neurons, and also has a twisted pharynx  <cit> . the molecular identity of mnm- <dig> is still unknown.

the aim of the present study was to better understand the twisted pharynx phenotype and its relationship to extracellular matrix components. our observations suggest that defects at actin anchorage points to the ecm during larval growth cause the progressive twist to develop intrinsic to the organ.

RESULTS
quantitation of the twisted pharynx phenotype
by measuring the torsion lines seen in a twisted pharynx, one can calculate the degree of twist . this is useful because it allows us to quantitatively measure pharyngeal twisting, even in live animals as they mature. we verified the validity of this mathematical relationship using 3d reconstructions obtained by confocal microscopy of pharynges that expressed gfp in the m <dig> pharyngeal neurons . note that the degree of twist in the examined mutants was the same between non-transgenic worms and worms in which rol- <dig>  or dpy- <dig>  were used as phenotypic markers to establish the transgenic lines : these markers therefore do not in themselves affect intrinsic pharyngeal twisting.

twisting was measured from 3d reconstructions of worms expressing pric-19::gfp in their m <dig> neurons, or by applying the equation shown in fig 1a on photographs. besides the pric-19::gfp plasmid, the etis <dig> integrated array and the etex <dig> extrachromosomal array also carry the rol- <dig> transformation marker while the etex <dig> extrachromosomal array carries the dpy- <dig> marker . most twisting pharynges twisted to the left; right-handed twists are indicated with plus signs . the dig- <dig> and mig- <dig> worms fell into two groups: those with no pharyngeal twist, and those with an obvious twist.  <dig> of  <dig> dig- <dig> and  <dig> of  <dig> mig- <dig> adult animals scored did not show any pharyngeal twisting. *only those dig- <dig> and mig- <dig> worms with a pharyngeal were used to calculate the average twist of these mutants.

properties of the twisted pharynx phenotype
we began by studying the mnm- <dig> mutant and found that its pharyngeal twist is first visible post-embryonically and increases during development throughout the larval stages, rather than only in sudden jumps during molting, to reach its maximum during the fourth larval stage . worms heterozygous for the mnm- <dig> mutation also exhibited a twisted pharynx, although the twist was less pronounced than in age-matched homozygous mutants . furthermore, we noted that mnm- <dig> always makes a left-handed twist, . we then quantitated the pharyngeal twisting and handedness also for the unc- <dig>  dig- <dig>  and mig- <dig> mutants  and found that all mnm- <dig> and unc- <dig> animals have a left-handed pharyngeal twist, while 25% of dig- <dig> and mig- <dig> animals have either a left- or right-handed pharyngeal twist.

the double mutants mnm- <dig> unc- <dig> and dig-1;mnm- <dig> showed intermediate twisting phenotypes compared to the single mutants in the pair, and always twisted to the left . this result suggests that these three genes may either interact directly or are involved in multiple steps in a single developmental process during larval growth of the pharynx. also, it is clear that the mnm- <dig> left-handed twist isdominant over the ambivalence in twisting direction of the dig- <dig> mutant, which tentatively places mnm- <dig> downstream of dig- <dig> 

pharyngeal twist is retained in isolated pharynges, and thickened pharyngeal parts resist twisting
we were interested to test whether the force causing twisting is an intrinsic property of the organ or originates from outside the pharynx. tothis end, pharynges where dissected away from the rest of the worm, then allowed to relax in an isotonic medium. they were then scored for the presence and extent of twist.

we found that the pharynx of wild-type worms does not twist when dissected away from the body. conversely, the pharynx of unc- <dig>  mig- <dig>  dig- <dig> and mnm- <dig> mutant worms mostly keep their twisted shape after being dissected . this result does not exclude the possibility that the twist originates from outside the pharynx, but it shows that the twist has become irreversible by the time of dissection. the result is also consistent with the twisting force being intrinsic to the pharynx itself. the pharynx of dig- <dig> and unc- <dig> mutants occasionally straightens  when separated from the worm. it is possible that the rare untwisted examples are due to damage to the pharyngeal basal lamina during dissection. we also observed that the thickened pharyngeal regions  found in the sma- <dig> or pha- <dig> mutants are resistant to the pharyngeal twist normally induced by the mnm- <dig> mutation . consistently, the narrower pharyngeal isthmus and procorpus show greater twisting than the pharyngeal bulbs in all alleles.

the twisted pharynx is fully functional
twisted pharynges performed as well as wild-type pharynges in bead uptake assays designed to measure feeding: there was a similar steady state number of beads within the pharynx  and a similar rate of transfer to the intestine . we also saw no obvious difference in growth rate between the genotypes, and thepumping rate also did not differ between the control transgenic strain , and the strain with the most severely twisted pharynx . electropharyngeograms can also be used to monitor the changes in pharyngeal muscle membrane potential and thus assess the normality of each pharyngeal contraction  <cit> . electropharyngeograms showed no appreciable difference between wild-type worms and mnm- <dig> mutant worms . that mutants with twisted pharynges are otherwise indistinguishable from wild-type worms likely explains why this subtle phenotype has mostly gone unnoticed until now.

pumping is an unlikely twisting force
mnm- <dig>  <dig> days old adults showed no increased twisting compared to mnm- <dig>  <dig> day old adults, indicating that pumping alone is not enough to increase the pharyngeal twist . however, pumping rate may influence pharyngeal twisting: eat-3;mnm- <dig> double mutants have reduced pumping rate and show a slightly reduced twisting compared to age-matched mnm- <dig> mutants . however, eat-3;mnm- <dig> double mutants also showed a 10% reduction in pharyngeal length  compared with mnm- <dig> mutants, and this may have contributed to the decrease in twist if growth of the pharynx is important. mnm- <dig> l <dig> larvae kept in m <dig> and without foodfor three days showed no increased twist compared to newly hatched l <dig> larvae , suggesting that pharyngeal growth may be required for the twisted phenotype to manifest itself. note that healthy starved l1's have a pumping rate similar to controls , and that starvation stimulates pumping  <cit> .

the pharyngeal tendons are pulled by the twisted pharynges
the basal surface of the pharynx is covered by a thick basal lamina , and four rows of 15– <dig> acellular tendinous organs composed of hemicentin and fibulin that anchor the anterior end of the pharynx to the basal lamina that covers the bodywall muscles. these tendons, which have also been called "flexible tracks", have been observed in both c. elegans and another nematode species  <cit> . they are highly elastic and flexible when observed during normal feeding activity, and we call them "tendons" although we recognize that their attributes are not identical to vertebrate tendons. because they could be expected to resist pharyngeal twisting, we examined in detail the nature of their attachment using electron microscopy. as shown in fig. 4c, the pharyngeal tendons are attached to the basal lamina that surrounds the pharynx and project between the bodywall muscle cells in each muscle quadrant, then connect on their opposite ends to the basement membranes running between bodywall muscles and thin extensions of the hypodermal cells, near the cuticle. we used a hemicentin::gfp reporter to visualize the pharyngeal tendons in wild-type and in the mnm- <dig> mutant . the numbers and thickness of tendons was the same in wild-type and mutant, buttheir orientations in twisted pharynges indicate that they are pulled by the twist, resulting in a spiral-like configuration when viewed along the anterior-posterior axis. thus the whole pharynx, including its basal lamina to which the tendons are attached, is twisted in mutants. him- <dig> mutants, with defective hemicentin and hence lacking these tendons  <cit>  do not twist, indicating that lack of the support provided by the tendons is not enough to cause a twist. also, these tendons do not seem to be involved in transferring a twisting force from outside the pharynx since mnm-4;him- <dig> double mutants still have a twisted pharynx .

twisted pharynges have a subtle actin cytoskeleton defect
actin filaments form important radial cytoskeletal structures within the pharyngeal muscles cells  <cit>  and we examined their integrity in twisted pharynges. using phalloidin as a staining reagent, we found that these actin arrays are significantly longer in mnm- <dig> and, less convincingly, in dig- <dig> mutants than in control worms . this is interesting since misregulation of filament length in growing pharyngeal muscles may be a cause of twisting: long actin filaments may be accommodated by twisting the pharynx. alternatively, longer actin filaments could merely be a consequence of the twisted shape.

the anterior pharynx is firmly anchored to the lips by intercellular junctions, and more tenuously, via buccal cuticle
besides the tendon contacts along its anterior length, the pharynx is alsoconnected directly to the body-wall at its extreme anterior end, at the lips  <cit> . this connection via the arcade cells is unlikely to allow any local displacement, since it involves many robust intercellular junctions between hypodermis, arcade cells and pharyngeal epithelium. thus pharyngeal twist must be relative to its fixed orientation at the lips. indeed, when the twist is visualized using ajm1:gfp in the mnm- <dig> background, the pharynx seems to have rotated at the posterior end around the terminal bulb passively dragging the intestine with it, such that the foremost intestinal cells twist in a direction opposite to the pharynx, hence relieving the tension induced by the pharyngeal twist .

more tenuously, the cuticle lining of the pharynx is also continuous with the bodywall cuticle in the region of the arcade cells . the body cuticle, buccal cuticle, and pharyngeal cuticle are all shed at each molt , and the regeneration of new cuticle could contribute to twisting. however, as noted above, we see no sudden changes in pharyngeal twist associated with molting . instead, as the animal grows in size, twisting increases gradually during each larval stage, until it reaches its maximal twist by the l <dig> stage.

direct contact between the basal laminae of the pharynx and body-wall is very tight in the embryo
multiple studies of c. elegans embryos, including our own, have shown practically no available space between the mesodermal layers and ectodermal layers prior to hatching . in fact there is often no appreciable extracellular space in the head prior to the l <dig> stage, no matter what fixation is used . compared to more posterior regions of the body cavity, this tightness remains a feature of the head throughout development, but some minimal separation does develop to accommodate vigorous motions of the pharynx during feeding. basal lamina deposition can be detected by tem beginning in mid-embryogenesis using immersion or microwave fixations . as shown in fig. 7b, distinct basal laminae can be seen associated with each tissue in late embryogenesis. using high pressure freezing, the basal laminae appear much more space filling, and there may be very close contact between the lamina of neighboring tissues. this suggests that appreciable friction between bodywall and pharyngeal tissues may hold the pharynx in place prior to the onset of pumping in the l <dig>  and may thus restrict onset of the twisting phenotype. only in larvae and adults can a distinct "accessory pseudocoelomic space" be seen that separates the thin ectodermal basal laminae from the thick basal lamina of the pharynx . it is uncertain whether this accessory pseudocoelom is continuous with the pseudocoelom proper, due to close approach to the pharynx by glr processes beneath the nerve ring  <cit> .

unattached pharynges do not twist in l <dig> larvae
we tried to distinguish between two hypotheses that could explain the increasing twist during larval development. one hypothesis is that the twisting force is already present in early larval stages but that its effect is hampered by attachment of the pharynx to surrounding tissue . the other hypothesis is that the increasing twist observed in later larval stages reflects an increase in the twisting force itself, or the cumulative effect of a constant force. because dissection of pharynges is not practical with young larvae, we studied this using a genetic approach. the mnm- <dig> mutation was introduced into the pha- <dig> genetic background. in pha- <dig> mutants the pharyngeal primordium forms normally and elongates to make contact with the buccal cavity  <cit> . later during development the connection with the buccal cavity fails at the level of the arcade cells, leading to a pun  phenotype  <cit> . no twisting could be detected in pun-pharynges in l <dig> larvae of either the pha- <dig> single mutant or in the pha-1;mnm- <dig> double mutant . we conclude that it is not pharyngeal attachment to the lips or surrounding tissues that prevents full twisting in the earliest larval stage, but that a twisting force likely increases, or is constantly applied, during larval development and causes twisting in the mutants.

the unc- <dig> mutant also occasionally shows pharyngeal attachment defects at the l <dig> stage. of  <dig> unc- <dig> l <dig> larvae scored,  <dig> had normally developed pharynges that were not attached to the buccal cavity , and  <dig> had a pun phenotype . neither of these phenotypes was associated with pharyngeal twisting, againsuggesting that it is not attachment to the lips that suppresses twisting at the l <dig> stage. mnm- <dig> unc- <dig> double mutants also showed no increase in the penetration or severity of the unc- <dig> pharyngeal attachment phenotype: of  <dig> mnm- <dig> unc- <dig> l <dig> scored,  <dig> had pharynges unattached to the buccal cavity  and  <dig> had a pun phenotype.

mini screen of adhesion mutants
because the pharyngeal twisting phenotype is rather subtle and does not impair feeding, we speculated that perhaps it had been missed during the phenotypic characterization of adhesion molecule mutants. we examined eleven mutations to cause adhesion defects or to affect extracellular matrix molecules  <cit> . among these, sax- <dig> was found to exhibit a pharyngeal twisting phenotype with a 33% penetrance . the twist in the sax- <dig> mutant was almost always in the leftward direction .

* of  <dig> twisting sax- <dig> mutants,  <dig> twisted to the left, and  <dig> twisted to the right.

discussion
the twisted pharynx is a viable phenotype that worsens during post-embryonic development. although it can be scored by light microscopy, it has sometimes been overlooked in previous mutant screens. we examined several parameters relevant to understanding the twisted pharynx phenotype. vigorous pharyngeal motions that accompany molting  <cit>  are not responsible for the twisting force since no sudden increase in twist is produced upon molting . this result also suggests that the pharyngeal cuticle is not directly restraining an intrinsic twist. we also found that the attachmentof the pharynx to the bodywall at the lips is not preventing the pharynx from twisting in l <dig> larvae , and that the pharyngeal tendons that connect the procorpus to the bodywall appear intact, albeit spirally oriented, in animals with a twisted pharynx . twisted pharynges were also functionally indistinguishable from normal pharynges in a bead-uptake assay and pumping rate . thus it seems that the twisted pharynx of the studied mutants is functional and properly anchored to the rest of the worm body. therefore the phenotype likely originates from a relatively minor intrinsic defect within the mutant pharynx. the dissection experiments in which isolated pharynges retained their twisted shape, also show that the twist is an intrinsic property of the pharynges .

the pharynx features two prominent cytoskeletal filamentous arrays, both of which are oriented in a radial fashion. the marginal epithelial cells have thick bundles of intermediate filaments anchored apically  and basally  by hemidesmosomes  <cit> . since these arrays are not contractile, they likely provide strength and reinforcement to the tissue during pumping, but seem less likely to introduce twisting. pharyngeal muscles are filled with a space-filling radial array of actomyosin filaments, again anchored to cuticle and basal lamina via specialized actin-based junctions. as the pharynx rhythmically contracts, the actomyosin array foreshortens radially to expand and contract the pharyngeal lumen. this action normally should not introduce any twisting forces, and our observations that the pharynges of 6-day old adult mnm- <dig> mutants twist no more than that of 1-day old adults, and that mnm- <dig> l <dig> larvae kept in m <dig> for ~ <dig> hours show no twist indicate that pumping, at least if not accompanied by growth, plays a minor role, if any, in the development of the pharyngeal twist.

twisting occurs very gradually as the animal and pharynx grows. there is no cell replacement during growth, but each existing pharyngeal muscle mustcontinuously add more actomyosin filaments and reorganize their anchorage points to accommodate growth. the time course of twisting and its steady increase matches this continual process of re-shaping the radial array. thus the most likely cause of the twisting phenotype is a bias in the repositioning of actin binding sites as that radial array grows. the five mutants with twisted pharynges fell into two categories: the unc- <dig> and mnm- <dig> mutants always made a left-handed twist with 100% penetrance and the dig- <dig>  mig- <dig> and sax- <dig> mutants produced a mixture of right- and left-handed twists and with a 25–30% penetrance. logically, one might expect these mutations to affect proteinsrequired for actin anchorage, either at the basal lamina, or at the pharyngeal cuticle layer. chiral ordering of these binding sites as they reassemble with respect to their neighbors may account for the observed tendency to generate a left-handed twist in some mutants. this model of pharyngeal twisting being caused by a chiral bias in mispositioning of cytoskeletal elements is mechanistically similar to the reorientation of collagen fibers in roller mutants, which also shows an allele-specific handedness  <cit> .

actin filaments normally cycle their subunits via rapid "treadmilling" activity  <cit> . interference with normal regulation of actin filament length could produce the observed abnormally long filaments  and also explain a steadily increasing force that could be relieved by gradualtwisting of the whole pharynx to lengthen each sarcomere. however, this mechanism seems less likely to generate twisting in a favored  direction.

the molecular identity of three of the mutations causing a pharyngealtwist is known and is consistent with the phenotype resulting from ecm or cytoskeletal attachment defects : the dig- <dig> and sax- <dig> mutations affect adhesion molecules, and unc- <dig> affects a cytoskeleton-organizing septin . importantly, all three molecules are expressed in the pharynx  <cit> .

dig- <dig> encodes a large extracellular matrix adhesion molecule and was originally isolated because of abnormal attachment of the gonad primordium  <cit> . it is likely that its other morphological defects, such as the twisted pharynx, also are caused by impaired adhesion. an interesting observation unrelated to the pharyngeal twist was made when studying the dig-1;mnm- <dig> double mutant: the gonad arms often completely fail to develop, forming instead a small disorganized clear structure in the mid-body region, completely devoid of germ cell nuclei . this suggests that mnm- <dig> and dig- <dig> have redundant adhesion functions duringgonad development such that the dig- <dig> gonad adhesion defect is worsened in the double mutant. interactions between cell adhesion molecules and extracellular matrix are known to be important for gonad development <cit> .

unc- <dig> is one of two c. elegans septins; unc- <dig> is the other. septins are conserved gtp-binding proteins that polymerize to form filamentous structures that act as scaffolds for membrane- and cytoskeleton-binding proteins  <cit> , a function consistent with our hypothesis that defects in cytoskeleton anchorage points is responsible for the twisted pharynx phenotype. mutations in the c. elegans septins cause defects in distal tip cell and axon migration, as well as in post-embryonic cytokinesis  <cit> . in all of these defects single mutants of either septin gave full penetrance, and double mutants did not exhibit worsened phenotype. however, only unc- <dig> displays the twisted pharynx phenotype. this suggests that their roles in pharyngeal post-embryonic development are independent and distinct from each other. the unc-61;mnm- <dig> double mutant did not show any increase in twisting of the pharynx nor any additive effect on the gonad phenotype : it is possible that unc- <dig> and mnm- <dig> may function in the same pathway.

the twisted pharynx is a useful and easy-to-score phenotype, allowing one to screen for new genes involved in extracellular adhesion or organ cohesion. our small pilot screen has already identified one new pharyngeal twisting mutant, sax- <dig>  that encodes a cell adhesion molecule important for the attachment of several types of tissues, including neurons, and that, when mutated, causes pleiotropic phenotypes that include uncoordination and embryonic lethality  <cit> . that mutants with twisted pharynges are otherwise indistinguishable from wild-type worms  likely explains why this subtle phenotype has mostly gone unnoticed.

CONCLUSIONS
 <dig>  the twisted pharynx phenotype is found in several c. elegans mutants that have defects in adhesion molecules or molecules that regulate attachment of the actin cytoskeleton to the cell cortex.

 <dig>  the twisted pharynx phenotype is not a result of pumping activity nor the consequence of an external twisting force applied to the pharynx: it results from a twisting force intrinsic to the pharynx. that force likely results from the defects in the remodeling of the actin attachment points or actin filament length during pharyngeal growth.
