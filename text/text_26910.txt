BACKGROUND
sex determination in vertebrate embryos results in either testis or ovary development. in most mammals, the y-linked sry gene initiates testicular development by directing sertoli cell differentiation and the organization of seminiferous cords  <cit> . leydig and other cell types then differentiate around the cords, testosterone is released and male development is elaborated. a number of transcription factors and signalling molecules are now known to play a role in testicular differentiation upstream and downstream of sry. these include gata <dig>  fog <dig>  wt <dig>  sox <dig>  sf <dig>  dax <dig> and fgf <dig> . in contrast, the molecular control of ovarian development is less well understood. in xx mouse embryos, the earliest signs of ovarian differentiation include entry of primordial germ cells into the first stages of meiosis, followed by a fragmentation of primitive sex cords around the germ cells and their organization into primordial follicles. expression based screens have shown that the differentiating ovary has a robust program of gene expression, equalling that of the testis  <cit> . one requirement for proper ovarian development is wnt signalling. the wnt <dig> gene is up-regulated in embryonic mouse xx gonads, while loss-of-function mutants have masculinized xx gonads  <cit> . conversely, testicular vascular development and androgen production are retarded in xy embryos over-expressing wnt <dig>  <cit> . however, wnt <dig> has been shown to play a role in both testis and ovary formation, since loss of wnt <dig> signalling interferes with proper sertoli cell development in males  <cit> . most recently, it has been shown that compound mutants lacking both wnt <dig> and the transcription factor foxl <dig> develop as xx males, with patent testes  <cit> . these observations point to an important additive role for these two genes in ovarian differentiation.

a new gene implicated in female development is r-spondin <dig> . this gene was identified in humans through linkage analysis of a family and an isolated individual with hyperkeratinised skin, a predisposition to squamous cell carcinoma and  <dig>  xx female-to-male sex reversal. two separate loss of function mutations were found in the rspo <dig> gene of affected patients: a single nucleotide insertion resulting in a premature stop codon and a  <dig>  kb deletion spanning exon  <dig>  <cit> . these mutations resulted in testis formation and male development in xx individuals, in the absence of sry. it follows that rspo <dig> plays a role in ovarian development and that repression of rspo <dig> is compatible with testicular development. mouse rspo <dig> is expressed in those tissues affected by rspo <dig> mutations in humans, such as the skin and embryonic gonads. very recently, the mouse rspo <dig> null mutant has been described. rspo1-/- xx mice are masculinized, with depleted germ cells, male-like vascularisation, deregulation of wnt <dig> expression and ectopic testosterone production  <cit> . altogether, these data indicate that rspo <dig> is an important gene involved in mammalian ovarian development.

rspo <dig> is a member of a small family of secreted growth factors. the four r-spondin genes in mouse show similar expression patterns to wnt signalling molecules, and rspo proteins can operate through the canonical wnt signalling pathway, stabilising intracellular β-catenin  <cit> . β-catenin can then enter the nucleus, where it interacts with members of the tcf/lef family of transcription factors to regulate gene expression. the rspo proteins can therefore potentially regulate functions mediated by β-catenin, such as cell fate decisions and embryonic patterning. recent data indicate that rspo <dig> stimulates the β-catenin signalling pathway by binding the wnt co-receptor, lrp <dig>  modulating its availability  <cit> . it is possible that rspo proteins may also operate independently of wnt signalling  <cit> . however, given the relationship between rspo proteins and the wnt pathway, and the importance of wnt <dig> for gonadal development, these two factors might interact to play a role in ovary development  <cit> .

it has been suggested that rspo <dig> could represent the key ovary-determining gene in humans, and possibly all mammals  <cit> . however, xx rspo <dig> null mutant mice are only partially sex-reversed, implying that rspo <dig> alone is not the key "ovary-determining gene" . here, we describe the spatial and temporal expression profiles of rspo <dig> in the embryonic gonads of the mouse, chicken  and the red-eared slider turtle . these three species have different sex-determining mechanisms; xy male heterogamety in mouse, zw female heterogamety in chicken and temperature-dependent sex determination  in the turtle. despite these different sex-determining triggers, rspo <dig> shows a conserved ovary-specific expression profile in all three species. these observations suggest that rspo <dig> has an important role in ovarian development in amniotic vertebrates.

RESULTS
rspo <dig> orthologues
pcr of gonadal cdna was used to amplify chicken and turtle  orthologues of mammalian rspo <dig>  figure 1a shows an alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences for human, mouse, chicken and turtle rspo <dig>  human and mouse rspo <dig> proteins are very similar, with 93% amino acid similarity . the predicted sequence derived from the chicken genome database lacks  <dig> residues at the amino terminal relative to human rspo <dig>  we have cloned the entire open reading t. scripta rspo <dig> . overall, the chicken and human rspo <dig> proteins exhibit 79% amino acid similarity. turtle  rspo <dig> shares greatest homology with the chicken sequence , followed by the human  and mouse  .

expression of rspo <dig> in sorted mouse gonadal cells
we firstly examined mouse rspo <dig> expression in facs sorted embryonic gonadal somatic and germ cells. embryonic gonads from oct4-gfp transgenic mice were dissociated and sorted on the basis of gfp expression . the sorted cells have been shown to be pure populations of somatic and germ cells  <cit> . real time pcr analysis showed that mouse rspo <dig> was expressed predominantly in the somatic cell compartment, and up-regulated in xx gonads . in the mouse embryo, the onset of gonadal sex differentiation occurs at e <dig> , one day after the peak of sry expression in male  gonads. at the earliest time point examined here, e <dig> , rspo <dig> expression was already strongly sexually dimorphic, being up-regulated in females. expression in somatic cells of xy embryos was very low through the period of gonadal sex differentiation, from embryonic day   <dig>  –  <dig> . there was a low level of rspo <dig> mrna expression in the germ cells in both sexes, over e <dig>  – e <dig> .

chicken rspo <dig> expression and effects of aromatase inhibition
chicken rspo <dig> showed sexually dimorphic expression, being up-regulated in the presumptive ovary of zw embryos from early stages . in zw  embryos, gonadal rspo <dig> expression was elevated as early as e <dig> , and became strongly elevated from e <dig> . gonads were not separated from the mesonephric kidneys at e <dig> , hence, expression for that time point pertains to the entire urogenital system. expression in the gonads of zz embryos  remained low. in chicken embryos treated with the specific aromatase inhibitor, fadrozole, rspo <dig> expression declined . in these experiments, eggs were treated with aromatase inhibitor or pbs control on day  <dig>  and rna was extracted from gonads on day  <dig>  or day  <dig> . rspo <dig> was lowly expressed at e <dig> , but was nevertheless inhibited in fadrozole treated embryos compared to pbs treated controls. by e <dig> , when rspo <dig> expression was high in control females and low in males, fadrozole treatment resulted in a dramatic decline in rspo <dig> in females .

the rspo <dig> expression profile in embryonic chicken gonads was compared with that of wnt <dig>  which also signals through β-catenin and is known to be important for proper ovary development in mammals. as assessed by whole mount in situ hybridisation, cwnt <dig> was expressed in the gonads of both sexes from e <dig> , prior to gonadal sex differentiation. expression became sexually dimorphic during gonadal sex differentiation , being up-regulated in females and down-regulated in males. little expression was observed in the adjoining mesonephros . in sections of over-stained tissues, wnt <dig> mrna was localised towards the outer  region of the developing ovary .

rspo <dig> expression in a turtle with temperature dependent sex determination
in the red-eared slider turtle , morphological sex chromosomes are absent and egg incubation temperature determines sex. incubation at 31°c produces 100% female hatchlings, while incubation at 26°c produces 100% male hatchlings. the thermosensitive period , when temperature influences sex, spans the middle third of incubation, from embryonic stages  <dig> – 19/ <dig>  turtle rspo <dig> expression became elevated at female-producing temperatures , but remained low at male-producing temperatures  . up-regulation of rspo <dig> at the fpt occurred during the temperature-sensitive period , when temperature directs gonadal sex differentiation into testes or ovaries. expression became statistically higher in bipotential gonads developing at fpt at stage  <dig>  and remained high through gonadal differentiation . gonadal rspo <dig> expression levels changed in response to shifting embryos between temperatures at developmental stage  <dig>  indicating temperature-responsive gene expression. following a shift from the fpt to mpt, expression levels one stage later were down-regulated, and were not significantly different than male-typical levels . however, gonadal rspo <dig> levels stayed low in embryos shifted from mpt to fpt .

spatial expression of rspo <dig> protein in developing ovaries
immunofluorescence was used to examine the localisation of rspo <dig> protein in embryonic mouse and chicken gonads. in e <dig>  mouse gonads, rspo <dig> protein was detected in the ovary, but not in the testis . in the female, rspo <dig> protein was detectable throughout the gonad. the protein was localised in the cytoplasm and cell membrane . in females, rspo <dig> protein generally co-localised with wt <dig>  a somatic cell marker, although some rspo1+ cells were not wt1+ . in e <dig>  male gonads, only background staining was detected with the goat anti-mouse antibody used here . double staining with the  germ cell marker, scp <dig>  indicated rspo <dig> localisation in germ as well as somatic cells of the developing ovary , but not in males . in the chicken embryo, gonads were immunostained at e <dig>   and at e <dig>  . rspo <dig> protein was detected in the outer cortical zone of the developing left ovary. this is the site of germ cell meiosis, and the differentiation of somatic supporting cells into primordial follicles. the underlying medulla, which expresses aromatase protein and synthesises estrogens, was negative for rspo <dig> . no protein was detectable in the regressing right female gonad , consistent with a lack of cortical development. no expression was detectable in the testis . high power images of rspo <dig> protein expression showed cytoplasmic and cell surface localisation among cortical cells of the left female gonad, and potentially some localisation in the extracellular matrix . widespread expression of rspo <dig> in the left cortex suggests protein localisation in both somatic and germ cells, as observed in mouse. in gonads taken from female  embryos treated with aromatase inhibitor, aromatase enzyme expression was significantly reduced and rspo <dig> protein could not be detected . in negative control sections lacking primary antibody, specific staining was abolished .

discussion
these results show that rspo <dig> has a conserved female-specific expression profile in vertebrate embryos. in all three species, rspo <dig> mrna expression becomes elevated in female gonads at the time of somatic cell organization around the germ cells and the onset of germ cell meiosis  <cit> . in the mouse and chicken, rspo <dig> expression at this time is predominantly or exclusively localised in the somatic cells. altogether, these observations implicate rspo <dig> in a conserved pathway leading to folliculogenesis and germ cell development. the mouse expression data are in agreement with previous studies showing ovary-specific rspo <dig> mrna expression in mammalian embryos  <cit> , and with the impaired follicle development reported in rspo <dig> null mutant mice  <cit> . immunofluorescence of rspo <dig> protein confirmed a somatic localisation in developing mouse and chicken ovaries, in the cell membrane and around somatic and germ cells. this is consistent with a role of rspo <dig> as a secreted signalling molecule  <cit> , suggesting that rspo <dig> secreted from somatic  cells has a role in both somatic and germ cell development. this is in agreement with a recent study of embryonic goat gonads, showing somatic and germ cell surface localisation of rspo <dig> in the cortical region of the developing ovary  <cit> .

mammalian rspo <dig> has a predicted signal sequence at its n-terminus, and the protein has been reported to be present in the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi apparatus of transfected 293t cells   <cit> . furthermore, all mammalian rspos have a thrombospondin motif and they have been shown to bind heparin sulfate proteogylcans on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix  <cit> . however, a potential nuclear localisation signal has also been identified at the carboxy terminus of mouse rspo <dig> and transfected cos <dig> cells show localisation in the nucleus  <cit> . similarly, goat rspo <dig> protein translated from a second putative atg also localises to the nucleus of transfected cos <dig> cells  <cit> . the potential role of nuclear localised rspo <dig> is unknown, although in transfected cells it appears to associate with nucleoli. however, western blots show that a number of different rspo <dig> isoforms may be produced in transfected cells, some processed for the nucleus and others for the cytoplasm/secretion  <cit> . in our study, no nuclear localisation of endogenous rspo <dig> protein was detected. the commercial antibody used here was raised against the amino terminus of recombinant mouse rspo <dig> . it is possible that the antibody fails to detect any nuclear localised rspo <dig>  if a 5' splice variant lacks amino acids 21– <dig>  further studies are required to clarify if an endogenous isoform lacking the n terminal signal sequence can localise to the nucleus.

given that it engages the effector pathway of wnt signalling, β-catenin, in other systems, it is expected that rspo <dig> plays a role in ovarian development by influencing β-catenin. β-catenin has two potential roles in the cell; transactivation of target genes and the formation of adherent-type junctions  <cit> , either or both of which may be important for ovarian differentiation. rspo <dig> may act together with wnt <dig> in the developing ovary. the spatial and temporal expression profile of rspo <dig> is similar to that of wnt <dig> in mouse and chicken; wnt <dig> is up-regulated in the gonadal somatic cell lineage of presumptive females in both species   <cit> . wnt <dig> expression is de-regulated in the rpso1-/- mice  <cit> . in the red-eared slider turtle, wnt <dig> mrna is expressed at similar levels during the tsp in the gonads of embryos developing at both mpt and fpt, and only becomes dimorphic during later ovarian differentiation  <cit> . in the mouse embryo, transgenic and knock-out studies have shown that wnt <dig> plays a role in ovarian development, by repressing male-typical steroidogenesis and vascular development  <cit> . furthermore, wnt <dig> functions to antagonise the testis-promoting effects of fgf <dig>  <cit> . some in vitro and in vivo studies have suggested that, in embryonic ovaries, wnt <dig> may function in a non-canonical fashion to block stabilisation of β-catenin  <cit>  and instead sequester it to the cell membrane  <cit> . however, most recently, it has been shown using in vivo transgenic mouse models that rspo <dig> and wnt <dig> both activate canonical β-catenin signaling in the embryonic ovary, with rspo <dig> acting upstream of wnt <dig>  <cit>  . while the rspo <dig> and wnt <dig> xx null mutants are both masculinized, neither is fully sex-reversed. it is therefore likely that these two factors operate synergistically to activate the canonical β-catenin signaling involved in mouse ovarian development. in this context, it will be of interest to examine the phenotype of rspo1-/- /wnt4-/- compound mutants, in which complete xx female-to-male sex reversal might occur.

the immunofluorescent studies reported here for mouse and chicken indicate that rspo <dig> protein also localises at or in female germ cells . however, the qrt-pcr data indicate that transcript expression is low in fetal germ cells, at least in mouse . the immunofluorescent results may therefore reflect the localisation of secreted rspo <dig>  rspo <dig> is synthesised primarily in somatic cells, but is secreted and becomes localised at the cell membrane and within both somatic and germ cells. localisation of rspo <dig> protein at the cell membrane of both somatic and germ cells was also recently reported in embryonic goat ovaries  <cit> . this implies that it has a function in both cell types during ovarian development, that is, during the organization of primordial follicles. these observations are consistent with the recent description of the xx rspo1-/- mice, which are subfertile, with a decline in the number of oocytes and impaired follicle formation  <cit> . this indicates that rspo <dig> signaling plays a role in germ cell development and differentiation.

in the chicken embryo, morphological differentiation of the gonads begins at embryonic day  <dig> –  <dig>  , when sox <dig> expression begins in zz  gonads and aromatase expression begins in zw  gonads  <cit> . at this time, chicken rspo <dig> expression was sexually dimorphic, showing higher expression in putative ovaries . in fact, female-enriched rspo <dig> expression was detectable as early as e <dig> , which precedes aromatase activation . however, the expression seen at e <dig>  represents both gonad and mesonephric tissue, as the two tissues could not be easily separated. therefore, expression in the mesonephros cannot be ruled out. by e <dig> , however, gonad-specific rspo <dig> expression was higher in female gonads compared to males. the rspo <dig> gene is autosomal in chicken and is therefore not the master sex determinant in birds, which must lie on a sex chromosome/s . however, its early sexually dimorphic expression profile in the gonad indicates that rspo <dig> is upstream in the avian sex-determining pathway, as inferred from the mouse and human studies. the exact onset of gonadal rspo <dig> expression in the chicken embryo is unclear. since wnt <dig> is female up-regulated in the embryonic chicken, as in mouse, it is likely that rspo <dig> regulates and interacts with wnt <dig> in birds as in mammals. this molecular aspect of ovarian differentiation may therefore be conserved between birds and mammals.

chicken rspo <dig> protein was localised within the outer cortical zone of the developing left ovary . the real time pcr analysis showed low levels of rspo <dig> mrna at e <dig>  , although strong protein expression was nevertheless detected in the cortex . this may reflect the small proportion of the gonad that comprises cortex at e <dig> , resulting in low rspo <dig> mrna levels when expressed relative to whole gonadal mrna . thus, proliferation of the left cortex over development correlated with increased rspo <dig> mrna levels . widespread protein localisation in the cortex of the female chicken embryo suggests both somatic and germ cell expression. cortical rspo <dig> expression may be stimulated by estrogen, as indicated by the aromatase inhibitor studies. aromatase enzyme is expressed early in avian gonadal sex differentiation, producing estrogen female-specifically from e <dig> . in chicken embryos treated with the aromatase enzyme inhibitor, fadrozole, the left ovarian cortex did not proliferate and rspo <dig> mrna expression declined . furthermore, rspo <dig> expression could not be detected by immunofluorescence in female gonads after aromatase inhibition . previous studies have also shown that the left ovarian cortex does not proliferate in chicken embryos treated with aromatase inhibitor, indicating that its development is estrogen dependent  <cit> . the decline of rspo <dig> expression after aromatase inhibition may therefore reflect a lack of cortical  cell proliferation. in the chicken embryo, the transcription factor, foxl <dig>  is expressed female-specifically just prior to aromatase  <cit> , and several lines of evidence suggest that foxl <dig> activates the aromatase gene during avian  ovarian development  <cit> . chicken foxl <dig> and aromatase are both expressed in the gonadal medulla from e <dig> –  <dig>  while rspo <dig> is expressed in the cortex. activation of rspo <dig> expression may therefore be independent of the foxl2-aromatase pathway  or rspo <dig> may lie downstream of aromatase in the avian ovarian pathway. however, the aromatase inhibition experiment indicates that estrogen synthesis is required to maintain rspo <dig> expression, possibly by maintaining the cortical pre-follicular cell population .

rspo <dig> expression was also sexually dimorphic in the gonads of the turtle, t. scripta, a reptile with temperature-dependent sex determination   <cit> . expression was significantly higher in turtle embryos incubated at the female-producing temperature , and expression declined in embryos shifted from the female- to male-producing temperature . sexually dimorphic expression of rspo <dig> expression occurred during the temperature-sensitive period , when bipotential gonads are sensitive to the action of temperature. the temperature-sensitive molecule in reptiles with tsd remains unknown, but genes up-regulated during the critical tsp are likely to be key candidates for early mediators of gonadal development. in t. scripta, the tsp spans stages  <dig> – 19/ <dig>  and sexual differentiation of the gonads begins near the end of this period  <cit> . rspo <dig> mrna was more highly expressed in gonads incubated at fpt from stage  <dig>  during the middle of the tsp and before the onset of gonadal sex differentiation. rspo <dig> may therefore lie upstream in the genetic cascade leading to female development in species with tsd, as inferred for birds and mammals. the temperature shift experiments indicate that rspo <dig> expression responds to temperature. however, lack of up-regulation in male embryos shifted to the female temperature may indicate that rspo <dig> up-regulation has not yet occurred within one stage post-shift. future studies extending analysis to later stages would clarify this point. factors such as the candidate male determinant dmrt <dig> are male-specific from an early stage during the tsp in t. scripta  <cit> , and these factors may pre-empt rspo <dig> 

as in chicken, foxl <dig> and aromatase are up-regulated at the female temperature in t. scripta   <cit> . therefore, similar to the case in chicken, foxl2/aromatase may play a role in formation of the ovarian medulla, while rspo <dig> may be more important for differentiation that occurs in the outer cortex, namely, primordial follicle development. in egg-laying vertebrates such as birds and reptiles, estrogen synthesised by aromatase is important for stimulating development of the outer cortex of the gonad. it is therefore possible that rspo <dig> expression is maintained by estrogen during ovarian development in oviparous species, as suggested by the aromatase inhibitor experiments in the chicken  <cit> . this may be a direct effect of estrogen on rspo <dig> expression, or, as discussed above, an indirect effect via maintenance of the pre-follicular cells.

CONCLUSIONS
rspo <dig> has a conserved, female-specific expression profile that implies an important role in vertebrate ovarian development. the gene is up-regulated at the earliest stages of ovarian sex differentiation in animals with different sex-determining mechanisms . rspo <dig> mrna expression is enriched in ovarian somatic cells, while the protein localises to the cell surface and cytoplasm of both somatic and germ cells. taken together, the data indicate that rspo <dig> has a role in primordial follicle development. further studies are required to determine how rspo <dig> expression is regulated in the different groups, and to elucidate its mechanisms of action, likely to be mediated by interaction with wnt signaling and stabilisation of β-catenin.
