BACKGROUND
c. albicans sur <dig> shares 44% identity and 65% similarity with s. cerevisiae sur <dig>  s. cerevisiae sur <dig> encodes a predicted integral membrane protein with an n-terminal signal sequence and four transmembrane domains, and is a member of a family of proteins that also includes yn1194p, ydl222p, and ylr414cp  <cit> . sur7p localizes to large, immobile, stable cortical patches on the plasma membrane, termed "eisosomes" which mark sites of endocytosis  <cit> . deletion of s. cerevisiae sur <dig> resulted in a strain with a defect in sporulation and altered plasma membrane sphingolipid content  <cit> .

alvarez and konopka  <cit>  identified c. albicans sur7p in a detergent-resistant fraction of the plasma membrane in a proteomics study on n-acetylglucosamine-induced proteins. recently, they generated a c. albicans sur7Δ knockout mutant which is characterized by aberrant cell wall organization  <cit> . specifically, lack of sur <dig> in c. albicans results in mislocalization of actin and septin, and abnormal cell wall material protruding into and forming structures within the cytoplasm. however, from a phenotypic standpoint, little is known regarding the role of c. albicans sur <dig> in pathogenesis.

a number of c. albicans virulence-related secreted proteins that remain associated with the plasma membrane or cell wall have been identified, including the outer mannoprotein hwp1p  <cit> , adhesins encoded by the als family of genes  <cit> , and membrane proteins encoded by the ph-responsive genes phr <dig> and phr <dig>  <cit> . however, a genome-wide understanding of candida secretory pathway proteins and virulence is still limited. previously, we took advantage of signalp v <dig>   <cit>  and a series of additional validated predictive algorithms to define a computational secretome of c. albicans from its entire genome  <cit> . in addition to identifying putative soluble secretory proteins, we also identified a number of putative and known membrane and cell-wall associated proteins  <cit> . we next compared these databases with published genome-wide expression profiling data to identify candidate virulence-related genes. fradin et al.  <cit>  performed genomic expression profiling in c. albicans exposed in vitro to blood and in vivo during infection in a standard mouse model of disseminated candidiasis and identified groups of genes highly expressed under these conditions. when compared with the dataset of predicted secretion pathway orfs, a number of virulence-related genes were concordant, including hwp1p and the als family of adhesins  <cit> , phr1p  <cit> , sap9p  <cit> , sod5p  <cit> , and sun41p  <cit> . thus, we identified known soluble secreted and membrane-associated secretion pathway proteins important for virulence, supporting our approach as a method to identify candidate virulence-related genes.

we also identified orf <dig> , which is predicted to encode a secretion pathway protein homologous to the s. cerevisiae endocytosis-related gene sur <dig>  <cit> . as we independently identified c. albicans sur <dig> in our screen for candidate virulence-related genes, we used a reverse genetic approach to investigate the role of c. albicans sur <dig> in attributes related to virulence in order to define its role in pathogenesis.

RESULTS
the temperature sensitive growth defect of the candida albicans sur7Δ mutant is partially rescued by high salt
we generated a c. albicans sur7Δ homozygous null mutant by pcr-mediated gene disruption  <cit> , smb3-h, followed by construction of an isogenic complemented strain, smb3-r . before proceeding with phenotypic characterizations of the sur7Δ null mutant, we assessed the growth of each strain by calculating doubling times. growth curves and the resulting doubling times are presented in fig.  <dig> and table  <dig>  respectively. in rich medium, there was no statistically significant difference  between the calculated doubling times of the c. albicans sur7Δ mutant, prototrophic control strain day <dig>  and the isogenic complemented strain . growth in response to high osmotic stress  was the same as that of the control strains when incubated at either  <dig> or 37°c . interestingly, when incubated at 42°c, growth of the sur7Δ null mutant strain was markedly impaired, in contrast to the control and sur <dig> complemented strains . the sur7Δ null mutant grew at one-third the rate of the wild-type control strains . unexpectedly, the sur7Δ null mutant's inability to grow at 42°c was partially rescued when grown under conditions of high salt ; differences in doubling time compared to the control strains were statistically significant .

c. albicans fmp45p-gfp fluorescence intensity increases in the presence of high salt and temperature
in s. cerevisiae, transcript levels of the sur <dig> paralog ynl <dig> is increased in the presence of high salt  <cit> . expression of the ynl194p-gfp fusion protein under its native promoter shifted from barely detectable fluorescence levels to highly detectable levels with the addition of high salt, and the gene product was found to co-localize with s. cerevisiae sur7p  <cit> . there is only one closely related paralog of ca sur7p in c. albicans, ca fmp45p , which shares 31% identity and 45% similarity. according to predictions using tmhmm http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/tmhmm/, fmp45p has  <dig> transmembrane domains similar to sur7p defined by amino acids 7-29; 106-128; 135-157; 186- <dig>  and 7-29; 104-126; 139-161; 183- <dig>  respectively. these results are similar to data presented by alvarez et al.  <cit>  who also noted the presence of a conserved cys-containing motif in c. albicans fmp45p similar to the consensus sequence that is characteristic of members of the claudin family of proteins. to explore the functional relation between c. albicans sur <dig> and fmp <dig>  we created a double-fluorescent labelled strain, sur7-yfp fmp45-gfp, whose expression of both fusion proteins remain under the control of their native promoters. while the fluorescence emission overlap of yfp and gfp makes it impossible to separate them using conventional epifluorescence imaging, the nuance™ multispectral imaging system  can distinguish the spectra of the yfp- and gfp-tagged proteins, and produce separate images of sur7p-yfp and fmp45p-gfp from the single sur7-yfp fmp45-gfp strain. the merged fluorescence images indicate that fmp45p co-localizes in a punctate pattern with the plasma membrane-bound protein sur7p . these results are similar to that observed in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . we thus hypothesized that under these specific growth conditions , the c. albicans paralog fmp <dig> may be contributing to a compensatory response to high salt.

to test this hypothesis, we created strains b-fmp45gfp and sΔ-fmp45gfp expressing the fmp45p-gfp fusion protein in both wild-type and sur7Δ null backgrounds, respectively . in the wild-type background, fmp45p-gfp fluorescence intensity is very low, and appears to display a punctate pattern of plasma membrane localization . in the presence of high salt, fmp45p fluorescence intensity in the sur7+ background is increased . in the sur7Δ null background, the fluorescence pattern of fmp45p-gfp is clearly punctate, similar to the localization of sur7p, and in the absence of salt an increase in fmp45p-gfp fluorescence is readily observed . in the presence of high salt , fmp45p-gfp fluorescence greatly increased in the sur7Δ background and maintained the punctate pattern that is typical of sur7p localization . using image j software analysis, we quantified the relative fluorescence intensity of all major points around a given cell. the median intensity of each cell with a wild-type  and sur7Δ null  background was  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. these measurements are in agreement with visual observation of the images obtained . the co-localization of fmp45p and sur7p and the increase in fluorescence intensity of fmp45p-gfp in the presence of  <dig> m nacl together suggest that fmp45p may play a role in tolerance of high salt in the absence of c. albicans sur7p.

the candida albicans sur7Δ mutant is defective in tolerance to cell wall stress and antifungal agents targeting cell wall components
next we tested growth in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of several different classes of antifungal agents at  <dig> and 37°c. no difference was seen in growth in the presence of amphotericin b or 5-fluorocytosine . however, the c. albicans sur7Δ mutant was more susceptible to sub-inhibitory concentrations of caspofungin . we further investigated cell wall integrity in the sur7Δ null mutant using a number of cell wall perturbing agents. serial dilutions of each strain were spotted onto ypd medium containing various concentrations of cas, sds, congo red, and calcofluor white. in the absence of sur <dig> the organism was highly sensitive to each compound tested . furthermore, a modest gene dosage effect was suggested, as the degree of sensitivity of the sur7-complemented strain was intermediate between that of the wild-type and sur7Δ strains. when tested on the same media, the heterozygous mutant strain  exhibited the same degree of sensitivity to cell wall perturbing agents as the sur <dig> complemented strain .

taken together, these initial studies on the sur7Δ mutant indicate an overall defect in cell wall structure, and consequent defects in the ability of the sur7Δ mutant to tolerate specific stresses related to cell wall function. we next focused on studying the implications of this defective structure on factors that contribute to virulence, including adhesion, filamentation, protease secretion, and biofilm formation.

the c. albicans sur7Δ mutant has an abnormal response to induction of filamentation and hyphal cells are markedly defective in plasma membrane structure
an important virulence attribute in c. albicans is the ability to switch between yeast, pseudohyphal, and filamentous forms  <cit> . when spotted onto m <dig> agar, hyphal structures were formed from each colony . however, the extent of filamentation was reduced in the sur7Δ null mutant compared to day <dig> and the sur <dig> complemented strain. similar results were observed when grown on spider agar medium at 37°c . when bsa agar plates were incubated for an extended period of time, filamentous structures emerged from the edge of each colony except in the sur7Δ null mutant . this reduced filamentation in response to inducing conditions was also seen on solid media containing fetal calf serum . in liquid media , time of germination and the extent of filament elongation of the c. albicans sur7Δ mutant were grossly similar to the wild-type and sur <dig> complemented strains . however, when grown in weak hyphal-inducing liquid spider medium, a population of yeast cells and hyphae with aberrant morphology and branching was observed .

next, structures of the filamentous form were compared using light microscopy. after  <dig> hours of growth, the wild-type  and sur <dig> complemented strains produced mature, elongated hyphal cells with clear septa, whereas the sur7Δ null mutant produced irregularly shaped hyphae with obvious intracellular invaginations . thin-section electron microscopy demonstrated subcellular structures in the filaments formed by the sur7Δ null mutant strain  which, as in the yeast form cells , are likely related to the plasma membrane based on subcellular appearance.

c. albicans sur7Δ mutant hyphal cells are defective in endocytosis
s. cerevisiae sur7p is a component of eisosomes which mark sites of endocytosis in the plasma membrane  <cit> . sur7p is localized to the plasma membrane in the filamentous form of c. albicans in a punctate pattern , similar to that observed in the yeast form, suggesting retention of its endocytic role in hyphae. thus, to examine the role of the c. albicans sur7p in endocytosis in filamentous cells, we used the lipophilic membrane dye fm4- <dig> and visualized its fate using fluorescence microscopy. since fm4- <dig> initially binds to the plasma membrane, followed by active endocytosis, the sub-cellular structures stained with fm4- <dig> in the sur7Δ mutant  appear to correspond to the aberrant structures accumulating in filaments seen on electron microscopy .

in order to further define the origin of these aberrant structures, we stained these cells in the yeast form with the vacuolar luminal dye carboxy-dcfda  . cdcfda reaches the vacuole via passive diffusion in contrast to fm4- <dig> which is internalized through the endocytic pathway. cdcfda and fm4- <dig> stained the vacuolar lumen and membrane, respectively, in control strains, day <dig> and the sur <dig> complemented strain. in contrast, most of the fm4- <dig> dye did not reach the vacuolar membrane of the sur7Δ null mutant, but instead remained in non-vacuolar structures as evidenced by the lack of co-staining with cdcfda . the vacuole of the sur7Δ null mutant is intact as shown by cdcfda staining, and by thin section electron microscopy . taken together these results clearly demonstrate that the structures stained by fm4- <dig> are not fragmented vacuoles, and are plasma membrane-derived.

thus, from a structural perspective, the overall plasma membrane architecture of both yeast and hyphal cells, the c. albicans sur7Δ null mutant is markedly abnormal.

the candida albicans sur7Δ mutant is impaired in lipase secretion but overproduces sap2p
secretion of degradative enzymes is important to pathogenesis, thus we characterized secretion of aspartyl proteases , lipase, and phospholipases in the sur7Δ null mutant strain. when inoculated on medium containing bsa as the sole nitrogen source, wild-type c. albicans secretes aspartyl proteinases which result in a halo surrounding the colony due to extracellular proteolysis. compared to prototrophic control strain day <dig> and the isogenic complemented strain, the c. albicans sur7Δ null mutant secreted increased extracellular proteolytic activity on bsa plates  and in liquid bsa . we next examined extracellular sap2p secretion using western blotting of culture supernatants using anti-sap2p antibodies . the c. albicans sur7Δ mutant produced substantially greater amounts of extracellular sap2p, compared to day <dig> and the complemented strain . thus, the proteolytic degradation of bsa  is likely due to increased secretion of sap2p. in contrast, the c. albicans sur7Δ mutant secreted slightly reduced amounts of extracellular sap4-6p compared to the control and complemented strain when analyzed by western blotting .

we next assayed secreted phospholipase and lipase activity on egg-yolk agar and ynb-tween  <dig> plates, respectively. both phospholipase and lipase are active on egg-yolk agar plates whereas ynb-tween  <dig> plates are more specific for lipase activity  <cit> . the sur7Δ null mutant strain produced almost undetectable amounts of precipitation on ynb-tween plates but only slightly less degradative activity on egg-yolk agar plates compared with control strain day <dig> and the sur <dig> complemented strain , thus suggesting impaired lipase secretion.

absence of c. albicans sur <dig> increases adherence
adhesion plays a critical role in the early stages of c. albicans infection, and several secreted and cell wall-associated proteins contribute to this mechanism of pathogenesis . thus, given the observed secretory and cell wall defects of the sur7Δ strain, we next compared the degree of adhesion between the sur7Δ null mutant and control strains using a standard assay for adherence to polystyrene. adherence was assayed in both rpmi- <dig>  and pbs . an increase in adherence was observed in the sur7Δ null mutant strain compared to sur7+ strains  in either rpmi- <dig> or pbs.

the c. albicans sur7Δ mutant forms an aberrant biofilm
we next examined the role of c. albicans sur <dig> in biofilm formation, a key contributor to candida pathogenesis. the c. albicans sur7Δ mutant formed a sparse biofilm, with a patchy distribution when examined by light microscopy . because the c. albicans sur7Δ mutant in planktonic culture generated increased xtt activity compared to controls , we used an alternative method to measure biofilm mass. analysis of biofilm mass using crystal violet staining showed a decrease in biofilm mass consistent with direct microscopic observation of the biofilm formed . average od <dig> nm measurements of the crystal violet extracts, which are directly related to biofilm mass, were  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for the wild-type, sur7Δ null mutant, and sur <dig> complemented strains, respectively . examination of the biofilm by scanning electron microscopy demonstrated a sparse biofilm architecture compared to control strain day <dig> .

next, in order to determine if the reduced biofilm mass of the sur7Δ mutant is related to decreased attachment of the biofilm, we quantified the amount of planktonic cells in the biofilm wash of each strain. compared to the control strains, there were significantly fewer planktonic cells  present in the biofilm formed by the sur7Δ null mutant . these results are therefore consistent with the previous adhesion studies. thus, reduced attachment of cells does not account for the lesser biofilm mass of the sur7Δ null mutant. furthermore, as there is only a minor delay or impairment in filamentation in this growth medium, it appears that the defect in biofilm formation is most likely due to a defect in cell wall or plasma membrane structure related to the absence of sur <dig> 

the c. albicans sur7Δ mutant is defective in macrophage killing
lastly, we sought to determine the effect of the loss-of-function of sur <dig> on the ability of c. albicans to kill macrophage cells. at early time points , the number of live macrophage cells co-incubated with the sur7Δ null mutant was similar to the numbers found when co-incubated with either day <dig> or the sur <dig> complemented strain . after  <dig> hours of co-incubation, significantly more macrophages per field remained when co-incubated with the sur7Δ null mutant  than either of the control strains  . these results indicate that c. albicans sur <dig> is required for in vitro macrophage killing.

discussion
using a bioinformatics approach, we previously identified predicted secretion pathway proteins in candida albicans  <cit>  and next compared this with published transcriptional profiling data to identify genes highly expressed during conditions similar to bloodstream infection  <cit> . this approach identified a number of genes known to be involved in pathogenesis, among them sun <dig> and sod <dig>  which have recently been studied in detail  <cit> . among several other unknown open reading frames, we identified the c. albicans homolog of s. cerevisiae sur <dig>  which has recently been described in c. albicans as required for proper plasma membrane organization and cell wall synthesis  <cit> . thus, we sought to investigate the role of c. albicans sur <dig> in virulence-related phenotypes, including filamentation, aspartyl protease  and lipase secretion, biofilm formation, and virulence using an in vitro macrophage killing model.

we first assessed the structural role of c. albicans sur <dig> from a general cellular and physiologic perspective. loss-of-function of sur <dig> resulted in the formation of aberrant plasma membrane invaginations and accumulation of subcellular structures inside the c. albicans cells, whether in the hyphal or the yeast form. similar invaginations were observed in a s. cerevisiae pil1Δ deletion mutant  <cit> , and s. cerevisiae pil1p has been shown to be involved in the localization of s. cerevisiae sur7p to the plasma membrane. in addition, the c. albicans sur7Δ mutant was hyper-susceptible to sub-inhibitory concentrations of caspofungin but not to either amphotericin b or 5-fluorocytosine. caspofungin inhibits β- <dig> -glucan synthase thus altering cell wall composition leading to cell lysis of candida cells  <cit> . moreover, we have demonstrated that growth of the sur7Δ null mutant was sensitive to sds, congo red, and calcofluor white. these results suggest that sur <dig> plays a role in maintenance of cell wall integrity of both the yeast and filamentous form of c. albicans.

there was no impairment in the ability of the sur7Δ null mutant strain to tolerate general osmotic stresses or growth at 37°c. likewise, in s. cerevisiae, the growth of the sur7Δ mutant, and null mutants of the sur <dig> paralogs ynl194Δ and ydl222Δ strains was similar to wild-type under conditions of high salt or elevated temperatures  <cit> . however, growth of the c. albicans sur7Δ mutant was markedly impaired at 42°c, a phenotype that was partially rescued by the addition of  <dig>  m nacl. we demonstrated that the fluorescently-tagged c. albicans sur7p paralog fmp45p co-localizes with sur7p-gfp. we further demonstrated increased fluorescence intensity of the c. albicans sur7p paralog fmp45p, in the presence of high salt  in both the sur7+ and sur7- strains. thus the cellular localization and increased fluorescence intensities suggest that fmp45p may play a role in survival at high temperature and salt conditions in the sur7Δ mutant. this suggests functional similarities between sur <dig> and fmp <dig> that are important for growth and survival in more extreme environmental conditions. we have so far been unsuccessful in our efforts to generate a c. albicans sur7Δ fmp45Δ null mutant, and it remains to be determined if these genes are synthetic lethal in c. albicans.

there is limited data on the role of endocytosis in candida pathogenesis. previously, c. albicans orfs homologous to s. cerevisiae endocytosis genes were investigated for their involvement in polarized cell growth  <cit> . specifically, the authors examined abp <dig>  bzz <dig>  ede <dig>  and pan <dig>  whose gene products are involved in the early stages of endocytosis  <cit> . loss of function of pan <dig>  but not abp <dig>  bzz <dig>  or ede <dig>  resulted in altered hyphal formation  <cit> . more recently, douglas et al  <cit>  investigated the role of c. albicans rvs <dig> and rvs <dig> whose homologues in s. cerevisiae are involved in the severance of budding endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane. deletion of these genes resulted in strains that produced aberrant filamentous structures and exhibited decreased virulence in a mouse model of disseminated candidiasis  <cit> . in s. cerevisiae, sur <dig> localizes to eisosomes which are immobile protein assemblies that mark sites on the plasma membrane for endocytosis  <cit> . defective endocytosis as a result of the deletion of sur <dig> in c. albicans has been described for the yeast form of this important pathogen  <cit> . however, the role of c. albicans sur <dig> in pathogenesis has not been previously examined. we present here results of experiments whose main focus was to characterize the structural and physiologic role of c. albicans sur <dig>  in order to provide a foundation to understanding the role of sur <dig> in pathogenesis.

thus, we next turned our attention to assessing the functional contribution of c. albicans sur <dig> to several key virulence-related attributes. the c. albicans sur7Δ mutant was delayed in filamentation when induced on solid media, although this overall defect was minor. microscopic examination revealed that the sur7Δ filaments branched extensively, and ultrastructurally contained subcellular structures resembling those seen in the c. albicans sur7Δ yeast cells. alvarez et al.  <cit>  also describe pseudohyphal growth of the sur7Δ mutant strain including an apparent defect in cell polarization, as evidenced by weak filipin staining. however, it is not clear why c. albicans sur <dig> affects sap or lipase secretion, as there is currently little known of the role of endocytosis in the secretion of saps, lipases, and phospholipases.

importantly, the c. albicans sur7Δ mutant formed a patchy biofilm, with many areas of scant cells and filaments. as we demonstrated an increase in adhesion in the sur7Δ mutant, and only a minor delay in filamentation, this markedly defective biofilm cannot be attributed to reduced adhesion or defective filamentation. instead, we postulate that the marked plasma membrane and cell wall defects that we demonstrated in the structural studies of the sur7Δ mutant may be responsible for this defective biofilm. biofilm formation is a complex, still incompletely understood process. however, cell-cell communication and adhesion are an important part of biofilm formation. we suspect that the marked derangement in plasma membrane and cell wall organization may affect the ability of the c. albicans sur7Δ mutant to form a normal biofilm.

alternatively, it is possible that sur <dig> is involved in biofilm detachment, as a negative regulator. recently, sellam et al.  <cit> , performed transcriptional profiling to identify genes potentially involved in biofilm detachment . in their experiments, levels of sur <dig> transcript were down-regulated during the initial steps of biofilm detachment. during biofilm detachment, the biofilm was observed to detach from the surface in patches. this is in agreement with the patchy morphology of the biofilm formed by the sur7Δ homozygous null mutant strain. thus, we present another hypothesis that sur <dig> may be a negative regulator of biofilm detachment, and we are currently investigating the role of sur <dig> in biofilm detachment.

we next assayed virulence in a macrophage killing assay in vitro. we clearly demonstrated that the sur7Δ mutant strain was greatly reduced in its ability to kill murine macrophage cells at  <dig> hours, which is similar to the virulence defect seen in a c. albicans vps11Δ mutant  <cit> . again, we suspect that the marked abnormalities in plasma membrane and cell wall structure render the c. albicans sur7Δ mutant more susceptible to macrophage killing.

CONCLUSIONS
c. albicans sur <dig> shares some functional homology to s. cerevisiae sur <dig>  but unlike in s. cerevisiae, c. albicans sur <dig> may play a role in endocytosis and the maintenance of cell wall integrity. c. albicans sur <dig> contributes to several key virulence-related phenotypes, and thus, may have additional molecular functions in this highly adaptable, pathogenic organism. of note, sur <dig> appears to be fungal-specific, with no clear human homologue. given the phenotypes we describe here and its increased expression during infection  <cit> , we are further investigating whether c. albicans sur <dig> plays a role in biofilm detachment and the dissemination of infection.
