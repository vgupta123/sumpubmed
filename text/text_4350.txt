BACKGROUND
approximately 75% of the drugs in clinical use elicit their pharmacological effects by interactions with receptor or enzyme targets, such as kinases  <cit> . methods to screen large chemical libraries for inhibitors of protein kinases include radiometric assays  <cit> , elisa  <cit> , atp consumption assays  <cit>  and several fluorescence based assays such as time-resolved fluorescence   <cit> , fluorescence polarization   <cit> , fluorescence energy transfer   <cit>  or fluorescence quench assays  <cit> . assays such as fret, fp and fluorescence quench do not require antibodies or radioactive label, and are thus attractive for hts. however non-antibody based fp and fret assays are restricted to the use of small, synthetic peptide substrates to monitor kinase activity. while peptide substrates are convenient for hts purposes, those that bind with high affinity are available for only a small percentage of the > <dig> kinases encoded by the human genome  <cit> . additionally, peptide substrates may diminish the ability to detect inhibitors that bind to docking sites of a native protein substrate or that bind to unique conformational states induced by protein substrate binding  <cit> . here we report the detection of phosphorylation of the natural protein substrates myelin basic protein , histone h <dig> and phosphorylated heat- and acid-stable protein  by pkcα and irak <dig> using a modified version of our original assay format  <cit> , which is based on superquenching of fluorescent polyelectrolytes  <cit> . the assay principle is shown in figure  <dig> 

RESULTS
mbp, histone h <dig> and and phas- <dig> proteins were phosphorylated with pkcα and irak <dig> as described in the methods section. the proteins were used in their native form and were not chemically modified. an enzyme concentration-dependent increase in phosphorylation correlated with increasing fluorescence signal, demonstrating the efficacy of the qtl lightspeed™ platform for detection of phosphorylated proteins . the detection of mbp phosphorylation worked equally well for protein substrates derived from either bovine or human . in order to explore the utility of the assay for screening inhibitors, the atp competitor staurosporine was used to inhibit enzyme activities using substrates histone h <dig>  phas- <dig>  mbp . for each protein, a concentration of staurosporine which inhibited enzyme activity by 50%  was determined to be within the range of the reported value using a peptide substrate   <cit> : values of  <dig>  nm,  <dig>  nm and  <dig>  nm were obtained for mbp, histone h <dig> and phas- <dig>  respectively . the irak <dig> protein assay was 3-fold more sensitive than a qtl lightspeed™ assay performed on a peptide substrate . using mbp as substrate, we were able to obtain ic <dig> values for staurosporine of  <dig>  nm, which were very similar to those obtained using a peptide substrate .

the robustness of the assay  was determined by performing  <dig> multiples of phosphorylation reactions using identical assay conditions. the z' is a statistical parameter used in the drug screening community to evaluate and validate performance of assays  <cit> . an assay that delivers a z' of higher than  <dig>  is considered to be robust. the z' was determined using the following equation:



for mbp, high z' values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  were obtained for phosphorylation using pkcα and irak <dig>  respectively. for phas- <dig> the values were  <dig>  and for histone h <dig>  <dig> . table  <dig> summarizes the statistical values obtained for the three different substrates.

discussion
despite the existence of several different technologies to monitor phosphorylation reactions of kinases, the detection of protein substrate phosphorylation has been limited to antibody-based assays, radioactive assays or assays that measure atp consumption rather than specific kinase activity. antibody-based assays are restricted to available, purified antibodies, usually directed against phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues and may have low affinity and be specific to only a single kinase. due to safety concerns over radioisotope handling as well as cost, drug screening efforts are rapidly moving toward non-radioactive and non-antibody-based assays. fp fulfills these criteria. however, since fp signal is correlated with changes in molecular rotation rates within the fluorescence life time and since only molecules smaller than approximately  <dig> kda show significant rotation within this range most protein substrates are not directly measurable by fp  <cit> . a prompt fluorescence quench assay relies upon the binding of a phosphate coordinating metal ion to the phosphate group on a substrate, which is labeled with a dye  <cit> . upon association of the metal ion, fluorescence is quenched. similar to fret assays, the rapid drop in signal with increasing distance between donor and acceptor molecules makes such assays unsuitable for the detection of protein phosphorylation, even if the proteins could be labeled with appropriate dyes  <cit> . the qtl lightspeed™ protein assay is a novel non-radioactive and non-antibody-based assay that follows a simple mix and measure protocol for the quantitative detection of protein phosphorylation. unmodified proteins can be used as substrates, thus allowing for the integrity of protein structure, which may be a requirement for successful recognition and phosphorylation by kinases. our experiments utilized  <dig>  μg mbp for phosphorylation by pkcα and irak <dig>  thus moving the assay into the realm of hts with regard to cost effectiveness. in this report, we describe the use of relatively small proteins mbp and phas- <dig>  and show feasibility for the larger protein histone h <dig>  as well. since our assay does not rely on site-specific antibodies, the phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine residues is possible.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate that a modified version of our qtl lightspeed™ platform provides a simple and robust assay for monitoring protein phosphorylation. the platform does not employ radioactive labels or antibodies, which makes it specific as well as time and cost-effective. we show that the assays for pkcα are suitable for drug compound screening by obtaining ic <dig> values of an atp-analog which are very close to those reported in the literature for this compound. for irak <dig>  reported values were not available. thus, it is reasonable that our assay is also well-suited for the identification of inhibitors that are not atp-site directed competitors. further applications of the assay could be the detection of autophosphorylated kinases or other proteins that play a role in cell signaling. finally, the qtl lightspeed™ platform can be used to further identify novel protein substrates for specific kinases.
