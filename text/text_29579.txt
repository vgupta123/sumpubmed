BACKGROUND
the single-celled flagellated eukaryotes of the group kinetoplastids include notorious human pathogens such as trypanosoma and leishmania. mitochondrial  genomes of numerous trypanosomatids have been sequenced, with complete and nearly complete mtdna sequences available for five species: leishmania tarentolae , trypanosoma brucei , t. cruzi , crithidia oncopelti , leptomonas seymouri , and major portions of mtdna for two other members of the group: leishmania major , leptomonas collosoma . for a review, see  <cit> .

the unassigned open reading frame  murf <dig> in t. brucei mtdna has been known for  <dig> years, but until today, there is no protein of known function that shares significant sequence similarity with this orf  <cit> . in a recent study, we conducted a comprehensive function prediction of all hypothetical mitochondrion-encoded proteins using a machine-learning-based classifier mops  <cit> . this classifier does not rely on sequence similarity but rather on a host of other features including physico-chemical properties of proteins, and hence should be able to detect remote homologs. mops predicted, but only with moderate support, murf <dig> of the kinetoplastid phytomonas serpens as subunit  <dig>  of the nadh-ubiquinone oxidoreductase  or complex i of the electron transport chain – a multi-complex pathway embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane. nadhdh is the largest complex of this pathway with ~ <dig> distinct subunits, seven of which are usually encoded in the mitochondria. we chose to scrutinize this function assignment in detail, motivated by several reasons: the long-standing controversy surrounding murf <dig>  the large available body of related biological knowledge, and the significance of this organismal group for human health  <cit> .

RESULTS
as mentioned in the background, the hypothetical protein murf <dig> was predicted by the automated similarity-free classifier mops to be a divergent nadhdh subunit  <dig> . to test this prediction, we conducted the following analyses.

sequence – sequence comparison
blast searches of phytomonas murf <dig> sequence against nrdb or uniprot did not result in any informative hits, but identified all the murf <dig> homologs from other kinetoplastids such as t. brucei, l. tarentolae, etc. in contrast, fasta searches against uniprot returned, after murf <dig> homologs, nadhdh subunit  <dig> from the kinetoplastid crithidia as top informative hit with an e-value of  <dig> e- <dig>  followed by nad <dig> from the red alga chondrus crispus with an e-value of  <dig> e- <dig>  a list of all hits and their corresponding e-values is compiled in table  <dig> 

profile – sequence comparison
for the identification of distantly related sequences, methods that exploit profiles  are more sensitive than those based on pairwise alignment such as blast and fasta. here, we used psi-blast to generate a murf <dig> profile and searched it against nrdb, but no other proteins beyond kinetoplastid murf <dig> sequences were found.

profile hmm – profile hmm comparison
our hypothesis is that murf <dig> is a highly derived distant homolog of nad <dig>  we used profile hmm – profile hmm comparison because it is the most sensitive method in identifying distant homologs. in contrast to simple sequence profiles, profile hidden markov models  contain extra information about insertions/deletions and gap scores. hhsearch , was shown to outperform profile – sequence comparison methods such as psi-blast and hmmer, profile – profile comparison tools such as prof_sim and compass and the other hmm – hmm comparison tool prc  <cit> .

we built a profile hmm for murf <dig> from the multiple alignment of several kinetoplastid murf <dig> sequences. using hhsearch, we searched this profile hmm against the profile hmms available in pfam, panther, cog and tigr. in most cases, the top hit was to the "nadh-ubiquinone/plastoquinone " profile hmm, which was built from  <dig> distinct subunits of different function. though these subunits are non-homologous proteins, pfam puts them all together in to a single family because they share high hydrophobicity . only the search against the cog database returned a specific subunit as top hit, i.e., nad <dig>  hhsearch results are summarized in table  <dig> 

to narrow down the exact function of murf <dig>  we generated profile hmms for all  <dig> subunits of nadhdh. for that, we clustered the protein sequences of all nadhdh subunits at different identity thresholds ranging from 40% to 75%, constructed a multiple sequence alignment for each of the subunits at each threshold, and generated a total of  <dig> profile hmms. we then searched the murf <dig> profile hmm against all the profiles of nadhdh subunits. as expected for remote homologs, the scores are relatively low. the six top hits are nad <dig> with an e-values ranging from  <dig> e- <dig> to 1e- <dig>  the e-value of the other subunit best hits is  <dig> orders of magnitude worse .

a probability, e-value, identity and score for each hit were reported by hhsearch

b the number following the subunit name is the sequence identity threshold used for clustering the sequences from which we generate the profile hmm. for example, nad2_ <dig>  profile hmm is generated by clustering all known nad <dig> sequences at 45% sequence identity threshold using cd-hit.

discussion
while sequence – sequence comparison and profile hmm – profile hmm comparison point to murf <dig> being a subunit of nadhdh, profile – profile comparison against the profile hmms of individual subunits of nadhdh is able to clearly assign murf <dig> to nad <dig>  in the following, we will confront this in silico prediction with the available biological knowledge. if the murf <dig> protein of trypanosomes is indeed nad <dig>  then the following criteria must apply.

 <dig>  there should be no previously annotated nad <dig> gene in either mitochondrial or nuclear genomes of kinetoplastids. a nad <dig> gene has not been reported in any mitochondrial genome of kinetoplastids. recently, the sequence of the nuclear genome became available for the p. serpens  <cit> . neither genome nor est data  indicate the presence of this gene.

 <dig>  there should be numerous precedents for nad <dig> being encoded by mtdna. the nad <dig> gene is mtdna-encoded by the large majority of eukaryotes . the rare species that lack this mitochondrial gene also lack other nadh subunits .

 <dig>  the murf <dig> gene should be transcribed. evidence for murf <dig> being expressed rather than being a spurious orf is provided by several observations. first, the deduced amino acid sequence is conserved across trypanosomes, despite considerable divergence at the nucleotide level. second, transcription of this gene has been demonstrated in p. serpens  <cit> .

 <dig>  rotenone-sensitive nadh dehydrogenase complex i should be present in kinetoplastids. the presence of complex i has been biochemically confirmed in trypanosoma and phytomonas  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
on all accounts enumerated above, the biological knowledge reinforces the in silico prediction. together, this provides convincing evidence that murf <dig> is a highly derived homolog of nad <dig>  for illustration purpose, fig.  <dig> depicts the multiple protein sequence alignment of the most conserved block of known nad <dig> proteins and kinetoplastid murf <dig> sequences.

outlook
notably, a functional nadhdh is crucial to the survival of trypanosomes. under aerobic conditions , nadhdh is required as a component of the respiratory chain, to catalyze electron transport toward complex iv. the thus generated proton gradient is utilized for atp synthesis. under anaerobic conditions , a functional nadhdh is equally essential. in the blood stream of mammals, nadhdh provides electrons for the alternative oxidase, a pathway required for maintaining the balance of nadh/nad+ in the cell. this confirms that trypanosomes depend on a functional nadhdh. in fact, atovaquone, an anti-leishmanial drug, inhibits the nadhdh activity in p. serpens and this inhibition was suggested to underlie the anti-leishmanial activity of that drug  <cit> . in this context, the identification of murf <dig> as a divergent nad <dig> could offer new avenues to the prevention or treatment of trypanosomatid-caused diseases.
