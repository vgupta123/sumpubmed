BACKGROUND
fundamental to evolutionary biology is the development and implementation of molecular phylogenetic methods  <cit> . these methods provide the means to reconstruct the past evolutionary history of biological entities given present-day molecular data, such as dna. considering kimura’s neutral theory of molecular evolution, it is logical to apply a stochastic model at the level of dna substitutions to construct probabilistic description of what molecular alignments are expected to be observed, given a proposed evolutionary history . is commonly implemented assuming an iid  and markov process for dna substitution, leading to a model that has a continuous-time markov chain at its core .

in a series of papers, hendy and colleagues introduced the hadamard conjugation as a novel tool for phylogenetic analyses . they found an invertible relationship between a phylogenetic tree, as characterized by its edge length spectrum, and the probability distribution of site patterns . originally introduced only for the 2-state symmetric model, the hadamard conjugation was later extended to the k3st model  and further to any of the so-called “group-based” models  <cit> . hadamard conjugation has been used as both a tool for simulation  <cit>  and to look at statistical properties of methods, exploring the inconsistency of parsimony under a molecular clock  <cit> . for these sorts of applications, following the notation in felsenstein  <cit> , we can use the hadamard transform h to start with an edge length spectrum γ and calculate the sequence spectrum s=h− <dig> log. the beauty of hadamard conjugations is that one can also begin with an observed sequence spectrum ŝ and perform the inverse of the conjugation to empirically obtain an edge length spectrum γ^=h−1log. although it is not expected that the γ^ spectrum will precisely match a tree, hendy  <cit>  proposed using an optimisation criterion to map from γ^ to the “closest tree”.

several authors have commented that it is potentially a useful feature of hadamard conjugation that data isn’t forced onto a fixed tree. the conflicting information can be retained and interpreted in the form of a “lentoplot”  <cit>  or a splits-graph  <cit> , with both of these methods implemented in spectronet  <cit> . schliep  <cit>  gives some more statistical justification for such an approach by making a link to modern statistical techniques such as the lasso and ridge regression.

von haeseler and churchill  <cit>  seems to be the first paper that explicitly suggests using hadamard conjugation to provide a likelihood framework for networks. the principle idea in this work was to start with an edge length spectrum that encodes a set of incompatible splits, use the hadamard transformation to get site probabilities and use these to determine a likelihood. this idea was further explored by bryant  <cit> , and bryant  <cit>  followed this through defining the “n-taxon process” for group-based models. it should be noted that likelihoods calculated via hadamard are not equivalent to likelihoods calculated by taking a mixture of trees. indeed, matsen and steel  <cit> , matsen et al.  <cit>  used hadamard methods in combination with phylogenetic invariants to show that mixtures of trees with the same topology can exactly mimic another tree under the 2-state model. considering biological applications, thinking in terms of mixtures of trees or partitions where the data can be thought of as arising on a set of trees  seems more reasonable than the hadamard conjugation. strimmer and moulton  <cit>  suggested using split networks as a spring board to likelihood-based analyses on dags, but later identified several problems with the approach  <cit> ; most notably, in split-networks internal nodes do not have a biological interpretation as an ancestor.

in sumner et al.  <cit> , we gave some additional insight into the interpretation of applying the hadamard conjugation in a network setting. we showed that permutation group structure inherent to the hadamard transformation – as for any group-based model – restricts the resulting process from being capable of reproducing truly convergent processes. this is a serious limitation, as one of the biological motivations for explicit network models is the ability to model convergent processes. we also presented an alternative algebraic formalism for the general markov model, analogous to the n-taxon process, but capable of reproducing convergent processes.

from the point of view of group representation theory, the inversion of group-based models relies on the fact that the irreducible representations of an abelian group are one-dimensional, and the model structure essentially reduces to analysing group characters – hence the standard presentation of a fourier inversion. in this article, we make this connection concrete. for the general markov model, it is then immediately apparent that an analogous inversion is not possible because the algebraic structure underlying the model is not abelian and hence the irreducible representations are not one-dimensional. in fact, to obtain one-dimensional representations for the general markov model, it is necessary to apply higher-degree polynomial maps , and define “markov invariants”  <cit> . these invariants present one-dimensional representations but at the cost of the higher degree – degree  <dig> in the case of the general markov model with four states on quartet trees  <cit> . this connection between hadamard transformation and markov invariants is an interesting one, but we do not discuss it further here.

in this paper we approach the inversion of group-based phylogenetic models by taking a representation-theoretic perspective and working explicitly with tensor indices. our approach rests heavily on the formalism of “phylogenetic tensors”, as presented in bashford et al.  <cit> , for the binary-symmetric and k3st model, and sumner et al.  <cit> , for the general markov model.

although the main inversion results presented here are not more general than those in in székely et al.  <cit> , we think it is important to reformulate them using the language of tensors and representation theory. this viewpoint has already led to new approaches for modeling convergent evolution  <cit>  and for studying non-group-based models  <cit> . however, in none of our previous work was the link to hadamard conjugation explicitly discussed. by presenting an old technique  in a new light we hope to introduce other researchers to the viewpoint of tensor analysis and representation theory.

methods
group-based models
we consider the continuous-time formulation of markov processes, and show how to implement the inversion of a group-based phylogenetic model based on any abelian group g. we note that such an inversion requires a map from tensor product space  to phylogenetic splits . we achieve this by finding canonical maps from bipartitions to ordered-n-partitions.

for a group g  with order |g|=d, we write g={σ <dig> σ <dig> …,σd}, and, when necessary, write ε∈g to specify the identity element of g. we will discuss the “regular representation” of g shortly, but skipping ahead we find that any rate matrix q occurring in a group-based markov model can be written in the form
  q=−λ1+∑ε≠σ∈gασkσ, 

where each 0≤ασ∈ℝ, λ=∑ε≠σ∈gασ and the kσ are the permutation matrices corresponding to the  group elements σ∈g.

for the reader interested in deriving this result, consider the d-dimensional vector space gℂ≡σ <dig> σ <dig> …,σdℂ={v=v1σ1+v2σ2+…+vdσd:vi∈ℂ}, with scalar multiplication and vector addition defined via
 v+λv′=+λ=σ1+σ2+…+σd, 

for all v,v′∈〈g〉ℂ and λ∈ℂ. the regular representation,ρreg:g→gl, is then defined by setting the group action
 σ:v↦σv=v1+v2+…+vd,  for all v∈〈g〉ℂ and σ∈g. if we fix {σ <dig> σ <dig> …,σd} as an ordered basis for 〈g〉ℂ, it is then clear – via cayley’s theorem – that each group element σ gets mapped to a permutation matrix kσ:=ρreg, with kσσi=∑jkσijσj:=σσi. thus kσ has matrix elements
  kσij= <dig> ifσj=σσi, <dig> otherwise. 

consider the unit column vectors
 ξ1=t,ξ2=t,…ξd=t;  and identify each σi∈gℂ with ξi∈ℂd, so that the group action becomes σ:ξi↦kσξi=ξj where σj=σσi. thus the matrix elements kσij have i as the column label and j as the row label.

a group-based markov model is then obtained by taking a continuous-time markov chain with state space g={σ <dig> σ <dig> …,σd} and using the group multiplication in g to assign a rate ασ to all substitutions σ1↦σ <dig> where σσ1=σ <dig>  following this through  we are led to the formula  for rate matrices in any group-based model.

the regular representation is one example of the general concept of a representation of g on a vector space v, defined as a homomorphism ρ:g→gl satisfying ρ=ρρ for all g <dig> g2∈g. a representation is said to be reducible if there exists a proper subspace u⊂v satisfying ρu⊂u, i.e. the set of matrices ρ send vectors in u back to u. in this case, u is called an invariant subspace. the representation ρ is then called irreducible if v does not contain any invariant subspaces.

the reader should note that the usual construction of a “group-based” model  <cit>  stipulates that g be abelian. although the construction just given using the regular representation allows for non-abelian g, we will nonetheless only consider the abelian case in this paper, because, as discussed in the introduction, it is only in the abelian case that a  inversion of phylogenetic models is possible. in this case the irreducible representations of g are all one-dimensional  <cit> , and hence the analysis reduces to computations with group characters, as is exploited in the previous approaches using fourier analysis  <cit> .

phylogenetic tensors
we denote :={ <dig> ,…,d} as the state space for a continuous-time markov chain. consider an n-taxa phylogenetic tree and a d-state phylogenetic pattern distribution {pi1i2…in}i <dig> i <dig> …,in∈d with the interpretation that pi1i2…in is the probability that the observed state at the kth leaf on the tree is ik. as is shown in sumner and jarvis  <cit>  and in more detail in sumner et al.  <cit> , such phylogenetic pattern distributions can be represented abstractly as tensors in the n-fold tensor product space ⊗nℂd:=ℂd⊗ℂd⊗…⊗ℂd, as follows. if we choose {ξ <dig> ξ <dig> …,ξd} as an ordered basis for ℂd, and ordered basis {ξi1⊗ξi2⊗…⊗ξid}i <dig> i <dig> …,in∈d for the tensor product space, a “phylogenetic tensor” p∈⊗nℂd is then defined as
 p=∑i <dig> i <dig> …,in∈dpi1i2…inξi1⊗ξi2⊗…⊗ξin. 

for readers who are unfamiliar with tensor products, it is possible to understand the general concept via the definition of the “kronecker” product of a n×m matrix a and a n′×m′ matrix b as the nn′×mm′ matrix given by



we can index the matrix a⊗b with row indicies i1j1= <dig> ,…,nn′ and column indices j1j2= <dig> ,…,mm′, i.e. generically i1j <dig> i2j2=ai1i2bj1j <dig> and specifically  <dig> =a13b <dig>  this point of view is useful if one wants to write out specific matrix representations of tensors, however, in the development that follows will focus heavily on the indexing of tensor components in the various cases discussed.

suppose π=∑i∈dπiξi∈ℂd represents the state distribution of a single taxa, i.e. πi is the probability that a randomly chosen site in the sequence will be in state i. now suppose a phylogenetic branching event occurs and the sequence is copied. the corresponding phylogenetic tensor p=∑i <dig> i2∈dpi1i2ξi1⊗ξi <dig> representing the joint distribution of the two-taxa just after the branching event then has the property that pi1i2=πi <dig> if i2=i <dig> and is zero otherwise. thinking in terms of tensor operations, we find that phylogenetic branching events can be generated by a linear operator δ:ℂd→ℂd⊗ℂd determined by δ=p and defined in general using our chosen basis as
 δ:=ξi⊗ξi,δ=δ∑iπiξi=∑iπiδ=∑iπiξi⊗ξi. 

the remarkable fact for group-based models, central to the present article, is that the permutation matrices “intertwine” particularly simply with the branching operator:
 δ=δ)=ξσ⊗ξσ=kσ⊗kσ·δ. 

thus, for any rate matrix q arising from a group-based model, we have :
  δ·q=−λ1⊗1+∑ε≠σ∈gασkσ⊗kσ·δ. 

we also note that, since q can be expressed a linear combination of permutation matrices representing elements in a group g, the matrix powers q <dig> q <dig> q4… will also be expressible as linear combinations of the same permutation matrices . together with , this implies that, for any substitution matrix eqt arising from matrix exponentiation,
  δ·eqt=e−λexp∑ε≠σ∈gασkσ⊗kσ·δ. 

this relation shows that mathematically, and hence conceptually, “markov evolution on a single followed by a branching event” can be replaced with “branching event on a single taxon followed by  markov evolution of two taxa.” this equivalence is illustrated in figure  <dig>  and should be compared to the equivalent discussion of the “n-taxa process” given in  <cit>  and  <cit> .markov evolution on a single followed by a branching event , is equivalent to a branching event on a single taxon followed by correlated markov evolution of two taxa . mathematically, this equivalence can be implemented by exploiting the equality given in .



in sumner et al.  <cit>  we showed how to generalise this intertwining action to the case of the general markov model. interestingly, for the general markov model the appropriate intertwining has quite a different structure from what occurs in group-based models, and hence the simplicity of  is somewhat misleading in general. we refer the reader to sumner et al.  <cit>  for more discussion on this point.

returning to the case of group-based models, for each subset a⊆, we define a linear map on ⊗nℂd as the tensor product kσ:=kσa1⊗kσa2⊗…⊗kσan where ai= <dig> if i∈a and  <dig> otherwise. for example, if n= <dig>  we have
 kσ=kσ⊗kσ⊗1⊗kσ⊗ <dig>  

to develop a phylogenetic tensor on a tree, we root the phylogenetic tree at taxon n, and label edges by subsets ∅≠e⊆, where i∈e if the path from taxon n to taxon i crosses the edge labelled by e. a five taxon tree with this labelling, is presented in figure  <dig>  to each edge labelled by ∅≠e⊆, we assign the rate matrix
 qe:=−λe1+∑ε≠σ∈gαeσkσ, figure  <dig> 
a six taxa tree rooted at taxon  <dig> with edges labelled by subsets of { <dig> , <dig> ,5}.




where each αeσ≥ <dig> is the rate of substitution for all states σ <dig> to σ <dig> satisfying σ=σ2σ1− <dig>  and λe=∑σ∈gαeσ. each edge is then assigned substitution matrix me=eqe, so that the time parameter for each edge is absorbed into the definition of qe.

now iterating  multiple times, bashford et al.  <cit>  show that any phylogenetic tensor can be written as
  p=e−λexp∑∅≠e⊆n− <dig> σ∈gαeσkσ·δn−1π. 

where λ=∑∅≠e⊆n−1λe=∑∅≠e⊆n− <dig> ε≠σ∈gαeσ, and δn−1π is the d×d×…×d tensor that represents the “zero edge-length star tree” distribution on n taxa. it is this form of phylogenetic tensors that will do a lot of the heavy lifting in the discussion that follows. the reader should note that under this representation, there is no need for the edge parameters αeσ:∅≠e⊆n− <dig> σ∈g to be chosen to be compatible with a particular tree, hence the possibilities for generalising to non-tree-like or network models, as discussed in the introduction.

the stationary distribution for group-based models is uniform . in this paper we always assume a stationary distribution, so that:
 π=1dt, 

and δn−1π has tensor components
 δn−1πi1i2…in=1d,ifi1=i2=…=in, <dig> otherwise. 

this concludes our discussion of the tensor presentation of phylogenetic probability distributions under group-based models. it is important to note that everything discussed so far works for any group-based model, with no requirement that the underlying group g be abelian.

in what follows, we discuss the inversion of abelian group-based models. we present the simplest case with g=ℤ2; the g=ℤ <dig> case; the g=ℤ2×ℤ <dig> case; the general g=ℤr case; and finally we discuss the case of any abelian group.

RESULTS
the binary-symmetric case
we begin with the inversion of the so-called “binary-symmetric” model. consider ℂ <dig> with standard basis
 ξ0= <dig> ξ1= <dig>  

as a group-based model, the binary-symmetric model arises by taking the group
 g:=ℤ2={ <dig> }+≅σ|σ2=ε, 

with a generic rate matrix given by
 q=−111−1=−1+k, 

where k= <dig> is the permutation matrix representing σ in the standard basis.

now ρreg:ℤ2→𝕄 <dig>  with σ↦k, is the regular representation of ℤ <dig>  and the character table of ℤ <dig> given in table  <dig> is easily recognised to be the hadamard matrix
 h=111− <dig>  table  <dig> 
the character table of
ℤ2


id
sgn


as ℤ <dig> is an abelian group, the irreducible representations are one-dimensional.

the corresponding projection operators can be read off from the columns of the character table. that is, the operators
 Θid:=12ε+σ,Θsgn:=12ε−σ; 

project ρreg=id⊕sgn onto the id and sgn representations of ℤ <dig>  respectively.

this observation prompts us to work in the alternative basis:
 f0:=Θid·ξ0=Θid·ξ1=hξ0=ξ0+ξ <dig> f1:=Θsgn·ξ0=−Θsgn·ξ1=hξ1=ξ0−ξ <dig>  

in this basis the permutation matrix is diagonal:
 k^:=hkh−1=100− <dig> q^:=−1+k^=000− <dig>  

the representation-theoretic perspective on k^ is to observe that id= <dig> and sgn=− <dig> 

referring to , we know that we can write a generic phylogenetic tensor as
 p=e−λexp∑∅≠e⊆n−1αek·δn−1π, 

where λ=∑∅≠e⊆n−1αe.

we index matrix and tensor indices by using i,j,k= <dig> ∈ℤ <dig> and allow multiplication × in the ring of integers . the hadamard matrix then has matrix elements ij=i×j where j is the row index and i is the column index. observe that in the diagonal basis, the permutation matrix has elements
 k^ij=δiji. 

thus we have expressions such as
 k^i1i2i3j1j2j3=δi1j1δi2j2δi3j3i2+i <dig>  

where k^=1⊗k^⊗k^.

as we are dealing with tensors of arbitrary size, it is convenient to represent a string such as i1i2…in as an ordered-bipartitionμ=μ0:μ <dig> of the set , where μ <dig> μ1⊆ with j∈μk if and only if ij=k. for example we have the following equivalences:
 00110≡{ <dig> ,5}:{ <dig> },01111≡{1}:{ <dig> , <dig> },10001≡{ <dig> ,4}:{ <dig> } 

and inequivalence:
 01010≡{ <dig> ,5}:{ <dig> }≠{ <dig> }:{ <dig> ,5}≡ <dig>  

we then have
 k^i1i2…inj1j2…jn=k^μν=k^μ0:μ1ν0:ν1=δμ0ν0δμ1ν1|e∩μ1|. 

defining h:=h⊗h where h:=h, in the diagonal basis p^:=h·p and using our notation h has tensor components
 hμν=hμ0:μ1ν0:ν1=hi1i2…inj1j2…jn=i1×j1+i2×j2+…+in×jn=|μ1∩ν1|. 

the zero edge-length star-tree initial distribution has tensor components
 δn−1πi1i2…in=12δi1i2δi1i3…δi1in, 

. in the diagonal basis with δn−1π^:=h·δn−1π, we have components
 δn−1π^i1i2…in=12∑j <dig> j <dig> …,jni1×j1+i2×j2+…+in×jnδj1j2δj1j3…δj1jn=12∑j1i1+i2+…+in×j1=121+i1+i2+…+in, 

which is exactly the statement
 δn−1π^μ=δn−1π^μ0:μ1=121+|μ1|. 

since k^ is diagonal in the transformed basis, we can conclude that
 p^μ=p^μ0:μ1=e−λexp∑∅≠e⊆ <dig> nαek^μ0:μ1μ0:μ1121+|μ1|. 

of course many of these tensor components will be zero and we would like to ignore these.

take u=u0:u <dig> as an ordered bipartition of the reduced set , so that u≡i1i2…in− <dig> where j∈uk if and only if ij=k, and define
 γ= <dig> if|u1|is even, <dig> if|u1|is odd;=2−0|u0|+1|u1|, 

and interpret u·γ as a string: u·γ = i1i2…in−1γ.

if we make the definitions
 pu:=p^u·γ,ηu:=12∑∅≠e⊆n−1αek^u·γu·γ, 

then we can write the non-zero components as
 pu=e−λexpηu, 

with inverses
  ηu=lnpu+λ. 

this is the first part of the inversion.

we would like to go further and actually recover the individual edge weights αe. to do this we define the  2n−1×2n− <dig> matrix f with components
 fue:=k^u·γu·γ=|e∩u|=hue, 

with e a subset and u an ordered-bipartition of . as h2=12n− <dig>  we see that f provides its own inverse f− <dig> with components
 f−1eu:=12n−1fue. 

defining the column vectors α→=αe and η→=ηu, we can write the matrix equations
 η→=fα→,α→=f−1η→. 

together with the first part of the inversion , these equations give a one-one map between pattern probabilities and edge weights for the binary-symmetric model.

inversion of the ℤ <dig> model
taking confidence from the previous case we now discuss the inversion of the group-based phylogenetic model with g=ℤ <dig>  we take
 ℤ3={ <dig> ,2}+≅〈σ|σ3=ε〉,  and, by analogy to the ℤ <dig> case, index tensors with indices i,j= <dig> , <dig> and allow multiplication × by extending ℤ <dig> to the ring 𝔽3={ <dig> ,2}+,×.

in this case a generic rate matrix is given by
 q=−βαα−ββα−=−α+β1+αk1+βk <dig>  

where
 k1= <dig> k2= <dig>  

are the matrices representing the permutations σ≅ and σ2≅ under the regular representation, respectively.

we define ω=e2πi/ <dig>  and present the character table of ℤ <dig> in table  <dig>  the decomposition of the regular representation is ρreg=id⊕ω⊕ω <dig>  and the columns of the character table give the projection operators onto the  irreducible subspaces:
 Θid:=13ε+σ+σ <dig> Θω:=13ε+ωσ+ω2σ <dig> Θω2:=13ε+ω2σ+ωσ <dig>  table  <dig> 
the character table of
ℤ3

therefore, the matrix
 f=1111ωω21ω2ω, 

diagonalizes the generic rate matrix for this model:
 q^=fqf−1=0000αω+βω2000αω2+βω, 

or, equivalently,
 k^1=fk1f−1=1000ω000ω <dig> k^2=fk2f−1=1000ω2000ω. 

we recall our basic result  that for group-based models, a generic phylogenetic tensor can be expressed as
 p=e−λexp∑∅≠e⊆n−1αek1+βek2·δn−1π, 

where λ=∑∅≠e⊆n−1αe+βe. we take the stationary distribution as initial distribution, so π= <dig> ,13t.

the matrix elements of f can be expressed as ij=ωi×j, where we extend i,j∈ℤ <dig> to include multiplication × from the ring of integers . similarly,
 k^1ij=δijωi,k^2ij=δiji. 

more generally, tensorial components can be expressed as
 1⊗k1^⊗k1^i1i2i3j1j2j3=δi1j1δi2j2δi3j3ωi2+i <dig>  

we represent a string i1i2…in as an ordered-tripartition, i1i2…in≡μ=μ0:μ1:μ <dig>  of the set , where j∈μk if and only if ij=k. for example, if we take n= <dig>  we have:
 00000≡{ <dig> , <dig> ,5}:∅:∅,20120≡{ <dig> }:{3}:{ <dig> },01122≡{1}:{ <dig> }:{ <dig> }. 

taking n =  <dig>  we have
 k^1μν=1⊗k^1⊗k^1μν=1⊗k^1⊗k^1μ0:μ1:μ2ν0:ν1:ν2=δμνω|μ1∩{ <dig> }|+2|μ2∩{ <dig> }|, 

and in general:
 k^1μν=δμνω|e∩μ1|+2|e∩μ2|,k^2μν=δμνω|e∩μ2|+2|e∩μ1|. 

taking the uniform distribution as initial distribution, the initial star-tree distribution can be written as
 δn−1πi1i2…in=13δi1i2δi1i3…δi1in. 

defining f=f⊗f where f=f, we have
 fμν=fi1i2…inj1j2…jn=fi1j1fi2j2…finjn=ωi1×j1+i2×j2+…+in×jn, 

and in the transformed basis, where δn−1π^:=f·δn−1π, we have
 δn−1π^i1i2…in=13∑j <dig> j <dig> …,jnωi1×j1+i2×j2+…+in×jn×δj1j2δj1j3…δj1jn=13∑j1ωj1×=131+ωi1+i2+…+in+i1+i2+…+in. 

indexing by ordered-tripartitions, we conclude that
 δn−1π^μ=131+ωi1+i2+…+in+i1+i2+…+in=131+ω|μ1|+2|μ2|+|μ1|+2|μ2|. 

now suppose |μ1|+2|μ2|= <dig> , then
 δn−1π^μ=131+1+1= <dig>  

if |μ1|+2|μ2|= <dig> , then
 δn−1π^μ=131+ω+ω2= <dig>  

and if |μ1|+2|μ2|= <dig> , then
 δn−1π^μ=131+ω2+ω= <dig>  

thus we have found a basis where all the elements of the initial star-tree tensor are zero unless the tripartion μ satisfies |μ1|+2|μ2|= <dig> . crucially, this statement also holds for the phylogenetic tensor p^ because in this basis the rate matrices of this model are diagonal:
 p^μ=p^μ0:μ1:μ2=e−λexp12∑∅≠e⊆n−1αek1+βek2μ0:μ1:μ2μ0:μ1:μ2×131+ω1|μ1|+ω2|μ2|. 

we deal with this condition on μ by taking u=u0:u1:u <dig> as an ordered-tripartion of the reduced set  and setting μ=u·γ  where
 γ= <dig> if|u1|+2|u2|= <dig> if|u1|+2|u2|=22;if|u1|+2|u2|=1=3−0|u0|+1|u1|+2|u2|. 

if we make the definitions
 pu:=p^u·γ,ηu:=∑∅≠e⊆n−1αek1+βek2u·γu·γ, 

we then have the first part of the inversion
  pu=e−λexpηu,ηu=lnpu+λ. 

as in the ℤ <dig> case, we would like to use ηu to recover the rate parameters αe,βe for all ∅≠e⊆ and thus complete the full inversion for this model. of course, it is little bit more difficult this time.

recall that μ=μ0:μ1:μ <dig> with μi⊆, whereas u=u0:u1:u <dig> with ui⊆, and ∅≠e⊆. considering
 k1μμ=ω|e∩μ1|+2|e∩μ2|, 

it follows that
 k1u·γu·γ=ω|e∩u1|+2|e∩u2|, 

and similarly
 k2u·γu·γ=ω|e∩u2|+2|e∩u1|. 

we make the observation that
 f1ue:=fu0:u1:u2ec:e:∅=ω|u1∩e|+2|u2∩e|=kαu·γu·γ, 

and
 f2ue:=fu0:u1:u2ec:∅:e=ω|u2∩e|+2|u1∩e|=kβu·γu·γ, 

where f <dig> and f <dig> are 2n−1×3n− <dig> matrices.

thus we may write
 ηu=∑∅≠e⊆n−1αef1ue+βef2ue. 

defining the column vectors α→={αe},β→={βe} and η→={ηu}, we can write
 η→=f1α→+f2β→, 

and define two 3n−1×2n− <dig> matrices g <dig> and g <dig> as
 g1eu:=f−1ec:e:∅u,g2eu:=f−1ec:∅:eu, 

where
 f−1=1111ωω21ω2ω, 

with ff−1= <dig> 

considering that
 ∑vf−1uvfvw=δuw, 

for all ordered-triparitions u,w of , we have the matrix products
 g1f1= <dig> g1f2= <dig> g2f2= <dig> g2f1= <dig>  

thus the second part of the inversion for this model is
 α→=g1η→,β→=g2η→. 

together with , these equations give a one-one map between pattern probabilities and edge weights for the group-based model with g=ℤ <dig> 

inversion of the k3st model
we now consider the k3st model  <cit>  which occurs as the group-based model with
 g=ℤ2×ℤ2={,,,}+≅〈,〉. 

in this model a generic rate matrix is given by
 q=−α+β+γ1+αk01+βk10+γk <dig>  

where
  k01=1⊗k= <dig> k10=k⊗1= <dig> k11=k⊗k= <dig>  

we already know that the 2× <dig> hadamard matrix h diagonalizes k, so we see immediately that h=h⊗h diagonalizes this model:
 k^01:=hk01h−1=1⊗hkh−1=10000−1000010000− <dig> k^10:=hk10h−1=1000010000−10000− <dig> k^11:=hk11h−1=10000−10000− <dig>  

of course h is the character table of ℤ2×ℤ <dig> and the permutation matrices , together with k00:= <dig>  give the regular representation ρreg≅id⊗id⊕id⊗sgn⊕sgn⊗id⊕sgn⊗sgn, where we recall the basic result that the tensor product of two irreducible representations of a group g gives an irreducible representation of g×g.

simplifying notation, for this model we index tensors with indices given as pairs: i,j= <dig> , <dig> ∈ℤ2×ℤ2; and we express the individual parts using lower case roman characters. for example, we write i:=ab= <dig>  with a= <dig> and b= <dig>  this gives matrix elements:
 k^01abcd=δacδbdb,k^10abcd=δacδbda,k^11abcd=δacδbda+b; 

and more complicated tensor products such as
 k^01⊗k^01⊗1a1b1a2b2a3b3c1d1c2d2c3d3=δa1c1δb1d1δa2c2δb2d2δa3c3δb3d3b1+b <dig>  

again we interpret strings such as μ≡a1a2…an and ν≡b1b2…bn as ordered-bipartitions μ=μ0:μ <dig> and ν=ν0:ν <dig> of the set . we can then write matrix elements of tensor products as
 k^01μ,νμ′,ν′=δμμ′δνν′|e∩ν1|,k^10μ,νμ′,ν′=δμμ′δνν′|e∩μ1|,k^11μ,νμ′,ν′=δμμ′δνν′|e∩μ1|+|e∩ν1|. 

taking the stationary distribution π=14t as initial distribution, the zero edge-length star-tree distribution is given by
 δn−1πi1i2…in=14δi1i2δi1i3…δi1in, 

which in the finer index representation is
 δn−1πa1b1a2b2…anbn=14δa1a2δa1a3…δa1anδb1b2δb1b3…δb1bn. 

recall that elements of the hadamard matrix can be written as hba=a×b, where a,b∈ℤ <dig> and we allow multiplication × by extending to the ring of integers . in the transformed basis, we have
 δn−1π^a1b1a2b2…anbn=δn−1π^μ,ν=14∑c <dig> c <dig> …,cnd <dig> d <dig> …,dnhc1a1hc2a2…hcnanhd1b1hd2b2…×hdnbnδa1a2δa1a3…δa1anδb1b2δb1b3…δb1bn=14∑c <dig> d1×c1+×d1=141+a1+…+an+b1+…+bn+a1+…+an+b1+…+bn= <dig> if either|μ1|or|ν1|is odd; <dig> if|μ1|and|ν1|are both even. 

we recall , so under this model we can express a generic phylogenetic tensor as
 p=e−λexp∑∅≠e⊆n−1αek01+βek10+γek11·δn−1π. 

to exclude the vanishing components we define, for all ordered bipartitions u=u0:u <dig> of the reduced set ,
 γ= <dig> if|u1|is even, <dig> if|u1|is odd;=2−, 

and intepret u·γ as the string u·γ=a1a2…an−1γ. then, for each pair u,v of ordered-bipartitions of , we define
 ηu,v:=∑∅≠e⊆n−1αek01+βek10+γek11u·γ,v·γu·γ,v·γ, 

and
 pu,v:=pu·γ,v·γ, 

this gives the inversion
 pu,v=e−λexpηu,v,ηu,v=λ+lnpu,v. 

consider the 2n×2n− <dig> rectangular matrices f <dig>  f <dig> and f <dig> with components
 f01u,ve=k01u,vu,v=|e∩v1|,f10u,ve=k10u,vu,v=|e∩u1|,f11u,ve=k11u,vu,v=|e∩u1|+|e∩v1|; 

where e⊆ and u=u0:u <dig> and v=v0:v <dig> are ordered-bipartitions of . if we define the column vector η→:={ηu,v} indexed by pairs of ordered-bipartitions and the column vectors α→:={αe}, β→:={αe} and γ→:={αe} indexed by subsets of , we then have the matrix equation
 η→=f01α→+f10β→+f11γ→. 

writing h=h⊗h with h=h, we note that
 f01u,ve=hu,v∅,e,f10u,ve=hu,ve,∅,f11u,ve=hu,ve,e; 

and define the 2n−1×2n rectangular matrices g <dig> g <dig> and g <dig> as
 g01eu,v=h−1∅,eu,v,g10eu,v=h−1e,∅u,v,g11eu,v=h−1e,eu,v. 

noting that
 ∑w,xh−1u,vw,xhw,xy,z=δu,yδv,z, 

for all u,v,y,z ordered-bipartitions of , we then have the matrix identities
 g01f01= <dig> g10f10= <dig> g11f11= <dig>  

and
 g01f10=0=g01f11=gβf11=g10f01=g11f01=g11f <dig>  

writing
 α→=g01η→,β→=g10η→,γ→=g11η→, 

completes the inversion for the k3st model.

inversion of the ℤr model
we now consider the group based model for ℤr= <dig> , <dig> …+≅〈σ:σr=e〉. for this model the generic rate matrix has the form
 q=−λ1+∑i=1rαikσi, 

where λ=∑i=1rαi and
 kσ=00…011000001…00⋮⋮⋱⋮⋮00… <dig>  

so that kσi=kσi.

defining ω=e2πi/r, we have ωr= <dig> and 1+ω+ω2+…+ωr−1= <dig> and fij=ωij where i,j= <dig> , <dig> …,r− <dig>  of course, f is the character table of ℤr and f−1ji=1rω−ij.

lemma <dig> 
 ∑νf⊗f⊗…⊗fμνf−1⊗f−1⊗…⊗f−1νμ′=δμμ′, 

where μ,ν,μ′ are ordered-r-partitions of the set  defined by the strings i1i2…in, j1j2…jn and k1k2…kn, respectively.

proof.
the result is obvious by the definition of tensor product. however, explicitly we have
 ∑νf⊗f⊗…⊗fμνf−1⊗f−1⊗…⊗f−1νμ′=1rn∑0≤j <dig> j <dig> …,jr−1≤×ωi1j1+i2j2+…ir−1jr−1ω−j1k1+j2k2+…+jnkn=1rn∑0≤j <dig> j <dig> …,jr−1≤×ωj1+j2+…+jn 

which clearly equals  <dig> if iℓ−kℓ= <dig> for all ℓ, and, by repeatedly applying 1+ω+ω2+…+ωr−1= <dig>  equals  <dig> otherwise.

the regular representation contains exactly one copy of every irreducible representation and the irreducible representations of ℤr are given by the powers of ω:
 ρi:ℤr→ℂσ↦ωi. 

thus the change of basis kσi↦k^σi=fkσif− <dig> will give diagonal matrices k^σi. additionally,

lemma <dig> 
in the diagonal basis, the matrices k^σi:=fkσif− <dig> have matrix elements given by k^σsij=ωisδij.

proof.
consider the matrix elements kσsij=δiσs. thus
 fkσsf−1ji=∑k,lωikδkσsω−lj=∑lωiσs−lj=∑lωi−lj=ωis∑lωl=ωisδij, 

where we have used ωσs=ωm+s.

now
 δn−1πi1i2…in=1rδi1i2δi1i3…δi1in, 

and
 δn−1π^i1i2…in=1r∑j <dig> j <dig> …,jrωi1j1+i2j2+…+injn×δj1j2δj1j3…δj1jn=1r∑j1ωj1=1ifi1+i2+…+in= <dig> otherwise. 

translating this result using the ordered-r-partitions for indices, we have

lemma <dig> 
in the diagonal basis, the uniform initial distribution on the star tree has components
 δn−1π^μ=1if0|μ0|+1|μ1|+2|μ2|+…+|μr−1|= <dig> otherwise., 

where μ=μ0:μ1:μ2:…:μr− <dig> is an ordered-r-partition of the set .

again recall that for this model a generic phylogenetic tensor can be written as
 p=e−λexp∑∅≠e⊆n− <dig> s∈r−1αeskσsδn−1π, 

where π=1rt. in the diagonal basis p^:=f·p and as a consequence of lemma 3p^ will have many vanishing components. to avoid these we take u=u0:u1:u2:…:ur− <dig> as an ordered-r-partition of  and set
 γ=r−0|u0|+1|u1|+2|u2|+…+|ur−1|. 

if we define pu:=p^u·γ and
 ηu:=∑∅≠e⊆n− <dig> s∈r−1αesk^σsu·γu·γ, 

we then have the first part of the inversion for the ℤr model:
 pu=e−λexpηu,ηu=lnpu+λ. 

for each i∈, we define the column vectors α→i:=αei∅≠e⊆n− <dig>  and, for each ∅≠e⊆ and u an ordered- -partition of , we define the rectangular rn−1×2n− <dig> matrices
 f1ue:=kσu·γu·γ,f2ue:=kσ2u·γu·γ,…fr−1ue:=kσr−1u·γu·γ, 

so we have the vector equation
 η=f1α1→+f2α2→+…+fr−1α→r− <dig>  

we claim that

lemma <dig> 
 f1ue=fuec:e:∅:∅:…:∅,f2ue=fuec:∅:e:∅:…:∅,⋯⋯fr−1ue=fuec:∅:∅:∅:…:e. 

proof.
we recall that k^σsij=ωisδij, so, for μ=μ0:μ1:μ2:…:μr− <dig> an ordered-r-parition of , and e a subset of  we have
 k^σsμμ=ωs0|μ0∩e|+1|μ1∩e|+…+|μr−1∩e|, 

so
 k^σsu·γu·γ=ωs0|u0∩e|+1|u1∩e|+…+|ur−1∩e|, 

because e⊆. on the other hand fij=ωij, so
 fuec:∅:…:∅:e:∅:…:∅=ωs0|u0∩e|+1|u1∩e|+…+|ur−1∩e|, 

where e appears in the sth position.

define, for i∈, the rectangular 2n−1×rn− <dig> matrices
 g1eu:=f−1u·γec·γ:e:∅:∅:…:∅g2eu:=f−1u·γec·γ:∅:e:∅:…:∅⋮gr−1eu=f−1u·γec·γ:∅:∅:∅:…:e. 

of course gifj=δij <dig>  so we now have the second part of the inversion:
 αi→=giη. 

inversion of any abelian group-based model
lemma <dig> 
any  abelian group g is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime-power order, ie. g≅ℤr1×ℤr2×…×ℤrq where each ri=pini where pi is prime and ni is a positive integer.

lemma <dig> 
the group-based model arising from the g is defined only up to group isomorphisms of g.

proof.
a generic rate matrix for the group-based model arsing from g is given by
 q=−λ1+∑e≠σ∈gασkσ. 

under a group isomorphism ϕ:g→g′, we have ϕ=ϕϕ.

recall , so that the matrix elements kσij is set via the action σi↦σσi=σj. if we consider the regular representation of g′ we then have kϕij defined by ϕ↦ϕϕ. now ϕϕ=ϕ=ϕ and, because ϕ is a group isomorphism, this occurs if and only if σσi=σj. thus kϕij=kσij for all i and j.

this means that we can restrict attention to a single representitive in the isomorphism class of g. of course, for this purpose we choose the representative guaranteed by lemma  <dig> 

thus, for any abelian group g, with generators σ <dig> σ <dig> …,σq the corresponding group-based model has rate generators given by
 lσ=−1+kσ1m1⊗kσ2m2⊗…⊗kσqmq, 

for all e≠σ=σ1m <dig> σ2m <dig> …,σqmq∈g, where kσi is the permutation matrix representing the generator σi∈ℤri. the character table f of g is simply the tensor product of the individual character tables of the ℤri:
 f=f1⊗f2⊗…⊗fq. 

in the diagonal basis we have matrix elements
 fkkσksfk−1ij=k^σksij=ωkisδij, 

where ωk is a kth root of unity. thus
 k^σ1m1⊗k^σ2m2⊗…k^σqmqi1i2…iqj1j2…jq=δi1j1δi2j2…δiqjqω1i1m1ω2i2m2…ωqiqmq. 

we write phylogenetic tensors for this model in the form
 pi11i12…i1n,i21i22…i2n……iq1iq2…iqn, 

where 0≤isj≤rs for all 0≤s≤q. we simplify notation by writing each group of indices as μ:=is1is2…isn where μ is an ordered- rs-partition of .

lemma <dig> 
in the diagonal basis, the uniform initial distribution on the star tree has components
 δn−1π^μμ…μ= <dig> if0|μ0|+1|μ1|+…+|μr−1|=0∀i; <dig> otherwise. 

a generic phylogenetic tensor for this model can be expressed as
 p=e−λexp∑∅≠e⊆n−1si∈ri−1αes1s2…sqkσ1s1⊗kσ2s2⊗…⊗kσqsq·δn−1π, 

where π is the unifrom distribution on ∑i=1qri states, i.e.
 π=∑i=1qri− <dig> ,…,1t. 

in the diagonal basis p^=·p, and, as a consequence of the previous lemma, p has many vanishing components. to avoid these, for each i∈ we take u=u0:u1:u2:…:uri− <dig> as an ordered- ri-partition of  and set
 γi)=ri−0|u0|+1|u1|+2|u2|+…+|ur−1|. 

we then define
 puu…u:=p^u·γ1uu·γ2u…u·γ1u, 

and
 ηu…u:=∑∅≠e⊆n−1si∈ri−1αes1…sqk^σ1s1⊗…⊗k^σqsqu·γ1u…u·γ1)u·γ1u…u·γ1u, 

so that we have the first part of the inversion
 puu…u=e−λexpηuu…u,ηuu…u=λ+lnpuu…u. 

we define the column vectors α→s1s2…sq:=αes1s2…sq∅≠e⊆n− <dig> and η→:={ηuu…u} where ui is an ordered- ri-partition of , and we define the n−1×2n− <dig> matrices
 fs1s2…squ1u2…uqe:=kσ1s1u1·γu1·γkσ2s2u2·γu2·γ…kσqsquq·γuq·γ=f1u1ec:∅:…:∅:e:∅:…:∅f2u2ec:∅:…:∅:e:∅:…:∅……fquqec:∅:…:∅:e:∅:…:∅, 

where in each term e appears in the sith position and the equality follows from lemma  <dig> 

we can then write the vector equation
 η→=∑s1s2…sq:1≤si≤ri−1fs1s2…sqα→s1s2…sq. 

if we define the 2n−1×n− <dig> matrices
 gs1s2…sqeu1u2…uq=f1−1u1ec:∅:…:∅:e:∅:…:∅f2−1u2ec:∅:…:∅:e:∅:…:∅……fq−1uqec:∅:…:∅:e:∅:…:∅, 

where in each term e appears in the sith position, we have the orthogonality relations
 gs1s2…sqfs1′s2′…sq′=δs1s1′δs2s2′…δsqsq′ <dig>  

this gives us the second part of the inversion of any group-based model:
 α→s1s2…sq=gs1s2…sqη→. 

CONCLUSIONS
in this article we have given an alternative derivation of the inversion of group-based phylogenetic models. primarily our method relies on the remarkable intertwining relation between branching events and markov evolution , and the resulting simplified expression of phylogenetic tensors given in . from there we took a representation theoretic approach concentrating on the structure of tensor indices.
