BACKGROUND
insect salivary glands are the main organs for producing proteins that are injected into hosts  <cit> . plant-feeding insects, especially those with sucking mouthparts, inject proteins and other substances into host plants to facilitate mouthpart penetration, partially digest food before ingestion, and suppress plant defense  <cit> . substances, including proteins with regulatory roles that can alter host physiology, are referred to as effectors  <cit> . pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, oomycetes, and nematodes, deliver various effector proteins into host tissues  <cit> . substantial evidence suggests that some of the salivary proteins injected into host plants by insects also act as effectors to suppress defense and/or reprogram physiological pathways of host plants  <cit> . gall midges , a large family of plant-feeding insects, apparently secrete effectors into host tissues, inducing various forms of plant outgrowth  and altering other aspects of host physiology  <cit> . plant galls contain a zone of "metabolic habitat modification" in which the parasite experiences a selective advantage because of enhanced nutrition and reduced plant defense  <cit> . several organic compounds and enzymes injected into host plants by galling insects have been identified, including amino acids, auxin, proteases, oxidases, and pectinases  <cit> , but the general composition of the proteins delivered into host plants by gall midges has not yet been fully characterized.

the hessian fly, mayetiola destructor, is the most destructive insect pest of wheat worldwide  <cit> . because of its importance in agriculture, intriguing behavior, ease of maintenance in culture, and relatively well-characterized genetics, hessian fly is becoming a model species for studying insect-plant interactions  <cit> . hessian fly does not induce the formation of an outgrowth gall, but nutritive cells with similarity to those inside macroscopic galls are formed at the larval feeding site  <cit> . larvae do not cause extensive tissue damage to host plants, with their specialized mandibles making only a pair of small holes  <cit> . nevertheless, wheat plants become permanently and irreversibly stunted after 4- <dig> days of feeding by a single larva  <cit> . even if larvae are removed, growth of wheat seedlings cannot be restored  <cit> , suggesting that larvae inject substances into host plants that dramatically alter biochemical and physiological pathways of the attacked plant  <cit> .

as the first step to identify some of those proteins that are injected into host plants, we have previously generated numerous ests from cdnas derived from dissected salivary glands of hessian fly first instar larvae  <cit> . the majority of the salivary gland transcripts encode small proteins  with typical secretion signal peptides at the n-termini. we refer to these proteins as "small secreted salivary gland proteins" . here we report unusual conservation patterns of sssgp-encoding genes and we discuss potential mechanisms for gene evolution and functional adaptation.

RESULTS
unconventional conservation of sssgp-encoding genes
the sssgp- <dig> gene family includes seven members and is clustered as one inverted and six tandemly repeated genes within a  <dig> kb region of the genome . the predicted structures of the genes were verified by comparing the genomic sequences with cdna clones corresponding to genes sssgp-1a, sssgp-1b <dig>  sssgp-1c <dig> and sssgp-1d <dig> . all seven genes have a common structure, including a conserved putative promoter region, a 5'-untranslated region , a signal peptide-coding region , an intron, a mature protein-coding region , and a 3'-untranslated region . intergenic regions are small, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> kb . among the seven genes, sssgp-1a <dig>  present in the inverted repeat, was apparently recently duplicated and encodes an identical protein with sssgp-1a <dig>  the other six genes consist of highly diversified mpcrs as well as highly conserved regions, including the promoter region, 5'- and 3'-utrs, spcr, and the intron . the predicted proteins are almost identical in their putative signal peptides, but share little similarity among the mature proteins . this extreme pattern of diversification in mpcr, which we refer to here as super-diversification, coupled with strong conservation in other regions was also observed in several other groups of sssgp-encoding genes  or cdnas from hessian fly .

score average  and score range were derived by pair-wise comparison . except for the two members from group sssgp- <dig>  the score average for mpcr is at least 40% less than those for other regions. the two members from group sssgp- <dig> are likely relatively recent duplicates since they share an overall 83% sequence identity. the score average for these two members is 13% less than those for other regions.

except for the common features of diversification/conservation, there are no noticeable sequence or structural similarities between the different groups of sssgp genes, and no apparent sequence similarities could be detected among different groups with currently available alignment methods such as blast. most groups of sssgp genes contain one intron . however, one group lacks introns  and several other groups contain multiple introns . for those genes containing introns, the first  intron is located either at the boundary between the spcr and mpcr, or within the spcr . the positions of intron/exon boundaries are generally conserved among members within a group. however, deletions or shifts in intron/exon boundaries occur in gene groups with multiple introns . for all gene groups, multiple members in each group are clustered within short chromosome regions in the hessian fly genome .

to determine if such a genetic phenomenon exists in other gall midges, a similar analysis of salivary gland cdnas was conducted on two other related insects, the orange wheat blossom midge  and the asian rice gall midge . approximately  <dig>  cdnas from the wheat blossom midge and  <dig>  from the asian rice gall midge were sequenced. in each case, a similar proportion  of cdna clones was found encoding different sssgps. forty-eight different groups of putative sssgps were identified from the wheat blossom midge while  <dig> different groups of putative sssgps were identified from the asian rice gall midge. comparative analysis revealed that cdnas and their encoded proteins from the asian rice midge, wheat blossom midge, and hessian fly were typically found to be species-specific; cdnas from one species shared no detectable sequence similarity with those from the other two species, consistent with the rapidly evolving nature of sssgp-encoding genes. the species-specific nature of sssgp-encoding genes was further confirmed by pcr and by southern blot analysis. no pcr amplification could be achieved using primer pairs designed according to cdnas from another species. similarly, no cross hybridization could be observed on southern blots using cdna probes from a different species . the typical unconventional conservation pattern of sssgp-encoding genes observed in hessian fly was also found in some of the sssgp-encoding transcripts of the asian rice midge , but not in any transcripts of the wheat blossom midge. this observation indicates that the unconventional conservation of sssgp-encoding genes might be linked to adaption to environmental changes such as a change in host plants. even though they live on different plant species, the asian rice midge and hessian fly larvae share a similar feeding mechanism. larvae of both species feed on the meristem of a leaf-sheath within a plant, and their survival strictly depends on their ability to induce the formation of nutritive cells of plant tissue at the feeding site, to inhibit plant growth, and to suppress host defense  <cit> . wheat blossom midges, on the other hand, feed on developing wheat seeds and either do not require extensive manipulation of host plants such as growth inhibition  <cit> , or manipulate host plants in different ways.

several genes from different mosquito species have been found encoding diverse secreted salivary proteins and some of these genes are also organized as tandem repeats  <cit> . diverse toxic small peptides have been found in the venoms of predatory cone snails  <cit> . however, the extreme cases described here with a very short , highly diversified segment followed by a very short , highly conserved segment arranged as multiple tandem repeats has not been found in any other organisms.

strong positive selection on sssgp loci and alleles
strong positive  selection appears to be one of the forces driving diversifications in mpcrs. highly diversified members with less than 80% sequence identity within mpcrs did not produce meaningful alignments for analyzing nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution ratio , but the fact that the coding regions are hard to align is itself evidence for fast evolution by positive selection or other mechanisms such as y-family polymerases  <cit> . analysis of moderately diversified group members with  <dig> to 95% sequence identity in their mpcrs all yielded dn/ds above one . one pair of group members produced a dn/ds ratio above  <dig>  indicating very strong positive selection. due to the small size, similar sequences with greater than 95% sequence identity within mpcrs did not possess sufficient nucleotide substitutions to confidently discern evolutionary patterns through analyzing dn/ds. however, a different analysis of similar sequences derived from different alleles also produced strong evidence for positive selection .

dn/ds ratio were obtained by comparing mpcrs using paml <dig>  <cit> .

multiple transcripts corresponding to genes sssgp-1a <dig>  sssgp-1b <dig>  and sssgp-1c <dig> were isolated from three different hessian fly populations. these different transcripts were likely derived from different alleles since evidence from in situ hybridization, southern blots with genomic and bac dna samples, and primer specific pcr suggests a single locus for this gene family . the ratio between nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions was  <dig>  or more within the mpcr, but less than  <dig>  in the spcr , again indicating positive selection in mpcrs for different alleles.

cdnas were derived from three hessian fly populations: biotype gp, biotype l, and a syrian population . as a control, cdnas coding for  <dig> different ribosomal proteins  that were isolated along with sssgp cdnas were included in this analysis. sequence alignments for different sssgp cdnas are shown in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig> whereas alignments for rp cdnas are shown in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  "nonsyn/syn" represents the ratios of non-synonymous against synonymous substitutions in spcr and mpcr, respectively.

evidence for positive selection is not common but has been demonstrated at several different types of genes controlling interactions between organisms that are mediated by molecular recognition. typical examples are defense-related genes including the major histocompatibility complex  <cit> , immunoglobulins  <cit> , defensins  <cit> , plant resistance genes  <cit> , plant chitinase genes  <cit> , and pathogen effector genes  <cit> . the strong positive selection observed in sssgp-encoding genes indicated that sssgps are also likely involved in interactions between hessian fly and other organisms. considering that hessian fly larvae live within host plants, some of these sssgps may be secreted into host plants as effector proteins with a role in the insect's virulence. in plant-herbivore interactions, successful pathogens and parasitic arthropods not only require a large number of genes coding for effector proteins to suppress innate defense of host plants  <cit> , but also require the ability to change this arsenal in response to shifts in the host population  <cit> . evolution of plant populations in parasite recognition and surveillance systems thus provides strong selection for counter changes in effector proteins from parasites  <cit> . the hessian fly has been very successful in adaptation to changes in host plant populations  <cit> . the super-diversification in sssgp genes may have provided the genetic basis for the development of counter-resistance in hessian fly in response to changes in host plants.

concerted homogenization of noncoding regions
very strong selection for divergence could account for rapid divergence of mpcr but the high homology of the other regions of the genes is difficult to explain. recombination between gene-family members, particularly those arranged in tandem arrays, acts to homogenize their sequences so they evolve in a concerted fashion  <cit> . typically, however, this homogenization occurs throughout the whole gene and even the intergenic regions, not just specific domains in the genes. while crossover events would tend to homogenize the whole array, smaller gene conversion events might homogenize smaller regions. little is known about recombination in gall midges, but conversion tracts at the rosey locus of drosophila have been found to be in the order of a few hundred base pairs  <cit> . differences in sequence affinity among the various sub-regions of the sssgp- <dig> family members corroborate frequent recombination in short dna regions during hessian fly evolution . the homogenization could be confined to termini of the genes if the conversion events were initiated near the ends of the genes or in intergenic regions. the nature of recombination hotspots varies between species  <cit> , but they are commonly initiated intergenically  <cit> , possibly at specific sequence motifs  <cit>  or regulatory regions. sequence heterogeneity in the mpcr due to strong positive selection could, in turn, affect the length of conversion tracks or how the recombination intermediates are resolved; conversion or crossover events  <cit> . if the sequence homogeneity of the sssgp-encoding families was caused by concerted evolution from short conversion tracks initiated in the flanking regions, one would expect introns in the middle of the larger genes to be less homogenized. this is in fact what was observed in the sssgp- <dig> family; noticeably, several introns  were rearranged or deleted . the coding regions of the two sssgp- <dig> family members correspond to approximately  <dig> nucleotides with  <dig> introns.

to explore whether functional adaptation might explain conservation of certain regions of gene families  <cit> , we analyzed the patterns of transcript levels corresponding to specific genes under different conditions . in general, sssgps with higher sequence similarity in the promoter regions had more similar patterns of gene expression . sssgp-1a <dig>  sssgp-1a <dig>  sssgp-1b <dig>  and sssgp-1c <dig>  whose promoters were very similar , also exhibited similar expression patterns among tissues  and developmental stages , and among insects interacting with different plant genotypes . the promoters of sssgp-1c <dig>  and sssgp-1e <dig> were also similar to each other , and these two genes also exhibited similar transcription patterns. however, the genes in the first group  and the second group  had strikingly different expression patterns . small differences in the transcription patterns among members in the same promoter group were also observed. for example, sssgp-1c <dig> was expressed abundantly in  <dig> -day old larvae , whereas little sssgp-1e <dig> expression was observed in the same larvae . these differences could indicate that small differences in the promoter  of the genes can fine-tune the level of transcripts to satisfy specific requirements. these observations suggest that the conservation/diversification of the promoter regions has been strictly driven by functional adaptation.

the homogenization of 5'- and possibly even 3'-utrs may also have a functional basis. because utrs play critical roles in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression  <cit> , we speculate that the sssgp utrs are critical for proper post-transcriptional regulation. for example, part of the conserved utrs could serve as elements for binding with regulatory proteins or as pairing sites for interacting with micro-rnas that may affect rna stability or translation efficiency  <cit> . multiple layers of gene regulation may be needed to ensure spatial and tissue-specific expression and prompt response of sssgp-encoding genes to changes of host and other environmental conditions.

functional division of sssgps: initiators and maintainers
sssgps appear to have a division of labor, with "initiators" expressed only immediately after the start of feeding and "maintainers" expressed at later stages in the time course of feeding and plant response. initiators, such as sssgp-1c <dig> and sssgp-1e in the sssgp- <dig> family, were predominantly expressed in salivary glands  at early stage of larval development , and their expression was elevated at later time points in larvae feeding on resistant plants . these observations are consistent with the postulation that initiators are secreted into plant tissue as effectors to manipulate plant cells. hessian fly suppresses plant defense and induces the formation of nutritive cells within the first couple of days  <cit> . once the insect has successfully manipulated host plants, one would expect that the expression of initiators is no longer needed. indeed the manipulation of wheat seedlings is irreversibly achieved within the first few days following the hessian fly initial attack  <cit> . the elevated expression of initiators in larvae feeding on resistant plants at later stages may reflect the fact that hessian fly larvae continue to secret effectors to counter increased plant defense in these plants  <cit> .

maintainers, such as sssgp-1a, sssgp-1c <dig>  and ssgp-1c <dig>  were also expressed in other tissues besides the salivary glands . the proteins produced in malphigian tubules and carcass are unlikely to play a role in interaction with host plants, but could play a role in regulating hessian fly symbiotic or associated microbes in insect tissues  <cit> . in addition, some sssgps could also play a role in regulating secondary microbial infection of the host tissues damaged at the feeding site  <cit> . the maintainers may possess antimicrobial activity, and are under selection pressure from changes in microbial populations. further research on the network of these initiators and maintainers encoded by rapidly evolving genes will shed light on the biology and feeding behavior of gall midges.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we observed an unconventional conservation pattern in genes encoding sssgps in the hessian fly. in the sssgp-encoding genes, noncoding regions are highly conserved whereas regions coding for mature proteins are highly diversified. rapid diversification in mature sssgps suggests that the genes are under selection pressure for functional adaptation. considering the fact that most sssgp-encoding genes are exclusively expressed in salivary glands, it is likely that rapid diversification in sssgp-encoding genes is for the insect to counter changes in host plants for virulence. the conservation in the noncoding regions of these genes including introns also suggested potential mechanisms for sequence homogenization that are not yet fully understood. this report should be useful for future studies on genetic mechanisms involved in evolution and functional adaptation of parasite genes.
