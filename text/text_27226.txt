BACKGROUND
the evolution of reproductive phenotypes, and underlying selective forces, are the subject of much interest in evolutionary biology. sperm competition, one of these selective forces, is known to affect sperm phenotype in males competing for the fertilization of ova  <cit>  by driving adaptive changes of sperm morphology and function . however, it is not yet clear how changes at the molecular level are linked to adaptations in sperm phenotype.

responses to high levels of sperm competition include increases in sperm numbers, which are achieved by an increase in testes mass relative to body size  <cit> . relative testes mass is strongly associated to levels of sperm competition  <cit>  and genetic paternity  <cit> . thus, relative testes mass is widely used as proxy for level of sperm competition. additional responses to high levels of sperm competition are increases in sperm swimming velocity, total sperm size and sperm quality  . the morphology of sperm cells, particularly the sperm head, varies considerably among species . sperm head dimensions, size of the apical hook, and head shape are also influenced by high levels of sperm competition  <cit> .

studies on coding sequences of sperm proteins have identified proteins under the influence of sperm competition. the evolutionary rate of coding sequences of two seminal fluid proteins , two sperm surface proteins , and proteins of the acrosome  seem to be positively related to level of sperm competition in primates . other studies found an increase of selective constraint in the presence of sperm competition. this effect was described for seminal fluid proteins in butterflies and sperm nuclear proteins protamine  <dig>  and protamine  <dig>  in rodents .

protamines are small, arginine-rich sperm nuclear proteins. they are crucial for the condensation of sperm chromatin that takes place through successive protein replacements, first of histones by transition nuclear proteins, and then of the latter by protamines  <cit> . prm <dig> is found throughout mammals, whereas prm <dig> is found almost exclusively in primates and rodents. evidence for the existence of prm <dig> gene, transcripts and, in some cases, mature protein is available for a few other mammalian species . prm <dig>  unlike prm <dig>  codes for a precursor, which is processed by successive proteolytic cleavages at the time of sperm differentiation  <cit> . prm <dig> processing occurs while dna condensation is taking place and protamines are bound to dna  <cit> . a mature form of prm <dig>  can be identified after cleavage. the role of the prm <dig> domain that is cleaved off  from the precursor is not clear. cleaved-prm <dig> and mature-prm <dig> are structually and functionally different  <cit> . the sequence of mature-prm <dig> resembles that of prm <dig>  which is consistent with the idea that prm <dig> has evolved as the result of prm <dig> gene duplication  <cit> . both prm <dig> and prm <dig> have dna-anchoring domains containing 3– <dig> arginine residues separated by uncharged amino acids  <cit> . the arginine residues in protamines neutralize the charge of the dna backbone and may also play a role in the activation of egg casein kinase ii after fertilization  <cit> .

because of their important role during sperm chromatin condensation, alterations in protamine expression affect male fertility . in men, changes in sperm protamine content affect sperm head morphology and reduce sperm number and sperm motility  <cit> . aberrant sperm chromatin condensation leads to larger and abnormal sperm heads  <cit> . in mice, an unbalanced protamine content associates with sperm dna damage, sperm morphological abnormalities, and decreases in sperm motility  <cit> . changes in protamine gene sequences and protamine expression ratios are linked to differences in head size and shape in muroid rodents  <cit> .

protamines are thought to evolve fast, showing high structural heterogeneity  <cit> . however, selective constraints are highly variable within the gene sequence and between taxa. evidence of positive selection on the prm <dig> gene sequence has been detected in primates  <cit>  although the general trend for mammals is that the gene sequence is conserved  <cit> . different selective constraints for prm <dig> and prm <dig> have been found in other mammalian species  <cit> . within mammals protamines are thought to be diverse, especially in the c-terminal region, but they contain conserved regions that are also found in birds   <cit> . the high arginine content is thought to be conserved within the sequence, while the position of arginine residues seems to be highly variable  <cit> . a recent study found the high arginine content in prm <dig> to be driven by sexual selection in the form of sperm competition  <cit> . in a group of cricetid rodents, prm <dig> was shown to be under conserved selective constraint, with signs of positive selection restricted to specific codon sites. on the other hand, the two prm <dig> domains were shown to be under relaxed constraint on the way to degradation  <cit> . sperm competition was shown to reduce the relaxation acting on the gene sequence of prm <dig>  resulting in a more conserved state of the gene in species with high levels of sperm competition  <cit> .

in this study we examined the selective pressures potentially acting on prm <dig>  since prm <dig> is mainly expressed in rodents and primates this study concentrated on these clades. in addition, because the prm <dig> precursor actually contains two structurally and functionally different domains  we analyzed them separately to examine the possibility that they may be under different selective pressures. further to a comparison of selective pressures, we examined the possible effects of postcopulatory sexual selection  on the coding sequence. since sexual selection has been shown to affect arginine content in prm <dig> we also tested for effects of postcopulatory sexual selection on arginine content of mature-prm <dig>  we predicted that differences could exist in selective constraints on prm <dig> between primates and rodents. since sexual selection was already shown to affect prm <dig> in cricetid rodents we anticipated signs of sexual selection for all rodents. finally, we predicted that cleaved-prm <dig> and mature-prm <dig> could evolve under different selective regimes.

RESULTS
sequence properties
coding sequences and arginine contents were compared between primates and rodents . cleaved-prm <dig> sequence was significantly longer in primates  whereas mature-prm <dig> was significantly longer in rodents . no significant difference was found in mature-prm <dig> arginine content between primates and rodents .

selective pressures across species
we tested for the general trend of selection acting on prm <dig> domains across all species. mammalian species other than rodents and primates were included to provide a background for comparisons. to obtain the background pressure acting on the whole sequence across all species we calculated the evolutionary rate   for the whole tree on the entire sequence . the evolutionary rate calculated across all species in model m <dig> for cleaved-prm <dig> was ω =  <dig> , and for mature-prm <dig> it was ω =  <dig> .

comparison of selective pressures
to compare selective pressures for the whole sequence and selective pressure on codon sites we used a branch analysis and a branch-site analysis. in each analysis we first marked primates as foreground against the other species as background, and then marked rodents as foreground against the other species as background .

these evolutionary “clade” models , constraining the evolutionary rates of cleaved-prm <dig> in either primates or rodents showed no differences between clades. selective pressures did not differ significantly from the background for the two clades . the calculated evolutionary rate of cleaved-prm <dig> was significantly different from  <dig> for both primates and rodents ; the low evolutionary rate suggests that the domain is under weak purifying selection in both clades.

this same branch analysis on mature-prm <dig> revealed that primates had significantly lower selective constraints than rodents  and that rodents did not evolve with a rate that was significantly different from that of the background  . these results suggest positive selection for mature-prm <dig> in primates. an evolutionary model allowing an excess of non-synonymous mutations was significantly more likely than a completely neutral evolutionary model . for mature-prm <dig> of rodents, neutral evolutionary models were the most likely .table  <dig> summary of results for branch analysis and branch-site analysis of prm <dig> domains of primates and rodents

although the branch tests we performed are adequate for detecting and comparing global evolutionary trends, these models are blind to positive selection or relaxation on specific sites. to address the latter we used the so-called branch-site test .

the branch-site test revealed no directed selection on codon sites for cleaved-prm <dig> in primates , while for rodents one codon site of cleaved-prm <dig> was shown to be positively selected  . for mature-prm <dig>  both primates and rodents showed significantly positively selected codon sites within the alignment  .fig.  <dig> representation of positively selected sites  for a primates, visualized on the prm <dig> amino acid sequence of pan troglodytes  and b rodents, visualized on the prm <dig> amino acid sequence of mus musculus musculus . cleaved-prm <dig> is shown in red. pss as detected by branch-site analysis  are enlarged and boldface. post-translational processing  sites are underlined in cleaved-prm <dig>  <cit> . proposed phosphorylation sites  <cit>  are underlined in mature-prm2

sexual selection
to test for sexual selection on prm <dig> coding sequences in primates and rodents we chose the phylogenetic generalized least squares  regression analysis . the root-to-tip ω, as well as and arginine content , were included as dependent variables against the independent variables body mass and testes mass . in addition, we tested for an effect of evolutionary rate on arginine content.

no significant correlations were found between residual testes mass and root-to-tip ω values of either cleaved- or mature-prm <dig> domains or between residual testes mass and arginine content of mature-prm <dig> in primates or rodents. arginine content was not correlated with mature-prm <dig> root-to-tip ω .table  <dig> phylogenetically-controlled regression analyses

relationships with sperm head dimensions
we tested for possible relationships between changes in the coding sequence of prm <dig> domains and sperm head dimensions. the evolutionary rate was used as independent variable in pgls analyses, with relative head length , relative head width , and head elongation  used as dependent variables. for primates, data available for relative hw were not sufficient for regression analysis. pgls regressions showed no significant correlations with relative hl or head elongation in primates . in rodents, pgls regressions showed a significant positive correlation between cleaved-prm <dig> root-to-tip ω and relative hw, and a significant negative correlation between cleaved-prm <dig> root-to-tip ω and head elongation . no significant correlations were found for mature-prm <dig> fig.  <dig> visualization of significant pgls regression results for a relationship in rodents between cleaved-prm <dig> ω  with sperm head width  and b relationship in rodents between cleaved-prm <dig> ω  with sperm head elongation 



discussion
in this comparative study, focusing on possible selective constraints acting on the prm <dig> gene, we were able to demonstrate significant differences between evolutionary rates of primate and rodent prm <dig> as well as between cleaved- and mature-prm <dig> domains. in primates and rodents, cleaved-prm <dig> is conserved although one site was found to be positively selected in rodents. mature-prm <dig> is under relaxed constraint in rodents and positively selected in primates. additionally, we found directed positive selection on specific codon sites of mature-prm <dig> in both primates and rodents. a previous study concentrating solely on the cricetid family of rodents  <cit>  showed how changes in cleaved-prm <dig> gene sequence associates with sperm head width and elongation. here we present evidence for this relationship to be true across rodents. no signal of sexual selection was found for primates or rodents.

differences in selective constraints between taxa
studies in rodents demonstrated that protamine gene sequences and protamine expression ratios influence sperm head size and shape  <cit> . the gene sequence of prm <dig> seems to be highly variable in mammals although highly conserved regions can also be identified  <cit> . prm <dig> seems to have an unusual form of evolution which seems to be driven by sexual selection  <cit> . this complex pattern of selective constraints and sexual selection could be a consequence of the importance of prm <dig> for sperm form and function resulting in a delicate balance between conservation of function and adaptations to high sperm competition levels. we expected to find an even more complex pattern of evolution in prm <dig> due to the existence of two domains in this protein. we were able to show differences in selective constraints between primates and rodents, especially for mature-prm <dig>  which is positively selected in primates and is under relaxed constraint in rodents. cleaved-prm <dig> is conserved in both clades. this result is important in connection to the proposed functional redundancy of prm <dig> and mature-prm <dig>  mature-prm <dig> is thought to be the result of prm <dig> gene duplication  <cit>  and despite the proposed slight differences in function, mainly associated to the process of dna condensation  <cit> , the function of mature-prm <dig> is essentially redundant to that of prm <dig>  this might be an explanation for the comparative lack of selective constraint of mature-prm <dig>  due to the existence of two protamines, one may be “free” to evolve adaptively or under relaxed constraint while the other is more conserved with a more directed pattern of positive selection on specific codon sites to ensure proper function  <cit>  . when comparing selective constraints between primates and rodents differences in effective population sizes need to be taken into account because population size is generally lower in primates. genetic drift can therefore be an explanation for the higher mature-prm <dig> evolutionary rate in primates  <cit> . the sequence might thus not be truly positively selected but, rather, may be under relaxed constraint with an effect increased by genetic drift. however, the general trend towards a lower selective constraint in mature-prm <dig> is clear.table  <dig> comparison of selective constraints in mature-prm <dig> and prm <dig> of rodents and primates

no sexual selection detected for rodents or primates
we did not find signs of sexual selection acting on prm <dig> domains of primates or rodents. in a previous study, postcopulatory sexual selection was found to halt the relaxation in prm <dig> of cricetid rodents  <cit> . here, the joint analysis of murids and cricetids did not show such relationship.

it has been proposed that the effect of sexual selection on protamines may result in modifications of the shape of the sperm head. high levels of sperm competition could promote changes in the sperm head that would render it more hydrodynamically efficient which, in turn, would influence sperm velocity. so far, it is not clear how changes in sperm head shape affect sperm velocity. given the considerable variation in sperm head shape and size , the diversity in flagellar beating patterns, and the environments present in the female tract in mammals, it is fair to assume that adaptations of sperm head shape would be the result of a complex interplay between these factors  <cit> . wider sperm heads, for example, might be advantageous for certain sperm morphologies whereas narrower heads may be more adpative for other sperm morphs. the effects of sexual selection may therefore be variable, and even contradictory, between different groups of species. evidence for a complex pattern of selective pressures has been shown for adam proteins. in these sperm proteins positive selection within the adhesion domain has been attributed to adaptations to sperm competition and fertilization environment in primates, while in mouse species positive selection could not be explained by sexual selection  <cit> . a study comparing groups of species at deeper taxonomic levels, and including more species, might shed more light on the role of sperm competition on prm <dig> evolution.

like prm <dig>  mature-prm <dig> is very rich in arginine. the dna-anchoring domains contain 3– <dig> arginine residues separated by uncharged amino acids  <cit> . arginine neutralizes the charge of the dna backbone and may play a role after fertilization  <cit> . for prm <dig>  sexual selection seems to be targeting especially the arginine coding content of the gene. sperm competition seems to maintain high arginine content of prm <dig> through sequence conservation. species experiencing higher selective pressure through sperm competition show higher arginine content in the prm <dig> amino acid sequence  <cit> . unlike what was observed for prm <dig>  we did not find a relationship between sexual selection and arginine content in mature-prm <dig>  this might be explained by the fact that the arginine content of mature-prm <dig> seems to be stable across primates and rodents, showing very low variability, leading to the conclusion that it is highly conserved.

positive selection on functionally important sites
positively selected codon sites were found in both primates and rodents. in primates this positive selection is entirely concentrated on mature-prm <dig> codon sites. we found  <dig> postively selected sites in primate mature-prm <dig>  interestingly  <dig> of them fall directly on or around proposed phosphorylation sites in the c- and n-terminal regions. protamine phosphorylation is crucial for the dna condensation process but the mechanism by which it affects dna condensation is not known. it has been proposed that the phosphorylation of protamines is required for dna binding while its subsequent dephosphorylation might be important in correct chromatin compaction  <cit> . changes in phosphorylation sites might affect the degree and efficiency of dna condensation. if primate mature-prm <dig> three-dimensional structure and binding mechanism resembles the proposed dna binding model of prm <dig>  <cit> , changes in phosphorylation of the c- and n-terminal regions might affect dna binding mechanism and cross-linking of protamines  <cit> .

in mice we found three positively selected sites, one in the cleaved-prm <dig> sequence and two in the c-terminal part of mature-prm <dig>  unlike the situation in primates, these sites are not concentrated around proposed phosphorylation sites. however, since theses sites are positively selected they are likely to be of functional importance.

it is possible that accelerated evolution of these codon sites is an adaptation to selective pressures due to sperm competition. in order to understand how the rapid evolution of these sites affects protamine function, a comparative study including data on sequence evolution, sperm competition level, protamine phosphorylation and degree of chromatin compaction should be carried out in the future.

cleaved protamine 2
our results show that cleaved-prm <dig> is conserved in rodents and primates, although we found one codon site to be positively selected in rodent cleaved-prm <dig>  in agreement with previous studies, we found that changes in the cleaved-prm <dig> coding sequence associate with wider and more elongated sperm heads in rodents  <cit> . the role of cleaved-prm <dig> is not yet clear but its conservation and the apparent influence it has on sperm head shape speaks for an important function especially in relation to sperm competitiveness. the unprocessed prm <dig> precursor binds to dna and, while bound, is cleaved over a period of several days until only mature-prm <dig> is left bound to dna  <cit> . sperm chromatin condensation was shown to coincide temporally with the start of protamine translation and posttranslational processing  <cit> . therefore, it was proposed that the cleaved-prm <dig> domain may have a more important role during the actual process of chromatin condensation than mature-prm <dig>  <cit> . in order to understand its role in sperm competitiveness and male fertility the function of cleaved-prm <dig> should be studied in more detail.

CONCLUSIONS
as predicted, we found significant differences in selective constraints of the two prm <dig> domains  as well as differences between the two clades studied . mature-prm <dig> is generally relaxed in rodents with directed positive selection on sites and positively selected in primates. mature-prm <dig> exhibits less constraint than its functionally redundant partner prm <dig>  we propose that mature-prm <dig> is free to evolve adaptively, or under less constraint, due to the existence of a more conserved, functional copy with redundant functional properties. positive selection on codon sites is concentrated on primate mature-prm <dig> targeting possible phosphorylation sites and thus possibly affecting protamine function and chromatin condesation.

on the other hand, cleaved-prm <dig> is conserved in both clades with signs of positive selection on codon sites in rodents. we were also able to demonstrate that changes in cleaved-prm <dig> affect sperm head width and elongation across rodents. this domain seems to play an important role in the process of sperm chromatin condensation and sperm head shaping. further studies should focus on the function of this important prm <dig> domain. the fact that sexual selection was not detected in rodents or primates might be the result of differential interactions or trade-offs between sperm traits and its environment. a comparative study including a broader range of species might explain the complex patterns of sexual selection of prm <dig>
