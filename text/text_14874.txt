BACKGROUND
the ability of the nervous system to convey information relies on the ability of its neurons to translate the information they receive into electrical outputs that can be propagated to their target cells. this crucial property takes place in the ais , and is due to the aggregation of voltage-gated sodium  and voltage-gated potassium  channels. depending on the combination and distribution of nav and kv channel isoforms at the ais, neurons are able to generate spikes with different shapes, frequencies and patterns  <cit> . very recently, ais length and distance from the soma have also been shown to modify a neuron's spiking properties and to be modulated by neural activity  <cit> . it is therefore crucial to characterize all these parameters and determine where the myelin sheath begins in order to assess a given neuron's excitability properties and its ability to display the latter ais plasticity mechanisms. yet, only some of these criteria have been addressed, independently and in different neuronal types. in addition, despite the crucial role of the ais as the spike-generating region, the molecular and potential domain organization of the axon immediately following the ais, which might have an important impact on the neuron's spiking properties, has never been studied. if the myelin sheath starts immediately after the ais, thus abutting an ais instead of a node of ranvier, another question arises: how would the axon be organized in this region? since aiss differ from nodes of ranvier in terms of molecular composition  and development , would this first myelin-anchoring region resemble a hemi-node of ranvier: would the ais be, like nodes of ranvier, flanked by a paranode-like and a juxtaparanode-like compartment ?

several studies have identified nav and kv isoforms that can be expressed specifically at the ais:  nav <dig> , nav <dig>  and nav <dig>   <cit> , clustered at the ais by ankyrin g   <cit> , a cytoskeleton-linked scaffolding protein expressed throughout all aiss  <cit> ;  kv <dig>  and kv <dig>   <cit> , as well as kv <dig> /kcnq <dig> and kv <dig> /kcnq <dig>  <cit> .

while ankg also clusters kcnq2/ <dig> at the ais  <cit> , the mechanisms controlling expression of kv <dig> channels at the ais remain unresolved. psd- <dig> was shown to play a role, although it may be compensated for in vivo  <cit> . clustering of kv <dig> channels has been mostly studied in juxtaparanodes, which are separated from nodes of ranvier by paranodes: clustering of kv <dig> channels requires the juxtaparanodal cell adhesion complex consisting of the axonal proteins transient axonal glycoprotein- <dig>  and contactin-associated protein-like  <dig>   <cit> , controlled by glial tag- <dig>  <cit> . the contiguous caspr-expressing paranode is also necessary: it forms a barrier, which excludes kv <dig> channels from paranodes and confines them to juxtaparanodes  <cit> . the cytoskeletal linker protein, protein  <dig> b, which binds both caspr and caspr <dig>  <cit> , might play a key role in stabilizing their expression in paranodes and juxtaparanodes, respectively, thus ensuring the proper compartmentalization of kv <dig> channels. however,  <dig> b has been shown to be necessary in juxtaparanodes only, controlling the distribution of caspr <dig> and thus the expression of kv <dig> channels  <cit> .

somatic motor neurons  constitute a functionally heterogeneous population of neurons that can be subdivided into different functional subgroups, the most prominent division being between α and γ mns  <cit> . despite this functional heterogeneity, the above-mentioned ais determinants of excitability properties have hardly been investigated  <cit> .

we have analyzed the ais of somatic mns and identified heterogeneous as well as homogeneous determinants of ais spiking properties. we also provide, to our knowledge, the first molecular characterization of the axonal region directly following the ais. we identified a paranode-like compartment and a juxtaparanode-like compartment, which support the beginning of the myelin sheath immediately after the ais, and that, given the differences between nodes of ranvier and aiss, we refer to as a 'para-ais' and a 'juxtapara-ais'. we also demonstrate that kv <dig> channels appear at the ais, para-ais, and juxtapara-ais concomitantly with myelination, and are progressively excluded from the para-ais. we found that expression of kv <dig> channels in the ais and jxp-ais is independent from tag-1/caspr <dig>  in contrast to juxtaparanodes, and from psd- <dig>  finally, we demonstrate that protein  <dig> b is necessary to form the caspr-expressing para-ais barrier and to ensure the proper compartmentalization of kv <dig> channels as well as the segregation of the ais, para-ais and juxtapara-ais.

RESULTS
ais localization and length in motor neurons
we first analyzed the localization of the ais in somatic mns. for this we used an anti-peripherin antibody, which in the spinal ventral horn specifically labels somatic mns  <cit> . we used this antibody throughout our study instead of the more common mn marker, the anti-choline acetyltransferase  antibody  <cit> , not compatible with the low tissue fixation conditions . we verified that all anti-chat labeled somatic mns were also labeled by the anti-peripherin antibody . aiss were labeled with an antibody against ankg. in the majority of mns analyzed throughout the ventral horn of the lumbar spinal cord, the ais was located on a neurite originating directly from the soma , while other mns had their ais located on a secondary branch . we used a somatodendritic marker, an antibody against microtubule-associated protein  <dig> , to show that this secondary branch emanated from a dendrite . interestingly, even for aiss located on a branch that emanates directly from the soma , map <dig> was expressed in their proximal portion, between the soma and the ankg-labeled ais, showing that the axon hillock has a somatodendritic identity. map <dig> staining progressively faded away at some distance within the ais , which reflects the barrier formed by the ais between the somatodendritic and axonal compartments  <cit> .

we analyzed whether this first heterogeneity regarding ais origin correlated with different functional populations of mns. we thus analyzed the distribution of these aiss in the two major types of mns: α and γ. interestingly, we found that α mns  are divided into two subpopulations: 15% of them had a dendrite-derived ais, while the remaining 85% had a soma-derived ais . as for γ mns , all of them had their ais originating directly from the soma .

we next measured the length of the ais and its distance from the soma. we found that overall mn aiss had a very uniform length , which does not show statistically significant differences when comparing  dendrite-derived  and soma-derived aiss  or when comparing soma-derived aiss from α  and γ mns . the distance between the soma and the ais showed a greater variability in particular for dendrite-derived aiss, whose distance from the soma was nonetheless longer in average  than soma-derived aiss .

nav channel distribution in mn aiss
in order to characterize the mn ais excitability properties, we analyzed the ais composition in terms of ion channels, and started with nav channels. we investigated the expression of nav <dig> channels in the ankg+ ais of peripherin+ motor axons. we did not find any ais expression of nav <dig>  in mns . we found that  <dig> % of mns  expressed both nav <dig>  and nav <dig>  in a rather complementary fashion, with nav <dig>  expressed in the proximal part of the ais, close to the soma, and nav <dig>  found more strongly expressed towards the distal ais . analysis of nav <dig>  and nav <dig>  immunofluorescence intensity profiles along the ais, as compared to that of ankg, confirmed these two complementary distributions: intensity of nav <dig>  decreased when that of nav <dig>  increased . in the remaining  <dig> % of mns, nav <dig>  was not expressed at the ais and nav <dig>  was expressed along the entire ais , with an immunofluorescence intensity profile displaying a slightly lower level in the proximal ais .

we analyzed whether this new heterogeneity of aiss correlated with different functional types of mns  or with the first subdivision we observed into soma-derived or dendrite-derived mn aiss. we found that soma-derived aiss from α and γ mns both display the two types of nav composition in the same proportion : about 80% of them express nav <dig>  and nav <dig> , while about 20% of them express only nav <dig> . as for dendrite-derived aiss , 100% of them express both nav <dig>  and nav <dig>  in two complementary ais subcompartments . heterogeneous aiss in terms of localization and nav channel composition can thus be found within a single neuronal population, and this heterogeneity differs among different functional types of mns.

kv channel distribution in mn aiss
we next analyzed the mn ais composition in terms of kv channels. from this point, we focused our study on α mns , because the following immunostainings were too weak in γ mns to be properly analyzed. we found kcnq <dig> expressed uniformly throughout the ankg+ ais in 100% of α mns : its immunofluorescence intensity profile along the ais closely matched that of ankg . we also found kv <dig> , kv <dig>  as well as kvβ <dig> expressed at the ais of 100% of α mns , but all three, in contrast to kcnq <dig>  were clearly absent from the proximal ais , as depicted by their immunofluorescence profile . the three subunits appeared perfectly colocalized as shown for instance for kv <dig>  and kvβ <dig> , suggesting that heteromultimeric channels formed by the association of kv <dig> , kv <dig>  and kvβ <dig> are present in the ais, as previously shown in juxtaparanodes   <cit> . unlike nav <dig> , which was always found expressed at the proximal ais, even when nav <dig>  was present , kv <dig> , kv <dig>  and kvβ <dig> channels appeared completely absent from the proximal ais, displaying a clear change in their expression level between the proximal and distal ais, as shown by their fluorescence intensity profile . mn aiss can thus be divided into different subcompartments along their proximodistal length, which express various combinations of nav and kv channels.

identification of a 'para-ais'
recent observations that some neurons could change their excitability properties as a mechanism of homeostatic plasticity, by either moving their ais away from the soma  <cit>  or increasing the length of their ais  <cit> , asks the question as to how far the ais could respectively move or extend, or as a corollary where exactly beyond the ais does the axon start being myelinated. given the many similar features shared by aiss and nodes of ranvier , we analyzed whether aiss would, like nodes of ranvier, be immediately followed by a myelinated axon and thus flanked by both a paranode-like and a contiguous jxp-node-like compartment. we therefore first analyzed the expression of the paranode marker, caspr . caspr is known to interact in cis with another paranodal cell-recognition protein, contactin, and their interaction allows the tight attachment of the myelin sheath paranodal loops to the axonal membrane. in 100% of somatic α mns , along their peripherin+ axon, we found caspr expression directly contiguous to the ankg+ ais . this result suggests the presence of a paranode-like compartment immediately after the ais. given the differences between nodes of ranvier and aiss, we refer here to this compartment as the 'para-ais' .

identification of a 'juxtapara-ais'
we then analyzed whether the ais and para-ais were further flanked by a jxp-node-like compartment, which would further support the presence of a hemi-node-type organization at the distal tip of the ais. we analyzed the expression of jxp-node markers, namely kv <dig>  and kv <dig> . in 100% of somatic α mns  we found kv <dig>  and kv <dig>  expressed in a compartment contiguous to the caspr+ para-ais, on the opposite side of the distal ankg+ ais expressing kv <dig>  and kv <dig>  . this result suggests the presence of a jxp-node-like compartment, which we here refer to as a 'juxtapara-ais' . kvβ <dig>  which we had found to be expressed in the distal ais of mns, was also expressed in their jxp-ais . as in the ais, kvβ <dig> was found perfectly colocalized with kv <dig>   and kv <dig>  , suggesting that heteromultimeric channels formed by the association of kv <dig> , kv <dig>  and kvβ <dig> are present in the jxp-ais. of note, their expression levels in the jxp-ais, in particular in its proximal domain adjacent to the para-ais, always appeared higher than in the ais . in addition, the axon displays a significant widening in the jxp-ais as compared to the ais, which contributes to the higher expression level of kv <dig> , kv <dig>  and kvβ <dig> observed in the jxp-ais.

in conclusion, all mns have their ais immediately flanked by a para-ais and a jxp-ais, which together strongly suggest the presence of a hemi-node type organization at the distal ais and therefore the presence of a myelin sheath starting immediately after the ais. however, given the differences between aiss and nodes of ranvier, this hemi-node-type organization may display differences compared to a real hemi-node.

we investigated whether para-aiss and jxp-aiss can also be found in other neuronal types. in the cortex, we found, adjacent to the ais, a caspr+ para-ais and a contiguous kv <dig> + jxp-ais in two neuronal types , one of which being presumably a pyramidal cell . we also found a caspr+ para-ais and a kv <dig> + jxp-ais, adjacent to the ais of purkinje cells, which was surrounded by kv <dig> + basket cell terminals .

developmental expression of kv <dig> channels at the mn ais and jxp-ais
despite their crucial role in modulating the ais spike-generating properties  <cit> , the developmental time course of expression of kv <dig> channels at the ais has to date never been studied. therefore, and as a first step towards investigating the mechanisms that could control the clustering of kv <dig> channels at the ais and jxp-ais, we analyzed their developmental expression pattern in both compartments. we examined expression of kv <dig>  and kv <dig>  subunits in the ventral horn presumptive grey matter of mouse lumbar spinal cords at postnatal day  <dig> , p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> . we found an identical developmental distribution for kv <dig>  and kv <dig>  and thus restrict our following description to kv <dig> .

at p <dig>  we did not find any expression of kv <dig>  in ankg+ aiss of peripherin+ mns  or in their presumptive jxp-aiss . at p <dig>   <dig> % of mns  were still not expressing kv <dig>  in their ais or jxp-ais, while  <dig> % showed a weak expression of kv <dig>  in their ankg+ ais, but did not yet express caspr . at p <dig>  expression of the myelin basic protein  could not yet be detected , which does not exclude the possibility that at this stage oligodendrocytes already start myelinating the axon of mns at their distal ais.

at p <dig>   <dig> % of peripherin+ mns  were expressing kv <dig> . strikingly, at this stage, kv <dig>  was never found expressed in the ais or the presumptive jxp-ais alone, but was always found expressed in both compartments together. moreover, as soon as kv <dig>  could be detected at mn aiss, its distribution appeared restricted to the distal ais , as in adult mn aiss , suggesting that the molecules responsible for segregating kv <dig>  within the ais are already present and active at this early stage. among the mns expressing kv <dig>  at p <dig>   <dig> % expressed kv <dig>  at a low level in both ais and jxp-ais, but did not yet express caspr in their presumptive para-ais; while  <dig> % of mns expressed kv <dig>  at a low to moderate level in both ais and jxp-ais and also expressed caspr at the para-ais . interestingly, at this early stage of kv <dig>  expression in ais and jxp-ais, the distribution of ankg overlapped with that of caspr , suggesting that the ais and para-ais are not yet properly segregated. similarly, the distribution of kv <dig>  was not well restricted to the ais and the jxp-ais and often extended into the para-ais, where it overlapped with caspr distribution , resembling the initial stages of kv <dig>  expression in sciatic nerve jxp-nodes, where kv <dig>  extended into the caspr+ paranodal domain  <cit> . in addition, at p <dig>  mns that express kv <dig>  also display mbp staining along their axon, adjacent to the ais . this demonstrates the presence of a compact myelin sheath, which must be attached to the axon by adjacent paranodal loops  apposed to the adjacent caspr+ presumptive para-ais. this result supports the previous conclusion that the para-ais constitutes the first site of myelin attachment.

at p <dig>  almost all mns  now showed a significant expression level of kv <dig>  at both ais and jxp-ais, but ankg and kv <dig>  were still overlapping with caspr . the remaining  <dig> % of mns expressed kv <dig>  at the ais and jxp-ais without caspr. the segregation of the ais, para-ais and jxp-ais into three mutually exclusive compartments occurred very progressively: at p <dig>  90% of mns  showed well segregated ankg+, caspr+ and kv <dig> + compartments , similarly to kv <dig>  expression in sciatic nerve jxp-nodes, where it does not much extend any further within caspr+ paranodes  <cit> . mbp staining at p <dig> and p <dig> still reveals the presence of the myelin sheath adjacent to ais .

the tag-1/caspr <dig> complex is not required for kv <dig> channels expression at the mn ais and jxp-ais in contrast to mn jxp-nodes
what controls the clustering of kv <dig> channels at the ais and jxp-ais? concerning the ais and jxp-nodes, two different mechanisms have been proposed, respectively.

at the ais, the membrane-associated guanylate kinase  psd- <dig> was shown, using extinction with small hairpin rnas in cultured hippocampal neurons, to control the clustering of kv <dig> channels  <cit> , even though analysis in psd-93-/- mice indicated that the lack of psd- <dig> is compensated for  <cit> . at jxp-nodes, the clustering of kv <dig> channels relies on two processes: it first requires an interaction with the jxp-nodal tag-1/caspr <dig> complex: in the absence of jxp-nodal caspr <dig>  or tag- <dig> , kv <dig> channels failed to accumulate at jxp-nodes in sciatic and optic nerves. second, paranodal axoglial junctions form a barrier that excludes kv <dig> channels and restrict their clustering to jxp-nodes  <cit> .

we first tested whether the tag-1/caspr <dig> complex also controls the clustering of kv <dig> channels at the mn jxp-ais, similarly to jxp-nodes. caspr <dig> is indeed a good candidate since it was distributed in the mn jxp-ais, as well as in the mn ais, exactly like kv <dig> channels: in adult mns its distribution was restricted to the distal ais, overlapping exactly with kv <dig>  distribution, and was found at the jxp-ais with a higher level of expression, similarly to kv <dig>  . in addition, caspr <dig> was also expressed at the mn jxp-ais and ais at the very early stage of kv <dig> channels expression in these compartments . we thus used tag-1-/- mice  <cit> , in which caspr <dig> expression was abolished at the mn jxp-ais, as in jxp-nodes. interestingly, caspr <dig> expression was also missing at the mn ais . surprisingly, in tag-1-/- mice we found a normal distribution of kv <dig>  in 100% of mn jxp-aiss analyzed, similar to wild-type  littermate controls : kv <dig>  at the mn jxp-ais displayed no statistically significant difference of immunofluorescence intensity in tag-1-/- compared to wt mice . this result contrasts with the dramatic decrease in kv <dig> channels expression found at jxp-nodes in sciatic nerves  <cit> , which include both motor and sensory axons. in order to test whether this discrepancy could be due to motor axons being less vulnerable to the lack of tag- <dig> and caspr <dig> than sensory axons, we analyzed more specifically teased fibers from spinal cord ventral roots contributing to the sciatic nerve, which contain jxp-nodes exclusively from mns. in tag-1-/- mice, kv <dig>  expression was dramatically decreased in  <dig> % of these mns' jxp-nodes, as compared to wt mice , like at sciatic nerve jxp-nodes  <cit> . spinal somatic mns thus have a jxp-ais that differs from their peripheral jxp-nodes and from the majority of jxp-nodes studied so far, in that it seems to be able to cluster kv <dig> channels by a tag-1/caspr2-independent mechanism.

with regard to the clustering of kv <dig> channels at the mn ais, expression of kv <dig>  in tag-1-/- mice displayed no statistically significant difference of immunofluorescence intensity compared to wt littermates , as was shown at the ais of hippocampal and cortical neurons  <cit> . thus, in contrast to jxp-nodes, the clustering of kv <dig> channels at aiss, as at jxp-aiss, does not seem to require the tag-1/caspr <dig> complex in mns.

psd- <dig> is not required for kv <dig> channels expression at the mn ais and jxp-ais
we then tested the second candidate, psd- <dig>  suspected to control or contribute to the clustering of kv <dig> channels at the ais  <cit>  but not at jxp-nodes  <cit> . in line with the idea of psd- <dig> playing a role in the clustering of kv <dig> channels at the ais, we found psd- <dig> being restricted to the distal part of adult mn aiss, overlapping exactly with kv <dig>  distribution . psd- <dig> was also expressed at the mn ais at the early stage of kv <dig> channels expression at the ais . we thus analyzed psd-93-null mice  <cit> , in which we found a normal distribution of kv <dig>  in 100% of mn aiss, similar to wt littermate controls : kv <dig>  at the mn distal ais in psd-93-/- mice displayed no statistically significant difference of immunofluorescence intensity compared to wt mice . this result indicates that the clustering of kv <dig> channels at the mn ais does not require psd- <dig> 

of note, we found psd- <dig> being also expressed in the jxp-ais, again matching exactly with kv <dig>  distribution . in contrast to ventral roots contributing to the sciatic nerve, where psd- <dig> was expressed in a minority of mn peripheral jxp-nodes , we found psd- <dig> expression in 100% of mn jxp-aiss , suggesting again that spinal somatic mns have a jxp-ais that differs from their peripheral jxp-nodes. this is further illustrated by the fact that the tag-1/caspr <dig> complex did not appear to control psd- <dig> distribution in jxp-aiss , in contrast to sciatic nerve jxp-nodes  <cit>  or more specifically to mn peripheral jxp-nodes : psd- <dig> expression was normal in all mn jxp-aiss analyzed in tag-1-/- mice . however, despite these differences between mn jxp-aiss and peripheral jxp-nodes, in both compartments psd- <dig> did not appear to control the clustering of kv <dig> channels. as in sciatic nerve jxp-nodes  <cit>  and more specifically in mn peripheral jxp-nodes from teased ventral roots , kv <dig>  distribution at mn jxp-aiss was not changed in psd-93-/- mice as compared to wt littermate controls . kv <dig>  at the mn jxp-ais in psd-93-/- mice displayed no statistically significant difference of immunofluorescence intensity compared to wt mice . thus, the clustering of kv <dig> channels in mn jxp-aiss, as in mn aiss, did not require psd- <dig> 

protein  <dig> b is required to maintain a barrier at the mn para-ais, necessary to cluster kv <dig> channels and delimit the ais, para-ais and jxp-ais
finally, we tested the role of protein  <dig> b in controlling both the hemi-node-like organization at the distal tip of the mn ais and the clustering of kv <dig> channels.  <dig>  proteins are cytoskeletal proteins that play a key role in organizing membrane domains: they stabilize the membrane expression of a wide range of proteins by linking them to the actin/spectrin cytoskeleton  <cit> . of the four members of the protein  <dig>  family, protein  <dig> b is expressed in myelinated axons at paranodes and jxp-nodes, where it binds caspr and caspr <dig>  respectively  <cit> . protein  <dig> b has been shown to be necessary in jxp-nodes, for caspr <dig> and thus kv <dig> channels expression  <cit> .

we found protein  <dig> b expression in mn axons, starting immediately after the ankg+/kv1+ distal ais, and covering the para-ais, the kv1+ jxp-ais, and extending beyond, within the internode . protein  <dig> b could thus play an important role in stabilizing the molecular organization of the para-ais and jxp-ais. we therefore analyzed  <dig> b-null mice. we found that caspr distribution was dramatically altered at the para-ais of  <dig> b-/- mice: it was not confined to a well delimited compartment between the ais and the jxp-ais, as in wt mice ; instead, it was extended along the axon, occupying either a single long caspr+ segment  or dispersed caspr+ aggregates , suggesting that the para-ais was disrupted. in addition, kv <dig>  and ankg distributions were not segregated from the caspr+ domain, as in wt mice ; instead ankg  overlapped along varying distances with caspr distribution  and kv <dig>  distribution was continuous from the distal ais to the jxp-ais, covering completely the caspr+ area . analysis of ankg, caspr and kv <dig>  immunofluorescence intensity profiles from wt and  <dig> b-/- aiss, aligned at the end of their ankg staining, confirmed these observations . these results suggest that protein  <dig> b is required to maintain a normal distribution of caspr and thereby an efficient barrier at the mn para-ais: when disturbed, kv <dig> channels invade the mn para-ais. in order to analyze whether the overlap between caspr and ankg in  <dig> b-/- mice corresponds to ankg invading the para-ais, or to caspr invading the ais, we analyzed the length of ankg, and the position of caspr relative to the beginning of the ais . the changes observed for the mean ais length and the mean beginning of caspr between wt and  <dig> b-/- mice was not statistically significant . we can therefore only conclude that in  <dig> b-/- mice ankg and caspr do not segregate properly from one another.

at the mn jxp-ais, kv <dig>  expression was diminished in  <dig> b-/- mice; its expression level in the jxp-ais was not any higher than in the distal ais, as in wt mice ; instead, in most cases it became even lower . psd- <dig> and caspr <dig> were found to display the same distribution as kv <dig> : in contrast to wt mice , psd- <dig> and caspr <dig> expression in  <dig> b-/- mice also invaded the mn para-ais and displayed a continuous distribution from the distal ais to the jxp-ais .

discussion
heterogeneous aiss within the single neuronal population of mns
the spiking properties of a neuron depend on its ais ion channel composition, length and distance from the soma  <cit> . we have shown that within a single neuronal population, the somatic lumbar mns, aiss can be heterogeneous both in terms of ion channel composition and localization, suggesting that the ais may contribute to defining different functional cell types within a single neuronal population.

we indeed found that, in contrast to γ mns which all have a soma-derived ais, α mns have either a soma-derived or a dendrite-derived ais . to our knowledge such dendrite-derived axons in mns have only been alluded to previously  <cit> , but never described and quantified. the dendritic origin of the axon, reported in several neuronal types, may have a functional impact on the neuron's integrative properties. the axon-bearing dendrite, not separated from the ais by the soma, is privileged in its ability to influence action potential initiation and synapses impinging on its proximal part, between the soma and the ais, may act as gating synapses regulating how inputs from the soma and other dendrites might influence the ais  <cit> . we also found that the distance from the soma to the ais differs among mns, and is longer in average for dendrite-derived aiss, which are thus more isolated from somatodendritic synaptic inputs and, as a consequence, might be less excitable  <cit> .

finally, aiss of mns also differ with respect to their nav channel composition, expressing either nav <dig>  only, or both nav <dig>  and nav <dig>  . nav <dig>  may fulfill a similar role as nav <dig>  in layer  <dig> pyramidal neurons: due to their lower activation threshold, distal ais nav <dig>  channels initiate action potentials, while higher threshold proximal ais nav <dig>  channels ensure their backpropagation towards the soma  <cit> . this scenario was based on a comparison between nav <dig>  and nav <dig>  activation thresholds in neurons  <cit> . such a comparison between nav <dig>  and nav <dig>  would help supporting a similar scenario for mns. the higher impedance mismatch, that action potentials backpropagating from dendrite-derived aiss might have to overcome due to the larger proximal dendritic compartment, could explain why such aiss in mns always express nav <dig>  in their proximal part.

these heterogeneous aiss, in terms of localization and nav channel composition, may thus confer different excitability properties and contribute to define subsets of mns with different firing properties  <cit> . since intracellular recordings of adult mouse spinal mns can now be performed  <cit> , it will be possible to analyze the functional impact of these variable ais parameters.

of note, we found some ais parameters that were instead constant across mns, and may provide mns with a common set of firing properties. this is the case for kv channels distribution, even though regulatory mechanisms  could bring about differences between mns. first, expression of slow subthreshold m-type k+ current-mediating kcnq <dig> channels  <cit> , along the entire ais of all α mns , might serve to control both the resting membrane potential and the action potential threshold, as they do in ca <dig> hippocampal pyramidal neurons  <cit> . second, shaker-like kv <dig>  and kv <dig>  channels as well as the auxiliary kvβ <dig> subunit were found to be colocalized at the distal ais in all α mns , suggesting that they coassemble into heteromultimeric channels, as in juxtaparanodes  <cit> . these ais kv <dig> channels may function in mns, as in layer  <dig> pyramidal neurons, to regulate the duration of action potentials  <cit>  or, as in neocortical fast-spiking γ-aminobutyric ergic interneurons, to control the action potential threshold and thus the firing rate  <cit> . finally, ais length was also rather constant among mns, yet slightly different from other neuronal types , suggesting that mechanisms must exist to regulate ais length in a neuronal type-dependent manner.

identification of a para-ais and a juxtapara-ais
we chose to use here the terms 'para-ais' and 'jxp-ais'  for several reasons: these compartments abut an ais, which displays important differences compared to a node of ranvier; in addition these differences may well cause the para-ais and jxp-ais to differ from paranodes and jxp-nodes. despite similarities, aiss and nodes indeed differ in terms of molecular composition  are expressed in aiss only), which implies different clustering/stabilizing mechanism. in addition, in contrast to nodes, aiss develop long before myelination. thus, the mechanisms that cluster axonal proteins at the para-ais and jxp-ais upon myelination, at the distal tip of the preorganized ais, might well differ from those operating at paranodes and jxp-nodes. our results with tag-1-/- mice may illustrate such a difference.

the site where the axon starts being myelinated is still an open question for many neuronal populations, including mouse mns: some chicken spinal mns have a myelin sheath starting immediately after the ais  <cit> , while cat visceral preganglionic mns have a myelin sheath starting several hundred microns after the ais  <cit> . our findings show that the axon of mouse somatic α mns starts being myelinated immediately after the ais and displays a hemi-node-type organization contiguous to the ais, with a para-ais and a jxp-ais. the presence of the myelin sheath immediately after the ais will allow action potentials to start their high velocity propagation along the axon and synchronously along its collaterals right from their site of initiation. in addition, it might change the ability of the ais to increase either its length or its distance from the soma as a way for the neuron to adapt its excitability in response to changes in neuronal activity  <cit> . if mns are able to display such homeostatic plasticity mechanisms, these might take place more easily during a critical period or during developmental stages preceding myelination, when mns might need to adjust their intrinsic excitability to their changing synaptic inputs. finally, given the presence of the myelin sheath immediately after the ais , it is conceivable that demyelinating conditions may affect ais spiking properties.

mechanisms that control kv <dig> channel distribution in the ais and jxp-ais
the homogeneous distribution of kcnq <dig> channels along the entire ais, matching that of ankg, reflects their ankg-dependent clustering  <cit> . the mechanisms that segregate nav channels in the ais proximal  or distal  subcompartment, in addition to their ankg-mediated membrane clustering, are currently unknown. nav auxiliary β subunits , which regulate nav channel cell surface expression, interact with cell adhesion molecules and components of the extracellular matrix  <cit> , could be potential candidates.

as for kv <dig> , kv <dig>  and kvβ <dig>  what controls their restricted expression in the distal ais and in the newly characterized jxp-ais? in tag-1-/- mice, their normal expression in both compartments indicates that tag-1/caspr2-independent mechanisms can control the distribution of kv <dig> channels in the ais and jxp-ais, in contrast to the commonly accepted mechanism operating in jxp-nodes. is this difference due to the presence of psd- <dig> in all aiss and jxp-aiss , and the fact that in both compartments psd- <dig> distribution is not controlled by tag-1/caspr <dig> either ?

psd- <dig> was indeed shown, with shrnas, to control kv <dig> channels in the ais of cultured hippocampal neurons  <cit> . however, kv <dig> channels distribution was normal in the ais of psd-93-/- mice  <cit> . the normal distribution of kv <dig> channels found also in the ais and jxp-ais of psd-93-/- mice leaves open the possibility that psd- <dig> plays a role in vivo: its absence in ko mice may lead to compensatory mechanisms  <cit> , possibly mediated by other maguks.

these results together with those from tag-1-/- mice support the existence of multifactorial mechanisms that can compensate for the absence of either psd- <dig> or tag-1/caspr <dig> in the ais and jxp-ais , but also in some jxp-nodes, where kv <dig> channels expression was normal in caspr2-/- mice  <cit> . in caspr2-/- and tag-1-/- mice, the normal distribution of protein  <dig> b respectively in jxp-nodes  <cit>  and jxp-aiss  could stabilize the expression of scaffolding proteins containing a pdz domain and a protein  <dig> -binding motif. such scaffolds could allow pdz-mediated recruitment of kv <dig> channels. mpp <dig> and mpp <dig>  members of the membrane palmitoylated protein  family of maguks  <cit> , which can also bind caspr <dig>  <cit> , could play such a role and compensate for the absence of tag-1/caspr <dig> or psd- <dig>  nectin-like proteins , which can bind pdz-containing proteins  and  <dig>  proteins  <cit>  may also contribute to such compensatory mechanisms. in aiss, other proteins may fulfill a similar role as protein  <dig> b, or other mechanisms might exist to recruit kv <dig> channels.

protein  <dig> b is necessary to maintain a barrier at the para-ais that compartmentalizes kv <dig> channels and delimits the ais, para-ais and jxp-ais
recruitment of kv <dig> channels at the ais appears concomitantly with myelination and the formation of axoglial contacts at the ais distal tip, as revealed by caspr expression. myelination may thus trigger the recruitment of kv <dig> channels at the ais, which may in part serve to adapt spike initiation properties to the new saltatory propagation and concomitant changes in firing properties  <cit> .

clustering of caspr in the presumptive para-ais indicates the formation of a membrane barrier, which progressively excludes kv <dig> channels from this compartment and restricts their distribution to the ais and jxp-ais. the stabilization of the caspr-expressing barrier is thus crucial for controlling the final distribution of kv <dig> channels. protein  <dig> b, by linking caspr to the cytoskeleton in the para-ais, may play such a crucial role : in its absence, caspr and kv <dig> channels distribution recapitulates an early developmental stage , when caspr is not yet properly clustered and does not form a complete barrier able to exclude all  kv <dig> channels from the presumptive para-ais. in  <dig> b-/- mice, some kv <dig> channels are found in the jxp-ais , where they might still be stabilized by  <dig> b-independent mechanisms, as in the ais. these results differ from the normal appearance of caspr+ peripheral paranodes observed in other  <dig> b-/- mice  <cit> , and suggest that the lack of protein  <dig> b in the para-ais is not compensated for by another  <dig>  protein able to maintain a normal caspr distribution .

of note, the protein  <dig> b-mediated consolidation of the caspr-expressing barrier at the para-ais ensures the proper segregation of caspr not only from kv <dig> channels, but also from ankg: in  <dig> b-/- mice, ankg overlaps with caspr . protein  <dig> b thus plays a key role in controlling the hemi-nodal organization at the ais distal tip and ensures the proper delimitation of the three compartments, the ais, para-ais and jxp-ais.

CONCLUSIONS
aiss from α mns are homogeneous in terms of kv <dig> and kv <dig> channels composition but are heterogeneous in terms of axonal versus dendritic origin and nav channel composition . these heterogeneities suggest an important role for the ais in defining subsets of motor neurons with different spiking properties. despite these heterogeneities, all α mns have their ais immediately followed by a caspr+ paranode-type and a caspr2+ and kv <dig> channels+ jxp-node-type compartment , which underlie the beginning of the myelin sheath and which might limit plasticity of ais length or distance from the soma. differences are observed at this first myelin attachment site compared with a hemi-node of ranvier: in particular, kv <dig> channels appear to be clustered in the jxp-ais and ais by tag-1/caspr2-independent mechanisms, while the cytoskeletal linker, protein  <dig> b plays a crucial role in controlling the molecular organization of this region : it is necessary to form the caspr-expressing barrier at the para-ais and to ensure the proper compartmentalization of kv <dig> channels and the segregation of the ais, para-ais and jxp-ais.
