BACKGROUND
a series of complex biological processes take place over time in order to transform a newly fertilized egg into a fully grown organism. at the very beginning of embryonic development, these biological processes are completely controlled by maternally derived materials. maternally deposited messenger rnas  and proteins drive embryo development until the zygote is able to transcribe its own rna. the link between maternal mrnas and the ability of the embryo to develop normally is of high relevance in many fields, including that of aquaculture. for aquaculture species including atlantic cod , there is a necessity to produce viable eggs and embryos to ensure both economic- and welfare aspects. however, variable egg viability is common, especially in marine farmed fish species . also, egg viability in cod varies between batches within one spawning season  <cit> . although a number of studies have identified different factors that may affect egg viability, as well as indicators that could help in determining if an egg batch is of good or bad shape , the complete picture is far from fully understood. during oogeneis transcribed maternal rnas are stored in dormant complexes for translation just before or after fertilization  <cit> . the activation of translation is regulated and starts with polyadenlyation of the stored mrna. a recent paper in zebrafish reports that 30% of maternal transcripts are polyadenylated prior to fertilization while 70% are progressively polyadenylated after fertilization  <cit> . in several vertebrates including xenopus, zebrafish and mouse, elements  in the 3’utr confer translation initiation and mrna stability or degradation  <cit> . these 3’utr elements bind specific proteins and/or protein-complexes which mediate stability, translation and degradation of maternal rnas  <cit> .

as development progresses, maternal transcripts gradually mix with zygotic transcripts and many are degraded, in line with the first events of embryogenesis. this maternal to zygotic transition  is characterized by a gradual degradation of maternal mrnas and proteins, followed by transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome . mzt coincides with cell cycle lengthening and loss of cell synchrony at cell cycle  <dig> in xenopus, termed the midblastula transition   <cit> . in zebrafish the mbt initiates at cycle  <dig>  <cit> , when the embryo contains  <dig> cells  <cit> . in medaka mzt is uncoupled from the midblastula stage, and begins already at the  <dig> cells stage coinciding with the start of asynchronous cell division  <cit> . in contrast, a large proportion of the maternal rna is degraded already at the 2-cell stage in mammals  <cit> , highlighting the marked species-specific differences in the timing of mrna degradation and subsequent zygotic genome activation.

the basic composition of maternal rnas in the oocyte and early embryogenesis has only been assayed in a few teleost species including zebrafish  <cit>  and recently atlantic cod  <cit> . however, these studies looked at the composition of expressed genes using a microarray. olsvik  <cit>  characterized the blastula stage in cod, using a sequenced un-normalized cdna library. this technique has also been applied to study oocytes and early stages of development in mouse, atlantic halibut and zebrafish  <cit> . this type of study helps identifying overall abundance, novel transcripts, and splice variants in the transcriptome in contrast to microarray which only determine expression levels of a predefined subset of genes. aanes  <cit>  and evsikov  <cit>  did assay the 3’utr sequence of the assayed maternal rnas and were able to find regulatory signals conferring stability and function of maternal rnas. therefore the aim of this study was to characterize the composition of maternal rnas in oocytes and early embryos of atlantic cod, by sequencing 3’utrs of rna from unfertilized eggs and embryos of 1- <dig> cell-, blastula- and gastrula stage . in silico studies focus on transcript- and gene abundance, identity, diversity, ontology, stability and complexity in maternal vs. zygotic developmental stages. this work also focuses on two technical difficulties when analyzing this type of data;  the reliability of gene expression profiles obtained from cdna libraries and  the difficulty of using internal reference genes when working with egg and early developmental stages. 

RESULTS
methodological considerations; number of sequences threshold and external spiking
transcriptome sequencing offers the possibility to discover novel expression patterns, high abundance transcripts, sequence motifs and splice variants  <cit> . in addition transcriptome sequencing measures abundance at a wider scale, as this technique does not get oversaturated. however challenges regarding quality do exist, it is for example crucial for the correct annotation to have a high-quality reference genome. another aspect of quality is how reliable the expression patterns discovered in libraries really are. highly expressed genes represent processes that dominate in the given developmental stage, and discovery and measurements of such gene expressions are more likely to be accurate than that of genes that are weakly expressed. singletons  are more likely to represent random sequencing or sequnecing errors than transcripts that are sequenced numerous of times for one gene. likewise, in microarray studies, low number of transcripts causes a large variation in gene expression results  <cit> . this was also confirmed in this study as we revealed that for genes with few sequences  detected in the libraries, the expression profile from oocyte until gastrula could not be reflected in expression profiles measured with quantitative pcr  for the same genes . for genes with a higher number  of sequences, their expression profiles corresponded with the ones measured by qpcr . we therefore suggest for further transcriptomic studies to filter data based on analysis of number of transcripts to obtain reliable expression profiles for downstream analyses. a threshold of  <dig> or more total sequences for each gene was selected to be applied for our dataset, to be able to include only the most reliable data for analysis. threshold  <dig> was chosen because it is in the middle of  <dig> and  <dig>  and using this threshold did not considerably affect number of genes to be excluded for downstream analyses compared to when applying threshold  <dig>  given that only  <dig> est was sequenced for approximately 50% of the genes in our dataset , even a very low cutoff would exclude a high number of genes from the analysis. however some important information may be hidden within genes with low expression, and will therefore be lost by applying an est number threshold. for example, the zebrafish oocyte possesses a considerable richness of maternally expressed genes of which many may be of importance for embryogenesis  <cit> . when the current experiment was carried out the cod genome was not yet sequenced. however, using the current genome  <cit>  together with new sequencing technology could significantly increase number of reads analyzed in this study. for example, aanes recently studied the zebrafish embryonic transcriptome by applying rna sequencing  <cit> , a method which provides a considerably more precise measurement of transcript abundance due to high number of sequence reads  <cit> . if we were to perform this study again with rna sequencing, more sequence reads would be obtained and more genes could be included in the analysis as they would be represented by more than only  <dig> or a few sequenced transcripts. 

also if candidate gene expressions from cdna libraries are to be verified by qpcr, stable reference genes are essential. when it comes to early embryo tissue like in this study, such stable references are difficult to obtain. for example, neither β-actinelongation factor 1- α 18s, actin related protein  nor ubiquitin  showed stable reference gene expression in stages assayed for gene expression [additional file  <dig>   <cit> . for this reason we chose not to use any of the reference genes tested, but instead apply a technique  where external rna ) is added in equal amounts to each rna sample  <cit> . the considerably more stable expression pattern of hba can be seen in [additional file  <dig>  we therefore suggest that external spiking may serve as a good alternative to the traditional reference genes previously applied in qpcr, especially when measuring gene expressions in early embryo tissue.

overall composition of cdna libraries from oocyte, 1- <dig> cell, blastula and gastrula stage in atlantic cod: amount of transcripts and genes, and mitochondrial contribution
in order to get an impression of the approximate timing of mzt  we measured gene expression profiles of candidate genes known from other species to be maternal, zygotic or involved in events taking place at the initiation of mzt [additional file  <dig>  our results together with the findings of drivenes  <cit>  indicate that the mzt takes place between blastula and gastrula in atlantic cod, which is also true for zebrafish  <cit> . together the cdna libraries from oocyte, 1- <dig> cell, blastula and gastrula stage produced  <dig> 3’est sequences, which have been added to genbank;  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> sequences were obtained from oocyte, 1- <dig> cell, blastula and gastrula libraries, respectively.  <dig> sequences  were mapped to the atlantic cod genome  <cit> .  <dig> of these sequences hit cod genes with the rules given in material and methods section; they were predicted to encode  <dig> genes, of which  <dig>  were ensembl-annotated.  <dig> genes were pseudogenes, and were therefore removed from most of the analysis. furthermore as described in methodological considerations, sequences with n ≤  <dig> were removed from most of the analysis, leaving us with  <dig> sequences predicted to be encoded by  <dig> genes. compared to similar analyses  <cit> ,  <dig> genes is a low number; however these studies have included most transcripts in contrast to the current study. as mentioned, we showed no correlation between qpcr and low copy number of ests , and highly expressed genes  are possible to classify as maternal, zygotic, degrading and activating. est copy number filtering was a necessity to be able to study stability and complexity of dominating transcripts in early embryos of cod.

strikingly, the overall composition of abundant transcripts obtained from maternal stages  contained  <dig> - <dig> % mitochondrial transcripts, while at the zygotic stage  only  <dig> % of the transcripts were mitochondrial . less than  <dig> % of all the expressed genes in each developmental stage encoded these numerous mitochondrial transcripts . this trend was also evident by the highly expressed mitochondrial genes of table  <dig>  showing the  <dig> most abundantly expressed genes when all transcripts from all libraries were included. likewise it has been reported a high level of mitochondrial transcripts at the 2-cell stage in halibut  <cit>  and in the oocyte of senegalese sole  <cit> . high level of mitochondrial transcripts in mature oocytes may be linked to high metabolic need to complete synchronous continuous cell-divisions at early developmental stages, whereas at later stages the energy metabolism is more localized to target areas in specific development. it has even been suggested that a major part of maternal rnas in egg-laying organisms lack specificity and only provides supplemental nutrition  <cit> . however a proportion of the maternal rnas are essential for normal development in fish, as several studies report abnormal embryo development when mrna translation is inhibited  <cit> . also several processes in zebrafish morphogenesis, most notably brain formation, fail to occur normally when normal degradation of maternal rna is disturbed  <cit> . 

gene names and their total number of transcripts in oocyte, 1- <dig> cell, blastula and gastrula are shown.

nuclear transcripts and expressed genes: distribution and gene ontologies
to facilitate analysis of expressed genes from the genome, mitochondrial transcripts  were excluded. what remained were the nuclear transcripts . a significant feature of the gastrula nuclear transcriptome was a high presence of ribosomal transcripts  compared to the earlier stages . this increase in transcript abundance was not a consequence from many additional genes being expressed in the gastrula stage, as the number of genes encoding the ribosomal transcripts only increased from  <dig> – <dig> % in the maternal libraries to  <dig> % in the gastrula library . however, some of the ribosomal transcripts were uniquely found in the gastrula library . a similar pattern of ribosomal transcripts has previously been found in zebrafish  <cit>  and halibut  <cit> . the high presence of ribosomal transcripts in gastrula is most likely due to major onset of transcription since ribosomal proteins are required for the production of ribosomes at the site for transcription. 

gene names and their total number of transcripts in oocyte, 1- <dig> cell, blastula and gastrula are shown.

most nuclear genes  were expressed in more than one developmental stage, and  <dig> %  of the genes were expressed in all four stages. the most highly expressed genes  present in all libraries were histone h2a family member v followed by tetraspanin  <dig>  which are involved in general processes like structuring of chromosomal fibres and signal transduction in cell development, activation, growth and motility.  <dig> %  of the nuclear genes were expressed exclusively in maternal stages , and represented a diverse group . however among the ones with the highest numbers of transcripts in this category, we found common genes  involved in processes like energy metabolism and cell cycle, which are features that characterize early embryonic development. other studies  <cit>  report on a higher number of strictly maternal genes than  <dig>  however as mentioned many genes were excluded in this study due to their low number of sequenced ests. since the cutoff of n =  <dig> may have excluded many lower expressed but important maternal genes from downstream analysis all sequenced genes were added to genbank, leaving them available for future studies of for example egg viability. 

gene names and their total number of transcripts in oocyte, 1- <dig> cell, blastula and gastrula are shown.

we also checked how the nuclear transcripts were distributed when including all nuclear genes  without any threshold for number of transcripts. in this dataset a large proportion  of the genes had only  <dig> transcript. consequently, the genes expressed exclusively in maternal and gastrula stages showed an increase in their proportions . the proportion of genes expressed in all developmental stages decreased markedly from  <dig>  to  <dig> % . it is therefore clear that the use of a threshold for number of transcripts makes a difference for describing gene expression patterns.

functional profiles of the most common nuclear transcripts in oocyte, 1- <dig> cell, blastula and gastrula -terms) revealed that both within cellular component, molecular function and biological process many of the transcripts did not change much in their abundance over time . however some differences could be observed between maternal and zygotic stages [additional file  <dig>  an increase in proportion of transcripts that were part of macromolecular complexes from maternal to zygotic developmental stage possibly reflects specification of cell types which requires more complex molecules as the embryo enters the zygotic stage. at the molecular function level, a pronounced increase of transcript amount from maternal to zygotic stage was evident for structural molecule activity, reflecting a shift towards specification of cell function. several biological processes including cellular component organization or biogenesis, multicellular organismal process and developmental process showed a marked shift between maternal and zygotic stage, with increase in transcript proportion in gastrula. taken together, these changes reflect more specialized and complex processes developing after mzt in cod, as would be expected since gastrula is a developmental stage where intricate processes like germ layer formation takes place .

3’utr structure: isoforms, length and motifs
based on manual annotation, 3’utr length was predicted for all sequences with stop codon and poly-a tail . to be able to study the gene expression dynamics over time from a maternal to a zygotic embryo, genes  were strictly classified as having degrading, stable or activating transcripts. in order to be termed degrading, minimum 95% of the transcripts had to be located in maternal stages . in order to be termed activating, minimum 95% of the transcripts had to be present in blastula and gastrula. transcripts present in all  <dig> stages, with a distribution of minimum 10% and maximum 40% in one stage were termed stable. applying this classification gave  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes with degrading, stable and activating expression profiles, respectively.  <dig> genes could not be classified according to these specifications. to ensure reliable results, the following analyses on 3’utr structure were also performed when applying less strict specifications .

totally  <dig> nuclear genes  expressed more than one 3’utr isoform. among genes with degrading and stable transcripts a relatively high amount  displayed 3’utr isoforms . alternatively spliced transcripts are common in early embryos in other species, for example in zebrafish where it has been shown 50–60% alternative splicing of transcripts  <cit> . also in mouse embryos a significant proportion of alternatively spliced transcripts have been found  <cit> , and in this context it was suggested that alternative splicing is of importance in the regulation of development. activating genes of cod had a far less degree of 3’utr isoforms . this may be an indication that alternative splicing is a less important regulatory mechanism for genes that are more active in early zygotic stages, than for genes that are more active in maternal stages. 

mean 3’utr length  in degrading , stable  and activating  transcripts was  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> bp, respectively . activating transcripts had significantly  shorter 3’utr length than degrading and stable ones. a higher proportion of long maternal 3’utrs have previously been found across the animal kingdom  <cit>  associated with lower turnover-rate of rnas  <cit> . our findings suggest that also in cod, transcripts from maternally active genes have longer 3’ utrs. the shorter 3’ utrs of the activating transcripts may also be explained by the fact that many of them were ribosomal ; such transcripts have been shown to contain short 3’utrs  <cit> . excluding ribosomal genes would lead to a small dataset. consequently, we applied less strict classification criteria for degrading, stable and activating transcripts and found that also non-ribosomal activating transcripts have significantly shorter 3’utrs [additional file  <dig>  

although not statistically proved in this study, stable transcripts appeared to have the longest 3’utrs . this corresponds to the suggestion that more stable rnas have longer utrs  <cit> . a strong exponential correlation has been found between 3’utr length and morphological complexity   <cit> . increased regulatory complexity in long 3’utrs may be a result of more mirna binding sites. furthermore, additional polyadenylation signals may produce transcript isoforms with several combinations of mirna binding sites, which adds even more complexity  <cit> . it was observed an enrichment of 3’utr isoforms in degrading and stable transcripts  compared to activating ones . this result suggests a more complex post-transcriptional regulation in the maternal stages since transcriptional regulation cannot be applied to control developmental processes prior to mzt.

the apparent complex features of transcripts that were abundant in early developmental stages of cod were further investigated by searching for motifs in the 3’utrs of degrading, stable and activating transcripts. using multiple em for motif elicitation   <cit>  the presence of the polyadenylation motif aataaa was indicated. manual inspection of the sequences revealed that aataaa  was present at an increasing manner from degrading , through stable  and to activating  transcripts . aataaa is essential for cytoplasmic polyadenylation to take place  <cit> ; that is, cleavage followed by adding of a poly-a tail to the 3’ end of the mrna which then activates translation. therefore polyadenylation is a key process in regulation of translation , and thus serves as an important step in post-transcriptional regulation in maternal stage embryos. also, it was recently found that cytoplasmic polyadenylation of maternal rnas prior to mbt is essential for normal morphogenesis post-mbt in zebrafish  <cit> . it is known that aataaa is found in nearly all known mrnas, and that it is highly conserved. our finding that  <dig>  and  <dig> % of degrading and stable transcripts  did not contain aataaa may be explained by the possibility of transcripts to contain alternative polyadenylation motifs, where aataaa have been slightly modified . therefore, we investigated the presence of  <dig> other putative alternative polyadenylation motifs  <cit> ; for each sequence we observed which motifs were present, and if there was more than one motif .  <dig> motifs  were found exclusively in degrading and stable transcripts, and agtaaa was present only in stable transcripts. none of the motifs were unique for activating transcripts, and most of the motifs were present at the lowest rate in this group of transcripts . also, degrading and especially stable transcripts had a higher prevalence  of multiple motifs  than activating ones . a higher degree  of putative alternative polyadenylation motifs in maternal degrading and stable transcripts suggests that these transcripts may apply alternative polyadenylation more frequently than activating transcripts. polyadenylation at different sites produces different variants of the 3’utr, which contributes to a more complex transcriptome  <cit> . 

CONCLUSIONS
this study shows that scarce transcripts represent a significant bias in transcriptomic assessments of sequenced libraries, and suggests for future studies to compare number of transcripts and qpcr analysis to set a threshold for the transcript abundance that reflects reliable expression profiles. this study also shows a solution for dealing with the problem of internal variation in housekeeping genes when analyzing relative expression over time in fish embryos. by adding an external normalization gene the problem with housekeeping gene variation was avoided  <cit> .

in maternal stages , mitochondrial genes encoded  <dig> – <dig> % of the transcripts, reflecting a high energy demand in embryos up until mzt. the zygotic nuclear transcriptome had a high presence of ribosomal transcripts , reflecting a major onset of transcription at this stage. gene ontology terms reflect a more complex and specialized gastrula compared to maternal developmental stages. degrading and stable transcripts have longer 3’utrs than the ones that increased in abundance after mzt. furthermore, this group of transcripts has more  of the alternative polyadenylation motifs studied, as well as a higher number of 3’utr isoforms. together this indicates a more complex post-transcriptional regulation for genes that are highly active in maternal stages compared to that of genes that are more active in the zygotic embryo of cod.

in summary, this study describes in detail and for the first time, the overall level and composition of common maternal rnas in the mature cod egg and early stages of embryogenesis, and reveals a picture of the fluctuations in the high abundance transcripts from egg to maternal stages and onwards to onset of zygotic transcription. this characterization of the maternal transcriptome in atlantic cod  will be helpful in further studies with the aim to elucidate the relationship between maternal rnas and offspring viability in this species.
