BACKGROUND
bacteria of the order rickettsiales are obligate intracellular parasites of eukaryotes. while some symbionts are known , most described species of rickettsiales are best known as human pathogens that cause several diseases, including rickettsioses, anaplasmosis, and ehrichiosis  <cit> . historically, rickettsial agents have been important causes of human morbidity and mortality, including r. prowazekii that caused several million deaths in the ussr  <cit> , and it is estimated that orientia tsutsugamushi is currently responsible for approximately one million cases of scrub typhus per year  <cit> , <cit> . the discovery of new pathogenic species or their associated diseases has attracted attention to the rickettsiales as pathogens  <cit> - <cit> . as their arthropod vectors often live at high densities and in close proximity to domestic animals and humans, rickettsiales will continue to pose a risk for transmission to humans. hence, the identification and characterization of novel rickettsiales is of importance for both animal and human health.

the number of novel rickettsiales associated with protists, arthropods, and mammals has increased rapidly through the application of molecular detection and phylogenetics  <cit> - <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . remarkably, analysis of the trichoplax adhaerens genome also reveals novel species in the order rickettsiales . at present, this order contains three established families  and one proposed family   <cit> , <cit> - <cit> . additionally, some unclassified species warrant further attention to determine their phylogenetic and systematic positions  <cit> , <cit> . the intra- and inter-species genetic diversity and evolutionary relationships within genera of rickettsiales bacteria have been characterized using 16s rrna gene  sequences, especially in the case of those bacteria causing animal and human disease  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . however, relatively little is known about their potential for cross-species transmission and emergence.

compared with other zoonotic or vector-borne bacteria, rickettsiales are associated with a more extremely diverse host range, including protists, hydra, annelids, arthropods, vertebrates, and even plants  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . while some rickettsiales are specific to particular vectors and hosts  <cit> , <cit> , others experience host-switching or regularly cycle between different hosts, typically a mammal  and a blood-feeding arthropod   <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . however, the evolutionary associations between rickettsiales and their hosts are not well understood  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . in particular, it is unclear whether rickettsiales most often evolve by long-term bacteria-host co-divergence or cross-species transmission  <cit> , <cit> . as most emerging infectious diseases in humans are caused by spillover from animal hosts or vectors, a better understanding of the evolutionary relationships among rickettsiales bacteria could provide important information on the likelihood of their emergence as agents of disease.

xinjiang  is located in the northwestern part of china, and borders russia, mongolia, kazakhstan, kyrgyzstan, tajikistan, afghanistan, pakistan and india  and is one of the nation’s major grazing areas. several important tick-borne diseases are endemic in xinjiang  <cit> . the main aim of this study was to explore the diversity of rickettsiales in xinjiang, china, where their presence has only previously been shown by serological data  <cit> , <cit> . accordingly, we screened ticks and identified bacteria by sequencing and analyzing three genes; rrs, citrate synthase , and heat shock protein . with these data in hand we explored key aspects of rickettsiales biodiversity and evolution.

RESULTS
collection of ticks and detection of rickettsiales bacterial dna
in the spring of  <dig>  a total of  <dig> adult ticks were collected from domestic animals  and grasslands in the border areas of the bole and tacheng regions of xinjiang uygur autonomous region, china . the numbers, species, and geographic distributions of the adult ticks collected are shown in table  <dig>  after morphological examination and sequence analysis of mitochondrial 18s and 12s rdna sequences as described previously  <cit> , only dermacentor nuttalli and hyalomma asiaticum were found in xinjiang.
rickettsiales
bacteria from pooled tick samples

a total of  <dig> tick pools  were investigated in this study,  <dig> of which were from bole and  <dig> from tacheng. pcr was performed to detect rickettsiales dna based on rrs. pcr products of the expected size were amplified from  <dig> tick pools from bole and  <dig> from tacheng. genetic analyses of these sequences indicated that all products belonged to rickettisales .

genetic analysis of bacterial dna sequences
the rrs, glta, and groel gene sequences amplified from the rickettsiales dna-positive tick-pool samples were sequenced . genetic analyses indicated that all sequences recovered from ticks from xinjiang shared strong similarities with those from species of anaplasma, ehrlichia, and rickettsia , and hence within the standard reference values used for assignments to these genera   <cit> . hence, these bacterial groups circulate in dermacentor and hyalomma ticks in xinjiang . a pcr based on individual tick samples confirmed the likelihood that in each case the three genes of each identified species from tick pool are from a single bacterial species.

phylogenetic relationships between newly identified and known rickettsiales
to determine the phylogenetic relationships among the rickettsiales bacteria identified here and those described previously, we estimated phylogenetic trees based on the rrs, glta, and groel genes using ml and bayesian methods, all of which produced similar topologies. in agreement with previous studies  <cit> , <cit> , all rickettsiales bacteria including those identified in this study were classified into four well-supported monophyletic groups in the rrs trees , corresponding to the families holosporaceae, rickettsiaceae, candidatus midichloriaceae, and anaplasmataceae. the family rickettsiaceae comprises two genera – orientia and rickettsia – while the family anaplasmataceae contains the genera neorickettsia, wolbachia, ehrlichia, anaplasma, and candidatus genus neoehrlichia. as the glta gene of o. tsutsugamushi strains is a pseudogene, the ml and bayesian trees based on glta gene sequences did not include o. tsutsugamushi, although this did not change the topological positions of the other taxa.

within the genus anaplasma, the bacterial sequences  recovered from d. nuttalli ticks from tacheng were closely related to a. ovis bacteria in dermacentor spp. and rhipicephalus spp.  <cit>  in the rrs, glta, and groel trees . in the rrs and groel trees the bacterial sequences  identified in h. asiaticum ticks from bole and d. nuttalli ticks from tacheng clustered together and showed a close relationship with the species a. bovis, which is predominantly vectored by amblyomma spp., rhipicephalus spp., and hyalomma spp.  <cit> . as a. bovis glta sequences are not available, the sequence  formed a distinct lineage. remarkably, the sequences  recovered from h. asiaticum ticks from bole were divergent from any known anaplasma bacteria . they formed a distinct lineage in all three phylogenetic trees, suggesting the presence of a new anaplasma species in ticks. finally, it was notable that different clustering patterns of anaplasma bacteria were observed in the trees estimated using the groel and glta gene sequences. additional work is needed to determine whether these differences are due to recombination.

evolutionary association between rickettsiales bacteria and their vectors
in agreement with the recent studies  <cit> , <cit> , almost all known species of the family holosporaceae, which are the most divergent group in the order, are associated with protists , except one found in prairie dog flea  <cit> . the most divergent species within the family rickettsiaceae are also predominantly associated with protists , and occupy the most divergent position in the phylogeny of vectors. several exceptions include the uncharacterized species detected from hydra oligactis and the leech torix tagoi. all other rickettsia or rickettsia-like species were found in arthropods, with the majority found in ticks and a few in insects. the unclassified species, potentially a new family, are associated with protists as well as hydra vulgaris <cit> . like the family rickettsiaceae, bacteria from the family candidatus midichloriaceae are associated with a wide range of hosts, from protists to a variety of animals, including ticks  <cit> , <cit> . although the bacteria of the family anaplasmataceae are not found in protists, the earliest appearance is of bacteria in the genus neorickettsia found within trematoda or aquatic insects  <cit> . all known bacteria from the genera anaplasma and ehrlichia are found within ticks.

inferred ancestral habitat for the rickettsiales
interestingly, our phylogenetic analysis of possible ancestral character states on these data gave support to an aquatic origin for the families rickettsiaceae, anaplasmataceae, holosporaceae and candidatus midichloriaceae with strong support values of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. in addition, this analysis suggested that there were at least five independent adaptations to terrestrial animals:  within the family holosporaceae,  within the genus rickettsia,  within the currently known species of orientia circulating in mites,  within the ancestral lineage that diverged into the genera wolbachia, anaplasma, and ehrlichia, and  within the candidatus midichloriaceae, which is associated with a wide range of hosts.

discussion
serological studies provided the earliest evidence for the presence of the bacteria of the genera anaplasma, ehrlichia, and rickettsia in ticks from xinjiang area of china  <cit> , <cit> . since this initial work, only a small number of molecular epidemiological studies have been performed, mostly on rickettsiales and limited to partial sequences of a single gene  <cit> . by sequencing and analyzing the bacterial sequences of complete length rrs, glta, and groel genes, we identified at least nine species of bacteria belonging to the rickettsia, anaplasma and ehrlichia genera of rickettsiales, indicating extensive genetic diversity of rickettsiales in the two primary species of ticks in xinjiang. given that at least  <dig> species of ticks are present in xinjiang  <cit> , it is likely that additional tick-associated rickettsiales circulating in this region will be discovered in the future.

human cases of infection by rickettsiales, leading to lymphadenopathy caused by a spotted fever group  rickettsia, were documented in the 1980s in the bole region of xinjiang  <cit> . serological analyses of the strains isolated from patients and ticks suggested that r. sibirica might be the etiological agent  <cit> , <cit> . in this study, phylogenetic analyses of bacterial sequences recovered from ticks indicated the presence of r. raoultii in bole region and r. slovaca in tacheng, species which were previously found in other regions of xinjiang  <cit> . as r. slovaca is known to be associated with lymphadenopathy and r. raoultii with similar disease  <cit> , <cit> , our results suggest there is potential risk to humans by species of rickettsiales detected in xinjiang, which clearly warrants additional investigation.

currently, the genus ehrlichia contains five species and more than five unclassified genetic variants  <cit> . to date, only one study reports the presence of antibodies against e. chaffeensis in the ruminants from xinjiang  <cit> . in this study, at least four species of ehrlichia were discovered circulating in ticks in xinjiang. although the rrs tree could not provide resolution between newly discovered bacteria and previously characterized ehrlichia species , the genetic separation is more obvious in the glta and groel genes, where the ehrlichia sequences were clearly divided into four lineages. remarkably, the sequences  recovered from ticks from bole were quite distinct from any known ehrlichia spp. thus, our data suggest that there are novel clades of ehrlichia in xinjiang ticks.

the genus anaplasma includes six species  <cit> . through analysis of a short fragment of rrs, a. phagocytophilum in h. asiaticum and sheep were recently found in other parts of xinjiang  <cit> , <cit> . in this study, the bacteria  detected in ticks from tacheng were closely related to a. ovis carried by dermacentor spp. and rhipicephalus spp. ticks in the rrs, glta, and groel trees, with  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % nucleotide similarity, respectively, thereby indicating the presence of a. ovis in ticks from tacheng region. as for anaplasma sp. bl126- <dig> and anaplasma sp. tc250- <dig> recovered in ticks from bole and tacheng, respectively, a closer relationship with a. bovis  was observed in both rrs and groel trees, suggesting that a. bovis circulates in ticks in bole and tacheng regions. finally, the bacterial sequences  recovered from ticks form a lineage distinct from any known anaplasma, suggesting a novel species circulating in ticks in this region.

it is important to note that bacterial endosymbionts are known to be abundant in tick species, although many are considered to be harmless to humans  <cit> . further research is needed to confirm whether the sequences detected in this research are indeed from novel rickettsiales species, and whether these species are endosymbiotic or potentially pathogenic.

an interesting observation of this study is that the phylogenetic analysis of this sample of sequences suggests that rickettsiales may have originated in aquatic environments, with five adaptive shifts from an aquatic to terrestrial habitat. it had previously been suggested that the common ancestor of rickettsiales was free-living, and that the transition to an intracellular lifestyle occurred 525- <dig> million years ago  <cit> . interestingly, the genome of r. bellii includes many genes that are characteristic of amoebal symbionts  <cit> , and it was suggested that the ancestors of rickettsia could have used amoebae  as hosts, from which further adaptation to terrestrial organisms, including ticks, occurred. for bacteria of the family candidatus midichloriaceae, aquatic/environmental protists likely have served as evolutionary reservoirs, from which one or more lineages evolved with the capacity to infect metazoans  <cit> , <cit> . in sum, all these data support the notion that aquatic/environmental protists played an important role in the evolution of the rickettsiales  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , <cit> .

our analyses also revealed that, although there is clearly congruence between the bacteria and vector/host trees, a model of exclusive bacteria-vector co-divergence can be rejected, albeit marginally. hence, the biodiversity of the rickettsiales must also reflect, at least in part, the occurrence of cross-species transmission. host associations encompass free-living extracellular, facultative intracellular, and obligate intracellular  species, with the latter often exhibiting reductive genome evolution  <cit> . all of these lifestyles are accompanied by infecting new host species. it is possible that co-divergence occurred in the early stage of rickettsiales evolution. this is apparent in the phylogeny , in which species sampled from protists formed basal lineages to all rickettsia, and that neorickettsia  formed a basal lineage to wolbachia, anaplasma, and ehrlichia. since some rickettsiales bacteria are endosymbiotic, their vertical transmission style may, to some degree, provide a mechanistic basis to the occurrence of co-divergence. however, it is clear that more data are needed to determine the precise evolutionary association between these bacteria and their vectors.

finally, the diversity of tick-associated rickettsiales is particularly noteworthy because both anaplasma and ehrlichia genera are tick-specific. in addition, the family rickettsia has significant diversity associated with ticks, and some species of the family candidatus midichloriaceae are also found in ticks. for these tick-borne groups, the bacteria could be directly transmitted from aquatic protists to ticks. alternatively, ticks could acquire microbes from other terrestrial organisms through cross-species transmission. nevertheless, distinguishing between these two pathways is beyond the scope of this study and requires data from bacteria characterized from a variety of other organisms.

CONCLUSIONS
our screen for rickettsiales bacteria in two tick species of xinjiang revealed nine species, of which some ehrlichia and anaplasma species were distinct from any known rickettsiales. our phylogenetic analyses indicated that both co-divergence and cross-species transmission were responsible for the current evolutionary diversity of the rickettsiales.
