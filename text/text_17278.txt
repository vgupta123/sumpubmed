BACKGROUND
litchi , a native fruit of china, has a high commercial value in the international market due to its bright color and the presence of rich nutrients in the pulp  <cit> . however, this perishable fruit senesces quickly after harvest, which is reflected in the browning of the pericarp within 1–2 days at ambient temperature  <cit> . fruit senescence is controlled by multiple internal and environmental factors, each of which upregulates a subset of senescence-associated genes , which are sequentially involved in perception, signal transduction pathways, and downstream responses; all of these genes are subject to complex regulatory crosstalk  <cit> . it has been reported that cellular energy status plays a vital role in regulating litchi fruit senescence and browning  <cit> . as an energy regulator, snf1-related kinase  <dig>  has been reported to be involved in the global regulation of carbon and nitrogen metabolism, further affecting the cellular energy level  <cit> . moreover, pathogen infection usually induces fruit senescence and browning. plants have their own mechanism to defend against pathogen attack, among which the accumulation of callose is important  <cit> . transcription factors  usually regulate a wide range of biological processes, including senescence  <cit> . for example, mybs play an important role in fruit senescence  <cit> ; in particular, they have been reported to be widely involved in the regulation of anthocyanin metabolism , which is an important factor affecting pericarp browning  <cit> .

micrornas  are endogenous noncoding small rnas that have been found in plants, animals, and even viruses . they play important roles in plant development through the regulation of gene expression by mrna degradation or translational inhibition  <cit> . in plants, cleavage occurs in the middle of the mrna–mirna duplex   <cit> . as a result, the 3′ fragment of the target mrna has a monophosphate at its 5′ end, which is an important factor that validates a mirna target  <cit> . in recent years, with the rapid development of high throughput sequencing, many mirnas and their target genes have been identified from diverse plant species  <cit> . the discovery of these mirnas and their targets makes it possible to further understand the gene regulation network and biological mechanism mediated by mirnas. however, little is known about mirnas in litchi.

previous studies have demonstrated that mirnas can mediate plant senescence. for example, mir <dig> has been found to regulate the nac transcription factor ore <dig>  and senescence is accelerated in the mir <dig> mutant  <cit> . in another case, mir <dig> triggers the production of trans-acting sirna from tas <dig>  leading to mrna degradation of the auxin response factors arf2/3/ <dig> and ultimately affecting the timing of senescence  <cit> . additionally, the overexpression of mir <dig> targeting tcp transcription factors has been reported to result in a stay-green phenotype  <cit> . with regard to fruit, only a few mirnas  have been verified to fine-tune the expression of cnr and ap2a, which are important regulators in tomato fruit ripening  <cit> . however, little is known about mirna expression and its targets in stored fruit senescence in general. thus, our study has a broader appeal to stored fruits other than litchi alone.

to understand the regulation of mirnas on the senescence of harvested litchi fruit, five small rna libraries of litchi fruit after storage under different temperatures and a mixed degradome library were sequenced. mirnas and their targets were identified using a litchi unigene reference assembled from transcriptome sequencing. a number of mirnas were then validated by stem-loop real-time quantitative rt-pcr, and a possible mirna-target regulatory network in litchi browning and senescence was proposed. our study provides basic information for further understanding of the mirna-mediated senescence in harvested litchi fruit and offers a new theoretical strategy to postpone the senescence of harvested horticultural products.

RESULTS
analysis of small rna library datasets from litchi fruit
a total of approximately  <dig> million reliable reads were obtained from high-throughput sequencing of  <dig> d-,  <dig> d-,  <dig> d 0 h-,  <dig> d 24 h-, and  <dig> d 48 h-derived srna libraries from litchi pericarp . all of the reads were first processed by removing the 3′ adaptor sequence, and reads with low complexity and those homologous to t/rrnas were excluded. approximately 10 % of the reads aligned to the litchi unigene assembly with up to one mismatch , and reads of 20 ~  <dig> nucleotides were used for further analyses. the length distribution of the srna from five libraries showed an uneven pattern. in general, the majority of the small rnas were distributed from  <dig> to 24-nt in size, and the most abundant was 24-nt, followed by 22-nt and 23-nt . one possible cause of the observed changes in the predominance of different groups of mature srnas could be the differential activity of the various srna biogenesis pathways. the size of mature srnas and the complexity of produced srna proportions are two key features that can distinguish various srna pathways. we observed in our data that 24-nt srnas were the most abundant class of srnas, which was consistent with previous reports  <cit> . this bias towards 24-nt srnas was particularly strong in litchi just after cold storage. twenty-one-nucleotide srnas, on the contrary, showed a decreased abundance upon cold storage . this tradeoff suggested that different srna pathways are interlinked during the storage. unexpectedly, 21-nt srnas in our study were less abundant than 22-nt and 23-nt srnas, suggesting that litchi may only harbor a limited number of mirnas or that the length of mirnas in litchi may vary greatly. as shown in fig. 1b, we noticed an increase in the complexity indexes of all classes of srnas as the storage time progressed, regardless of whether the fruit was at ambient temperature or at post-cold storage shelf life, indicating a shift towards a more heterogenized population of srnas when the fruit senesced. furthermore, it was strikingly strange that 24-nt srnas showed the lowest complexity index while other classes of srnas showed the longer size the more diverse srna sequence composition . this finding was different from those of most reports in other plants and reflected a unique feature of litchi srnas.fig.  <dig> distribution and complexity variation of srna in litchi pericarp.  size class distribution of 20 ~ 24-nt srna reads during ambient and post-cold storage. the composition of srna classes is shown for each of the storage time points, defined as  <dig> d and  <dig> d at 25 °c, and 0 h, 24 h and 48 h at 25 °c after 2-week cold storage at 1 °c. rrna and trna sequences are removed.  change of the complexity for different size classes and all srna reads during ambient and post-cold storage. the complexity index is calculated as unique read count divided by total read count for all and each size class separately. higher index represents more diverse srna sequence composition



identification of known and novel mirnas in litchi fruit
known mirnas in litchi fruit were identified by matches to sequences from the mirna repository , allowing up to two mismatches. in total,  <dig> mirnas were identified, among which  <dig> mirnas from  <dig> families showed > <dig> total reads and  <dig> mirnas from  <dig> families showed > <dig> total reads, and precursor sequences were also identified . based on precursor sequences, these  <dig> mirnas were classified into  <dig> mirna families. expression levels of the known mirnas, as reflected by normalized reads, showed great variation among families in fruit samples at different time points. the highest read abundance was detected for mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> , which was many times more than other relatively abundant mirna families, including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  whose total abundance ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . these mirnas were highly conserved in a variety of plant species. in addition, many less-conserved mirnas found only in a few plant species were also identified in our dataset, such as mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  with a total abundance ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> . interestingly, we noticed a prevalent isoforming process for lch-mir <dig> precursors from litchi unigene no.  <dig>  which yielded precisely three mir <dig> isoforms with variable numbers of uridines at the 5′ end and highly variable abundances . there were more srna reads homologous to mature mir <dig> with one or two mismatches, which were also likely to be derived from this unigene .fig.  <dig> conserved litchi mirnas.  bar plot showing the number of conserved mirna families and members identified from litchi pericarp.  stem-loop structure of lch-mir <dig> precursor, which comes from litchi unigene no.  <dig>  isoforms of lch-mir <dig>  showing a variable number of uridines at the 5′ end, are detected with highly variable abundances



after excluding srna reads matched to known mirnas, the remaining srnas  were subjected to identifying novel mirnas in litchi using mircat and rnafold. the putative mirnas were finally considered to be novel mirna candidates when they met the criterion of plant mirna identification  <cit> . this analysis resulted in  <dig> novel mirna candidates in litchi from  <dig> unigenes , termed litchi-specific mirnas. only two of them belonged to the 21- or 22-nt classes of mirnas, while all of the remaining ones belonged to the 23- or 24-nt class. equal numbers of mirnas were derived from the sense and antisense strands. similar to lch-mir <dig>  two litchi-specific mirnas , only differing in two nucleotides at the 5′ end, were identified to originate from the same unigene no.  <dig> . in general, the litchi-specific mirnas were less abundant compared to most of the known mirnas. for example, only lch-mirc <dig> had a total read abundance greater than  <dig>  while eight of the  <dig> candidates yielded levels less than  <dig>  furthermore, most litchi-specific mirnas showed a stage-specific expression pattern .table  <dig> predicted candidate litchi-specific mirnas



validation of identified litchi mirnas by stem-loop qrt-pcr
to confirm the existence and expression of the above litchi mirnas,  <dig> mirnas  were selected for stem-loop qrt-pcr analysis . in general, these mirnas all showed significant expression changes during different storage periods compared with the levels at  <dig> d. specifically,  <dig> mirnas were up-regulated at  <dig> d 0 h post-cold storage, among which the relative expression levels of lch-mir396e, lch-mirc <dig> and lch-mirc <dig> were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. notably, the expression of most mirnas changed quickly when stored at 25 °c for 24 h after  <dig> d at 1 °c. the expression levels of lch-mir396e, lch-mirc <dig>  and lch-mirc <dig>  declined by  <dig> -,  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, respectively . in addition, in contrast to other mirnas, lch-mir396v_ <dig>  lch-mir <dig>  lch-mirc <dig> were consistently down-regulated. furthermore, some mirnas were sequenced in low or even no reads, but they were detected by qrt-pcr, such as lch-mir159v_ <dig>  lch-mir319v_ <dig> and lch-mirc <dig> . similarly, one mirna  was not detected by qrt-pcr but was identified from sequencing data.fig.  <dig> qpcr analysis of relative expression of  conserved and  novel mirnas. the bar represents the scale of relative expression levels of mirnas. up  or down  regulation in expression are based on normalized data  generated by mev <dig> . each column represents a sampling point, and each row represents a single mirna. the relative expression is normalized to actin and the normalized mirna expression at day  <dig> is arbitrarily set to 1



target genes of litchi mirnas by degradome analysis
to identify targets of litchi mirnas in our dataset, degradome sequencing was performed based on the information about mirna and mrna sequences obtained from previous transcriptome analysis. a total of  <dig> , <dig> raw reads were generated with  <dig> , <dig>  unique raw reads and  <dig> , <dig>  cdna mapped reads, of which  <dig>  covered cdnas were obtained. after processing and analysis by cleaveland  <dig> ,  <dig> genes targeted by  <dig> known mirnas were identified . the identified targets were further classified into five categories  . among the targets for the known mirna families,  <dig> belonged to category  <dig>  representing the most abundant degradome tags corresponding to the cleavage site and matching cognate transcripts, and  <dig> belonged to category  <dig>  whose cleavage abundance was higher than the median but below the maximum. the number of identified gene targets greatly varied for different mirnas . it was shown that most mirnas could regulate more than one target gene, especially mirnas in the mir <dig> family, such as lch-mir396v_ <dig> , lch-mir396v_ <dig> , lch-mir396v_ <dig> , lch-mir396v_ <dig> , and lch-mir396v_ <dig> . this corresponded to the high expression of mir <dig> family members throughout the storage of litchi fruit. conversely, one target gene might be regulated by multiple mirnas at either the same or different cleavage sites, particularly for lychee_ <dig> annotated as an myb transcription factor, which was targeted by  <dig> mirnas from the mir <dig> and mir <dig> families, suggesting that mybs, as key transcription factors in various biological processes, are likely to be strictly controlled by mirnas.

gene targets were also identified for the  <dig> litchi-specific mirnas. of the five gene targets identified, one belonged to category  <dig> and two to category  <dig>  while the remaining two fell into category  <dig> . while most targets of the litchi-specific mirnas had justifiable alignment scores, they were relatively poorly annotated; only two genes were annotated as a nac transcription factor and a caleosin-related protein, respectively .table  <dig> targets of litchi mirnas 



to better understand the potential biological functions of litchi mirnas, the identified target genes were subjected to gene ontology  and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  analyses . among all functional categories, targets involved in nuclear components occupied the highest frequency, followed by targets participating in dna-dependent transcription, dna-dependent regulation of transcription, and dna binding, respectively, indicating that most targets were transcription factors. in addition, there were some biological processes of low frequency but closely related to litchi fruit browning and senescence. these included a defense response to bacteria/fungi, the auxin/ethylene signaling pathway, cell wall organization, and anthocyanin metabolism. kegg analysis demonstrated that these targets played roles in five aspects, including metabolism, genetic information processing, environmental information processing, cellular processes, and so on. in the kegg functional classification, some classes of target genes related to senescence were also found, such as bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, flavonoid biosynthesis, and plant-pathogen interaction .

screening of mirnas and their targets involved in the post-harvest litchi fruit senescence and rlm-5′-race validation
to screen mirnas and their target genes that were most likely responsive to post-harvest litchi fruit senescence, several steps were carried out. first, based on go/kegg functional classifications and non-redundant  annotation,  <dig> target genes related to fruit browning and/or senescence were selected . these targets were mainly associated with cell wall organization, pathogen defense, hormone signaling, anthocyanin metabolism pathway, and energy regulation. here, it was necessary to note that some of these  <dig> targets were cleaved by multiple mirnas, such as lychee_ <dig> targeted by  <dig> mirnas, and some targets were predicted to be involved in more than one process, such as lychee_ <dig> participating in the organization of both the cell wall and anthocyanin. second, the above targets were further filtered according to their expression obtained by transcriptome sequencing. for the five sampling time points, genes with the highest expression level of no more than  <dig> rpkm were excluded. thus,  <dig> target genes remained after this step . third, the number of targets was further decreased, combining the relative expression of their corresponding mirnas via stem-loop qpcr . the mirnas that showed significant expression changes during storage were selected along with their targets. finally,  <dig> mirnas and  <dig> targets likely related to litchi fruit senescence were listed in table  <dig>  afterwards, nine senescence-related target genes were selected for rlm-5′-race validation, and the cleavage sites of six targets were independently confirmed .fig.  <dig> differential expression of mirna-targets in senescent litchi during ambient and post-cold storage and rlm-5′-race validation. relative expression is normalized to actin, and the normalized mirna expression at day  <dig> is arbitrarily set to  <dig>  the data are the mean ± standard deviation .  lch-mir396a targeting cysteine protease gene, which mediates proteolysis.  lch-mir393b targeting auxin signaling f-box <dig>  which mediates auxin signal transduction.  lch-mir396c targeting transcription factor erf, which mediates the process of senescence.  rlm-5′-race validation of the cp <dig>  afb <dig> and erf cleavage sites by lch-mir396a, lch-mir393b and lch-mir396c, respectively. the number next to the arrow indicates the number of sequences found at the exact cleavage site



discussion
litchi mirnas with conserved and new gene targets
in this study, we used deep sequencing and computational analyses to identify  <dig> known mirna families and  <dig> litchi-specific mirnas  in litchi. while the number of litchi mirnas was limited, compared to those identified in other plant species  <cit> , our study provides the most reliable and comprehensive list of identified mirnas in litchi to date. the majority of these mirnas showed stage-specific expression . in litchi, we identified a total of  <dig> gene targets for  <dig> known mirnas using degradome analysis , and the majority of these targets are conserved in plant species, indicating broad conservation of the known mirna regulatory roles in plants. however, a few of the known mirnas, including mir <dig> and mir <dig>  were found to target additional genes in litchi, which have not been previously reported. thus, while these known mirnas conserve their gene targets, they also appear to have an expanded target population in litchi.

although many newly evolved mirnas are believed to have no biological function due to low expression or no identified target, some of these mirnas have been shown to regulate specific genes or gene families in various species . in our degradome data, three of the  <dig> litchi-specific mirnas were found to target specific genes, suggesting a role for these litchi-specific mirnas in the control of transcription and stress responses, which may be unique to litchi fruit senescence . the inability to detect targets for the remaining litchi-specific mirnas may be due to a low level of expression or the stage-specific nature of their target genes.

mirnas participate in proteolysis during litchi fruit senescence
senescence is a physiological process that has a close relationship with proteolysis in plants. senescence-associated proteolysis could trigger a massive degradation network of relative proteins and eventually lead to cell death  <cit> . in this study, the cp <dig> gene was down-regulated after cold storage compared with that at  <dig> d. however, when the fruit was transferred from cold to room temperature, cp <dig> showed an obvious increase in expression during shelf life . such a fluctuation in cp <dig> expression was partly supported by previous results, which confirmed that low temperature can inhibit fruit senescence while accelerated fruit senescence is associated with post-cold storage  <cit> . in addition, lch-mir396a identified to target cp <dig> showed an opposite trend of expression by qpcr, especially during cold and post-cold storage , which exactly fit the mechanism of mirna action  <cit> . however, the mirna was up-regulated  <dig> -fold at  <dig> d during room temperature storage, while its target cp <dig> showed no change in expression, implicating that cp <dig> activation or suppression may also depend on ph, the action of other proteases and the cellular or extracellular environment.

mirnas participate in hormone pathways during litchi fruit senescence
among plant hormone pathways, the relationship between auxin and mirnas has been well studied  <cit> . in our study, lch-mir393b was found to target lychee_ <dig>  which is annotated as afb <dig> . at the five sampling time points, the expression of mir <dig> was essentially complementary to that of the target afb <dig> . this trend of expression was similar to previous results  <cit> . it is also worth mentioning that the expression level of mir <dig> changed sharply during both ambient storage and post-cold storage, with the relative expression increasing fivefold compared with that at  <dig> d . later, this mirna expression declined significantly, nearly fourfold after post-cold storage at 24 h. conversely, the expression of its target gene afb <dig> increased almost fourfold during the same period. the significant variation in expression suggested that mir <dig> played a key role in the post-harvest senescence of litchi fruit by mediating auxin signaling. the auxin response has been suggested to be common between arabidopsis silique senescence and the over-ripening process in tomato  <cit> . however, the effect of auxin on the delay or acceleration of fruit senescence may depend on various factors. it has been reported that auxin can inhibit the ripening process in tomato  <cit> , while low levels of auxin are required for seed dehiscence in arabidopsis  <cit> .

a mirna-tf network may contribute to the regulation of litchi fruit senescence
as main target genes of most mirnas, transcription factors  have a crucial function in a wide range of biological processes. in this study, we also identified several mirnas that regulate downstream tfs that are associated with litchi fruit senescence .

previous studies have shown that erfs are key elements in integrating ethylene and jasmonic acid pathways for fruit ripening and senescence  <cit> . in addition to mir <dig>  other mirnas, such as mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  have recently been predicted to inhibit hevea transcripts of  <dig> hbap2/erf genes  <cit> . in our study, lch-mir396c was identified to slice lychee_ <dig>  which was annotated as a transcription factor containing an ap2/erf domain. the mirna was up-regulated regardless of whether the fruit was stored at 1 °c or 25 °c, while the expression continued to decline when fruit was kept for 24 h and 48 h at 25 °c after cold storage . at the same time, the target gene erf showed an opposite trend in expression, which demonstrated the regulation by lch-mir396c and their joint participation in litchi fruit senescence. however, because different erf gene family members can have either positive or negative effects on the downstream gene expression  <cit> , the exact role of mir <dig> in litchi fruit senescence remains to be further determined.

taken together, we proposed that these mirnas and their target genes may interplay in proteolysis, hormone signaling, cell wall organization and secondary metabolism, thus collectively regulating the process of post-harvest litchi fruit senescence .fig.  <dig> a proposed mirna-regulatory network during litchi fruit senescence. those mirnas and their target genes validated by 5′-race are highlighted in bold in the figure. it is proposed that these mirnas and their targets may interplay in proteolysis, hormone signaling, cell wall organization and secondary metabolism, thus collectively regulating the process of post-harvest litchi fruit senescence



CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we constructed five small rna libraries from litchi pericarp at different storage periods and a mixed degradome library. through sequencing and analysis,  <dig> mirnas belonging to  <dig> conserved mirna families and  <dig> novel mirnas were first obtained in litchi. among these,  <dig> mirnas were identified to cleave  <dig> targets. after a series of analyses,  <dig> mirna-target pairs were found to be involved in fruit senescence. we proposed the possible regulatory network that these mirnas and their targets collectively mediated the post-harvest litchi fruit senescence . these findings offered new ideas that mirnas are actively involved in litchi fruit senescence by regulating the upstream transcription factor genes. we may take advantage of specific mirnas as a marker for early senescence prediction and further as the candidate for mirna-based posttranscriptional gene silencing to delay fruit senescence.
