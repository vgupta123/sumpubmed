BACKGROUND
to resist attack by microbial pathogens, plants have evolved to recognize them, triggering the expression of diverse defense reactions. the currently accepted model is that plants recognize conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns  through corresponding pattern recognition receptors  which in turn trigger plant immune responses  <cit> . the involvement of prrs in disease resistance against bacterial pathogens is well-documented. for example, the n-terminal amino acid sequence of bacterial flagellin  can be recognized through the corresponding receptor fls <dig> in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . in addition, the n-terminal sequence of bacterial translational elongation factor tu  can be recognized through the corresponding receptor efr  <cit> .

in contrast to bacterial pamp receptors, much less is known about the role of fungal pamp receptors in plants. it is conceivable that oligosaccharides derived from chitin or glucan may function as pamps because they are major structural components of fungal cell walls and can induce the expression of several defense-related genes when they are applied to plants  <cit> . the rice plasma membrane glycoprotein cebip  was shown to be an important component for chitin-derived signaling and is thought to be a receptor for fungal pamps  <cit> . cebip was identified as a chitin-binding protein from suspension cultured rice cells and contains two lysm  domains which mediate binding to oligosaccharides. physiological experiments suggest that cebip is required for the production of reactive oxygen species by rice plants in response to treatment with chitin elicitor  <cit> . it is assumed that cebip recognizes chitin oligosaccharides present on the fungal cell surface or released into the plant apoplast, leading to the expression of plant disease resistance against fungal infection. however, it has not yet been reported whether cebip is actually required for restricting the growth of fungal pathogens in rice.

magnaporthe oryzae is an ascomycete fungus that causes the devastating blast disease in rice  <cit> . in the previous report, we have generated ssd <dig> mutants in m. oryzae and the cucumber anthracnose fungus colletotrichum orbiculare, in which infection of their respective host plants was restricted by cellular defense responses  <cit> . subsequently, by inoculating the c. orbiculare ssd <dig> mutant onto nicotiana benthamiana plants in which defense-related genes were silenced, we evaluated the involvement of those genes in basal defense. these experiments revealed that plants in which genes encoding specific mapkk  and mapks  had been silenced were susceptible to the ssd <dig> mutant, as well as the wild-type strain  <cit> . furthermore, we revealed that these mapks were activated by fungal cell surface components during infection and that the level of mapk activation induced by the ssd <dig> mutant was higher than by the wild-type strain, suggesting that mapk signaling is required for enhanced basal defense and restriction of fungal infection. in addition, use of the ssd <dig> mutant together with gene-silenced plants allowed us to critically evaluate the involvement of specific defense-related genes in basal resistance by assessing whether the ssd <dig> mutant could produce disease lesions on the silenced plants.

in plants, rna interference  is a powerful tool for the evaluation of gene function  <cit> . for rnai, it is necessary to generate transgenic plants that express a partial fragment of the target gene, but considerable time is required to obtain seeds from t <dig> transformants. in contrast, virus-induced gene silencing  is a simple, rapid method to transiently generate knock-down plants that avoids the need for stable transformation  <cit> . although procedures for vigs are not yet established for rice, there are reports that vigs is applicable to barley through the use of barley stripe mosaic virus   <cit> . barley is a susceptible host plant for m. oryzae, so that interactions between m. oryzae and barley provide a model for the molecular analysis of compatible interactions between monocot plants and fungal pathogens  <cit> .

in this study, we have exploited the barley-magnaporthe pathosystem to evaluate the involvement in basal resistance of genes encoding a putative pamp receptor, namely hvcebip, which is homologous to the rice chitin receptor cebip. for this, we used the m. oryzae ssd <dig> mutant and bsmv-mediated gene silencing. we present evidence that hvcebip contributes to basal defense against appressorium-mediated infection by m. oryzae in barley.

RESULTS
magnaporthe oryzae ssd <dig> is required for infection of barley
in previous work we showed that the ssd <dig> gene of m. oryzae is essential for the successful infection of susceptible rice plants, and that the failure of mossd <dig> mutants to infect was associated with the accumulation of reactive oxygen species  by host cells  <cit> . first, we examined whether the ssd <dig> gene is also essential for the infection of barley . when conidial suspensions of the wild-type strain hoku- <dig> were inoculated onto leaves, necrotic lesions similar to those of rice blast disease could be observed at  <dig> days post inoculation . in contrast, leaves inoculated with the mossd <dig> mutants k <dig> and k <dig> did not show visible disease symptoms . when conidial suspensions were spotted onto intact leaf blades of barley, mutant k <dig> did not produce any disease symptoms, although the wild-type hoku- <dig> forms typical blast lesions at inoculation sites at  <dig> dpi . to test whether the k <dig> mutant retained invasive growth ability, conidial suspensions were spotted onto wound sites on the surface of barley leaves. the mutant produced brown necrotic flecks at wound sites but disease symptoms did not spread further, in contrast to the wild-type hoku- <dig> which could form typical blast lesions after infection through wounds . overall, the pathogenicity of the m. oryzae ssd <dig> mutants was severely attenuated on barley, producing an infection phenotype similar to that seen previously on rice  <cit> .

microscopic analysis showed that the mossd <dig> mutant formed appressoria on the plant surface indistinguishable from those of the wild-type strain hoku- <dig> . however, while hoku- <dig> produced intracellular infection hyphae inside host epidermal cells, mutant k <dig> had formed no infection hyphae at  <dig> hpi . to observe the responses of h. vulgare cells to attempted infection by the mutant, inoculated leaves were stained with  <dig> '-diaminobenzidine  to detect h2o <dig> accumulation. however, no significant accumulation of h2o <dig> was detectable in host cells after inoculation with hoku- <dig> or k <dig> at  <dig> hpi . next, we attempted to detect the formation of autofluorescent papillae under appressoria using epi-fluoresence microscopy  <cit> . at sites of attempted penetration by the mossd <dig> mutant, autofluorescent papilla-like structures could be observed beneath approximately 80-90% of mutant appressoria , and intracellular infection hyphae were only rarely observed inside host cells . on the other hand, the frequency of papilla formation under appressoria of hoku- <dig> was only 20% and infection hyphae developed from 60% of appressoria . these results suggest that the localized deposition of cell wall material  at attempted fungal entry sites forms part of the basal defense response of barley epidermal cells to appressorial penetration by m. oryzae.

virus-induced gene silencing of hvcebip using barley stripe mosaic virus
chitin is major structural component of fungal cell walls and is therefore likely to function as a pamp  <cit> . we therefore searched for a gene homologous to the cebip chitin receptor of rice using a barley est database  and found an assembled sequence ta30910_ <dig> which contains the putative full-length coding sequence. the predicted amino acid sequence showed 66% identity to rice cebip. furthermore, this sequence contained a signal peptide at the n-terminus, and two lysm motifs and a transmembrane region in the c-terminal region, which are all present in rice cebip . therefore, we consider this gene is very likely to be orthologous to rice cebip, and accordingly designated the gene hvcebip. when we examined the expression of hvcebip during the course of infection of barley by m. oryzae , transcripts were detectable at all time points , indicating that hvcebip is likely to be constitutively expressed in barley. in addition, we also examined the expression of selected defense-related genes during infection. genes homologous to phenylalanine ammonia lyase, respiratory burst oxidase homologue a and pathogenesis-related proteins  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were searched from the barley est database, and designated as hvpal, hvrboha, hvpr- <dig>  hvpr-2a and hvpr- <dig>  respectively. as shown in figure 3c, transcripts of hvpal, hvrboha and hvpr- <dig> could be detected at all time points, suggesting they are constitutively expressed. however, it should be noted that both pal and pr <dig> generally belong to multi-gene families and we cannot exclude that gene members other than those evaluated in this experiment may be inducible by fungal infection. hvpr- <dig> and hvpr-2a expression could not be detected at  <dig> hpi  but was detected from  <dig> hpi, suggesting the expression of hvpr- <dig> and hvpr-2a was induced by inoculation with m. oryzae. however, there were no major differences in plant defense gene expression induced by the wild type and mossd <dig> mutant k <dig> 

next, to evaluate the involvement of hvcebip in basal resistance of barley, we attempted to perform virus-induced gene silencing  using the barley stripe mosaic virus   <cit> . before silencing hvcebip, we first confirmed the efficiency of bsmv-mediated gene silencing in barley by silencing a gene encoding phytoene desaturase . after bsmv:pds genomic rna was inoculated into the first developed leaves of barley plants, a photobleaching phenotype typical of pds deficiency was visible on the third developed leaves of all inoculated plants, indicating that bsmv-mediated gene silencing of pds was effective in barley . for silencing of hvcebip, we first amplified a  <dig> bp partial fragment of hvcebip from barley leaf cdna and introduced it into plasmid psl038- <dig> which carries the γ genome of bsmv. the resulting construct, in which a fragment of the target gene is introduced in the antisense orientation, was designated as pγ:hvcebipas . the sequence used for silencing hvcebip did not contain either of the two lysm motifs . in the est data base background, we selected unique sequences to hvcebip, although without access to the complete barley genome, we could not exclude that there might be other potential cebip homologs that are silenced. next, we attempted to evaluate the silencing effect of hvcebip by rt-pcr. after inoculation of bsmv:hvcebip onto first-developed barley leaves, total rna was extracted from the third-developed leaves and used for reverse transcription. typical viral disease symptoms were observed in the third leaves of plants treated with bsmv  or bsmv:hvcebip genomic rna . in these leaves, the expression of both bsmvcp, encoding the bsmv coat protein, and hvef1α, encoding barley translational elongation factor, was detectable . on the other hand, the third leaves of plants treated with bsmv:hvcebip showed reduced transcription levels of hvcebip compared to control plants treated with bsmv . these results indicate that the transcript level of hvcebip was down-regulated by bsmv:hvcebip-mediated gene silencing in barley.

hvcebip contributes to restricting infection by mossd <dig> mutants
to examine whether hvcebip is involved in the basal resistance of barley to magnaporthe, we inoculated the mossd <dig> mutant k <dig> onto the third-developed leaves of barley plants after inoculation of bsmv:hvcebip onto the first-developed leaves. to quantify the severity of disease symptoms produced by the mossd <dig> mutant, we classified disease symptoms as follows; type i, no visible symptoms; type ii, brown necrotic flecks; type iii, blast lesions without brown necrotic flecks . on the leaves of bsmv-treated plants, most symptoms produced by mossd <dig> mutant k <dig> were classified as type i , whereas on leaves of bsmv:hvcebip-treated plants type ii symptoms were produced at approximately half of the sites inoculated with k <dig> . this tendency was confirmed in three independent experiments. when the wild-type strain hoku- <dig> was inoculated onto leaves of bsmv:hvcebip-treated plants, the frequency of type iii symptoms was slightly but consistently higher compared to the control plant, although these effects were not statistically significant . when conidial suspensions were inoculated onto wound sites on the leaves of bsmv:hvcebip-treated plants, there was no significant difference in disease symptoms produced by hoku- <dig> and k <dig> , suggesting that the silencing of hvcebip does not affect invasive growth ability through wounds. taken together, these results suggest that hvcebip is involved in basal defense responses of susceptible barley plants to appressorial penetration by m. oryzae.

to determine whether the mossd <dig> mutant was able to develop infection hyphae and colonize barley tissues, we observed leaf inoculation sites in bsmv:hvcebip-treated plants at  <dig> hpi. at sites showing brown necrotic flecks , appressoria were present on the leaf surface, and infection hyphae developed from appressoria inside the initially infected epidermal cell, which appeared to undergo a cell death reaction . however, when we observed inoculation sites at  <dig> dpi, fungal hyphae had not colonized the neighboring host cells and hyphae were entirely confined to the first infected cell . these observations suggest that mossd <dig> mutant appressoria could penetrate into hvcebip-silenced plants but subsequent growth of the infection hyphae became restricted by host defense responses. however, at the few inoculation sites showing severe lesions , infection hyphae were seen to develop from appressoria without visible host cell death . taken together, these results suggest that hvcebip contributes to host defense responses expressed after invasion of epidermal cells by m. oryzae infection hyphae.

to evaluate whether hvcebip is also involved in non-host resistance, we inoculated conidia of the non-adapted maize anthracnose pathogen c. graminicola onto the third leaves of bsmv:hvcebip-treated plants. although c. graminicola formed appressoria on the leaves of both bsmv- and bsmv:hvcebip-treated plants, intracellular infection hyphae were not observed, and no disease symptoms were produced . this suggests that hvcebip does not play a critical role in resistance to non-adapted pathogens such as c. graminicola.

next, we evaluated the possible role in basal defense of selected barley genes required for penetration resistance and r-gene mediated resistance to the powdery mildew fungus, blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei. for this, we used barley mutant lines deficient in ror <dig> and ror <dig>   <cit> , rar <dig>   <cit>  and rom <dig>   <cit> . after inoculating conidial suspension of mossd <dig> mutant k <dig> onto leaves of these barley mutants, no significant differences in symptom severity were observed compared to the respective wild-type barley cultivars . it therefore appears that none of these genes are involved in restricting infection by the mossd <dig> mutant.

expression profiling of defense-related genes in hvcebip-silenced plants
to identify plant defense-related genes that may be regulated by hvcebip-mediated signaling, we evaluated the expression patterns of selected barley defense genes in the leaves of bsmv:hvcebip-treated plants . total rnas were extracted at  <dig> h ,  <dig> h and  <dig> h after inoculation of the wild-type hoku- <dig> or mossd <dig> mutant k <dig> onto leaves of bsmv- or bsmv:hvcebip-treated plants. the expression of hvef1α and bsmvcp was detected at all time points. in contrast, the expression of hvcebip was clearly down-regulated in bsmv:hvcebip-treated plants, confirming that hvcebip had been silenced. the expression of hvpal, hvpr-2a and hvpr- <dig> also appeared to be down-regulated in bsmv:hvcebip-treated plants compared to bsmv-treated plants. however, the expression levels of hvpr- <dig> and hvrboha in bsmv:hvcebip-treated plants were similar to those in bsmv-treated plants. these results suggest that the expression of hvpal, hvpr-2a and hvpr- <dig> might be regulated by hvcebip signaling.

discussion
barley expresses two layers of basal defense in response to infection by magnaporthe oryzae
in our previous study, we generated an ssd <dig> mutant of m. oryzae, in which the infection of rice plants was restricted by a defense response involving death of the initially infected epidermal cell  <cit> . this cell death reaction expressed by rice in response to compatible isolates of m. oryzae has been termed 'whole-plant specific resistance' , and is independent of r-gene mediated resistance in rice  <cit> . in the present study, infection assays revealed that the mossd <dig> mutant also showed attenuated pathogenicity on barley. however, the host defense responses expressed in barley to appressorial penetration by the mossd <dig> mutant took the form of papilla deposition at attempted fungal entry sites rather than host cell death. the phenomenon of papilla formation during m. oryzae infection of barley has also been reported by other authors  <cit> . in rice, papilla-like wall appositions were also observed beneath appressoria of m. oryzae, although these appeared small and thin with electron microscopy  <cit> . therefore, the formation of papillae appears to be a general form of basal defense against attempted appressorial penetration by m. oryzae in barley. however, the efficiency of papillae in restricting appressorial penetration seems to be weak because the wild-type strain could successfully penetrate into plant cells with high frequency, as shown in figure 2c. apart from papilla formation, a localized cell death reaction was also observed in the initially penetrated host cells in which infection hyphae had developed. this cell death reaction was observed in the leaves of bsmv:hvcebip-treated barley plants after infection by both the ssd <dig> mutant and the wild-type strain of m. oryzae. the cell death reaction was associated with inhibition of fungal growth because infection hyphae had not developed beyond the first infected epidermal, even after  <dig> days. the barley cell death reaction resembles wpsr in rice  <cit>  and conceivably it represents a basal defense response triggered after successful penetration by m. oryzae appressoria. it therefore appears that barley deploys two distinct layers of basal defenses against appressorium-mediated infection by m. oryzae, namely papilla formation and localized cell death. two similar layers of plant defense were also shown to operate during non-host resistance of arabidopsis to powdery mildew fungi  <cit> .

hvcebip is involved in basal resistance to appressorial penetration by m. oryzae
in our recent work, we used the c. orbiculare ssd <dig> mutant to show that a specific mapk pathway in n. benthamiana plays a critical role in host basal defense but genes required for r-gene mediated resistance  do not  <cit> . here, we used the m. oryzae ssd <dig> mutant to examine the role in basal defense of genes required for penetration resistance and r-gene mediated resistance. ror <dig> and ror <dig> were identified as genes required for mlo-specific resistance against the barley powdery mildew fungus blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei and ror <dig> shows functional homology to syntaxin atsyp <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit> . rar <dig> was originally shown to be required for race-specific resistance triggered by resistance gene mla <dig> against b. graminis f. sp. hordei expressing the avirulence gene avrmla <dig>  <cit> . rom <dig> was identified as a restoration of mla12-specified resistance  mutant that restores disease resistance to b. graminis f. sp. hordei carrying the avirulence gene avrmla <dig>  <cit> . however, infectivity of the mossd <dig> mutant was not significantly enhanced on any of these barley mutants compared to wild-type plants, suggesting that genes required for r-gene mediated resistance do not play a role in basal defense against m. oryzae, consistent with findings from the c. orbiculare-n. benthamiana interaction  <cit> .

in contrast to mutations in these barley genes, the knock-down of hvcebip did enhance infection by the mossd <dig> mutant. thus, on bsmv:hvcebip-treated plants mutant k <dig> produced more severe  symptoms, i.e. brown necrotic flecks, compared to bmsv-treated control plants . the silencing of hvcebip also increased the frequency of successful appressorial penetration by the mossd <dig> mutant. however, the formation of infection hyphae inside penetrated epidermal cells appeared to trigger localized host cell death, resulting in brown necrotic symptoms. these results suggest that hvcebip is involved in basal defense against appressorial penetration by m oryzae. in contrast to the mossd <dig> mutant, infectivity of the wild-type strain was not significantly enhanced on hvcebip-silenced plants but there was a slight increase in symptom severity. this suggests that although hvcebip contributes to basal defense in barley, the level of its contribution may be low, so that with the highly pathogenic wild-type strain differences in symptoms between non-silenced and hvcebip-silenced plants were hard to distinguish. one plausible explanation of these findings is that basal defense against appressorial penetration involves multiple pamp receptors and signaling pathways, of which signaling via hvcebip is only one. a working model for the contribution of hvcebip to the dual-layered basal defense responses of barley to m. oryzae is presented in figure  <dig> 

in addition to the increased frequency of brown necrotic fleck symptoms induced by the mossd <dig> mutant on bsmv:hvcebip-treated plants, a few inoculation sites also showed formation of severe blast lesions  as shown in figure 5a. lesion formation was not associated with localized cell death reactions and infection hyphae developed extensively, colonizing many host cells. this suggests that in some cases the mossd <dig> mutant was able to infect hvcebip-silenced plants without triggering cell death-associated defense responses. this raises the possibility that hvcebip might be involved in mediating the localized cell death response of barley epidermal cells to invasion by m. oryzae infection hyphae. thus, hvcebip might contribute not only to papilla-based defenses but also to the hypersensitive cell death response to cell invasion. hvcebip does not appear to play a central role in nonhost resistance because the non-adapted pathogen c. graminicola produced no symptoms on silenced plants. in contrast, the lysm domain receptor kinase cerk <dig> was reported to contribute weakly to the resistance of arabidopsis thaliana against the incompatible pathogen alternaria brassicicola  <cit> .

is hvcebip a specific receptor for components of the mossd <dig> mutant?
in the interaction between cucumber anthracnose pathogen c. orbiculare and n. benthamiana, we reported previously that the altered fungal cell wall composition conferred by ssd <dig> gene disruption triggers plant basal resistance through the activation of a specific plant mapk cascade  <cit> . we hypothesized that activation of the mapk pathway might result from recognition of fungal pamp by corresponding plant receptor protein. in this study, we attempted to determine whether hvcebip is a specific receptor for pamps expressed uniquely by the mossd <dig> mutant, in which case pathogenicity of the wild-type strain should not be affected by the silencing of hvcebip. however, the wild-type strain hoku- <dig> showed a slight increase in pathogenicity on hvcebip-silenced plants, suggesting that hvcebip is a receptor for component shared by both the wild-type m. oryzae and mossd <dig> mutant.

rice cebip is a receptor-like protein containing two lysm domains, which was originally identified in enzymes that degrade the bacterial cell wall component peptidoglycan  <cit> . recent biochemical analysis showed that the lysm domain can also mediate binding to chitin oligosaccharides  <cit> . the genome of arabidopsis contains five lysm domain-containing receptor-like kinases  <cit> , among which cerk <dig>  was identified as a receptor-like protein required for chitin signaling in arabidopsis  <cit> . although the function of the other lysm domain-containing receptor-like kinases is unknown, it is tempting to speculate that plants possess multiple receptor proteins for the perception of particular classes of pathogen-derived oligosaccharides. it is likely that other pamp receptors, in addition to hvcebip, are conserved in barley and contribute to basal resistance to m. oryzae.

CONCLUSIONS
rice cebip recognizes chitin oligosaccharides derived from fungal cells leading to the expression of plant disease resistance against fungal infection. we evaluated the involvement of putative chitin receptor gene hvcebip in barley basal resistance using the mossd <dig> mutant of magnaporthe oryzae, which enhances host basal defense responses. the mossd <dig> mutant showed attenuated pathogenicity on barley and appressorial penetration was restricted by the formation of papillae at attempted entry sites. on hvcebip-silenced plants, the mutant produced small brown necrotic flecks or blast lesions accompanied by appressorium-mediated penetration into plant epidermal cells. wild-type m. oryzae also produced slightly more severe symptoms on the leaves of hvcebip-silenced plants. these results indicated that hvcebip is involved in basal resistance against appressorium-mediated infection and that basal resistance could be triggered by the recognition of chitin oligosaccharides derived from m. oryzae.
