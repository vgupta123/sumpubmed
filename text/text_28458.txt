BACKGROUND
mesenchymal stem cells  are regarded as one of the promising candidates for cell therapy by either autologous or allogeneic transplantation  <cit> . mscs can differentiate into a variety of cell types, including osteocytes, chondrocytes, adipocytes, cardiomyocytes, neurons, and endothelial cells . transplanted mscs can mobilize and become integrated within the host to replace pathological or damaged tissue  <cit> . in addition, mscs can modulate immune responses and inflammation, providing growth factors or cytokines that can prevent cells from undergoing apoptosis in certain environments, notably in the central nervous system  <cit> . during the last two decades, an increasing number of studies have proved the therapeutic potential of mscs in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, spinal cord and brain injuries, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, and diseases of the skeleton . basic research on mscs in certain fields has led to the initiation of clinical trials worldwide. to provide therapeutic benefits and further understand the mechanisms responsible for them, large numbers of cells are needed  <cit> . thus, it is important to find efficient, economical and scalable methods to generate large numbers of mscs without altering their multipotency  <cit> .

ghrelin, an endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor , is a 28-amino acid peptide produced from a 117-amino acid preprohormone. the mature form of ghrelin may undergo several post-translational modifications, including the addition of a fatty acid chain  to the serine residue at position  <dig>  <cit> . ghrelin has been shown to stimulate growth hormone  secretion, to have both orexigenic and adipogenic effects  <cit> , and to influence the metabolism of both glucose and lipids. most ghrelin is produced in the stomach, by a distinct group of endocrine cells located within the gastric oxyntic mucosa  <cit> , with smaller amounts produced by other organs. small amounts of ghrelin have also been observed elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract and in the pancreas.

the mapks are members of a family of serine/threonine kinases that play an essential role in transmitting the activation of cell-surface receptors to effect downstream changes in transcriptional programs. they are expressed ubiquitously and are involved in the regulation of a wide variety of critical cellular functions, including proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis  <cit> . in humans, there are at least  <dig> members of the mapk superfamily, which can be divided into six distinct subgroups based on sequence similarity: erk <dig> and erk2; jnk <dig>  jnk <dig> and jnk3; and the p <dig> mapks. each group of mapks is activated by a distinct kinase cascade in which a map3k  phosphorylates and activates a downstream dual-specificity map2k , which in turn stimulates mapk activity through dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues within a conserved tripeptide motif . phosphorylation of these threonine and tyrosine residues results in a conformational change that increases the accessibility of the active site and enhances catalysis . erks are activated in response to various cytokines and growth factors and mediate primarily mitogenic and anti-apoptotic signals  <cit> .

while several studies have focused on ghrelin’s effect on the growth of neural stem cells and embryonic stem cells, few have examined its influence on mscs. here, we used ghrelin to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying rabbit msc differentiation to osteoblasts and to enhance the osteogenic potential of rabbit mscs. our data revealed that ghrelin triggers osteogenic differentiation of rabbit bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells through erk1/ <dig> signaling pathways.

RESULTS
identification of rbmsc
at day ten, cells reached  <dig> % confluence. at day  <dig>  the cells displayed a uniform spindle shape and reached  <dig> % confluence. to further identify the rbmsc, the expression of cd <dig> and cd <dig> was examined by immunofluorescence. the cells were cd <dig> positive but cd <dig> negative .fig.  <dig> identification of rbmsc. a immunofluorescence staining showing the expression of cd <dig> and cd <dig> in cultured rbmsc. b cellular proliferation during the second through fifth cell passages 



the proliferation of the cells in the second through the fifth cell passages was analyzed using an automated microplate reader at an absorbance of  <dig> nm on days  <dig> to  <dig> . the cells from the fourth and fifth passages were  <dig> % confluent at seven days and then entered a lag phase. however, the cells from the second and third passages entered the lag phase two days later. thus, the cells from the fourth passage displayed the greatest ability to proliferate .

optimal concentrations and timing of ghrelin and d-lys3-ghrp-6treatment of rbmsc
the mtt assay was used to assess cell growth and viability following treatment of rbmsc with varying concentrations of ghrelin, and to determine the appropriate duration of treatment to achieve the desired level of growth.

ghrelin was added to the growth medium to final concentrations of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ng/ml. the numbers of viable cells were assessed at  <dig> to  <dig> day . the results showed that the optimal concentration and duration of ghrelin treatment for rbmsc was 3days of treatment at 600ng/ml ghrelin.fig.  <dig> growth of rbmscs following treatment with ghrelin and with ghrelin plus d-lys3-ghrp- <dig>  a: growth percentage at  <dig> to  <dig> days following treatment with increasing concentrations  of ghrelin. presented as mean ± sd . b: the effect of d-lys3-ghrp- <dig>  treatment on cell growth following ghrelin treatment



next, we determined the concentration of d-lys3-ghrp- <dig> necessary to promote the growth caused by 600ng/ml ghrelin. rbmsc that had been treated with  <dig> ng/ml ghrelin were treated with d-lys3-ghrp- <dig> at concentrations of 10− <dig>  10− <dig>  10− <dig>  and 10−11mg/ml, and cell numbers were evaluated at day three . the result showed that 10−10mg/ml d-lys3-ghrp- <dig> could inhibit the growth caused by 600ng/ml ghrelin.

ghrelin accelerates the growth of rbmsc via the erk1/ <dig> pathway
phosphorylation states of the mapks erk1/ <dig>  jnk, and p <dig> were detected by their phosphorylation antibody which mainly combinate to the phosphorylation part in these protein. to determine which pathway mediates ghrelin’s acceleration of rbmsc growth, the phosphorylation states of the mapks erk1/ <dig>  jnk, and p <dig> were detected at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> min  following treatment with 600ng/ml ghrelin. the resulting increase in erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation was greater than that of jnk or p <dig> after 40min . to explore the function of ghrelin on rbmsc-derived osteoblasts, the rbmsc were allowed to differentiate into osteoblasts, and then treated with ghrelin for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> min. the expression levels of alp, runx <dig>  and osterix were then examined. the expression of these proteins at  <dig> min was higher than at the other time points .fig.  <dig> effects of  <dig> ng/ml ghrelin on mitogen-activated protein kinase  activation in rbmscs cells. a: the expression of total and phosphorylated erk1/ <dig>  jnks, and p <dig> proteins. b: contrast gray value of phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig>  jnks, and p <dig> based on the western blot. presented as mean ± sd . *significantly different from the  <dig> min group

when this treatment was repeated with the addition of 10−9mg/ml d-lys3-ghrp- <dig>  compared with treatment with ghrelin only, the phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> was reduced . the phosphorylation status of the jnks and p <dig> were not significantly changed , nor were the levels of alp, runx <dig>  and osterix .fig.  <dig> effects of ghrelin receptor inhibitor  on ghrelin-mediated mapk activation in rbmsc cells. a: the expression of total and phosphorylated erk1/ <dig>  jnks, and p <dig> proteins. b: contrast gray value of phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig>  jnks and p <dig> based on the western blot. presented as mean ± sd . * significantly different from the  <dig> min group

these results suggested that erk1/ <dig> plays a key role in ghrelin’s ability to accelerate the growth of rbmsc. to test this, u <dig>  was used to silence erk1/ <dig> expression. in the presence of u <dig>  ghrelin  did not accelerate rbmsc growth , and the growth rate was significantly lower than in the presence of ghrelin alone. the phosphorylation of p90rsk  was reduced , as were the levels of alp, runx <dig>  and osterix .fig.  <dig> effect on rbmscs following treatment with u <dig> . a the growth rate of rbmscs following treatment with u <dig>  u0126-: medium plus ghrelin; u0126+: medium plus ghrelin and u <dig>  b: effects on p90rsk and phosphorylation of p90rsk after the phosphorylation erk1/ <dig> was inhibited at . u0126-: medium plus ghrelin; u0126+: medium plus ghrelin and u <dig>  c: expression of alp, runx <dig>  and osterix proteins by osteoblasts after the phosphorylation erk1/ <dig> was inhibited, at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> min



discussion
ghrelin is produced mainly by the stomach, although lesser amounts are also produced by the bowel, pancreas, pituitary, kidney, and placenta. the ghrelin receptor, ghsr, is a typical g-protein-coupled seven-pass transmembrane receptor  <cit> . several studies have identified the protective effects of ghrelin on the reproductive system . other studies have shown that ghrelin affects the function of embryonic stem cells  <cit>  via the erk1/ <dig> pathway, but have not focused on rbmsc.

in this study, we verified the identity of rbmsc by their morphology and the finding that they expressed cd <dig>  a marker of rbmsc, but not cd <dig>  a closely related molecule not expressed by rbmsc. we found that ghrelin accelerates the growth of rbmsc through activation of the erk1/ <dig> branch of the mapk pathway. cellular proliferation following the second through fifth passages was analyzed on days  <dig> to  <dig> following the passages. the fourth generation rbmsc showed the greatest capacity for proliferation, whereas the second generation showed the least. the optimal ghrelin treatment to obtain maximum growth was 600ng/ml of ghrelin for 3days. we also demonstrated that this effect of ghrelin is mediated through its receptor, ghsr  <cit> , which we showed to be expressed at high levels in rbmsc. experiments in which the ghsr inhibitor d-lys3-ghrp- <dig> blocked the ghrelin-mediated growth provided further support for the role of ghsr.

to gain further insight into the mechanism by which ghrelin accelerate rbmsc growth, we evaluated the activity of signaling pathways downstream of ghsr. the mapks are a super-family of serine/threonine kinases that includes erk, jnk, and p <dig>  these kinases are involved primarily in the activation of nuclear transcription factors that control cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis  <cit> . our results suggest that ghrelin accelerates rbmsc growth via the erk signaling pathway, and not through the activation of jnk or p <dig>  we found that  <dig> to  <dig> min of ghrelin treatment was required to stimulate phosphorylation of erk, and therefore that the stimulus is time-dependent. furthermore, both blockade of ghsr and erk by chemical inhibition suppressed the ghrelin-mediated acceleration of rbmsc growth and promoted rbmsc differentiation to osteoblasts.

CONCLUSIONS
our results provide evidence that the ghrelin/ghsr signaling pathway accelerate rbmsc growth and promotes rbmsc differentiation to osteoblasts mainly through an erk-dependent pathway. this study only obtained the ghrelin function on rbmsc in vitro, in future will be in vivo. thus, our findings suggest that ghrelin might be useful in growing large numbers of rbmsc. further study is necessary before any clinical application is considered.
