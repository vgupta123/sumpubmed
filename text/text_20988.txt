BACKGROUND
alternative splicing  is suggested to be a mechanism to relax selection pressure  <cit> . it allows generation of different transcript/protein isoforms from the same genes, leading to increased functional diversity of the proteome. the evolution of alternatively spliced exons  has been a topic of extensive studies. a number of exon features have been reported to influence the evolutionary rates of ases, such as length  <cit>  and inclusion level   <cit> . previous studies used the non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rate  ratio test to evaluate the relationships between exon features and evolutionary rates of ases. the ka/ks ratio test is frequently utilized to examine the evolutionary rates of ases. coding exons are regarded under strong negative selection if they pass the test . therefore, the proportion of ases that fail the test  can be used to indicate the strength of selection pressure and the level of amino acid changes normalized by synonymous substation rate. it was suggested that exons ≤  <dig> bp or has ≤ 5% nucleotide substitution rate between species  may contain insufficient information, rendering the ka/ks ratio test powerless  <cit> . however, previous studies did not take into account the limitations of the ka/ks ratio test. since ases tend to be short in length and have small genetic distances  <cit> , a large portion of ases is "non-applicable". inclusion of non-applicable ases may result in high fte proportion  <cit>  and lead to questionable inferences of ase evolution. therefore, it is necessary to re-examine the relationships between inclusion level/length and evolutionary rates of ases using only "applicable" exons.

furthermore, the evolutionary rates of ases may be simultaneously affected by multiple factors. the relative strength of individual factors and additive effects of multiple factors on ase evolution have not been systematically explored. two factors other than length and inclusion level may also affect the evolution of ases: protein domain overlapping and frequency of exonic splicing enhancers . domain overlapping is important because functional domains are suggested to be under strong selection pressure  <cit> . meanwhile, eses are cis-regulatory elements that regulate pre-mrna splicing  <cit> . the conservation of ese motifs in ases supposedly would reduce the evolutionary rates in these exons.

in this study, we would like to address the following questions:  which of the four factors stated above has the greatest effect on the evolutionary rates of ases?  are there additive effects between these factors?  what are the combinations of these factors that make ases most conserved? we first examine whether non-applicable exons affect the interpretations of the exon feature-fte proportion relationships. then we design a boolean function combined with the karnaugh map  <cit>  to represent the evolutionary effects of combinational factors  and to determine which conditions have dominant  impacts on the fte proportion of ases. furthermore, since splicing patterns may differ between human and mouse, the mouse orthologues of human ases can be in fact constitutively spliced exons . therefore, we collected two datasets – the ase dataset and the ace  dataset – for testing the effects of exon features on evolution .

RESULTS
non-applicable exons significantly affect the relationship between fte proportion and inclusion level/length of ases
the basic features of studied human cses  and ases  are listed in table  <dig>  it appears that ases include more short exons and more low-divergence exons than cses . therefore, it is clear that ases include a much higher proportion of non-applicable exons than cses .

the fte proportions of cses, major-form ases, and non-major-form ases are shown in figure 1a. when all exons are considered, inclusion level has a clear negative relationship with fte proportion. both the fte proportions of major-form ases and non-major-form ases are significantly higher than that of cses . we then try to exclude non-applicable exons and re-analyze the new dataset. it appears that exclusion of these exons decreases the fte proportions in all three exon types while the negative relationship between inclusion level and fte proportion remains . however, the relationship is remarkably weakened . also worth noting is that the fte proportions in all three exon types have fallen short of 9% , indicating that even for non-major-from exons, the ka/ks ratio test is an adequate prediction tool as long as non-applicable exons are excluded. in addition, figure 1a also shows that non-applicable exons have a very high proportion of ftes, even for cses . surprisingly, more than 40% of non-applicable ases fail the ka/ks ratio test. the differences in fte proportion between overall and applicable exons are highly significant regardless of inclusion level . overall, the inclusion level of ases appears to be weakly associated with the strength of selection pressure. the weakened relationship between inclusion level and percentage of ftes when non-applicable exons are excluded implies that inclusion level may not be the most important factor that affects evolutionary rates of ases.

on the other hand, fte proportion reduces remarkably when the lengths of ases exceed  <dig> bp . the difference in fte proportion between short ases  and longer ases  is highly significant  even when non-applicable exons are excluded. furthermore, the fte proportion is as high as 75% for ases with length ≤  <dig> bp . in comparison, only 11% of short, applicable ases fail the test . the difference in fte proportion between all short exons  and short, applicable exons  is highly significant . therefore, although the negative relationship between length and fte proportion remains significant after excluding non-applicable exons, the applicability of exons still has remarkable influences on the fte proportions of ases, particularly for short ases. overall, our results reveal that interpretations of the relationships between fte proportion and exon features without excluding non-applicable exons may be misleading. as a result, the following analysis includes only applicable exons.

influences of protein domain and ese motif frequency on the fte proportions of ases
since functional protein domains are usually under selection pressure  <cit> , ases overlapping protein domains may be well conserved. the interproscan package and the interpro resource  <cit>   are used for protein domain prediction. an ase is designated as "overlapping with protein domain" if at least  <dig> amino acids of the ase can be found in an interpro-predicted domain. figure 2a shows that ases that overlap with protein domains have a much lower fte proportion than those that do not . therefore, our results suggest that protein domain overlapping has a significant effect on the evolution of ases.

meanwhile, we used three packages: esefinder  <cit> , rescue-ese  <cit> , and pese  <cit> , to identify eses in the studied ases. figure 2b illustrates that the mean ese motif frequencies identified by the three packages in passing-test and failing-test ases are somewhat different. however, none of the three differences is significant . consequently, the observation implies that ese motif frequencies are only weakly related to fte proportions of ases. this unexpected result may have resulted from overestimation of ese motifs by the ese prediction programs  <cit> . alternatively, it is also possible that eses in fact are not under very strong selection pressure because intronic regulatory elements may also participate in splicing regulation  <cit> .

influences of single and multiple factors on evolutionary rates of ases
so far we have discussed the influences of single factors on the evolution of ases. it is of interest to explore the following questions:  which one of the four factors mentioned above has the largest influence on fte proportion; and  how do combinations of these factors affect fte proportion. for simplicity, we denote these four factors as a , b , c , and d , and define four boolean functions fa, fb, fc, and fd for each exon ei as follows:

fa={ <dig> if length of ei≤100 bp  <dig> if length of ei>100 bp

on the contrary, we can also explore which multiple factors are rich in exons that can pass the ka/ks ratio test. by performing the similar manner stated above, we can obtain a new boolean expression epass = ab+bcd+acd = ab+cd . the fte proportion of epass exons is only  <dig> % , which is much smaller than that of overall exons . furthermore, 100% of exons  under condition efte =  <dig> = abc+abd+bcd  pass the test. notably, factors c and d are both negligible when exons are under condition ab. in other words, condition abc¯d¯

in summary, our results indicate that length and protein domain overlapping are the two most important factors that affect evolutionary rates of ases. the two factors are correlated because longer exons have a higher probability of overlapping protein domains. nevertheless, the additive effect of the two factors implies that length has some evolutionary effects that are irrelevant with protein domain . intuitively, longer exons may include more regulatory signals than shorter ones, thus making them subject to stronger selective pressure. however, our results also show that eses have only minor effects on the evolutionary rates of ases. although this may have resulted form inaccurate ese predictions or limited ese conservation, it appears likely that other regulatory signals  and protein size/structure also play an important role in ase evolution. meanwhile, our results also imply that protein domain has evolutionary effects independent of exon length. this is understandable because very minor modifications in protein domains can result in dramatic structural/functional changes. therefore, short, domain-overlapping exons that pass the ka/ks ratio test may be good targets for structural analysis for protein function inferences.

meanwhile, our results also indicate that multiple exon features are interrelated in affecting evolutionary rates of ases. the observation implies that these exon features may be functionally correlated. therefore, evolutionary and functional studies of ases should take into consideration the effects of multiple factors. in this sense, the method proposed in this study is a handy tool, for it not only distinguishes relative strength between factors, but also delineates combinational effects of multiple factors.

effects of exon features on aces
it is noteworthy that the ases analyzed so far are defined using human splicing patterns. therefore, these ases in fact include both aces  and lineage-specific ases . to further explore the effects of exon features on ase evolution, we retrieved aces from the asd database  <cit>  for the ka/ks ratio test. as shown in table  <dig>  aces have somewhat different evolutionary features from ases . similar to the results obtained from the ase dataset, domain overlapping remains the most important, while ese frequency insignificant in affecting the fte proportion of aces. however, in the new dataset the influence of length is only marginally significant. moreover, inclusion level also has a marginal effect on fte proportion, which is different from the ase-based results. these differences may have resulted from lineage-specific ases. since these ases occurred after speciation events, they might have been under different selective pressure from that imposed on aces. furthermore, we found that the ese frequencies are positively related to inclusion level of aces, though the relationship is not significant .

it is surprising that the frequency of eses does not affect the fte proportion in both datasets. eses are suggested to be enriched in cses  <cit> , which have been shown to be under stronger selective pressure than ases  <cit> . it implies that exons with low ka/ks ratios have a higher frequency of eses. therefore, ese frequency is expected to be lower in ftes than in passing-test exons. however, this scenario may be oversimplified for the following reasons. firstly, other regulatory elements, including ess , ise , and iss , also participate in splicing regulation. therefore, eses may not be the only  factor that determines skipping of exons. secondly, we have shown that inclusion level is only weakly related to fte proportion. even if eses can increase the inclusion level of their host exons, this ese-inclusion level relationship may not ensure the association between ese frequency and fte proportion. thirdly, eses are short and degenerate. an increased ese frequency may not result in an elevated level of sequence conservation. fourthly, the accuracy of predicted ese motifs remains to be verified. wang et al has reported that the motifs identified by esefinder do not significantly overlap with those detected by rescue-ese  <cit> . therefore, the relationship between ese frequency and fte proportion based on these predictions may be biased. overall, ese by itself appears to have no significant effects on the ka/ks ratios of ases. nevertheless, the importance of regulatory elements in exon splicing has been well-established. it will be interesting to study the combinational effects of multiple regulatory elements  on the ka/ks ratio test.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we evaluate the relative strength and combinational effects of multiple exon features on evolutionary rates of ases. we have reached the following conclusions: firstly, non-applicable exons will bias the exon feature-evolutionary rate relationship and should be excluded from analysis. secondly, length and protein domain overlapping individually, and also additively, have the greatest effects on ase evolutionary rates. however, aces shown a somewhat different trend in that inclusion level and length both have a marginally significant effect on fte proportion. the difference possibly has resulted from differences between lineage-specific ases and aces. thirdly, ese motif frequency is likely to be the weakest of the four factors studied. this is surprising because eses are regarded important for alternative splicing regulation and evolutionarily conserved. fourthly, length and protein domain overlapping have additive effects on evolutionary rates. finally, we have identified a combination of ase features  that characterize evolutionarily conserved exons. this can be useful when no orthologous exons are available for comparative analysis.
