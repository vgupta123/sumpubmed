BACKGROUND
enteroviruses  are common human pathogens belonging to the genus enterovirus, family picornaviridae. most ev infections are usually asymptomatic, but sometimes they are associated with diverse clinical syndromes ranging from minor febrile illness to severe, potentially fatal diseases such as encephalitis, paralysis, myocarditis and neonatal enteroviral sepsis  <cit> . evs have traditionally been detected based on virus isolation in cell cultures and subsequently serotyped by serum neutralization test, and were classified into echoviruses , coxsackieviruses  group a and b, and polioviruses. currently, based on the phylogenetic relationships in multiple genome regions, international committee on taxonomy of viruses reclassified evs into  <dig> species: ev-a to ev-h, ev-j and rhinovirus a, b and c  <cit> . of these species, seven  of the ev species infect humans while remaining infect non-human animals.

echovirus  <dig>  was first isolated from a hospitalized patient suffering from aseptic meningitis syndrome in  <dig>  <cit>  and had been classified as a member of ev-b. in contrast to other common evs such as ev-a <dig> and cv-a <dig>  both of which are categorized as ev-a and are major etiological agents for the widely spread hand, foot and mouth disease  , e- <dig> is considered relatively rare as it less likely to cause worldwide occurrences of clusters and outbreaks. however, epidemics of e- <dig> infection had been observed in europe and asia in the 1960s . similarly, association of e- <dig> with many clinical recognized syndromes such as gastrointestinal syndrome , acute serous meningitis  <cit> , paralysis  <cit> , fatal neonatal hepatic necrosis  <cit> , aseptic meningitis  <cit>  has been reported previously. in recent years, e- <dig> is more than detected in an outbreak or epidemic caused by other pathogens  <cit>  or exhibited sporadic infection in conventional virological surveillance .

as a coastal province, shandong has a population of about  <dig> million and major ports that could potentially serve as portals for importation of exogenous viruses. the acute flaccid paralysis  surveillance, developed for polio eradication program, was launched in shandong in  <dig>  currently, the afp surveillance has been conducted in all  <dig> counties of shandong province and more than  <dig> sentinel hospitals were included. afp surveillance can obtain non-polio enterovirus  strains as a side benefit and produce baseline data of local npev distribution and a genetic overview  <cit> . our previous study demonstrated continuous afp surveillance provided valuable information on the circulation and emergence of different ev types in the context of limited ev surveillance in china  <cit> . in this present study, we investigated the genetic characterization of e- <dig> strains isolated from shandong afp surveillance during 1988– <dig>  phylogenetic and phylogeographic analysis were combined to elucidate the evolution relationship and spatiotemporal dynamics of e- <dig> worldwide.

RESULTS
virus isolation
the annual numbers of reported afp cases , npev and e- <dig> isolates were illustrated in fig.  <dig>  from  <dig> to  <dig>  a total of  <dig> npev isolates were identified based on the molecular typing method in shandong afp surveillance, with e- <dig> serotype having the highest number of the total strains. in our study, e- <dig> was first detected in  <dig>  as the afp surveillance and report in china was not so active in the early 1990s, no e- <dig> isolates were detected for three consecutive years , and numbers of e- <dig> and npev strains increased substantially since  <dig>  it was worth noting that the proportion of e- <dig> in contacts is higher than in afp cases is due to the formation of ev transmission chains, for the rest contacts were probable positive as one infected e- <dig>  the mean constituent rate of e- <dig> was  <dig> % , and the highest constituent rate reached to  <dig> %  in  <dig>  consequently, e- <dig> under ev-b persisted to be the most commonly isolated serotype circulating in a long term trend in our afp surveillance.fig.  <dig> annual numbers of afp cases , npev and e- <dig> isolates in shandong afp surveillance from  <dig> to 2013




homology and phylogenetic analysis
excluding the same  strains and co-infection strain, we used  <dig> e- <dig> strains isolated from shandong province for phylogenetic analysis based on the vp <dig> sequence. homologous comparison showed  <dig> shandong e- <dig> isolates had  <dig> – <dig> %  vp <dig> nucleotide sequence identities among themselves and the overall mean p-distance value was  <dig> . phylogenetic analysis was conducted on partial vp <dig> coding region  of shandong isolates with global reference e- <dig> sequences. overall, the global e- <dig> sequences were distributed into two major partitions identified by lineage i and ii. compared with the global e- <dig> strains, all shandong e- <dig> isolates fell into a major phylogenetic lineage  that included strains from china . this is probably due to the more frequent population exchange in domestic than the rest of the world, as the international exchange needs to perform a more cumbersome procedure in china. therefore, isolates from china studied here existed distinct genetic relationship with other worldwide e- <dig> strains. we also suggested that e- <dig> strains from china had the same putative ancestor relative to the strains from other regions of the world.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree based on partial e- <dig> vp <dig> sequences of shandong isolates and global strains. strains are color-coded and represented group a-f according to their phylogenetic relationship. circles indicate strains detected in the present study; triangles indicate strains isolated from other provinces in china. abbreviations in isolate names are as follows: chn-sd, shandong province in china; usa, united states of america; aus, australia; in, india; fra, france; ban, bangladesh; mad, madagascar; nl, netherlands; nie, nigeria; caf, central african republic; gre, greece; geo, georgia; ken, kenya; pak, pakistan




within lineage i, all sequences segregated into three distinct genomic groups . homologous analysis revealed  <dig> – <dig> ,  <dig> – <dig> ,  <dig> – <dig> % nucleotide identities between groups a and b, a and c, b and c, respectively. strains in these three groups showed high correlation with the time of isolation, and a limited temporal overlap was observed among these three groups that circulated in shandong and other provinces in china. the phylogenetic analysis showed that strains in lineage ii mainly from india, australia, georgia, netherlands, france and bangladesh. for the  <dig> india strains isolated from  <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> strains segregated into group f with strains from australia, while the other  <dig> strains isolated from  <dig> to  <dig> belonged to group e in the phylogenetic tree.

phylogeographic analysis
in order to estimate the divergence time and substitution rate of e- <dig> more accurately, the complete vp <dig> sequence from shandong province and from global were selected to analyze with the bayesian mcmc method. different models were used for data analysis, and all of the results were summarized in table  <dig>  considering both the harmonic mean and the aicm model selection results, we concluded that the ucld relaxed clock model was a significantly better fit model than the strict clock model for each of the parameter. hence, the combination of ucld relaxed clock model and exponential growth  model were recommended for this study, and the estimated nucleotide substitution rate for global e- <dig> was  <dig>  × 10− <dig> substitutions/site/year . estimated the t
mrca of global e- <dig> strains was august  <dig> , china strains  was june  <dig> , and the strains isolated in other regions of the world  was september  <dig> .table  <dig> estimators of phylogeographic analysis on e- <dig> strains under different molecular clock and coalescent model combinations

discussion
compared with many ev serotypes which can lead to serious illness, e- <dig> is considered relatively rare as it less likely to cause worldwide occurrences of clusters or outbreaks. to the best of our knowledge, no detailed molecular epidemiology study was carried out based on a large number of e- <dig> sequences. owning to the launch of the global poliomyelitis eradication initiative, we had accumulated a significant number of e- <dig> sequences associated with afp surveillance which was developed for casting a wider net for poliovirus detection in shandong since  <dig>  for the detection of circulating evs, afp surveillance has also provided a major source of information in china, as specialized ev surveillance based on other approaches or populations was still very limited. in addition, studies conducted in other countries  also described the npev serotypes identified from the afp surveillance, and the information had attracted more attention of the scholars worldwide.

although e- <dig> may cause mild to severe neurological disorders as reported from russia  <cit> , france  <cit> , italy  <cit>  and japan  <cit> , unfortunately, no clinical information, molecular epidemiology and disease correlation of this serotype have been reported. this study, which was performed a comprehensive molecular epidemiologic analysis of shandong e- <dig> isolates, was feasible because of the large number of afp database during the last  <dig> years in shandong, china. during 1990– <dig>  a total of  <dig> afp cases and contacts were reported, and  <dig> npev isolates were obtained from stool specimens in shandong afp surveillance  <cit> . a total of  <dig> npev serotypes were identified, serotypes such as e- <dig>  e- <dig> and ev-a <dig> were the most commonly reported. it should also be notified that no ev-d <dig> strains were detected in our afp surveillance, although this ev serotype was associated with afp and other neurological complications. the proportion of e- <dig> isolated in this study was high  as compared to other identified npev serotypes  <cit> . additionally, e- <dig> was also found a prevalent ev serotype with afp surveillance in other regions of the world  <cit> . consequently, all these findings suggest e- <dig> as the possible causative agent of paralysis, and the molecular epidemiologic analysis of e- <dig> is still necessary.

evs are well known for their high genome plasticity, due to both high mutation and recombination rates. in this study, we analyzed the global e- <dig> genetic diversity, of  <dig> isolates from shandong and  <dig> strains isolated in twelve different countries. the phylogenetic tree  revealed that e- <dig> strains clustered in both time and regional distributions. for e- <dig> isolated in china, strains in group c and b were from  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig>  respectively and there were  <dig> and  <dig> years had passed since the last isolation in these two groups. the isolation years of group a spanned from  <dig> to  <dig>  revealing a long time circulation of this group in shandong region. moreover, it is obvious that e- <dig> isolates belonging to group b and c may have been disappeared after circulating for a period of time and was replaced by group a. viruses in group a may have become the dominant group circulating in china. alternatively, the information on chinese e- <dig> isolates is limited, and more sequences are needed to determine domestic e- <dig> phylogenetic relationships.

we used a phylogenetic molecular clock approach to further infer the historical background and geographic diffusion of global e- <dig> strains. the mcc tree  constructed was congruent with the results observed in phylogenetic analysis . it was perceived by bayesian mcmc evolutionary analysis that e- <dig> strains were circulated for about  <dig> years in the world. moreover, e- <dig> strains isolated in china may be the product of geographic segregation and has evolved independently in china for a long time. two observations suggest that the common ancestor of global e- <dig> lineages existed in the usa. first, usa was the first country reported to detect e- <dig>  <cit>  and second, the usa strain is phylogenetically more diverse within the phylogenetic tree  and the mcc tree  than those from elsewhere. however, these observations may reflect differences in afp surveillance intensity among countries and more information is required before we can conclude that e- <dig> was introduced to the usa multiple times from other regions. interestingly, our results indicate that circulation of e- <dig> in australia is very dynamic, as the virus likely to be the reservoir for evolutionary origin of e- <dig> in the world. the results that the nucleotide substitution rate of e- <dig> vp <dig> gene was similar to other ev serotypes  also suggested the evolutionary pressure acting on e- <dig> existed no significant difference with other serotype strains.

a particular focus of this study was to determine the phylogeographic relationship between e- <dig> collected from shandong province and compare these with those from other countries. to our knowledge, the current study is the first applying the bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction approach to gain insight into the emergence and spread of e- <dig> strains worldwide  <cit> . the phylogeographic analysis revealed that the transmission of e- <dig> in china likely originated from the australia, and then the endemic circulation was observed without spreading to foreign countries. however, e- <dig> strains in china and australia have no direct evolutionary relationship according to the phylogenetic analysis. the reason why the phylogenetic and phylogeographic analysis was inconsistent between e- <dig> strains in china and australia remains unclear, and analysis of more sequences with greater detail information will yield more precise diffusion process. in addition to spread from australia to india, e- <dig> strains seem to have been reintroduced into australia from india, and the same scene occurred among shandong province with guangdong and yunnan provinces in china. we believe that large-scale patterns in human mobility between these locations will provide a more plausible explanation on e- <dig> emergence and introduction. overall, as a well documented origin from the usa, e- <dig> in this area has become silent over the past few decades. australia may be responsible for the transmission of e- <dig> in recent years, and two regional transmissions were mainly detected, with one located between europe and africa countries and the other was in the asia-pacific region.

the results in this study are subject to a selection bias. sequences from genbank are limited, especially for the complete vp <dig> genes of e- <dig>  in addition, the first e- <dig> sequence represents a strain isolated in  <dig> in the usa, whereas the next sequences can be obtained from genbank originated in  <dig>  therefore, partial vp <dig> sequences were used for the ananlysis of the phylogenetic relationships among global e- <dig> strains. due to availability of limited gene information of global e- <dig>  further collection and analysis, together with detailed epidemiological information is required to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of e- <dig> worldwide. all these indicate that ev surveillance in most countries remains to be strengthened and the systematic surveillance are necessary in investigating the ev circulation and understanding the social burden of ev infection.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we collected the complete vp <dig> sequences of e- <dig> based on the 26-year acute flaccid paralysis surveillance in shandong province, and inferred the historical background and geographic diffusion of global e- <dig> strains. the estimated nucleotide substitution rate for global e- <dig> was  <dig>  × 10− <dig> substitutions/site/year, and the estimated t
mrca was august  <dig>  our research confirmed that the origin of e- <dig> could be in the usa, however, regional transmissions were detected with one located between europe and africa countries and the other was in the asia-pacific region. australia may be responsible for the spread of e- <dig> in recent years.
