BACKGROUND
malaria, a parasitic infection transmitted by the anopheline mosquito, is caused by the genus plasmodium. of the five parasite species that infect humans, plasmodium vivax is arguably the most prevalent in south and central america, melanesia, asia and the middle east, accounting for  <dig> -  <dig> million cases annually  <cit> . unlike p. falciparum, which often causes severe malaria, p. vivax infections are rarely lethal but a major cause of morbidity in endemic countries. an ideal control strategy is the development of effective vaccines, with potential targets in the asexual blood stage responsible for the clinical manifestation of the disease. the  <dig> kda merozoite surface protein  <dig> , a vaccine candidate antigen that is abundantly expressed on the surface of merozoites and plays critical role in erythrocyte invasion, is one of the major targets of the host immune response  <cit> . msp- <dig> is conserved in all plasmodium species. disruption of the plasmoium msp- <dig> gene has been demonstrated to have a deleterious effect on the parasite growth in experimental animals  <cit> .

the  <dig> kda precursor of p. falciparum msp- <dig> undergoes proteolytic processing, producing four major polypeptides of approximately  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> kda from the n-terminus to c-terminus  <cit> . these polypeptides are on the merozoite surface as a non-covalently associated complex. coincident with erythrocyte invasion the c-terminal  <dig> kda is further cleaved to produce the n-terminal  <dig> kda and c-terminal  <dig> kda, and except for the latter, all processed fragments are shed  <cit> . the  <dig> kda c-terminal, which contains two epidermal growth factor -like domains, remains anchored to the merozoite membrane and is carried into the invaded erythrocytes. these processing events appear to be conserved in p. knowlesi, a p. vivax-related simian malaria parasite  <cit> . both the  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda polypeptides are considered to be promising vaccine candidates for p. falciparum and p. vivax  <cit> . however, the gene encoding msp- <dig> , which is present as a single copy per haploid parasite genome, is highly polymorphic  <cit>  and thus, presents a major obstacle to effective vaccine development. there is evidence showing that allelic diversity of msp- <dig> is strongly associated with strain-specific protective immunity in experimental animals  <cit> . sequence variation in msp <dig> has previously been studied for p. falciparum  <cit> . a large proportion of p. falciparum msp <dig> has a dimorphic structure, with alleles classified as belonging to either k <dig> or mad <dig> type. divergence between these dimorphic alleles is estimated to have occurred approximately  <dig> -  <dig> million years ago   <cit> . although the biological significance of allelic dimorphism in p. falciparum msp <dig> is unknown, it is likely that k <dig> and mad <dig> alleles are maintained by balancing selection as part of the parasite immune evasion mechanism. we have shown that p. vivax msp <dig> also shows extensive allelic variation but that the polymorphism pattern is clearly different from the dimorphic nature of p. falciparum msp <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, in contrast to the presumed ancient origin of p. falciparum msp <dig>  the origin of p. vivax msp <dig> polymorphism is relatively recent  <cit> .

p. vivax has a unique evolutionary history as compared with p. falciparum. it is believed that p. falciparum and the closely related chimpanzee parasite, p. reichenowi, co-diverged alongside that of humans and chimpanzees  <cit> . in contrast, p. vivax is closely related to parasites such as p. knowlesi and p. cynomolgi that infect asian old world monkeys , though p. vivax does not infect the owms  <cit> . p. vivax has recently been proposed to have become a parasite of man by host switch from a macaque malaria parasite sometime between  <dig>  to  <dig>  years ago  <cit>  or  <dig>  years ago  <cit> . p. hylobati, a parasite of gibbons in southeast asia, is also considered to have originated by host switch from a macaque parasite. several asian macaque malaria parasites have a range of natural hosts, e.g., p. inui and p. cynomolgi infect multiple species of the genera macaca and presbytis  <cit> . p. knowlesi infects not only macaques, leaf monkeys and langurs but also has recently been recognized as the fifth human malaria parasite based from studies in southeast asia  <cit> . experimental infections of the rhesus macaque, m. mulatta, and the japanese macaque, m. fuscata, by p. coatneyi, p. knowlesi, p. cynomolgi or p. inui result in acute manifestations of malaria with high parasitemia, whereas these parasites produce less symptoms and low-grade infections in the long-tailed or crab eating macaque, m. fascicularis  <cit> . this indicates the same parasite species causes different disease manifestations among host species. such differential disease manifestations may suggest that immune responses to p. vivax-related malaria parasites greatly differ among host species . it is thus tempting to invoke that a major immune target parasite protein gene such as msp <dig> underwent unique evolution, depending on parasite species that exhibit difference in host range and host specificity. as such, p. vivax and p. vivax-related simian malaria parasites are invaluable resources in our attempts to understand adaptive evolution in malaria parasites.

in this study, we investigate  the occurrence of natural selection on msp <dig> in lineages of p. vivax and related simian malaria parasites through comparative analysis of phylogenetic trees between msp <dig> and the mitochondrial genome, and  using comparative analysis of msp <dig> polymorphism between p. vivax, p. inui and p. cynomolgi, we examine the species-specific diversifying selection on msp <dig>  results obtained here show that msp <dig> evolved under positive selection in ancestral lineages including the one leading to p. vivax and its closely related simian parasite species, three to six mya, coinciding with the period of radiation of asian macaques. also, a signature of species-specific diversifying selection was detected in p. vivax, p. inui and p. cynomolgi.

RESULTS
divergence of msp <dig> sequence
we obtained  <dig> new msp <dig> sequences from p. knowlesi, p. inui, p. cynomolgi, p. fieldi, p. fragile and p. gonderi . an alignment of the sequences, together with previously published sequences including p. vivax, p. simiovale, p. hylobati and p. coatneyi, revealed considerable sequence variations between species with substantial sequence length difference between  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp . these variations include numerous substitutions, extensive indels and varying numbers of repeats . since indels and repeats were unreliably aligned, these were excluded, leaving  <dig> bp aligned positions that were used for further analysis . nucleotide divergence in the aligned  <dig> bp sequences and amino acid divergence were 39% - 42% and 41% - 47%, respectively, between p. gonderi, an african owm parasite and p. vivax and related simian malaria parasites. between p. vivax and the seven asian monkey parasite species divergence was 15% - 21% and 24% - 36% at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively.

phylogenetic analysis of the mitochondrial genome and msp1
the mitochondrial genome of plasmodium has been shown to be free from strong positive selection  <cit> . in this work, we obtained  <dig> new sequences of the mitochondrial genomes from p. knowlesi, p. fragile, p. inui, p. cynomolgi and p. fieldi. together with reported sequences, we constructed the maximum likelihood  tree of the mitochondrial genome of p. vivax and related simian parasites and compared the tree with that constructed from msp <dig>  the mitochondrial ml tree revealed two major clades using p. gonderi as an outgroup: one for a clade of p. coatneyi and p. knowlesi, and the other for a clade of p. fieldi, p. cynomolgi, p. vivax, p. hylobati and p. inui .  relationship between these two clades and p. fragile was not well resolved. these results are basically consistent with the tree topologies constructed using two nuclear genes, β-tubulin and cdc- <dig>  and the plastid gene tufa  <cit> , 18s rrna gene  <cit> , and the mitochondrial cytb gene  <cit> . a ml tree constructed using sequences of three mitochondrial protein coding regions was similar to the ml tree using the whole mitochondrial genome sequence .

the ml tree of msp <dig> shows two major clades using p. gonderi as an outgroup, one for p. vivax and the other for the seven asian monkey parasite species. in the latter clade, three sub-clades were noted:  p. fragile, p. coatneyi and p. knowlesi,  p. fieldi and p. cynomolgi, and  p. hylobati and p. inui . topologies of the mitochondrial tree and the msp <dig> tree appear to be distinct, with striking difference in that p. vivax was displaced from its position closest to p. cynomolgi in the mitochondrial tree to an outlier of the seven asian monkey parasites in the msp <dig> tree. applying the mitochondrial genome sequence data to the msp <dig> topology, significant difference was noted between the two trees  . similarly, applying the msp <dig> sequence data to the mitochondrial genome topology, the two trees were significantly different . additionally, msp <dig> alignment columns were separated into a partition composed of first and second codon position sites  and another partition comprised of third codon position sites , with trees constructed independently for the two distinct partitions. the topology of the ml tree for msp <dig> codon  <dig> +  <dig> was the same as that of the msp <dig> ml tree using all sites, whereas it significantly differed from the topology of msp <dig> ml tree of codon  <dig> . applying the mitochondrial genome sequence data to the topology of the msp <dig> codon  <dig> tree, the difference was not significant between the two topologies . these results indicate that the msp <dig> best tree is significantly different from the mitochondrial genome best tree, and that the difference between the mitochondrial genome best tree and the msp <dig> best tree is largely due to nonsynonymous substitutions in the latter, suggesting positive selection in the evolution of msp <dig>

lineage-specific positive selection in msp1
we examined the occurrence of lineage-specific positive selection using the free-ratio model, which allows variable ω  among branches. for this analysis, the ml topology of the msp <dig> third codon positions was used. the free-ratio model revealed three specific branches having ω > 1: the branch ancestral to p. fieldi and p. vivax , the branch ancestral to branch a and p. cynomolgi , and the branch ancestral to p. hylobari and p. inui  . values of ω <dig>  ω <dig> and ω <dig> were not significantly greater than one by likelihood ratio test  when the free model was compared with the constrained models that fixed ω <dig>  ω <dig> or ω <dig> at one. since it is likely that a large number of sites in msp <dig> may be under strong purifying selection due to constraints of the protein's function, we estimated ω values for three separate msp <dig> regions: the 5' region , the central region  and the 3' region ; corresponding to the n-terminal  <dig> kda fragment, the central  <dig> kda +  <dig> kda fragments, and the c-terminal  <dig> kda fragment, respectively. in the 5' region, four branches showed ω > 1: the lineage to p. fragile, branches a, b and c. among these, ω of branch c was significantly greater than one when the free model was compared with the constrained model that fixed the ω at one  . in the central region, ω >  <dig> was detected in branch b . when the free model was compared with the constrained model that fixed the ω at one, ω was slightly higher than one though not significant . two branches  in the 3' region, likewise, showed ω >  <dig> but were not significant . as a whole, we observe that positive selection was acting on the msp <dig> 5' region and central region at the early period after the divergence among p. fieldi, p. vivax, p. cynomolgi, p. hylobati, and p. inui.

to infer the time of the two branches where positive selection was detected , we estimated the divergence time of lineages of interest using the mitochondrial sequences. the relative rate tests revealed evolutionary rate constancy in two different groups with rate heterogeneity between them : one group  includes p. gonderi, p. vivax, p. cynomolgi and p. fieldi using p. chabaudi, a rodent malaria parasite, as an outgroup, and the other  includes p. knowlesi, p. hylobati and p. inui using p. gonderi as an outgroup. in group i, the average pairwise genetic distance between p. gonderi and p. fieldi/p. vivax/p. cynomolgi was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and that between p. fieldi and p. vivax/p. cynomolgi was  <dig>  ±  <dig> . assuming that p. gonderi and asian monkey parasite species diverged around  <dig> mya along with their respective hosts  <cit> , the divergence time of p. fieldi, p. vivax and p. cynomolgi was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya. in group ii, the distance between p. knowlesi and p. hylobati/p. inui was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and that between p. hylobati and p. inui was  <dig>  ±  <dig> . adopting the divergence time of p. knowlesi and other asian owm parasites of  <dig>  mya  <cit> , the divergence time of p. hylobati and p. inui was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya. dating of the common ancestor of branches b and c was not successfully estimated, due to rate heterogeneity between the two groups. we therefore conservatively adopted the divergence time  of p. knowlesi and other asian monkey parasites as an older timing of the common ancestor of branches b and c. thus, branch b was estimated to lie between  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya, and branch c to lie between  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya.

polymorphism of msp <dig> sequences
intraspecific nucleotide diversity  varied between  <dig> % and  <dig> % in p. vivax, p. cynomolgi, and p. inui, in which ten or more sequences were available . average pairwise amino acid difference was  <dig> % to  <dig> %. our previous analysis has revealed the evolution of msp <dig> polymorphism in p. vivax and p. cynomolgi after speciation  <cit> . the present study extends this recent evolution of msp <dig> polymorphism to p. inui .

detection of the signature of diversifying selection
to detect amino acid sites under positive selection in msp <dig> sequences, we used the omegamap to perform a bayesian inference on ω   <cit> . this method allows us to identify positively selected amino acid sites in sequences even in the presence of widespread recombination breakpoints, thus applicable to p. vivax msp <dig> sequences, in which recombination events have been inferred  <cit> . the selection parameter ω was analyzed for msp <dig> alignments of p. vivax, p. cynomolgi and p. inui. p. vivax showed five regions with posterior probability of positive selection > 95% . p. inui and p. cynomolgi had eight and four regions, respectively, with posterior probability > 95%. most of these positively selected regions/sites overlapped among the three species: all five regions in p. vivax and all four regions in p. cynomolgi coincided with those regions in p. inui , suggesting between-species conservation of positively selected regions/sites. the number of positively selected sites varied among species:  <dig> sites in p. vivax,  <dig> sites in p. inui and  <dig> sites in p. cynomolgi . we are not certain why p. vivax showed numerous positively selected sites, although closer inspection of those positively selected regions revealed longer haplotype blocks in p. vivax . such haplotype blocks may have falsely produced relatively numerous selection sites. of note, at positively selected amino acid positions that were shared by the three parasite species, amino acid substitutions were remarkably divergent: e.g. amino acid substitutions at  <dig>  were r/q/a/t in p. vivax, h/q/t/p/n in p. inui, and l/q/v in p. cynomolgi.

positively selected sites within non-recombination sequence segments were also detected using hyphy/datamonkey  <cit> . due to the inherent limitation in the maximum number of sequences  that can be handled by the recombination detection program,  <dig> p. vivax sequences were randomly selected from a total of  <dig> sequences and analyzed, with the procedure being repeated five times. the number of positively selected sites varied from nine to  <dig> in five computations, and those detected thrice or more  were eleven, while those detected in at least one computation were  <dig> . the numbers of positively selected sites were nine and  <dig> in p. inui and p. cynomolgi, respectively. although only one positively selected site  was shared by the three parasite species, there were two additional selected regions/sites that were positioned nearby in each species: at  <dig> -  <dig> and  <dig> -  <dig>  it is also worth noting that in each of the three species, the positively selected sites detected by either omegamap and hyphy/datamonkey roughly overlaps : six of the eleven sites detected by hyphy in p. vivax ; eight of the nine sites in p. inui; and nine of the  <dig> sites in p. cynomolgi. positively selected sites are somewhat clustered in the 5' regions.

discussion
ancestral positive selection in p. vivax and related simian malaria parasites
this study presents evidence of a signature for ancestral positive selection on an immune target surface antigen gene  of malaria parasites. differences in the phylogenetic trees between the mitochondrial genome and msp <dig> of p. vivax and related simian malaria parasites suggest that msp1s have evolved under positive selection. positive selection was detected in an ancestral lineage leading to p. inui and p. hylobati   and weak positive selection in an ancestral branch leading to p. vivax, p. fieldi, and p. cynomolgi . in these branches, positive selection was not detected at the whole gene level but in separate msp <dig> regions. it is rare to find a gene showing evidence for positive selection at the whole gene level or a long gene region because most genes are under purifying selection  <cit> , and thus small regions that are under positive selection, if any, may not be readily detectable. we do not therefore exclude the possibility that smaller msp <dig> regions and/or limited amino acid sites were under positive selection in ancestral branches other than branches b and c of p. vivax-related simian malaria parasite lineages.

estimated time frame of these lineages was between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mya. it should be noted that  <dig>  mya is a conservative estimate because of the lack of an appropriate calibration point to estimate a common ancestor of branches b and c. with this in mind, the estimated time frame seems to coincide well with the period of radiation events of asian macaques   <cit> . it is plausible that asian macaque malaria parasites radiated along with radiation events of host monkey species. natural infections in macaques such as m. fascicularis with several asian simian malaria parasites like p. cynomolgi and p. inui are relatively benign, whereas experimental infections with these parasites are severe and frequently lethal to non-natural macaque hosts that inhabit areas free of simian malaria  <cit> . to survive in such partially resistant hosts, parasites would have developed a mechanism to evade host immune attacks and thus favorable mutations were probably accumulated in immune target antigen genes such as msp <dig>  during the radiation of macaques in southeast asia, sympatric speciation of macaques occurred and this may have provided a niche for a potential expansion of host range of ancestral malaria parasites. some ancestral parasites that successfully gained favorable mutations for immune evasion in major antigen genes during the radiation period may have succeeded in adapting to newly appeared macaque species, thus leaving a signature for ancestral positive selection on msp <dig> 

diversifying selection in p. vivax, p. inui and p. cynomolgi
polymorphisms of the whole msp <dig> sequences or sequences of three separate msp <dig> regions do not show evidence for diversifying selection in p. vivax and p. cynomolgi  <cit> . we confirmed this for p. inui . this is not unexpected because msp- <dig> is essential for the parasite survival  <cit> . however, we obtained a signature for diversifying selection at specific amino acid sites in these parasite species. interestingly, three positively selected sites/regions were shared by the three parasite species , suggesting a common structural feature of diversifying selection. however, amino acid substitutions in these sites/regions greatly differed among the three parasite species. also, other positively selected sites/regions were not shared among the three species. these indicate that the evolution of msp <dig> polymorphism is species-specific in p. vivax and related simian parasite species. the species-specific feature of diversifying selection on msp <dig> underscores the importance of understanding the protective immune response to the vaccine candidate msp- <dig> in a species-specific context.

little structural information is available for msp- <dig>  except for the c-terminal  <dig> kda polypeptide, which contains cysteine-rich two epidermal growth factor-like domains  <cit> . a hydropathy profile suggests that most of msp- <dig> regions, apart from the n-terminal signal peptide and the  <dig> kda polypeptide, are hydrophilic , being consistent with the prediction that msp- <dig> is a component of the merozoite surface coat  <cit> . it is thus presumed that positively selected sites are antibody-binding epitopes. amino acid substitutions are mostly radical ones in terms of chemical properties affecting, for example, the acidity/basicity and hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity nature, likely exerting influence in the antibody binding epitopes of the protein. alternatively, amino acid changes in these positively selected sites may alter the ability of antigen-derived peptides to bind to allelic forms of class ii major histocompatibility complex , resulting in specific loss of an immune recognition by particular t cells.

in p. vivax, positively selected sites/regions appears to be clustered in the 5' region of msp <dig>  seroepidemiology studies suggest that the 5' region is subjected to diversifying selection by immune pressures. a high proportion of individuals infected with p. vivax in colombia contain igg antibodies against pv200l, a n-terminal protein of p. vivax msp- <dig> . this region also confers partial protection from p. vivax challenge infection in aotus monkeys which are experimental models but not natural hosts of p. vivax  <cit> . clinical protection has, likewise, been correlated to igg antibodies against the n-terminal part of msp- <dig>  in western brazilian amazon  <cit> . similarly, positively selected amino acid sites were detected in the c-terminal  <dig> kda fragment that corresponds to one of the cleaved fragments of the  <dig> kda polypeptide of p. falciparum msp- <dig>  <cit> . in individuals living in an endemic area in sri lanka, naturally acquired antibodies were directed more strongly to the  <dig> kda polypeptide of p. vivax msp- <dig> than to the  <dig> kda fragment  <cit> , suggesting stronger immunogenicity of the  <dig> kda polypeptide. it is therefore probable that diversifying selection on the 3' region of p. vivax msp <dig> corresponding to the  <dig> kda region is driven by host's immune pressure. although positively selected sites/regions were also detected in the central region, no immunological study has been done to date, thus no clear inference can be made for diversifying selection at this region.

in the present study, highly polymorphic sequence regions consisting of indels and different numbers of tandem repeats with varying repeat units and lengths  were not analyzed due largely to limitations in reliably aligning sequences. in p. falciparum msp <dig>  sequence variation of tandem repeats is confined to two variable blocks, blocks  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . in block  <dig> of p. falciparum msp <dig>  different types of tripeptide repeats have been shown to be involved in protective immunity in individuals living in a malaria endemic area  <cit> . it has been reported that sera of p. vivax-infected patients contain igg antibodies strongly recognizing the n-terminal variable blocks of p. vivax msp- <dig>  whereas they do not react to the n-terminal conserved blocks  <cit> . thus, variations in the number and sequence units of tandem repeats in msp <dig> from p. vivax and related simian malaria parasites may well be associated with allele-linked protective immunity or strain-specific protective immunity.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study revealed a signature for lineage-specific ancestral positive selection on msp <dig> in p. vivax and related simian malaria parasites. this ancestral positive selection is inferred to have occurred three to six mya, coinciding with the period of the radiation of asian macaques. ancestral asian macaque parasites may have succeeded in expanding their host ranges when parasites successfully generated adaptive evolution in immune target antigen genes such as msp <dig>  the recently published parasite genomes of p. vivax and p. knowlesi,  <cit>  have revealed that the related two species evolved unique genetic systems of antigenic variation  for evading host immune responses. analysis of ancestral positive selection would unveil what is essential for successful adaptation to new hosts, and eventually help to further understanding the evolutionary arms race between malaria parasites and their hosts. additionally, in this study, a signature for species-specific diversifying selection on msp <dig> was detected in p. vivax, p. inui and p. cynomolgi, underscoring the importance of understanding the protective immune response to the vaccine candidate msp- <dig> in a species-specific context.
