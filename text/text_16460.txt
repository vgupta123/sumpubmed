BACKGROUND
macrophages are the first line of defence against many pathogens  <cit> . they discriminate self from non-self through the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns  that are not present in the host. the most-studied pamp is lipopolysaccharide , a structural component of the cell wall of gram negative bacteria recognised by toll-like receptor   <dig>  which elicits much of the pathology of gram-negative septicaemia. macrophages respond to lps with a sequential cascade of altered gene expression that leads first to inflammation and elimination of the pathogen, and then to resolution of tissue damage  <cit> . the laboratory mouse has been used extensively as a model for the study of macrophage biology and the response to pathogens. however, mice and humans differ rather fundamentally in the nature of their innate effector pathways. even amongst strict orthologs numerous inducible genes are regulated in one species and not the other, due in large measure to differences in promoter sequences  <cit> . for example, human macrophages do not induce the effector enzyme, inducible nitric oxide synthase , which generates the toxic radical nitric oxide, but instead induce indoleamine dioxygenase  in response to lps  <cit> . these differences are also evident when one compares gene expression profiles of mouse inflammatory models with human disease  <cit> . of course, aside from divergent expression of orthologous genes, a feature of the evolution of the immune system across species, and even within species, is the gain and loss of individual genes, especially within gene families  <cit> . such differences further undermine the utility of the mouse as a model.

the domestic pig  has been used extensively in medical research  <cit> , and in contrast to experimental animals, is economically important; the most important meat-producing livestock species world-wide . because of the intensive mode of production, they are highly susceptible to pathogen epidemics that can cause huge economic losses. viral , parainfluenza) and bacterial  pathogens often target the macrophage for replication and alter their gene expression. many of these agents are zoonotic. one advantage of mouse models is the availability of inbred lines that can be used to map disease-susceptibility loci. pig breeds may offer some of the same advantages. studies of viral  and bacterial  infections suggest that variation in disease susceptibility or pathology between breeds, or between individuals within a breed, is correlated with differences in macrophage activation  <cit> . such breed-specific variation also offers opportunities to breed for disease resistance or tolerance.

the study of pig macrophage biology has recently been expedited by the completion of a draft genome sequence  <cit> , comprehensive annotation of the pig immunome  <cit> , the development of a comprehensive expression array platform  <cit> , methodology for cultivation of macrophages  <cit>  and identification and characterisation of subsets of monocytes  <cit> . using these tools we demonstrated that pig macrophages are much more similar to human than to mouse   <cit> , and also provided preliminary evidence for distinct gene expression profiles amongst resident tissue macrophage populations  <cit> . the macrophages of the lung are of particular interest because this is a major portal of pathogen entry. there is evidence that they are specifically adapted to the airway environment  <cit>  and these cells are not readily accessed in large numbers from experimental animals.

in the current study, we have combined the available tools to extend the knowledge of the macrophage biology of the domestic pig. we have compared the expression profiles of macrophages from different tissue compartments, and their response to bacterial lps, in multiple individuals from five divergent pig breeds. analysis of the entire dataset using the network analysis tool biolayout express3d serves to highlight clusters of genes that share regulatory patterns across genetic and cellular variation. the data identify variation between individual pigs and breeds, and confirm the similarities between pigs and humans that support the use of the pig as a more predictive model than the mouse in biomedical research.

RESULTS
preliminary characterisation of the response to lps in different macrophage populations
we harvested macrophages from twenty-five pigs, five from each breed: duroc , piétrain , landrace , hampshire  and large white , with an average age of  <dig> weeks. a major advantage of the pig is that large numbers of cells can be harvested for biochemical studies; 1× <dig> cells for each compartment . to optimise the comparison, we first examined a time course of the response to lps of alveolar macrophages , bone marrow-derived macrophages  or monocyte-derived macrophages  from large white pigs . there was a clear distinction between the csf- <dig> cultured macrophages  and am. as noted in human and mouse macrophages, tnf production in bmdm and mdm was transient. after  <dig> hours, there was no further increase in supernatant tnf. by contrast, in am, tnf production continued to rise even  <dig> hours post-stimulation. these preliminary studies suggested that the  <dig> hour time point, used in previous studies of mouse and human macrophages  <cit> , would also provide representative coverage of the response to lps responsive mrnas in all of the porcine macrophage populations.

to enable the study of the macrophages from the twenty-five animals at the same time and under the same conditions, am, pbmc and bmc were frozen as described previously  <cit>  on the day of the harvest and used a few weeks later. pbmc and bmc were cultured for  <dig> to  <dig> days in the presence of rhcsf- <dig> until differentiation into macrophages  <cit> . the three types of macrophages were seeded at 1× <dig> cells/ml, cultivated overnight before removing non-adherent cells, replacing the medium, and cultivating with or without lps . morphologically, the bmdm and mdm were more spread on the substratum by comparison to am, where a subpopulation of cells is non-adherent . each of the populations expressed the macrophage markers cd <dig> and cd <dig>  albeit at varying levels . in order to control for the efficacy of lps stimulation in each experiment, prior to expression profiling, tnf concentration was measured in the supernatant of the culture at  <dig> and  <dig> h . with the exception of am from ham and lw, there were no obvious differences between the breeds in terms of the magnitude of this response. the higher production of tnf by am from these  <dig> breeds appeared to be due to a higher percentage of adherent macrophages amongst the cells from the broncho-alveolar lavage, which would not interfere with the microarray analysis.

the mrna was extracted from  <dig> pigs  from  <dig> different compartment  and at  <dig> time points and was profiled using the recently developed snowball affymetrix array  <cit> . of  <dig> arrays,  <dig> failed the quality check. the data from the microarray are available at ncbi geo . since the pigs studied were a mixture of male and female, we investigated first whether gender has any global impact on gene expression in pig macrophages. a principal components analysis  of the data did not show any distinct clusters related to the gender of the animals . detailed analysis on the differentially regulated  genes highlighted a small list of  <dig> genes that differed between males and females. the annotation of these probesets links them to obvious sex-dependent genes, such as usp <dig> y-linked or inactive-x-specific transcript . hence, the inflammatory response to lps of macrophages in vitro is independent of the gender and we considered all the data as a single set.

alveolar macrophages show a distinct expression profile from bmdm and mdm
the recently published pig gene expression atlas  <cit>  included replicates of am, bmdm and mdm from two individual crossbred pigs, but did not compare the populations in detail. we inferred that am were distinct from macrophages in the wall of the gut, notably in their expression of c-type lectin receptor genes.. the current dataset permits comparison in much greater depth, with the macrophages isolated from the same animals, and with 25-fold replication of the comparison. pca analysis of the data based upon cell compartment clearly distinguishes am from bmdm and mdm which are very similar to each other .

to identify sets of co-expressed genes, the transcriptomic data were loaded into biolayout express3d. using a pearson correlation threshold cut-off of r= <dig> , we obtained a graph comprising  <dig>  nodes  made up of  <dig> different clusters. the clusters can be segregated broadly into two superclusters as shown in figure  <dig>  the larger of the two superclusters  separates into further groups with related expression profiles. one group , with elevated expression in bmdm/mdm compared to am  includes genes encoding proteins involved in the cell cycle and dna replication such as cyclin b <dig>  centromere proteins cenp and histones-related proteins hist1h1a, hist1h2ac. this most likely reflects the fact that bmdm/mdm have been stimulated to proliferate with the growth factor, csf- <dig>  a second group, including cluster  <dig>  includes the genes more highly expressed in am. as inferred previously based upon a much smaller dataset  <cit> , it includes genes encoding the c type lectins such as mrc <dig>  and the signalling molecules tlr <dig> and map3k <dig> . a third group, including cluster  <dig> , comprises genes that were up-regulated after lps stimulation in bmdm/mdm but not at all in am . finally, another cluster exemplified by cluster  <dig>   which includes genes such as il1a, ccl3l <dig> or traf3ip <dig>  was induced in all the macrophage populations studied.

the second supercluster  is made up of clusters of genes down-regulated after lps stimulation, such as cluster  <dig> and  <dig> . these two clusters contain genes encoding proteins linked to intracellular signalling, kinase and phosphatase . the full list of clusters and the probes within them can be found in the additional file  <dig> 

to confirm the apparent difference between the macrophage populations, we analysed the data using an anova method.  <dig>  probesets  distinguished am from bmdm and  <dig>  distinguished am from mdm. only  <dig> probesets  distinguished the cultivated macrophages;  <dig> elevated in mdm and  <dig> in bmdm, essentially confirming the similarity of the populations indicated by pca analysis. the genes that distinguished bmdm from mdm were expressed at low levels and are probably due to minor contamination with other cells: lymphocytes within the mdm and fibroblasts within the bmdm. the list included genes such as t-cell receptor gamma chain, alpha chain for the mdm and collagen type i and collagen type iv for the bmdm . as shown in figure 4a, most probesets differentially expressed between am-mdm and am-bmdm are shared  and only  <dig> probesets are differentially expressed in all  <dig> types of macrophages. therefore, we selected the genes  that were at least 30-fold differentially-expressed between am and bmdm and created a heat-map in figure 4b. most of the bmdm/mdm-specific genes are part of cluster  <dig> , and include genes such as cell-adhesion molecule  <dig> , integrin alpha  <dig> , cd <dig> and the insulin-like growth factor  <dig> . igf <dig> is known to be csf-1-inducible  <cit> . the genes that are restricted to am are part of cluster  <dig>  the genes expressed specifically in am  included the alveolar macrophage-derived chemotactic factor-ii , the chemokine  ligand   <dig>  indoleamine  <dig> -dioxygenase   <dig>  il <dig> beta, the vascular endothelial growth factor  a and its receptor .

differential regulation of lps-responsive genes in am
pamps are recognised by several classes of receptors, including the toll-like receptors  and intra-cytoplasmic receptor such as nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein  or retinoic acid-inducible gene  <dig> . as the tlrs and nods are highly polymorphic in pigs at the protein level  <cit> , we considered the possibility that they might also be differentially expressed between breeds. however, there was no evidence for differential gene expression amongst the  <dig> animals surveyed. there was evidence of selective expression in different macrophage populations . tlr <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were more highly-expressed in mdm and bmdm. in contrast, tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> were highly expressed in am. tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> proteins can both heterodimerize with tlr <dig>  <cit>  but have different expression. tlr <dig> was barely detected, but tlr <dig> was selectively expressed in am.

we selected the genes significantly regulated by lps in am, bmdm and mdm with a p adj. value < <dig>  and a fold change > <dig> or <- <dig> . there was again a substantial overlap between these lists in bmdm and mdm. these gene lists include the up-regulation of ido <dig>  irg <dig> cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig>  as expected the  <dig> types of macrophages share significant up-regulation of genes encoding inflammatory mediators such as tnf, ccl <dig>  il23a, il <dig> and g-csf. a small set of genes induced only in the am included gm-csf , lif or il <dig>  the former is of interest because of the extensive literature on the specific function of gm-csf in lung macrophage homeostasis  <cit> . il <dig> has also been implicated in lung injury in septic shock  <cit> . as already shown in figure  <dig>  am have a higher basal expression of inducible genes such tnf suggesting that they are primed for an inflammatory response. indeed, there were only  <dig> genes significantly up-regulated in am after lps stimulation compare to the  <dig>  in bmdm and  <dig> in mdm. the complete list of dr genes in the  <dig> populations of macrophage after lps stimulation is listed in the additional file  <dig> 

breed-specific variation in macrophage gene expression
one of our goals was to identify the set of macrophage-expressed genes that have diverged under natural and artificial selection in the pig and/or to identify individual variation that might be exploited in breeding for increased disease resistance or tolerance. in addition to figure 1l where we showed no significant difference in tnf production between the  <dig> breeds for bmdm and mdm, we used a pca on the totality of the microarrays and found no obvious clustering depending on the breeds . in order to identify any breed-dependent difference in the gene expression during inflammation, we analysed all the samples  after  <dig> hours of lps stimulation. we applied the stringent test of a p adjusted value < <dig>  and a fold change  > <dig> or <- <dig> . the spectrum of differential responses amongst breeds for alveolar macrophages is shown in . only a small number of innate immune-related cytokine/chemokines genes were found differentially expressed between the breeds, including il12a and csf <dig>  which were more abundantly expressed in ham than in lw and pie. some genes encoding innate immune receptors are also dr amongst the breeds. tlr <dig> had a higher expression level in lr compared to lw and the c-type lectin cd <dig> expression was higher in ham than in pie. in addition, the il- <dig> receptor beta, cxcr <dig>  was weakly expressed in the lr breed compare to  <dig> other breeds . other interesting genes are dr between the breeds. the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4h  was highly expressed in the hampshire and piétrain breed. swine leukocyte antigen   genes  were more highly expressed in duroc and hampshire in comparison to landrace, large white and piétrain. these  <dig> breeds show a small number of dr genes, as shown in figure 6b. in all of the comparisons, ham and du clustered separately from lr, lw and pie, consistent with evidence from genomic comparisons  <cit> . the full list of genes dr between breeds in am, bmdm and mdm is presented in additional file  <dig>  the heat-map of probesets dr between breed in mdm and bmdm are presented in additional file  <dig> 

comparison with other species: the pig as a convenient model for human disease
to compare pig macrophages with mice and human, we selected  <dig>  lps-regulated genes identified in a previous study  <cit> . after removing  <dig> genes for which no porcine orthologous genes have been annotated on the snowball microarray, we selected  <dig> genes that were dr between mouse and human after  <dig> hours stimulation of lps, with a p <  <dig> , in the earlier study . we then clustered these genes using biolayout . these clusters segregate into  <dig> superclusters. cluster  <dig> contains ido <dig>  which is highly up-regulated in human and pig macrophages in response to lps, whereas cluster  <dig> contains nos2a  which is lps-inducible only in mouse macrophages. cluster  <dig> include genes such as ddx <dig> . cluster  <dig>  includes various genes playing a role in inflammation such as irak <dig>  il12b, il <dig>  il <dig> . amongst the  <dig> genes sharing the profile of ido <dig>   <dig> had a correlation > <dig>  . this set included gmpr, il7r, slc25a <dig>  identified previously using a more limited platform and smaller dataset  <cit> . the mouse-specific pattern exhibited by nos2a was shared by  <dig> other genes,  <dig> of which, including arg <dig> or cd <dig>  had a correlation >  <dig>  . the full dataset of correlated expression across species is provided in additional file  <dig> 

investigation on the inter-individual differences between pigs
we examined the array data to identify candidate null mutations. in keeping with previous evidence of variable expression  <cit> , we found that one pig had no expression of swine leukocyte antigen  <dig> , the major histocompatibility complex in pigs  and two piétrain pigs had substantially lower expression of the cyclin m <dig>  gene than the rest of the animals . to identify genes with highly variable expression between individuals, we calculated the average expression and the sed of all probesets for all  <dig> conditions . then, we analysed the percentage of variance  of each probeset. the full list of probesets with their variance is provided in additional file  <dig>  the majority of genes have a percentage variance <  <dig> 

the variance data are plotted in figure 8c and d. the genes with highest percentage variance  are clearly enriched for immune function. in bmdm and mdm the most variable gene is cxcl <dig> followed by interferon beta, interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats   <dig>  ddx <dig>  ido <dig>  cxcl <dig>  il7r and il1rn. in am, the top genes  are linked to the immunoglobulin chain, due to the small contamination of b cell from the alveolar lavage. outside of this set, genes with a variance between 20–50% included il <dig>  ccr <dig>  il23a, igf <dig>  cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig>  genes with a variance > 20% were analysed using the david functional annotation webtool  <cit>  . for each compartment and time-point , the biological process clusters were given an enrichment score, ranking the overall importance of the annotation term group . the score of  <dig>  is taken as the threshold for functional importance . clearly, immune response genes are identified in every comparison.

discussion
in this study, we developed ways to harvest macrophages from the lungs, blood and bone-marrow of pigs and to freeze them for later use. this approach provides a convenient basis for analysis of the genetic variation in host pathogen interaction using in vitro challenge models. morphology, viability, tnf production and expression of surface markers  were unaltered by cryopreservation. our analysis allowed us to compare  <dig> different breeds and  <dig> different compartments  in terms of their gene expression profiles and responses to lps.

the basal gene expression pattern in alveolar macrophages  was clearly distinct from the patterns in monocyte-derived or bone marrow-derived macrophages, regardless of breed. the differences include a relatively high basal expression of ido <dig>  cxcl <dig>  ccl <dig> and il1b. interestingly, we also found that the genes encoding vegfa and its receptor flt <dig> were also highly expressed in am. alveolar macrophages do express the receptor for the macrophage growth factor, csf- <dig> . however, unlike most tissue macrophages, in the mouse they do not depend upon continued csf1r signalling  <cit> . in the op/op csf- <dig> deficient mouse, lung macrophage numbers correct with age  <cit>  and flt <dig> signalling has been attributed a role in age-dependent correction of the bone phenotype in op/op mice  <cit> . we suggest that vegf might have specific roles in alveolar macrophage homeostasis.

pattern recognition receptors also distinguished the macrophage populations regardless of breed background. the high levels of lectin-like receptors noted previously  <cit>  could contribute to elimination of particulate material in the airways, including bacteria and fungi. am expressed more tlr <dig> , suggesting that am would target mostly bacteria detection. in contrast to am, the bmdm and mdm expressed more tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> as well as rna intracellular receptors ddx <dig>  and ifih <dig>  suggesting a co-regulated cluster of genes involved in virus detection. there is, of course, a fundamental difference between the am and the two populations derived by cultivation in csf- <dig>  the mdm and bmdm. the latter cells expressed cell-cycle-related genes and may also be cell cultured adapted. for the purpose of genetic studies, the culture systems have the advantage that they largely eliminate the effect of in vivo environment including health status, and this is reflected in the relatively consistent gene expression profiles. nevertheless, fejer et al.  <cit>  have recently emphasised the fact that the phenotype of alveolar macrophages in mice can be replicated in vitro to some extent by cultivation of bone marrow cells in gm-csf, as opposed to csf- <dig> 

we also compared the inflammatory response in  <dig> different breeds and identified a small set of genes that could contribute to different disease resistance between breeds. landrace pigs expressed substantially less il-8r beta  than the other breeds . ait-ali et al.  <cit>  reported that landrace alveolar macrophages were more resistant to prrs virus replication and released large amounts of tnf and il <dig> into the supernatant. it remains to be seen whether differential expression of the il <dig> receptor contributes to this biology. the number of genes differentially expressed between the breeds was relatively small . there was much greater variation between individuals within breeds, which also urges caution upon studies of breed differences based upon relatively small group sizes. amongst the differences was the apparent absence of expression of sla <dig>  and highly variable expression of sla-doa. these differences might be associated with polymorphic variation in mirna recognition sites reported elsewhere  <cit> . significant levels of protein-coding polymorphism have already been reported amongst pig pattern intracellular and extracellular recognition receptors  <cit> . it is striking that such genes are dr between the macrophage populations, and highly variable between individuals. it remains to be determined whether such variation is heritable and can be linked to snp markers to allow selective breeding. the method we have applied herein, which can be performed on blood and does not require pathogen challenge of the animal, could potentially permit in vitro screening of breeding animals for optimal innate immune responsiveness.

in keeping with our earlier findings, now applied to a much larger data set and macrophages from multiple sites including monocyte-derived macrophages, pigs and humans share innate immune responses that are absent from rodents, and conversely, mice induce pathways that are not shared with large animals  <cit> . the index genes for these classes of genes are ido <dig>  expressed only in human and pigs, and nos2a, expressed only in mouse. using biolayout express3d, we found clusters of genes that share the same expression patterns with these index genes . analysis of the draft pig genome has highlighted numerous candidate genes underlying human pathology  <cit> . the findings herein emphasise the applications of understanding pig innate immunity for biomedical research as well as improved livestock production and animal health  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have examined the differences in cellular markers and gene expression between multiple macrophage populations from  <dig> pigs of five breeds. the results indicate that individual pigs vary most markedly in their expression of immune-associated inducible genes, whereas there are no major breed-dependent variations. the findings, using the lps stimulation as an inflammation trigger, suggest that there has been relatively little selection of pigs breeds for immune-associated traits. we show also that pig macrophages are human-like in their inducible gene expression profile, and the pig may therefore provide a superior model for dissection of human inflammatory diseases.
