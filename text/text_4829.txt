BACKGROUND
schizophrenia is a complex, chronic and severe brain disorder. so far, its pathophysiology and molecular mechanisms have remained poorly understood  <cit> . in the last decade numerous linkage and association studies, including a few genome-wide association studies , have been performed to identify genetic predispositions to the disease, but most studies have been inconclusive. the limited success in the detection of genetic factors led us to hypothesize that schizophrenia is likely caused by the altered expression of many genes, which may individually contribute only a small risk, but may in aggregate interact at the biological pathway or gene-network level.

recently, patterns of differential gene expression have been identified between schizophrenia case and control samples  <cit> . micrornas  and transcription factors  are main regulators of gene expression. mirnas are short endogenous noncoding rnas that mediate post transcriptional regulation and regulate a wide range of biological processes and diseases  <cit> . in the nervous system, studies have reported involvement of mirnas in brain development, neuronal differentiation, and synaptic plasticity, all processes that have been implicated in neurological syndromes such as schizophrenia, fragile Ã— syndromes, parkinson's disease and huntington's disease  <cit> . specifically,  <dig> mirnas were recently found to be differentially expressed in post-mortem brain samples of schizophrenia patients and controls  <cit> . interestingly, a case-control association study revealed that two single nucleotide polymorphisms  in mirnas hsa-mir- <dig> and hsa-mir- <dig> were significantly associated with schizophrenia  <cit> . furthermore, brain mirnas affected by a microdeletion syntenic to human 22q <dig>  were found in mouse models and human individuals carrying this microdeletion are at high risk of developing schizophrenia  <cit> . it has also been reported that mirna hsa-mir- <dig> regulates bdnf and alters the expression of downstream gabaergic transcripts in schizophrenia  <cit> . most recently, studies found that a mirna regulates signaling downstream from the nmda receptor, suggesting mirnas as a new mechanism for altering brain gene expression in schizophrenia  <cit> . this accumulating data suggests that mirnas may play important roles in the expression of genes linked to schizophrenia.

transcription factors are essential regulators of gene expression in all living organisms. a tf regulates transcription of its target gene by specifically binding to the transcription factor binding site  in the gene's promoter region. since expression of an mirna may be regulated by a tf  <cit> , tf and mirna may reciprocally regulate one another to form feedback loops, or alternatively, both tf and mirna may regulate their target genes and form feed-forward loops . two recent studies explored hundreds of potential mirna-mediated feedback and feed-forward loops at the genome level in mammals and found some interesting regulatory motifs  <cit> . besides, martinez et al.  <cit>  combined experimental and computational methods and identified  <dig> mirna-tf composite feedback loops in c. elegans. several feedback loops and ffls have been experimentally verified in mammals, such as feedback loops between zeb1/sip <dig> and mir- <dig> family in embryological development, e2fs and mir-17/ <dig> in cellular apoptosis, pitx <dig> and mir-133b in midbrain dopamine neurons, and a ffl e2fs-myc-mir-17/ <dig>  <cit> . these studies were performed at the whole genome level by a computational approach or for specific ffls by experimental validation, rather than a comprehensive mirna-mediated network analysis for a specific complex disease or tissue.

in this study, we explored mirna-tf regulatory networks in schizophrenia. among schizophrenia candidate genes , we identified the potential targets of tfs and schizophrenia related mirnas. these datasets and their regulations were used for mirna-mediated feedback and feed-forward loop analysis. we revealed some schizophrenia related mirna-tf regulatory modules and constructed a converged mirna-tf regulatory network in which egr <dig> and hsa-mir- <dig> served as core regulators. by combining mirna-tf network analysis and literature survey, we proposed a pathway model highlighting egr <dig> and mirnas involving in the signal transduction and regulatory pathways in schizophrenia.

RESULTS
mirnas and tfbss
our goal is to explore mirna and tf regulation in schizophrenia genes. figure  <dig> provides an overview of mirna and tf mediated regulatory network construction. we first compiled a list of  <dig> experimentally verified schizophrenia related mirnas , which matched  <dig> mature mirnas and  <dig> mirna precursors . most of the  <dig> szmirnas are conserved in vertebrate genomes and  <dig> are even conserved in drosophila. only one  is primate-specific and two  are mammal-specific. sixteen szmirnas  were found in mirna clusters. for comparison, we also collected and curated  <dig> brain expressed and  <dig> non-brain expressed mature mirnas, which corresponded to  <dig> and  <dig> mirna precursors, respectively .

we predicted mirna targets in szgenes by parsing targetscan prediction results. among the  <dig> szgenes,  <dig> were potential targets of our complied  <dig> szmirnas. figure  <dig> displays these mirna and target pairs. among the  <dig> target genes, the top three genes targeted by the largest number of szmirnas were egr <dig>  dpysl <dig> and cnr <dig>  which were targeted by  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> szmirnas, respectively. among the  <dig> szmirnas, the mirnas targeting the largest number of szgenes were hsa-mir- <dig>  mirnas in mir- <dig> family and hsa-mir- <dig>  which targeted  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively . hsa-mir- <dig> had the largest number of targets because it is a primate-specific mirna and the predicted target sites may not be conserved with a high false positive rate.

to test whether we observed more szmirna targets in the  <dig> szgenes, we ran a permutation to count the number of targets of each szmirna in  <dig> randomly selected genes, and repeated this process  <dig>  times. most  of szmirnas had a significantly larger number of targets in szgenes than randomly selected genes , while hsa-mir- <dig> had fewer targets in szgenes and the difference for  <dig> mirnas in hsa-mir- <dig> family was not significant .

using stringent criteria  and conservation among the human, mouse and rat genomes, we obtained  <dig> tfbss in the promoter regions of  <dig> of the  <dig> szgenes and  <dig> tfbss in the promoter regions of  <dig> of the  <dig> szmirnas. among the  <dig> szgenes,  <dig>  had fewer than  <dig> tfbss and  <dig>  had more than  <dig> tfbss. among the szmirnas, hsa-mir- <dig> and hsa-mir- <dig> had more than  <dig> tfbss . these observations seemed to reflect a complex regulation of schizophrenia related genes, tfbss and mirnas.

feed-forward loops  in schizophrenia
we obtained  <dig> ffls when we combined the regulatory relationship of szgenes, szmirnas and tfbss . we performed following two tests to evaluate the enrichment of these observed ffls in the szgenes. first, we compared the ffls obtained from szmirnas with those from brain mirnas or non-brain mirnas and then evaluated the significance by fisher's exact test. the difference was highly significant in the comparison of ffls by szmirnas versus non-brain mirnas  and significant by szmirnas versus brain mirnas  using the same szgenes . to increase the confidence, we did similar ffl analysis using three other schizophrenia candidate gene lists . when we compared szmirnas with non-brain mirnas, the p-value was always highly significant, indicating that we observed more ffls by szmirnas than by non-brain mirnas . we noticed that the p-values in the comparison between szmirnas and brain mirnas were slightly significant or even insignificant. this likely represents some brain mirnas in our data set that may be schizophrenia related but that have not yet been reported.

p-value was calculated by fisher's exact test between szmirnas and brain mirnas or between szmirnas and non-brain mirnas.

secondly, we ran  <dig>  random simulations . in each run, since there were  <dig> mirna target pairs between szmirnas and szgenes, we randomly selected  <dig> mirna target pairs out of all target pairs of the  <dig> szmirnas and calculated the number of ffls among tfbss, szmirnas and those randomly selected target genes. we calculated a p value =  <dig> , indicating that our observed ffls differed significantly from chance.

mirna and tf regulatory network in schizophrenia
tf and mirna may regulate one another and form a composite feedback loop. we identified  <dig> szmirna-tf mutual regulatory loops . twelve of these had at least one tf or mirna in the tf-szmirna-szgene ffls and  <dig> pairs had all components included in the ffls . we merged the  <dig> ffl-related szmirna-tf loops with tf-szmirna-szgene ffls and constructed a mirna-tf regulatory network for schizophrenia. it included  <dig> szmirnas,  <dig> szgenes,  <dig> tfs and  <dig> links  between these molecules  . among these  <dig> szgenes, several  are related to three neurochemical hypotheses in the molecular mechanisms of schizophrenia, i.e., the dopamine, glutamatergic and gabaergic hypotheses  <cit> . three tfs  in this network had association information in the schizophreniagene database  <cit>  but only the esr <dig> gene had a positive association study  <cit> . moreover, there were  <dig> pairs of regulation  that had been previously experimentally verified  <cit>  or annotated in the ingenuity knowledge base  <cit> .

subnetworks for core genes in the mirna-tf regulatory network
there were  <dig> core genes  in the mirna-tf regulatory network  according to the definition in the methods section. we extracted subnetworks for these  <dig> core genes by including the core genes and their directly linked molecules in the mirna-tf regulatory network . in this subnetwork analysis, egr <dig> stood out as a promising gene and regulator. as a gene, it is regulated by  <dig> tfs and  <dig> szmirnas, while in its capacity as a tf, it regulates  <dig> szgenes and  <dig> szmirnas. egr <dig> is the only gene in the network that links to all  <dig> of the other core genes.

among the  <dig> core mirnas , hsa-mir- <dig> seems most promising. it regulates  <dig> of the  <dig> szgenes in the network, while it is also regulated by  <dig> tfs . we examined the predicted targets of these  <dig> mirnas on all human genes and found  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> predicted targets, respectively. we next examined the enriched pathways of these predicted targets of the  <dig> core mirnas using the ingenuity pathway analysis  tool. interestingly, we found many neuron or schizophrenia related pathways, such as axonal guidance signaling and reelin signaling in neurons . there were two enriched pathways shared by the targets of these  <dig> core mirnas: axonal guidance signaling and ephrin receptor signaling. axon guidance is one of the critical steps in the proper formation of a neuronal network  <cit> , and ephrin/ephrin receptor signaling is one of the bidirectional signaling systems implicated in the control of axon guidance and synapse formation in many neural systems  <cit> . this analysis suggests that these  <dig> core mirnas may have important regulatory roles in the neuronal network. finally, we examined the enriched go terms of these predicted targets. interestingly, among the enriched go terms were several related to regulation and neurodevelopment such as "transcription regulation", "neuron differentiation" and "neurogenesis" .

snps on mirna target sites, tfbss, and mirna genes
snps on mirna target sites and tfbss have been associated with many complex diseases  <cit> . so far, most of the snps associated with schizophrenia have not been in exonic regions  <cit> . thus, it is important to examine snps in these schizophrenia related mirna genes and their target sites and tfbss. we identified  <dig> snps on the szmirna target sites of  <dig> szgenes,  <dig> snps on tfbss of  <dig> szgenes and  <dig> snps on tfbss of  <dig> szmirnas. moreover, we found  <dig> snps in pre-szmirnas and  <dig> snps in the expanded regions  of pre-szmirnas including one snp  located  <dig> bp upstream of hsa-mir- <dig> pre-mirna .

there were two publicly available gwa studies  for schizophrenia, neither of which has yet been successful in identifying significant genome-level markers  <cit> . surprisingly, all of these snps except one , were not included in either gwas marker set. we found two potential regulatory snps in grm <dig>  one of the five core genes. these two snps were located on tfbs  and mirna target site . both v$ahrarnt_ <dig> and hsa-mir-20b were included in our ffls. our literature search revealed that these snps and sites have not been studied for schizophrenia. further experimental verification is warranted.

online access of mirnas and their targets in schizophrenia genes
we deposited all mirnas complied in this study and their potential targets in schizophrenia genes into schizophrenia gene resource , a comprehensive online resource including genetic and biological data for schizophrenia genes  <cit> . szgr deposits genetic data from all available sources including association studies, linkage scans, gene expression, literature, go annotations, gene networks, pathways, and mirnas and their target sites. moreover, szgr provides online tools for data browsing and searching, data integration, custom gene ranking, and graphical presentation.

discussion
potential regulatory networks in schizophrenia
we performed an exploratory mirna-tf mediated regulatory network analysis, identifying some promising ffls and mutual feedback loops in schizophrenia. in the converged network, we identified  <dig> core genes including egr <dig> and hsa-mir- <dig> that likely play important regulatory roles. the network also includes some well-studied schizophrenia candidate genes . although this investigation started from experimentally verified schizophrenia-related mirnas, mirna-tf-gene regulations, and a set of schizophrenia candidate genes prioritized by multiple lines of genetic evidence, most of the mirna targets and tfbss used in this study are putative and not error-free. at present, mirnas have not been well tested for association with schizophrenia. the number of schizophrenia related mirnas is expected to be greater than what we compiled. however, our analysis and subsequent permutation tests indicated that our regulatory network is nonrandom in the whole molecular network. the identified network modules provide potential targets for follow-up experimental verification, and provide important insights into the etiology of schizophrenia. we discuss some potential pathways below.

egr <dig> encodes a zinc finger transcription factor and plays important roles in cellular growth, environmental stimuli, muscle-spindle development and neuronal development  <cit> . in neuronal development, egr <dig> is required for normal terminal axon extension and branching, sympathetic target tissue innervation and function, and hippocampus-dependent learning and memory processing  <cit> . egr <dig> indirectly modulates synaptic plasticity through its regulation of the arc gene, a synaptic activity-induced effector molecule  <cit> . in developing neurons and epilepsy, bdnf is the endogenous signal that induces egr <dig> expression via a pkc/mapk-dependent pathway, and then egr <dig> up-regulates the expression of gabra <dig> by binding its promoter  <cit> . egr <dig> is required in mediating the response to stress and novelty  <cit> . egr <dig> has been reported to be associated with schizophrenia in both case-control and family-based studies and its expression has been shown to be decreased in schizophrenia patients  <cit> . mice lacking egr <dig> and schizophrenia patients display a similar decreased susceptibility to the side effects of antipsychotic medications  <cit> . these studies consistently suggest an important role for egr <dig> in neuron activity and schizophrenia.

moreover, egr <dig> is a downstream gene of many signaling pathways including pathways triggered by ngf, bdnf and nrg <dig>  <cit> , of which bdnf and nrg <dig> are schizophrenia susceptibility genes. both egr <dig> and egr <dig> are induced by bdnf signaling in primary cortical neurons  <cit>  and egr <dig> has been proved to be a target gene of egr <dig>  <cit> . egr <dig> and egr <dig> directly regulate the expression of ngfr   <cit> , a receptor of all neurotrophins, including ngf and bdnf. interestingly, ngfr is involved in the regulation of axonal elongation  <cit>  and egr <dig> shares a similar function  <cit> . egr <dig> is regulated by the calcium-responsive protein phosphatase calcineurin  <cit> , which might be triggered by a calcium influx through nmdars  <cit> , whose activation also induces egr <dig> mrna expression  <cit> . ppp3cc  is located very close to egr <dig> on chromosome  <dig> and was reported to be associated with schizophrenia  <cit> . furthermore, the calcineurin/nfat signaling pathway is required for neuronal development and axon growth, but it has little or no effect in neuron survival  <cit> . interestingly, egr <dig> is also required for normal axon extension and branching, but not for neuron survival  <cit> . neurotrophins  stimulate nfat nuclear translocation and activation of nfat-dependent transcription in cortical neurons  <cit> . it has been proposed that some unknown factors involved in calcineurin/nfat signaling induce axon growth  <cit> . based on these literature surveys and our mirna-mediated regulatory network analysis, we propose that egrs, especially egr <dig>  are key factors regulated by calcineurin/nfat signaling in neuronal development. moreover, in the immune system, nfat directly transactivates egr <dig> and egr <dig>  then activates the expression of fasl to trigger cell apoptosis  <cit> .

the above discussion led us to propose a model of the involvement of egr <dig> and mirnas in signaling pathways and regulatory networks within nervous system and schizophrenia . we inferred that egr genes, especially egr <dig>  are downstream of bdnf, nrg <dig>  and ngf via two pathways: mapk-dependent signaling pathway and calcium-dependent calcineurin/nfat signaling pathway. egr <dig> expression is triggered by these two pathways after signal stimulation. then, egr <dig> activates its target protein-coding genes  and mirnas . these target genes subsequently trigger downstream genes and pathways, inducing processes such as synaptic plasticity, axon extension, gabaergic and regulating expression of bdnf and drd <dig> 

hsa-mir- <dig> might prove a promising mirna in schizophrenia and nervous system
hsa-mir- <dig> is a core mirna potentially targeted by  <dig> tfs and also targeting  <dig> szgenes in our network. it was reported significantly down-regulated in the prefrontal cortex of schizophrenia patients  <cit> . so far, it has been the only mirna whose regulation of schizophrenia genes has been verified by experimental evidence. it regulates bdnf, altering the expression of downstream gabaergic transcripts  in schizophrenia patients  <cit> . note that bdnf also affects gabaergic system as a mediator of egr3-induced gabra <dig> regulation in developing neurons  <cit> . in our mirna-mediated ffls, egr <dig> potentially regulates hsa-mir- <dig>  thus, hsa-mir- <dig>  bdnf and egr <dig> form a critical feedback regulatory loop . the predicted targets of hsa-mir- <dig> are enriched in neuron related pathways, such as axonal guidance signaling, reelin signaling in neurons, long term synaptic potentiation and ephrin receptor signaling pathways . in combination, the evidence above suggests that hsa-mir- <dig> might be a key mirna in schizophrenia as well as nervous system.

potential utilities of ffls and mirna-tf composite feedback loops
ffl is an important regulatory motif and has been found in organisms such as escherichia coli, yeast and human  <cit> . a traditional ffl is composed of two tfs and one target gene in gene expression regulation. because mirnas play key regulatory functions in gene expression, a ffl consisting of a tf, mirna and a target gene is likely a powerful tool to investigate regulatory mechanisms of diseases at both the transcriptional and translational levels. it has been estimated that there are several thousands of human genes under this combinatory tf-mirna regulation  <cit> . at present, only a few ffls have been experimentally verified. some examples include e2fs-myc-mir-17/ <dig>  <cit> , e2f-mir-106b/93/25-cdk inhibitors  <cit>  and pkc-mapk-mir-15a  <cit> . a mirna-tf composite feedback loop is a direct regulation motif. some experimental examples are zeb1/sip <dig> and the mir- <dig> family in embryologic development and pitx <dig> and mir-133b in neuron development  <cit> . in our mirna-mediated network in schizophrenia, we found an interesting mirna-tf loop, the mir181-esr <dig> loop. esr <dig> is the only tf in our network whose gene has positive association result for schizophrenia  <cit> . some snps in esr <dig> were also found significantly associated with schizophrenia in our genotyping project . additionally, inoue et al.  <cit>  suggested egr <dig> being a target of esr <dig> in breast cancer cells. since egr <dig> is a core gene in our mirna-mediated schizophrenia network, this provides another link for esr <dig> to schizophrenia.

CONCLUSIONS
we compiled schizophrenia related mirnas to predict szmirna-tf-szgene ffls and found significantly more szmirna-related ffls in schizophrenia candidate genes. this is the first study of mirna-tf regulatory networks in schizophrenia. we revealed that egr <dig> and hsa-mir- <dig> are critical in the schizophrenia regulatory network. egr <dig> is at the convergence of several signaling pathways, mirna regulatory networks, adaptation to stress, and genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia. although this study is exploratory, it provides an alternative and, perhaps, an effective approach for studying the regulatory mechanisms of genes involved in schizophrenia.
