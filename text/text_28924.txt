BACKGROUND
one of the most important and challenging tasks of post-genomic era is to improve the annotation of newly sequenced genomes in general and of parasite genomes in particular. the members of the phylum apicomplexa are important protozoan parasites that cause some of the deadly diseases in humans and animals  <cit> . they include parasites like plasmodium, toxoplasma, eimeria, neospora, cryptosporidium, babesia and theileria. apicomplexan genomics started with the completion of plasmodium falciparum genome sequence  <cit>  and no homology was detected for approximately 60% of its genes  <cit> . later, a number of apicomplexan parasite genomes were sequenced successfully followed by genome annotation projects which would help in understanding the biology of these parasites  <cit> . the amino acid substitution and composition in p. falciparum proteins were unusual and standard matrices  did not detect orthologs and/or gave poor alignment for many p. falciparum proteins  <cit> . in order to address this issue we developed an alternate option i.e. a novel series of substitution matrices  and demonstrated their superior performance over the standard matrices  for p. falciparum proteins in particular  <cit>  and for apicomplexan proteins in general  <cit> . we further demonstrated that the amino acid compositions of proteins of nine apicomplexan parasites  were similar to that of p. falciparum and because of this unusual amino acid composition of apicomplexan proteins these matrices  performed better even for other apicomplexan proteins   <cit> . moreover to provide access to this novel series of matrices to researchers working on apicomplexan parasites, a web server apicoalign  was developed to detect orthologs and align apicomplexan proteins  <cit> . in the present study, we assess the performance of these matrices with that of compositionally adjusted matrices  in terms of detection of the true and false positives, an important aspect missing in our earlier studies  <cit> . many protein families like kinases are under-represented in apicomplexan parasites probably because standard matrices  could not detect them during genome annotation. smat <dig> uniquely detected  completely or partially annotated ortholog proteins for  <dig> apicomplexan hypothetical proteins against swissprot database.

RESULTS
smat <dig> detected more true positives
in order to assess the performance of different matrices in terms of true and false positives, we used the method adopted by brick and co-workers  <cit>  . in general, smat <dig> performed best , followed by the compositionally-adjusted blosum <dig> , blosum <dig>  and blosum <dig> . in more detail, all roc <dig> curves in figure  <dig> are very alike in the initial regions and this is expected as all the examined matrices perform similarly when aligning highly similar proteins. in fact, the first part of the curves corresponds to hits with high bit scores and low e-values. however, in the latter region, roc <dig> curves diverge from each other. the number of false positive hits increases steeply for bl62adj  while the other matrices show a less dramatic increase and thus show better performance, particularly apicomplexan specific matrix smat <dig>  the overall positive predictive values  are  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % for smat <dig>  compositionally adjusted blosum62adj, blosum <dig> and blosum <dig> matrices respectively. therefore smat <dig> performs best for apicomplexan proteins followed by blosum62adj, blosum <dig> and blosum <dig> matrices.

smat <dig> gave poor scores for non-specific hits and better scores for specific hits
in our earlier studies  <cit>  and this study, we have demonstrated that smat <dig> gave better e-values and better bit scores for most of the apicomplexan proteins. next, we were interested to know whether parasite specific matrices would give poor e-values and/or bit scores for the proteins for which orthologs must not exist  in a particular family/class of apicomplexa. the phylum apicomplexa is divided into two major classes e.g. aconoidasida  and coccidia . the coccidians generate a thick walled oocyst stage that is excreted with faeces while in hematozoans  oocysts are not excreted but transmitted by mosquito or tick  <cit> i.e., the transmissible cyst stage of coccidians is environmentally durable outside the host  <cit> . because of this feature there are some proteins like oocysts wall proteins which are found exclusively in class coccidia but not in hematozoans  <cit> . sanderson and coworkers  <cit>  identified  <dig> proteins  isolated from purified oocysts of c. parvum using 2-d gel electrophoresis and mudpit analysis. this dataset of  <dig> proteins had six oocysts wall proteins . we analyzed the e-values and bit scores given by smat <dig> and blosum <dig> matrices for these six oocyst wall proteins against other apicomplexan species. we observed that the average bit scores given by smat <dig> were poor compared to blosum <dig> for these oocyst wall proteins against hematozoan parasites but better against cryptosporidia and toxoplasma gondii; and in fact these were quite high against cryptosporidia . since these proteins were from purified oocysts of c. parvum, we expected to find the true orthologs for them in other coccidian/cryptosporidia but not necessarily in hematozoans and that is why smat <dig> correctly gave poor average bit scores against hematozoans. one of the oocyst wall proteins cowp <dig>  gave blast hits against  <dig> apicomplexan species using smat <dig> and blosum <dig> matrices but the hits obtained using smat <dig> matrices had poor e-values compared to those obtained using blosum matrices. for example, blosum <dig> and smat <dig> detected a common best hit for cowp <dig>  in p. falciparum and that was pfc1045c. however, blosum <dig> and smat <dig> gave e-values of 3e- <dig> and  <dig>  respectively for the same pair . treeck and coworkers  <cit>  detected the same protein pfc1045c in parasite blood stages using mass spectrometry suggesting that it was not an oocyst protein. many a times against hematozoans , smat <dig> and blosum <dig> matrices detected two different hits for cowp <dig>  however, against other coccidians both matrices blosum <dig> and smat <dig> detected a single best hit  for cowp <dig> and those subject hits were chro. <dig> , cmu_ <dig> , eth_ <dig> , ncliv_ <dig>  and tgme49_ <dig>  at e-value threshold 1e- <dig> . it was expected because all the coccidians should have oocyst wall proteins but not aconoidasida. therefore in this case smat <dig> correctly gave poor e-values compared to blosum <dig> matrix. smat <dig> gave poor e-values  for other oocyst wall proteins too against members of class aconoidasida and these oocyst wall proteins were cowp <dig> , cowp <dig> , cowp <dig> , cowp <dig>  and cowp <dig>  . these examples prove that indeed smat <dig> matrix gives less false positives  as predicted by roc curves  thereby it has better specificity than that of blosum matrices.

genome-wise blast searches
the reciprocal genome-wise blast searches were carried out for all the proteins of  <dig> apicomplexan species using smat <dig>  blosum <dig> and blosum <dig> matrices against  <dig> bacterial species. the numbers of apicomplexan proteins giving hits using smat <dig> matrix against bacteria were more compared to that given by using blosum series of matrices . however, a large number of apicomplexan proteins did not give any blast hit with significant e-value against bacteria irrespective of the matrix used. next, the genome-wise blast searches were carried out for  <dig> apicomplexan species against one another using smat <dig>  blosum <dig> and blosum <dig> matrices. we estimated the number of proteins which gave blast hits against the subject genome at different e-value thresholds  . for example smat <dig>  blosum <dig> and blosum <dig> detected orthologs for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> proteins of toxoplasma gondii against theileria annulata respectively without any e-value cut-off and these numbers were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively with a stringent e-value cut-off  . in most cases smat <dig> detected more number of orthologs compared to blosum <dig> and blosum <dig> matrices. therefore we expect that the blast searches using smat <dig> matrix would improve the annotation of apicomplexan proteins particularly those for which blosum matrices do not detect any orthologs.

database searches
blast searches were carried out for all the proteins of  <dig> apicomplexan species using smat <dig>  blosum <dig> and blosum <dig> matrices against swissprot database. the identical hits  detected by smat <dig> and blosum <dig> matrices were compared in terms of e-values, bit scores and percent identities. these hits were classified into eight categories  and for each category, the percentage was calculated for all the  <dig> apicomplexan parasites and is shown as pie charts in figure  <dig>  in toxoplasma gondii, smat <dig> matrix  gave better or similar e-values, better or similar scores and better or similar % identities for  <dig> proteins while it gave poor e-values, poor scores and poor % identities for only  <dig> proteins. similarly, smat <dig> performed better for other apicomplexan species also . we compared the performance of smat <dig> matrix with that of blosum <dig> also and smat <dig> performed better .

blast searches against swissprot database were carried out for all the proteins  of  <dig> apicomplexan parasites. next, we estimated for how many proteins of the  <dig> apicomplexan species  all the three matrices were able to identify orthologs, any two matrices were able to identify orthologs and for how many proteins, only one matrix was able to identify orthologs. as we can observe in the various venn diagrams , all the three matrices identified orthologs for majority of the apicomplexan proteins however if we look at the numbers of orthologs uniquely identified by a single matrix, smat <dig> performs better in comparison to blosum <dig> & blosum <dig> matrices. for example in e. tenella, smat <dig>  blosum <dig> and blosum <dig> uniquely identified orthologs for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> proteins respectively. smat <dig> detected orthologs for more number of proteins of t. annulata, p. berghei, p. chabaudi, p. falciparum, p. knowlesi, p. vivax, p. yoelii yoelii, e. tenella, n. caninum and t. gondii. however in the case of babesia bovis, theileria parva, cryptosporidium hominis, cryptosporidium muris and cryptosporidium parvum blosum <dig> performs marginally better than smat <dig> . the data for plasmodium chabaudi, plasmodium knowlesi and cryptosporidium muris are not shown. therefore, the comparisons of smat <dig> with blosum <dig> and blosum <dig> clearly show that smat <dig> was able to identify orthologs for more number of apicomplexan proteins against swissprot database and with better e-values and better bit scores.

apicomplexan protein hits uniquely detected by smat80
blosum <dig>  is the most commonly used matrix for detecting orthologs. however we have shown that the choice of matrices can also significantly improve the ortholog detection in our previous  <cit>  and the present studies. smat <dig> uniquely detected orthologs for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> proteins of babesia bovis, theileria annulata, theileria parva, p. berghei, p. chabaudi, p. falciparum, p. knowlesi, p. vivax, p. yoelii yoelii, cryptosporidium hominis, cryptosporidium muris, cryptosporidium parvum, eimeria tenella, neospora caninum and toxoplasma gondii respectively . for these  <dig> apicomplexan proteins, blosum <dig> and blosum <dig> could not identify any ortholog against swissprot database and  <dig>  are labeled as hypothetical proteins in eupathdb version  <dig> , the list of these proteins and their subject hits along with % identity, e-value and score are provided in additional file  <dig>  the annotation of smat <dig> hits  for these apicomplexan proteins include  <dig> kinases,  <dig> phosphatases,  <dig> heat shock proteins,  <dig> proteases and several other proteins.

smat <dig> detected more apicomplexan kinases
the eukaryotic protein kinases  belong to a very extensive family of proteins which play crucial roles in most of the cellular pathways  <cit> ; therefore apicomplexan kinases represent potential drug targets  <cit> . ward and coworkers carried out exhaustive analysis of p. falciparum kinome and surprisingly found only  <dig> typical epks as saccharomyces cerevisiae genome is half the size of p. falciparum genome but encodes approximately twice number of epks  <cit> . we speculate perhaps the standard blosum matrices were not able to detect orthologs for many malarial protein kinases because of unusual amino acid composition  <cit>  of apicomplexan proteins. and in fact, a novel family  of protein kinases was reported  <cit>  and schneider and coworkers  <cit>  detected many other kinases of the same family and they  <cit>  considered it as apicomplexan-specific protein kinase family.

smat <dig> detected orthologs for  <dig> apicomplexan hypothetical proteins which did not give any hit against swissprot database using blosum series of matrices. the swissprot annotation of  <dig> subject hits  is protein kinase activity ; that means smat <dig> predicts these  <dig> apicomplexan proteins  as probable protein kinases. we carried out conserved domain search  at ncbi site for these  <dig> proteins but could find hits only for  <dig> proteins  and no kinase domain was detected. however when we aligned these proteins with an experimentally known p. falciparum protein kinase , source: plasmodb release  <dig> ) using pffsmat <dig> matrix  <cit> , the alignments were significantly lengthier  suggesting these proteins were probably protein kinases. py <dig> was one such apicomplexan hypothetical protein and its subject hit  was a serine/threonine protein kinase of dictyostelium discoideum . we further observed that the key residues of protein kinase catalytic domain  were conserved in py <dig>  the lysine in subdomain ii  plays a role in contacting α and β phosphates of atp, anchoring and orienting the atp; the glutamate of subdomain iii  forms a salt bridge with k73; aspartate  is the catalytic residue acting as a base receptor; the aspartate in the subdomain vii  binds to the mg2+  ion associated with the β and γ phosphates of atp; the glutamate in subdomain viii  forms a salt bond with the arginine in subdomain xi; and the aspartate in subdomain ix  is involved in structural stability of the catalytic loop of the subdomain vi through hydrogen bonding with the backbone  <cit> . in fact, all these functional residues for kinase activity were conserved in py <dig> except the glycine triad  in subdomain i and ward and coworkers  <cit>  too reported its absence in fikk-family. the pairwise alignment of py <dig> with fikk-family protein kinase of p. falciparum  shows the conservation of these functional residues in figure 5a. in addition to this, we have provided the list of apicomplexan hypothetical proteins whose subject annotations include 'kinase' after combining the blast hits of smat <dig>  blosum <dig> and blosum <dig> matrices  . we also calculated the gravy  values for these smat80-predicted kinases . out of these  <dig> smat80-predicted protein kinases, we found that eight kinases; py <dig> , py <dig> , py <dig> , py <dig> , py <dig> , py <dig> , eth_ <dig> , py <dig>  had positive values indicating their hydrophobic nature while the remaining  <dig> had negative values ranging from - <dig>   to - <dig>   indicating their hydrophilic nature. the serine/threonine protein kinase tsua  of d. discoideum  had a gravy value of - <dig>  which was negative suggesting a hydrophilic nature, as was the case with  <dig>  smat80-predicted kinases . we would also like to mention that the serine/threonine protein kinase tsua  of d. discoideum is a reviewed entry in swissprot database with a clear experimental evidence for the existence of protein. the kinase domain is at c-terminal in both mal7p <dig>  and py <dig> proteins that is why we have shown the alignment in c-terminal part  and hydrophobicity profile of this alignment showed approximately 70% matched positions in terms of hydrophobicity . the prediction of  <dig> apicomplexan probable kinases would be useful in understanding the apicomplexan kinomes as completion of the same for completely sequenced genomes is also one of the important goals of post-genomic era.

apicomplexan proteases missed by blosum but detected by smat80
several studies  <cit>  have suggested that proteases are important for invasion by apicomplexan parasites. wu and coworkers  <cit>  revealed hidden families of proteases in malaria parasite genome and completion of apicomplexan genomes provides a basis for identifying new proteases. the swissprot hits uniquely detected by smat <dig> for  <dig> apicomplexan hypothetical proteins  have protease annotation i.e. smat <dig> predicts these hypothetical proteins as proteases. the conserved domain search in batch mode at ncbi site was carried out for these  <dig> proteins but could find hits only for  <dig> proteins. pvx_ <dig>  gave hits for rhomboid superfamily of proteases  in this conserved domain search. the go terms for pvx_ <dig> of molecular function and cellular component were go: <dig>  and go: <dig>  respectively. therefore smat <dig> correctly predicted it to be protease and we conclude that it is a putative rhomboid protease. a complete list of apicomplexan hypothetical proteins whose subject hits  were probable or known proteases has been provided in additional file  <dig>  the gravy  values were calculated for these smat80-detected proteases . out of the  <dig> proteases, four proteases; tp01_ <dig> , eth_ <dig> , ta <dig>  and eth_ <dig>  had the positive gravy values indicating their hydrophobic nature while the remaining  <dig> probable proteases had negative values ranging from - <dig>   to - <dig>   indicating their hydrophilic nature . the rhomboid proteases are integral to membrane and we expect them to have positive gravy values or very low negative gravy values. six smat <dig> predicted proteases  with positive or very low negative gravy values have stronger possibility of being rhomboid proteases compared to others .

apicomplexan proteins features
in our previous study, we have shown that the amino acid compositions of proteins of nine apicomplexan species  were similar to that of p. falciparum proteins  <cit> . we carried out similar amino acid composition study  <cit>  for all the  <dig> apicomplexan genomes and observed that all the apicomplexan genomes are having unusual amino acid composition like that of p. falciparum  in comparison to mycobacterium tuberculosis proteins. as discussed earlier, smat <dig> uniquely detected orthologs for  <dig> apicomplexan hypothetical proteins and predicted  <dig> kinases and  <dig> proteases out of these hypothetical proteins. we compared the amino acid composition of these smat <dig> predicted kinases and proteases with that of yeast kinases and proteases respectively in terms of p-values . these apicomplexan proteins had very similar amino acid composition in terms of positively charged amino acids i.e. p-values were  <dig>  and  <dig>  for apicomplexan kinases and proteases respectively . smat80-predicted apicomplexan kinases and proteases differed significantly from yeast kinases and proteases respectively in terms of composition of non-polar and negatively charged amino acids  and we think that this is one of the reasons that blosum matrices could not detect orthologs for these proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
the available genomes of apicomplexan parasites have significant number of hypothetical proteins and improving the annotation of these proteins is one of the most important and challenging tasks of post-genomic era. we think one of the probable reasons for this was that the standard matrices  could not detect orthologs for many compositionally-biased apicomplexan proteins  <cit> . we were able to find orthologs for  <dig> such apicomplexan hypothetical proteins against swissprot database using smat <dig> matrix in the blast searches. the subject annotations of these  <dig> apicomplexan hypothetical proteins included  <dig> kinases,  <dig> phosphatases,  <dig> heat shock proteins,  <dig> proteases and several other important proteins therefore smat <dig> assigned some probable functions to these hypothetical proteins. the conserved domain search at ncbi site did not find any kinase domain in these  <dig> smat80-predicted kinases but found one rhomboid protease among the  <dig> smat80-predicted proteases. however further analysis of one of the predicted kinases  revealed that the key functional residues of kinase domain were conserved in this protein. similarly, one of the proteases  was integral to membrane and having serine-type endopeptidase activity and these two features are the characteristics of the rhomboid proteases. therefore smat <dig> correctly predicted it to be a protease and we conclude that it is a putative rhomboid protease. the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity in terms of gravy values was also calculated for these smat <dig> predicted apicomplexan kinases and proteases. these probable apicomplexan kinases and proteases had significantly different non-polar and negatively charged amino acids contents in comparison to yeast kinases and proteases respectively and we think this was one of the reasons that blosum matrices could not detect ortholog for these proteins. we also studied the performance of apicomplexan parasite-specific matrices in terms of roc curves, an important aspect missing in our earlier studies  <cit> . these roc curves indicated the higher specificity of smat <dig> matrix even against psi-blast searches using compositionally adjusted blosum <dig> matrix thereby signifying the role of these parasite-specific matrices in blast searches for apicomplexan proteins. and this higher specificity of smat <dig> matrix was studied in biological context also i.e. smat <dig> gave blast hits with very poor e-values and/or bit scores  for the experimentally identified coccidia specific oocyst wall proteins against hematozoan parasites which are supposed not to have oocyst wall proteins. we have provided the lists of apicomplexan hypothetical proteins to which smat <dig> could assign some function in the supplementary material. we hope that this data would be useful for the researchers working on apicomplexan parasites in general and particularly for those working on apicomplexan kinases and proteases.

materials and methods
datasets used
piroplasmadb version  <dig>   <cit>  data was used for b. bovis, t. annulata and t. parva, plasmodb release  <dig>   <cit>  data for p. berghei, p. chabaudi, p. falciparum, p. knowlesi, p. vivax and p. yoelii yoelii, toxodb release  <dig>   <cit>  data for e. tenella, n. caninum and t. gondii, cryptodb release  <dig>   <cit>  data for cryptosporidium hominis, c. muris and c. parvum, the whole protein datasets from ncbi ftp site were used for rest other organisms used in this study and swissprot/uniprot database was downloaded from ebi ftp site.

software/programs used
the pairwise alignments using blosum <dig> and pffsmat <dig> matrices were carried out using apicoalign web server  developed by us. the blastp program of standalone blast software was used for carrying out local blast searches  <cit>  . smat series of matrices were accepted by blastp program after some modifications in the source code  <cit> . the default gap open and extension penalties were used for blosum <dig> while for blosum <dig> and smat <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were gap open and extension penalties respectively . shell scripts were written using awk, sed and perl to find best bidirectional hits between two organisms, best non-self hits common to two matrices and for other small purposes. the two tailed p-values for amino acid fractions  were calculated using vassarstats , a website for statistical computation. r package  was used for various calculations and making graphs.

database searches
the blast searches  were carried out for all the proteins of  <dig> apicomplexan parasites using smat <dig>  blosum <dig> and blosum <dig> matrices against swissprot database. these hits were classified into eight categories  better or similar e-values, better or similar scores and better or similar % identity with smat <dig> compared to blosum <dig>   better or similar e-values, better or similar scores and poor % identity,  better or similar e-values, poor scores and better or similar % identity,  better or similar e-values, poor scores and poor % identity,  poor e-values, better or similar scores and better or similar % identity,  poor e-values, better or similar scores and poor % identity,  poor e-values, poor scores and better or similar % identity and  poor e-values, poor scores and poor % identity. only the best non-self hits were considered for calculating the percentage of proteins for each category for all the  <dig> apicomplexan parasites.

roc curves
a unique dataset of all p. berghei and p. yoelii proteins with an assigned gene ontology was constructed and all p. berghei vs. all p. yoelii blast searches were carried out using blosum <dig>  blosum <dig>  smat <dig> and compositionally adjusted  matrices. the standalone psi-blast searches were performed using blastpgp program of ncbi blast software with option -t  <dig> for compositionally adjusted blosum <dig> matrix. the blast hits  ranked by bit score were compared using go identifiers for each pair of the query and subject sequences. only those hits where the query and the subject proteins share gene ontologies were considered as true positives  and the remaining hits were considered as false positives . the numbers of false positives and true positives were used to make rocn curves and for every curve we calculated the area under curve . here, n was chosen to be  <dig> as this was the maximum number of false positives which were present in all searches .

calculation of hydropathy values
the average hydropathy values for smat80-detected apicomplexan protein kinases and proteases were calculated using "sequence manipulation suite" . it gives "protein gravy"  values for protein sequences. the gravy values are calculated by adding the hydropathy value for each amino acid and dividing it by the length of the sequence. the algorithm for calculating the values is based on the method developed by kyte and doolittle  <cit> . the grand average hydropathicity index for a protein indicates its solubility, with the positive gravy indicating hydrophobicity and negative gravy indicating hydrophilicity. the hydrophobicity profiles in figure 5b were constructed using alignme tool  <cit>  .

amino acid composition study of apicomplexan proteins
the amino acid compositions in terms of p-values for  <dig> apicomplexan parasites  were calculated using the same methodology described earlier by us  <cit> . the amino acids were used as four categories: non-polar, polar with no charge, positively charged and negatively charged amino acids . the protein sequences in fasta format for yeast kinases and proteases were downloaded from amigo version  <dig>   <cit> . the amino acid composition of  <dig> smat <dig> predicted apicomplexan kinases was compared with that of yeast kinases and similarly for  <dig> smat <dig> predicted apicomplexan proteases it was compared with that of yeast proteases.
