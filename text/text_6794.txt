BACKGROUND
in  <dig> allfrey and colleagues showed that the acetylation of histone h <dig> and h <dig> alleviated the repressive effect of the histones on in vitro rna synthesis in calf nuclei  <cit> . this initial report saw the birth of epigenetics and an appreciation that covalent modifications of histones provided a mechanism whereby dna function could be regulated. the nucleosomal packaging of dna in chromatin was subsequently shown to be an integral component in the regulatory mechanism of the transcription process  <cit> , involving atp-dependent remodeling complexes, reversible, chemical modification of core histone as well as histone isotype swapping. many transcriptional activators and repressors were further shown to be enzymes that were involved in the covalent modification of function-specific residues in the core histones, mostly located in the n- and c-terminal "tails" that extend from the central histone-fold domain  <cit> .

it is now known that these chemical modifications are crucial to the proper regulation of dna function. the absence of many of the proteins involved in post-translational histone modifications underlie many human diseases, including t-cell lymphoma, rubinstein-taybi syndrome, coffin-lowry syndrome and the autism spectrum disorders  <cit> . in addition, the proper regulation of histone modifying enzymes are required for normal muscle development, neuronal plasticity as well as memory functions  <cit> .

a general relationship between acetylation of the core histones and transcriptional activity, combined with chromatin decondensation, has been reported by many different groups  <cit> . we have previously shown that linker histone hho <dig> displayed a significant increase in chromatin binding in stationary phase in saccharomyces cerevisiae, which coincided with an increase in chromatin compaction  <cit> . gene expression and protein synthesis were significantly decreased in stationary phase in s. cerevisiae, allowing cells to survive for extended periods in this semi-quiescent state  <cit> . following re-feeding of the stationary phase yeast cells, the linker histone rapidly dissociated from chromatin, accompanied by a general increase in transcriptional activity as cells re-entered the cell cycle  <cit> . we were therefore interested in investigating the presence of acetyl groups on all the n-terminal tail lysine residues of h <dig> and h <dig> in stationary and in exponential phase in s. cerevisiae, to elucidate the role that acetylation may play in transcriptional shut-down and compaction of the chromatin fiber during semi-quiescence.

methods
strains and culture media
saccharomyces cerevisiae strain w303-1a  was grown in ypd medium  at 30°c with constant shaking to exponential phase  or to stationary phase . yeast cells were pelleted, spheroplasted with zymolyase, nuclei isolated, and core histones extracted as described  <cit> . the procedure was performed at 4°c in the presence of the hdac inhibitor sodium butyrate to minimize changes in the acetylation level of histones during isolation. histone integrity was verified by sds-page electrophoresis followed by staining with coomassie brilliant blue  <cit> .

in-gel digestion
a gel slice containing the coomassie-stained histone band of interest was excised and cut into small cubes . the gel pieces were shrunk with  <dig> μl acetonitrile . a  <dig> μl aliquot of  <dig> mm dithiothreitol in  <dig> mm nh4hco <dig>  was added to cover the gel pieces completely, and the sample incubated at 56°c for  <dig> min. the sample was cooled to room temperature,  <dig> μl of  <dig> mm iodoacetamide  in  <dig> mm nh4hco <dig> was added, and the sample incubated in the dark at room temperature for  <dig> min. following reductive alkylation, coomassie-stained gel pieces were destained for  <dig> min in  <dig> μl of  <dig> mm nh4hco3/acetonitrile  with occasional vortexing. the gel pieces were saturated with sequencing grade trypsin  , incubated on ice for  <dig> min, followed by overnight incubation at 37°c. peptides were extracted from the gel matrix in  <dig> μl of 5% v/v formic acid , 60% v/v acetonitrile at 30°c for  <dig> min with gentle shaking. the recovered supernatant was dried down in a rotary evaporator  and the peptides resuspended in  <dig> μl of 5% v/v formic acid for ms analysis.

mass spectrometric analysis
samples  were concentrated and desalted online on a  <dig> mm ×  <dig> μm zorbax 300sb-c <dig> trapping column  and the peptides separated on a  <dig> mm ×  <dig> μm zorbax 300sb-c <dig> column with  <dig>  μm particle size by nanoflow hplc . the following step-wise gradient profile was used at a flow-rate of  <dig>  μl/min:  <dig> min, 0% b;  <dig> min, 10% b;  <dig> min, 25% b;  <dig> min 50% b;  <dig> min, 90% b;  <dig> min 90% b. solvent a consisted of 1% v/v acetonitrile,  <dig> % v/v formic acid and solvent b consisted of 95% v/v acetonitrile,  <dig> % v/v formic acid. the separated peptides were analyzed on a  <dig> qtrap hybrid triple quadrupole mass spectrometer  fitted with a nano electrospray-ionisation interface, operated in "information dependent acquisition"  mode using analyst version  <dig>  software . a precursor ions scan between m/z 400- <dig> was performed as a survey scan for the ida method. peptide precursors that generated an m/z  <dig> fragment during collision induced dissociation  were identified, and peaks above  <dig> counts/s triggered the ida method to perform an enhanced resolution scan for charge state determination, followed by enhanced product ion  scan of the precursor at rolling collision energy settings.

protein identification and modification discovery by database search
the recorded ms/ms spectra were submitted to a local server running mascot version  <dig>   and searched against the swiss-prot  database. precursor and product ion tolerances were  <dig>  and  <dig>  da, respectively, appropriate for the accuracy of the  <dig> qtrap. acetylation of lysine was specified as a variable modification and up to two missed cleavages by trypsin were allowed.

western blots
core histones, isolated from exponential and stationary phase yeast cells, were resolved by sds-page, transferred to hybond-ecl membrane , and the immobilized proteins probed with polyclonal rabbit antibodies targeted at h <dig> k9ac, h <dig> k14ac, h <dig> k12ac and h <dig> k16ac . antibody binding was visualized with an ecl western blot kit  according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the image digitized with a pharos molecular imager .

RESULTS
we set out to identify the residues that were acetylated in core histones of saccharomyces cerevisiae in stationary and exponential phase to establish a possible role for histone acetylation during semi-quiescence. histone h <dig> was isolated from exponential phase s. cerevisiae cells, resolved by sds-page, the h <dig> containing gel slice excised, the histone digested with trypsin in the gel slice, and the resulting peptides eluted and subjected to ms analysis.

it was previously shown that the immonium ion of acetylated lysine often lost an ammonia molecule, resulting in the immonium ion sub-fragment with a mono-isotopic mass of  <dig>  da  <cit> . this immonium ion sub-fragment was previously used as a diagnostic ion to detect acetylated lysine residues in peptides during cid fragmentation  <cit> . this allowed unambiguous assignment of an acetylated lysine residue, since trimethylated lysine exhibits a similar mass shift in the fragmentation spectrum. we therefore performed precursor ion scans during elution to identify all peptides that generated an m/z  <dig> ion during cid fragmentation. these peptides were selected when present in a peak with a height exceeding a total ion count  of  <dig> counts/second, and a product ion scan of each recorded. all product ion scans were submitted to the mascot search engine, which matched the experimental ms/ms spectra against the generated theoretical spectra of all yeast proteins in the swiss-prot database.

of all the peptides generated by tryptic cleavage of h <dig> that generated peaks with a tic of at least  <dig> counts/second, only the peptide from position 9- <dig> produced a diagnostic ion at m/z  <dig>  indicating the presence of at least one acetylated lysine residue in the peptide. a di-acetylated h <dig> fragment was identified when performing a mascot search with the fragmentation spectrum of this peptide against the swiss-prot database. this assignment was supported by the precursor ion of m/z  <dig>  for 2+ , recorded by the enhanced resolution scan of the ion. this is within approximately  <dig>  da of the expected mass of the peptide glgkggakr with m/z  <dig>  for the + ion and  <dig>  da for each of the acetyl groups. this result provided very strong evidence that the peptide fragment from 9- <dig> of h <dig> was di-acetylated. since this fragment contains only two lysine residues, it is very likely that both k <dig> and k <dig> were acetylated. to confirm this assignment, the cid fragmentation spectrum was also considered. partial b- and y-ion fragmentation series could be identified . looking first at the y-ion series, the y <dig>  y <dig>  y <dig> and y <dig> fragments were visible. lysine  <dig> will thus correspond to the n-terminal residue in the y <dig> fragment. the mass difference between the y <dig> and y <dig> fragment was  <dig>  da . this was within  <dig>  da of the mass of an acetylated lysine residue, which is equal to  <dig>  da plus  <dig>  da. this result demonstrated that lysine  <dig> of h <dig> was acetylated in exponential phase s. cerevisiae cells.

looking next at the b-ion series , the b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> ions could be identified. k <dig> would be the c-terminal residue in the b <dig> fragment. since the b <dig> fragment was not observed, possibly due to the lower proton affinity of this fragment, it was not possible to directly calculate the mass of the c-terminal residue in b <dig>  however, the difference in mass of the b <dig>  and b <dig>  fragments was  <dig>  da. the mass of the di-peptide ak with the lysine acetylated is  <dig> , within  <dig>  da of the observed mass. this provided very strong evidence that the second acetyl group was present on k <dig> of the h <dig> fragment.

to investigate the acetylation state of histone h <dig> in semi-quiescent s. cerevisiae, we isolated h <dig> from  <dig> day stationary phase yeast cells, performed a tryptic digest of the sample resolved on an sds-page gel, and analyzed the eluted peptide fragments by ms. since a precursor ion scan for a diagnostic ion was used, a peptide fragment that was acetylated should still be detected, even if additional post-translational modifications that could influence the chromatographic elution property of the peptide were present in stationary phase.

we could not detect the diagnostic ion at m/z  <dig> during a precursor ion scan in any of the peptides generated by tryptic cleavage of h <dig>  this result suggested that h <dig> was either not acetylated in yeast in stationary phase, or acetylated at a significantly reduced level, below our selected detection cut-off of  <dig> counts/second. however, since ion-suppression in different samples may influence the generation of the immonium ion sub-fragment, we also studied the fragmentation spectra of the peptides .

a precursor peak at m/z  <dig>  was visible for the 9glgkggakr <dig> peptide from stationary phase h <dig> . the mass at which this peak resolved was consistent  with the unmodified, doubly charged peptide glgkggakr. looking next at the ms/ms spectrum, partial b-ion and y-ion series were visible . the mass difference between y <dig> and y <dig>  where k <dig> is present as the n-terminal residue, was  <dig>  da , within  <dig>  da of the mono-isotopic mass of unmodified lysine. lysine  <dig> is the c-terminal residue of the b <dig> ion. the mass difference between b <dig> and b <dig> was  <dig>  da, also within  <dig>  da of the mass of an unacetylated lysine residue. this result demonstrated that, in contrast to exponential phase, both lysine  <dig> and  <dig> of histone h <dig> were not acetylated or acetylated at significantly reduced levels in stationary phase. this reduced level of histone acetylation was not due to the action of deacetylases during the histone isolation procedure, since we included the deacetylase inhibitor butyrate, and histones isolated from exponential phase using the identical procedure displayed high levels of acetylation, consistent with inactive deacetylases.

we next asked whether the acetylation state of histone h <dig> also differed between exponential and stationary phase in yeast. histone h <dig> was isolated from exponential and stationary phase yeast cells, resolved by sds-page, the histone gel band excised, and digested with trypsin. the digest was analyzed by ms as described above using a precursor ion scan in an ida method. we detected two acetylated peptides in histone h <dig> isolated from exponential phase, based on the presence of the m/z  <dig> fragment ion. a mascot search of the swiss-prot database with the ms/ms spectrum identified the first peptide as 9kstggkapr <dig> of h <dig>  in its un-acetylated form this peptide has a predicted mass of  <dig>  da in its doubly charged state. the enhanced resolution scan of this peptide exhibited a mass of  <dig>  for 2+ , a difference of  <dig> da, consistent with the presence of two acetyl groups on this peptide. looking at the fragmentation spectrum  partial y-ion and b-ion series were visible. it was not possible to directly view the n-terminal lysine residue, since the b <dig> ion resolved below the m/z scan range. however, the y <dig> ion was detected at m/z  <dig> . thus the mass difference between the full peptide  and the y <dig> ion was  <dig>  da, which was most consistent with a single acetylated lysine residue. since neither the y <dig> or b <dig> ions were observed in the fragmentation spectrum, it was not possible to directly calculate the mass of k <dig>  however, the mass predicted for the y <dig> ion of the kstggkapr peptide was  <dig>  da . the y <dig> ion was observed at m/z  <dig> . thus, the n-terminal residue of the y <dig> fragment had a mass of  <dig>  da, consistent with an acetylated lysine residue. furthermore, the mass difference between the observed b <dig> and predicted b <dig> ions was  <dig>  da, again consistent with an acetylated lysine residue. we therefore conclude that both k <dig> and k <dig> were acetylated in histone h <dig> in exponential phase yeast cells.

the list of product ions observed , matched with mascot to the swiss-prot database , or predicted following cid fragmentation is shown.

to investigate whether these residues were also acetylated in stationary phase, histone h <dig> was isolated from  <dig> day stationary phase cells and analyzed as above. we could not detect the m/z  <dig> ion fragment in the precursor-ion scan of the tryptic digest for peptides present at a level above our ida cut-off of  <dig> counts/second. we therefore performed an enhanced ms scan to identify the kstggkapr peptide. an m/z  <dig>  peak was identified , within  <dig>  da of the mass that was expected for the doubly charged peptide. searching the fragmentation spectrum of the peptide that eluted in this peak against the swiss-prot database with mascot, indeed identified the un-acetylated kstggkapr peptide as the best match. looking at the fragmentation spectrum of this peptide  partial b-ion and y-ion series were visible. again, the b <dig> ion, containing the n-terminal k <dig>  was below the m/z range of the scan . the mass difference between the full-length + peptide  and the y <dig> ion  was  <dig>  da , within  <dig>  da of the mass of an un-acetylated lysine residue. looking next at k <dig>  a b <dig>  and a b <dig>  fragment were observed, the latter having lost a water molecule. thus, the observed mass of k <dig> was  <dig>  da, within  <dig>  da of the mass of an un-acetylated lysine residue. this result clearly indicated that both k <dig> and k <dig> were un-acetylated or acetylated at low levels in histone h <dig> isolated from stationary phase yeast cells.

apart from the 9kstggkapr <dig> h <dig> peptide, the precursor ion scan of the tryptic digest of h <dig> isolated from exponential phase also identified an m/z  <dig> da diagnostic ion in a m/z  <dig>  peptide . a mascot search of the swiss-prot database with the fragmentation spectrum of this peptide identified the sequence sapstggvkkphr, located at sequence position 28- <dig> of yeast h <dig>  the predicted mass of this peptide was  <dig>  da ,  <dig> da less than the observed mass of  <dig>  da . this  <dig> da mass difference is consistent with the presence of a single acetyl group in the peptide, which may be located on either k <dig> or k <dig>  in the fragmentation spectrum  the b <dig> ion, containing k <dig> as the c-terminal residue, was observed at m/z  <dig>  da ,. the predicted mass of b <dig>  which contained residues that are not acetylatable, was  <dig>  da . thus, the difference between b <dig> and the observed b <dig> fragment was  <dig>  da, which is within  <dig>  da of an acetylated lysine residue. thus, the single acetyl group detected in the fragment was present on k <dig> of h <dig>  k <dig> was not detectably acetylated.

the list of product ions observed , matched with mascot to the swiss-prot database , or predicted following cid fragmentation is shown.

we also identified the partially overlapping 27ksapstggvk <dig> peptide at m/z  <dig>  in the precursor ion scan on the tryptic digest of histone h <dig> isolated from stationary phase yeast cells  using a mascot search of the swiss-prot database. this fragment was never observed in conjunction with the m/z  <dig> fragment ion. however, the predicted mass for the doubly charged peptide was  <dig>  da. thus, in its singly charged state, the peak identified as ksapstggvk was approximately  <dig> da heavier than predicted. nevertheless, the y-ion series, of which 70% of the fragmentation products were matched by mascot, and 40% of the products observed, gave mass differences corresponding to the expected sequence . the entire y-ion series, intriguingly, was shifted by  <dig>  da, suggesting that the y <dig> lysine was modified by an adduct of this mass . a search of the unimod database of post-translational protein modifications  <cit>  for any modification within  <dig> da of this mass, revealed a single entry, acrolein. it is a highly nucleophilic aldehyde that is a product of lipid metabolism, but also forms with thermal decomposition of acrylamide, and was previously shown to form adducts by michael addition with the ε-amino group of lysine and with cysteine residues  <cit> . however, acrolein has a molecular mass of  <dig> da, suggesting that two acrolein adducts formed per lysine residue in the peptide above. beretta and colleagues previously showed that two such adducts indeed formed on the single lysine residue of the ghk tri-peptide  <cit> .

the list of product ions observed , matched with mascot to the swiss-prot database , or predicted following cid fragmentation is shown.

since it is unlikely that trypsin would have cleaved a peptide c-terminal to such a modification, we suggest that the di-acroleination of the c-terminal lysine of ksapstggvk occurred during electrophoresis in the polyacrylamide gel, where acrolein may have been present. we therefore propose that this modification did not occur in vivo. importantly, we found no evidence for acetylation of this lysine residue , unlike the equivalent residue of h <dig> in exponential phase.

to confirm our results and obtain semi-quantitative data on the acetylation levels in exponential and stationary phases, we also performed a western analysis, using antibodies individually directed at acetylated lysine residues k <dig> and k <dig> in h <dig>  as well as k <dig> and k <dig> in h <dig>  histones h <dig> and h <dig> isolated from stationary phase yeast cells were acetylated to levels approximately  <dig> to  <dig>  fold lower than that of histones isolated from exponential phase cells .

discussion
we have shown above that there was a striking difference in the acetylation level of k <dig>  k <dig> and k <dig> of histone h <dig> and k <dig> and k <dig> of histone h <dig> in exponential phase compared to stationary phase in s. cerevisiae. the presence of acetylated lysine residues was determined by a precursor ion scan to detect an m/z  <dig> fragment ion, representing the acetylated lysine immonium ion that had lost an ammonia molecule  <cit> . hits were verified by a mascot search of the tandem ms/ms spectra against the swiss-prot database, allowing acetylation as a variable modification, as well as by the presence of mass-shifts compatible with an nε-acetyl lysine residue in the y-ion and b-ion fragmentation series. this approach allows a rigorous assessment of the presence of histone acetylation in s. cerevisiae cells in exponential and in stationary phase, and can discriminate between the approximately isobaric acetylated and tri-methylated lysine residue.

the acetylation state of the histones are regulated by a balance between acetylation and deactylation activities that are catalyzed by a diverse group of kats and hdacs, respectively . the target specificity of all kats and hdac, which typically form the catalytic sub-unit in multi-component protein complexes, are not yet elucidated, and the precise biological function of acetylation of each of the different lysine residues is also not yet understood. there appears to be a global, background acetylation level that is established by "untargeted" kats and hdacs, which was proposed to repress basal transcription and also permit the turn-over of acetylation modifications to allow the shutdown of genes were expression were no longer required  <cit> .

sas <dig> 
the enzymes responsible for the acetylation and deacetylation of the indicated lysine residues are shown  <cit> .

the acetylation of k <dig>  k <dig> and k <dig> of h <dig> appeared functionally redundant, and only associated with the abolition of the positive charge of lysine. little difference was seen between the genome-wide transcriptional response of a yeast strain that contained h <dig> that was mono-acetylated at any of k <dig>  k <dig> or k <dig>  furthermore, the effect of acetylation of these residues appeared cumulative, where any of the three di-acetylated combinations had similar, but more pronounced, effects on transcription compared to the mono-acetylated state  <cit> . in contrast, acetylation of k <dig> of h <dig> had specific effects on transcription that were independent of the acetylation state of k <dig>  k <dig> or k <dig>  <cit> . support for a special, mechanistic role for h4k <dig> acetylation was also provided by a genome-wide analysis that showed that k <dig> of h <dig> in nucleosomes close to transcription start sites were maintained in a hypo-acetylated state, independent of the transcriptional activity of the gene  <cit> . in contrast, k <dig> and k <dig> of h <dig>  as well as k <dig> and k <dig> of h <dig> in nucleosomes located close to transcription start sites, became hyper-acetylated with increase in transcriptional activity  <cit> . thus, k <dig> of h <dig> appeared less connected with transcriptional regulation than k <dig> and k <dig> of h <dig> and k <dig> and k <dig> of h <dig> 

hansen and co-workers demonstrated that increased acetylation of histones h2b, h <dig> and h <dig> decreased the ability of a reconstituted nucleosome fiber to condense in vitro  <cit> . in a subsequent, more targeted study, it was shown that in vitro reconstituted oligo-nucleosomes that were fully acetylated at the single k <dig> of h <dig> did not condense to the same extent as corresponding un-acetylated fragments  <cit> . however, both these studies were performed in the absence of linker histone h <dig>  which is required for the formation of a fully condensed  <dig> nm chromatin fiber  <cit> . rhodes and co-workers demonstrated that acetylation of k <dig> of h <dig> to a 30% maximal level was sufficient to decondense a 61-mer nucleosomal fiber folded in the presence of a linker histone  <cit> . deletion of the h <dig> tail was also shown to diminish compaction of a reconstituted h1-containing fiber in vitro  <cit> , a result similar to that reported for a fiber in the absence of h <dig>  <cit> . it was further shown that the region spanning residues 14- <dig> of h <dig>  encompassing k <dig>  was essential from chromatin compaction in the absence of h <dig>  <cit> , and, presumably, also in its presence. there is thus an extensive literature that shows that the n-terminal tail of histone h <dig> was necessary for chromatin compaction, and that acetylation of k <dig> abolished this compaction.

it was previously shown in s. cerevisiae that linker histone hho <dig> preferentially bound to chromatin in stationary phase cells, and that this association was a requirement for the formation of condensed chromatin, compared to the decondensed state in exponential phase cells  <cit> . we therefore propose that the unacetylated state of k <dig> of h <dig> reflects a requirement for the absence of this modification to allow the formation of fully condensed chromatin in stationary phase. the presence of acetylated h4k <dig> in exponential phase is thus likely a reflection of the uncondensed state of the chromatin in active cycling cells, as opposed to the transcriptional status of the genome. a direct correspondence between acetylation level of h3k <dig>  h3k <dig> and h4k <dig> and gene expression was previously shown  <cit> . the acetylation of k <dig>  k <dig> and k <dig> of histone h <dig> and k <dig> of histone h <dig> that was observed in exponential phase and the decreased level of acetylation found in stationary phase was therefore most likely modifications that were directly associated with the transcription process.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that residues k <dig>  k <dig> and k <dig> of histone h <dig> and k <dig> and k <dig> of histone h <dig> were acetylated at significantly reduced levels in stationary phase compared to exponential phase in yeast. this was shown by both lc/ms/ms and by immuno-blotting in the case of k <dig>  and k <dig> of histone h <dig> and k <dig> and k <dig> of histone h <dig>  the positive correlation in the data generated by these two techniques confirmed the utility of using the m/z  <dig> fragmentation ion as diagnostic of an nε-acetylated lysine residue, allowing unambiguous identification of this modification. the decrease in lysine acetylation in stationary phase most likely reflected the transcriptional shutdown that was previously noted in the semi-quiescent state in yeast  <cit> . interestingly, it was previously shown that k <dig> of h <dig> was more closely linked to chromatin compaction  <cit>  as opposed to transcriptional activity  <cit> . we have also previously shown that linker histone hho <dig> preferentially bound to chromatin in stationary phase, and was required for chromatin compaction  <cit> . we therefore suggest that the observed loss of the acetyl group from k <dig> of h <dig> is a prerequisite to the full compaction of chromatin in stationary phase.
