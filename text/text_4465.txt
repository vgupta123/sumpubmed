BACKGROUND
osmoregulation is an important topic in fish physiology. bony fishes maintain their body fluid osmolality approximately one-third that of seawater  and therefore they constantly lose water and gain ions in sw but gain water and lose ions in fresh water . osmoregulation consumes a high proportion of daily energy expenditure in teleosts as they either actively excrete excess ions in sw or take up ions in fw against the respective concentration gradients  <cit> . the gills, kidney, and intestine are major osmoregulatory organs and play different roles to maintain body fluid homeostasis in both fw and sw  <cit> . sw teleosts drink copiously and the gastrointestinal tract is responsible for water absorption to compensate for the water loss by osmosis  <cit> . although the intestine is an internal organ, its lumen directly contacts environmental water upon drinking in teleost fishes. osmosensing in fish is accomplished by a combination of sensors in the central nervous system and peripheral osmoregulatory epithelia such as gill, nasal cavity, and intestine  <cit> . a reflex inhibition in drinking was demonstrated in eel intestine in response to cl- ions  in ingested fluid, indicating the presence of a cl- specific sensor in eel intestine  <cit> .

euryhaline fishes that are able to acclimate in both fw and sw transform their intestines dramatically to fulfill the appropriate osmoregulatory roles. when the eel is transferred from fw to sw, the intestinal wall decreases in thickness, and the anterior intestine became highly vascularized through angiogenesis within 1– <dig> days  <cit> . monovalent ions  in the imbibed sw are actively absorbed while divalent ions  are precipitated to decrease luminal fluid osmolality  <cit> . the composition of epithelial transporters is also reorganized extensively. an upregulation of mucosal na-k-2cl cotranspoter  remarkably increases the ion absorption rate, which is facilitated by the serosal na-k-atpase and na+-bicarbonate exchanger  <cit> . the rapid and efficient ion absorption mechanism in teleost intestine is unique in vertebrates  <cit> . the sw teleost intestine is an absorptive epithelium that is similar to the thick ascending loop of henle in mammalian nephron, and thus was often used as a comparative model for the study of kidney tubules, especially in the study of transporter mechanisms and cellular regulation in response to volume and salt stresses  <cit> . several hormones such as cortisol, prolactin, growth hormone, atrial natriuretic peptide, arginine vasotocin, guanylin, and vasoactive intestinal peptide regulate transepithelial ion transport . however, the transcription factors that govern hormone actions, cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, transporter metabolism etc., are unclear.

transcriptomic approaches have been used to investigate the dynamics osmoregulatory organ function of teleosts . however, microarray- or pyrosequencing-based transcriptomic reads do not provide sufficient depth and coverage for the detection and quantitation of low expression genes, which may result in a biased discovery towards high expression genes. in the present study, the objective was to discover the transcription factors that are responsive to the sw challenge in medaka intestine. illumina hiseq sequencing was selected to provide a deep coverage of identified genes as the large number of reads allows quantification of gene expression by mapping to reference genome, and is usually sufficient to detect most expressed gene even at low expression level  <cit> , which is an ideal choice at a cost-performance perspective. medaka was used owing to the relative completeness of the genome data, which can streamline the rna-seq analysis and guarantee high accuracy and reliability. medaka is also a euryhaline species that can survive a direct fw to 50% sw  transfer  <cit> . we combined physiological and bioinformatic approaches in the experimental design, in which fw medaka was challenged by 50% sw transfer and time-dependent changes in intestinal transcriptome were analyzed by rna-seq. we focused on the early upregulated transcription factors that could initiate subsequent intestinal transformations and lead to altered function from fw to sw.

RESULTS
illumina sequencing and reference gene mapping
illumina 101 bp paired end sequencing were performed on all  <dig> intestine samples collected from medaka after 0 h, 1 h, 3 h, 1d, and  <dig> d after sw transfer  the sequenced reads ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  million reads with average  <dig>  million reads in each sample . the read were mapped against the annotated genome of medaka. more than 83% of the sequences were successfully mapped sequences, indicating the data sets are representative.table  <dig>

go terms enriched in the 1 h-after-sw transfer group are listed in table  <dig>  according to biological process, protein phosphorylation, regulation of dna-dependent transcription, cell adhesion, and signal transduction were highly ranked in go enrichment. according to molecular function, protein binding, protein tyrosine kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, and actin binding were enriched. according to cellular component, significant enrichment in go terms was found in integrin complex and cytoskeleton.table  <dig>

transiently upregulated genes
the intestinal transcription-related genes that are involved in the sw acclimation were screened from the genes with early transient increase in expression, which is defined as genes with significant increases in gene expression  in 1 h and/or 3 h post-transfer groups compared to those of 0 h, 1d, and 7d. the candidates genes were further filtered to remove low expression genes . genes with significant correlation  in expression with a known osmotic transcription factor  among the early transient increase genes were selected for further analysis . the selected genes were further filtered by go annotation to obtain transcription-related genes and  <dig> genes were further analyzed by real-time pcr.

real-time pcr
to confirm the adequacy of the sw transfer stimulus on the medaka intestine, slc12a1/nkcc <dig> and aqp <dig> were used as reference genes since these transporters are well-acknowledged to change in teleost intestine after sw challenges . the real-time pcr results of slc12a <dig> and aqp <dig> showed a gradual increase and decrease in gene expression at 1d and 7d post-transfer respectively, which strongly mirrored the rna-seq results . fw control transfer did not induce significant changes in gene expressions.figure  <dig>

the same set of cdna was subsequently used for validation of transcription factors and 19/ <dig> of the transiently upregulated genes were reproducible . among the genes in which transient upregulation was confirmed by quantitative pcr, 14/ <dig> were found to be stress-related since similar increases were observed after fw-fw transfer, including tsc22d <dig> and sgk <dig> . however,  <dig> novel transcription factors, cebpb, cebpd, rad54l <dig>  hif3a, and ldb <dig>  were discovered to respond specifically to sw challenges, and thus used for further analyses.figure  <dig>

string analysis and protein interaction network assembly
using the string analysis, protein interaction networks of hyperosmotic-related  and stress-related  transcription factors were constructed by overlapping the common interacting protein partners. stress-related transcription factors such as sgk <dig>  tsc22d <dig>  nr0b <dig>  and ddit <dig> interact with the ubc-, tp53-, and rela-related networks . hyperosmotic-specific transcription factors such as cebpb and cebpd affect a similar protein network including ubc and rela . ep <dig>  crebbp, and atxn <dig> were only found in salinity-specific network, and these could have specific roles on transforming the intestine from fw- to sw-types.figure  <dig>

discussion
go enrichment
as the focus of the present study is on the early transcription factors that may signal the transformation of intestinal functions, go comparison was performed between pre-transfer  and 1 h sw transfer groups. the results indicated that the intestine transcriptome responded rapidly to the change in environment salinity and the go terms enriched were highly relevant to the contemporary understanding of the transformation events occurred in fish intestine when entering sw  <cit> . go annotations including signal transduction, regulation of transcription, protein phosphorylation, regulation of gene expression were all markedly enriched, indicating neuron- or hormone-mediated signals were commanding the structural and functional changes. for cellular function, actin binding, and cell adhesion enhancement may indicate that the cells adaptively respond to the cellular dehydration by adjusting the membrane permeability and cytoplasmic osmolytes to increase survival. markers of cell cycle arrest were enriched and suggested an increase in apoptosis and recruitment of new cells to proliferate in sw. glucose metabolic process and atp-binding enrichment indicated a high energy turnover following adrenergic response to cope with the abrupt transfer stress, and to provide energy for cell homeostasis. augmentation in peptide receptor and kinase activities indicated a role of endocrine stimulation in the transformation including the various changes in ion transporter expressions. the enrichment in integrin complex and cytoskeleton also indicates stress responses at both membrane and cytoplasm levels, which could be related to cellular dehydration consequent to imbibition of sw. altogether, these changes are expected during transformation of intestinal functions from fw- to sw-types, which include apoptosis of old cells and recruitment of new cells, reorganization of transporters for ion/water absorption, and changes in para-cellular permeability.

validation of seawater treatment effects
in order to validate the accuracy and reproducibility of current transcriptome analyses, genes that are known to change consistently after sw transfer were compared between transcriptome and real-time pcr data. the nkcc <dig> expression increased while aqp <dig> expression decreased similarly in both analyses , indicating high reliability of the current analyses. the results confirmed the reproducibility of the sw transfer effects and thus allow the extrapolation of the data sets for the discovery of novel genes related to sw acclimation. the increased nkcc <dig> gene expression was consistent with the increased ion absorption in sw teleost intestine  <cit> . however, the decreased aqp <dig> expression in medaka intestine after sw transfer was puzzling since sw acclimation up-regulated aqp <dig> expression in the eel intestine but down-regulated that in seabream . the down-regulation of aqp <dig> in medaka intestine could be similar to that of seabream, but the physiological implication of this species-specific difference is not clear because a high demand for water absorption by the intestine of sw teleost is expected. a search for expression pattern of other aqp members in the transcriptome data was performed but all known aqps in medaka did not increase their expression levels in sw , thus ruling out the possibility that some other aqp members may have replaced the function of aqp <dig> in medaka intestine. the species-specific difference in aqp <dig> expression may also indicate that the various intestinal ion transporting mechanisms could be present in different teleost lineages.

novel transcription factors for osmoregulation
cebpb and cebpd are important transcriptional activators in the immune and inflammatory responses via cytokines such as interleukin  <dig>  <cit> . high salt intake increased the transcription of angiotensinogen by decreasing the methylation around the cebp binding sites at the promoter region  <cit> , thus cebp may contribute to the control of the renin-angiotensin system at the transcriptional level. multiple cebp binding sites are present on the promoter region of nkcc <dig> in mice  <cit> . cebp binding sites in the promoter region control the gene expression of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator  in human under basal and camp-stimulated transcription states  <cit> . in addition, the protein interaction network identified in this study indicates possible involvement of a camp-related pathway, represented by crebbp, in the initial signaling in sw intestine transformation. therefore, cebp binding sites at the promoter regions of ion transporters will be of high interest in the future studies.

rad54l <dig> is a dna helicase that modulates androgen receptor-dependent transactivation in a promoter-dependent manner. the osmoregulatory function of this helicase is unknown and it is possibly one of the glucocorticoid receptor regulatory elements in fish, which facilitate or mediate the mineralocorticoid actions of cortisol. hif3a is known to be involved in the adaptive response to hypoxia and interacts with a number of stress-related proteins including hsp <dig>  the sw challenge may have increased energy consumption for reorganization of cellular components, which led to cellular hypoxia. ldb <dig> was recently regarded as a master gene for the control of red blood cell development  <cit> . the possible role of ldb <dig> could be as a regulator of klf <dig>  which in turn modulates the expressions of water channel aqp <dig> and cell adhesion molecule cd <dig>  <cit> . therefore, ldb <dig> could regulate expression of transporters and act as an upstream controller for cell adhesion and cytoskeleton as indicated in the go analysis.

besides the  <dig> salinity-specific transcription factors discovered in this study, atxn <dig>  ep <dig>  and crebbp, which are independent of the stress-related interacting proteins, were also singled out from the protein interaction networks . the functional role of atxn <dig> in mammals is not clear but our results suggest that atxn <dig> directly interacts with salinity-specific transcription factors ldb <dig> and rad54l <dig>  which could be a novel regulatory factor under salt stress. crebbp is an important mediator in the camp signaling. in fact, the camp pathway was shown to be involved in the osmoregulatory sensing and functions in teleosts . ep <dig> is a tumor-related transcription factor that is involved in restraining cell growth and division. ep <dig> also mediates camp-gene regulation by specific binding to phosphorylated crebbp and acts as a co-activator of hif1a in mammals  <cit> . it is possible that the ep <dig> in fish may interact with hif3a as suggested by out protein interaction network.

stress-related transcription factors
previous studies have demonstrated that tsc22d <dig> and serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase  are osmotic stress regulators in the gill of several fish models including killifish, medaka, eel, and tilapia . in medaka intestine, however, we found that their upregulation soon after sw transfer is partly due to handling stress as shown by the real time pcr results in fw control transfer . the discrepancy could be due to the difference in tissues  but we noticed that previous studies were lacking proper time-dependent control transfer, and where the salinity effects were concluded by the comparison between pre-transfer and post-transfer groups  <cit> . another possibility is that some of these stress-related transcription factors are also involved in the regulation of ion transport, amelioration of cellular stress such as dna damage, and mobilization of energy via adrenergic stimulation. in fish opercular epithelium, α- and β-adrenergic stimulation can inhibit and stimulate ion transport via ca2+/ip <dig> and camp signaling pathways respectively  <cit> .

the overlapping of stress- and salinity-related transcription factor interaction networks infers an intimate relationship between general emergency responses and osmoregulation . in fact, the effects of handling stress on the perturbation of hydromineral balance and osmoregulatory functions in fish were documented  <cit> . during an emergency, as induced by handling, fish inevitably increase their ventilation rate to obtain sufficient oxygen to meet the energy demand. however, the increase in ventilation also elevates ion and water fluxes, disrupting the equilibrium of ion absorption/excretion  <cit> . activity or expression of na-k-atpase and na-k-2cl co-transporter changed in accordance to the changes of plasma osmolality induced by handling stress  <cit> . stress undoubtedly increases metabolic demand, and it was argued that the metabolic performance of fish is limited by osmoregulatory cost  <cit> . in the light of these findings, some of the stress-related transcription factors could also be related to the perturbation of hydromineral balance.

previous studies demonstrated a role of sgk <dig> in salinity acclimation via controlling the activities of ion transporters in fish  <cit> . sgk <dig> expression is ubiquitous and upregulated by a large number of stimuli including hyperosmotic or isotonic cell shrinkage, excessive glucose concentration, mechanical stress, metabolic acidosis, oxidative stress, heat shock, and dna damage  <cit> . leptin was shown to promote glucose mobilization during sw transfer in tilapia  <cit> , indicating a hormone-driven hyperglycemia under a hyperosmotic challenge. therefore, it is possible that emergency responses, such as an increase in plasma glucose, may lead to an artefactual increase in sgk <dig> expression. sgk <dig> is a powerful modulator for gene expression and phosphorylation of a large number of ion transporters such as na-k-atpase, nkcc <dig>  and cftr  <cit> . in addition, sgk <dig> is highly expressed in tumor cells and it phosphorylates ep <dig> to acetylate nf-kb  <cit>  and is downregulated by ubiquitination via nedd4- <dig>  <cit> . our protein interaction network  also suggested a wide spread interactions of sgk <dig> with other transcription factors, in particular with tsc22d <dig>  tsc22d <dig> was firstly suggested to be acting as a osmotic-stress transcription factor  <dig>   <cit>  as the expression was upregulated by hyperosmotic challenge and the protein is localized in ionocytes of the teleost gills  <cit> . however, recent studies suggested a wide spectrum of tsc22d <dig> functions in developmental regulation, reproduction, inflammation, and tumor suppression  <cit> , and it may play a major role as a glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper. both sgk <dig> and tsc22d <dig> are mediators of glucocorticoids and thus their roles in osmoregulation could be related to the release of cortisol, which acts as the mineralocorticoid as well as the glucocorticoid in teleosts  <cit> . therefore, their functions may not be directly specific to osmotic stimulus but rather related to the pathway dependent stimulation.

other stress-related genes such as ddit <dig> and txnip are negative regulators to cellular stress and were stimulated by glucose increment  <cit> . nr0b <dig>  also known as small heterodimer partner, is an orphan nuclear receptor that represses transcription and interacts with ep <dig>  <cit> . klf <dig> is also a transcription repressor that binds to basic-transcription element  <cit> . from the individual gene function to the interaction network, these stress-related transcription factors play vital roles in cell survival and emergency preparation, which is important under both general and osmotic stresses.

CONCLUSIONS
our work for the first time investigated quantitatively the transcriptome of fish intestine in response to sw transfer in a time-course manner. this bottom-up approach has allowed the discovery of novel transcription factors involved in the osmoregulatory response to sw challenge. results of go analysis showed that the transcriptome analysis revealed representative changes and the data sets are valuable for discovering novel genes involved in salinity acclimation in fish. the protein interaction networks of the salinity- and stress-related genes indicate overlapping of the transcription factors between emergency and sw acclimation . the newly-discovered salinity-related transcription factors provide important directions on the studies in osmoregulation and its regulation in fishes.figure  <dig> 
graphical summary of the key findings. the early transiently-upregulated transcription factors can be categorized into two groups: general stress vs osmotic stress. among these transcription factors, some are common to the two groups and could be important in glucocorticoid-mediating functions.
