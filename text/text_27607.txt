BACKGROUND
serine proteases are ubiquitous enzymes in almost all organisms, from bacteria to mammals  <cit> , and they are known to play significant roles in a wide range of biological processes . besides their crucial physiological roles, proteases carry out an unlimited number of hydrolytic reactions to break down proteins  <cit> , and such proteolytic activity can be potentially hazardous in living systems. consequently, protease activity must be strictly and precisely controlled . there are several distinct mechanisms for the regulation of excessive activity of proteases. the most effective and direct mechanism is to inactivate proteases by protease inhibitors  <cit> . serine protease inhibitors  have been widely studied with documented roles in digestion, metamorphosis and development, as well as in immune responses . spis can be divided into three distinct types: serpins, canonical ﻿﻿inhibitors﻿, and non-canonical inhibitors, based on their mechanisms of action  <cit> . interaction between a serpin and its target protease is similar to substrate binding, and cleavage of a single peptide bond in the binding loop results in conformational change of serpin . the canonical inhibitors bind to the enzymes by an exposed convex binding loop, docking to the active site of the proteases that leads to inactivation of proteases  <cit> . the non-canonical inhibitors interact with target proteases through their n-terminal segments, which are secondary interactions outside the active site to significantly enhance the affinity, velocity and specificity of recognition  <cit> .

serpins are found in nearly all organisms, and are a superfamily of proteins with three β-sheets and seven to nine α-helices folding into a conserved tertiary structure with a reactive center loop   <cit> . the rcl is located in the carboxyl terminus, and exposed at the surface of a serpin, acting as a ‘bait’ for target proteases  <cit> . after proteases cleave the rcl at the scissile bond, serpins undergo conformational change, resulting in inactivation of target proteases  <cit> . previous studies have illustrated that most serpins are inhibitors of serine proteases  <cit> , while some serpins become inhibitors of caspases  <cit>  and papain-like cysteine proteases  <cit> . meanwhile, some other serpins are non-inhibitors, achieving a number of other biological tasks, such as tumor suppressors, hormone transporters and molecular chaperones .

in contrast to serpins, canonical inhibitors are the largest group of protein inhibitors and they are usually small proteins with 14 ~  <dig> amino acids   <cit> . canonical inhibitors can be classified into different families based on sequence homology, position of active center and disulfide bond, including kazal, kunitz and antistasin families  <cit> . alpha-2-macroglobulin  is a large protein belonging to the thiol ester superfamily  <cit> , which is known for its ability to inhibit a broad spectrum of proteases, including serine proteases, papain, aspartic proteases and metalloproteases  <cit> . the inhibitory mechanism of α2m is to physically enfold target proteases by a macromolecular cage, forming a complex of α2m-protease to prevent protease from accessing protein substrates  <cit> .

whole-genome investigations on the serpin family have been carried out in a number of insect species, including anopheles gambiae and aedes aegypti   <cit> ,  <dig> drosophila species   <cit> , apis mellifera   <cit> , tribolium castaneum   <cit> , and bombyx mori   <cit> . seven manduca sexta  serpins have been characterized through biochemical studies . previous studies reveal that most serpins function as serine protease inhibitors and play significant roles in regulation of innate immunity by controlling proteolytic pathways. the genome-wide analysis of canonical inhibitors has been performed in b. mori  <cit> , and some individual canonical inhibitors have been characterized in other insect species. for example, two kunitz-type inhibitors from the hemolymph of m. sexta functioned as inhibitors of serine proteases, including trypsin, chymotrypsin and plasmin  <cit> . a kazal-type inhibitor in the midgut of rhodnius prolixus  may be involved in the interaction between microbiota and trypanosoma cruzi  <cit> ; two non-classical kazal-type serine proteinase inhibitors  were identified in phlebotomus papatasi , and ppkzl <dig> has been described as an active serine proteinase inhibitor that is possibly involved in regulating digestive enzymes in the midgut  <cit> . however, only three p. xylostella spis  have been reported. by proteomic profiling and cloning, it has been shown that the expression of p. xylostella serpin  <dig> gene was reduced to 50% of the control during early parasitism   <cit> ; and its expression was also significantly affected by destruxin a   <cit> . knockdown of serpins  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> by rnai can induce expression of cecropins, increase phenoloxidase  activity and body melanization in larvae, as well as mortality of p. xylostella larvae  <cit> .

in this study, p. xylostella spis were identified and characterized based on the p. xylostella genome  <cit> . our findings provide a foundation for further studies on the biological functions of spis in p. xylostella, which may be used in the development of genomic strategies for pest management.

serpins
in this study,  <dig> serpins were identified in p. xylostella and named pxspi1-pxspi <dig>  this number is fewer than  <dig> serpins in b. mori  <cit> ,  <dig> in t. castaneum  <cit>  and  <dig> in d. melanogaster  <cit> , but greater than  <dig> serpins in a. gambiae  <cit>  and seven in a. mellifera  <cit> . the  <dig> serpin genes were spread across  <dig> different scaffolds . of the  <dig> serpins,  <dig> were grouped in five clusters, forming three 2-gene clusters on scaffold  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and two 4-gene clusters on scaffold  <dig> and  <dig> . eleven of the  <dig> serpins were predicted to be secreted proteins based on the putative secretion signal peptides;  <dig> lacked putative signal peptides and were predicted to be intracellular proteins; whereas two  were incomplete at the amino-terminus, one  was incomplete at the carboxyl terminus .fig.  <dig> scaffold localization of the serpin genes in p. xylostella. gene names and the distance of two adjacent genes  are shown on the right and left of the bar, respectively. scaffold numbers are indicated on the top of each bar




serpins are metastable proteins that experience conformational changes as they inhibit proteases  <cit> . several structural regions  are necessary for conformational changes of serpins. the hinge is an essential region where the peptide chain bends to permit rcl insertion, and the breach and shutter regions must open to allow rcl insertion  <cit> . a region known as the gate, which participates in a structural transition  during rcl insertion, occurs in the absence of rcl cleavage  <cit> . to investigate the important structural regions of p. xylostella serpins, we aligned p. xylostella serpins with known inhibitory serpins from m. sexta , d. melanogaster  and a. gambiae . the result revealed that most residues in these structural regions  in known inhibitory serpins, were conserved in most p. xylostella serpins . the alignment also showed that most residues in the hinge region in the known inhibitory serpins were conserved in most p. xylostella serpins, except for pxspi <dig>  pxspi <dig>  pxspi <dig>  pxspi <dig> and pxspi <dig>  . it has been documented that serpins may inhibit trypsin-like enzymes with either an arg  or lys  residue at the p <dig> position, inhibit chymotrypsin-like enzymes with p <dig> residue of phe , tyr , leu  or ile , and inhibit elastase-like enzymes with p <dig> residue of ala  or val   <cit> . meanwhile, prediction of the proteolytic cleavage site of serpins showed that pxspi1- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> had an r or k residue at the p <dig> position, indicating that they may inhibit trypsin-like enzymes, whereas pxspi <dig> and pxspi <dig> containing leu  at the p <dig> position may inhibit chymotrypsin-like enzymes, and pxspi <dig> with ala at the p <dig> position may inhibit elastase-like enzymes .fig.  <dig> multiple sequence alignment of the hinge and reactive center loop regions of p. xylostella serpins. the hinge and rcl regions of p. xylostella serpins were aligned with those of serpins with known functions from d. melanogaster , m. sexta  and a. gambiae  by clustalx  <dig>  program with default parameters. predicted p <dig> residues are highlighted in red. p. xylostella serpins are presented in numerical order and grouped with homologous serpins from other species as determined by phylogenetic analysis 




phylogenetic analysis of p. xylostella serpins with those from two other lepidoptera species , two diptera species , a coleopteran species  and a hymenoptera species  showed that p. xylostella serpins were divided into six distinct phylogenetic groups . although distributed to different branches, p. xylostella serpins clustered with those of two lepidoptera species , indicating that the serpin family is highly conserved in lepidoptera. however, p. xylostella serpins were not grouped with silkworm-specific serpins originally defined as group f that are arisen from recent gene duplications  <cit> . except for silkworm-specific serpins, p. xylostella serpins were clustered with m. sexta serpins and the remaining b. mori serpins. for example, five p. xylostella serpins were clustered with two m. sexta and three b. mori serpins in group a. pxspi <dig> was clustered with mssrpn1j and bmspi <dig>  pxspi <dig> and pxspi <dig> were clustered with bmspi <dig> and mssrpn <dig>  and so were pxspi <dig> and pxspi <dig> with bmspi <dig>  it has been shown that mssrpn1j  is an inhibitor of prophenoloxidase  activating protease  <dig>  in m. sexta  <cit> . multiple sequence alignments of pxspi <dig>  mssrpn1j and bmspi <dig> showed that the three serpins had a high level of sequence identity  and shared the identical amino acid residues at p <dig> position and hinge region , suggesting that pxspi <dig> may function as an inhibitor of pap in p. xylostella propo activation system. in m. sexta, mssrpn <dig> has been reported as an intracellular serpin, and its expression increases dramatically after larvae are injected with bacteria  <cit> . pxspi <dig> lacked putative secretion signal peptide and was predicted to be an intracellular protein.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationship of serpins from p. xylostella and six other insect species. the phylogenetic tree was constructed using mega  <dig>  with neighbor joining approach on the basis of poisson model and pairwise deletion of gaps. the bootstrap scores higher than  <dig>  are indicated on the nodes. p. xylostella serpins clustered to six distinct phylogenetic groups . the first two letters in each of the serpins represent the acronym of scientific name for a given species 




group b consisted of m. sexta, b. mori and a. mellifera serpin <dig>  tcsrpn <dig>  dmspn27a, a. gambiae serpin1- <dig>  previous studies indicated that mssrpn <dig> and dmspn27a play major roles in regulation of propo and spätzle activation  <cit> , and recombinant agsrpn <dig> and agsrpn <dig> can function as inhibitors of pap <dig>  <cit> . sequence alignment showed that pxspi <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  bmspi <dig>  mssrpn3a, mssrpn3b, dmspn27a, along with agsrpn <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> shared  <dig> % sequence identity and the conserved hinge regions as well as lys  at their p <dig> positions  except for pxspi <dig> and agsrpn <dig>  therefore, we assume that pxspi <dig> and  <dig> might have similar regulatory functions in propo and spätzle activation in p. xylostella. in group c, eight p. xylostella serpins clustered with m. sexta and b. mori serpins that were originally defined as group c  <cit> . the alignment showed that residues at the p <dig> and p1’ positions  and hinge region in pxspi <dig>  bmspi <dig>  mssrpn4a and mssrpn4b were identical  and sequence identity among the four serpins is  <dig> %. pxspi <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  bmspi <dig>  mssrpn5a and mssrpn5b also shared a high sequence identity  with the predicted p1-p1’  residues . in m. sexta, mssrpn <dig> and mssrpn <dig> can regulate propo activation by inhibiting the target proteases upstream of paps  <cit> . in b. mori, bmspi <dig> functions as an inhibitor to form covalent complexes with either bmsp <dig> or bmhp <dig> in both the propo activation and amp-producing pathways  <cit> . therefore, we suggest that pxspi <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> may be involved in regulating propo activation by inhibiting the target proteases upstream of paps. additionally, pxspi <dig> was clustered with bmspi <dig>  pxspi <dig> was clustered with bmspi <dig>  and pxspi <dig> was clustered with bmspi <dig> and bmspi <dig>  however, the functions of these serpins are unclear. pxspi <dig>  mssrpn <dig> and bmspi <dig> shared  <dig> % sequence identity and relatively conserved hinge region, and the residues at the p <dig> and p1’ positions in pxspi <dig> were arg and ile, identical to those in mssrpn <dig> .

group d was composed of  <dig> serpins from p. xylostella, b. mori, m. sexta, d. melanogaster, a. gambiae, t. castaneum and a. mellifera. pxspi <dig> was homologue to bmspi <dig>  mssrpn <dig>  agsrpn <dig>  dmspn88ea and dmspn88eb, and they shared  <dig> % sequence identity and the strictly conserved hinge region with identical arg and ser residues at p <dig> and p1’ positions . previous studies suggest that mssrpn <dig> and mssrpn <dig> with arg  at the p <dig> position are likely involved in regulation of propo activation in plasma by inhibiting paps  <cit> . therefore, we assume that pxspi <dig> and pxspi <dig> may also function as inhibitors of the melanization cascade. group e contained pxsrpn <dig>  dmspn28dc, bmspi <dig>  amsrpn <dig>  tcsrpn <dig>  tcsrpn <dig> and a. gambiae serpin 4– <dig> and  <dig>  a. gambiae serpin 4– <dig> and  <dig> have been reported as mosquito-specific expansions  <cit> , and biochemical analysis indicated that agsrpn <dig> is an inhibitor of trypsin-like serine proteases  <cit> . in group f, pxspi <dig> was grouped with bmspi <dig>  tcsrpn <dig> and agsrpn <dig>  pxspi <dig> was clustered with bmspi <dig>  agsrpn <dig>  tcsrpn <dig> and dmspn85f. in d. melanogaster, dmspn85f functions as a non-inhibitory serpin, and it is highly conserved in all the  <dig> sequenced drosophilid genomes  <cit> . a. gambiae srpn <dig> and srpn <dig> also have been predicted as non-inhibitor serpins  <cit> . furthermore, pxspi <dig> and pxspi <dig> had the least conserved residues in the hinge region , supporting a prediction that they may not function as inhibitors.

canonical spis
a total of  <dig> spis genes were identified as canonical spis and were divided into seven different families , kunitz, kazal, amfpi, pacifastin, antistasin and whey acidic protein ; additional file 1: table s1). seven of the eight spi families found in b. mori  <cit>  were identified in p. xylostella, except for bowman-birk family. sequence alignments showed that the numbers and positions of cys residues in the same family were highly conserved in p. xylostella canonical spis . for instance, three pairs of disulfide bonds were identified in the kunitz, kazal, pacifastin and antistasin families, followed by four pairs in wap, five pairs in til, and six pairs in amfpi .

domain architecture analysis suggests that  <dig> out of the  <dig> canonical inhibitors were single-domain proteins, while the remaining  <dig> spis encompassed multiple domains . proteolytic cleavage sites of p. xylostella canonical spis were investigated using sequence alignment with known spis. the p <dig> residue in the cleavage site determines the specific inhibitory activity of spis, with arg or lys in the p <dig> site indicating the inhibitory activity to trypsin-like enzymes, ala, val or gly showing the inhibitory activity to elastase-like enzymes, and phe, tyr or leu suggesting the inhibitory activity to chymotrypsin-like enzymes  <cit> . furthermore, it has also been reported that a thr residue at the p <dig> position of the fpi-f scissile bond has inhibitory activity to subtilisin and some fungal serine proteases  <cit> . the alignments indicated that pxspi <dig>  had a leu residue at the p <dig> position, suggesting that it may be involved in inhibiting chymotrypsin-like enzymes; pxspi <dig>  had a val residue at the p <dig> site with predicted inhibitory activity against elastase-like enzymes; pxspi <dig>  and pxspi <dig>  had an arg/lys  at the predicted p <dig> position, suggesting they may interact with trypsin-like enzymes .

in addition to single-domain inhibitors,  <dig> canonical pxspis contained two or more inhibitor domains . other than pxspi <dig> , the other  <dig> pxspis contained  <dig> or fewer inhibitor domains . previous studies show that spis containing multiple inhibitor domains have various residues at the p <dig> positions, suggesting that they are likely to have different inhibitory activities  <cit> . we found that pxspi <dig> consisted of two til domains, with ala and lys residues at the p <dig> site of the first and second domains, respectively. pxspi <dig> comprised two kunitz domains, with arg and phe residues at the p <dig> site of the first and second domains, respectively. pxspi <dig> contained four kazal domians, with ala residue at the p <dig> site of the first domain, and arg residues at the p <dig> sites of the second, third and four domains. pxspi <dig> and pxspi <dig> contained three kazal domains, with phe, arg and lys residues at the p <dig> site of the first, second and third domains, respectively. pxspi <dig> contained two kazal domains, with lys and arg residues at the p <dig> site of the first and second domains, respectively. pxspi <dig> consisted of four pacifastin domains, with arg residue at the p <dig> site of the first and second domains, and leu residue at the p <dig> site of the third and fourth domains. thus, pxspi <dig> may have inhibitory activity to trypsin-like enzymes, pxspi <dig> and pxspi <dig> may have inhibitory activity against elastase-like and trypsin-like enzymes, pxspi <dig>  pxspi <dig>  pxspi <dig> and pxspi <dig> may have inhibitory activity to both trypsin-like and chymotrypsin-like enzymes.

in addition, four spis, pxspi <dig>  pxspi <dig>  pxspi <dig> and pxspi <dig>  comprised both inhibitor and non-inhibitor domains . for instance, pxspi <dig> and pxspi <dig> were composed of one kunitz domain, one reeling domain, one spond_n domain and four thrombospondin type  <dig> ﻿ ﻿ domains, similar to the structure of b. mori bmspi <dig>  <cit> . pxspi <dig> had various types of domains, including kunitz, wap, tsp_ <dig>  immunoglobulin c- <dig> type , adam_spacer <dig> and plac  domains. moreover, pxspi <dig> contained three inhibitor domains  and two non-inhibitor domains  and worm-specific repeat type  <dig> ).fig.  <dig> domain organization of four p. xylostella spis in the kunitz family. the sizes of domains are indicated by the scale




alpha-2-macroglobulins
in our study, three α2m genes were identified in the p. xylostella genome . to clarify the conserved and diverged residues of p. xylostella α2ms, amino acid sequences of α2ms were aligned and compared with other known α2m sequences using clustal x and genedoc . the results showed that pxspi <dig> and pxspi <dig> were composed of three functional domains required for the α2m mechanism, including a bait region, a thiol ester domain, and a receptor-binding domain, whereas pxspi <dig> lacked the receptor-binding domain. the amino acid residues in the thiol ester domain in p. xylostella α2ms were gcgeqnm, which are identical to those of α2ms in other species. the region around the thiol ester domain of p. xylostella α2ms showed similarity to the corresponding region in other α2ms. nevertheless, the similarity of the bait region between α2ms of p. xylostella and other species was low as previously reported . a completely conserved sequence of fpetw in the bait region of α2ms in other species was replaced with fqeaw in pxspi <dig> and pxspi <dig>  and with fpeaw in pxspi <dig>  the alignment also showed that the receptor binding regions of pxspi <dig> and pxspi <dig> shared high similarity with those of other α2ms, and a consensus sequence of ggxxxtqdt was found in all the aligned sequences with ggmtntqdt sequence in pxspi <dig> and pxspi <dig>  additionally, two amino acid blocks   in the n-terminus were conserved in all the aligned sequences, suggesting that these blocks may have an important functional or structural role. a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed with the amino acid sequences of α2ms, complement proteins and thioester-containing proteins  using mega software  , and the tree contained three main distinct branches, including α2ms, teps and complement proteins. p. xylostella α2ms were clustered with insect α2ms, and they apparently are a monophyletic group.

expression profiling of p. xylostella spis
stage-specific expression pattern
using rna-seq data, expression patterns of pxspis at different developmental stages of the insecticide-susceptible strain , including egg, larva, pupa and adult, were characterized . the results showed that pxspis exhibited gene-differential, stage- and sex-specific patterns. for example, pxspi <dig> and pxspi <dig> were expressed at high levels exclusively in the larval stage. sixteen pxspis  were expressed at moderate or high levels in eggs, pupae and adults, but were undetectable or at very low levels in the larval stage. seven pxspis  displayed sex-specific patterns and were exclusively expressed at high levels in adults, with pxspi <dig> highly expressed in females and the other six genes highly expressed in males. pxspi <dig> and pxspi <dig> were expressed predominantly in egg, larval and pupal stages, rather than in the adult stage. five spis  showed moderate transcript levels in larvae and adult males, and no expression was detected in eggs, pupae and adult females. the stage-specific expression patterns of  <dig> genes  was confirmed by qpcr and the results were consistent with the rna-seq data.fig.  <dig> expression profiling of pxspis at different developmental stages. the log <dig> rpkm values are colored, where red represents higher expression, green represents lower expression, and gray represents the rpkm values missed. e, eggs; l1-l <dig>  1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th-instar larvae; p, pupae; am, adult males; af, adult females




tissue-specific expression pattern
rna-seq analysis showed that  <dig> of the  <dig> pxspi genes exhibited expression in at least one tissue . the midgut of 4th-instar larvae had fewer number  of genes expressed among the four tissues, while the numbers of genes expressed in the heads of 4th-instar larvae, adult males and females were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. pxspis had inverse tissue distribution tendency when compared with pxsps and pxsphs   <cit> . such a tendency was also documented in b. mori  <cit> . five pxspis, including  <dig> serpins  and three kazals , were expressed in the 4th-instar larval midguts and heads, while  <dig> pxspis were all highly expressed in the heads of adult males and females. thirteen pxspis  were expressed at a higher level in the heads of both larvae and adults than in the midgut of the 4th-instar larvae.

discussion
in the current study, we performed an overall analysis of spi genes in p. xylostella, including analysis of their sequences, scaffold location, phylogeny, and expression profiles. a total of  <dig> spi genes were identified in the p. xylostella genome, which were divided into nine different families based on the sequence similarity in amino acids. the number of spi genes in p. xylostella is less than that in b. mori   <cit> . this may result from fewer serpin  and til genes  identified in p. xylostella, compared to  <dig> annotated serpin and  <dig> til genes in the b. mori genome. in b. mori, eight silkworm-specific serpins and  <dig> genes of the til family have been found to come from tandem repeat evolution, and they may play important roles in protecting silk or protecting the cocoon from complicated environment conditions  <cit> .

serpins are a superfamily of proteins with a number of functions, such as regulation of innate immunity, acting as tumor suppressors, hormone transports and molecular chaperones . a total of  <dig> p. xylostella serpins were identified, with each containing three β sheets and seven to nine α helices , suggesting the overall folding of serpins remain largely unchanged in the long history of evolution  <cit> . mature p. xylostella serpin proteins were found to contain 379 ~  <dig> aa with theoretical molecular masses of 41–55 kda , consistent with previously documented sizes of serpins  with molecular masses of 40–60 kda  <cit> . moreover, we predict that the  <dig> p. xylostella serpins  might be inhibitory serpins based on the conserved residues in the hinge region that can serve as a theoretical guideline to identify inhibitory serpins  <cit> . based on the results of sequence alignments and predicted proteolytic cleavage sites, we would suggest that  <dig> of the  <dig> p. xylostella serpins  function as protease inhibitors. phylogenetic analysis further confirmed that  <dig> putative p. xylostella inhibitory serpins were clustered with the known inhibitory serpins in other insect species . nine of  <dig> putative p. xylostella inhibitory serpins  were clustered with the orthologues in m. sexta  with a high sequence identity. these m. sexta serpins have been demonstrated to participate in regulating the prophenoloxidase activation cascade  <cit> . therefore, we propose that nine p. xylostella serpins may play vital roles in regulation of innate immunity in p. xylostella. pxspi <dig> and pxspi <dig> lack the characteristic features of inhibitory serpins, however, they were found to be highly expressed in pupae and adult males, respectively. some serpins do not function as inhibitors, and others do inhibit proteases even though the conserved features are missing  <cit> . it is worth testing the biological roles of pxspi <dig> and pxspi <dig> by genetic and biochemical studies.

apart from the serpin family, the current work identified  <dig> spis belonging to canonical spis that contained rich cysteine residues to form disulfide bonds to keep their rigid structure. the rigid structure are necessary for keeping right conformation to interact with the active site of serine proteases  <cit> . and  <dig> of the  <dig> canonical inhibitors were single-domain proteins with low molecular weights, exemplified by pxspi <dig> that contained an amfpi domain with a low molecular weight . a blast search of genbank™ revealed that pxspi <dig> was similar in amino acid sequence to the small cationic peptide  in the hemolymph of m. sexta larvae, bmspi <dig> , and a fungal protease inhibitor- <dig> of antheraes mylitta . mscp <dig> has a lys residue at the p <dig> position, however, it shows no inhibitory activity against serine proteases  <cit> . amfpi- <dig> shows inhibitory activity against some fungal serine proteases and trypsin  <cit> , while bmspi <dig> has a predicted p <dig> residue of lys and may have inhibitory activity to trypsin-like enzymes  <cit> . therefore, the exact function of pxspi <dig> needs to be further studied. the remaining canonical pxspis contained two or more inhibitor domains, forming multi-domain compound inhibitors. the results were fully in consistent with those of previous work, in which the single inhibitor domain can be repeated 2– <dig> times to form multi-domain compound inhibitors in some spi families  <cit> . for instance, pxspi <dig>  pxspi <dig> and pxspi <dig> have  <dig> til,  <dig> kazal, and  <dig> pacifastin domains, respectively. in addition, some compound inhibitors contained inhibitor domains  and non-inhibitor domains, which are defined as mixed-type inhibitors, exemplified by pxspi <dig>  pxspi <dig> and pxspi <dig>  pxspi <dig> and pxspi <dig> were homologous to bmspi <dig> and f-spondin. f-spondin is an extracellular matrix protein that inhibits the outgrowth of embryonic motor axons in a contact-repulsion fashion  <cit> . bmspi <dig> might play an important role in the innate immune system of b. mori  <cit> . blast search revealed that pxspi <dig> was similar to bmspi <dig> and papilin, which has a broad expression spectrum in different pericellular matrices in drosophila embryos and is indispensable for embryonic development  <cit> .

gene expression profiles showed that pxspi <dig> and pxspi <dig> were expressed at high levels exclusively in the larval stage. their expression patterns are extremely parallel to those of  <dig> serine protease genes previously found in p. xylostella  <cit> . additionally, expression patters of seven pxspis  are consistent with those of  <dig> serine protease genes highly and exclusively expressed in adult males and one highly expressed in adult females of p. xylostella  <cit> , indicating that these pxspis may participate in regulation of the activity of serine proteases in adults. their functions still need to be validated by molecular studies.

CONCLUSIONS
it is by far the most comprehensive research on whole-genome identification and expression profiling of spis in p. xylostella. we explored the sequences and possible physiological functions of p. xylostella serpins and canonical spis, revealing that nine p. xylostella serpins may have inhibitory activity and be involved in regulation of the immune system of an important agricultural pest, and some canonical spis may have inhibitory activity to trypsin/chymotrypsin/elastase-like enzymes. however, additional biochemical and biological studies are required to determine and validate their functions. analyses of sequences, substrate specificity and domain architecture of alpha-2-macroglobulins will also be useful for further molecular genetic studies in p. xylostella. this article provides an overview of the p. xylostella spis, and will facilitate future functional investigation.
