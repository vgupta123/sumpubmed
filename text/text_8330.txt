BACKGROUND
mycobacterium bovis infection is the cause of bovine tuberculosis , an important health problem in cattle that also has zoonotic potential for transmission to humans. the eradication of m. bovis infection in cattle is proving difficult in some developed countries, including the uk and ireland  <cit>  due to limitations in the sensitivity of current diagnostics, leading to a failure to detect all infected animals  <cit> . it is also unclear what role exposure to environmental mycobacterial antigens play in the generation of non-specific immune responses, giving rise to difficulties with test interpretation and reliability. furthermore, some cattle with advanced disease become anergic, with suppressed cellular immune responses in both the peripheral blood and at the site of the infection  <cit> , and remain undetected as reservoirs of disease.

the immune response to tuberculosis is a complex process and studies in the bovine model have primarily focused on the adaptive response. the outcome of tuberculosis infection depends on t cell interaction with macrophages  <cit> , and progression of infection with m. bovis is thought to develop after a shift in the immune system from a protective proinflammatory, cytotoxic t cell response towards a non-protective antibody-mediated response  <cit> . the timing and potency of the cellular and immunological events that occur immediately post-infection are crucial determinants governing infection  <cit>  and innate immune responses are considered important for the generation of early, and appropriate adaptive responses to resolve infection  <cit> . therefore, central to the development of improved or novel diagnostics is increased understanding of the early immune response to tuberculosis in cattle.

at the most basic level, the interplay between the host and pathogen involves changes in gene expression  <cit> . high-throughput genomics technologies, which offer the ability to survey changes in expression for a large number of genes simultaneously, have been widely used to discern patterns of host gene regulation during infection. microarray technology has emerged as the method of choice for large-scale gene expression studies that have increased our understanding of host-pathogen interactions  <cit> . these functional genomics studies have also identified new avenues of research for potential control strategies against pathogens  <cit> . using this approach we have aimed to gain a better understanding of the molecular regulation of the immune response following m. bovis exposure and infection in cattle, with the expectation of significant benefits in development of new practical tools applicable to disease control  <cit> .

we have previously used a bovine targeted immunospecific cdna microarray to study gene expression changes in bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells  from btb-infected cattle cultured in vitro in the presence of bovine and avian tuberculins  <cit> . pbmc are an accessible tissue for the development of robust novel diagnostics and previous studies have shown that for bovine tuberculosis, immune responses occurring in the peripheral blood reflect those at the site of disease  <cit> . in our previous study, antigen stimulation induced significant and specific expression changes in many immune genes that revealed different gene expression patterns in stimulated and non-stimulated pbmc. although ifng gene expression was increased in response to antigen stimulation, several other genes were highly expressed earlier in the time course  <cit> , suggesting that these genes may represent valuable targets for the development of novel diagnostics of m. bovis in cattle early post-infection.

a subsequent comparative study between btb-infected cattle and healthy control animal pbmc showed that the expression of innate immune genes is repressed in heavily infected cattle in vivo; it also demonstrated that the expression changes for many of these genes represent a btb-signature of infection  <cit> . additional expression profiling using real time qrt-pcr verified that a number of innate immune genes including tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> had reduced expression in btb-infected animals  <cit> . failure of m. bovis to activate these immune genes may have resulted from an antigen-induced suppression, or alternatively from a general failure of the immune system in the advanced diseased cattle.

for the present study, we compared pbmc gene expression profiles from natural m. bovis-infected animals with those from control non-infected animals after stimulation with bovine tuberculin  antigens. we hypothesized that the pbmc from btb-infected cattle would display a distinct gene expression program resulting, at least in part, from previous exposure to m. bovis. these data provide evidence for a novel gene expression program in pbmc from infected animals and highlight the value of large-scale genomics approaches to understand immune regulatory mechanisms that in future may form the basis for novel diagnostics and therapeutics.

RESULTS
distinct microarray gene expression profile in pbmc from btb-infected cattle at  <dig> h and  <dig> h post-stimulation with bovine tuberculin
microarray analysis of mrna expression levels was used to investigate the immune response differences between pbmc from m. bovis infected animals, compared to pbmc from control animals in response to stimulation with bovine tuberculin antigens . gene expression profiling was performed on pbmc from six m. bovis infected cattle and six non-infected controls at three time points , using a reference hybridization design and a common reference rna  pool assembled as described previously  <cit>  . it is widely recognised that that a reference design is the most efficient in terms of resources and statistical flexibility for comparisons among different groups in multi-treatment experiments using dual colour microarrays  <cit> . the expression data generated was deposited in the ncbi gene expression omnibus  repository  <cit>  with experiment series accession . fold change values for all gene expression comparisons obtained from the microarray data were calculated as the mean of the two duplicate spots on the botl- <dig> microarray used for this study.

btb-infected animals
of the  <dig>  duplicated genes  on the botl- <dig> microarray,  <dig> gene spot features  showed significant differential expression in pbmc from btb-infected animals after  <dig> h stimulation with bovine tuberculin, at the p â‰¤  <dig>  level . a substantially smaller number of gene spot features  were differentially expressed in btb-infected samples between  <dig> h and  <dig> h post-stimulation . among the  <dig> differentially expressed spot features at  <dig> h post-stimulation,  <dig> were significantly increased in expression and  <dig> were decreased in expression relative to  <dig> h . at  <dig> h post-stimulation with bovine tuberculin, the number of spot features showing increased expression outnumbered those with reduced expression by a ratio of 2: <dig>  however, at  <dig> h post-stimulation the trend was reversed and there were seven-fold more spot features decreased in expression than increased, relative to  <dig> h post-stimulation  .

inspection of these data revealed that the  <dig> early differentially expressed spot features included  <dig> unique genes where two replicate gene spot features were found to be significantly differentially expressed . fifty-three of these genes were identified as botl clones, ests derived from genes whose function in cattle are unknown, but were inferred from evolutionary sequence homology with gene orthologs in rodents and humans . similarly, between the later two time points,  <dig> genes were represented by significantly differentially expressed duplicate significant spot features .

control animals
in contrast to the differential gene expression profile observed in btb-infected animals in response to bovine tuberculin stimulation, initial gene expression changes in the control pbmc samples were moderate with  <dig> spot features significantly differentially expressed between  <dig> h and  <dig> h  . these were almost evenly divided between increased  and decreased  expression at the later time point . between  <dig> h and  <dig> h of stimulation,  <dig> spot features were differentially expressed , again almost equally balanced between repression and activation  . the initial  <dig> spot features and the later  <dig> spot features significantly differentially expressed represented only  <dig> and five unique genes represented by duplicate spot features .

fold changes for significantly differentially expressed genes on the microarrays ranged from a decrease of  <dig>  fold  to an increase in expression of  <dig>  fold .

inversely correlated gene expression changes between btb-infected and control pbmc after  <dig> h stimulation with bovine tuberculin
comparisons of the  <dig> significantly differentially expressed spot features in the btb-infected animal group and  <dig> features from the control animal group identified  <dig> genes  that were significantly differentially expressed in both groups in response to bovine tuberculin .

clone ids were obtained from the center for animal functional genomics  website: .

the expression of  <dig> of these  <dig> genes was increased in the btb-infected animals in response to bovine tuberculin stimulation relative to the unstimulated samples. all  <dig> genes were expressed in the opposite direction in the control animal group in response to bovine tuberculin stimulation, suggesting a common, but reversed mechanism affecting the regulation of expression or transcriptional trajectory of these genes in the two groups . among the  <dig> genes with significantly increased mrna levels in pbmc from btb-infected animals, and significantly decreased expression in pbmc from the control animals post-stimulation, were transcription factor genes  and genes coding for proteins involved in mrna processing , nucleotide binding , amino acid metabolism , amino acid phosphorylation , protein binding , and translational elongation . other genes with well-characterised roles in the immune response were also differentially expressed. these included the colony stimulating factor  <dig> receptor, alpha gene , involved in the production, differentiation and function of myeloid cells, which was increased by  <dig>  fold . the expression of the chemokine  ligand  <dig> gene  was increased by  <dig>  fold . the protein encoded by ccl <dig> is secreted by activated t cells and displays chemotactic activity for monocytes  <cit> . three genes, an rna binding gene , a phosphatase activity and stress response gene  and a signal transduction gene  were all reduced in their expression in pbmc from btb-infected animals, but significantly increased in pbmc from control animals in response to bovine tuberculin stimulation .

rapid but transient proinflammatory response to bovine tuberculin in pbmc from btb-infected animals detected at  <dig> h post stimulation
of the  <dig>  genes on the botl- <dig> microarray,  <dig> spot features showed significant differential expression between the btb-infected animals at  <dig> h and  <dig> h post stimulation at the p â‰¤  <dig>  level . conversely, only  <dig> spot features were differentially expressed between the later two time points . it is clear from the number of genes differentially expressed in pbmc from btb-infected samples that the majority of differential gene expression occurred early, within  <dig> h of stimulation with tuberculin antigens. this response was both immediate and transient . in contrast, the magnitude of gene expression changes in control animals was significantly different than in the pbmc from btb-infected samples in response to bovine tuberculin stimulation. furthermore, the profile of expression indicated that the majority of differential expression occurred between  <dig> h and  <dig> h in pbmc from the control animals .

a number of genes with well characterised roles in infection and immunity were found to be significantly differentially expressed in the btb-infected animal group after stimulation with bovine tuberculin. some of those that were significantly increased in expression by  <dig> h were the fibroblast growth factor receptor genes  and  , the colony stimulating factor  <dig> receptor, alpha gene  , the lymphotoxin alpha gene  , and a number of kinase genes: akt <dig> , map2k <dig> , map2k <dig> , mapkapk <dig> , map4k <dig> , mlk <dig> , pik3r <dig>  and ksr <dig> . the results from the microarray data also highlighted the involvement of a number of genes encoding components of the tlr signalling pathway including cd <dig> , ikbkb  and nfkb <dig> , all of which were significantly increased in expression . a significant increase in a gene involved in antigen presentation  was also detected .

among those differentially expressed genes that were expressed at lower levels at  <dig> h post-stimulation with bovine tuberculin were a number of botl clones with homology to known genes. these included ppia  and the protein phosphatase genes, ppp2ca , ppp6c  and ptprf .

in contrast,  <dig> gene spot features were significantly differentially expressed in response to bovine tuberculin stimulation in the control animals,  <dig> of these with increased expression levels and  <dig> expressed at lower levels . only  <dig> genes within this group were represented by duplicate spot features. among the genes that were significantly increased in expression in response to bovine tuberculin stimulation were axl  and mapk <dig> . genes with significantly decreased expression in response to stimulation were gata <dig> , mif , and ccr <dig> .

real-time quantitative reverse transcription pcr  supports a differential role for tlr-associated molecules in the early response of btb-infected animals to bovine tuberculin
an extended panel of  <dig> pbmc mrna samples  were used for real time qrt-pcr validation studies. the differentially expressed genes that were detected were classified using gene ontology . selected genes supplemented with others from relevant literature in human and murine models of tb, including those encoding molecules involved in pathogen recognition , signal transduction , gene transcription  and cytokine production  were all investigated by real time qrt-pcr. the results from the  <dig> genes used for these single gene expression studies are detailed in tables  <dig> and  <dig> and corroborate the results obtained from the botl- <dig> hybridisations.

relative expression fold change values are shown with standard errors.

expression levels of cd <dig>  and tlr <dig> in the btb-infected animal group were increased by  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold respectively . genes encoding downstream components of the tlr pathway were also examined by real time qrt-pcr, and increased mrna abundance for chuk and ikbkb, further verified the array data . this also suggested a mechanism to explain the increased expression of nfkb <dig> by  <dig>  fold . a significant  <dig>  fold increase in the mrna expression of the proinflammatory cytokine gene, ifng  was also detected .

in contrast, for the control animal group, increased expression of tlr <dig> by  <dig>  fold  and myd <dig> by  <dig>  fold  was noted . in addition, tlr <dig> and myd <dig> were examined in the infected group by real time qrt-pcr and tlr <dig> in the control group; all three genes were found not to be differentially expressed . genes involved in the interleukin 1Î± receptor signalling pathway were also differentially expressed in both treatment groups. increased expression of the interleukin 1Î± gene  and the interleukin  <dig> receptor type i gene  was detected in the control animal samples by  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold respectively . the il-1r antagonist gene  was also increased in expression by  <dig>  fold . while il1a and il1rn were also significantly increased in the btb-infected animal samples , the decoy receptor il1r <dig> was differentially expressed by - <dig>  fold . expression of the il-1r <dig> gene  was not significantly increased .

toll interacting protein  is a negative regulator of the tlr pathway and has been characterised in humans and mice  <cit> . when examined by real time qrt-pcr, it was found to be significantly increased in expression in pbmc of both btb-infected animal  and the control samples  after bovine tuberculin stimulation by  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold respectively . expression levels of the gene encoding a tlr4-specific molecule, toll-like receptor adaptor molecule  <dig>   <cit> , were estimated in both groups and although not differentially expressed in the control animal group , it was significantly increased by  <dig>  fold in the btb-infected animal group .

the gene encoding interleukin- <dig>  was significantly differentially expressed in both groups . in the btb-infected animal group, il <dig> expression was increased by  <dig>  fold . however, in the control animal group, il <dig> was significantly increased in expression by  <dig>  fold . in addition, it was noted that neither nfkb nor ifng were differentially expressed in the control animal group when tested by real time qrt-pcr .

discussion
bovine tuberculosis is the fourth most important livestock disease worldwide  <cit> . the benefits of developing, applying and maintaining improved control and eradication strategies for btb are manifold, and directly impact on human and animal health  <cit> . the specific immune cell signalling pathways involved in the immune response to btb are highly complex and poorly characterised in cattle. this has obvious limitations for the understanding of, and design of improved diagnostics and effective therapeutics. however, studies on tuberculosis in the human and murine models have highlighted the involvement of cell regulatory signalling pathways in the immune response that are also likely to be relevant in btb. whereas traditionally, studies of btb have focused on adaptive immunity, the findings from these studies are pointing toward a critical role for signalling via the innate immune system, including tlrs in initiating and directing the subsequent immune response and determining the outcome of infection  <cit> .

the timing and potency of the cellular and immunological events that occur immediately post-infection are crucial determinants governing infection  <cit> . pathogen-induced phenotypic changes in host cells are often accompanied by marked changes in gene expression due to host- and/or pathogen mediated reprogramming of the transcriptome during infection  <cit> . previous work by our group compared the gene expression differences between bovine tuberculin-stimulated and non-stimulated pbmc from btb-infected animals  <cit>  and demonstrated that stimulation with bovine tuberculin induced significant gene expression changes that can be useful for dissection of the immune response to btb. subsequently we identified a novel gene expression profile indicative of innate immune gene repression in heavily infected cattle in vivo  <cit> . expression clustering of these data yielded a gene infection signature for disease and highlighted genes and regulatory pathways, including the tlr cell signalling pathway  <cit> .

in the present study we have shown that after overnight recovery in vitro, pbmc from btb-infected cattle are significantly more responsive to bovine tuberculin stimulation than control animal pbmc. gene expression levels were estimated in pbmc from btb-infected and healthy controls either non-stimulated or at  <dig> h and  <dig> h after bovine tuberculin stimulation using a common reference microarray approach . significant gene expression changes were observed in response to bovine tuberculin stimulation for both animal groups over a  <dig> h time course. the microarray data indicated that substantially different gene expression profiles were evident in the btb-infected animals relative to the control animals . following a  <dig> h incubation with bovine tuberculin, these analyses also showed that the immune response in the infected animal group was both rapid and transient . analysis of gene expression differences across the time course showed that differences between groups were most evident in the period between  <dig> h and  <dig> h after bovine tuberculin stimulationâ€“indicating that the early response to bovine tuberculin is substantially different between the two animal groups.

comparative analysis of the pbmc gene expression program in response to bovine tuberculin identified a panel of  <dig> genes that were significantly differentially expressed in both animal groups. interestingly, all of these genes were expressed in opposite directions in the two groups. expression of  <dig> of the  <dig> genes was increased in pbmc from btb-infected animals including genes encoding proteins involved with transcriptional regulation , a chemokine , and a chemokine receptor. in contrast, only three genes were decreased in expression in the btb-infected group. conversely, the opposite pattern was observed in pbmc from the control animals with  <dig> genes decreased, and three genes increased in expression relative to the btb-infected group . these data suggest a number of important gene targets for further study, as well as identifying cell regulatory pathways that may be differentially regulated in btb-infected animals.

of the  <dig> microarray spot features that were differentially expressed in the btb-infected animals, those displaying increased expression in response to bovine tuberculin outnumbered those with decreased expression by a factor of two. we have previously shown that the expression of a number of the genes represented by these spot features, including tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and nfkb, was significantly repressed in heavily infected cattle in vivo  <cit> . the transformation associated with gene repression in vivo to gene activation detected in the same animals in vitro was evident in the reversal in direction of expression of a number of well characterised genes including those encoding tlrs, mhc molecules, and cytokines. furthermore, the  <dig> genes examined by real time qrt-pcr confirmed the botl- <dig> microarray results and supported a trend towards a proinflammatory immune response to bovine tuberculin in pbmc from btb-infected cattle. expression of a gene encoding the key transcription factor and mediator of the immune response  indicated a distinctive proinflammatory gene expression program characterised by a significant two-fold increase in il <dig> expression and 16-fold increase in ifng expression .

while the differentially expressed genes detected in this study provide evidence of a pre-existing gene expression program most likely caused as a result of m. bovis infection in the diseased cattle, other confounding factors could be responsible for some of the changes detected. changes or fundamental differences in cell subpopulations between animals and the separation of pbmc from an in vivo immunosuppressive environment  <cit>  into culture media may have affected some gene expression patterns. although there was no evidence at post-mortem examination of clinical disease in the cattle caused by other infectious agents, the presence of undetected pathogens may have generated host immune responses in either group of cattle that could have accounted for some of the transcriptional changes detected. in addition, it is important to acknowledge that the control and infected cattle were sampled from different herds, and that this may represent a confounding factor in the analysis of gene expression differences between the groups.

genes encoding adaptor and mediator molecules of the tlr activation pathway were also profiled by real time qrt-pcr to examine cellular pathways contributing to the differential response between btb-infected and control animal groups. the gene encoding the toll-interacting protein , a negative regulator of tlr signalling  <cit>  was examined and gene expression was significantly increased in both the control and btb-infected animal groups  in response to bovine tuberculin stimulation. tollip has previously been found to impair tlr- <dig> and tlr- <dig> activation of nf-Îºb  <cit> ; therefore, it might be expected to prevent the downstream signalling from tlr- <dig> and tlr- <dig> in healthy control and btb-infected cattle samples respectively. however, significant increased expression of nfkb <dig> and genes encoding mediators of nf-Îºb , coupled with differential expression of over  <dig> spot features on the microarrays suggested that proinflammatory signalling was not inhibited in the btb-infected animal samples. interestingly, another tlr-4-specific accessory molecule, toll-like receptor adaptor molecule  <dig>  <cit> , discovered in studies of m. tuberculosis infection in mice can bypass the inhibitory effects of tollip to transmit cell signals  <cit>  leading to increased expression of the nfkb <dig> gene  <cit> . expression of the ticam <dig> gene was examined using real time qrt-pcr and was found to be increased in the btb-infected animal samples only . the increased expression of ticam <dig> may possibly provide a mechanism through which proinflammatory gene activation is regulated in btb-infected animals .

our results are consistent with proposed mechanisms that drive an ineffective th <dig> type response and contribute to the outcome of btb infection in cattle. it has been suggested that the th1/th <dig> bias of the immune response can be determined by specific tlrs  <cit> . furthermore, tlr- <dig> activation is a less efficient method of proinflammatory gene activation and may play a role in tlr- <dig> mediated immunosuppression  <cit> .

in the present study, increased expression of the il <dig> and tgfb <dig> genes was detected in the btb-infected group in response to bovine tuberculin stimulation  and elsewhere this has been associated with decreased ability of pbmc and macrophages to restrict mycobacterial growth in both humans  <cit>  and mice  <cit> . furthermore, il- <dig> has been implicated in the suppression of the proinflammatory immune response and subversion of the host bacteriocidal immune response  <cit> . the results of the present study suggest that the 16-fold increased expression of the ifng gene  may drive the changes in gene expression detected in the btb-infected animal group. in addition, although the il <dig> gene is significantly increased in expression by  <dig>  fold , this may be insufficient to compete with the proinflammatory effects of ifn-Î³. in this regard, it has been previously shown that the ratio of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines will determine the overall outcome of the immune response and subsequent correlated gene activation and/or repression  <cit> .

in many countries the presence of m. bovis-infected wildlife can act as reservoirs of btb infection for livestock and there is increased information available on the host response to infection in a variety of these species  <cit> . in our previous study  <cit> , transcriptional profiling of infected and non-infected control animals in the absence of exogenous antigen stimulation demonstrated decreased expression of mhc class ii molecules, and similar findings have been reported in deer in response to natural tb infection  <cit> .thacker and colleagues characterised the immunological responses of peripheral blood leukocytes  from m. bovis-infected and non-infected white-tailed deer to infection by monitoring cytokine gene expression after exogenous antigen stimulation  <cit> . the infected deer displayed a significant 75-fold increase in the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine, ifn-Î³, comparable to the response detected in cattle during the present study. one notable difference was that the increase in il <dig> and tgfb <dig> gene expression in response to bovine tuberculin stimulation of pbmc from infected cattle was not detected in infected deer. however, post-stimulation time points differed between the two studies and this could account for the differences observed.

the results of the present study are consistent with work carried out on johne's disease in cattle caused by m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis   <cit> . those studies also detected a novel gene expression profile in pbmc from map-infected animals that was both rapid and transient across time  <cit> . in a separate study, stimulation of pbmc with map was shown to suppress the proinflammatory immune response  <cit> , and the authors also found evidence of a dynamic th1/th <dig> type response, which eventually gives way to a predominantly th <dig> like response in map-infected animals  <cit> . such a temporal expression pattern, where peak production of il- <dig> lags behind that of ifn-Î³, has also been demonstrated in relation to map stimulation of bovine pbmc  <cit> . an important outcome from these studies involving both map-infected and btb-infected cattle, is that the host gene expression profiles resulting from infection by these two related mycobacteria are remarkably similar.

CONCLUSIONS
the outcome of infection with m. bovis is determined by a complex and dynamic interaction between the host immune system and the pathogen  <cit> . the cellular signalling events governing the immune responses that form the basis of cell-mediated immune btb diagnostic tests remain incompletely understood. we hypothesized that the pbmc from btb-infected cattle would display a distinct gene expression program resulting, from previous exposure to m. bovis. the gene expression program observed in pbmc from btb-infected cattle was substantially different than in pbmc from control animals suggesting that btb infection can modulate the immune response to bovine tuberculin. to the best of our knowledge, this work is also among the first to report the involvement of tlrs and tlr accessory molecules in this immune response.

the results demonstrate that pbmc from btb-infected animals are highly responsive to bovine tuberculin stimulation in vitro, due possibly to their removal from an immunosuppressive environment in vivo  <cit> . specific genes are commonly involved in the differential response of both control and btb-infected animals indicating coordinated regulation of the innate immune response to antigen stimulation. the differential responses of a number of genes involved in cell signalling pathways regulating both the innate and adaptive immune response is indicative of a pre-existing gene expression program. the results are in agreement with other human and mouse models using m. tuberculosis  <cit>  and bovine studies using map. the specific genes activated in response to mycobacterial infection have yet to be fully elucidated, but the overall response profiles seem to be similar among different mammalian hosts  infected with mycobacterial pathogens . the results also demonstrate the usefulness of employing the natural host for m. bovis infection as a model to investigate the immune response to tuberculosis using functional genomics technologies.

future work will concentrate on the elucidation of cell signalling pathways detected during the immune response to bovine tuberculin and their potential roles in the immune repression detected in vivo  <cit> . it is clear that a pre-existing immune program in pbmc from btb-infected animals influences the response to bovine tuberculin stimulation and may affect the outcome of infection. understanding the causes and consequences of this novel gene expression program should ultimately lead to a more complete understanding of the immune response to btb and inform the development of novel or improved future diagnostics and vaccines.
