BACKGROUND
the flagellar hierarchy in yersinia enterocolitica is believed to be similar to e. coli with flhd/flhc constituting the master regulator  <cit>  and flia the sigma factor  <cit> . flhd/flhc is expressed from the flhd operon, that consists of the flhd and flhc genes  <cit> . the two proteins form a heterohexameric complex  <cit>  and are referred to as class i in the three-tiered regulatory hierarchy of flagellar expression . the flhd/flhc complex binds to upstream sequences of class ii genes, including the flia gene  <cit> . flia is the sigma factor of the flagellar system  <cit>  and is required for the expression of the class iii flagellar genes  <cit> .

a more detailed investigation of the flagellar hierarchy of y. enterocolitica demonstrated flia regulation of eight of the  <dig> flagellar operons  <cit> . the expression levels of the remaining seven operons were affected by flhd/flhc in a flia independent manner. in accordance with the e. coli nomenclature, genes that were regulated by flia were classified as class iii  <cit> . it is noteworthy that the two operons that contain the chemotaxis genes, mota and tar, are both regulated by flia, while the three operons that contain genes of the flagellar type iii secretion system, flhb, flif and flil, are independent from flia. regulation of the three y. enterocolitica flagellin genes, flea, fleb, and flec, by flia had been previously shown  <cit> .

in addition to their function as flagellar regulators, flhd/flhc and flia are both global regulators that affect the expression of a large number of non-flagellar genes . flhd/flhc affects the expression levels of many metabolic genes  <cit> , while flia affects the expression levels of several plasmid-encoded virulence genes  <cit> . genes with a large difference in expression between the wild-type cells and the flhd mutants were genes involved in carbamoylphosphate synthesis and degradation, a pathway that leads into the biosynthesis of pyrimidines and hut genes that are involved in the utilization of histidine  <cit> . it was concluded that flhd/flhc might be involved in the flux of nitrogen, using carbamoylphosphate as a checkpoint. regulation of the plasmid-encoded virulence genes by flia was most likely through inhibition of their transcriptional activator virf  <cit> .

in this study, we extend our phenotypic analysis of y. enterocolitica flhd and flia mutants. in agreement with our previous microarray analysis  <cit> , wild-type cells grew better on pyrimidines as nitrogen sources. interestingly, both mutants grew better on purines as carbon sources. in agreement with their higher expression of the hut genes, wild-type cells grew better on histidine.

since flia appeared to be a regulator of plasmid-encoded virulence genes  <cit> , we needed an animal model to study the effect of flagellar proteins on virulence of y. enterocolitica. a chicken embryo lethality assay  was previously developed to determine the pathogenic potential of e. coli strains  <cit> . this assay has been exhaustively studied  <cit> . the typical variability and proper statistical analysis for dichotomous data has been established using the logistic regression analysis and resulting odds ratios. this analysis compares the likelihood of death of any given embryo with a specific bacterial isolate. although the ela has been used primarily as an assay for comparing the pathogenic potential of avian e. coli isolates, its design was also intended to permit comparative virulence studies for isogenic mutants of the enterobacteriacea  <cit> . for this work, the ela was modified for y. enterocolitica strains.

dose response curves for the virulent 8081v isolate and the 8081c isolate that had been cured of the pyv virulence plasmid were obtained. lethality of the 8081v isolate, as well as its isogenic flhd and flia mutants were determined. lethality caused by the flhd mutant was reduced relative to the 8081v strain, while the flia mutation did not affect virulence in this model. the possibility of the reduced lethality of the flhd mutant being the consequence of a lacking flagellar type iii secretion system is discussed.

RESULTS
mutants in flhd and flia have pleiotropic phenotypes on carbon and nitrogen sources
phenotypes of the 8081c y. enterocolitica wild-type strain and its isogenic flhd and flia mutants were investigated with phenotype microarrays . pm <dig> plates contain carbon sources and pm <dig> plates contain nitrogen sources. to correlate the data with the previously described gene regulation  <cit> , the experiments were performed at 25°c, 37°c, and 4°c. growth patterns were compared between wild-type 8081c bacteria and their isogenic flhd or flia mutant strains.

fig.  <dig> shows the determined phenotypes of the strains on carbon and nitrogen sources. at 25°c , flhd mutants grew better on the purines adenosine, inosine, and 2-deoxyadenosine as carbon sources, as well as acetic acid, l-asparagine, l-glutamate, and d-alanine. wild-type cells grew better on n-acetyl-d-glucosamine and d-mannose. wild-type cells also grew better on l-histidine, the pyrimidines cytodine, cytosine, uridine, and thymidine, in addition to d-glucosamine, and n-acetyl-d-glucosamine as nitrogen sources . the mutants grew better on l-asparagine and l-proline. in addition, several dipeptides provided differential growth conditions for wild-type cells and flhd mutants. no difference was observed between flhd and flia mutants.

at 37°c, bacteria did not grow on the pm <dig> and pm <dig> plates. at 4°c, only three carbon sources provided better growth conditions for the wild-type cells . these were d-mannose, d-mannitol, and sucrose. several intermediates of the urea cycle provided better growth conditions for the mutants when used as single nitrogen sources . these were ammonia, d-alanine, l-arginine, and l-proline. uridine was the only one among the pyrimidines that still provided better growth conditions for wild-type cells. the dipeptides met-ala and gly-glu provided better growth conditions for the mutants. again, there was no difference between the phenotypes of the flhd and the flia mutants.

in addition to the pm <dig> and pm <dig> plates, growth profiles of wild-type cells and flhd and flia mutants were determined on pm <dig> plates. pm <dig> plates contain media of different ph, supplemented at low ph  with substrates of amino acid decarboxylases and at high ph  with substrates of amino acid deaminases. no difference was observed between wild-type cells and both mutants . however, it is noteworthy that y. enterocolitica can grow between a ph of  <dig> and  <dig> at 25°c . at 37°c, all tested strains grew best between a ph of  <dig> and  <dig>  but growth at ph  <dig> is better than at 25°c. this might be an adaptation to the human or animal host, where growth conditions are 37°c and the ph is low.

in summary, flhd and flia mutants grew better on purines as carbon sources and wild-type cells grew better on pyrimidines as nitrogen sources and l-histidine. carbon sources that are being degraded by glycolysis provided better growth conditions for wild-type cells. in contrast, carbon sources that are being degraded through the tricarboxylic  acid cycle provided better growth conditions for the mutants. mutants also grew better than wild-type cells on intermediates of the urea cycle as nitrogen sources. the mutants did not have a phenotype on the ph plates that was different from the wild-type.

gene regulation correlates with the observed phenotypes
to correlate gene regulation with the expression of phenotypes, the levels of mrna were determined for genes involved in the above metabolic pathways and possible transport systems . these are the hutc and hutu operons for histidine utilization, the cara and pyrb operons for carbamoylphosphate synthesis and degradation, the deoc operon for purine metabolism, and the acre operon for the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. remarkably, y. enterocolitica has four operons for the transport of peptides  <cit> . of particular interest are the two oligopeptide transport systems. the first one, opp <dig>  contains a hybrid of oppd and oppf . the second one, opp <dig>  contains a duplication of the oppa gene. quantitative pcr  was performed for selected genes  with rna isolated from cultures of wild-type 8081c cells and flhd and flia mutants grown in lb at 25°c until an od <dig> of  <dig> .

column  <dig> indicates the name of the operon that was analyzed.

column  <dig> contains all genes in that operon.

column  <dig> indicates the function of the operon in metabolism and/or transport. annotation information was obtained from sanger  <cit> .

column  <dig> presents the genes that were analyzed.

columns  <dig> and  <dig> indicate the primers that were used for the qpcr reaction. sequence information was obtained from sanger  <cit> .

the flec gene  was used as a control for all qpcr experiments and exhibited an expression ratio of approximately  <dig> fold between the wild-type strain and the mutants . this is consistent with previous studies  <cit> . the pyrb, cara, carb, huti, and hutu genes were expressed at least ten times higher in the wild- type cells than in each of the mutants. in contrast, deob, acre, oppa <dig> and oppb <dig> were expressed higher in the mutants than in the wild-type cells. for the oppa <dig> and oppb <dig> genes, the expression ratio was more than  <dig> fold. the oppc <dig> and oppd/f genes appeared unregulated by flhd/flhc and flia, this was also seen in the remaining peptide transport systems  .

in a previous study  <cit> , flia did not have an effect on the mrna levels of the pyrb, cara, carb, huti, and hutu genes. these data were obtained with rna from cultures grown to an od <dig> of  <dig> . it appears that the growth phase of the culture has an impact on regulation. as one example, the class i operon flhd is expressed earlier in growth than the class ii gene flia  <cit> . the pyrb, cara, carb, huti, and hutu genes seem affected by flhd/flhc in a flia independent manner early in growth. later in growth, flhd/flhc regulation of these genes did require flia.

fig.  <dig> summarizes our current knowledge of gene regulation in y. enterocolitica by flhd/flhc and flia. as reported previously, the class i flagellar master regulator flhd/flhc regulates class ii flagellar genes in a flia independent manner and class iii flagellar genes through flia  <cit> . while class iiib genes are regulated by flhd/flhc through flia alone, class iiia genes are also affected by flhd/flhc in a flia independent manner. regulation of metabolic genes is similar to the flagellar genes and a new classification for flhd/flhc regulated non-flagellar genes is proposed . the tnaa, tdcb, and uspa operons  are regulated by flhd/flhc without any current evidence of flia regulation  <cit> . the cara, pyrb, hutu, hutc, acre, deoc, and opp <dig> operons  are regulated by flia in late exponential growth , possibly in addition to a flia independent flhd/flhc dependent mechanism in mid-exponential growth  <cit> . in addition , flia represses a number of plasmid-encoded virulence genes  <cit> , most likely through repression of their activator virf  <cit> . regulation of many plasmid-encoded virulence genes is an interplay between virf  <cit>  and the chromatin structure  <cit>  that is believed to dislodge the histone-like protein ymoa  <cit> . the invasion gene inv and the phospholipase gene ypla are regulated by flia  <cit> .

fig.  <dig> summarizes our current knowledge of flhd/flhc and flia regulated pathways. l-histidine was one of the nitrogen sources, on which flhd and flia mutants had exhibited a growth deficiency . in agreement with this, several hut genes demonstrated higher expression in wild-type cells than in both mutants . the hut genes serve histidine degradation in numerous bacteria, such as salmonella typhimurium  <cit> , klebsiella aerogenes  <cit> , and bacillus subtilis  <cit> . regulation of the hut genes by flhd/flhc and flia  likely explains the phenotype of reduced growth on l-histidine with the flhd and flia mutants .

the numerous differential phenotypes on dipeptides can most likely be explained with high regulaton of the opp <dig> oligopeptide transport system. other metabolic phenotypes are more difficult to understand. in addition to the flux of nitrogen through carbamoylphosphate that was postulated previously  <cit> , flhd/flhc seems to affect the flux of carbon through pyruvate . this hypothesis is supported by the observations that flhd/flhc and flia support growth on carbon sources that are degraded through glycolysis, mainly fructose-6-phosphate  <cit> , whereas carbon sources that are being degraded via the tca cycle provide better growth conditions for the flhd and flia mutants. in addition, the acre gene, encoding one of the components of pyruvate dehydrogenase, was more highly expressed in the mutants than in the wild-type cells.

modification of the ela for y. enterocolitica strains
the group of genes that are included in fig.  <dig> as regulated by flhd/flhc and have not been addressed yet are the virulence genes. this includes early virulence genes, such as inv and ypla, and late virulence genes, such as the yop genes. in an attempt to determine virulence of the y. enterocolitica flhd and flia mutants, we searched for a suitable animal model. the ela is a virulence assay that was developed in an effort to determine the pathogenicity of e. coli strains that were isolated from healthy and diseased poultry. the assay correlated well with a number of phenotypic and genotypic traits that are associated with avian e. coli virulence  <cit> . in related studies, the ela was compared to an intravenous chicken challenge method  <cit>  and a subcutaneous challenge model  <cit> . a total of  <dig> strains yielded nearly identical results for the intraveneous challenge and the ela  <cit> . so far, the ela has been used solely to determine the virulence potential of e. coli isolates. in this study, we modified the well established assay for the use of y. enterocolitica strains.

in the first experiment, we determined dose response curves for the y. enterocolitica 8081v and 8081c strains after allantoic fluid inoculation. previously described e. coli strains  <cit>  were used as positive and negative controls. inoculation into the allantoic fluid yielded good lethality by the v <dig>  and 8081v  strains . lethality caused by the a <dig>  and 8081c  strains was considerably lower. according to the dose response curve , an inoculum of  <dig> colony forming units  was chosen for y. enterocolitica strains.

while the ela has previously been shown to correlate with numerous virulence traits in e. coli  <cit> , the common animal model that is being used for y. enterocolitica is the mouse model  <cit> . the first target after orogastric infection of mice are the peyer's patches of the small intestine  <cit> . systemic infection involves the spleen, liver, and lungs, a progression that is believed to be similar to humans  <cit> . to compare the course of infection in chicken embryos with that in mice, we analyzed infected embryo organs and determined their bacterial load. a total of nine embryos  from two experiments were opened and the colonization of their internal organs was determined. organs were colonized at  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/g for livers,  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/g for hearts, and  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/g for spleens. as a comparison, spleens of infected mice are colonized at approximately  <dig> cfu/g of organ after infection with an inoculum that is identical to ours at  <dig> cfu  <cit> .

mutants in flhd, but not flia, have reduced lethality in the chicken embryo lethality assay
the pathogenic potential of the y. enterocolitica 8081v strain and its isogenic flhd and flia mutants was determined with the ela. fig. 7a presents the lethality of the inoculated embryos, calculated over three experiments. this includes the two control groups of embryos  as a comparison. lethality of the embryos inoculated with the 8081v strain was highest at 79%, lethality caused by the flia mutant was similar . the flhd mutant exhibited reduced lethality of 49%. when comparing 8081v to the flhd mutant, the odds ratio resulting from the logistic regression analysis for dead embryos was  <dig> . this indicates that the likelihood of death was approximately  <dig> times higher for embryos that were inoculated with the 8081v strain than with the flhd mutant strain. comparison of the flia mutant to 8081v yielded an odds ratio of  <dig> , indicating that there was no statistically significant difference between the 8081v strain and the flia mutant. this result was confirmed with the duncan's multiple group comparison, which found two significantly different groups. the a group contains the 8081v strain and the flia mutant, the flhd mutant forms its own group b .

fig. 7b represents the bacterial counts from the allantoic fluid of the embryos that were inoculated with the y. enterocolitica strains. the average of bacterial counts for each test group of embryos was between  <dig> ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig> bacteria/ml of allantoic fluid for dead embryos and  <dig> ×  <dig> to  <dig> ×  <dig> bacteria/ml of allantoic fluid for living embryos. while living embryos contained generally somewhat lower numbers of bacteria, differences in growth between the four strains were minor and did not parallel differences in lethality . in addition, growth of the strains in liquid lb was very similar for all three strains . obviously, differences in lethality  can not be explained by differences in bacterial growth . this is consistent with a previous study using the ela for e. coli strains  <cit> .

the difference in the lethality caused by 8081v and 8081c parallels observations from a mouse model  <cit> . in this model, the 8081v strain killed mice within  <dig> days of oral infection and the 8081c strain was unable to kill mice or establish systemic infection  <cit> . the association of flagella with infection has been demonstrated for several gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . specifically, mutants of avian e. coli, defective in flagella synthesis, were significantly less able to persist in one day old chicken  <cit> . also, flagella were required for persistent infection of chickens by e. coli o157:h <dig>  <cit> . this could explain our results with the flhd mutant, but not with the flia mutant, as neither mutant synthesizes flagella. results from the flia mutant parallel a previously published experiment with mice  <cit> .

our data indicate that the effect of the flhd mutant on virulence is not due to genes that are regulated by flhd/flhc in a flia dependent manner , but instead indicates the genes that are regulated by flhd/flhc in a flia independent manner ). one of such genes is the flhb gene that encodes one protein of the flagellar specific type iii secretion system that is responsible for the transport of certain flagellar proteins  and a number of virulence factors  <cit> .

we repeated the ela, comparing the lethality caused by a flhb mutant to that caused by 8081v . in three experiments, the odds ratio of lethality for the flhb mutant relative to 8081v was  <dig> , indicating that the odds ratio of dying from 8081v was  <dig> to  <dig> times higher than for the flhb mutant. the duncan's multiple group comparison yielded two statistically different groups. these results are similar to the flhd mutant and consistent with a hypothesis that the lethality phenotype of the flhd mutant was due to genes that are regulated by flhd/flhc in a flia independent manner, such as the ones that encode the flagellar type iii secretion system.

interestingly, possession of the flhd operon might not be the only requirement for virulence of y. enterocolitica. the genes also may have to be properly regulated. first, cultures of 8081v that had grown only into mid-exponential phase  had a much reduced lethality  when compared to cultures that had grown into stationary phase . it is possible that these cultures had not reached their maximum motility yet. second, a plasmid that permitted constitutive expression of flhd did not complement the flhd mutant . flhd/flhc is a positive regulator of early virulence genes and a repressor of late virulence genes. therefore, constitutive expression of the flhd operon would not allow for the expression of the late virulence genes. apparently, full virulence of y. enterocolitica requires flhd to be regulated in a way that allows for expression of the early virulence genes at the time of infection, and expression of the late virulence genes later during the infection process.

CONCLUSIONS
our phenotypic analysis yielded pleiotropic phenotypes of y. enterocolitica flhd and flia mutants. these correlate with previously and newly described gene regulations. phenotypes include growth differences  on several nutrients used as sole carbon or nitrogen sources. among the phenotypes that can easily be explained by the respective gene regulation is the deficiency of the mutants to grow on l-histidine. this phenotype is likely caused by the simultaneous reduction in the expression level of the hut genes. a dramatic increase in the expression level of the opp <dig> operon in the mutants probably explains differences between wild-type cells and mutants in the ability to grow on several dipeptides. pyruvate was postulated as a check-point for the flux of carbon that is affected by flhd/flhc.

the second investigated phenotype was virulence, as determined with a chicken embryo model. in this model, flhd mutants, but not flia mutants, caused a reduced lethality among the embryos when compared to their isogenic wild-type strain. the phenotype of the flia mutant is consistent with a previous mouse model  <cit> . the phenotype of the flhd mutant correlates with previous gene regulation  <cit> . the observation that a mutant in flhb also exhibited a reduced embryo lethality indicates that the lethality phenotype of the flhd mutant might be due to the lack of the flagellar type iii secretion system.
