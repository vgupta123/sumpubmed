BACKGROUND
a significant fraction of known eukaryotic genomes encode for proteins that contain regions that do not fold into a well-defined three-dimensional  structure. these proteins are named intrinsically unstructured or disordered proteins  and normally carry out signalling and regulatory functions  <cit> . these proteins might be either entirely disordered or partially disordered, characterised by regions spanning just a few  consecutive disordered residues  or long stretches  of contiguously disordered residues. it is thought that disordered regions confer dynamic flexibility to proteins, allowing transitions between different structural states  <cit> . the possible utility of such regions was first proposed by linus pauling  <cit> . more recently, computational predictions of disordered regions have discovered that idps are prevalent in proteomes, and have increased during evolution. indeed, it is predicted that 30% to 60% of proteins contain stretches of  <dig> or more disordered residues, being multicellular eukaryotes more enriched in predicted disordered segments than unicellular eukaryotes and prokaryotes  <cit> . these results suggest that proteome size, organism complexity and proteome disorder are related. nevertheless, no overall correlations have been found apart from the clear gain in predicted disorder from prokaryotes to eukaryotes  <cit> . the relationship between low complexity proteins   <cit>  and recombination rate has been discussed  <cit> . these authors suggested that the evolution of lcps in malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum might be related to their high genomic a + t content and recombination rates. however, although low complexity and intrinsic disorder share some structural and sequence similarities, they are distinct phenomena  <cit> . there is evidence that the unstructured state, common to all living organisms, is essential for basic cellular functions linked with complex responses to environmental stimuli and communication between cells  <cit> . moreover, structural disorder is critical for some protein-protein interactions, the assembly of large protein complexes and the modulation of protein activity.

the frequency of idps in  <dig> complete plant proteomes, including vascular plants, bryophyte and chlorophyta, has been previously estimated by applying the disopred <dig> algorithm  <cit> . that work focused on proteins encoded by genes transferred from the chloroplast to the nucleus and reported a strong correlation between the frequency of disorder of transferred and nuclear-encoded proteins, even for polypeptides that play functional roles back in the chloroplast. moreover, it suggested that the distribution of disordered and non-disordered segments in proteins could be to some extent random, as it showed that orthologous proteins across different species do not necessarily conserve disordered segments, despite presumably carrying out similar functions.

the evolutionary history of idps seems to be multi-parametric, as high disorder content in proteomes has been linked to a variety of observations: i) high g + c content,   <cit> ; ii) expanding multi-domain protein families  <cit> ; iii) domain arrangements  <cit> ; or iv) alternative splicing events  <cit> . in order to gain additional biological and evolutionary insights into this topic, the frequency of long disordered segments among homologous proteins of  <dig> plant proteomes is further studied in this work. likewise, the distribution of idps along the chromosomes of model eudicot  and monocot  plant species is analyzed. finally, the possible correlations between structural disorder, genetic recombination rates and g + c content are investigated.

RESULTS
distribution of disordered segments along proteins
in order to characterize the occurrence of long stretches  of contiguously disordered residues among protein domains, their distribution in the proteomes of a. thaliana and o. sativa was investigated. obviously, this analysis could only be performed with sequences with both annotated structural domains and predicted disordered segments, which represent 15%-25% of the corresponding proteomes . the obtained results indicate that disordered segments generally  fall outside protein domains . most of these are actually in the n-terminal  and c-terminal  regions, with only  of disordered segments sitting in linkers that connect domains.

analysis of disorder in paralogous proteins of plants
the occurrence of protein disorder in paralogous proteins from  <dig> complete plant proteomes was analyzed , including  <dig> eudicots and  <dig> monocots species. the total numbers of paralogous protein pairs analyzed were:  <dig> from arabidopsis thaliana,  <dig> from arabidopsis lyrata,  <dig> from populus trichocarpa,  <dig> from oryza sativa, and  <dig> from sorghum bicolor. the data show that on average 64% of paralogues conserve the number of predicted disordered segments, while 36% gain or lose disordered segments. no differences were observed among the plant proteomes analyzed . when a. thaliana proteins were annotated with gene ontology  terms, paralogous proteins with non-conserved disordered segments were associated with  <dig> biological processes and  <dig> molecular functions with corrected p-values < 10e- <dig>  as to the biological processes, these paralogues were mainly associated with “regulation”, including regulation of nitrogen compounds , nucleotide and nucleic acids , rna , macromolecule biosynthesis  or regulation of gene expression . the most significant association among specific molecular functions was with “dna-binding transcription factor activity” , known to be frequent among idps  <cit> .

to investigate in more detail these observations a comparative study of a. thaliana chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  which correspond to a. lyrata chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  and  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , was carried out. particularly, homologous regions where genome rearrangements  presumably occurred during evolution were compared. the findings indicate that the percentage of non-conserved disordered proteins which were translocated close to the centromere is lower than that calculated for both arabidopsis complete proteomes . for instance, the results showed that 2/ <dig>  protein coding genes sitting in the translocated region near the centromere of a. thaliana chromosome  <dig> do not conserve disordered segments. furthermore, 2/ <dig>  proteins encoded in the s-locus do not conserve the disorder feature . it can be reasoned that, if both the centromere and the s-locus are reported to have low recombination rates  <cit> , these observations could be hinting that the frequency of disorder in proteins might be dependent on the recombination rates of their coding genes. of course it is important to note that these regions naturally contain much reduced numbers of paralogues, therefore the estimated percentages might be inaccurate. nevertheless, this hypothesis was tested by plotting the frequency of disordered segments of these a. thaliana and a. lyrata orthologous proteins versus the recombination rates of the corresponding chromosome fragments . the obtained pearson correlation coefficients were r =  <dig>   and r =  <dig>  , respectively, indicating that approximately half of the disorder distribution variance can be explained in terms of recombination rates. the comparison could not be extended to other chromosomes due to the lack of reported recombination rates.

furthermore, in a. thaliana and o. sativa the results showed that disordered segments are more conserved between paralogues located in regions close to the centromere than those spanning chromosome arms . in particular, disordered segments were not conserved in 1/ <dig> and 2/ <dig>  proteins located close to the centromere of a. thaliana and o. sativa, respectively . on the contrary, larger values such as 189/ <dig> and 161/ <dig>  or 1419/ <dig> and 1479/ <dig>  were obtained for proteins located in chromosome arms .

genetic recombination correlates with the evolutionary dynamics of disordered segments in a. thaliana and o. sativa
the distribution of intrinsic protein disorder along the chromosomes of a. thaliana  and o. sativa  was first analyzed by calculating indices of dispersion. variance-to-mean ratios >  <dig> were obtained for all chromosomes, suggesting a non-random physical distribution of disordered proteins across the genome. indeed, a structured distribution could be anticipated as protein disorder has been correlated with high genomic g + c content in other organisms  <cit> . these results led us to extend the previous analyses of genomic regions within a. thaliana and a. lyrata to complete plant genomes. for that, the empirical recombination rates reported for  <dig> chromosomes of a. thaliana and  <dig> chromosomes of o. sativa  were scatter-plotted versus the frequency of disordered segments calculated on those regions . the average pearson correlation coefficients calculated were r =  <dig>  for a. thaliana and r =  <dig>  for o. sativa. these statistically significant correlations show that about a quarter  of the overall, genome-scale variance of intrinsic protein disorder distribution can be justified in terms of genetic recombination rates. as expected, this percentage is lower than that calculated for specific homologous regions of a. thaliana and a. lyrata . however, it is noteworthy that a couple of chromosomes  showed stronger correlations , respectively). outliers, regions where encoded proteins have a larger number of disordered segments  than their genomic contexts , were detected. at least in rice, these seem to correspond with recombination hotspots .

g + c content correlates with disordered protein segments in a. thaliana and o. sativa
an investigation about the relationship between gene g + c content and the frequency of disordered residues within the complete proteomes of a. thaliana and o. sativa was carried out. the g + c content of complete nucleotide sequences , disordered  and ordered  segments was calculated for all predicted idps . the results show that disordered regions are modestly but significantly enriched in g + c bases . similar enrichments were observed in sorghum bicolor  and arabidopsis lyrata and populus trichocarpa  .

the g + cdisordered frequency was plotted versus the frequency of disordered residues calculated for chromosome windows in monocot  and eudicot  plant species . in the case of a. thaliana the obtained pearson correlation coefficients were between r =  <dig>   for chromosome  <dig> and r =  <dig>   for chromosome  <dig>  in the case of o. sativa the correlation coefficients were between r =  <dig>   for chromosome  <dig> and r =  <dig>   for chromosome  <dig>  these results unveil a strong dependence  of these two variables. similar results were obtained for the eudicots a. lyrata  and p. trichocarpa  and the monocot s. bicolor .

g + c content correlates with recombination rates in a. thaliana and o. sativa
the fact that the occurrence of protein disorder is to some extent related to recombination rates and g + c content could suggest that these two later variables might also be linked. the tests carried out in this work show that they are significantly but weakly correlated, with average coefficients of r =  <dig>  in a. thaliana and r =  <dig>  in o. sativa .

in order to re-assess the dependencies among protein disorder, g + c content and recombination rates, a multiple regression analysis was performed. taking the a. thaliana data a linear model was obtained with multiple r <dig> =  <dig> , indicating that protein disorder was only significantly dependent on g + c content . the rice model  confirmed the main contribution of g + c content to protein disorder , but also supported a minor, but significant role of recombination rates . note that gene density within a. thaliana chromosomal regions where recombination rates have been reported is about an order of magnitude larger than in o. sativa . these analyses required the calculation of frequencies of disordered residues as explained in methods .

discussion
in a previous paper, the analysis of  <dig> plant proteomes revealed a similar occurrence of idps to that found in other eukaryotic organisms  <cit> , and concerning their taxonomic distribution, no differences were observed for idps among plant species. however, in some cases, homologous sequences displayed variations in the frequency of disordered segments. the inspection of  <dig> representative plant proteomes performed in this work indicated that on average 36% of paralogues do not conserve their composition of disordered segments. these proteins seem to be involved in regulatory processes, as most idps are, and therefore there is no obvious functional argument to explain their differential conservation behaviour. this result fits well with a previous study in yeast, which reported that non-conserved disordered proteins cannot be clearly associated with any function, and are expressed at low levels  <cit> .

gene duplication is a prominent feature in plant genome evolution with likely implications in genetic diversity and adaptation, although there is not a direct causal link between an adaptive phenotype and a specific gene duplication event because they usually occur at different times  <cit> . duplicate genes arise either by regional genomic events or genome-wide polyploidization. in plants, the last is the most common mechanism. for instance, in arabidopsis, duplications most probably resulted from a single tetraploidization event occurred some  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . this phenomenon presumably involved most genomic regions, although it has been found that centromeric regions have significantly fewer duplicated genes than chromosome arms  <cit> . in addition to these events, which are charted in physical maps, the available genetic maps expose the empirical recombination rates along each chromosome. it is known that recombination rates vary substantially along genomic regions. for instance, the average recombination rate ranges from  <dig>  cm/mb to 251 cm/mb in a. thaliana <cit>  and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm/mb in o. sativa <cit> . peak recombination rates can indicate hotspots, which are opposed to regions of suppressed recombination . an overall positive correlation between gene density and recombination rate has been reported in model plant brachypodium distachyon. on the contrary, a negative correlation has been observed between gene density and the frequency of repetitive regions, and rearranged chromosomal segments that retained centromeric repetitive sequences  <cit> .

the analyses reported in this work show, for the first time, positive correlations between genetic recombination rates and protein disorder frequency in a. thaliana and o. sativa. moreover, the results expose that certain proteins with substantially more predicted disordered segments  than the average  are located within recombination hotspots  <cit>  . these findings suggest that the physical location of paralogous genes along chromosomes could partially explain the differences found in their protein disorder composition. genetic recombination could then be considered an evolutionary force contributing to structural disorder in proteins, at least in plants. previous reports already discussed a relationship between low complexity proteins  and recombination rate in plasmodium falciparum <cit> . interestingly, in this parasite up to 50% proteins are longer than their yeast orthologues due likely to insertions or expansions of lc regions  <cit> .

changes in genomic architecture are a formidable force in the evolution of plants, and structural chromosome rearrangements similar to those of a. lyrata and a. thaliana <cit>  are frequent. as a side-effect, these processes can drive domain sorting in proteins or the formation of novel domains  <cit> . indeed, it has been reported that a significant portion of emerged novel domains during evolution are highly disordered  <cit> . thus, evolutionary increase of protein disorder could be driven by modular or domain exchanges. the link between intrinsic structural disorder and modularity has been recently investigated in the human genome, finding that high levels of disorder within proteins are encoded by symmetric exons, possibly derived from internal tandem duplications  <cit> . the data in this work clearly indicate that disordered segments are mostly located outside annotated domains, with a similar frequency at both n- and c- termini, and a rather low occurrence in linker regions.

this paper reports strong positive correlations between g + c content in coding sequences and predicted protein disorder in  <dig> plant proteomes. this finding is in agreement with computational studies in archaea and bacteria, which established relationships between g + c composition and intrinsic protein disorder  <cit> . during meiotic recombination, parental chromosomes undergo either large-scale genetic exchanges by crossover or small-scale exchanges by gene conversion. there is evidence that in some eukaryote species gene conversion affecting g/c:a/t heterozygous sites yields more frequently g/c than a/t alleles. this process is known as gc-biased gene conversion  and increases the gc content of recombining dna over evolutionary time  <cit> . indeed gbgc is considered the major mechanism explaining the variation of g + c content within and between eukaryote genomes, as coding sequences rich in g + c bases have a higher content of arg, gly, ala and pro codons, precisely those amino acids overrepresented in idps  <cit> . these composition differences explain the g + c content reported in this work for ordered and disordered regions.

previous papers have published strong positive correlations in human, yeast, caenorhabditis elegans, drosophila melanogaster and two rice species between crossover rates and g + c composition  <cit> . on the contrary, the work of wu et al. <cit>  about recombination hotspots and coldspots in o. sativa did not reveal a clear relationship between these two variables. moreover, pessia et al.  <cit>  found no significant correlations in the genomes of a. thaliana, p. trichocarpa and vitis vinifera and even reported a negative correlation not consistent with gbgc in s. bicolor. a negative correlation was also reported for a. thaliana chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . at first sight these apparent contradictions could be telling that the relationship between recombination and g + c composition might be dependent on the plant species. yet, a review of these studies reveals that g + c measurements are not always comparable, and that recombination rates are estimated with different resolution thresholds. for instance, theoretical equilibrium g + c values cannot be directly compared to empirical g + c counts in sequenced genomes. regarding this open question, this paper reports a significant but weak association between recombination and g + c content in a. thaliana and o. sativa. when a multiple regression analysis was carried out to delineate their influence on protein disorder, clearly the effect of g + c content was stronger than recombination. taken together, these observations support a strong molecular-based dependency of protein disorder and g + c content, while suggesting a much weaker relationship between g + c and recombination. in other words, codon composition of amino acid residues common in disordered segments is directly translated into higher g + c values. however, the proposed link between gbgc and g + c content is much harder to capture with the kind of data used in this work.

CONCLUSIONS
the results demonstrate that the presence of disordered segments among plant protiens is associated with the rates of genetic recombination of their encoding genes. high recombination rates, as well as chromosomal rearrangements, could induce disordered segments in proteins during evolution. additionally, the results indicated a stronger molecular-based dependency of protein disorder and g + c content and much weaker dependency between g + c content and recombination rate in plant genomes.
