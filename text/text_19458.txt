BACKGROUND
salmonella enteritidis  has emerged as the most commonly isolated serovar of foodborne salmonella in humans over the last two decades . se belongs to a larger group of pathogens known as non-typhoidal salmonella which ranked the most hazardous when a number of health indices were used to assess the  <dig> most burdensome foodborne bacteria, viruses and parasites causing diseases in humans  <cit> . in canada, the proportion of human salmonellosis caused by se increased from 13% in  <dig> to 38% in  <dig>  <cit> . in the us, an outbreak of se in  <dig> resulted in an estimated  <dig>  human illnesses  and the largest egg recall in the country’s history involving over  <dig> million shell eggs .

early comparative analysis of se with the serovar typhimurium, the latter being one of the best studied salmonella serovars because of its enduring importance as a human pathogen and wide host range among vertebrates, has led to the identification of metabolic pathways and virulence genes for se. the application of dna methodologies especially the adoption of dna-dna hybridization technique as the reference method of establishing relationships among organisms  <cit>  provided insight on the genetic relatedness among many salmonella serovars  <cit> . consequently, the majority of salmonella serovars -  <dig>  at the last count  <cit>  - including serovar enteritidis, were classified into a single species, namely: s. enterica. the remaining  <dig> known serovars, which are typically but not exclusively isolated from cold blooded animals, belong to the second species known as s. bongori
 <cit> 
. this re-designation of a majority of salmonella organisms previously known by their species designation into a single species because of observed genetic similarities conflicted with historical and behavioural differences observed in their host ranges. now commonly described by their serovar designations, organisms belonging to the s. enterica species fall into three broad groups based on the ability to either infect only a single type of vertebrate host , or a limited number of hosts usually including humans  or an extensive host range . other notable differences were observed among serovars with similar host range patterns including cultural growth patterns and biochemical test results in the laboratory. the ensuing conundrum was that observed genetic similarities among serovars was at variance with considerable behavioural differences and this has now led to an urgent need to develop a robust subspecies and sub-serovar level classification  <cit> . to compound the situation, it is clear that isolates of the serovar enteritidis show an even more remarkable and striking genetic similarity with one another to the extent that existing phenotypic and genotypic bacterial typing tools have proven inadequate to assess their degree of relatednesss . despite these reported similarities a number of other studies have identified differences among isolates of enteritidis in animal infection trials, cell invasion assays, growth rates and ability to contaminate and survive within eggs . the above underscores the need for a much deeper insight into the biology of the se which has become accentuated by its new prominence as a foodborne pathogen of humans. the increasing success of a pathogen that displays as much clonality as se is intriguing and not easily explained from a biological perspective. an effective immune response of a vertebrate host against clonal bacteria would almost certainly protect the host against further exposure to the same or similar strains. it is therefore to the advantage of the pathogen to have a capacity and means of evading the host’s immune system by changing its antigenic properties. thus, clonality of a pathogen may ordinarily be seen as a disadvantage from an evolutionary viewpoint. yet, this has not impeded the success of se as a thriving pathogen. from the perspective of a food microbiology laboratory, the clonality of se has made it extremely difficult to demonstrate strain relatedness in an accurate and reproducible manner using available analytical methods. the need to track an organism and to cluster related strains are key elements in the effort to control human outbreaks of se by identifying the sources of infections and prevent further exposures, e.g., by food recall procedures. control of se has been hampered by the low discriminatory potential of the available subtyping tests for sub-serovar classification such as phage typing and pulsed field gel electrophoresis .

the explosive growth in massively parallel sequencing techniques fueled in part by cost affordability, coupled with the development and increasing expertise in the field and application of bioinformatics  <cit> , have created an unprecedented opportunity to further understand the biology of se and to explore genomics-based solutions for outbreak investigations  <cit> . despite a growing body of literature on the application of genomics and bioinformatics to organisms of the genus salmonella, the serovar enteritidis has until recently received little attention; only one finished se genome is available in the public domain  <cit> . the recent addition to genbank of  <dig> draft genomes mainly from us isolates, albeit predominantly belonging to a single pfge type  <cit>  dramatically improves on the available enteritidis genome data and now provides the resource to carry out a comprehensive comparison of isolates from different parts of the world. the comparison of two se isolates belonging to the same phage type , but different pfge types demonstrated diversity of se isolates at the level of single nucleotide polymorphisms or snps  <cit> .

in our study, we used massively parallel sequencing and bioinformatics tools to sequence and characterize the chromosomes of se strains of different pfge and phage types isolated from poultry environments and potential food sources that did not enter the food chain in canada. analyses of the genomes and comparison to the reference strain se p <dig>  an isolate from the united kingdom, confirmed the similarities among different isolates of se and reinforced the organism’s clonal nature. simultaneously, we demonstrated inherent diversity among a number of se isolates at many snp loci and in their prophage content, paving the way for the development of tests that could be used to differentiate lineages and to subtype isolates of se for the purpose of tracking through biological systems including foods, the environment and infected humans.

whole genome analysis of the chromosome of
salmonella
enteritidis isolates of canadian origin


whole genome assembly of salmonella enteritidis chromosome was carried out from raw reads obtained from illumina hiseq or roche  <dig> next generation sequencing platforms using a hybrid method consisting of de novo and reference assembly aided by genome mapping . gene annotation of the finished genomes was carried out using xbase, basys and rast annotation programs.



salmonellaenteritidis genome assembly
all  <dig> genomes of se showed remarkable similarity following full assembly using a composite of template-dependent reference assembly, de novo assembly and comparison with a genome map. initially, we employed the reference assembly procedure using the published genome of the reference p <dig> strain because of the ease of use. a very high level of similarity, ≥  <dig> %, was observed among the assembled nucleotide sequences of the field isolates and reference strain . next, we developed genome maps for each isolate which consisted of an orderly arrangement of all nco i restriction fragments in each genome in the correct orientation. a high degree of similarity was evident among the genome maps of all our  <dig> se isolates . comparison of the genome map of each isolate with the corresponding in silico map of the reference assembled molecule confirmed a high degree of agreement but also revealed clear differences. six or seven contiguous map fragments  and  <dig> -  <dig> other non-contiguous fragments  present in the genome maps could not be located on the corresponding reference assembled genomes. at the same time, an average of  <dig> small-sized fragments  with variable sizes from  <dig> –  <dig>  bp were dispersed within the reference assembled genomes but were absent in their corresponding genome maps. to further examine these discrepancies, an in silico map was generated using the published nucleotide sequence of the reference se strain p <dig> since its use as a template in the reference assembly of raw reads will inevitably influence the output. the reference p <dig> strain was found to contain a dna fragment of approximately  <dig> kb which was absent in all  <dig> genome maps and the  <dig> corresponding in silico maps generated from the reference assembled chromosomes . blast analysis identified the  <dig> kb sequence as coding for the p <dig> phage which, based on the genome annotation, contained  <dig> open reading frames . nevertheless, a comparison of the numbers and sizes of dna fragments used to develop the genome map and the fragments in a reference assembled genome which has been translated into an in silico map, still showed a very high agreement: >95%. but a discrepancy of up to 5% of a genome is substantial and requires further resolution. as a first step in developing a very high quality assembly and to overcome the inevitable distortion that arises whenever a reference genome is used as a template for assembling raw reads of an unrelated or distantly related isolate, we opted to use our collection of de novo assembled contigs of each genome as the basis for creating a high resolution assembly aided by the use of the corresponding genome map.figure  <dig> 
genome maps of eleven canadian isolates of
salmonella
enteritidis. genome maps of contiguous dna fragments of salmonella enteritidis isolates  obtained following digestion with nco i restriction enzyme  were compared to an in silico map of the reference p <dig> strain obtained from the genbank  and all showed high similarity. the two main types of genetic variations observed were single nucleotide polymorphism within the component of the genome shared by all isolates  and presence of prophage sequences . six prophage sequences consisting of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb depicted on the maps as “green square symbol” were present in the reference genome and all field isolates with the exception of se  <dig> which was missing the  <dig>  kb prophage. previously described prophages φse  <dig>  φse 12&12a, and φse  <dig>  match the  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  kb prophage sequences, respectively, both in location and gene content. the unique prophage sequence in the reference genome “blue square symbol” is the p <dig> phage and matches previously described φse <dig> . a  <dig> kb prophage designated as olf- <dig>  is depicted as “red square symbol” and was observed in three isolates, namely: se  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the recently described  <dig> kb elphis prophage  depicted in the maps as “pink square symbol”, was found in all canadian field isolates except one, se  <dig>  which was obtained from a clam . se  <dig> had a unique prophage, termed olf- <dig> “yellow square symbol”, which has not been previously reported as a full  <dig> kb prophage in salmonella enteritidis.



the illumina mate pair reads assembled into an average of  <dig> contigs per genome  and collectively covered approximately 99%  of the corresponding genome maps. the next best assemblies were observed for the roche  <dig> paired libraries which had an average of  <dig> contigs  all of which assembled into a single chromosome covering almost the entire genome length . the shot gun roche  <dig> libraries covered  <dig> % or  <dig> % of the genome over  <dig> or  <dig> contigs, respectively . the dna fragments missing from the reference assembled molecules but present in the genome map were readily identified among the de novo assembled contigs developed using the same raw reads. notable among the dna fragments present in both the de novo assembled chromosome and the genome map, but absent in the reference assembled genome, was a contiguous stretch covering approximately  <dig> kb which was present in  <dig> of the  <dig> field isolates and was found to code for the elphis prophage . a second unique dna sequence of  <dig> kb was detected in three of our genomes . this prophage sequence has not been previously described for enteritidis and is now provisionally designated as se-olf- <dig> phage, after the laboratory identification number of one of the three genomes in which it was found. a third unique prophage sequence,  <dig> kb, was found in only one genome and has been provisionally designated as se-olf- <dig> phage.

the ≤1% disagreement between the genome map and the corresponding set of de novo contigs consisted of two types of gaps: those located between contigs following scaffolding into a single molecule using newbler assembler  or following concatenation of contigs according to the order predicted by genome maps , and those gaps present within contigs due to the inability of the assembly algorithm to determine an accurate order of sequence. the overlay of the reference assembled genome with alignment of de novo contigs and genome maps allowed the identified gaps to be resolved and filled with the corresponding parts of the reference assembly that did not show any discrepancy with the genome map. the gaps were due to sequences subsequently identified as repeating elements and were eventually localized on the genomes. seven gaps were each attributed to sequences of about  <dig>  -  <dig>  kb which were found to code for the ribosomal dna . the raw reads for the rdna sequences typically assembled into three or parts of three separate contigs each containing the coding sequences for the three ribosomal rna subunits, i.e., 23s, 16s and 5s rrna, all belonging to rrna rrn operon, known to occur seven times in the chromosome of all members of the salmonella genus  <cit> . a second set of two or three gaps, depending on the genome, was due to the sequence of an oxaloacetate decarboxylase gene. the third type of repetitive elements affecting genome assembly was due to the cytochrome c oxidase operon which occurred at least twice in each genome and consisted of many but variable numbers of ccm genes. occasionally, a specific gene that has not been duplicated in the genome, e.g., ssei, failed to assemble into a bigger contig and in the case of one genome, a transfer rna  occupied a gap site. to verify our hybrid assembly strategy and ensure all identified gaps were closed, we sequenced a total of  <dig> amplicons covering inter- and intra-contig gaps in one of the genomes . the amplicon sizes as estimated on an agarose gel were in agreement with the expected gap sizes in all cases . sanger sequencing of the amplicons showed excellent agreement with the genome sequences derived from the use of reference assembled molecules as part of the hybrid assembly strategey. as the basis of developing a high resolution genome assembly, the de novo procedure was very successful as judged by ng <dig> values of > <dig>  bp for each of the genomes .

apart from our use of genome maps  <cit>  and additional sanger sequencing to ensure the completeness of the genomes assembled using the hybrid approach as described above, we also compared the entire nucleotide sequence of one of our isolates with a sequence of the same isolate generated with the pacific biosciences single molecule sequencing protocol followed by error correction of the assembled long reads at the genome quebec sequencing centre, montreal. the two molecules had  <dig> % nucleotide match and a complete agreement of their in silico maps .

to estimate the genome coverage, raw nucleotide reads from both illumina and  <dig> sequencing platforms were trimmed and filtered. sequences that were overabundantly represented in the raw reads which would have inflated coverage estimates were removed. sequences showing extremely high or extremely low coverage would have artificially altered the actual coverage estimate if included. fully assembled genomes had a median size of  <dig> , <dig> bp . we estimated the genome coverage to be 205× for the illumina reads  and 30× for the  <dig> reads .

gene composition
genome annotation using xbase, basys and rast led to the identification of genes present in each genome . the number of gene coding sequences ranged from  <dig>  –  <dig>  indicating about 1% variation among the se genomes . the pan genome of se was estimated to consist of  <dig>  genes  with the core genome comprising of  <dig>  genes  and just  <dig> genes  defining the accessory genome. prophage sequences constituted the majority of our accessory se genome  as determined by genome annotation software and confirmed by blast analysis . five prophages or prophage remnants of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb were found in all genomes as well as in the reference p <dig> strain. a sixth prophage sequence of size  <dig>  kb was absent in one of the field genomes  but was present in all of the remaining genomes including the reference genome . prophage diversity was observed in the variable number of prophages present among the isolates and in the sequence composition of prophages when present in multiple isolates . two novel prophage sequences were also identified. a 28kb prophage fragment, provisionally designated as olf- <dig>  was observed in three genomes, namely se  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . the second unique prophage designated as se olf- <dig> prophage is a  <dig> kb sequence found in the clam isolate .

single nucleotide polymorphisms
a total of  <dig>  snps were identified in the core genome of se by comparing our group of eleven genomes with the genome of the reference p <dig> strain . polymorphism occurred in both coding and non-coding regions. there was a preponderance of snps in genes coding for enzymes . a phylogenetic tree constructed using all  <dig>  snps showed a spatial relationship among the strains, and illustrated their genetic distances . a pairwise evaluation of the genomes indicated an estimated range of  <dig> -  <dig> snps among the genome pairs .figure  <dig>

evolutionary relationships among the se isolates
data from snp analysis, gene content, pfge and phage typing  coupled with the evaluation of the accessory genome of each of our canadian isolates  allowed evolutionary inferences to be made in comparison to the reference p <dig> strain. first, pairwise snp analysis shows a clustering of the isolates based on their genetic distances. thus, se  <dig> and  <dig> appear to be closely related: each contains an identical number of genes  and differ by only  <dig> snps. this inference is supported by the source of the two isolates: they were obtained from the same poultry premise on the same day. the pfge result also supported the similarity of the isolates although different phage typing results were obtained . similarly, se  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are closely related based on snp pairwise comparison , an observation supported by identical pfge and phage typing results. these isolates were obtained from two poultry premises in the same canadian province. although all three isolates may well belong to the same biological clade, snp analysis suggests a closer relationship between se  <dig> and  <dig>  than between se  <dig> and  <dig>  or se  <dig> and  <dig> . se  <dig>  which was obtained from a clam had the same phage type  and pfge profile as three other isolates from poultry premises, i.e., se  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  on this basis, a close relationship could have been inferred but this conclusion would have been erroneous. convincingly, the snps in the core se genome and the prophage sequences both showed clearly that se  <dig> was the most genetically distant of all isolates even when the reference strain from the united kingdom is included in the comparison. se  <dig> was lacking the elphis prophage found in all the other canadian isolates, but instead had a unique prophage sequence that has not previously seen as a full prophage in se until now .table  <dig>

discussion
we used two different sequencing platforms in this study, namely illumina and roche  <dig>  the relative strengths and weaknesses of massively parallel sequencing platforms have been well described in numerous publications  <cit> . in this study, both the illumina and  <dig> platforms performed adequately well. the sizes of all eleven genomes were very similar all falling within a narrow range  with no detectable size bias towards one sequencing platform or the other; our largest and smallest genomes, albeit not so disparate, were both sequenced with the roche  <dig> platform. we, however, observed a significant difference in the ease of assembling depending on the type of library: paired end roche  <dig> libraries were readily assembled into a single scaffold using the newbler software. raw reads from the illumina’s mate pair or roche  <dig> shot gun libraries were de novo assembled into multiple contigs following an initial effort and required further work to attain a single scaffold. nevertheless, gaps of indeterminate nucleotides were still present in the single scaffold from the paired end  <dig> roche sequence reads, thus requiring further analysis to achieve a finished genome by employing an innovative hybrid strategy to achieve high quality genome assembly.

our effort to arrange contigs into a high quality assembly and resolve gaps present in the scaffolds benefitted greatly from the availability of genome  maps. knowledge of the order and orientation of nco i fragments in each genome helped to confirm the arrangement of the contigs or scaffolds developed from the de novo assembly of raw reads. predictably, a number of fragments found in the genome map were found missing in the reference assembled genome because of template bias. however, these fragments were found in the de novo assembled contigs. indeed, de novo assembly by itself led to identification of approximately 99% of the chromosome of each of the  <dig> genomes studied while further comparison with the respective genome maps identified the approximate size of any gaps in these assemblies. the genome map also provided the needed confidence to employ parts of the reference assembled molecule to fill any missing gaps by using areas with identical patterns of nco i restriction sites in the genome map and reference assembled molecule, a strategy that would otherwise have raised some doubts because of the bias inherent in reference assembled molecule. the general genetic similarity in the chromosome of se and ability to generate good reference assemblies which, although may suffer the bias of the reference molecule, were nevertheless verified against optical maps and by sanger sequencing and provided an advantage in facilitating the filling of gaps encountered during the course of producing finished genomes. we observed that a high number of genes were shared among our isolates, i.e., core genes at 95%, which was higher than estimates for salmonella paratyphi a , or listeria monocytogenes  which we designate olf- <dig>  this prophage, which has not been reported for the serovar enteritidis, showed a high degree of identity  with gp <dig> protein-containing phages present in each of salmonella serovar newport  <cit> , serovar hirschfeldii - formerly paratyphi c  <cit> , paratyphi – formerly paratyphi a  <cit> , heidelberg  <cit> , and salmonella bongori
 <cit> . significant matches  in areas covering less than half the length of the phage were also observed with elements in non-salmonella organisms such as escherichia coli
 <cit> , enterobacter cloacae
 <cit>  and cronobacter sakazakii
 <cit> , but a unique contribution appeared to have come from serovar typhimurium  <cit>  with a high match  which overlapped a majority of the phage sequence . another unique prophage designated as se olf- <dig> was found in the isolate obtained from a marine source  and an intact copy of this prophage has not previously been reported in se although as much as  <dig> kb of the  <dig> kb prophage  matched sequences annotated as prophage proteins in the se reference p <dig> strain  <cit> . a much larger portion of the prophage sequence  had a significant match with s. bongori sequence which although largely un-annotated, contained an identified phage tail fibre sequence  <cit> . our study suggests that variable prophage combinations may occur in se strains thus providing an opportunity for subtyping se. many prophage encoded genes are transcriptionally silent, acquire mutations that convert them into pseudogenes and in time undergo degenerative changes and become phage remnants  <cit> . in addition, the persistence of prophage sequences in the genome even though they could contain different modules as a result of gene degradation in an isolate  <cit>  could be exploited for lineage tracking. collectively, these changes could be analyzed for the purpose of tracking a strain. we are currently pursuing a prophage-based subtyping procedure as an adjunct to a newly developed single nucleotide polymporphism-based  method  which together should lead to a comprehensive description of the evolutionary map for se in canada. isolates that are closest on our snp-based phylogenetic tree  had identical or similar prophage sequence composition .

single nucleotide polymorphism is one of the commonest forms of genetic variation and appears to be the most promising approach for the genotyping of a highly clonal organism such as se. a recent study identified  <dig> chromosomal snps differentiating between two isolates of se  <cit> . in our study, a comparison of  <dig> genomes with the reference se strain led to the identification of  <dig>  chromosomal snps. a phylogenetic tree constructed using these snps clearly demonstrated the genetic distances among the field isolates  despite what appeared to be a profound genetic similarity among them . results of pairwise snp comparisons  provided quantitative estimates of the genetic distances between  <dig> genomes analysis  as visualized by phylogenetic tree . the distribution of our pairwise snp analysis showed that an isolate from clam was the most genetically distant of our isolates, and differed by an average of  <dig> snps  from all the canadian isolates and the reference genome sourced from the united kingdom. at the other end of the spectrum, we had two isolates that differed by just  <dig> snps inferring very close genetic similarity and confirmed by the historical metadata which showed that the isolates were obtained from the same poultry establishment one year apart . all the other pairwise comparisons occupied a range between  <dig> –  <dig> snps. the number of snps is expected to change as more se genomes are studied. the distribution of our pairwise snp count showed three discrete, non-overlapping populations, namely  <dig> -  <dig>   <dig> -  <dig> and  <dig> -  <dig> snps probably providing a quantitative estimate of isolates that are closely related, distantly related and unrelated, respectively. a note of caution is necessary. the use of bioinformatics software to infer characteristics of assembled genomes including the presence of snps usually require confirmation by other laboratory procedures before adoption for regulatory use because of a possible wide range of implications. errors from the assembly procedure may translate to spurious snps. by the use of a rigorous genome assembly process aided by the availability of genome maps to confirm correct contig orientation, such errors have been minimized in this study. furthermore, bioinformatics algorithms could have inherent errors which may not be easily obvious to a biologist. confirmatory analysis either using other software or a wet laboratory approach could serve to detect such errors. all these mean that the use of bioinformatics analysis to deduce properties of a genome, especially at this stage of the development of the field of genomics will benefit from a wet chemistry approach especially for the development of a tool that is expected to serve a regulatory need. this approach is the basis of a separate communication in which we have used snp-pcr to develop a highly discriminatory molecular subtyping tool for se .

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed high resolution genome sequences for the chromosomes of eleven canadian se isolates by using a hybrid assembly method of sequence reads which relied on a composite of reference and de novo genome assemblies and comparison with genome maps. the procedure is easy to perform and allows the resolution of gaps that would have been caused by repetitive elements such as the rrn operon. high resolution assembly allows a definite assessment of the high degree of similarity among our field se genomes and accurate description of the se genome characteristics including the first report of the core and accessory genomes of se based on fully assembled molecules. despite its relatively large size, the core genome of se shows abundant diversity expressed as snps which should allow for strain differentiation. we suggest that pairs of isolates that differ by <  <dig> snps may be closely related while isolates showing up to  <dig> snps or more are unrelated. the accessory genome of se which consisted mostly of prophage sequences can also be exploited for se lineage tracking because of variable composition of prophages. the same prophage sequence may show different degree of degeneration in distantly related or unrelated isolates. whole genome analyses of se isolates were useful in delineating and quantitatively estimating the genetic distances between isolates. this study has laid the ground work for further studies to develop a readily adoptable laboratory test for the subtyping of se.
