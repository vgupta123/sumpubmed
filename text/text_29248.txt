BACKGROUND
heterotrimeric g-proteins are protein complexes consisting of three subunits . they are present throughout the plant, animal and fungal kingdoms. having the ability to recognize and respond to various internal and external stimuli, they regulate many different developmental and environmental responses, such as cell proliferation, cell wall composition, various hormone responses, ion channel regulation, stomatal opening and closure, sugar signaling, pathogen and elicitor responses .

in contrast to the classical model of g-protein activation, known from fungi and animals, many plants show a strong self-activation of the complex, possibly resulting from comparably more fluctuant and dynamic helical protein domain motions  <cit> . a conformational change in the gα-subunit will release the gβγ-dimer and by that activate downstream signalling pathways via either the gα-subunit and/or the gβγ-dimer  <cit> . completion of the cycle by inactivation of the heterotrimeric g-protein complex seems to differ not only in plants and animals, but even within the plant kingdom  <cit> .

downstream signalling of the gα-subunit as well as the gβγ-dimer  <cit>  can act both synergistically and antagonistically  <cit> . pandey et al.  <cit>  assessed different models for the downstream signal propagation and found that one signalling component can only explain a partial range of the possible reactions, indicating that both parts are involved and needed for the variability in heterotrimeric g-protein signalling and function. specificity in signalling is partially determined by the mutually exclusive expression patterns of the gγ-subunits in arabidopsis thaliana, although e.g. subunit specificity in flowering signalling cannot be explained with this hypothesis  <cit> . additionally, functional diversity is hypothesised to be determined by the number and sequence variation of the complex components, e.g. in animals and fungi a wide variety of gα-subunits can account for functional diversity  <cit> . plants however, possess a small gα- and gβ-inventory  <cit> , implying that functional diversity of the plant heterotrimeric g-protein complex is dependent on the number and variation of gγ-subunits  <cit> .

accordingly, gγ-subunits in plants form a small gene family with up to three members that usually show strong sequence diversification  <cit> . phylogenetically, plant gγ-subunit sequences can be classified into three subtypes  <cit> , based on the sequence, the length of their c-terminal region and the motifs therein. a-type-like gγ-subunits are short proteins containing a c-terminal caax motif similar to fungal and animal gγ-subunits  <cit> , and are the only gγ-subunit type identified in green algae  <cit> . the b-types are also short proteins, but have diverged in monocots and dicots possessing the c-terminal motifs kgsdfs and srxxkrwi, respectively  <cit> . trusov and colleagues  <cit>  found no b-type-like sequence in gymnosperms, prompting them to suggest that the b-type diverged from the a-type after the split of gymnosperms and angiosperms between  <dig> my ago  to  <dig> mya , with a secondary loss in the brassicaceae. the c-types are longer proteins with a cysteine-rich c-terminus, but the length varies considerably in this group  <cit> . interestingly, the moss physcomitrella patens is predicted to have a gγ-subunit not represented in spermatophyta  <cit> , suggesting that additional gγ-subunit types may be discovered.

in line with their important functional roles as switches between signal perception and transduction, transcriptional regulation of heterotrimeric g-proteins towards environmental and developmental cues are studied in detail in angiosperms , and add further support to sequence variation as a key in the broad variety of signalling functions. analyses of gene expression patterns in a. thaliana reveal omnipresent agb <dig>  expression that coincide with the gγ-subunit agg1- and agg2-expression, although the latter two are expressed tissue dependent and mostly mutually exclusive  <cit> .

lately, g-protein signalling is established as a major component in pathogen responses in both monocots and dicots. suharsono et al.  <cit>  showed that in rice, the gα-subunit is an important intermediary of defence responses activated by magnaporthe grisea elicitors, which suggest a role of the gα-subunit in effector triggered immunity . however, several subunits of the heterotrimeric g-protein complex respond to microbe associated molecular patterns   <cit> , indicating a role in pattern triggered-immunity . in a. thaliana, activation of pti require functional gβ- and certain gγ-subunits, while the only c-type gγ-subunit, agg <dig>  does not seem to be involved in pti  <cit> . this suggests functional differentiation in the g-protein subunit repertoire in a. thaliana, as well as a species specific usage of the heterotrimeric g-protein repertoire. in line with this, the heterotrimeric g-protein components are required for host and non-host resistance in a. thaliana, with the exception of agg <dig>  <cit> . lee and colleagues  <cit>  also showed that all involved subunits are significantly higher expressed during biotic stress.

despite being such an important signalling switch, research on heterotrimeric g-proteins is focussed on annual plants. in plants with perennial life styles, such as trees, abiotic and biotic stress are enduring threats that the plants constantly must react to. a quick and functionally specific switch may thus be crucial for the plants longevity. also, information on the g-protein subunit repertoire in gymnosperms would add important information on heterotrimeric g-protein evolution. yet, despite their evolutionary history and their ecological and economic importance, our knowledge on heterotrimeric g-proteins in gymnosperms is very superficial. mostly, gα-, gβ- and gγ-subunit gene sequences in pinaceae are predicted based on expressed sequence tag  sequences  <cit> . this data suggest that pinaceae, like most angiosperms, possess one gα-, one gβ- and a small family of gγ-subunit genes. however, with the aid of the newly published first genome from the conifers, the norway spruce  genome  <cit> , additional information may be gained.

in europe the economically most important pathogen on pinaceae is the basidiomycete fungus heterobasidion annosum  bref. sensu lato . it is a necrotrophic pathogen specialized on conifers and its spread parallels that of its host . independent of the co-evolutionary history, the defense responses triggered by h. annosum s.l. in p. abies are suggested to be non-specific , resembling pti. in europe, two heterobasidion species are known to infect p. abies, h. annosum sensu stricto  and h. parviporum  <cit>  causing stem and root rot in the infected tree, devaluing the timber and increasing the risk of wind-throw  <cit> .

in this study we used the newly available norway spruce genome in combination with est databases to elucidate the heterotrimeric g-protein complex in pinaceae for evolutionary analyses. our phylogenies, including more pinaceae sequences, are coherent with previous studies on plant evolution, with regards to gα- and gβ-subunits. the phylogeny of gγ-subunits indicate lineage-specific radiation. we identify a dicot-specific a-type, as well as a novel gymnosperm type not represented in more basal or higher lineages. sequence diversifications indicate subfunctionalization of the different gγ-subunits in the pinaceae, which is supported by tissue specific expression in norway spruce. we observe changes in the expression patterns of the heterotrimeric g-protein subunit genes in response to wounding, methyl jasmonate , abscisic acid , a saprotrophic fungus and the necrotrophic pathogen h. annosum s.l. this consistent with a pattern-triggered response that is either independent or upstream of the hormone signalling pathways. to the best of our knowledge we present here the first report on heterotrimeric g-protein signalling in perennial species towards biotic stresses.

RESULTS
conifers encode and express a full repertoire of heterotrimeric g-protein subunits
previous studies  <cit>  had already reported some sequences of the pinaceae heterotrimeric g-protein complex, based on est sequences. we identified one gα-, one gβ- and four gγ-subunit-like gene sequences in the p. abies genome  <cit> . the same number was identified in picea sitchensis, while one gβ- and only three gγ–subunit-like sequences were found in picea glauca and pinus taeda. the gα-subunit-like sequences for these two species were reported previously by urano et al.  <cit> . in addition, we also identified gα-subunit-like sequences in additional pinus species. all sequences used in the current study are listed in additional file  <dig>  while we found gene models for all subunits in the p. abies genome assembly, only pagg <dig> had a high confidence gene model that covered the whole sequence. this was not surprising, due to the large genome size, long introns, and high content of repetitive regions, which limited the p. abies assembly  <cit> . we confirmed the in silico identified gα-, gβ- and gγ-like genes from p. abies by cloning and sequencing the full-length coding sequences from cdna libraries . in our subsequent studies we used the sequences determined from p. abies cdna.

in general, the g-protein repertoire in pinaceae was similar in numbers between the investigated species. the lengths of the predicted g-protein-like subunit amino acid sequences were conserved between species in pinaceae, with the exception of the putative p. taeda gg <dig> that was  <dig> amino acids shorter than the orthologous pagg <dig> . the predicted molecular weights of the gα–subunit-like pagpa <dig> and the gβ-subunit-like pahgb <dig> proteins from p. abies were  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda, respectively, while the molecular weights of the gγ-subunit-like proteins were predicted to be equal to, or lower than  <dig>  kda .fig.  <dig> alignment of the isolated p. abies gγ-subunits. alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences of pagg <dig>  pagg <dig>  pagg <dig> and pagg <dig>  the alignment was done using clustalw in mega <dig> . the conserved n-terminal motifs of pinaceae gg <dig>  gg <dig>  gg <dig> and gg <dig> are highlighted . the conserved region in gγ-subunits found in the plant kingdom is highlighted in green. the type-specific c-termini are highlighted in blue

the predicted gγ-subunits separated into two short  and two long  proteins . the gγ-like subunits were divided into four different types, based on the highly variable n- and c-terminal parts. we identified four conserved n-terminal motifs for the different gγ-subunit-like proteins in pinaceae: gg <dig> - meeet / meqet , gg <dig> - mqgt , gg <dig> - minks / misks  and gg <dig> - mik  . further, they showed specific c-termini : pagg <dig> contained a caax motif  that classified pagg <dig> and its orthologs as an a-type gγ-subunit; pagg <dig> and pagg <dig> had long c-termini with high cysteine contents of  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , representing c-type gγ-subunits; while the short subunit pagg <dig> and its orthologs contained a novel motif , previously not shown to be present in monocots or dicots  <cit> . pagg <dig> but not pagg <dig> show a complete g-protein γ subunit-like -domain  <cit>  .

conifers contain a novel gγ-subunit type
to better understand how the heterotrimeric g-protein complex has evolved we conducted phylogenetic analyses of the components. our phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the gα-subunit-like and gβ-subunit-like sequences mainly follow previously published plant phylogenies  <cit>  .

the resulting phylogenetic tree for gγ-subunit-like sequences demonstrated type-dependent, rather than plant evolution dictated topology . we obtained clusters representing a-type-like, b-type-like and c-type-like proteins, respectively . pagg <dig> and its orthologs in pinaceae clustered with the angiosperm a-type-like sequences . in agreement with the unique c-terminal ending, pagg <dig> and its conifer homologs formed a separate clade, related with the a-type-like cluster . this is in accordance with the higher amino acid similarity between pagg <dig> and pagg <dig> , compared to the overall mean similarity between all p. abies gγ-subunit-like types . the c-type-like cluster was split into two groups: one containing dicot and the other conifer proteins, including pagg <dig> and pagg <dig> .fig.  <dig> evolutionary relationships of the gγ-subunits in the plant kingdom. neighbor-joining tree of the gγ– subunit-like sequences of pinaceae, fabaceae, brassicaceae and the moss physcomitrella patens; a-type-like sequences containing a caax-box motif are highlighted in olive, b-type-like sequences are highlighted in green, c-type-like sequences having long cysteine-rich c-termini are highlighted in pink, conifer specific short sequences are highlighted in orange and moss sequences in blue . bootstrap support over  <dig> is associated with lineages



yeast two hybrid assay with conifer g-protein subunits
for heterotrimeric g-proteins to be functional, the gα-, gβ- and gγ-subunits must physically interact with each other as it has been shown in other model organisms  <cit> . to analyse this protein-protein interactions among the members of g-proteins in norway spruce, we performed a comprehensive yeast two-hybrid assay. all subunits were fused with both a gal <dig> activator domain  and a gal <dig> binding domain  individually. these constructs were subsequently transformed into haploid yeast strains and mated in a simple crosswise matrix . protein-protein interactions were scored based on yeast growth on selection media but no growth on the autoactivation media. as expected pagpa1-ad interacted with pahgb1-db . also, pahgb1-ad showed interaction with the gγ-subunits pagg1-db, pagg3-db and pagg4-db, but not with pagg2-db . instead, pagg2-ad interacted with pagg1-db but not with itself, pagg3-db or pagg4-db.fig.  <dig> interactions of p. abies g-protein subunits. yeast-2-hybrid screening of direct interactions of the identified p. abies g-protein subunits on –lth agar plates . the experimental matrix of g-protein ad/db mates: blue indicates interaction on -lth agar plates 



as a limited interaction between gγ- and gα-subunits have been reported  <cit>  in the absence of the gβ-subunit in mammalian systems  we also tested the interaction between pagpa <dig> and the identified gγ-subunits. indeed, the pagpa1-ad interacted with pagg1-, pagg2-, pagg3- and pagg4-db .

different levels of sequence diversification indicate subfunctionalization of gγ-subunits
gγ-subunits show a low overall conservation in the plant kingdom, which suggests that sequence variation may result in functional divergence. we therefore assessed if gγ-subunits evolve under different evolutionary constraints, by performing pairwise comparisons of amino acid conservation in the a- and c-type gγ-subunit clusters in pinaceae, brassicaceae and fabaceae. brassicaceae and fabaceae were chosen as valid angiosperm comparisons as their divergence times  are similar to the divergence time between the genera picea and pinus . for comparison, we also conducted this analysis for the gα-subunit in the same taxa. the lowest sequence variation was detected for the gα-subunit . the highest sequence variation was found in angiosperm c-type-like gγ-subunits . sequence variation was significantly  lower for all conifer gγ-subunit-like and the gα-subunit-like sequences, compared with their angiosperm equivalents .fig.  <dig> conservation of amino acid sequences of gα and gγ in pinaceae and selected angiosperm families. conservation level of gpa1-like protein sequences in fabaceae, brassicaceae, pinaceae and between the fabaceae and brassicaceae . conservation level of long gγ-subunit/c-type-like protein sequences in fabaceae, brassicaceae, pinaceae and between the fabaceae and brassicaceae  and amino acid conservation level of short gγ-subunit-like protein sequences in fabaceae, brassicaceae, pinaceae, picea, pinus and between the fabaceae and brassicaceae . the bar diagram shows the mean amino acid mismatches per protein sequence length in percentage of the gα-and gγ-subunits of the pinaceae, fabaceae and brassicaceae estimated in a pairwise sequence comparison within the on the x-axis indicated sequence clusters. error bars indicate the standard deviation. the heatmap gives the significant differences estimated using one-way anova and the post-hoc tukey-test. the color scale corresponds to the significance levels and is applied to all heatmaps



differential gγ-subunit gene expression indicate subfunctionalization in p. abies
the observed differences in amino acid conservation between the gγ-subunit types may suggest sub- or neofunctionalization. to test this, we studied gene expression of pagpa <dig>  pahgb <dig>  pagg <dig>  pagg <dig> and pagg <dig> in cotyledons and roots of p. abies seedlings at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h after transfer to fresh medium . roots showed a higher expression  of pagpa <dig>  pahgb <dig>  pagg <dig> and pagg <dig> compared to cotyledons over time. pagg <dig> showed stable expression levels over time and tissues, although with decreased levels in cotyledons after  <dig> h.fig.  <dig> tissue specificity of g-protein subunits in p. abies . the relative expression values in cotyledons and roots of p.abies seedlings of pagpa <dig> ; pahgb <dig> ; pagg <dig> ; pagg <dig>  and pagg <dig>  the relative expression in cotelydons  and roots  at 4-, 24- and  <dig> relative to time point t <dig> =  <dig> h is indicated is shown. numbers in the sample code represent the time points at which the tissues were collected. the letters on the bars indicate different statistical groups and the standard deviation is given by error bars 



after having established basal expression levels, we investigated the effect of abiotic and biotic stress on g-protein subunit gene expression. expression of pagpa <dig>  pahgb <dig>  pagg <dig>  pagg <dig> and pagg <dig> was analysed in cotelydons and roots at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h post infection  with h. annosum s.s. conidiospores. in a separate experiment, seedlings were treated with the defense signalling hormones abscisic acid  and methyl jasmonate , as well as a wounding treatment. expression levels of pagpa <dig>  pahgb <dig>  pagg <dig> and pagg <dig> were significantly  induced in p. abies roots after  <dig> hpi with h. annosum s. s. . the induction of pagpa <dig> was detectable already at  <dig> hpi, and reached a five-fold induction at  <dig> hpi. expression of pagg <dig> was induced in cotyledons, as well as in roots. hormonal treatments or wounding did not induce any changes in expression of any gene .table  <dig> transcriptional regulation of g-protein subunits seedling roots in response to h. annosum s.s

discussion
conifers possess a unique short gγ-subunit type not present in other land plants
in this study we set out to investigate presence and functionality of heterotrimeric g-proteins in woody plants. we focus on the conifer p. abies and several of its close relatives. we identified and verified the presence of one gα-, one gβ- and four different gγ-subunit genes in p. abies and found the orthologous genes in other conifers. our survey identified an additional gγ-subunit gene in p. abies and p. sitchensis, not present in p. glauca and p. taeda. the observations for p. taeda and p. glauca are in accordance with the three gγ-subunit genes previously reported from pinaceae  <cit> , and could suggest that the picea lineage gained a fourth gγ-subunit gene that was later lost in p. glauca. however, as the conifer sequences, except p. abies, are retrieved from est databases, we cannot exclude the existance of additional genes.

the four different predicted gγ-subunit-like protein sequences from p. abies can be divided into short and long variants. the modular structures classify pagg <dig> as an a-type gγ-subunit, and pagg <dig> and pagg <dig> as members of the c-type-like gγ-subunit group, according to the description by trusov et al.  <cit> . we found this to be in complete agreement with their phylogenetic placements in our current study. the phylogeny indicates that gg <dig> and gg <dig> are recent duplicates that arose during conifer evolution. based on our data, the most parsimonious hypothesis indicates the duplication event took place after the split of the genera picea and pinus, with gg <dig> being the ancestral sequence. the sequence of pagg <dig> and its coniferous orthologs contain a novel c-terminal motif matching neither a- or c-type-like sequences, nor the monocot or dicot specific b-type sequences. the phylogenetic analysis, together with the observed high similarity between pagg <dig> and pagg <dig>  suggest that pagg <dig> and its orthologs have diverged from the a-type-like clade. thus, pagg <dig> and its orthologs may represent a novel, conifer-specific gγ-subunit type.

conifer gγ-subunits interact differently with pahgb <dig> and pagpa1
as expected with a single gα- and gβ gene pagpa <dig> interacted with pahgb <dig> in the yeast-2-hybrid screen. the smaller gγ-subunits are essentially buried in the gβ-subunit, except for the n-terminus of the gγ-subunit,  <cit>  forming the gβγ-dimer  <cit> ; we found that pahgb <dig> interacts with the gγ-subunits pagg <dig>  pagg <dig> and pagg <dig> but not with the novel, conifer specific, gγ-subunit pagg2; raising a question about pagg2′s functionality. an inspection of the predicted secondary structure of the pagg <dig> protein indicates that pagg <dig> forms only one α-helix instead of two in the ggl-domain  <cit> . such an incomplete ggl domain may interact only weakly with the gβ-subunit.

in accordance with previous reports from mammalian systems we found that pagpa <dig> also interacted with each one of the p. abies gγ-subunits, including pagg <dig>  the interactions between mammalian gγ- and gα-subunits in the absence of the gβ-subunit  have been suggested to depend on the n-terminal region of gγ proteins  <cit>  protruding from the gβγ-dimer, and to have a potential effect on the activation of gα subunits  <cit>  however the corresponding results have not yet been reported from plants.

sequence divergence of the heterotrimeric g-protein complex differs between conifers and angiosperms
in most plant species the gγ-subunits are the only part the heterotrimeric g-protein complex that have more than one gene family member  <cit> . in addition, they are highly variable in sequence and the differences in their transcriptional responses are suggested as critical factors in the broad role of g-protein responses  <cit> . high sequence divergence and specific gene regulation are indicators for sub- and/or neofunctionalization. the gγ-subunit sequences demonstrate a much stronger sequence diversification, especially among c-type-like sequences  compared to the gα-subunits . this result is aligned with the variable number of gγ-subunit genes in most plants  <cit> . interestingly, we also show that g-protein subunit sequences in pinaceae are more conserved compared to their dicot counterparts, irrespectively of subunit type. knowing that gymnosperms generally present a slower evolution than angiosperms, probably due to their long life-spans and large effective population sizes  <cit> , we attribute this observation to the coniferous lifestyle. such differences in sequence divergence may indicate functional divergence, which is demonstrated by the significant difference between the brassicaceae agg <dig> and agg <dig> orthologue groups that have mutually exclusive gene expression patterns  <cit> .

the conifer g-protein complex shows specific regulation
the different levels of sequence conservation prompted us to study gene expression of the heterotrimeric g-protein complex in p. abies within different tissues. in contrast to the green algae chara braunii  <cit> , we found a ubiquitous but tissue-differentiated expression pattern of all subunits. in this respect, the expression pattern is more similar to what is seen in angiosperms compared to more basal lineages, resembling those reported for the putative orthologs in brassica napus and a. thaliana  <cit> . the pahgb <dig> expression also coincides with expression of pagg <dig> and pagg <dig> as expected for interacting gβ- and gγ-subunits, despite that we could not demonstrate an interaction between pahgb <dig> and pagg <dig> in the yeast-two-hybrid assay. interestingly, the constitutive expression of pagg <dig> in p. abies seedlings is in accordance with the constitutive expression of agg <dig> in a. thaliana seedlings  <cit> .

h. annosum s.l. triggers g-protein expression in a mamp-responsive manner
our interest in functional divergence of the heterotrimeric g-protein responses in pathogen defense signalling led us to study expression patterns of the p. abies g-protein subunit genes within different tissues and under different pathogen associated treatments. in the p. abies-h. annosum s.l. pathosystem, wounding and pathogen inoculation show a qualitatively similar response, although the response to the pathogen has a higher amplitude and duration  <cit> . this indicates that the defence responses against h. annosum s.l. are mamp-triggered, but similar to a damp-triggered  <cit>  wound response . the response also involves hormone triggered defense pathways as ja mediated resistance  <cit> . interestingly, the p. abies g-protein subunits pagpa <dig>  pahgb <dig>  pagg <dig> and pagg <dig> in seedling roots respond to h. annosum s.s. treatment, but not to wounding of the seedling. the response in bark of four-year old seedlings was similar, but do not differ between treatments of h. annosum s. l. and p. gigantea, a non-pathogenic fungus  <cit>  at the treatment site, indicating mamp-based signalling cues irrespective of seedling age. the differential regulation of pagg <dig> and pagg <dig> in roots of young seedlings suggests functional differentiation between them, in accordance with the different levels of sequence conservation between orthologs.

we also observed that wounding responses and the response to the saprotroph p. gigantea in inoculated bark on branches of four-year old seedlings will weaken with distance  <cit> , while the response to h. parviporum persists. we suggest that this phenomenon occurs because of the colonization of the living bark by the pathogen and the continuous release of mamps. consequently, pagpa <dig> and pagg <dig> are significantly induced at the distal location only in h. parviporum treatments. the observation that the response to h. parviporum and p. gigantea differ agrees with results from schwacke and hager’s  <cit> , showing that the amplitude of the p. abies response increase with elicitors from h. annosum s. l. compared to elicitors from ectomycorrhizal fungi. based on pharmacological studies the responses observed by schwacke and hager  <cit>  have been suggested to be mediated by either an  phosphorylation of a membrane-bound receptor kinase prior to the activation of a g-protein or  immediately downstream of the activated g-protein  <cit> . these observations are in agreement with our results and our suggestion of heterotrimeric g-proteins acting upstream of ja-signaling, even if the specificity of the gα- subunit activator mastoparan, used in  <cit> , has been questioned  <cit> , it is an interesting observation and we think that it merits further studies the role of pagpa <dig> and its orthologs in mamp perception in pinaceae.

CONCLUSIONS
p. abies possess a full repertoire of g-protein subunits, including a novel conifer-specific short gγ-subunit type . however, the functionality of pagg <dig> is questionable, given that the protein appears not to interact with pahgb <dig>  sequence divergence suggests relaxed evolution of the gγ-subunits compared to the gα-subunits, a pattern typical for duplicated genes. different evolutionary constraints between the gγ-subunits are concomitant with the different expressional responses towards unchallenged and challenged situtations. this indicates subfunctionalization of the paralogous gγ-repertoire. further, differential regulation of pagpa <dig> and pagg <dig> in response to h. annosum s.l. infection indicates that the heterotrimeric g-protein complex represents a critical linchpin in pathogen-perception and downstream signalling responses.
