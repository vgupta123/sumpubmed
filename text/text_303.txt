BACKGROUND
in natural environments, plant growth and crop productivity are reduced by abiotic stresses such as high salinity, drought, heavy metals, and oxidative stress. although these stresses might elicit different plant responses, most induce the accumulation of reactive oxygen species   <cit> , including hydroxyl radicals , superoxide anions , and hydrogen peroxide . the production of large amounts of ros in plant cells leads to oxidative damage . in our previous study, we prepared a cdna library from seedlings of a salt-tolerant plant, puccinellia tenuiflora that had been treated with 150 mm nahco <dig>  <cit> . one of the sequenced genes, putoxr, was found to confer enhanced tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses in yeast. arabidopsis thaliana has a homologous gene, which in our preliminary studies was found to be associated with multiple abiotic and oxidative stress. we thus named it atoxr , furthermore, the study of atoxr gene have not been reported.

h2o2-scavenging in plants is achieved through several mechanisms, for example, the water–water cycle, catalase  enzymatic reactions, the glutathione peroxidase  cycle, and the ascorbate-glutathione  cycle  <cit> . these pathways involve a number of enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase , ascorbate peroxidase , catalase , and glutathione peroxidase  , and anti-oxidants such as glutathione  <cit>  and ascorbic acid   <cit> . in plants, h2o <dig> levels can be changed via the asa/glutathione  cycle, apx plays a central role in the cycle and is emerging as a key enzyme in cellular h2o <dig> metabolism.

asa is not only an important component of human nutrition but also an antioxidant and h2o2-scavenger that defends plants against abiotic stresses . for example, enhanced asa accumulation confers tolerance to oxidative, salt and drought stresses in potato and maintenance of a high asa level is required for oxidative stress tolerance in arabidopsis  <cit> . asa is synthesized through multiple biosynthetic pathways in plants , while the major pathway is smirnoff–wheeler pathway  <cit> . previous studies have shown that overexpression of asa biosynthetic pathway related genes resulted in increased vitamin c content . in addition, co-expression of nced and alo improves vitamin c content and tolerance to abiotic stresses in transgenic tobacco and stylo plants  <cit> . although vitamin c is essential, humans are one of the few mammalian species unable to synthesis the vitamin and must obtain it through dietary sources. in recent years, the physiological function that asa plays in abiotic stress tolerance and nutritional quality has garnered increasing attention.

in the present study, the expression pattern of atoxr in seedlings treated by abiotic stresses was studied using quantitative real-time pcr . the subcellular localization of the atoxr protein and the phenotypes of atoxr gene transformants in yeast and arabidopsis were also analyzed. additionally, the h2o <dig> and vitamin c content of atoxr transgenic arabidopsis and wt plants were determined in plants grown under abiotic stresses.

RESULTS
atoxr, a single copy gene encoding an er protein in arabidopsis
a blast search of the ncbi database for matches to putoxr identified one candidate , which we named atoxr. the sequence is from a gene of unknown function with 61 % identity to putoxr at the amino acid sequence level. atoxr is a single copy gene with a 564-bp open reading frame  encoding  <dig> amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of  <dig>  kda. homologous proteins are found in several other plants . in a phylogenetic tree based on the amino acid sequences of the conserved region, atoxr is most closely related to eutrema salsugineum and capsella rubella of the family brassicaceae . atoxr is predicted to have two transmembrane domains by the tmhmm algorithm .fig.  <dig> sequence and bioinformatic analyses of atoxr.  alignment of the amino acid sequence of atoxr from arabidopsis thaliana  with those of oryza sativa , glycine max , zea mays , setaria italica , medicago truncatula , eutrema salsugineum , capsella rubella , theobroma cacao , and ricinus communis . b phylogenetic trees based on the amino acid sequence of atoxr and homologous sequences from the genbank database. the accession numbers are listed in the experimental procedures section.  transmembrane domains in atoxr were predicted by the tmhmm algorithm , and are underlined in black in 




the er was visualized using er tracker, an er-specific dye for living cells. because eukaryotic yeast shares similar cellular structures with plant cells, the subcellular localization of atoxr in yeast and plant cells were both analysed with an er tracker in this study. we observed that the green fluorescence of gfp alone was almost evenly distributed throughout the yeast  and arabidopsis root cells , whereas the green fluorescence of atoxr-gfp fusion protein  and the red fluorescence of the er tracker  overlapped  in both yeast cells and arabidopsis root cells . these results suggested that the atoxr-gfp was localized in the er in yeast and arabidopsis cells , atoxr is a single copy gene ecoding an er protein in arabidopsis genome.fig.  <dig> subcellular localization of atoxr-gfp. a expression of gfp protein  and atoxr-gfp fusion constructs  in yeast cells. scale bars = 5 μm. b expression of gfp protein  and atoxr-gfp fusion constructs  in a. thaliana  root cells. the gfp column shows the signal detected in the green channel; the er tracker column shows the signal detected in the red channel; the gfp+ er tracker column corresponds to the merging of the green and red channels, in which yellow represents the superposition of green and red. dic: differential interference contrast. scale bars = 20 μm




gene expression of atoxr is induced by abiotic stresses in arabidopsis
to examine the biological functions of atoxr, we first investigated its expression pattern in various organs by qrt-pcr. this analysis showed that atoxr was expressed in all arabidopsis plant organs , with the highest levels of expression in leaves under normal conditions . when plants were grown in the presence of 150 mm nacl, atoxr mrna expression, as shown by qrt-pcr, was induced within 6 h of treatment, declined at 12 h, and then increased again after 24 h in the leaves. in roots, atoxr mrna was slightly declined at 6 h after treatment, and then increased gradually and peaked at 24 h. in the presence of 300 mm mannitol, atoxr mrna expression peaked at 24 h in leaves, whereas expression was induced at 6 h after inititation of treatment in roots, and then began to decline gradually. after stressing with 50 μm cucl <dig>  atoxr mrna expression peaked at 24 h in both the leaves and roots. in the presence of 3 mm h2o <dig>  atoxr mrna expression peaked at 24 h in both the leaves; in contrast, expression peaked at  <dig>  and then declined in roots . overall, these results suggest that the atoxr gene confers a response to multiple abiotic stresses in both leves and roots of arabidopsis.fig.  <dig> expression analysis of atoxr gene from a. thaliana.  quantitative rt-pcr analysis of atoxr in different organs of a. thaliana.  quantitative rt-pcr analysis of the expression of atoxr in response to various abiotic stresses . atoxr expression was normalized against actin mrna levels; the reported data are the means of three replicate experiments ± s.e




overexpression of atoxr gene enhances tolerance to abiotic stresses in yeast and arabidopsis
growth of transgenic yeast cells carrying atoxr was better on solid yeast ypg medium than that of control cells on media containing nacl, mannitol, or h2o <dig> . the transformants also grew much better than did the empty vector transformants on media containing al3+, mg2+, cu2+,mn2+, ba2+, or fe3+ , suggesting that atoxr is associated with the oxidative stress caused by high levels of cations.fig.  <dig> growth of atoxr yeast transformants in response to a variety of abiotic stresses. yeast transformants were grown on  ypd medium containing nacl , mannitol , and h2o <dig>  in the presence of 2 %  galactose and  ypd medium containing different concentrations of the following metal ions: mgcl <dig> , mncl <dig> , bacl <dig> , cdcl <dig> , cucl <dig> , fecl <dig> , alcl <dig>  in the presence of 2 %  galactose. growth was monitored for 3–6 days at 30 °c




three arabidopsis transgenic plants that overexpressed atoxr under the control of the camv35s promoter  were identified by northern blotting . control samples showed weak atoxr signals, whereas the transgenic plants had higher expression confirming that the plants had been successfully transformed with atoxr. in seedlings exposed to nacl , mannitol , cucl <dig> , or h2o <dig> , both the primary roots and leaves grew better in the atoxr transgenic lines compared to wt plants , whereas the growth of wt was similar to that of the transgenic lines on control medium . measurements confirmed that the root lengths  of atoxr transgenic lines were higher than those of wt plants under stress conditions. these results suggest that overexpression of atoxr improved the tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses in arabidopsis.fig.  <dig> relative abiotic stress tolerance of wild-type  and atoxr-transgenic plants.  rna gel blot analysis of t <dig> transgenic plants expressing atoxr. wt: arabidopsis thaliana ecotype columbia-0; # <dig>  # <dig>  and #3: t <dig> seedlings with atoxr on a columbia- <dig> background.  growth of wt plants and transgenic atoxr plants  on medium containing 1/ <dig> ms ,  <dig> and 125 mm nacl ,  <dig> and 200 mm mannitol ,  <dig> and 50 μm cucl <dig> , and  <dig> and 2 mm h2o <dig>  for 14 days.  root lengths of wt and atoxr transgenic plants were measured after treatment. each value represents the means ± se of  <dig> plants. statistical significance was determined using student’s t-tests. *represents p <  <dig>  and **represents p <  <dig> 




determination of h2o <dig> and asa content in atoxr transgenic arabidopsis plants under abiotic stresses
on the control medium, the h2o <dig> contents were slightly lower in three transgenic plants than those of wt plants, whereas h2o <dig> levels began to significant decrease in the three transgenic plants within 12 h of exposure to 150 mm nacl, 300 mm mannitol, 50 μm cucl <dig>  or 3 mm h2o <dig>  comparable to that of wt plants . these results suggest that atoxr is associated with h2o <dig> scavenging to lower oxidative stress.fig.  <dig> effect of abiotic stresses on h2o <dig> content in wt and transgenic plants. the h2o <dig> content of 10-day-old wt and t <dig> generation transgenic plants overexpressing atoxr were assessed after  <dig>   <dig>  or 48 h of treatment:  150 mm nacl;  300 mm mannitol;  50 μm cucl2;  3 mm h2o <dig>  the means ± standard deviations  of three replicates are shown. statistical significance was determined using student’s t-tests. *represents p <  <dig>  and **represents p <  <dig> 




in addition, we also test the asa content in atoxr transgenic plants under abiotic stresses conditions. anylsis the phenotype of asa levels in the normal condition , the asa content was higher in the transgenic plants than in the wt, while in the presence of stresses , it was significantly higher after 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h treatment . to further confirm the content of asa in wt and atoxr transgenic plants under abiotic stresses conditions, hplc method was used to determine the total asa content in the tissues under 150 mm nacl and 3 mm h2o <dig> conditions for  <dig> and 48 h treatment. the hplc analysis showed similar trend to the results of test kit analysis . overall, these results suggest that overexpression of atoxr improves the accumulation of asa content in transgenic plants compared with wt plants under abiotic stress conditions.fig.  <dig> effect of abiotic stresses on asa content in wt and transgenic plants. asa content of 10-day-old wt and t <dig> generation transgenic plants overexpressing atoxr were assessed after 12 h, 24 h, or 48 h treatment:  150 mm nacl;  300 mm mannitol;  50 μm cucl2;  3 mm h2o <dig>  the means ± sds of three replicates are shown. statistical significance was determined using student’s t-tests. * represents p <  <dig>  and ** represents p <  <dig> 




discussion
asa is known to play a role in response to oxidative stress, although the regulatory molecular mechanism of asa synthesis has not been yet well understood. here, we showed that atoxr, an arabidopsis gene of unknown function, is related to the levels of asa and h2o <dig>  atoxr is predicted to have two transmembrane domains. atoxr-gfp was localized to the er in yeast and arabidopsis cells , the localization pattern of atoxr-gfp is agreement with previous reports  <cit> . treatment with nacl, mannitol, metal ions, or h2o <dig> induced atoxr expression in both the leaves and roots . in plants, salt, osmotic stress, and metal ions can be indirect produce reactive oxygen species , which leads to oxidative stress . together, these findings suggest that the expression of atoxr might be associated with oxidative stress. in addition, overexpression of atoxr in yeast and arabidopsis enhanced their tolerances to multiple abiotic stresses . high levels of cations , salt, osmotic stress, etc. can be indirect produce ros, which lead to oxidative stress  <cit> . overexpressing atoxr also improved the tolerance to metal ions in yeast and arabidopsis . thus, these results suggest that the atoxr gene has a role in the response to multiple abiotic stress, and associated with oxidative stress in yeast and plants.

although moderate levels of ros have a role in regulating various biological processes such as hormone signaling, and biotic and abiotic stress responses  <cit> , excessive ros can cause irreversible damage in plants . our finding that atoxr-overexpressing transgenic plants accumulated less h2o <dig> than did wt after challenge with nacl, mannitol, cucl <dig>  and h2o <dig>  is similarly to previous reports that the overexpression of stress resistance-related genes resulted in less h2o <dig> accumulation in response to abiotic stresses .

plants have four major h2o2-scavenging pathways. two of these pathways, the water-water cycle and the ascorbate-glutathione cycle  <cit> , are related to asa, which is known to have roles in plant stress responses  <cit> . therefore, the effect of atoxr on conferring tolerance to multiple stresses might be caused by the increased asa content in atoxr transgenic plants. in addition, asa also has a role in ros detoxification, as an antioxidant and h2o2-scavenger in plant cell to avoid accumulation of ros under stress conditions  <cit> . in our study, the increased asa content in atoxr-expressing arabidopsis in response to abiotic stresses  suggests that atoxr improves tolerance to abiotic stresses by increasing the asa, which in turn promotes the scavenging of excess h2o <dig>  similar result was obtained in the transgenic plants expressing dhar, galdh and co-expression of nced and alo increased tolerance to abiotic stresses with elevated levels of asa  <cit> . therefore, our result suggest that overexpression of atoxr is an effective way for use in crops improvement for increased tolerance to abiotic stresses and nutrition quality.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, our results suggest that expression of atoxr gene is response to abiotic stresses in roots and leaves of arabidopsis. the h2o <dig> and asa content of atoxr-overexpressing transgenic plants were significantly lower and significantly higher, respectively, than those of wt plants under abiotic stress conditions, furthermore, overexpression of atoxr gene improves abiotic stresses tolerance in arabidopsis. in addition to this, because asa is an important component of human nutrition, modified expression of atoxr offers potential for the development of crop varieties with elevated asa. hence, increasing the asa content in crops is important for further agriculture production through moleculer breeding.
