BACKGROUND
influenza a virus is a negative-stranded rna virus with  <dig> genomic segments coding for at least  <dig> proteins  <cit> . gene segment  <dig> encodes the 498-amino acids  long nucleoprotein  that has been shown to be a multifunctional protein with critical roles during various stages of the viral life cycle. the viral rna tightly bind to np and polymerase subunit proteins, pb <dig>  pb <dig> and pa, resulting in the formation of viral ribonucleoproteins  a prerequisite for successful transcription and replication  <cit> . the primary role of np as an rna-binding protein and thus its role as a structural protein contributing towards the formation of the rnp complex within the virion is clearly evident. however, it is the series of events following infection that delineates the major function of np, which mainly constitute importing of the vrnp complex into nucleus, then exporting it back to cytoplasm, and finally preventing their reentry into nucleus  <cit> . interaction of np with several other viral and host proteins is critical for this nuclear import and export  <cit> .

nuclear import of np is regulated by two nuclear localization signals , a non-conventional nls  and a classical nls  present within the np  <cit> . a nuclear import signal in a protein is characterized by one  or two  short stretches of basic amino acids  <cit> . the monopartite signals comprise of two types:  <dig> residue pattern  or the  <dig> residue pattern . pat <dig> nls comprises of either a stretch of  <dig> basic amino acids  or  <dig> basic amino acids  with the fourth aa being either h or p. pat <dig> is a pattern starting with p and followed within  <dig> residues by a basic segment containing  <dig> k/r residues out of  <dig>  thus, based on the above classification the nnls of np  is aptly termed non-conventional nls as it does not fall under both pat <dig> or pat <dig> type of signals  <cit> . the second nls of np  on the other hand though, has been classified as a bipartite signal  and is located near the middle of the polypeptide  <cit> . deletion and mutation analysis of both the nnls and cnls reveal that these signals are essential for nuclear import, viral mrna synthesis, vrna transcription, replication and nucleolar accumulation  <cit> . interestingly, a mutant np lacking both of these nlss was still transported to the nucleus suggesting the existence of at least one additional nls between the cnls and c-terminus region of np  <cit> .

we report here a third novel overlapping bipartite nls  in the np of ws/33l strain located between the nnls and cnls regions identified by bioinformatic analyses. our analysis revealed a single amino acid change  at position  <dig> resulted in converting a 32-aa stretch into two obpnls . using full-length and deletion constructs of np in fusion with gfp, we present experimental evidence that the obpnls is indeed a stand alone functional transport signal and supports efficient translocation of the chimeric protein to the nucleus. furthermore, comparative analysis of  <dig> np sequences revealed that  <dig> influenza virus strains contain np with similar aa change  at position  <dig> with 100% homology to the obpnls region, suggesting the authenticity of the identified amino acid change as a natural variant.

methods
cells, virus and reagents
mdck  and cos-7l cells  were grown at 37°c with 5% co <dig> in dulbecco's modified eagle medium  supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin-streptomycin . influenza a virus ws/ <dig> strain was a gift from dr. zhiping ye, cber, fda and is referred to in the present study as ws/33l to distinguish it from the published ws/ <dig> strains. mouse monoclonal anti-gfp antibody was purchased from clontech labs .

rt-pcr
mdck cells were infected with ws/33l as per a previous protocol and incubated for  <dig> hours  <cit> . total cellular rna from virus-infected mdck cells was extracted with rna stat- <dig> as previously described  <cit> . the rna  was subjected to reverse-transcriptase-based polymerase chain reaction  using a pair of forward  and reverse  primers specific to 5' and 3' orf termini of influenza a nucleoprotein gene . pcr products originating from virus-infected cellular rna were cloned into a ta cloning plasmid, pcr <dig>  and referred to as pcr-np-l. . the pcr products as well as the pcr-np-l clones were sequenced using internal np-specific, t <dig>  and bgh primers as provided by the manufacturer .

construction of np-gfp fusion plasmids
primers were designed based on the genbank ws/ <dig> np sequence  to generate the full-length and various deletion constructs between aa position  <dig> and  <dig> of the np protein. pcr-np-l was used as template for pcr reactions and all the originating products were cloned into pegfp-c <dig> vector  in fusion with the c-terminus of gfp using appropriate restriction enzymes . npΔ obpnls clone was constructed by inserting the ecori-apai digested fragment of np122– <dig> into np41– <dig> clone. to derive the obpnls-nsp <dig> clone, obpnls was cloned at the xhoi-ecori sites of gfp-nsp <dig> clone such that the n-terminus of obpnls was in fusion with gfp, whereas the c-terminus of the protein was in fusion with nsp <dig> protein from lamb rotavirus  <cit> . all clones were sequenced prior to immunoblot or localization analysis.

transfection and confocal microscopic analysis
transient transfections were performed on cos-7l cells, maintained either in 6-well culture plates or in 8-well chamber slides as described previously  <cit> . cells were transfected with 2– <dig> μg of plasmid dna with lipofectamine plus® reagent as per the manufacturer's instructions . following  <dig> hours after transfection, cells were fixed in ice-cold acetone and mounted with vectashield containing propidium iodide . visualization, analysis and photography were all performed using a carl zeiss laser-scanning confocal microscope  equipped with a microprocessor. images were transferred to pc version of adobe photoshope  <dig>  for labeling and printing.

cytolysate preparation and immunoblot assay
cos-7l cells, cultured in 6–well plates and transfected with various np-gfp constructs, were washed with 1× pbs, centrifuged at  <dig>  k in a refrigerated centrifuge  and extracted with ripa buffer . total proteins were resolved on 4–20% sds-page , transferred to pvdf membrane  and the membrane incubated overnight with 1:  <dig>  diluted mouse monoclonal anti-gfp antibody at 4°c  <cit> . secondary incubation with 1: <dig>  diluted anti-mouse peroxidase-conjugated antibody  was carried out at room temperature for  <dig> min. and signals were detected by ecl-chemiluminescence detection .

RESULTS
i. comparative analysis of the deduced amino acid np sequence from ws/33l
the full-length orf of the np was amplified, cloned, sequenced and the sequence submitted to the genomic database . the deduced aa coding sequence of np-l was compared to five other ws/ <dig> np sequences available in the database  . results from our comparative analyses revealed that the published ws/ <dig> np sequences fall into two distinct types, type ws-a  and type ws-b  . between type a and b there is a  <dig> % homology at the aa level and differ only by  <dig> amino acids at residues  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  np sequence from the influenza virus strain that caused pandemic flu in  <dig> was included here for comparison. our np-l sequence appears more like a type a sequence as it shares homology to type a at  <dig> of the above  <dig> critical residue positions. however, np-l sequence shared homology to type b sequences at residue  <dig>  indicating that it does not share a 100% homology to either type a or type b .

ii. bioinformatic analyses of np-l reveal a novel overlapping bipartite nls 
the putative amino acid sequence of np was analyzed by a web-based psort program served at the institute for medical science, university of tokyo, japan . the analyses indicated that a single aa change  resulted in converting the flanking regions  into two overlapping bipartite nuclear localizing signals . the obpnls constituted of bpnls- <dig>  and bpnls- <dig>  . it is to be noted that though a second combination, predictive for bpnls- <dig>  existed between aa  <dig> and  <dig>  we did not utilize this sequence in our localization experiments for the sake of ease of understanding . both bpnls- <dig> and bpnls- <dig> signals adhere strictly to the classical bpnls signature pattern that consists of  <dig> aa, with two basic rich regions separated by a spacer region of any  <dig> aa, and of the two basic regions, one end containing at least two basic aa  whereas the other flanking end containing at least  <dig> basic aa out of a total of  <dig> residues  <cit> . interestingly, the previously reported classical nls   did not qualify as a classical bpnls by the psort analyses as it had more than  <dig> aa in the spacer region  <cit> . the above finding is in concurrence with results from a recent study wherein the mechanism by which influenza a virus np oligomerizes and subsequently binds to rna were evaluated by structural analysis  <cit> . in this study, structural analysis of np was performed in great detail and based on the accessibility of the nls in relation to the structure, it was suggested that the cnls may not function as a classical nls at all  <cit> .

iii. np-l full-length and deletion gfp constructs and analysis of their expression
in order to gain a clear understanding of the contribution of the obpnls in the nuclear localization function of the np, we designed constructs that excluded nnls and cnls regions and contained only the obpnls and its flanking regions between aa 41– <dig> . all np-gfp plasmid constructs were transfected in to cos-7l cells to analyze the correct  expression of the fusion protein. initially, expression analysis was performed by visually observing for gfp fluorescence under a nikon eclipse  <dig> fluorescent microscope. following this, expression of all constructs was confirmed more specifically by analyzing the transfected lysates in an immunoblot assay using a monoclonal gfp antibody. fig.  <dig> demonstrates that all the np-gfp transfected lysates contain fusion proteins within the expected range of size.

iv. protein localization analysis by confocal microscopy
a. obpnls-containing np-l constructs localize exclusively to the nucleus
cellular localization of the gfp-fused np constructs was performed on cos-7l cells and subcellular localization was assessed as described earlier  <cit> . localization was classified into n , n>c , c>n , and c . transfection of np-fl demonstrated a typical punctuate or dotted nuclear localization pattern as described in the literature   <cit> . the other  <dig> deletion constructs, obpnls+nc, obpnls+n-ter, and obpnls+c-ter, that contained the obpnls and devoid of both nnls and cnls were all localized exclusively and/or predominantly to the nucleus . though there was some cytoplasmic localization observed in < 10% of cells transfected with obpnls+nc, it was also noted that all these cells had nuclear fluorescence greater than the cytoplasmic, suggesting a typical n>c localization pattern .

b. bpnls- <dig> and bpnls- <dig> containing the wild-type arg at aa  <dig>  translocate to nucleus
since the obpnls contained signals for two bpnlss that were overlapping, we tested both the signals individually by separating them into bpnls-1r and bpnls-2r, such that the 105rr <dig> of obpnls was common to both these signals . transfection with these plasmid constructs resulted in the bpnls-1r exhibiting a typical exclusive nuclear localization pattern , whereas the bpnls-2r, though displaying a strong nuclear localization pattern however did also result in  cytoplasmic localization as well .

once it was established that both bp-nls-1r and bpnls-2r  were functional signals and were able to translocate efficiently to nucleus we attempted to evaluate the significance of arg <dig> in the nuclear localizing potential of both these signals. this was achieved by designing two plasmid constructs, with the arg  substituted with met , and were named bpnls-1m and bpnls-2m . the bpnls-1m-transfected cells demonstrated a c>n localization pattern and occasionally demonstrated an exclusive cytoplasmic localization in some cells . though the nuclear localization of bpnls-1m was relatively less predominant than the cytoplasmic localization, this result was unexpected. this could be attributed to the fact that some proteins translocate efficiently to the nucleus even in absence of a functional nls when the total basic residues content of the protein is greater than 20%  <cit> . this led us to analyze whether the basic residues within the bpnls-1m aa sequence were contributing towards the nuclear localization. to our surprise, analyses of the bpnls-1m aa sequence  revealed that the total basic residue content within this region was exactly 20% and this as well might be the contributing factor in the nuclear localizing potential of bpnls-1m. similar findings have been reported previously wherein np constructs containing aa 1– <dig>  localized exclusively to nucleus  <cit> . analysis of the bpnls-2m expression on the other hand revealed results as predicted and exhibited an exclusive cytoplasmic localization .

c. np-l constructs lacking the obpnls localize predominantly to the cytoplasm
to further emphasize the significance of obpnls in the nuclear localizing potential of np a series of deletion constructs were made such that  <dig> different constructs, lacking all three nlss , were achieved . these  <dig> plasmids, np41– <dig>  np122– <dig>  and npΔ obpnls, when transfected in to cos-7l cells revealed a cytoplasmic localization pattern as expected . interestingly, the np122– <dig> exhibited a cytoplasmic localization pattern  similar to the bpnls-2m  with intensive accumulation in the cytoplasm as aggregates which appears more akin to golgi-like localization pattern.

d. obpnls signal alone efficiently translocates a known cytoplasmic, non-influenza viral protein to the nucleus
in all the above experiments it was proven beyond doubt that the obpnls was indeed a functional nls with both the overlapping bpnlss contributing equally to translocate the np to nucleus. in order to ascertain that the obpnls is a potent and functional nls we tested the signal by fusing it to a known cytoplasmic protein, rotavirus nsp <dig>   <cit> . the rotavirus is a known cytoplasmic virus with exclusive cytoplasmic localization of all viral proteins. more specifically, the nsp <dig> exhibits a typical cytoplasmic, punctate localization pattern both in infected and transfected cells   <cit> . however, once the obpnls was fused to nsp <dig>  this known cytoplasmic protein localized exclusively to nucleus and demonstrated a typical nuclear localization pattern similar to that of the np .

thus, the present study reports the presence of a novel third obpnls in the influenza virus np-l and unambiguously demonstrates that this signal is functional. it is noteworthy that the obpnls of np-l is present in  <dig> other influenza virus strains  suggesting that the met to arg change  does occur naturally and that this single aa change results in the conversion of the region between aa  <dig> to  <dig> to a 32-residue obpnls . it would be interesting to analyze whether the presence of the third nls in np in these strains impart any specific advantage to the virus or if there exists any difference in the nuclear staining pattern between strains with  <dig> and  <dig> nlss in the np. none of these  <dig> strains, containing obpnls , have been utilized in the previously published np nuclear localization studies. however, it is to be noted that np from type-b wsn <dig> strains  were utilized extensively for cellular localization analysis and it was observed that the np nuclear localization pattern was very similar in virus-infected as well as np-transfected cells  <cit> . what is more pertinent is that the nuclear staining pattern observed with the np-fl  in the present study is very similar to that observed with np-fl  in the previous studies  <cit> . though this is an indirect evidence, it still provides a preliminary comparison of the staining pattern between these two types of nps. furthermore, of the  <dig> strains that exhibit the presence of an obpnls,  <dig> are reassortant swine virus strains and the other  <dig> are ws/ <dig> strains. interestingly, two out of the  <dig> ws/ <dig> strains, that contain the obpnls exhibited distinct pathogenic features. one was a persistent, neurovirulent strain, while the second one was a temperature-sensitive variant . the precise role of obpnls towards persistence or temperature-sensitivity of these strains is not known and needs to be investigated further  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we report here a novel nls in the np of influenza a virus by bioinformatic analysis and present evidence that this signal is transport efficient. future studies on the relevance of this signal towards viral replication or pathogenesis, especially by using a reverse-genetics system available for influenza virus, could provide valuable clues in viral biology. this report while not only establishes a new nls in the influenza virus a strain, it also reinforces the idea that proper application of bioinformatics-coupled experimental analysis serves as a powerful tool in identifying new functional signals in proteins of interest  <cit> .
