BACKGROUND
homeobox genes encode transcription factors defined by a  <dig> amino acid homeodomain motif and have fundamental roles in many aspects of biology  <cit> . the most studied example of these are the hox genes which have an ancestral role in the patterning of the primary body axis and in vertebrates have adopted additional roles in a number of processes including limb and genital development  <cit> . in the majority of species, hox genes are further defined by their clustered organisation in the genome. for example, in drosophila, eight hox genes are present in a single cluster whereas in mammals, four clusters exist of up to twelve genes on four separate chromosomes  <cit> . the clustered organisation of hox genes is crucial to their function. hox genes show colinearity of expression where the relative position of the hox genes along the cluster correlates with the time and domain of gene expression along the anterior -posterior axis of the body  <cit> . the maintenance of hox clusters has provided a model of evolution by gene duplication, an essential source of material for the generation of novel gene function. it is predicted that, initially, newly duplicated genes are functionally redundant. three different evolutionary outcomes exist which will resolve this redundancy. duplicate genes can either be lost by degenerative mutations , functionally compromised in a complementary fashion such that the duplicated genes are functionally equivalent to the single copy ancestral gene  or acquire novel function through natural selection of beneficial mutations . hox clusters provide evidence for all three evolutionary processes  <cit> .

recently, a novel homeobox gene cluster  was discovered on the x chromosome containing  <dig> genes . rhox genes are primarily expressed in reproductive tissues and placenta with additional expression domains in endodermal derived tissues  <cit> . rhox <dig> is essential for the production and motility of sperm  <cit>  and we have shown that rhox <dig> plays an important role in the early stages of es cell differentiation  <cit> . it was reported that the rhox cluster also displays colinearity with the level and timing of expression during spermatogenesis of subsets of rhox genes consistent with their position within specific sub-clusters  <cit> . interestingly, the rhox cluster appears to be rodent specific with only two rhox homologues identified in humans leading to speculation that the cluster is involved in the increased reproductive capacity of rodents compared to humans  <cit> .

we describe an extensive duplication within the murine rhox cluster consisting of eight tandem repeats of a  <dig> kilobase  unit containing rhox <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> potentially increasing the number of rhox genes in this cluster to thirty-two. transcripts have been identified for the majority of these paralogues and all but three are predicted to produce full-length proteins. sequence and evolutionary analyses reveal significant differences in the evolutionary signatures of rhox  <dig>  and  <dig> paralogues indicative of distinct selection pressures. we have performed functional studies in es cells that strongly support a role for both rhox <dig> and rhox <dig> in embryonic stem cell biology.

RESULTS
genomic structure of the duplicated rhox α sub-cluster
in the course of a detailed analysis of the rhox <dig> gene from the mouse genome assembly, we identified multiple copies of rhox <dig>  rhox <dig> and rhox <dig> spanning approximately  <dig> kb of the x chromosome at region a <dig> from position  <dig> k to  <dig> k. dotplot analysis of this genomic region identified a tandem segmental duplication composed of an approximately  <dig> kb unit repeated eight times; six in the forward orientation  and two in reverse orientation  . each of these duplications contain a single copy of rhox <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> with the exception of repeat f which lacks rhox <dig> due to a truncation of the  <dig> prime end. there are therefore eight paralogues of rhox <dig> and rhox <dig> and seven of rhox <dig>  producing  <dig> rhox genes in total. variation exists between each repeat that is primarily due to small rearrangements and repeat element insertions, particularly long interspersed nuclear elements . outwith these features, blast analysis reveals greater than 95% similarity between each repeat, the majority of which is intergenic sequence . from the level of similarity and the small rearrangements and repeat element insertions between the different units, one can make the hypothesis that there were several rounds of duplication with the oldest repeats being at the  <dig> prime end. indeed for the two reverse repeat units at the  <dig> prime region it is difficult to define their boundaries accurately because of more extensive rearrangements. the organisation of this duplication is consistent with other rodent segmental duplications that are largely tandem or tightly clustered  <cit> . the maintenance of orientation and spacing between the different paralogues of rhox <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> suggests that it is unlikely that any of the paralogues have arisen independently of the  <dig> kb tandem segmental duplications.

given such high similarity between the duplications, we sought to eliminate the possibility of improperly assembled database sequence using southern blot analysis. genomic dna from cgr <dig> es cells was digested with hindiii and asp <dig>  two enzymes that are predicted to produce significantly different fragment sizes when probed with rhox <dig> sequence spanning exon <dig> and intron <dig>  the rhox <dig> probe hybridises to multiple hindiii fragments of approximately  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> kb with asp <dig> producing  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> kb fragments  that are consistent with the predicted sizes from the database sequence. identical results were observed for genomic dna isolated from the mus musculus strains c57/bl <dig>  balb/c and fvb. southern blot analysis of genomic dna from mus domesticus and mus spretus identified multiple fragments hybridising to rhox <dig> consistent with multiple duplications of the rhox cluster in these species. these data suggest that the database sequence represents genuine genomic duplications and are highly unlikely to be artefacts of the genomic sequence build.

predicted cdna and protein sequences encoded by duplicated rhox genes
we analysed the gene structure and the predicted cdna and amino acid sequence of each rhox paralogue. the similarity between each of the duplications is manifest in the preservation of intron-exon structure between each variant of rhox <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . clustal w comparison of the cdna sequences that were predicted from repeats a-h revealed, as with the overall duplication unit similarity, greater than 95% similarity between rhox2a-h, rhox3a-h and rhox4a-h . despite such a high similarity we were able to build up a unique nucleotide profile of each copy of rhox <dig>  3and  <dig> allowing them to be definitively identified .

we focussed on rhox2a-h and rhox4a-h and used these nucleotide profiles to determine whether these paralogues were expressed. using primer sequences common to all copies of rhox <dig> or rhox <dig>  we cloned and sequenced rt-pcr products derived from rna isolated from differentiating es cells and placenta, cell types known to express rhox <dig> and  <dig>  in addition, the mouse subset database of expressed sequence tags  was analysed for the unique nucleotide profile of each paralogue. using both techniques, the expression of six out of eight paralogues of rhox <dig>  and five out of seven paralogues of rhox <dig>  were confirmed . translation of the predicted cdnas for each of rhox <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> paralogue is presented in figure 2b, d and . clustalw analysis of rhox <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> paralogues identifies most variation in protein sequence within the rhox <dig> paralogues with rhox <dig> showing the least variation . both rhox <dig> and rhox <dig> groups have non-conservative amino acid variations within the homeodomain region including residues crucial for homeodomain packing or dna binding  <cit>  . such protein sequence variation could provide functional variation between the rhox <dig> and rhox <dig> paralogues with, for example, changes in homeodomain sequence leading to different dna binding characteristics. alternatively, such changes may reflect the nonfunctionalisation of paralogues due to disrupted dna binding. rhox3b, d and g contain non-sense mutations that truncate the predicted proteins after  <dig>  or  <dig>  amino acids . these three genes are unlikely to be functional due to the absence of the homeodomain indicating that these paralogues have become pseudogenes.

these data, therefore, predicts that eight of the rhox <dig>  five of the rhox <dig> and seven of the rhox <dig> paralogues are capable of producing full-length proteins. therefore, of the thirty-two genes in the rhox cluster, at least twenty-nine are predicted to be functional which is over twice the number of genes present in the largest homeobox cluster identified to date in any species.

molecular evolution of rhox <dig>   <dig> and 4
rhox <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are in tandem alignment with each other and show some sequence similarity. however, nucleotide similarity is low; for example, rhox <dig> and rhox <dig> are approximately 65% similar and are, therefore, evolving as separate loci. given that the paralogues present on each duplication unit arose simultaneously, this could be suggestive of different evolutionary pressures on the paralogues within each duplication unit. to test this hypothesis we calculated maximum likelihood estimates of rates of non-synonymous  and synonymous substitution  among alignments of rhox <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> paralogues using a codon-based model of sequence evolution. these models allowed both the analysis of branch specific ratios of the rates of dn and ds, or codon specific ratios along the sequence, following the methods proposed by yang and colleagues  <cit>  respectively. generally, it is assumed that synonymous substitutions among lineages  accumulate through a neutral or nearly neutral process, and by comparing this rate of accumulation to that for non-synonymous substitutions it is possible to ask whether the non-synonymous substitutions accumulate more  or less  than the neutral rate. effectively a dn/ds rate of one is neutral, dn/ds significantly greater than one suggests positive or diversifying selection and a significant dn/ds of less than one indicates amino-acid constraint. we calculated these ratios, henceforth called ω, for the whole gene for each lineage to ask whether particular lineages  were evolving under positive selection and for each codon across all lineages in order to ask whether a codon was under positive selection.

the estimates of dn, ds and ω across each set of paralogues of rhox <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are given in table  <dig>  both the dn and ds rates are relatively low particularly in comparison to genome-wide estimates of divergence between mus musculus and rattus norvegicus confirming that these duplications are relatively recent  <cit> . moreover, there is a 10-fold difference in the synonymous substitution rates between rhox <dig> and rhox <dig> or rhox <dig>  given that the gene paralogues were duplicated together as single genomic fragments this suggests that the rate of nucleotide change is significantly different between rhox <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

to confirm that the ω values are different between rhox genes, we selected rhox <dig> and rhox <dig> and asked whether they are evolving differently after aligning the rhox <dig> and rhox <dig> paralogues to each other. allowing the rhox <dig> genes to have one ratio and the rhox <dig> genes to have another ratio, we found that the likelihood  of a model with different ratios  = 31) significantly differed from a model where all the rhox genes had the same ratio  =  <dig>  p-value <  <dig>  with df = 2). taken together, this data shows that the rhox loci, as part of a relatively recently duplicated genomic region, are under different evolutionary selection.

given that there was significant variation among the rhox loci, it seemed reasonable to test whether ω values were the same among the individual paralogues within each of rhox <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  given a tree for each set of genes  we estimated substitution rates along each lineage. for rhox <dig>  the one-ratio model, which assumes the same ω parameter for the entire tree, leads to l <dig> = - <dig> . we performed analysis of models allowing all branches to have different ω values and we also placed different constraints on the different branches, particularly for branches labelled a and b; : ωa, ωb, ω <dig>  ratios for branches a and b  are significantly greater than the background ratio  and also significantly greater than one. however, a model allowing all branches to vary did not significantly differ from the one ratio model.

among the rhox <dig> paralogues  mostly non-synonymous substitutions were observed. again, the log-likelihood difference between the one-ratio model and the free-ratio model suggests that there are no significant differences between the ratios of different branches . this analysis is limited as no ω values can be calculated for certain lineages due to the absence of synonymous substitutions. for rhox <dig> paralogues b, d and g have in-frame stop codons and we would expect mutations to accumulate in a neutral fashion in these paralogues if they have lost function. the comparison of the free-ratio model and the one-ratio model indicates that there are no differences among branches  .

we next tested for variable ω among codons. the strict neutral model assumes that a proportion p <dig> of sites are conserved with ω  <dig> =  <dig> and a proportion p <dig> = 1- p <dig> are neutral with ω <dig> =  <dig> fitting the data better than a strict one-ratio model which assumes the same ratio for all sites. the alternative model allows for variable ω among codons, with some codons having ω1>  <dig> . we used a likelihood  and a bayesian approach  <cit>  to test for a departure from neutrality among codons. the likelihood approach assumes no recombination  whereas the bayesian approach allows for recombination to occur among lineages throughout the sequence . using paml, all models that allow for positively selected sites suggest existence of such sites among rhox <dig> and rhox <dig> paralogues . for example, the selection model  suggests that ≈ 9% of rhox <dig> amino acid sites are under positive selection. for rhox <dig>  the test of variable ratios among sites  suggests that no particular codon is under positive selection which is consistent with a potential set of pseudogenes. using the bayesian approach implemented in omegamap  similar regions and codons identified with paml analyses above were likely to be subject to positive selection . very different codons appear to be under positive selection in the two genes. for example, the extreme 5' coding portion of the rhox <dig> appears to be under positive selection wheras the same region appears to be highly constrained in rhox <dig>  the complete lack of overlap in positive selection between rhox <dig> and rhox <dig> suggests that these two genes families have diverged to perform different functions. there is little evidence of recombination between paralogues  as these genes are very different from each other. regardless, it appears that the possible presence of gene conversion or recombination has not inhibited our ability to detect positive selection on some codons at the rhox cluster.

rhox <dig> has a comparable function to rhox <dig> in es cells
given the complexity of this genomic region, it is not possible to specifically delete rhox <dig>  rhox <dig> or rhox <dig> from the genome by standard homologous recombination technology. a more complex genome engineering approach would have to be employed to delete the whole duplicated region and subsequent transgenic rescue approaches performed to assign specific functions  to rhox <dig>  rhox <dig> or rhox <dig>  as an alternative, and more immediate approach we have used an overexpression strategy in an attempt to compare the function of the different rhox genes.

we had previously identified rhox <dig> , as a crucial factor in the early stages of es cell differentiation  <cit> . we identified rhox <dig> as the most closely related gene to rhox <dig> within the rhox cluster, so we were interested to assess whether it had a comparable function. we therefore used the same episomal expression system  <cit>  to directly compare the function of these two genes in this system. rhox <dig> and rhox <dig> are expressed at comparable levels in undifferentiated es cells and are downregulated as es cells initiate differentiation in the absence of leukaemia inhibitory factor   <cit>  . we directly compared the effects of altering the level of expression of rhox <dig> and rhox <dig> on the self-renewal and differentiation potential of es cells both in the presence and absence of lif. e14/t es cells were transfected with constructs expressing rhox2a or rhox4b, cultures were selected in puromycin in the presence of lif and the numbers of resistant colonies were counted six days later . flow cytometry of enhanced green fluorescent protein  transfected control cultures and the expression levels of rhox <dig> anti-sense transcripts in es cells transfected with rhox <dig> anti-sense expression constructs demonstrated a very high transfection efficiency . we confirmed our previous findings that over-expression of rhox4b was incompatible with the maintenance of undifferentiated es cells  <cit>  as indicated by the significant reduction in the number of puromycin resistant colonies. over-expression of rhox2a had a similar effect with virtually no colonies surviving after puromycin selection. however, we were able to maintain a pool of rhox4b-over-expressing es cells upon replating in lif  <cit>   whereas it proved impossible to maintain a line of es cells over-expressing rhox2a . this difference could either reflect slight functional differences between rhox2a and 4b or by the differences in expression levels that are achieved using the internal ribosomal entry site- puromycin resistance  construct. we can conclude that expression of rhox2a or rhox4b at a high level is incompatible with an undifferentiated es cell phenotype possibly driving them into a differentiated cell type that has a significantly reduced viability and/or clonogenic potential.

we used constructs carrying full-length anti-sense sequence of rhox2a and rhox4b that have the potential to block expression of endogenous transcripts. we have observed successful knockdown of rhox4b protein when anti-sense rhox4b was co-transfected in cos <dig> cells  <cit>  and we see no reduction in rhox4b protein when anti-sense rhox2a is co-transfected with the rhox4b-expressing vector . furthermore, the anti-rhox <dig> antibody does not detect a band in cos <dig> cells transfected with rhox2a-expressing plasmid  so taken together these data suggest that this strategy can be effective and specific. given the similarity between paralogues of each gene we predict that this type of anti-sense approach could knockdown all paralogues of the gene under test.

rhox <dig> anti-sense expression resulted in a comparable number of colonies compared to control transfections, whereas rhox <dig> anti-sense expression resulted in a slight increase in the number of puromycin resistant colonies . this could indicate that blocking rhox <dig> expression using the full-length anti-sense construct conferred a survival advantage on undifferentiated es cells and contributed to them maintaining their undifferentiated state and self-renewal capacity. the phenotype of alkaline phosphatase-stained colonies after puromycin selection and subsequent re-plating in the absence of lif further substantiated this finding . we had previously shown  that when lif is withdrawn from es cells expressing anti-sense rhox <dig>  small, undifferentiated colonies were detected but no differentiated cells were observed . this suggested that blocking the expression of rhox <dig> inhibits es cell differentiation even in the absence of lif. in contrast, when lif is withdrawn from anti-sense rhox <dig> expressing cells a proportion of cells remain undifferentiated but we also observe a significant number of differentiated cells. thus inhibiting expression of rhox <dig> and rhox <dig> apparently results in a partial or complete block in differentiation, respectively. a block in differentiation is also apparent in anti-sense rhox <dig> expressing cells when cultured in the presence of lif, where all colonies are alkaline phosphatase positive  with no spontaneous differentiation observed . many spontaneously differentiating cells are observed when anti-sense rhox <dig> expressing cells are cultured in lif , a finding that is consistent with the idea that blocking rhox <dig> only partially blocks differentiation. this qualitative difference in the degree of differentiation may reflect a functional difference between rhox <dig> and rhox <dig> in es cells. alternatively, this observation could be explained by differences in the levels of sense and anti-sense expression. we can conclude however, that the levels of expression of both rhox <dig> and  <dig> play a role in the early stages of es cell differentiation in vitro.

discussion
we have identified extensive tandem duplications of rhox <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> on the mouse x chromosome resulting in a total of  <dig> rhox genes of which all but three are predicted to produce functional proteins. the rhox cluster therefore, has more genes than any other homeobox cluster identified in any species. moreover, the degree of similarity between the genomic regions and molecular evolutionary analysis of rhox <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> suggests that this represents the most recent homeobox gene duplication identified to date. despite such a recent duplication event, rhox <dig> and  <dig> paralogues show evidence of positive selection in their evolutionary history suggesting a potential function for these genes. we have also identified a role for rhox <dig> and rhox <dig> in the maintenance and differentiation of es cells supporting the biologically importance of this duplication.

a mouse specific duplication of rhox <dig>   <dig> and 4
the lack of sequence divergence between each  <dig> kb duplication unit and the ds values for rhox <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> imply that the duplication events are relatively young. we predict that the duplications occurred after the divergence of mouse and rat. the alignment of over  <dig>  exons common to mouse and rat predicts a synonymous substitution rate of  <dig>   <cit>  over 10-fold greater than the rhox <dig> paralogues with a ds value of  <dig>  and 100-fold greater for the rhox <dig> paralogues at  <dig> . obviously, the ds values are an average for all rhox <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> paralogues and do not reflect the sequential nature of the duplication events. nevertheless, assuming that mouse and rat diverged  <dig> million years ago  <cit> , a constant molecular clock would result in the relative age of the rhox duplicates being less than one tenth the time split between mouse and rat or approximately < <dig>  million years. however, the ds ratio is not an accurate measure of time as unequal cross-over and gene conversion events can act to alter ds values. this may be particularly relevant in a region showing such repetitive similarity.

mus spretus and mus domesticus are predicted to have diverged from mus musculus approximately three million and one million years ago respectively  <cit> . the presence of multiple rhox <dig> copies in mus spretus suggests that the duplication events were well underway before the divergence of these species  <dig> million years ago. preliminary southern blot analysis using mouse specific rhox <dig> probes suggest that, at most, two copies of rhox <dig> exist in rat . moreover, we screened the rat genome  with the highly conserved exon  <dig> sequence of rhox <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> to see if we could identify different paralogues of these genes as evidence for the presence of these duplications in rat. we identified a single homologue of rhox <dig> on the rat x chromosome  but none for rhox <dig> or  <dig>  by comparison the same screen in mouse identifies multiple copies with different chromosomal coordinates. although the synonymous substitution rate and absence of rhox paralogues in the rat do not definitively show the absence of rhox duplicates in rat these data support our contention that the duplications are murine specific.

molecular evolution of the rhox cluster
the molecular evolution analysis of all paralogues, individual paralogues and individual codons within paralogues suggests that both rhox <dig> and rhox <dig> have different degrees of diversifying selection in their evolutionary history whereas rhox <dig> is evolving neutrally. an extensive analysis of single gene duplicates from a number of species reveals that duplicates typically undergo a phase of relaxed selection or even accelerated evolution at replacement sites and progressively become more constrained as they age  <cit> . although we report a multiple duplication event, our data is consistent with this observation. the differences observed between the evolutionary profiles of rhox <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> could reflect a number of evolutionary and functional differences. rhox <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are expressed at different stages in the development of the testes and es cell differentiation and rhox <dig> is uniquely expressed in the developing and adult thymus  <cit> . we predict that such differing biological functions for rhox <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> will put different evolutionary constraints on these genes resulting in different evolutionary outcomes.

despite the relatively young age of these duplications these data supports divergent selection pressures on a subset of rhox <dig> and rhox <dig> paralogues that is driving functional change. this is at odds with many other transcription factors, including hox genes, which typically show strong evolutionary constraint  <cit> . however, it is consistent with a function for rhox genes in reproduction. sexual conflict, sexual selection and sperm competition are predicted to exert a strong selective pressure driving the rapid evolution of reproductive genes including transcription factors  <cit> . for rhox <dig> we identified two lineages that show significant diversifying selection in their evolutionary history. this data is indicative of a degree of neo-functionalisation for rhox2a, d and e relative to the other rhox <dig> paralogues. within rhox <dig> and  <dig>  individual codons have been identified which show evidence of positive selection. of interest are rhox <dig> and rhox4which translate to non-conservative substitutions within the homeobox region of these genes. mutations within homeodomains are significant as subtle changes in dna binding affinity could have important biological affects due to the alteration of downstream gene activation or repression. consequently, there exists important constraint on homeodomain evolution with rhox <dig> providing one of the few examples of positive selection within this region  <cit> .

one surprising feature of the molecular evolution of rhox <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> is the marked differences in the synonymous substitution rates. differences in base composition, variable mutation rate and gene conversion are all mechanism by which the synonymous substitution rates could vary between genes. studies in e.coli and s. cerevisiae suggest a relationship between gene expression levels and mutation rates  <cit> . although its significance in mammals is unknown, rhox <dig> is expressed 5-fold higher than rhox <dig> during testis development  <cit> . moreover, if the transcriptional control elements of each gene are preserved between duplication units then so will the mechanism for variable ds values between genes. gene conversion could be a factor in suppressing sequence variation in rhox <dig> and rhox <dig> paralogues but not rhox <dig> although, again, this would have to be consistent over all duplication units to maintain the discrepancy in ds values. regardless of mechanism, rhox <dig> paralogues show significantly more sequence variation than rhox <dig> and  <dig>  which may affect the evolutionary trajectories of these genes. regardless of whether gene conversion is contributing to the evolution of these genes, it is unlikely to affect our inferences of adaptation at this region  <cit> .

rhox function in es cells
we provide experimental evidence to show that at least two genes  within the duplicated region of the rhox cluster play a role in the maintenance and early differentiation of es cells. although we used paralogues rhox2a and rhox4b in these studies, the similarity between the rhox <dig> and rhox <dig> paralogues would predict that these other paralogues would have comparable effects. both genes are expressed in undifferentiated es cells so we tested the effects of altering the levels of expression of rhox <dig> and rhox <dig> on the undifferentiated phenotype. this strategy has revealed other homeobox-containing genes, oct <dig> and nanog as key stem cell regulators  <cit> . increases in oct <dig> expression levels in es cells induces differentiation in a manner that is dominant over the suppressive effects of lif and overexpression of nanog has been shown to drive self-renewal of es cells in the absence of lif. we show that artificially high levels of rhox <dig> or rhox <dig> are incompatible with an undifferentiated es cell phenotype either because such high levels of these proteins affect the viability of undifferentiated es cells or because they override the effects of lif and drive undifferentiated es cells into a differentiated state that cannot survive. we favour the latter explanation because when we reduce the levels of rhox <dig>  differentiation of es cells appears to be blocked. reduction of rhox <dig> protein increases the numbers of self-renewing colonies in the presence of lif and, in the absence of lif, blocking either rhox <dig> or rhox <dig> results in is a persistence of self-renewing stem cells that are not observed in control cultures. as mentioned, we predict that the anti-sense approach we have used to disrupt rhox gene function is likely to affect all paralogues. a sirna approach could extend these studies to assess the function of the individual paralogues.

although es cells have proven invaluable as a research tool they are not considered to be entirely equivalent to the inner cell mass tissue from which they are derived  <cit> . consequently, relating the function of rhox proteins in the in vitro es cells system to any evolutionary analysis is inappropriate. however, rhox <dig> is expressed in trophoblast stem  cells in vitro and in vivo supporting a function for rhox <dig> in the stem cell compartment of developing placenta that would provide selective pressure for evolutionary change  <cit> . consequently, the analysis of rhox function in ts cells would be more applicable to molecular evolutionary data. for example, over-expression of different rhox paralogues in ts cell cultures may help identify whether positive selection of certain paralogues or codons is associated with differences in downstream gene expression changes.

our data suggest that the expression levels of rhox <dig> and  <dig> may be crucial to their function in es cells and this phenomenon may be applicable to other cell types in which they are expressed. gene duplication is used by a number of genes, for example rrna and histones, as a means of driving high-level gene expression. the possibility arises that the number of rhox <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> paralogues is linked to the expression levels of these genes. the modulation of rhox gene expression levels in es cells and the consequent affects on es biology will begin to address this issue.

our studies reveal the crucial role for this duplicated region of the rhox cluster in murine es cell biology. it is well documented that es cells derived from mouse, rat and human exhibit markedly different characteristics in terms of their growth requirements and developmental potential  <cit> . the mouse specific duplication of rhox <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and the rodent specific rhox cluster are obvious candidates for mediating these species differences.

CONCLUSIONS
the rhox cluster therefore appears a very plastic region of the rodent genome with the mouse containing twenty more rhox genes than rat and rat containing ten more rhox genes than human. expression in the reproductive tissues and a function for rhox <dig> in male fertility has lead to the hypothesis that the rodent specific cluster may, in part, mediate the higher reproductive capacity of rodents relative to humans. the expanded rhox cluster in the mouse provides a large number of substrates for the generation of evolutionary novelties. this is of particular interest as it has been postulated that both gene duplication and the rapid evolution of reproductive proteins are an important mechanism in speciation  <cit> .
