BACKGROUND
we have found the hotdog domain, as we suggest calling the hotdog fold, to be widespread in eukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea and to be involved in a range of cellular processes, from thioester hydrolysis, to phenylacetic acid degradation and transcriptional regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis. we present the superfamily and its functional subfamilies here. the hotdog fold was first observed in the structure of escherichia coli β-hydroxydecanoyl thiol ester dehydratase , where leesong et al. noticed that each subunit of this dimeric enzyme contained a mixed α + β 'hot dog' fold  <cit> . they described the seven-stranded antiparallel β-sheet as the 'bun', which wraps around a five-turn α-helical 'sausage', see figure  <dig>  this characteristic fold has been found in a number of other enzymes, including: 4-hydroxybenzoyl-coa thioesterase  from pseudomonas sp. strain cbs- <dig>  <cit>  and arthrobacter sp. strain su  <cit> , a novel gentisyl-coa thioesterase from bacillus halodurans  <cit>  and in escherichia coli thioesterase ii  <cit> .

RESULTS
although several proteins are now known to contain a hotdog fold from structural analysis it has not to our knowledge been demonstrated that these proteins can be related to each other by sequence similarity. we have attempted to unify these structurally related proteins using a sequence analysis approach. using sequence analysis means that we will identify additional proteins that are likely to contain a hotdog fold. we have used the psi-blast program  <cit>  and used a representative of each hotdog fold of known structure as a query against swiss-prot and trembl protein database  <cit> . we used the sequences of the following pdb entries: 1c8u  <cit> , 1iq <dig>  <cit> , 1lo <dig>  <cit> , 1mkb  <cit> , 1njk  <cit> , 1o0i  <cit>  and 1psu  <cit> . these searches have uncovered many novel members of this superfamily as well as finding links between the known structures with a hotdog fold .

the pfam database  <cit>  contains a thioesterase superfamily with  <dig> members, each member containing a 4hbt domain  corresponding to the hotdog domain. the scop database  <cit>  contains a thioesterase/thiol ester dehydrase-isomerase superfamily, divided into  <dig> families, namely the 4hbt-like, beta-hydroxydecanoyl thiol ester dehydrase, thioesterase ii , maoc dehydratase and paai/ydii-like families.

our searches have found a total of  <dig> proteins  to be related to the known structures of hotdog domain proteins. we took these proteins and clustered them using single linkage clustering to define subfamilies with common functions. this clustering puts  <dig>  of the sequences into  <dig> clusters . the hotdog domain is found to be associated with a wide range of other domains. the various domain architectures are shown schematically in figure  <dig>  we describe the  <dig> subfamilies  that have some experimental characterisation, below. the  <dig> subfamilies contain  <dig> proteins or  <dig> % of the total number of hotdog domain proteins.  <dig>  proteins cluster into the remaining groups, which contain predominantly hypothetical proteins or proteins that have no known function. they are not discussed here but we hope that our analysis may help in identifying functions for these proteins. finally we have generated a hidden markov model  library by concatenating together the hotdog domain sequences of the  <dig> clusters generated in our analysis . this library can be used in conjunction with the hmmer program  <cit>  to search for hotdog domain in any protein of interest.

acyl-coa thioesterase subfamily
the largest subfamily represents over a hundred acyl-coa thioesterases that are widespread throughout the prokaryotic kingdom, with members also found in eukaryotes. this group of enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of acyl-coa thioesters to free fatty acids and coenzyme a   <cit> . the subfamily includes thioesterases with activity towards medium and long chain acyl-coas  respectively) and also cytoplasmic acetyl-coa hydrolase , which hydrolyzes acetyl-coa to acetate and coa-sh. brown-fat-inducible thioesterase , a cold-induced protein found in brown adipose tissue   <cit>  is also included in this group. both bfit and cach possess a star-related lipid-transfer  domain  <cit>  that is involved in lipid binding, consistent with the role of bfit and cach in lipid metabolism. duplication of the hotdog domain and recruitment of the start domain seems to be a mammalian innovation.

fabz like dehydratase subfamily
members of this subfamily are found in a wide range of bacteria and sporadically in eukaryotes. in e. coli the products of the fab operon catalyze the four sequential reactions necessary for each round of fatty acid elongation  <cit> . the third step in each cycle of fatty acid elongation involves the dehydration of the β-hydroxyacyl-acp protein intermediate by β-hydroxyacyl- dehydratase  to give trans-2-decenoyl-acp. fabz is effective at dehydrating both short-chain and long chain saturated and unsaturated pathway intermediates.

this subfamily also contains a dehydratase component of the coronafacic acid  biosynthetic cluster encoded by the cfa <dig> gene  <cit> . cfa is the polyketide constituent of a phytotoxin called coronatine, which is a virulence factor of pseudomonas syringae, a plant pathogen that causes disease in many agriculturally important plants  <cit> .

maoc dehydratase-like subfamily
the maoc gene exists as an operon with the maoa gene in e. coli and is an enoyl-coa hydratase involved in supplying -3-hydroxyacyl-coa from the fatty acid oxidation pathway to polyhydroxyalkanoate  biosynthetic pathways in fadb mutant e. coli strains. it was identified through its homology to p. aeruginosa -specific enoyl-coa hydratase   <cit> . phas are polyesters of -hydroxyalkanoic acids, synthesized by numerous bacteria as an intracellular carbon and energy storage material in times of excess carbon sources  <cit> , with intermediates of fatty acid metabolism such as enoyl-coa, -3-hydroxyacyl-coa, and 3-ketoacyl-coa acting as precursors for pha biosynthesis  <cit> . the crystal structure of the -specific enoyl-coa hydratase  from the aeromonas caviae has shown that this enzyme also contains a hotdog fold/domain  <cit> . the e. coli maoc c-terminal hotdog domain is most likely responsible for its enoyl-coa hydratase actvity. maoc also contains an n-terminal short-chain dehydrogenase domain, involved in catalysing dehydrogenation of a variety of aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes using nadp as a cofactor. this subfamily also includes the human  <dig> β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase  type  <dig>  one of four different human  <dig> β hsds that catalyze the redox reactions at position c <dig> of steroid molecules, one of the final steps in androgen and estrogen biosynthesis  <cit> . we also include a nodn-like sub-subfamily here that is found in another cluster containing several other maoc proteins. rhizobium and related species form nodules on the roots of their legume hosts, a symbiotic process that requires production of nod factors, which are signal molecules involved in root hair deformation and meristematic cell division  <cit> . the nodulation gene products, including nodn, are involved in producing the nod factors, however the role played by nodn is unclear.

ybgc-like subfamily
this subfamily contains a large number of proteins about which very little is known except for the ybgc protein. the ybgc protein of the tol-pal cluster in the gamma-proteobacterium haemophilus influenzae  <cit>  has been shown to catalyze the hydrolysis of short-chain aliphatic acyl-coa thioesters. the tol-pal cluster is present in many gram-negative bacteria and is important for the maintenance of cell envelope integrity  <cit>  and this operon is well conserved across gram-negative bacteria. therefore we hypothesize that uncharacterized members of this subfamily are thioesterases.

the asp <dig> residue is conserved in ybgc from haemophilus influenzae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, along with the backbone amide nh of tyr <dig>  suggestive of a nucleophilic attack mechanism very similar to the pseudomonas sp. strain cbs- <dig> thioesterase mechanism discussed below in the 4hbt class i section.

faba-like subfamily
the dehydration of the β-hydroxyacyl-acp protein intermediate during the third step in each cycle of fatty acid elongation can be catalyzed by β-hydroxydecanoyl-acp dehydratase/isomerase , as well as by fabz, to give trans-2-decenoyl-acp. faba is uniquely able to isomerise trans-2-decenoyl-acp to cis-3-decenoyl acp, initiating unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis  <cit>  and is specific for acyl acps of 9– <dig> carbons in length.

polyketides are a large and structurally diverse class of natural products, produced mainly by soil-dwelling bacteria such as pseudomonas spp. and streptomyces spp. they include clinically useful drugs such as the antibiotic erythromycin a and the immunosuppressants fk <dig> and rapamycin. the biosythesis of polyketides is very similar to that of fatty acids  <cit>  and polyketide synthases  have been classified as type i or type ii according to fatty acid synthase  similarity. most bacteria and plants use a highly conserved type ii fas system, which uses a distinct enzyme for each reaction. this is in contrast to the mammalian type i system , which uses one multifunctional polypeptide to catalyze all reactions  <cit> . the hotdog domain is found in type ii fatty acid synthesis in bacteria , but also in a small number of bacterial polyketide synthases that are of the type i, being composed of several modules  <cit>  such as β keto-acyl synthases and omega- <dig> polyunsaturated fatty acid synthase . the marine bacteria shewanella sp. scrc- <dig>  moritella marina strain mp- <dig> and photobacterium profundum strain ss <dig> contain an eicosapentaenoic acid  biosynthetic cluster , responsible for the synthesis of this omega- <dig> polunsaturated fatty acid ,  <cit> . the pfac protein contains two hotdog domains , which are also found in the eukaryotic marine protist, schizochytrium, suggesting that the pufa synthetic cluster has undergone lateral gene transfer  <cit> .

this subfamily also includes several fatty acid synthase proteins from bacteria, such as mycobacterium bovis fatty acid synthase. this multifunctional protein is capable of catalysing de novo synthesis and chain elongation of fatty acids  <cit>  and has a very similar domain architecture to the polyunsaturated fatty acid synthases, as it contains an acyl-transferase, β-keto acyl synthase n and c-terminal domains .

the catalytic residues of faba's bifunctional active site are his <dig> and asp <dig>  his <dig> is conserved in fabz dehydratase, but asp <dig> is replaced with glutamate. this replacement may be responsible for fabz's inability to catalyze the isomerization reaction  <cit> .

fat subfamily acyl-acp thioesterases
in plants, fatty acid synthesis occurs in the stroma of plastids, where the acyl chains are bound to the acyl carrier protein  during extension cycles  <cit> . acyl-acp thioesterases terminate fatty acid synthesis in plants by hydrolysing the thioester bond existing between an acyl moiety and the acp  <cit> . in higher plants acyl-acp thioesterases have been classified into two gene classes, fata and fatb, based on sequence similarity and substrate specificities  <cit> . arabidopsis fata displays highest activity towards oleoyl-acp whereas arabidopsis fatb is most active towards palmitoyl-acp  <cit> . this subfamily contains both fata and fatb members  <cit> . the proteins in this subfamily range in length from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids and therefore we hypothesized that they might contain two hotdog domains, located at the n and c teminal halves. by splitting the sequence of proteins from this subfamily into an n-terminal half and c-terminal half we were readily able to detect the relationship to other subfamilies using psi-blast with query proteins such as q899q <dig> and q <dig>  confirming our hypothesis.

tesb-like subfamily
this subfamily contains the e. coli medium chain length acyl-coa thioesterase ii  <cit>  encoded by the tesb gene  <cit> , which is a close homolog of the human thioesterase ii  enzyme. hte catalyzes the hydrolysis of palmitoyl-coa to coa and palmitate and was identified as a human t cell protein that binds to the myristoylated hiv- <dig> nef protein, correlating with nef-mediated cd <dig> down regulation  <cit> . hte could regulate targeting of the cytoplasmic nef protein to the plasma membrane, which is dependent on a lipid modification, i.e. a myristoylation anchor and recombinant hte shows maximal activity with myristoyl-coa  <cit> . however further studies have shown that hte localizes to peroxisomes  <cit> , dependent on a c-terminal peroxisomal targeting sequence, skl, and coexpression of nef and hte results in relocation of nef to peroxisomes, so the role of nef and hte during hiv infection remains unsolved.

the catalytic site of e. coli thioesterase ii was identified by site directed mutagenesis and involves a hydrogen-bonded triad of asp <dig>  thr  <dig>  and gln  <dig>  which synergistically activate a water molecule for nucleophilic attack of the carbonyl thioester carbon of medium chain length acyl-coa substrates  <cit> . this is a novel reaction mechanism for a thioesterase and differs from the nucleophilic mechanisms used by β-hydroxydecanoyl dehydratase and 4hbt thioesterase in both pseudomonas and arthrobacter discussed below. this subfamily is found in bacteria and eukaryotes.

4hbt class ii subfamily
this subfamily includes 4-hydroxybenzoyl coa thioesterase  from arthrobacter sp. strains su and tm <dig> encoded by the fcbc gene  <cit> . the pseudomonas thioesterase uses the asp <dig> residue to mediate the hydrolysis reaction as discussed below in the 4hbt class i section. gln <dig> from arthrobacter corresponds to the asp <dig> residue in pseudomonas but inspection of the arthrobacter strain su active site has revealed the catalytic base  to be glu <dig>  on the opposite side of the substrate binding pocket to asp <dig> <cit> . also the pseudomonas thioesterase dimers form a tetramer with their long α-helices facing inwards, in contrast to arthrobacter thioesterase where the dimers form a tetramer with their long α-helices facing outwards  <cit> . in pseudomonas and arthrobacter thioesterases, the 4-hydroxyphenacyl moieties are positioned in such an orientation that the thioester c = o interacts with the α-helical n-terminus by means of hydrogen bonding to a backbone amide nh, on tyr <dig> in pseudomonas and gly <dig> in arthrobacter, and it is this contact that results in polarization of the c = o for nucleophilic attack  <cit> . while the structure of arthrobacter sp. strain su thioesterase displays a similar hotdog-fold topology to the 4hbt class i pseudomonas enzyme, the enzymes differ at the level of catalytic platform, coa binding site and quaternary structure  <cit> . this is not an unexpected finding as todd et al. have found that  <dig> of the  <dig> superfamilies they analyzed displayed positional variation for residues playing equivalent catalytic roles  <cit> .

a surprising inclusion in this subfamily is the coma <dig> protein from bacillus subtilis. coma is a response regulator and transcription factor  <cit>  that together with the histidine kinase, comp, constitutes a two-component signal transduction system required for the development of competence. the coma locus is composed of two orfs. coma <dig> is cotranscribed with coma <dig>  which is required for competence while coma <dig> is not  <cit> , and so the role of the hotdog domain in this protein remains a mystery.

paai subfamily
the phenylacetic acid  catabolic pathway in e. coli has been characterised and found to contain  <dig> genes, allowing catabolism of this aromatic compound into likely krebs cycle intermediates  <cit> . the paa operon in e. coli encodes paai, which is probably a thioesterase involved in the catabolism of pa. the catabolism of phenylacetic acid  in e. coli begins with an activation step where phenylacetyl-coa ligase, paak, converts phenylacetate into phenylacetyl-coa. 4-chlorobenzoate-coa ligase catalyzes a similar reaction at the first step of the 4-chlorobenzoate-degradation pathway. the thioesterase, paai, may be involved in a reaction similar to the last step in the degradation of 4-chlorobenzoate , however this remains to be demonstrated.

fapr subfamily
this small subfamily is restricted to firmicutes. fapr is a highly conserved transcriptional regulator found in many gram-positive organisms, including all species of bacillus  <cit> . it controls expression of genes involved in type ii fatty acid and phospholipid biosynthesis, by binding to a consensus promoter sequence of the fap regulon and acting as a negative regulator. malonyl-coa, an intermediate in the lipid biosynthetic pathway, controls fapr. the hotdog domain has likely retained its substrate specificity for malonyl-coa, but appears to have lost its catalytic ability, in common with the ligand binding domain of other transcriptional regulators. fapr contains a helix-turn-helix motif at the n-terminus , which is similar to the deor transcriptional regulator family , consistent with its role as a dna binding protein.

4hbt class i subfamily
the crystal structure of 4hbt from the soil-inhabiting bacterium pseudomonas sp. strain cbs- <dig>  <cit>  has helped define the hotdog domain. a lot of attention has been focused on this microorganism because of its ability to survive on 4-chlorobenzoate  as its only source of carbon  <cit> . 4cba is a by-product of microbial degradation of industrial pollutants such as ddt and polychlorinated biphenyl herbicides  <cit>  and this strain of pseudomonas may be used as a bioremediation agent for degrading 4cba. pseudomonas sp. strain cbs- <dig> contains an fcb operon responsible for hydrolytic dechlorination of 4cba, with 4cba-coa ligase , 4cba-coa dehalogenase , and 4hbt  catalyzing sequential reactions that result in the degradation of 4cba to 4-hydroxybenzoate. the thioesterase catalyzes the third step in the degradation pathway, which is the hydrolysis of the 4-hydroxybenzoyl-coa thioester moiety to give 4-hydroxybenzoate and coa  <cit> .

4hbt from pseudomonas sp. strain dj- <dig>  <cit>  is also found in this subfamily. the organization of the fcb operon in strain dj- <dig> is different from that observed in strain cbs- <dig>  the fcb genes are organised as b-a-c in both strains but strain dj- <dig> has three orfs between a and c called t <dig>  t <dig>  and t <dig> that are unique to this strain. these three genes are similar to the c4-dicarboxylate transport system in rhodobacter capsulatus, suggesting that they may encode membrane proteins involved in the uptake of 4cba  <cit> . this is in contrast to the gene organisation observed in the 4hbt class ii, where arthrobacter sp. strain su and strain tm <dig> have an a-b-c order  <cit> . there is a duplication of the cluster in strain su, where it is found on a plasmid, whereas only one copy exists in strain tm <dig>  where it is located chromosomally. both operons contain a t gene located at the end of the cluster, possibly involved in 4cba uptake.

bacillus halodurans c- <dig> contains a gene called bh <dig>  encoding a novel gentisyl-coa thioesterase, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of gentisyl-coa  <cit>  to yield gentisate . bh <dig> is found in a gentisate oxidation pathway gene cluster in b. halodurans. gentisate has been implicated as an intermediate in the degradation of several industrial aromatic compounds  <cit> .

gentisyl-coa thioesterase and 4hbt from pseudomonas perform different physiological functions but remain in the same subfamily because they are highly related. the active site residues asp <dig> and asp <dig> of gentisyl-coa thioesterase align with asp <dig> and asp <dig> of 4hbt. these are crucial residues that are proposed to function in nucleophilic catalysis and substrate binding respectively. loss of asp <dig> in the pseudomonas enzyme effectively halts catalysis, while loss of the corresponding asp <dig> residue to the bacillus halodurans enzyme only reduces its catalytic rate by 230-fold, perhaps indicating that the hydrolysis reaction does not proceed through an asp16-mediated nucleophilic attack mechanism previously proposed for asp <dig>  <cit> . asp <dig> in pseudomonas strain cbs- <dig> has been suggested to participate in nucleophilic catalysis rather than general base catalysis based on the following observations. the asp <dig> carboxylate is located at a distance of  <dig>  Å from the substrate c = o thioester bond, its aligned trajectory and the absence of a water molecule near the reaction centre are all suggestive of a role for asp <dig> as a catalytic nucleophile  <cit> . asp <dig> in pseudomonas interacts with the benzoyl oh of 4-hydroxybenzoyl-coa  <cit>  and perhaps asp <dig> plays a similar role.

other subfamilies/ members
in the above sections we have described the  <dig> subfamilies that have some functional characterization. in this section we describe the other  <dig> subfamilies that have no functional characterization, except they are associated with other domains or have been structurally characterized.

the cbs associated subfamily contains the hypothetical protein bh <dig> from bacillus halodurans. the bh <dig> protein contains two homologous copies of the cbs domain  <cit> . scott et al. have recently shown that tandem pairs of cbs domains act as sensors of cellular energy status by binding amp, atp, or s-adenosyl methionine and mutations in cbs domains impair this binding in several hereditary disorders  <cit> . although we do not know the substrate or activity of this subfamily of the hotdog superfamily, we can suggest that this step is regulated in an energy dependent manner by the cbs domains.

3-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydrogenase is an enzyme involved in fatty acid metabolism, catalyzing the reduction of 3-hydroxyacyl-coa to 3-oxoacyl-coa  <cit> . the hydroxyacyl-coa dehydrogenase-associated subfamily includes 3-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydrogenase from agrobacterium tumefaciens strain c <dig>  which contains a hotdog domain at its c-terminus and the two domains  associated with 3-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydrogenase activity are located at the n-terminus and central portion of this protein. the combination of activities may allow substrate to be passed from one domain to the next.

other subfamilies in the superfamily include the yiid protein from e. coli, where an acetyltransferase domain is fused. the human mesenchymal stem cell protein dscd <dig> and its counterpart in mouse also contain a hotdog domain. a structural proteomics project has shown that the conserved hypothetical e. coli protein ybaw contains a hotdog fold  <cit> . finally the ralstonia solanacearum hypothetical protein rsp <dig>  containing a hotdog domain and two amp-binding domains, found in proteins involved in atp-dependent covalent binding of amp to their substrate, is a member of another subfamily.

domain fusion events
it has been shown that proteins that are functionally linked are occasionally found to be fused in various genomes. these fusion proteins have been termed rosetta proteins  <cit>  and can be used to predict the functional linkages of proteins with each other. the hotdog domain superfamily contains several rosetta proteins where the fused proteins are also found unfused in other genomes. in these cases they are adjacent to each other in known operons. the examples found in the hotdog superfamily are shown in figure  <dig> and are described briefly here.

within the fabz subfamily the lpxc deacetylase domain  is fused to the fabz-like hotdog domain in chlorobium tepidium . lpxc catalyzes the n-deacetylation of udp-3-o-acyl n-acetylglucosamine deacetylase, the second and committed step in the biosynthesis of lipid a, which anchors lipopolysaccharide  in the outer membranes of most gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . the unfused proteins are found adjacent in operons from several species of chlamydia and cyanobacteria.

in the 4hbt class ii subfamily we observed the order of the operon is ligase-dehalogenase-thioesterase. in bacteroides thetaiotaomicron there is a rosetta protein that contans a haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase domain . this domain architecture is similar to the fcb operon structure in arthrobacter, with a dehalogenase-like hydrolase  domain and a hotdog domain  i.e. it represents a fusion of the fcbb and fcbc gene products to form a novel protein in b. thetaiotaomicron.

the final domain fusion is in the 3-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydrogenase from agrobacterium tumefaciens strain c <dig>  which possesses the hotdog domain, 3hcdh_n domain  and 3hcdh  domain . this may represent a fusion of the paac and pp <dig> proteins in the gamma-proteobacterium pseudomonas putida  <dig> phenylacetic acid degradation operon.

these fusion events suggest that the domain fusion process can occur in a simple scheme with two distinct phases. firstly, two proteins are recombined into adjacent positions in an operon. secondly, the two genes are then fused by a process of mutation that removes the stop codon at the end of the first gene and maintains reading frame through the second gene  <cit> .

sequence motifs
the masia program  <cit>  was used to search for hotdog domain motifs in the aligned sequences of the  <dig> subfamilies. the various motifs are found in additional file 5
. it must also be noted that the prosite database release  <dig>   <cit>  contains a consensus sequence motif , called the 4-hydroxybenzoyl-coa thioesterase family active site, and this is found in  <dig> swiss-prot, trembl and trembl-new entries cross-referenced with ps <dig>  this consensus pattern, --x--d-x-g -v-x--x-, where d is the active site residue, is found in the ybgc-like subfamily and in the 4hbt-i subfamily.  <dig> of the  <dig> members are found in the ybgc-like group and  <dig> in the smaller 4hbt-i group. the remaining  <dig> proteins are scattered in various clusters consisting of hypothetical or unknown proteins. we have found, using masia, that this motif is found in the entire ybgc and 4hbt-i subfamilies, extending the number of proteins containing this motif to  <dig>  we have also identified a hgg motif in the 4hbt-ii and paai subfamilies. this motif is hggas-x-alae in the 4hbt-ii subfamily and hgg-x-if-x-lad in paai members. the active site residue, glu <dig>  is known for 4-hydroxybenzoyl-coa thioesterase from arthrobacter sp. strain su, however the active site for e. coli paai is not known and we suggest that it is asp <dig> in the hgg motif above, which is  <dig> % conserved in all members of this subfamily .

CONCLUSIONS
we have defined and analyzed the hotdog domain superfamily and in our analysis of this superfamily we have found  <dig> different domain architectures and defined  <dig> subfamiles. we have also investigated the domain organisation and the role that this plays in generating functionally diverse enzymatic and nonenzymatic functions based on the hotdog fold. domain duplication, domain recruitment and incremental mutation have been key to the evolution of this superfamily. we have also looked at gene context and operon structures and found many examples of fusion proteins, in which the hotdog domain has been fused to another protein to generate functional diversity. the large number of subfamilies we have found, the diverse range of activities these proteins participate in and the taxonomic distribution of the hotdog domain indicates an ancient superfamily that has diverged substantially to fulfil numerous roles in the cell.

our analysis may help with further experimental investigation of members of this superfamily. some members of this superfamily, such as the p. falciparium fabz enzyme have been proposed as a target for new anti-malarial drugs  <cit>  as fabz homologues are not found in humans. finally our analysis identified hundreds of novel proteins such as human mesenchymal stem cell protein dscd <dig> and the ralstonia solanacearum hypothetical protein rsp <dig> as probable enzymes potentially involved in lipid metabolism. given that the large majority of proteins in this family are involved in bacterial lipid metabolism we suggest that the hotdog domain evolved in bacteria first and may then have been transferred to eukaryotes and archaea on several occasions. since this time duplication and mutation has allowed it to fill a variety of roles.
