BACKGROUND
transforming growth factor-β  is the prototype member of a superfamily of growth factors that includes activins, bone morphogenic proteins , inhibins, growth and differentiation factors , and glial derived neurotrophic factor   <cit> . tgf-β is widely distributed in both embryonic and adult tissues and regulates cell proliferation and differentiation, extracellular matrix production, wound healing, immune function, apoptosis, angiogenesis, chemotaxis and hematopoiesis. many human diseases, including certain forms of cancer as well as fibrotic and inflammatory disorders, have alterations in the tgf-β signaling pathway . recently, tgf-β has also been implicated in alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions  <cit> .

in mammals, tgf-β has three closely related isoforms, tgf-β <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  which share 70% sequence identity but exhibit different functions in vivo . the biological functions of tgf-β are mediated through a high-affinity transmembrane receptor complex consisting of tgf-β type i  and type ii serine/threonine kinase receptor subunits . upon binding of the ligand, alk <dig> recruits and phosphorylates receptor-regulated smad <dig> or smad <dig>  which then form heteromeric complexes with smad <dig> and translocate into the nucleus, where together with other transcription factors they regulate gene transcription  <cit> . smad <dig> binds directly to dna via a conserved smad-binding element  that consists of one or more caga boxes  <cit> . this caga box is present in an estimated  <dig> target genes for tgf-β in mammals  <cit> . smad <dig> normally does not bind to dna, although an alternatively spliced form of smad <dig>  which lacks exon  <dig>  can bind with high affinity to sbe and appears to be present in many cell types  <cit> . activins, nodal, growth and differentiation factor -8/myostatin, gdf- <dig>  and gdf- <dig> also signal via smad2/ <dig> proteins by engaging activin receptors or alk <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, bmps recruit smad <dig>  smad <dig>  and smad <dig> in combination with smad <dig> after binding to bmp type i and type ii receptors  <cit> . in addition, signaling of tgf-β s and related factors is regulated by crosstalk with other signaling pathways including map kinase, jak/stat, and wnt pathways .

tgf-β is secreted as a latent pro-peptide, and does not signal unless activated. activation in vivo is still poorly understood and can involve integrins, thrombospondin, metalloproteases, plasmin, furin and other proteases  <cit> . bioactive tgf-β peptides are rapidly inactivated in living cells and consequently, bioactive tgf-β peptides are usually not detectable in tissues, body fluids, or supernatants from cultured cells. however, latent tgf-β in such samples can be "activated" with acids, heat, or other methods  <cit> . to measure levels of bioactive tgf-β in activated samples, several assays including wound healing and growth inhibition assays or reporter gene assays have been developed  <cit> , but many of these assays are cumbersome and complicated or can be influenced by other growth factors present in the samples. currently one of the most frequently used bioassays is based on a mink lung cell line  stably transfected with a plasminogen activator inhibitor- <dig>  promoter fused to luciferase  <cit> . tmlc cells have also been used in coculture with other cells to measure their tgf-β production  <cit> . in this paradigm, tmlc cells seem to measure tgf-β activated via integrins  <cit> . a disadvantage of the tmlc cells however, is that they can be induced by other growth factors present in the samples  <cit> .

here we describe a new bioassay that is specific for tgf-βs, is sensitive and reproducible and allows for repeated measurements of the same sample in induced reporter cells. we stably transfected mouse embryonic fibroblasts from tgfb1-/- mice with a synthetic promoter element containing twelve caga boxes  <cit> , fused to a secreted alkaline phosphatase  reporter gene. clone mfb-f <dig> showed up to  <dig> fold induction with  <dig> ng/ml tgf-β <dig>  and showed a linear response to tgf-β <dig> from  <dig> pg/ml to  <dig> ng/ml. tgf-β <dig>  tgf-β <dig> and tgf-β <dig> but not other related tgf-β family members activated the reporter gene in these cells. we demonstrate that this new cell line can be used to quantitatively measure tgf-β bioactivity from body fluids, tissues and cell culture supernatants. importantly, mfb-f <dig> cells can detect tgf-β bioactivity directly from other cells in co-culture systems.

RESULTS
generation of sbe-seap reporter cells to measure tgf-β signaling
to measure tgf-β bioactivity from cell culture supernatants or biological fluids rapidly, specifically, and with high sensitivity we developed a new cell-based reporter assay. we used a fibroblast cell line isolated from mouse tgfb1-/- embryos , which showed low background and high induction of the sbe-seap reporter during transient transfections. the sbe-seap reporter plasmid was generated from a previously described sbe-luciferase plasmid  <cit>  by replacing firefly luciferase with seap. the seap protein is secreted into the medium, and allows multiple measurements from the same culture.

mfb cells were stably transfected with sbe-seap and a total of  <dig> stably-transfected colonies were examined for induction of reporter activity by tgf-β <dig>  out of  <dig> clones with strong induction, clone mfb-f <dig> showed the highest and most consistent activity with relatively low background levels . clones that showed induction at passage  <dig> were retested after 9– <dig> passages . clone mfb-f <dig> was not only the most inducible but also the most stable clone, and was still inducible without significant loss of sensitivity after more than  <dig> passages .

mfb-f <dig> cells can measure as low as  <dig> pg/ml tgf-β1
to further characterize mfb-f <dig> cells, we assayed induction of reporter activity using a broad range of tgf-β <dig> concentrations at different cell densities. higher cell densities showed a better induction with tgf-β <dig> concentrations in the ng/ml range , whereas  <dig>  cells/well in a 96-well tissue culture plate seemed to work best with tgf-β <dig> concentrations between  <dig> and  <dig> pg/ml . at  <dig>  cells/well mfb-f <dig> showed a significant 2-fold induction with only  <dig> pg/ml tgf-β <dig> in the presence of b <dig> supplement, which provides the cells with additional nutrients when cultured in serum free medium , and the response was linear up to  <dig> ng/ml tgf-β <dig>  at this concentration the reporter was induced more than  <dig> fold . higher cell densities did not further increase induction and usually resulted in lower induction . tmlc cells, which have been widely used to measure tgf-β activity in cell culture, showed a similar dose-dependent response to tgf-β <dig>  in our hands however, the maximal fold induction was higher in mfb-f <dig> cells .

mfb-f <dig> cells specifically measure tgf-β <dig>  tgf-β <dig> and tgf-β3
to examine whether mfb-f <dig> cells would also respond to growth factors other than tgf-β <dig>  we tested induction of seap activity with tgf-β <dig>  tgf-β <dig>  nodal, activin b, bmp <dig>  bmp <dig>  gdnf and bfgf. the closely related tgf-β <dig> family members tgf-β <dig> and tgf-β <dig> induced seap activity in mfb-f <dig> cells in a dose-dependent manner . in contrast, nodal, activin b, bmp <dig>  bmp <dig>  bdnf and bfgf did not induce seap acitivity, even at high concentrations  or after  <dig> or  <dig> h induction . the latter also did not induce seap reporter activity when added together with different amounts of recombinant tgf-β <dig>  tgf-β <dig> or tgf-β <dig> . taken together these results suggest that mfb-f <dig> cells respond specifically to tgf-βs.

mfb-f11cells measure tgf-βs from biological samples
to determine the use of mfb-f <dig> cells in measuring tgf-β from biological samples, we tested mouse serum, mouse brain extract and conditioned medium from mca-7777rh liver cells  or chinese hamster ovary  cells . after activation of presumably latent tgf-β with acid all samples were able to strongly induce reporter activity in mfb-f <dig> cells . co-incubation of activated samples with a tgf-β neutralizing antibody nearly completely inhibited induction , demonstrating that mfb-f <dig> cells specifically measure tgf-β activity in biological samples. samples that were not activated with acid did not induce reporter activity  consistent with the presence of tgf-β in a latent form in biological samples  <cit> .

to determine the use of mfb-f <dig> cells in measuring biologically activated tgf-β, we co-cultured them with other cell types. co-culture with mca-7777rh cells  or b <dig> cells  resulted in significant induction of seap activity. the relative activity detected in this co-culture system was lower than what was measured in acid activated conditioned medium of the same cells , suggesting that part of the secreted tgf-β is in a latent form and cannot be detected by mfb-f <dig> cells.

taken together these data demonstrate that mfb-f <dig> cells can be used to specifically measure tgf-β <dig>  tgf-β <dig> and tgf-β <dig> activities with high sensitivity in biological samples.

discussion
in this study we describe the generation of a stably transfected tgf-b1-/- fibroblast cell line , which provides a specific, sensitive, reproducible and convenient bioassay for the quantification of tgf-βs in biological samples from different species.

the major advantages of the presented method over previous tgf-β bioassays are the high sensitivity and specificity of mfb-f <dig> cells for tgf-βs. mfb-f <dig> cells can reliably measure as little as  <dig> pg/ml tgf-β <dig> and their linear range extends well beyond  <dig> pg/ml , whereas a typical tgf-β <dig> elisa measures between 32– <dig> pg/ml tgf-β <dig>  <cit> . although the mfb-f <dig> assay and tmlc luciferase assay measure tgf-β <dig> with the same sensitivity at the lower end  <cit> , the fold induction of the mfb-f <dig> assay compare favorably to the tmlc luciferase assay. this increased dynamic range and higher fold induction could be the result of an increased stability or accumulation of the seap protein in the medium. another disadvantage of the luciferase assay is that it requires lysis and harvesting of cells, whereas the seap assay only requires  <dig> μl of cell culture medium to measure induction. as removal of a small part of cell culture medium is non invasive, it also allows sequential measurements of induction in the same cells. in addition, the cell pellet can be used to measure other biochemical parameters.

the second advantage of our assay is the specificity of mfb-f <dig> cells for tgf-βs. smad proteins play a key role in the intracellular signaling of tgf-βs and its closely related family members. smad <dig> and smad <dig> transduce signals from tgf-βs, activins, nodal, inhibins and gdf <dig> to the nucleus, whereas smad <dig> and smad <dig> are the intracellular signaling components of bmps and gdf <dig> signaling . smad <dig> and smad <dig>  but not smad <dig> or smad <dig> were shown to bind to sbe  <cit> , which was used to generate the sbe-seap reporter construct present in the mfb-f <dig> cells. interestingly, both nodal and activin do not activate the reporter in the mfb-f <dig> cells . this is in contrast with signaling in sbe-luciferase primary astrocytes, where both activin and nodal were able to induce luciferase reporter activity  <cit> , and in tmlc cells, where other growth factors were able to induce reporter activity, either alone or in combination with tgf-βs  <cit> . it is possible that mfb-f <dig> cells lack some of the receptors necessary for activin and nodal signaling. the differences in specificity between the tmlc and mfb-f <dig> cells could also be due to differences in promoter elements preceding the reporter gene. mfb-f <dig> cells contain a minimal 12-repeat caga box, which has been described to only respond to smad-mediated signaling  <cit> , whereas the tmlc cells contain a pai- <dig> promoter element, which is able to bind additional transcription factors  <cit> . in any case, both the absence of reporter induction by tgf-β related factors , as well as by biological samples treated with pan-specific tgf-β neutralizing antibodies , demonstrates the high specificity of mfb-f <dig> cells for tgf-βs. in addition the mfb-f <dig> bioassay is valid across species and can measure tgf-βs from human , mouse, rat  and hamster .

the third advantage of our assay is that it can measure biologically active tgf-β secreted by cells . most cells secrete tgf-βs as inactive complexes, although freshly isolated lps-stimulated murine peritoneal macrophages were able to activate tgf-βs  <cit> . in tmlc cells, co-culture with a different cell type resulted in activation of the reporter when β 6-integrin was overexpressed in the co-cultured cell line  <cit> . in contrast, mfb-f <dig> cells were able to detect tgf-β activity from two different co-cultured cell lines without further manipulations. it is important to note that induction of seap-activity via co-culture was lower than induction via acid-activation of conditioned medium from the same cells , indicating that mfb-f <dig> cells were able to detect only a portion of secreted tgf-βs. the fact that we did not observe seap induction in non-acid treated conditioned medium, but only in co-culture suggests that cell-cell contact or close proximity is required for biological activation of secreted tgf-βs. biologically active tgf-β could be associated with the cell membrane  <cit>  or secreted in such low amounts that it needs to be secreted immediately adjacent to the reporter cell to be detectable and secretion into conditioned medium could dilute or inactivate tgf-βs.

CONCLUSIONS
we generated a new bioassay that can measure physiological amounts of tgf-β present in biological samples in a highly sensitive, specific, reproducible, and convenient way without the need for prior enrichment of tgf-βs in the samples. besides quantifying tgf-β this bioassay can also be used to study tgf-β signaling and to rapidly identify new endogenous or pharmaceutical modifiers of the tgf-β signaling pathway in the absence of tgf-β <dig>
