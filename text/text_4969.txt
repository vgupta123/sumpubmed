BACKGROUND
many rust resistance genes are known in wheat but only a few provide durable, race non-specific resistance to multiple pathogens  <cit> . the most widely deployed and best characterised of these genes, lr <dig>  confers durable, adult plant resistance  to leaf rust caused by puccinia triticina, stripe rust caused by puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici and powdery mildew caused by blumeria graminis <cit> . lr <dig> resistance to each pathogen is partial while a second phenotype, so called leaf tip necrosis which involves necrosis of the tips of flag leaves, is also a characteristic of this gene  <cit> . more recently, lr <dig> was described which has similar characteristics to lr <dig> in that it also confers leaf tip necrosis and provides partial, broad spectrum, adult plant resistance to leaf rust and stripe rust  <cit> . based on this phenotypic similarity lr <dig> is predicted to also provide durable rust resistance, although this remains inconclusive as the gene has not yet been deployed over long periods of time and across a diverse range of germplasm and environments.

when lr <dig> and lr <dig> were transferred from landraces into the leaf rust susceptible wheat variety ‘thatcher’ , leaf rust resistant backcross lines also acquired resistance to stem rust  at both seedling and adult plant stages  <cit> . seedling tests revealed that this stem rust resistance was probably race specific in contrast to the race non-specific responses of lr <dig> and lr <dig> to leaf rust and stripe rust. further studies demonstrated that unlinked genetic loci interacted with lr <dig> to enable the expression of stem rust resistance in thatcher and thatcher derivatives  <cit> .

in this study, the wheat line thatcher was used as a common genetic background for the identification and comparison of mutant phenotypes in the lr <dig> and lr <dig> genes, respectively. previous analysis of six lr <dig> mutants in the wheat line rl <dig>  a near-isogenic line of thatcher with lr <dig>  confirmed that a single gene encoding a putative atp-binding cassette transporter protein was responsible for lr <dig> resistance to leaf rust, stripe rust and stem rust  <cit> . we have isolated two additional rl <dig> lr <dig> mutants and, in conjunction with the six previously identified mutants, undertaken a detailed characterisation of their response to stripe rust and stem rust infection under field conditions and in response to leaf rust at the seedling stage when grown under controlled conditions. four thatcher lr <dig> mutants were also identified which also showed a range of rust infection phenotypes closely resembling those of lr <dig> mutants, further supporting a mechanistic similarity between these two genes.

RESULTS
characterisation of lr <dig> mutant phenotypes
six sodium azide induced lr <dig> mutants  were previously reported that were susceptible to leaf rust, stripe rust and stem rust  <cit> . these mutants carried independent, single nucleotide substitutions resulting in either incorrect splicing of lr <dig> transcripts or changes in predicted amino acid sequence of the putative abc transporter protein encoded by this gene . these mutants also lost the leaf tip necrosis phenotype associated with the wild type gene. the response of these mutants to stripe rust infection was examined in three field seasons at cobbitty, australia. hitherto undetected, subtle phenotypic differences between mutants were noted with mutant 4c showing a partial loss of resistance  when compared with fully susceptible thatcher  and resistant wild type rl <dig>  lines. mutant 2f developed more pustules on flag leaves earlier than thatcher or other mutants while the remaining mutants were visually indistinguishable from thatcher.

two additional mutants  were included in the third field season and flag leaf tissue was sampled from all eight mutants to quantify the stripe rust biomass accumulated at or near anthesis. fungal biomass was quantified using the lectin wheat germ agglutinin , which specifically binds to chitin, conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate  and leaf tissue was processed such that the levels of fluorescence detected in each sample were equivalent to the amount of chitin present  <cit> . the results from the chitin assay confirmed field observations with mutant 4c showing an intermediate stripe rust resistance phenotype by accumulating  <dig>  fold more chitin than the resistant wild type rl <dig> but only half as much chitin as the susceptible thatcher parent .

similarly, mutant 4g, which showed partial susceptibility to stripe rust in the field, contained an intermediate level of chitin accumulation relative to the parental genotypes. visual observations in the field did not distinguish mutant 2g from the susceptible thatcher parent, however, a 30% reduction in chitin accumulation was observed which likely reflects the sensitivity of the chitin assay over empirical visual observations. in contrast, mutant 2f accumulated more chitin biomass than all other mutant lines and the susceptible thatcher parent consistent with having an enhanced susceptibility to stripe rust infection. the remaining mutants accumulated chitin levels between the susceptible parent and the hyper-susceptible 2f mutant reflecting the increased variability in fungal infection between susceptible lines.

a loss of field resistance to stem rust was also observed in these mutant lines during two seasons in australia. rl <dig> was highly resistant  while thatcher was partially susceptible to stem rust . mutants were similar to thatcher in their response to stem rust without apparent differences between mutants.

the response of these mutants to leaf rust infection was examined in seedlings grown under low temperature conditions  <cit> . the macroscopic rust infection phenotypes of mutants were observed at three time points and scored visually. three mutants  were fully susceptible and gave a similar response to the susceptible thatcher parent . two mutants, 2g and 4c, had an intermediate phenotype being more resistant than thatcher but more susceptible than the wild type parent rl <dig>  mutant 2f produced pustules earlier than thatcher consistent with the hyper-susceptible phenotype of this mutant to stripe rust under field conditions.

to examine and quantify differences between the mutants in more detail, the infection process of leaf rust was studied microscopically after staining fungal structures with wga-fitc  <cit> . mutants were ranked in three separate experiments based on the area of infection hyphae which developed at randomly selected infection sites in first or second leaves 10 days post inoculation . mean leaf rust infection site areas were larger in 2g and 4c leaves compared to wild type rl <dig>  but smaller than thatcher and the fully susceptible mutants 2b, 3e and 4e. these observations are consistent with the intermediate response of 2g and 4c recorded visually. infection site areas were largest in mutant 2f and larger than in thatcher in two experiments. the infection site areas of a resistant sib from the same m <dig> family were similar to wild type confirming that the observed phenotype of 2f was largely due to the mutation found within the lr <dig> gene and unlikely to be the result of accumulated background mutations . although there was variation between lines in rust infection site areas, the ranking of partial and fully susceptible categories remained the same across the three experiments. the lack of significant differences between mutant 2f and fully susceptible mutants was due to the large within-line variance observed for infection sites. within-line variability probably also contributed to rank changes within the fully susceptible category.

mutants were ranked in each experiment according to mean infection site area.

in summary, the leaf rust results from microscopic and macroscopic studies are in accordance with results obtained for stripe rust using field observations and fungal biomass quantification consistent with these mutants encoding heritable differences in their level of susceptibility to these pathogens. however, no detectable differences between mutants were observed in response to infection by stem rust.

relating phenotypic differences to mutations in dna sequence
single nucleotide transition events , characteristic of sodium azide mutagenesis, were present in the lr <dig> putative abc transporter gene in each of the eight mutants   <cit> . three categories of mutants were identified. four mutants  encoded nonsense mutations in the lr <dig> orf and are predicted to produce truncated and probably non-functional proteins. the responses to stripe rust and leaf rust infection of these mutants were indistinguishable from the susceptible thatcher parent. three mutants  encoded missense mutations that result in single changes within highly conserved amino acids of the predicted first or second nucleotide binding domain of the protein . all three mutants showed an intermediate accumulation of stripe rust chitin in flag leaves compared with the parental lines, while seedlings of mutants 2g and 4c were also partially susceptible to leaf rust. the hyper-susceptible mutant 2f encoded a mutation at the 3′ splice site of intron  <dig> resulting in transcripts encoding the predicted wild type protein and alternative transcripts lacking exon  <dig> , encoding a protein with part of the second transmembrane domain deleted . this mutant was more susceptible to stripe rust and accumulated the highest level of stripe rust biomass in flag leaves under field conditions, in addition to showing enhanced seedling susceptibility to leaf rust at the seedling stage.

isolation and characterisation of lr <dig> mutants
four stripe rust susceptible mutants were isolated from m <dig> families after treating rl <dig>  seed with sodium azide. these putative mutants were progeny tested in the field as m <dig> and m <dig> rows to confirm the loss of stripe rust resistance. m <dig> rows were scored at two field sites where mutant m <dig>  was more susceptible to stripe rust than thatcher  at both sites . chitin quantification also showed that m <dig> accumulated more stripe rust in flag leaves at anthesis than other mutants . the level of susceptibility of the other mutants, m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig>  was similar to thatcher in the field although m <dig> and m <dig> contained less stripe rust in flag leaves than thatcher.

the effect of lr <dig> on resistance to stem rust was also recorded. rl <dig>  produced fewer pustules under field conditions than the moderately resistant/susceptible thatcher line  . mutants m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> were moderately resistant/susceptible and similar to thatcher, but m <dig>  which was more susceptible to stripe rust, was also more susceptible to stem rust  than the other mutants . the lr <dig> donor line pi  <dig> was fully susceptible to stem rust  indicating that lr <dig> alone was insufficient to confer stem rust resistance and that the stem rust resistance present in the thatcher backcross derivative, rl <dig>  was due to interaction of lr <dig> with other gene present in this genotype. lr <dig> mutants were also susceptible to leaf rust although the field infection was more variable than for stripe rust and stem rust. several attempts to induce a resistance response to leaf rust in seedlings when grown at low temperature failed in rl <dig>  in contrast to rl <dig>  rl <dig> was fully susceptible to leaf rust under these conditions. leaf tip necrosis which was associated with lr <dig> was also lacking in these mutant lines.

comparison of lr <dig> with lr67
the resistance response of isogenic lr <dig> and lr <dig> lines to stripe rust and stem rust was similar, although in some field trials lr <dig> resistance was marginally stronger. previous studies also reported that field leaf rust resistance conferred by lr <dig> was more effective than lr <dig> <cit> . the response to stripe rust infection revealed differences amongst both lr <dig> and lr <dig> mutants. mutations within the lr <dig> gene produced partial, full and hyper-susceptible mutants. a hyper-susceptible mutant was also recovered amongst lr <dig> mutants and the quantification of fungal biomass suggested that partially susceptible mutants may have also been found but their phenotype was indistinguishable from other mutants under field conditions. an important difference between lr <dig> and lr <dig> was the lack of seedling resistance to leaf rust in rl <dig> when grown under low temperature conditions. under field conditions, both genes confer resistance to stripe rust, leaf rust and stem rust. independent lr <dig> mutants provided proof that a putative abc transporter gene was responsible  <cit> . having been unable to separate the resistances to the different pathogens by mutation, we hypothesise that a single gene encoded by lr <dig> is also responsible for resistance to the three rust pathogens in rl <dig> 

discussion
different mutations within the lr <dig> gene were associated with different levels of susceptibility to stripe rust and leaf rust. mutants encoding single amino acid substitutions in the first or second nucleotide binding domain of the predicted protein showed only a partial loss of resistance suggesting that transport activity of the protein was compromised but not abolished, in contrast to fully susceptible mutants with predicted complete loss of protein function. mutants that are expected to produce a severely truncated or non-functional protein were as susceptible as thatcher, which encodes a predicted full length protein that varies by only two amino acid residues from lr <dig>  <cit> . these data imply that the protein encoded by the thatcher allele may be non-functional and does not confer a basal level of resistance required for normal plant growth and development. the hypothesis requires further investigation given the level of variability in infection between thatcher and fully susceptible lines across experiments. the hyper-susceptible 2f mutant encodes a lr <dig> protein containing a deletion in the second transmembrane domain which may act as a ‘dominant negative’ mutant that interferes with other related transporters that contribute to basal immunity.

analysis of lr <dig> and lr <dig> mutants confirmed previous reports that these genes confer resistance to multiple pathogens in a race non-specific manner. given that sodium azide produces point mutations, the mutation analysis of lr <dig> is consistent with a single gene conferring all resistance phenotypes associated with this locus. while the transfer of lr <dig> or lr <dig> into susceptible wheat backgrounds results in resistance to leaf rust and stripe rust, these genes do not confer effective stem rust resistance by themselves. for example, wheat lines containing lr <dig> such as chinese spring, terenzio and sumai  <dig> are susceptible to stem rust. however, transfer of lr <dig> into thatcher results in the expression of effective stem rust resistance possibly through interaction of lr <dig> with unlinked thatcher genes. there is good evidence that the ‘enhancement effect’ of lr <dig> on stem rust resistance is race specific suggesting that the mode of action is different to the race non-specific response conferred by this gene against leaf rust and stripe rust  <cit> . this study has confirmed that lr <dig> is also associated with enhanced stem rust resistance in thatcher. the donor line of lr <dig>  pi  <dig>  was stem rust susceptible demonstrating that lr <dig> resembles the lr <dig> phenotype in that it also interacts with unlinked genes in thatcher for expression of stem rust resistance  <cit> . it remains to be determined if the lr <dig> response to stem rust is also race specific and if it requires the same thatcher genes as lr <dig> for resistance.

if these genes were combined, would they provide additional protection to three rust pathogens? a putative lr34/lr <dig> line  which was previously developed and screened for rust resistance is unlikely to carry lr <dig> after this line was genotyped with a newly developed marker for lr <dig> . new germplasm will need to be developed to evaluate the resistance response of the gene combination. given the phenotypic similarities, it is possible that lr <dig> and lr <dig> encode proteins with similar function and lines carrying gene combinations that encode functionally redundant proteins may not out-perform single gene lines. the comparison of phenotypic differences amongst lr <dig> mutants to causal mutations awaits the isolation of the gene.

CONCLUSIONS
isolation and characterisation of mutants for lr <dig> and lr <dig> genes in a common genetic background enabled detailed studies of the resistance response to three rust pathogens. mutants were assessed visually in the field, by quantifying chitin levels in field samples, macroscopic observations and microscopic analysis of seedlings grown under controlled conditions. the isolation of partial and hyper-susceptible mutants for both genes from within relatively small m <dig> populations is interesting and may provide insights how predicted proteins function and interact with components of basal resistance in future studies. we anticipate that marker development for lr <dig> and as yet unidentified thatcher- derived gene that interact with lr <dig> and lr <dig> to confer stem rust resistance will add further value to both apr genes and provide greater rust protection in future cultivars.
