BACKGROUND
mycobacterium tuberculosis, the agent of tuberculosis, is associated with greater morbidity and longer dormancy infection times in humans than any other type of bacterial illness. approximately one third of the population worldwide are infected with m. tuberculosis, which causes nearly two million deaths each year  <cit> . the chronic state and dormancy of tuberculosis implies that m. tuberculosis has developed sophisticated strategies to modify and evade the innate and adaptive immune surveillance mechanisms of humans  <cit> .

m. tuberculosis has a distinctive cell wall structure, which is called the “core” mycolyl arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan  complex. it is well-known that the bacterial cell wall is a reservoir for many essential biomolecules that interact with the surrounding environment. peptidoglycan  the skeletal structure of the cell wall, enables bacteria to resist osmotic pressure. the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain  proteins in host cells, which have been identified as unique intracellular pattern-recognition receptors of pg and pg-derived muropeptides, are potential virulence factors  <cit> . therefore, bacteria may have developed pg modification properties to modulate nods-mediated host surveillance  <cit> . this is evidenced from the role pg plays in the pathogenesis of streptococcus pneumoniae <cit> , listeria monocytogenes <cit>  and helicobacter pylori <cit> .

deacetylation of pg in several bacterial species, such as s. pneumonia, l. monocytogenes and lactococcus lactis, prevents fusion of the phagosome with macrophage lysozyme  <cit> . although peptidoglycan deacetylase has been identified in some bacteria  <cit> , it has not yet been identified in m. tuberculosis.

m. smegmatis is commonly used as a model for studying gene function in m. tuberculosis because it proliferates rapidly and is non-pathogenic. m. smegmatis and m. tuberculosis have the same basic cell wall structure  <cit> . therefore, m. smegmatis peptidoglycan can be used as a substrate to investigate peptidoglycan deacetylase activity.

in this study, we cloned m. tuberculosis rv <dig> and expressed rv <dig> protein in escherichia coli and m. smegmatis. we determined the peptidoglycan deacetylase activity of purified rv <dig> and its biochemical characteristics. we also investigated whether the rv <dig> protein in m. smegmatis was lysozyme resistant.

methods
bacterial strains and growth conditions
e. coli novablue  and er <dig>  strains were routinely grown in luria-bertani media . the m. smegmatis mc <dig>  strain was grown in lb broth containing  <dig> %  tween  <dig>  or lb agar at 37°c. antibiotics were added at appropriate concentrations if needed. to prepare pg, m. smegmatis mc <dig> was grown in m <dig> minimal glucose medium .

rv <dig> cloning and expression vector construction
the rv <dig> was amplified from m. tuberculosis h37rv genomic dna  using pfu dna polymerase with rv <dig> primer  <dig>  and rv <dig> primer  <dig> . the 876 bp pcr product was ligated to a pjet <dig>  blunt vector to generate a pjet-rv <dig> plasmid, the presence of which was confirmed by dna sequencing. rv <dig> was ligated to the ndei and hindiii sites of pcoldii  to generate the pcoldii-rv <dig> plasmid for expression in e. coli. rv <dig> was also ligated to the ndei and hindiii sites of pvv <dig>  to obtain the pvv2-rv1096m. smegmatis expression plasmid .

expression and purification of rv <dig> protein
the pcoldii-rv <dig> plasmid was transformed into e. coli er <dig> cells  by a chemical transformation method  <cit> . e. coli er <dig> harboring the pcoldii-rv <dig> plasmid  was grown in 300 ml of lb broth containing ampicillin  at 37°c. isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 1 mm was added to the culture when the od <dig> reached  <dig> , after which the culture was incubated at 16°c for 24 h.

the pvv2-rv <dig> plasmid was transformed into m. smegmatis mc <dig> using an electroporation method  <cit> . m. smegmatis mc <dig> harboring the pvv2-rv <dig> plasmid  was grown in 300 ml of lbt broth with kanamycin at 50 μg/ml at 37°c for 24 h.

the cultures were centrifuged at 5000 × g for 15 min and the cell pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer  with 1 mm phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride. after sonication, the lysates were centrifuged at 15000 × g for 20 min and the supernatant fraction was loaded onto a ni-nta column  by gravity flow. the column was washed with 20 ml of wash buffer . the purified protein was eluted with 10 ml of elution buffer , and the first 3 ml was collected for sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and western blotting, as well as deacetylase activity detection. the purified protein  was subjected to 12% sds-page and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane  in blotting buffer . after blocking with 10% non-fat dry milk in tbst buffer , the membrane was incubated with a monoclonal -polyhistidine his- <dig> antibody . the membrane was washed with tbst buffer three times and then incubated with alkaline-phosphatase conjugated anti-mouse-igg . the his6-tagged-protein band was visualized with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium  solution.

preparation of m. smegmatis pg
m. smegmatis pg was prepared from cell wall fractions as described previously  <cit> . briefly, a 500 ml culture of m. smegmatis mc <dig> in m <dig> minimal glucose medium was harvested when the od <dig> reached  <dig> , after which the cells were washed three times with pre-cooled phosphate buffered saline . the pellets were resuspended in distilled water to  <dig>  g/ml, mixed with an equal volume of boiling 8% sds added drop-wise with continuous boiling for 30 min. a cell-wall-enriched fraction was obtained by centrifugation at  <dig>  × g at 20°c for 60 min, followed by three washes with pre-cooled pbs. the pellet was washed with distilled water at least six times to remove the sds. the sample was resuspended in 5 ml of buffer  and then sonicated for 5 min. α-amylase and imidazole were added to the sample at final concentrations of 100 μg/ml and  <dig>  m, respectively, and the solution was incubated at 37°c for 2 h to remove glycogen. afterwards, proteinase k was added to the sample at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml, followed by incubation at 37°c for  <dig>  h to remove lipoprotein. the proteinase k solution was then inactivated by addition of an equal volume of boiling 8% sds with vigorous stirring for 15 min. the mixture was ultracentrifuged at  <dig>  × g at 20°c for 30 min. the pelleted material was washed as described above. the resulting magp  complex was washed with acetone and dried under a vacuum. mycolic acids were removed with 1% potassium hydroxide in methanol at 37°c for 72 h. after room temperature centrifugation at  <dig>  × g for 30 min, the pelleted arabinogalactan-pg was washed with distilled water twice and dried under a vacuum. arabinogalactan was removed by washing with 49% hydrofluoridic acid at 4°c for 120 h with stirring. the resulting pg was pelleted by room temperature centrifugation at  <dig>  × g for 30 min and then washed as described above. the pg was dissolved in 50 mm heps buffer  at 1 mg/ml until further use.

deacetylase activity assays
the acetyl group released from the pg was measured using an acetic acid detection kit . briefly, rv <dig> protein  prepared from er2566/rv <dig> and m. smegmatis/rv <dig> were separately incubated with m. smegmatis pg. the reactions were performed at 37°c for 30 min and stopped by 10 min boiling. after room temperature centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was collected for acetic acid measurement using a spectrophotometric assay accordingly to the kit instructions.

the kinetic properties of the rv <dig> protein toward m. smegmatis pg were determined as described previously  <cit> . the molarity of m. smegmatis pg was calculated based the assumption that m. smegmatis pg is primarily composed of repeat units of glcnac-murnac -l-ala-d-glu-a2pm, mw  <dig>   <cit> . first, the initial velocity was evaluated according to the duration of each reaction  and the rv <dig> concentration  curves. then, the optimal conditions for the enzymatic reactions were determined. based on the initial velocity and the optimal conditions that we identified, the steady-state kinetic parameters were determined by a lineweaver-burke plot.

lysozyme susceptibility assays
to investigate whether the rv <dig> protein contributed to lysozyme resistance in m. smegmatis, wild-type m. smegmatis or m. smegmatis/rv <dig> with over-expressed rv <dig> protein were treated with lysozyme. both bacterial strains were incubated in lbt medium at 37°c. when the od <dig> reached ~ <dig> , the cultures were divided into two equal volumes parts. one part was treated with lysozyme  at a final concentration of 200 μg/ml; the other was not given this treatment. bacterial growth was monitored by measuring the optical density at 600 nm. bacterial viability was evaluated by counting the number of colony forming units  per milliliter on lb agar  <cit> .

morphology of the m. smegmatis strains after lysozyme treatment
light microscopy and electron microscopy were used to investigate whether the rv <dig> protein affected the morphology of m. smegmatis in the presence of lysozyme. bacteria that were treated with lysozyme for 9 h were harvested by centrifugation at  <dig>  × g at 4°c for 10 min, after which the pellets were washed with sterilized 1 m pbs , three times. samples were prepared for ziehl-neelsen acid-fast staining as described previously  <cit> , and observed under a light microscope . the cells for electron microscopic analysis were fixed with  <dig> % glutaraldehyde, followed by post-fixation at room temperature for 2 h with 1% osmium tetroxide. the samples were dehydrated with ethanol, which was replaced with liquid carbon dioxide by critical point drying. the dried samples were applied to a silicon wafer slide and sputter-coated with gold before examination by an electronic microscope .

statistical analysis
data are summarized as mean value ± standard deviation . data were assessed by two-tailed unpaired t tests. a p value of < <dig>  was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
rv <dig> shares homology with other deacetylases
the amino acid sequences of the rv <dig> protein and other known polysaccharide deacetylases  <cit>  were compared by multalin analysis. the s. pneumoniae pgda protein , l. monocytogenes pgda  and l. lactis pgda  were identified as n-acetylglucosamine deacetylase proteins containing ce- <dig> nodb domains  <cit> . rv <dig> also contained a ce- <dig> nodb domain. rv <dig> shared  <dig> % sequence identity with the s. pneumoniae pgda protein, whose deacetylase domain has recently been defined as a crystal structure  <cit> . the catalytic core of the amino acids involved in deacetylase activity is highly conserved between rv <dig> and s. pneumoniae pgda proteins .

rv <dig> overexpressed in e. coli and m. smegmatis is a soluble protein
soluble rv <dig> protein, over-expressed in both e. coli and m. smegmatis, was purified by ni-nta affinity chromatography. the purified rv <dig> protein was analyzed by sds-page and western blotting . the results showed that purified rv <dig> had a molecular weight of 35 kda.

rv <dig> exhibits peptidoglycan deacetylase activity
to assess its deacetylase activity, rv <dig> protein at  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  or  <dig>  μg/ml was incubated with m. smegmatis pg at 1 mg/ml. the acetyl group released from pg was measured using an acetic acid detection kit . the results revealed that the purified rv <dig> protein over-expressed in both e. coli and m. smegmatis exhibited peptidoglycan deacetylase activity . there was no significant difference between the rv <dig> proteins prepared from either bacterium in terms of their specific enzymatic activities . therefore, the rv <dig> protein prepared from e. coli was used for the following enzyme kinetics experiments as it was easier to prepare and produced a greater yield than that produced in m. smegmatis.

according to the time versus concentration curve , when the rv <dig> protein concentration was  <dig>  μg/ml, acetic acid was released at a constant rate over a 30 min period. therefore, the initial velocity range fell within 30 min, and the optimal concentration for rv <dig> was  <dig>  μg/ml. the optimal deacetylation reaction conditions were determined by changing the ph and temperature of the reaction. from this, the optimal ph was found to be  <dig>  and the optimal temperature 37°c . the kinetic parameters were calculated by a double reciprocal plot : km =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm; vmax =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm min-1; and kcat =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  .

as shown in figure  <dig>  rv <dig> contained the same asp-his-his conserved residues known to interact with co2+ in s. pneumoniae pgda. to ensure that rv <dig> was also a metallo-dependent deacetylase, various divalent cations  were added to the reaction buffer, each at a final concentration of  <dig>  μm; edta at 50 μm served as a control. the results showed that the enzymatic reactivity reached the highest level in the presence of co2+; however, enzymatic activity was lost in the presence of edta . therefore, we determined that rv <dig> is a metallo-dependent pg deacetylase.

m. smegmatis/rv <dig> exhibits lysozyme resistance
to determine the contribution of rv <dig> protein to m. smegmatis resistance to lysozyme, m. smegmatis/rv <dig> and wild-type m. smegmatis cultures were divided into two parts at the beginning of the exponential growth phase. test samples received 200 μg/ml lysozyme, unlike the control samples. as shown in figure 4a, the wild-type m. smegmatis culture suspension treated with lysozyme lost its opaque, hazy appearance, becoming transparent at the end of the exponential growth phase, or shortly after reaching stationery phase. its od <dig> and cfu values decreased, indicating that cell lysis took place in the wild-type lysozyme-treated m. smegmatis. the m. smegmatis/rv <dig> growth curves for lysozyme treatment showed almost no difference to the lysozyme-untreated group, suggesting that rv <dig> protein contributed to m. smegmatis resistance to lysozyme degradation. there was also no significant difference between the m. smegmatis/rv <dig> and wild-type m. smegmatis treated with lysozyme in terms of bacterial viability within the initial four hours of growth . however, viable wild-type m. smegmatis bacteria decreased rapidly after lysozyme treatment for 4 h. a significant difference  in viability was observed between m. smegmatis/rv <dig> and wild-type m. smegmatis after lysozyme treatment for 9 h. about  <dig> wild-type m. smegmatis cells survived, whereas only 1016m. smegmatis/rv <dig> cells survived.

the m. smegmatis/rv <dig> cell wall was undamaged by 9 h of lysozyme treatment
because the most apparent differences in bacterial growth and viability were observed  after treatment with lysozyme for 9 h, morphological observations were performed at this time point. the results of the ziehl-neelsen acid-fast staining showed that wild-type m. smegmatis lost its acid-fastness and became blue dyed, whereas m. smegmatis/rv <dig> retained its acid-fastness . scanning electronic microscopy  showed that the wild-type m. smegmatis had an irregular appearance  in the presence of lysozyme, whereas m. smegmatis/rv <dig> had a regular shape, undamaged cell wall and smooth surface after 9 h lysozyme treatment .

discussion
m. tuberculosis rv <dig> protein, s. pneumoniae pgda protein , l. monocytogenes pgda , and l. lactis pgda  are carbohydrate esterase  <dig>  superfamily members. the ce- <dig> superfamily includes peptidoglycan glcnac deacetylases, rhizobial nodb chito-oligosaccharide deacetylases, chitin deacetylases, acetyl xylan esterases, and xylanases  <cit> . the substrates of these enzymes are polymers or basic structures that assemble pg backbone glycan strands. in this study, rv <dig> protein, over-expressed in both e. coli and m. smegmatis, was able to deacetylate m. smegmatis peptidoglycan. therefore, m. tuberculosis rv <dig> protein is a peptidoglycan deacetylase.

as shown in figure  <dig>  rv <dig> and three other deacetylases share sequence conservation at two catalytic histidine residues   <cit> . the metal ligand sites, including asp , arg , asp  and his  residues, which were identified in the s. pneumonia pgda protein  <cit> , are all present in the rv <dig> protein. these highly conserved sequences in rv <dig> suggest that it may have metallo-dependence. indeed, our results show that the enzymatic activity of rv <dig> increased after supplementation with divalent cations, especially co2+. taken together, our results suggest that rv <dig> may use similar catalytic mechanisms as the s. pneumoniae pgda protein to deacetylate pg.

it has been reported that pg deacetylase contributes to lysozyme resistance in some bacterial species, such as bacillus cereus <cit> , s. pneumonia <cit>  , l. monocytogenes <cit>  and shigella flexneri <cit> . generally, pdga mutants are more sensitive to lysozyme degradation in the stationary phase. similarly, m. smegmatis over-expressing rv <dig> protein showed remarkable resistance to lysozyme at the end of log phase growth. in the present study, the viability of m. smegmatis/rv <dig> was 109-fold higher than that of wild-type m. smegmatis after lysozyme treatment, indicating that pg deacetylation by the rv <dig> deacetylase had increased lysozyme resistance. the morphological changes observed between wild-type m. smegmatis and m. smegmatis/rv <dig> provides strong evidence that rv <dig> activity helped to preserve the integrity of the cell wall during lysozyme treatment. wild-type m. smegmatis lost its acid-fastness because of the increased cell wall permeability caused by lysozyme treatment. sem observations showed that wild-type m. smegmatis had a wrinkled cell surface with outward spilling of its cell contents, while m. smegmatis/rv <dig> maintained its cell wall integrity and acid fastness. therefore, it is likely that the functionality of the rv <dig> protein of m. smegmatis/rv <dig> contributed to its cell wall integrity.

in fact, pg n-deacetylase has been shown to be a virulence factor in several bacteria including s. pneumonia <cit> , s. iniae <cit> , l. monocytogenes <cit>  and h. pylori <cit> . for example, the s. pneumoniae pdga mutant  developed hypersensitivity to exogenous lysozyme and decreased virulence in a mouse infection model  <cit> . furthermore, l. monocytogenes lacking pdga  was susceptible to macrophage clearance  <cit> . in further studies, we aim to establish whether the rv <dig> protein is a virulence factor.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified m. tuberculosis rv <dig> as a pg deacetylase and found that the pg deacetylase activity of this protein contributed to lysozyme resistance in m. smegmatis. our findings suggest that pg deacetylation may be involved in immune evasion by m. tuberculosis in its host.
