BACKGROUND
the maize  flavonoid biosynthesis provides an excellent system to study gene interaction in plants because of its extensive characterization at genetic, biochemical, and molecular levels  <cit> . different flavonoid compounds share the same basic skeleton of the flavan-nucleus consisting of two aromatic rings with six carbon atoms  which are interconnected by a hetero-cyclic ring with three carbon atoms . maize produces 3-hydroxyflavonoids  and 3-deoxyflavonoids which include phlobaphenes, 3-deoxyanthocyanidins, and c-glycosyl flavones. these compounds are synthesized in different tissues and this spatial distribution depends on the genetic constitution of the plant. anthocyanins can accumulate in most plant parts whereas phlobaphenes are predominantly found in kernel pericarp , cob-glumes , tassel glumes, and husk  <cit> . the 3-deoxyanthocyanins and c-glycosyl flavones primarily accumulate in silks  <cit> . however, in some high altitude maize lines c-glycosyl flavones can also accumulate in leaves  <cit>  indicating genetic diversity for developmental accumulation of flavonoid metabolites.

the 3-hydroxy- and 3-deoxy-flavonoids in maize are regulated by independent sets of transcription factors. accumulation of 3-hydroxyflavonoids  is controlled by two sets of duplicated genes: colorless <dig> /purple leaf <dig>  are members of the r2r3-myb family of transcription factors  <cit> , and booster <dig> /red <dig>  are members of the basic helix-loop-helix  family  <cit> . studies have shown that c <dig> or pl <dig> proteins interact directly with r <dig> or b <dig> to activate transcription of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes in seed and plant body, respectively  <cit> . in contrast, 3-deoxyflavonoid pathway genes are regulated by pericarp color <dig> , which encodes an r2r3-myb transcription factor  <cit> . the p locus is a complex of duplicated myb-homologous genes p <dig> and p <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . the p locus is a major qtl for the biosynthesis of c-glycosyl flavones  <cit>  and 3-deoxyanthocyanidins in silks  <cit> .

three flavonoid biosynthetic genes; colorless <dig> , chalcone isomerase <dig> , and anthocyaninless <dig>  encode chalcone synthase , chalcone isomerase , and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase , respectively. these three genes are common to the anthocyanin and phlobaphene pathways, but are independently regulated by the corresponding sets of transcription factors  <cit> . in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that c <dig> + r <dig> or p <dig> can direct high level of expression from promoters containing the c1/r <dig> or p <dig> binding sites identified previously in the a <dig> and c <dig> gene promoter  <cit> .

the flavonoid pathway  shows the potential involvement of a flavonoid 3’-hydroxylase  in different branches. f3’h is a cytochrome p450-dependent mono-oxygenase and has an influence on the hydroxylation pattern, which is an important structural feature in determining the color and stability of flavonoid compounds  <cit> . in the anthocyanin branch, f3’h catalyzes the conversion of naringenin to eriodictyol  <cit> . we have recently demonstrated that the pr <dig> gene which encodes a flavonoid 3’-hydroxylase  is required for the accumulation of dihydroquercetin  <cit> . in addition, a sorghum f3’h gene has been implicated in different sub-branches of phlobaphene  <cit> , c-glycosyl flavone  <cit> , and 3-deoxyanthocyanidin pathways  <cit> . we previously showed that c <dig> and r <dig> are required for zmf3’h <dig> gene expression in the anthocyanin pathway  <cit> . in the current study we tested the hypothesis of regulation of zmf3’h <dig> by p <dig> in order to explain its role in 3-deoxyflavonoid biosynthesis. identification of p <dig> binding sites in the promoter of zmf3’h <dig> and in vivo p <dig> binding further established regulation of zmf3’h <dig> by p <dig>  through the genetic and biochemical analysis of well-defined genetic stocks with combination of pr <dig> and p <dig> alleles we demonstrate that p <dig> regulated biosynthesis of 3-deoxyflavonoids in pericarps, cob glumes, and silks requires a functional zmf3’h <dig> gene.

RESULTS
pr1; p <dig> cob-glumes accumulate luteoforol
maize plants carrying a functional p <dig> gene accumulate phlobaphene pigments in kernel pericarps and cob glumes. although, the zmf3’h <dig> has been shown to be required for the formation of purple anthocyanins in kernel aleurones  <cit> , changes in pigment intensity has also been observed in phlobaphene accumulating tissues in the presence of a functional zmf3’h <dig> gene  <cit> . to investigate the role of zmf3’h <dig> in the p <dig> regulated phlobaphene biosynthesis, we developed pr <dig> and pr <dig> near isogenic lines in the genetic background of three p <dig> alleles: p1rr, p1wr and pdel <dig> . phenotypic characterization of p1wr ears segregating for pr <dig> and pr <dig> showed colorless pericarp and gene dependent cob glumes pigment phenotypes: dark red in pr1/pr1; p1wr/p1wr while light red in pr1/pr1; p1wr/p1wr. moreover, in the presence of p1rr, pr <dig> and pr <dig> plants showed pericarp and cob glumes colour differences: pr1/pr1; p1rr/p1rr plants have dark red pericarp and dark red cob glumes as compared to red pericarp and light red cob glumes in pr1/pr1; p1rr/p1rr plants. importantly, pdel <dig> plants , in the presence of pr <dig> or pr <dig> did not show any visible phlobaphene pigmentation in pericarps or cob glumes .

two flavan 4-ols, luteoforol and apiforol have been implicated as precursors of phlobaphene pigments that accumulate in maize genotypes carrying functional p <dig> or p <dig> genes. cob glumes were used to perform biochemical characterization of flavan 4-ols. the dark red cob glumes from pr1/pr1; p1wr/p1wr had maximum absorption  at 552 nm, while light red cob glumes from pr1/pr1; p1wr/p1wr plants had λ max at 535 nm . these absorption spectra correspond to luteoforol and apiforol, respectively  <cit> . to further confirm if the zmf3’h <dig> plays a role, flavan 4-ols were converted into their corresponding 3-deoxyanthocyanidins by acid treatment of methanolic extracts . extracts from pr1/pr1; p1wr/p1wr converted to luteolinidin  indicating the presence of luteoforol in the methanolic extracts. similarly, extracts of pr1/pr1; p1wr/p1wr cob glumes were converted into apigeninidin  indicating presence of apiforol in the extract. acid treated methanolic extracts from cob glumes of pr1/pr1; p1rr/p1rr and pr1/pr1; p1rr/p1rr also had maximum absorption wavelengths corresponding to luteolinidin and apigeninidin, respectively. no detectable flavan 4-ols or corresponding 3-deoxyanthocyanidins accumulated in cob glumes of pr1/pr1; pdel2/pdel <dig> or pr1/pr1; pdel2/pdel <dig>  this was in accordance with p <dig> gene’s function as a regulator of phlobaphene biosynthesis  <cit> . taken together, these results show that cob glumes from pr1; p <dig> plants accumulate apiforol whereas luteoforol accumulates in cob glumes of pr1; p <dig> plants. this result also indicates that the accumulation of apiforol and luteoforol is influenced by a flavonoid 3’-hydroxylase acting in parallel for the conversion of naringenin to eriodictyol.

p <dig> regulates the transcription of zmf3'h1
the zmf3’h <dig> gene appears to affect the composition of flavan 4-ols in floral tissues of p <dig> alleles. thus, it is possible that the p <dig> gene regulates the zmf3’h <dig> transcription. to test this hypothesis, we examined steady state transcript levels of zmf3’h <dig> in pericarps, cob-glumes, and silks of pr <dig> plants carrying functional and null p <dig> alleles . increased levels of zmf3’h <dig> transcripts were present in pericarps of pr1/pr1; p1rr/p1rr plants, while these transcripts were not detected in pericarps of pr1/pr1; p1wr/p1wr and pr1/pr1; p1ww/p1ww plants . in cob glumes of pr1/pr1; p1rr/p1rr and pr1/pr1; p1wr/p1wr plants there were appreciable amounts of zmf3’h <dig> transcripts, while pr1/pr1; p1ww/p1ww cob glumes did not show zmf3’h <dig> transcripts . transcript levels of p <dig>  c <dig>  chi <dig>  a <dig>  and zmf3’h <dig> were also compared in silks . similar to the p <dig> expression, zmf3’h <dig> was highly expressed in silks of pr1/pr1; p1rr/p1rr and pr1/pr1; p1wr/p1wr. although, both p1ww  and p1ww- <dig> alleles have non-functional p <dig> gene, detectable levels of p <dig> expression was present. the the p gene probe used in this study can detect both p <dig> and p <dig> specific transcripts . thus the zmf3’h <dig> expression detected in p1ww silks is because of a functional p <dig> gene  <cit> . further, the p-specific transcripts were not detected in pdel <dig> silks because of deletions within p <dig> and p <dig> genes. in addition, other biosynthetic genes c <dig>  chi <dig>  and a <dig> showed expression pattern similar to that of zmf3’h <dig> indicating a commonality in the regulation of these genes. overall, these results show that the p <dig> and p <dig> genes regulate the transcriptional expression of zmf3’h <dig> in maize pericarp, cob glume, and silk.

p <dig> binds to two sites in the zmf3’h <dig> promoter
the p <dig> gene regulates expression of zmf3’h <dig> during accumulation of luteoforol in maize floral tissues. to further confirm the mechanism by which p <dig> controls zmf3’h <dig> expression, we found that the zmf3’h <dig> promoter contains the cis-regulatory elements cctacc  and ccaacc , that resemble p <dig> dna-binding sites  <cit> . to test this possibility, electrophoretic mobility shift assays  were performed using as probes two dna fragments spanning regions containing the putative p <dig> binding sites from - <dig> to - <dig> and from - <dig> to - <dig> . our results show that p <dig> binds both the sites, which is in agreement to consensus sequences cct/aacc derived from selex  <cit> .

p <dig> binds the zmf3′h <dig> promoter in vivo
in vitro binding assays indicate that p <dig> directly binds the zmf3’h <dig> promoter. in order to investigate whether p <dig> binds the pr <dig> promoter in vivo, chromatin immunoprecipitation  experiments were performed. pericarps from p1ww and p1rr were collected at 15 days after pollination , and subjected to chip assays using an anti-p <dig> polyclonal antibody that was successful in a <dig> gene chip experiments previously  <cit> . figure  <dig> clearly shows that the anti-p <dig> antibody precipitate complexes containing the zmf3’h <dig> promoter fragment with the presence of p <dig> protein whereas the antibody did not enrich copia or actin fragments. these results suggest that p <dig> directly binds zmf3’h <dig> promoter in vitro and in vivo.

pr1; p <dig> plants do not accumulate luteolinidin in silks
in maize, p <dig> is known to regulate 3-deoxyanthocyanidins in silks, but their biosynthesis is poorly understood  <cit> . several lines of evidence showed that flavan 4-ols are the precursors of 3-deoxyanthocyanidins  <cit> . since, zmf3’h <dig> plays a role in the differential accumulation of p <dig> regulated flavan 4-ols, we tested if zmf3’h <dig> also influences the accumulation of 3-deoxyanthocyanidins. silk extracts from pr <dig> and pr <dig> plants carrying different p <dig> alleles were analysed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography  . extracts from pr1/pr1; p1rr/p1rr and pr1/pr1; p1wr/p1wr plants showed four major peaks at 480 nm: three for luteolinidin glycosides labelled as a, b, and c with retention times of  <dig>  min,  <dig>  min, and  <dig>  min, respectively and the fourth peak corresponds to anthocyanins, eluting at  <dig>  min. . the peaks a, b, and c had the luteolinidin aglycone spectra but eluted considerably before the aglycone suggesting that they are more polar and therefore most likely correspond to glycosylated flavonoids. based on their different elution times, these may be mono-glucosyl or di-glucosyl luteolinidins. interestingly, silks from pr1/pr1; p1rr/p1rr and pr1/pr1; p1wr/p1wr plants, showed much smaller peaks for all luteolinidin glycosides and few additional peaks of unknown compounds. pr <dig> and pr <dig> plants carrying p1ww or pdel <dig> alleles did not produce any detectable levels of these compounds. this latter result is consistent with the fact that both of these p alleles lack a functional p <dig> gene to induce 3-deoxyanthocyanidins accumulation in silks. quantitative hplc data  showed that pr1/pr1; p1rr/p1rr and pr1/pr1; p1wr/p1wr silks accumulated significantly higher levels of total luteolinidin glycosides as compared to pr1/pr1; p1rr/p1rr and pr1/pr1; p1wr/p1wr. none or very little amount of 3-deoxyanthocyanidins accumulated in pdel <dig> or p1ww plants. in summary, hplc analysis of 3-deoxyanthocyanidins in silks of pr1; p <dig>  and pr1; p <dig> plants show that the zmf3’h <dig> participates in the synthesis of luteolinidin.

silks of pr1; p <dig> plants have reduced maysin accumulation
our results thus far suggest that, the zmf3’h <dig> is under the regulatory control of p <dig> and participates in the biosynthesis of both phlobaphenes and 3-deoxyanthocyanidins. to test if zmf3’h <dig> also has a role in p-regulated c-glycosyl flavones biosynthesis, flavone levels in silks of pr <dig> and pr <dig> plants in various p <dig> allelic backgrounds were measured . maysin and apimaysin were identified by comparing their retention times of  <dig>  min and  <dig>  min, respectively and uv absorption spectrum with authentic standards. in pr1/pr1; p1-wr/p1-wr silks, maysin was the major compound while smaller peaks for apimaysin and rhamnosylisoorientin were detected at 340 nm . silk extracts from pr1/pr1; p1-wr/p1-wr showed a single dominant peak for apimaysin, a smaller peak for rhamnosylisoorientin and no peak for maysin. peaks for maysin and apimaysin were not observed at an appreciable level in pr1/pr1; p-del2/p-del <dig> silks. quantitative data measured from hplc showed that pr1/pr1; p1-rr/p1-rr and pr1/pr1; p1-wr/p1-wr plants have significantly higher levels of maysin and substantially lower levels of apimaysin . in contrast, pr1/pr1; p1-wr/p1-wr silks produced significantly high levels of apimaysin and very little amount of maysin. in p-del <dig> silk extracts, no significant levels of c-glycosyl flavones were detected irrespective of the type of pr <dig> allele present. however, in pr <dig> and pr <dig> lines carrying p1-ww  allele, very low levels of maysin and apimaysin were detected; this can be attributed to the functional p <dig> gene present in this allele. interestingly, pr1/pr1; p1-rr/p1-rr plants accumulated significantly higher amount of rhamnosylisoorientin in silks as compared to pr1/pr1; p1-rr/p1-rr . overall, these results suggest that the zmf3’h <dig> plays a role in the accumulation of c-glycosyl flavones in silks in the presence of functional p <dig> alleles.

pr1; p <dig> silks is detrimental to corn earworm larvae development
to determine the biological relevance of differential accumulation of maysin and apimaysin in silks of pr <dig> and pr <dig> plants, we performed insect silk feeding bioassays. corn earworm  larvae  were fed on fresh silks  collected from the same pr <dig> and pr <dig> plants that were used for hplc analysis. larvae fed on pr <dig> silks had lower body weight and took longer time to pupate as compared to those fed on pr <dig> silks . these results are in agreement with the accumulation of higher amounts of maysin in pr <dig> silks. interestingly, larvae fed on pr1/pr1; p1wr/p1wr silks showed lower weight and longer time to pupate as compared to those fed on pr1/pr1; p1wr/p1wr silks, even though the pr <dig> silks had higher levels of maysin. this anomaly could possibly be because of the accumulation of exceptionally higher level of apimaysin in pr1/pr1; p1wr/p1wr . as shown in previous studies, apimaysin has insecticidal activity against lepidopteron insects, although, apimaysin’s activity levels were lower than maysin  <cit> . overall, combined data from hplc and larvae feeding bioassay indicated that a functional zmf3’h <dig> participates in the accumulation of 3’-hydroxylated c-glycosyl flavones that affect the growth of corn earworm larvae.

discussion
the pr <dig> locus has been extensively used as phenotypic marker in maize genetics research because of its role in determining kernel aleurone color by hydroxylation of anthocyanin compounds   <cit> . however, little is known about the function and regulation of the pr <dig> encoded zmf3’h <dig> in 3-deoxyflavonoids pathway. the 3-deoxyflavonoids include phlobaphene pigments  <cit>  and agronomically important c-glycosyl flavones and 3-deoxyanthocyanidins which provide resistance against various biotic stresses  <cit> . maize p <dig> gene regulates the 3-deoxyflavonoid biosynthetic pathway  <cit> . here, we describe the first direct evidence of the involvement of zmf3’h <dig> in the 3-deoxyflavonoid pathway and its regulation by p <dig> myb transcription factor. we have demonstrated that the dark red cob glumes of pr1; p <dig> plants accumulates luteoforol as compared to apiforol accumulating in light red cob glumes of pr1; p <dig> plants. further, gene expression analysis confirmed that transcription of zmf3’h <dig> requires p <dig> gene expression in pericarps, cob glumes, and silks. interestingly, the detection of zmf3’h <dig> transcripts in silks of p1ww lines suggest that in addition to p <dig>  the paralog p <dig> is also involved in the regulation of zmf3’h <dig> expression in silks. additionally, the absence of zmf3’h <dig> transcripts in pdel <dig> allele which has a deletion of p <dig> and p <dig> genes  <cit> , supported this hypothesis.

p <dig> is a r2r3-myb protein and directly regulates the expression of flavonoid biosynthetic genes. binding of p <dig> to the cis-regulatory elements of the a <dig> and c <dig> gene promoter has been well characterized  <cit> . sequence analysis of the zmf3’h <dig> promoter shows the presence of similar conserved p <dig> binding sites. further, emsa results demonstrated the in vitro binding ability of p <dig> to these cis- sites, while chip experiments confirmed that zmf3’h <dig> is an immediate direct target of p <dig>  in addition to p <dig> binding sites, zmf3’h <dig> promoter also contains anthocyanin regulatory element , a conserved sequence present in other anthocyanin biosynthetic genes  <cit> .

underlining the importance of zmf3’h <dig> in maize biotic stress resistance, our work further added that pr1; p <dig> plants accumulate significantly higher levels of the antifungal compound luteolinidin in silks. luteolinidin is known to be toxic towards fungi and it accumulates at higher level in sorghum lines resistant to the anthracnose fungus  <cit> . in sorghum, attempted penetration of cochliobolus heterostrophus leads to up regulation of a f3’h gene and sequential accumulation of luteolinidin  <cit> . the 3-deoxyanthocyanidin pathway in sorghum requires a myb protein encoded by yellow seed <dig> , an ortholog of maize p <dig> <cit> . similar to the regulation of zmf3’h <dig> by p <dig>  sorghum f3’h is regulated by y <dig> <cit> . it remains to be tested if silk extracts containing higher luteolinidin glycosides show resistance to fungal pathogens of maize.

zmf3’h <dig> participates in the biosynthesis of the 3’-hydroxylated c-glycosyl flavones with pr1; p <dig> silks accumulating higher level of maysin compared to pr1; p <dig> silks. structurally, apimaysin and maysin are highly related and differ only by b-ring hydroxylation in position 3’  <cit> . unexpectedly, the accumulation of maysin and apimaysin in pr1/pr1; p1wr/p1wr and pr1/pr1; p1wr/p1wr silks did not exactly follow the inverse correlation. apimaysin level in pr1/pr1; p1wr/p1wr silks increased to a substantially higher level as compared to the maysin level in a pr1/pr1; p1wr/p1wr line. one possibility is that the apimaysin is acting as a substrate for another enzyme and is converted into a product that we were not able to detect in the analysis. we also measured rhamnosylisoorientin which has been shown to have insecticidal activity  <cit> . rhamnosylisoorientin is a c-glycosyl flavone which is present upstream of maysin. importantly, pr <dig> silks have higher level of rhamnosylisoorientin as compared to pr <dig> in the presence of p1rr and p1ww, respectively. genetic variation at p locus is significantly correlated with maysin accumulation. genotypes carrying functional p <dig> or p <dig> alone accumulate less amount of maysin than maize lines that have both p <dig> and p <dig> genes  <cit> .

most of the steps in the formation of c-glycosyl flavones are unknown. it is possible that formation of c-glycosyl flavones does not entirely follow a single linear pathway but demonstrates shunting of substrate flow to alternate pathways through which maysin and apimaysin are formed separately  <cit> . the 3’, 4’-hydroxylated flavonoids, such as maysin and luteoforol could also be formed as a result of hydroxylation of naringenin to eriodictyol by f3’h and then subsequent conversion into intermediates leading to formation of these compounds   <cit> . this could also explain the higher level of rhamnosylisoorientin in pr <dig> plants. a recent study by morohashi et al  have shown the isolation and cloning of a fns/f2h encoding gene capable of converting flavanones to 2-hydroxy flavanones, a previously unknown step in the formation of c-glycosyl flavones  <cit> . they have also proposed the formation of 4’ and 3’, 4’- hydroxylated compounds through alternate pathways where a f3’h can perform hydroxylation of naringenin to eriodictyol. the accumulation of different levels of flavones and 3-deoxyanthocyanidins in functional p <dig> alleles could be attributed to polymorphic structural genes at different loci: functional c <dig>  whp <dig>  and a <dig> genes have a positive effect on maysin accumulation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the significance of flavonoid defence compounds, 3-deoxyanthocyanidin and c-glycosyl flavone has been well established  <cit> . the current study attempted to unravel the role of regulatory and biosynthetic genes involved in the synthesis of these flavonoids in order to tailor resistant plants. through transgenic and non-transgenic studies, it established that functional p <dig> and p <dig> genes can induce biosynthesis of these compounds  <cit> . the current study along with a previous report  <cit>  demonstrates that zmf3’h <dig> plays a significant role in generating diversity in anthocyanin, phlobaphene, 3-deoxyanthocyanidin, and c-glycosyl flavone compounds. it will be informative to further analyse the action of zmf3’h <dig> at specific steps for the biosynthesis of related phenylpropanoid compounds.
