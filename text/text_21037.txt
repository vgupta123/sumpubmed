BACKGROUND
the relaxin-like peptide family includes: relaxin- <dig>  relaxin- <dig>  relaxin- <dig>  and the insulin-like  peptides, insl <dig>  insl <dig>  insl <dig> and insl <dig>  all share high structural similarity with insulin due to the presence of six cysteine residues, which confer two inter-chain and one intra-chain disulfide bonds. thus, it was postulated that relaxin and insulin had derived from a common ancestral gene and were therefore grouped as the insulin superfamily, which later included insulin-like growth factors i and ii  .

despite less than 50% predicted sequence similarity across members of the insulin superfamily, primary structural determinants are retained, resulting in the similar tertiary structures of relaxin and insulin . the structures of insulin, relaxin  <cit> , relaxin- <dig>  <cit>  and insl <dig>  <cit>  are formed by the cleavage of the pro-hormone peptide into three chains , removal of the c chain and the formation of three disulfide bridges between six invariant cysteine residues found on the a and b chains, to produce an active protein. based on primary sequence similarity the native structures of human relaxin- <dig> , insl <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> should be similar, but to date this has not been confirmed.

various studies have highlighted the importance of a  motif in the relaxin b chain for interaction with the relaxin receptor and biological activity, which is dependent upon the presence of this motif  <cit> . coupled with the insulin-like cysteine bond pattern, the presence of this motif is used to distinguish relaxin sequences. hence, three relaxin genes are present in humans: relaxin- <dig> is found only in humans and the great apes, its expression is limited to the decidua, placenta and prostate  <cit> ; relaxin- <dig> is the major circulating form of relaxin in the human  <cit>  and the functional equivalent to the relaxin- <dig> in all non-primates; while relaxin- <dig> was only recently discovered and shows brain specific expression  <cit> . throughout this paper relaxin will be used to refer to relaxin- <dig> in humans and great apes, and the equivalent relaxin- <dig> in all other mammals .

#indicates functional equivalence

relaxin has been well characterized in a reproductive context.. it is a product of the ovary and/or placenta in most species studied, and has various roles in pregnancy and parturition, which differ between species  <cit> . recent advances have revealed relaxin to be a multifunctional hormone, with numerous non-reproductive roles . of the other relaxin-like peptides, insl <dig>  or relaxin-like factor , is closely related to relaxin and is critical for testis descent  <cit> . early placenta insulin-like peptide , placentin or insulin-like  <dig>  is primate specific and likely to have diverged from a common relaxin ancestor before the duplication that led to the two relaxin genes seen in humans and great apes  <cit> . insulin-like  <dig> and  <dig>  were identified by searching est databases with the cysteine motif conserved in all insulin-like peptides  <cit> . both insl <dig> and  <dig> peptides show higher sequence similarity to relaxin rather than insulin and are functionally uncharacterised.

until recently, receptors for all peptides of the relaxin family were unknown. given the high degree of structural similarity between relaxin and insulin, it had been believed that the relaxin receptor would also be a tyrosine kinase receptor, similar to the insulin receptor. however, it was finally demonstrated in  <dig>  that relaxin activated two previously orphan leucine rich repeat containing heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding protein-coupled receptors , lgr <dig> and lgr <dig>  <cit> . further studies have shown that lgr <dig> is the relaxin receptor  <cit> , although it also specifically interacts with relaxin- <dig>  <cit> , and that lgr <dig> is the insl <dig> receptor  <cit> . even more recently, another two gpcrs which are activated by relaxin- <dig>  the somatostatin- and angiotensin- like peptide receptor  and gpcr <dig> have been identified  <cit> . more recently gpcr <dig> has been shown to be the receptor for insl <dig>   <cit>  while gpcr <dig> appears to be the specific receptor for relaxin- <dig>  surprisingly, while lgr <dig>  lgr <dig>  gpcr <dig> and gpcr <dig> are all type i gpcrs, they are from different branches within this family and are only very distantly related  <cit> . no other relaxin-like peptides have been shown to interact with these receptors  <cit> .

relaxin and insl <dig> have primarily been of interest as hormones of pregnancy and reproduction; therefore it was assumed that the largely uncharacterised insl <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> would share similar functions. however the discovery of the brain specific relaxin- <dig>  and the widespread expression of insl <dig> and its receptor gpcr <dig> have resulted in a re-evaluation of these assumptions and raised the need for a new approach to investigating these peptides.

relaxin evolution has confounded researchers for decades. high sequence variability in relaxins across closely related species is a well-known feature of this peptide, however startling similarities have been observed between very distant species such as pigs and whales  <cit> . other studies have reported the existence of an invertebrate relaxin, a hormone with "relaxin-like" properties has been described in protozoa   <cit> , ascidians   <cit>  and tunicates   <cit> . a cdna and peptide sequence with almost 100% similarity to porcine relaxin was isolated from c. intestinalis  <cit> . contrastingly, numerous efforts to identify and sequence a relaxin ortholog in bovine and other ruminants have been unsuccessful. a likely non-functional single copy relaxin-like gene has been found in the ovine  <cit> . despite this controversy very few phylogenetic studies of relaxin, or the other relaxin-like peptides, have been reported. an in-depth analysis analysing only relaxin- <dig>  - <dig> and insl <dig> in several primates has been performed  <cit>  and a more recent paper has discussed the evolution of the family without including a detailed phylogenetic analysis  <cit> .

the increasing availability of genomic data has provided an opportunity to clarify the area of relaxin evolution using phylogenetic analysis. the relaxin-like peptide family phylogeny shows relaxin- <dig> is likely to be the ancestral relaxin, emerging prior to the divergence of fish, presumably with a function in the brain. multiple relaxin- <dig> sequences are present in the fish and frogs, while the phylogeny also suggests that a relaxin with reproductive functions is present in these lineages. however, relaxin has been lost in the chicken and its genome instead contains two relaxin-3-like sequences. evolutionary rate analysis shows positive darwinian selection to be driving the most recent members of the family, insl <dig>  insl <dig> and relaxin- <dig>

searches of the completed human, mouse and rat genomes did not identify any novel relaxin-like peptides, however, likely non-functional insl <dig> genes were revealed in the rat and dog genomes. a sequence with high similarity to insl <dig> was found , with a frameshift mutation in the first exon of the gene, which introduces a stop codon, resulting in a protein truncated early in the b chain . the recently completed dog genome also contains a sequence highly homologous to the human insl <dig> peptide . however this sequence does not encode an open reading frame, with two stop codons present in the c peptide sequence and one upstream of a homologous b chain sequence. furthermore, there was no recognizable signal peptide or methionine start codon upstream of this b chain sequence and it was missing the critical cys- <dig> in the b chain.

orthologs of all relaxin-like peptides were identified in the completed chimpanzee genome . two relaxin-like sequences were identified in the completed chicken genome , both with high similarity to human relaxin- <dig>  comparing the putative b and a domains of ggrlx3a and b with those of human relaxin- <dig> shows them to be 81% and 75% similar respectively . three sequences with a high similarity to human relaxin- <dig>  were also discovered in the x. tropicalis genome .


sequences with high similarity to relaxin- <dig> have previously been reported in the fugu fish, trrlx3a-e  <cit>  and zebrafish, drrlx3a  <cit>  . these searches identified a sixth relaxin-like sequence in the fugu fish, trrlx3f, and another three in the zebrafish, drrlx3b-d . unlike the sequences previously identified in the fugu fish  <cit> , trrlx3f is more similar to human relaxin- <dig>  than human relaxin- <dig>  . of the zebrafish sequences drrlx3b and d both show 77% similarity to human relaxin- <dig> in their b and a domains . drrlx3c is only 60% similar to human relaxin- <dig> and 54% similar to human relaxin- <dig> .

searches of partially completed genomes identified relaxin-like sequences in x. laevis , oncorhynchus mykiss   and an insl <dig> ortholog in the rhesus monkey . while omrlx <dig> shows high similarity to human relaxin- <dig> , xlrlx <dig> is less similar .

the presence of a relaxin gene in ruminants could not be determined due to the incomplete bovine genomic data currently available. no bovine ests with a similarity to relaxin were found and the presence of a bovine equivalent to the ovine likely non-functional genomic relaxin sequence could not be confirmed. however, a bovine est was identified  with high similarity to human relaxin- <dig>  starting from the end of the b chain .

searches of invertebrate genomic and est databases failed to identify a relaxin-like gene in any invertebrate or prokaryote. although a c. intestinalis relaxin-like cdna sequence has previously been reported  <cit> , our searches failed to confirm this finding. the published relaxin sequence could not be found in the completed c. intestinalis genome.

the b and a chains from all relaxin-like peptides identified in the following species: human, chimpanzee, rhesus monkey, pig, mouse, rat, wallaby, chicken, fugu fish, zebrafish, rainbow trout,r. esculenta, x. laevis and x. tropicalis were aligned using clustalw and edited to remove all gaps, which are problematic in phylogenetic analysis . only the six cysteine residues responsible for conferring structure are conserved across all the relaxin-like peptides. striking identity is seen amongst relaxin- <dig> sequences, especially in the b chain. much lower similarity is seen amongst relaxin sequences, apart from the cysteine motif, only the relaxin-specific b chain motif is conserved. c peptide sequences show only negligible similarity between even closely related species making them impossible to align accurately. the c peptide is cleaved from the mature form of relaxin- <dig>   <dig> and insl <dig>  is believed to be cleaved from the mature form of all other relaxin-like peptides and was therefore excluded from all sequences.

phylogeny of the relaxin-like peptide family
the alignment of b and a domains described above  was used to construct phylogenetic trees with the maximum parsimony , neighbour-joining  and maximum likelihood  methods. mp and nj methods produced conflicting trees, both with low bootstrap support for most of the major branches, and the ml tree failed to resolve many relationships . based on the relationships that could be determined with a degree of confidence, the sequences were divided into two clusters to be analysed separately . cluster a contained relaxin- <dig> and insl <dig> sequences, while cluster b contained relaxin- <dig>  relaxin- <dig>  insl <dig>  insl <dig> and insl <dig> sequences. several fish and frog sequences with lower sequence similarity to relaxin- <dig>  were grouped with cluster b based on preliminary phylogenetic analysis . these sequences have, therefore, been listed as relaxin homologs rather than relaxin  <dig> . also placed in cluster b are the sequences previously isolated from the tammar wallaby, merlx,  <cit>  and edible frog, rerlx  <cit> . despite sequence similarity to relaxin- <dig>  previous functional characterization and expression profiles of merlx and rerlx indicates they are relaxin, rather than relaxin- <dig> homologs.

none of the tree construction methods employed was able to completely resolve the phylogeny of either cluster. bootstrap values in the mp and nj generated trees were very low  and tree-puzzle failed to resolve the position of several sequences. this is primarily because of the short sequences used, as the c peptide can not be used to increase sequence length and thus improve the output from the tree generation methods, an inferred tree was produced instead. the tree-puzzle tree was resolved using topologies conserved between the mp and nj trees and then reconciled against a species tree using genetree. the inferred gene trees were then edited to minimize the incongruence  with the species tree. the inferred cluster a additional file  <dig>  and the cluster b trees additional file  <dig>  were combined to produce the phylogenetic tree of the complete relaxin-like peptide family . branch confidence levels are indicated on figure 2; branches without notation are inferred only. this gene tree was then reconciled with the species tree .

analysis of the reconciled tree shows a major duplication event occurred early in the vertebrate lineage, giving rise to two subfamilies . another duplication in subfamily a, prior to the emergence of fish, resulted in two lineages, which evolved into relaxin- <dig> and insl <dig> in mammals. interestingly, several non-mammalian relaxin-3-like sequences grouped with insl <dig>  implicating them as possible insl <dig> homologs . the reconciled tree also shows two additional fish-specific duplications in subfamily a. in the fugu fish genome a third duplication has occurred, resulting in three putative relaxin- <dig>  and two insl <dig> homologs . in subfamily b there were four duplications, all were after the divergence of birds and reptiles and likely to have occurred during mammalian evolution. these events resulted in insl <dig>  insl <dig>  relaxin- <dig>  relaxin- <dig> and insl <dig> 

synonymous  and nonsynonymous  substitution rate estimates
results show the relaxin-like peptides are under varying selection pressures . pairwise comparisons of human and chimpanzee orthologs provide the only way to compare all members of the family between two species. rln <dig>  rln <dig> and insl <dig> have high dn/ds rate estimates, with results for rln <dig> and insl <dig> suggesting positive darwinian selection. the extremely high estimate for insl <dig>  is caused by having a ds of  <dig> , resulting in a division by  <dig> for the rate estimate, which is represented as  <dig> rather than infinity. all other human and chimpanzee sequences compared were identical and thus produced dn/ds  estimates of  <dig> 

a these genes are not present in the mouse.

human and mouse orthologs were used to estimate rates for the other members of the family. rln <dig> and insl <dig> show the highest estimates again, although are much lower than comparisons with chimpanzee sequences, the insl <dig> estimate suggesting weak purifying selection instead of positive selection. the very low substitution rate observed for rln <dig>  shows this peptide to be under strong purifying selection, at a similar rate to insulin  . rates vary among the other members of the family from ~ <dig>  for insl <dig> and insl <dig> to ~ <dig>  for rln <dig> and insl <dig>  as insl <dig> is not present in mice and the human and chimpanzee sequences were identical, the insl <dig> sequence from the rhesus monkey was used instead . this comparison yielded a dn/ds estimate of  <dig> , indicating weak purifying selection.

substitution rate estimates for the individual b and a domains were determined in a similar fashion, using human and chimpanzee comparisons for rln <dig>  rln <dig> and insl6; human, rhesus monkey comparisons were used for insl <dig> and human, mouse comparisons were used for rln <dig>  insl <dig> and insl <dig> . these comparisons show the b domains of relaxin- <dig> and insl <dig> to be under positive selection . the b domains of insl <dig> and relaxin- <dig> also have high substitution rates , but are not high enough to suggest positive rather than neutral or weak purifying selection. all a domains are under the effects of fairly strong purifying selection, except for that of relaxin- <dig>  which is under only very weak selection pressures . interestingly, while the b domains of relaxin- <dig>  insl <dig> and insl <dig> all have very high dn/ds estimates, the a domains of these genes have very low estimates. this is in contrast with the other members of the family, relaxin- <dig>  insl <dig> and insl <dig>  which all have higher dn/ds  estimates in the a domain than the b domain.

positive selection tests
to confirm the pairwise dn/ds  estimates, more sophisticated codon-based substitution models  were used. as pairwise comparisons have already shown positive selection to be acting on rln <dig> and insl <dig>  insl <dig> was analysed further. the phylogenetic tree of all sequences used is shown in figure  <dig>  branch-specific likelihood analysis of the data, which assumes a constant ω ratio across all sites in a sequence, was used to test whether the insl <dig> branch  has a different ω ratio than all other branches. while the two-ratios model indicates a ω ratio of  <dig>  for branch a , the lrt comparing this with the one-ratio model shows this to be statistically insignificant .

site-specific models, which allow the ω ratios to vary between sites in a sequence, were also applied to the data. the ω ratio was found to vary considerably among amino acid sites. the discrete model with k =  <dig> site classes was the best fit to the data with a log likelihood value of - <dig>  . this model suggests that 31% of sites are under positive selection , while half  are under weak purifying selection  and the other 15% constrained under extreme purifying selection  . eight amino acids are identified as under positive selection at the 90% cut off . all but two of these are within the a chain of insl <dig>  the lrt of m <dig> with its null model  shows these results to be significant . similar results are seen with model m <dig> 

lastly, branch-site models a and b were applied to the data. these models extend the site and branch specific models by allowing the ω ratios to vary among lineages and sites and were used to test for specific sites under positive selection on the insl <dig> branch. model a, which fits the data significantly better than its null model m <dig>  identifies  <dig> sites  under positive selection in the insl <dig> branch at the 95% cut off . model b, which allows the ω ratio to vary both in the foreground lineage  and in the background branches also fits the data significantly better than its null model, m <dig> with k =  <dig> , and identifies the same two positively selected sites as model a  in the insl <dig> branch . model b also confirms the results produced by the discrete model , showing 27% of sites of under positive selection, 58% under weak purifying selection  and 14% under very strong purifying selection .

discussion
while relaxin evolution has been the centre of much controversy , this report is the first attempt to describe the evolutionary history of the whole relaxin-like peptide family from a phylogenetic perspective. previous studies have concentrated on the primate relaxins and relaxin-like factors  <cit> , or not included detailed phylogenetic analyses  <cit> . we have sought to expand upon these by incorporating sequences identified in all the available completed genomes with a subset of cloned relaxin-like sequences, particularly those from non-mammalian species.

none of the phylogenetic tree construction programs used was able to completely resolve the evolution of the relaxin-like peptide family. this is likely due to variable divergence across the family and the short sequence length  <cit> . incorporating results from the mp and nj methods suggested positions for several branches that were unresolved after ml analysis. minimizing incongruence between the gene and species trees by reducing the number of assumed duplications in the reconciled tree also provided a method to infer the evolutionary history of this family.

similarly to previously published results, searches of available genomic and est data failed to identify any novel members of the relaxin-like peptide family  <cit> . given the stringent and well-described insulin family signature that revolves around the invariant cysteine residues that confer the insulin-like structure seen across the superfamily, we find it improbable that any novel relaxin or insulin-like sequences will be identified.

the presence of an invertebrate relaxin has been of speculation since  <dig> when relaxin-like activity was first detected in the protozoa, t. pyriformis  <cit> . similar activity was reported in h. momus  <cit>  and in c. intestinalis, where a cdna sequence almost identical to pig relaxin was found  <cit> . however, our searches of all completed invertebrate genomes  failed to identify any relaxin-like sequences, including the published sequence. multiple insulin-like peptides have been found in several invertebrates, including: bombyxi mori   <cit> , d. melanogaster  <cit>  and c. elegans  <cit> . as these sequences lack the relaxin-specific motif, and show no homology to other relaxin family peptides, they are not considered part of the relaxin subfamily and therefore have not been included in these analyses. much of the controversy surrounding relaxin evolution concerns the identification of an invertebrate relaxin sequence  almost identical to pig relaxin . completion of the c. intestinalis and other invertebrate genomes has allowed us to conclude that there is not a relaxin-like sequence in any invertebrate sequenced to date. if an invertebrate relaxin does exist, it does not contain the relaxin-specific motif characterized in vertebrates.

a hallmark of relaxin sequences is their high variability, even amongst closely related species. relaxin-like peptide sequences isolated from two whales are almost identical to porcine relaxin  <cit> , however as these sequences were derived from amino acid sequencing, without nucleotide or and genomic sequence available, they have not been able to be included in these phylogenetic analyses.

the presence of a functional relaxin in the ruminant lineage has yet to be confirmed  <cit> . more genomic data is required to confirm the presence of a non-functional relaxin gene sequence in the bovine, similar to that observed in the ovine  <cit> . searches of the preliminary bovine genome assembly have failed to find a relaxin gene. interestingly, a relaxin sequence has been identified in the camel  <cit>  and relaxin expression found in the closely related llama and alpaca  <cit> . while classified as a ruminant, camelidae have a unique reproductive anatomy and physiology  <cit> . a bovine est  with high similarity to exon  <dig> of human relaxin- <dig> was identified. confirmation of the presence of relaxin and relaxin- <dig> orthologs in ruminants awaits further sequencing of the bovine and ovine genomes.

the presence of an avian relaxin has also been of speculation. while relaxin-like activity has been reported in the chicken  <cit> , an avian relaxin-like peptide or gene has not been identified. while two relaxin-3-like genes were identified in the nearly completed chicken genome, no avian relaxin gene was found. as no other relaxin-like genes were found, the reported relaxin activity may be due to one of the relaxin-3-like genes.

the phylogeny of the relaxin-like peptide family indicates relaxin- <dig> is the ancestral relaxin, appearing prior to the divergence of teleosts. the finding of multiple relaxin-3-like genes in the fugu fish and zebrafish suggests multiple lineage-specific duplications of a single relaxin-3-like ancestor have occurred in fish  <cit> . however, the possibility the other mammal specific relaxin-like peptides emerged earlier before being lost in the teleost can not be excluded  <cit> . we find it more likely that these duplications, and the resulting multiple relaxin-3-like genes, are fish specific and due to genome wide duplications hypothesized to have occurred during fish evolution  <cit> . phylogenetic analyses show multiple fish homologs of both the mammalian relaxin- <dig> and insl <dig> genes, meaning that two relaxin-3-like genes existed prior to the genome duplication event proposed to have occurred in the teleost ancestor. the putative fish relaxin homolog was either, present in the teleost ancestor, duplicated and the second copy lost or emerged shortly after or, as a result of, the genome-wide duplication event.

while termed relaxin-3-like based on sequence similarity, phylogenetic analysis indicates that several non-mammalian sequences  could be insl <dig> homologs. none of the sequences found in the complete x. tropicalis genome were placed in this group, while there are members present in the more ancient fish lineage and the younger avian lineage. it is possible that this gene has either been lost, or remains unidentified, in the x. tropicalis genome. a sequence with similarity only to the b chain of relaxin- <dig> was also found, but a corresponding a chain match was not, however, there is a gap in the genome assembly upstream which might contain the missing domain. future assemblies of the xenopus genome should resolve this issue. these results suggest that insl <dig> could have emerged during teleost evolution, far earlier than previously believed. unlike the mammal-specific relaxin-like genes, which are clustered together , insl <dig> is localized independently . these findings are of particular interest in the analysis of insl <dig>  which is still functionally uncharacterised.

all the potential non-mammalian insl <dig> homologs retain the relaxin-specific b chain  motif, hence would be capable of interacting with the relaxin receptor, lgr <dig>  and thus functionally classified as a relaxin. recent studies have shown insl <dig> is a high affinity ligand for gpcr <dig> but not gpcr <dig>  lgr <dig> or lgr <dig>  <cit> . as the residues required for interaction with gpcr <dig> and gpcr <dig> are not known, it is unknown whether the non-mammalian insl <dig> homologs would interact with gpcr <dig>  gpcr <dig> and/or lgr <dig> 

phylogenetic results from this study suggest the presence of a relaxin homolog in fish and frogs, although not in the chicken. relaxin sequences have previously been isolated and peptide sequenced from either the ovaries or testes of the edible frog  <cit> , little skate   <cit> , spiny dogfish   <cit> , atlantic stingray   <cit>  and the sand tiger shark   <cit> . while having high similarity with relaxin- <dig>  these sequences are not relaxin- <dig> homologs . based on the expression of all these genes in reproductive organs such as the testes and ovaries, and the failure to find the r. esculenta gene expressed in the brain using northern blot analysis  <cit> , we believe these to be among the first relaxin peptides with a reproductive function. based on the similarity with relaxin- <dig> observed in these sequences, the ancestral relaxin homolog, and its new reproductive function, is likely to have emerged prior to the divergence of teleosts. a complete picture of relaxin-like peptides present in non-mammalian genomes will be invaluable in understanding the evolution of relaxin from neuropeptide to reproductive hormone.

the ancestral rln <dig> gene is under very strong purifying selection, highlighting the importance of its highly conserved function, likely to be in the brain  <cit> . as high divergence is a hallmark of relaxin sequences, it is somewhat unsurprising that rln <dig> is under only weak purifying selection. we suggest that this lack of selective pressure has contributed to the high sequence divergence seen between many relaxins  and the differences in relaxin's functions observed across mammals.

information about the selective constraints placed upon these peptides, can provide valuable insight into the nature of interactions with their receptors. based on selection pressures we can conclude that the interactions between relaxin- <dig> and gpcr <dig>  insl <dig> and gpcr <dig> are very specific, while the binding of relaxin to lgr <dig> is much looser. in this context the cross-reactivity seen between lgr <dig> and insl <dig> or h <dig> relaxin, which are both similar to relaxin in sequence but especially in structure, is understandable, as is the lack of binding between gpcr <dig> and gpcr <dig> with any other relaxin-like peptide. unexpectedly, synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rate estimates for rln <dig> and insl <dig> show these to be under positive selection. positive selection is often difficult to observe using pairwise comparisons that average over the whole length of a sequence, making these results even more striking. while pairwise comparisons failed to confirm positive selection was acting on insl <dig>  further statistical tests suggested that positive darwinian selection acted on several sites in the insl <dig> sequence after its emergence. further analysis will be required to confirm these sites as important in the acquisition of a new receptor and a new function by insl <dig>  particularly in light of recent studies that question the reliability of ml methods to accurately detect positive selection acting on single sites  <cit> . we are encouraged that both branch-specific and site-specific ml models find positive selection to be acting on insl <dig> 

when the b and a domains of each gene were analyzed separately, further differences in selection pressures became apparent. the interaction between relaxin and its receptor has been thought to be primarily mediated through the b chain of the peptide  <cit> , so the finding that selection pressures are stronger on the a chain of relaxin- <dig>  insl <dig> and insl <dig> was unexpected. we also find it noteworthy that insl <dig>  insl <dig> and relaxin- <dig> are the most recent members of the family to emerge and all appear to be under the effects of positive darwinian selection. insl <dig> emerged during mammalian development, insl <dig> and rln <dig> during primate evolution, they remain functionally uncharacterized and insl <dig> and insl <dig> are without known receptors. the low selection pressure on the b domain and the strong constraints placed on the a domain of insl <dig> and insl <dig> suggests that, unlike the b chain mediated interaction of relaxin and insl <dig> with their receptors, the interaction of these peptides with their receptors could be dependant on the a chain instead. the low dn/ds rate observed for insl <dig> indicates this peptide to be evolutionary stable and of functional importance. in particular the constraints placed on both a and b chains of insl <dig> suggest a well-defined receptor interaction system, while the total absence of these constraints on either chain within relaxin- <dig> suggests the opposite, that perhaps this peptide is still evolving its function.

CONCLUSIONS
we present here a phylogeny for the relaxin-like peptide family. relaxin has long been used as an example of a gene that conflicts with the darwinian theory of evolution  <cit> . however, we have shown that these can issues can be resolved when studied in the context of the rest of the relaxin-like peptide family, in particular the new, but likely ancestral relaxin, relaxin- <dig> 

we have demonstrated that positive selection has been a driving force in the recent expansion of the relaxin-like peptide family during mammalian evolution. while strong purifying selection has maintained the structural core of these peptides by constraining the insulin superfamily cysteine motif, outside these residues, positive selection has acted after at least three gene duplication events  to allow these new genes to acquire a new receptor and novel functions. given the known roles of relaxin and insl <dig> in reproduction  these findings correlate with a general trend towards rapid evolution in several reproduction associated genes  <cit> . we anticipate that further analysis of the coevolution of the relaxin-like peptides with their receptors will contribute much towards our understanding of the pleiotropic actions of this family as well as mechanisms involved in the evolution of peptide hormone systems.
