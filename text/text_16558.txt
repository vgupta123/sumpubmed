BACKGROUND
recently, noradrenergic systems have been identified as a potential teratogenic target underlying the functional effects of prenatal cocaine  <cit> . however, information regarding the consequences of prenatal cocaine on the development of noradrenergic receptors is relatively sparse. ne is present early in brain development and regulates important aspects of prenatal brain development, including neural migration and synaptogenesis  <cit> . thus, the ability of cocaine to inhibit ne reuptake has potentially profound effects on the developing nervous system and function of ne systems.

previous investigations into the effects of prenatal cocaine exposure on catecholaminergic receptors have, for the most part, focused on the long-term effects of exposure on dopaminergic  <cit>  and serotonergic  <cit>  receptor systems. fewer studies have examined the noradrenergic receptor family following prenatal cocaine exposure. the neurophysiological effects of ne are mediated by three types of receptors: α <dig>  α <dig> and β. the α <dig> adrenergic receptors are present very early in development, in some brain areas as early as e <dig>  <cit> . prenatal exposure to cocaine has been found to elevate the density of α <dig> adrenergic receptors in the cerebellum and forebrain  <cit> . henderson et al  <cit>  reported that cortical α <dig> adrenergic receptor density was unchanged in male rat pups following prenatal cocaine exposure. however, these studies did not differentiate between male and female offspring and used homogenate binding techniques. moreover, cocaine was administered via the subcutaneous route into the dams, and therefore these effects likely occurred in the presence of potential nutritional and stress confounds  <cit> .

previous studies from this laboratory and others have demonstrated that the iv route of cocaine administration to pregnant rats produces functional alterations in attentional processes  <cit> . subtle, context-specific sex differences in attentional tasks following prenatal cocaine have been reported in a number of these studies  <cit> . the neurological basis of such attentional deficits is complex and likely mediated by several neurotransmitter systems. several studies have assessed the involvement of norepinephrine specifically in attentional processes. the development of the heart rate orienting response in preweaning rats, a task used to measure attention to a novel stimus, is dependent upon norepinephrine, but not dopamine or serotonin  <cit> . alterations in the heart rate orienting response of cocaine-treated offspring suggest early impairments in noradrenergic systems  <cit> . direct evidence of the effects of cocaine on norepinephrine systems has been provided by snow et al.  <cit> , in which cocaine was found to directly inhibit process outgrowth in locus coeruleus  neurons.

altered attention has been reported in  <dig> year old children gestationally exposed to moderate levels of cocaine  <cit> . the impairment in automated vigilance task in  <dig> year olds most likely reflects a deficit in sustained attention and one that also contained an accuracy component . the ne system is thought to be critically involved in the regulation of attention  <cit> . that is, the activation of ne serves to filter out distracting or competing stimuli and plays a role in selective attention in rats  <cit> . a recent study reports that rats exposed to prenatal cocaine are more sensitive to impairment of selective attention by idazoxan, an α <dig> adrenergic receptor agonist  <cit> . these findings, and reported deficits in vigilance/orienting performance of young rats prenatally exposed to iv cocaine  <cit>  suggest that ne plays an important role in attention and in long-term cocaine impairments  <cit> . the mechanisms of cocaine-induced disruption of ne developmental patterns and the relationship between these patterns and the attentional alterations remain to be determined.

for the most part, the effects of prenatal cocaine exposure have been assessed either immediately, during the preweaning period, or long-term, i.e. into mature adulthood. recently, the adolescent period has been recognized as a period of vulnerability to the effects of drugs of abuse  <cit> . exposure to drugs during early development may alter critical neural development, producing long-term effects on sexual maturation and sex-specific behaviors which are manifested during the adolescent period  <cit> . thus, the adolescent period may represent a unique developmental time frame in which to examine the neurological effects of prenatal drug exposure.

in the present studies we examined potential sex-dependent alterations in α <dig> adrenergic receptor density and function in adolescent rats following prenatal cocaine exposure. the idazoxan derivative, rx <dig>  was used to detect α <dig> adrenergic receptors. rx <dig> is a highly selective antagonist that identifies all the α <dig> adrenergic receptor subtypes with similar affinity  <cit> . we first used this well-characterized ligand to determine α <dig> receptor density and binding affinity in adolescent rats that received cocaine in utero. we then commenced a more detailed receptor autoradiographic study of the hippocampus, parietal cortex, amygdala, pyriform cortex and hypothalamus to determine whether sex differences in α <dig> receptors were present in adolescent rats prenatally exposed to cocaine. these studies were designed as part of a larger effort to understand the neurobiological basis of the previously reported attentional dysfunction in rats prenatally exposed to cocaine  <cit> .

RESULTS
weight/growth parameters
the mean offspring body weights  were unaffected by prenatal cocaine exposure. previous reports have shown that this regimen of in utero cocaine treatment had no effects on maternal weight gain, litter size, gestational length, sex ratio, offspring weight on postnatal day  <dig>  or pup survival  <cit> .

α2-adrenergic receptor density: tissue homogenates
results of tissue homogenate binding studies are displayed in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  the affinity of rx <dig> for α2-adrenergic receptors did not differ significantly by sex or prenatal cocaine exposure in all groups, the displacement of rx <dig> by unlabeled rx <dig> was close to unity  suggesting displacement from a single binding site. labeling of α2-adrenergic receptors by rx <dig> was sex-dependent within the saline group with females displaying  <dig> % higher density of α2-adrenergic receptors than males. the number of α2-adrenergic receptors labeled with  <dig>  nm rx <dig> following prenatal cocaine exposure was significantly increased [f =  <dig> ; p ≤  <dig> ) in both males and females. this effect was most profound in cocaine-exposed males, as they exhibited a  <dig> % increase in α2-adrenergic receptor density, relative to saline treated males [f =  <dig> ; p ≤  <dig> ). thus, prenatal cocaine produced alterations in α2-adrenergic receptor density in the hippocampus without changes in binding affinity.

α2-adrenergic receptor density: autoradiography
representative rx <dig> autoradiograms are depicted in figure  <dig>  tissue sections incubated with  <dig> nm rx <dig> exhibited both sex- and cocaine-induced alterations in α2-adrenergic receptor density. following prenatal exposure to cocaine, the density of α2-adrenergic receptors demonstrated a significant interaction between region, sex and cocaine . the binding of rx <dig> to α2-adrenergic receptors exhibited significant differences between region and sex within the saline group . prenatal cocaine exposure significantly affected the density of α2-adrenergic receptors in male rats across the regions examined .

in control animals prenatally exposed to saline, the density of hippocampal ca <dig> α2-adrenergic receptors in female rats was significantly  higher than the density of α2-adrenergic receptors observed in male controls . in the area ca <dig> of the hippocampus, a significant interaction between drug treatment and sex was observed . similar to tissue homogenates, laconosum-moleculare layer of area ca <dig> hippocampal α2-adrenergic receptors were upregulated 21% in male offspring following cocaine exposure , whereas α2-adrenergic receptors did not significantly differ in females.

of the other brain regions examined, only the parietal cortex and central nucleus of the amygdala exhibited alterations in α2-adrenergic receptor density following prenatal cocaine exposure. in the parietal cortex, a significant effect of drug was observed , with no effect of sex or interaction between sex and prenatal drug treatment . in the amygdala, the density of α2-adrenergic receptors was significantly  higher in males compared to females from the saline group . prenatal cocaine exposure increased the number of α2-adrenergic receptors in the amygdala from female rats compared to saline treated females  such that the density of α2-adrenergic receptors in this region was similar to the density observed in male rats . there were no effects of either sex or prenatal drug exposure on the density of α2-adrenergic receptors in either the pyriform cortex or periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus.

discussion
the present study found alterations in α <dig> adrenergic receptor density in the adolescent brain subsequent to prenatal cocaine exposure. adolescence represents a period of vulnerability for substance abuse and age-dependent sensitivity to drugs. receptor alterations expressed during adolescence may modify essential transitions necessary for producing normal adult brain function  <cit> . prenatal iv cocaine exposure appears to alter normal development of the ne receptor systems, leading to altered adolescent ne brain systems.

in general, catecholamine receptor density and function appear to be particularly plastic during the adolescent period. for example, dopamine d <dig> and d <dig> receptors are overproduced and eliminated  in male rats during adolescence  <cit> . the distribution of α <dig> adrenergic receptors has been reported to generally resemble adult patterns by p <dig>  <cit> ; however, functional studies have demonstrated decreased depolarized release of ne and a greater capacity for ne reuptake in the hypothalamus  is present in rats during the adolescent period  <cit> . sex differences in ne content have also been reported in several brain regions in adolescent animals   <cit> . prenatal cocaine exposure has been shown to result in increased levels of ne in the preoptic region of male, but not female, adult rats  <cit> . previous reports of α <dig> adrenergic receptor distribution used pooled male and female rat brains without presenting statistical analysis on sex differences  <cit> . furthermore, the number of animals used from each litter was unclear. therefore the current studies are the first to report baseline sex differences in α <dig> adrenergic receptor density in adolescent animals, as well as alterations in density related to prenatal cocaine exposure in this age group.

prenatal cocaine exposure may alter α <dig> adrenergic receptors density by affecting development of the lc. the entire ne input to the rat hippocampus is provided by lc neurons, primarily from the dorsal one-third of the lc  <cit> . in early lc development, approximately 7% of the neurons are generated on gd <dig>  75% on gd <dig> and 18% on gd <dig>  <cit> . lc neurons and their processes synthesize ne as early as 12– <dig> days gestation  <cit>  well before synaptogenesis is underway in the terminal fields. efferent lc fibers first appear in the neocortical terminal fields on gd <dig> and these fibers are proposed to play a major role in induction and differentiation of neural tissue  <cit> . hippocampal neurons are generated three days after the lc neurons  <cit> . the late gestational period of the rat is distinguished by continued fiber organization and ramification in the lc terminal fields  <cit> . a recent study, using the same cocaine dose and route of administration used in the current study, demonstrated that prenatal cocaine exposure during the development of lc neurons inhibits the growth of lc neuritis  <cit> . cocaine binding sites are evident in the fetal brain as early as gd <dig> and by gd <dig> the kd of cocaine binding is similar to the kd values observed in adulthood  <cit> . thus, our prenatal cocaine exposure covers the period of lc neuronal genesis and ne axonal proliferation in the terminal fields, during which time these systems are sensitive to disruption by cocaine.

adolescent brain development may represent a critical developmental stage in which prenatal cocaine effects may be expressed in a sex-dependent manner. our findings of α <dig> adrenergic receptor upregulation in male rat hippocampus may be a compensatory response to cocaine-mediated increases in norepinephrine concentration during prenatal development. interestingly, female offspring did not show a similar robust increase in α <dig> adrenergic receptor density in the hippocampus. however, in the amygdala the α <dig> adrenergic receptors were increased in females subsequent to prenatal cocaine exposure. in other regions such as the pyriform cortex, no changes attributable to cocaine were found. our findings suggest sex-specific expression of cocaine-mediated alterations displayed in adolescence. sex-specific alterations in receptor density may be restricted to particular brain regions, differ in directionality, and may not reflect global brain alterations.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, iv exposure of pregnant rats to cocaine produced persistent, sex-specific alterations in the ne systems of adolescent offspring. disruption of forebrain ne systems during the prenatal period might be the neurobiological basis for a number of functional disturbances occurring as a consequence of prenatal cocaine exposure.
