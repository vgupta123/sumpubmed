BACKGROUND
during their infection attempt, microbes activate intracellular signaling cascades in their potential host. specific pattern-recognition receptors  from the host recognize conserved microbe-associated molecular patterns  or certain signature molecules resulting from tissue damage, often designated as damage-associated molecular patterns   <cit> . prrs are typically receptor-like kinases , such as fls <dig> , efr  or pepr1/pepr <dig> . these recognize the mamps, flg <dig> , elf <dig>  and the damp, atpep <dig>  respectively  <cit> . upon binding of the respective ligand  <cit> , fls <dig>  pepr1/pepr <dig> or efr hetero-oligomerize with bak <dig> , a kinase originally found as an interactor of the brassinosteroid hormone receptor, bri <dig>  <cit> . recent structural studies indicate that bak <dig> is also in direct contact with the c-terminal part of the fls2-bound flg <dig>  and may thus be considered a co-receptor  <cit> . accordingly, bak <dig> mutants are impaired in responses to these mamps/damps  <cit> . thus, bak <dig> acts as protein partner  for multiple pathways in plant immunity and development  <cit> . on the other hand, signaling induced by other mamps, such as chitin is independent of bak <dig>  <cit> . this difference may be a consequence of the different structure of the potential receptor required for perceiving chitin, cerk <dig> , a lysm-containing rlk in arabidopsis  <cit>  as compared to the lrr-type rlks such as fls <dig>  efr or pepr1/r <dig> 

among the earliest signaling events after mamp/damp perception are ion fluxes across the plasma membrane including influx of calcium into the cytosol  <cit> . the elevation of cytosolic calcium is detected by a number of calcium-binding “decoder” proteins such as calmodulins or calcium-dependent protein kinases  or calcineurin b-like  proteins and their partners, cbl-interacting protein kinases  to further transmit the signal  <cit> . calcium, as a signaling molecule, is a prerequisite for most downstream responses elicited by mamps/damps. for instance, production of reactive oxygen species  by the nadph oxidase, rbohd, in arabidopsis  <cit>  is a calcium-dependent process stimulated by direct binding of calcium to ef-hands in the n-terminus of rbohd. furthermore, the calcium-dependent protein kinase  <dig>  phosphorylates rbohd to promote its activity  <cit> . activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases  also requires calcium since depletion of extracellular calcium or inhibition of calcium channels block mamp-induced mapk activation  <cit> .

the importance of calcium for plant immunity is also indirectly supported by the observation that phytopathogenic bacteria secrete extracellular polysaccharides to sequester apoplastic calcium and attenuate host mamp signaling  <cit> . however, much of plant calcium signaling remains to be discovered, in particular, the steps between perception of mamps/damps and generation of the calcium signals. we used an apoaequorin-expressing transgenic arabidopsis thaliana line to investigate mamp signaling events in whole seedlings  <cit> . aequorin is a calcium sensitive reporter for measuring changes in cellular calcium levels  <cit> . upon binding calcium, it oxidizes the bound coelenterazine prosthetic group into excited coelenteramide, which emits blue light at 469 nm. the so-called l/lmax ratio of the aequorin-generated luminescence  to the total remaining aequorin  is used as an estimate of relative calcium levels. with the appropriate calibration parameters, it is also possible to convert the l/lmax values into absolute cytosolic calcium concentrations  <cit> .

we previously demonstrated that the aequorin-based measurement is amenable to high throughput screening and used it to isolate mutants with a “changed calcium elevation ” phenotype after flg <dig> elicitation. the first sets of identified cce mutants were the fls <dig> receptor and its partner kinase, bak <dig>  <cit> . these mutants represent proof-of-principle of the suitability of the screen in finding signaling components between ligand recognition and calcium flux. this current work reports the characterization of the cce <dig> mutant and the identification of the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase , pbs1-like  <dig>  being the cce <dig> gene, where pbs <dig> stands for avrpphb sensitive  <dig>  an rlck targeted by the pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola protease avrpphb  <cit> . the analysis of mutants of three related rlcks revealed an additional requirement of botrytis-induced kinase  <dig>  for the mamp/damp-induced calcium elevation.

RESULTS
the changed calcium elevation  <dig>  mutant is affected in early signaling
four other independently isolated changed calcium elevation  mutants did not restore a “normal” calcium response to flg <dig> in the f <dig> generation when crossed to the previously described cce <dig> mutant  <cit>  . the lack of complementation suggests that these five cce mutants are allelic and thus designated as cce5- <dig> to cce5- <dig>  all five cce <dig> mutant lines show a reduced flg22- and elf18-induced calcium rise compared to the parental hva <dig> line; however, the reduction in the elf18-induced calcium levels appears to be stronger than with flg <dig> . correspondingly, elf18-induced mapk activation was partially reduced and delayed . surprisingly, the reduction in flg22-induced mapk activation was not as obvious as for elf <dig>  it was only visible if a lower concentration  of the flg <dig> peptide was used; at higher concentrations, no difference in comparison to hva <dig> was discernible . thus, cce <dig> may have different signaling role for these two mamps. similarly, other rapid responses such as reactive oxygen species  accumulation was also reduced for the cce <dig> alleles, when treated with flg <dig> or elf <dig> . since mapk activation and ros accumulation occur within minutes upon elicitation, cce <dig> is “mutated” in some early signaling component.figure  <dig>

differential mamp/damp response of the cce <dig> mutants is reminiscent of a bak1-dependent response, but cce <dig> is not bak1
the background line for the cce <dig> mutants carries the so-called “hva1” transgene , where the aequorin reporter is targeted to the tonoplast outer surface, which detects calcium exiting the vacuole but does not permit determination of absolute calcium concentrations  <cit> . in order to perform calibrations required for calculating absolute calcium concentrations, and to also confirm the effect of the cce <dig> mutation on cytosolic calcium levels, the five cce <dig> alleles were crossed into a hva <dig> line  that was additionally transformed with a cytosolic apoaequorin  construct. these “back-crossed” lines also reduce possible effects from secondary mutations arising from the chemical mutagenesis. seedlings from the f <dig> populations were screened for the reduced mamp-induced calcium phenotype to identify homozygous cce <dig> plants and the mutations were verified by caps marker analysis . using these lines, a survey of different mamps/damps showed reduced calcium responses to flg <dig>  elf <dig> and atpep <dig> but a normal response to chitin octamers  in cce <dig> . this differential phenotype to various mamp/damps is reminiscent of a “bak1-dependent” type of response, where bak <dig> is not required for the calcium elevation induced with ch <dig>  <cit> .figure  <dig>

mutants. to enable absolute cytosolic calcium measurements, the parental hva <dig>  line was transformed with the pmaq <dig> construct  and used as a reference. the indicated genotypes were crossed with hva1-p . seedlings from the f <dig> populations were screened for the cce phenotype to identify homozygous cce <dig> plants, the mutations verified by caps marker analysis, and the progenies used for calcium measurements. error bars represent standard errors of the mean.



bak <dig> is the bri1-associated receptor kinase shown to interact with fls <dig>  efr and pepr1/r <dig> receptors in a ligand-dependent manner  <cit> . to exclude that the cce <dig> mutants are weak alleles of bak <dig> or the related somatic embryogenesis related kinase  members, cce5- <dig> was crossed to the mutants bak1- <dig>  serk4- <dig> and serk5- <dig>  <cit> . since the cce <dig> effect was most prominent for elf <dig> elicitation, we measured elf18-induced calcium fluxes in f <dig> seedlings, and observed that the cce <dig> phenotype was complemented . this result indicates that cce <dig> is not allelic to bak <dig>  serk <dig> or serk <dig> and hence cce <dig> is mutated in a different gene.figure  <dig>

pbl <dig> or pbs1-like  <dig> belongs to subfamily vii of rlcks  that include the founding member avrpphb-susceptible  <dig>   <cit>  and the botrytis-induced kinase  <dig>   <cit> . to further validate that cce <dig> is pbl <dig>  a t-dna insertion mutant of pbl <dig> was isolated. for comparison, t-dna mutants of related members of this family of rlcks shown to be involved in pti   <cit> , were also obtained. the t-dna mutants were crossed with the cytosolic aequorin-expressing  transgenic line. however, silencing of the aequorin reporter was observed in some crosses, and in these cases , an independently generated line with the apoaequorin expression driven by the ubiquitin <dig> promoter  was used for crossing.

consistent with the cce <dig> mutants, a reduced calcium elevation induced by flg <dig>  elf <dig> and atpep <dig> could be recapitulated in the pbl <dig> t-dna mutant . similarly, a bik <dig> t-dna mutant was compromised in calcium elevations induced by flg <dig>  elf <dig> and atpep <dig> whereas pbl <dig> and pbs <dig> showed no reduction in calcium elevation . in the experiments with pbl <dig> and pbs <dig>  a pbl <dig> line crossed with the pubq-aeq line was used as a control to demonstrate that the lack of phenotype in pbl <dig> and pbs <dig> is not due to a different aequorin reporter background. additionally, a pbl1bik <dig> double mutant showed further reduction of the flg22-, elf18- or atpep1-induced calcium elevations compared to the pbl <dig> and bik <dig> single mutants . one should also note that the altered calcium signature differs between the bik <dig> and pbl <dig> mutants . taken together, members of this rlck family contribute differentially to mamp/damp-induced calcium elevation and there are partial redundancies between pbl <dig> and bik <dig> figure  <dig>

 and pbs1
 mutants, crosses were made with an independently generated pubq-aeq line with the expression of the apoaequorin reporter driven by the ubiquitin- <dig> promoter. hence, the parental pubq-aeq line in col- <dig> background was used as a reference for the wild type calcium signature for pbl <dig> and pbs <dig>  . error bars represent standard errors.



differential downstream responses in the pbl <dig> and/or bik <dig> mutants
due to the possible trade-offs between defense and growth regulation, continuous activation of defense responses is often detrimental for plant growth. growth inhibition assays are thus a facile measure of defense activation. this is performed by comparing root lengths of seedlings grown on normal and mamp-containing agar plates. for this assay, we grew the two genotypes to be compared side-by-side on the same plate to eliminate differences that may arise between plates . two-way-anova was used to determine the statistical significance of differences in root lengths between the genotypes and the treatments, respectively. for simplicity, percent inhibition  is shown in figure  <dig>  to reduce the effects of secondary mutations, all cce <dig> mutants were backcrossed to the hva <dig> parent, screened for the cce phenotype and confirmed by caps marker analysis before the assay. reduced flg22-mediated growth inhibition compared to the corresponding background lines could be seen for all five backcrossed cce <dig> mutants  and the pbl <dig> t-dna mutant, but not for pbs <dig> and pbl <dig> . surprisingly, despite the reduced calcium increase , the bik <dig> mutant showed no reduction in root growth inhibition. there was also no additive growth reduction in the pbl1bik1double mutant . a direct comparison between the pbl <dig> single mutant and the pbl1bik1double mutant assayed on the same plate also showed no statistically significant difference in root growth inhibition . since pbl <dig> and bik <dig> expression levels in roots are quite similar , the differential impact on flg22-mediated growth reduction is not due to lack of bik <dig> expression in roots. thus, while pbl <dig> and bik <dig> have an impact on early signaling events like calcium increase, pbl <dig> plays a more important role than bik <dig> in the late root growth inhibition response to flg <dig>  on the other hand, bik <dig>  but not pbl <dig>  has been shown to play an important role in flg22-mediated resistance to subsequent pseudomonas syringae infection, while both bik <dig> and pbl <dig> regulate callose deposition induced by selected mamps and defense gene expression  <cit> . hence, pbl <dig> and bik <dig> have overlapping but also distinct roles in defense signaling/responses as is also reflected by the wildtype-like phenotype of pbl <dig> plants compared to the altered growth phenotype and the constitutive sa accumulation of bik <dig> mutants  <cit> .figure  <dig>

since calcium acts upstream of mapk activation  <cit> , we analyzed mapk activation in the t-dna mutants of pbl <dig>  bik <dig> and the double mutant. however, there was no reduction in mapk activation by flg <dig>  elf <dig> and pep <dig> in pbl <dig>  bik <dig> and pbl1bik <dig> compared to their col- <dig>  background line . this is in contrast to the reduced elf18-induced mapk activation  and the dose dependent reduction in flg22-induced mapk activation  in the cce <dig> mutants. since the reduction of mapk activation could be seen in multiple cce <dig> lines, the difference is unlikely to be due to secondary mutations in the ems-mutagenized lines.figure  <dig>

kinase activities and proper localization of rlcks determine downstream signaling
after mamp stimulation of plants, a reduced mobility of pbl <dig> and bik <dig> protein bands in polyacrylamide gels , indicative of in vivo phosphorylation of the kinases, has been reported  <cit> . since three of the cce <dig> alleles are predicted to encode pbl <dig> proteins with a single amino acid exchange , we tested these mutated pbl <dig> proteins as well as bik <dig> with regard to the gel mobility shift. as a negative control, we mutated the presumed myristoylation site  of pbl <dig> and bik <dig>  which is expected to prevent the proteins from targeting to the plasma membrane. all these constructs were tagged with a c-terminal ha epitope for western blot detection and transiently expressed in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts. a mobility shift could be seen for wild type pbl <dig> and bik <dig> after flg <dig> treatment of the protoplasts, but not for the g2a myristoylation site variants and the g70d, a97v and r172q pbl <dig> variants . this indicates that there is no in vivo phosphorylation of the mutated protein variants after flg <dig> treatment.figure  <dig> 
in vivo
phosphorylation of pbl <dig> or bik <dig> after flg <dig> treatment. protoplasts were transfected with plasmids expressing ha-tagged bik <dig> , pbl <dig> , or the indicated variants. after overnight expression of the proteins, the protoplasts were treated with  <dig> nm flg <dig> , harvested and subjected to western blotting with anti-ha. in vivo phosphorylation is implicated by a reduced mobility of the protein . amido black staining of the nitrocellulose membranes was used to estimate equal loading. in , autophosphorylation of the immunoprecipitated kinases was used to determine if the kinase activities have been compromised by the mutations. the experiment was performed three times with similar outcome. note that the autophosphorylation of the wild type  kinases in the untreated protoplasts is variable and typically low but a weak band can be seen . autophosphorylation of the g70d, a97v and r172q variants were always not visible .



to test if the kinase activities have been affected, we immunoprecipitated the proteins with anti-ha antibodies and incubated the immunoprecipitates in the presence of radioactive atp to enable autophosphorylation. after separation on a sds-polyacrylamide gel, radioactive signals corresponding to the proteins could be seen for the wild type and the g2a mutated pbl <dig> and bik <dig>  suggesting that these are still active kinases . notably, the wild type bik <dig> or pbl <dig> autophosphorylation signals are weak before flg <dig> treatment . however, compared to the wild type pbl <dig> protein, there was no  autophosphosphorylation of the g70d, a97v or r172q mutated pbl <dig> variants . taken together, these three cce <dig> mutations led to the loss of pbl <dig> kinase activity, while the mis-localization of pbl1g2a and bik1g2a proteins prevented the in vivo phosphorylation of these kinases after flg <dig> signaling.

as a final proof that pbl <dig> is required for the mamp-induced calcium elevation, we introduced a genomic dna fragment encompassing the pbl <dig> gene locus into the pbl <dig> t-dna mutant. this genomic fragment complemented the reduced calcium elevation  and the root growth inhibition  phenotype in pbl <dig>  as a negative control, mutation of the putative myristoylation site  prevented the complementation of the cce phenotype  as well as the flg22-induced root growth inhibition . hence, myristoylation and proper targeting of pbl <dig> to plasma membrane is essential for signaling function of pbl <dig> figure  <dig>

discussion
specific rlcks required for calcium signaling and mamp/damp signaling
using both forward and reverse genetics as well as complementation studies, we identified the cce <dig> gene as encoding the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, pbl <dig>  and with the cce <dig> mutants, we isolated five new pbl <dig> alleles. we further showed that another rlck, bik <dig>  but not pbs <dig> and pbl <dig>  is required for the mamp/damp-induced calcium elevation pathway. this is in agreement with a recent report that flg22-induced calcium flux is compromised in bik <dig>  <cit> . using these new pbl <dig> alleles and t-dna insertion mutants, a mamp-mediated root growth inhibition assay confirmed the requirement of pbl <dig> for downstream signaling leading to growth arrest. however, the bik <dig> mutation had no apparent effect on flg22-mediated growth arrest. thus, despite both pbl <dig> and bik <dig> mutants showing a reduced mamp/damp-induced calcium elevation, downstream growth arrest effects differ. one explanation is that pbl <dig> and bik <dig> are not simply redundant but also have distinct signaling roles, which is reinforced by other studies showing both overlapping and distinct requirements for pbl <dig> and bik <dig> in mamp-induced ros production, callose deposition, gene expression and pathogen resistance  <cit> . this notion is, in fact, evident from the different calcium signatures in the pbl <dig> and bik <dig> mutants . a second possibility is that a signaling critical threshold of cytoplasmic calcium level is not crucial or causal for determining the degree of growth inhibition , which would imply a more important signaling role of pbl <dig>  compared to bik <dig>  in mediating the possible trade-offs between growth and defense activation. it is possible that the inverse roles of bik <dig> as a positive regulator of defense but a negative regulator of brassinosteroid signaling  <cit>  contribute to this growth differences. recently, another rlck, pbl <dig>  was found to be the preferential substrate  of the cerk <dig> chitin receptor. by contrast, bak <dig>  which is already known to phosphorylate bik <dig>  hardly phosphorylated pbl <dig>  pbl <dig> also appears to be non-essential for flg <dig> signaling  <cit> . thus, depending on the ligand, different rlks or rlcks are recruited for signaling. these findings support the distinction of bak <dig> requirement for flg <dig>  elf <dig> and atpep <dig> signaling to that of chitin  <cit> . our data on pbl <dig> requirement for optimal calcium signaling induced by flg <dig>  elf <dig> and atpep <dig>  but not chitin , fits into this pattern. in conclusion, there appears to be a differential requirement for members of the rlck family downstream of the receptors for distinct mamp/damp signaling.

phosphorylation is essential for signal relay
the recruitment  of various rlks and rlcks at the plasma membrane after mamp/damp perception is indicative of the roles of phosphorylation cascades in early signaling. prior to stimulation, fls <dig> and bik <dig> are already in a protein complex  <cit>  and bak <dig> appears to be also in complex with bak1-interacting rlks   <cit> . within minutes after flg <dig> stimulation, fls <dig> recruits bak <dig>  <cit>  to phosphorylate bik <dig>  activated bik <dig>  in turn, cross-phosphorylates fls <dig> and bak <dig>  <cit> . bak <dig> also cross-phosphorylates fls <dig> but apparently at different residues as bik <dig>  <cit> . based on the autophosphorylation assay , the kinase activities of bik <dig> and pbl <dig> appear to be higher in the flg22-treated protoplasts. the lower activities of bik1/pbl <dig> in the untreated protoplasts may imply repression by some other components  prior to elicitation. along this idea, it is noteworthy that the n-terminal myristoylation bik1g2a and pbl1g2a mutants are routinely recovered with higher autophosphorylation levels. one may speculate that mis-localization of pbl1g2a and bik1g2a prevent contact with phosphatases that are presumably present in the fls2-bik <dig>  protein complex to restrict defense signaling. indeed, ser/thr protein phosphatase type 2a  has been shown to associate with bak <dig> and control the activation of prr complexes  <cit> ; and whether the same or similar pp2as negatively regulate bik <dig> or pbl <dig> remains to be demonstrated. recently, it was shown that both bak <dig> and bik <dig> are dual-specific kinases that modify both serine/threonine as well as tyrosine residues  <cit> . the complex series of phosphorylation between prrs, bak <dig>  bik <dig> and pbl <dig> are important as mutations abrogating activities of any of these kinases block signaling. as shown by mobility shifts in gel electrophoresis, the pbl <dig> protein, encoded by the cce <dig> gene, is apparently phosphorylated in vivo after mamp elicitation  <cit> . the loss  of the kinase activities of the cce5-derived protein variants reported here  corresponds to changes of important residues of the kinase domain. the g70d and a97v mutations are found in the atp binding region  while r172q is n-terminal to the active center within kinase subdomain vi . taken together with data from literature, the reduced calcium signaling of our newly isolated cce5/pbl <dig> alleles shows that kinase activities of pbl <dig>  are vital for early mamp/damp signaling.

is downstream mapk activation affected in the pbl <dig> and bik <dig> mutants?
downstream of pbl1/bik <dig> phosphorylation is calcium elevation, which, in turn, has been shown through pharmacological inhibitor studies to be required for downstream mapk activation  <cit> . however, despite an attenuation of calcium elevation, there was no reduction in mapk activation by flg <dig>  elf <dig> or atpep <dig> in the pbl <dig> and bik <dig> t-dna mutants as well as pbl1bik <dig> double mutant when compared to their col- <dig>  background line . this observation is in agreement with previous reports  <cit> . on the other hand, we observed a reduction/delay in elf18-induced mapk activation in the cce <dig> mutants , while for flg <dig>  a weak effect could be observed when a lower concentration of the flg <dig> peptide was used. a possible explanation for this discrepancy may be that the mutated or truncated cce <dig> proteins  are expressed by the cce <dig> alleles as opposed to the  lack of proteins in the t-dna insertion mutants. alternatively, the different genetic background of the mutants may also play a role. in all studies where no difference in mapk activation was observed, the mutations were in col- <dig>  while the cce <dig>  mutants have a c <dig> background. we previously reported that the c <dig> accession has higher levels of fls <dig> receptor while, on the basis of public gene expression profiling data, the opposite is true for the efr receptor  <cit> . several snps were also detected within the fls <dig> and efr genes of hva <dig>   <cit> , which may further contribute to the different sensitivities to flg <dig> and elf <dig>  together, this may explain the observed reduced elf18-induced mapk activation in the cce <dig> mutants but only a dose-dependent flg22-induced mapk response. along this notion, zhang et al.  <cit>  also reported that callose deposition in the pbl <dig> mutant was normal upon flg <dig> treatment but reduced when treated with elf <dig>  <cit> . thus, the differential mamp receptor levels and/or yet unknown alterations in other signaling components between genotypes may determine the sensitivity of the system in signal relay from pbl <dig> to the mapks and other downstream events. additionally, the rlck, ripk, phosphorylates rin <dig> and in analogy to the recognition of the rin <dig> phosphorylation by the rpm <dig> resistance protein as compared to recognition of rin <dig> cleavage by rps <dig>  <cit> , one could speculate that the mamp-induced rlck phosphorylation may also be differentially recognized by the differing configuration of resistance protein spectrum between arabidopsis accessions.

localization to the membrane is a prerequisite for pbl <dig> and bik <dig> function
besides its kinase activities, localization of pbl <dig> and bik <dig> appears to be important for complementation of the cce phenotype. bik <dig>  as a gfp fusion protein, has been shown to be plasma membrane-localized using heterologous expression in onion epidermal cells  <cit> . however, to our knowledge, it has never been experimentally determined whether this is due to targeting or recruitment by other proteins. castaway, an rlck required for organ abscission, showed reduced plasma membrane localization when a g2a mutation was introduced for the putative myristoylation site. myristoylation is often associated with palmitoylation to enhance membrane interactions. however, no further decrease of castaway localization was observed even when the neighboring palmitoylation site  was additionally mutated  <cit> . myristoylation is thought to provide the initial but weak interaction with the plasma membrane; stabilization of this membrane localization may be further strengthened through other modifications or interactions with resident plasma membrane-localized components  <cit> . we now show that the g2a mutation of the putative myristoylation site of pbl1/bik <dig> prevented signaling  although kinase  function is apparently intact. furthermore, the g2a variant did not complement the pbl <dig> mutation . in a similar manner, despite being cleaved by the avrpphb cysteine protease, the “active” pbs <dig> fragment that is recognized must be retained at the plasma membrane for rps <dig> activation  <cit> . in this case, plasma membrane targeting is mediated by s-acylation of a cysteine residue in the n-terminus of pbs <dig>  thus, not only the function of the pbs <dig> protein but also the recognition of its perturbation  requires correct membrane localization. taken together, localization of the rlcks to the proper cell compartment is crucial for function.

disabling rlck functions during pathogenesis blocks defense signaling
pbs <dig> is the founding member of the pbl  group. the pseudomonas avrpphb effector, a bacterial virulence protein injected into host cells, cleaves pbs <dig> via its cysteine protease activity  <cit> . subsequently, it was discovered that avrpphb can cleave at least  <dig> other pbs1-like rlcks  <cit> . their cleavage/removal represents a virulence function of avrpphb and suggests that these pbls/rlcks act in resistance mechanisms against bacteria. support for this notion is provided by studies involving the xanthomonas xopac effector, which appears to target multiple rlcks  <cit> . unlike avrpphb, xopac does not cleave but uridylates bik <dig> and ripk in susceptible plants  <cit> . this transfer of uridine 5′-monophosphate to conserved phosphorylation sites in the activation loop of bik <dig> and ripk, prevents phosphorylation, thereby reducing their kinase activities and consequently inhibiting downstream defense signaling. in accordance to the arms-race hypothesis, xopac appears to be a major avirulence factor for recognition in resistant plants such as the arabidopsis col- <dig> accession. furthermore, there is more growth of xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris expressing xopac in the pbl <dig> background. this suggests that the rlck, pbl <dig> is required for the xopac-triggered immunity  <cit> . these observations of various pathogen effectors targeting rlcks are in line with the presumed importance of rlcks in defense signaling. however, although avrpphb cleaves multiple pbls/rlcks  <cit> , only pbs <dig> cleavage is recognized by rps <dig>  <cit> . we report here that pbl <dig> and bik <dig>  but neither pbl <dig> nor pbs <dig>  are required for mamp/damp-induced calcium signaling . this raises the question of “why avrpphb would target pbs1” if pbs <dig> is not important for mamp-induced calcium signaling. in fact, there is no evidence so far for any importance of pbs <dig> in pathogen resistance. as proposed by zhang et al.  <cit> , one idea is that pbs <dig> may be a “decoy”  <cit>  evolved to recognize perturbation of the real targets of the pathogen effectors. in this case, pbl <dig> and bik <dig> would be such real avrpphb targets, which are relevant for cross-phosphorylation of the receptor complex components and the subsequent triggering of calcium and downstream defense signaling.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we showed the requirement for the two rlcks, pbl <dig> and bik <dig>  in mamp/damp-induced calcium signaling, and speculated on possible genotype variations that may differentially contribute to downstream signaling events. there are many more rlck genes in the genome  and it remains to be investigated whether these also affect early calcium signal transduction – perhaps in dependence on the type of mamp/damp ligands. the large number of available rlcks is presumably mirrored by an even wider repertoire of their downstream substrates. besides phosphorylating receptor complex components, bik <dig> was recently shown to target the nadph oxidase, rbohd, to control oxidative burst in a calcium-independent manner  <cit> . thus, a future challenge would be to identify the substrates of these various rlcks and elucidate their role in cellular signaling.
