BACKGROUND
the novel allo-cytoplasmic male sterility  system, nsa cms line, and the corresponding restorer system, nr <dig> line, have been successfully developed from somatic hybrids between brassica napus  and its wild relative sinapis arvensis  by fusing mesophyll protoplasts  <cit> . yeyou  <dig>  a chinese wild population cataloged into s. arvensis based on genetic analyses  <cit> , possesses valuable agricultural traits such as enhanced resistance to sclerotinia sclerotiorum, leptosphaeria maculans and insects, greater tolerance to low temperatures and drought, low contents of erucic acid and glucosinolates  <cit> , as well as a low incidence of pod shattering  <cit> . the nsa cms line contains the s. arvensis cytoplasm, which is essentially different from other rapeseed cms systems such as ogu <cit> , nap <cit> , pol <cit> , tour <cit>  and hau <cit> , based on their origins and molecular characterization  <cit> . and the cytoplasmic sterile gene in the nsa cms line was likely derived from the s. arvensis parent  <cit> . furthermore, the nsa cms line is more stable to temperature changes compared to pol and nap <cit> . nr <dig>  as a b. napuss. arvensis disomic alien addition line, carries one pair of homologous chromosomes from s. arvensis and  <dig> chromosome pairs from b. napus, and displays important agricultural characters which arise from the alien chromosomes, such as fertility restoration ability to nsa cms line, low erucic acid and low glucosinolate contents, s. sclerotiorum resistance and pod shattering resistance  <cit> .

fertile and sterile plants were derived from the self-pollinated offspring of the f <dig> hybrid between the novel restorer line nr <dig> and the nsa cms line. because nr <dig> contains one s. arvensis homologous chromosome pair, on which the restorer genes reside, f <dig> hybrids from nr <dig> crossed to nsa cms line are monosomic  <cit> . the fertility segregation was observed in self-pollinated plants of f <dig> hybrid because of the loss of added chromosome, producing fertile and sterile plants, which possess the identical cytoplasmic genetic background arising from nsa cms line and similar nuclear genetic background arising from b. napus, except one or two members of the added s. arvensis alien chromosome pair in fertile plants. floral morphology of fertile plants are normal, whereas sterile plants have stamens reduced in size, abnormal anthers and no pollen produced.

to elucidate gene expression and regulation caused by the a and c subgenomes, alien chromosome and cytoplasm from s. arvensis during the development of young floral bud, especially stamens, we performed a genome-wide high-throughput transcriptomic sequencing for young floral buds of sterile and fertile plants. the transcriptome is the complete set and quantity of transcripts in a cell at a specific developmental stage or under a physiological condition, providing information on gene expression, gene regulation, and amino acid content of proteins  <cit> . therefore, transcriptome analysis is essential to interpret the functional elements of the genome and reveals the molecular constituents of cells and tissues. because of the deep coverage and single base-pair resolution provided by the next-generation sequencing instrument, digital gene-expression , driven by solexa/illumina technology, is an efficient method to analyze transcriptome data. base on genome-wide expression profiles by sequencing, dge is able to identify, quantify, and annotate expressed genes on the whole genome level without prior sequence knowledge, opening doors to higher confidence target discovery and pathway studies. this technique has also been widely used in plant research. dge analysis using solexa sequencing was performed to identify candidate genes encoding enzymes responsible for the siraitia grosvenorii triterpene biosynthesis  <cit> . high-throughput tag-sequencing analysis based on the solexa genome analyzer platform was applied to analyze the gene expression profiling of cucumber plant and revealed the comprehensive mechanisms of waterlogging-responsive transcription  <cit> . using the solexa sequencing system, the transcriptomes were compared between seedlings of two soybean varieties to find genes associated with nitrogen use efficiency  <cit> . early developing cotton fiber was analyzed by deep-sequencing, and differential expression patterns of genes in a fuzzless/lintless mutant were revealed  <cit> . dge signatures were also used to study maize development, and the results from that study provided a basis for the analysis of short-read expression data and resolved specific expression signatures that will help define mechanisms of action of the maize ra <dig> gene  <cit> . in addition, solexa / illumina technology was used to analyze gene expression during female flower development  <cit>  and gene expression of sinapis alba leaves under drought stress and rewatering growth conditions  <cit> . overall, the dge approach has provided more valuable tools for qualitative and quantitative gene expression analysis than the previous micro array-based assays.

currently, no progress has been made in identifying the genes that specify cms and fertility restoration in nsa cms and nr <dig> system, and little is understood about how expression of these genes influences the physiological, developmental or biochemical processes such that pollen formation is disrupted. in this study, the transcriptomes of young floral buds were compared between fertile and sterile plants using the solexa sequencing system. by investigating the expression of genes related to young floral bud development, a number of candidate genes that are important in this process were identified. here, to our knowledge, this study is the first to characterize genome-wide comparative analysis of gene expression in young floral buds between fertile and sterile plants. and these sequencing datasets will serve as a valuable resource for novel gene discovery from yeyou  <dig>  the chinese wild population of s. arvensis, laying the foundation for elucidating the mechanisms of cytoplasmic male sterility, fertility restoration and improved resistance.

RESULTS
selection of fertile and sterile plants
to obtain the plant materials with the closest genetic background, fertile and sterile plants were made from the self-pollinated offspring of the f <dig> hybrid between novel restorer line nr <dig> and nsa cms line. the cytoplasmic genetic background of fertile plants is the same as that of sterile plants, arising from nsa cms line. both the fertile and sterile plants had the complete set of chromosomes from b. napus, however, there was one or two members of the added s. arvensis alien chromosome pair in the fertile plants. and thus there were prominently morphological differences appearing at the early anther stage between fertile and sterile buds which were less than 2 mm in diameter . anthers of fertile bud were larger and fuller than those of sterile bud . the corresponding cross sections of anthers at this stage showed that in contrast to this early stage in fertile bud, during which four laterally symmetrical locules developed, with two identical adaxial locules and two identical abaxial locules, in sterile bud the loss of locules per anther was evident . at the late anther stage during which mature pollens were released, floral morphology and architecture of fertile plants were normal, whereas sterile plants had defective male flower organs , and had otherwise normal flowers .


cms-related abnormalities may involve different stages during the formation of male organs and pollen. in many cms types, the anther development or pollen maturation are impaired. the defect can appear before, during or after meiosis of pollen mother cells resulting in gametophytic or sporophytic cms types  <cit> . although the morphology of normal anther and flower development had been characterized in this study, no detailed morphological comparison of the development of fertile versus sterile anthers was available. to address this, serial sections of fertile and cms floral buds, representing different development stages of anther, would be compared in further work.

solexa sequencing
table  <dig> showed that the result of solexa sequencing and the distribution of distinct clean tags. a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> raw tags were sequenced in sterile plants  and fertile plants  libraries, respectively. after filtering out low quality data ,  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> tags  remained in ste and fer libraries, respectively. to increase the robustness of the approach, single-copy tags in the two libraries  were excluded from further analysis. as a result, a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean tags remained from the two libraries, from which  <dig>   and  <dig>   distinct tags were obtained. the fer library had higher number of distinct tags, and showed higher ratio of number of distinct clean tags to total clean tags, and lower percentage of distinct high copy number tags than ste library. these data suggested that more genes were detected in the fer library than in the ste library, and more transcripts were expressed at lower levels in fer library. there were  <dig>  more distinct tags in the fer than in the ste library, possibly representing genes related to floral stamen development. the percentage of distinct tags rapidly declined as copy number increased, indicating only a small portion of the transcripts were expressed at high level in the conditions tested. the frequency of these distinct tags was shown in table  <dig>  which listed the copy numbers in the range 2– <dig> or higher, in which the majority of distinct tags  were present at low copy numbers , and less than 20% tags from each library were counted between  <dig> and  <dig> times. only approximately  <dig> % tags were detected more than  <dig> times. the data used in this publication have been deposited in ncbi's gene expression omnibus  <cit>  and are accessible through geo series accession number gse <dig> .


annotation analysis of the distinct tag
the full genome sequence for b. napus is not available. as described by ‘u’s triangle’, the three diploid species b. rapa , brassica nigra  and b. oleracea  formed the amphidiploid species b. juncea , b. napus  and b. carinata  by hybridization  <cit> . in addition, there was a close relationship between the s. arvensis and b. nigra <cit> . therefore, to identify the genes corresponding to the distinct tags in each library, all distinct sequencing tags were annotated using all possible catg+17-nt sequences of the genome and transcriptome of b. rapa <cit>  and those of b. oleracea  as the reference sequences, respectively, allowing only a 1-bp mismatch . altogether,  <dig>   <dig> genes  and  <dig>   <dig> ones  had the catg sites, resulting in a total number of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> unambiguous reference tags, respectively, for b. oleracea and b. rapa. by assigning the experimental distinct solexa tags to the virtual reference ones, we observed that  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>   <dig>  tags were perfectly matched to the b. oleracea reference genes,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>   <dig>  tags were perfectly matched to the b. rapa reference genes, respectively, in ste and fer libraries. out of the tags matched to reference genes, approximately 10% were mapped to multiple locations, including low complexity tags with poly tails and tags which derived from repetitive sequences and were mapped to highly conserved domains shared by different genes. in addition, approximately 3% tags in two libraries were mapped to the antisense strands, demonstrating that those regions might be bidirectionally transcribed. the tags unmatched to the reference genes were then blasted against the genome of b. rapa and b. oleracea, respectively, and approximately 10% tags were matched to the genomic sequences in the two libraries. these might represent non-annotated genes or noncoding transcripts that derived from intergenic regions. as a result of the significant sequencing depth of solexa technology, incomplete annotation of the genome of b. rapa or b. oleracea and one added s. arvenis chromosome, however, about 25% unmatched tags in each library were observed.


to estimate whether or not the sequencing depth was sufficient for the transcriptome coverage, the sequencing saturation was analyzed in two libraries. the genes that were mapped by all clean tags and unambiguous clean tags increased with the total number of tags. however, when the sequencing counts reached  <dig> million tags or higher, the number of detected genes was saturated .

differential gene expression between the ste and fer libraries
based on “the significance of digital gene expression profiles”  <cit> , a rigorous algorithm was developed to identify the differentially expressed genes  in the two samples. the expression abundance of tag mapped genes in the data sets was analyzed by counting the number of transcripts per million  clean tags. first, the read density measurement was normalized as described in detail by benjamini and yekutieli  <cit> . fdr ≤  <dig>  and the absolute value of |log2ratio|≥  <dig> were as thresholds to judge the significance of differences in transcript abundance. differences of tag frequencies that appeared in the ste and fer libraries were used for estimating gene expression levels. the distribution of fold-changes in tag number between the two libraries was shown in figure 2a. the great majority of tags were observed at similar levels, showing a < 5-fold difference in the two libraries. tags with five folds or greater differences in accumulation accounted for  <dig> %, including  <dig> % tags which increased by at least five folds and  <dig> % tags which were decreased by at least five folds in the fer library . the transcripts detected with at least two-fold differences in the two libraries were shown in figure 2b . the red dots and green dots represented transcripts higher or lower in abundance for more than two folds in fer library, respectively. the blue dots represented transcripts that differed less than two folds between the two libraries, which were arbitrarily designated as “no difference in expression” . by comparing our two solexa libraries, a great number of differentially expressed transcripts were identified. and based on above a rigorous algorithm, there were  <dig> genes of b. rapa  and  <dig> genes of b. oleracea  which were detected with significant differential expression levels. these included both up-regulated and down-regulated genes in fer. of the  <dig> up-regulated b. rapa genes,  <dig> genes were uniquely expressed in fer, and  <dig> of the  <dig> down-regulated genes were only expressed in ste, whereas there were  <dig> genes of the  <dig> up-regulated b. oleracea genes, which were specially expressed in fer, and  <dig> of the  <dig> down-regulated genes were only expressed in ste . in addition, there were  <dig> specially expressed tags in fer, which were neither mapped to b. oleracea nor mapped to b. rapa, and these unique tags were presumed to localize on the alien chromosome .


gene ontology functional analysis of degs
gene ontology  is an international standardized gene functional classification system that describes properties of genes and their products in any organism, containing three ontologies: molecular function, cellular component and biological process. a total of  <dig>  degs of b. rapa and  <dig> degs of b. oleracea that could be categorized into  <dig> categories were found . these degs were involved in biochemistry, metabolism, growth, development, and apoptosis. among the biological process category, metabolic process  was the most dominant group, followed by cellular process , response to stimulus , and developmental process . there were two special processes, including cell killing which was unique to b. rapa, and locomotion which was unique to b. oleracea. regarding molecular functions,  <dig> % of the b. rapa unigenes and 42% of the b. oleracea unigenes were assigned to binding, followed by catalytic activity , transporter activity , and structural molecule activity . and metallochaperone function was unique to b. rapa. in the cellular compo-nent category, cell and cell part  were the dominant groups, followed by intracellular  and intracellular part .


to reveal significantly enriched go terms in degs comparing to the genome background, go enrichment analysis of functional significance was performed. the go term with p ≤  <dig>  was defined as significantly degs enriched go term. this analysis allowed us to determine the major biological functions, biological processes and cellular components with which degs were associated. for molecular function, significantly enriched go terms of degs in b. rapa  and b. oleracea  included transferase activity , aldehyde-lyase activity and oxidoreductase activity, and zinc ion transmembrane transporter activity was specific to b. rapa. for enriched biological processes, there were  <dig> go terms of degs from b. oleracea  and  <dig> go terms of degs from b. rapa , which participated in morphogenesis , development , metabolic process , ion transport , lipid localization and response to stimulus .

pathway analysis for degs
different genes cooperate to achieve their biological functions. pathway-based analysis helps to further understand the biological functions of degs. biological pathways, including metabolic pathways, signal transduction pathways, protein transport and degradation pathways, and genetic information processing pathways, were identified by kegg pathway analysis of the degs, using the major public pathway-related database  <cit> . obtained pathways corresponding to degs from b. oleracea and b. rapa were listed in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. significantly enriched pathways that up-regulated and down-regulated genes were involved in were identified by the same statistical algorithms used in the go analysis. in this study, the enriched pathways were ‘metabolic pathways’  which were large complexes comprising several metabolism patterns, such as ‘amino acid metabolism’, ‘carbohydrate metabolism’, ‘nitrogen metabolism’ and ‘biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites’, ‘cellular process pathways’ , ‘genetic information processing pathways’  and ‘organismal systems pathways’  . and genomic manipulation of these genes which were involved in pathways might be important for elucidate the mechanisms of cytoplasmic male sterility, fertility restoration and improved resistance.


expressed genes specific to sterile and fertile plants
fertile plants carry one or two members of an added homologous chromosome pair from s. arvenis besides the complete set of chromosomes of b. napus compared with sterile plants. it was proposed that degs specific to fertile plants comprised genes associated with floral development and fertility restoration, whereas degs specific to sterile plants may be involved in cms. using b. rapa as reference, a total of  <dig> degs were only expressed in fertile plants, and  <dig> degs were specific to sterile plants, while using b. oleracea as reference, a total of  <dig> degs were only expressed in fertile plants, and  <dig> degs were specific to sterile plants . by comparing the go terms of these degs, for cellular component, go terms which were exclusive to fertile plants contained cell envelope, cell projection, endomembrane system, extracellular region part, membrane-enclosed lumen, non-membrane-bounded organelle, organelle lumen and organelle membrane, whereas only cell fraction go term was specific to sterile plants. for molecular function, go terms only belonging to fertile plants were enzyme regulator, structural molecule, transcription regulator and translation regulator. for biological process, four go terms were specific to fertile plants, including anatomical structure formation, cellular component biogenesis, cellular component organization and rhythmic process. no go terms were specific to sterile plants for molecular function and biological process. the above results were shown in figure  <dig> 


degs encoding transcription factors
transcription factors are essential for the regulation of gene expression. changes in gene transcription are associated with changes in expression of transcription factors. our dge results showed that among the significantly degs, there were forty-five transcription factors for b. rapa, including fifteen up-regulated and thirty down-regulated genes . among up-regulated b. rapa transcriptional factors, six ones were specific to fer plants, including calmodulin-binding protein, mutant tfiif-alpha, tbp <dig> , tbp <dig>  . for b. oleracea, there were fifty-seven transcription factors whose expression were dramatically altered, including thirty-nine down-regulated and eighteen up-regulated genes among which six ones were only expressed in fer. and these transcription factors were atnac <dig>  athsfa <dig>  transcription factor iid- <dig> and three unknown proteins . further study would be needed to reveal the molecular basis of gene expressional regulation.

genes involved in carbon metabolism
many genes involved in carbon metabolism were differentially expressed between fer and ste. altered expressions of numerous genes involved in pentose phosphate pathway, starch and sucrose metabolism, fructose and mannose metabolism and carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms were observed. for example, in b. rapa, twenty genes involved in pentose phosphate pathway showed changed expression. those genes with increased transcript abundance in fer encoded glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase , three proteins transferring phosphorus-containing groups , transaldolase-like pro-tein , ribose-phosphate pyrophosphokinase 1/phosphoribosyl diphosphate synthetase  <dig>  , members performing aldehyde-lyase activity , and the tpms for these transcripts were up-regulated by  <dig>  to  <dig> -fold. the eighty-four genes involved in starch and sucrose metabolism were differentially expressed including two genes encoding udp-glucosyltransferase proteins  and six genes encoding carbohydrate phosphatase proteins . their expressions were increased by  <dig>  to  <dig> -fold in fer. in fructose and mannose metabolism, there were five down-regulated genes, including 6-phosphofructokinase protein family  and phosphoglucomutase-like protein , and five up-regulated gene including pfkb-type carbohydrate kinase family protein  and fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase .

degs involved in citrate cycle  and oxidative phosphorylation
mitochondria are the cellular site of numerous metabolic pathways including the tricarboxylic acid cycle , respiratory electron transfer and atp synthesis  <cit> . the amplification, recombination and rearrangement of mitochondrial genomes could cause dysfunction of mitochondria leading to cms. altered flower phenotype or defects in pollen formation are presumed to be secondary effects of the mitochondrial mutation, and the primary defect may be a reduction in the efficiency of respiration or the impairment of other mitochondrial function. using b. rapa sequences as reference, altered expressions of numerous genes involved in the citrate cycle and oxidative phosphorylation were observed. for example, a total of  <dig> degs were involved in tca cycle and  <dig> of which showed decreased transcript abundance in ste. down-regulated genes in ste encoded class ii fumarase , succinate dehydrogenase , plastid e <dig> subunit of pyruvate decarboxylase , citrate-synthase , dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase , iaa-conjugate-resistant  <dig> , and nadp-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase , whereas malate dehydrogenase  <dig>  was up-regulated. in addition, twenty degs were involved in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. nine genes were associated with nadh dehydrogenase, one gene was associated with succinate dehydrogenase/fumarate redutase and ten genes were involved in atp synthase. using b. oleracea sequences as reference,  <dig> degs were involved in tca cycle and  <dig> of which performed the same biological function as degs from b. rapa in tca cycle. according the above results, we then provided an overview about cms in sterile plants and fertility restoration in fertile plants in figure  <dig> 


genes involved in oxidoreductase activity
in enriched go terms, oxidoreductase activity was the most enriched term. in b. rapa,  <dig> degs were involved in oxidoreductase activity, including  <dig> members acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donors, nad or nadp as acceptor. for instance, fatty acyl-coa reductase / oxidoreductase , also named ms <dig> , acting on the ch-ch group of donors, nad or nadp as acceptor, was specific to fer. others were oxidoreductase, acting on the ch-ch group of donors , cinnamoyl-coa reductase family , 3-chloroallyl aldehyde dehydrogenase/ aldehyde dehydrogenase , nad dependent epimerase/dehydratase family , aldehyde oxidase , nad or nadh binding/catalytic/ glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , cytosolic factor family protein/phosphoglyceride transfer family protein , cobalamin-independent methionine synthase , and unnamed oxidoreductase members .

differential expressed ppr proteins
proteins which encode pentatricopeptide repeat  motif are proposed to function as site-specific, rna-binding adaptor proteins that mediate interactions between rna substrates and the enzymes that act on them  <cit> . ppr proteins have a central role in plant mitochondrial biogenesis  <cit> . most cloned restorer genes encode mitochondria-targeted ppr proteins  <cit> . in this study, when used b. rapa as reference sequences, there were nine ppr proteins showed differential expression, including two up-regulated ppr proteins  and seven down-regulated ppr proteins  in fer. these ppr proteins were good candidates for studying the link between nuclear and mitochondrial gene expression.

confirmation of tag-mapped genes by qrt-pcr
to confirm the reliability of solexa/illumina sequencing technology, fifteen genes were randomly selected for quantitative rt-pcr assays. the results showed that expressions of fourteen genes were consistent between the qrt-pcr and the dge analyses . and the corresponding primers were listed in table  <dig>  for the gene which showed the inconsistency between qpcr and dge, it was likely attributable to the fact that dge was more sensitive in the detection of low-abundant transcripts and small changes in gene expression than qpcr.


discussion
global gene transcription changes in fer and ste plants
a global analysis of transcriptome could facilitate the identification of systemic gene expression and regulatory mechanisms. in the present study, a transcriptome profiling of young buds was performed to identify genes that are differentially expressed in fer and ste plants. a sequencing depth of  <dig>  million tags per library was reached , and more than 71% unique tags were matched with the genome and transcriptome of b. rapa and b. oleracea, respectively, suggesting that the database selected was relatively complete. because fertile plants carried one chromosome from s. arvensis besides  <dig> b. napus homologous chromosome pairs, exhibiting normal flower morphology and male fertility, more distinct tags were detected in the fer library than in the ste library. in addition, for distinct tags, tags with five folds or greater differences in accumulation accounted for  <dig> %, however, among which  <dig> % tags increased by at least five folds in fer. this suggested that more genes were involved in gene expression and gene regulation in fer. through annotation of distinct tags, there were  <dig> specially expressed unknown tags in fer, which were neither mapped to b. rapa nor mapped to b. oleracea . we presumed that these tags arose basically from the added alien chromosome of s. arvensis. further study of these tags would help to dig genes with desirable agronomic traits from wild species. to identify corresponding genes that were associated with the development of stamens  and to elucidate the molecular basis of cytoplasmic male sterility, fertility restoration and improved resistance, we analyzed the most differentially regulated tags with a log <dig> ratio >  <dig> or < −  <dig> using a greater statistically significant value  as well as false discovery rates . and based on the rigorous algorithm, there were  <dig> genes of b. rapa  and  <dig> genes of b. oleracea  which were detected with significant differential expression levels. these degs were candidates for further research.

degs specific to sterile and fertile plants
because fertile plants had normal flower morphology and male fertility versus sterile plants, it was proposed that degs specific to fertile plants were associated with stamen development and male fertility, whereas degs specific to sterile plants may be involved in cms. using b. rapa as reference, a total of  <dig> degs were only expressed in fertile plants, and  <dig> degs were specific to sterile plants. the specific degs could be categorized into  <dig> categories through go functional analysis, which were involved in biochemistry, metabolism, growth, development, apoptosis and so on . for fertile specific degs,  <dig> degs were involved in pollen wall assembly , including four chalcone synthase genes , three beta- <dig> -glucanase genes , two male sterility  <dig>  members  and two gycosyl hydrolases family proteins . chalcone synthase was the key enzyme in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway, which played an important role in many biological functions in plants, including male fertility  <cit> . beta- <dig> -glucanase genes were involved in male gametophyte development and pollination. silencing the expression of beta- <dig> -glucanase gene by rna interference in transgenic rice resulted in male sterility due to disruption of degradation of callose in the anther locules at the early microspore stage  <cit> . for sterile specific degs, 40% of the degs were assigned to binding, followed by catalytic activity , transporter activity , antioxidant activity and molecular transducer activity  with respect to molecule function category.

degs involved in carbon metabolism and energy metabolism
mitochondrial gene/genome rearrangements may alter the expression of common mitochondrial genes coding for proteins involved in respiration/atp synthesis, affecting atp production and/or other processes within mitochondria. a lowered atp production  <cit>  or a reduced carbohydrate accumulation  <cit>  was observed in ‘late stage’ cms flowers. in this study,  <dig> of  <dig> degs involved in tca cycle were down-regulated in ste . degs were also involved in respiration/atp synthesis and oxidoreductase activity. a total of  <dig> genes were involved in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, having effects on nadh dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase/fumarate redutase and atp synthase . oxidoreductase activity was the most enriched go term , whereas oxidative stress during microsporogenesis was thought to induce a premature abortion of tapetal cells due to programmed cell death  in cms sunflower  <cit>  and rice  <cit> . in addition, altered expressions of numerous genes involved in pentose phosphate pathway, starch and sucrose metabolism, fructose and mannose metabolism and carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms were also observed . the nature of the mitochondrial genes that influence the expression of nuclear genes were unclear. and thus further investigations on these candidate genes help to illuminate the primary targets and downstream components of cms-associated mitochondrial signaling pathways in nsa cms line.

differentially expressed ppr proteins
nuclear genomes have crucial roles in mitochondrial biogenesis and function  <cit> . an estimated 10% of eukaryotic nuclear genes encode proteins that are targeted to mitochondria following synthesis on cytosolic ribosomes  <cit> . it has been proposed that the majority of ppr proteins are targeted to plastid or mitochondria  <cit> , and many genetic and biochemical studies conclude that pprs directly bind to a specific rna sequence and promote anterograde regulation such as post-transcriptional splicing, processing, editing or regulating mrna stability  <cit> . from about  <dig> ppr proteins in arabidopsis, more than 60% are predicted to be targeted to mitochondria  <cit> . ppr motifs have been suggested to possess binding properties to proteins  <cit>  as well as to rna  <cit> . in humans, a ppr related protein with rna-binding activity is associated with both nuclear and mitochondrial mrnas and discussed as a potential candidate for a factor that may link nuclear and mitochondrial gene expression  <cit> . mutant versions of this protein were shown to be associated with cytochrome c oxidase deficiency in humans  <cit> . hence, ppr proteins are good candidates for nuclear-encoded factors controlling distinct steps of transcript maturation in mitochondria. many of them may turn out to be essential players in cms systems. in addition, ppr proteins have been identified as targets of different mirnas  <cit> . in this study, when the genome and transcriptome of b. rapa were used as reference sequences, there were nine ppr proteins showed differential expression, including two up-regulated ppr proteins and seven down-regulated ppr proteins in fer. these ppr proteins were good candidates for studying the link between nuclear and mitochondrial gene expression.

other degs
in addition to the genes described above, several other transcript profiles were altered between ste and fer. transcriptional factors play important roles in plant growth and development as well as in hormone and stress responses. a single transcription factor can regulate expression of multiple genes. therefore, alteration in the expression of transcription factor genes normally results in dramatic changes to a plant  <cit> . as a practical consequence, engineering of transcription factor genes provides a valuable means for manipulation of plants  <cit> . our dge results showed that among the significantly degs, there were forty-five transcription factors for b. rapa, these transcription factors might therefore be potent tools to engineer enhanced stress tolerance in oil crops  <cit> .

two male sterility  <dig>  members  were found in fer, using b. rapa as referece . ms <dig> gene determines a nuclear male sterile mutant  phenotype in arabidopsis and was isolated and characterized using the en/spm-i/dspm transposon-tagging system  <cit> . the possible function of the ms <dig> protein was proposed as a fatty acyl reductase in the formation of pollen wall substances  <cit> . the homologue of ms <dig> in b. napus, bnapms <dig>  was isolated by cold plague screening from b. napus anther specific cdna library  <cit> . li et al.  <cit>  isolated a fragment homologous to bnapms <dig> gene from digenic recessive gms line s45ab of b. napus using rt-pcr technique, and found that there existed an amino acid divergence between fertile s45b and sterile s45a, which may be the putative male sterility site in s45a. male sterility gene homolog, designated bcms <dig>  expressed only in stage iii flower buds of male fertile chinese cabbage-pak-choi “zubajh97-01b” and there were no detection in all organs of polima cytoplasmic male sterility  line ‘bpol97-05a’ and ogura cms line ‘bogu97-06a’  <cit> . in this study, ms <dig> members  were only expressed in fer, whose tpm was  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, and then it was suggested that the two genes were involved in the development of fer pollens.

three up-regulated aldehyde dehydrogenase members  were found in fer, using b. rapa as referece . aldehyde dehydrogenases  have been considered as general detoxifying enzymes which eliminate biogenic and xenobiotic aldehydes in an nad-dependent manner  <cit> . maize nuclear fertility restorer gene rf <dig> as “biochemical restorer,” encoding an aldehyde dehydrogenase, plays an important role in oxidizing both aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes, reducing the amount of a toxic aldehyde and rescuing the developing pollen through a metabolic effect  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study has demonstrated the usefulness of the digital gene expression  approach to identify the differentially expressed genes  between the young floral buds of sterile and fertile plants. in total, there were  <dig> genes of b. rapa and  <dig> genes of b. oleracea which were detected with significant differential expression levels. go and pathway-based analyses indicate that these degs were related to many kinds of molecular functions. in addition, there were  <dig> specially expressed unknown tags in fer, which were neither mapped to b. oleracea nor mapped to b. rapa, and these unique tags were presumed to arise basically from the added alien chromosome of s. arvensis. the results provide a strong basis for future research on cms in nsa line, fertility restoration and improved agronomic traits in nr <dig> line. further work should focus on characterizing these candidate target genes.
