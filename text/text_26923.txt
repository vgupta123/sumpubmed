BACKGROUND
banana  is grown in tropical and sub-tropical areas and is the fourth most important crop in developing countries behind rice, wheat, and corn  <cit> . in many countries in africa and asia, it is a major staple food crop. there are two types of banana crops: sweet “desert” banana and starchier “cooking” banana which is also called plantains. more than  <dig> million tons of banana and plantain were produced worldwide in  <dig> according to the fao estimates .

bananas are tall monocotyledonous plants. a large majority of cultivated sweet bananas and cooking bananas are seedless triploid varieties  that were derived from intra- or inter-specific crosses between two diploid wild species, m. acuminata  and m. balbisiana  . the most common varieties of sweet bananas are the triploid type with the aaa genome derived from crosses within m. acuminata, while the most common cooking bananas  were the triploid originated from crosses between m. acuminata and m. balbisiana. wild diploid banana produces seeds, whereas cultivated triploid banana is sterile but develops parthenocarpic fruits.

before 1960s, the cultivar ‘gros michel’ was the principal sweet banana variety. however, a world-wide outbreak of banana wilt disease, which is also termed panama disease caused by race  <dig> of the fungal pathogen fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense , led to world-wide destruction of bananas in 1940s-1960s. the ‘cavendish’ sub-group was later found to be more resistant to foc race  <dig> and replaced gros michel as the most widely distributed banana cultivars today. cavendish is believed to be originated in southern china  <cit> . however virulent strains of race  <dig>  particularly tropical race  <dig> , to which cavendish is susceptible, have rapidly been spreading to banana production areas and has caused substantial losses in many countries in asia and australia  <cit> . as cultivated banana is generally asexually propagated using suckers from rhizomes, the large scale cultivation of the single genotype is particularly vulnerable to pathogens. the lack of banana diversity and varieties that are resistant to foc tr <dig> and the difficulty in the banana breeding process have raised a serious concern that banana is again facing the threat of disappearing from the shops  <cit>  .

the draft sequence of the 523-megabase genome of a doubled-haploid musa acuminata genotype has recently become publically available  <cit> . the genome of cultivated banana are expected to be more complex due to its polyploidy and heterozygosity. here we report analysis of the transcriptome from mixed tissues and organs of cavendish plants obtained using the illumina sequencing technology. the analysis led to identification of additional genes which were not predicted from the genome sequencing project. the differences in pathogenesis process of the different foc races and host responses to their infection remains little known. we carried out digital gene expression profiling to compare global gene expression patterns in the roots of cavendish plants infected with foc <dig> and foc tr <dig>  our study generated useful resources for the banana research community for understanding foc-banana interactions.

RESULTS
analysis of the banana transcriptome and identification of genes that were not previously annotated in the m. acuminata genome
the rna samples were isolated from various tissues of the cavendish cultivar including leaves, pseudostems, roots, flowers, and developing fruits and were pooled and subjected to whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing  using the illumina’s hiseq  <dig> system. we sequenced two rounds  of banana mrna sequences and obtained a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads and  <dig> , <dig>  nucleotides.

in total,  <dig> different transcripts were identified through analysis of the sequence reads  using tophat  <cit>  and cufflinks  <cit> , of which <dig> transcripts map to the genes that were already annotated by musa genome project  <cit> . the remaining  <dig> transcripts found by cufflinks analysis were further analysed. these potential novel transcripts were used as the queries in searching against the ncbi nr  database by blastx. in addition, the transcripts were also aligned to uniprot plant protein sequences   <cit>  by blastx. the potential transcripts that are derived from more than one exon  or from a single exon but having a blast hit to known protein at the cutoff e-value 1e- <dig> were considered to be more likely transcribed from genuine genes and are reported as novel banana transcripts in this study. using this analysis, a total of  <dig> novel loci  were identified and listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  additional file 1: table s <dig> contains the sequences of the  <dig> transcripts, the predicted open reading frames  and their translated peptide sequences, the locations of these novel genes in the musa genome, and their relative transcript abundances  which were based on the numbers of their hits by rna-seq and calculated by cufflinks. these novel transcripts are designated by a number proceeded with ‘cuff’ in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

among the novel transcripts identified from the analysis, many share a high sequence similarity to proteins encoded by other plant and/or non-plant genomes. therefore, they are not truly novel genes but were not predicted or annotated through the musa genome project. for instance, cuff. <dig> encodes an acidic endochitinase which has the highest fpkm  among the ‘novel’ transcripts. there are other four genes that have been annotated as putative acidic endochitinase genes in the musa genome project. the ‘novel’ endochitinase gene identified in this study encodes a 282-aa peptide, which shares a 77% sequence identity with another annotated acidic endochitinase  in a 177-aa region. therefore, this ‘novel’ gene was apparently missed in the genome annotation process or due to incomplete genome assembly.

aside from the ‘novel’ transcripts that show sequence similarity to other plant and/or non-plant genes, the remaining novel transcripts encode deduced peptides that share no sequence similarity to any other proteins at the e-value cutoff 1e- <dig>  they are likely from banana-specific genes. additional file 2: table s <dig> lists  <dig> transcripts which are derived from these putative banana-specific genes. the list only includes the ones that have a minimal length of  <dig> nt and a minimal abundance of  <dig>  fpkm by rna-seq. additional file 3: figure s1a plots the distribution of length of these putative banana-specific transcripts and their encoded peptides. among them,  <dig> transcripts contain a predicted orf that encodes a peptide of at least  <dig> amino acids, but the predicted peptides encoded by the majority of these putative banana-specific transcripts are shorter, suggesting that many of them might be non-coding rnas. most of the  <dig> banana-specific transcripts were expressed with less than  <dig> fpkm, but  <dig> of them have a fpkm higher than  <dig> .

it needs to be noted that in addition to the novel transcripts listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  some of the other rna-seq sequences that map to un-annotated genes could also be transcribed from genuine genes. all these assembled rna-seq sequences are publically accessible through genbank .

identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms  and short insertions/deletions 
the genome of cultivated cavendish-type banana is believed to be highly heterozygous as it was derived from an intra-species cross of musa acuminata, a cross-pollinating species. the musa genome sequence was obtained through sequencing the doubled-haploid m. acuminata genotype  <cit> . therefore, allelic polymorphisms that exist in the cultivated triploid banana cultivars could not be revealed by the sequenced genome data alone. identification of snps and indels will reveal allelic polymorphisms, useful information for breeding programs and for studying their origins. the transcriptome sequences from the cavendish cultivar are a good source to identify such polymorphisms in genes.

using samtools, a total of  <dig>  snps and  <dig>  indels were identified from our transcriptome data . we only listed the snps/indels that were identified by at least two sequence reads. if it was hit only by a single read, it is more likely from a sequencing error and therefore not regarded as a real snp/indel in this report. besides, we only examined snps/indels in the transcripts that map to the annotated banana genes or the  <dig> novel transcripts described earlier that have not been annotated in the genome.

the cultivated banana is a triploid; however, we did not find a polymorphic site that differs in all three different alleles. commonly, for each polymorphic site, two alleles show the same sequence whereas the third allele shows an allelic variation. this result further indicates that one parent/ancestor of the triploid cultivated banana contributed two sets of chromosome whereas the other one contributed one set of chromosome. allelic variations that lead to gene products with altered functions could be an advantage for plant fitness under certain environments.

gfp as a marker for monitoring the infection process by fusarium oxysporum f. sp cubense 
race  <dig> of foc  was responsible for the widespread epidemics of panama disease before 1960s. since then, cavendish cultivars have been the most widely used cultivars for banana production because of its resistance to race  <dig>  tropical race  <dig>  is highly virulent on cavendish and has been causing the outbreaks in many regions in world in recent decades. foc is a soil-borne pathogen that invades xylem tissues of roots and spread through the vascular system of pseudostems, particularly through xylem vessels. however, the infection process is difficult to monitor and the first sign of disease symptoms  appear several weeks after infection. little is known about the difference in the early infection processes between race  <dig> and race  <dig> 

to provide assistance in monitoring the pathogen infection process, we transformed both foc <dig> and foc tr <dig> with the gene encoding a modified green fluorescence protein   <cit> . we selected the gfp strains of foc <dig> and foc tr <dig> which showed similar fluorescence intensity. the gfp-expressing strains were found to have similar morphological features and pathogenecity on banana plants to their wild strains. to monitor the infection processes, roots of banana plants were cut and inoculated with spores of gfp-expressing foc <dig> and foc tr <dig>  and the fluorescence signal was observed under a confocal microscope. as shown in figure  <dig>  27 hours  post-inoculation, spores and hyphae were attached to the banana roots inoculated with foc <dig>  or foc tr <dig> . at 51 hrs post-inoculation, hyphae spread into vascular tissues of the roots infected with foc <dig>  or foc tr <dig> . our observation indicates that both foc <dig> and foc tr <dig> are capable of spreading into vascular tissues in roots at least during the first couple days of the infection process. although it appeared that more hyphae were in the vascular tissues of the foc tr4-infected roots than in the foc1-infected roots, we could not find obvious difference in the early infection process by foc <dig> and foc tr <dig>  however, it is difficult to make a precise quantitation of relative amount of hyphae using such a gfp reporter assay.figure  <dig> 
examination of the early infection process using gfp-expressing foc <dig> and foc tr <dig>  at 27 hrs post-inoculation, spores and hyphae of the gfp-expressing foc  <dig>  and foc tr <dig>  were attached to the roots. at 51 hrs post-inoculation, hyphae were observed in the vascular tissues 3-5 mm from the cut sites of the banana roots infected with foc <dig>  and foc tr <dig> .



although cavendish cultivars are generally resistant to foc <dig> strains, the mechanism of the resistance remain elusive. the sterile triploidy nature of these cultivars hampers determination of the genetic basis of the resistance trait. it is plausible that the cavendish’s resistance to race  <dig> is a polygenic quantitative trait as it is affected by various environmental factors. it has been reported that foc <dig> can cause some degree of infection on cavendish bananas under certain conditions although the severity of wilt disease is dependent on temperature, soil drainage conditions, soil ph, and inoculum levels . similarly, resistance to subtropical race  <dig> is also dependent on environmental conditions. for instance, vcg <dig> of subtropical race  <dig> can severely infect cavendish bananas in the subtropical regions but not in the tropics  <cit> . we found a similar infection process by foc1-gfp and foc tr4-gfp in the first two days following the inoculation although the foc1-gfp, like other foc <dig> strains, did not eventually lead to obvious wilt disease in our laboratory or field conditions. the results suggest that the difference of cavendish cultivars in resistance to foc <dig> and foc tr <dig> is largely due to a difference in later infection stages which could either be due to foc tr4′s ability to overcome the host defense mechanism or the host’s ability in activating more effective defense mechanisms in response to foc <dig> infection.

inoculation of banana plants by foc <dig> and foc tr <dig> for gene expression profiling analysis
to identify genes whose expression is altered in response to infection by foc and to reveal any difference in global gene expression profiles following infection with foc <dig> and foc tr <dig>  we cut root tips of banana seedlings and inoculated the wounded roots by immersing the roots to the foc spore culture. the inoculated roots were harvested at 3 hrs, 27 hrs, and 51 hrs after the initial inoculation for rna extraction. the plants whose roots were immersed in the culture medium without the pathogen  were used as a control. the gene expression profiles at the 3 hrs time point is considered to reflect an early host response triggered mainly by pathogen-associated molecular patterns. the profiles at 27 hrs and 51 hrs time points can be regarded as an early-intermediate response to infection by the foc strains. the three time points were designed in such a way that all tissue samples were collected at the same time in each of these three days to minimize differences in circadian-influenced gene expression when comparing their transcriptome profiles. the control samples were also collected at the same time points following mock-inoculation. rna extracted from the roots was subjected to digital gene expression  analysis.

identification of dge tags representing expressed genes
the sequence tags  derived from the dge sequencing libraries were mapped to the virtual tags in silico extracted from the annotated genes of the musa genome and the novel transcripts from our rna-seq results as well as to the full musa genome sequence. the genuine sequence tags should be mapped to the virtual tags at the forward direction. however, some tags were mapped to the virtual tags at reverse direction or to the antisense strands. others mapped to un-annotated genome regions or to positions beyond the nlaiii sites. those tags that are not mapped to the virtual tags could be from unidentified genes or are anti-sense transcripts; however, they could also come from genomic dna contamination or from sequencing errors or sequence assembly errors. in this report, further gene expression profiling analysis was focused on the sequence tags that are mapped to the virtual tags of the corresponding sequences in the annotated genome or to the transcripts identified based on our rna-seq results. the counts of all the tags mapped to the same gene were added up and normalized by the total mapped reads in the library as tpm .

additional file 5: table s <dig> lists all distinct transcripts identified by the dge tags and their expression levels. some of them were also detected as antisense transcripts. among those transcripts,  <dig> transcripts  are from regions that were not annotated as genes in the genome project but were found from our rna-seq transcriptome data . a total of  <dig> banana transcripts were identified with greater than  <dig> tpm in at least one dge sample, and most of them were low-abundant with 3- <dig> tpm. the expression abundance for each transcript in all libraries was used to calculate the pearson correlation coefficients . two of the mock-inoculated control samples, 27 hrs and 51 hrs post-mock-inoculation, have high correlation . however, the overall expression profile of the 3 hrs control sample was found to be more similar to the samples of 3 hrs post-inoculation with foc <dig> or foc tr <dig> than to the other two mock-inoculated control samples, presumably because these three 3 hrs-time point samples have similar expression patterns of many wounding-responsive genes . besides, all  <dig> samples collected at 27 hrs and 51 hrs post-inoculation by foc <dig> or foc tr <dig> showed a high overall similarity .figure  <dig>

identification of foc-responsive genes
we compared the transcript levels between pathogen-inoculated and corresponding mock-inoculated roots and between the roots inoculated with the different foc races at  <dig>   <dig> and 51 hrs post-inoculation. additional file 6: table s <dig> lists differentially expressed genes with a fold change of  <dig>  or higher in at least one of the nine comparisons. the numbers of the genes showing statistically significant changes were plotted in the venn diagrams . figure 3a-3b show comparison of the foc-responsive genes at the different time points following inoculation with the same foc race, whereas figure 3c shows comparison of transcript levels caused by infection with the two different races at each of the three time points.figure  <dig>

overall, a small number of genes were found up- or down-regulated at 3 hrs post-inoculation . in contrast, a much larger number of genes showed altered expression levels in foc1- or foc tr4-inoculated roots at the later infection stages . for example,  <dig> and  <dig> genes showed altered expression at 27 hrs and 51 hrs after foc <dig> inoculation, respectively. similarly,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were found to be differentially expressed at 27 hrs and 51 hrs after foc tr <dig> inoculation, respectively. among the foc1-responsive genes,  <dig> genes were found to have altered expression in all three time points, whereas among the foc tr4-responsive genes,  <dig> of them showed alteration in all three time points. overall, we found very similar global gene expression patterns influenced by both foc <dig> and foc tr <dig>  a large number of genes were up- or down-regulated at both 27 hrs and 51 hrs post-infection by foc <dig> or foc tr <dig>  however, the number of the genes up- or down-regulated by both foc <dig> and foc tr <dig> at all three time points  was much smaller due to the small number of foc-responsive genes at 3 hrs post-infection. four genes were up-regulated and five genes were down-regulated at all three time points by both strains . table  <dig> lists the genes that showed at least  <dig> fold difference in their transcript levels between the foc1- and foc tr4-inoculated roots at one or more time point.table  <dig>

several genes whose expression was found altered by foc infection were chosen for real-time quantitative pcr  analysis to compare their transcript levels between foc-inoculated and mock-inoculated roots that were prepared independently from the dge samples. those genes are marked with a star symbol in table  <dig> which lists a selected set of the foc-responsive genes. since the expression of these genes was largely similarly affected by foc <dig> and foc tr <dig>  only foc1-inoculated roots were collected for the qpcr analysis. among the analyzed genes, the ones that showed a similar expression pattern revealed in the qpcr analysis and the dge results include two acc oxidase genes , a sib1-like gene , a thaumatin-/pr5-like genes , an wrky75-like gene , an acidic endochitinase gene , and a gene encoding a homolog of the ein3-binding f-box protein  <dig> . based on the dge result, the transcript encoding a homolog of the arabidopsis wrky <dig>  was found to be reduced by more than  <dig> folds at 3 hrs and 51 hrs post-infection with foc <dig> compared with the mock-inoculated samples. this gene was found to show approximately  <dig> fold reduction at 27 hrs post-infection with foc <dig> from the qpcr result; however, its transcript level was found to be reduced by approximately  <dig> folds  at 51 hrs but was unchanged at 3 hrs post-infection based on the qpcr result . other two genes examined by qpcr did not show a similar expression pattern to that from the dge results, which include a gene encoding a putative transcription factor  and the gene encoding a homolog of the arabidopsis ethylene responsive transcription factor  <dig>  the inconsistence between the dge and qpcr results for some of these genes could be due to false positives/negatives resulted from either of these two methods or experimental variation caused by different batches of plants and pathogens or other unidentified factors.table  <dig>

functional categorization of a selected set of foc-responsive genes
table  <dig> contains the information of a list of selected genes whose transcript levels were altered by foc infection based on the dge results. some of them are well-known defense-related genes. two pr5-like  genes were found to be up-regulated by both strains at all three time points with the highest expression level at 1-2 days post-inoculation. another thaumatin-like gene was induced only at the later  time points by both strains. a pr4-like  gene was also strongly induced  by both strains at the later time points. another foc-induced gene encodes a protein similar to bon1-associated proteins  in arabidopsis. bap <dig> and bap <dig> are homologous proteins containing a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding c <dig> domain and both function in the defense pathway  <cit> . a gene encoding a sigma factor binding protein  was also highly induced by both foc strains at 1-2 days post-infection but not at the 3 hrs time point. sib <dig> and sib <dig> in arabidopsis are positive regulators in defence against both biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens and bind to and activate wrky <dig>  <cit> . two wrky genes are among the foc-responsive genes. many wrky genes act as positive or negative regulators in various biotic and abiotic stress responses. a wrky6-like gene was found induced by foc at 1-2 days post-infection whereas the transcript level of a wrky40-like gene was reduced following infection by foc <dig> or foc tr <dig>  wrky <dig> is a key negative regulator of the defense pathway, including the pamp-mediated innate immunity  <cit> . if the banana wrky40-like gene has a similar function to that of the arabidopsis wrky <dig>  its suppression by foc is expected to enhance activation of the defense pathway.

the gene encoding bak <dig>  was highly induced in both foc <dig> and foc tr4-inoculated roots at 1-2 days post-inoculation. bak <dig> is a receptor kinase and functions in both the brassinosteroid signalling pathway and the immune response  <cit> . brassinoteroids have been implicated in plant defence in dicot and monocot plants  <cit> . in arabidopsis, bri <dig> recruits and phosphorylates bak <dig> to initiate the br signalling pathway  <cit> . similarly, upon binding of bacterial flagillin to the receptor fls <dig>  fls <dig> recruits bak <dig> as a co-receptor to initiate the innate immune response  <cit> . brs enhance the immune response when the bak <dig> level is not rate limiting by supplying activated bak <dig> for the defense pathway  <cit> . the increasing bak <dig> level in the foc-treated banana roots might potentiate the innate immune response. however, it remains to be determined whether bak <dig> is also employed in defense against fungal pathogens.

a gene encoding phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and another one encoding lignin-forming anionic peroxidase were similarly induced  by both foc <dig> and foc tr <dig> at 1-2 days post-infection. pals are involved in biosynthesis of phenolpropanoids, monolignols, and phytoalexins. monolignols can be polymerized by peroxidises to form lignins, which could fortify the cell walls. a gene encoding a lignin-forming anionic peroxidase is strongly induced by both foc  <dig> and foc tr <dig> at 27 hrs and 51 hrs post-infection.

two genes encoding germin-like protein are among the strongly foc-induced genes, particularly at 1-2 days post-inoculation. one of these two germin genes was also induced  at 3 hrs post-infection by foc <dig> but not by foc tr <dig>  some germin family proteins are oxalate oxidases which are involved in production of reactive oxygen species and are known to function in biotic and abiotic stress responses  <cit> .

interestingly, several genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis and regulation of ethylene-responsive genes were induced by the infection, particularly at 1-2 days post-inoculation. three genes encoding 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase  are among the foc-responsive genes. acc oxidase catalyzes the last step of ethylene biosynthesis by converting acc to ethylene  <cit> . these three acc oxidase genes were slightly induced  at 3 hrs post-inoculation with foc <dig>  besides,  <dig> genes encoding ethylene-responsive transcription factors  were also strongly induced 1-2 days post-infection with both strains although the result for one of them  could not be confirmed by qpcr.

pathogen infection, particularly by necrotrophic pathogens, often triggers accumulation of jasmonate  which acts as a key signaling molecule in regulation of the plant defense pathways  <cit> . ja also has an antagonistic effect on the sa-mediated signaling pathway which is activated by biotrophic pathogens. the first committed step of jasmonate synthesis from free fatty acids is catalyzed by allene oxide synthase  <cit> . we found that a gene encoding allene oxide synthase 2-like protein was suppressed in the foc-treated roots, particularly at 1-2 days post-inoculation by both foc strains. at 3 hrs post-infection, only the foc tr4-inoculated roots, but not the foc1-inoculated roots, showed suppression of the allene oxide synthase gene. the result suggests that foc infection might lead to reduction of ja although it remains to be determined whether this allene oxide synthase gene is indeed responsible for ja production in banana in response to foc infection.

dge-based gene expression profiling studies in banana roots infected with foc tr <dig> has previously been reported  <cit> . our results on expression patterns of some foc-responsive genes are consistent with the previous reports but are different for some other genes  <cit> . for instance, several genes involved in phenolproponoid biosynthesis were previously found to be induced by foc tr <dig>  <cit> . bak <dig> was also found to be induced by foc tr <dig> infection in banana by another report  <cit> . however, some jasmonate biosynthetic genes  <cit>  and a ja signaling gene  <cit>  were found to be induced by foc tr <dig>  we did not find significant induction of jasmonate biosynthetic-related genes but instead found suppression of the allene oxide synthase gene. similarly, wang et al  <cit>  did not find induction of any ethylene biosynthetic or signaling pathway genes whereas li et al  <cit>  showed induction of ein <dig> by foc tr <dig>  some of the differences could be due to the different experimental designs used for comparing gene expression levels. for instance, in the study by wang et al  <cit> , gene expression levels in the roots harvested at different time points following the infection were compared with the roots harvested before the infection. however, in our study, transcriptomes in the infected roots were compared with the mock-inoculated roots harvested at the same time points. surprisingly, neither the previous reports nor this study found obvious induction of sa-responsive genes. the level of a pr1-like gene, one of well-known sa-responsive genes in many plant species, did not show change in its transcript level in our study either. similarly, few ja-responsive genes were found to be induced by foc infection. these studies suggest that the sa and ja signaling pathways might not be significantly activated during the early infection processes by either foc <dig> or foc tr <dig> 

f. oxysporum infects a wide range of plant species including many economically important crops such as tomato, cotton, cabbages, legumes, and cucurbits. plants evolved various mechanisms to defend against f. oxysporum <cit> . the best studied examples are the interactions between tomato and f. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici . conventional breeding has been very successful in controlling tomato fusarium wilt largely through introgression of gene-for-gene mediated resistance  <cit> . three resistance  genes  from wild tomato have been introgressed into cultivated tomato. like a large majority of r genes, these three i genes encode the nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat  class proteins that recognize corresponding effector proteins secreted by specific fol races to activate the defense response  <cit> . however, the i-mediated resistance apparently varies from the classical r-effector-mediated hypersensitive response that often leads to programmed death of infected cells. instead, the i-activated response mainly involves callose deposition, phenolics accumulation, and formation of gels in the infected vessels which likely lead to vessel occlusion to prevent pathogen spreading  <cit> . the foc infection-triggered induction of the banana genes involved in synthesis of phenolpropanoids  and cell wall strengthening  could also provide such a defense mechanism.

the effector proteins that are secreted from fol and recognized by these i proteins are among so-called six proteins   <cit> . some of the sixs have been found to suppress the host’s basal defense and/or gene-for-gene resistance . the genome sequence of a foc tr <dig> strain is now publicly available  and the genomes of another foc tr <dig> strain and a foc <dig> strain will likely be available soon . comparison of the genomes of these two foc races could lead to identification of six-like candidates which might contribute to the difference in their virulence to banana, and their functions in foc’s pathogenecity can then be experimentally tested.

the sterile nature of triploid banana cultivars is a hurdle in determining genetic basis of their resistance/susceptibility to foc. m. accuminata ssp. malaccensis, which is a wild diploid subspecies of the cultivated banana ancestor m. accuminata, has been found to be highly resistant to foc <dig> and the resistance is controlled by a single dominant gene  <cit> , which could be an i-like gene. isolation of such a foc resistance gene will be greatly helpful in using genetic transformation to improve banana cultivars’ resistance to foc <dig> 

r gene-mediated race-specific monogenic resistance is often evolutionally unstable because of evolving of new virulent pathogen races. in arabidopsis, resistance to f. oxysporum f.sp. matthioli  is a polygenic trait controlled by at least  <dig> quantitative trait loci  termed resistance to f. oxysporum loci   <cit> . three rfo genes  have been cloned and they belong to the receptor-like kinase  family . rfo <dig> is a member of the wall-associated kinase  subfamily. at least three wak-like genes were induced by the foc infection . among them, wak <dig> and wak <dig> were induced by both foc <dig> and foc tr <dig> at the 27 hrs and 51 hrs post-infection whereas wak <dig> was induced only at 51 hrs post-infection by foc <dig> 

ethylene is an important modulator in plant disease resistance; however, it differentially affects resistance against different types of pathogens  <cit> . generally, the ethylene signaling pathway plays a positive role in resistance to necrotrophic pathogens such as f. oxysporum  <cit> . overexpression of erf <dig> in arabidopsis, a transcription factor that activates ethylene-responsive genes, enhances resistance to f. oxysporum f. sp. conglutinans and f. sp. lycopersici  <cit> . mutations that lead to ethylene insensitivity  make tobacco and arabidopsis more susceptible to several formae speciales of f. oxysporum  <cit> . those studies demonstrate that the ethylene signaling pathway is important for resistance to fusarium wilt in those plants. in our study, several erf-like genes were found to be strongly induced in 1-2 days following infection by both foc <dig> and foc <dig> tr <dig> , which could enhance the ethylene response pathway.

because of the difficulty in using conventional breeding for banana improvement, molecular biotechnology offers great hope for improving banana for enhanced disease resistance and for other agronomically important traits by overcoming the constrains imposed by the sterility of cultivated banana. a gene conferring a dominant resistance trait, such as a banana i-like r gene that can activate banana resistance against foc tr <dig> or other genes that confer a broad spectrum resistance will be particularly useful in genetic engineering of banana for enhanced resistance. the availability of the genome sequences of banana and different foc races, as well as the transcriptomes and global gene expression profiles, are very useful in future studies toward understanding the molecular mechanism mediating resistance to fusarium wilt disease.

CONCLUSIONS
through the analysis of the transcriptome data obtained through rna-seq, we identified at least  <dig> putative banana genes that have not previously been annotated. the analysis also led to the identification of a large number of snps and indels in the banana genes.

no obvious difference was found in the early infection process  between foc1- and foc tr4-infected roots, and both races were found to invade vascular tissues of banana roots. the global gene expression patterns influenced by infection of foc <dig> and foc tr <dig> were also highly similar. the results indicate that the difference in the cavendish cultivar’s susceptibility to these two races might be due to host’s responses during later infection processes.

foc infection induced expression of many genes commonly responsive to infection by other pathogenic microorganisms, including pr genes , the genes involved in synthesis of phytoalexins and phenolpropanoids  and cell wall strengthening .

several genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis and signaling pathways are among the strongly induced genes by foc infection, suggesting involvement of this hormone in the banana response to the infection.
