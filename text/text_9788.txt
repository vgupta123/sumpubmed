BACKGROUND
germ-line cells of male and female undergo a complicated process of maturation before they become fertilization-competent spermatozoa or oocytes, respectively. at the earliest stages of their development, germ-line stem cells become enveloped by somatic cells; the two cell types interact extensively throughout gamete maturation. in insects, cells surrounding developing oocyte are called the follicle cells, while cells enveloping clones of differentiating spermatozoa are called the cyst cells.

follicle cells have multiple functions; they protect and nourish the growing oocyte, control chorion formation, and are involved in the spatial patterning of the egg  <cit> . follicle cells also play important roles in vitellogenesis. they produce yolk proteins  precursors, which accumulate in yolk spheres of maturing oocytes. in addition, follicle cells control the uptake by the oocyte of yolk proteins  produced by the fat body  <cit> .

compared to follicle cells, the functions of their somatic equivalents in insect testes, the cyst cells, are poorly understood. the cyst cells surround each spermatogonial founder cell and continue to envelope differentiating spermatocytes and elongating spermatids  <cit> . in higher insects, developing spermatozoa are aligned in sperm bundles  <cit> . during the release from the testis, spermatozoa are freed from the cyst cells; the latter appear to undergo fragmentation and phagocytosis by the adjacent testis epithelium  <cit> .

spermatozoa released from testis undergo further maturation in order to acquire fertilizing capacity. the process of extra-testicular maturation of sperm has been studied extensively in mammals. it has been found that many glycoproteins released from the sertoli cells and from the reproductive tract epithelia participate in sperm maturation and contribute to the extracellular coat that is formed on spermatozoa  <cit> . ultrastructural studies on several moth species suggested that insect spermatozoa acquire an extracellular coat after the release from testis  <cit> ; however, the coat components have not been identified biochemically. the moth spodoptera littoralis is especially well suited to study extra-testicular sperm maturation because males of this species release several hundreds of sperm bundles per day from the testis into the upper vas deferens   <cit> . the release of sperm in this and other moths is controlled by the circadian clock and occurs within a few hours after the onset of dark phase in the  <dig> h light:  <dig> h dark photoperiod  <cit> . the release of sperm into the uvd coincides with circadian clock-controlled acidification of the seminal fluid and the secretion of glycoprotein rich granules into the uvd  <cit> . the goal of the current study was to identify glycoproteins in the uvd seminal fluid at the time of sperm release. surprisingly, peptides derived from the most prominent glycoprotein showed homology to female yolk components from several moth species. further, the antibody against yolk protein yp <dig>  which is produced in the female follicle cells  <cit>  immuno-detected a single protein in the male seminal fluid. we then cloned the fragment of yp <dig> cdna from s. littoralis and determined that it is expressed in both ovaries and testes. we present evidence that yp <dig> protein is produced in the male cyst cells and interacts with spermatozoa released into the uvd lumen.

RESULTS
seminal fluid of s. littoralis contains glycoproteins with homology to yolk proteins
sperm bundles that are released from the moth testis into the lumen of the upper vas deferens  are bathed in seminal fluid. we reported previously that – coincident with sperm release – several glycoproteins are secreted into the uvd seminal fluid of the moth s. littoralis  <cit> . to characterize seminal fluid proteins, the uvds were dissected from males  <dig> h after lights-on  and  <dig> h after lights-off . content of the uvd lumens from day and night samples were collected and sperm present in the night sample was separated from the seminal fluid by gentle centrifugation. proteins contained in the seminal fluid were resolved by 2-d gel electrophoresis and the gel was incubated with a glycoprotein detecting stain. the stain revealed a prominent group of three proteins with molecular weight of approximately  <dig> kda in the night sample that were absent in the day sample. . the three protein spots were excised from the gel and digested into peptides, which were analyzed by q-tof mass spectrometry combined with the nano-hplc system. protein spots no.  <dig> and  <dig> yielded five peptides homologous to yolk constituents from several species of lepidoptera, while spot no.  <dig> yielded no such peptides.

to verify that yolk-related material is indeed present in the seminal fluid, proteins from the uvd lumen were separated by 1-d electrophoresis, transferred to the membrane, and probed with available antibodies made against various insect yolk proteins. we tested antibodies recognizing individual yolk proteins yp <dig>  yp <dig>  yp <dig> and yp <dig> from the moth, plodia interpunctella  <cit> , and antibody recognizing the three yolk peptides  from drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . of these antibodies, only the one specifically recognizing yp <dig> of p. interpunctella  <cit>  immunoreacted with a protein of approximately  <dig> kda in seminal fluid of s. littoralis . this antibody stained protein band of similar size in both the ovary and the testis-uvd complex of p. interpunctella; additional staining was detected at approximately  <dig> kda in these organs . immunostaining in s. littoralis seminal fluid was drastically reduced when blot was probed withyp <dig> antibody preabsorbed with fixed p. interpunctella ovaries, suggesting that seminal fluid of s. littoralis indeed contains yp <dig> immunoreactive material .

yp <dig> is expressed in s. littoralis ovary and accumulates in oocytes
to determine whether yp2-like immunoreactive material corresponds to s. littoralis yp <dig> protein, we have undertaken the cdna cloning of yp <dig> homolog from this species. we designed a series of degenerate primers deduced from highly conserved regions of yp <dig> from p. interpunctella and two other moth species, galleria mellonella and bombyx mori. a 240-bp cdna product was amplified from total rna extracted from s. littoralis ovaries by rt-pcr. after cloning and sequencing, the fragment was extended to the 3' region by 3'race-pcr. this resulted in identification of  <dig> bp long cdna product. it was sequenced and submitted to the database . the deduced amino acid sequence showed high homology  to yp <dig> protein from p. interpunctella  <cit>  when aligned with the clustalw software  <cit>  . additional comparison of s. littoralis sequence with all three known yp <dig> homologs  revealed 31% identity and 64% similarity among them.

the obtained cdna sequence of s. littoralis was used to design the specific primers for amplification of a  <dig> bp cdna product. using these primers, we obtained cdna of expected size from both ovaries and testis-vas deferens complexes of s. littoralis, but not from other tissues of males and females .

in the next experiment, we asked whether yp <dig> functions as yolk protein in s. littoralis females, similar to p. interpunctella  <cit> . western blotting with yp <dig> antibody detected single protein band in the ovarian extracts but not in the fat body of s. littoralis females. the ovarian protein was of the same size as the immuno-positive protein in the seminal fluid . yp <dig> antibody was then used to stain s. littoralis ovarioles containing maturing oocytes. strong and specific yp <dig> signal was detected in vitellogenic oocytes and in the follicle cells . these data demonstrate that the yp <dig> protein, which we first identified in male seminal fluid, is a yolk constituent in s. littoralis females. since yp <dig> was not detected in the fat body , it appears to be produced only in the follicle cells surrounding vitellogenic oocytes, similar to p. interpunctella  <cit> .

distribution of yp <dig> protein and mrna in the male reproductive system
the uvd seminal fluid contains proteins from two sources: the testis and the uvd secretory epithelium. to determine the origin of yp <dig> protein in the seminal fluid, we probed homogenates of the testes and the uvd wall with yp <dig> antibody by western blot. in addition, we probed segments of the reproductive tract posterior to the uvd: seminal vesicles , sperm-storing duplex, and ejaculatory duct. we also tested hemolymph, flight muscles and fat body for the presence of yp <dig>  a single immunoreactive protein band of approximately  <dig> kda was again detected in the extracts of the uvd seminal fluid . extracts of the uvd wall contained immuno-positive band of approximately  <dig> kda. strong immunoreactivity with molecular weight between  <dig> and  <dig> kda was observed in the extract of whole testes. we did not detect substantial yp2-immunopositive material in the seminal vesicles, hemolymph, muscles or the fat body , sperm-storing duplex, or ejaculatory duct .

spatial distribution of yp2-immunopositive material in the reproductive system was determined by immunocytochemistry  with yp <dig> antibody on sections of the testis-vas deferens complexes. yp <dig> stained strongly the cytoplasm of cyst cells enclosing sperm bundles . like other lepidoptera, s. littoralis produce nucleated and anucleated sperm  <cit> . cyst cells enveloping both types of sperm bundles stained specifically with yp <dig>  while spermatozoa inside cysts appeared unstained . in addition to testicular cyst cells, sections of the uvd epithelial wall showed diffused but specific staining with yp <dig> antibody . in contrast, seminal vesicle wall was immuno-negative  in agreement with the results of western blot .

having detected yp2-like material in both the cyst cells and the uvd epithelial cells, we asked whether the yp <dig> gene is expressed in both cell types. total rna was extracted separately from cyst cell-enclosed testicular sperm bundles, uvd wall, and ovaries . rt-pcr reactions were performed using yp2-specific primers. a pcr product of the expected size  was obtained from ovary and from testicular sperm bundles but not from the uvd epithelial wall . this data suggests that yp <dig> gene is not expressed in the uvd cells. to determine the origin of yp2-immunopositive material in the uvd epithelial cells, a thin silk thread was tied between the testes and the uvd preventing the release of sperm and other material from the testes. reproductive systems from experimental and control sham-operated males were dissected  <dig> hours after treatment, fixed, sectioned, and stained with yp <dig> antibody. yp <dig> immunostaining was present in the epithelial cells of control uvds that remained connected to testis. in contrast, uvds that were isolated from the testis showed no yp <dig> signal in the epithelial cells .

yp <dig> protein coats the surface of spermatozoa
our data indicate that yp <dig> protein is produced in the cyst cells and is abundantly present in the uvd seminal fluid. to determine whether yp <dig> become associated with spermatozoa in the uvd lumen, sperm from this compartment was centrifuged and the pellet washed several times. proteins from sperm and supernatant were separated on the sds page gel, blotted, and probed with yp <dig> antibody. immunoreactive protein of  <dig> kda was detected in both seminal fluid and sperm sample . this protein was dissociated from spermatozoa by washing the sperm fraction with  <dig> m nacl. after this high-salt treatment, yp <dig> was detected in the wash, but was no longer present in the sperm fraction . these data suggest that yp <dig> associates with the surface of spermatozoa in the uvd lumen.

to confirm this and to determine spatial distribution of yp <dig> protein on spermatozoa, we incubated sperm bundles isolated from the uvd lumen with yp <dig> antibody. yp <dig> appeared to coat the entire sperm cell surface in both nucleated and anucleated bundles . yp <dig> was not detected on sperm bundles that moved to the seminal vesicles . taken together, this data suggest that yp <dig> associates with the surface of spermatozoa in a transient manner.

discussion
our search for candidate glycoproteins involved in sperm maturation unexpectedly revealed the presence of the yolk protein yp <dig> in the upper vas deferens  of male s. littoralis. this protein – along with other yolk components, which accumulate in oocyte and provision developing embryo – was believed to be female specific. previous studies in the moth, p. interpunctella have shown that yp <dig> is produced by the follicle cells and secreted into the oocyte, giving rise to early yolk spheres, which are formed prior to the uptake of other yps from the fat body  <cit> . our data suggest that yp <dig> serves as yolk constituent also in s. littoralis. at the same time, we provide two lines of evidence demonstrating that yp <dig> is also produced in male gonads. first, we cloned yp <dig> cdna fragment using s. littoralis ovaries and detected yp <dig> mrna in the sperm bundles within the testis. second, antibody specific for yp <dig> protein from another moth, p. interpunctella detected this protein in the testis of both p. interpunctella and s. littoralis . thus, we propose that the same yp <dig> protein is produced in the female and male gonads of these two moth species. further investigation focused on s. littoralis because males of this species are substantially larger and produce copious amount of sperm, which facilitated determination of the fate of yp <dig> in the male reproductive system.

we initially identified yp <dig> in the seminal fluid bathing sperm released into the uvd, and then showed that the source of yp <dig> is in the testes. abundant immunoreactive material was detected in the homogenates of the testes with the molecular weight slightly higher than in seminal fluid. this result suggests that larger precursor of yp <dig> protein may be produced in the testes and undergo proteolytic cleavage or other modifications upon release into the seminal fluid. in support of this interpretation, western blot from p. interpunctella testis-uvd complexes also showed multipleyp <dig> species of similar size as in s. littoralis. icc with yp <dig> antibody on sectioned testes of s. littoralis revealed strong immunostaining in the cyst cells, which envelope bundles of spermatozoa until their release from testis. cyst cells of both nucleated and anucleated sperm bundles were stained with yp <dig> antibody, while spermatozoa inside the bundles did not appear to be stained.

what might be the role of yp <dig> protein in the male? the cyst cells in males are developmentally homologous to the follicle cells in females in that both are somatic cells directly associated with developing germline cells. in the follicle cells, yp <dig> protein is produced as a minor yolk constituent, which is secreted and taken up by the oocyte  <cit> . we show here that in the male, this protein is released into the uvd and becomes associated with sperm. the yp <dig> behaves as peripheral sperm membrane protein since it can be removed from sperm by treatment with high salt. previous electron microscopy studies suggested that moth spermatozoa acquire an external coat in the uvd  <cit> ; however, its molecular identity has not been elucidated. data reported here suggest that yp <dig> protein may constitute a component of the sperm coat. mammalian sperm is known to be coated with many peripheral glycoproteins, which are thought to be involved in the maturation of spermatozoa  <cit> . our study identified novel sperm coat protein in insects; remarkably, it is a protein that was considered female-specific along with other yolk components.

our data suggest that the association of yp <dig> with sperm is of a transient nature. yp coating is detected on sperm present in the uvd; however, it is not detected on sperm translocated to lower parts of the reproductive tract. there are at least two possible explanations for transient yp <dig> detection on sperm. first, yp <dig> may persist on sperm but the antigenic regions could be either removed, or become inaccessible to the antibody. such modifications are known to occur in mammalian sperm surface proteins during sperm passage through the reproductive tract; they may involve transmembrane carbohydrate modifying enzymes, which are known to function in both mammalian and insect sperm  <cit> . the alternative explanation for the absence of yp <dig> signal on sperm translocated to lower parts of the reproductive tract is that yp <dig> may dissociate from spermatozoa surface and may be taken up by the epithelial cells forming the uvd wall. we detected yp2-immunoreactive material in these cells by both western and icc; however, rt-pcr showed that yp <dig> gene is not expressed in the uvd cells. when uvds were isolated from the testis by a ligature, there was no yp <dig> immunoreactivity in the epithelial cells. taken together, these data suggest that yp <dig> may be secondarily absorbed from the seminal fluid by the uvd epithelial cells. this scenario is similar to findings in mammals where some proteins secreted by the sertoli cells into the seminal fluid are reabsorbed by epithelial cells of the epidydimis  <cit> .

in addition – or instead of – yolk proteins produced in the follicular cells, such as yp <dig>  many invertebrate and vertebrate females produce yolk precursors belonging to vitellogenin family, which are synthesized in the fat body or liver  <cit> . in general, the expression of all yolk protein precursors is restricted to females; however, vitellogenins can be experimentally induced in male insect fat body or vertebrate liver by application of female sex hormones  <cit> . interestingly, vitellogenin gene appear to be expressed in the fat body of honeybee males  without any hormonal treatment  <cit> . in addition, major yolk protein of the sea urchin is present in both males and females  <cit> ; however, this protein is not related to vitellogenins of other animals. taken together, these reports suggest caution in considering yolk proteins as female specific, especially in view of our data, which provide strong evidence linking yolk protein precursor with processing of sperm. while specific roles of yp <dig> in the male remain to be elucidated, our data uncovered a remarkable and unexpected commonality in the maturation of eggs and sperm.

CONCLUSIONS
yolk protein precursors accumulate in oocytes and provision developing embryos. we show here additional male-specific role for one of the yolk protein precursor, yp <dig>  this protein is produced in testes of intact males, is released into the seminal fluid, and becomes attached to spermatozoa. these novel findings suggest that male cyst cells and female follicle cells may use the same protein to fulfill different functions in the development of gametes in each sex.
