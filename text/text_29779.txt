BACKGROUND
since the concept of solvent accessibility was first introduced by lee and richards  <cit> , defined as the surface area of a protein that is accessible to a spherical solvent while probing the surface of that molecule, it has been considered as a key factor for understanding protein structure and function  <cit> . predicting the three-dimensional  structures of proteins from their one-dimensional sequences is a challenging issue because of the increasing gap between the enormous number of protein sequences and the number of known structures. studies of solvent accessibility in proteins have provided many useful insights into the 3d structures of proteins  <cit> . furthermore, knowledge of solvent accessibility has proved useful for structural domains identification  <cit> , fold recognition  <cit> , binding region identification  and protein intrinsic disorder  <cit> . the solvent accessibility is particularly important because it is associated with the spatial arrangement and packing of amino acids during the process of protein folding. it also plays an important role in predicting the active sites of protein-protein or protein-ligand binding  <cit> .

in many earlier studies, the solvent accessibility prediction was taken as a classification problem with varying thresholds, two-state  or three-state  . however, there is no standard definition for the thresholds of solvent accessibility states. for instance, a residue may be predicted to be exposed state based on a relative solvent accessibility threshold of  <dig> %, but the same residue may be predicted to be buried state based on a threshold of  <dig> %. in view of this, it is necessary to predict the real values of solvent accessibility. some representative machine learning techniques have been proposed to predict the real values of solvent accessibility, including multiple linear regression  <cit> , support vector regression , neural network  <cit> , energy optimization  <cit>  and nearest neighbor method  <cit> .

for the real-valued solvent accessibility prediction, ahmad et al.  <cit>  proposed a neural network method with only single sequence information as the input features. the result showed that this method achieved a mae of  <dig> – <dig>  % on different data sets. adamczak et al.  <cit>  employed evolutionary information in the form of position-specific scoring matrix  profile to train a neural network-based regression for the prediction. compared with the single sequence based neural network  <cit> , the prediction performance was improved and the mae decreased by about  <dig> % on the pfam database  <cit> . subsequently, lee et al.  <cit>  applied pssm profile by constructing a correlation matrix different window positions to train a multiple linear regression method. the result showed a performance of  <dig>  % mae and  <dig>  pcc on the barton- <dig> dataset. garg et al.  <cit>  took multiple sequence alignment and secondary structure as input features to predict rsa based on a feed-forward neural network. the result indicated that a lower mae achieved on casp <dig> was  <dig>  % and a higher pcc was  <dig> .

although these methods for surface accessibility prediction were developed, several issues still exist and make surface accessibility prediction a very challenging task. mainly, there are three reasons:  specific biological properties for precisely predicting surface accessibility are not fully exploited, and no single parameter can definitely estimate the accessible surface area, various combinations of different feature types, including pssm profiles, secondary structure features, native disorder features as well as other global sequence features  <cit> , need to be investigated comprehensively;  the performance of the existing methods is still unsatisfactory, especially in terms of independent testing and  high-performance ensemble learning algorithms such as boosted regression trees haven’t been intensively used in this area.

in this article, we propose a new and efficient approach, predrsa , that integrates gradient boosted regression trees  algorithm with multiple sequence-based features  and a global feature  to predict rsa. we have benchmarked predrsa using the manesh training dataset and an independent dataset. results show that predrsa significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and indicate that the gbrt algorithm and the novel feature combination are important determinants in the prediction of rsa.

methods
the gbrt algorithm
our approach utilizes an ensemble regression algorithm for predicting rsa values of amino acid residues in a protein sequence. generally, a target residue in sequence can be described as an n-dimension vector. let us denote an amino acid residue by x= where xi∈r and the corresponding real-valued rsa by y. the goal of predicting rsa real value of the amino acid residue in sequence is to find a function f∗ that maps x to y, such that over the joint distribution of all -values, the expected value of some specified loss function Ψ) is minimized as follows: 
  f∗=arg minfey,xΨ)=arg minfex 

let yi,xi1n be a set of training data, n is the number of all amino acid residues in the training set. the gbrt algorithm iteratively constructs m different weak learners h,⋯,h which consist of regression trees of fixed size from training set and constructs the following additive function f: 
  f=β0+∑m=1mh 

where βm and Θm are a weight and vector of parameters for the mth weak regression tree h, respectively, and β <dig> is an initial value. both the weight βm and the parameters Θm are iteratively determined from m= <dig> to m=m so that a loss function Ψ) is minimized. that is, βm and Θm for the mth regression tree are determined as follows: 
  =arg minβ,Θ∑i=1nΨ+βh) 

where f <dig> is an initial value and given by f0=β0=arg minβ∑i=1nΨ, fm− <dig> is the th additive function combined from the first to the th weak regression tree.

however, in general, it is not straightforward to solve eq. . therefore, gbrt separately and approximately estimates  with a simple two-step fashion  <cit> . for the estimation of the parameters Θm, we determine them so that the function defined by the regression tree approximates a gradient with respect to the current function fm− <dig> in the sense of least-square error as follows: 
  Θm=arg minΘ∑i=1n) <dig> 

where y~im is the gradient and is given by 
  y~im=−∂Ψ)∂ff=fm− <dig> 

when the mth regression tree using the Θm has lm leaf nodes, the regression tree is given by 
  hx,rlml=1lm=∑l=1lmy¯lml 

where rlm is a disjoint region that the lth leaf node of the mth regression tree defines. l is a boolean function that outputs  <dig> in case the argument of the function is true. y¯lm is a constant for the rlmth region, defined as the mean of training data that belongs to the lth leaf node of the mth regression tree. the weight βm can be straightforwardly chosen using line search: 
  βm=arg minβ∑i=1nΨyi,fm−1xi−β∂Ψyi,fm−1xi∂fm− <dig> 

then, a new additive function fm is updated as follows: 
  fm=fm−1+ν∑l=1lmβmy¯lml 

where 0<ν< <dig> is a shrinkage parameter, also called the learning rate to scale the step length the the gradient descent procedure. in this work, we take huber loss function  <cit>  as the loss function given by 
  Ψ=122if|y−f|≤δδif|y−f|>δ 

hence, in eq. , y~im becomes: 
  y~im=yi−fm−1if|yi−fm−1|≤δδ.sign)if|yi−fm−1|>δ 

the value of the transition point δ depends on the iteration number m.

finally, the resulting rsa value y corresponding to the amino acid residue x is given by: y=fm.

sequence encoding schemes
selecting appropriate features is a crucial step because it directly determines the prediction performance. in this article, we explore various sequenced-based features which have been shown to be related to the solvent accessibility or ever applied in the similar issues. these features include pssm profiles , psipred-predicted secondary structure  <cit> , disopred-predicted native disorder  <cit> , conservation score and side-chain environment compositions  <cit> . in this section, a more detail description about how to extract and encode these different sequence-based features as follows.

psi-blast-based profiles
position-specific scoring matrix  of a residue which is achieved by the psi-blast program contains important evolutionary information that determines whether this residue is conserved in its family of related proteins. each element in the pssm represents the probability of each residue position in the multiple sequence alignment. plenty of previous studies have shown that multiple sequence alignments in the form of pssm can substantially improve overall prediction performance . in this article, the pssm profile for each protein sequence is generated with default parameters  against the non-redundant  dataset obtained from the ncbi. we encode each residue using a local sliding window approach based on the pssm profiles. the pssm profile generated by psi-blast consists of the likelihood of a particular residue substitution at a specific position. these likelihood values are normalized to  <cit>  by standard logistic function: 
  x′=11+exp−x 

where x is the score derived from the pssm profile and x′ is the standardized value of x. for a given residue, its local sequence fragment is extracted and encoded as a 20×-dimensional vector by using a sliding window scheme where l denotes the half window size and l=2l+ <dig> is the whole window length. furthermore, the predictive performance of a variety of different local window sizes l  has been evaluated to select the optimal local window size l for the rsa prediction. finally, in this encoding scheme, a residue is encoded by a 20×l=20×-dimensional vector.

in addition, we try to introduce residue conservation score for the solvent accessibility prediction. the value of sequence conservation for residue is a measure of how often a given residue is seen at an equivalent position in an equivalent protein across different species. generally, residue conservation score is proportional to its buried degree. the conservation score is obtained by psi-blast search as well  <cit> .

psipred-predicted secondary structure information
in this work, we use the psipred program to predict the secondary structure information. psipred provides highly accurate prediction for protein secondary structures by applying a feed-forward neural network. the outputs of psipred are encoded by the probability profiles of three secondary structures . some previous works have shown that incorporation of psipred-predicted secondary structure information can significantly improve the prediction performance  <cit> .

analogously, for a given residue, its three-state secondary structure profiles are extracted and encoded using a sliding window of l=2l+ <dig> consecutive residues. therefore, in this encoding scheme, a residue is composed of a 3×l=3×-dimensional vector.

disopred-predicted native disorder information
in the past decade, protein disorder or unstructured regions have received considerable attention in that they are commonly responsible for important protein function. as such, there has been an increasing interest in studying such regions in proteins. unstructured regions are found to be associated with molecular assembly, protein modification and molecular recognition . research shows unstructured regions have a large solvent accessible area, which explains why polar and charged residues which favorably interact with water are prevalent in these regions  <cit> . the conclusion is that disordered regions are strongly correlated with local solvent accessibility areas. local solvent accessibility values are often used to find the disordered regions as well  <cit> .

in order to further improve the performance, in this study, we use disopred program to output the predicted possibility of each residue being natively disordered or ordered. similarly, a residue is encoded by a 2×l=2×-dimensional vector in this encoding scheme.

side-chain environment
the concept of side-chain environment was first purposed by eisenberg et al.  <cit>  and used to identify protein sequences that fold into a known three-dimensional structure. then li et al.  <cit>  utilized it for prediction of protein-protein binding site.

the side-chain environment of a residue is typically defined as buried, partially buried, or exposed based on its solvent accessible surface area. the buried and partially buried residue environments can be further subdivided according to the fraction of side-chain area covered by polar atoms. based on this, we divide the side-chain environment of a residue into six classes . the detailed definition of the side-chain environment were described in the work of eisenberg et al.  <cit> .
fig.  <dig> the definition of the six side-chain environment categories. this figure shows the classification method of side-chain environment. rsa represents the relative accessible surface areas and f represents the fraction of the whole side-chain area covered by polar atoms. if r

a< <dig> , the residue will be placed into class b. if  <dig> ≤r

 <dig>  and if f≥ <dig> , the residue will be divided into class b
 <dig>  in class p, if f< <dig> , the reside will be divided into class p
 <dig>  and if f≥ <dig> , the reside will placed into class p

framework of predrsa
in this subsection, we describe the predrsa framework that uses an accurate and effective ensemble computational approach for real values of relative solvent accessibility prediction from protein primary sequences. we are interested in investigating the influence of various sequence-based features and their combinations on the prediction performance of solvent accessibility. in order to fully exploit the sequence-derived features for rsa prediction, we propose a novel predrsa approach which incorporates five different types of sequence-derived features as inputs. they are four local features  and a global feature . figure  <dig> illustrates the flowchart of our proposed approach.
fig.  <dig> the framework of predrsa for protein relative solvent accessibility prediction. five different types of sequence-derived features are generated and used as input to build the gbrt model. these features consist of pssm in the form of psi-blast profiles, predicted secondary structure information by psipred, predicted native disorder information by disopred, conservation score and side-chain environment



to determine the optimal local sliding window size l and the iterative tree number m, we calculate the prediction performance for l in the range of 3– <dig> with a step of  <dig> and m in the range of 100– <dig> with a step of  <dig> using a grid search method. with l= <dig> and m= <dig>  the predrsa approach achieves the best performance for the rsa prediction.

RESULTS
datasets
two non-homologous datasets of proteins chains with pair-wise sequence similarity less than  <dig> % have been used in order to objectively compare our approach with other available methods developed previously. one dataset is consisted of  <dig> proteins, which was also used earlier by manesh et al.  <cit>  for solvent-accessible surface area of residues prediction. the other dataset is consisted of  <dig> proteins, obtained from the cuff and barton  <cit>  dataset of  <dig> proteins, selected by removing those sequences, which have less than  <dig> residues. these two datasets have been referred to as manesh- <dig> and cb- <dig>  respectively. however, since the manesh- <dig> dataset was widely used by researchers to benchmark prediction methods  <cit> , taking into account comparative purposes, we use manesh- <dig> as the main data set for evaluation and analysis.

to further evaluate the performance of existing methods and the method developed in the present study, we also generate an independent dataset of casp <dig> proteins. originally, it contains  <dig> proteins  <cit> , and we have removed  <dig> structures  by using pisces culling sever  <cit>  with  <dig> % sequence similarity cutoff including x-ray  and nmr structures which contain more than  <dig> residues. finally, the remaining  <dig> proteins are used for independent test.

calculation of rsa
in this work, we take relative solvent accessibility, also called relative solvent accessible surface area  as the prediction of solvent accessibility. the rsa of a residue in a protein chain is a normalized value from 0– <dig>  it is calculated as the ratio by dividing the solvent accessible surface area  by the maximum solvent accessibility according to manesh’s work  <cit>  which uses gly-x-gly extended tripeptides. the values of asa are calculated using dssp  <cit>  for all considered protein structures.

evaluation measures
to measure the performance of real-valued rsa predictions, three widely used measures for real value rsa prediction are adopted in this study.

the first measure, mean absolute error , is defined as the average difference between the predicted and experimental rsa values of all residues: 
  mae=∑rsapredicted−rsaexperimentaln 

the second measure is the root mean square error , which is defined as follows: 
  rmse=1n∑ni=1rsapredicted−rsaexperimental <dig> 

the third measure, pearson correlation coefficient , the ratio of the covariance between the predicted and experimental rsa values which is given by: 
  pcc=∑i=1n∑i=1n2∑i=1n <dig> 

where n is the total number of residues in a protein sequence to predict; xi and yi are the experimental and predicted rsa values of the i-th residue, respectively; x¯ and y¯ are their corresponding means. pcc= <dig> indicates that the two sets of values are fully correlated, while pcc= <dig> indicates that they are completely uncorrelated.

two-state  predictions are evaluated according to various thresholds of rsa. prediction accuracy which is defined by the percentage of correctly predicted residues divided by the total number of residues and matthews correlation coefficient  are given as follows: 
  acc=nb+nen 

  mcc=tp×tn−fp×fn 

where n is the total number of residues in a chain, nb and ne represent the number of residues correctly predicted as buried and exposed, respectively. tp,tn,fp and fn are the numbers of the true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives, respectively.

effect of different sequence encoding schemes on the prediction performance
we analyze the importance or contribution for each individual feature, which is useful to identify those features that have the most significant influence on overall prediction performance. the performance of each individual predictive is shown in fig.  <dig>  the feature of side-chain environment is first introduced to predict rsa and it is strongly related to solvent-accessible surface areas.
fig.  <dig> the importance of the five relevant features used in predrsa. pssm, ss, diso, sce and cs stand for position specific scoring matrix, protein secondary structure, protein native disorder, side-chain environment and conservation score, respectively

performance comparison with other regression approaches
in this section, we compare the performance of predrsa with that of other five existing real value rsa predictors, including a quadratic programming and buriability energy function for solvent accessibility prediction   <cit> , a neural network-based method using multiple sequence alignment and secondary structure   <cit> , an improved two-layer neural network   <cit> , a support vector regression using enhanced pssm features   <cit>  and an ensemble of artificial neural networks method   <cit> . table  <dig> summarizes the results of these methods. we observe that our method achieves a significantly better performance over the compared predictors. particularly, the pcc value of predrsa is approximately  <dig> % higher than that of the previous predictors on manesh- <dig>  it is worth to point out that experimental maximum solvent accessibility scores are varied based on different references  <cit> . a higher maximum solvent accessibility score will lead to a lower rsa value, and thus a relatively lower mae is obtained according to the definition of mae. one reason for the differences of mae between predrsa and the other methods is that these methods may use different maximum solvent accessibility scores. on the other hand, the prediction precision of predrsa is higher than that of the other methods and yields a lower mae.


performance comparison for two-state prediction
in the past, a plenty of approaches have been proposed for predicting the states  of residues. here we examine the performance of our method in terms of two-state prediction. we assign the label of a residue based on its predicted rsa value and a chosen threshold. table  <dig> shows the performance of the two-state classification prediction.


we also compare the classification accuracy of predrsa with that of other approaches by different thresholds. the threshold is used to determine the state  of a predicted real value. for example, a  <dig> % threshold means a residue is defined as buried if its rsa value is less than  <dig> %. the methods for comparison include sarpred  <cit> , pace regression algorithm   <cit> , two-stage svr  <cit>  and svr  <cit> . the prediction accuracy is showed in table  <dig>  our method yields more than  <dig> % classification accuracy at any thresholds and obtains almost the highest accuracy across all the thresholds.


independent test on the casp <dig> dataset
an independent test  is constructed to further validate the usability of our predrsa method. we train the classifiers based on the manesh- <dig> dataset and test against the casp <dig> dataset which contains  <dig> proteins. other state-of-the-art methods including spine-x  <cit>  and asaquick  <cit>  are also evaluated. spine-x uses a multistep neural-network algorithm by coupling secondary structure prediction with prediction of solvent accessibility and backbone torsion angles in an iterative manner, while asaquick utlizes solely sequential widow information and global features with a general neural network method. the pearson correlation coefficient of predrsa is  <dig> , which outperform the results of spine-x and asaquick by a rate of  <dig> %  and  <dig> % .

case study
for a better understanding of the power of our proposed predrsa approach and illustrating the significance of pcc, rmse and mae measures used in this work, an example of the real-valued rsa for t <dig>  from casp <dig> is shown in fig.  <dig>  for this protein, our method gives a mae of  <dig>  %, a rmse of  <dig>  % and a pcc of  <dig> . from fig.  <dig>  we can see that the majority of its predicted rsa values are in good agreement with the corresponding experimental rsa values calculated by dssp, except for several separate positions.

in fig.  <dig>  the continuous real-value prediction of rsa and the actual continuous values are shown. significant correlation between the true values and the predicted values is obtained.
fig.  <dig> correlation between experimental rsa values and predicted rsa values of casp <dig> t <dig>  the pearson correlation coefficient score is  <dig>  and the most buried residues are well predicted with the rsa values near zero



residue-specific variation in prediction error
in order to assess the prediction performance of various types of residues, we further calculate the average rsa values on the manesh- <dig> dataset for all  <dig> amino acids  from the predrsa predictor. as can be seen from fig.  <dig>  an overwhelming majority of types of amino acids are predicted with < <dig> % mean error. all types of amino acids are predicted with < <dig> % mean error in our method. in particularly, we find that the true mean rsa values are in highly accord with the predicted mean rsa values for these amino acids, such as a , k , n , t .
fig.  <dig> comparison between true mean values and predicted mean values for  <dig> amino acids on the manesh- <dig> dataset



furthermore, we calculate the prediction errors of  <dig> amino acids on the manesh- <dig> dataset. figure  <dig> shows the mean absolute error  and the standard root mean square error  of  <dig> amino acids. as expected, g  shows the highest mae and rmse due to its flexibility, and other polar residues show similar behavior. hydrophobic amino acids including c , f , m  and w  are better predicted than less hydrophobic amino acids. these results are also in good agreement with our predrsa method.

CONCLUSIONS
knowledge of residue solvent accessibility gives useful insights into protein structure and function prediction. in this work, we have presented predrsa to predict real-valued relative solvent accessibility as well as classification state  of a target residue. the method is based on a gradient boosted regression trees  algorithm combined with a novel set of features. the 5-fold cross-validated correlation coefficient between predicted and experimental rsa  is significantly better than existing methods on the manesh- <dig> dataset. we also performed additional independent benchmark tests of predrsa on the casp <dig> set containing  <dig> proteins where we find that the proposed method outperforms existing methods. furthermore, for prediction of discrete state, our method is able to achieve an accuracy of  <dig>  % with an mcc value of  <dig>  using two states classifications at a threshold of  <dig> %, which defines an approximately balanced division into the two classes.

experimental results show gbrt is an efficient machine learning approach for continuous values of the solvent accessibility of a target residue. compared with other traditional techniques, gbrt has several obvious advantages such as high prediction accuracy and stronger generalization capability.

on the other hand, predrsa utilizes a variety of multiple sequence-derived features, including the position-specific scoring matrices and conservation score in the form of psi-blast profiles, predicted secondary structure, predicted natively disordered region and side-chain environment. we have comprehensively assessed the effects of different sequence encoding schemes on the prediction performance of rsa, and the results show the prediction performance of rsa outperforms previous methods. our work provides a complementary and useful approach towards the more accurate prediction of protein solvent accessibility.
