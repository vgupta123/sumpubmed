BACKGROUND
the western honey bee  is an important pollinator and scientific model, particularly for studying social evolution and complex behavior. the reproductive ground plan hypothesis  of social evolution has been suggested to explain the evolution of several aspects of honey bee biology, particularly behavioral specialization in the helper caste of workers  <cit> . based on the ovarian ground plan hypothesis  <cit> , the rgph proposes that control modules of the ancestral gonotrophic cycle of a hypothetical solitary ancestor have been co-opted by social evolution, influencing honey bee worker behavior and life history. thus, hormones and genes are predicted to pleiotropically influence worker reproductive traits and nest provisioning behavior .

the rgph has been supported by an increasing number of studies  <cit> , accumulating evidence for associations between reproductive traits of honey bee workers and their social behavior and life history. these studies have used ovary size, a convenient reproductive trait because it varies greatly among individuals and can be easily quantified by dissection as the number of parallel ovary filaments, the ovarioles. ovary size co-varies with the age at which workers transition from in-hive tasks to foraging in different populations of a. mellifera  <cit> . after foraging initiation, many foragers specialize on either pollen or nectar collection and this specialization is also related to ovary size in a. mellifera  <cit>  and the eastern honey bee, apis cerana  <cit> . furthermore, ovary size correlates with other aspects of the pollen hoarding syndrome in worker honey bees  <cit> , such as sucrose responsiveness  <cit> .

in addition to these phenotypic correlations, the rgph predicts mechanistic links between reproductive and social behavioral regulation, which have been demonstrated by the study of candidate genes, such as vitellogenin  <cit>  and genes associated with insulin-like signaling  <cit> . however, the most stringent test of the rgph consists of the demonstration of common genetic variation for reproductive traits and social behavior that segregates in contemporary bee populations. genetic variation is implicated in enhancing the division of labor in honey bee colonies  <cit>  but not expected to result from selection on worker ovary size per se  <cit> .

artificially selected high and low pollen hoarding strains of honey bees  <cit>  were instrumental for the initial formulation of the rgph and detection of phenotypic associations between worker reproductive traits and social behavior  <cit> . these selected strains have also been used to establish the genetic co-segregation between ovary size and foraging specialization  <cit> . however, the generality of the relation between reproductive traits and foraging specialization in honey bees has been questioned because this relation was not found in a study of another selection line   <cit> . therefore, more general tests of co-segregating genetic variation for social behavior and reproductive traits are warranted to evaluate the rgph.

one such independent test system in the western honey bee  is provided by the africanized population in south and north america. it has originated through hybridization of an introduced a. mellifera scutellata ancestor from africa with honey bees of different subspecies of european descent, characterized by phenotypic and genomic displacement of the european by the african ancestor  <cit> . compared to the european honey bees  in america, africanized bees  are more responsive to sucrose, transition earlier to foraging tasks, and forage more for pollen  <cit> . the ovariole number of ahb workers is also higher than that of their ehb counterparts  <cit> , but see  <cit> . even though independent, this system is similar to the selected pollen hoarding strains at the phenotypic level: the ahb differ from the ehb in the same way that high pollen hoarding strain bees differ from low pollen hoarding strain bees. the ahb/ehb system has been used previously to confirm quantitative trait loci  for foraging specialization that had been initially discovered in the selected pollen hoarding strains  <cit> . thus, crosses between colonies selected from the ahb and ehb populations provide an independent test system of the prediction of genetic co-segregation of social behavior and ovary size.

in total, four qtl for pollen hoarding behavior and foraging specialization have been mapped in the honey bee genome  <cit> . these qtl  were repeatedly confirmed  <cit>  and found to pleiotropically affect other aspects of the pollen hoarding syndrome  <cit> . they are located on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> and are significantly enriched for genes involved in insulin-like signaling  <cit> . additional qtl for the age of first foraging  and for sucrose responsiveness  were identified  <cit>  but only three aff qtl could subsequently be located to specific genome locations on chromosome  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> . testing for genetic effects of the seven located pln and aff qtl on worker ovary size provide specific tests of a central prediction of the rgph.

the genetic architecture of ovary size has been studied in detail in drosophila, suggesting major, interacting qtl and environmental effects  <cit> , but little is known about other insect species. in social insects, ovary size is particularly important in the context of differential fertility between the female worker and queen castes  <cit> . honey bees have evolved a large caste difference: queen ovaries typically contain > <dig> ovarioles and workers < <dig>  <cit> . probably due to the evolution of this large phenotypic plasticity, intra-specific variability within the worker caste is also high, with significant population differences  <cit>  and strong variability within populations  <cit>  and even among sibling crosses  <cit> .

in a series of crosses between ahb and ehb, worker ovary size showed a transgressive inheritance pattern  <cit> : the parental ahb had more ovarioles per ovary than the parental ehb source, with hybrids intermediate. ehb backcrosses resulted in workers with ovariole numbers that were similar to the parental ehb, but ahb backcrosses showed much larger ovary sizes than their parents. in two of these crosses, workers had ovaries with as many as  <dig> and  <dig> ovarioles  <cit> , suggesting that segregating genetic variation in workers can lead to phenotypic differences in the same order of magnitude as caste differences. thus, the genetic basis of worker ovary size variation may be based on the same mechanisms that control caste differences  <cit> .

a preliminary analysis of these two crosses identified one strongly supported qtl on chromosome  <dig> and several weaker ones as the potential genetic basis for these large worker ovary sizes via selective, pooled qtl mapping  <cit> . however, this fast and cost-effective approach has previously generated results that could not be subsequently verified by individual genotyping  <cit> . the present study examines an extended population of workers with a transgressive ovary size from the two crosses analyzed previously  <cit> . our first objective is to specifically test for pleiotropic effects of the pln and aff qtl on ovary size, as predicted by the rgph. secondly, we extend our preliminary analysis  <cit>  towards a comprehensive understanding of the genetic architecture of the transgressive worker ovary trait by individual genotyping and analyzing different aspects of worker ovary size and worker ovary activation under queenless conditions.

RESULTS
ovary phenotypes
in the first backcross, abc <dig>  the minimum ovary size ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> ovarioles with a median of  <dig> , maximum ovary size ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> ovarioles with a median of  <dig>  and average ovary size from  <dig>  to  <dig> ovarioles with a median of  <dig>  . the differences between the larger and the smaller ovary ranged from  <dig> -  <dig> ovarioles with a median of  <dig>  , translating into relative differences from  <dig> to  <dig>  with a median of  <dig>  , and ratios from  <dig>  -  <dig>  with a median of  <dig>  . in the parallel backcross, abc <dig>  the minimum ovary size ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> ovarioles with a median of  <dig> , maximum ovary size ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> ovarioles with a median of  <dig> , and average ovary size from  <dig> to  <dig> ovarioles with a median of  <dig> . the differences between the larger and the smaller ovary ranged from  <dig> -  <dig> ovarioles with a median of  <dig>   <dig> , translating into relative differences from  <dig> to  <dig>  with a median of  <dig>  , and ratios from  <dig>  -  <dig>  with a median of  <dig>  . ovary activation scores ranged from  <dig> -  <dig> with a median of  <dig> . despite asymmetric ovaries in  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , ovary size between the two body sides was highly correlated . the overall negative correlation between ovary size and activation score in abc <dig> was caused by a non-linear relation between these two variables, combined with unequal representation of the different ovary activation classes in our sample . individuals with an activation score of three had significantly larger ovaries than individuals with activation scores of two  or four  but the latter effect outweighed the former due to unequal sample sizes . except for the relationship between minimum ovary size and the difference or ratio between the two ovary sides, abc <dig> and abc <dig> show very similar relations between the different variables .

qtl analyses
the final abc <dig> map contained  <dig> snp and  <dig> microsatellite markers with an average inter-marker interval of  <dig>  cm and  <dig> % of the mapable genome within  <dig> cm of at least one genetic marker. most of the top single markers  were represented in the qtl indicated by interval mapping : one major qtl for ovary size was mapped to chromosome  <dig> . lod support of this qtl well above significance and it explained about 1/ <dig> of the phenotypic variance in the mapping population for all ovary size traits but had only a subtle effect on ovary asymmetry measures . two additional, suggestive qtl for ovary size were found on chromosome  <dig>  approximately  <dig> cm proximal from marker at <dig> and on chromosome  <dig> between markers k <dig> and k <dig> . one significant qtl was found for ovary asymmetry on chromosome  <dig> between marker est <dig> and k0423b  with an effect that was independent of ovary size .

*c. = chromosome

* values describe the range of  <dig> different asymmetry measures.

mqm analysis increased the lod score of this asymmetry qtl and the statistical support for an effect of the qtl on chromosome  <dig> on ovary asymmetry . mqm also increased the lod score of the ovary size effects of the qtl on chromosome  <dig> and the suggestive qtl on chromosome  <dig>  but decreased lod scores for the suggestive qtl on chromosome  <dig>  for average ovary size, mqm also indicated another suggestive qtl on chromosome  <dig> near marker est <dig> 

none of the pairwise epistasis tests among the significant and suggestive qtl was significant after bonferroni correction. the empirically determined, genome-wide lod significance thresholds were  <dig>  for minimum ovary size, and  <dig>  for maximum and average ovary size. thresholds for ovary asymmetry ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , depending on the specific measurement.

the final map of abc <dig> contained  <dig> snp and  <dig> microsatellite markers with an average inter - marker interval of  <dig>  cm and  <dig> % of the mapable genome within  <dig> cm of at least one genetic marker. again, most top-scoring single markers  were located in the qtl identified by interval mapping : one major qtl for all ovary size traits was found on chromosome  <dig> between markers est <dig> and un <dig>  the region had no effect on asymmetry measure but strongly influenced the ovary activation score , although the lod trace diverged from the other traits . another significant qtl for ovary size but not ovary asymmetry or activation  was located on chromosome  <dig>  centered on marker est <dig> . the two significant ovary size qtl did not interact  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ).

* values describe the range of  <dig> different asymmetry measures.

a significant qtl for ovary asymmetry but not ovary size or activation  was found on chromosome  <dig> between markers est <dig> and est <dig> . no further, suggestive qtl for any traits were detected. the empirically determined, genome-wide significant thresholds were  <dig>  for minimum and average ovary size,  <dig>  for maximum ovary size, and  <dig>  for ovary activation score. significance thresholds ranged from  <dig>  for "relative difference" and  <dig>  for "absolute difference" to  <dig>  for "ratio", excluding chromosome  <dig> which produced a discrete group of unreasonably large lod scores of > <dig> for the asymmetry variables. mqm was precluded by the selective genotyping strategy in abc <dig> 

in abc <dig>  only the genetic marker near the aff <dig> qtl showed a significant effect on ovary size. in abc <dig>  markers near three of the previously determined behavioral qtl showed a significant effect on ovary size  and the effect of pln <dig> was suggestive . there were two overlaps between the three new ovary size qtl and the seven previously mapped, behavioral qtl when a wide confidence interval of the indeterminate  <cit> aff qtl on chromosome  <dig> was assumed. this or more overlap has a probability of  <dig>  to occur by chance in two crosses. assuming a narrow confidence interval for the aff qtl, only one overlap between the ovary and behavioral qtl was detected .

candidate genes
for each significant qtl, the  <dig>  lod support interval  <cit>  depicted as a black bar on the x-axis of figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  was searched for positional candidates in the ncbi database. the full list of the current  annotation of the positional candidates is available as online supplement. for the major qtl on chromosome  <dig>   <dig> gene models were predicted,  <dig> of which were hypothetical loci. the functionally most interesting genes in this list were the orthologs of quail  and cabut , but it was also noteworthy that the notch ortholog  was located just outside the qtl confidence interval. in the second major ovary size qtl region on chromosome  <dig> ,  <dig> positional candidates were present. two loci were hypothetical and functional candidates included the seven-up receptor ortholog , the transcription factor anormal oocyte ortholog , and the putative steroid hydrogenase loc <dig>  the third significant ovary size qtl on chromosome  <dig>  contained  <dig> gene models with significant similarity to known genes and  <dig> hypothetical locus. it partially overlapped with pln <dig> and thus contained some of the same functional candidate genes  but also orthologs of ajuba , abrupt , and toucan . the ovary asymmetry qtl on chromosome  <dig> contained  <dig> positional candidate gene models. twelve models were hypothetical loci and some functionally interesting genes were the putative achaete scute target  <dig> ortholog , the nedd <dig> ortholog loc <dig>  the ortholog of ctp:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase  <dig> , and the pebble ortholog loc <dig>  in the support interval of the ovary asymmetry qtl on chromosome  <dig>   <dig> total gene models included  <dig> hypothetical loci. among the remainder, noteworthy genes of known functions were the vitellogenin gene, the coro ortholog loc <dig>  and the mig-2-like ortholog loc <dig> 

discussion
as predicted by the rgph of social evolution in honey bees, worker ovary size showed genetic overlap with qtl of two key aspects of worker social behavior, the age of first foraging  <cit>  and foraging specialization  <cit> . thus, our study provides a strong, independent confirmation of the rgph by demonstrating genetic effects of behavioral qtl on ovary size in two crosses that are unrelated to the selected high and low pollen hoarding strains. the analyzed crosses differ dramatically in their ovarian phenotypes from these selected strains  <cit>  and most worker honey bees in general  <cit> . despite the phenotypic distinctiveness of the studied bees, the rgph prediction of phenotypic  <cit>  and genotypic linkage between the ovary and social behavior has been supported. together with previous qtl mapping studies  <cit> , our results indicate that pronounced, co-segregating genetic variation for worker ovary size and social behavior is maintained in contemporary honey bees. the magnitude of the qtl effects on ovary size suggests either a link to the evolution of caste differences  <cit>  or a significant role of this variation in colony function  <cit> .

with direct, pleiotropic effects in four of fourteen qtl tests in this system, the detected genetic overlap in abc <dig> and abc <dig> is stronger than in crosses between the high and low pollen hoarding strains, which showed two effects in eight tests  <cit> . such tests of pleiotropy in quantitative traits are conservative in general because the absence of an effect could be due to a lack of segregating variation in the specific cross studied or due to genetic background and environmental effects that may affect the penetrance of the qtl effect. accordingly, previous studies of genetic overlap between components of the pollen hoarding syndrome have found pleiotropic effects only in 3/ <dig> tests of pln qtl effects on sucrose responsiveness  <cit>  and in 1/ <dig> tests of pln qtl effects on the age of first foraging  <cit> . our study reports the highest proportion of genetic overlap, focusing on foraging behavior and the ovary. accounting for the marginal pln <dig> effect further strengthens this argument, increasing the proportion of positive tests to 5/ <dig>  in addition, the effect size of pln <dig>  and presumably also aff <dig>  on ovary size were sufficiently pronounced to be detected at the genome wide significance threshold for mapping novel qtl. the overlap between aff <dig> and the ovary size qtl on chromosome  <dig> was only detected with after widening the confidence interval for aff <dig>  however, this is justified because the initial interval was arbitrarily narrow, spanning only  <dig> cm  <cit> . in addition, evidence for widening the confidence interval of the ovary size qtl exists when the evidence from abc <dig> and abc <dig> is combined .

this study has also discovered novel qtl for ovarian traits of honey bee workers in regions that are not known for any behavioral effects. future studies will need to address whether these qtl also show behavioral effects. the partial genetic overlap among different aspects of the pollen hoarding syndrome, which has been reported previously  <cit>  corresponds best to a genetic network with a combination of central, pleiotropic regulators and downstream, specific effectors. this interpretation is compatible with our molecular understanding of worker ovary size determination during larval development, which is dependent on general regulators that influence all aspects of caste differentiation, such as juvenile hormone  <cit> , but progresses through very specific mechanisms, such as actin-spectrin interactions and apoptosis  <cit> .

the intervals for the three significant ovary size qtl contain  <dig> positional candidate genes in total, with several candidates that have either a general or a specific putative molecular role that make them plausible functional candidates. orthologs of at least  <dig> transcription factors and  <dig> members of major signaling pathways are present as candidates of potentially general function, and orthologs of  <dig> apoptosis-related and  <dig> actin-associated genes may represent functional candidates that are involved in the specific downstream processes that determine worker ovary size  <cit> . in addition, there may be numerous unannotated transcripts, particularly regulatory rna with a potential role in ovary development that we are not able to discuss. our top candidates for the qtl on chromosome  <dig> are the ortholgs of quail and cabut: quail is a villin-like protein that is active in various life history stages in the drosophila ovary and interacts with actin  <cit> , which makes it a potential specific effector on worker ovary size  <cit> . cabut is a transcriptional activator that is responsive to tor  <cit>  and ecdysone  <cit>  signaling, involved in the jnk cascade  <cit>  and autophagic cell death  <cit> . moreover, cabut shows developmental expression differences between the high and low pollen hoarding strains  <cit> . in addition, the chromosome  <dig> qtl interval contains the nfat transcription factor related loc <dig>  which is differentially expressed in female larval development  <cit>  and loc <dig>  the ortholog of a nadh dehydrogenase and three unidentified transcripts that all differ in expression between worker and queen developing ovaries .

we consider the ortholog of the seven-up receptor as the top functional candidate for the second major qtl  because seven-up is a nuclear receptor that can inhibit ecdysteroid signaling  <cit> , controls cell proliferation  <cit> , and interacts with krüppel  <cit> , a gene that has been implied in reproductive regulation in workers of honey bees and bumble bees  <cit> . we consider the transcription factor abnormal oocyte  a second top candidate because preliminary data show an exceptionally high dn/ds substitution ratio in this gene when a. dorsata, whose workers have very high ovariole numbers  <cit> , is compared to a. mellifera . the top candidates for the qtl on chromosome  <dig> are the orthologs of ajuba, a negative regulator of the hippo pathway that mediates tissue size by controlling cell proliferation and apoptosis  <cit> , midway, a diacylglycerol acyltransferase gene that has been linked to actin reorganization and apoptosis in the drosophila ovary  <cit>  and bazooka, a regulator of iis signaling  <cit>  that shows differential expression between the high and low pollen hoarding strains  <cit> . in addition, a putative amp-binding, fatty acid co-a ligase gene  and the fumarylacetoacetase gene  in this interval show differential expression  <cit> . functional candidates for ovary asymmetry are even harder to prioritize because they include genes that could influence ovary size  and genes dealing with stress resistance, such as a cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase  and glutathione s transferase s <dig> .

regardless of the molecular mechanism, our results show that there are at least three major and several minor qtl segregating in the two parallel crosses that we have analyzed. the phenotypic effects range from large, significant qtl to the pleiotropic effects of some of the behavioral qtl that could only be detected by specific tests. the most pronounced qtl was identified in abc <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  with an allelic substitution effect at the nearest marker  of six ovarioles for average ovary size, explaining over 1/ <dig> of the phenotypic variance in this cross. this major effect could explain the bimodality of ovary size in abc <dig> workers in certain environments  <cit> . caste development in general is a threshold process and it is possible that this qtl affects a specific threshold for ovary development, causing a major increase in ovary size that is modulated by minor loci and environmental effects, including indirect genetic effects  <cit> . a minor effect of this region on ovary size was detected in abc <dig> and this qtl was also identified by our preliminary qtl mapping based on selective, pooled genotyping of the same crosses  <cit> . in addition, the other ovary size qtl that had been indicated by the preliminary study in abc <dig>  <cit>  was detected by the individual analysis as a suggestive qtl on chromosome  <dig>  in contrast, none of the qtl that were initially identified only from abc <dig>  could be reconfirmed. this difference in concordance could be explained by the higher overlap of individuals used in the preliminary and this study in abc <dig> than in abc <dig>  however, the lack of overlap between the two studies in abc <dig> could also be due to differences in statistical power or methodological problems that can compromise pooled genotyping results  <cit> .

the second major qtl was detected in abc <dig> on chromosome  <dig> with a similar allelic substitution effect on ovary size  but no genotypic effect of this region was detected in the parallel cross abc <dig>  the consistent differences between the two crosses can only be explained by non-additive genetic effects in these backcrosses . the two queen mothers of abc <dig> and abc <dig> share any allele from their ahb father but only 50% of the alleles from their ehb mother. both backcrosses were sired by brother ahb drones that share any specific allele with 50% probability. however, these paternal alleles are not segregating in the backcrosses. since the increase in ovary size is derived from the ahb ancestor  <cit>  and the segregating ahb alleles are identical between abc <dig> and abc <dig>  the effect of these segregating alleles must depend on the identity of another allele, either at the same or at a different locus  to explain the differences between the parallel abc <dig> and abc <dig> crosses. such dominance or epistatic effects are ubiquitous in the genetic architecture of the pollen hoarding syndrome  <cit> . our results suggest that these effects may have also played a part in the evolution of caste divergence, shielding certain segregating alleles for reproductive potential from selection.

previously it had been suggested that at least two interacting loci with a recessive allele for large ovary size were responsible for the phenotype of abc <dig> and abc <dig>  as well as several other parallel backcrosses that did not show a high ovariole number  <cit> . the current results indicate that the genetic basis is more complex with three significant qtl, two suggestive qtl, and several loci of minor influence, such as the pln and aff qtl. the most likely explanation is that abc <dig> workers are fixed for a "large" ovary allele combination at several loci  that elevates the average ovary size and allows segregating variation at the qtl on chromosome  <dig>  to manifest itself. conversely, abc <dig> workers carry alternative allele combinations that make only a small difference in ovary size at the chromosome  <dig> qtl  but a large difference at the chromosome  <dig> qtl . additionally, several segregating alleles of minor effects may contribute to the elevated ovariole numbers in abc <dig>  alternatively, differential parental imprinting  <cit>  could explain the different phenotypes and qtl effects in the parallel crosses.

following  <cit> , we analyzed ovary size as a composite variable consisting of a smaller and a larger side. although the correlation between the two sides was high in both backcrosses, the two variables were affected slightly differently by the qtl. minimum ovary size showed a stronger association with genotype at most, but not all qtl. it may be that minimum size is less prone to environmental influences than maximum size. the two ovary size variables were also combined into different measures of asymmetry to assess the intra-individual plasticity of ovary size. the main conclusions did not differ significantly among the three specific measures. one qtl for ovary asymmetry without an effect on ovary size was identified in each cross. this is in contrast to our results in two different crosses  <cit>  and demonstrates genetic elements in these regions that influence either fluctuating or directional asymmetry of the ovary size in honey bee workers. based on our measurements, we cannot distinguish between directional and fluctuating asymmetry  <cit> , but directional asymmetry seems more likely for the following reasons: evidence for directional asymmetry in worker ovaries exists  <cit> , major qtl are more likely to be present for directional than for fluctuating asymmetry  <cit> , and no other striking asymmetries were noticeable in bees with asymmetric ovaries.

in abc <dig>  we took the opportunity to analyze the degree of worker ovarian activation under queenless conditions and found one strong qtl on chromosome  <dig>  explaining approximately 3/ <dig> of the phenotypic variation. this extremely high value suggests monogenetic inheritance but it is likely an overestimate due to the categorical nature of the variable "ovary activation". although the lod traces are different between this ovary activation qtl  and the ovary size qtl  in this genome region , the two qtl overlap extensively and may be due to the same molecular variant. the region does not overlap with any of the minor qtl for ovary activation reported in the anarchistic strains that can activate their ovaries in the presence of the queen  <cit>  and thus we conclude that the degree of ovary activation with and without a queen are not necessarily related.

in contrast to a previous study  <cit> , the ovary size and the degree of ovary activation in the 14-day old workers of the abc <dig> sample were not linearly correlated. instead, workers with the largest ovaries often showed only an activation score of  <dig>  while workers with slightly smaller ovaries more often had maximally developed ovaries. this effect could be due to a combination of the very large ovaries observed in this cross and the competition for food when almost all workers start to develop their ovaries under queenless conditions. almost all workers in abc <dig> had developed their ovaries to some extent. workers with very large ovaries may not have had sufficient nutrients in the absence of supporting workers  <cit>  to simultaneously activate their many ovarioles as effectively as workers with slightly smaller ovarioles  <cit> . these data suggest that there may be an optimal worker ovary size for individual worker reproduction when a colony becomes hopelessly queenless. in contrast, the maintenance of the observed extensive genetic variation for ovary size is likely to be due to selection on co-opted, new functions of the reproductive control modules.

CONCLUSIONS
the presented data provides further support for the rgph of social evolution by demonstrating that several behavioral qtl also affect ovary size in worker honey bees. in addition, significant novel qtl were detected for worker ovary size and asymmetry, as well as the degree of ovary activation under queenless conditions and a genetic model to explain the extreme phenotypes was proposed. evidence for non-additive effects exists, although pair-wise epistasis among the novel qtl could be excluded in both crosses. some functionally interesting candidate genes exist in these qtl that need to be studied further. the exceptional phenotypic variation of the two investigated crosses makes our results relevant for the mechanistic understanding of honey bee caste divergence and allowed us to test the rgph in an independent study system, exploiting a novel phenotypic space.
