BACKGROUND
the cricetid genus peromyscus constitutes the most abundant and speciose group of north american mammals. though superficially similar in appearance to rats and mice, deer mice represent a more distantly related lineage. mouse and rat are thought to have diverged from each other ~10– <dig> million years ago  while they last shared a common ancestor with the deer mouse  lineage ~ <dig> mya  <cit> . the p. maniculatus species complex is a series of semi-interfertile populations spanning nearly every habitat on the continent and is consequently an emerging tool for the study of natural mammalian genetic variation. facilitating such research is the existence of captive stocks derived from individual populations. utilizing two of these stocks, we have developed a comparative genomic map for the deer mouse to further research of this genus and to provide insight into the genome rearrangements seen in rats, mice, and other mammals.

comparative genomic analyses can reveal substantial amounts of information about the biology and evolution of species and are one of the keys to deciphering the roles that genomic structure and organization play in areas such as development, gene expression, and speciation. these analyses, however, are limited to portions of the genomes that have been mapped in all the species being compared and may be compromised by uncertainty of gene orthology and order between any two species.

although whole-genome sequences are available for many species, proper genome annotation is difficult and typically requires additional resources   <cit> . as a result, both cytogenetic methods and genetic linkage mapping are still essential tools for the analysis of genomic organization. while cytogenetic methods are effective for discerning large regions of chromosomal homology and conserved synteny, linkage maps are able to detect rearrangements of gene order within these fragments and pinpoint the locations of synteny breakpoints. such detailed genomic comparisons require ordered linkage maps that include orthologous type i  loci to provide landmarks that can be identified in the genomes of multiple species. comparative analyses using such a combined approach may reveal many more chromosomal rearrangements and novel synteny groups.

two of the most complete mammalian genomic maps are associated with the most used biomedical models, the rat  and mouse , which both belong to the rodent family muridae. rodentia is the largest mammalian order, containing >  <dig> of the ~ <dig> recognized species and the murids constitute the majority of these  <cit> . murid genomes analyzed to date not only show more rapid nucleotide mutation rates  <cit>  but also higher rates of chromosomal rearrangement than other mammals. murid chromosomal divergence rates are estimated to be one rearrangement per million years; ten times the rate for most mammalian genomes  <cit> . furthermore, such events are punctuated over time rather than having a steady-state mutation pattern  <cit> . this elevated rate of rearrangement has resulted in greater karyotypic divergence between rat and mouse than between much more distantly related species   <cit>  and has hampered reconstructions of ancestral rodent and mammalian genomes  <cit> . as a result, interpreting the evolutionary trajectory of chromosome segments between these model organisms and humans has proven difficult  <cit> . an outgroup to the two mapped murid genomes that is less divergent than human could alleviate these problems by aiding in the construction of a more accurate ancestral rodent genome.

here we describe the initial results of the first intermediate-density comparative genomic map for the deer mouse covering an estimated 35% of the deer mouse genome. these data suggest the deer mouse genomic organization more closely resembles that of rat than mouse, despite the much more recent common ancestor shared by the latter two species. considered with cytogenetic data  <cit>  and ancestral karyotype reconstructions  <cit> , our analysis further suggests that the deer mouse and rattus genomes have undergone fewer large scale rearrangements than mus.

RESULTS
design
we employed a standard backcross design for these studies utilizing p. maniculatus bairdii stock derived from washtenaw co. mi  and p. polionotus stock derived from ocala nat'l forest in florida . while neither population is completely inbred, both originated from a limited number of founders and have been maintained as closed colonies. thus, identifying fixed differences between the two  was typically not difficult.

map construction for p. maniculatus was conducted using both the rattus and mus maps as references  <cit>  and using assays designed to span rat-mouse synteny breakpoints. we use the term breakpoint when referring to a break between linkage groups as defined by pevzner and tesler  <cit> . in all, we have genotyped  <dig> type i gene markers from  <dig> different rattus chromosomes on our backcross panels. table  <dig> presents the complete list of markers used in our mapping study, their respective locations in the mouse and rat genomes, and the source of the primer sequences. the figures presented here though, focus on the markers around the breakpoint regions between mus and rattus genomes that are informative for this comparative analysis.

* mb denotes the physical position in megabases on the rattus and mus chromosomes  <cit> . ** markers beginning in pm_bw or contig are est clones developed at the peromyscus genetic stock center .

our backcross panels facilitated linkage of markers at distances ranging from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm. there are a few instances, however, where marker co-segregation occurs. these may be due to recombination "cold-spots", segmental inversions between the bw and po strains, or simply the interval distance may be below our mapping panel resolution.

mapping of loci from rattus chrs  <dig> and 14
our previous analysis of the peromyscus genome using loci from mus chr  <dig>  <cit>  indicated that there are two separate deer mouse linkage groups. zoo-fish data by mlynarski et al.  also supported this conclusion. these linkage groups correspond to rattus chrs  <dig> and  <dig> and the resulting chromosomal breakpoint is shared with the rattus genome relative to the mus genome . this breakpoint is also shared in other species, including human, chimpanzee, dog, and pig  <cit> . this conserved similarity led us to consider whether the deer mouse genome might share a higher degree of chromosomal similarity with rattus than to mus.

to explore this possibility, we expanded the existing linkage groups using loci whose orthologs lie on rattus chrs  <dig> and  <dig> but are not located on mus chr  <dig> . for the rattus chr  <dig> homology group, we generated markers for btbd <dig> and gbl, which correspond to regions of mus chr  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. single loci for each segment were sufficient because the mus chrs  <dig> and  <dig> segments are small and most of rattus chr  <dig> is homologous with mus chr  <dig>  we found both markers to be clearly linked to the terminal locus from rattus chr  <dig>  xbp <dig>  with very high lod scores  indicating rat genome homology. however, all three markers co-segregated. at a distance of only  <dig>  mb in the rattus genome, these markers are likely to be closer in the deer mouse than our panel is able to resolve.

using a similar strategy, we also expanded the rattus chr  <dig> homology group using two loci from mus chr  <dig> that have orthologs on rattus chr  <dig>  afp and hip <dig>  similar to both rattus and mus genomes, afp and hip <dig> are linked in the deer mouse at a distance of  <dig>  cm  . similar only to the rattus genome though, we found linkage in the deer mouse between hip <dig> and the mus chr  <dig> marker xbp <dig> at a distance of  <dig>  cm  . the marker intervals for this group were larger than those of the rattus chr  <dig> markers and allowed us to map  <dig>  mb  of rattus chr  <dig> in the deer mouse with only a few markers. our results again show a greater similarity between peromyscus genome organization and the rattus genome than either to the mus genome.

the high degree of rattus genome similarity that we found for these two deer mouse linkage groups warranted examination of additional informative regions where synteny breakpoints occur between the mus and rattus genomes. while not comprehensive for every chromosome, this strategy accelerated our examination of chromosome evolution for the deer mouse genome and helped determine the best reference genome for future deer mouse genome mapping.

mapping the informative regions of rattus chr 1
we next chose markers that spanned rattus chr  <dig>  focusing our efforts within the regions surrounding the breakpoints between mus chrs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . within the mus chr  <dig> homology segment, we established linkage between tcp10b and pacrg at  <dig>  cm and between pacrg and mas <dig> at  <dig>  cm with lod scores of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. these distances are concordant with those for both the rattus and mus genomes. we had also previously shown linkage between tcp10b and mas <dig> using the deer mouse radiation hybrid panel  <cit> . we then genotyped the mus chr  <dig> marker plagl <dig> to test for linkage to the mus ch <dig> markers and found mas <dig> to be linked at a distance of  <dig>  cm . this linkage conservation is again consistent with the rattus genome but not with mus.

we next tested for linkage between the mus chr  <dig> and mus chr  <dig> homology segments of rattus chr  <dig> and found no linkage in peromyscus between any mus chr  <dig> markers and the mus chr  <dig> marker usp <dig>  which is only  <dig>  mb away on rattus chr  <dig>  we made no further efforts to extend the mus chr  <dig> linkage group, as usp <dig> is only  <dig>  mb from the centromeric end of mus chr  <dig> and additional markers in this region were unlikely to yield a different result. we also tested for linkage between the mus chr  <dig> marker mas <dig> and the mus chr  <dig> markers usp <dig> and myod <dig> on a po × po/bw backcross panel. this was to ensure that our negative linkage results were not a result of aberrant interspecific chromosomal recombination in the bw × bw/po panel. again, mas <dig> did not link to either locus. the lack of linkage between mus chr  <dig> and mus chr  <dig> homology segments in the deer mouse genome constituted the first example of a common breakpoint between the deer mouse and mus genomes when compared to rattus.

although uninformative for our comparative rearrangement analyses, we established linkage homology in the deer mouse for the large  mus chr  <dig> section of rattus chr  <dig> using five markers: usp <dig>  q8c5y <dig>  ube3a, rab6ip <dig>  and h <dig>  althoughthe riken cdna marker q8c5y <dig> has not been accurately mapped in either rattus or mus, blast results indicated intervals between q8c5y <dig> and usp <dig> at  <dig>  mb for the rattus genome and  <dig>  mb in the mus genome. in support of our placement, the mus chr 7/rattus chr  <dig> marker ube3a co-segregated with q8c5y <dig> in the deer mouse. our data for these five mus chr  <dig> markers showed high conservation of linkage and gene order with both rattus and mus genomes  with lod scores all well above the  <dig>  threshold. our results for the mus chr  <dig> region were also concordant with a previous study  <cit>  from which we utilized two of the same markers, usp <dig> and h <dig> 

we also found genome homology between rattus and the deer mouse genome by markers spanning the breakpoint between the mus chr  <dig> and chr  <dig> regions of rattus chr  <dig>  the mus chr  <dig> marker h <dig> is linked to the mus chr  <dig> marker prdx <dig> at a distance of  <dig>  cm . prdx <dig> is also linked to a second mus chr  <dig> marker prpf <dig> at a distance  <dig>  cm .

overall, our data for rattus chr  <dig> loci show that the two deer mouse linkage groups span two mus genome breakpoints but only one rattus genome breakpoint, which shows a continued bias towards similarity with the rattus genome. our results also imply that the mus genome has been more rearranged in this region.

breakpoint mapping of rattus chr  <dig> and chr  <dig> loci
to broaden the scope of the deer mouse map and help reduce bias resulting from any localized phenomenon such as segmental inversions, we acquired data for markers from multiple rattus chromosomes. rattus chrs  <dig> and  <dig> were priority candidates because of the simple breakpoint arrangements and well-conserved gene orders between rattus and mus.

rattus chr  <dig> is represented by the entirety of mus chr  <dig> and approximately  <dig> mb of the centromeric end of mus chr  <dig>  to test for a conserved organization in the deer mouse genome, we typed two markers from each side of the breakpoint on our backcross panel . we found the two mus chr  <dig> markers, srpk <dig> and sri, are linked to each other at  <dig>  cm  and the two mus chr  <dig> markers, ccdc <dig> and 1700016g05rik, are linked to each other at a distance of  <dig>  cm . spanning the breakpoint, we found that sri and ccdc <dig> are linked to each other at a distance of  <dig>  cm . overall, our results span about 30% of rattus chr  <dig> and show conservation of the rattus gene order. however, the linkage between sri and srpk <dig> was shorter than expected and may be due to a recombination cold-spot, an interspecific inversion, or a deletion.

our mapping of rattus chr  <dig> loci consisted of ten markers: sos <dig>  ppp1cb, preb, dnmt3a, allc, 493504h06rik, pygl, clec14a, pcnx, and 1700001k19rik. these markers span mus chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> and our results yielded two separate linkage groups . the deer mouse linkage group homologous to the centromeric end of rattus chr  <dig> consists of five loci and represents three different chromosomes in mus. this group is conserved in both synteny and gene order with the rattus genome. from mus chr  <dig>  sos <dig> is linked to the mus chr  <dig> marker ppp1cb at a distance of  <dig>  cm . within the mus chr  <dig> segment, ppp1cb is linked to preb at a distance of  <dig>  cm . a second mus breakpoint is spanned by the linkage between preb and the mus chr  <dig> marker dnmt3a at a distance of  <dig>  cm . also from mus chr  <dig>  allc represents the terminal marker and links to dnmt3a at an interval of  <dig>  cm .

the five remaining markers from mus chr  <dig> form a second linkage group in peromyscus. although synteny with both rattus chr  <dig> and mus chr  <dig> is conserved, we discovered an inversion with respect to both mus and rattus involving markers clec14a and pygl . defining this inversion, pygl is linked to 493504h06rik at a distance of  <dig>  cm  while clecl4a is linked to the more telomeric marker pcnx at a distance of  <dig>  cm . we also found that clec14a and pygl have smaller distance interval at  <dig>  cm  than would have been expected from the physical intervals in mus  and rattus . forming the end of the linkage group, pcnx was linked to 1700001k19rik at a distance of  <dig>  cm .

the spanning of two mus genome breakpoints by the deer mouse linkage groups again indicates a more rattus-like genome organization. however, the breakpoint between the two peromyscus linkage groups flanked by the two mus chr  <dig> markers allc and 493504h06rik represents a unique rearrangement that differs from both the rattus and mus genomes. zoo-fish results from mlynarski et al.  also concur that rattus chr  <dig> is indeed represented by two separate chromosomes in the deer mouse.

mapping loci from mus chr 1/rattus chrs  <dig>   <dig>  and 13
to avoid possible bias towards finding only rattus genome similarity, we also selected markers to span rattus synteny breakpoints in relation to the mus genome. this involved markers that span approximately 89% of mus chr  <dig> but are located separately in rattus on chrs  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . with exception of the rattus chr  <dig> marker col9a <dig>  we found linkage between all of the markers within their rattus chromosome homology groups but not between them, indicating a bias toward rattus genome similarity.

for the rattus chr  <dig> region, we detected non-segregating linkage between oprk and tram in the deer mouse with a strong lod score of  <dig> . to further investigate rattus genome homology, we employed a third rattus chr  <dig> marker, ube2j <dig>  which is located on mus chr  <dig>  consistent with rattus genome organization, ube2j <dig> linked strongly  but without segregation to oprk <dig> and tram <dig>  despite a distance  <dig>  mb in the rattus genome between ube2j <dig> and oprk <dig> 

at the telomeric end of mus chr  <dig>  we detected linkage between the rattus chr  <dig> markers acbd <dig> and glul at a distance of  <dig>  cm  and between glul and bcl <dig> at  <dig>  cm  . however, we did not detect linkage between bcl <dig> and the mus chr  <dig> marker fn <dig>  as would be expected by mus genome homology.

amongst the rattus chr  <dig> markers, we found col3a <dig> and fn <dig> were linked at a distance of  <dig>  cm . however, col3a <dig> is surprisingly not linked to col9a <dig>  which represents a deviation from the rattus genome. to confirm these results, we also tested mut, a marker that is closely linked to col9a <dig> on rattus chr  <dig> . mut is located  <dig>  mb from col9a <dig> on rattus chr  <dig> but in mus is located separately on chr  <dig>  mut did not link to col3a <dig> but did co-segregate with col9a <dig> , thus identifying a linkage similarity between the rattus and deer mouse genomes. the breakpoints present in the deer mouse and mus maps for this region are offset and may represent breakpoint area re-usage and a rearrangement hotspot  <cit> . however, more detailed mapping using markers located between col9a <dig> and col3a <dig> on rattus chr  <dig> are needed to refine the breakpoint location. we discovered additional rattus chr  <dig> similarity using the marker lama, which represents a second and separate region of mus chr  <dig> than that of mut . we found lama <dig> and fn <dig> are linked in the deer mouse at a distance of  <dig>  cm .

mapping loci from mus chr 8/rattus chrs  <dig>   <dig>  and 19
as another test of peromyscus genome homology to mus, we performed an analysis using six loci from mus chr  <dig> that form two linkage groups in the rattus genome . we selected markers in each group that are less than  <dig> mb apart in the rattus genome to facilitate deer mouse linkage detection. additionally, the two markers that flank the breakpoint, 9130404h06rik and elmod <dig>  are about  <dig>  mb apart in mus, which is well within the range of our mapping panel.

as with the mus chr  <dig> analysis, we found linkage with highly significant lod scores but only within the individual rattus chromosomal groups, not between them. for the rattus chr  <dig> segment, adam <dig> and mtus <dig> are linked at distance of  <dig>  cm  and mtus <dig> is linked to spata <dig> at a distance of  <dig>  cm . spata <dig> is also linked to the terminal marker 9130404d08rik at a distance of  <dig>  cm . the two markers from rattus chr  <dig>  elmod <dig> and pmfbp <dig>  are linked  <dig>  cm .

based on suggestions from zoo-fish results , we also examined an additional chromosomal segment for linkage. representing rattus chr  <dig> and mus chr  <dig>  sec61a <dig> links to the rattus chr 19/mus chr  <dig> marker pmfbp <dig> at a distance of  <dig>  cm . this linkage indicates a clear deviation from both the rattus and mus genomes by the deer mouse genome and highlights the benefit of performing cytogenetic analyses in tandem with meiotic linkage mapping.

linkage testing of mus chrs  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> loci
we performed additional tests for mus genome similarity within the deer mouse using loci from mus chrs  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . these results also came out negative for mus genome similarity. mus chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> are two of the most rearranged chromosomes in the mus genome compared to the rattus genome. mus chr  <dig> and has seven different regions representing five different rattus chromosomes  and mus chr  <dig> has four major regions representing four rattus chromosomes and three very small segments representing three additional rattus chromosomes . positive linkage results for these highly rearranged chromosomes in the deer mouse would have been a strong indicator of mus homology.

for mus chr  <dig>  six markers  were tested for linkage in all possible arrangements despite having already been assigned to other deer mouse linkage groups. no linkage was found other than that which already existed amongst the rattus chr  <dig> markers tcp10b, pacrg, and mas <dig> .

we conducted a similar test for several markers from mus chr  <dig> . eleven markers representing five rattus chromosomes were tested for linkage. as in the mus chr  <dig> analysis, linkage was found only between markers located on the same rattus chromosomes.

two mus chr  <dig> markers, clptml <dig> and spz, also failed to show linkage despite being only about  <dig>  mb apart in the mus genome, thus further reinforcing the linkage group disparities between the deer mouse and mus genomes. clptml <dig> is located in rattus chr  <dig> and spz <dig> is on rattus chr  <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
genome mapping and genomic evolution
development and availability of multiple mapping tools is essential for accurate and timely exploration of any species' genome. three methods have already been employed in mapping small portions of the deer mouse genome in the form of cytogenetics  <cit> , meiotic segregation analysis  <cit> , and a whole-genome radiation hybrid cell panel  <cit> . these tools are most powerful when used in combination, as exemplified by rowe et al.  <cit>  for mus and by menotti et al.  <cit>  for the cat.

here we significantly expand the peromyscus meiotic segregation mapping data using two p. maniculatus × p. polionotus interspecific backcross panels and present the most comprehensive comparative linkage mapping data for the deer mouse to date using type i gene markers. in addition to providing an important genetic tool for peromyscus research, we tested whether the deer mouse genome displayed organizational homology to that of mus musculus, rattus norvegicus, or a combination of both. our results indicate a large degree of gene order and synteny conservation by the deer mouse genome with that of rattus.

our analysis was done by establishing linkage over approximately 35% of the deer mouse genome using gene markers that predominantly spanned junctions of large-scale genome rearrangements between the rattus and mus genomes. while using the rattus genome as the reference, we tested  <dig> mus genome breakpoints. ten of the  <dig> breakpoints spanned by the rattus genome were similarly linked in the deer mouse genome. in contrast, only one of  <dig> rattus genome breakpoints that we examined while using the mus genome as a reference closely coincided with any linkage breakpoints that we found in deer mouse genome. these data demonstrate that the organization of the deer mouse and rattus genomes are more similar to each other than either is to mus.

there are three instances, however, where the deer mouse map differs from both the rattus and mus maps. two examples are located between markers allc and 493504h06rik  and between markers col9a <dig> and col3a <dig> . approximately  <dig> mb separates the latter pair in both rattus and mus, so additional markers will need to be applied to the deer mouse panel to better pinpoint the location of this breakpoint. the third instance is the unique deer mouse linkage of sec61a <dig> to pmfbp <dig>  collaborative efforts have also helped to inform, as well as confirm, some of these data using additional tools such as zoo-fish analyses using flow-sorted whole chromosome probes . the strong organizational similarity of the deer mouse genome with the rattus genome rather than the more morphologically similar mus musculus suggests that a significant amount of rearrangement occurred in the mus genome after the divergence of the cricetid and murid lineages. concomitantly, our results suggest that the genomic organizations of rattus and peromyscus are more representative of the ancestral muroid genome than the mus genome, which is in agreement with previous literature that indicated a higher rate of genome rearrangement for mus  <cit> . most eutherian genomes have  <dig> to  <dig> blocks of homology with the human genome while the mus genome is extraordinary with approximately  <dig> homology blocks. however, the mus genome is not unique in having higher relative rearrangement rates, as the canine and gibbon genomes have approximately twice the average number of homology blocks  <cit> .

our results also show that genome rearrangement can act independently from other forms of genome evolution, such as sequence mutation. although rodent sequence mutation rates are higher compared to other mammals, such measurements of genome evolution show mus and rattus shared a common ancestor significantly more recently than either have with peromyscus. our data does not propose to change this phylogeny but rather merely highlights that dna sequence variation and chromosome rearrangement are independent processes and greater understanding of both processes can provide different insights into the evolution of the structure and function of the eukaryotic genome.
