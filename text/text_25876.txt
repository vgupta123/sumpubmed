BACKGROUND
the phosphatase calcineurin is a heterodimeric protein composed by a catalytic subunit a and a regulatory subunit b  <cit> . in fungi, calcineurin plays an important role in the control of cell morphology and virulence  <cit> . calcineurin regulates morphogenesis, ca+ <dig> homeostasis, and stress-activated transcription in saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> . in pathogenic fungi, calcineurin affects virulence, morphogenesis, and antifungal drug action  <cit> . inactivation of calcineurin in cryptococcus neoformans affects growth at 37°c and hyphal elongation during mating and haploid fruiting  <cit> . reduced virulence and absence of growth in serum are also observed in candida albicans depleted in the calcineurin activity  <cit> . in a. fumigatus, calcineurin inactivation decreases the virulence and provides decreased filamentation and no growth in serum  <cit> .

calcineurin regulates the localization and activity of the transcription factor crz1p by dephosphorylating it  <cit> . upon increase in cytosolic calcium, calcineurin dephosphorylates crz1p, allowing its nuclear translocation  <cit> . crz1p has a c2h <dig> zinc finger motif that binds to a cdre  in the promoters of genes that are regulated by calcineurin and calcium  <cit> . mutants of s. cerevisiae inactivated in crz <dig> display hypersensitivity to chloride and chitosan, a defective transcriptional response to alkaline stress, and cellular morphology and mating defects  <cit> . inactivation crz <dig> mutants of schizosaccharomyces pombe  are hypersensitive to calcium and have decreased transcription of the pmc <dig> ca+ <dig> pump  <cit> . c. albicans homozygotes crz1Δ/Δ are moderately attenuated for virulence and sensitive to calcium, lithium, manganese, and sodium dodecyl sulfate  <cit> . a. fumigatus crz <dig> mutant, Δcrza, is avirulent and has decreased conidiation  <cit> . its hypersensitivity to calcium and manganese is probably due to the reduced expression of calcium transporter mrnas under high concentrations of calcium  <cit> .

here, we investigate which pathways are influenced by a. fumigatus afcrza during a short pulse of calcium by comparatively determining the transcriptional profile of a. fumigatus wild type and Δafcrza mutant strains. our results revealed several possible novel targets for afcrza, including afrcna, a member of the conserved calcineurin-binding proteins, the calcipressins. besides the transcriptional profiling of the a. fumigatus Δafcrza, we also showed the molecular characterization of aspergilli rcnas.

RESULTS
transcriptional profiling of the a. fumigatus Δcrza mutant strain
to have a better understanding of which genes are influenced by a. fumigatus afcrza during exposure to calcium, we performed competitive microarray hybridizations using rna obtained from the wild type and Δafcrza strains after short pulses  of  <dig> mm calcium chloride. rna obtained from wild type mycelia exposed to  <dig> and  <dig> minutes calcium was taken as reference. thus, total rna extracted from these cultures was used to synthesize fluorescent-labeled cdnas for competitive microarray hybridizations. in these experiments, the main aim was to focus on genes that have increased or decreased mrna expression in the absence of afcrza. we were able to observe  <dig>  genes modulated in at least one timepoint in the mutant when compared to the wild type strain . the large difference between the number of genes modulated at  <dig> and  <dig> minutes  suggests a. fumigatus responds rapidly to calcium stressing conditions. the full dataset was deposited in the gene expression omnibus  from the national center of biotechnology information  with the number gse <dig> http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=gse <dig>  previously, to evaluate the effect of calcium on global a. fumigatus gene expression, we performed competitive microarray hybridizations using rna obtained from the wild type strain before and after a short pulse  of  <dig> mm calcium chloride . statistical analysis of this dataset identified a total of  <dig> genes that displayed modulation. the large difference in genes whose expression is modulated between this dataset and the current dataset using a comparison between Δcrza and the wild type strains emphasizes the pleiotropic role played by a. fumigatus calcineurin-crza in the calcium-mediated signal transduction pathways. we are currently investigating the importance of this difference.

we observed differential regulation of genes involved in a variety of cellular processes and specific modulation of these functions is therefore likely to be implicated with a. fumigatus adaptation to high concentrations of calcium . these genes were classified into cog functional categories http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cog/. however, we were not able to observe any significant enrichment for a specific cog category . we noted decreased mrna abundance in the Δafcrza of several genes involved in calcium transport, such as the vacuolar h+/ca+ <dig> , calcium-translocating p-type atpase , and calcium-transporting atpase  <dig> . we also observed decreased mrna accumulation when the Δafcrza strain was exposed to calcium of genes encoding several transcription factors , and genes that could be directly or indirectly involved in calcium metabolism [such as a phospholipase d , two peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases , a calcineurin binding protein , a bar adaptor protein , and a potential regulator of cytoskeleton and endocytosis, homologue of mammalian amphiphysin. interestingly, a chitin synthase a  also showed decreased mrna accumulation in the Δafcrza strain background. cramer et al.  <cit>  have shown that the calcineurin pathway plays an important role in cell wall biosynthesis in a. fumigatus, and that calcineurin and afcrza inactivation mutants are more sensitive to specific cell wall inhibitors, such as caspofungin. however, in contrast to our results these authors have observed an increased and decreased mrna accumulation of chitin synthase a in the Δafcrza and Δafcala mutant strains, respectively. several of the genes above mentioned  have also been observed by soriani et al.  <cit>  as more expressed upon exposure of a. fumigatus to calcium. we have also previously observed that zfpa  has increased mrna accumulation that is dependent on the cyclic amp-protein kinase a signaling pathway during adaptation to voriconazole  <cit> . thus, it is plausible that zfpa is related to a transcriptional network controlled by calcineurin-crza that has a key role in mediating cellular stress responses.

we observed increased mrna accumulation when the Δafcrza strain was exposed to calcium of genes encoding a class v chitinase , an exo-β- <dig> -glucanase , an aaa family atpase , a cation diffusion facilitator  <dig>  a multidrug resistance protein , a tor signalling pathway protein tipa , an inositol polyphosphate phosphatase , a representative of the hsp9- <dig> heat shock protein scf <dig> , and a protein phosphatase 2c . again, the increased expression of the chitinase and exo-β- <dig> -glucanase could help to explain the increased sensitivity of a. fumigatus Δafcrza strain to caspofungin  <cit> . interestingly, some of these genes are involved in stress response, such as:  the scf <dig> homologue , a plasma membrane localized protein that protects membranes from desiccation and it is induced by heat shock, oxidative stress, osmostress, stationary phase entry, glucose depletion, oleate and alcohol, and is regulated by the hog and ras-pka pathways http://www.yeastgenome.org <cit> ;  tipa , a component of the tor  signaling pathway, that interacts physically and genetically with tap42p, which regulates protein phosphatase 2a  <cit> ; and  a protein phosphatase 2c , important physiological regulator of cell growth and of cellular stress signaling  <cit> . the increased mrna accumulation of these genes could mean that they are directly or indirectly repressed by afcrza and can open new frontiers for studying biochemical pathways that are under influence of the a. fumigatus calcineurin-crza pathway.

we then used rt-pcr, both to assess the reliability of the microarray hybridizations and to document mrna expression from selected genes of interest in the wild type, Δafcala and Δafcrza mutant backgrounds, choosing five genes  to analyze after  <dig> and  <dig> minutes in the presence of  <dig> mm cacl <dig>  we had previously shown that five other genes , identified here in this screening had induced mrna accumulation in the presence of calcium, but reduced in Δafcrza mutant background  <cit> . expressing the results as fold induction relative to expression prior to calcium exposure, all values were in strong agreement with array hybridisation data . comparisons between the gene expression variation estimated by microarray and real-time rt-pcr were performed by calculating both pearson's  and spearman's  correlation coefficients for the log <dig> ratios obtained by these two approaches. positive correlation was observed for both rp and rs in all nine genes   <cit> . furthermore, the value of either rp or rs was above  <dig>  . thus, these data suggest that our approach was able to provide information about a. fumigatus gene expression modulation with a considerably high level of confidence.

it is very impressive the mrna accumulation levels of the hsp9- <dig> heat shock protein scf <dig> homologue : about  <dig> and  <dig> times more in the Δcrza and Δcala than in the wild type, respectively . a. fumigatus has two hsp <dig> homologues, afu1g <dig>  and afu6g <dig> . interestingly, the s. cerevisiae hsp <dig> was also shown to be induced by calcium but in contrast to the a. fumigatus homologue, the s. cerevisiae gene is repressed when calcium+fk <dig> were added and accordingly repressed in the Δcrz <dig> background  <cit> . thus, it remains to be determined the roles played by calcineurin, afcrza, and afhsp12p during adaptation of a. fumigatus to calcium stress.

recently, hagiwara et al.  <cit>  identified and characterized the a. nidulans ancrza gene. they performed an in silico analysis by using meme  of the possible presence of a cdre-like consensus motif in the promoter regions of  <dig> ancrza-dependent genes. by analyzing their promoter regions, 5'-gggcgg-3' was presumed to be the consensus sequence for the a. nidulans ancrza-dependent genes. by using a combination of meme analysis and the a. nidulans cdre consensus as a guide, we were able to identify in the afrcna, afrfef, afbar, and the a. fumigatus phospholipase d promoter regions  the following cdre motifs:  afrcna ,  afrfef ,  afbar , and  a. fumigatus phospholipase d . we compared these motifs with the promoter regions  of  <dig> repressed genes described in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  and this analysis suggested 5'-gtgga-3' as the cdre-consensus sequence for a. fumigatus afcrza-dependent genes. we also analyzed afscf <dig> and af aaa atpase genes and found the following cdre-like motifs:  afscf <dig> , and  af aaa atpase . again, we compared these motifs with the promoter regions  of  <dig> induced genes described in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  and we were able to propose as a putative cdre consensus for gene repressed by afcrza, the sequence 5'-gacga-3'. it remains to be experimentally determined if these sequences are really important for afcrza gene regulation, both for gene induction and repression.

prior to this work, a study analysing global gene expression regulated by the calcineurin/crz1p signaling pathway in s. cerevisiae had attempted to identify genes regulated by calcium and sodium  <cit> . calcineurin activation induced  <dig> genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis, ion homeostasis, vesicle trafficking, lipid synthesis, and protein degradation. a notable similarity was observed by the authors in the gene expression patterns of fk506-treated cells and crz <dig> cells, suggesting that crz1p is required for most calcineurin-dependent changes in gene expression. recently, soriani et al.  <cit>  opted to an alternative strategy, exposing a. fumigatus wild type strain to a short pulse with a high concentration of calcium, and arbitrarily choosing several genes that were less or more expressed in the microarray hybridization analyses to verify their expression in the wild type, and Δafcala and Δafcrza mutant strains by real-time rt-pcr. thus, these authors were able to determine if the expression of these genes was dependent on calcineurin and/or afcrza. they verified that the majority of these genes suffered blocking of mrna accumulation in the Δafcrza background. the results shown here added more information about the transcriptional network involved in the calcineurin-afcrza in response to calcium.

construction of aspergilli crza overexpression strains
overexpression of afcrza could reveal genes regulated by the calcineurin-afcrza pathway. accordingly, we constructed an overexpression a. fumigatus afcrza strain by using the alca promoter. the a. nidulans alca promoter homologously replaced the afcrza promoter . the alca promoter is repressed by glucose, derepressed by glycerol and induced to high levels by ethanol or l-threonine  <cit> . when a. fumigatus is grown on glycerol 2% supplemented either with ethanol 2% or threonine  <dig> mm, afcrza mrna accumulation in increased about  <dig> - and  <dig> -times, respectively compared to growth on glucose 4% . as expected, when the afcrza is repressed in the presence of glucose, the alca::afcrza strain is more sensitive to calcium ; however, surprisingly high levels of afcrza mrna accumulation also make the alca::afcrza strain more calcium-sensitive . these results suggest that crza overexpression could potentially disturb the mrna accumulation of genes that are important for the calcium homeostasis in the cell, thus disturbing the calcium metabolism into the cell and consequently the growth in the presence of increasing calcium concentrations. to test this hypothesis we used real-time rt-pcr to verify the mrna levels of selected genes observed as having decreased mrna and increased accumulation . as it can be seen in figure  <dig>  all tested genes to different extent have increased mrna accumulation when the afcrza is overexpressed. the af aaa atpase  and afscf <dig>  have increased mrna accumulation when the Δafcrza was exposed to calcium suggesting they are repressed by afcrza . we expected their mrna accumulation would be reduced when afcrza is overexpressed. however, the mrna levels of these genes were lower in the alca::afcrza than in the Δafcrza mutant strain , what could indicate that afcrza is partially controlling the mrna accumulation levels of these genes. the genes encoding afpmcb , afrcna , afrfef , and afbar adaptor protein  are about  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> times more expressed in the alca::afcrza mutant than the wild type strain, respectively . the afpmcb  gene is a. fumigatus homologue of the yeast pmc <dig>  a vacuolar ca+ <dig> atpase involved in depleting cytosol of ca+ <dig> ions and preventing growth inhibition by activation of calcineurin in the presence of elevated concentrations of calcium  <cit> . the increased expression of this gene suggests afcrza is controlling directly or indirectly its expression. furthermore, the increased mrna accumulation of these calcium transporter-encoding genes is quite consistent taking into consideration the dramatic stress condition caused by the sudden increase in calcium concentration that needs either to be removed from the cytoplasm or transported to vacuoles. considering the growth inhibition of the aspergilli alca::afcrza strain under high-ca+ <dig> conditions , one possible interpretation of these results is that the afcrza overexpression can inhibit the function of another factor that is necessary for growth under high-ca+ <dig> conditions.

a. fumigatus afrcna belongs to a class of endogenous calcineurin regulators, calcipressins, a family of calcineurin-binding proteins, conserved from yeast to mammals  <cit> . a phylogenetic analysis was performed to determine the relationship of afrcna to calcipressin homologues in several different organisms . the mechanism how this protein family functions still remains controversial. there are reports showing that calcipressins can both stimulate and inhibit the calcineurin pathway  <dig>  induction of s. cerevisiae rcn1-lacz in response to calcium was completely blocked by addition of fk <dig> or by deletion of the genes encoding tcn1p or calcineurin  <cit> . the s. cerevisiae rcn <dig> is also induced by calcium, repressed by calcium+fk <dig> and in the crz <dig> background  <cit> . another member of this family, cbp <dig>  was identified in cryptococcus neoformans, and is required for mating but not for growth at 37°c  <cit> . we have observed that afrcna mrna accumulation upon calcium stress is dependent on both calcineurin and afcrza . these results suggest that both s. cerevisiae and a. fumigatus rcan homologues may be downstream targets of the calcineurin-dependent transcription factor. this fits a model where increased a. fumigatus afrcna regulation in response to calcineurin signaling is possibly a negative-feedback mechanism modulating calcineurin acitivity.

we constructed an a. nidulans alca::ancrza also by replacing the endogenous ancrza promoter region homologously with the a. nidulans alca promoter. we investigate the genetic interactions between Δancnaa and Δancrza mutations and a double mutant Δancnaa Δancrza displays the same growth behavior than the Δancnaa mutant indicating as expected that ancnaa is epistatic to ancrza .

molecular characterization of the aspergilli calcipressin homologue
to have more information about the function of some of the genes identified as more expressed in the a. fumigatus wild type and repressed in the Δafcrza, we inactivated the afrcna , afrfef , af bar adaptor protein , and a. fumigatus phospholipase d . since calcium is involved in different kinds of stresses, such as oxidative stress and uncontrolled proliferation and survival  <cit> , we decided to determine if several different culture conditions could affect the growth of these deletion strains. except for Δafrcna, the deletion mutants showed comparable growth phenotypes to the wild type strain in the presence of the following agents or stressing situations: oxidizing agents and metals , calcium, cyclosporine a, dna damaging agents , and temperature  . however, Δafrcna growth was less sensitive to menadione  <dig> μm, hydrogen peroxide  <dig>  mm, egta  <dig> mm, and mncl <dig>  <dig> mm . we exposed both wild type and Δafrcna strains for  <dig> mm calcium chloride for  <dig> minutes and measured the calcineurin activity in these strains . in the wild type strain, there is about 50% increase in the calcineurin activity when the mycelia was exposed to calcium chloride  <dig> mm for  <dig> minutes . however, in the Δafrcna mutant strain there is a significant increase in the calcineurin activity at  <dig> and  <dig> minutes in the presence of calcium chloride . these results suggest that afrcna has an inhibitory effect on calcineurin activity when a. fumigatus is exposed to high calcium concentrations.

we also investigated how the afrcna deletion would affect the mrna accumulation of the genes observed as modulated by afcrza . thus, we exposed both the wild type and afΔrcna mutant strains to cacl <dig>  <dig> mm for  <dig> and  <dig> minutes and measured the mrna accumulation of these genes . the absence of afrcna has a very heterogeneous influence on the mrna accumulation of these genes. the afrfef  and af aaa atpase  genes have increased mrna accumulation in the absence of afrcna when compared to the wild type strain . in contrast, the a. fumigatus phospholipase d  gene has lower mrna accumulation of  <dig> - and  <dig> -times in the afΔrcna mutant than the wild type strain . the mrna accumulation of the af bar  and afscf <dig>  genes is not affected by the absence of afrcna . these data emphasize the complex influence of afrcna on the calcineurin pathway, both stimulating and inhibiting genes in this pathway.

after several attempts, we were unable to obtain a completely functional a. fumigatus gfp::afrcna and an overexpression alca:afrcna strains . thus, we decided to exploit the conserved features of a. nidulans calcineurin system  and construct both an a. nidulans gfp and an alca::anrcna strain. the a. nidulans anrcna homologue  has about 71% identity and 82%  similarity with the a. fumigatus anrcna . furthermore, to have a more detailed analysis of the a. nidulans anrcna, we also constructed an a. nidulans Δanrcna deletion strain . we evaluated its phenotype by using the same strategies above outlined for the a. fumigatus Δafrcna. the a. nidulans Δanrcna radial diameter is about 25% smaller than the wild type strain . it is also more resistant to cyclosporine a . we have observed that the deletion of a. nidulans anrcna also confers more resistance to an oxidative stressing agent, paraquat at  <dig> mm . interestingly, a. nidulans showed about  <dig>  times more mrna accumulation of the rcna gene when mycelia were exposed to  <dig>  mm menadione compared to mycelia not exposed to it .

the first member identified from the calcipressin family, rcan <dig>  was isolated from the hamster genome as a gene induced during transient adaptation to oxidative stress  <cit> . it was observed that resistance to oxidative stress and calcium stress increased as a function of rcan <dig> expression and decreased as its expression diminished  <cit> . porta et al.  <cit>  have shown that rcan <dig> mrna and protein expression are sensitive to oxidative stress in primary neurons, and that rcan1-/- neurons display an increased resistance to damage by hydrogen peroxide. taken together, our results suggest that aspergilli rcna play a role in calcium and oxidative stress signaling.

next step, we crossed the a. nidulans Δanrcna strain with Δancnaa strain   <cit> . the a. nidulans Δanrcna mutation can partially suppress the Δancnaa growth defect, suggesting a genetic interaction between anrcna and ancnaa . to determine the anrcna cellular localization, we transformed a gfp::anrcna cassette into a wild type strain. several transformants were obtained in which the plasmid had integrated homologously at the anrcna locus . thus, in these strains gfp::anrcna is the only source of protein and gfp::anrcna strains are completely functional, i.e., they displayed cyclosporine a/paraquat-sensitivity comparable to the wild type strain . figure 6d shows gfp::anrcna germlings that were grown for  <dig> hs in mm+2% glycerol at 30°c and either incubated or not in the presence of calcium chloride  <dig> mm or egta  <dig> mm for  <dig> to  <dig> minutes. in all conditions, anrcna was mostly detected along the germling and did not accumulate in the nuclei . the same results were observed when glucose was used as a single carbon source . these results show that anrcna cellular localization is not affected by the cellular response to calcium chloride.

we overexpressed anrcna aiming to investigate genes that could be potentially regulated by the calcipressin-calcineurin pathway. accordingly, we constructed an a. nidulans overexpression anrcna strain by using the alca promoter. we used real-time rt-pcr to test the mrna levels of anrcna when the wild type and alca::anrcna strains were grown in the presence of either glucose or glycerol+ethanol as carbon sources . the anrcna gene showed about the same mrna accumulation when the wild type strain was grown either in the presence of glucose or glycerol+ethanol . however, when the alca::anrcna strain was grown in the presence of glycerol+ethanol, the anrcna gene had a mrna accumulation of about  <dig>  times when compared its growth in the presence of glucose . surprisingly, anrcna overexpression in liquid medium  did not cause any growth inhibition in the presence of either calcium or cyclosporine . anrcna overexpression  also had no effect on the Δancnaa phenotype in liquid medium . next, we observed the effects of overexpressing anrcna on calcineurin activity. interestingly, calcineurin activity is dramatically increased when the wild type strain was grown in the presence of ethanol . in the alca::anrcna strain, calcineurin activity was reduced about 50% , what it is again consistent with a role for aspergilli rcnas in the inhibition of calcineurin activity. both strains display the same calcineurin activity when grown in the presence of glucose . assuming an inhibitory role for anrcna on the calcineurin activity, it should be expected an increase in the calcineurin activity for the alca::anrcna grown in the presence of glucose. however, the lack of reduction in the calcineurin activity is possibly due to the fact that the rcna mrna accumulation was not completely abolished in the alca::anrcna grown in the presence of glucose . overexpression of the yeast protein rcn1p or the human homologues also inhibited the activation of the transcription factor crz1p and the inhibition of the h+/ca2+ exchanger vcx1p  <cit> .

we investigated the effects of anrcna overexpression on the mrna accumulation of the calcium transporters pmca  and pmcb , two a. nidulans pmc <dig> homologues. low and about similar pmca and pmcb mrna accumulation were seen when the wild type and the alca::anrcna mutant strains were grown in the presence of glucose . in contrast, pmca and pmcb levels were about  <dig> and  <dig> times higher the alca::anrcna strain than in the wild type when both strains were grown in the presence of glycerol+ethanol . these results strongly suggest that anrcna can directly or indirectly influence the pmca and pmcb mrna accumulation. thus, it is possible rcna has both stimulatory and inhibitory activity depending on the calcineurin pathway activation by calcium stress.

taken together, these results strongly suggest that:  rcna genes are involved in the oxidative stress and calcium stress in aspergilli,  both ancnaa and anrcna genes showed genetic interactions, and  rcna can modulate calcineurin activity and the mrna accumulation of genes encoding calcium transporters. what is the nature of the interaction between aspergilli cnaa and rcna? these interactions could mean protein-protein interactions, and considering that calcipressin homologues from other species were already shown to interact with calcineurin  <dig>  we investigated the possibility of afrcna to bind afcnaa by using yeast two-hybrid analysis. our results have not revealed any even weak interaction between these two proteins , suggesting that the basis for the interaction is either not related to protein-protein interaction or alternatively there are other proteins or conditions that mediate this interactions that cannot be completely recapitulated by using yeast two-hybrid assays. the Δanrcna mutation suppresses the Δancnaa mutation and suppression of a null allele is expected to be due to downstream mutations that activate the pathway independent of the original  gene product  <cit> . this suppression is essentially visible in terms of the recovery of the colonial growth and increase in the radial diameter of the double mutant . considering the dramatic morphological phenotype of Δancnaa strain, it is possible that besides controlling calcineurin activity, anrcna is also involved in aspergillus development. involvement of calcipressins in development has been previously reported for the drosophila melanogaster sarah mutants  <cit> . eggs laid by sarah mutant females arrest in anaphase of meiosis i and fail to fully polyadenylate and translate bicoid mrna. furthermore, sarah mutant eggs show elevated cyclin b levels, indicating a failure to inactivate m-phase promoting factor . taken together, these results demonstrate that calcium signaling is involved in drosophila egg activation. it remains to be determined the further involvement of anrcna in a. nidulans development.

during the writing of this paper, a complementary study reporting the construction of the Δafrcna mutant in the a. fumigatus strain af <dig> was published   <cit> . these authors observed that deletion of the cbpa gene resulted in reduced hyphal growth and limited attenuated virulence. different from our results, they also observed that the Δcbpa strain showed increased calcium tolerance compared to the wild-type strain. some differences between ours and their results can be credited to a. fumigatus strain differences. however, it is interesting to emphasize the fact that both aspergilli showed some differences in the susceptibilities to manganese and egta  and cyclosporine a . in contrast, those authors have shown that the a. fumigatus af <dig> Δcbpa and wild-type strains displayed an equal sensitivity to the oxidants menadione and hydrogen peroxide, and were also not able to demonstrate a direct protein-protein interaction between a. fumigatus cbpa and afcnaa  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have performed a transcriptional profiling analysis of the a. fumigatus Δafcrza mutant strain exposed to calcium stress. this provided an excellent opportunity to identify genes and pathways that are under the influence of afcrza. we validated the relationship between afcrza and these selected genes by using deletion analysis and by checking through real-time rt-pcr the mrna accumulation of these genes expressed either in the Δafcrza or overexpression strains. afrcna, one of these selected genes, encodes a modulator of calcineurin activity. recently, we demonstrated that contrary to previous findings, the gene encoding the a. nidulans calcineurin catalytic subunit homologue, ancnaa, is not essential and that the ancnaa deletion mutant shares the morphological phenotypes observed in the corresponding a. fumigatus mutant, Δcala  <cit> . thus, we decided once more to exploit the conserved features of a. nidulans calcineurin system and concomitantly with a. fumigatus afrcna molecular analysis, we investigated the a. nidulans anrcna homologue. anrcna showed to interact genetically with ancnaa and be responsible for modulating the calcineurin activity and mrna accumulation of genes encoding calcium transporters.

in summary, our work opens exciting new avenues for research into environmental sensing and nutrient acquisition mediated by the calcineurin-crza pathway in this important human pathogen.
