BACKGROUND
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome  has emerged as one of the most important swine diseases worldwide since its appearance in the late 1980s. prrs virus , the causative agent of prrs, is an enveloped rna virus belonging to the family arteriviridae. the virus genome, like other members of the family  <cit> , contains nine open reading frames  <cit> . prrsv infects macrophages, damages the immune system and causes severe host immune response disorders. this results in prolonged viremia, transiently diminishing t-cell immunity  <cit>  and delayed or low neutralizing antibody response against the envelope glycoprotein  <dig>  and the matrix  protein  <cit> .

the immune network theory proposed by jerne  <cit>  suggests that idiotype  and anti-id interactions control the immune response to an antigen via either positive  or negative  feedback mechanisms  <cit> . our previous studies demonstrated that prrsv infection induced the production of auto-anti-id  specific for antibodies to the gp <dig> and m proteins  <cit> . the pigs produced aab2s during the early stage of infection  cleared the virus, whereas those pigs who had aab2s at the later stage of infection  became virus carriers. these results suggested the presence of aab2s specific for anti-gp <dig> or anti-m antibodies may interfere with the immune responses against prrsv infection.

at present, both live attenuated and inactivated prrsv vaccines cannot provide sustainable disease control  <cit> . the efficacy of prrsv vaccination against prrsv infection may be related to the cellular immune responses induced by vaccination  <cit> . in addition, the live attenuated vaccines have protective value against prrs clinical disorders, but cannot prevent the disease or shorten persistent infection in individual pigs, resulting in long-term circulation of virus within swine herds  <cit>  and the potential to revert to virulence  <cit> .

the inability of current vaccines to provide effective protection against prrsv infection is not fully understood. we hypothesize one of the reasons for this is that prrsv infection induces the production of anti-ids to anti-gp <dig> and when these anti-ids are present, they interfere with the efficacy of the attenuated prrsv vaccine  to protect against highly pathogenic  prrsv infection. to test this hypothesis, piglets free of prrsv were injected with either a monoclonal ab <dig>   <cit>  or aab2s specific to anti-gp <dig> antibody. piglets then received ch-1r and were challenged with the hp-prrsv hun <dig> strain. the results showed that piglets who received mab2-5g <dig> or aab2s and were vaccinated with ch-1r before hp-prrsv infection produced high levels of serum il- <dig> and il- <dig>  after infection, these animals showed obvious clinical signs of wheezing, anhelation, severe lethargy, anorexia, purulent secretion and emaciation. additionally there were signs of depletion of cortical thymocytes or severe thymus atrophy with decreased production of il- <dig>  low levels of neutralizing antibodies and a high level of viremia at the early stage of infection. these results suggested that ab2s specific for anti-prrsv gp <dig> antibody interfere with the immune responses against the attenuated prrsv vaccine ch-1r. further study is needed to identify, at the molecular and cellular levels, the roles of the idiotype network in prrsv immunity.

RESULTS
clinical presentation
no piglets showed clinical signs before hp-prrsv challenge, consistent with their disease free status. after the challenge with hp-prrsv, group  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> piglets showed wheezing and anhelation from  <dig> to  <dig> dpc with the average scores of  <dig>  to  <dig>  . severe lethargy, anorexia and emaciation were observed from  <dig> to  <dig> dpc and purulent secretion from the nose between  <dig> to  <dig> dpc. one piglet from group  <dig> and one piglet from group  <dig> died naturally from prrs at  <dig> dpc and  <dig> dpc, respectively. group  <dig> and  <dig> piglets showed transient anhelation from  <dig> to  <dig> dpc with average scores of  <dig>  to  <dig>   without other obvious clinical signs and piglets in group  <dig> had no clinical signs.

a,bvalues with different superscripts were significantly different .

the average rectal temperature of group  <dig> and  <dig> piglets was similar, with the highest temperature of  <dig> °c between  <dig> and  <dig> dpc . the temperature remained above  <dig> °c to the end of the experiment. the rectal temperature of group  <dig> and  <dig> piglets started to rise from  <dig> dpc and returned to normal from  <dig> dpc to the end of the experiment. the rectal temperature of group  <dig> piglets remained above 40°c from  <dig> to  <dig> dpc and dropped below  <dig> °c from  <dig> dpc to the end of the experiment. group  <dig> piglets had a normal rectal temperature.

visual and histological observations
severe thymus atrophy was observed for group  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> piglets on  <dig> dpc  and  <dig> dpc . one piglet from group  <dig> and one from group  <dig> died naturally from prrs on  <dig> dpc and  <dig> dpc, respectively, accompanied with severe thymus atrophy . the thymus atrophy of piglets infected with hp-prrsv was similar to that observed in the previously reported study  <cit> . thymus atrophy of group  <dig>  and group  <dig>  piglets was weaker than that of group  <dig> and  <dig> piglets on  <dig> dpc, and the thymuses of group  <dig> piglets were normal .

thymuses collected on  <dig> dpc from group  <dig> piglets showed typical depletion of cortical thymocytes accompanied by blurred boundaries between the thymus cortex and medulla as indicated by histology . similar microscopic lesions were seen in the thymuses of group  <dig> and  <dig> piglets . group  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> piglets showed no microscopic lesions of the thymus . interstitial pneumonia lesions were observed in group  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> piglets on  <dig> dpc . the lung tissues from group  <dig> and  <dig> piglets were widened slightly on  <dig> dpc , and that from group  <dig> piglets were normal .

viremia
viremia of piglets from groups 1– <dig> was detected starting on  <dig> dpc . the amount of virus was significantly higher in group  <dig> and  <dig> piglets who received mab2-5g <dig> and aab2s, respectively, than that in piglets from other groups. the highest amount of virus present in the sera of group  <dig> and  <dig> piglets was on  <dig> dpc with a mean titer of  <dig>  copies/ml and  <dig>  copies/ml, respectively, and this started to decline from  <dig> dpc but remained detectable at  <dig> dpc. viremia in group  <dig> and  <dig> piglets peaked on  <dig> dpc with a mean titer of  <dig>  copies/ml and  <dig>  copies/ml, respectively, which were significantly lower  than that from group  <dig> and  <dig> piglets, and became undetectable on  <dig> dpc. the amount of virus in group  <dig> piglets on  <dig> dpc was significantly lower than that from group 1and  <dig> piglets and the highest amount of virus was detected at  <dig> dpc with the mean titer of  <dig>  copies/ml, which dropped to  <dig>  copies/ml on  <dig> dpc. these values were significantly higher  than those from group  <dig> and  <dig> piglets and remained detectable on  <dig> dpc similar to values from group  <dig> and  <dig> piglets . no virus was detected in group  <dig> piglets.

serum concentrations of cytokines
the concentrations of ifn-γ, il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> were determined for all serum samples . the serum concentrations of ifn-γ for group 1– <dig> and group  <dig> piglets were about 45 pg/ml in average for all serum samples, whereas the levels of ifn-γ from group  <dig> piglets started to rise on  <dig> dpc and increased significantly  on  <dig> dpc  .

the mean serum il- <dig> concentration from piglets in group  <dig> and  <dig> was about 540 pg/ml and 460 pg/ml on  <dig> dpi and  <dig> dpc , respectively. these were significantly higher  than those obtained from the other four groups of piglets with an average of 245 pg/ml for all samples .

the level of il- <dig> in sera from group  <dig> and  <dig> piglets peaked on  <dig> dpi or  <dig> dpc with the average of 200 pg/ml and then declined to the base levels on  <dig> dpc . in contrast, the level of il- <dig> in serum from group  <dig> and  <dig> piglets started to rise on  <dig> dpc, peaked on  <dig> dpc with an average of 220 pg/ml and then declined gradually. the il- <dig> concentrations from group  <dig> piglets were less than 110 pg/ml for all serum samples.

for the levels of serum il- <dig>  group  <dig> piglets showed the increased levels of approximately 220 pg/ml on 7dpc, peaked with 374 pg/ml on  <dig> dpc and then declined gradually, but remained more than 200 pg/ml to  <dig> dpc . the il- <dig> concentrations from all serum samples of group 1– <dig> and group  <dig> piglets were less than 130 pg/ml .

serum anti-prrsv antibodies
anti-prrsv antibodies from all piglets were detected in sequential serum samples collected from  <dig> dpi to  <dig> dpc. the results of anti-n antibodies measured by idexx elisa were shown in figure 5a. piglets in groups  <dig> to  <dig> seroconverted as early as  <dig> dpi  with an average s/p value of about  <dig>  and rose quickly after hp-prrsv challenge. in contrast, piglets in group  <dig> seroconverted on  <dig> dpc with the average s/p value of  <dig>  and peaked on  <dig> dpc . group  <dig> piglets had no detectable anti-n antibodies.

as shown in figure 5b, serum anti-gp2/gp <dig> antibodies from group  <dig> and  <dig> piglets were detected on  <dig> dpc with the irpc value of ≥ <dig> and gradually increased to a peak on  <dig> dpc with the irpc value of  <dig>  similarly, piglets from groups  <dig> and  <dig> also seroconverted on  <dig> dpc and gradually increased with the higher irpc values on each dpc than that from group  <dig> and  <dig> piglets and reached a peak on  <dig> dpc with the irpc value of  <dig>  in contrast, group  <dig> piglets seroconverted on  <dig> dpc with the irpc value of  <dig> and peaked on  <dig> dpc . serum anti-gp2/gp <dig> antibodies in group  <dig> piglets were negative.

neutralizing antibodies
serum neutralizing antibodies against hp-prrsv hun <dig> strain were detected using a vn assay. as shown in table  <dig>  the neutralizing antibodies were detected in group  <dig> and  <dig> piglets starting at  <dig> dpi with an average titer of  <dig>  and peaked by  <dig> dpc. group  <dig> and  <dig> piglets did not produce detectable neutralizing antibodies until  <dig> dpis, and gradually increased to the peak on  <dig> dpc. neutralizing antibodies from group  <dig> piglets were detected from  <dig> dpc.

discussion
this report describes that the presence of monoclonal anti-id   <cit>  or aab2s  <cit>  specific for anti-gp <dig> antibody interfered with the prrsv attenuated vaccine, ch-1r, against hp-prrsv infection. the ability of ch-1r to provide effective protection against a hp-prrsv infection has been demonstrated in our previous study  <cit> , in which, ch-1r immunization decreased and increased the serum level of il- <dig> and il- <dig>  respectively, along with the increased animal’s health status. the results indicated that administration of mab2-5g <dig> or aab2s, to reproduce what would occur in a pig if it had been infected with prrsv before vaccination, markedly reduced the ability of ch-1r in providing subsequent protection against hp-prrsv infection. the selected amount of mab2-5g <dig> or aab2s was based on the measurement of aab2s from pig sera  which represented the amounts that would be generated if they were naturally infected with prrsv.

hp-prrsv infection alone induced severe thymus atrophy as demonstrated in previous findings  <cit> . in this study, piglets which received mab2-5g <dig> or aab2s and vaccination, also showed severe thymus atrophy after hp-prrsv challenge . these findings indicated that presence of mab2-5g <dig> or aab2s prevents the efficacy of the ch-1r against hp-prrsv-induced thymus atrophy attributable to the thymocytes apoptosis  <cit> . prrsv infection induces cell apoptosis and this is related to the activity of the gp <dig> protein  <cit> . since mab2-5g <dig> and aab2s were specific for anti-gp <dig> antibodies, they may act in concert with gp <dig> protein to induce apoptosis in thymocytes.

swine possess the full repertoire of innate and adaptive immune responses to viral pathogens, but the response to prrsv deviates from this model  <cit> . in general, th <dig> responses are associated with ifn-γ and il- <dig> production, which are correlated with the induction of cell-mediated immunity. prrsv infection alone can induce high levels of ifn-γ as shown in this  and previous studies  <cit> . in the current study, piglets which received the vaccination did not produce high levels of ifn-γ after hp-prrsv challenge , indicating that the ch-1r down-regulated ifn-γ expression which was not affected by mab2-5g <dig> or aab2s . the down-regulated ifn-γ expression by ch-1r and the high level of expression induced by hp-prrsv infection showed that the ifn-γ mediated cell immune response were not capable of eliminating hp-prrsv. at present, the role of ifn-γ in the immune response to ch-1r and hp-prrsv infection is not clear and warrants further investigation.

administration of mab2-5g <dig> or aab2s induced high concentrations of serum il- <dig> on  <dig> dpi and  <dig> dpc before hp-prrsv challenge . however, piglets challenged with hp-prrsv alone or who received ch-1r did not produce il- <dig>  which is consistent with other studies of prrsv infection  <cit> . il- <dig> is related to the th <dig> responses and used to evaluate candidate vaccines to prrsv and other viruses  <cit> . il- <dig> is also necessary during t cell development in the thymus for the maturation of regulatory t cells . after exiting from the thymus, t-regs prevent other t cells from recognizing and reacting against “self antigens”  <cit> . at present, the role of il- <dig> in prrsv infection was unknown. the poor health status of piglets in group  <dig> and  <dig> who received mab2-5g <dig> or aab2s showed a high level of il- <dig> before and after hp-prrsv challenge  and may have a negative effect on the immune responses against hp-prrsv infection.

il- <dig> is a key regulator in humoral and adaptive immunity in association with the down-regulation of th <dig> cell responses and promotion of th <dig> cell development  <cit> . in this study, changes of serum il- <dig> concentrations at different times corresponded to the difference of the animals’ health status after hp-prrsv challenge . these findings suggested that at the beginning of the hp-prrsv challenge, il- <dig> down-regulates the inflammatory response and promotes prrsv replication . this may have increased the pathogenicity of prrsv by down-regulating cellular immunity and thus reduces the ability of the attenuated vaccine to protect the pigs against prrsv infection. however, later after the hp-prrsv challenge, high serum concentrations of il- <dig> are needed for the development of the adaptive immunity against prrsv infection, enhancement of the immune stages and production of antibodies .

functional studies on il- <dig> suggest that it has immunosuppressive properties and can prevent the development of th1-mediated autoimmune diseases  <cit> . some viruses, including prrsv, can induce il- <dig> production to inhibit the host immune response and hamper the process of virus clearance  <cit> . in our study, piglets challenged with hp-prrsv alone developed high levels of il- <dig> , which indicated that il- <dig> also inhibits the cell-mediated immunity and keeps the longer duration of viremia in hp-prrsv infection.

the animals that received control antibodies and ch-1r produced higher levels of anti-gp2/gp <dig> antibodies than those that received mab2-5g <dig> or aab <dig> . however, the time of onset and levels of neutralizing antibodies produced in these animals were different  in which the piglets received mab2-5g <dig> or aab <dig> produced neutralizing antibodies at early  stage with low levels even after the hp-prrsv challenge. the presence of the low levels of neutralizing antibodies  before the hp-prrsv challenge may be responsible for the antibody-dependent enhancement  <cit>  leading to poor health status with pneumonia and thymus atrophy .

CONCLUSIONS
when the anti-idiotypic antibodies specific for anti-prrsv gp <dig> antibodies are present, the use of attenuated prrsv vaccine ch-1r against hp-prrsv infection is not recommended. it can result in the altered production of cytokines, low levels of neutralizing antibodies and the poor health status with pneumonia and thymus atrophy.
