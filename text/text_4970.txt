BACKGROUND
feedback control mechanisms are vital to the robust functioning of gene regulatory and metabolic pathways. they have been extensively researched over the last two decades: we now know more about the topology and functionality of positive and negative feedback in intra- and inter-cellular systems than ever before  <cit> . for example, positive feedback is essential for the existence of multiple steady states within multi-scale gene regulatory systems  <cit>  and to help prolong and amplify the response to weak signals in intracellular signalling  <cit> . operating synchronously, negative feedback is found to help  stabilize and maintain the concentration of gene products,  maintain the homeostasis of gene expression rates  <cit> ,  improve the robustness of developing cells  <cit> , and  facilitate the sustaining of oscillations of gene transcription rate  <cit> . many examples of negative feedback systems exist:  regulatory pathways: the main repressor of the sos regulon in bacteria escherichia coli, lexa, represses its own production  <cit> ; the hes <dig> oscillator represses its own transcription  <cit> ; the p53-mdm <dig> network with p <dig> activates the mdm <dig> gene and mdm <dig> sequesters p <dig>  <cit> ; and the tryptophan operon system with multiple negative feedback regulations  <cit> ;  metabolic pathways: in the linear mandelate-acetate pathway in pseudomonas fluorescens the acetate represses seven preceding reactions  <cit> ; and,  signaling pathways: the nf-kb signalling pathway in which nuclear nf-kb activates production of ikbα which in turn inhibits nuclear import of nf-kb by sequestering it in the cytoplasm  <cit> ; and circadian clocks  <cit> . these feedback loops orchestrate the molecular fluxes in multi-scale manner so that the organisms survive and thrive in many different environments.

early work on negative feedback in gene regulatory systems goes back to that of goodwin  <cit>  who proposed an auto-repressive transcriptional model with inhibition imposed by the gene's own protein product. this initial model has provided a useful framework for later studies of systems involving negative feedback regulation  <cit> . in addition, a number of goodwin-based models of biological oscillators characterised by one or more negative feedback loops have recently been developed, for example of the circadian clocks  <cit> . nevertheless, our understanding of the dynamic nature of negative feedback regulation is still limited in many aspects. first, the mere presence of a negative feedback loop within a system is insufficient to understand its dynamical behaviour  <cit> . in fact, negative feedback is found to promote both system stability and oscillatory instability; the same feedback, if it is "loose", it may support stability, and if tighter, it may give rise to sustained oscillations  <cit> . therefore, to gain deeper insights into the dynamical behaviours of biologically regulated systems, it is necessary for us to understand and characterize the differences among the feedback loops that influence system dynamics by systematically studying the different types of negative feedback loops that occur in these systems.

two important factors that can be used to characterise a negative feedback loop are the feedback strength and level of binding cooperativity  between an inhibitor and its regulated molecule  <cit> . in this paper we investigate the effects of these factors on system dynamics. earlier work has only looked at the effects of changes in the cooperativity levels, but not those of feedback strength  <cit> . to coordinate complex and rich interactions within the cell, cellular systems often consist of not just one negative feedback loop, but multiple ones, entangled together. what are the functional advantages of the coupled feedback loops which evolved within the host systems? although attempts have been made – e.g. the interplay between positive and negative feedback regulation have been shown to provide robustness and reliability to system performance  <cit>  – the studies on how the coupled loops affect the molecular dynamics have been very limited. we therefore aim to explore in this paper the dynamical aspects of systems with multiple negative feedback loops in comparison with their single-loop counterparts to understand the possible functional advantages the extra loops may provide.

we consider a commonly encountered motif of the negative feedback systems in which negative feedback is imposed by the last species of the system pathway on the upstream species. we develop mathematical models to analyze for stability and bifurcation, in order to study the behaviour of these systems, confining ourselves to the analytical solutions which allow us to obtain bifurcation points dependent on the feedback strengths and nonlinearity as the parameters. based on these results, the conditions on the feedback strength or nonlinearity for: no stability; no oscillation; stability enhancement; oscillation enhancement; and guaranteed stability  can be established. our analyses will lead to regimes in the parameter space in which different dynamical behaviours can be identified. in contrast to numerical methods, analytical methods facilitate an analysis of the parameter sensitivities of the system dynamics.

for clarification, here we define the meanings of robustness and stability used in this paper. robustness is referred to as the ability of a system to maintain its functionality against internal perturbations and environmental variations. stability, on the other hand, is only concerned with the ability to maintain the system state. although both are important properties of living systems, robustness is a broader concept than stability, with the emphasis on system functionality rather than system state  <cit> . a system can preserve its function amid perturbations by actively switching between different  states  <cit> . in this study, we focused on the stability aspect of systems.

the remaining structure of this paper is given as follows: the methods section discusses hill function and its use for negative feedback modelling, followed by a description of the regulatory motifs studied in the current paper and their mathematical models. the analytical methods developed for stability and bifurcation analyses are outlined in the last subsection. detailed analyses along with discussion of pertinent results are presented in the section results and discussion. in the section biological examples, we analyze the hes <dig> oscillator in vertebrates and the tryptophan operon system in bacteria escherichia coli as examples. finally, we end the paper with the summary and conclusion section.

methods
modelling negative feedbacks – hill function
in modelling biochemical systems, the rate of a reaction representing concentration change per unit time can be written as a function of the concentrations of reactants and products. there exist a number of rate laws corresponding to different types of reaction mechanisms: the mass action rate law, the michaelis-menten kinetics, and the hill functions  <cit> . the level of inhibition caused by negative feedback loop due to product x can be described by the hill function of the following form :

  

where the parameter ki represents the half-saturation constant . it is also commonly referred to as the dissociation constant or binding constant. the parameter n  is related to the cooperativity level of the chemical process.

the strength of feedback is inversely proportional to ki: increasing ki lowers the repression level while decreasing ki increases the repression for a given n; therefore we may define fs = 1/k as feedback strength ; and refer to k as the inverse feedback strength indicator. the hill coefficient n can be interpreted as the sensitivity of the feedback loop. as n becomes larger, the hill curve becomes more sensitive to change in x in the vicinity of x <dig>  and acts like an on-off switch. when n is very large , the hill function resembles the step function .

in gene regulatory networks, change in fs could be brought about in a number of ways:  by mutations that alter the dna sequence of the binding site of x in the inhibited molecular species' promoter – even alternation of a single dna base can strengthen or weaken the chemical bonds between x and the dna – which will subsequently change fs;  by change of binding site position within the dna. the hill coefficient can be changed, for example, by mutations that alter number of binding sites within the dna. it has been experimentally shown for bacteria that they can accurately tune these parameters within only several hundred generations for optimal performance when faced with environmental change  <cit> .

regulatory motifs and models
our model motifs consist of generic pathways of activation steps  with arbitrary lengths with single or coupled negative feedback loops imposed by the end-product of the pathway. figure  <dig> shows the schematic diagrams of a few example motifs. we denote a general l-species system with length l by ll; while a system having single feedback loop on the step k is denoted by  . the system with the coupled loops on the steps k <dig>  k <dig> .., kj is denoted by .

a model system can be described by using a set of l differential equations as follows,

  

where xj, kj, kdj  represent the concentration of species xj, its synthesis rate, and its degradation rate, respectively. and,

 if feedback loop is present while

h =  <dig> if no feedback loop is present for the jth step.

the first species of the pathways x <dig> is often assumed to be static, i.e. its concentration is unchanged. in most cases, it represents the gene which is the source of the pathway and activates the whole sequence of reactions. however, we also consider the cases when x <dig> is variable by studying the variants of system ll with shorter lengths. the degradation process of model species is assumed to follow first-order kinetics. degradation parameter kdj is actually an aggregated rate combining transport  and decay rate of corresponding species. the goodwin oscillator is a special case and represented by system . we do not consider time delay in these models; readers who are interested in this aspect are referred to the work of macdonald  <cit> .

despite their simplicity, these models can readily be used to model real biological systems. for instance, a generic model with three variables can be interpreted as follows: the first equation as the synthesis of nucleic mrna, the second equation describing transportation of mrna to the cytoplasm, while the last equation explains translation of mrna into protein. extended four-variable system can be interpreted by including a fourth equation describing transportation of protein back to the nucleus.

we first analyse the single-loop systems with three and four variables. the coupled-loops systems are examined next. we then study the generalised, extended systems with arbitrary pathway lengths.

analysis methodology
biological systems display many types of dynamic behaviours including stable steady state, sustained oscillations, and irregular fluctuating dynamics . change of system parameters may lead to change of system dynamics. bifurcation analysis allows one to subdivide the parameter space into qualitatively different regions within each, the system dynamics are homogeneous. furthermore, the changes in the size and location of resulting regions due to parameters variation can be investigated.

a summary of stability analysis and the routh-hurwitz theorem
the stability analysis of a system consisting of a set of differential equations can be conducted by considering its dynamical behaviour in the neighbourhood of its equilibrium  state. a steady state is classified locally stable if the system returns to this steady state after a sufficiently small but arbitrary perturbation. local stability of a steady state can be analysed by linearising the differential equations around the steady state and assessing the eigenvalues of the resulting jacobian matrix   <cit> . for a system of differential equations

  

if the real parts of all j's eigenvalues are negative, the steady state is said to be stable, while if any of the real parts are positive, the steady state is unstable .

because j's eigenvalues are actually the roots of the following characteristic equation

  

- αis are the coefficients – to assess the signs of j' eigenvalues, we make use of the routh-hurwitz theorem  <cit>  which states that eigenvalues λ all have negative real parts if

  

where

  

bifurcation – a geometrically motivated approach
our aim is to establish analytical bifurcation points for the feedback strengths, hill coefficients, and other model parameters of single-loop as well as multiple-loop systems. system stability conditions are first formulated using the routh-hurwitz stability criteria outlined above. these conditions are then examined using a geometrically-motivated approach. we demonstrate the method below using a system with length  <dig>  longer pathway systems are similarly analysed. consider the case where all three loops are present , and the equations for this system are:

   

denote the equilibrium values of the state variables xi, . steady-state  values of the system variables can be determined by setting the right hand sides of  to zeros. this subsequently gives 

   

where

  

in this case, the characteristic polynomial is cubic

  

following the routh-hurwitz theorem, the system is stable if and only if the following stability condition  is satisfied:

   

it is convenient to introduce the following composite variables

   

variables m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig> interestingly have the characteristics of activation functions. working with m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig> is more straightforward than with x <dig>  x <dig> and x <dig> directly as it spares one from having to deal with the exponential and rational forms in . we also have  <dig> <m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig> <  <dig>  the equilibrium condition  is now simplified to

   

equations  also allow the characteristic coefficients α <dig>  α <dig> and α <dig> to be expressed in terms of only m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig> and other model parameters, i.e. the synthetic and degradation rates  below for example). particularly, the conditions  and  for simpler system motifs with less feedback loops can be easily derived. for example, setting mi =  <dig> for some index i gives rise to a system structure lacking the corresponding feedback loop, e.g. m <dig> =  <dig> gives , m <dig> = m <dig> =  <dig> gives . equations  lead to:

   

combined with  and , each of m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> can be expressed as functions of the others involving only kis and nis. for example, assume m <dig> =  <dig> for simplicity , we have

  

here, m <dig> is a strictly decreasing function of m <dig> over . substitute this into , we obtain:

   

as a function of k <dig> and m <dig>  moreover, k <dig> is strictly increasing with m <dig> since the derivatives with respect to m <dig> of the terms inside the brackets in  are positive over  .

this means if there exist bounds m2l, m2h ) such that m2l ≤ m <dig> ≤ m2h, then the stability condition  would be equivalent to

   

condition  represents an analytical relationship between the feedback strength indicators k <dig> and k <dig> of the loops in action, and f <dig> and f <dig> are the bifurcation points of k <dig> 

to determine the bounds m2l and m2h, note that  can be manipulated to take the form

  

where g is a function whose explicit form depends on the particular system motif. for system  we have

   

because α <dig>  α <dig>  α <dig> >  <dig>   is equivalent to α1α <dig> - α <dig> >  <dig>  substituting  into this relation we obtain

   

where f = m <dig> and , with coefficients a <dig>  a <dig> and b <dig> are expressions of the system parameters and given in the supplementary material .

note that  is to take different forms depending on specific motifs of feedback loops. next, we analyse the inequality  for the system  using a geometrical approach in which the curves f and g are drawn on the two dimensional m1-m <dig> coordinate plane . f is a strictly decreasing curve contained within the unit square u = {; ; ; } , g is a straight line with a positive slope. as  <dig> <m <dig>  m <dig> <  <dig>  the analysis is constrained within u only. range of m <dig> satisfying  can be determined along with its lower and upper bounds m2l and m2h, illustrated in figure 4a.

RESULTS
single-loop systems
because two-species systems are incapable of demonstrating oscillatory dynamics, we only consider systems with three species or more. here, we present the results for the systems with a single feedback loop. to this end, the three-species systems are first considered. we then examine the four-species systems and investigate potential effects on system functional dynamics as a result of lengthening the pathways.

three-species systems
three negative feedback motifs are possible for the three-species system where the feedback loop is imposed on the first, second, and the last step of the pathway. these are denoted ,  and  and schematically demonstrated in figure 3a, b, and 3c, respectively. we found that systems  and  are both incapable of having oscillatory dynamics, regardless of their parameter values. system , essentially the goodwin system of length three, possesses both stable and oscillatory dynamics. switching between these dynamical regimes occurs through a hopf bifurcation. we present below the analytical condition governing this bifurcation.

the system is stable if and only if the following condition is satisfied :

   

where

   

k <dig> versus n1
manipulating the inequality  yields an equivalent condition between the inverse feedback strength indicator k <dig> versus the hill coefficient n <dig> and the remaining model parameters , given below

   

where

   

this shows, given other model parameters' values, the existence of a threshold feedback strength  at which the system loses stability to an oscillatory regime. based on , two-parameter bifurcation diagrams of k <dig> against other model parameters can be set up. figure 5a illustrates on the k <dig> vs. n <dig> plane, regions of stable and oscillatory dynamics, separated by the k1thresh curve.

to obtain oscillatory behaviour, the feedback loop must be sufficiently strong . furthermore, k1thresh saturates at high n <dig> which indicates that there exists a critical value of k <dig> or feedback strength above which, the system is guaranteed to have sustained oscillations regardless of the value of the hill coefficient n <dig> . denote this critical value k1crit, we found that k1crit = 1/a, which is the product of the system synthesis rates divided by the product of the system degradation rates . figure 5a further shows that higher cooperativity level improves the likelihood to observe oscillation, since oscillation is obtained over a wider range of k <dig>  i.e. lower n <dig> provides more stability. however, this improvement diminishes at high cooperativity level due to the saturation behaviour of k1thresh.

parameter's "ranges of guaranteed stability"
here, we define the ranges of guaranteed stability  of a model parameter p with respect to model parameter q as all possible values of p that always give a stable system dynamics, subjected to arbitrary variation in q. for instance, as shown above, k <dig> > 1/a or  is the rgs of k <dig> with respect to n <dig> 

because m <dig> <  <dig>  equation  means that the system is always stable if n <dig> ≤ b. this threshold value depends on the degradation rates only. it also yields the rgs of n <dig> to equal . more interestingly, raising the production rate of any species results in an exactly same k1thresh curve as raising the production rate of any other species by the same proportion. bifurcation patterns are therefore conserved under these different changes. this knowledge is potentially useful in many cases. for example, it can facilitate the engineering of synthetic circuits with desirable dynamical behaviour; as one could effectively choose appropriate points to perturb to attain desired dynamical behaviours. it can also help in the process of parameter estimation and optimisation of synthetic circuits.

the degradation rates, on the other hand, have opposite effect on system dynamics. higher degradation rates tend to reduce k1thresh, leading to smaller oscillatory region  and consequently a more stable system. system stability, therefore, is most likely when model species are rapidly degraded. this is because at large kdj, rapid degradations of the state species significantly weaken the strength of the negative feedback loop that is required for oscillations. in contrast, very slow degradation makes it almost impossible for the system to obtain stability, unless the feedback loop is greatly relaxed with significantly weak inhibition strength .

in examining parameter effects on the threshold value of the hill coefficient , our analysis reveals that comparable degradation rates across model species  leads to minimum b and thus minimum rgs for n1; whereas if one is many folds greater than another , b will be high, resulting in a large rgs . this suggests a way to enhance system stability by unbalancing the degradation rates of molecular species, preferably, towards higher values. figure 5c compares the bifurcation profiles between a reference parameter set and one with equally low degradation rates; and one with unequal, enhanced degradation rates.

four-species systems
these systems can be considered extension of the previous models, which consist of four species. there are a total of four feedback motifs for single-loop systems. similar to  and , systems  and  are found to be incapable of producing oscillations. here, we consider  and  in turn .

interestingly for , our analysis arrives at the same bifurcation points for n <dig> and k <dig> as in  and , however with different expressions of a and b:

   

   

we found that b ≥  <dig> for arbitrary values of the degradation rates. compared with the three-species system, n1's rgs is reduced, supposedly due to the lengthening of system pathway. furthermore, for n <dig> >  <dig> the system is capable of displaying sustained oscillation for an indefinite number of parameter sets, given a proper selection .

let us now consider system , a variant of the single-loop goodwin system where inhibition is imposed by the end-product on the second rather than the first step of the pathway . at first glance, this system design looks like its counterpart . however, there is a fundamental difference in the synthesis of the repressed variables between the two systems. the synthetic term for x <dig> in  contains x <dig> which changes dynamically, having its rate of change defined by the first model equation in figure 3i; whereas the synthetic term for x <dig> in  does not contain a varying variable;  can thus be considered as a special case of  by setting kd <dig> =  <dig> in figure 3i. this difference might give rise to distinct dynamical behaviours between the two systems. here, we analyse 's bifurcation to identify and investigate possible behavioural discrepancies compared to .

for system , the analytical bifurcation point for feedback strength k <dig> is

  

where a has the form of  while b is reduced to resemble that of the three-species system  in equation ,

   

generalised single-loop systems
minimum hill coefficient for sustained oscillation
in fact, for the single-loop goodwin system with arbitrary length l, the minimum hill coefficient required for sustained oscillations has been theoretically computed to be

  

although this calculation is done under the stringent assumption of equal degradation rates kd <dig> = kd <dig> =...= kdl  <cit> .

effects of system extension
comparative study of the systems  and  allows us to examine dynamical effects resulting from system extension . we found that the extended system with more species is not always more stable. in fact, whether the extended system is more stable or more prone to oscillation is determined by the kinetics  of the added species.

if we denote k1crit the critical k <dig> value of system l,  and  then give

   

equation  indicates that if the additional species is more quickly degraded than produced , k1crit will be reduced for the extended system. on the other hand, k1crit for  is raised if k <dig> > kd <dig> and unchanged if k <dig> = kd <dig>  also, note that if kd <dig> is small  relative to other degradation rates, n1crit for the extended system becomes greater   and ).

generalisation of feedback strength and hill coefficient
the equation defining the threshold feedback strength for the systems ,  and  can be extended by induction to a system with an arbitrary number of reaction steps. the threshold feedback strength of the goodwin system with the general length l , for example, can be expressed as in equation  with a's generalised form below,

   

and b is a function of only the degradation rates kd <dig>  kd <dig> ..., kdl. b was found for the systems with length  <dig> and  <dig> to be neat expressions of the degradation rates. however, for the system with  <dig> variables or more, b becomes complex but can be derived explicitly. moreover, b reaches its minimum when all degradation rates are equal, at which b = 1/cosl. in addition, the generalised critical value of the feedback strength is a. a system with feedback strength weaker than this value is guaranteed a stable dynamics independent of the hill coefficient values.

equation  shows that the threshold hill coefficient of  only depends on the degradation rates of the inhibited species and its downstream molecules; and is independent of the upstream species. more interestingly, equations  and  show that  and  share the same analytical form for b. further generalisations, therefore, can be made for variants of the general goodwin systems: the systems with single negative feedback loop in which any step in the biochemical pathway can be potentially inhibited by the end-product . the threshold kkthresh of  is

   

where a is retained its form as in  whereas b involves only the degradation rates of downstream species of the repressive targeted species xk.

more importantly, b has similar form as that of the reduced goodwin system  . we confirmed these generalised analytical equations using numerical computations as well in which we estimate kkthesh for variant systems  and found that they fit the theoretical form given by .

effects of feedback loop reallocation
the generalised findings above have important implications concerning the dynamical behaviour of feedback systems. comparing  and  reveals that reallocation of the negative feedback loop has no effect on the critical feedback strength . regardless of the loop's position, the system's stability is ensured if the feedback strength is weaker than this value.

however, loop reallocation may or may not make the system more stable. this is because the threshold hill coefficient values b in  and  are different. the ratios of b for  and  based on equations  and  is given by

  

for simplification, let kd <dig> = kd <dig> = kd <dig> =  <dig>  we observe that b() >> b() when kd <dig> << 1; b() <b() when kd <dig> ≈  <dig> but b() approaches b() when kd <dig> >>  <dig>  this means b could become either larger or smaller depending on the relative magnitude of kd <dig> compared to kd <dig>  kd <dig>  kd <dig>  consequently, the oscillatory region on the two-dimensional bifurcation diagram k <dig> vs. n <dig> could either shrink or expand due to loop reallocation.

non-oscillatory systems
because the systems with less than three species are not able to display oscillatory dynamics, the generalised results obtained in the previous section indicate that for the systems with arbitrary length which possess a single loop inhibiting either the last step or second-last step of the pathways , oscillatory dynamics is also not feasible. this conclusion is in line with analytical results obtained for the systems , , ,  previously.

we will show in the next section that, adding extra inhibition loops tends to make the system less likely to demonstrate sustained oscillations. this implies that any system with multiple negative feedback loops encompassing one imposing on either the last or second last step  is also incapable of having oscillatory dynamics .

coupled-loop systems
let us consider systems with increased complexity in which several negative feedback loops are coupled together. understanding of composite behaviour of coupled loops has been limited. we aim to establish meaningful connections between the feedback strength of these loops  under certain conditions.

three-species, doubled-loop system 
detailed analysis for this system was presented in section "analysis methodology" as an example . the stability condition  is ensured if g intersect the m1-axis at a point above point , indicated by a dot in figure 4a. this translates a <dig> ≥ b <dig> or n <dig> ≤ b with b as in . compared to the results from the previous section of the three-species, single-loop system, we found that adding a second feedback loop does not affect the rgs of n <dig>  on the other hand, if n <dig> > b, the line g must intersect f within the unit square u and so condition  is violated for some m <dig>  subsequently destabilising the system .

k1-k <dig> bifurcation diagram
range of m <dig> satisfying  can be determined, indicated by its lower bound m2l and higher bound m2h in figure 4a. for each value of k <dig>  we obtain corresponding values for m2l and m2h. using , we construct the two-parameter bifurcation diagram with the feedback strength indicators k <dig> and k <dig> being the axes.

note that in this case, there exists at most one  intersection point between f and g within u, indicating a simple binary separation of the k1-k <dig> bifurcation diagram into stable and oscillatory regions. a typical k1-k <dig> bifurcation profile for  is illustrated in figure 9a. we refer to the feedback loop involving k <dig> and k <dig> as loop l <dig> and l <dig>  respectively.

as loop l <dig> is relaxed , sustained oscillation becomes more difficult to obtain at stronger l <dig> . stability is most likely under weak l <dig> coupled with strong l <dig>  oscillations, on the other hand, are most likely at weak l <dig> coupled with strong l1; shifting system dynamics to being stable at strong l <dig>  however, requires l <dig> to be very strong too. dynamical behaviours are summarised in table  <dig> based on combinations of the individual loop's strength.

k1's critical value
the critical k1crit mentioned above was found to have the exact same expression as the kt1hresh in 

  

note that k1crit is independent of l2's specification, whereas it increases with n <dig>  as a result, higher n <dig> enhances oscillatory behaviour due to the expansion of the oscillatory region. increase n <dig> therefore enables oscillatory exhibition at weaker l <dig> . moreover, we found that increasing n <dig> does also expand the oscillatory region , enabling oscillatory exhibition at stronger l <dig>  therefore, for a coupled-loop system, raising the hill coefficient of any loop tends to enhance oscillatory behaviour.

effects of turnover parameters
the above equation indicates that k1crit increases proportionally with the synthesis rates. this causes the oscillation region to approximately increase by the corresponding proportion. oscillatory dynamics is now achievable at higher k <dig> given fixed k <dig> . on the other hand, comparable degradation rates  leads to low b  and as a result raises k1crit. particularly, k1crit is maximised when this comparable rate is minimised. whereas, if these parameters are different by many folds, k1crit is small and so is the corresponding oscillatory region. figure 10b compares three scenarios in this case. the parameter set with kd <dig> = kd <dig> = kd <dig> =  <dig>  obtains the largest oscillatory region while setting kd <dig> = 4kd <dig> has it significantly diminished.

three-species, doubled-loop system 
an alternative doubled-loop system is considered here in which the first and the last pathway steps are inhibited . follow the analytical methodology in section 2; we obtain the following stability condition for the system

   

with

 and , where coefficients a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig> and b <dig> are given in the supplementary material .

k1-k <dig> bifurcation diagram
similar analysis was carried out on the two-dimensional m1-m <dig> coordinate to determine the ranges of m <dig> satisfying condition . figure 4b shows that, in this case, g is a concaved-up parabola instead of a straight line like g in the previously considered system . nevertheless, there exists still at most one intersection point between f and g, resulting in a similar bifurcation pattern for the k <dig> vs. k <dig> diagram as in  . moreover, the critical value for k <dig> discussed previously is found to have the same form here. this again confirms that incorporation of additional feedback loop does not affect k1crit, regardless of the location of the added loop. moreover, the first loop's hill coefficient  also has its rgs unchanged: rgs =  is superimposed on the m1-m <dig> plane  and indicated by the thin line in figure 4b. note that that g and g meets on the m1-axis. moreover, the slope at this point for g is always steeper than g, suggesting a higher lower bound for m <dig> for stability. the implication is: given the same set of parameter values, adding loop l <dig> results in a larger stability region  than adding loop l <dig>  therefore better enhance system stability. on the other hand,  is more likely to exhibit oscillatory dynamics than .

three-species, multiple-loop system 
in this section, we consider the system structure which incorporates all three feedback loops imposing on all pathway steps . the analysis becomes more complicated, as a result. for this multiple-loop system, the stability condition is given by

  

due to space restriction, we give the explicit forms of function f and g in the supplementary material . k <dig> was derived as a function of the remaining model parameters:

  

following the similar methodology laid out above, we were able to compute bifurcation diagrams for any pair of feedback strengths . in all the cases, it is found that having extra third loop always increases the stability of the system, illustrated by expansion of the stability region on bifurcation diagrams. the likelihood of obtaining oscillatory dynamics is directly controlled by strengths of the loops in effect, with stronger feedback loops always result in smaller oscillatory region. figure 11b compares the bifurcation profiles of the doubled-loop and three-loop systems.

four-species, coupled-loop system
to further understand the effects of loops coupling in negative feedback systems, we examine a system consisting of four species with two loops in action, denoted  . our derivation arrives at the stability condition for this system, given below

   

in this case f still have the usual form

   

with a as in equation . however, we have

   

where the coefficients a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> are given in the supplementary material .

in a similar fashion, to construct bifurcation diagram of the loops' feedback strengths, we need to determine the ranges of m <dig> that satisfies  via examining the curves in  and  on the m1-m <dig> coordinate. system stability occurs over the ranges of m <dig> such that f lies below g, while oscillatory dynamics reigns over the remaining ranges.

as expected, system extension greatly complicates the analysis due to the increased number of parameters and the increased complexity of g.

loops coupling lowers hill coefficients for oscillations
to find the rgs for the hill coefficients n <dig> and n <dig>  we determine on the two-parameter hill coefficients n1-n <dig> plane regions that give rise to system stability regardless of the feedback loops' strengths and other parameters. these regions can be referred to as the regions of guaranteed stability for n <dig> and n <dig> 

from figure 12a we can see that condition  will always be satisfied if g always lies above the unit square u and therefore above f for all k <dig>  the rgs for n <dig>  n <dig> can thus be found by solving the following system of inequalities,

   

put , which only depends on the degradation parameters. we obtain the rgs as containing those points  on the n1-n <dig> plane such that

   

where b <dig> and b <dig> have the same form as in  and , respectively. specifically,

  

this region is presented in figure 12b as the marked area bounded by the axes . figure 12b shows the rgs region for three different sets of the degradation rates. interestingly, we found that for arbitrary values of degradation parameters, the corresponding rgs always contain the  <dig> by  <dig> triangular, indicating that any  inside this triangular guarantees system stability regardless of all other model parameters including the feedback strengths. on the other hand, for  outside the triangular, we can always find a set of kdi  so that its rgs does not contain , giving rise to unstable system equilibrium.

recall that in the cases of single-loop systems considered before, there exist lower bound conditions for the hill coefficients if oscillatory dynamics is to be obtained. for example, n <dig> must >  <dig> for , and n <dig> must >  <dig> for . feedback loops coupling, however, effectively removes these constraints for the hill coefficients. in fact, sustained oscillation is now achievable for any value of n <dig>  given proper choice of n <dig> . as a result, sustained oscillation can occur at much more biologically plausible values of n <dig>  n2; e.g.  =  or , indicated by the dots in figure 12b.

it is important to note that the rgs for  solely depends on only the degradation rates. variation on these rates affects its size and location. b <dig> is maximised if among the degradation parameters, one is many folds greater than another . similarly, b <dig> is maximised if kdi >> kdj. on the other hand, b <dig>  b <dig> are lowest when kdi >> kdj with kd <dig> ≈ kd <dig> ≈ kd <dig> ≈ kd <dig>  therefore, reducing any degradation rate to extreme low or high level will expand the rgs, resulting in system stability for wider range of hill coefficients. oscillation, consequently, is enhanced when the degradation rates are kept comparable between the system species.

loops coupling generates  <dig> different k1-k <dig> bifurcation patterns
if  lies outside the rgs region, g must cross u and therefore must intersect with f at least once at some value of the feedback strength indicator k <dig>  unlike the previously considered systems where only one intersection point is detected, the number of intersection points in this case could be up to three. this provides a rich variety of different bifurcation profiles for the system. in fact, we identify a total of  <dig> distinct patterns of bifurcation on the k <dig> vs. k <dig> bifurcation plane; each pattern for one choice of the hill coefficients. these  <dig> patterns are displayed in figure  <dig> 

these bifurcation diagrams differ in their characteristics: the shapes of the stable and oscillatory regions. for example, figure 13a shows a simple bifurcation profile: for each and every value of k <dig>  the system displays oscillations over a range of k <dig> with a lower bound but no upper bound. figure 13c shows a similar feature but the range of k <dig> for oscillations is now bounded by both the lower and upper bounds; moreover, this range only exists for a certain range of k <dig>  figure 13k displays even more intricate bifurcation characteristics: as the parameter k <dig> moves up the vertical axis, the corresponding set of values of k <dig> for oscillations continually changes with no, one bounded range, two bounded ranges, and one unbounded range. this indicates the complexity between the feedback loops' strengths in contributing to shaping up the dynamics of the system, as a whole.

end-product utilisation
in the preceding model systems, reduction of model species was assumed to occur only through degradative processes . however, species' reduction could also occur via other mechanisms. we consider here the scenario where the end-product , besides being degraded, is due to be consumed by the cell for synthesising other cellular components. notable examples are of common amino acid biosynthesis pathways in which the amino acid  is utilised by the cell for protein synthesis  <cit> . earlier work  <cit>  suggests that the change of the end-product in this manner has important effects on the dynamical stability of the system. however, these work were numerical; there are no analytical analyses of this effect.

although the inclusion of g complicates our analysis, we were able to obtain the stability condition for the system in simple form similar to  

  

with bg is given by  and  of system ):

  

as shown in additional file  <dig>  section  <dig>  for the system to have equilibrium, the utilisation rate g must not exceed a critical value

   

end-product utilisation enables oscillations at any hill coefficient
with , it is easy to check that bg <  <dig> for all n <dig> and g. hence, for any n <dig>  stability condition  can be breached by choosing k <dig> sufficiently large , and so the system is destabilised . moreover, this is true for arbitrary value of g >  <dig>  the interesting implication here is that, unlike system  where sustained oscillation is only attainable for certain n <dig> , the inclusion of g, even small, has enabled the system to attain oscillation at any n <dig>  end-product utilisation therefore allows oscillatory dynamics at low cooperativity level. this is demonstrated in figure 14b where bifurcation diagrams on the k1-n <dig> plane are compared for system with  and without  end-product utilisation. the bifurcation diagrams were constructed based on the threshold k <dig> which we calculated to be :

   

this threshold approaches a critical value as n <dig> increases; k1crit is given by /a which is smaller than k1crit of  . this indicates in order to achieve oscillation; the feedback strength of the system with end-product utilisation must generally be stronger .

effects of g on systems dynamics
we expect that change in g would bring change in the dynamical characteristics of the system. we found that this change comes about in an interesting way. as g  increases, k1crit reduces, causing shrinking of oscillatory region, especially at high n <dig> . therefore, higher utilisation of the end-product generally requires stronger feedback loop if oscillation is to be obtained. however, when g exceeds  <dig> , the oscillatory region changes its shape significantly resembling an l shape, indicated by the crossed area in figure 14c . now at low n <dig>  oscillatory region is greatly expanded, enabling oscillation at a much wider range of k <dig> 

we also present on figure 14d the two-parameter k <dig> vs. g bifurcation diagrams for n <dig> =  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in this case, higher cooperativity generally gives rise to larger oscillatory region, consequently promoting oscillation. we observe an intermediate value of g  for which oscillation is most likely  while at low and high g the system tends to be more stable. this is consistent for all three plotted n <dig>  as n <dig> increases, this intermediate g moves further left in its spectrum 

to sum up, we showed that end-product utilisation enhances sustained oscillation at low cooperativity level while it enhances stability at high cooperativity. however, it is important to note that raising the utilisation level does not always further these enhancements. in fact, there exists an intermediate rate for utilisation at which sustained oscillation is detected most likely, while less likely at other rates.

biological examples
restricted by the paper's scope, we only present here two biological examples from the literature where useful insights can be readily obtained by applying the analysis outlined in this paper. these are  the hes <dig> oscillator which plays an important role during somitogenesis of vertebrates and  the tryptophan operon system responsible for regulatory production of tryptophan in escherichia coli. the former system exemplifies single-loop system while the later is an instance of multiple-loop system.

the hes <dig> oscillator
a wide range of cellular phenomena have their activities centred on oscillations  <cit> . one such notable example is vertebrate somitogenesis. this is a developmental process in which the vertebrate embryo becomes segmented by the regular sequential assignment of mesodermal cells to discrete blocks  <cit> . experimental evidence reveals the basic helix-loop-helix  transcription factor hes <dig> as an important cyclic gene driving this oscillations  <cit> . these studies showed that the oscillatory expression of the bhlh factor hes <dig> is regulated by a direct negative feedback loop whereby hes <dig> represses the transcription of its own coding gene 

a few models have been developed for this network  <cit> . here we base our analysis on a model suggested by zeiser et al.  <cit>  which consists of four ordinary differential equations involving hes <dig> mrna and protein and incorporates their transportation processes between the nucleus and cytoplasm. using notations in the original paper, the model equations are given below,

   

   

   

   

here m <dig> and m <dig> represents the concentration of hes <dig> mrna before and after being transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, respectively; while p <dig> and p <dig> are the concentration of hes <dig> protein before and after being transported from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, respectively. equation  describes the synthesis of mrna in the nucleus. the mrna is then transported into the cytoplasm, described by . translation into protein is specified by  while  represents transportation of the protein into the nucleus where it represses its own transcription. parameters b and a denote the decay and modification rates for mrna respectively; while d and e are used for the protein. to simplify the analysis, zeiser et al. assumed the decay rates  as being identical for both forms of the mrna and protein. by fixing b =  <dig> , d =  <dig>  and under condition of having oscillation period about  <dig> min, all determined in hirata et al.  <cit> , zeiser et al. estimated a set of fitting parameters, displayed in table  <dig> 

it is easy to see that model  is just a special case of system model  analysed earlier with parameters adapted and presented in table  <dig>  consequently, the threshold hill coefficient is computed based on equation  using only the degradation parameters gives a value of about  <dig> . this means for the hes <dig> oscillator to be oscillating at all, the hill coefficient must be greater than  <dig> . the hill coefficient used by zeiser et al.,  <dig>  is quite close to this minimum value . we constructed the two-parameter k1-n <dig> bifurcation diagram in figure 16a. the threshold feedback strength can also be readily calculated from equation , as k1thesh = 1/a =  <dig>  thus, for the hes <dig> system to be an oscillator, the necessary condition for k <dig> is that k <dig> <  <dig>  given other parameters' values in table  <dig>  moreover based on figure 16a, at n <dig> =  <dig> , viable range of feedback strength for the hes <dig> oscillator is  <dig> <k <dig> <  <dig> . zeiser et al. therefore used a quite small k <dig> . interestingly, we find that variation of the feedback strength  has little effect on the oscillation period. figure 16c compares the temporal change of hes <dig> protein concentration, p <dig> in , for the parameter set in table  <dig> and when feedback strength is 100-fold stronger , and 10-fold weaker . so in fact, constraining the oscillation period to be  <dig> mins can gives rise to many more suitable parameter sets other than one in table  <dig> 

k1
the tryptophan operon system
the tryptophan operon system in e. coli controls the production of tryptophan amino acid inside the cell. key molecular processes include transcription, translation and synthesis of tryptophan. to regulate these processes, the tryptophan operon utilises three negative feedback mechanisms: transcriptional repression, attenuation, and enzyme inhibition  <cit> .

the transcription process is initiated as rna polymerase binds to the promoter. however, when the activated form of repressor which is induced by the attachment of two tryptophan molecules become abundant, it will bind to the operator site and block rna polymerase from binding to the promoter, thereby, repressing transcription and forming the first feedback loop. furthermore, transcription can also be attenuated depending on the level of intracellular tryptophan and is controlled by the leader region sitting between the operator and the genes . this attenuation makes up the second feedback loop. the tryptophan operon consists of five structural genes positioned consecutively after the leader region. these genes code for five polypeptides that make up enzyme molecules in the form of tetramers, which in turn catalyse the synthesis of tryptophan from chorismates  <cit> .

anthranilate synthase  is the enzyme catalysing the first reaction step in the tryptophan synthesis pathway. the pathway end product tryptophan is fedback to inhibit anthranilate synthase activity if tryptophan level is high. enzyme inhibition therefore forms the third negative feedback loop in the tryptophan operon system.

   

   

   

we set up a simple three-species model for the tryptophan system as in equations . the state variables are the mrna , the as enzyme  and the tryptophan amino acid . each negative feedback loop is modelled using a hill function; ot is the static total operon concentration; k <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig> represent transcription rate, translation rate and tryptophan synthesis rate, respectively; kd <dig>  kd <dig>  kd <dig> are the degradation rates . consumption of tryptophan for protein synthesis is simply assumed to follow first order kinetics and represented by the last term of equation . parameter values are adapted from  <cit>  and tabulated in table  <dig> 

it can be seen that model  is a case of the general multiple-looped  considered in the section "coupled-loop systems". we applied the analysis to the tryptophan operon system for the parameter set in table  <dig>  furthermore, for each parameter p in table  <dig>  we varied it over a wide range around its nominal value  while fixing the other parameters. under all these scenarios, system stability was always obtained. given the nominal values of the synthetic and degradation rates, the system failed to demonstrate oscillations even at very high hill coefficient values  and at weak or strong feedback loops. this suggests that the tryptophan system is extremely stable.

the highly stable property of the tryptophan system is probably underlined by the fact that it is regulated by multiple feedback loops in concert. in addition, the system's degradation rates kd <dig>  kd <dig> and  are significantly different to each other as shown in table  <dig>  this disparity in value of the degradation rates, as discussed earlier, greatly enhances system stability. on the other hand, by adjusting kd <dig>  kd <dig>  kd <dig> and g so that kd <dig> ≈ kd <dig> ≈ kd3+g, oscillatory behaviour can now be observed at much lower hill coefficient and at appropriate feedback strength of the loops. for example, setting kd1= kd2= kd3+g =  <dig> can give rise to oscillatory dynamics with n <dig>  n <dig> as in table  <dig> and n <dig> as low as  <dig> .

summary and 
CONCLUSIONS
previous studies  <cit>  have looked mainly at the effect of cooperativity level on system dynamics, while largely neglecting the effects of feedback strength. furthermore, most of these analyses were carried out numerically; those with analytical approaches were however often done under great simplification for model equations such as stringently assuming that all degradation parameters are identical  <cit> . the major contributions from our study are summarised and discussed below.

threshold feedback strength
for single-loop systems where inhibition is fedback by the end-product on the first reaction step, i.e. the original goodwin system, it was found that oscillatory behaviour is only obtainable if the feedback loop is sufficiently strong. otherwise, the system is stable and achieves steady state. switching between these dynamics occurs through a hopf bifurcation. we derived an explicit, analytical form for the feedback strength's bifurcation point which can be straightforwardly computed if the other model parameters are known. interestingly, this threshold strength was found to follow a saturation trend and approaches a critical level as the hill coefficient increases. we further showed that this critical feedback strength equals the ratio of the product of the degradation rates and the product of the synthesis rates. so for a system with feedback strength weaker than this critical level, system stability is guaranteed regardless of how high the hill coefficient is.

studying the two-parameter bifurcation diagram with the feedback strength and the hill coefficient as parameters revealed that as the hill coefficient is raised, sustained oscillation can be obtained over a wider range of feedback strength; suggesting that higher cooperativity level tends to enhance the probability of demonstrating sustained oscillations. this result is in line with previous results from tyson & othmer  <cit>  and goldbeter  <cit> .

threshold hill coefficient
assuming identical degradation rates, previous studies of the goodwin system have identified a threshold value for the hill coefficient lower than which, sustained oscillation is unachievable. under this over-simplifying assumption, the threshold cooperativity level was found only dependent of the length of the system pathway. however, such a similar threshold hill coefficient has not been analytically determined for systems with general, arbitrary degradation rates. we explicitly derived this threshold for the three and four-species systems, which turns out to be rather simple, symmetrical functions of only the degradation rates and are not influenced by the synthesis rates. more importantly, the threshold reaches its minimum when all the degradation rates are equal. the threshold hill coefficient obtained under identical degradation rates, therefore, provides a lower bound for that of the general case. we further showed that for the systems with hill coefficient exceeding the threshold value, it can always oscillate with a properly chosen set of parameters' values. in fact, the number of parameter sets giving rise to sustained oscillations is indefinite. for the systems with more species, the threshold hill coefficient is also explicitly derivable; however, the form of the resulting function becomes significantly more complex. nevertheless, the above results also apply for longer systems which we confirmed using numerical simulations.

effects of parameters variation
parameter sensitivity analysis revealed interesting effects of parameters  variation on the dynamical characteristics of the system. because of the symmetry in the expressions involving the threshold feedback strength and hill coefficient, the individual model species equally characterise the system bifurcation profiles despite the fact that the feedback loop is only acting on the first reaction step. specifically, increasing the synthesis rate of any model species by the same proportion results in a proportionally larger oscillatory region and hence in a system which is more likely to oscillate. in contrast to this simple linear relationship between the synthesis rates and the bifurcation profiles, the degradation rates affect system dynamics in a more intricate manner. we found that system stability is most likely when the model species are rapidly degraded while slow degradation only leads to stability if the feedback strength is significantly weak. we further showed that having comparable degradation rates between the model species promotes oscillations, whereas stability is promoted if one rate is significantly larger than another. this suggests a way to enhance system stability by unbalancing the degradation rates; preferably, towards high levels. these results are particularly helpful for the engineering of synthetic circuits with desirable dynamical behaviour, as well as for parameter estimation and optimisation.

feedback reallocation
for single-loop systems, reallocation of the feedback loop to inhibit a reaction step further downstream may or may not make the system more stable. interestingly, the specific effect is determined only by the degradation rates of the model species downstream of the newly inhibited species. the dynamical properties of the new system closely resemble those of the goodwin system with reduced length, which equals to the number of species downstream of the inhibited species. therefore, as the loop moves closer towards the end of the pathway, the minimum hill coefficient for oscillation is reduced. in addition, we found that feedback reallocation does not influence the critical feedback strength discussed above. this means that for a system possessing a loop weaker than this strength, its stability is ensured regardless of the loop's position and the cooperativity level.

system extension
it has been known that lengthening the system by increasing the number of reaction steps, i.e, increasing number of model species, reduces the cooperativity necessarily required for sustained oscillations  <cit> . the implication here was that system extension enhances oscillations. however, this result was demonstrated under the assumption of identical degradation rates. when this assumption is relaxed, we found that the extended system is not always more stable. more importantly, whether it is more stable or not is attributed to the kinetics of the added species: more stable only when the added species degrades slower than it is being produced; and more oscillation-prone otherwise.

non-oscillatory systems
it has been known that the systems with two species are incapable of exhibiting sustained oscillations, regardless of the feedback strength and the hill coefficient value  <cit> . our analysis further showed that those systems with arbitrary lengths which possess a single loop inhibiting either the last step or second-last step of the pathways is also incapable of obtaining oscillatory dynamics. in addition, multiple-looped systems which include at least one loop inhibiting either the last or second last step of the pathway is also incapable of demonstrating oscillatory behaviours.

effects of end-product utilisation
we also investigated the situation when the pathway's end-product is used up by the cells, which is common in many metabolic pathways. most interestingly, we showed analytically that end-product utilisation enables oscillatory dynamics at any hill coefficient value. more specifically, end-product utilisation enhances sustained oscillation at low cooperativity level but enhances stability at high cooperativity level. it is important to note that raising the utilisation level does not always further these enhancements. in fact, there exists an intermediate rate for utilisation at which sustained oscillation is most likely to be detected, while being less likely at other utilisation rates.

effects of loops coupling
since cellular systems are complex and often consist of multiple, interlocked feedback loops. understanding of how the loops act together in giving rise to the system dynamics is absolutely crucial. designs with interlinked positive and negative feedback loop have been shown to exhibit performance advantages over simple negative feedback loops, such as the ability to easily tune frequency of oscillators, improved robustness and reliability, even under noisy environments  <cit> . multiple-negative-feedback-loop designs have also been shown to enhance system robustness and generates developmental constancy  <cit> . we obtained in this study a number of results which further our understanding into the dynamics of coupled-loop systems. we discuss these below.

first, coupled loops effectively enable oscillations at lower, more biologically plausible hill coefficient value. for example, a four-species single loop goodwin system requires the hill coefficient  to be at least  <dig> for oscillations. its variant design with the loop reallocated to impose on the second pathway step requires the hill coefficient  to be at least  <dig> for oscillations. however, a system with both of these loops in effect can achieve oscillations at practically any hill coefficient value for one loop, given proper choice of the hill coefficient for the other loop. oscillations, therefore, are possible at more biologically plausible hill coefficients, for example at  =  or .

reduction of the hill coefficient for oscillations is often only suggested via pathway lengthening by previous studies. in this study, loops coupling and end-product utilisation  were shown as the two additional mechanisms where this reduction can be obtained without increasing the number of system variables.

secondly, coupled-loop systems were also shown to exhibit much greater complexity and more diverse behaviours compared to their single-loop counterparts. we showed that, by having just two loops performing cooperatively, the four-species system demonstrates a rich diversity of dynamical characteristics. for example, we detected a total of up to <dig> different bifurcation patterns between the feedback strengths. this enhancement in behavioral complexity and diversity might be the reason why evolution has driven some systems to acquire multiple feedback regulations as it will increase the chance of organisms' survival when facing fluctuating environments.

thirdly, we found that different combinations of feedback strengths of individual loops give rise to different dynamical regimes. for three species with double loops acting on the first and second steps, stability is most probable when a weak first loop is coupled with a strong second loop. oscillations, on the other hand, are most likely if a weak second loop is coupled with a strong first loop. if oscillations are to be obtained with a strong first loop, the second loop must also be significantly strong.

fourthly, we found a threshold strength for the first loop. if the loop is weaker than this threshold, the system is always stable regardless of the strength of the second loop. this threshold strength turns out to be independent of the second loop's specification . on the contrary, at any strength of the second loop, stable as well as oscillatory dynamics are obtainable given a proper choice of the first loop's strength. by further considering the coupled-loop system consisting of the loops on the first and the third reaction step, we discovered that the location of the additional loop has no influence on the threshold strength of the first feedback loop.

finally, examining the system with all three loops in action showed that incorporating the extra third loop always enhances system stability. the likelihood of having oscillatory behaviour is directly determined by the loops' strength: stronger loops always result in smaller oscillatory region.

we demonstrate the practicality of our analysis by including a brief investigation of two example systems: the hes <dig> oscillator and the tryptophan operon system. the former system represents a single-loop system while the latter represents one with multiple negative feedback loops coupled together. because of the abundant number of biological systems regulated by negative feedback loops  the methods developed in this study may prove useful in gaining better understanding of their dynamical behaviours.
