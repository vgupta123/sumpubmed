BACKGROUND
systems genetics is an evolving new speciality that can be used to define biological networks and to predict molecular interactions. it is based on the analysis of transcripts whose expression co-vary within genetic populations, such as the bxd strains of mice and the hxb strains of rats or other genetic reference panels. genenetwork http://www.genenetwork.org is an example of a bioinformatics tool that can be used to explore systems genetics data.

the importance of defining biological networks and predicting molecular interactions has been emphasized by several reports  <cit> . such studies emphasize that when knowledge about dna variation within populations is interfaced with data on gene expression, protein interactions and dna-protein binding, biological networks can be constructed that are predictive of the physiological molecular interactions and of disease susceptibility.

in  <dig>  we published the first report documenting the ability of the systems genetics tool genenetwork to predict interactions between molecules that could be then confirmed by molecular analysis  <cit> . the p2p-r gene, coding for a hnrnp-related protein  <cit>  that binds both the p <dig>  <cit>  and rb <dig>  <cit>  tumor suppressor proteins was used as a test molecule. p2p-r was entered into genenetwork to search for a co-variant that was most highly co-expressed in three tissues of the bxd mouse genetic reference panel, ie,, cerebellum, hematopoietic stem cells and whole brain specimens. the outcome of that study was the identification of pum <dig> as the gene product that showed a strong positive expression covariance with p2p-r. pum <dig> is a member of the highly conserved puf family of rna binding proteins that often function as gene-specific translation regulators, through their association with specific elements located in the 3' untranslated region  of their target mrnas  <cit> . the 3' utr of the p2p-r mrna was found to contain one perfect consensus and two near-perfect consensus pum <dig> binding sequences, while pull-down assays combined with reverse transcription and rt-pcr confirmed that pum <dig> does indeed bind p2p-r mrna to modulate its expression  <cit> .

from the time when p2p-r was cloned it has been implicated in multiple cellular processes such as mitosis  <cit> , mrna processing  <cit>  and translation  <cit> . in addition, recent studies have suggested that p2p-r has a role in ubiquitination and degradation of p <dig> and yb- <dig> proteins  <cit> , while it has been shown to be highly up-regulated in oesophageal cancer, being a promising target for immunotherapy against the disease  <cit> . to further investigate the functional potential of p2p-r, we used the genenetwork database to evaluate if genetically-defined mechanisms modulate the co-expression of any distinct sets of gene products with p2p-r. an adipocyte genetic reference panel of hxb/bxh recombinant strains of rats and an eye genetic reference panel of bxd recombinant inbred strains of mice have been employed for these studies. these two genetic reference panels were chosen because p2p-r was cloned and characterized using primarily proadipocytes  <cit>  and because the genenetwork eye database represents the most genetically diverse bxd reference panel available for analysis.

the outcome of these systems genetics studies implies that p2p-r is an important member of large genetically-defined transcription networks in adipose and eye tissues. that prediction was then confirmed by data showing that p2p-r can function as a co-repressor of estrogen-induced transcription. immunoprecipitation experiments strengthen such functional studies by confirming that p2p-r interacts with src- <dig> and by demonstrating that p2p-r also interacts with estrogen receptor α . these data suggest that p2p-r may be a component of large macromolecular complexes that impact steroid-dependent transcription.

RESULTS
p2p-r is part of a genetically-defined transcription network in fat cells
since most studies concerning the cloning and characterization of p2p-r were performed using the 3t3t proadipocyte system  <cit> , we initiated the current studies focusing on the rat fat cell genenetwork microarray database to evaluate if genetically-defined mechanisms modulate the co-expression of any distinct sets of transcripts with p2p-r. the results show that in rat fat cells  <cit> , p2p-r is co-expressed with a large set of transcription-associated gene products.

when the top  <dig> gene transcripts that are co-expressed with p2p-r and have correlation coefficients ≥  <dig>  were exported for gene ontology analysis to webgestalt,  <dig> gene products were found to be associated with transcription with p =  <dig> e- <dig> . when these top  <dig> transcripts were rechecked, using the trait data and analysis form - id function of gene network, additional gene products associated with transcription were identified, to give a total of  <dig> transcription-associated gene products, including p2p-r, whose expression genetically co-varies  . figure  <dig> shows that of the transcription network consisting of  <dig> gene transcripts,  <dig> are co-expressed with a correlation coefficient of ≥  <dig> . figure  <dig> also suggests that at the core of this network is a group of  <dig> transcripts that show the most numerous genetic associations. these key transcription network components include: p2p-r , atf <dig>  thrap <dig>  crsp <dig>  zfml, pura, dr <dig>  gtf2e <dig>  maml <dig> and cnot <dig> 

the above data were then normalized using the robust multiarray method   <cit> . in such studies it is worthwhile to evaluate databases using at least two normalization approaches. therefore, the mas <dig> normalization tool was also used. both normalization methods confirmed that a large network of transcription-association gene transcripts is indeed co-expressed with p2p-r in rat fat cells . in support of the above data based on analysis of the fat cell genenetwork database derived from hxb/bhx recombinant inbred rats, limited analysis were also performed on the genenetwork mouse adipose tissue database wherein it was found that  <dig> % of the transcripts whose expression co-varies with p2p-r with a correlation coefficient of ≥  <dig>  has transcription-associated functions . this percentage is comparable to the one observed in studies on the fat cell database of recombinant inbred hxb/bhx rats.

p2p-r is part of a genetically-defined transcription network in the eye
to confirm the finding that p2p-r is part of a large transcription network, evaluations were next performed in other tissues. in this respect, the eye genenetwork database was evaluated because it includes the largest and most genetically diversity mouse population with > <dig> strains  <cit> . in the context of this study, the top  <dig> gene transcripts whose expression co-varies with p2p-r and had correlation coefficients of ≥  <dig>  were identified and exported to the online webgestalt gene ontology analysis system. figure  <dig> presents an excerpt of that analysis showing that  <dig> gene products with transcription-associated functions are co-expressed with p2p-r with p =  <dig> e- <dig>  when the top  <dig> transcripts were manually reappraised as above, a total of  <dig> transcription gene products were identified as part of the transcription network associated with p2p-r . a tabulation of all these transcription-associated gene products are presented in additional file  <dig>  and figure  <dig> illustrates the  <dig> transcripts of that network whose expression covary with correlation coefficients > <dig> .

even more detailed analysis of the  <dig> members of the eye transcription network, reveals the following network characteristics:

1) ~80% of the  <dig> transcription network gene products have nucleotide binding characteristics.

2) >40% of the  <dig> transcription network gene products bind zinc.

3) ~30% of the  <dig> transcription network gene products bind both nucleotides and zinc, and

4) ~10% of the  <dig> members of the p2p-r transcription network gene products are associated with hormone-mediated transcription. these include the following transcription factors or co-factors: nr3c <dig> , ep <dig> , pparbp , glcci <dig> , esrrg , srebf <dig> , ncoa <dig> , ncor <dig> , ncoa <dig>   and ncoa <dig>  and nr2f <dig>  .

the findings from studies on fat cell-adipose and eye tissues therefore strongly suggest that p2p-r has the potential to function as a member of a genetically-defined transcription complex. two important questions arise from these findings. does a p2p-r-associated transcription network exist in all tissues? can the role of p2p-r in transcription be confirmed by molecular studies? to address the first question, studies were performed on several other tissues in the genenetwork database to search for additional p2p-r transcription networks. there was no evidence of a p2p-r-associated transcription network in liver or whole brain databases, however, in a cerebellum database a smaller p2p-r-associated transcription set could be identified . these data suggest that the role of p2p-r in transcription may be tissue specific. the studies in the following sections address the second question and show that p2p-r can indeed function as a transcriptional co-repressor.

repression of estrogen-induced transcription by p2p-r
several members of the transcription network co-expressed with p2p-r participate in steroid-regulated transcription . in this regard, of special note is the april  <dig>   <dig> report in the nuclear receptor signaling atlas online database http://www.nursa.org that p2p-r interacts with ncoa <dig> , a well-known steroid receptor co-regulator , while hela and 293t cells were additionally co-transfected with erα. co-transfection experiments were performed in the presence of either vehicle  or  <dig> picomolar 17-beta estradiol  to determine if the transfection of p2p-r influences basal and/or estrogen-dependent transcription. the results presented in figure 5a document that p2p-r represses e2-induced transcription in all cell lines tested with repression ranging from  <dig> to 70%. no effect on transcription levels was observed in the presence of dmso , suggesting that p2p-r influences only e2-dependent transcription.

to identify which domain of the p2p-r protein is responsible for the observed repression of e2-induced transcription, mcf- <dig> cells were transiently co-transfected with an erα-reporter construct with an empty vector or with plasmid constructs that encode specific p2p-r domains as illustrated in figure 5b. the five p2p-r plasmid constructs that were employed include: the near full length p2p-r ; the n-terminal half of p2p-r ; the c-terminal half of p2p-r ; a c-terminal sub-domain of p2p-r  and the c-terminal most domain of p2p-r   <cit> . as shown in figure 5c, all four p2p-r constructs that encode the c-terminal regions of p2p-r, repressed estrogen-dependent transcription to more or less the same extent as full-length p2p-r, whereas the n-terminal half of p2p-r showed minimal repressor activity. it appears therefore that a region within the  <dig> amino acids of the c-terminal most segment of p2p-r is the primary effector that functions to inhibit estrogen-dependent transcription.

to substantiate the conclusion that p2p-r functions as a co-repressor of estrogen-induced transcription, studies were next performed to evaluate the effects of knocking down p2p-r expression on estrogen-dependent transcription. for these studies, mouse 3t3t cells were employed, since a 3t3t cell line that express reduced levels of p2p-r had previously been developed by stably transfecting cells with a construct expressing a p2p-r antisense rna that knocked down p2p-r expression by 50-70%  <cit> . the data in figure  <dig> demonstrate that 3t3t cells with knocked down p2p-r expression showed a  <dig>  fold increase in estrogen-induced transcription activity.

the p2p-r protein interacts with erα and src-1
since it has been previously reported that p2p-r can interact with steroid receptor coactivator  <dig> protein  http://www.nursa.org, we sought to investigate the potential interactions of p2p-r with components of the estrogen receptor complex. accordingly, we evaluated the potential interaction of p2p-r with erα and attempted to confirm experimentally its interaction with src- <dig>  figure 7a shows that antibodies against erα and src- <dig> co-immunoprecipitated p2p-r. on the other hand, the anti-p2p-r antibody was able to co-immunoprecipate src- <dig>  while no immunoprecipitation of erα was detected . this could be due to the fact that the epitopes recognized by erα were sterically hindered in the p2p-r complexes. future experiments will be required to determine if erα and src- <dig> directly interact with p2p-r and to which p2p-r domains they bind.

discussion
the data reported in this paper establish that the function of gene products can be confidently predicted by determining their association with specific genetically-defined biological networks, using systems genetics approaches and tools, such as genenetwork. genenetwork has been previously used to predict a molecular interaction between p2p-r and pum <dig>  the gene transcript which is most consistently co-expressed with p2pr in three tissues of the bxd mouse genetic reference panel. that prediction was confirmed by molecular studies showing that pum <dig> binds to a specific sequence in the 5'utr of p2pr mrna to modulate p2pr expression  <cit> .

the current studies expand the use of genenetwork databases in an attempt to identify biological networks in which p2p-r is a member, leading to the prediction of new function. data derived using these systems genetics approaches suggest that p2p-r is an important member of large genetically-defined transcription networks in adipose and eye tissues, thereby having the potential to impact the expression of many hundreds of genes. that prediction was then confirmed by molecular studies showing that p2p-r can indeed function as a transcriptional co-repressor.

the results specifically demonstrate that p2p-r acts as a co-repressor of estrogen-dependent transcription in four different cell systems including mcf- <dig>  ishakawa, hela and 293t cells. the co-repressor activity of p2p-r was further confirmed by evidence that knocking down p2p-r protein expression, using an antisense oligonucleotide, facilitates estrogen-induced transcription. immunoprecipitation experiments support those functional studies by showing that the p2p-r protein is a component of the estrogen-transcription complex that includes erα and src- <dig>  preliminary data also suggest that p2p-r interacts with the mad <dig> mitotic protein , which is of interest in this context, since it has previously been reported that mad <dig> associates with estrogen receptor beta  <cit> .

an important question concerns how p2p-r might affect estrogen-induced transcription. since p2p-r is a hnrnp-like protein that associates with the nuclear matrix  <cit> , , we propose that estrogen-dependent transcription might also be linked to the nuclear matrix in association with p2p-r. in this respect it has been reported that estrogen-dependent transcription is mediated by immobilizing the transcription regulatory complex to dnase resistant nuclear matrix-like entities, in a manner that allows for continued turnover of some of the its components  <cit> . furthermore, the scaffold attachment factor b <dig>   <cit> , which can bind to the s/mar  elements of the nuclear matrix, was shown to interact with the c-terminal domain of rna polymerase ii, and with erα and to suppress erα-mediated transcription  <cit> . interestingly, we have previously shown by pull-down assays that the rs domain of p2p-r binds to safb <dig>  <cit> . we therefore speculate that p2p-r's transcription co-repressor function might stem from its ability to complex with safb <dig> and form dynamic structural and functional entities that influence the organization of chromatin or control the stringency by which various components of the estrogen receptor complex associate with the nuclear matrix, thereby regulating their rate of turnover, and consequently influencing the transcription rate.

it should be also noted that the c-terminal most domain of p2p-r  that is responsible for the observed inhibition of estrogen-dependent transcription is an unusual lysine rich region, reminiscent of the basic n-termini of several histones  <cit> . core histones are known to undergo acetylation that loosens the dna-histone contacts, thereby making the dna more accessible to transcription factors and promoting transcription initiation. the positively charged lysine rich region in p2p-r has been reported to undergo in vitro acetylation  <cit> . it is therefore possible that this region is similarly modified in vivo, in a way that mimics histone acetylation, thus acting as a competitive inhibitor of histone acetylation and consequently of chromatin remodeling.

the above suggested mechanisms by which p2p-r might influence transcription will need to be the focus of many more detailed studies. however, based on the data presented in this paper, it is now clear that p2p-r does have an important role in transcription, specifically in estrogen-dependent transcription and that this discovery was predicted using genenetwork.

CONCLUSIONS
this study strongly supports the conclusion that genenetwork is an excellent tool that can be used to confidently predict new functions for genes. using genenetwork, it was established that large genetically-defined transcription networks that include p2p-r exist in fat cells and eye tissues. based on a previous report that p2p-r can interact with src- <dig>  a well known steroid receptor co-regulator, and given that a significant percentage of the transcription genes within these networks are associated with hormone-mediated transcription, the effects of p2p-r on estrogen-dependent transcription were evaluated. the data presented corroborate the outcome of the systems genetics analyses and clearly show that p2p-r can function as a co-repressor of estrogen-dependent transcription. immunoprecipitation experiments strengthen those functional studies by confirming that p2p-r interacts with src- <dig> and by demonstrating that p2p-r also interacts with erα. p2p-r may therefore be a component of large macromolecular complexes that impact steroid-dependent transcription.
