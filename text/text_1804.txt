BACKGROUND
aspergillus nomius is an aflatoxigenic fungal species, grouped in the genus’ section flavi, which is often overshadowed by the more readily-sampled aflatoxigenic species such as a. flavus and a. parasiticus. the relatively little research attention applied to a. nomius likely relates to a historical belief that its occurrences are rare  <cit> ; however, more recent reports suggest that this fungus has a wider ecological distribution and a greater economic potential than once believed  <cit> . most samplings of a. nomius have been reported from infected insects  and non-agricultural soils  <cit> . reports also exist that show a. nomius’ potential as a human pathogen  <cit>  as well as its indirect potential for animal and human impact through aflatoxin contamination of agricultural commodities such as maize  <cit> , wheat  <cit> , sugar cane  <cit> , and tree nuts  <cit> .

in culture, a. nomius appears similar to the a. flavus l morphotype , so differentiation between these closely-related species can be fairly subjective and open to misidentification. the a. flavus l-type produces fewer large sclerotia and abundant conidia while the a. flavus s-type produces abundant small sclerotia and fewer conidia, but these are not considered different species  <cit> . historically, aflatoxin profiles have been used to distinguish between a. flavus and a. nomius since their macro- and micro-morphologies were highly similar. if an isolate produced only b-aflatoxins it was classified as a. flavus, and if b- and g- aflatoxins were produced, it was considered to be a. nomius. whereas a. parasiticus has several distinct morphological characteristics, this is not the case for distinguishing between a. flavus and a. nomius. for example, a. parasiticus typically produces asexual spore forming structures  with a single layer of spore-forming cells  and lacking an intermediate layer of cells , and has dark green conidia which are noticeably rough-walled  <cit> . these differences are not observed when comparing a. flavus and a. nomius whose colony diameters and coloration are very similar, tending towards yellow-green on czapek’s dox  agar. the size and texture  of their conidia are also very similar. the sclerotia of a. nomius are reported to be more elongated than those of a. flavus, and it has been observed that a. flavus grows well at 42 °c while a. nomius growth is slowed  <cit> . due to the number of similarities between a. flavus and a. nomius, genomic comparisons may be more useful than traditional methods for species identifications.

there have been additional cryptic aflatoxin producing species recently characterized that are related to, and potentially indistinguishable from, a. flavus , a. nomius and/or a. parasiticus such as a. arachidicola, a. minisclerotigenes and a. parvisclerotigenus ; therefore, a holistic approach to fungal identification and classification is required to make certain what is being characterized is not a naturally-occurring mutant or a hybrid offspring exhibiting a recombinant phenotype. this will involve comparisons of species morphology, extrolite production, host/niche range, and genomics  <cit> . a population study of a. nomius isolates sampled throughout thailand revealed three potential clades or lineages for this species  <cit> . within the last few years the sexual  state was discovered and assigned to the genus petromyces, and although the fungus is heterothallic, some strains contain both mating-type  idiomorphs and exist as functionally bisexual- meaning that either idiomorph is capable of outcrossing  <cit> . its bisexuality may allow for more rampant sexual recombination in the environment regardless of the dominant mating type present. with the potential for hybridization between aflatoxigenic species , a. nomius might serve as a mycotoxin reservoir in non-agricultural areas that are near agricultural fields  <cit> , and assist in the generation of offspring  with greater host ranges and novel chemotype profiles.

in this study we sequenced the genome of a. nomius to improve our understanding of its evolutionary place among the aflatoxigenic fungi, to ascertain those features that distinguish it from other closely-related species, and to promote research interest for this organism since it may offer more insights into the speciation and development of novel aflatoxigenic species.

RESULTS
genome details for a. nomius nrrl 13137
we sequenced the genome of a. nomius type strain nrrl  <dig> to 42x coverage. this gave us  <dig> million reads with a median read length of 306 bp,  <dig>  contigs of data , and a n <dig> length of  <dig>  bp. the raw sequence reads have been deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive as srr <dig>  the genome assembly of a. nomius nrrl  <dig> is approximately 36 mb in size and includes  <dig>  protein-encoding genes . comparatively, a. nomius has a similar genome size to the other sequenced species from section flavi. for example, assemblies for a. flavus nrrl  <dig> and a. oryzae rib <dig> are approximately 37 mb  <cit> . table  <dig> shows various morphological, toxigenic, and genomic differences between a. flavus, a. nomius and a. parasiticus. reports of the genome sizes of other sequenced aspergillus species indicate that a. niger cbs  <dig> , a. nidulans fgsc a <dig>  and a. fumigatus af <dig> have genome assemblies that include approximately 34 mb, 30 mb, and 29 mb, respectively . the reason for section flavi species having larger genomes than other sequenced aspergilli remains uncertain, but one reported possibility is gene acquisition  <cit> . the a. oryzae genome is one of the larger genomes of the section flavi examined, but it also has a higher percentage of repetitive dna than the others . of the nearly  <dig>  predicted genes for a. nomius, 39 %  were assigned as hypothetical with no functional annotation. although similar numbers of predicted genes were found in other sequenced species, due to limits in sequencing the a. nomius genome it should be noted that genes may not have been annotated if they happened to exist between contigs that have no overlap. the number of genes considered unique to a. nomius is  <dig>  or only about 9 % of the total number of its predicted genes. smurf* predicted a. nomius having an estimated  <dig> secondary metabolite clusters  while antismash predicted  <dig> smcs . the difference between these counts is likely related to stringency of predictions between the two programs; however, it is still recommended that both tools be used since they incorporate different algorithms in cluster prediction  <cit> . for example, smurf* predictions include dmat backbone genes whereas antismash does not, but even without considering dmat clusters antismash predicted a greater number of smcs than smurf*. beyond section flavi, our  <dig> smurf*-predicted smcs in a. nomius was comparable to the  <dig> in a. nidulans, and noticeably higher than the  <dig> in p. chrysogenum. andersen et al. reported a putative count of  <dig> smcs in a. nidulans which was also based on smurf* but may have also included “-like” genes   <cit> . according to antismash predictions, a. nomius had a much greater number of smcs than both a. nidulans  and p. chrysogenum . aspergillus parasiticus had the most predicted smcs across all aspergilli examined, based on predictions from both programs, while a. nidulans had the least number of smcs .table  <dig> genome characteristics for the a. nomius type strain nrrl 13137

gene ontology and enrichment for a. nomius nrrl 13137
a total of  <dig>  genes were assigned gene ontology  terms. level- <dig> go distribution results for each domain revealed that most gene products within the cellular component domain are involved in cell, membrane and organelle structure; within the biological process domain, most genes are involved in metabolic, cellular and single-organism processes; and analysis of the molecular function domain revealed that the greatest numbers of a. nomius genes are involved in ion binding, organic cyclic compound binding and heterocyclic compound binding . for the  <dig>  unique a. nomius genes,  <dig> of the  <dig> most significantly-enriched go terms as shown by the fisher’s exact test were associated with molecular function, and six were associated with biological process. significance levels, however, indicated that sequences associated with oxidoreductase activity had the highest enrichment  of all the go terms/categories . there were  <dig> protein sequences that were assigned to the “oxidoreductase activity” category of the molecular function domain. of these proteins, only  <dig> were assigned functional annotation with  <dig> identified as hypothetical. the greatest number of any particular protein within the category of oxidoreductase activity was related to cytochrome p <dig> . the epoxide metabolic process, and both fumagillin processes listed in table  <dig>  shared the same quantities and types of proteins  which would indicate overlapping functions for these biological processes. of the  <dig> proteins affiliated with the molecular function of heme binding,  <dig> were identified as hypothetical and only  <dig> of these were assigned functional annotation. as with oxidoreductase activity, the greatest number of any particular protein within the category of molecular function was related to cytochrome p <dig> . cytochrome p <dig> enzymes in fungi contribute to a multitude of complex bioconversions which are necessary for their adaptation and survival on various substrates  <cit> .table  <dig> fisher’s exact test examining go term enrichment for genes unique to a. nomius

comparison of annotated genes and phylogenomics among sequenced aspergillus genomes
an orthology analysis  revealed that the five species examined from section flavi share  <dig>  genes. when a. nidulans and the outgroup taxa, p. chrysogenum, were added to the analysis the number of shared genes decreases to  <dig>  . the count of  <dig>  unique genes in a. nomius is not the highest number for the five section flavi species examined, however, since a. flavus l-type  and a. parasiticus  appear to harbor more unique genes . aspergillus oryzae  has  <dig>  unique genes while s-type a. flavus  has the fewest unique genes . the highest quantity of shared unique genes between a. nomius and each of the other species examined is with a. parasiticus , and the lowest quantity shared is with a. oryzae . the number of shared unique genes among a. flavus l, a. parasiticus and a. nomius is less than 1 %  compared to those shared by all section flavi species examined; however, the inclusion of another aflatoxin producer  increased the number of shared unique genes by 11 % . the finding that a. flavus s contained many of the unique genes found in the other aflatoxigenic species examined warrants further investigation since it shares more unique genes with three species that, among themselves, do not share as many . the fewest numbers of shared genes involved an overlap of a. nomius and a. oryzae with a. parasiticus , a. flavus l , and a. flavus s . although closer examination of the unique genes within these closely-related species will result in better delimitation, it should be considered that the unique genes that separate a. flavus l, a. flavus s, and a. oryzae from one another may be more strain-specific than species-specific. additionally, a closer examination of the unique genes within these fungi could offer a more refined diagnostic pcr methodology to aid in species delimitation.fig.  <dig> a venn diagram quantifies unique and orthologous genes for multiple species in section flavi. this diagram of overlapping shapes includes species names, gene counts, and color-shading: nrrl  <dig>  is shaded blue, nrrl  <dig>  is shaded purple, af <dig>  is shaded green, su- <dig>  is shaded red, and rib <dig>  is shaded yellow



phylogenomic associations were used to infer a tree for multiple aspergilli . using penicillium chrysogenum as the outgroup taxa, we observed a divergence of the a. nidulans genome from those of section flavi, which was expected. although exhibiting a great deal of overall genomic similarity, a. nomius was observed to be the most basal genome of the species examined from section flavi, followed by the a. parasiticus  genome and then that of a. flavus s . the a. flavus l  and a. oryzae  genomes appear to have diverged most recently. based on our phylogenomic inference, a. nomius is confirmed as the ancestral organism compared to the other section flavi species examined, and would suggest that it may be the progenitor to the other aflatoxigenic species in section flavi. previous conventional phylogenetic studies have given researchers an idea of the evolutionary relationships for the aspergilli; therefore, a phylogenomic comparison including the genomes of all aflatoxigenic species would offer better resolution for the evolution of the aflatoxigenic phenotype. similarly, phylogenomic comparison of the remaining species from section flavi  would offer more insights into the relatedness of these fungi. for example, a. alliaceus is usually observed basal to the other species in many phylogenetic inferences involving section flavi  <cit> , but these are usually based on analyses of one to three individual loci. ehrlich et al.  <cit>  reported the possibility of multiple lineages of a. nomius that include genetically-distinct isolates, so a comparative phylogenomic study of strains from each lineage may ascertain whether or not these strains should all be considered a. nomius.fig.  <dig> phylogenomic comparison of sequenced aspergillus species reveals patterns of ancestry. this tree was inferred from phylogenomic comparisons of multiple aspergillus species  with penicillium chrysogenum as the outgroup taxa



a. nomius nrrl  <dig> mat locus investigation revealed a single mat1- <dig> idiomorph
according to horn et al.  <cit> , a. nomius is a heterothallic fungus that is incapable of self-fertilization despite some observed strains possessing both idiomorphs. the a. nomius type strain, nrrl  <dig>  is considered a mat1- <dig> strain because only a single α-box idiomorph has been shown to be present using diagnostic pcr  <cit> , and our sequencing results support this finding. blast query of nucleotide and protein sequences, for a mat1- <dig> idiomorph, to the nrrl  <dig> genome failed to uncover any homologs. the mat1- <dig> gene of nrrl  <dig> spans  <dig>  bp, and is comprised of two exons adjoined by a single 52 bp intron. this mat gene is flanked by two other genes, sla <dig> and apn <dig>  which have respective lengths of  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp, and are separated from the mat gene by nucleotide distances of  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp, respectively . these two flanking genes appear to have conserved locations upstream and downstream of the mat genes in other species from section flavi  <cit> . according to metzenberg and glass, mat idiomorphs within heterothallic fungi will occupy a similar chromosomal location  <cit> ; for a. oryzae, a. flavus and a. parasiticus, the idiomorphs are reported to reside on chromosome vi  <cit> . we cannot yet say which chromosome harbors the mat gene in a. nomius, but the 65 kb contig that contains the sla <dig>  mat1- <dig> and apn <dig> genes exhibits synteny to other section flavi species and has sequence homology to chromosome vi in a. oryzae.fig.  <dig> the mating-type locus of a. nomius nrrl  <dig> contains a single mat1- <dig> idiomorph. this schematic diagram for the mating-type locus of nrrl  <dig> shows the orientation and physical distance shared among the mat1- <dig> idiomorph and the adjacent upstream and downstream genes. the black vertical line in the mat1- <dig> arrow represents the approximate location of a 52 bp intron

fig.  <dig> phylogeny for mat1- <dig> idiomorphs of various aspergillus species reveals patterns of ancestry for this locus. a maximum likelihood phylogeny was inferred for the mat1- <dig> gene of six aspergillus species . also included is an amino acid alignment of the mat1- <dig> gene for the same six species that was generated using clustal-w . beneath each column are characters that relate to the level of conservation in amino acid substitutions among the different species. an asterisk  indicates that an identical amino acid residue exists for all species examined; a colon  indicates that at least one highly conserved amino acid substitution exists; a period  indicates that at least one semi-conserved substitution exists; and no character indicates that at least one un-conserved amino acid substitution exists. the black inverted arrow indicates the location of a 52 bp intron separating the two coding regions that comprise the mat1- <dig> gene in these organisms



within section flavi, comparison of the a. nomius amino acid sequence with other mat1- <dig> idiomorphs revealed 79 % identity to a. alliaceus and 91 % identity to both a. flavus and a. parasiticus . of the  <dig> amino acids aligned, 34 % were conserved, 32 % involved semi-conserved substitutions, and 34 % involved non-synonymous substitutions. the maximum likelihood  tree, inferred from the mat1- <dig> amino acid alignment of six aspergillus species, shows homothallic e. nidulans to be more basal to the other species, with homothallic a. alliaceus being the basal organism to a. nomius. however, this inference was based on a single locus. aspergillus alliaceus was not included in our phylogenomic analysis because its genome has yet to be sequenced, so it is unknown whether or not this species would maintain its basal position compared to the rest of section flavi.

perhaps the evolutionary relationship of homothallic and heterothallic breeding systems can be inferred from this ml tree. for example, the mat1- <dig> ancestor to heterothallic aspergilli diverged from e. nidulans and its remnant locus organization can be found in a. alliaceus, the only known aspergillus species for which both mat idiomorphs are adjacent to one other at a single locus  <cit> . interestingly, a. nomius strains that have the mat1-1/mat1- <dig> genotype are capable of bisexuality  <cit> , but the chromosomal positioning of their mat locus/loci has yet to be determined. most strains of a. flavus and a. parasiticus are of a single mating type; however, some strains have been discovered to contain both genes  although only one of them is functional . aspergillus nomius strain nrrl  <dig> contains only the mat1- <dig> gene, yet other strains have been discovered that contain both idiomorphs although incapable of self-fertilization  <cit> . mapping the mating-type locus/loci in a bisexual strain of a. nomius, for comparison to other mat1-1/mat1- <dig> strains, as well as inter-specific mating tests between a. nomius and closely-related species, should also be undertaken.

CONCLUSIONS
many avenues remain to be explored regarding this aflatoxigenic fungus. aspergillus nomius appears to be the ancestral aflatoxigenic species based on genomic comparisons to other section flavi. future genomic comparisons should include more species within section flavi as well as expand beyond section flavi to encompass other aflatoxin-producing aspergilli. further comparisons are warranted for a. nomius strains that thrive in distinct ecological niches and that exhibit genomic differences. by elucidating its ecological, evolutionary and genomic differences, we may finally understand the reasons for speciation of other aflatoxigenic species as well as the purpose for aflatoxin production.
