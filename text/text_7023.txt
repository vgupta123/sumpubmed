BACKGROUND
genetic maps and markers are integral to plant improvement strategies being developed and applied in agricultural genomics. these tools enable trait mapping, marker-assisted selection, genetic resource assessment, comparative genetics, and characterisation of genome evolution and organisation  <cit> .

white clover  is a temperate perennial forage legume widely used in pastoral systems. the species produces high quality herbage, hosts rhizobia bacteria that transform atmospheric nitrogen into plant available forms, exhibits compatibility and persistence in mixed species pastures, and contributes to soil quality  <cit> . propagated sexually by seed and asexually by stolons, it is an outcrossing disomic tetraploid  with abundant sequence polymorphism and highly heterogeneous populations  <cit> . white clover progenitors are putatively identified as the diploid species t. occidentale and t. pallescens <cit> . the white clover genome is moderately compact, estimated at  <dig> mb , with high sequence similarity in orthologous genic regions within homoeologous pairs  <cit> .

minor agricultural species, such as white clover, often lag in the development of genomics resources. a range of marker platforms is now available, and the choice among systems is influenced by genome structure, reproductive biology of the species, and consideration of development costs, scale and system efficiency. targeting marker discovery to specific genome fractions can influence the effectiveness of a marker resource. markers in low copy number genic regions, such as expressed sequence tag -derived sources are more likely to be associated with polymorphisms conferring trait effects and are preferred in agricultural plants, however these markers generally exhibit reduced rates of polymorphism  <cit> . methylation-filtration targets genomic sequence surveys to genic regions, providing gene-rich marker discovery data  <cit> . as a marker development resource, these sequences share the gene-associated benefits of est-derived sequence data and the higher polymorphism rate of genomic-derived sequence data. methyl-filtered sequences are also free from bias created by enriching or screening genomic libraries for specific simple sequence repeat  motifs, or using expressed sequence data from specific tissues or plant growth stages.

marker development from targeted sequence can identify polymorphism based on sequence identity  or length, such as ssr arrays. in the absence of reference genomes for white clover and progenitors, homoeologous sequence similarity in genic regions hinders development of an efficient snp discovery process. this is predominantly due to a high proportion of putative snp markers in silico arising from conflation of orthologous sequence within homoeologous pairs  <cit> . reference sequence from progenitor species  <cit>  partially overcomes this limitation  <cit> , however snp discovery and utilisation in white clover remains a challenge.

polymorphisms in candidate gene  sequence offer markers with potential functional effects to enrich maps and advance the genetic dissection of some traits  <cit> . although a relatively laborious process, sequencing cgs can be used to identify haplotypes and overcome the limitations of in silico snp discovery experienced in sequence databases  <cit> .

markers using ssr polymorphism are a co-dominant system that is proven, transportable, amenable to semi-automated assay, moderately cost-effective, and scalable. ssr markers have been used in a number of applications in plant improvement  <cit> , and are estimated to occur at a density of one per  <dig>  kb in transcribed regions of the white clover genome  <cit> . four independent genetic linkage maps of varying completeness and quality based on trifolium ssr markers have been published in white clover  <cit> . quantitative and qualitative trait maps have also been developed  <cit> , and some effort has been made to identify homoeologue sets based on sequence data from the putative progenitor species t. occidentale <cit> . large mapped  <cit>  and unmapped  <cit>  sets of white clover ssr markers have been made publicly available to augment three small sets of mapped ssr markers  <cit> . in addition, substantial marker and linkage map resources in red clover   <cit>  have been applied in white clover and t. subterraneum for comparative mapping  <cit> . at present, white clover maps have not been integrated across populations. marker order is also insufficiently resolved among published maps, and homoeologue-specific markers are not available. as a result, only superficial comparisons among independent mapping populations have occurred, and homoeologue matching and integration has not been achieved. in other species, integration of independent mapping populations has enhanced genetic resolution and provided comprehensive relational locus information for disparate marker and population resources  <cit> . furthermore, availability of homoeologue-specific markers to the wider white clover research community would provide a valuable resource for data alignment across populations and research groups.

the trifolieae forage legume model medicago truncatula, with links to the wider legume phyla community and other agricultural crops  <cit> , is of primary interest in white clover comparative genetics. in silico referencing of white clover to m. truncatula has identified macrosyntenic relationships maintained between these two species  <cit> , supported by evidence from mapped comparative markers  <cit> . this has led to the medicago chromosomal nomenclature replacing the initial trifolium nomenclature of barrett et al.  <cit> .

the objectives of this research were to: establish an integrated genetic linkage map of the white clover genome based on linkage analysis in two independent f <dig> mapping populations; develop candidate gene-targeted markers for traits of interest as a platform for functional markers and to aid genome alignment with other species; identify homoeologue-specific markers; document a comprehensive set of mapped white clover microsatellite markers; and enrich the in silico alignment between trifolium repens and medicago truncatula.

RESULTS
ssr marker discovery
white clover end sequence data from  <dig>  methyl-filtered genomic dna clones were assembled to generate a genethresher® database  containing  <dig>  unique sequence segments plus consensus assembly sequences. the mean sequence length was  <dig> nucleotides. assembly revealed  <dig>  contigs and an estimated non-redundant sequence of  <dig> mb, equating to an estimated 30% of the white clover genome’s non-methylated fraction. a sequence homology query of the tigr eukaryote orthologous set indicated trgt contains  <dig>  unique genes.

ssr arrays meeting minimum criteria were identified prior to contig assembly in  <dig>  singleton sequences in trgt, which comprise  <dig> % of the database sequences. primer pairs meeting design criteria were identified for  <dig> of the arrays including  <dig> di-,  <dig> tri-,  <dig> tetra-,  <dig> penta- and  <dig> hexanucleotide ssr motif arrays . the number of ssr repeat units per array ranged from a truncated lower threshold of five up to  <dig>  with a mode of eight .

primer pairs for  <dig> trgt-ssrs, including  <dig> di-,  <dig> tri-,  <dig> tetra-,  <dig> penta- and  <dig> hexanucleotide ssr motif arrays were synthesised and tested. of these,  <dig>  generated discrete amplicons resolved by capillary electrophoresis following pcr at design parameters. mean realised amplicon size was 103% of that predicted in silico.

marker genotyping and linkage analysis
screening revealed a subset of  <dig> trgt-ssrs polymorphic in the parents of population mp <dig>  their primers and trgt singleton sequences from which they were derived are disclosed in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. these ssrs, plus one morphological marker ,  <dig> candidate gene markers ,  <dig> ‘ats’ genomic ssrs and  <dig> ‘prs’ est-ssrs, identified  <dig> polymorphic features when genotyped in the mp <dig> population. this included  <dig> loci polymorphic in the maternal parent,  <dig> loci polymorphic in the paternal parent, and  <dig> loci polymorphic in both parents. the mp <dig> mapping data were resolved by linkage analysis into sixteen linkage groups in two homoeologous sets and spanned  <dig> cm. linkage groups contained  <dig> to  <dig> marker loci and ranged in length from  <dig> to  <dig> cm .

eighteen candidate genes related to plant morphology, chemical composition, or transcription regulation were evaluated by in silico analysis. primers were designed from t. repens genomic sequence, and length polymorphisms were assayed in  <dig> members of population mp <dig> using intron-spanning pcr for all loci except tranr and trstp, which were assayed by snp and exon size variation, respectively. tr lg=white clover linkage group; mt pm=medicago truncatula genome assembly  <dig>  pseudomolecule; ref=cited reference; no hit=not found in m. truncatula databases and n/i=no intron in this gene. note that bac ac <dig> is not incorporated into the m. truncatula assembly.

the  <dig> candidate gene markers mapped to  <dig> discrete loci, with only marker trppd identifying homoeoloci in group  <dig>  many of the candidate genes generated additional amplicons which were monomorphic; these may represent homoeoloci and paralogues. fourteen of the candidate gene markers generated amplicons of the approximate size predicted in silico , three were substantially larger , and one  was smaller . markers derived from different introns of the shatterproof <dig> gene  mapped to the same locus . the rf locus was polymorphic in parent  <dig> , and mapped to linkage group 8- <dig> 

although derived from unrelated populations and distinct marker sources, the linkage maps of mp <dig>  and mp <dig>  <cit>  revealed a similar view of the white clover genome in terms of shared marker order and linkage group size . improved map statistics were observed for mp <dig>  and were a reflection of the 49% increase in marker loci and 39% increase in marker density relative to mp <dig> 

mp <dig> is the map published by barrett et al.  <cit> ; mp <dig> is based on linkage analysis of  <dig> individuals from the pair cross of heterozygous genotypes  <dig> dc and  <dig> . im = the linkage map integrated from consensus maps in populations mp <dig> and mp <dig>  the integrated map consists of  <dig> loci including gene-targeted microsatellites, candidate gene markers, and the morphological marker rf. estimated = estimated maximum map length in each linkage group ]; method  <dig> of chakravarti et al.  <cit> . sem = standard error of the mean. genome coverage = observed map length/estimated map length according to sekino and hara  <cit> .

multi-population parental consensus map integration
linkage group matching between populations prior to developing the integrated map  required placement of additional ‘prs’ and ‘gtrs’ markers common to both mp <dig> and mp <dig>  the aim was to enrich linkage groups to achieve a joining  locus density < <dig> cm per joining locus. numbers of joining markers per group ranged from three  to  <dig>  with a mean of  <dig>  . genotyping of these additional markers in mp <dig> facilitated resolution of linkage group  <dig> , the order of which was insufficiently resolved in the original map of this population.

data are from mapping populations mp <dig>  <cit>  and mp <dig>  based on analysis of  <dig> shared marker loci. markers polymorphic in both mp <dig> and mp <dig> were used to match and align homoeologues based on marker loci that were single locus homoeologue-specific . additional support for homoeologue matching was provided by comparison of allele size of non-single locus shared marker loci. of the allele size loci, some indicated an alternative matching that was a mismatch to the maximum parsimony allele-size homoeologue alignment, and others did not provide conclusive support for either alignment combination and were designated as ambiguous. in all cases, homoeologue alignment based on shared marker allele size was corroborated by the sl-hs alignment data.

inter-population homoeologue matches were based primarily on single locus, homoeologue-specific  markers. these markers, identified from ssrs exhibiting single locus segregation patterns in mp <dig>  had been screened further against a panel of  <dig> individuals including the parents of mp <dig> and  <dig> diverse genotypes from cultivars and ecotypes. markers that amplified a maximum of two alleles per individual across the entire panel were designated sl-hs  and then genotyped in mp <dig> to provide homoeologue-specific joining loci. in all cases where multiple independent sl-hs markers mapped in both mp <dig> and mp <dig> populations, marker order and relative positions were consistent across populations. there were no instances where multiple sl-hs markers mapped to a single homoeologue in one population then mapped to separate homoeologues in the other population, which would have been classed as a mismatch . presence of multiple sl-hs loci supported matching  <dig> of the  <dig> inter-population homoeologue pairs . matching of one inter-population pair of linkage groups to form an im linkage group identified by default the other inter-population homoeologue match. multiple sl-hs loci, therefore, identified all inter-population homoeologue groups to be integrated except for im 5- <dig> and 5- <dig>  where the match relied on a single sl-hs marker in 5- <dig> .

additional independent evidence for matched homoeologues between populations was provided by commonality of allele size or allele size range of the mapped joining loci. ssr primer pairs often generated sets of amplicons of contrasting size ranges; those in one size range mapping to a homoeologue, and those in the other size range mapping to the other homoeologue, or elsewhere in the genome, or were uninformative in that population. allele size, therefore, could be evidence supporting homoeologue matching between populations. each linkage group from mp <dig> was aligned with either of the two potential homoeologues in mp <dig> and assessed for joining locus allele size similarity. there were multiple joining loci per potential inter-population homoeologous pair and not all size-matching loci were consistent in identifying which homoeologues should be aligned. in any pairing, joining loci suggesting an alignment with a homoeologue could be flanked by joining loci suggesting the other homoeologue. inter-population homoeologue alignment using allele size  was, therefore, derived from identifying the homoeologue pairing that maximised the number of joining loci in agreement with the alignment  while minimising the number of joining loci at variance with the alignment . in some cases, the allele size ranges overlapped and were therefore not definitive for homoeologue identification. these were classed as ambiguous loci .

the allele size-based inter-population homoeologue alignments were made before analysis of the sl-hs markers, and in all cases sl-hs data corroborated the pairings indicated by maximised allele size agreement data. of the homoeologue alignments, only group 5– <dig> relied on a single sl-hs locus; however, it was supported by seven allele size matching loci with only two mismatches .

upon integration of all matched homoeologues, the resulting im included  <dig> molecular and morphological markers identifying  <dig> independent loci spanning  <dig> cm . the map covered an estimated 97% of the genome, with mean length of  <dig> cm and  <dig> marker loci per linkage group . numbers of marker loci per linkage group ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  and linkage groups ranged in length from  <dig> to  <dig> cm . differences in observed linkage group length within each homoeologous pair ranged from 1% for group  <dig> up to 21% for group  <dig>  the map was of moderate density, with a mean of  <dig>  cm per locus.

map saturation analysis using mean marker density in the im estimated that 82% of the genome was within  <dig> cm of a marker locus, which increased to 100% at  <dig> cm. this is an increase from mp <dig> and mp <dig> at 67% and 55%, respectively, for  <dig> cm coverage. substantive gaps of  <dig> cm on group 1- <dig> and of  <dig> cm on group 5- <dig> were present in each source population and remained after the map integration.

of the  <dig> markers in the im,  <dig> identified loci on homoeologous groups, including 30% of est-ssr and 24% of trgt-ssr primer pairs. a further  <dig> multi-locus ssrs mapped to non-homoeologous loci. ssr marker loci were generally not clustered by sequence source , suggesting genethresher® and est data are derived from throughout the genome.

there was no evidence of substantive chromosomal rearrangements or re-ordering of marker loci between homoeologues in im, indicating conservation of homoeologous macrosynteny within this disomic tetraploid . there were, however, minor differences which may be artefacts of linkage analysis or indicative of localised inversions .

segregation distortion
eight percent of loci in mp <dig> and mp <dig> showed segregation distortion, largely restricted to discrete regions of the genome. the specific site of distortion was generally population-specific, except groups 3- <dig> and 4- <dig> which showed distortion in both populations . mp <dig> distortion was derived predominantly from the female parent and was particularly high with a maximum chi square  probability p-value threshold of  in groups 1- <dig>  4- <dig> and 5- <dig> . in contrast, segregation ratios in mp <dig> were less distorted with a maximum p-value threshold of p< <dig> , and were derived in similar proportion from both parents .

in silico genome alignment
the in silico alignment of the im to assembly version  <dig>  of the medicago truncatula genome revealed  <dig> hits at an e-value threshold of 1e- <dig> for  <dig> t. repens mapped marker query sequences. mean alignment span for the  <dig> hits was  <dig> bp with a mean e-value of  <dig> e- <dig>  there were similar values for ests and trgt sequences. inspection revealed 81% of the aligned sequences followed a linear pattern of macrosyntenic alignment with consistent coverage of m. truncatula hits across most of the t. repens genome . the remaining 19% were more widely scattered . the alignment supports relating the t. repens nomenclature of barrett et al.  <cit>  with m. truncatula  groups as follows: mt- <dig> = e with  <dig> hits; mt- <dig> = a with  <dig> hits; mt- <dig> = d with  <dig> hits; mt- <dig> = g with  <dig> hits; mt- <dig> = c with  <dig> hits; and mt- <dig> = b with  <dig> hits. groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> as presented in barrett et al.  <cit>  were inverted in t. repens relative to m. truncatula; in figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and additional file  <dig> they have been matched with the m. truncatula orientation. relative to m. truncatula, there may be short inversions within white clover groups  <dig>   <dig> and 8; however these may be artefacts of constraints in linkage analysis or genome assembly.

trifolium repens groups f and h, in the barrett et al.  <cit>  nomenclature, revealed a complex relationship with the m. truncatula genome. group f had  <dig> hits on mt- <dig> and three on mt-6; group h had  <dig> hits on mt- <dig> and six on mt- <dig>  moreover, group h had an even distribution of in silico hits to m. truncatula along the length of the group  whereas group f had poor in silico alignment to m. truncatula with large gaps flanking loci marked by prs <dig> and ats <dig> accounting for 47% of group f . this was the only t. repens linkage group with large regions with no in silico alignment to m. truncatula. the segment  at the top of group f  had a dense contiguous alignment spanning the initial 28% of mt- <dig> . the bottom segment of group f  contained three hits located in the top segment of mt- <dig>  most of group h   aligned with and spanned the bottom half of the mt- <dig> pseudomolecule . there was an approximately  <dig> cm gap between loci prs <dig> and prs <dig>  indicating a translocation where the remainder of h  aligned with mt- <dig>  this alignment comprised three contiguous hits covering the top 14% of mt- <dig> then a separate set of three contiguous hits that aligned with the bottom segment of mt- <dig> .

discussion
in the first linkage map integration across independent mapping populations in white clover, we present a comprehensive analysis of the white clover genome, based on ssr and candidate gene markers aligned to the medicago genome, with a set of mapped molecular markers made available for the research community. this map provides markers enabling homoeologue matching among populations, and thoroughly resolves all linkage groups. furthermore, the integrated map is a robust composite assessment of the white clover genome, being derived from component linkage maps that reveal very similar data in terms of marker order, genome arrangement and map size; despite being based on dissimilar populations and distinct marker sources. this work complements prior genetic linkage maps  <cit> , recent trait-focused studies  <cit> , and enriches prior macrosyntenic alignments of t. repens with medicago <cit> .

microsatellite discovery
this integrated map is anchored by gene-targeted ssr markers mined from a white clover genethresher®  genomic dna sequence and from ests. est-derived markers exhibit less polymorphism, but have a higher probability of being directly linked to a causative gene than genomic ssrs  <cit> . repeat number in est-ssrs is usually low and a predominance of trinucleotide motifs is explained by changes in other common motif lengths causing frame shifts disrupting coding sequence  <cit> . the white clover est-ssr source had a preponderance of trinucleotide motifs and a mode of four repeats per array  <cit> , whereas the methyl-filtered trgt source was predominately dinucleotides motifs, with a mode of eight repeats. only 71% of est-derived ssrs produced pcr products  <cit> , compared with 86%  <cit>  and 92% from array targeted white clover genomic libraries  <cit>  and from trgt-derived ssrs in this study. intron presence may affect the efficiency of generating amplicons from expressed sequence sourced ssrs, as well as influencing the observed versus predicted amplicon size. mean observed amplicon size of white clover est-derived ssrs was 128% of the size predicted in silico <cit> , compared with 103% for trgt-derived ssrs. reduced amplification efficiency attributed to m <dig> primer-based fluorophore addition  <cit>  has been demonstrated  <cit> , suggesting that more than 92% of the trgt-derived ssr primer pairs are viable.

literature on efficiency of ssr mining from genethresher® methyl-filtered sequence is scarce. gill and co-authors  <cit>  reported  <dig> % of sequenced genethresher® clones from perennial ryegrass contained ssr arrays. this contrasts with  <dig> % of white clover sequences in the present study, and 7% of est-derived sequences in barrett et al.  <cit> . a species-related difference in array density has not been noted in other libraries, and may be a unique feature of the genethresher® system interaction with genome size, or other factors. the ssr array density in white clover genethresher® and est sequences are both higher than in a genomic sequence of bac end surveys  <cit> .

while blast results suggest methyl-filtration enriched for genic regions of the white clover genome, 61% of the ssrs were dinucleotide motif repeats. these values agree with genomic dna surveys in which 48-67% of ssrs found among a range of species are dinucleotides  <cit> . inspection of the trgt database revealed most dinucleotide motif ssrs to be near but outside open reading frames  and therefore unlikely to disrupt coding sequences with changes in array length. the increase in ssr array length and polymorphism detected by trgt-ssrs relative to est-ssrs also suggests they are from non-coding sequence.

while ssr polymorphism reflects the breeding system and diversity of the subject species, previous studies have shown that genomic ssrs are more informative than est-ssrs  <cit> . this is supported by the contrast of white clover trgt-ssrs with the est-ssr resource of barrett et al.  <cit>  where a greater proportion of trgt-ssrs were polymorphic, and more alleles per polymorphic primer were identified.

linkage mapping and multi-population map integration
development of this integrated genetic linkage map relied on parental consensus maps from two unrelated, independent full-sib populations. furthermore, while these maps were based predominantly on discrete marker sources and mp <dig> had a greater number of marker loci  and density  relative to mp <dig>  both maps revealed largely similar views of the genome. there was only a 10% increase in map length from  <dig> cm to  <dig> cm for parental consensus maps of mp <dig> and mp <dig>  respectively. this indicates most of the recombinogenic genome is mapped and was supported by the high genome coverage calculations, which improved after map integration . the im increases estimated genome coverage to 97%, relative to the prior 95%  based mainly on genethresher®-derived ssrs, 94%  by barrett et al.  <cit>  using est-ssrs and 87% by zhang et al.  <cit>  which relied primarily on red clover  ssrs. particular features of mp <dig> and the integrated map are improved resolution of group  <dig>  and extension of homoeologous group  <dig>  as compared to barrett et al.  <cit> . both trgt and est marker sets show generalised distribution through the genetic linkage space, indicating both are suitable sources for further marker enrichment of targeted map regions.

further evidence of the robustness of the assessment of genomic structure provided by these linkage analyses is the consistency of map length and the relative positions of joining loci between the two source maps presented here, as well as unpublished maps developed in our laboratory for both t. repens and the diploid progenitor, t. occidentale. there are no markers in common between im and the incomplete genome map of jones et al.  <cit> , but the trait-focused parental maps of casey et al.  <cit>  and wang et al.  <cit>  exhibit regions of general marker order alignment with ‘ats’ and ‘prs’ markers common to im. map length is more difficult to compare due to the partial genome coverage of those maps. in contrast, comparative analysis and alignment to the map presented by zhang et al.  <cit>  of ‘ats’ and ‘prs’ markers in common with im, indicates significant differences in marker placement both within and among linkage groups. furthermore, the zhang et al.  <cit>  map is distinguished by a 47% increase in map length to  <dig> cm, relative to the  <dig> cm of im. the recent white clover linkage map  <cit> , based on a combination of white clover, red clover and medicago truncatula-derived ssrs, also exhibits a marked inflation  in total map length to  <dig> cm relative to im. comparative alignment based on common ‘ats’ and prs’ markers also indicates regions on that map with notable divergence in marker placement relative to im, particularly linkage groups 2a and 2b  <cit> .

care was taken in matching homoeologues between the consensus maps of mp <dig> and mp <dig> in the map integration, including use of homoeologue-specific ssr markers and allele size matching . there is, however, insufficient information in marker and sequence resources to accurately assign linkage groups from this map to progenitor genomes identified by williams and colleagues  <cit>  and tentatively annotated o and p’ <cit> . as additional sequence resources become available, this integrated map and marker resource is expected to accelerate the process of linkage group assignment into homoeologous sets, matching sets to progenitor genomes, and exploration of genome evolution within the genus trifolium.

candidate genes
mapping candidate genes places genes putatively associated with traits of interest on linkage maps. these mapped genes may provide functional markers associated with regions of the genome with a significant effect on trait phenotype, as has been shown in medicago <cit> , and may be deployed in marker-assisted breeding. markers derived from two introns of the shatterproof <dig> gene  provided an internal control for the intron polymorphism methodology for candidate gene mapping, and mapped to the same locus . while trppd was the only candidate gene to be mapped in both homoeologues, many of the other genes exhibited additional amplicons that were not informative in the mapping population suggesting they may have loci elsewhere in the genome, including other homoeologues and paralogues. placement of candidate genes also enables comparative mapping, for example, leafy  maps to a locus at similar positions in group  <dig> of our integrated trifolium map and in medicago <cit> .

segregation distortion
segregation distortion was confined to discrete regions of the genome in both mp <dig> and mp <dig>  most of which were population-specific  and characterised by flanking markers exhibiting progressive distortion decay with distance from the peak. zhang et al.  <cit>  also identified discrete regions of segregation distortion, although several individual distorted loci were closely flanked by non-distorted loci without the characteristic distortion decay. in contrast, isobe et al.  <cit>  documented segregation distortion across much of the white clover genome. it is difficult to accurately align regions of segregation distortion in the parental consensus maps of mp <dig> and mp <dig> with the maps of zhang et al.  <cit>  and isobe et al.  <cit>  due to discrepancies in marker order where there are ssrs in common. alignment with the map of casey et al.  <cit> , in which the white clover s locus that regulates self-incompatibility was mapped to the top of a homoeologue of group  <dig>  was straightforward as it contains marker loci in common order. in particular, a single locus homoeologue-specific ssr  near the s locus  <cit>  enables homoeologue matching with mp <dig>  and places the s locus at the top of mp <dig> 1- <dig>  which also exhibits strong segregation distortion in the same region . this highlights the value of sharing marker resources to facilitate correspondence of marker and phenotype information across populations, and localises the s locus to t. repens lg 1- <dig>  mp <dig> has no segregation distortion on this homoeologue which may be explained by mp <dig> parents having compatible s alleles at this locus. both mp <dig> and mp <dig> share a region of segregation distortion on 4- <dig> and while white clover is regarded as having a single locus self-incompatibility system  <cit> , the distribution of distortion raises the question of what other loci may influence segregation in these conditions for this species.

in silico genome alignment
the in silico alignment between t. repens and m. truncatula revealed a general case of co-linearity, and identified an inter-chromosomal rearrangement where mt- <dig> and - <dig> were split across tr- <dig> and - <dig>  as first described by griffiths et al.  <cit> . furthermore, orientation of t. repens relative to m. truncatula was clear in which groups  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , as oriented in barrett et al.  <cit> , were inverted relative to m. truncatula and reflected that of griffiths et al.  <cit> . groups  <dig>  and  <dig>  were correctly orientated relative to m. truncatula. comparison with m. truncatula suggests short inversions compared with white clover groups  <dig>   <dig> and 8; however it is not known if these are authentic or are artefacts of constraints in linkage analysis or genome assembly. this is also the first in silico alignment of tr- <dig> , based on the improved marker order and numbers in the integrated map compared with barrett et al.  <cit> . tr- <dig>  was the only t. repens linkage group with large regions with no in silico alignment to m. truncatula. this suggests tr- <dig> either has large regions without homology to m. truncatula, or regions of m. truncatula with homology to actively transcribed regions of the t. repens genome have yet to be sequenced. candidate genes, however, matched expected macrosyntenic sites between trifolium and medicago in all cases, including the group 2/ <dig> translocation as annotated. when considered in totality, this in silico comparative analysis confirms a general state of co-linearity between t. repens and m. truncatula. this extent of alignment suggests the medicago genome can be used as a reference to estimate genome locations of unmapped sequence, and is further supported by evidence of micro co-linearity  <cit> .

while the split of mt- <dig> across tr- <dig> and − <dig> was clear, determining which of t. repens groups  <dig>  and  <dig>  had greatest co-linearity with mt- <dig> was less so. our data suggest that t. repens group h aligns more extensively with mt- <dig>  although this may only be resolved after development and alignment with a t. repens genome assembly. for consistency, however, the published  <cit>  syntenic assignments of mt- <dig> = f and mt- <dig> = h are maintained. this split of medicago group  <dig> across t. repens groups  <dig>  and  <dig>  is a key feature of the in silico alignment. according to a phylogeny of the legume vicioid clade  <cit> , three general groupings, one comprising medicago and ononis, another trifolium and melilotus, and another pisum, lathyrus, and vicia, had diverged from a more ancestral cicer arietinum . detailed comparative analysis of members of these groupings with medicago shows the group  <dig> split is a feature of t. repens, vicia faba <cit> , and pisum sativum <cit> . in contrast, there is no such split between medicago and cicer arietinum <cit> , indicating that medicago group  <dig> may represent the ancestral condition that has since undergone rearrangement during evolution of derived phyla including trifolium.

in contrast to mt- <dig> and the other m. truncatula pseudomolecules, determining alignment of mt- <dig> with t. repens was more difficult. this was due to the paucity of matches between mt- <dig> and t. repens; a total of  <dig> hits compared to a mean of  <dig> hits each for other medicago groups aligned with t. repens. while mt- <dig> has approximately half the sequence data of other medicago groups , the very low number of in silico matches between mt- <dig> and multiple t. repens sequence sources is not a surprise for several reasons. mt- <dig> is atypical of the other mt chromosomes as it contains an over-representation of resistance gene analogues and leucine rich repeats  <cit> , the greatest proportion of heterochromatin  <cit> , and a corresponding under-representation of randomly selected and mapped est markers  <cit> . furthermore, comparative alignment with other legumes reveals mt- <dig> to have reduced marker-based synteny  <cit> . since the t. repens alignment with m. truncatula was based predominantly on exome-derived sequence, reduced synteny with the low gene density mt- <dig> is not unexpected and may explain the in silico alignment gap identified in tr- <dig>  the full relationship with mt- <dig> may only be resolved after development and alignment with a t. repens genome assembly.

the in silico alignment in this and a previous study  <cit> , used an e-value threshold of 1e- <dig> for identifying significant blastn matches. reducing stringency to <1e- <dig> in our analysis revealed numerous spurious matches, often to multiple regions in the medicago genome . a similar study by george et al.  <cit> , using a subset of the data from griffiths et al.  <cit> , derived an in silico m. truncatula:t. repens alignment at the <1e- <dig> threshold. while the general patterns of alignment were conserved, the reduced data set and low threshold may have prevented george et al.  <cit>  from determining orientation of t. repens relative to m. truncatula for groups f , g , and h . evidence was also presented for a translocation of a terminal segment of mt- <dig> to mt- <dig>  <cit> , however there is no evidence for this translocation in the current or previous studies  <cit> , which are augmented significantly by the full est-ssr dataset, and trgt-ssrs. furthermore, there is no evidence in our study of a general breakdown in group  <dig> synteny as there is a well-supported macrosyntenic relationship along the length of the groups, with a short inversion of tr- <dig> relative to mt- <dig> at the top end that may be an artefact of linkage analysis. again, the full relationship between these two species may only be resolved after development and alignment of a t. repens genome assembly with medicago and other legume genomes.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report of integration of independent linkage maps in white clover, and adds to the literature on the utility of methyl filtered genethresher®-derived microsatellite markers for linkage map development. a genethresher® methyl-filtered gene-targeted ssr marker linkage map  was generated and merged with an earlier est-ssr-based consensus genetic map of an independent population . integration required development of homoeologue identifiers to generate the first multi-population integrated map of this disomic tetraploid genome. the integrated map  includes  <dig> loci with a total genetic length of  <dig> cm, covering an estimated 97% of the genome, and a moderate density of one locus every  <dig>  cm. despite being derived from disparate populations and distinct marker sources, the component maps , and the subsequent im, provide a consistent and comprehensive view of the white clover genome in terms of marker order and linkage group size. the mapped marker resource, particularly the homoeologue identifiers, provides a vehicle for aligning mapping and quantitative trait loci  among the forage legume research community, as shown by the ability to align the s self-incompatibility locus described by casey et al.  <cit>  with a region of segregation distortion in mp <dig>  in silico comparative analysis at an e-value threshold of 1e- <dig> revealed a high degree of co-linearity with the medicago truncatula genome, and a translocation between t. repens groups  <dig> and  <dig> relative to m. truncatula. this provides a platform for comparative mapping and utilising the m. truncatula genome to assist in clover trait dissection and candidate gene discovery. this work will enable ongoing research in genetic architecture of traits, comparative genetics, genomics, and marker-aided breeding using a mapped marker resource cross-validated in independent mapping populations and aligned to a model forage legume genome.
