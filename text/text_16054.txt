BACKGROUND
the formation of memory requires highly orchestrated gene expression programs for the establishment and the stabilization of memory traces over time. these programs are initiated during learning and can persist for several hours  <cit> . whole genome expression studies have shown that some of these programs are needed for basal homeostatic cellular functions, while others are specific for cognitive functions  <cit> . the composition and regulation of transcriptional programs however may depend on the strength and duration of training. its well known, for example, that practice or repeated training of a skill or concept can improve memory for the subject. multiple training sessions required to form strong memory traces may, therefore, be associated with increased gene expression or the reinforcement of existing transcriptional programs, such as those necessary for structural changes to strengthen synaptic circuits  <cit> . how this is induced at the level of chromatin and which genes are targeted by epigenetic processes remains poorly understood.

with the emergence of the post-genomic era, recent studies in the field of learning and memory have investigated the implication of chromatin remodeling in cognitive processes. several studies have revealed that chromatin remodeling plays a critical role in memory formation  <cit> . chromatin remodeling is a complex molecular and structural process that involves the dynamic regulation of nucleosomes through different epigenetic mechanisms including histone posttranslational modifications , dna methylation and rna interference  <cit> . in the rodent brain, several histone ptms are rapidly induced and are associated with altered gene transcription following training. acetylation of lysine  <dig> and  <dig> on h <dig> , of lysine  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> on h <dig> , and of lysine  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> on h2b , increases in the hippocampus following contextual fear conditioning   <cit> , a well-established behavioral paradigm for the establishment of contextual fear memory. moreover, inhibition of histone deacetylases  by hdac inhibitors such as suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid , sodium butyrate, valproic acid or trichostatin a can enhance memory and rescue deficits in contextual memory in rodents  <cit> .

although these studies provide strong evidence that histone acetylation is modulated by memory formation, a global assessment of histone acetylation at the level of the genome and the mechanism with which it regulates gene expression in memory processes is lacking. using a genome-wide approach, we examined the distribution of h4k5ac, a mark of active chromatin implicated in transcriptional re-activation of post-mitotic cells through gene bookmarking  <cit> , and its role in regulating transcriptional activity following the establishment of contextual fear memory in the adult mouse  <cit> . we propose that gene bookmarking may also be relevant in the hippocampus following learning, whereby genes may be primed for rapid induction through activity-induced histone acetylation. using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing  and bioinformatics analysis, we show that h4k5ac in the hippocampus is prevalent throughout the genome and is a mark characteristic of actively transcribed genes. motif analysis for conserved transcription factor  binding sites , however, reveal that gene expression depends on the enrichment of h4k5ac at consensus tfbs in the promoter and proximal to the tss. we also identify a unique set of genes differentially acetylated for h4k <dig> and functionally associated with memory processes. based on our findings, we propose a potential mechanism for priming genes through activity-dependent hyperacetylation of h4k <dig> in the promoter upon learning.

RESULTS
fear memory induces h4k5ac in the hippocampus in a training-dependent manner
to examine the epigenetic and transcriptional profile of genes associated with memory formation in the hippocampus, we trained adult mice on a cfc paradigm . we chose cfc because it is a robust, long-lasting learning paradigm in which memory for a context can persist for more than one year after a single training session  <cit> . mice were exposed to a novel context in which they received a foot-shock, either once  or twice on two consecutive days , then tested for fear memory  <dig> hours later . after a single foot-shock, the animals expressed a significant freezing response  compared to control mice  that was maintained when tested  <dig> hours later  . however, with a second training session on day  <dig>  the freezing response was increased further by 20%  when tested  <dig> hours later . in control mice, freezing on days  <dig> and  <dig> compared to day  <dig>  was significant , but was not significant compared to day  <dig> , which is the measure by which we make all comparisons. it is also worth noting that control mice plateau on day  <dig> while fc mice continue to have higher freezing.

fc has been associated with transcriptional programs that are activated within  <dig> hour after conditioning, and that persist for up to  <dig> hours  <cit> . subsequent training, however, may increase gene expression, recruit additional genes to reinforce the memory, or prime existing transcriptional programs for rapid induction of genes for synaptic strengthening. since memory formation has been associated with histone acetylation in the brain, we examined whether memory performance correlates with higher acetylation levels following additional training sessions. we determined the level of h4k5ac, a ptm recently implicated in gene bookmarking, and increased with fc and object recognition memory tasks  <cit> , following one or two days of cfc. western blots show that h4k5ac was increased approximately 3-fold in the hippocampus  <dig> hour after one cfc session. with two conditioning sessions, h4k5ac level was increased  <dig> -fold over controls following a memory test on day  <dig> , suggesting that h4k5ac induction is proportionate to the amount of training. h4k5ac was examined  <dig> hour after memory test on day  <dig> because 1) gene expression is activated within  <dig> hour following fear conditioning and memory retrieval  <cit> , 2) memory is consolidated or reconsolidated within  <dig> hours  <cit> , 3) histone acetylation decreases to baseline levels within 2– <dig> hours  <cit> , 4) memory for the context is enhanced by an additional training session, and 5) h4k5ac levels are higher at this time point.

distribution of h4k5ac across the genome and within genes
previous studies have shown the association of histone acetylation at promoters of a restricted set of canonical genes involved in memory  <cit> , but to date, genome-wide data are limited. here, we used chip-seq to determine the distribution of h4k5ac across the genome, followed by de novo identification of genes associated with h4k5ac after cfc  in the mouse hippocampus.

analysis of h4k5ac distribution showed enrichment of reads in the promoter and coding sequence  of h4k5ac-chip samples compared to igg-ip samples in both fc  and controls , an increase of 19%  and  <dig> % , respectively. the targeted enrichment of h4k5ac to gene bodies is consistent with the proposed role of this ptm in transcriptional regulation. analysis of h4k5ac in genic regions revealed higher acetylation upstream of the transcription start site , spanning the cds and extending down to the transcription termination site  compared to igg-ip samples . specifically, there was a prominent peak of h4k5ac in the promoter region approximately  <dig> bp upstream of the tss, as well as in the cds  <dig> kb downstream of the tss. h4k5ac distribution was similarly enriched in the control group , suggesting that learning does not change the overall profile of this ptm in the hippocampus. igg-ip samples showed low coverage in both groups  and, thus, are appropriate input controls for h4k5ac-chip sequence reads.

to determine whether the observed profile was specific for h4k5ac, we compared it with h4k12ac, another histone ptm associated with fear memory, from a publicly available dataset  <cit> . although h4k5ac and h4k12ac datasets could not be directly compared due to the different cfc training protocols used, the increase of both h4k5ac and h4k12ac immediately following cfc and the higher levels of h4k5ac after two training sessions, suggest that histone acetylation is a consistent marker of memory formation. as with h4k5ac, our analysis of h4k12ac revealed a similar bimodal peak centered at the tss which was restricted to approximately ±  <dig> kb relative to the tss but did not extend into the cds and tts as with h4k5ac . moreover, h4k12ac had lower enrichment in the promoter than in the cds, in contrast to h4k5ac, which was largely enriched in the promoter. we were unable to compare h4k12ac controls, as chip-seq controls for sample and experimental conditions for h4k12ac were not available in the public release of this dataset. together, these data suggest different occupancy and potentially different modes of transcriptional regulation by h4k5ac and h4k12ac following learning  <cit> .

h4k5ac as a marker of actively transcribed genes in the adult hippocampus
we then examined the relationship between h4k5ac and gene transcription using a publicly available whole mouse genome microarray dataset  for gene expression immediately after cfc in the mouse hippocampus  <cit> . we reasoned that because gene expression occurs within  <dig> hour of both memory consolidation and reconsolidation  <cit> , this dataset was appropriate to determine the association between h4k5ac and global gene expression. the  <dig>  genes form the expression dataset were ranked by level of expression  in fc compared to naïve controls  and plotted against the average coverage of h4k5ac ±  <dig> kb relative to the tss. the level of gene expression was found to correlate to h4k5ac enrichment such that the highest expressed genes had the highest coverage for h4k5ac, while the least expressed genes had the lowest coverage . this applied to both groups regardless of training, suggesting that h4k5ac is a general feature of expressed genes. we also confirmed that h4k12ac correlated with the level of gene expression . there was no correlation between gene expression and igg-ip coverage . these results indicate a clear association between both h4k5ac and h4k12ac and gene expression.

we then identified genes acetylated above average and performed a cross-wise comparison between experimental groups. based on the average promoter read count of  <dig> in our dataset, we considered genes with more than  <dig> reads in the promoter as above average. from a total of  <dig>  genes in the dataset,  <dig>  genes were identified in the fc group, and  <dig>  genes in the control . using this criteria,  <dig> genes  were specific for fc,  <dig>  genes  were specific for control, and  <dig>  genes  were common to both groups. we then looked at whether genes with above average h4k5ac after  <dig> days of cfc were also associated with h4k12ac after one session of cfc. using an adjusted threshold of  <dig> reads in promoter due to the lower average coverage, approximately  <dig> reads in promoter, in the h4k12ac dataset, we identified  <dig>  unique genes with above average h4k12ac, of which  <dig>  genes  overlapped with genes with above average h4k5ac in fc, and  <dig>  genes  with above average h4k5ac in controls .  <dig>  genes overlapped all three groups using this criteria.

the results of these analyses extend our findings that in control conditions most nucleosomes are not only acetylated for h4k <dig> above the average of all genes, but are also acetylated for h4k <dig>  interestingly, nearly two-thirds of genes with above average h4k12ac after one session of cfc was found to overlap with above average h4k5ac after  <dig> days of cfc or context. this suggests that the same set of genes, associated with h4k12ac and induced immediately after cfc, may be upregulated following reinforced training, regardless of the associated histone acetylation used to identify the genes. it also suggests that the same set of genes may be activated after initial learning, during the formation of contextual fear memory, and after memory retrieval, independently of the cfc paradigm.

h4k5ac is associated with both promoter and coding regions
nucleosome occupancy studies have shown that acetylated and methylated histones are enriched in the promoter of highly expressed genes, but subsequently removed or replaced in the cds  <cit> . to investigate the positional effect of nucleosomes with h4k5ac on transcription, we clustered genes based on their acetylation profile ±  <dig> kb relative to the tss. five h4k5ac clusters were identified in fc: one in the cds , one with relatively no enrichment , and three in the promoter  . genes with h4k5ac that feature in either the promoter or the cds  constituted a larger proportion of highly expressed genes, while genes with relatively no enrichment  accounted for the largest proportion of genes with low expression . genes clustered for h4k5ac in controls had profiles and cluster contributions relative to expression comparable to fc . for h4k12ac-clustered genes, we obtained two in the promoter  and two in the cds , which contributed to a greater proportion of highly expressed genes compared to the non-enriched cluster  . in contrast, igg-ip-clustered genes, which were not enriched for h4k5ac, had equal distribution in low, moderate, and highly expressed genes, regardless of training or the histone mark . promoter, cds, and 3’-utr-associated genes correlated with h4k5ac and h4k12ac, with and without cfc, but did not correlate with igg-ip clusters .

these findings suggest that h4k5ac in the promoter and/or cds may be a feature of highly expressed genes. to validate this observation, we examined the profile of h4k5ac in sfi <dig> and phactr <dig>  two representative genes differentially acetylated for h4k5ac in cfc and involved in cell division in mitotic cells and in memory processes  <cit> , respectively . in sfi <dig>  phactr <dig>  and phactr <dig> splice variants, h4k5ac was targeted specifically to the cds  . for sfi <dig>  h4k5ac was also highly enriched in the adjacent cds of pisd-ps1/ <dig> , and downstream of the tts in an intergenic region preceding the cds of eif4enif <dig> . in contrast, the cds of eif4enif <dig> and drg <dig> showed dramatically lower h4k5ac. the overlap of h4k5ac in the cds of sfi <dig> and pisd-ps1/ <dig> translated to similar expression levels for sfi <dig>  and pisd-ps1/ <dig>  but not for eif4enif <dig>  or drg <dig> , which had lower enrichment for h4k5ac. for phactr <dig>  h4k5ac coverage was lower in intergenic and cds of neighboring genes zfp <dig>  sycp <dig>  and ppp1r3d . the effect of h4k5ac on gene expression was also clearly evident for phactr <dig>  and neighboring genes, zfp <dig> , sycp <dig> , and ppp1r3d , which show lower expression levels. this provides further evidence that the level of h4k5ac enrichment in the cds is directly proportional to the level of gene transcription.

tf binding sites proximal to the tss increase the statistical probability of h4k5ac-nucleosome occupancy in the promoter
we next examined whether high levels of gene expression associated with h4k5ac is linked to permissible tf binding. we scanned the promoter region  <dig> kb upstream of the tss for conserved tfbs, and computed the percentage of expressed genes with h4k5ac at that position . for expressed genes, the percentage of acetylated genes was significantly lower across all positions with a consensus tfbs compared to positions without a known tfbs. unexpressed genes accounted for approximately 20% of genes with h4k5ac. our assumption is that having a tfbs at a specific position, on average, increases the probability that tf binding occurs at that position relative to a random sequence position in the presence of h4k5ac. to refine our search and identify regions in the promoter where tf binding may affect h4k5ac occupancy, we profiled the coverage of h4k5ac on all genes, on genes with a tfbs at  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp or  <dig> bp upstream of the tss, and on genes with no tfbs  <dig> bp upstream of the tss . using the average coverage of h4k5ac of all genes as baseline, we observed that the presence of a tfbs at position − <dig> bp or − <dig> bp, and − <dig> bp resulted in modest a reduction in h4k5ac relative to baseline coverage at that position. however, genes with no tfbs upstream of  <dig> bp resulted in significantly higher h4k5ac in both the promoter and cds, approximately ± <dig> kb relative to the tss.

based on the increase of h4k5ac coverage in the absence of a tfbs upstream of  <dig> bp, we focused our analysis in this region, proximal to the tss. we compared the contribution of acetylated gene clusters  in the presence or absence of a tfbs relative to  <dig> bp of the tss: either no tfbs present in the promoter  or no tfbs, one tfbs, or multiple tfbs  <dig> bp upstream of the tss . gene clusters with relatively no enrichment for h4k5ac or h4k12ac constituted a larger proportion of genes regardless of whether a tfbs was present or not . however, in the presence of at least one tfbs within  <dig> bp of the tss , the contribution of cluster  <dig> for h4k5ac in fc , cluster  <dig> for h4k5ac in control , and cluster  <dig> for h4k12ac after cfc  increased from approximately 10% to 20%, compared to the same clusters when no tfbs was present. to a lesser extent, cluster contribution was also increased in the presence of one tfbs  <dig> bp upstream of the tss, but was diminished in the presence of multiple tfbs. these observations provide novel insight into h4k5ac-mediated regulation of gene transcription and support the notion that tf binding and acetylation are mutually exclusive in the promoter  <cit> . however, h4k5ac is increased when tf binding occurs proximal to the tss.

the observed increase in acetylation and transcription at proximal tfbs may be attributed to the recruitment of transcriptional machinery including tfs and rna polymerase ii, which is also known to occupy positions near the tss in actively transcribed genes  <cit> . additionally, recent encode studies have shown that a set of tfs is strongly associated to positions proximal to the tss and that transcriptional initiation is determined by stereotyped tf binding in this region, approximately  <dig> to  <dig> bp upstream of the tss  <cit> . acetylated nucleosomes further away in the promoter, greater than  <dig> kb from the tss, may either be more strongly bound and less easily displaced by tf binding, or they may be regulatory regions which do not depend on the presence or acetylation of nucleosomes  <cit> . as expected, igg-ip control clusters were uniformly proportioned in the presence or absence of a tfbs . together, these data suggest that since h4k5ac is associated with increased gene expression, enrichment of h4k5ac proximal to the tss may be a reliable marker of actively transcribed genes.

genes differentially acetylated for h4k <dig> are associated with fear memory in the hippocampus
the high percentage of genes with above average h4k5ac in both fc and controls suggest that this modification is important and that it is subject to tight regulation in the context of transcription-dependent memory formation. using a criteria-based approach, we found that ~15% of genes were uniquely acetylated for h4k <dig> with cfc , however, this did not account for differentially acetylated genes. we also found that h4k5ac correlates to global gene expression levels. thus, to identify specific genes induced by learning and increased h4k5ac levels in the hippocampus, we used a top-down approach – rather than identifying specific genes activated by learning through differential gene expression, we identified highly expressed genes through differential acetylation of h4k <dig> in fc compared to controls. we used a peak-calling algorithm to scan the genome at  <dig> bp intervals for differentially acetylated regions between fc and controls. using model-based analysis of chip-seq , we obtained consensus coverage of h4k5ac-enriched regions across the mouse genome  <cit> . out of  <dig>  peaks identified for h4k5ac in fc by macs,  <dig> peaks were found − <dig> to − <dig> bp relative to the tss,  <dig>  peaks were found in the promoter , and  <dig>  peaks were found in the cds . of these, we identified  <dig> regions significantly acetylated for h4k <dig> in fc,  <dig> of which were associated with gene bodies representing  <dig> unique genes, and  <dig> within intergenic regions .

to validate the results obtained with macs, we repeated the analysis with three other published algorithms for chip-seq analysis, including sicer, epichip, and genomatix ngs analyzer   <cit> . we performed a cross-wise comparison of genes identified with the algorithms to genes identified using pre-defined criteria, including genes with more than  <dig> reads in the promoter , previously defined as above average, or genes with more than  <dig> reads in the promoter with cfc but  <dig> reads or less in controls , analogous to algorithm-based differential acetylation . of all genes identified by macs, approximately 70% overlapped with sicer, the other most widely used algorithm for differential peak finding. thus, we considered the genes identified by macs as a reliable and representative gene set to evaluate further.

genes differentially acetylated for h4k <dig> in fc are associated with memory processes
gene ontology analysis of the  <dig> unique macs-derived genes in fc identified genes enriched for structural and neuronal components including synapses, the postsynaptic density, and axons, in addition to genes involved in functional processes such as synapse assembly and organization, ion transport, calcium signaling, neuromuscular and neurological system processes . from interaction maps, we also found that genes in pathways involved in calcium, mtor, erbb signaling, and alzheimer’s disease were significantly enriched .

in contrast, the  <dig> genes differentially acetylated for h4k <dig> in controls were classified into brain processes such as negative regulation of axogenesis, of neurogenesis, and of cell development, but also contributed to normal brain development and neuronal differentiation . pathway analysis for genes identified in controls showed enrichment for normal neuronal processes such as axon guidance, but also for genes associated with long-term depression, a form of synaptic plasticity typically associated with synaptic weakening . the repressive functional categories and pathways enriched in controls suggest that training counteracts these pathways for memory formation. alternatively, pathways upregulated in controls may be those that are needed to maintain homeostatic processes and basal neuronal functions in the absence of learning.

to validate whether genes differentially acetylated for h4k <dig> are also differentially expressed, we quantified mrna expression of twelve randomly chosen genes called by macs. mrna levels were measured in hippocampal samples collected from animals from an independent cfc experiment to avoid sample or experimental bias associated with the chip-seq. seven out of twelve genes had significantly higher expression after cfc than in controls . in contrast, in the cerebellum, a brain region not recruited for the formation of contextual fear memory, gene expression did not change after cfc, except for one . taken together, our data suggests that genes differentially acetylated for h4k <dig> are specific to memory formation in the hippocampus with cfc.

discussion
the present study provides a comprehensive genome-wide analysis of h4k5ac in the hippocampus following fear memory formation, and identifies a novel set of genes associated with h4k5ac induced by learning. it demonstrates that h4k5ac is a ubiquitous histone ptm in the genome, present on one-third of genes with above average h4k5ac in the adult mouse hippocampus. genes associated with high h4k5ac, in both promoter and cds, are highly expressed, but h4k5ac is most prominent within  <dig> kb upstream of the tss. our results suggest that h4k5ac may be required in both the promoter and cds, over the entire length of the gene, for transcription of full and intermediate transcripts and that the presence of h4k5ac is a reliable marker of actively transcribed genes. however, we found that enrichment of h4k5ac in the promoter is determined, to an extent, by tf binding in which the absence of distal tfbs,  <dig> bp upstream of the tss, dramatically increases h4k5ac enrichment in the promoter. we also provide evidence that h4k5ac may be a hallmark of activity-dependent genes that are expressed with learning. by identifying genes differentially acetylated for h4k <dig>  we have uncovered key genes, both known and novel, involved in memory formation. these genes are specific to functions and pathways involved in synaptic plasticity and memory formation, but also to basic cellular processes, with learning.

the finding that promoters of ~80% of genes are acetylated above average for h4k <dig> regardless of training and that, of those, two-thirds are also acetylated for h4k <dig>  is consistent with studies of other histone ptms. in human cell lines, for instance, the promoters of 70% of genes were enriched for both h3k9ac and h3k14ac, of which >95% were also enriched for h3k4me <dig>  <cit> . it suggests that histone ptms are ubiquitous in the genome, but it raises the question of whether their specificity depends on a few dominant modifications or a combination of histone ptms, the extent to which multiple nucleosomes are modified in succession, and whether positioning of modified nucleosomes is a factor  <cit> . we found that ~15% of genes with above average h4k5ac are unique to fc and that genes differentially acetylated for h4k <dig> with learning are conducive to memory formation. this suggests that approximately  <dig> out of  <dig>  known protein-coding genes, or 5% of all genes, may be associated with memory in the hippocampus. at the moment, it is unclear what percent of genes are actively transcribed with learning, but synaptic proteins alone number  <dig> , of which the postsynaptic density comprises more than  <dig> proteins  <cit> .

differential acetylation analysis suggests that learning may target memory-specific genes for hyperacetylation over those normally acetylated for h4k <dig> under control conditions. our data also show that h4k5ac is a reliable predictor of actively transcribed genes and that its level of enrichment correlates with the level of gene expression. based on these observations, we propose that the prevalence of h4k5ac in the promoter may be a means to prime specific genes to facilitate their expression upon training or practice for rapid stabilization of the memory trace . although mature neurons and glia are fully differentiated, our notion of priming is reminiscent of gene bookmarking in mitotic cells, whereby cells retain a ‘memory’ for patterns of gene expression through dna and histone modifications following exit from mitosis  <cit> . such a priming mechanism would be advantageous for the rapid induction of memory-specific genes following learning. however, it is currently not known how nucleosomes are positioned and modified with transcriptional activity or subsequent activity over time – whether they are depleted, displaced, or their modifications altered to retain a trace of prior activity  <cit> .

consistent with the notion of priming genes with repeated learning, approximately half of the genes we identified by peak-calling are involved in cognitive processes, while the other half has not been previously associated with memory processes. for instance, phactr <dig> , also known as scapinin , is an interesting candidate with respect to memory as it is transcribed primarily in the brain and in tumors but has been relatively unstudied in the context of memory  <cit> . likewise, pik3cd, involved in the immune response and in cancer is implicated in the mtor pathway with ddit <dig>  and tsc1/ <dig>  recent studies have linked tsc1/ <dig> dysregulation to cognitive deficits associated with tuberous sclerosis and identified this gene as a potential target to treat autism  <cit> . ddit <dig> has also been implicated in alzheimer’s disease and is therefore highly relevant for memory processes  <cit> .

a notable feature of our findings is the considerably large number of intergenic loci found to carry h4k5ac. our observation that genic regions only accounted for one-quarter of the  <dig>  peaks differentially acetylated for h4k <dig> suggests that, in addition to gene bodies, h4k5ac is highly interspersed throughout intergenic regions. these regions are thought to give rise to noncoding rnas or micrornas that may potentially regulate genes. indeed, the differentially acetylated targets we identified through both peak-calling algorithms and criteria-based selection methods included many known and novel noncoding rnas. the recent discovery by the encode consortium of an additional  <dig>  intergenic and antisense tss in the genome suggests that previously defined limits of what constituted genic regions, and gene annotations we used in this study, were incomplete and underestimated the activity of these novel intergenic regions  <cit> . additionally, the encode finding that nearly three-quarters of the genome can be transcribed at any given time, whether in genic or intergenic regions, suggests that the ubiquity of h4k5ac is to be expected if, as in our study, h4k5ac is a modification associated with active transcription and is required to transcribe intergenic regions  <cit> .

finally, another important question raised by our study is whether histone ptms participate in the recruitment of transcriptional machinery. although low intrinsic nucleosome occupancy has been documented in promoter regulatory regions, tfbs, and origins of replication in yeast  <cit> , p <dig> was found to preferentially bind dna sites strongly associated with nucleosomes over sites with relatively low nucleosome occupancy  <cit> . our data show that actively transcribed genes with a conserved tfbs in positions proximal to the tss have increased enrichment for h4k5ac in the promoter. similarly, the encode studies have shown that particular sets of tfs are strongly associated to proximal promoter regions and that the spatial positioning and structural motif of tfbs in these regions is highly conserved across many human cell lines  <cit> . this may suggest that nucleosomes demarcate positions of accessibility proximal to the tss and, with appropriate modifications, open consensus sites to allow tf recruitment and binding. other studies have shown that h3k9ac and h3k14ac are critical for the recruitment of tfiid in the promoter to initiate transcription  <cit> . once bound, however, it is not yet known whether nucleosomes are deacetylated or evicted from the promoter of actively transcribed genes.

CONCLUSIONS
our study newly suggests that h4k5ac is induced in an activity-dependent manner in the adult mouse hippocampus where it may prime genes for rapid expression following repetitive learning. we propose that hyperacetylation of h4k <dig> proximal to the tss in the promoter facilitates the recruitment of tfs and is associated with rapid gene expression following reinforced learning   <cit> . many questions still remain about chromatin remodeling and the extent to which it regulates gene expression in biological functions. however, this study provides new insight into chromatin remodeling in cognitive processes in a manner that is unbiased and independent of predefined genetic associations. complementary genome-wide studies will be required in the future to comprehensively map the ensemble of histone modifications regulating genetic programs in cognitive and other biological processes.
