BACKGROUND
oligodendrocytes are cells that produce myelin in the central nervous system . they wrap axons of neurons to produce myelin sheaths, provide trophic support and protection for neurons and their axons  <cit> . at least a part of the functional deficit after spinal cord injury  is attributable to chronic progressive demyelination  <cit> . therefore, it seems to be an effective strategy to increase the extent of remyelination by transplanting cns myelin-forming cells into the injured spinal cord.

oligodendrocyte precursor cells , which are still bipotential in vitro and can differentiate into myelin-forming cells of the cns under certain conditions. as one of the promising candidate cells, opcs have been used for treatment of sci  <cit> . using a special culture system, we have induced opcs from rat embryonic spinal cord-derived neural precursor cells   <cit>  and transplanted them into injured spinal cord. however, our study revealed that after being transplanted into the spinal cord, only a small number of the opcs could survive, and most of them differentiated into astrocytes, but not oligodendrocytes. the mechanisms which caused to this result may be related to a disadvantageous micro-environment in the injured zone created by lipid peroxidation  <cit> , an inflammatory reaction  <cit> , and/or an immune response against grafts  <cit> , etc.

cyclosporin-a  is an immunosuppressive agent that can depress cellular and humoral immune responses by inhibiting t helper lymphocyte proliferation  <cit> . it can also diminish overproduction of free radicals and lipid peroxidation, which were both observed after acute sci. csa does this by inhibiting both the inflammatory reaction and the synthesis of nitric oxide  <cit> . therefore, csa may act as a neuroprotective agent and be useful in the treatment of acute sci.

in this study, we transplanted embryonic npc derived-opcs which express green fluorescent protein  into injured spinal cords of rats treated with or without csa, to evaluate whether the drug is beneficial for survival and differentiation of engrafted opcs and plays a neuroprotective role after sci.

RESULTS
identification of npc-induced gfp-opcs, derived from rat embryonic spinal cord
gfp-opcs were cultured for  <dig> days in different media as described in materials and methods, to assess their differentiation potential. when oligospheres were triturated into single cells and plated onto coverslips in basal-opc-medium supplied with pdgf-aa and bfgf , almost all of the cells displayed bipolar or tri-polar morphology, the typical morphology of opcs . among them, more than 95% of cells expressed both a2b <dig> and pdgfrα . in the presence of t <dig> without pdgf-aa and bfgf , the cells displayed a multi-polar morphology . more than 95% of them expressed rip , and almost no cells expressed gfap . in the presence of 10% fbs , the cells displayed the typical process-bearing morphology of astrocytes . few cells expressed rip  and nearly all cells expressed gfap .

effect of csa on the survival of engrafted opcs in injured spinal cord
to investigate the survival of engrafted opcs in vivo, we engrafted gfp-opcs into contusive injured spinal cord at  <dig> days after sci. to investigate whether the engrafted gfp-opcs could survive to the end of the experiment, we detected the engrafted cells by gfp fluorescence at  <dig> weeks and  <dig> weeks after transplantation. we also determined the effect of csa on the survival of the engrafted opcs. the results showed that the gfp cells could be observed in spinal cords of cell-transplanted rats at  <dig> weeks and  <dig> weeks after transplantation. because it is extremely difficult to discern individual cells at  <dig> weeks, we chose  <dig> weeks to count the survived cells and determine their phenotype. figure  <dig> shows the representative pictures from the spinal cords after cell transplantation for  <dig> weeks. quantitative analysis showed that the average total number of gfp-positive cells present in the spinal cord of vehicle control group and csa-treated group were  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the original injected cell number , respectively. there was statistically significant difference between the two groups . to examine the proliferation of transplanted cells, animals received injections of brdu before they were sacrificed at  <dig> weeks after transplantation. we observed few gfp/brdu-double positive cells in both vehicle and csa-treated groups. there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups . these results collectively indicate that the increased numbers of gfp-cells were likely the result of enhanced survival by csa.

effect of csa on differentiation of engrafted opcs in injured spinal cord
next, we investigated whether csa has any effect on the differentiation of engrafted opcs. the differentiation of engrafted gfp-opcs in spinal cords from vehicle- and csa-treated groups was detected by immunofluorescence staining of pdgfrα, gfap and rip, respectively. we found that the most gfp-cells expressed gfap, only a very small number of gfp-cells expressed rip and almost no gfp-cells expressed pdgfrα in both groups. among the total gfp-positive cells, the gfp/gfap-double positive cells were  <dig> % ±  <dig> % and  <dig> % ±  <dig> % in vehicle- and csa-treated groups, respectively. the gfp/rip-double positive cells were only  <dig> % ±  <dig> % and  <dig> % ±  <dig> % in vehicle- and csa-treated groups, respectively. the percentage of both markers had no statistically significant difference between the two groups .

effect of opc transplantation and csa on infiltration of cd3+t cells and activation of resident microglia cells and/or macrophages derived from infiltrating monocytes in the injured spinal cords
to observe the effect of csa on immune responses, we examined the infiltration of cd3+t cells, and activation of resident microglia and/or macrophages derived from infiltrating monocytes in the injured spinal cord at  <dig> weeks after cell transplantation. the cd <dig>  a specific marker of t lymphocytes, and cd <dig>  a marker of activated resident microglia and macrophages derived from infiltrating monocytes were detected by immunofluorescent staining. the numbers of cd3-positive cells in injured spinal cord of vehicle- and csa-treated groups were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig> ±  <dig>  respectively, and of the opc transplantation without and with csa groups were  <dig> ±  <dig>  and  <dig> ±  <dig>  respectively . the cd68-positive cells were  <dig> ±  <dig>   <dig> ±  <dig>   <dig> ±  <dig>  and  <dig> ±  <dig>  respectively . the numbers of cd3-positive and cd68-positive cells in csa-treated groups  were significantly lower than those of vehicle-treated groups , while the opc transplantation had no effect on the infiltration of t cells and activation of microglia and/or macrophages derived from infiltrating monocytes .

effect of opc transplantation and csa on the lesion volume of contused spinal cord
quantitative analysis of the total lesion volume in whole spinal cords in all groups was performed at the 7th week after sci. in the vehicle-treated group, the total lesion volume was  <dig> % ±  <dig> %. in the csa-treated group, it was  <dig> % ±  <dig> %. in opc transplantation with the vehicle-treated group, it was  <dig> % ±  <dig> %. in opc transplantation with the csa-treated group, it was  <dig> % ±  <dig> %. the total lesion volumes in csa-treated groups  were significantly lower than those of vehicle-treated groups , while there was no difference between the two vehicle-treated groups or the two csa-treated groups  . these results indicate that csa treatment can significantly decrease spinal cord lesion volume, while opc transplantation has no effect.

effect of opc transplantation and csa on the survival of motoneurons in the ventral horn following sci
to determine the effect of opc transplantation and csa on neuronal survival, the numbers of ventral horn  motor neurons at the injury epicenter as well as at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> mm rostral and caudal to the epicenter were counted at the 7th week after injury. as shown in fig  <dig>  in csa-treated groups , more residual motor neurons were found in the vh at  <dig> and  <dig> mm rostral and caudal to the lesion epicenter than in vehicle-treated groups . however, the number of motor neurons showed no statistically significant difference between the opc transplantation group and the corresponding control .

effect of opc transplantation and csa on myelin preservation following sci
to investigate the effect of opc transplantation and csa on myelin preservation, the extent of residual myelination, stained with luxol fast blue , was examined at the injury epicenter at the 7th week after a contusive sci. residual myelination was also examined at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> mm rostral and caudal to the injury epicenter. as shown in fig  <dig>  the volume of residual myelin was significantly increased in csa-treated groups , at the epicenter as well as at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mm rostral and caudal to the lesion epicenter compared with that in vehicle-treated groups . however, no statistically significant difference was found in the volume of residual myelin between the opc transplantation group and the corresponding control .

to verify the lfb results, a subset of sections from the injury epicenter of the above groups were stained with toluidine blue. as shown in fig 8a-d, the spared myelin was more abundant in the csa-treated groups  compared with the vehicle-treated groups .

effect of opc transplantation and csa on functional recovery in rats after sci
to observe the effect of opc transplantation and csa on functional recovery after sci, the basso, beattie, and bresnahan  locomotor rating scale was evaluated at  <dig> and  <dig> days, and then weekly up to  <dig> weeks. as shown in fig  <dig>  all animals scored  <dig> points before sci. at  <dig> day after sci, all animals received a score of  <dig>  and at  <dig> days, a score under  <dig>  in the following days, the locomotor performance substantially improved and reached a plateau at the third week. starting from the first week, the bbb scores in csa-treated groups  were consistently higher than the other groups. additionally, the differences between the csa-treated groups and the other  <dig> groups were statistically significant starting from the third week and continuing until the 7th week . notably, no statistically significant difference was found in bbb scores between the opc transplantation groups and the corresponding controls . these results indicate that the opc transplantation alone dose not affect the behavior of sci rats and that csa-treatment can exert some protective effects leading to functional recovery in sci rats.

discussion
after sci, many axons remain intact but are rendered useless by loss of their insulating myelin. opcs are precursors which can differentiate into myelin-forming cells of the cns. we expected that the opcs transplanted into injured spinal cord could differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes, induce axonal remyelination and promote functional recovery. however, our results demonstrated that only a small part of the opcs could survive, and most of them differentiated into astrocytes. almost no oligodendrocytes could be observed after opcs were grafted into injured spinal cord. this indicated that the injured spinal cord environment might be unfavorable for the grafted cell survival and differentiation into oligodendrocytes. therefore, it is of great significance to improve the local microenvironment of injured spinal cord when the opcs are grafted.

csa is one of the foremost immunosuppressive agents and has widespread use in tissue and cell transplantation  <cit> . however, it also carries a risk of cns toxicity due to the drug-induced death of oligodendrocytes and neurons  <cit> . therefore, whether the drug is beneficial to survival and differentiation of engrafted npc-derived opcs in injured spinal cord remains unknown. this is a question about clinical application because any potential cell transplantation therapy of sci would require the use of immunosuppressants, and it is therefore important to characterize any effects of these agents might have on transplanted cells. to clarify this question, we used csa immediately after injury rather than at the time of transplantation. this exposed the cells to an immunosuppressive environment in which immune responses, inflammatory reaction and the synthesis of nitric oxide, which is caused by sci, could be inhibited  <cit> .

we observed the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of engrafted opcs using gfp expressed-opcs which were induced from gfp-npcs, derived from gfp transgenic rat embryonic spinal cord. the immunocytochemistry results revealed that the gfp-opcs used here were highly pure and expressed both a2b <dig> and pdgfrα, the two commonly used cell surface markers for opcs  <cit> . they could proliferate, be passaged, differentiate into oligodendrocytes and type- <dig> astrocytes under certain conditions in vitro, and showed classical properties of opcs  <cit> . next, the in vivo experiments showed that the treatment of csa resulted in a dramatic increase in the numbers of grafted cells in the injured cord. this suggested that csa-treatment could enhance the survival of engrafted gfp-opcs and/or induce their proliferation in vivo. to determine whether csa contributed to the proliferation of transplanted cells, we used the brdu incorporation assay. we observed few gfp and brdu-double positive cells in both vehicle and csa-treated groups. this result indicated that the increased numbers of gfp-expressing cells were likely the result of enhanced survival.

oligodendrocyte differentiation of engrafted opcs is vital for opc transplantation treatment of sci. therefore, it is of great significance to clarify whether csa could affect differentiation of the engrafted opcs. thus, the differentiation of engrafted gfp-opcs in spinal cords was detected by immunofluorescent staining. unfortunately, we found that the treatment of csa had no effect on the differentiation of engrafted cells; the exact mechanism is still unclear. therefore, it is of great significance to clarify the reason behind the phenomenon, and seek new approaches to cause the engrafted opcs to differentiate into oligodendrocytes rather than astrocytes.

some previous studies have reported that the opcs isolated directly from embryonic, neonatal and adult spinal cord, or induced from es cells could all differentiate into oligodendrocytes after being transplanted into cns  <cit> . however, in this study, using embryonic npc-derived opcs, we found that few oligodendrocytes could be observed and the majority of engrafted-opcs differentiated into gfap-positive astrocytes in both vehicle and csa-treated groups. however, we have demonstrated that the opcs derived from npcs could differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes in vitro. we consider that the different source of the opcs may contribute to the difference between our results with the previous. in addition to cell source, there may be other reasons. for example, in this study, the transplants occurred in animals that had been on csa for  <dig> days, which is unlike other studies. however, the detailed mechanism still needs to be further investigated.

to determine whether transplantation of opcs and/or csa-treatment could improve recovery of function after sci, morphological and functional assays were performed. to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of csa on sci, we used csa immediately after injury. thus, this could exert its neuroprotective effect as early as possible and be suitable for clinical application. we found that in all csa-treated groups , there was a significant decrease in spinal cord lesion volume. additionally, increases in spared myelin, myelinated axons and neurons were found compared to the vehicle-treated groups. such histological improvement correlated well with increase in behavioral recovery. however, no histological or behavioral improvement was found in the opc-transplanted groups compared to the corresponding control groups. these results collectively indicate that the application of csa may improve myelin preservation. however, it is also possible that more endogenous opcs were spared and remyelination was improved since the csa was used immediately after injury.

how does csa enhance the survival of engrafted opcs in injured spinal cord and improve spinal cord repair? the previous studies demonstrated that csa is a selective immunosuppressive agent known for its neuroprotective properties. the neuroprotective role is thought to be attributed to inhibit immune responses, inflammatory reaction and the synthesis of nitric oxide. by these means, csa may diminish overproduction of self-reactive cells, inflammatory cytokines, free radicals and lipid peroxidation, all of which can be observed after acute sci  <cit> . because the disadvantageous micro-environment in the injured spinal cord may be triggered by activated microglia and infiltrated lymphocytes  <cit> , we supposed that the beneficial effect of csa on sci might also be attributed to its effect on immune cells. notably, we found that csa could significantly inhibit infiltration of t cells, and activation of microglia and/or macrophages derived from infiltrating monocytes in the injured spinal cords. these results suggest that inhibition of t cell infiltration, microglia and/or macrophage activation may be an important cause, which leads to more survival of engrafted opcs and improvement of morphological and functional recovery after sci.

an important observation in the present study is that csa had a protective effect on sci. this was consistent with the previous reports  <cit> , but it seemed to be paradoxical with the results of rabchevsky and colleagues who used a similar sci model to test whether csa could improve functional outcome and tissue sparing. using careful analysis, they showed absolutely no benefit of csa on tissue sparing or bbb scores after sci  <cit> . however, the csa administration scheme in their report was very different from ours. in our study, the animals received a daily subcutaneous injection of csa  starting the first day of sci and continuing until the end of the experiments. in the report of rabchevsky and co-workers, the rats received a bolus i.p. injection of  <dig> mg/kg csa  <dig> min post-injury and continuous csa delivery  via an osmotic minipump for only  <dig> days  <cit> . therefore, the differences between their and our results are possible and understandable. however, the exact explanation remains to be determined.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our study indicates that csa can promote the survival of engrafted opcs in injured spinal cords, but has no effect on their differentiation fate. the engrafted cells mostly differentiate into astrocytes, but not oligodendrocytes. the beneficial effect of csa on sci and the survival of engrafted cells may be attributed to its neuroprotective effect.
