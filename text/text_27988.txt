BACKGROUND
during the evolutionary history of life on earth there has been a trend towards drastic transitions from simple to more complex life forms, like from unicellular bacterium to simple multicellular placozans, diploblastic organisms with two germ layers to bilaterians with a third germ layer, simple chordates to vertebrates  <cit> . the innovation of new structures and functions during these macroevolutionary events has in part been accomplished through expansion in the genetic toolkit, e.g. by gene duplications  <cit> . in fact, extensive gene duplications have been suggested at the base of vertebrate lineage which results in widespread existence of gene families in modern vertebrates  <cit> . expansions in gene number are associated with the evolution of increased morphological and anatomical complexity and diversity achieved by vertebrates compared to basal chordates . the organization of paralogous regions  in the human and other vertebrate genomes have led to the hypothesis of multiple block duplication events involving large chromosomal segments or even two rounds of whole genome duplication   <cit>  early in the history of vertebrate evolution after their divergence from an amphioxus-like invertebrate ancestor. in contrast to block duplication events, an alternative model of continuous wave of small-scale gene duplications  was suggested to explain the numerous paralogs in vertebrates  <cit> .

phylogenetic trees can be used to test the 2r hypothesis. if two rounds of genome duplication occurred, a tree for four vertebrate paralogous genes should exhibit the topology of the form , where the first genome duplication produced the common ancestor of the sequences a/b and c/d and the second genome duplication split these two lineages simultaneously. thus, under the assumption of the 2r hypothesis the neighboring gene families within potentially quadruplicated regions of the human genome should not only show the same but also the specific type of topology  <cit> . nevertheless many phylogenetic analyses have not yielded a predominance of  topologies, instead a high proportion of gene families showed an asymmetrical  tree, in which one of the four paralogues diverged prior to others, contradicting 2r  <cit> .

the human hox gene clusters bearing chromosomes  harbor one of the three large quadrupled genomic regions that have been extensively presented in the literature  <cit> . the fact that two or more paralogs of numerous gene families are linked with hox genes suggests that these paralogous gene sets along with the linked hox clusters might have arisen by duplications of an intact chromosomal segment, i.e. through block duplication events. this extensive intra-genomic synteny centered on hox clusters has also been seen as an argument supporting two rounds of whole genome duplication events  in the vertebrate lineage  <cit> .

in order to track the evolutionary events involved in structuring the mammalian hox-bearing chromosomes, hughes and coworkers  <cit>  conducted a phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> gene families sharing members on two or more of the human chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the chromosomes that bear hox clusters. these authors found that phylogenies of  <dig> hox linked gene families supported the occurrence of genome duplications before the protostome-deutrostome split. members of only few families were found to be duplicated within the time window of proposed whole genome/block duplication events. they argued that these genes were actually not duplicated simultaneously with the hox clusters because the topologies of their phylogenetic trees were not consistent with the hox cluster phylogeny.

however larhammar and coworkers  <cit>  advise caution in rejecting the block/chromosomal duplication hypothesis and argued that only genes that are anciently linked to hox clusters and not those that are transported on the hox-bearing chromosomes as a result of recent rearrangement events should be considered. they recommended the enrichment of sequence information with diverse classes of vertebrates from mammals to fishes to perform more thorough phylogenetic analysis. larhammar and coworkers concluded that at least  <dig> gene families on human hox-bearing chromosomes display phylogenetic histories compatible with duplications concomitant with the hox clusters.

in the present study, we exploit the accessibility of a huge amount of protein data from sequencing and annotation of increasing numbers of vertebrate genomes analyzing the phylogenetic history of  <dig> hox linked gene families  to unravel the evolutionary events that brought the hox clusters and members of these gene families in physical proximity deep in vertebrate history. all of these gene families are anciently linked to hox clusters with  <dig> families  having their members on all human hox-bearing chromosomes, while  <dig> gene families have paralogs linked to at least three human hox clusters . it is of note that  <dig> of these families  are among those  <dig> gene families, which larhammar and coworkers  <cit>  hypothesized to be duplicated simultaneously with the linked hox clusters by block duplication event. for each of these  <dig> hox linked gene families, the orthologous sequence information from several vertebrate representatives from mammals to bony fishes has been included. thus, we performed a more robust and thorough phylogenetic analysis compared to previous studies. given our phylogenetic data, we compared the topologies of those paralogous genes of the each gene family which have arisen within the time window of vertebrates-invertebrates and tetrapods-fishes divergence to test which genes have duplicated concurrently with each other and with the linked hox clusters at the base of vertebrate lineage.

our results show that gene families with three or more paralogs linked to hox clusters did not arise simultaneously through two rounds of whole chromosome or whole genome duplication. instead our analysis shows that these multigene families might have arisen largely as a result of segmental or gene-cluster duplication events, which occurred at different time points during early evolution of vertebrate lineage.

RESULTS
phylogenetic analysis
to perform rigorous testing of the 2r hypothesis, which advocates that four-fold paralogy regions in the human hox-bearing chromosomes might be remnants of polyploidy, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of gene families with representatives linked to three or four of the human hox clusters. gene families with paralogues linked to only two hox clusters have been left out, because their occurrence is consistent with several alternative explanatory scenarios.

fibrillar collagen family – col
the phylogenetic tree of collagen genes was previously constructed by bailey and coworkers  <cit> . their analysis was based on sequence data from very few species . in this phylogeny, collagen genes on human chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> formed unresolved trichotomy, while genes on chromosome  <dig> formed an outgroup.

here, we reanalyze the phylogenetic history of collagen genes by including the sequences from representative members of teleost and tetrapod lineages, thus depicting a clearer picture of evolutionary relationship among members of this family . the phylogenetic tree suggests that duplication events giving rise to members of vertebrate collagen gene family occurred prior to the actinopterygii-sarcopterygii and after the echinoderms-chordates split. for the col3a <dig> gene the respective time points have not been defined with confidence because orthologous sequences from actinopterygii are unavailable. phylogeny indicates with bootstrap support of 83% that col5a <dig> was the first molecule of this family to diverge. the remaining family members showed the topology of the form   <cit> , i.e.  with col3a <dig> falling outside the cluster of col2a <dig>  col1a <dig>  and col1a <dig> genes. the branch supporting this pattern received the bootstrap support of 92%.

erbb receptor protein tyrosine kinase – erbb
for the erbb family a topology of the form , i.e.  received a strong bootstrap support  with erbb <dig> falling outside the cluster of erbb <dig>  egfr and erbb <dig> .

the phylogenetic tree showed strong evidence of duplications within the time window of deuterostomes-protostomes and actinopterygii-sarcopterygii split.

insuline-like growth factor binding protein – igfbp
the phylogenetic tree of igfbp family contained two clusters:  a cluster in which the igfbp5-igfbp <dig> genes grouped with igfbp <dig>   a cluster of vertebrate igfbp4-igfbp <dig> genes grouped with igfbp <dig> . the bootstrap support for this pattern was significant, i.e. 99% and  <dig> % for the two relevant branches. the topology of the vertebrate igfbp family members is unique in a sense that it can be explained by three, rather than two rounds of gene duplication events early in vertebrate history attributed to  type gene topology  <cit> . the most parsimonious explanation for this type of topology is: two rounds of whole genome duplication  followed by two independent gene duplication events or three rounds of whole genome duplication followed by two independent gene loss events. we call this topology an extended form of  type gene topology in which six genes form two clusters, i.e. .

phylogeny of vertebrate igfbp proteins suggests that the gene duplication events giving rise to members of this family have occurred after the urchordates-vertebrates and prior to actinopterygii- sarcopterygii split.

integrin β – itgb
in the phylogenetic tree of the integrin β family , vertebrate itgb <dig>  itgb <dig>  itgb <dig> and itgb <dig> genes clustered with homologues from drosophila and sea urchin, indicating that these four members of the integrin β family diverged at least after the divergence of echinoderms and chordates. itgb <dig> and itgb <dig> genes fell outside the itgb3-5-6- <dig> cluster and homologues from drosophila, and sea urchin. this topology suggests that gene duplication events giving rise to the ancestor of the itgb3-5-6- <dig> cluster may have occurred prior to the divergence of deuterostomes and protostomes.

myosin light chain – myl
the myosin light chain family members formed two major clusters:  cluster including vertebrate myl <dig>  myl <dig> and myl <dig> genes and homologues from drosophila and apis mellifera,  a cluster including vertebrate myl <dig>  myl <dig> and homologues from drosophila and apis mellifera . significant bootstrap support, i.e. 100%, for the internal branch separating the two clusters places the divergence of the ancestors of these two groups prior to the deuterostomes-protostomes split. subsequent duplications might have occurred early in chordate evolution before the actinopterygii- sarcopterygii divergence.

sp <dig> c2h2-type zinc-finger protein – sp
in the sp <dig> c2h2-type zinc-finger protein family  a significant internal branch  separated:  a cluster containing the vertebrate sp <dig>  sp <dig>  sp <dig>  and sp <dig> genes showing a topology of the form , i.e.  that grouped with a homolog from sea urchin with highly significant bootstrap support, i.e. 98%.  the vertebrate sp <dig> molecule clustered independently with a homolog from sea urchin . the phylogeny suggests that the ancestor of vertebrate sp1- <dig> and sp <dig> genes duplicated prior to the divergence of chordates and echinoderms.

zinc-finger protein-subfamily 1a – znfn1a
the vertebrate members of znfn1a family showed a topology of the form , i.e. , with znfn1a <dig> clustered outside the other three vertebrate genes. the branch supporting this pattern received bootstrap support of 90% . the topology of the phylogenetic tree indicated that the gene duplications giving rise to znfn1a family members occurred within the time window of echinoderms-chordates and actinopterygii-sarcopterygii split.

anion exchanger – slc4a 
the phylogenetic tree of slc4a genes  is divided into two major clusters. cluster- <dig> includes vertebrate members slc4a <dig>  slc4a <dig>  slc4a <dig>  and a homolog from drosophila; cluster- <dig> includes slc4a <dig>  slc4a <dig>  slc4a <dig>  and homologues from drosophila and c. elegans. the internal branch separating the two clusters received highly significant  bootstrap support. the topology suggests that gene duplication events giving rise to ancestors of cluster- <dig> and cluster- <dig> occurred prior to deuterostomes-protostomes divergence. phylogeny further indicates that the mammalian slc4a <dig> and slc4a <dig> genes arose through the duplication of an slc4a8-like ancestor in the tetrapod lineage at least before the divergence of euarchontoglires from laurasiatheria, and the branch supporting this pattern received 91% bootstrap support.

gli zinc-finger protein – gli
the phylogenetic tree indicates that the gli <dig>  gli <dig>  and gli <dig> genes diverged after the separation of urchordates from vertebrates and before the divergence of tetrapods and bony fishes . the phylogeny shows a topology of the from , i.e.  with highly significant  bootstrap support.

hedgehog – hh
vertebrate hh family members showed a topology of the form , i.e. , with dhh falling outside the shh-ihh cluster. the branch supporting this pattern received significant  bootstrap support . phylogeny attributed the birth of vertebrate hh family members to duplications which occurred within the time window of the cephalochordates-vertebrates and tetrapods- fishes split.

inhibin – inhb
the topology of vertebrate inhibin genes  is similar to hh and gli families, i.e.  with 93% bootstrap support. furthermore, the phylogenetic tree indicates that inhibin paralogs on hsa <dig>  i.e. inhbc and inhbe originated by a duplication event in tetrapod lineage after its divergence from bony fishes. the branch supporting this pattern received significant  bootstrap support.

estimation of co-duplication events
given the phylogenetic data, we next sought to determine which genes could have duplicated simultaneously. to test this, we adopted the topology comparison approach  <cit>  and selected the genes from those portions of each phylogeny, where there was a strong statistical support for duplication events within the time window of vertebrates-invertebrates and tetrapods-fishes split . furthermore we included the published phylogeny of vertebrate hox clusters  <cit>  in this test.

for each gene family the chromosomal location and topologies  of those genes are given, which arose through duplications after the invertebrates-vertebrates split and before the tetrapods-fishes divergence. the percentage bootstrap support of the internal branches is given below each relevant topology.

the topology of the type where genes on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> clustered together and the gene on chromosome  <dig> formed an outgroup  depicts the simultaneous duplication of members of five gene families, i.e. gli, hh, inhb, igfbp , and slc4a. the third member of the slc4a family, i.e. slc4a <dig>  that forms an outgroup to the slc4a2-slc4a <dig> cluster, is on a different chromosome , suggesting that an independent translocation event followed the co-duplication.

the topology of the type where genes on hsa <dig> and hsa <dig> clustered together, while the gene on hsa <dig> branched next, and the gene on hsa <dig> formed an outgroup , is suggestive of another gene-cluster duplication event involving the members of erbb, znfn1a, and igfbp  gene families. in addition, the genes showing the topology of the type   maintained exactly the same order on the respective chromosomal segments, with znfn1a genes flanked by erbb and igfbp family members . this reflects a conservation of gene order following co-duplications.

in the previously published phylogeny of vertebrate hox clusters, hoxc and hoxd are grouped together, while the branching order of hoxa and hoxb is unresolved; two alternative topologies hoxa)hoxb) and ) are equally probable  <cit> . within the phylogeny of the sp family, the branching order of sp <dig>  sp <dig>  sp <dig>  and sp <dig> genes is congruent with one of the two proposed alternative phylogenies of hox clusters . consistent with the compatibility in their tree topologies, each of the relevant sp genes is closely linked with the hox cluster , with human sp <dig> gene mapping at approximately  <dig> kb centromeric to hoxc, sp2; at ~ <dig> kb centromeric to hoxb, sp3; at ~ <dig> mb centromeric to hoxd, and sp4; at ~ <dig> mb telomeric to hoxa. this implies that hox linked sp genes share the similar evolutionary history as the hox clusters and have arisen through the same duplication events that led to the hox clusters.

the phylogenies of the integrin beta chain and myosine light chain families, where the vertebrate genes on hsa <dig> and hsa <dig> clustered together and the gene on hsa <dig> formed an outgroup  revealed a fourth simultaneous duplication event. the fact that itgb <dig> on hsa <dig> grouped with itgb <dig> on hsa <dig> suggests that an independent translocation event followed the duplication of their ancestor after its divergence from the itgb <dig> gene .

the phylogeny of collagen genes showed a different topology  which is inconsistent with their having duplicated concomitantly with members of any other gene family that we included in the current study.

hox linked paralogous regions may not reflect the outcome of ancient block or whole chromosome duplication events
the occurrence of conserved paralogous regions on human hox-bearing chromosomes hsa 2/7/12/ <dig> has been taken as evidence that these chromosomes are related by two rounds of block, or whole chromosome doubling events  <cit> . this would imply that constituent genes including hox clusters on each of the relevant chromosomes are suggestive of the architecture of an ancestral block  where all of these genes were linked in a single copy  <cit> .

to test whether the four-fold paralogy seen on human hox-bearing chromosomes  is an outcome of doubling events of a single ancestral block, we employed the topology comparison approach to check the consistencies among the phylogenies of  <dig> gene families including the hox clusters. we recovered four independent co-duplicated groups involving the members from total  <dig> gene families. the largest co-duplicated group suggests the simultaneous duplication of members of five gene families  where the order and close physical linkage of constituent genes is largely disrupted, except gli and inhb genes which are tightly bound to each other on each of the relevant chromosomes . the second co-duplicated group involves the members from erbb, znfn1a, and igfbp families and indicates a conservation of linkage and gene order following co-duplication events . the hox clusters and members of the sp gene family represent the third co-duplicated group ; again the constituent genes remained closely linked on each of the relevant chromosomal segments. the fourth co-duplicated group involves the members from two gene families  where the linkage between the co-duplicated genes is largely disrupted, except on hsa <dig> where myl <dig> is closely linked to itgb <dig> gene .

our results show that extensive triplicate or quadruplicate synteny that is seen on the present day human hox-bearing chromosomes is not the outcome of two rounds of duplications experienced by a single ancestral block. instead, our data suggest that those members of hox linked gene families that arose within the time window of proposed block duplication events  can be divided into distinct co-duplicated groups. genes within a particular co-duplicated group share the same evolutionary history and duplicated in concert with each other, while the genes belonging to different co-duplicated groups may not share the evolutionary history and may not have duplicated simultaneously. we conclude that gene families with three or more members on human hox-bearing chromosomes might be the outcome of gene-cluster duplication events experienced by vertebrates at different time points in their evolutionary history, whereas their current triplicate or quadruplicate distribution on these chromosomes might be the consequence of chromosomal redistribution of multigene family members through extensive rearrangement of genomic segments encompassing multiple contiguous genes. this would imply that although different co-duplicated groups within human chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are remnants of waves of small-scale duplications  and chromosomal rearrangement events, they do not indicate a single ancestral block.

CONCLUSIONS
the four-fold paralogy regions  in the human genome, notably on hsa 1/6/9/ <dig>  hsa 4/5/8/ <dig>  hsa 1/2/8/ <dig> and the hox-bearing chromosomes hsa 2/7/12/ <dig> are considered to be shaped directly by two rounds polyploidy . our results show that the constituent gene families of the hox cluster paralogon have arisen largely by distinct duplication events, and their members were brought together in three or four collinear regions on different chromosomes  as a result of rearrangements of genomic segments including multiple contiguous genes, at least as early as before the divergence of bony fishes and tetrapods. this data suggests that linkage relationships seen on the human hox-bearing chromosomes are not an outcome of ancient block or whole chromosome duplications and thus should not be taken as evidence for two rounds of polyploidization events . this conclusion may have important implications in resolving the controversies about the evolutionary processes that had shaped our own genome.
