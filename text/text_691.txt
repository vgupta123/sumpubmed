BACKGROUND
the female gametophyte is an integral component of the plant life cycle and plays an essential role in plant reproduction. in most angiosperms including arabidopsis, the female gametophyte  typically consists of an egg cell, a central cell, two synergid cells, and three antipodal cells  <cit> . during double fertilization, the pollen tube penetrates one of the synergid cells and releases two sperm cells, which fuse with the egg cell and the central cell to give rise to the embryo and the endosperm, respectively  <cit> . the embryo forms the next generation while the endosperm functions to support embryo development and/or seedling development after seed germination  <cit> . normal seed development depends on the proper differentiation and functions of the central cell and the egg cell  <cit> . although the synergid cells do not directly contribute to the development of the seed after fertilization, they are required for pollen tube attraction  <cit>  and proper discharge of pollen tube contents  <cit> . in contrast to the other cell types of the female gametophyte, no clear function has been found for the antipodal cells thus far.

in arabidopsis and most other angiosperm species, the development of the female gametophyte follows a monosporic, polygonum-type developmental pattern, in which a single functioning megaspore undergoes three rounds of mitosis without cytokinesis, eventually producing a seven-celled structure with the egg cell and the two synergid cells at one pole , three antipodal cells at the opposite pole , and a large central cell in the center  <cit> . as in many other developmental processes  <cit> , cell differentiation in the female gametophyte is likely under the control of gene-regulatory networks that consist of transcription factors and their downstream targets. therefore, identification of transcription-factor genes expressed in the female gametophyte is an important step towards understanding female gametophyte development.

much of our knowledge about female gametophyte development has been obtained through the analysis of over  <dig> female gametophyte mutants  <cit> . however, only four of these mutants have been clearly shown to be affected in transcription-factor genes: agl <dig> and agl <dig> mutants are defective in central cell specification and development  <cit> , myb <dig> mutants show defects in synergid cell development and function  <cit> , and agl <dig> mutants are defective in megagametogenesis  <cit> . transcription-factor genes involved in the specific development of the egg cell or the antipodal cells have not been identified.

expression-based analyses have also been used to identify many genes expressed in the female gametophyte. for example, cdna libraries from isolated egg cell, central cell, synergid cells, or whole embryo sacs, have led to the identification of hundreds of female gametophyte-expressed genes in maize, wheat, tobacco, and torenia fournieri  <cit> . however, few transcription-factor genes have been reported in these studies. differential-expression screens using arabidopsis mutants including sporocyteless , determinate infertile  <dig> , and coatlique  that lack female gametophytes have been utilized more recently to identify genes that are expressed in the female gametophyte  <cit> . these mutants are defective either in the initiation of meiosis , progression through meiosis , or the initiation of megagametogenesis  and therefore do not produce any female gametophytes in an otherwise normal-looking ovule  <cit> . in these screens, mrna profiles from wild-type and mutant ovules or pistils were compared, and genes with reduced mrna levels  in the mutant as compared to wild type would include those that are expressed in the female gametophyte. these microarray-based screens have identified  <dig> down-regulated genes in spl ovules  <cit> ,  <dig> and  <dig> down-regulated genes in dif <dig> ovules  <cit> , and  <dig> down-regulated genes in coa pistils  <cit> . despite the large number of genes identified in these screens, only two transcription-factor genes, myb <dig>  <cit>  and at5g <dig>  <cit> , have been confirmed to be expressed in the female gametophyte. it is likely that standard microarray techniques are not sufficiently sensitive for the detection of low-prevalence mrnas typical of most transcription-factor genes  <cit> .

here we report the identification of a large number of transcription-factor genes expressed in the arabidopsis female gametophyte. using quantitative reverse-transcriptase pcr , we carried out a differential expression screen of  <dig>  transcription-factor genes and identified  <dig> genes down-regulated in dif <dig> mutant ovaries lacking female gametophytes. localization of transcriptional activities within the female gametophyte was confirmed for  <dig> transcription-factor genes using promoter:gfp fusions. of these, ten genes are predominantly expressed in a single cell type of the female gametophyte: the egg cell, the central cell, or the antipodal cells. the remaining seven genes are expressed in two or more cell types. we also show that  <dig> transcription-factor genes are transcribed in the embryo and/or the endosperm of early developing seeds. the majority of these transcription-factor genes have not been previously implicated in female gametophyte development or function. therefore, our results provide a valuable starting point for elucidating the gene-regulatory networks governing differentiation during female gametophyte development.

RESULTS
quantitative rt-pcr analysis of transcription-factor mrnas in ovaries
we carried out a differential expression screen to identify transcription-factor genes expressed in the late stages of arabidopsis female gametophyte development, during which female gametophyte cell types are established  <cit> . with some modifications, we employed a strategy we previously used to identify genes expressed during female gametophyte development  <cit> . in brief, we used qrt-pcr to identify mrnas with reduced levels in dif <dig> ovaries, which lack female gametophytes  <cit> , relative to male sterile <dig>  ovaries, which contain wild-type female gametophytes  <cit> . the qrt-pcr reactions were performed with rna samples obtained from dif <dig> and ms <dig> ovaries harvested from flowers at developmental stages 12c to  <dig>  <cit> , which, in wild type, contained female gametophytes at developmental stages fg <dig> to fg <dig>  <cit> . we normalized the raw threshold cycle values  for each ms <dig> or dif <dig> reaction against ct values obtained for actin <dig>  mrna . we quantified the relative changes in mrna levels between ms <dig> and dif <dig> ovaries by determining the differences between the normalized ct, ms <dig> and ct, dif <dig> values .

we carried out an initial qrt-pcr screen  of  <dig>  transcription-factor genes . to compare levels of transcription-factor mrnas in ms <dig> and dif <dig> ovaries, the normalized single or the averaged ct values for each tested transcription-factor mrna from the ms <dig> and dif <dig> rna sources were plotted against each other . the data indicated that the mrna levels of most transcription-factor genes were not affected in the ovaries by the absence of the female gametophyte . we considered mrnas with a ΔΔct value above  <dig>  or below - <dig>  to be differentially elevated in ms <dig> or dif <dig> ovaries, respectively . by this criterion,  <dig> mrnas were elevated in ms <dig> as compared to dif <dig>  and  <dig> mrnas showed an elevated level in dif <dig> . the latter group likely represents genes whose activity within the ovaries is increased due to the absence of the female gametophyte in the dif <dig> mutant plants and was not studied further. because the former group of transcription-factor mrnas represents genes that are likely expressed in the female gametophyte, we selected them for further analysis.

the  <dig> transcription-factor mrnas with ΔΔct values above  <dig>  in the primary screen were analyzed under more stringent qrt-pcr conditions. for this, we performed three additional sets of qrt-pcr reactions  using independently isolated ovary rnas . a high level of reproducibility was observed among the three biological replicates from both the ms <dig>  and dif <dig>  genotypes. we applied an arbitrary threshold  to define genes that display higher levels of mrna in ms <dig> versus dif <dig> ovaries. as shown in additional file  <dig>  of the  <dig> genes tested,  <dig> genes were confirmed to be down-regulated in dif <dig> ovaries.

analysis of transcription-factor gene promoter activities in the female gametophyte
to confirm that the transcription-factor genes identified from the qrt-pcr screens are transcriptionally active in the female gametophyte and to determine their patterns of expression, we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants carrying promoter:gfp fusion constructs for  <dig> of the  <dig> transcription-factor genes with ΔΔct values above the statistical threshold of the secondary qrt-pcr screen . in addition, we also tested  <dig> genes with ΔΔct values below the threshold to evaluate the stringency of the secondary screen . as discussed below, we detected promoter:gfp activity for  <dig> genes from the former group and three genes from the latter group indicating that our secondary qrt-pcr screen represented a relatively robust assay for identifying female gametophyte-expressed genes.

initially, we generated transgenic plants carrying promoter constructs for six transcription-factor genes using untargeted, cytosolic gfp  as a reporter . the promoter:cgfp expression patterns were primarily analyzed in the mature female gametophyte. as shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  all six genes showed patterns of promoter activity in one or more cells of the developing or mature female gametophyte. the activity of the at2g22750/bhlh <dig> promoter was not detected in mature female gametophytes, but weak gfp activity was detected in the antipodal cells at an earlier stage of development . in the mature female gametophyte, gfp activity driven by the at5g <dig> promoter was detected exclusively in the central cell . the other four promoter constructs showed more complex patterns of activity with gfp expression detectable in two  and three  cell types of the female gametophyte. these promoter-fusion expression patterns support the results from our qrt-pcr analysis that these genes are transcribed in the female gametophyte.

the genes are ranked in descending order based on the average ΔΔct value in the secondary qrt-pcr screen. average ΔΔct values and p values  were calculated as described in methods. gfp activity in female gametophytes was analyzed at one day after emasculation  and in early-developing seeds at flower stage  <dig> . a, antipodal cells; c, central cell; e, egg cell; em, embryo; en, endosperm; ne, no consistent expression; nd, not determined; s, synergid cells; (), weak expression.

 <dig> gfp activity was more intense in the micropylar endosperm compared to the chalazal and peripheral endosperm.

 <dig> gfp activity was not detected at fg <dig> but was detected at fg <dig> 

the cells of the female gametophyte are in close proximity especially in the micropylar pole where the egg cell is flanked by the two synergid cells and is positioned adjacent to the central cell cytoplasm  <cit> . using epifluorescence microscopy, it proved difficult to unambiguously determine the cellular patterns of promoter activity for genes that showed multi-cell-type expression patterns . in addition, our qrt-pcr analysis  suggests that most of the transcription-factor genes are expressed at low levels, which would produce weak gfp signals in promoter:gfp analyses. therefore, we generated a nuclear-localized version of gfp by fusing the coding region of an arabidopsis histone h2b gene  to the n-terminus of a single copy of gfp  or to two tandemly fused copies of gfp  in order to increase the resolution and sensitivity of our promoter:gfp analysis.

to test the utility of the nuclear-localized gfp constructs during female gametophyte development, we generated promoter constructs for genes at5g <dig> and at5g <dig> each fused to the n1gfp and n2gfp reporter genes, and compared their expression patterns in the mature female gametophyte to those obtained with the cgfp reporter . activities of both n1gfp and n2gfp driven by the at5g <dig> promoter were localized in the central cell nucleus . in rare instances, weak antipodal expression was also observed . this expression pattern agreed with the pattern obtained with the cgfp construct . for the pat5g01860:n1gfp and n2gfp fusions, strong gfp activity was detected in the central cell and antipodal cell nuclei, and weaker activity was detected in the egg cell and synergid cell nuclei . the expression patterns obtained for the n1gfp/n2gfp constructs were similar to that of the cgfp construct except that the cgfp antipodal signals were generally weaker and only observed in rare instances . we did not detect any adverse effects of n1gfp or n2gfp expression on female gametophyte development or function ; this observation is in agreement with previous reports where histone h2b fusions with yellow fluorescent protein or gfp were used in both animal and plant model systems without any detrimental effects on viability or development  <cit> . moreover, we did not find any qualitative differences in the patterns of expression for n1gfp versus n2gfp constructs for the same promoter sequences . these results demonstrate that the use of n1gfp/n2gfp reporters improved the sensitivity and spatial resolution of promoter:gfp analysis for studying gene expression patterns during female gametophyte development.

we constructed promoter fusions for  <dig> additional genes using n1gfp  or n2gfp  reporter constructs . eleven promoter fusions showed diverse patterns of expression in the mature female gametophyte , while the remaining seven genes did not show any reproducible level of gfp activity in mature female gametophytes . however, all of the latter genes showed specific expression in the seed or in the sporophytic tissues of the ovary  indicating that the constructs were functional. the promoter:n1/n2gfp constructs representing  <dig> genes  exhibited consistent patterns of gfp activity in the majority of primary transgenic  lines . as shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  expression in one, two, or all four cell types of the female gametophyte was detected using the n1/n2gfp constructs. single-cell-type expression in the central cell, egg cell and antipodal cells was detected for nine genes including at5g <dig> , at5g45980/wox <dig> , and at5g <dig> , respectively. three promoter-fusion constructs showed expression in two cell types : synergid-egg cells  and synergid-central cells . finally, expression of the at5g <dig> promoter-fusion was detected in all four cell types of the female gametophyte . some of the constructs showed a secondary set of expression patterns in a minority of t <dig> lines ; these patterns may be attributable to the sensitivity of the n1/n2gfp reporter constructs which potentially report low levels of endogenous gene transcription not detected using previous approaches. for all reporter constructs, n1/n2gfp localization was nuclear  except for at5g41090/nac <dig> where both nuclear and cytosolic localization patterns were observed . cytosolic localization may have resulted from an excessive amount of n2gfp fusion protein produced by a highly active promoter as the ct value for nac <dig> in ms <dig> ovaries  was the lowest  among the  <dig> transcription-factor genes analyzed using n1/n2gfp promoter-fusion constructs . taken together, these expression patterns demonstrate that we have identified  <dig> transcription-factor genes that are transcribed during late stages of female gametophyte development in arabidopsis .

patterns of transcription-factor gene promoter activities during megagametogenesis and early seed development
megagametogenesis and early endosperm development in arabidopsis are characterized by a series of nuclear divisions followed by cellularization  <cit> . we first examined the expression patterns of our reporter constructs at developmental stages fg <dig> to fg <dig> of megagametogenesis before the mature, cellularized stage of female gametophyte development. of the  <dig> genes tested, we did not detect a high level of promoter activity at these stages for most of the genes tested  except for at5g <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>  the promoter activity for at5g <dig> was observed in all nuclei from developmental stages fg <dig> to fg <dig>  <cit>  with equal signal intensity. after the fusion of polar nuclei, the level of gfp activity increased in the central cell and the antipodal cells as compared to the egg cell and the synergid cells . in this case, our data indicate that the initial transcriptional activity of at5g <dig> occurs as early as the initiation of megagametogenesis and that modulation of expression in late female gametophyte stages occurs after polar-nuclear fusion and immediately prior to fertilization.

to determine if the female gametophyte-expressed transcription-factor genes are also expressed during endosperm and/or embryo development, we analyzed all of our reporter constructs at flower stage  <dig>  <cit> , which corresponds to stages v  to vi  of endosperm development and in the elongated zygote to two-cell embryo-proper stage of embryogenesis  <cit> . we observed consistent embryo and/or endosperm expression for  <dig> promoter-fusion constructs . the majority of the reporter constructs  showed a relatively uniform pattern of expression in the endosperm when assayed using cgfp  or nuclear-localized gfp  while reporter constructs for genes at1g55600/mini <dig> and at5g <dig> showed preferential gfp activity in the micropylar endosperm . with two genes, wox <dig> and at2g40220/abi <dig>  expression was observed in early embryos with very low or no detectable activity elsewhere in early seeds . finally, the at2g <dig> promoter-fusion construct showed expression in both the embryo and endosperm . of the  <dig> transcription-factor genes expressed in the female gametophyte,  <dig> showed consistent expression in the seed . together, our analysis indicates that a significant portion of the female gametophyte-expressed transcription-factor genes are also transcribed during early seed development.

discussion
utility of our qrt-pcr-based differential-expression screen
we performed a two-step qrt-pcr screen to identify transcription-factor genes with reduced mrna levels in dif <dig> ovaries compared to ms <dig> ovaries. in the primary screen,  <dig> genes were identified as dif <dig> down-regulated  while  <dig> genes were identified as dif <dig> up-regulated . although dif <dig> and ms <dig> ovules are apparently indistinguishable in terms of integument morphology  <cit> , the other sporophytic organs/tissues of the dif <dig> ovaries may show altered gene expression patterns due to the absence of the female gametophyte. therefore, in addition to the female gametophyte-expressed genes that are of primary interest to this study, the dif1-down-regulated genes might include sporophyte-expressed genes that are induced by the female gametophyte. while this is an unlikely possibility for all of the transcription-factor genes assayed, the promoter-fusion assays were designed, in part, to address this issue . on the other hand, the dif1-up-regulated genes may include genes that are normally repressed in the ovary by the female gametophyte. although sporophyte-expressed genes of this type are not the focus of this study, these transcription-factor genes, once confirmed, could represent important developmental regulators mediating the communication between the female gametophyte and the surrounding sporophytic organs and tissues.

of the  <dig> dif1-down-regulated genes,  <dig> genes were further validated in an additional series of qrt-pcr assays  under more stringent pcr conditions . we and others previously used microarray-based differential expression screens to identify a total of  <dig> unique transcription-factor genes with reduced mrna levels in the ovules or pistils of spl, coa or dif <dig> mutant plants   <cit> . an additional screen comparing dif <dig> ovules to fertilized wild-type seeds led to the identification of another five transcription-factor genes   <cit> . however, there is no significant overlap in the detection of genes among the published microarray-based screens and the present study . this discrepancy may be attributed, in part, to differences in sampling of the material , the developmental staging of the material , or any effect the mutations might have had on the sporophytic tissues of the sampled material . a direct comparison of the approaches awaits further confirmation of the expression of the candidate genes.

of the  <dig> novel genes identified in this study   <cit> ,  <dig> genes were analyzed using promoter fusions with  <dig> showing transcriptional activity in the female gametophyte . such a high proportion of validated genes suggests that the majority of the original  <dig> genes uniquely identified in our qrt-pcr screen are likely transcribed in the female gametophyte. the failure to identify these  <dig> genes in the previous studies could be due to low mrna levels that are below the detection limits of the microarray assays. this conclusion is supported by our observation that the majority of these  <dig> genes showed relatively high ct values  in ms <dig> ovaries:  <dig> genes displayed normalized ct values above  <dig> , while the two genes  identified in the previous microarray studies displayed ct values between  <dig> and  <dig> . taken together, our results demonstrate that our qrt-pcr-based differential expression screen is sensitive enough to detect low-prevalence mrnas of transcription-factor genes in the female gametophyte.

identification of transcription-factor genes expressed in the female gametophyte
we tested  <dig> of the  <dig> transcription-factor genes exhibiting reduced mrna levels in dif <dig> ovaries in our qrt-pcr-based screen  using promoter:gfp fusions and confirmed that  <dig> are transcribed within the female gametophyte . the single non-expressing-promoter construct  may not have contained all the cis-regulatory sequences required for proper expression in the female gametophyte. of the  <dig> genes that were not tested using promoter fusions, one  had been isolated using a similar differential screen and its promoter activity in the female gametophyte had been described previously  <cit> . therefore, it is likely that most of the remaining untested genes are also expressed in the female gametophyte. in addition, we tested nine genes below the statistical threshold of the secondary screen using promoter fusions . three exhibited female gametophyte expression , suggesting that additional female gametophyte-expressed genes can be identified in this group. of a total of  <dig> genes exhibiting female gametophyte expression,  <dig> were predominantly transcribed in a single cell type: the egg cell , the central cell , or the antipodal cells . the remaining seven genes were transcribed in multiple cell types within the female gametophyte .

our analyses uncovered novel patterns of transcription-factor gene activity in the female gametophyte and during early seed development. we also confirmed some previously described patterns of gene activity, supporting our general approach to identifying low-prevalence transcription-factor mrnas in the female gametophyte. six transcription-factor genes displayed strong promoter:gfp activity exclusively  or predominantly  in the central cell and also in the endosperm . among these, zou/rge1/bhlh <dig> encodes a bhlh transcription factor that has been proposed to regulate endosperm adhesion and breakdown which, in turn, is required for the proper epidermal development of the embryo  <cit> . our promoter-fusion analysis suggests that zou/rge <dig> is transcribed in the central cell, the synergid cells, and the endosperm . this differs from the previous reports where expression of zou/rge <dig> was only observed in the endosperm  <cit> . the discrepancy may be due to different promoter lengths and the type of reporter genes used in the studies. rl <dig> encodes a myb-related transcription factor expressed in the micropylar endosperm  <cit> . the expression patterns of the remaining four "central cell-endosperm" genes  have not been described previously. however, supporting our promoter-reporter data, an analysis of the publicly available microarray data using genevestigator indicates mrna accumulation for at5g <dig> and myb <dig> in the endosperm https://www.genevestigator.com.

in contrast to the genes with transcriptional activity in both the central cell and the endosperm, we detected endosperm expression for three genes that showed no expression in the central cell . the transcriptional activity of at5g <dig> or at2g <dig> has not been described previously. however, available microarray data indicate mrna accumulation for both genes in laser-captured endosperm samples https://www.genevestigator.com <cit> . mini <dig> encodes a wrky transcription factor that has been shown to regulate endosperm growth and cellularization  <cit> . we detected mini <dig> promoter activity in the endosperm but not in the female gametophyte  in agreement with a previous report  <cit> .

three transcription-factor genes exhibited strong promoter:gfp activity exclusively  or predominantly  in the egg cell . all three were expressed in the embryo after fertilization . abi <dig> is primarily expressed in the embryo during seed maturation and encodes an ap2-erebp transcription factor required for aba and sugar signaling during seed development and germination  <cit> . transcription of abi <dig> in the egg cell has not been reported previously. wox <dig> encodes a homeobox transcription factor that is involved in regulating early embryo development  <cit> . using in situ hybridization, wox <dig> mrna has been localized to the egg cell and the basal-cell lineage of the developing embryo  <cit> . however, our wox <dig> promoter fusion showed expression in both the apical and basal cell lineages of the embryo . this construct may not contain all of the cis-regulatory elements required for proper transcription of the reporter gene including elements to suppress transcription in the apical cell lineage. alternatively, wox <dig> mrna may be degraded preferentially in the apical-cell lineage or be redistributed to the basal cell upon the first zygotic division as has been suggested previously  <cit> . we also detected reduced mrna levels in dif <dig> ovaries for at5g54070/hsfa <dig> and at1g21970/lec <dig>  previously shown to be required for embryogenesis  <cit> . transcriptional patterns of these two genes in the female gametophyte remain to be determined.

we found that among the  <dig> transcription-factor genes active in the female gametophyte, nine genes are highly transcribed in the synergid or the antipodal cells , the two cell types of the female gametophyte that do not give rise to any cells or tissues of the developing seed. the promoter fusions for nac <dig> and at3g <dig> were expressed predominantly in the synergid cells with weak expression in the egg cell or the central cell . this is essentially similar to the expression pattern observed for myb <dig>  <cit> . we found that rl <dig> is also expressed in the synergid cells, the central cell, and the egg cell . myb <dig> has been shown to control at least a portion of the gene regulatory network required for proper synergid cell differentiation  <cit> . therefore, nac <dig>  at3g <dig> and rl <dig> may constitute additional components of the same or a larger network controlling synergid cell differentiation and function. at the opposite, chalazal pole, we have identified six transcription-factor genes that are highly expressed in the antipodal cells . the function of these genes is not known. among them, at1g35520/arf <dig> might play a role in the transcriptional regulatory networks responding to the plant hormone auxin, which has been shown recently to regulate cell fate specification in the female gametophyte  <cit> .

among the  <dig> transcription-factor genes we have described here , only one gene  previously had been shown to be functionally required in the female gametophyte  <cit> . it is possible that gene redundancies or functional compensations may have precluded isolation of these transcription-factor genes in genetic screens for female-gametophyte mutants. this hypothesis is supported by the observation that some of the genes identified in this study are structurally similar. for example, three  of the five c2h2-type transcription-factor genes we identified are closely related homologues  <cit> . interestingly, a number of the female gametophyte-expressed transcription-factor genes isolated in this study  have been shown to be required after fertilization  <cit> . it remains to be determined whether they perform any function in the female gametophyte as individual genes, or as members of multi-gene families with complex expression programs encompassing both the gametophytic and the zygotic portions of the plant life cycle.

CONCLUSIONS
to begin to identify the gene-regulatory networks controlling angiosperm female gametophyte development, we performed a large-scale qrt-pcr-based differential expression screen of nearly all transcription-factor genes in arabidopsis ovaries. compared to microarray-based methods  <cit> , our approach proved to be more sensitive and allowed the identification of  <dig> transcription factor genes, the majority of which previously had not been identified as female gametophyte-expressed genes. we further confirmed transcriptional activity of  <dig> genes in the female gametophyte using promoter-fusion analyses. using a nuclear-localized gfp reporter, we have developed female gametophyte-cell-specific marker lines well suited for monitoring individual cell fates during female gametophyte development and early seed development. transcription factors are at the center of gene regulatory networks and perform essential regulatory roles in development and cell differentiation  <cit> . the transcription-factor genes identified in this study can be used to dissect the gene regulatory networks in the female gametophyte through a combination of genetic and molecular approaches, ultimately enabling a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control female gametophyte development and function during plant reproduction.
