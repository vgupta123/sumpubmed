BACKGROUND
plant mitochondrial genomes are complex because they encode significantly more genes than do their fungal and animal counterparts. investigations of the mitochondrial genome sequences of at least  <dig> angiosperm species, including arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , beta vulgaris  <cit> , oryza sativa  <cit> , brassica napus  <cit> , zea mays  <cit> , nicotiana tabacum  <cit> , triticum aestivum  <cit> , vitis vinifera  <cit> , citrullus lanatus and cucurbita pepo  <cit> , and vigna radiata  <cit> , together with physical mapping  <cit> , have showed several properties of plant mitochondrial genomes, such as large size , slow rates of evolutionary change, incorporation of foreign dna, a multipartite structure, and specific modes of gene expression , etc  <cit> . these properties cannot easily explain how the diverse mitotypes evolved within each plant genus or species. to understand the evolutionary peculiarity of plant mitotypes, which are defined as mitochondrial genome types of which there can be more than one within one plant species or genus, more systematic sequences are needed. to date, no systematic sequences of one angiosperm genus with multiple species had been used to analyze the derivation of mitochondrial genome, and thus the mechanism underlying the peculiarity has not been revealed. here, we selected brassica as an evolutionary clade in which to analyze the evolutionary relationships of brassica mitotypes by sequencing.

brassica contains six cultivated species that are very important for producing vegetables and oilseeds. the nuclear genomic relationships between the six species were showed by the u with cytogenetics approach  <cit> , which has been popularly accepted as u's triangle theory . however, the cytoplasmic relationship between the six species needs to be further explored, although the entire sequences of two mitotypes of brassica napus have been reported  <cit>  with a focus on the mechanism of cytoplasmic male sterility , and mitochondrial dna  of three brassica species has been physically mapped  <cit> . here, we report the sequence of the mitochondrial genomes of b. rapa , b. oleracea , b. juncea , and b. carinata . together with previously reported mitochondrial genome sequences of the pol and nap mitotypes in b. napus  <cit> , we compared the six mitochondrial genome sequences to learn the mechanism of formation for brassica mitochondrial genomes.

RESULTS
brassica mitochondrial genomes
brassica comprises six cultivated species  <cit> : b. rapa , b. oleracea , b. napus, b. juncea , b. nigra, and b. carinata . the sizes of entire single circular mitochondrial genomes of cam , jun , ole , and car  are  <dig>  bp,  <dig>  bp,  <dig>  bp, and  <dig>  bp, respectively. the mitochondrial genomes of car and ole are larger than these of cam, jun, pol, and nap. the ole mitotype is larger because of the duplication of a  <dig>  kb segment. the g+c content of the six mitotypes ranges from  <dig> % in nap to  <dig> % in car, with slight differences among mitotypes. similarly, nucleotide base content varies slightly in the six mitotypes. the total length of genes with known functions differs between the mitotypes. the percentages that the total length of genes with known functions accounts for the mitochondrial genomes are almost the same in the cam, jun, ole, pol, and nap mitotypes, but the percentage in car is  <dig> % , less than that of the other five mitotypes, perhaps as a result of differentiation of brassica mitotypes.

the percentage of gene length accounting for the entire genome is indicated in parentheses. cam, jun, ole, and car denote the mitotype of b. rapa, b. juncea, b. oleracea, and b. carinata, respectively. and the pol and nap denote two mitotypes of b. napus.

analysis of genes with known functions showed that these six mitotypes share  <dig> species of protein-encoding genes,  <dig> species of ribosome genes, and  <dig> species of trna genes ; paralogous genes present in more than one copy are counted here as one species. however, the ole and car mitotypes lack the complex-iv-related cox2- <dig> gene found in the other four mitotypes and the cms-related genes  found in the pol and nap mitotypes  <cit> . the cam and jun mitotypes that have identical gene constitution, also lack the cms-related genes . the numbers of genes with known functions are almost the same in all six mitotypes, but the total number of genes varies with mitotype, ranging from  <dig> in car to  <dig> in ole .

+ denotes present, - denotes absent. gene copy number is shown after +. data for pol and nap are from our previous report and handa's results  <cit> , respectively.

previous studies have reported physical maps of the cam  <cit>  and ole  <cit>  mitochondrial genomes. we found that the length of cam sequence is almost the same as that obtained from the physical map , but because of a large duplication, the length of the ole mitotype is  <dig>  kb, much larger than that previously reported from physical mapping . a reasonable explanation for the discrepancy may be that the large repeats of ole are difficult to detect by physical mapping.

repeats
large repeats are a cause of the formation of the multipartite structure of the brassica mitochondrial genome, including one master circle and two smaller subgenomic circles, through reversible homologous recombination  <cit> . a pair of large  repeats, called the rb repeats, identified in pol and nap is also found in the cam, jun, and ole mitotypes, but only one copy of rb is found in the car mitotype . two other pairs of large repeats, r <dig> and r <dig>  are also found in ole; r <dig> is an mtdna fragment  <dig>  kb in size, and r <dig> carries two exons of the nad <dig> gene and is  <dig>  bp in size. one copy of r <dig> is found in all other mitotypes except the ole mitotype. car contains two copies of the  <dig>  bp r repeats that are not homologous to the repeats of rb, r <dig> , one copy of rb, and one copy of r <dig>  therefore, the multipartite structures of cam, jun, pol, and nap might result from the same large rb repeats, and the multipartite structure in car might result from r repeats, but the multipartite structure in ole is complex and is not predicted because it has multiple large repeats. the sizes of multipartite circles for the other five mitotypes except ole predicted by this inference are given in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> 

tandem repeats exist in all six mitotypes. frequency distribution analysis of the six mitotypes shows that the size of tandem repeat is mainly between  <dig> and  <dig> bp, and median of the number of repeats is mainly 2- <dig> . short repeats range from  <dig> to  <dig> bp in length with a total number of approximately  <dig>  accounting for roughly 5% of the entire mitochondrial genome.

short repeats are closely related with an irreversible re-organization of the brassica mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . the short repeats are uniformly distributed in the six mitochondrial genomes, as detected by the kolmogorov-smirnov method  <cit> . this may imply that there are prerequisites for the irreversible rearrangement. to investigate the relationships of syntenic region rearrangements, syntenic regions were numbered . we found that some rearrangements of numbered regions are associated with short repeats. for example, figure 4a shows that in the cam and ole mitotypes, syntenic segments  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were rearranged together with sequence direction changes, and the recombinations that resulted in these rearrangements are related to the short repeats marked q, which are made up of approximately  <dig> bp repeats within the neighboring segment. another typical example is the short repeat of about  <dig> bp : the separated segments  <dig> and  <dig> that contain the short p repeat in the car mitotype were recombined into the rearranged form in ole omitting the p repeat . these findings are evidence for an association of short repeats with rearrangements.

a  <dig>  kb segment duplication in the ole mitotype was the main factor influencing the differences in the number of functional genes between ole and the other five mitotypes. this large duplicated  <dig> genes with known functions and several partial exons, including three exons of nad <dig>  three exons of nad <dig>  and three exons of nad <dig>  this partial duplication of the mitochondrial genome and the resulting dramatic change in the copy number of genes and orfs of b. oleracea suggests that the role of ole mitotype is different from that of the other five brassica mitotypes in cytotype-nuclear genotype interactions or plant-environment interactions.

inheritance of mitochondrial genomes in brassica
by comparing the complete sequences, we found that the cam and jun mitotypes have the same genome organization and are closely related at the nucleotide sequence level. according to u's triangle for the cytological relationship between brassica species, b. juncea is derived from the offspring of an interspecific cross between b. rapa and b. nigra; thus, the cam mitotype of b. rapa can be inferred to have been transmitted into b. juncea without a significant genomic change. similarly, the pol mitotype in b. napus, which is postulated to be derived from the offspring of an interspecific cross between b. rapa and b. oleracea according to u's triangle, has only one region different from cam, suggesting that pol also inherited the cam mitotype, with an evolutionary modification. at the modification position, pol has a  <dig> -kb insertion and cam has an 813-bp insertion, suggesting that pol was derived from cam at this location through evolutionary modifications resulting in a 813-bp sequence deletion and  <dig> -kb sequence insertion. the relationship between pol, jun, and cam shows that the cytoplasmic origin of plant species can be traced because the mitochondrial genome is conserved. on the other hand, this pattern of mitotype inheritance in plants, for which we are presenting the first evidence, indicates that the evolution of new composite species is not always accompanied by sudden mitochondrial genome changes, or that new species may inherit maternal mitochondrial genomes with a few insertions/deletions , as shown in the pol mitotype. this mitotype inheritance mechanism might be involved in other composite plant species formed by chromosomal doubling or interspecies hybridization.

mitochondrial genome restructuring
relative to three highly similar mitotypes , nap, ole, and car were found to be restructured mitotypes. the genomic structure of the ole mitotype is different from that of cam , and it can be inferred that, relative to cam, the genomic structure of ole has experienced at least four recombination events. the recombination events and a large duplication   made the ole mitotype distinct from the other five mitotypes. relative to ole, the car mitochondrial genome has as many as  <dig> syntenic regions , suggesting that the car mitotype restructuring is more complex. the number of recombination events in the process of mitochondrial genome formation in car is difficult to estimate, because there are so many syntenic regions.

the similarities between the syntenic regions  of the six brassica mitotypes are very high, with the lowest nucleotide identity being 87% and most of the nucleotide identity being more than 99%, indicating that the syntenic regions are consistently conserved in brassica.

mitotype divergence
structural comparisons between two mitotypes help to identify indel sequences present in one mitochondrial genome and absent  in another. indels frequently found in both coding and non-coding gene regions of plant mitochondrial genomes can provide evolutionary clues  <cit> . to illustrate the genomic differences, we summed the length of indels found in a mitochondrial genome comparison and defined a dissimilarity indicator to measure the divergence between two mitochondrial genomes using indels and single nucleotide polymorphisms  between them. cluster analysis of the six mitotypes showed that cam and pol are in one class, ole slightly diverges from the cam-pol class, and nap and car have diverged the furthest from the cam-pol group .

combined indel analysis of multiple mitochondrial genomes showed that all insertions in the cam, jun, pol, and ole mitotypes can be aligned with other mitotypes. however, for some insertions in the nap and car mitotypes, matching sequences with high homology could not be found in other brassica mitotypes. these unmatched insertions account for  <dig> % of the nap mitotype  and  <dig> % of the car mitotype .

variation of open reading frames with unknown functions
using the orf finder software at ncbi, the cam, pol, nap, ole, and car mitotypes were found to contain  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> species of orfs with unknown functions, respectively, indicating that the numbers of orfs in the six mitotypes are different . on the other hand, the six mitotypes share  <dig> orfs with unknown functions: orf100b, orf101a, orf101b, orf <dig>  orf106b, orf108b, orf <dig>  orf113a, orf115a, orf115c, orf115d, orf <dig>  orf <dig>  orf <dig>  orf <dig>  orf <dig>  orf <dig>  orf <dig>  orf <dig>  and orf <dig>  another  <dig> orfs sequences are not possessed consistently by all of the six brassica mitotypes  . this result suggests that the inclusion of orfs with unknown functions in different mitotypes are very different.

each line presents the homologous orfs. +, present; -, absent; gr, gene rearrangement; id, insertion/deletion; m, mutation. orf copy numbers are shown ahead of +. class shows the cause of change in each line.

* indicates an exception for class and that the cause is mutation.

# orf <dig> and orf <dig> are the same as table  <dig> 

data for pol and nap are from our previous report and handa's results  <cit> , respectively. the total numbers outside parentheses show the changing orf for each mitotype; the number in parentheses contains the orfs that exist consistently in the six mitotypes. the total number of orfs in ole is not plus the multiple copies, if containing the copies the total number is  <dig> 

genome rearrangement may result in loss of orfs through a dna break within an orf, which results in loss of the orf or generation of a novel orf through the recombination of the broken sequences with others. in our analysis, three polymorphic orfs were found to be due to genome rearrangement . for example, the breakage of orf101c at position + <dig> due to genome rearrangement has led to the loss of this orf in car, and the orf <dig> sequence in nap was lost in the course of rearrangement, generating orf <dig>  <cit> . in car, breakage of the orf <dig> sequence at position + <dig> was followed by recombination of its terminal sequence with another sequence, resulting in orf <dig> of the car mitotype.

ten polymorphic orfs were caused by indels , indicating that indels had a direct influence on orf variation. orf101d and orf <dig> are absent in car, orf117b is absent in cam and pol, orf <dig> and orf <dig> are absent in nap and car, and orf <dig> and orf138a exist only in car. the region including orf <dig> in pol and orf <dig>  orf <dig> in nap is contained in an insert region, as shown in comparison of the two mitotypes .

twenty-one out of the  <dig> polymorphic orfs resulted from nucleotide mutations , suggesting that mutations have a more important role than other evolutionary events in mitotype formation in brassica. there are a total of  <dig> mutation sites in the  <dig> polymorphic orf sequences, of five mitotypes, of which  <dig> sites are frame-preserving mutations although the length of orf is changed, three sites are single nucleotide mutation sites resulting in premature stop codons, four are triplet indels of less than  <dig> nucleotides in length , which cause length variation among the homologous orfs, and the other  <dig> sites are non-triplet indels, including two sites of  <dig> bp indels, six sites of  <dig> bp indels, four sites of  <dig> bp indels, five sites of  <dig> bp indels, and  <dig> sites of indels more than  <dig> bp. for example, orf <dig> is incomplete because of several nucleotide mutations in car. in the ole mitotype, mutation of nucleotides tc to aa at positions + <dig> and + <dig> in orf120a occurred together with a agtatt insertion at +  <dig> to generate orf120a.

little is known about the roles of the predicted orfs, because limited studies have been carried out on them. only one orf, the cms-related orf <dig> , has been demonstrated to be important, but the orfs with unknown functions specific to brassica could have a particular role in the mitochondrial activities of a particular species  <cit> .

given the above-mentioned numbers of polymorphic orfs with unknown functions, the importance of the roles of the three evolutionary factors in genome formation may be arranged in the following order: mutation > segment indel > genome rearrangement. the mechanism including these evolutionary factors undoubtedly changed the mitochondrial genome structure and orfs, but these factors influencing the brassica mitochondrial genomes did not alter the constitution of the gene species  with known functions, which is almost same as the situation in a. thaliana  <cit> . this result suggests that genes with known functions in the mitochondrial genomes are not changed, and it may indicate that the genes with known functions are too important to be lost or indispensable across the long evolutionary time in the plant genus or within several closely related species.

discussion
mitotype formation in brassica
in previous analyses of plant mitochondrial genomes, several evolutionary factors, such as duplication, rearrangement, indel, and mutation, have been found to be important in genome evolution  <cit> . in this study, as well as these evolutionary factors, we have shown for the first time that mitotype inheritance can explain well the formation of some of the mitotypes  of brassica. thus, we suggest that the brassica mitotypes are derived through a mechanism including several evolutionary events, such as inheritance, duplication, rearrangement, indel, and mutation of the plant mitochondrial genome sequence. however, this is not our final conclusion on mitochondrial genome formation because this cannot explain the phenomena resulting from our syntenic region alignment.

we have inferred the origin of two mitotypes , but how have the other four mitotypes originated? we analyze this result as follows.

first, u's triangle can help reveal the origin of mitotypes . from the cytogenetics of brassica, the composite species have been thought to be formed by interspecific hybridization between elementary species and following chromosome doubling, and the mitotypes of composite brassica may be regarded as having been derived by inheritance from corresponding maternal parents with primary mitotypes. in the past, the maternal parents of amphiploid species were inferred to be the species with more chromosomes on basis of the crossability between two parents. for example, b. rapa is regarded as the ancestral female parent for b. napus because a cross with b. rapa as maternal parent and b. oleracea as male parent is easier to accomplish than its reverse cross, and mitotypes of b. napus including nap can be regarded as inherited from the cam mitotype  although this lacked evidence at the molecular level.

second, our combined insertion alignment results show that the insertions in the cam, jun, pol and ole mitotypes can be aligned with other brassica mitotypes. this result implies that, if we regard cruciferous species with bigger mitochondrial genomes than most brassica as ancestral species, the brassica mitotypes can be inferred to have evolved from a common ancestral parent with all the mitochondrial genome information of brassica mitotypes, and which existed after the so-called mitochondrial genome expansion of angiosperms  <cit> . the indels in brassica mitotypes may be traces of deletions from the common ancestral parent. if we do not accept this hypothesis, then we must postulate that the insertion sequences were obtained through horizontal transfer or transfer from the nuclear genome  <cit> . the possibility that insertion sequences are transfers from the nuclear genome can be ruled out because none of them can be aligned with the nuclear dna in a search of ncbi sequence databases. as for insertion sequences from horizontal transfer between mitochondria, the concept is seemingly logical but currently lacks supporting evidence. in addition, the so-called transfers have been considered to be random transfers, so we cannot conceive why the same insert sequences are found in different mitotypes. thus, we conclude that there has been some genome compaction during the process of mitochondrial genome evolution.

third, there are two mitotypes identified in b. napus, the nap and pol mitotypes  <cit> . the nap mitotype, discovered by shiga and thompson  <cit> , exists popularly in natural rapeseed germplasm population with usually male fertile phenotype in most genetic backgrounds. the pol mitotype, which is sparse in natural rapeseed germplasm, resulting in cytoplasmic male sterility with easily-found restorer lines, was discovered first by fu  <cit> , has been widely used in to generate heterosis. no other natural mitotype apart from these two mitotypes of b. napus has been identified. also, no other natural mitotype for the elementary species of brassica apart from those studied here has been identified, and thus how the nap mitotype has been inherited appears to remain unsolved. nevertheless, the nap mitotype might have been inherited from an unidentified or lost mitotype of b. rapa, which has very rich germplasm, and then experienced mitochondrial genome evolution events as mentioned above. similarly, the formation of the car mitotype found in the composite species b. carinata can be explained by the same mechanism as that proposed for the nap mitotype. our previous results  <cit>  demonstrated that the nap and pol mitotypes coexist in b. napus: the pol cytoplasm consists mainly of the pol mitotype, and the nap mitotype is the main genome of nap cytoplasm. in this case, the inference that the maternal parent of nap mitotype is b. rapa, is further supported because the coexistence does not contradict the genome compaction hypothesis. mitotype coexistence has also been demonstrated in other plant species, such as phaseolus vulgaris  <cit> . whether mitotype coexistence can be regarded as vestige of ancestral maternal mitochondrial genome compaction needs to be further explored, but the compaction may be a cause of mitotype diversification for the different species with different nuclei  as a result of adaptation of each plant species to internal and external environment.

finally, from the above analysis, mitotypes for elementary species of brassica can be regarded as the products of condensation or compaction of a bigger ancestral mitochondrial genome accompanied by long-term evolution history changes that may be necessary for adaptation to their environments, or be random evolutionary events such as mutation. composite species may be inferred to have been derived from maternal mitotype inheritance and the following modification of maternal mitotype .

additionally, intergenic regions of the mitochondrial genome were not found to be conserved in other studies  <cit> , but our results on intergenic regions seem to be inconsistent with this conclusion. a reasonable explanation is that the mitotypes in our analysis belonging to the same genus in which closely related species were formed through genome compaction. in previous studies, either the analyzed materials were not as closely related as in our study, or the origins of the indels  were not elucidated. our results may be an addition to the evolutionary theory of the mitochondrial genome.

evolutionary pattern of plant mitochondrial genomes
mitochondrial genomes are considered to be have evolved monophyletically from a eubacterial ancestor  <cit> . the evolutionary trends are different between animals and plants over their long evolutionary history. the trend in animals is towards a further compaction of the mitochondrial genome through loss of genes and intergenic spacers, as exemplified in homo sapiens and metridium senile  <cit> . conversely, the mitochondrial genomes in plants and fungi have experienced mtdna expansions, including increases in size, primarily by acquisition of a large amount of apparently non-coding dna of currently unknown origin and function  <cit> . this description is summarized as the serial endosymbiosis theory, which remains unrefuted  <cit> .

nevertheless, our research with brassica as a phylogenetic model clade has demonstrated that a compaction mechanism has been involved in plant mitotype evolution. this phylogenetic pattern within a brassica clade coincides well with the properties of the animal clade. given this conclusion, one difference in the evolutionary mechanism between animals and angiosperms may be that the mitochondrial genome has undergone an expansion process in angiosperms but not in animals.

mitotype effects
rapeseed breeders pay much attention to cytoplasmic effects. from our results, the jun and cam mitotypes do not have the cms-related orf <dig> gene found in nap or the homologous cms-related orf <dig> found in pol, and other genes with known functions are almost the same as in the nap, pol or jun mitotype, so jun and cam may probably be beneficial to breeding of conventional varieties of b. napus because the cms-related gene is usually regarded as being noxious to plants  <cit> . the fact that the amphiploid b. juncea is more tolerant to stressful environments than b. napus  <cit>  is probably related to the mitotype differences between b. juncea and b. napus. potential uses of the ole and car mitotypes in brassica crop breeding need to be explored.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has compared the sequences of six brassica mitotypes. the pol mitotype of b. napus and the jun mitotype of b. juncea are found to be an inherited form of the cam mitotype with less modification. this result may have implications for the mitochondrial genome origin of other composite plant species formed by chromosomal doubling or interspecific hybridization. sequence relationship analyses showed that a mechanism of genome compaction and inheritance has been involved in brassica mitotype evolution. our study suggests a mechanism of mitochondrial genome formation in brassica including evolutionary events such as inheritance, duplication, rearrangement, sequence compaction , and mutation.
