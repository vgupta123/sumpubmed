BACKGROUND
btub  is a  <dig> amino acid outer membrane protein of escherichia coli. it is responsible for the uptake of cobalamins  <cit> , such as vitamin b <dig> including cyanocobalamin, hydroxocobalamin, methylcobalamin, and adenosylcobalamin <cit> . it also serves as the receptor for bacteriophage bf <dig>  <cit> . the synthesis of the btub protein in e. coli is regulated at the translational level by adenosylcobalamin  which is produced by the btur protein   <cit> . btur is an atp:corrinoid adenosyltransferase and converts cobalamins to ado-cbl  <cit> . in the presence of ado-cbl, the stability of the btub mrna is reduced with a half-life of only  <dig> -  <dig> minutes  <cit> . in addition, ado-cbl binds to the leader region  of the btub mrna and suppresses its translation  <cit> . a 25-nucleotide sequence designated as the b12-box located + <dig> - + <dig> nucleotides downstream from the transcription initiation site of btub in e. coli has been suggested to be the binding site of ado-cbl  <cit> . a b12-box is also present in the 5' utr of both btub and cbia genes of s. typhimurium  <cit> . the btub gene of s. typhimurium is highly homologous to that of e. coli. the cbia protein is a cobyrinic acid a, c-diamide synthase using cobyrinic acid as substrate  <cit> . binding of ado-cbl to the 5' utr of the mrnas of these genes may interfere with ribosome binding and thus decrease their translation  <cit> .

it is unknown whether btub synthesis is also controlled by regulatory proteins at the transcriptional level. results of this study suggest that gadx  is a transcriptional regulator of btub. gadx has been shown to suppress the expression of pera encoded by a plasmid of enteropathogenic e. coli  <cit> , but activate gadx, gada, gadb, and gadc in response to acid stress  <cit> . gada and gadb are isozymes of glutamate decarboxylases that convert glutamate to γ-aminobutyric acid  which is then exported by the antiporter protein gadc  <cit> . an intracellular proton is consumed during gaba production  <cit> , but the released gaba, which is less acidic than glutamate, provides local buffering of the extracellular environment.

the expression of gadx is activated by the alternative sigma factor rpos during the stationary phase of growth  <cit> , but is repressed during the exponential phase by the nucleoid protein h-ns due to its binding to the gadx promoter or its destabilizing effect on rpos  <cit> . however, the acid stress increases the rpos level and thus induces gadx expression even during the exponential phase of growth  <cit> . gadw, like gadx, belongs to the family of arac-like regulators. it represses the expression of gadx and inhibits the activation of gada and gadbc by gadx  <cit> . in addition to these trans-acting proteins, the production of gadx is also controlled by gady that is located between gadx and gadw in an opposite orientation to gadx  <cit> . the gady gene has no known protein products. it produces three rna species of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nucleotides with a common 3' end  <cit> . the 3' ends of gadx and gady rnas overlap by at least  <dig> nucleotides and are complementary to each other. annealing of gady rna to the 3' end of gadx mrna stabilizes gadx mrna, resulting in an increased production of the gadx protein  <cit> .

btub is also involved in the import of colicins such as colicin e <dig>   <cit> . cole <dig> is composed of three domains responsible for the translocation of cole <dig> through the ompf porin, binding of cole <dig> to btub, and cleavage of dna  <cit> , respectively. the import of cole <dig> is dependent on the tol  system that is composed of tolq, tolr, tola, and tolb proteins  <cit> . deletion or mutation of btub, ompf, or any of the tol proteins renders e. coli resistant to cole <dig>  <cit> . based on this information, we used a cole <dig> resistance assay in this study to search for transcriptional regulators of btub from a genomic library of e. coli strain dh5α and found that gadx and gady genes down regulate the expression of btub.

RESULTS
screening of genes conferring e. coli resistance to cole7
to search for genes that can confer e. coli resistance to cole <dig>  plasmids in the genomic library were transformed into the cole7-sensitive e. coli strain dh5α, and the transformants were plated on lb agar plates containing  <dig> μg/ml of ampicillin and  <dig>  ng/ml of his6-tagged cole7/ime <dig>  two colonies were seen after incubation at 37°c overnight. the plasmids of each colony were isolated after culturing in  <dig> ml lb medium containing  <dig> μg/ml of ampicillin then retransformed into dh5α. the new transformants were plated on agar plates containing  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , or  <dig>  ng/ml of his6-tagged cole7/ime <dig> to confirm their resistance to cole <dig>  the insert in the plasmid that conferred dh5α resistance to  <dig>  ng/ml his6-tagged cole7/ime <dig> was sequenced. a  <dig> -bp dna region on the chromosome at position  <dig> to  <dig> was analyzed that contains both complete gadx and gady genes. the plasmid was thus named pgadxy .

to determine whether gadx or gady was responsible for cole <dig> resistance, pgadx, pgady, and pgadxy that contain gadx, gady, and gadxy, respectively, were separately introduced into e. coli strain dh5α and then assayed for their ability to confer cole <dig> resistance.  <dig> ×  <dig> cells containing pgadx, pgady, or pgadxy were plated on lb agar containing  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , or  <dig>  ng/ml of his6-tagged cole7/ime <dig>  cells containing the vector pgad <dig> were also plated to serve as controls. the percent survival of cells containing pgad <dig>  pgadxy, pgadx, and pgady in the presence of  <dig>  ng/ml of his6-tagged cole7/ime <dig> were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> %, respectively, and  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> %, respectively, in the presence of  <dig>  ng/ml of his6-tagged cole7/ime <dig>  only pgadxy conferred cole <dig> resistance to  <dig>  and  <dig>  ng/ml of his6-tagged cole7/ime <dig> with  <dig>  and  <dig> % survival rates, respectively .

detection of protein whose expression is affected by gadxy
to investigate the mechanism by which gadxy affects cole <dig> resistance, the expression levels of btub, tolq, tolr, tola, tolb, pal, and ompf that are involved in cole <dig> import were determined by western blotting, and btub was the only protein found to be affected. its expression level was reduced by 93% in the presence of gadxy  as determined by densitometry.

effect of gadxy on btub promoter
to determine whether gadxy affects the transcription of btub, the β-galactosidase reporter assay was performed. the 461-, 673-, 913-, and 1285-bp dna fragments  containing the promoter of btub were fused with the lacz coding sequence to generate pcb461lacz, pcb673lacz, pcb913lacz, and pcb1285lacz, respectively. each of these single copy plasmid together with pgad <dig> or pgadxy was transformed into e. coli strain dh5α. the transformed cells were grown in lb medium with  <dig> μg/ml of chloramphenicol and ampicilin to od600~ <dig>  then assayed for β-galactosidase activity as described by miller  <cit> . the β-galactosidase activity of cells containing pgadxy and a pcb derivative with the btub promoter-lacz fusion was divided by that of cells containing the control plasmid pgad <dig> and the same pcb derivative to determine the percent decrease in btub promoter activity in the presence of gadxy. the btub promoter in the 461-, 673-, 913-, and 1285-bp dna fragment was found to be decreased by  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> %, respectively in the presence of gadxy, and was about  <dig> fold more active in the 1285-bp fragment than in other fragments .

binding of gadx to btub promoter
gadx has been shown to be a dna binding protein and can bind to the gada or the gadb promoter. to determine whether gadx also binds to the btub promoter, the dna mobility shift assay was performed. only gadx was assayed because gady does not encode any proteins. the 461-bp dna fragment containing the btub promoter was labeled with 32p and incubated with  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> pmoles of purified gadx protein  that was fused to the maltose binding protein. the dna fragment containing the promoter of gada or gadb was used as the positive control for gadx binding, and the dna fragment containing the pal promoter was used as the negative control. as shown in figure  <dig>  dna band shift was observed on gada and gadb promoter fragments but not on the negative control. band shift was also observed on the btub promoter fragment in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that gadx binds to the btub promoter.

identification of binding sequence of gadx on btub promoter
dnase i footprinting was then performed to determine the binding sequence of gadx on the btub promoter. the 461-bp dna fragment containing the btub promoter was labeled with 32p and incubated with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> pmoles of purified male-gadx protein and then digested with dnase i. results shown in figure  <dig> revealed three male-gadx protein binding sites that included nucleotide positions + <dig> - + <dig> , + <dig> - + <dig>  and + <dig> - + <dig>  on the 5' untranslated region of btub.

decreased btub expression under acidic conditions
it is known that gadx and gady are more highly expressed under acidic environments in stationary phase  <cit> . to determine whether the expression of btub is also repressed in an acidic condition, wild type bw <dig> cells were cultured in lb medium ph  <dig>  or buffered with  <dig> mm mes ph <dig> . stationary phase cells grown in different culture media were collected and then assayed for the transcriptional level of btub by quantitative real-time pcr. the cdna amplification comparison results showed the transcription of gadx with  <dig> -fold increase but the level of btub was reduced to 57% .

discussion
although it has been suggested that the expression of btub in e. coli is also regulated at the transcriptional level, the trans-acting regulators of btub had not been identified  <cit> . in this study, we used the cole <dig> resistance assay to search for such regulators and found that both gadx and gady genes can repress the production of btub rendering e. coli dh5α cells resistant to cole <dig>  introduction of pgadx, which contains a gadx gene, into dh5α cells caused  <dig> % of the cells to become resistant to  <dig>  ng/ml of cole <dig>  in a similar experiment, pgady which contains the gady gene enabled  <dig> % of the cells to grow in the presence of the same concentration  of cole <dig> . although gady does not encode any proteins, it had a greater effect on making e. coli resistant to cole <dig> than gadx. this is probably due to the binding of gady rna derived from pgady to the gadx mrna produced by the gadx gene in the chromosome. this binding stabilizes gadx mrna so that more gadx protein is produced to suppress the production of btub, making the cells resistant to cole <dig>  the greatest effect  on cole <dig> resistance was seen when pgadxy, which contains both gadx and gady genes, was introduced into the cells. since pgadxy is a high copy number plasmid, more gadx and gady mrnas would be produced and thus more gadx protein would be synthesized to suppress btub synthesis. however, excess gadx had adverse effects as over expression of gadx with a strong promoter, such as the t5-laco promoter, was found to have toxic effect to e. coli  <cit> . therefore, expression of gadx and gady in this study was driven by their own promoters.

since gadx is a known transcriptional regulator  <cit> , the decrease in btub expression is due to its transcriptional repression by gadx. our data showed that the btub promoter activity was reduced by approximately 50% in the presence of gadxy , most likely due to binding of gadx to the 5' untranslated region of btub as dnase i footprinting experiment revealed binding of gadx to nucleotides positions + <dig> - + <dig> , + <dig> - + <dig>  and + <dig> - + <dig>  downstream from the btub transcription initiation site . from the sequence alignment of gadx binding sites on btub, gada, and gadbc regulatory regions <cit> , we found that sequence in the region i  has  <dig> % identity  with gadbc and sequence in the region iii  has  <dig> % identity  with gada regulatory region. from the footprinting result, the gadx binding sites on 5' untranslated region of btub share only partial homology with the  <dig> nucleotides consensus sequence which was reported by tramonti et. al. <cit> . the sequence analysis also revealed the btub expression was regulated by the binding of gadx on its 5' untranslated region. binding of transcriptional regulator to the 5' untranslated region to regulate gene expression is also seen in the glp regulon of e. coli, in which four repressor binding sites are located at - <dig> to - <dig>  - <dig> to - <dig>  + <dig> to - <dig>  and + <dig> to + <dig> of the glpacb genes  <cit> . in addition, two ihf binding sites are present downstream from the glpt transcriptional start site at positions + <dig> to + <dig> and + <dig> to + <dig>  <cit> .

in the btub promoter assay experiment, different lengths of dna fragments containing btub promoter were fused to lacz. the minimum length of dna fragment with btub promoter activity was  <dig> bp spanning - <dig> to +  <dig> nucleotides relative to the translation initiation site of btub. no significant difference in promoter activity was observed when the 5' end of these fragments was extended to - <dig>  however, a  <dig> fold  increase in promoter activity was detected when the dna fragment was extended to - <dig> with a total length of  <dig>  bp as compared to that of the 461-bp fragment. it is very likely that a certain transcription regulator binds to the region between - <dig> and - <dig> and enhances the expression of btub. the β-galactosidase activity in these assays was not very high because the lacz fusions were constructed using the single copy plasmid vector pcc1bac™ . the purpose of using the single copy number plasmid in this experiment was to mimic the natural state of btub expression in e. coli. in fact, the promoter activity of btub is lower than other membrane protein, we have determined the ompc promoter activity, under the same test condition the miller's units of lacz driven by ompc promoter is  <dig> folds higher than that of btub .

although the results of footprinting and reporter assay revealed that the gadx binding sites on btub 5' untranslated region share only partial homology with the gadx binding consensus sequence <cit>  and showing 50% down regulation in the reporter assay, the expression of btub was indeed controlled by gadx.

both gadx and gady genes belong to a group of genes that are induced by acid stress under stationary growth phase  <cit> . our data showed that the expression of btub was indeed reduced when e. coli cells were grown to stationary phase in an acidic medium as compared to the same cells grown in neutral medium . the reduction in the production of btub in response to acid stress probably represents a physiological regulatory mechanism of bacteria facing environmental challenges such as low ph. under stress environment, bacteria need to alter their metabolism to adapt to the environmental change. the transportation of cobalamin by btub receptor is driven by proton motive force  <cit> . since the pmf of bacteria is increased at low ph <cit> , the cobalamin transportation may be enhanced by increased pmf. the higher concentration of cobalamin in cytoplasm will initiate riboswitch mechanism to repress the translation of btub receptor, which is in good accord with the repression of btub transcription by the acid-induced gadx for bacteria to decrease the production of btub in response to this acidic stress.

CONCLUSIONS
through biological and biochemical analysis, we have demonstrated the gadx can directly interact with btub promoter and affect the expression of btub. when bacteria were grown to stationary phase in an acidic medium, the increased gadx expression would repress the btub transcription to help bacteria to adapt to acidic shock. in conclusion, this study provides the first evidence that the expression of btub gene is transcriptionally repressed by the acid responsive genes gadx and gady.
