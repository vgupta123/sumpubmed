BACKGROUND
invertebrate ecological studies have found infection outcomes within a given host-parasite system are variable. parasite genotypes vary in their ability to infect, host genotypes vary in their ability to defend against infection, and infection outcome is based on the combination of both hosts’ and parasites’ genotypes . that is, some interactions between invertebrate hosts and their parasites show specificity  <cit> . how is this level of specificity generated? an obvious answer would be an interaction between the parasite and the host’s immune response. this cannot be taken for granted however. various ecological measures of disease outcome have been used to quantify genotype-genotype interactions. these measures include host mortality, fecundity and infection rate. such measures cannot test directly if it is the immune response that produces this level of specificity  <cit> . it may be other non-immune processes, such as behavioural modification, reproductive isolation or life-history strategy changes, could explain such outcomes.

the interaction of the trypanosomal gut parasite crithidia bombi with its host, the bumblebee, bombus terrestris displays host x parasite genotype-genotype interactions  <cit> . in this system, infection success depends on which strain is infecting which colony . there is evidence that the immune system has a role in generating this host-parasite specific response. a number of studies have found differential immune gene expression in response to crithidia. previous work in our lab found increased crithidia loads in bees whose expression of antimicrobial peptides was knocked down by rnai  <cit> . it has even been shown that bees from different host genotypes induce differential expression of antimicrobial peptides , according to the strain of c. bombi they had been infected with  <cit> , that is specificity was found in the immune response itself. a recent paper using rna-seq found numerous genes are differentially expressed in a genotype-genotype fashion  <cit> .

although ideally we would have separate measures of infection levels, we could not do this due to a limited number of age controlled bees per colony. based on their presumed importance in fighting crithidia infections as mentioned above, we used antimicrobial peptide  expression as a proxy for a strong immune response in this manuscript.

here, we carry out a transcriptome-wide analysis of gene expression in bees during c. bombi infection . we have carried out four analyses, comparing 1) expression in infected and non-infected bees  <dig> hours after infection by crithidia bombi  2) expression at  <dig> and  <dig> hours after c. bombi infection , 3) determining differential gene expression associated with the host-parasite genotype-genotype interaction at  <dig> hours post infection  and 4) determining alternative splicing associated with the host-parasite genotype-genotype interaction at  <dig> hours post infection . enrichment analysis was also carried out on differential expression data to see which categories of molecules are differentially regulated during infection. the results confirm our previous findings of up-regulation in antimicrobial peptide expression and provide a comprehensive overview of changes in and the specificity of gene expression and alternative splicing after exposure to  <dig> strains of c. bombi.

RESULTS
the bumblebee colonies  and crithidia bombi strains  used during this experiment are as previously described  <cit> . we have chosen samples that displayed a reciprocal pattern of expression for the three antimicrobial peptides  tested in that paper. these were colony k <dig>  and q <dig>  and strains  <dig> and  <dig>  k- <dig> showed a high expression in each of these amps, q- <dig> a low expression level, q- <dig> a high level and k- <dig> a low level of amp expression. bees were infected with various strains of crithidia for either  <dig> or  <dig> hours. rna samples were then collected and rna-seq was carried out on these samples.

the sequences, statistics and annotations for all differentially expressed genes in each of the three differential expression analyses are available in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

genes differentially expressed at  <dig> hours post-infection 
here we determined transcripts that are differentially expressed upon infection with crithidia at  <dig> hours post-infection . we used both colonies and bees were infected with either strain  <dig> or  <dig>  the statistical model was ). <dig>  unique transcripts were mapped to the transcriptome.  <dig> transcripts were found to be differentially expressed  <dig> hours post-infection , including  <dig> downregulated and  <dig> upregulated transcripts. reannotating the transcripts using blast2go ,  <dig> had no blast hits. a further  <dig> had uninformative blast hits . the remaining  <dig> were used in the enrichment analysis. figure  <dig> shows a summary of the enriched go terms found . defense response  and chitin metabolism  were the only processes significantly enriched at a more stringent level .figure  <dig>

peritrophic membrane
the peritrophic matrix  forms a layer composed of chitin and glycoproteins that lines the insect midgut lumen  <cit> . the pm facilitates digestion and forms a protective barrier to prevent the invasion of ingested pathogens  <cit> . fibrillin  <dig> , a venom protein precursor , neurotrypsin , peritrophin-1-like  and four chitinase transcripts  are downregulated upon infection. fibrillins are extracellular matrix macromolecules, ubiquitous in the connective tissues  <cit> . btt32193_ <dig> was classed as a venom protein, but was also very similar to chitinase  <dig> . chitinases modulate the structure and porosity of the pm  <cit> . neurotrypsin is a serine protease expressed in the nervous system  <cit> . however in the protease domain it shares similarities with sp22d, a chitin binding serine protease  <cit> . the chitin fibrils of the pm are assembled into a wide cross-hatched pattern connected by peritrophins  <cit> . a second group made up of peritrophin- <dig>  and  <dig> further chitinase transcripts  is upregulated. figure  <dig> shows the correlation of expression patterns between these sixteen transcripts related to chitin metabolism. there is some clustering, but not of any clear functional groups. taken together this differential expression suggests an important role for the repair or restructuring of the peritrophic matrix in the bumblebees’ response to crithidia.figure  <dig>

receptors
when the blast searches against the iiid and nr databases were combined, we found that  <dig> transcripts relate to canonical insect immune genes. we describe them in the order receptors, serine proteases, signalling pathways and effectors  <cit> .

the down syndrome cell adhesion molecule , a pattern recognition receptor containing immunoglobulin domains has come to the forefront of research into insect immune specificity. through alternative splicing it can generate thousands of different splice forms which would potentially allow an insect to recognise subtle differences in parasites. its expression has been associated with infections in drosophila and mosquitoes  <cit> . we found five downregulated transcripts annotated as immunoglobulin superfamily   and one upregulated transcript .

signalling pathways
the insect immune system is regulated by three major signalling patways: toll, imd and jak/stat  <cit> .

we found a transcript for spatzle  downregulated at this time point. activation of the toll immune pathway requires the activation of spatzle <cit> . myd <dig>  is a death domain-containing adaptor activated by toll leading to the activation of pelle. dorsal  was also downregulated. the nuclear translocation of dorsal, a member of the nf-kb family, in the toll pathway induces the expression of many immune genes. we found an upregulated transcript  for helicase89b part of the toll and imd pathway. it is required downstream of nf-kb for the activation of amp genes in drosophila melanogaster <cit> . ird <dig>  codes for a catalytic subunit of an ikappab kinase that cleaves relish. relish, a nf-kb factor in the imd pathway, is an essential regulator of antimicrobial peptide gene induction.

in mammals semaphorins are crucially involved in various aspects of the immune response  <cit> . a semaphorin-5a-like transcript  was downregulated  <dig> hours post-infection. semaphorin regulates the activity of ras-family small gtpases  <cit> . a ras-like protein11b transcript  was also downregulated. the ras/mapk pathway was found to be essential for the suppression of the imd immune pathway in drosophila  <cit> .

drumstick  interacts with the jak/stat pathway during its’ development role  <cit> , but we could not find any information about its immune role. two transcripts  of puckered were downregulated. puckered, which codes for a dual specificity phosphatase, is a key regulator of the c-jun-n-terminal kinase  immune pathway  <cit> . mpk2/p38a  is involved in the jnk pathway and jak/stat pathway. heat-shock factor activation by p <dig> is a recently discovered part of antimicrobial reactions in drosophila <cit> . we found two heat shock protein transcripts  and one other  that were downregulated and upregulated respectively. these are all involved in the jak/stat pathway.

effectors
in our previous paper  <cit>  we found that antimicrobial peptides were upregulated at  <dig> hours post-infection. we would expect the same trend here. indeed, we found that five transcripts for defensin  and three hymenoptaecin transcripts  were all upregulated. an apidaecin precursor  was downregulated. apidaecin has recently been shown to be expressed in bumblebees  <cit>  including in response to crithidia <cit> . the downregulated beta-amyloid-like protein  has been shown to be an antimicrobial peptide in mammals  <cit> . hemolectin  is a clotting protein known to have a role against gram-negative bacteria  <cit> .

reactive oxygen species  are generated by respiration in the mitochondria or as part of the immune response  <cit> . p <dig> cytochromes are oxidases acting terminally in monooxygenase systems  <cit> . some are regulated in response to infection possibly either as direct immune responders  <cit> , producing nitric oxide  or other reactive oxygen radicals or as part of the host detoxification process decreasing oxidative stress after an infection  <cit> . a number of cytochromes p <dig> were differentially expressed  <dig> hours post infection. ten cytochrome p <dig> transcripts  were found to be downregulated. three other cytochrome p <dig> transcripts  were upregulated. several other cytochromes  were downregulated.

numerous other actors in the production of ros were found to be differentially expressed. tpx <dig> , coding for a thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase, which detoxifies hydrogen peroxide was downregulated. this gene was found be differentially expressed during plasmodium infection in anopheles gambiae <cit> . calcineurin  was found to be downregulated  <dig> hours post-infection, which agrees with our previous findings  <cit> . in infected d. melanogaster larvae, no signals are enhanced by calcineurin to promote induction of systemic immune responses via the imd signalling pathway  <cit> .

we found downregulation of sortilin-related receptor-like . in mammals, sortilin aids in phagocytosis  <cit> . two downregulated transcripts  were matched to croquemort, which codes for a key scavenger receptor although of apoptotic cells rather than parasites  <cit> . annexin ix  has been shown to be induced by septic injury in drosophila and is thought to encode for an anticoagulant  <cit> .

miscellaneous
major royal jelly protein  has been shown to have antimicrobial properties and to be expressed in response to bacterial infection in honeybees  <cit> . vitellogenin  is a potent regulator of the immune response in honeybees  <cit> . several orthologs of putative drosophila immune loci were differentially expressed  <dig> hours post-infection . the downregulated cg <dig>  is weakly analogous to tnf receptor associated factor  <dig>  that mediates signal transduction involved in mammalian immune responses. downregulated btt37289_ <dig> codes for a putative fatty acyl-coa reductase.

genes differentially expressed between  <dig> hours post-infection and  <dig> hours post-infection 
here we determined the gene expression difference between  <dig> hours and  <dig> hours post infection . both colonies were used but only strain six was used for infection. the statistical model was .

 <dig> transcripts were differentially expressed between  <dig> hours post-infection and  <dig> hours post-infection. of these  <dig> had no blast hits. a further six had uninformative blast hits . the remaining  <dig> were used in the analysis. defence response was the only go term significantly enriched compared to the whole transcriptome , with seven transcripts. three transcripts correspond to hymenoptaecin . they were all upregulated. this suggests a continuing strong amp production  <dig> hours after infection. this agrees with other immune assays in bumblebees  <cit> . argonaute- <dig>  a rna-silencing endonuclease, is involved in antiviral defence in insects   <cit> . gstd <dig>  a glutathione s-transferase, is involved in the detoxification process   <cit> . dopa decarboxylase  converts l-dopa to dopamine during the melanisation process  <cit> . scr-b <dig>  codes for a scavenger receptor protein. scavenger receptor proteins have been found to be microbial pattern recognition receptors in drosophila <cit> .

genes differentially expressed depending on host genotype – parasite genotype interactions 
we choose samples that displayed a reciprocal pattern of expression for the three antimicrobial peptides   in a previous study  <cit> . these were colony k and q and strains  <dig> and  <dig>  k- <dig> showed a high amp expression, q- <dig> a low expression level, q- <dig> a high level and k- <dig> a low level of amp expression. all data was collected at  <dig> hours post infection. the statistical model was .

there were  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts . reannotating the transcripts using blast2go ,  <dig> had no blast hits. a further  <dig> had uninformative blast hits . there were  <dig> transcripts that had previously been found to be differentially expressed at  <dig> hours post infection.

of the  <dig> transcripts,  <dig> were upregulated and  <dig> were downregulated. up or downregulation does not have the same meaning here as in the infected versus uninfected model were there was a clear baseline . our model used colony k strain  <dig> as the final contrast. from our previously published qpcr data  <cit> , we know the colony k strain  <dig> interaction displayed the highest levels of amps . therefore when we say a transcript is upregulated, we mean it is upregulated in this high immune response interaction.

as with the infection data, we combined the blast searches against the iiid and nr databases. ninety transcripts correspond to canonical insect immune genes. we again describe them in the order receptors, serine proteases, signalling pathways and effectors.

receptors
two transcripts were associated with gram-negative binding proteins . although gnbps are most associated with defense against gram-negative bacteria, they have been show to have a role in response to plasmodium infections  <cit> . c-type lectins  bind carbohydrates and mediate processes including pathogen recognition  <cit> . ctl <dig> is agonist to plasmodium infections in mosquitoes  <cit> . a ctl <dig> transcript  was found to be downregulated.

one downregulated transcript was related to dscam . a further fourteen downregulated transcripts were part of the ig superfamily  and one was upregulated . dscam and most of the other ig superfamily transcripts cluster together in the top right of figure  <dig>  suggesting they are similarly expressed.figure  <dig>

signalling pathways
the toll-like receptor 18wheeler  and toll  <dig>  were both upregulated. 18wheeler has been shown to be important in the anti gram-negative immune response in drosophila larvae  <cit> . dorsal 1a , a transcription factor that is an important part of the toll pathway, was downregulated. a transcript for spatzle 1- <dig> was also downregulated .

the tyrosine kinase pvr , which inhibits jnk activation  <cit>  was downregulated. jun, a transcription factor of the jnk pathway was downregulated . mpk2/p38a  and mapkkk <dig>  are mitogen-activated protein kinases involved in the jnk pathway and jak/stat pathways. we found two heat shock protein transcripts  and one other  that were downregulated and upregulated respectively. these are all involved in the jak/stat pathway. akt  <dig>  is part of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor  <dig> signaling  cascade. iis plays a critical role in the regulation of innate immunity. activation of akt signaling leads to a decrease in malaria infection intensity in mosquitoes  <cit> .

effectors
five transcripts relate to the amps defensin  and hymenoptaecin . they were all upregulated. an apidaecin precursor  was upregulated. hemolectin had three downregulated transcripts  and one upregulated . argonaute- <dig>  a rna-silencing endonuclease, is involved in antiviral defense in insects   <cit> .

eater encodes a transmembrane receptor involved in phagocytosis in drosophila <cit> . a transcript  relating to eater was upregulated. the melanisation process component dopa decarboxylase  was upregulated. another enzyme involved in melanisation, laccase was found to be downregulated   <cit> .

a cytochrome p <dig> transcript cyp4p <dig> btt40653_ <dig> was upregulated. two previously unseen cyp4p <dig> transcripts  were upregulated and one  downregulated. tpx <dig>  that codes for a thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase was downregulated.

miscellaneous
a small number of transcripts were related to chitin metabolism. scrasp <dig> has a chitin-binding domain that has been hypothesized to sense chitin in response to injury and to transduce signals via the serine protease domain  <cit> . we found an upregulated transcript related to scrasp  <dig> . a peritrophin precursor was also upregulated , as was a chitinase  <dig> transcript .

retinoid and fatty-acid-binding protein   was downregulated. rfabp was found to be upregulated upon injection of lps in drosophila during a proteomic study  <cit> . notch  is involved is involved in many signaling events in development including the specification of crystal cells in drosophila melanogaster <cit> . finally, several orthologs of putative drosophila immune loci were found to be differentially expressed .

genes alternatively spliced depending on host genotype – parasite genotype interactions 
using an interaction model in dexseq we identified genes which show differential exon usage due to the interaction of strain and colony . the complete output of the dexseq analysis is available in the additional file 2: table s <dig>   <dig> loci displayed alternative splicing depending on the the interaction between the host genotype and the parasite genotype. the sequences, statistics and annotations for these loci is available in the additional file 3: table s <dig>   <dig> of the loci had a significant match against the insect innate immunity database . eleven of these are related to receptors including lectins , beta- <dig> -glucan recognition protein  and seven transcripts relating to immunoglobulin and fibronectin domains . several of these transcripts containing immunogloblin and fibronectin domains returned dscam as a blast hit. the transcript with the largest number of alternatively spliced exons was xloc_ <dig> xloc_ <dig> with  <dig> variable exons out of  <dig> total exons . against the bombus terrestris genome a blast search of xloc_ <dig> xloc_ <dig> returned a twitchin-like gene . xloc_ <dig> xl oc_ <dig> aligns with the first  <dig>  base pairs of the twitchin-like gene . our cufflinks twitchin gene model matches almost perfectly the one generated automatically by the bombus genome team.figure  <dig>

 differential exon usage for each of the four host-parasite strain combinations . dexseq removes the gene-level changes in expression so the differential exon usage is clear. below is the gene model produced by our cufflinks analysis. the grey blocks are normal exons, the purple blocks represent those exons showing alternative splicing.



CONCLUSIONS
we present a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of gene expression in this important model host-parasite system. we have identified  <dig> bumblebee genes whose expression are changed upon infection with crithidia. we also found  <dig> genes whose expression is associated with the interaction between host and parasite genotypes and therefore show specificity in their expression patterns. six hundred and fifteen genes showed alternative splicing in response to parasite-strain interactions.

our amp expression data is consistent with the proposed importance of antimicrobial peptides in the specific defence against crithidia <cit> . it is also clear that several other effectors including ros and phagocytosis may be important. several immune pathways seem to be invovled in the anti-crithidia response. these include the toll, imd and jak/stat pathways.

there are a larger proportion of receptor transcripts showing differential expression found in the specificity analysis  compared to the infection analysis . this is not surprising, as it is be expected that a specific immune response to a given strain would be based mainly on how it is recognised. although several receptors, including gnbps and lectins, are differentially expressed, the most exciting discovery is the large number of transcripts related to dscam. the down syndrome cell adhesion molecule , a pattern recognition receptor has come to the forefront of research into insect immune specificity as thousands of different splice forms are generated and it is associated with insect immunity  <cit> . in the fruit fly drosophila, silencing of dscam retards the insect’s capacity to engulf bacteria by phagocytosis  <cit> . in mosquito anopheles, the dscam splice forms produced in response to parasite exposure differs between bacteria and the malarial causitative agent plasmodium and between plasmodium berghei and plasmodium falciparum <cit> . this has been tempered by the finding that dscam diversity does not increase with exposure to increasing heterogeneity of plasmodium falciparum genotypes  <cit> . recently it has been shown that dscam specificity is mediated by the transcriptional regulation of specific splicing factors downstream of the activation of the toll and imd pathways  <cit> . our results suggest that dscam related genes may be important in differentiating strains of the trypanosome crithidia bombi.

the alternative splice analysis also found a number of receptor genes. this included numerous dscam related genes. this is encouraging as alternative splicing is the mechanism through which dscam generates the variation that is thought to be useful for immune recognition  <cit> . the gene with the largest number of alternatively spliced exons was twitchin. this gene was also downregulated  <dig> hours post- infection . five different transcripts of twitchin  were expressed in a genotype-genotype fashion in the specificity differential expression analysis. like dscam, twitchin possesses a large nymber of fibronectin and immunoglobulin domains. twitchin is part of the titin family of genes. they produce large filamentous proteins that mediate the transduction of mechanical signals in muscles  <cit> . however a titin gene was found to show differential exon usage depending on if a mosquito was infected with bacteria or plasmodium <cit> . twitchin is an exciting possible candidate gene for the source of specifcity in this system and could be a fruitful avenue of research.

a large number of genes are downregulated after infection. naively, we might expect genes fighting infections to be upregulated after infection. we have two possible explanations. the more exciting of the two is that the parasites are modifying the immune response. trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of chagas disease has been shown to do this in it’s insect host  <cit> . the other is that for a lot of the earlier responder genes such as receptors we may have missed the peak of their expression with our earliest timepoint being at twenty four hours post-infection. repeating at earlier timepoints would establish if that was the case.

we infected the bees with faceces from other bees. we chose this method over in vitro culturing to prevent possible attentuation of strains’ infectivity associated with culturing  <cit> . one possibility is that by using faeces we may be introducing hidden infections or gut microbiota from the donor queens. we have attempted to mitigate this by using bees from a single colony to culture and grow the crithidia. although the queens faeces may indeed contain hidden infections and microbiota, they all must be passed through the same host background before they are used experimentally.

we found a number of genes associated with chitin metabolism differentially regulated  <dig> hours post-infection. through several pathways chitin metabolism is fundamental to invertebrate immunity  <cit> . as an aside, an intriguing hypothesis is that chitin metabolism is the nexus through which defense against predators and against parasites are traded-off  <cit> . our data suggests that the peritrophic matrix may be fundamental in the bee’s defence against crithidia. the peritrophic matrix acts as an immunological barrier against trypanosomes. tsetse flies with an underdeveloped pm have lower levels of refractoriness to trypanosome infections  <cit> . this is due to a premature immune response; the trypanosomes get through the pm quicker and stimulate the immune response at an earlier stage compared to refractory tsetse flies.

a recently published paper by one of the authors, found genotype x genotype interactions in the expression of a smaller number of genes  <cit> . we hypothesise that our much larger catalogue of genes, including dscam and twitchin, is due to our different experimental design. they had four colonies and three parasite strains all from queens caught in the same local area. we choose samples that displayed a  <dig>  ×  <dig>  reciprocal pattern of expression for the three antimicrobial peptides   in a previous study  <cit> . these were colony k and q and strains  <dig> and  <dig>  k- <dig> showed a high amp expression, q- <dig> a low expression level, q- <dig> a high level and k- <dig> a low level of amp expression. the two colonies used were from different populations, one wild caught and one commercial. this increased the potential differences in their response to the two strains. in turn, this increased our likelihood of detecting differential expression and exon usage using rna-seq.

in this paper we have shown that the expression and alternative splicing of immune genes is associated with specific interactions between different host and parasite genotypes in this bumblebee/trypanosome model. future rnai work could knockdown candidate genes thereby altering these specific interactions to directly examine their biological significance.
