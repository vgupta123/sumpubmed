BACKGROUND
parkinson's disease  affects 1% of the population over the age of  <dig> and is the second most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder after alzheimer's disease   <cit> . the classical symptoms of pd include resting tremor, muscular rigidity and bradykinesia  <cit>  resulting from the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra region of the brain  <cit> . intracellular inclusions known as lewy bodies  and lewy neurites , composed primarily of insoluble aggregates of ubiquitin and α-synuclein , are neuropathological hallmarks of pd found in many regions of the brain and central nervous system   <cit> . point mutations and multiplication of the αs gene are associated with rare early onset familial forms of the disease, further implicating the role of αs in pd  <cit> . the increased degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of pd animal models correlates with increased levels of lbs and lns in this region of the brain and strongly suggests that overexpression of αs selectively targets dopaminergic neurons  <cit> . while it is unclear why dopaminergic neurons are more susceptible to degeneration by αs, the oxidation of dopamine and exposure to neurotoxins such as rotenone  <cit>  and 1-methyl-4-phenyl- <dig> , <dig> -tetrahydropyridine   <cit>  generate excessive reactive oxygen species , promoting mitochondrial complex i dysfunction  <cit>  and depleting glutathione levels  <cit>  ultimately causing acute parkinsonism in animal and cell models. in addition, overexpression of both wild type  and mutant αs results in formation of cytoplasmic inclusions and degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in mouse and drosophila models  <cit> .

αs is a presynaptic protein expressed at synaptic terminals in the cns  <cit> . while αs is a natively unfolded protein, the monomeric form can misfold and aggregate into larger oligomeric and fibrillar forms which are linked to the pathogenesis of pd. recent studies have implicated small soluble oligomeric and protofibrillar forms of αs as the most neurotoxic species  <cit> . while previous studies provide good evidence for the intracellular toxicity of αs in pd, there is also evidence showing an extracellular component as well  <cit> . monomeric and oligomeric forms of αs have been detected in blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of pd patients  <cit> , and exposure to extracellular pre-aggreated αs induces cytotoxicity in primary mesencephalic neuron-glia and human neuroblastoma cell cultures  <cit> .

since generation of ros has been correlated with onset of pd, anti-oxidants may have therapeutic value. curcumin, a polyphenolic compound commonly used as food additives in asian cuisine, has anti-oxidant properties and suppresses inflammatory responses of brain microglial cells  <cit> . curcumin was also shown to have protective effects in neurodegenerative disease by either reducing inflammation and oxidative damage in ad  <cit> , or by inhibiting protein misfolding and aggregation in creutzfeld-jakob disease  <cit>  and pd  <cit> .

given these numerous beneficial properties, curcumin shows promise as a therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative diseases. we show that curcumin can provide protection against αs-induced cytotoxicity in sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells by decreasing cytotoxicity of aggregated αs, reducing intracellular ros, inhibiting caspase- <dig> activation and ameliorating signs of apoptosis. we also show that either extracellular addition of oligomeric αs and intracellular overexpression of αs increases generation of intracellular ros in sh-sy5y cells and both have similar cytotoxic effects resulting in induced caspase- <dig> activity and apoptosis.

RESULTS
curcumin protects sh-sy5y cells against extracellular αs-induced cytotoxicity
extracellular incubation of sh-sy5y cells with oligomeric but not monomeric or fibrillar αs induced significant cytotoxicity  in agreement with previous studies implicating oligomeric αs as the toxic species  <cit> . while co-incubation of curcumin does not alter the monomeric and pre-formed oligomeric αs morphologies, it does destabilize pre-formed αs fibrils , consistent with previous results  <cit> . page and afm size distribution data also confirm that curcumin does not alter the molecular weight or size of the oligomeric αs species . toxicity assays show that addition of curcumin significantly reduces the αs-induced toxicity induced by pre-formed oligomeric αs while co-incubation of curcumin with pre-formed αs fibrils shows a significant increase in toxicity . co-incubation of curcumin with monomeric αs does not alter cytotoxicity  similar to incubation with curcumin and tris buffer alone . toxicity studies of curcumin alone towards sh-sy5y cells showed no toxic effects at concentrations below  <dig> μm . since only oligomeric αs aggregates induced toxicity in sh-sy5y cells, subsequent experiments were performed with oligomeric αs to determine the protective effects of curcumin against αs.

cytotoxicity was measured using ldh assay and cell viability was determined using resazurin reduction assay. sh-sy5y cells were incubated with tris buffer , αs, αs+curcumin and curcumin for  <dig> hr before analysis. the ldh release and cell viability were expressed as a percentage of the untreated samples. data was reported as mean ± se, n =  <dig>  acompared with the control; bcompared with αs-treated samples.

extracellular addition of αs generates excessive ros
when oligomeric αs was added extracellularly to sh-sy5y cells, the intracellular ros level significantly increased from  <dig> ±  <dig>   to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , indicating that extracellular αs enhances ros levels in sh-sy5y cells. treatment with curcumin substantially reduces this increase in intracellular ros levels to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . curcumin and tris buffer alone did not affect ros levels . the ability of curcumin to reduce ros levels generated by oligomeric αs is consistent with results obtained using anti-oxidants in mpp+ pd models  <cit>  providing further evidence that ros plays a central role in the selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in pd.

curcumin inhibits caspase- <dig> activity and apoptosis induced by extracellular αs
in addition to increasing ros levels, extracellular incubation of sh-sy5y cells with oligomeric αs also activates caspase- <dig> activity and triggers apoptosis. caspase- <dig> activity in the oligomeric αs-treated sample increased by  <dig> -fold compared to the control, while pre-incubation of curcumin with αs reduced the increase in caspase- <dig> activation by almost half . addition of curcumin and tris buffer alone had no significant effects on caspase- <dig> activity . extracellular addition of oligomeric αs to sh-sy5y cells also induced apoptosis in the cells as marked by the changes in morphologies of the cell nuclei. while the control sh-sy5y cells had regular nuclei with uniformly dispersed chromatin and intact cell membrane , cells incubated with oligomeric αs showed signs of apoptosis as indicated by condensed nuclei and intense fluorescence staining with hoechst dye . pre-incubation of curcumin with αs reduced nuclear damage induced by extracellular oligomeric αs  while curcumin alone did not affect the nuclear morphology of the cells .

curcumin reduces ros and cytotoxicity induced by intracellular overexpression of αs
while curcumin provided substantial protection against extracellular αs-induced toxicity, pd pathology includes intracellular aggregation and accumulation of αs. we evaluated whether extracellularly added curcumin can also protect against intracellularly induced αs toxicity by overexpressing αs in sh-sy5y cells by transient transfection with a wtsynegfp gene. the αs-transfected cells showed intracellular egfp fluorescence, indicating αs expression . the level of αs overexpression was estimated to be around 10% from  <dig> independent experiments, which was typical for this cell line  <cit> . the egfp fluorescence intensity and the αs levels were markedly reduced in the curcumin treated sample, suggesting a suppressive effect of curcumin on αs expression . intracellular ros levels in the αs-transfected cells increased over 2-fold compared to untransfected cells, while treatment with curcumin reduced the increase in ros level to just 40% over the control value . similarly, intracellular αs increased ldh release by 40% compared to the control cells and addition of curcumin reduced the ldh increase to just 20% . the overexpression of αs significantly increased ros and ldh levels and addition of curcumin alleviated these effects, even with the low expression levels studied. curcumin therefore has similar potent protective effects against αs cytotoxicity regardless of whether αs toxicity is induced extra- or intracellularly.

discussion
a key pathological feature of pd is the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions containing ubiquitin and αs known as lbs and lns in the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra region of the brain  <cit> . the many factors that influence αs aggregation and the subsequent downstream cytotoxic events that lead to neuronal cell death are being actively studied. several point mutations in the αs gene which correlate to rare familial early-onset pd and rapid progression of the disease  <cit>  accelerate aggregation of αs and favor formation of nonfibrillar oligomeric forms. recent studies have suggested that soluble oligomeric and protofibrillar structures are the toxic species  <cit> , and that these forms can permeabilize plasma membranes, alter intracellular function, induce oxidative stress and trigger apoptosis in cells  <cit> . epidemiological studies have also suggested that exposure to environmental agents such as neurotoxins and pesticides  <cit>  cause an increase in oxidative damage to the cells by suppressing mitochondrial complex i activity and reducing glutathione levels  <cit> , thereby increasing the risk for pd.

oxidative stress plays a major role in aging and is associated with several neurodegenerative diseases including pd  <cit> , where an increase in ros accompanies αs aggregation and degeneration of dopaminergic neurons  <cit> . intracellular overexpression of αs generates excess ros and causes oxidative stress to the cells  <cit> , leading to disruption in redox homeostasis cell metabolism, free radical generation, lipid peroxidation, cholesterol and protein oxidation  <cit> . excess ros causes plasma membrane damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, defects in the glutathione peroxidase expression and reduction in glutathione levels, all of which render the brain more susceptible to oxidative stress  <cit> . in this study, we find that extracellular addition of oligomeric αs and intracellular overexpression of αs in sh-sy5y cells both increase ros levels by almost 2-fold. the αs-induced increase in ros levels in our current study shows similar oxidative damage to the sh-sy5y cell as previous mpp+ pd cell models, where mpp+ selectively targets and degenerates dopaminergic neurons due to excess generation of ros  <cit> . prolonged exposure to mpp+ and other neurotoxins has been shown to activate caspase- <dig>  <cit> , an important effector caspase in the final apoptotic cascade leading to cell death. if oxidative stress exacerbates the etiology of pd, then agents that can simultaneously attenuate ros damage and suppress caspase- <dig> activation may hold promise for the treatment of pd and other neurodegenerative diseases.

here we show that curcumin, a natural phenolic food additive, effectively inhibits activation of caspase- <dig>  and ameliorates signs of apoptosis  induced by extracellular addition of oligomeric αs to sh-sy5y cells. we also demonstrated that curcumin reduces intracellular overexpression of αs and reduces ros generation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
overexpression and abnormal accumulation of oligomeric αs is key in the pathogenesis of pd  <cit> , and numerous studies suggest that there is both an intra- and extracellular component to αs toxicity in pd  <cit> . we recently demonstrated that an anti-oligomeric αs antibody fragment binds oligomeric αs on the surface of sh-sy5y cells, verifying the presence of intracellularly produced oligomeric αs on external cell membrane surfaces  <cit> . here we show that extracellular addition of oligomeric αs induces similar cytotoxic effects as intracellular overexpression of αs, and that these αs-induced cytotoxic effects are similar to those reported in mptp parkinsonian models. we also show that curcumin can significantly reduce the cytotoxicity induced by extracellular or intracellular αs aggregates, suggesting it may have value for treating pd. since extracellularly added curcumin provides protection even against intracellularly induced αs toxicity, our results suggest that there is a significant extracellular or cell surface component of αs-induced toxicity in pd models, which is consistent with a recently published report of interneuronal transmission of extracellular αs pathology in neuronal cells  <cit> . however, additional studies are needed to further elucidate the mechanism of αs-induced cytotoxicity and its subsequent pathogenesis and progression to induced-apoptosis in pd.
