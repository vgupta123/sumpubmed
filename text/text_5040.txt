BACKGROUND
the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway is central to the formation of the phenolic compounds involved in many plant traits, including resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses  <cit> . one branch of the pathway is responsible for the generation of anthocyanin, which is present in various plant organs in most plant species, including the allohexaploid crop species, bread wheat . two major groups of anthocyanin pigmentation genes are present in wheat: the first includes rc- <dig>  pc- <dig>  pan- <dig>  plb- <dig> and pls- <dig> which encode the pigmentation in, respectively, the coleoptile, culm, anthers, leaf blades and leaf sheaths; while the second consists of pp and ra, which are expressed in, respectively, the pericarp and auricle  <cit> . the former genes are closely linked to one another on each of the short arms of the homoeologous group  <dig> chromosomes. an orthologue of maize gene c <dig>  was mapped earlier on each of the short arms of wheat homoeologous group  <dig> chromosomes, too  <cit>  in positions highly comparable to those of rc- <dig>  genes  <cit> . furthermore, it was shown that c <dig>  when transferred to wheat, was able to induce anthocyanin pigmentation in non-pigmented wheat coleoptiles  <cit> . at the same time rc- <dig> was shown to upregulate a number of wheat flavonoid biosynthesis pathway genes – dfr , ans  and ufgt   <cit> . recognizing elements for c <dig> have also been identified in the promoter sequence of arabidopsis thaliana f3h gene , suggesting that rc- <dig> can probably exert a regulatory role for wheat f3h, too. f3h orthologues have been isolated in barley and maize  <cit>  as well as in a range of other plant species , but have yet to be described in wheat.

the patterns of expression of homoeologous genes in wheat have been intensively studied in recent years  <cit> , but the interaction between structural genes and their homoeologous regulatory genes is unclear. the question remains as to whether, in an allopolyploid, this interaction is genome-specific, or whether regulation cuts across genomes. the rc- <dig> and f3h genes are a suitable model to investigate just this issue, as the expression of rc- <dig> generates a clear phenotype, and the latter are well-characterized at the molecular level. in this paper, we describe the cloning, sequence analysis, mapping and expression of f3h orthologues in bread wheat and its relatives, and the interaction between f3h and the rc- <dig> homoeologues.

RESULTS
sequence analysis of f3h genes in wheat and its relatives
nine f3h copies were isolated by pcr cloning from bread wheat , the tetraploid wild wheat t. timopheevii  and the presumed diploid progenitors of the a, b/g and d genomes  . four of the copies were isolated from bread wheat. the length of the coding sequence, which was split into three exons, was  <dig> bp, and the first intron varied in length among the homoeologues by some hundreds of base pairs . the sequence of the segments of the first intron of the bread wheat copies f3h <dig>  f3h <dig> and f3h <dig> not affected by deletions/insertions shared over 80% homology, but the first intron of f3h <dig> was quite distinct. sequence alignment of t. aestivum f3h sequences  with barley f3h  <cit>  is shown in figure 2a. sequence comparisons between exon  <dig> of the triticum and aegilops f3h genes  are illustrated as dendrogram in figure 2b. the f3h <dig> sequence departs significantly from that of the other triticum and aegilops copies . t. aestivum f3h <dig> and t. timopheevii f3h1t sequences are probably derived from the a genome, whereas f3h <dig> and f3h2t are suggested to belong to the genomes d and g, respectively . f3h <dig> occupies an intermediate position between the two main triticum-aegilops clusters . patterns of sequence divergence across the structural region of wheat f3h <dig> and f3h <dig> suggest that the second exon is the most variable at the nucleotide level, but is most well conserved at the amino acid level . exon  <dig>  intron  <dig> and the beginning of exon  <dig>  were re-sequenced from a panel of seven diverse bread wheat genotypes, but no intraspecific variation was detected.

*correspondence between f3h copies and ests was first determined based on identity at gene copy-specific sights, and then was confirmed by whole sequences comparison .

*ka – non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions, ks – synonymous nucleotide substitutions.

chromosomal assignment and physical mapping of f3h genes in hexaploid wheat
primer pairs amplifying specifically fragments from individual f3h copies  were designed and used in pcr analysis of 'chinese spring' nulli-tetrasomic lines. it was shown that f3h <dig> and  <dig> are on, respectively, chromosomes 2a and 2d, while  <dig> and  <dig> both map to chromosome 2b . a deletion line analysis was then used to define the intra-chromosomal location of f3h <dig> to the sub-terminal bin  of chromosome 2al, both f3h <dig> and f3h <dig> to the terminal bin  of chromosome 2bl, and f3h <dig> to the terminal bin  of chromosome 2dl . since the location of f3h <dig> and f3h <dig> could not be distinguished by this method, an introgression line derived from the cross t. aestivum × t. timopheevii, which contains a 2bl/2gl breakpoint within chromosome bin 2bl <dig> between the microsatellite loci xgwm <dig> and xgwm <dig>  <cit> , was used to show that f3h <dig> and - <dig> are discrete loci . f3h <dig> lies proximal to the to the 2bl/2gl breakpoint, whereas f3h <dig> location is distal. a specific pcr assay for the t. timopheevii f3h2t sequence  proved that it, like t. aestivum f3h <dig>  too lies proximal to the 2bl/2gl breakpoint, thus suggesting that these two loci, along with f3h <dig> and f3h <dig>  belong to an f3h homoeoallelic series, whereas f3h <dig> appears to be a non-homoelogous duplication. accordingly, the genes were re-designated f3h-a <dig> , f3h-b <dig> , f3h-d <dig> , f3h-g <dig>  and f3h-b <dig> .

expression analysis of f3h in lines with and without pigmented coleoptiles
to explore the role of the rc- <dig>  genes as regulators for f3h expression, eight progeny from the cross 'chinese spring'  × 'tri 2732', along with a set of six different chromosome 7d introgression lines of ae. tauschii into 'chinese spring', varying with respect to the dominant allele at either rc-b <dig> or rc-d <dig>  were subjected to rt-pcr analysis from cdna derived from four day old seedlings. the parental genotypes with pigmented coleoptiles  and 'chinese spring  both showed a high level of f3h expression, whereas those with non-pigmented coleoptiles showed either little  or none  . when this result was compared with the microsatellite-based genotype of the lines  <cit> , the regulator of f3h expression on chromosome 7b was mapped between xgwm <dig> and xgwm <dig>  co-segregating with rc-b <dig> ; similarly, the equivalent locus on chromosome 7d co-segregated with rc-d <dig> within the genetic interval xgwm <dig> and xgwm <dig> . rt-pcr was also used to study contribution of single genes f3h-a <dig>  f3h-b <dig>  f3h-b <dig> and f3h-d <dig> to total f3h expression. it was shown that f3h-b <dig> is not expressed whether or not the coleoptiles are pigmented . in contrast, f3h-a <dig>  f3h-b <dig> and f3h-d <dig> were actively expressed in lines with pigmented coleoptiles  and respective recombinant lines; figure  <dig>  lines  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  10), whereas those with non-pigmented coleoptiles  showed a low level of expression of only f3h-a <dig> and f3h-b <dig> .

temporal pattern and the genome specificity of f3h expression
to investigate the possibility of more subtle differences between expression levels of the f3h homoeologues in presence of particular alleles of rc- <dig>  quantitative rt-pcr was applied to a set of cdnas sampled from two to six day old seedlings . the test genotypes were 'chinese spring'  , 'chinese spring'   and cv. 'mironovskaya 808' , along with the control 'chinese spring' which carries the non-pigmented alleles at all three rc- <dig> loci. in the latter, none of the f3h copies was expressed at any time during the sampling period. f3h-b <dig> was not expressed in any of three test line seedlings, but f3h-a <dig>  f3h-b <dig> and f3h-d <dig> were all expressed in these lines. no within genotype significant difference  in the expression level of the three homoeologues could be detected at any of the sampling times . however, the overall level of f3h expression differed very significantly between each pair of lines . the level was lowest in 'mironovskaya 808' and highest in 'chinese spring' . the highest expression level in 'mironovskaya 808' was reached three days after germination, while in 'chinese spring'  and 'chinese spring' , the maximum was detected on the fourth day. in 'chinese spring' , expression started later and declined more rapidly than in 'chinese spring' . the delayed start and lower total level of expression in 'chinese spring'  was consistent with the observed temporal development of pigmentation in the coleoptiles. overall, therefore, each rc- <dig> gene appeared to regulate the expression of the three f3h homoeologues equally, but the level of f3h expression was dependent on the identity of the dominant rc- <dig> allele present.

discussion
cloning and analysis of f3h sequences
f3h genes have been isolated from barley, maize and arabidopsis thaliana  <cit>  as well as from a range of other plant species . in wheat, only one single partial f3h sequence has been published to date  <cit> . the relationship between the wheat and aegilops sp. f3h sequences reported here  and those lodged in genbank  is consistent with standard taxonomic treatment  <cit>  and with known phylogenies within the triticum/aegilops complex  <cit> . the f3h sequences of diploid progenitors of wheat were useful for the genome assignment of the homoeologous gene copies in polyploid wheat. the substantial structural divergence between f3h-b <dig> and that of three f3h- <dig> homoeologues is accompanied by a functional difference. the lack of f3h-b <dig> expression in pigmented coleoptiles does not reflect its complete non-functionality, since a highly identical root est has been reported . the presence of two b genome copies of f3h is not a particularly unusual result, as f3h copy number in diploids varies from one  <cit>  to two  <cit> . silent divergence  appears to be homogeneously distributed throughout the coding region of arabidopsis thaliana f3h, being rarest in the second, and most frequent in the third exon  <cit> . a similar pattern applies to the wheat a and d genome f3h homoeologues .

a pcr-based cloning approach has been used to clone other flavonoid biosynthesis pathway genes in hexaploid wheat , whereas in barley and other diploid species they have been isolated from cdna libraries  <cit> . it has recently become clear that not all members of a homoeologous series in wheat are co-expressed  <cit> , so the genomic pcr-based cloning approach is probably the more preferable strategy to capture a full set of homoeologues. although pcr-based cloning has some disadvantages when applied in an allopolyploid , it is an effective strategy for the design of gene copy-specific primers, the chromosomal localization of genes and expression analysis.

expression of the three homoeologous f3h loci in lines with and without pigmented coleoptiles
the patterns of expression of flavanone 3-hydroxylase in lines with and without pigmented coleoptiles indicated that rc-b <dig> and rc-d <dig> are coincident with the genes regulating its expression . this is in accordance with the suggestion that rc- <dig> genes exert a regulatory role for f3h genes, which could be made on the base of combined results obtained earlier  <cit> . the patterns of temporal expression among the f3h homoeologues in the presence of different dominant rc- <dig> alleles allowed for an examination as to whether, in an allopolyploid context, there are any genome-specific relationships between the structural and regulatory genes. no such relationship was apparent, since in pigmented coleoptiles, f3h-a <dig>  f3h-b <dig> and f3h-d <dig> were all expressed at a similar level . many sets of wheat homoeologous genes are known to be equally expressed in this way  <cit> , but in others, the expression of one or more members may be either completely  <cit>  or partially  <cit>  suppressed. generally, when f3h homoeologues are expressed actively , then they are expressed equally, but where overall f3h transcription level is low, then selective expression of f3h homoeologues could be observed . these outcomes are consistent with the activity-selectivity principle  <cit>  acting at the transcriptional level.

functional difference between homoeologous rc- <dig> genes
whereas each dominant rc- <dig> allele affects the expression of each of the three f3h homoeologues equally, overall f3h expression was dependent on the identity of which dominant rc- <dig> allele was present . this difference was observed not only at specific time points, but also from the total amounts of f3h mrna produced over the period of coleoptile pigmentation. the delayed start of expression and the lesser level of transcript present in 'chinese spring'  compared to 'chinese spring'  was consistent with the observed accumulation of pigmentation in the coleoptile, both in the present experiments and in those reported earlier  <cit> . in order to test for background effects on f3h expression or variability within transcriptional factors encoded by dominant rc- <dig> alleles in other genotypes, it would be of interest to investigate the extent to which the profiles of f3h expression of 'chinese spring' , 'chinese spring'  and 'mironovskaya 808' are typical, i.e. for instance to compare profile of 'mironovskaya 808' to those of some other varieties carrying the same dominant allele .

CONCLUSIONS
there are at least four flavanone 3-hydroxylase gene copies in the hexaploid genome of bread wheat, three of which are the homoeologues on chromosomes 2al, 2bl and 2dl, highly similar at structural and functional level, while the fourth one represents a distinct non-homoeologous copy on chromosome 2bl with suppressed expression in red coleoptiles.

expression of the f3h homoeologues  in wheat coleoptiles is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in rc- <dig>  loci. rc- <dig> and f3h- <dig> genes represent a suitable model to investigate relationship between homoeologous regulatory and homoeologous structural genes in allopolyploid wheat genome . the lack of any genome-specific relationship between f3h- <dig> and rc- <dig> observed in the present study implies an integrative evolutionary process among the three diploid genomes, following the formation of hexaploid wheat.

furthermore, based on f3h expression analysis it was observed for the first time that activity-selectivity principle  <cit>  acts at the transcriptional level.

our general conclusion is that regulatory genes probably contribute more to the functional divergence between the wheat genomes than do the structural genes themselves. this is in line with the growing consensus which suggests that although heritable morphological traits are determined by the expression of structural genes, it is the regulatory genes which are the prime determinants of allelic identity.
