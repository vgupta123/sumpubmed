BACKGROUND
despite the growing number of sequenced genomes, our knowledge of genetic variants that underlie phenotypic differences is far from complete. for several decades, linkage mapping has been one of the most powerful and popular approaches to study the genetic architecture of phenotypic traits. however, successful mapping of both mendelian and complex traits depends critically on the availability of fast, cost-effective and high-throughput genotyping platform. during recent years, significant breakthroughs in developing high-throughput array-based single nucleotide polymorphism  genotyping assays for model organisms have been achieved which allow screening of thousands of loci in a highly parallel fashion  <cit> . however, the vast majority of array-based snp genotyping approaches are not available for non-model species and become prohibitively expensive for screening large numbers of individuals which is commonly required for dissecting of the molecular genetic basis of phenotypic traits. this represents one of the major drawback for quantitative trait locus  mapping as the power of detecting qtl and the accuracy of estimating qtl effects depends critically on analyses of large number of individuals  <cit> . for example, simulation studies have shown that with sample sizes considerably lower than  <dig>  the power to map qtl of small effect  is very low and the estimated magnitude of a qtl will be seriously exaggerated  <cit> . on the other hand, increasing marker density beyond  <dig> cm which usually corresponds to  <dig> to  <dig> markers depending on the organism does not provide any considerable increase in power  <cit> . taken together, inexpensive, simple and flexible genotyping solutions that enable rapid screening of hundreds to thousands of individuals for intermediate numbers of loci  would be extremely useful for qtl mapping applications in a broad range of organisms. such a need is still inadequately met with currently available open-source and commercial genotyping platforms as they require expensive, highly specific laboratory equipment  and/or suffer high initial costs because of the use of long  or modified primers   <cit> .

in contrast to snps, other types of genetic variation such as insertion-deletion  polymorphisms have received more attention only recently  <cit> . this is surprising as indels are relatively abundant, spread throughout the genome, and contribute substantially to both intra- and interspecific divergence  <cit> . insertion and deletions of single base pairs and monomeric base pair extensions of various lengths are the most common class of indels while other types of indels including transposon insertions and apparently random dna sequences appear in lower frequencies  <cit> . the latter category, consisting of short  apparently random dna insertions-deletions are amenable for fast and cost-effective genotyping as such length variation is similar in form to microsatellite length polymorphisms, but showing no stutter. however, such indels have thus far not been fully utilized to develop high-throughput genotyping assays.

atlantic salmon  is an ideal species for demonstrating the suitability of indel genotyping for qtl mapping of ecologically important traits due to the availability of large number of expressed sequence tags , high fecundity enabling generation of large qtl mapping families and the availability of extensive ecological knowledge. it exhibits a complex anadromous life cycle: juveniles typically spend one or more years in fresh water before migrating to the sea and subsequently return to fresh water as adults to spawn. in the natural environment, however, the vast majority of fertilized salmonid eggs die during early life-stages as eggs, fry, alevins or parr. recapture rates suggest that in atlantic salmon up to  <dig> % mortality may occur during the first four months after emergence from the gravel, and highest morality occurs during very short period after emergence  <cit> . hence, natural selection is expected to have a strong effect on phenotypic traits expressed during early life-stages. such traits are considered to have a prominent role in adaptation as it affects juvenile competitive ability, dispersal, foraging, and vulnerability to predation and climatic conditions . nevertheless, the underlying genetic basis of ecologically relevant early life-history traits, such as emergence from gravel and size of fry in atlantic salmon, is currently unknown.

here, we describe the discovery of and application of insertion-deletion  polymorphisms for qtl mapping of ecologically important traits in atlantic salmon. as a proof of principle, we generated partial indel linkage map and demonstrate rapid identification of a number of qtls affecting early life-history traits in salmon that are expected to have important fitness consequences in natural environment.

RESULTS
indel discovery from expressed sequence tags 
clustering of  <dig>  atlantic salmon ests resulted in  <dig>  singletons and  <dig>  contigs with an average size  <dig>  bp. more than half of the contigs  contained less than four sequences while 43% of contigs contained  <dig> to  <dig> sequences. only 4% of contigs contained more than  <dig> sequences. altogether, autosnp identified  <dig>  indels which corresponds to the average indel density of one indel per  <dig>  bp . further inspection of the dataset revealed that a significant proportion of identified indels contain short repeat motifs, as well as  <dig> bp mononucleotide insertion-deletions .

development and the performance of  <dig> locus single-run indel panel
initial screening of  <dig> indel markers in  <dig> atlantic salmon individuals from a broad geographical distribution revealed  <dig> polymorphic loci. among these, six indels were predicted to change the length of the protein  based on genscan prediction  <cit> . we subsequently combined up to  <dig> loci in a single multiplex amplification reaction and developed, without extensive optimization , an efficient  <dig> locus single-run indel genotyping panel in atlantic salmon . this simple approach consists of just three basic laboratory steps: i) eight multiplex pcr reactions with m <dig> tailed primers  <cit> ; ii) pooling of pcr products; iii) capillary electrophoresis. this enables generation of  <dig>  genotypes  within a single electrophoresis run which is comparable to the state-of the art array-based snp genotyping platforms such as fluorescent tag-array mini-sequencing  assays in drosophila melanogaster that are able to produce  <dig>  genotypes  on a single array  <cit> . the estimated proportion of loci that lead to high-quality assay of indel assay was 63%, since  <dig> loci giving high quality genotypes out of  <dig> polymorphic loci were successfully incorporated to indel genotyping panel. based on repeated genotyping of  <dig> individuals from the r. selja salmon population, the average calling rate  over  <dig> polymorphic loci was  <dig>  . we detected  <dig> genotype mismatches out of  <dig> genotype calls which corresponds to the error rate  <dig>  . inconsistent genotype calls were detected in six loci out of  <dig> variable indels and in most cases the errors were caused by miscalling apparently heterozygous individual as homozygous.

construction of partial indel linkage map in atlantic salmon
from  <dig> genotyped indel markers,  <dig> loci were polymorphic in at least one of two families and were used to construct indel linkage map together with  <dig> variable microsatellite loci . the total number of segregating markers in family  <dig> and  <dig> was  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. altogether, male and female maps consisted of  <dig> known and  <dig> unknown linkage groups , and  <dig> unlinked markers . indels were mapped to  <dig> linkage groups  while two remained unlinked. this corresponds to most but not all chromosomes in atlantic salmon as the common karyotype in europe contains  <dig> linkage groups . as expected, a considerable proportion of the genome showed very low recombination in males while some regions exhibited similar or even higher levels of recombination in males  <cit> . this resulted in a shorter linkage map in males compared to females . compared to the asalbase female microsatellite map consisting of ca  <dig> markers http://www.asalbase.org the length of the corresponding linkage groups of the initial indel map was smaller in most cases, indicating that the coverage of the present indel map is still rather low. however, in some cases the length of linkage groups  exceeded asalbase map  .

mapping ecologically relevant early life-history qtls in atlantic salmon
the  <dig> locus indel panel was utilized together with microsatellite markers to identify for a first time qtls for two ecologically relevant early life-history traits in two full-sib families . a total of  <dig> qtl were detected at 5% chromosome-wide significance level ,  <dig>  qtl for time of emergence  and  <dig>  qtls for fork length  . we expect to observe approximately twelve false positives at the 5% and two false positive qtls at the 1% chromosome-wide significance level given that the total number of lgs/unlinked markers tested was  <dig> per trait. individual qtl explained 5-12% and 5-16% of phenotypic variance for toe  and fl , respectively. however, due to selective genotyping of the ends of the distribution, the calculated qtl effects are most likely inflated. the total number of qtls identified from family  <dig> was  <dig>  while eleven qtls were detected in family  <dig> . estimated 95% confidence intervals for qtl positions covered the whole linkage groups, most likely due to low recombination rate in males and relatively moderate number of markers per chromosome. altogether five qtls for a particular trait were identified in more than one segregating parent or family . in seven cases qtls for toe were also associated with fl . however, when qtl analysis for toe was executed considering length as covariate, only four toe qtls out of seven remained significant at the 5% chromosome-wide level .

bold f-values indicate values larger than 5% genome-wide significance level threshold. underlined linkage groups  correspond to the qtl identified more than once in four mapping parents for particular trait. * significant at 5% chromosome-wide level, ** significant at 1% chromosome-wide level.

discussion
advances and limitations of indel genotyping for qtl mapping
we have demonstrated that insertions-deletions can be effectively utilized for qtl mapping applications in non-model organisms and indels can serve as useful alternatives for snp and microsatellite markers, especially for characterization of genetic architecture in multiple crosses and large pedigrees. in the following, we discuss the advances and limitations of indel genotyping compared to the alternative existing genotyping methodologies. in terms of number of loci screened, currently available commercial ultra-high snp genotyping platforms enable typing of orders of magnitude larger number of loci but generally provide rather low sample throughput, while traditional approaches enable genotyping of high numbers of individuals at limited number of loci. the indel genotyping strategy descried here falls between these two extremes and has several advantages, as well as limitations, compared to currently available microsatellite and snp genotyping approaches. first, indels are more easily transferable between populations compared to microsatellites and applicable for a wide range of species for which expressed sequence tag collections for in silico indel identification are available. for example, at the time of writing over  <dig> species have more than  <dig>  <dig> ests in ncbi est database. in addition, new massively parallel sequencing technologies provide an extremely fast means to identify large numbers of indels  <cit> . nevertheless, the frequency of indels is expected to be lower compared to snps and thus, the development of indel assay would require larger number of sequences than development of alternative genotyping approaches that are based on snps  <cit> . second, genotyping of indels is relatively simple and compatible with 384-well format sample processing. this enables rapid screening of large number of samples as it is possible for one person to set up eight amplification reactions and run  <dig> individuals within a day. such throughput means that for many species and traits analyzed in a linkage mapping framework sample throughput need not be the primarily limiting factor. however, genotype calling still requires a significant amount of time and effort, although considerably less than for standard microsatellite loci. also, increasing the number of loci would be extremely useful as only a subset of biallelic markers are segregating in particular cross or family. for example, in the present study, only  <dig> markers out of  <dig>  were segregating in the two atlantic salmon families used for qtl mapping. third, genotyping indels is cost-effective compared to many snp genotyping approaches that require highly specific laboratory equipment and/or expensive primers  <cit> , as the utilization of the tailed primer system  <cit>  enables use of a single fluorescence labelled oligonucleotide for tagging large numbers of individual loci. this allows considerable reductions in primer cost compared to commonly used 5'-end fluorescence labelling of individual oligos. it is also rather flexible, as it is possible to freely change the fluorescence label of particular indel which enables easy selection of large number of non-overlapping markers. however, using a universal fluorescent oligonucleotide in addition to locus specific tailed primers complicates the pcr optimization procedure as increasing the concentration of the locus-specific primers does not necessarily result in higher amplification intensity of the fluorescently labeled pcr product. as a result, incorporation of new markers into existing genotyping panels and developing new multiplexes requires re-optimization to find optimal primer concentrations. however, it is also likely that further increases of multiplexing level can be achieved either via simultaneous use of different tailed primers  <cit> , two phase amplification  <cit>  or selective circulation methods  <cit> . the commercial multiplex pcr chemistry  used in indel genotyping is also more expensive than standard pcr reagents but the extra reagent cost is compensated for by multiplexing up to  <dig> loci and using small volume reactions. the cost of running a single  <dig> locus indel assay, from which a maximum of  <dig>  genotypes  can be obtained, is currently ~ <dig> usd in our laboratory  cents per genotype, including  <dig> pcrs and capillary electrophoresis). when the cost of  <dig> unlabeled and four fluorescently labeled m <dig> primers are included to the calculations, the estimated cost of genotyping  <dig> loci in  <dig> individuals is ~ <dig>  cents per genotype. fourth, in contrast to the most array-based genotyping assays, indel genotyping using standard electrophoresis procedure does not require specific laboratory equipment or generation of specific libraries and arrays  making it attractive for laboratories with standard fragment analysis laboratory equipment.

compared to microsatellite and snp assays, genotyping of indels- is most similar to multiplex snp-scale  <cit>  which also utilizes tailed primer system  <cit>  to reduce primer cost, qiagen pcr chemistry for multiplexing and capillary electrophoresis for separation of alleles of different size. however, the largest difference between indel genotyping and snp-scale  <cit>  is that the latter uses three locus-specific primers to discriminate between alternative snp alleles . hence, the initial cost of primers for snp-scale  <cit>  is 50% higher compared to indels as initial amplification of indels requires only two locus-specific unmodified primers. in addition, finding suitable allele-specific primers for snp allele discrimination is more challenging than designing standard primers flanking particular indel. on the other hand, we expect that the calling rate  and genotyping error rate for both methods is relatively similar as both approaches are using pcr multiplexing followed by electrophoresis for locus and allele discrimination. it is more difficult to compare the conversion rates of different methods  but reported marker conversion rates for snp genotyping approaches often range from 50% to 86%  <cit> . hence, the estimated conversion rate for the indel assay  is comparable with snp genotyping methods.

qtlmapping of early life-history traits in atlantic salmon
to our knowledge, this is the first report of quantitative trait loci affecting time of emergence  and length during the critical period of shifting from endogenous to exogenous energy supplies in atlantic salmon  <cit> . earlier studies have identified several qtls that influence size in salmonids at older life stages  <cit> . compared to the present study, the same linkage groups were identified to harbor qtls in several cases but it is not clear whether these shared size-related qtls correspond to the same or separate loci. as the physiological energy conversion mechanisms using endogenous versus exogenous energy supplies are different in fish one might expect a rather different set of genes affecting growth before and after the start of active feeding  <cit> . as expected, we detected more qtls when using the male as a mapping parent as a result of reduced recombination compared to females, consistent with the other qtl studies in salmonids . also, in many instances, several markers showed lack of recombination in males, while in females, the same markers mapped 30- <dig> cm away from each other. on the other hand, we also observed that in some cases markers appeared to be unlinked in males but were closely linked in female map. these results are accordance with earlier studies in atlantic salmon that demonstrate the lack of recombination in some genomic regions in males while in other regions, male recombination rates are very high relative to female recombination rates  <cit> . taken together, low recombination rate over large genomic regions in males enable initial qtl mapping with relatively few loci in atlantic salmon but this also complicates the estimation of the position and effect of qtl. consequently, finer-scale localization of qtl in salmon is more feasible from female side using larger number of markers.

previously, analyses of selection differentials in the natural environment have demonstrated strong directional selection on time of emergence and length at the beginning of exogenous feeding in atlantic salmon. for example, einum and fleming  <cit>  showed that the delay of emergence of one standard deviation  resulted in a 39% increase in mortality, while  <dig> sd decrease in length at emergence resulted in a 25% increase in mortality during a  <dig> day period in the natural environment. when using these standardized linear selection gradient estimates  in the context of calculated sire or dam effects, the largest qtl for toe could increase or decrease the mortality 10-17% while largest qtl for length can affect the mortality rate from  <dig> to 11%. however, as noted earlier, the calculated qtl effects of may be inflated, but nevertheless, it suggests that given the evidence of strong natural selection combined with large family sizes in salmonids  <cit>  it should be feasible to carry out genome-wide screens for identification of the genomic regions affecting survival in natural environment using linkage mapping framework  <cit> . compared to analysis of candidate loci such as major histocompatibility  linked genes  <cit>  this would represent a significant step forward and new genetic tools, such as described here, open up new possibilities for further dissection of the genetic basis of phenotypic variation, adaptation and fitness in natural environment  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, indel genotyping enables fast coarse mapping in large numbers of individuals and families/crosses, thus providing an efficient means for more comprehensive characterization of genetic architecture in multiple crosses and large pedigrees. as such, it may help to answer some essential questions in the evolutionary genetic research, like: to what extent the same qtl are segregating in multiple populations? how many qtls are affecting fitness related traits in natural populations? we expect that the insertion-deletion polymorphisms can be a valuable marker resource for addressing these and related questions in an increasing number of species.
