BACKGROUND
kaposi's sarcoma  is a multifocal angioproliferative disease that often occurs in human immunodeficiency virus -infected patients  <cit> . now the accepted etiological agent of ks is ks-associated herpesvirus /human herpesvirus  <dig>   <cit> . kshv is also associated with another lymphoproliferative disorders: primary effusion lymphoma  and multicentric castleman's disease   <cit> . all herpesviruses, including kshv, display two patterns of infection: latent and lytic phases  <cit> . during latency, only a restricted set of viral genes is expressed. upon induction of lytic infection, viral replication and transcription programs become fully activated, and new virions are packaged and released from the cells. regulation of viral infection cycle is critical to the initiation and progression of ks. however, kshv infection appears to be necessary but not sufficient for the development of ks without the involvement of other cofactors to reactivate kshv lytic replication.

previously, we demonstrated that both interleukin- <dig> /signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig>  and il-6/janus kinase  <dig> /stat <dig> signal pathways modulated hiv- <dig> transactivative transcription protein -induced kshv replication  <cit> . recently, we have also shown that herpes simplex virus type  <dig>  was another important cofactor that reactivated the lytic cycle replication of kshv, and the production of il- <dig> and il- <dig> from hsv-1-infected bcbl- <dig> cells partially contributed to kshv replication  <cit> . these facts led us to hypothesize that hsv- <dig> might reactivate kshv lytic cycle replication by modulating multiple signal pathways of bcbl- <dig> cells on the basis of changing cellular cytokines protein expression profile  <cit> .

to verify this hypothesis, in this study, we focused on the major pathways activated by il-10/il- <dig> receptor  and il-4/il-4r to evaluate their functions in hsv-1-induced kshv lytic cycle replication. by transfecting a series of dominant negative mutants and protein expressing constructs and using pharmacologic inhibitors, we found that either il-10/jak1/stat <dig> or il-4/jak1/stat <dig> signaling was not involved in hsv-1-induced kshv replication. however, activation of both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase /protein kinase b  and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase  mitogen-activated protein kinase  signal pathways contributed to hsv-1-induced kshv replication. these novel findings are believed to be the first report on the mechanisms of kshv activation by hsv- <dig> and shed light on the pathogenesis of kshv-induced malignancies.

RESULTS
 <dig> . inhibition of jak1/stat <dig> and jak1/stat <dig> signal pathways does not affect hsv-1-induced kshv lytic cycle replication
we have previously demonstrated that the production of il- <dig> and il- <dig> from hsv-1-infected bcbl- <dig> cells partially contributed to hsv-1-induced kshv replication  <cit> . commonly, il- <dig> exerts its function via jak <dig>  tyk2/stat <dig> signal pathway, and il- <dig> through jak <dig>  jak3/stat <dig> pathway  <cit> . to determine whether these signal pathways were altered in hsv-1-infected bcbl- <dig> cells, western blot analysis was performed. as shown in figure 1a, hsv- <dig> infection of bcbl- <dig> cells did not display any effect on phosphorylation of stat <dig> or stat <dig> at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h when compared to mock-infected groups. similar results were also observed when bcbl- <dig> cells were infected with hsv- <dig> or mock at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> min . to confirm these results, bcbl- <dig> cells were transfected with stat3-dn or stat6-dn construct followed by hsv- <dig> infection. rt-qpcr demonstrated that transfection of either stat3-dn or stat6-dn did not affect kshv orf <dig> mrna transcripts induced by hsv- <dig> in bcbl- <dig> cells . to further extend above results, piceatannol, a jak <dig> tyrosine kinase-specific inhibitor, was added to bcbl- <dig> cells culture before hsv- <dig> infection. the results from rt-qpcr indicated that inhibition of jak <dig> did not influence kshv replication by hsv- <dig> . these data collectively suggest that either il-10/jak1/stat <dig> or il-4/jak1/stat <dig> signal pathway is not involved in hsv-1-induced kshv replication.

 <dig> . suppression of pi3k/akt signal pathway inhibits hsv-1-induced kshv replication
besides signal pathways from jak1/stat <dig> by il- <dig> and jak1/stat <dig> by il- <dig>  both il- <dig> and il- <dig> can also induce activation of pi3k/akt pathway  <cit> . to examine whether pi3k/akt signaling was activated in hsv-1-infected bcbl- <dig> cells, western blot analysis was carried out. it was demonstrated that phosphorylated pi3k and akt were markedly increased at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h in hsv-1-infected bcbl- <dig> cells when compared with mock-infected bcbl- <dig> cells .

to examine whether pi3k/akt pathway was involved in kshv lytic cycle replication by hsv- <dig>  pi3k-specific inhibitor ly <dig> was first used. rt-qpcr demonstrated that orf <dig> mrna in hsv-1-infected bcbl- <dig> cells pretreated with ly <dig> was decreased  <dig> -fold at  <dig> h,  <dig> -fold at  <dig> h, and  <dig> -fold at  <dig> h post infection of hsv- <dig>  respectively, compared to hsv-1-infected bcbl- <dig> cells pretreated with dmso . to confirm this result, western blot analysis was performed. we found that pretreatment of ly <dig> inactivated the downstream kinase akt and reduced the expression of kshv vil- <dig> proteins . next, pi3k-dn, the dominant negative form of pi3k, was transfected to bcbl- <dig> cells followed by hsv- <dig> infection. as shown in figure 3c, control plasmid psg <dig> alone did not affect kshv activation by hsv- <dig>  but transfection of pi3k-dn decreased hsv-1-induced kshv rta and vil- <dig> expression. finally, akt-dn, the dominant negative form of akt, was transfected to bcbl- <dig> cells followed by hsv- <dig> infection. western blot analysis demonstrated that transfection of control plasmid psrα alone did not influence kshv replication, but transfection of akt-dn down-regulated the proteins expression of kshv rta and vil- <dig> . the results from ifa also indicated that transfection of akt-dn significantly decreased hsv-1-induced kshv orf <dig> proteins expression . these data suggest that activation of pi3k/akt pathway involves in hsv-1-induced kshv replication.

 <dig> . both overexpression of pten and activation of gsk-3β pathway also inhibit hsv-1-induced kshv reactivation
from figure  <dig>  we observed that expression of pten  was low in hsv-1-infected bcbl- <dig> cells, therefore, we asked whether overexpression of pten could influence hsv-1-induced kshv replication. to address this issue, the pten cdna construct was transfected to the cells. western blot analysis demonstrated that overexpression of pten not only decreased phosphorylated akt and gsk-3β , but also reduced hsv-1-induced kshv rta and vil- <dig> proteins expression . to further determine whether overexpression of pten could reduce the release of kshv progeny virions induced by hsv- <dig>  experiments were designed to detect the copy number of kshv progeny virions. the results of real-time dna-pcr demonstrated that the copy number of kshv virions in the supernatant from pten-transfected and hsv- <dig> infected bcbl- <dig> cells was significantly decreased when compared to those from pcdna-transfected and hsv- <dig> infected bcbl- <dig> cells .

because hsv- <dig> infection of bcbl- <dig> cells increased phosphorylated gsk-3β  and transfection of pi3k-dn decreased hsv-1-induced phosphorylation of gsk-3β , we reasoned that inactivated gsk-3β might promote hsv-1-induced kshv replication. to test this hypothesis, the gsk-3β mutant plasmid gsk-3β-s9a, which exhibits constitutively active gsk-3β, was transfected to bcbl- <dig> cells. as expected, the expression of kshv rta and vil- <dig> proteins in gsk-3β-s9a-transfected and hsv- <dig> infected bcbl- <dig> cells was markedly reduced compared to pcdna-transfected and hsv- <dig> infected bcbl- <dig> cells .

taken together, these data suggest that pten/pi3k/akt/gsk-3β pathway may play an important role in hsv-1-induced kshv reactivation.

 <dig> . erk mapk pathway partially contributes to hsv-1-induced kshv replication
because il- <dig> can also induce activation of erk mapk pathway  <cit> , we reasoned that erk mapk signaling might be activated in hsv-1-infected bcbl- <dig> cells. to this end, western blot analysis was performed to detect activation of erk mapk pathway. we found that hsv- <dig> infection of bcbl- <dig> cells increased phosphorylated c-raf, mek1/ <dig> and erk1/ <dig> at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h when compared to mock-infected group .

to evaluate the role of erk mapk pathway in kshv replication, mek-dn, the dominant negative form of mek1/ <dig>  was first used. western blot analysis demonstrated that control plasmid pcdna alone did not affect kshv reactivation by hsv- <dig>  but transfection of mek-dn lowered hsv-1-induced kshv rta and vil- <dig> expression through the inhibition of phosphorylation of downstream kinase erk1/ <dig> . next, real-time dna-pcr was utilized to quantitatively detect the copy number of kshv progeny virions. it was indicated that the copy number of kshv virions in the supernatant from mek-dn-transfected and hsv- <dig> infected bcbl- <dig> cells was significantly decreased compared to the corresponding control . further, peptide ii, an erk-specific inhibitor, was added to bcbl- <dig> cells culture before hsv- <dig> infection. the results from rt-qpcr indicated that orf <dig> mrna in hsv-1-infected bcbl- <dig> cells pretreated with peptide ii was decreased  <dig> -fold at  <dig> h,  <dig> -fold at  <dig> h, and  <dig> -fold at  <dig> h, respectively, when compared to hsv-1-infected bcbl- <dig> cells pretreated with h2o . similarly, the results from ifa demonstrated that treatment of peptide ii of hsv-1-infected bcbl- <dig> cells significantly decreased kshv orf <dig> proteins expression .

these observations collectively suggest that erk mapk pathway also contributes to hsv-1-induced kshv replication.

 <dig>  discussion
deregulation of cellular signal pathways is involved in the infection process and replication of many viruses and is also likely to contribute to pathogenesis and viral oncogenesis. many signal pathways, such as jak/stat, pi3k/akt, mapk, protein kinase c , nuclear factor kappa b  and notch have been shown to participate in kshv infection, replication and angiogenesis  <cit> . in this study, we did not observe any evidence that jak1/stat <dig> and jak1/stat <dig>  which were the traditional pathways activated by il-10/il-10r and il-4/il-4r, were involved in kshv replication by hsv- <dig>  but pi3k/akt and erk mapk pathways induced by il- <dig> and il- <dig> contributed to this replication.

pi3k/akt signaling pathway plays an important role in cell growth and survival. pi3k is a heterodimer composed of a catalytic subunit p <dig> and an adaptor/regulatory subunit p <dig>  <cit> . pi3k activation leads to akt activation. akt is a critical regulator of pi3k-mediated cell survival and akt phosphorylates and inactivates several proapoptotic proteins including gsk-3β  <cit> . pten is a negative regulator of pi3k/akt pathway  <cit> . pten counters the effects of pi3k and inhibits akt. pten is inactivated by phosphorylation, leading to the activation of akt. with respect to kshv and activation of pi3k/akt, many studies focused on viral g protein-coupled receptor  and k <dig> genes. pi3k/akt pathway played an essential role in vgpcr sarcomagenesis  <cit> . the activation of pi3k/akt pathway by k <dig> promoted cell survival and immortalization and might contribute to kshv-associated tumorigenesis  <cit> . in this study, we have provided direct experimental evidence that not only suppression of pi3k/akt signal pathway, but also overexpression of pten and activation of gsk-3β inhibited hsv-1-induced kshv replication, implying complicated functions of pi3k/akt pathway not only in viral oncogenesis. interestingly, a report showed that inhibition of pi3k pathway did not impair induction of kshv lytic replication by metabolic end products of gram-negative anaerobic bacteria  <cit> . another study demonstrated that inhibition of pi3k/akt pathway enhanced kshv and murine gammaherpesvirus- <dig>  lytic replication  <cit> . we speculated that there were at least three reasons:  different inducers and cell lines may exhibit different mechanisms and effects,  pi3k and akt both have a wide range of cellular targets and show complicated functions dependent on the context, and  we also simultaneously used dominant negative protein expression plasmids of this pathway, while peng et al. just only used chemical inhibitors. since chemical inhibitors are known to have pleiotropic effects, the use of dominant negative protein expression plasmids is of value. in addition, authors of these two studies detected only the effects of inhibition of pi3k or akt on the reactivation of kshv in pel cell lines, but the upstream and downstream effectors were not shown.

mapk cascades are key signaling pathways involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, survival and differentiation. it is not surprising that many viruses including kshv target mapk pathways as a means to manipulate cellular function and to control viral infection and replication. studies from gao's group demonstrated that erk, c-jun n-terminal kinase  and p <dig> multiple mapk pathways had general roles in regulating the life cycle of kshv by mediating both viral infection and switch from viral latency to lytic replication  <cit> . among three major mapk pathways, erk mapk pathway has particularly been the subject of intense research in cancer treatment  <cit> . because of the fact that kshv can cause malignancies, kshv researchers pay more attention to erk mapk pathway. there were some reports which focused on activation of erk mapk and kshv replication. for instance, ford et al. demonstrated that inhibiting b-raf/mek/erk signaling by using mek-specific inhibitors or sirna construct targeting b-raf restrained 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate -induced kshv lytic replication  <cit> . cohen et al. also showed an essential role of erk signaling in tpa-induced reactivation of kshv by using mek-specific inhibitors  <cit> . yu et al. revealed that raf/mek/erk pathway mediated ras-induced kshv reactivation and the same pathway also mediated tpa-induced kshv reactivation and spontaneous reactivation in pel cells, by screening expression of a mammalian cdna library  <cit> . a more recent study also showed that alloferon inhibited lytic reactivation of kshv through down-regulation of erk  <cit> . here, we demonstrated a consistent result that activation of erk signaling partially contributed to hsv-1-induced kshv replication.

 <dig>  
CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have showed that not jak1/stat <dig> or jak1/stat <dig> but pten/pi3k/akt/gsk-3β and erk mapk signal pathways partially contributed to hsv-1-induced kshv replication. these findings provided further insights into the molecular mechanism controlling kshv lytic replication and shed light on the pathogenesis of kshv-induced malignancies.
