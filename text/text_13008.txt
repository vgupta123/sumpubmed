BACKGROUND
the etiology of schizophrenia has been gaining more focus in recent brain research. one of the most intriguing areas of schizophrenia research is the identification of candidate genes from different postmortem cortical regions associated with positive and negative symptoms for the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. the neurodevelopmental studies of schizophrenia have used postmortem superior temporal gyrus  tissue samples which are responsible for cognition and memory. next generation sequencing  accelerates biological research in disease pathology such as genomics, transcriptomics, gene expression analysis <cit> . schizophrenia is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder. the vulnerability basis of schizophrenia demonstrates the genetic deficit of the complex heritability. the use of rna-seq technology provides a more complete dataset for transcriptome analysis than microarray technology. six public human brain rna-seq datasets, as listed in table  <dig>  are currently available from the sequence read archive .

accumulating evidence suggests that mitochondria dysfunction is one of the pathological mechanisms for schizophrenia. genetic variations in mitochondrial dna polymorphism and antipsychotic-induced weight gain are associated with schizophrenic subjects <cit> . the atp level was decreased in the left temporal in schizophrenic patients <cit>  and mitochondrial dna common deletion in brain samples and polymorphisms are associated with schizophrenic patients <cit> , suggesting that the alteration of mitochondria and dysregulation of energy metabolism may contribute to implication of schizophrenia <cit> .

venous thromboembolic events have been associated with psychosis in unmedicated schizophrenic patients <cit> . evidence indicates that abnormal tissue plasminogen activator  activity is an important predisposing factor for schizophrenia <cit> . moreover, chronic anticoagulation therapy is associated with remission of psychotic symptoms, which suggest that imbalance of tpa levels in the brain may affect the stabilization of psychotic symptoms <cit> . proteomic study provided evidence that serum abnormalities in schizophrenic patients involved in phosphorylation of proteins in coagulation pathways <cit> . it has been suggested that drug-induced sedation, obesity and enhanced platelet aggregation result in increased activity in the coagulation system <cit> .

the studies by huang et al. <cit> , wu et al. <cit>  and sellmann et al. <cit>  used human postmortem brain tissue samples for schizophrenia research. the previous post-mortem brain studies in schizophrenia by huang et al. contains  <dig> control and  <dig> schizophrenia microarray samples of ba <dig> brain tissue <cit> . sellmann et al. used  <dig> schizophrenia patients and  <dig> controls in their microarray study. kj brennand et al. collects  <dig> samples from schizophrenia patients and  <dig> controls to derive the human induced pluripotent stem cells. there are few rna-seq datasets available in post-mortem brain samples mostly because of its high cost. rna-seq is a high-throughput sequencing technique as an alternative to microarray for genotyping, which its sequencing data are highly replicable with little technical variation, and it enables more accurate identification of differentially expressed genes, alternative splice variants and novel transcripts <cit> . the sra database contained  <dig> public ngs biosamples associated with schizophrenia. therefore, the  <dig> schizophrenic samples and  <dig> controls collected by wu et al. used in this study are of reasonable sample size for transcriptome analysis. the human brain area stg/ba <dig> is believed to be associated with speech and language, known as wernicke's area, and responsible for many positive symptoms and cognitive dysfunction involving auditory processing and social cognition in schizophrenia. wu et al. revealed three functional clusters highly relevant to schizophrenia in stg/ba <dig> with the use of rna-seq <cit> . using systems biology and bioinformatic analysis tools, the pathology and disease mechanisms for schizophrenia were gradually resolved to discover new biological pathways, targets and new treatment strategy. sun j. et al. reported schizophrenic networks and pathways <cit> . disease networks were drawn for this complex disease <cit> , and the relationship between schizophrenia and cancer has also been investigated <cit> .

in phenopedia, the most reported schizophrenia-related gene was comt, which was supported by  <dig> publications; whereas drd <dig> and bdnf are supported by  <dig> and  <dig> publications respectively. atf <dig> is consistently under-expressed and appears in four different databases in both rna-seq and microarray analyzed brain samples, further evidence suggest that the atf <dig> associated trem- <dig> gene has significantly increased expression in monocytes of schizophrenia patients <cit> . the association of schizophrenia and the under-expression of the foxn <dig> gene has been reported <cit> .

a complementary research to evaluate the deficit in schizophrenia requires gwas analysis of candidate genes, snp changes of specific gene, clinical quantitative endophenotypes, genetic network and protein functionality from microarray, and ngs data of peripheral blood and postmortem brain samples. this study explores the sczcgs consistently found in different tissue-specific datasets, focusing on the genotypes of hemostasis and energy metabolism in schizophrenia. to illustrate the pathology of schizophrenia, differentially expressed candidate genes were constructed into protein-protein interaction  networks. relevant pathways and protein complexes were analyzed to discover novel cellular function or disease mechanism by systems biology in schizophrenia. moreover, the co-expressed sczgcs from different schizophrenic datasets were used to demonstrate the relationships of coagulation and mitochondrial function in schizophrenia.

methods
selection of differential expression genes by quantifying transcript abundances of postmortem brain tissue in schizophrenia
the raw reads datasets  were downloaded from the ncbi sra database. in erp <dig> <cit> , total rna was extracted from postmortem ba <dig> stg tissue from  <dig> schizophrenic patients and  <dig> matched controls sourced from the nsw tissue resource center, the university of sydney, australia. other publicly available human brain rna-seq datasets in ncbi sra database are listed in additional file  <dig> 

we aligned the fastq data of erp <dig> to the reference human transcriptome using bowtie  <dig> and sorted using samtools <cit> . in order to quantify transcript abundances, rsem <cit>  was used to normalize rna-seq data for each sample into transcripts per million . the significant differentially expressed transcripts with over- or under-expressed genes in the ba <dig> stg brain specimen were selected by using the student's t-test between the schizophrenia and control samples. the corresponding t-test of each gene with a p-value less than  <dig>  was defined as candidate genes for schizophrenia .

analysis flow of ngs datasets related with postmortem brain tissue in schizophrenia
a key challenge in transcript quantification from rna-seq data is the handling of reads that map to multiple genes or isoforms. we used tools such as bowtie  <dig> <cit>  and tophat <cit>  to align the reads. we also used quantification tools such as cufflinks <cit>  and rsem <cit>  to estimate the abundance and differential expression of transcripts. different quantification measures used in transcriptome analysis could result in different sets of candidate genes <cit> . rsem computes the maximum likelihood abundance using the expectation-maximization  algorithm for optimal distribution of multiple hit reads <cit> . the primary output of rsem is a measure of abundance in terms of transcripts per million . the tpm measure is preferred over the rpkm and fpkm measures because it is independent of the mean expressed transcript length and is thus more comparable across samples <cit> . the analytical process for the discovery of candidate genes, protein-protein interactions and corresponding pathways are illustrated in figure  <dig>  student's t-test was performed to identify significant differentially expressed genes as sczcgs.

to illustrate the pathology of schizophrenia, differentially expressed candidate genes, protein-protein interactions , related pathways and protein complexes were analyzed to discover novel cellular functions or disease mechanism by systemic biology in schizophrenia <cit> . the ppis were collected from bind <cit> , hprd <cit>  and biogrid <cit>  to construct the schizophrenic ppi network.

analysis of schizophrenic mediator network
with the sczcgs, we constructed the schizophrenic candidate genes and mediator network  to illustrate the ppi network of sczcgs with mediators. mediators were defined as protein nodes which interact with sczcgs and have a degree greater than one .

the mediator genes could manifest to the characteristic of sczmn in disease pathways. the sczmn was searched against david <cit> , mcl <cit>  and corum <cit>  for biological functions, subnetwork clustering and potential protein complexes.

schizophrenic network analysis with fold-change subnetwork clustering
by applying the markov cluster algorithm  <cit> , the combination of corresponding modulation from each node was calculated. each node in sczmn was weighted by fold change  which was calculated by dividing the schizophrenic expression mean  by the control expression mean . to account for the co-regulatory relationship between two nodes, fc of adjacent nodes were multiplied to represent the edge relationship of two neighbouring nodes and used as the mcl input. the co-regulation of subnetworks in schizophrenia was analyzed by mcl to explore the biological components and processes in schizophrenia.

analysis of regulatory relationship between pathways involving schizophrenic candidate genes
pathway analysis is the building process of identifying protein interactions, associated annotation and domain knowledgebase <cit> . the pathway enrichment analysis was performed with pid <cit> , reactome <cit> , cell-map <cit>  and humancyc <cit>  databases to obtain the potential pathways for the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

for obtaining potentially involved pathways in schizophrenia, the pathway enrichment analysis of the significant differentially expressed genes are prioritized and the significance of corresponding pathways is ranked by p-value with fdr less than  <dig>  with the benjamini-hochberg procedure using fdrtool <cit> .

RESULTS
exploration of schizophrenia candidate genes from different literature datasets
the significantly differential expressed genes were selected based on the curated database of literature reviews, laboratory reports, microarray differential expression analysis, generic risk prediction and rna-seq data analysis. several novel candidate genes and potential pathways were associated to the susceptibility mechanism of schizophrenia. the candidate genes reported by szgene <cit> , huang et al. <cit> , sellmann et al. <cit> , ayalew m et al. <cit> , wu et al. <cit>  and sczcgs were compared and revealed high inconsistency of putative genes and pathways, results are listed in additional file  <dig>  ncbi clinvar <cit>  provides pathogenic, protective and risk factors associated with schizophrenia, which was used to investigate the relationship between clinical manifestation and candidate genes.

the phenomenon of inconsistency of reported schizophrenic candidate genes are common between  <dig> different studies. only  <dig> schizophrenic candidate genes with count numbers above  <dig> have large numbers of publications. the less candidate genes been mentioned in studies , the less publication reports support. there are  <dig> schizophrenic candidate genes mention only once in the  <dig> studies.  <dig> of them have been reported in literature including nrg <dig> which has  <dig> publication reports mostly in gwas and animal study but not been reported in human post-mortem studies. even the candidate genes in human induced pluripotent stem cell  study are greatly different from human brain studies, the inconsistent result may result from different tissue samples, measurement techniques, quantification analysis tools and experimental condition. it is implicated the characteristic of heterogeneity and diverse transcriptome expression in schizophrenia.

many identified cellular functions and proteins as well as candidate genes are involved in schizophrenia. there are total  <dig> schizophrenic candidate genes reported in literature. the studies of huang et al., wu et al. and sellmann et al. used human postmortem brain tissue sample, there are also studies using other tissue-specific specimens including human blood and cell culture experiments from schizophrenic patients. the disc <dig> and bdnf genes are the top most reported schizophrenic candidate genes. the second most reported candidate genes are mthfr, gad <dig>  comt, atf <dig>  and apoe, which are reported in at least four literature reviews. the results reported by different databases are highly inconsistent with different papers reporting mostly different candidate genes.

schizophrenic candidate genes by different alignment and quantification tools
a key challenge in transcript quantification from rna-seq data is the handling of reads that map to multiple genes or isoforms. rsem computes maximum likelihood abundance estimates using the expectation-maximization  algorithm for its statistical model <cit> . the primary output of rsem is a measure of abundance in terms of transcripts per million . the tpm measure is preferred over the popular rpkm and fpkm measures because it is independent of the mean expressed transcript length and is thus more comparable across samples <cit> .

wu et al. used the tophat and cufflinks pipeline for alignment and tests for differential expression. in this study, the same rna-seq data was analyzed by bowtie  <dig> for alignment and rsem for transcript quantification to obtain candidate genes . there are  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> candidate genes reported by wu et al., sczcgs and szgene, respectively. only the genes fgf <dig> and sparcl <dig> appear in all three datasets.  <dig> identical candidate genes appear in both szgene and wu et al.  <dig> identical candidate genes exist in both szgene and sczcgs. there are  <dig> candidate genes in both wu et al. and sczcgs. there are total  <dig> under-expressed genes and  <dig> over-expressed candidate genes in schizophrenia from wu et al. there are  <dig> under-expressed and  <dig> over-expressed candidate genes  identical to sczcgs. it was implicated that different analytical alignment and quantification tools may result in partially similar but complementary candidate gene groups. only  <dig> genes appear in all three datasets: fgf <dig> and sparcl <dig>  snps in fgf <dig> were reported to be associated with the risk of developing schizophrenia <cit> . wu et al. reported  <dig> under-expressed genes and  <dig> over-expressed candidate genes in the mitochondria. however, there is only one candidate gene  involved in mitochondrial function in sczcgs.

in figure  <dig>  wu at al. reported  <dig> candidate genes using the tophat and cufflinks pipeline. however, using the same rna-seq data with bowtie  <dig> and rsem resulted in  <dig> candidate genes . these results show that the use of different alignment and quantification tools may result in a completely different set of candidate genes with little consistency, and even more so when compared with the  <dig> candidate genes in szgene.  <dig> genes appear in both wu el al. and szgene,  <dig> genes appear in both sczcgs and szgene. total  <dig> genes were selected from wu et al. and sczcgs which were matched in szgene. these matched genes may indicate the more robust candidate genes for schizophrenia with publication supports. however, there are  <dig> overlapped genes appear in both candidate genes of sczcgs and wu et al. but not in szgene, which they may be implicated the potential candidate genes for schizophrenia and need validation in the future study.

the few overlapped candidate genes selected from different quantification tools and measurement conditions may reflect the heterogeneity of complex disease such as schizophrenia. it may implicate the importance of mediator genes as the key role of disease susceptibility which is more conserved in the candidate genetic network of schizophrenia <cit> . similarly, the inconsistency of schizophrenic candidate genes was also showed by wu et al. and huang et al. using the same rna-seq datasets of post-mortem brain sample by different quantification tools. there are  <dig> overlapped candidate genes from  <dig> and  <dig> candidate genes by wu et al. and huang et al. the  <dig> candidate genes may represent the co-expressed genetic interactions by different quantification measurement. the cross-talk of genetic interaction by these co-expressed genes and reached candidate genes may address the key network in disease pathology. the  <dig> candidate genes contains  <dig> ppis which was formulated by  <dig> candidate genes including slc25a <dig>  prkaca, apex <dig>  nudt <dig>  rps <dig>  fgf <dig> and s100a <dig>  there are  <dig> candidate genes formulated  <dig> ppis which contain  <dig> candidate genes from both wu et al. and huang et al. if queried  <dig> candidate genes from wu et al. and huang et al., there are  <dig> candidate genes in top  <dig> candidate genes , the overlapped rate is  <dig> %. however, there are  <dig> genes found in top  <dig> candidate genes from  <dig> candidate genes in cross-talk genetic interaction of wu et al. and huang et al. the overlapped rate improved up to  <dig> % with  <dig> times increase. the accuracy of candidate genes evaluated from different quantification tools could be improved by crosstalk analysis of overlapped genes in genetic networks.

the genes reported by both wu et al. and szgene are involved in biological functions such as mitochondrial atp synthase complex, platelet degranulation, beta-amyloid binding protein, dna binding, transcription activity, calcium binding protein and cell cycle. however, the biological functions of genes reported by both huang et al. and szgene are calcium ion binding, cell cycle, platelet degranulation, mapk activity, dna binding, glycogen debranching enzyme activity, atp binding, fatty acid metabolic process, cytoskeleton structure, transcription activity and ubiquitin ligase complex. the genes reported in multiple datasets have similar biological function, and results in higher confidence of potential candidate genes for schizophrenia. it also indicates that the molecular network and biological processes are likely to be disturbed in schizophrenia patients <cit> . differential expressed gene exposure to atypical antipsychotic quetiapine are cell cycle-associated in the frontal cortex <cit> .

query-query ppi  network analysis of over- and under- expressed candidate genes in schizophrenia
a total of  <dig> candidate genes in sczcgs including  <dig> over-expressed and  <dig> under-expressed genes are used to construct a qqppi network of schizophrenia <cit> . the network consists of  <dig> genes with  <dig> ppis as illustrated in figure  <dig>  the zoomed areas show the linked over-expressed subsets. prkaca, tp <dig>  sp <dig> and stat <dig> have the highest degree centrality, in which stat <dig>  tp <dig> and prkaca are under-expressed genes, while sp <dig> is an over-expressed gene. the sec24c gene is associated with neurotransmitter transporters <cit> , while fgf <dig> and s <dig> family are related to schizophrenia <cit> .

the maximal subnetwork of  <dig> over-expressed genes includes mcm <dig>  cdkn2a, siva <dig>  tbl1x, sin3a, sp <dig>  mef2c, meis <dig>  tpm <dig>  s100a <dig>  prkcz, pard <dig>  plcb <dig> and camk2b. in this subnetwork, sp <dig> has been reported to be abnormally expressed in schizophrenia <cit> . sp1-dependent abnormal expression results in dysfunction of the mitochondrial complex i subunit <cit> . sin3a and tpm <dig> have also been reported to be associated with schizophrenia <cit> . mef2c is associated with adaptive selective pressure and the potential role in learning and memory <cit> . the maximal subnetwork of over-expressed genes was searched against corum, in which the plcb3-pard3-pard6a complex <cit>  was found. the complex induces transcriptional activation in intracellular ca2+ and the wnt signaling pathway. the wnt pathway is crucial for synaptic plasticity and its defect may contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia <cit> . it is implicated that plcb3-pard3-pard6a complex may be associated with the pathology for schizophrenia. other schizophrenia-associated complexes in sczcgs are also searched against corum which are listed in table  <dig>  the complexes involve spliceosome, mitochondrial ribosome and other proteins which mediated regulation transcriptions, second-messenger-mediated signaling, ribosome biogenesis and protein transport.

schizophrenic candidate pathway analysis with fdr adjustment
the pathway enrichment analysis was performed on sczcgs to select candidate pathways in schizophrenia using multiple pathway databases including pid, cell-map, reactome and humancyc.  <dig> enrichment pathways are derived from sczcgs in which  <dig> pathways were selected by their significance in p-value and fdr using the benjamini-hochberg procedure . alteration of darpp- <dig> expression level in stg of postmortem brain was found in schizophrenia <cit> , which highlight the importance of pathological change of dopamine and glutamate systems in schizophrenia. in order to explore the interactions and biological functions among those enrichment pathways, the enrichment pathways from pid were analyzed for crosstalk activity . the interacting pathways involving biological function may also contribute to the pathology of schizophrenia which includes transcription activity, signaling pathway, cancer-related pathway, tumor suppression, coagulation, insulin secretion, cell cycle, cell differentiation and apoptosis.

pathways reported to be associated with pathogenesis of schizophrenia include apoptosis <cit> , immune system <cit> , tnf signaling pathways <cit> , hemostasis <cit> , p <dig> pathway <cit> , bard <dig> signaling pathway <cit> , ceramide signaling pathway <cit> , erbb <dig> signaling pathway <cit>  and androgen receptor pathway <cit>  and hdac signaling pathway <cit> .

differential gene expression and mediator network clustering analysis
although the sczcgs represent the significant differentially expressed genes of schizophrenia, they may not be sufficient to present the whole picture of schizophrenia. many mediator genes may be involved in the genetic interactions without being detected as they are not usually in abundance. in order to further analyze the disease mechanism for schizophrenia, the sczmn was constructed using the genetic interactions of sczcgs and mediator genes.

the sczmn that consisted of  <dig> ppis may potentially represent the most comprehensive schizophrenia-associated genetic network. the sczmn was decomposed into clusters for analysis using the mcl algorithm. the mcl algorithm is an efficient graph clustering algorithm which helps classify sczmn into differential expression groups of optimal subnetworks. the algorithm partitions sczmn into clusters that are measured by edge weight of the corresponding nodes. each cluster was calculated according to their p-value with corresponding expressed genes and mediators. the involved over- and under-expressed genes in mcl clusters with p-value are listed in additional file  <dig> 

in cluster  <dig>  one of the highly ranked complexes searched against corum is the usp1-uaf <dig> complex which was reported as a schizophrenic candidate complex, and its inhibitor, pimozide, is one of the antipsychotics with the neuroleptic property of treating schizophrenic patients <cit> . it has been postulated that the usp1-uaf <dig> complex is associated with pathogenesis for schizophrenia. the sirt <dig> gene is another candidate gene in cluster  <dig>  which was associated with schizophrenia in a haplotype-wise analysis and may play an important role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia in the japanese population <cit> .

cluster  <dig> contains under-expressed genes such as drd <dig>  kif21a and ptpru. it also contains gria <dig>  snps within gria <dig> has been report to influence the response to antipsychotic treatment in schizophrenia <cit> . however, the new antipsychotic such as paliperidone has changed the serum level of coagulation factors viii and ix in rats <cit> . one of the mediator genes of cluster  <dig>  ncs- <dig> gene can mediate desensitization of d <dig> dopamine receptors <cit> . the ncs- <dig> protein expression was decreased in the prefrontal cortex and in t lymphocytes and nk cells of schizophrenic patients <cit> . besides, slc6a <dig> polymorphisms are associated with schizophrenia <cit> .

the complexes searched against corum revealed that the 2ar-mglur <dig> complex involved in altered cortical process might be potential target for treatment of schizophrenia due to interaction with htr2a  and metabotropic glutamate receptors  <cit> . it is implicated that there are potential complexes in cluster  <dig> which may be involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. the functional annotation of mcl in sczcgs, searched against david with cluster number over  <dig>  was shown in table  <dig>

mitochondrial dysfunction in schizophrenic candidate genes
dopamine modulates mitochondrial function through inhibition of respiratory complex i activity by abnormal interaction between dopamine and mitochondrial function <cit> . the genetic interaction for mitochondria function and schizophrenia were illustrated by drd <dig> linked to ndufs <dig> through protein-protein interactions of flna and arrb <dig> <cit> . treatment with psychotropics might ultimately enhance energy metabolism and reduce the damage of oxidative stress <cit> . snx <dig> and mrpl <dig> are over-expressed candidate genes which interact with mitochondrial functions. bard <dig>  rbms <dig>  prkab <dig>  ube2l <dig>  sco <dig>  pin <dig>  mrpl <dig>  bag <dig>  ndufb <dig>  capn <dig>  stat <dig>  mpst, tcof <dig> and sec24c are all under-expressed genes which interact with the respiratory chain complex i in mitochondria .

wu et al. listed  <dig> candidate genes  located in the inner membrane of mitochondria, however, in this study  <dig> candidate genes are found  not located in the mitochondria but interact and regulate mitochondria functions. they may turn off or disturb the biological function of mitochondria and energy metabolism in schizophrenia.

wu et al. found  <dig> major candidate genes associated with the mitochondrial complex i subunits that contains  <dig> mitochondria genes according to corum. since the mitochondria is responsible for vital biological processes such as energy metabolism, calcium buffering and apoptosis, it indicates the importance of mitochondrial dysfunction in the manifestation of schizophrenia <cit> .

schizophrenic differential gene expression in coagulation
the candidate genes for schizophrenia are compared with datasets of different brain samples and literature databases. to investigate the relationship between hemostasis and schizophrenia, the hemostatic ppi network of differentially expressed candidate genes was analyzed and illustrated in figure 6
. huang et al. reported  <dig> differentially expressed candidate genes in the hemostasis pathway of the reactome database which consists of f <dig>  fn <dig>  sin3a, nos <dig>  olr <dig>  plau, prkaca, prkcz, rad51b, tp <dig>  calu and pick <dig>  similarly, wu et al. reported  <dig> candidate genes in the hemostasis pathway of the reactome database which consists of hmg20b, gp1bb, hras, hist2h3a, kcnmb <dig>  atp2b <dig>  ppia, prkaca, prkcg, klc <dig>  sod <dig>  tbxa2r, tf, tuba4a, mafk, calm <dig>  calm <dig> and cd <dig> 

many genes in the network have been reported in previous studies. alb, anxa <dig> and calr are candidate genes in szgene. the under-expressed candidate genes reported by huang et al. are f <dig>  f <dig> and clic. the over-expressed candidate gene  and under-expressed candidate gene  have been reported by sellmann et al.. htr2a and drd <dig> are listed as risk candidate genes for schizophrenia in clinvar. htr2a, drd <dig> and drd <dig> interact with the coagulation gene f <dig> through flna which causes a critical bottleneck and cascade into the following coagulation pathways. it may be implicated as the potential hemostatic mechanism for antipsychotic-induced thromboembolism.

discussion
mitochondria and schizophrenia
the mitochondrial dysfunction may decrease brain ph by magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies in living patients <cit> . mitochondrial dysfunction such as the accumulation of mitochondrial dna damage and reactive oxygen species  production have underlined the pathological mechanism for schizophrenia <cit> . reduced numbers of mitochondria in striatum and impaired mitochondria activity in the caudate nucleus have been associated with increased risk of schizophrenia <cit> . antioxidants seemed to improve mitochondrial performance. niacin, one of the antioxidant, could improve the manifestation of schizophrenic symptoms. nnmt, hcar <dig> and qprt are targets of nicotinic receptors. reduced nnmt mrna level was noted in post-mortem schizophrenic patients <cit> . qprt-involved kynurenine pathway of cortical metabolism is impaired in schizophrenia <cit> . hcar <dig> protein was significantly decreased in schizophrenic group <cit> . decreased niacin receptor responses were manifested in schizophrenia, and niacinamide is neuroprotective which is potentially associated with the pathogenesis of schizophrenia <cit> . treatment of niacin could improve mutism in a patient with mitochondrial encephalopathy and schizophrenia <cit> .

the potential regulatory pathway for hemostasis in schizophrenia
it has been postulated that hemostatic markers of thrombogenesis are increased in acute psychotic patients. increased serum level of coagulation factor viii and platelets are reported in acute psychotic patients <cit> . thromboembolism in schizophrenic patients may result from pathological change of schizophrenic candidate genes or the administration of antipsychotic. the reason for homeostasis in schizophrenia ascertains that increased risk of thrombogenesis in schizophrenic patients with antipsychotics treatment has been reported. second-generation antipsychotics such as olanzapine, risperidone and clozapine are associated with increased dose-dependent risk of venous thromboembolism <cit>  which result from partially inhibition of platelet aggression in schizophrenic patients <cit> .

regulatory pathways of involving under-expressed candidate genes in schizophrenia
in this study, three candidate pathways are associated with under-expressed candidate genes . lkb <dig> signaling pathway interacts with under-expressed genes prkab <dig> and strada. prkab <dig> is associated with polymorphisms in amp-activated protein kinase  and antipsychotic-induced weight gain <cit> . in addition, prkaca contained cluster which involved neurotransmission related functions may be relevant to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia <cit> . it also appears in the candidate genes for schizophrenia in szgene. it is implicated that akt/gsk <dig> pathway may contribute to the development of schizophrenia <cit> . glycogen synthase kinase 3-β  has a vital role in many intracellular signaling pathways which involved in gene transcription, cytoskeletal reorganization, energy metabolism, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. gsk3β activity also has been associated with schizophrenia <cit> . gsk3β polymorphisms might be involved in parkinson's disorder and schizophrenia risk <cit> . the research findings suggest that lkb <dig> activity induced transcriptional functions including phosporylation of gsk3β and apc binding to microtubules which mediates the microtubule stabilization in the leading process tip <cit> . lkb <dig> signaling pathway is crucial for neuronal migration in the developing neocortex and dysfunction of lkb <dig> signaling pathway may play a crucial role in neuronal migration and the development of schizophrenia.

bard <dig> signaling pathway contains three under-expressed genes, bard <dig>  pcna and ube2l <dig>  in which ube2l <dig> polymorphism is associated with schizophrenia <cit> , and polymorphism study reveals that bard <dig> is risk allele for schizophrenia <cit> . it indicates that bard <dig> signaling pathway dysfunction may represent a novel susceptibility pathway for schizophrenia.

the aurora a signaling pathway interacts with under-expressed genes including tp <dig>  prkaca, arhgef <dig> and ppp2r5d. tp <dig> is considered as a candidate susceptibility gene for schizophrenia which may play a role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia <cit> . ppp2r5d is in co-expression network in wnt pathway of schizophrenia tissue sample <cit> . it is implicated that inhibition of the aurora a signaling pathway may be a novel susceptibility pathway for schizophrenia.

hedgehog signaling pathway and schizophrenia
the hedgehog signaling pathway is one of the significant signaling pathways involving schizophrenic candidate genes such as sin3a, csnk1g <dig>  prkaca, and spop. the crosstalk of pid candidate pathway for schizophrenia between hedgehog signaling pathway and other cancer-related pathways such as lkb <dig> signaling events, aurora signaling pathway, erbb2/erbb <dig> signaling pathway and tnf alpha/nfkb signaling pathway. crosstalk between hedgehog and other signaling pathways such as pi3k/akt pathway is critical in the development of embryonic cell and cancer therapies <cit> . genetic variation in med <dig> which has been implicated in neural development is associated with schizophrenia, and its mutations link with deregulated gli3-dependent sonic hedgehog signaling pathway <cit> . antipsychotics such as clozapine, chlorpromazine and haloperidol regulate hedgehog signaling pathway through dhcr <dig> modulation <cit> . hedgehog signaling pathway may represent a pathogenesis of schizophrenia.

rho signaling pathway is also responsible for schizophrenia <cit> . arhgap <dig> is associated with schizophrenia <cit> . arhg  family genes are associated with schizophrenia <cit>  which encodes a member of the rho family of small gtpases. rho proteins promote reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and regulate cell shape, attachment, and motility. in this study, there are schizophrenic candidate gene including rhog family genes such as under-expressed genes, arhgef <dig>  arhgap <dig>  arhgap <dig> and arhgef7; and over-expressed genes, arhgef <dig> 

coagulation network in schizophrenia
the use of second-generation antipsychotics  is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism <cit> . the biological mechanisms responsible for the possible thrombosis reaction are not quite clear. in schizophrenia-coagulation network, the sczcgs including f <dig>  fn <dig> and fgl <dig> are differential expressed candidate genes which are associated with coagulation function. they may account for the variant gene expression by not only schizophrenia itself, but also by antipsychotic administration.

some hypotheses have been suggested such as drug-induced sedation, obesity, enhanced platelet aggregation, increased levels of antiphospholipid antibodies, hyperprolactinemia, hyperhomocysteinemia and smoking which result in increased activity in the coagulation system <cit> . however, evidence of venous thromboembolic events in schizophrenia may be induced by psychosis itself rather than by antipsychotic administration <cit> . moreover, chronic anticoagulation therapy  is associated with remission of psychotic symptoms, which suggest that imbalance of plasminogen activator levels in the brain may affect the stabilization of psychotic symptoms <cit> .

in this study, sczcgs are discovered and associated with coagulation function, which may result from the variant gene expression by not only schizophrenia itself, but also by antipsychotic administration. this network also implicated the genetic interactions between hemostasis pathway and antipsychotic associated genes  which implicated the potential explanation of increased coagulation activity in antipsychotic treatment.

the relationship between dopamine, serotonin and coagulation function
the well-understood pathophysiology of schizophrenia is cytoskeleton deficit and cell cycle. cytoskeleton-associated proteins play crucial roles not only in cell regulation and migration but also in cell proliferation. a cytoskeleton-associated gene mutations in the filamin a  cause periventricular heterotopia , cell cycle prolongation, compromised neural progenitor proliferation, and reduced brain size <cit> . however, flna is one of the novel schizophrenia candidate genes <cit>  which was involved in the glutamate receptor signaling subnetwork, and might result in brain structure change such as enlargement of the cerebroventricular system, reduced size in cortical region, and abnormal laminar organization with differential genetic changes including abnormal expression of multiple proteins that are involved in cellular functionality such as neuron migration, cell proliferation, axonal outgrowth, and apoptosis <cit> .

htr2a interact with drd <dig> through gnai <dig>  drd <dig> and drd <dig> interact with flna cascade the subsequently coagulation associated genes such as f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig> and ubc which provides antipsychotic biological mechanism of dopamine d2/d <dig> receptor subtypes that involved downstream signaling pathway through the cytoskeleton of actin filaments <cit> .

signaling pathway of coagulation function in schizophrenia
the risk for cardiovascular mortality among those with schizophrenia is increased twofold as compared with patients without schizophrenia <cit> . there is increasing evidence of association between venous thromboembolism and antipsychotic administration <cit> , especially second-generation antipsychotics including clozapine, olanzapine and risperidone <cit> . the pathogenesis of elevated risk of thrombosis for schizophrenic patients are not clear, which result from poor life style, enhanced platelet aggregation, sedative medication, obesity, and lack of movement <cit> . it is implicated that the risk of vte in schizophrenia may result from disease itself instead of the antipsychotic medication <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the big data analysis of ngs by high-throughput technology brought new insights to the global view of complex diseases, which helped to explain the interrelationships among potential pathways and protein complexes, and to discover biological function from the corresponding cortical region. the next generation data of rna sequence revealed more detailed transcriptional alteration in schizophrenia.

in this study, the comparison and integration of differential expression candidate genes are analyzed from different literatures to explore the relationships between the mitochondrial dysfunction and hemostatic pathways in schizophrenia and control samples. by the integration of transcriptome alteration in ngs ba <dig> brain tissue and analysis of differential expression candidate genes, the sczcgs of schizophrenia provide a major approach for the discovery of potential complexes and pathways, which investigation of potential schizophrenic pathology with mitochondrial and coagulation pathways. it is implicated that the hypofunction of mitochondria may contribute to the pathogenesis of negative symptoms of schizophrenia such as hypoactivity, loss of energy, weakness and social withdraw, which restoration of mitochondria function or energy metabolism might be a potential strategy for improvement of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.

the thromboembolism in schizophrenia revealed the potential alteration of hemostatic pathways which may result from the interaction of antipsychotic target genes with coagulation factor genes. the critical role of htr2a and drd2/ <dig> interact with the tissue factor  through flna which potentiates a bottleneck in coagulation network. it may illustrate the potential mechanism of thromboembolism in schizophrenia.

in analysis of sczmn, the clusters screened by the gene function classification tool may reveal the candidate complexes or pathways to discover the potential pathogenesis for schizophrenia. it helped to explain the interrelationships among potential pathways and protein complexes, and to discover biological function from the corresponding cortical region. the potential hemostatic process and mitochondria-related complexes could be implicated for the disease mechanism of schizophrenia.
