BACKGROUND
twist <dig> is a basic helix-loop-helix  transcription factor  <cit>  which forms either homo-or-heterodimers with other bhlh proteins to bind to a core e-box  sequence on the promoter region of target genes through the basic region  <cit> . twist is necessary for the development of the mesoderm  <cit> , cell type determination and differentiation during myogenesis  <cit> , neurogenesis  <cit> , cardiogenesis  <cit>  and also required for formation of the head mesenchyme, somites and limb buds  <cit> . twist loses its function as a negative modulator during the differentiation of separate mesodermal layers, myogenesis, osteogenesis or neurogenesis  <cit> . twist has also been implicated in neural tube closure and null mice mutants are embryonic lethal at e <dig> , whereas twist is essential for normal development and promotes autosomal dominant defects characterized by minor skull and limb anomalies in humans  <cit> . mutations in twist <dig> result in saethre-chotzen syndrome , known as an autosomal dominant craniosynostosis  <cit> . in addition, mutations in the helix domain of the twist <dig> gene can cause subcellular mislocalization and increased degradation of its protein product  <cit> . twist also acts as a key regulator of metastasis, and overexpression of twist <dig> in subsets of sporadic human breast cancer promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition through down-regulation of e-cadherin which was confirmed in a murine breast tumor model  <cit> .

potential functions of twist <dig> are not well defined. previous studies have shown that twist functions as a transcriptional repressor and is regulated by its dimerization with other bhlh-containing transcriptional factors. for instance, post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation can alter the dimerization preferences of twist, promoting either homodimer or heterodimer formation  <cit> . the twist heterodimer can also act a transcription repressor, whereas twist homodimer acts as a transcription activator in drosophila mesoderm development and in human cranial suture patterning  <cit> . in order for a protein to function as an activator and/or repressor of transcription of a target gene, efficient nuclear localization is essential  <cit> . directed nuclear entry requires the presence of nuclear localization signals  that recognize and associate with the nuclear import receptors. nuclear localization signals  mediate active transport of protein into the nucleus selectively and efficiently  <cit> . therefore, identification and functional characterization of twist nlss would represent a necessary and important step in understanding the regulation of twist and its interaction with other bhlh proteins.

in this study, we identified two nlss present at the n-terminal region of human twist rich in basic amino acids lysine and arginine. using site directed mutagenesis and immunofluorescence assays, we studied the role of these two nlss in nuclear localization. yeast-two-hybrid and immunoprecipitation assays were also performed to identify twist-interacting proteins and gain a greater understanding of the mechanism responsible for h-twist localization and function.

RESULTS
comparison of various twist proteins
h-twist contains  <dig> amino acids  <cit> . a sequence comparison of human, mouse, rat, chicken, claw frog, zebra fish and fugu twist proteins based on homology  <cit> , identified five highly conserved domains in twist proteins. besides a novel nseee-domain , two potential nlss, nls <dig> and nls <dig> found at the n-terminal region of the twist protein present at positions 37– <dig>  and 73– <dig> , respectively with unknown function. these proteins share 80–100% homology from different vertebrates, more specifically 93% identity in the bhlh regions, 100% in nls <dig>  80% in nls <dig>  and 100% in nseee and wr domains. it is already well known that in h-twist, hlh region present on amino acid position 121– <dig> is necessary for protein dimerization and the basic amino acid region present at the position 108– <dig> is required for dna binding .

subcellular-localization of h-twist-nls mutants
localization of many transcription factors has been shown to be an important mechanism in the regulation of protein functions. transcription factor proteins are nuclear proteins able to interact with gene regulatory sequences to activate gene expression. to facilitate monitoring of the cellular localization of twist, we generated a c-myc-twist fusion expression construct and mutated the putative nls motifs shown in table  <dig>  using site directed mutagenesis. for these experiments, we transfected cells with expression plasmids harbouring the gene for wild-type twist or twist mutated nls motifs.

the mutated amino acids are in bold and underlined. , indicates presence of protein within that subcellular compartment determined by immunofluorescence assays.

the recombinant twistwt protein localized exclusively to the nucleus of transient transfected cells, in agreement with a previous report on h-twist localization  <cit>  . transfection with pcmv alone was used as a negative control. no c-myc signals were detected with empty vector . as a positive control, we fused c-myc with β-galactosidase . the β-gal-cmyc fusion protein was seen predominantly in the cytoplasm  <cit>  .

expressions of the twist fusion proteins were also examined by cellular fraction and immunoblotting. a single 28-kda protein band was recognized for c-myc-twistwt by an anti-c-myc antibody . pcmv empty vector transfected in cells was used as a negative control along with c-myc-twistwt fusion construct in our first set of experiments. no signal was detected in cells transfected with the negative control plasmid .

classical nls motifs are composed of a basic amino acid stretch 4- <dig> preceded by a gly, pro, or an acidic amino acid residue  <cit> . the n terminal of m-twist which is an analogue of h-twist binds to p300/pcaf and decreases its histone acetyl-transferase activity  <cit> . alignment of amino acid sequences encoded by the twist gene from different species predicts two putative nlss within h-twist at the n terminal with the most conserved segment containing lysine residues. therefore, our hypothesis was that the lysine residues in the nls motif might be essential in nuclear localization. mutation in the nls <dig> site strongly abrogated the nuclear localization of the fusion protein as the twistnls <dig> mutant  was found to be no longer enriched in the nucleus but showed high expression in the cytoplasm of  <dig> out of  <dig> transfected cells . this provides experimental evidence that twist-nls  is functionally significant for nuclear localization. mutation in twistnls <dig> at position k73r, and k77r also resulted in cytoplasmic expression  as these transfected cells showed very low levels in the nucleus. in contrast, the subcellular localization of twistnls <dig> k76r mutant was only observed in the nucleus, at levels consistent with the twistwt .

in biochemical experiments, twist nls mutant proteins were in cytoplasmic fractions of transfected cells by immunoblot analyses. in these experiments, there were high levels of expression for the k38r and k73r mutants in the cytoplasmic lysate , consistent with our microscopy . we detected very low levels of the k76r mutant in the cytoplasm; a finding entirely consistent where the majority of staining is seen restricted to the nucleus. interestingly, k77r showed expression in the cytoplasm, although our imaging results identified that it was not restricted to the nucleus. these results would indicate that this mutant that loses its nuclear targeting is either not soluble or expressed perhaps in intracellular organelles not solubilized by our protocol.

rescue of mislocalization of twist mutants by co-transfection with heterodimer partner e12
bhlh transcriptional factor proteins are able to form either a homodimer or heterodimer with other bhlh protein for dna binding. given this property, we selected e <dig>  a bhlh protein which forms a heterodimer with other bhlh proteins and also has been shown to interact with twist  <cit> . co-localization of twist with e <dig> protein was studied to determine the recovery of localization of twist nls mutants in the nucleus. for this, e <dig> cdna was subcloned into the egfp-n <dig> vector in the same gfp reading frame and protein expression was examined in cells using fluorescence microscopy. in a control experiment, egfp vector alone was transiently transfected into the cells and exhibited non-specific distribution of fluorescence protein throughout the cell , while in contrast egfp-e <dig> interaction was predominantly localized in the nucleus .

in order to investigate direct interactions between twist and e <dig>  the twistwt and twistnls <dig> mutant with egfp-e <dig> were transiently transfected into the cells. here, we observed that the coexpression of twistnls <dig> mutant k38r with e <dig> compensates for the mislocalization of this construct and results in the restoration of nuclear expression of the twist mutant. the same co-expression results were obtained using k73r and k77r with e <dig> . nuclear localization could be observed despite the non-functional nlss.

screening for twist interacting partners using yeast two hybrid assay
to gain additional insights into the roles of twist domains, we were interested in the identification of proteins interacting with twist, and thus utilized a yeast two-hybrid screening assay . we identified a twist-associated protein called transcription factor  <dig>  also known as immunoglobulin transcription factor- <dig> , sl3- <dig> and enhancer factor- <dig> ,  .

yeast two hybrid positive clones were identified by blast sequence analysis. our clone id, putative interacted protein name, subcellular localization and accession numbers are shown.

the interaction between tcf- <dig> and twist was confirmed in yeast by co-transformation tcf- <dig> plasmid and the twist bait plasmid on nutritional quadrate dropout plates with  <dig> mm 3-amino triazole to determine reporter gene activation. in this assay, p53/pgbkt <dig> clone transformed into ah <dig> mated with y <dig> strain containing t7-antigene in pgadt7-vectors was used as a positive control, and p53/pgbkt <dig> in ah <dig> mated with lamc/pgadt <dig> transformed into y <dig> was used as a negative control to confirm the specificity of the interaction. only the yeast cells containing both tcf- <dig> and twist were able to grow on the nutritional dropout plates, suggesting the interaction between tcf- <dig> and twist was the result of specific binding . similar results for β-galactosidase activity were also observed in all yeast positive clones .

confirmation of the tcf- <dig> and twist interaction by nls rescue assay
as discussed above, twist is a nuclear protein that forms dimers with other hlh or bhlh protein, and mutations in twist nlss result in nuclear mislocalization. since we hypothesized that the co-transfection of tcf- <dig> with nls deficient twist will restore protein localization to the nucleus, we performed additional nls rescue assays, using c-myc twist expression constructs and co transfected with a tcf4-gfp construct. the empty gfp was distributed throughout the cell , whereas tcf4-gfp expression was predominantly localized to the nucleus of cells . in this assay, twistnls <dig> mutant which was unable to be transported in the nucleus was cotransfected with tcf- <dig> to check whether the lack of a functional nls could be compensated by heterodimerization and subsequent co-import of the two proteins. co-localization of both proteins in the nucleus was detected in the cells co-transfected with both twistnls <dig> mutant and tcf- <dig> constructs . the same co-expression results were observed using k73r and k77r with tcf- <dig> .

furthermore, having identified tcf- <dig> as an interacting protein for twist in the yeast two-hybrid assay, we examined the ability of twist to interact with tcf- <dig> protein in mammalian cells by performing immunoprecipitation from nuclear extract of hek293t cells transfected with full length v5- tagged twist in the presence of cbp- tagged tcf- <dig>  immunocomplexes precipitated with anti-cbp antibody were resolved by sds-page and western blotting using anti-v <dig> antibodies identified bands corresponding to the expected sizes of the twist showed the interaction between these two proteins . for these pull down experiments, we used two different cbp antibodies  to differing success rates. we determined that although ab k- <dig> worked to some extent, the best affinity pulldowns were observed with the w- <dig> antibody, with at least a 5-fold greater purification observed . igg beads with protein and antibody, and beads without antibody were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. extracts immunoprecipitated  with theses anti-cbp tag antibodies were then probed using anti-v <dig> antibody to determine whether v5-conjugated twist was co-precipitated under these conditions. no twist was seen in the control conditions, but a clear specific band representing twist was seen in the cotransfected cells immunoprecipitated with the w- <dig> antibody.

discussion
in this study, we identified two putative nlss at the n-terminal region of twist and found that these nlss mediate the expression of twist in the nucleus. an evolutionary alignment of twist proteins amino acid sequences encoded from different species showed five different highly conserved regions nls <dig>  nls <dig>  nseee at n-terminal, wr at c-terminal and bhlh dna binding domain. the hlh region is necessary and sufficient for protein dimerization  <cit> . besides having two putative nuclear localization signals, the n-terminal of m-twist which is an analogue of h-twist can also bind to p300/pcaf and decrease its histone acetyl-transferase activity  <cit> . moreover, the c-terminus of twist possesses a wr domain which is a runx2-binding "twist box" and inhibit the runx <dig> function during skeletal development  <cit> .

nuclear localization signals in twist
the regulation of protein transport into the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell is mediated by specific nuclear localization signals  recognized by protein import receptors  <cit> . the nls sequence consists of a cluster of basic residues, either monopartite or bipartite  <cit> . this sequence is subsequently recognized by the heterodimeric import receptor complex comprising importin α and importin β  <cit> . importin α is an adapter protein that consists of a small n-terminal β-binding domain. importin β does not directly interact with the nls cargo but acts to direct importin α to the nuclear pore  <cit> . the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of large molecules is normally mediated by classical nlss  <cit>  and necessary for normal physiology and cellular trafficking. it might be that additional nls sites exist in other domains of the proteins. here, we show that n-terminal of h-twist contain  <dig> nls motifs which are required for nuclear transport of this protein.

we mutated both of the predicted nls lysine residues to determine their potential role in the importation of twist protein. the nls <dig> mutant constructs were observed in the cytoplasm indicating that twistnls <dig> is a functional nls, which governs the nuclear import of twist. previously, similar results were made for murine dermo- <dig>  a bhlh protein encoded by the twist <dig> gene, in which engineered replacement of the equivalent nls  by four alanine residues impaired nuclear import  <cit> . it is of particular interest that a novel mutation in the nls <dig> of twist protein reported in scs patients at c115g, resulting in an arg39gly mutation was not restricted to the nucleus, but found expressed in both nucleus and cytoplasm in cos- <dig> cells  <cit> . these results are entirely consistent with our findings here, identifying this region as a core nls motif.

we also examined the functional role of nls <dig> by mutagenesis and found that nls <dig> likewise nls <dig>  also played an essential role in the nuclear import of twist protein. although in this study we focused on the lysine residues within the nls <dig> and  <dig> motifs, it is also possible that other residues within these domains may also contribute to nuclear localization. from our findings, it is concluded that sequences at the  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> amino acid positions within the nls domains are critical residues. in contrast, the  <dig> amino acid does not appear to be critical for nuclear import.

heterodimerization of tcf- <dig> with twist and co-localization in the mammalian cells
h-twist belongs to a class of bhlh protein known to form stable heterodimers with members of class a bhlh transcription factors  <cit> . interestingly, twist and myod interactions may prevent the specific activation of target genes for osteogenic differentiation, which has been proposed to result in the molecular pathogenesis of the saethre-chotzen syndrome  <cit> . e <dig> also known as tcf- <dig>  a bhlh protein, has been reported to interact with h-twist and this heterodimerization could compensate the nucleus localization of twist having mutations in bhlh motif in a co-transfected cos <dig> cells  <cit> . we utilized a similar approach in the case of mutated twist-nlss to confirm the expected nuclear location of the wild-type twist protein and the twist-nls mutants with e <dig> and reported that e <dig> interaction with twist compensates the non-functional nlss.

in yeast-two-hybrid screening, we identified several novel proteins interacting with twist including a gene encoding the class i bhlh protein tcf- <dig> . the tcf- <dig> gene is conserved in many species, its expression found in adult heart, placenta, skeletal muscle, lung where twist is also highly expressed  <cit> . tcf <dig> is a bhlh transcription factor and contains two alternatively spliced forms of mouse tcf <dig> , termed itf-2a and itf-2b, that differentially regulate myod activation  <cit> . an alignment of the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids with the n-termini of full-length e <dig> and full-length e <dig> and itf-2b revealed that this domain is 51% identical among the three e type proteins and hlh domain was also highly conserved in all three proteins  <cit> . the high expression levels of tcf <dig> in the brain suggests that it may regulate the activity of some neuron and neuro-endocrinology specific promoters, including the tyrosine hydroxylase enhancer and the somatostatin receptor ii promoter  <cit> .

in this study, we confirmed the heterodimerization of tcf- <dig> with twist in nls rescue assays and in vitro binding assay. since the nls mutant twist is unable to localize to the nucleus, this study illustrates that twist can form a functional complex together with overexpressed tcf- <dig>  similar to that observed with e <dig>  and that these interactions can restore nuclear localization despite the mutation in nlss.

CONCLUSIONS
it has already been reported that protein transcription factors may possess more than one nls  <cit> ; presumably a multitude of nls may increase the rate of protein factor-transporter protein interactions  <cit> . our study demonstrates the presence of two putative nls motifs in h-twist and suggests that these nls sequences are functional. these two nlss may also operate in a cooperative manner for more efficient nuclear translocation. we also conclude that the mislocalization of nls mutated construct could be restored with other bhlh proteins through heterodimerization with h-twist.
