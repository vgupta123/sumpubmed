BACKGROUND
in all animal species studied to date the activation of the oocyte is triggered by transient elevation of the cytoplasmic concentration of free ca2+ ions . in mammals, the increase in i during fertilisation occurs in the form of i oscillations, which start when the oocyte is penetrated by spermatozoon  <cit>  and last for several hours until the formation of pronuclei  <cit> . it has been proposed that oocyte activation is caused by a soluble factor introduced into the oocyte by spermatozoon during fusion of the gametes  <cit> . more recently, a novel, spermatozoon-specific isoform of phospholipase c, named phospholipase cζ , has been identified in mouse, man and cynomologus monkey, and it has been shown to be a spermatozoon-derived oocyte-activating factor  <cit> .

the ability of an oocyte to be activated by fertilising spermatozoon develops during the meiotic maturation. it is known that spermatozoon-induced i transients are mediated by the release of ca2+ ions from the endoplasmic reticulum through the pathway which involves inositol  <dig> ,5-triphosphate  receptors  <cit> . oocytes develop sensitivity to ip <dig> during oocyte maturation  <cit> . the change in the organization of the endoplasmic reticulum  during oocyte maturation may contribute to this enhanced sensitivity. it was demonstrated that in maturing mouse oocyte, er undergoes reorganisation and in fully mature oocyte it aggregates within the cortical region  <cit> . these changes coincide with the redistribution and increase in the number of ip <dig> receptors  <cit> .

experimental fertilisation of immature oocytes can be used to study the development of the ability of the oocyte to be activated. clarke and masui  <cit>  showed that maturing murine oocytes, which had been penetrated by spermatozoa, were able to complete meiotic maturation, but did not undergo subsequent activation. this demonstrates that spermatozoon-derived oocyte-activating factor is unable to induce activation when introduced into maturing oocyte, probably because of its inactivation by the cytoplasm of maturing oocyte  <cit> . immature oocyte are able to create i transients soon after being penetrated by spermatozoon  <cit> , but they generate fewer i oscillations and cease oscillating earlier than mature oocytes  <cit> . tang et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that in vitro matured oocytes lost the ability to generate i transients induced by sperm-factor when they had been stimulated by sperm extracts during oocyte maturation. these authors suggested that in mouse oocytes, the prolonged i oscillations depend on the "maternal machinery" mechanism that can be switched on only once and becomes inactivated by premature introduction of the spermatozoon-derived oocyte-activating factor  <cit> . however, another possibility is that the changes in ca2+ signaling pathway which take place after its premature stimulation, are quantitative in nature, and depend on the amount of the sperm factor introduced into the oocyte. thus, the aim of our experiments was to examine if the premature introduction of a single spermatozoon into maturing oocyte, affects its ability to be activated and to generate ca2+ response after completion of maturation, in metaphase ii  stage. since mouse oocytes fertilised during maturation in vitro lose their ability to fuse with additional spermatozoa when they reach mii stage  <cit> , we used intracytoplasmic sperm injection  to introduce spermatozoa into maturing oocytes. next, when the oocytes reached mii we refertilised them in vitro. we observed that oocytes injected with the spermatozoa during in vitro maturation, retained, after completion of maturation, the ability to be activated and to develop i oscillations in response to penetration by spermatozoa.

RESULTS
efficiency of icsi into maturing oocytes
injection of spermatozoon does not affect the ability of the oocytes to complete maturation; 83% of injected and 83% of control  oocytes extruded pb <dig> and reached mii stage. in order to assess the efficiency of icsi into maturing oocytes, the oocytes were fixed between  <dig>  and  <dig> h after injection of spermatozoa and after completion of meiotic maturation  and observed as a whole-mount preparations. the chromatin of spermatozoa was present in the cytoplasm of 88%  of oocytes, which were fixed  <dig>  –  <dig> h after icsi. nuclei of spermatozoa, which were injected into oocytes, first underwent decondensation and then recondensed. these changes were similar to spermatozoon transformations observed during fertilisation of mature mii oocytes  <cit> . however, when spermatozoa-injected oocytes were examined after completion of maturation, only 65%  of oocytes contained in their cytoplasm the recondensed spermatozoon-derived chromatin. the proportion of oocytes, which had spermatozoa in their cytoplasm at the end of maturation , was significantly lower  than the proportion of oocytes in which the presence of the spermatozoon-derived chromatin was observed  <dig>  –  <dig> h after icsi. this suggested that some maturing oocytes discarded the microinjected spermatozoa. this was confirmed by our finding that half  of the oocytes subjected to icsi and lacking the spermatozoon-derived chromatin in their cytoplasm had, in addition to first polar body , the "pseudo-polar bodies" containing recondensed chromatin of the spermatozoon, and another half of the oocytes  had noticeably larger first polar body that, besides the meiotic chromosomes, also contained the spermatozoon-derived chromatin.

can oocytes fertilised during maturation be activated after refertilization in mii?
experimental oocytes  were fertilised twice: first by icsi  <dig> –  <dig> h after gvbd and next by conventional ivf in mii stage. there were three control groups of maturing in vitro oocytes: 1) fertilised once by icsi during maturation,  <dig> –  <dig> h after gvbd , 2) fertilized once by conventional ivf at mii stage , and 3) unfertlised oocytes which matured in vitro up to mii stage . oocytes from all three variants were cultured for  <dig> –  <dig> h and were examined for the signs of activation  and formation of pronuclei). subsequently, the oocytes were fixed and mounted on slides. the diagram of the experiment is shown in figure  <dig> 

the number of activated oocytes in various variants of the experiment is presented in table  <dig> and in figure  <dig>  in a double fertilisation variant  the extrusion of the pb <dig> was observed in 78% of oocytes and 87% of oocytes had 1– <dig> pronuclei. the presence of one or two pronuclei indicated that either the first  spermatozoon-derived nucleus or the second,  or both  spermatozoa-derived nuclei have been eliminated from the oocyte . another possibility was that the chromatin of microinjected spermatozoon had merged with chromosomes of the oocyte during maturation and, thus, after activation, formed a single hybrid pronucleus  <cit> . the possibility that the formation of a single pronucleus resulted from spontaneous activation of the oocyte was tested in control experiments described below. the presence of more than three pronuclei in activated oocytes indicated polispermic penetration during ivf.

a, b and c, d values with different superscripts are significantly different .

among oocytes, which matured in vitro and were fertilised only once at the mii stage , almost all extruded pb <dig> and formed pronuclei . oocytes from both groups  extruded pb2s approximately  <dig> –  <dig> h after the end of incubation with spermatozoa. fertilised oocytes from "ivf" group contained two to seven pronuclei. presence of two pronuclei indicated monospermic penetration, while the presence of more than two pronuclei in the oocyte cytoplasm suggested polyspermic fertilization.

none of the oocytes from "icsi" and "no icsi and no ivf" groups extruded the pb <dig> during culture. 95% of oocytes from "no icsi and no ivf" group were blocked in mii and only  <dig> oocytes from this group underwent spontaneous activation and formed a single pronucleus without extruding pb2s. 89% of oocytes from "icsi" group did not undergo activation, despite the presence of the spermatozoon-derived chromatin in their cytoplasm.

are the oocytes fertilised during maturation able to respond with i transients to spermatozoa penetration in mii?
first we examined whether maturing oocytes were able to respond with i oscillations to the injection of spermatozoon. we found that 80% of injected oocytes generated repetitive i transients  . next we tested whether oocytes fertilised during maturation can respond with i rise after insemination at mii. we found that majority of the oocytes from "icsi + ivf" experimental variant generated ca2+ response after refertilisation  and half of them  generated 2– <dig> i spikes during first hour after sperm penetration  . the mean number of i transients was  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  . in "ivf" and "sham+ivf" control groups most of the oocytes produced at least  <dig> i transients . the mean number of i spikes in both control groups  was significantly higher than in "icsi+ivf" group  .

is the ip <dig> receptor downregulated in oocytes fertilised during maturation?
lower number of i transients observed in oocytes, which were fertilised during maturation and refertilised at mii could result from the ip <dig> receptor downregulation caused by introduction of spermatozoon into maturing oocyte. to test this possibility we compared the level of ip <dig> receptor between mii oocytes, which were or were not fertilised during maturation in vitro, by western blot technique. due to relatively low efficiency of icsi into maturing oocytes, in this experiment we used conventional ivf to introduce spermatozoa into oocytes.

we observed that in mii oocytes penetrated by a single spermatozoon during maturation in vitro, the level of ip <dig> receptor was lower than in uninseminated control oocytes .

do the oocytes fertilised during maturation have a lower level of mpf activity?
we found that oocytes fertilised during maturation and refertilised at mii underwent activation in spite of lower number of i transients accompanying refertilisation. there was a possibility that introduction of spermatozoon into maturing oocyte resulted in partial decline of the mpf activity that allowed oocyte to respond to a weaker activating stimulus. since mpf activity can be quantified using a histone h <dig> kinase assay  <cit> , we compared the level of histone h <dig> kinase activity between mii oocytes which were or were not fertilised during maturation in vitro. in this experiment we also used in vitro fertilisation instead of icsi to introduce spermatozoa into maturing oocyte

we found that the activity of histone h <dig> kinase in mii oocytes penetrated by a single spermatozoon during maturation in vitro and in uninseminated control oocytes was approximately the same .

discussion
oocytes fertilised during maturation can be activated after refertilisation in mii and can respond to spermatozoa with i transients
the ability of the oocyte to be activated by spermatozoa requires a calcium signalling system, which develops during oocyte maturation. in ovulated mature oocytes spermatozoa trigger i oscillations that result in oocyte activation  <cit> . one of the methods used to study how the ability of the oocyte to respond to activating spermatozoa develops during maturation, is the examination of the oocyte response to experimental, premature fertilization. it was demonstrated previously that immature oocytes are capable of producing i transients after penetration by spermatozoon, but they generate fewer i oscillations and cease oscillating earlier than mature oocytes  <cit> . in our present study we investigated whether oocytes that were fertilised by icsi during maturation, retain the ability to be activated when refertilised after the completion of the maturation. we also examined if they can respond to refertilisation with i oscillations. we have shown that mii oocytes, which were subjected to double fertilisation, are able to generate spermatozoa-induced i increase and to undergo activation. the frequency of their activation  was similar to the frequency of activation of oocytes that were fertilised only once, at mii stage. moreover, 50% of the oocytes, which were refertilised, reacted to the penetration by spermatozoa by generating  <dig> or  <dig> i transients. the fact that not all of refertilised oocytes which underwent activation generated i oscillations, should not be regarded as contradictory, since it is known that a monotonic rise in i is sufficient to activate aged oocytes  <cit> 

similar type of experiment was performed previously by tang et al.  <cit> . however, these authors microinjected mouse oocytes during maturation with bovine sperm extracts, rather than with whole spermatozoa. they demonstrated that such oocytes cannot generate i oscillations in response to second injection with the sperm extract performed after completion of maturation. these oocytes produced only a single i transient. we believe that the ca2+ response of refertilised oocytes observed in our experiments was closer to response of the oocyte during natural fertilisation than that observed by tang et al.  <cit>  in their experiments. this difference can be partially explained by the fact, that tang et al.  <cit>  injected oocytes with an amount of sperm extract which was an equivalent of approximately  <dig> –  <dig> spermatozoa/oocyte and we injected each oocyte with a single spermatozoon, which introduced a smaller amount of sperm-derived, oocyte-activating factor. studies examining the effect of polyspermy  <cit>  and the effect of different quantity of microinjected plcζ mrna  <cit>  on oocyte ca2+ response showed positive correlation between the quantity of sperm activating factor introduced and the frequency of i oscillations. it is possible that the introduction of larger than normal i.e., as it happens during monospermic fertlisation, quantity of sperm activating factor causes stronger than normal inactivation of ip <dig> receptors  <cit>  and in consequence lowers the oocyte ca2+ releasing ability and eliminates i oscillations. another reason for the discrepancy between our results and the observations made by tang et al.  <cit>  could be related to differences in the amounts of activating factor in spermatozoa of different species. it was demonstrated previously that protein extracts prepared from spermatozoa of different species induce i oscillations of untypical parameters in human  <cit>  and mouse  <cit>  oocytes. tang et al.  <cit>  used sperm extracts prepared from bovine spermatozoa to induce ca2+ response in mouse oocytes. there is a possibility that bovine sperm extract induces stronger stimulation, and in consequence, stronger inactivation of ip <dig> receptors than activating factor from a single mouse spermatozoon, and results in a weaker ca2+ response after repeated microinjection with sperm extract. thus the conclusion of tang et al.  <cit>  that i oscillations are dependent on the mechanism that functions only once in mouse oocytes and is abolished by sperm-derived oocyte-activating factor is probably applicable only to their experimental system and is not universally correct.

refertilisation of oocytes fertilised during maturation generates lower number i transients than in oocytes fertilised only once
we observed that at least some oocytes, which were refertilised, were able to generate more than one i transient as a reaction to penetration by spermatozoa. however, number of transients in these oocytes was significantly lower than in oocytes that were fertilised only once at mii. the most likely explanation of this observation is that oocytes, which were fertilised during maturation had a lower number of ip <dig> receptors present in er that normal mature oocytes. as it was already mentioned above, it was shown that ip <dig> receptors are downregulated after fertilisation by proteolytic degradation  <cit> . during fertilisation an intense production of ip <dig> is observed due to the activity of spermatozoon derived phospholipase cζ  <cit> . binding of ip <dig> to ip <dig> receptors causes ca2+ release and subsequently leads to the degradation of ip <dig> receptors by the proteasome  <cit> . the loss of ip <dig> receptors was also observed in immature oocytes upon penetration by spermatozoa, which demonstrates that degradation of ip <dig> receptors does not require the normal events associated with oocyte activation  <cit> . we also performed a preliminary experiment on the effect of the sperm penetration during maturation on the level of ip <dig> receptors in oocytes. we found that at mii stage oocytes fertilised during maturation had much less ip <dig> receptors than uninseminated control oocytes. the role of the degradation of ip <dig> receptors in regulation of i transients during fertilisation was demonstrated by brind et al.  <cit>  who exposed maturing oocytes to a potent ip <dig> receptor agonist adenophostin a. in these oocytes adenophostin caused downregulation of ip <dig> receptors to a greater extent than spermatozoa because its 100-fold greater potency than ip <dig> and its resistance to ip3-metabolising enzymes  <cit> . the oocyte response to the adenophostin was dose dependent: oocytes treated with low dose responded to fertilisation at mii stage with only one i transient and oocytes exposed during maturation to higher concentration of adenophostin had their ca2+ signalling completely abolished  <cit> . these results strongly support our conclusion that the downregulation of ip <dig> receptors in immature oocytes after icsi was responsible for the reduced i oscillations during refertilisation.

activation of refertilised oocytes, which were fertilised during maturation, does not result from the lower level of mpf activity
the increase of i that occurs during fertilisation leads to the degradation of m-phase cyclins and in consequence to the drop of the activity of mpf kinase and to the exit of oocytes from the mii block  <cit> . our present results demonstrate that refertilised oocytes undergo activation despite the lower, than in normal fertilization, number of i transients generated by refertilising spermatozoon. at first we suspected that fertilisation of oocytes during maturation could lower the level of mpf activity in these oocytes. however, we found that this was not the case; matured in vitro oocytes, which were fertilised during maturation had similar levels of mpf activity to those of unfertilized oocytes. thus, the mpf activity of mii oocyte that developed from the oocyte fertilised during maturation, is not affected by the premature fertilisation.

kubiak  <cit>  has shown that after ovulation, the mii oocytes gradually develop the ability for activation. soon after reaching mii stage  oocytes were able to be activated by the sperm, but not by the parthenogenetic factor , which is known to generate only a single i transient  <cit> . however, the activation of mii oocytes, which were isolated  <dig> –  <dig>  h after hcg, was induced with equal efficiency by i oscillations  and by a single i transient   <cit> . in our experiments mii oocytes, which completed maturation in vitro, were refertilised approximately  <dig> h after hcg, i.e at the time when prolonged i oscillations most likely are no longer necessary for full activation.

in summary, we have demonstrated that when maturing mouse oocytes were fertilised by icsi, they did not develop a membrane block to the polyspermy, and could be refertilised at mii. oocytes, which were refertilised underwent activation, extruded pb2s and formed pronuclei with similar frequency as control in vitro matured oocytes, which were fertilised only once at mii stage. activation after refertilisation was accompanied by ca2+ response, which in 50% of oocytes had a form of i oscillations. however, the number of i transients observed in refertilised mii oocytes was significantly lower than in oocytes fertilised only once at mii.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that in mouse oocytes the ca2+ signalling pathway that is responsible for generation of i oscillations during fertilisation and for activation of the oocyte, is not completely inactivated after premature penetration by spermatozoon. thus, we have shown that in mouse oocyte, the molecular mechanism, which is involved in oscillatory ca2+ response to fertilisation can be switched on more than once.
