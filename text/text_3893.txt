BACKGROUND
one consistent hallmark of human cancer genomes are somatically acquired genomic rearrangements, which may result in complex patterns of regional copy number changes  <cit> . these alterations have the potential to interrupt or activate multiple genes, and consequently have been implicated in cancer development  <cit> . analysis of genomic rearrangements is essential for understanding the biological mechanisms of oncogenesis and to determine rational points of pharmacological interference  <cit> . some large-scale efforts have been undertaken to correlate genomic rearrangements to genome architecture as well as to the progression dynamics of cancer genomes  <cit> . at the moment, the stepwise development of cancer with the gradual accumulation of multiple genetic alterations is the most widely accepted model  <cit> .

recently, using state-of-the-art genome analysis techniques, a phenomenon termed “chromothripsis” was characterized in cancer genomes, defined by the occurrence of tens to hundreds of clustered genomic rearrangements, having arisen in a single catastrophic event  <cit> . in this model, contiguous chromosomal regions are fragmented into many pieces, via presently unknown mechanisms. these segments are then randomly fused together by the cell’s dna repair machinery. it has been proposed that this “shattering” and aberrant repair of a multitude of dna fragments could provide an alternative oncogenetic route  <cit> , in contrast to the step-by-step paradigm of cancer development  <cit> . the initial study reported  <dig> chromothripsis cases, with some evidence of a high prevalence in bone tumors  <cit> .

besides human cancers, recent studies have also reported chromothripsis events in germline and non-human genomes  <cit> . however, due to the overall low incidence of this phenomenon, most studies were limited to relatively small numbers of observed events. for example, in a study screening  <dig> multiple myelomas by snp arrays, only  <dig> cases with chromothripsis-like genome patterns were detected  <cit> . larger sample numbers are required to gain further insights into features and mechanisms of these events in different cancers.

in contrast to a strict definition of chromothripsis events relying on sequencing based detection of specific genomic rearrangements  <cit> , other studies  <cit>  have described chromothripsis events based on genomic array analysis without support from whole genome sequencing data. overall, the minimal consensus of array based studies is the detection of a large number of locally clustered cna events. in table  <dig>  we provide an overview of studies which so far have reported instances of “chromothripsis” in human cancers  <cit> .

here, we present a statistical model for the discovery of clustered genomic aberration patterns, similar to those previously labeled as “chromothripsis” events, from genomic array data sets. for the scope of this article, we introduce the term “chromothripsis-like patterns”  when discussing those events.

applying our methodology to  <dig>  genomic arrays from  <dig> geo  derived experimental series  <cit> , we were able to detect  <dig> chromothripsis-like cases, and to determine the frequency and genomic distribution of ctlp events in this dataset. our collection of oncogenomic array data represents  <dig> cancer types as defined using the icd-o  <dig>  coding scheme, enabling us to estimate the incidence of ctlp in diverse tumor types. among the ctlp cases, varying distributions of fragmented chromosomal regions as well as an abundance of large non-ctlp copy number aberrations  regions were found, and the genomic context of chromothripsis-like events was investigated. finally, we evaluated clinical associations of ctlp cottoning samples, based on the clinical information at hand. overall, this study characterized heterogeneous features of chromothripsis-like events through a large-scale analysis of oncogenomic array data sets and provides a better understanding of clustered genomic copy number patterns in cancer development.

RESULTS
detection of chromothripsis-like patterns from oncogenomic arrays
we collected  <dig> geo series, encompassing  <dig>  high quality genomic arrays of human cancer samples. a procedure was employed to detect ctlp from these arrays . the annotated information of the arrays, including normalized probe intensity, segmentation data and quality evaluation, was obtained from our arraymap database  <cit>  . after removing technical repeats , a total of  <dig>  cases representing  <dig> cancer types remained. the input data is summarized, at array and case-level, respectively, in additional file 1: table s <dig> and additional file 2: table s <dig>  the segmentation data and array profiling can be accessed and visualized through the arraymap website .

according to previous studies, segmental copy number status changes and significant breakpoint clustering are two relevant features of chromothripsis  <cit> . for an automatic identification of ctlp, we developed a scan-statistic based algorithm  <cit> . we employed a maximum likelihood ratio score, which is commonly used to detect clusters of events in time and/or space and to determine their statistical significance  <cit>  . for each chromosome, the algorithm uses a series of sliding windows to identify the genomic region with the highest likelihood ratio as the ctlp candidate. in order to test the performance of the algorithm,  <dig> previously published chromothripsis cases with available raw array data were collected and used as a training set. this data contained  <dig> chromothriptic and  <dig> non-chromothriptic chromosomes that acted as positive and negative controls, respectively . comparison of copy number status change times and likelihood ratios showed that chromothriptic chromosomes could reliably be distinguished from non-chromothriptic ones . we generated a receiver operating characteristic  curve from the training set results, and selected cutoff values based on this curve  . furthermore, the sliding window scan statistic accurately identified the genomic regions involved . applying this algorithm to the complete input data set, a total of  <dig>  chromosomes from  <dig> cases passed our thresholds and were marked as ctlp events .

chromothripsis-like patterns across diverse tumor types
when evaluating the  <dig>  ctlp events, we found a pronounced preference for some chromosomes; this preference showed only limited association with chromosome size . ctlp occurred more frequently in chromosome  <dig> than in any other chromosome. this observation is in accordance with data reporting an association between chromothripsis and tp <dig> mutations in sonic-hedgehog medulloblastoma and acute myeloid leukemia  <cit> . tp <dig> is located in the p arm of chromosome  <dig>  and is involved in cell cycle control, genome maintenance and apoptosis  <cit> . our dataset showed tp <dig> losses in  <dig> out of  <dig>  ctlp cases, compared to  <dig>  out of  <dig>   cases in the non-ctlp group .  <dig> of the  <dig> tp <dig> deletions were part of a ctlp, confirming tp <dig> mutation as a recurring event with possible involvement in ctlp formation. other chromosomes with relatively high incidences of ctlp included chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

in our study, genomic projection of regional ctlp frequencies revealed their heterogeneous distribution in different cancer types . the total length of fragmented genomic regions  accounted for 1%-14% of the corresponding genomes . the large size of our input data set, resulting in high number of ctlp cases, permitted an investigation of the frequency and genomic distribution of these patterns in different cancer types. our input samples represented  <dig> “diagnostic groups”, as defined by a combination of icd-o morphology and topography codes. the majority of samples  came from  <dig> diagnostic groups, each represented by more than  <dig> arrays. we observed in total of  <dig> ctlp events across all  <dig>  cases, representing an overall ~ 5% prevalence. the  <dig> diagnostic groups represented by at least  <dig> cases, and having frequencies higher than 4%  are listed in table  <dig> .

only cancer types with input cases ≥  <dig> and frequency ≥ 4% are shown.

the initial study by stephens et al. hypothesized that chromothripsis has a high incidence in bone tumors  <cit> . notably, several soft tissue tumor types appeared in our “ctlp high” frequency set , including the  <dig> types with the highest scores. moreover, the high prevalence of ctlp in soft tissue tumors was reflected in the icd-o specific frequencies . the genesis and/or effect of multiple localized chromosomal breakage-fusion events may be related to specific molecular mechanisms in those tumor types. notably, gene fusions are well-documented recurring events in sarcomas  <cit> , in contrast to most other solid tumors, and a local clustering of genomic re-arrangements had been previously reported for liposarcomas  <cit> . so far, more than  <dig> fusion genes have been recognized in sarcomas and treated as potential diagnostic and prognostic markers  <cit> . possibly, the double-strand breaks and random fragment stitching events in chromothripsis-like events promote the generation of oncogenic fusion genes  <cit> . further sequencing-based efforts will be needed to identify the true extent of fusion gene generation and to elucidate their functional impact in chromothripsis-like cases.

genomic context of chromothripsis-like events
it has been hypothesized that chromothripsis is a one-off cellular crisis generating a malignant clone in a very short time  <cit> . however, in many of the ctlp samples in our study, highly fragmented chromosomal regions were embedded in larger cna regions showing variations in patterns and overall extent . to test whether ctlp generating events are associated with overall genomic instability, we examined the extent of all copy number imbalances detected in our dataset. comparing the  <dig> ctlp positive arrays with the remainder of  <dig>  ctlp negative arrays, we found that ctlp samples tended to have higher proportions of cna coverage in their genomes  . this indicated that chromothripsis-like events frequently co-occur with other types of copy number aberrations. plausible and non-exclusive explanations could be that ctlp might frequently arise due to previously established errors in the maintenance of genomic stability, or that chromothriptic aberrations involving genomic maintenance genes may predispose to the acquisition of additional cna. for those frequent cases exhibiting additional non-ctlp cna events, their possible contribution to oncogenesis has to be considered when modeling the role of chromothripsis-like events in cancer development.

potential mechanisms for chromosome shattering
while the mechanism responsible for the generation of chromothripsis remain elusive, a number of studies have proposed hypotheses including ionizing radiation  <cit> , dna replication stress  <cit> , breakage-fusion-bridge cycles  <cit> , premature chromosome compaction  <cit> , failed apoptosis  <cit>  and micronuclei formation  <cit> . some of these proposed mechanisms are associated with features which could be addressed in our study.

in our dataset, although most  ctlp cases presented single chromosome ctlp events, in approximately 24% ctlp affected at least  <dig> chromosomes . for certain candidate mechanisms, e.g. micro-nucleus formation due to mitotic delay, this observation would imply more than one event, whereas the observation appears compatible with e.g. an aborted apoptosis process.

for relating to cytogenetic aberration mechanisms, an additional parameter explored by us was the extent of ctlp regions when normalized to their respective chromosomes. affected regions were classified into the categories “arm-level” , “chromosome-level”  or “localized” . arm-level ctlp events were observed with a relatively high frequency . in the arm-level patterns, the ctlp rearrangements were concentrated in one chromosome arm, with the other arm of the same chromosome remaining normal or showing isolated cna. since arm-level events involve both peri-centromeric and telomeric regions, cytogenetic events involving these chromosomal structures present themselves as possible causative mechanisms.

notably, one model that closely conforms to this pattern involves breakage-fusion-bridge cycles  <cit> . in general, such cycles start with telomere loss and end-to-end chromosome fusions. when the dicentric chromosomes are formed and pulled to opposite poles during anaphase, a double-strand dna break acts as starting point for the next cycle. chromosomal rearrangements would gradually accumulate during the additional cycles, and should be concentrated in one chromosome arm, particularly near the affected telomere. in our dataset, up to 44% of all ctlp chromosomes involved telomere regions. we performed simulations to explore whether this telomere enrichment could be explained by chance. in brief, for each sample, we retained the location of ctlp region in the genome and shuffled the telomere position of each chromosome while keeping the length of each chromosome constant. in contrast to the actual observations, the simulation did not result in telomeric ctlp enrichment . ctlp generation through breakage-fusion-bridge cycles would be a viable candidate hypothesis compatible both with the statistically significant telomere enrichment and the high proportion of arm-level pulverization. however, for arm-level ctlp events centromere-related instability mechanisms should also be considered for future discussions.

clinical implications
based on clinical associations of “chromothripsis” patterns, it has been claimed that these events may correlate with a poor outcome in the context of the respective tumor type  <cit> . in our meta-analysis, we explored a general relation of ctlp with clinical parameters, across the wide range of cancer entities reflected in our input data set. clinical data was collected from geo and from the publications of the respective series  and parameters available for at least  <dig>  cases were considered. from our dataset, ctlp seemed to occur at a more advanced patient age as compared to non-ctlp samples   <cit> . ctlp mainly occurred at stage ii and iii , which was significantly different from the stage distribution of total samples   . no difference of grade distribution was observed in our dataset  where ctlp samples showed a predominance for grades  <dig> and  <dig>  similar to the bulk of all samples . we also found that ctlp was overrepresented in cell lines compared to primary tumors .

for a subset of  <dig>  patients, we were able to determine basic follow-up parameters . for  <dig> of these individuals, ctlp was detected in their tumor genomes. notably, patients with ctlp survived a significantly shorter time than those without this phenomenon . note that this analysis was based on a sample of convenience averaged over cancers, stages and grades. if we break down this dataset by cancer type, the numbers are not large enough to provide statistical confidence . while the cancer type independent association of ctlp patterns and poor outcome is intriguing, potential clinical effects of chromothripsis-like genome disruption should be evaluated in larger and clinically more homogeneous data sets.

sensitivity of array platforms for detection of chromothripsis-like patterns
presumed chromothripsis events have been reported from genomic datasets generated through different array and sequencing based techniques . we performed an analysis of the platform distribution of our ctlp samples, to estimate the detection bias among various genomic array platforms. as the resolution of a platform depends both on type and density of the probes on an array, we divided the platforms into  <dig> groups according to their probe numbers and techniques . although ctlp were detected by all types of genomic arrays, a higher fraction of ctlp samples was found using data from high resolution oligonucleotide arrays , possibly due to increased sensitivity related to higher probe density. indeed, when performing platform simulations, the sensitivity of ctlp detection improved with increasing probe numbers . according to these simulations, array platforms consisting of more than 250 k probes should be preferred when screening for ctlp events. since our analysis relied on a variety of array platforms, we can assume that the overall prevalence of ctlp in cancer is higher than our reported 5% of samples.

discussion
the description of the “chromothripsis” phenomenon has initiated a vital discussion about clustered genomic aberration events and their role in cancer development  <cit> . while chromothripsis senso stricto has been characterized as a type of focally clustered genomic aberrations generated in a one time cellular event and being limited to a defined set of copy number states  <cit> , other operational definitions have been employed based on clustered aberrations  <cit> . it seems likely that some of the previous discussions of “chromothripsis” referred to a number of underlying event types, all resulting in localized genome fragmentation and re-assembly events. for instance, dna double strand break and end-joining-mediated repair may result in a restricted number of copy number levels, whereas aberrant replication based mechanisms will lead to a more diverse set of copy number aberrations  <cit> . here, we introduce the term “chromothripsis-like patterns”  when referring to clustered genomic events, to accommodate both common labelling and presumed biological variability of clustered genomic copy number aberrations.

at this time, due to the lack of sufficiently large number of cancer data sets from whole-genome sequencing analyses, a meta-analysis of “strict” chromothripsis cases is not feasible. we have followed a pragmatic approach to quantify the occurrence of ctlp from genomic array data sets. in our algorithm, we implemented the two most significant features shared by different operational chromothripsis definitions, namely copy number status changes and breakpoints clustering, which can be well measured by array based technologies. previous studies provided various algorithms to detect “chromothripsis” events  <cit> . however, besides its application to an extensive data set, the specific advantage of our method presented here is its ability to detect regions of shattering with limited influence from the varying sizes of affected chromosomes. since the step length of our scanning window is 5 mb, theoretically the detected ctlp regions are within an accuracy of ±5 mb. note that the performance of this algorithm may be influenced by poor quality arrays, especially those with highly scattered and unevenly distributed probe signal intensities.

in this study, we identified  <dig> ctlp-containing genome profiles, based on an analysis of copy number aberration patterns from  <dig>  oncogenomic arrays and representing  <dig> cancer types. despite the inherent limitations of such a meta-analysis approach, we were able to provide several new insights regarding the distribution of clustered genomic copy number aberrations and to produce a comprehensive estimate of ctlp incidence in a large range of cancer entities.

in our analysis, ctlp exhibited an uneven distribution along tumor genomes, with disease related local enrichment. these “ctlp dense” chromosomal regions may reveal associations between disease related cancer associated genes and molecular mechanisms behind genome shattering events. this potential correlation is exemplified by the prevalence of mutant tp <dig> in “chromothriptic” li-fraumeni syndrome associated sonic-hedgehog medulloblastomas  <cit> . as the extent of ctlp related deletions of the tp <dig> locus indicates, ctlp related gene dosage changes may predispose to double-hit effects on specific tumor suppressors. in contrast, we found regional enrichment for ctlp with pre-dominant copy number gains on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in the initial study, chromosome  <dig> shattering was found in a small cell lung cancer cell line  <cit> . this event contained the myc oncogene, which had be shown to be amplified in 10-20% of small cell lung cancers  <cit> . moreover, strong overexpression of myc involved in a “chromothripsis” region was also detected in a neuroblastoma sample  <cit> . in a study of colorectal tumors, chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> were involved in concurrent pulverization events with generation of fusion genes, involving e.g. saps <dig> and zfp <dig> <cit> . in a study on hepatocellular carcinoma, ccnd <dig> amplification was embedded within a “chromothriptic” event on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . therefore, the overall uneven distribution of ctlp may point to specific driver mutations that contribute to ctlp generation, and/or to a class of cancer promoting mutations based on regional genome shattering events.

when comparing cancer types, we observed a high ctlp prevalence in a limited set of entities, particularly among soft tissue tumors. this finding supports and improves upon a previous prediction of particularly high “chromothripsis” rate in bone tumors  <cit> . also, the uneven distribution of ctlp is a strong indicator for a disease related selection of specific genomic aberrations, supporting their involvement in the oncogenetic process.

in the initial study, the authors stated that chromothripsis could be a one-off cataclysmic event that generates multiple concurrent mutations and rearrangements  <cit> . however, the role of chromothripsis in terms of “shortcut” to cancer genome generation is still elusive. we note that additional and complex non-ctlp genome re-arrangements exist in the majority of ctlp samples. the number and uneven distribution of affected chromosomes in ctlp supports the biological heterogeneity of cancer samples with ctlp containing genome profiles. furthermore, the normalized spatial distribution of shattered chromosomal regions, as well as the observed significant overlap between telomere and pulverized regions is supportive of breakage-fusion-bridge cycles as one of the mechanisms acting in a subset of samples. further efforts are needed to investigate the temporal order of chromothripsis and non-chromothripsis events in complex samples, and to substantiate the existence of a dichotomy between “one-off” chromothripsis and other classes of localized genome shattering events, all resulting in clustered genomic copy number aberrations.

in our associated clinical data, ctlp were related to more advanced tumor stages and overall worse prognosis when compared to non-ctlp cases. one possible explanation is that the numerous concurrent genetic alterations induced by genome shattering events disturb a large number of genes and contribute to more aggressive tumor phenotypes. by themselves, these observations do not differentiate whether ctlp arise as a early events promoting aggressive tumor behavior with fast growth rates and reduced response rates to therapeutic interventions; or whether this observation relates to underlying primary mutations predisposing to genomic instability, aggressive clinical behavior and ctlp as a resulting epiphenomenon. interestingly, the high rate of tp <dig> involvement by itself would support both possibilities for this gene, i.e. chromothripsis as result of tp <dig> mutation as well as chromothriptic events with tp <dig> locus involvement promoting an aggressive clinical behavior.

from table  <dig> we may notice that the array based technologies are, in general, less sensitive than whole-genome sequencing data for calling chromothripsis-like events. this is partly due to the very limited ability of most array platforms to detect balanced genomic aberrations, such as inversions and translocation events. in the future, the accumulation of large-scale sequencing data should be able to provide further insights into localise genome shattering events.

CONCLUSIONS
ctlp represent a striking feature occurring in a limited set of cancer genomes, and can be detected from array based copy number screening experiments, using biostatistical methods. the observed clustered genomic copy number aberrations may reflect heterogenous biological phenomena beyond a single class of “chromothripsis” events, and probably vary in their specific impact on oncogenesis. fragmentation hotspots derived from our large-scale data set could promote the detection of markers associated with genome shattering, or may be used for assigning disease related effects to ctlp-induced genomic events.
