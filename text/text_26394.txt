BACKGROUND
the domestic silkworm, bombyx mori , is an economically important insect in countries such as china, brazil and india. for thousands of years, silk produced by domestic silkworms has been a widely sought fair textile material. b. mori was domesticated from the chinese wild silkworm, bombyx mandarina, approximately 5000 years ago  <cit> . long-term artificial breeding and selection have resulted in high silk yield in domestic silkworms compared with the silk yield in its wild relative  <cit> . however, little is known about the genetic mechanisms of increased silk yield in the domestic silkworm  <cit> .

the silk proteins  are produced by silk glands. the gland is divided into three compartments: anterior silk gland , median silk gland , and posterior silk gland . asgs serve as ducts to transport the silk proteins in the final secretion process  <cit> . psgs are responsible for the synthesis and secretion of fibroins, which are composed of a heavy chain   <cit> , a light chain , and p <dig>  with a molar ratio of 6:6: <dig>  <cit> . msgs synthesize the glue proteins , which are composed of seven major sericins that are encoded by three main genes, ser <dig>  ser <dig>  and ser <dig>  <cit> . thus, silk proteins are biosynthesized in the msgs and psgs. silk threads comprise approximately 75% insoluble fibrous proteins in the inner layer and 25% hydrophilic glue sericin proteins in the outer layer  <cit> .

to understand the tissue specificity and functional diversification, the silk gland transcriptome in domestic silkworm has been investigated in previous studies  <cit> . expressed sequence tags were sequenced in the psgs on days  <dig> and  <dig> of fifth-instar larvae  <cit> . differential gene expression patterns between anterior/median silk glands  and psgs were examined on day  <dig> of fifth-instar larvae  <cit> . based on serial analysis of gene expression -aided transcriptome analysis, the gene expression profiles of msgs and psgs have also been compared  <cit> . these studies suggested that the expression levels of most of the protein-coding genes were similar in the msgs and psgs of the domestic silkworm, while, as expected, mrnas encoding the fibroins and sericins showed differential expression patterns.

previous studies have focused mainly on the silk gland transcriptome in domestic silkworms. however, there seems to be no study on the silk gland transcriptome in b. mandarina, the wild relative of the domestic silkworm. here, we sequenced the transcriptomes of silk glands from day  <dig> of fifth-instar larvae of two domestic and two wild silkworms using the illumina sequencing technology. the goal of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes  in domestic versus wild silkworms, to help understand the molecular mechanism associated with the difference in silk production between domestic silkworm and its wild ancestor b. mandarina.

RESULTS
rna-sequencing and identification of novel transcripts
to explore differences in the silk gland transcriptomes between domestic and wild silkworms, two domestic strains, chunhua  and chunyu , and two wild silkworms were selected for analysis. the wild silkworms w_akbh and w_aksq were collected from the baihe and shiquan counties of ankang city, shaanxi province, respectively. intact silk glands were dissected on day  <dig> of fifth-instar larvae and were found to present similar anatomy structures in the four silkworm . for each silkworm, the rna from the median/posterior silk glands  from five female and five male larvae was sequenced using an illumina genome analyzer . an overview of the sequencing and assembly is outlined in table  <dig>  additional file 1: table s <dig>  after quality control, the number of clean bases in the d_ch, d_cy, w_akbh and w_aksq transcriptome libraries were  <dig>  gb,  <dig>  gb,  <dig>  gb and  <dig>  gb, respectively . we mapped the clean reads to the b. mori reference genome, release_ <dig>   <cit> . the proportion of total reads in the four silkworm transcriptome libraries that mapped to the genome ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> % .figure  <dig>

all the mapped reads from the four silkworms were merged and assembled by cufflinks  <cit> . the known silkworm gene models from silkdb  were corrected and novel transcripts were characterized using cuffcompare. a total of  <dig>  new transcripts were detected . locations of exons and introns from each novel gene are also defined. the  <dig>  new transcripts was detected by blastn against the silkworm transcriptome database , which included transcriptomes from eggs, ant worm and whole body at different developmental stages  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  genes could be found corresponding transcripts in silktransdb . all the new transcripts were used to do blastx search against the protein non-redundant  database . only  <dig> genes had no corresponding homologs in nr database . we analyzed the gene ontology  classifications of all the  <dig>  novel genes . a total of  <dig> genes were assigned to corresponding go terms.

transcriptome profiles of the silk glands from four silkworms
the abundance of all the genes  was normalized and calculated by the reads per kilo bases per million reads  method using uniquely mapped reads   <cit> . genes with rpkms in the interval 0– <dig> were considered not to be expressed or to be present at very low levels; genes with rpkms over  <dig> were considered to be expressed at a very high level. the distributions of the expression levels of all the genes were similar for all four silkworms . we found that about 58% of the total number of genes  were expressed , and more than  <dig>  genes were highly expressed  in each silkworm . we analyzed the correlation between the topology and biological function of the highly expressed genes using the go classifications . in the molecular function category, the most abundant go terms were “binding”  and “catalytic activity” . we found that eight genes, bgibmga <dig>  bgibmga <dig>  bgibmga <dig>  bgibmga <dig>  bgibmga <dig>  bgibmga <dig> and bgibmga <dig>  were extremely highly expressed  in the silk glands of all four silkworms. these genes either encode silk proteins or play roles in the synthesis of proteins. for example, bgibmga <dig>  bgibmga <dig>  bgibmga <dig> and bgibmga <dig> correspond to fib-h, fib-l, p <dig> and ser <dig>  these results are consistent with the efficient biosynthesis of silk proteins in the silk glands.figure  <dig>

differentially expressed genes in the silk glands
to identify the degs among the four silkworms, the read counts were adjusted using the edger program  <cit>  with one scaling normalized factor. degs between any two silkworms were identified using the degseq r package  <cit> . a corrected p-value of  <dig>  and log <dig> fold-change of ± <dig> were set as the threshold for significant differential expression. all the degs are presented in additional file 6: table s <dig>  to observe the gene expression patterns, we performed hierarchical clustering of all the degs based on the log <dig> rpkms for the four silkworms .figure  <dig>

the distributions of the numbers of degs across the four silkworms are shown in figure 3b and c. we found  <dig> degs between two domestic strains , and  <dig> degs between the wild silkworms . only  <dig> genes showed common differential expressions in comparisons of d_ch vs d_cy and w_akbh vs w_aksq , implying that most of degs between the two domestic silkworm strains were different from the degs between the two wild silkworms. as shown in figure 3b, the numbers of degs between the domestic and wild silkworms ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  the  <dig> overlapped genes might be the candidate degs in domestic versus wild silkworms . however, some of the  <dig> genes showed expression differences within the domestic silkworms or within the wild silkworms and were excluded from the further analysis. thus, the remaining  <dig> genes were selected as the major degs in domestic versus wild silkworms.

based on the transcriptome expression data , the expression patterns of the  <dig> candidate degs in wild versus domestic silkworms are presented in figure 4a. sixteen of these genes were up-regulated in the domestic silkworms and  <dig> were up-regulated in the wild silkworms. four genes, bgibmga <dig>  bgibmga <dig>  bgibmga <dig>  and novel <dig>  showed no or very low expressions  in the domestic silkworms, while novel <dig> had no or very low expression in the wild silkworms . based on the genome-wide microarray data of the domestic silkworm published previously  <cit> , we surveyed the expressions of the  <dig> degs in multiple tissues from day  <dig> of fifth-instar larvae  and found that most of these degs were expressed in other tissues as well as in the silk glands .figure  <dig>

go and kegg enrichment analyses of the differentially expressed genes
a total of  <dig>  unique genes matched known proteins in the ncbi nr database and in interpro  by blast searches and  <dig>  of these genes were annotated with go terms. the go terms were converted to the generic go slim terms using blast2go  <cit> . to analyze the gene functions of the degs, a go enrichment analysis was performed using fisher’s exact test in blast2go. go terms with corrected p-value <  <dig>  were considered significantly enriched among the degs.

the go functional enrichment analysis of the  <dig> degs between the two wild silkworms revealed significantly enriched terms in the biological process and molecular function categories . metabolic process  with  <dig> genes was dominant in the biological process category and protein binding  with six genes was dominant in molecular function category. in the analysis of the  <dig> degs between the domestic silkworm strains, oxidoreductase activity  with  <dig> genes was the only significantly enriched term. these results suggested that there may be more differences in protein synthesis events between wild silkworms than between domestic silkworms. oxidoreductase activity was the only commonly enriched term related to the degs in four pairwise comparisons between the wild and domestic silkworms .

kegg pathway enrichment analysis was done using kobas  <dig>   <cit> . we found that the protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway was significantly enriched  for the degs between the two wild silkworms . two over-represented pathways, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and fatty acid metabolism, were also identified for the degs in the two domestic silkworm strains. in the four pairwise comparisons between the wild and domestic silkworms, except w_aksq vs d_cy, the glycine, serine and threonine metabolism pathway was significantly enriched for the degs. we also found seven degs for w_aksq vs d_cy that were related to glycine, serine and threonine metabolism; however, the pathway was not found to be significantly enriched .figure  <dig>

based on the go and kegg enrichment analyses, we sorted the  <dig> candidate degs into corresponding functional categories and pathways. bgibmga <dig> and bgibmga <dig> were predicted to play roles in mediating transformation of serine to glycine in the glycine, serine and threonine metabolism pathway. a previous study revealed that glycine and serine were the major amino acid residues in the silk fibroin heavy chain  <cit> ; thus, the differential expressions of these two genes might affect the amino acid composition of fibroins in wild silkworms. interestingly, seven of the  <dig> up-regulated genes in the wild silkworms were assigned the go term “oxidoreductase activity”, which is associated with antioxidant systems. we also manually annotated the  <dig> degs and proposed functions based on their homologous proteins identified in blast searches . five of the up-regulated degs in the wild silkworms were found to be involved in immune response, suggesting that these degs may play roles in the silkworms’ response to pathogens and environmental conditions. some of the up-regulated degs in domestic silkworms were predicted to be related to tissue development , excretion of proteins , and metabolism  , suggesting that these degs may be involved in the highly efficient biosynthesis and secretion of silk proteins.table  <dig>

validation of rna-seq data by quantitative real-time pcr
to validate the rna-seq data, qpcr was performed for  <dig> degs that we randomly selected from domestic versus wild silkworms transcriptome data. the selected genes were found to show differential expressions between the domestic and wild silkworms, and no significant difference between the two wild silkworms or two domestic silkworms. as shown in figure  <dig> and additional file 8: table s <dig>  the qpcr expression results were similar to the results obtained from the illumina sequencing data . that is, the fold changes in gene expression determined by qpcr were basically consistent with their transcript abundance changes determined by rna-seq, which confirmed the validity of the expression data. only two of the  <dig> selected degs showed significant expression differences  between the two wild silkworms  and between the two domestic silkworm strains .figure  <dig> 
quantitative real-time pcr validation of the differentially expressed genes. the relative expression of a candidate gene was normalized against rpl <dig>  for the up-regulated degs in the domestic silkworms, the fold-change of each gene was calculated by dividing the relative expression level in the w_aksq. for the up-regulated degs in the wild silkworms, the fold-change of each gene was calculated by dividing the relative expression level in the d_ch. the data are the average ± standard error of three independent replicated qpcr experiments. an absolute value of fold-change ≥  <dig> and one-way analysis of variance analysis  were used to estimate the significance of gene expression changes. significant differential expressions of genes between any two silkworms were marked by a star.



discussion
the cocoons of domestic silkworms are much larger than those of wild silkworms  <cit>  and the silk production of domestic silkworms is nearly 3-fold that of wild silkworms. for example, the cocoon shell weights of w_akbh, w_aksq, d_ch and d_cy were  <dig>  g,  <dig>  g,  <dig>  g and  <dig>  g, respectively. characterization of a transcriptome can help explain the functional complexity of a genome and reveal cell activities like growth, development and immune response. here, we compared the silk gland transcriptomes from the wild and domestic silkworms with the aim of obtaining useful information for understanding the biosynthesis and secretion of the silk proteins.

to help understand protein synthesis and development in the silk gland, degs in domestic versus wild silkworms were identified . we characterized  <dig> degs,  <dig> of which were up-regulated in domestic silkworms . we manually annotated the functions of these  <dig> degs, and found that some of them were related to tissue development, excretion of proteins, and metabolism . for example, we predicted that novel <dig> might encode an ubiquitin-activating enzyme that could initiate the ubiquitination of proteins  <cit> . ubiquitination is an essential process that regulates the turnover of proteins for basic cellular processes such as the cell cycle and cell death  <cit> . bgibmga <dig> was predicted to encode synaptic vesicle protein 2b , which is a vesicle protein present in the secretory vesicles and is an important regulator of ca2+-stimulated vesicle exocytosis  <cit> . secretory vesicles have also been found in the silk gland of the domestic silkworm  <cit> . bgibmga <dig>  was up-regulated more than 256-fold in d_ch and 46-fold in d_cy compared with its expression in the wild silkworms . sv2b might mediate the release of neurotransmitter and regulate secretion of silk proteins in the silk gland. bgibmga <dig> was predicted to encode translocase subunit seca, which might play role in pushing substrates forward like a “motor”  <cit> . the sec translocase pathway is ubiquitous and is responsible for the vast majority of protein export activities  <cit> . thus, the up-regulated degs in silk glands of the domestic silkworms might be associated with the highly efficient biosynthesis and secretion of the silk proteins.

fibroins have been found to be the major components  of silk threads  <cit> . in the present study, we found that the fib-h, fib-l, and p <dig> were extremely highly expressed and showed similar expression levels in both the domestic and wild silkworms . initially, it was difficult to understand the obvious differences in silk production between domestic and wild silkworms; however, by combining our results with previously reported findings, we propose two possible explanations for this anomaly. in the transcriptome analysis, we concentrated only on protein-coding genes, while it has been reported that micrornas  may play regulatory functions in the silk protein synthesis  <cit> . mirnas play important roles in a broad range of biological processes, including down-regulating the translation of target genes to proteins  <cit> , inhibiting translation initiation, and mediating mrna decay  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  mirnas have been identified in the psgs in fifth-instar larvae of the silkworm using next-generation sequencing and microarray assay  <cit>  and the fibroin encoding genes fib-h, fib-l, and p <dig> have been reported to be the targets of some mirnas  <cit> . because we found that the expression levels of the fibroin genes were similar in domestic and wild silkworms, we propose that mirnas might be involved in the down-regulation of fibroin synthesis in the wild silkworms. another possible explanation is, because silk fibroins are synthesized in psg cells then secreted into the psg lumen and aggregated in the msg  <cit> , if the synthesized silk proteins are not secreted rapidly, their biosynthesis might be inhibited by the accumulated silk proteins. in the domestic silkworms, the up-regulated genes related to secretion  might promote the secretion of silk proteins for the continued synthesis of new proteins. thus, highly efficient biosynthesis and secretion may be associated with higher silk production in the domestic silkworms.

sixteen up-regulated degs were found in the wild silkworms compared with the domestic silkworms; seven of them were related to the go term “oxidoreductase activity”  and a further six were related to immune response or detoxification . for example, laccase  and dopa decarboxylase  take part in the melanization cascade, which has been proposed to play roles in the immune response of insects  <cit> . in b. mori, serine protease inhibitor  <dig>  may be involved in resistance to pathogenic microorganisms  <cit> . in manduca sexta, laccase may play an important role in the oxidation of toxic compounds in the diet  <cit> . interestingly, bgibmga <dig> is thought to be associated with domestication  <cit> , and we found that it was up-regulated more than 46-fold in the wild silkworms . bgibmga <dig> encodes an organic cation transporter, which might mediate the transport of a variety of endogenous compounds and numerous drugs and xenobiotics  <cit> . wild silkworms live in a more natural niche than domestic silkworms and therefore are likely to encounter more xenobiotics and pathogenic microorganisms than domestic silkworms. thus, the up-regulated degs in the wild silkworms may play important roles in dealing with xenobitics and pathogens in the natural environment.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study represents a significant step in the characterization of silk gland transcriptomes and provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of silk production. the transcriptome comparisons revealed that degs associated with immune response and detoxification were up-regulated in the wild silkworms, which is consistent with their exposure to more pathogens and xenobitics in the natural environment than the domestic silkworms. in the domestic silkworms, degs that may be associated with highly efficient biosynthesis and secretion of silk proteins were up-regulated. however, further research is required to determine whether these degs are the genes responsible for the difference in silk production between domestic and wild silkworms. further functional exploration of these genes may provide evidence for their future application in sericulture.
