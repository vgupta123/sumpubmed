BACKGROUND
bovine mastitis is the most costly disease for the dairy industry worldwide. although a wide variety of pathogens have been isolated as causative agents of this disease, staphylococcus aureus  is considered as one of the most important pathogens due to its resistance to certain antibiotics and its propensity to recur chronically. recently, coagulase-negative staphylococci  have been considered as opportunistic pathogens that cause bovine mastitis in many countries and could be therefore described as emerging mastitis pathogens  <cit> . increasing attention has been paid to cons in both subclinical and clinical mastitis cases throughout the world  <cit> . macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin  antibiotics, including erythromycin, clindamycin and spiramycin, are frequently used for treatment of bovine mastitis  <cit> . thus, results from an in vitro susceptibility testing are an important tool to guide a veterinarian in selecting the most efficacious antimicrobial agent for therapeutic and prophylactic intervention.

three mechanisms are mainly responsible for acquiring resistance to mls antibiotics in staphylococci:  target site modifications by methylation or mutation;  active efflux of antibiotics; or  inactivation of antibiotics. the first mechanism includes target site modifications by a methylase encoded by one or more of the erm genes, methylating 23s rrna and thereby altering binding sites for mls antibiotics  <cit> . phenotypically, this resistance appears either inducible  or constitutive   <cit> . the second mechanism involves a macrolide efflux pump encoded by msr and/or msr genes. this pump protein belongs to the abc transporter family and exports 14-membered macrolides and streptogramin b antibiotics from bacterial cells, while lincosamide and streptogramin a antibiotics remain unaffected   <cit> . the third mechanism encompasses several enzymes. a lincosamide nucleotidyltransferase encoded by the lnu gene confers resistance only to lincosamides and has been detected in cons isolates from bovine mastitis  <cit> . esterases encoded by ere/ genes hydrolyze the lactone ring of the macrocyclic nucleus  <cit> . furthermore, vga/ genes have been characterized as a determinant of streptogramin a resistance  <cit> . finally, the macrolide phosphotransferase c encoded by the mph gene inactivates some macrolide antibiotics and has been detected in cons isolated from bovine subclinical mastitis  <cit> .

the reported resistance of s. aureus and cons isolated from bovine mastitis to mls antibiotics in different countries was generally low  <cit> . meanwhile, there was a paucity of data regarding mls-resistance phenotypes and genotypes of s. aureus and cons isolated from bovine mastitis in china, except one study  <cit> . the objective of this study was to determine the mls resistance phenotypes and genotypes of 121 s. aureus and  <dig> cons isolates from mastitic milk from dairy farms of the shaanxi province in northwestern china.

methods
bacterial isolates
milk samples were obtained from dairy cows with clinical mastitis under the ethical approval granted by the college of animal science and technology, the northwest agriculture and forestry  university , as described previously  <cit> . a total of  <dig> coagulase-positive s. aureus  and  <dig> coagulase-negative staphylococci  were used in this study. cons species were identified by sequencing analyses based on soda and/or gap genes  <cit> . ninety-seven cons isolates encompassed  <dig> cons species: staphylococcus haemolyticus , staphylococcus aureus , staphylococcus chromogenes , staphylococcus sciuri , staphylococcus epidermidis , staphylococcus simulans , staphylococcus hyicus , staphylococcus warneri  and staphylococcus saprophyticus .

antibiotic susceptibility testing
minimum inhibitory concentrations  of antimicrobial agents, including 14-membered , 15-membered , 13- and 15-membered mixture  and 16-membered  macrolides, lincosamides  and streptogramins  were determined using an agar dilution method. clindamycin, azithromycin, tulathromycin and spiramycin were purchased from dalian meilun biology technology co., ltd. . tylosin was purchased from shanghai kai yang biotechnology co., ltd. . erythromycin was bought from sigma-aldrich  and quinupristin/dalfopristin was obtained from santa cruz biotechnology, inc. . the approved veterinary specific clsi mic breakpoints of erythromycin and clindamycin are ≥ 8 μg/ml and 4 μg/ml, respectively  <cit> . mic breakpoint for spiramycin  was adopted from the swedish antibiotic utilisation and resistance in human medicine  and swedish veterinary antimicrobial resistance monitoring  system   <cit> . the mic breakpoint for tylosin  was based on the veterinary antimicrobial decision support  according to a previous study  <cit> . there were no veterinary specific clsi, vads or swedres-svarm-approved breakpoints for azithromycin and quinupristin-dalfopristin. therefore, we used a human specific clsi document m100-s <dig>  <cit>  as a reference to determine breakpoints for azithromycin  and quinupristin-dalfopristin . in addition, there was no clsi, vads or svarm-approved breakpoint for tulathromycin. the standard reference strain s. aureus atcc  <dig> served as a quality control in every test run.

detection of mls resistance phenotypes
in order to differentiate different types of resistance phenotype for erythromycin-resistant  isolates, a double-disk diffusion test  was performed with erythromycin  and clindamycin , following the procedure recommended by clsi  <cit> . staphylococcal isolates showing resistance to erythromycin  but being sensitive to clindamycin  and producing a d-shaped zone of inhibition around clindamycin with flattening towards erythromycin disc was defined as having an inducible type of mls resistance . in addition, resistance to erythromycin  as well as to clindamycin  indicated a constitutive type of mls resistance . staphylococcal isolates showing resistance to erythromycin  while being sensitive to clindamycin  with no blunting zone were classified as the ms phenotype.

detection of mls resistance genotypes
staphylococcal isolates were incubated in the brain heart infusion broth  at 37 °c for 16-18 h. then, bacteria were harvested by centrifugation. plasmid and chromosome dna of bacterial isolates were extracted using a commercial dnaout kit  as described previously  <cit> . the screening of mls resistance determinants including methylase genes erm, erm and erm; phosphotransferase genes mph and mph; lincosamide nucleotidyltransferase genes lnu and lnu; erythromycin esterase genes ere and ere; streptogramin resistance genes vga, vga, vgb and vgb, and the macrolide efflux determinants msr/msr was performed by pcr using the specific primers as described in previous studies . pcr products were randomly selected and sequenced to ensure specificity and accuracy. sequence comparisons were performed using the basic local alignment search tool  program .

RESULTS
characterization of mls resistance phenotypes in erythromycin-resistant isolates and mic distribution
of the  <dig> coagulase-positive s. aureus  isolates,  <dig> were resistant to at least one mls antibiotic. thirty-eight out of  <dig> er-r copsa  isolates exhibited imls phenotypes, whereas only  <dig> isolates expressed cmls phenotypes, with no ms phenotype. the mics of the macrolides and lincosamides antibiotics for the  <dig> er-r copsa isolates are summarized in table  <dig>  among er-r copsa, 100 %, 100 %, 80 %,  <dig>  % and 5 % of isolates were resistant to erythromycin, azithromycin, spiramycin, tylosin and clindamycin, respectively. the mic <dig> and mic <dig> values of 14-membered, 15-membered macrolides and 16-membered macrolide spiramycin were ≥128 μg/ml, while the mic <dig> values of 16-membered macrolides tylosin and lincosamides were in the susceptible range. no isolate expressed resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin .table  <dig> minimum inhibitory concentrations  of  <dig> er-r coagulase-positive s. aureus isolates

the imls phenotype rate of er-r s. aureus  and er-r cons  isolates was much higher in this study than previous studies, underlining the importance of routine screening of bovine s. aureus and cons isolates for inducible resistance phenotypes. wang et al.  <cit>  reported that the inducible mls resistance phenotype was detected in  <dig> out of 72 s. aureus isolates from cows with clinical mastitis in inner mongolia of china. in another study, only  <dig> isolates with the imls phenotype were found out of  <dig> er-r cons in germany  <cit> . the reason for the higher rate of the imls phenotype in our study is not clear.

characterization of mls resistance genotypes in erythromycin-resistant isolates
among  <dig> er-r copsa isolates, the most dominant resistance gene was erm , followed by the mph , erm , ere  and vga  . the msr/msr genes were found in  <dig> isolates, which were all positive for erm or erm genes and displayed imls phenotypes . considering the  <dig> er-r cons isolates, msr/msr genes were present in  <dig> isolates, erm in  <dig>  erm in  <dig>  mph in  <dig>  vga in  <dig> and ere in  <dig> isolates. at least one of the mls resistance genes was detected in each er-r isolate. the simultaneous presence of two or more mls antibiotic resistance genes was also detected . the simultaneous presence of two or more macrolide resistance genes in the same s. aureus or cons isolate is well-known and has been reported previously for s. aureus or cons isolates from bovine mastitis  <cit> .table  <dig> mls resistance phenotypes and genotypes in er-r coagulase-positive s. aureus and er-r cons isolates

correlation between the mic values of mls resistance phenotypes and phenotypes
the possible relationship between mls resistance phenotypes and genotypes was also explored. among the  <dig> er-r copsa isolates,  <dig> isolates with imls phenotypes were sensitive to 16-membered macrolides spiramycin and  <dig> isolates with imls phenotypes were sensitive to tylosin. those isolates were all erm and/or erm positive. as for the  <dig> er-r cons isolates,  <dig> erm and/or erm positive isolates with the ms phenotype and  <dig> erm and/or erm positive isolates with the imls phenotype were sensitive to 16-membered macrolides spiramycin and tylosin, respectively. furthermore, 1 s. warneri with the ms phenotype and  <dig> cons isolates with the imls phenotype were also sensitive to 16-membered macrolides spiramycin and tylosin. those  <dig> isolates were negative for erm genes but positive for other mls resistance genes, such as msr/, mph, ere, lnu or vga. in general, erm-carrying er-r s. aureus and cons isolates with imls or ms phenotypes possessed a high degree of resistance to erythromycin, azithromycin and clindamycin , while having a low rate of resistance to 16-membered macrolides tylosin and/or spiramycin.

it has been reported that the lactone rings of 16- and 14-membered macrolides adopt distinctly diverse conformations, thereby enabling the former compounds to avoid steric hindrance with the nucleotide a <dig> mutation in e. coli  <cit> . such a mechanism may be also responsible for differential sensitivity to 16- and 14-membered macrolides in staphylococci. in addition, differential effects of  <dig> and 15-membered macrolides versus 16-membered macrolides on expression of erm genes could contribute to our results. expression of erm genes can be either inducible or constitutive. inducible erm genes expression is controlled at a post-transcriptional level, which involves a structure upstream from the erm gene composing of a leader peptide and a series of inverted repeats. formation of different mrna secondary structures in this regulatory region in the presence or absence of an inducer allows or prevents the translation of the erm gene transcripts  <cit> . only 14- and 15-membered macrolide can induce erm expression, while 16-membered macrolides, lincosamides, or streptogramins are not able to induce erm gene expression  <cit> . however, why  <dig> cons without the erm gene were also sensitive to 16-membered macrolides spiramycin and tylosin in this study is unclear and will be further studied. in addition, previous studies have shown that erm gene expression can quickly and irreversibly switch from inducible expression to constitutive expression under selective pressure due to the structural alterations , which then renders the respective staphylococcal isolate resistant to all 14-, 15-, and 16-membered macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin b antibiotics . therefore, different conformational rearrangements in the mrna structure or structural alterations  in the upstream regulatory region of erm genes could be one of the plausible reasons of our isolates and such resistance mechanism will be further studied.

other resistance genes may also play a role in the sensitivity to 16-membered macrolides. for example, msr/msr genes in copsa isolates. these genes encode an inducible efflux pump which is an abc transporter. 14- and 15-membered macrolides are inducers and substrates for the pump, while clindamycin is neither an inducer nor a substrate  <cit> . in our research, all  <dig> msr/msr-carrying copsa isolates were also erm and/or erm genes positive. these isolates had the imls phenotype and exhibited mics of ≥256 μg/ml for erythromycin while susceptible to 16-membered macrolides spiramycin and/or tylosin. however, the situation is much complicated for  <dig> msr/msr-carrying cons isolates. among them,  <dig>  had the imls phenotype,  <dig>  had the cmls phenotype and  <dig>  had the ms phenotype.

characterization of mls resistance genotypes in erythromycin-susceptible isolates
among  <dig> erythromycin-susceptible  copsa isolates,  <dig> isolates were positive for lnu,  <dig> for erm,  <dig> for mph,  <dig> for erm,  <dig> for msr/,  <dig> for ere and  <dig> for vga genes , but all were susceptible to the corresponding antibiotics  in the antibiotic susceptibility testing, due to unknown reasons. as for  <dig> er-s cons isolates,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cons isolates harbored erm, erm, msr/, mph, ere, vga genes, respectively . furthermore, the lincosamide nucleotidyltransferase gene, lnu, was detected in all er-r s. aureus, er-r cons isolates, er-s cons and  <dig> er-s copsa isolates . the presence of lnu among staphylococcal isolates from bovine mastitis has been reported  <cit> . the lnu gene is mainly carried by small rolling-circle plasmids and it mediates only a low-level of resistance to the lincosamide pirlimycin  <cit> . the ere gene was detected for the first time in staphylococci of bovine milk origin. our results are in agreement with previous studies which detected erm, lnu, mph or erm genes in susceptible s. aureus or cons isolates  <cit> . when martineau et al.  <cit>  subcultured  <dig> erythromycin susceptible strains harboring the erm gene with increasing concentration of the antibiotic, they found that those susceptible strains all become resistant. thus, we need to be vigilant when we use mls antibiotics on dairy farms.table  <dig> mls resistance genes in  <dig> er-s coagulase-positive s. aureus and  <dig> er-s cons isolates

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, a very high rate of imls  phenotype of er-r s. aureus and mls resistance phenotype  of cons isolates from milk of mastitic cows was found in this study in comparison with previous studies, presumably due to extensive use of mls antibiotics in dairy cows in our region. our results suggest that mls antibiotics should be used judiciously for therapeutic and prophylactic intervention of staphylococci infection.
