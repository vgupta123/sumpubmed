BACKGROUND
the hapalindole family of natural products is a group of hybrid isoprenoid-indole alkaloids. specifically, the hapalindole family has been identified solely within the genera hapalosiphon, fischerella, westiella and westiellopsis <cit> , which belong to the subsection v  order of cyanobacteria. the hapalindole-type natural products are a structurally fascinating group of compounds, with over  <dig> variations identified to date, and is defined by the presence of an isonitrile- or isothiocyanate-containing indole alkaloid skeleton, with a cyclized isoprene unit. members of the hapaldinole family are then divided into several sub-families, which include the hapalindoles, welwitindolinones, fisherindoles, ambiguines, fischambiguines, hapalindolinones, hapaloxindoles and fontonamides  <cit> .

structural diversity within the hapalindole family is generated through variation in the pattern of terpene cyclization, chlorination, methylation, oxidation/reduction and additional prenylation. remarkably, despite their structural similarities, each analogue displays unique bioactivities, ranging from anticancer bioactivity by n-methyl welwitindolinone c isothiocyanate   <cit> , <cit> , to antituberculosis activity of ambiguines k and m, fischambiguine b   <cit> , <cit>  and hapalindoles x and a  <cit> .

recently, gene clusters responsible for ambiguine  and welwitindolinone  biosynthesis were identified from fischerella ambigua utex  <dig> and hapalosiphon welwitschii utex b <dig>  respectively  <cit> , <cit> . key biosynthetic steps towards the formation of hapalindoles were characterized. in vitro characterization of ambp <dig> confirmed the amb gene cluster was responsible for the biosynthesis of the ambiguines from hapalindole g  <cit> . furthermore, in vitro characterization of a methyltransferase, welm, encoded only within the wel gene cluster, confirmed its involvement in the methylation of welwitindolinone c isothiocyanate to form n-methylwelwitindolinone c isothiocyanate  <cit> .

in order to further investigate the relatively complex network of biosynthetic pathways leading to the biosynthesis of the hapalindole-type natural products, we chose to analyze four subsection v cyanobacterial strains known to produce a range of these compounds . fischerella sp. atcc  <dig> has been reported to produce four hapalindoles  <cit> , whereas fischerella ambigua utex <dig> produces a range of hapalindoles, ambiguines and fischambiguines  <cit> , <cit> . multiple hapalindoles, fischerindoles and welwitindolinones have been reported to be produced by hapalosiphon welwitschii uh strain ic-52- <dig>  whilst three welwitindolinones have been reported from westiella intricata uh strain ht-29- <dig>  <cit>  . we aimed to identify a gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of these compounds in each strain, while also screening publicly available cyanobacterial genomes for the presence of the hapalindole-type biosynthetic gene cluster. the genetic analyses were complemented by in vitro enzymatic assays for the isonitrile biosynthesis enzymes weli <dig> and weli <dig>  resulting in the formation of both cis and trans isoforms of 3-indole . furthermore, the enzymology is supported through structural verification of both cis and trans isoforms of the indole-isonitrile extracted directly from fischerella sp. and fischerella ambigua cultures.

RESULTS
whole genome sequencing of fischerella sp. atcc  <dig> , fischerella ambigua utex  <dig> , hapalosiphon welwitschii uh strain ic-52- <dig>  and westiella intricata uh strain ht-29- <dig>  was used to identify a gene cluster encoding the biosynthesis of the hapalindoles  in each strain. candidate gene clusters were identified in all four sequenced genomes, and pcr reactions were used to seal any gaps. the wel  gene cluster was identified in the genome of wi ht-29- <dig> , and in the genome of hw ic-52- <dig> . the hpi  gene cluster was identified in the fs atcc <dig> genome .

the ambiguine  gene cluster was recently published by hillwig et al. <cit> . we independently sequenced and identified the amb gene cluster from the genome of fa utex <dig> as part of this study. while the majority of the nucleotide sequence is 100% identical, some differences upstream of the 3’ end of ambe <dig> were identified. the amb gene cluster from hillwig et al.  <cit>  encodes para and parb family chromosome partitioning proteins and transposases, however, the amb gene cluster sequenced in this study does not contain these genes, instead, genes encoding monooxygenases and oxidoreductases were identified .

there are currently  <dig> subsection v cyanobacteria draft genomes that are publicly available. we screened all subsection v genomes in an attempt to identify any additional gene clusters encoding the biosynthesis of the hapalindole group of compounds. there has been no reported investigation of hapalindole-type natural products from these strains. we have identified a gene cluster from fischerella sp. pcc  <dig>  , fischerella sp. pcc  <dig>   and fischerella muscicola sag 1427- <dig>   .

biosynthetic gene clusters

*the exact length of this gene cluster was unable to be determined due to sequencing gaps in two genes located at the 5’ end of the gene cluster.

prior to submission of this manuscript, the identification and characterization of the wel gene cluster from h. welwitschii utex b <dig> was published by hillwig et al. <cit>  . as the nucleotide sequence was not available at the time of submission, we were unable to perform any analysis using this data. however, based on the image presented in the manuscript, this gene cluster demonstrates remarkable similarity to the wel gene clusters identified in this study .

comparisons of the hpi, amb and wel gene clusters
the identification of these seven gene clusters, along with the recently published amb and wel gene clusters, allows genetic comparisons to be performed. the nomenclature of genes used in this report follows those in the previously published amb and wel gene clusters  <cit> , <cit> . for simplicity, a gene common to all gene clusters is referred to only by the corresponding letter and number. we have identified a core set of  <dig> genes common to the cyanobacterial strains analyzed in this study . these common genes include the tryptophan biosynthesis genes t1- <dig> and c <dig>  the isonitrile biosynthesis genes i1- <dig>  the isoprenoid biosynthesis genes d1- <dig>  the geranyl pyrophosphate synthase gene p <dig>  the hapalindole-specific aromatic prenyltransferase gene p <dig>  the regulatory protein-encoding genes r <dig> and r <dig>  as well as c <dig> and c <dig> . these  <dig> genes share greater than 92% sequence identity at the protein level.

*the % identity is based on comparison of all enzymes sequenced.

organization of genes
comparison of the gene organization of the hpi/amb/wel gene clusters identified groups of genes whose order and orientation are conserved, however, the presence/absence of specific genes distinguish the hpi, amb and wel gene clusters from each other . these differences are probably essential in forming the given hapalindole-type natural products.

within the hpi/amb/wel gene clusters analyzed, there appears to be two major transcripts, which were predicted based on the direction of the genes . the first predicted major transcript begins at c <dig>  there are  <dig> genes  present on this predicted transcript in all nine gene clusters, in which the arrangement and orientation of the genes has been conserved. however, there are additional genes located within this predicted transcript in a few strains. in the hpi gene cluster from fs atcc <dig>  there is a single transposase located between t <dig> and t <dig>  there are two transposases located between i <dig> and d <dig> in the wel gene cluster from hw utexb <dig>  and there is a single transposase located between i <dig> and d <dig> in the gene cluster from fs pcc <dig>  there are also two oxygenase genes, o <dig> and o <dig>  located between c <dig> and d <dig> in the gene clusters from wi ht-29- <dig> and fm sag1427- <dig>  the gene clusters from wi ht-29- <dig>  hw ic-52- <dig>  fs pcc <dig> and fm sag1427- <dig> also contain two additional conserved genes , located at the beginning of this predicted transcript. in some gene clusters, orf <dig> is also located at the beginning of this predicted transcript. given that the known welwitindolinone-producing strains contain these genes on the same predicted transcript with several other key genes in the biosynthetic pathway, these additional genes may be important in the biosynthesis of the welwitindolinones.

the second predicted major transcript in the hpi/amb/wel gene clusters begins with the gene p <dig> and is present in all the gene clusters identified in this study, except the gene cluster from fm sag1427- <dig>  in the hpi and amb gene clusters, this major predicted transcript is located upstream of the 5’ end of c <dig>  however, in the wel gene clusters, the predicted transcript is located downstream of the 3’ end of c <dig> . a number of oxygenase genes and sequence-redundant domain of unknown function  genes are found on these predicted transcripts, which vary between each gene cluster. the differences in these oxygenase and duf genes are likely related to differences in the natural products produced.

there are additional predicted transcripts in the gene clusters from fs pcc <dig> and the amb gene clusters. downstream of the 3’ end of o <dig>  the exporter genes e <dig>  e <dig>  and e <dig> are all potentially transcribed on a single transcript. in the gene cluster from fs pcc <dig> and the amb gene cluster sequenced in this study, the gene o <dig> is also possibly located on this transcript. in the amb gene cluster sequenced in this study, o <dig> is predicted to be located on a separate transcript.

the genes clusters from hw ic-52- <dig>  wi ht-29- <dig> and fs pcc <dig> contain five additional predicted transcripts upstream of the 5’ end of orf <dig>  which are highly conserved . these genes are not located in any of the hpi or amb gene clusters, suggesting these genes may encode proteins responsible for welwitindolinone biosynthesis.

the regulatory genes r <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig> do not seem to form an operon, and the arrangement and orientation of these genes between each other are conserved in the gene clusters from hw utexb <dig>  hw ic-52- <dig>  wi ht-29- <dig> and fs pcc <dig> 

by comparing the identified hapalindole-like natural products with their encoded gene clusters and proposed biosynthesis, the presence/absence of specific genes may be used to predict which class of hapalindole-type natural products  may be produced from newly identified gene clusters. for example, the presence of ambp <dig> suggests the ability to produce the ambiguines. this knowledge was used to infer the biosynthesis of the hapalindole-type natural products from fs pcc <dig>  fs pcc <dig> and fm sag1427- <dig>  since the metabolite profile of these organisms has not been determined. it is likely that the gene cluster from fs pcc <dig> encodes the biosynthesis of the hapalindoles, and the gene clusters from fs pcc <dig> and fm sag1427- <dig> encode the biosynthesis of the welwitindolinones. the gene cluster from fm sag1427- <dig> was grouped with the wel gene clusters based on the presence and high similarity of the genes o <dig>  o <dig>  r <dig> and m <dig>  all of which are specific to the wel gene clusters. however, the genes located on either side of the wel gene cluster from fm sag1427- <dig> display no similarity to other genes in the wel gene clusters, and some highly conserved genes are missing. the absence of conserved core wel genes suggests the gene cluster may be non-functional in this strain.

in order to assess the mechanism of inheritance of hpi/amb/wel gene clusters within the subsection v strains, we performed phylogenetic analysis of the 16s rdna . all of the strains that either contain the hpi/amb/wel gene cluster or are known producers of these molecules appear to be a monophyletic group, indicating that the gene cluster first appeared in a single ancestral strain. this is interesting, considering that some well-studied cyanobacterial natural products, such as microcystin and saxitoxin, exhibit a scattered distribution across several genera  <cit> , <cit> . studies suggest that the scattered distribution of these molecules occurs as a result of horizontal gene transfer  <cit> – <cit> . the hapalindole family of molecules, however, appears to have been only inherited vertically to each of the descendant strains. this pattern of inheritance is also supported by a phylogenetic tree constructed using the prenyltransferase p <dig> protein sequence, which shows a similar clustering of sequences to the 16s rdna tree . the conserved inheritance of these gene clusters implies that the hapalindole family of compounds plays an important role in the producing strains.

tryptophan biosynthesis
five of the six essential genes required for the biosynthesis of l-tryptophan from chorismate, which are paralogues of trpabcde , were identified in all nine biosynthetic gene clusters  <cit> . the sixth gene, trpf, a phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase gene, is located outside of the gene cluster consistently in all strains analyzed. analysis of the genomes sequenced in this study revealed some cyanobacterial strains also contain a second set of genes which encode for tryptophan biosynthesis, however, other strains only contain the tryptophan genes within the gene cluster for tryptophan biosynthesis. another gene common to all nine gene clusters is c <dig>  a dahp  synthase gene, which encodes an enzyme regulating the biosynthesis of dahp from the condensation of pep  and erythrose-4-phosphate, the first enzymatic step of aromatic amino acid synthesis  <cit> .

indole-isonitrile biosynthesis
a signature chemical feature of the hapalindole family of alkaloids is the presence of an isonitrile functional group. the specific location of this functional group is conserved across all isonitrile-containing members and is at c <dig> of the hapalindole core . the isonitrile biosynthesis genes i1- <dig> were identified and found to be tightly conserved in all clusters . the gene products of i <dig> and i <dig> demonstrate high sequence similarity to the previously characterized isonitrile synthases, isna   <cit>  and pvca   <cit> . the six core motifs of isna and pvca were identified in i <dig> and i <dig> . the gene product of i <dig> displayed high sequence similarity to the α-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenase, isnb and pvcb  <cit> , <cit> . we identified the amino acids of the metal-binding motif in all of the encoded protein sequences of i <dig> .

pathways encoded by isn and pvc require only one copy of each gene for the effective production of the isonitrile functional group from tryptophan  <cit> , <cit> . however, all strains investigated in this study have a duplicated copy of i <dig> , with at least 78% identity between them at the protein level. recent characterization of the set of isonitrile biosynthetic enzymes from the amb gene cluster identified that the enzymes ambi <dig> and ambi <dig> are responsible for the biosynthesis of the isonitrile functional group, however, the enzyme ambi <dig> is functionally-redundant in isonitrile biosynthesis  <cit> . it is curious that this arrangement of three genes, containing the duplicated i <dig>  has been maintained across all strains with very little evidence of mutation over time.

in order to establish the biosynthetic function of weli1/i <dig> from the wel gene cluster of wi ht-29- <dig>  these proteins were heterologously expressed and biosynthetic assays were performed using the escherichia coli cell lysates  with the proposed substrates l-tryptophan and ribose-5-phosphate, in the presence of ammonium iron sulfate and α-ketoglutaric acid   <cit> . an assay containing both enzymes was preferred to individual assays based on the instability of the first intermediate  during isolation   <cit> . prior to analyzing the enzymatic assay mixtures, chemically synthesized cis and trans isomers of indole-isonitrile  were first identified as distinct traces with unique retention times . hplc analyses of enzymatic reaction mixtures after incubation for 16 h showed the presence of two major peaks, confirming the production of the cis and trans isomers of indole-isonitrile . a non-enzymatic formation of the indole-isonitrile was ruled out based on a negative control  . synthesized cis indole-isonitrile standard was incubated under the assay conditions as controls to test if isomerization was involved. results indicate that the trans isomer is not formed through an e. coli-mediated isomerization . however, there is a significant amount of degradation of the cis isomer observed after 16 h of incubation as compared to analysis after 3 h . as a further measure of validation, we co-injected cis and trans indole-isonitriles to samples where enzymatic product formation was observed  and only the two product peaks that correlated to the retention times of cis and trans indole-isonitriles were observed. finally, additional confirmation for indole-isonitrile biosynthesis was obtained through lc-ms analyses under negative ion-mode . overall, the assay results validated the formation of cis and trans indole-isonitriles as the biosynthetic products of the pathway encoded by weli1/i <dig>  in contrast to ambi1/ <dig> and weli1/ <dig> from fa utex <dig> and hw utexb <dig> respectively, which only produce the cis isomer of the indole-isonitrile  <cit> , <cit> , assay mixtures containing weli1/i <dig> from wi ht-29- <dig> produced both the cis and trans isomers of the indole-isonitrile when the assay is carried out over a 16 h duration. because a mixture of cis and trans products are observed for the first time, these are exciting observations from a natural product biosynthesis point of view, as they lead to interesting questions about the biochemical mechanism of weli1/i <dig>  it is probable that the enzymes are producing the trans isoform in concentrations below detection limit within the first 3 h, which then accumulate over time and can be detected after 16 h. however, it remains to be seen whether both of these isomers engage as substrates for downstream hapalindole-producing steps of the pathway.

until now, direct evidence of the presence of indole-isonitriles from cyanobacterial cultures has remained elusive. therefore, we set out to identify the presence of isonitrile intermediates through direct extraction from fs atcc <dig> and fa utex <dig> cultures. using synthetic standards, similar to the assay described above, a hplc method was established in order to verify the presence of indole-isonitriles from cyanobacterial biomass. hplc analyses identified both the cis and trans isomers of the indole-isonitrile in the extracts of fs atcc <dig> and fa utex <dig> . to confirm the hplc results, fs atcc <dig> and fa utex <dig> cultures were extracted and analyzed by lc-ms under negative ion mode electrospray ionization, and the organic extract from both cultures displayed a + peak at m/z  <dig> consistent with that observed from the chemically synthesized standard. the hresi-ms characterization for the synthesized indole-isonitrile displayed a parent + peak at m/z  <dig>  , while culture extracts from fs atcc <dig> and fa utex <dig> displayed an indole-isonitrile + peak at m/z  <dig>   . thus, we report for the first time, the presence of both cis and trans isomers of indole-isonitrile in two fischerella cultures as biosynthetic intermediates of the hapalindole pathway.

in concurrence with our enzymology observations, the detection of both cis and trans isomers from cyanobacterial extracts by hplc analysis raised the possibility of inter-conversions and/or thermal isomerizations during the timescale of the analyses. therefore, to rule out these possibilities, we subjected the cis isomer of the indole-isonitrile from synthesized standard to the identical extraction protocol performed on the native cyanobacterial cells. only thermal degradation  was observed . overall, the stereochemical integrity of the individual cis and trans isomers was found to be maintained through the course of our isolation procedures.

hapalindole products isolated from fs atcc <dig> strain display both cis and trans stereodisposition in their c10-c <dig> arrangement , implying that both isomers are probable substrates in the subsequent step of the biosynthetic pathway. the presence of the trans isomer in extracts from fa utex <dig> is intriguing considering ambiguines possess strictly a cis stereodisposition between c10-c <dig> stereocenters.

geranyl pyrophosphate biosynthesis
the other proposed substrate for hapalindole biosynthesis is geranyl pyrophosphate , which is biosynthesized from isopentenyl pyrophosphate  and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate  via the mep/doxp pathway. four genes  show homology to dxs, dxr, ispg and isph, which are proposed to biosynthesize ipp and dmapp from pyruvate and d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. the remaining genes, ispdef, are located outside of the gene cluster in most strains . ipp and dmapp are the substrates for the enzyme geranyl pyrophosphate synthase  to produce gpp  <cit> . the gene p <dig> is also conserved across most gene clusters and was proposed to encode a gpp synthase. recent enzymatic characterization of ambp <dig> and welp <dig> from the amb and wel gene clusters, respectively, confirmed our prediction that p <dig> encodes a gpp synthase  <cit> , <cit> .

hapalindole-specific prenyltransferase
the p <dig> gene is also part of the core set of genes found in each of the hpi/amb/wel gene clusters. p <dig> encodes a putative prenyltransferase with sequence similarity to other previously characterized proteins belonging to the abba superfamily of prenyltransferases  <cit> . sequence analysis of p <dig> revealed the absence of the mg-dependent prenyl diphosphate binding motif dxxd  <cit> . the prenyltransferase p <dig> in the hpi/amb/wel gene clusters was initially proposed to convert gpp  to β-ocimene in order to catalyze the prenylation of indole-isonitrile to produce 12-epi- hapalindole c  <cit> . based on the biosynthetic schemes proposed by moore and others, we anticipated p <dig> to possess activity that catalyzes a reverse prenylation independent of any additional enzymatic participation, in which c <dig>  rather than c <dig>  of β-ocimene is attached to c <dig> of indole-isonitrile   <cit> , <cit> . recent characterization of ambp <dig> and welp <dig> from the amb and wel gene clusters both failed to convert gpp to β-ocimene  <cit> , <cit> . we independently set out to characterize p <dig> from the wel gene cluster from wi ht-29- <dig>  welp <dig> was incubated with possible substrates tryptophan or indole-isonitriles with gpp at a range of temperatures and incubation times, however, no differences between the control  and assay were detected via lc-ms. as no product was detected, we suspected an additional enzyme was probably involved. we proposed that the enzymatic pathway for hapalindole biosynthesis involves p <dig> for gpp binding and activation, simultaneously coupled with a halogenating enzyme, based upon the presence of a halogenated prenyl group. a putative halogenase  in the wel gene clusters from hw ic-52- <dig>  wi ht-29- <dig> and fs pcc <dig> displays similarity to fadh2-dependent halogenases, containing both a fad-binding motif  and a tryptophan-binding motif   <cit> . fadh2-dependent halogenases require a partner enzyme, a flavin reductase, to regenerate reduced flavin from fad and nadh  <cit> , <cit> . located upstream from welh, orf <dig> is homologous to nadh dehydrogenases, which may be a partner enzyme for welh. this partner gene set  is conserved between wi ht-29- <dig>  hw ic-52- <dig> and fs pcc <dig> with greater than 98% sequence identity at the protein level. due to the absence of sequence data downstream of the published wel gene cluster from hw utexb <dig> we were unable to establish the presence of a homologous halogenase in this strain  <cit> .

in order to test our theory that welh was involved in hapalindole biosynthesis, we overexpressed welh from the wel gene cluster from wi ht-29- <dig>  we used ssue as the flavin reductase, as ssue is commonly used as a flavin reductase with other fadh2-dependent halogenases from diverse genera  <cit> . however, biochemical assays with welh and ssue did not result in a halogenated product. additionally, biochemical assays using welp <dig>  welh and ssue were also unsuccessful. the absence of this halogenase from the hpi and amb gene clusters suggests that welh may not be involved in hapalindole biosynthesis. recent reports by hillwig et al. <cit>  suggest that the oxygenase welo <dig>  might function to perform this role. further investigation is required to determine the additional enzymes required for hapalindole biosynthesis with p <dig> 

oxygenase genes
comparison of the hpi, amb and wel gene clusters also identified  <dig> genes encoding oxygenases from all eight gene clusters . each encoded protein sequence was compared to each other, and those with an identity greater than 90% were believed to be homologous proteins, and labelled with the same number . a total of  <dig> different oxygenase genes  were identified . eleven of the  <dig> oxygenases  were identified as rieske-type oxygenase genes. the  cluster motif, the iron-sulfur rieske domain and nonheme fe-binding motif were identified within the encoded protein sequence . both hpio <dig> and ambo <dig> appear to be atypical rieske-homologous proteins. analysis of all  <dig> oxygenase genes revealed none were common in all nine gene clusters. o1- <dig> and o <dig> were found exclusively in the amb gene cluster, suggesting these oxygenases are involved in the structural diversification of the ambiguines. o4- <dig> were identified in the hpi gene cluster from fs pcc <dig> and the amb gene cluster. furthermore, o <dig> was found exclusively in both of the hpi gene clusters identified in this study. two oxygenases, o <dig> and o <dig>  were identified only in the hpi gene cluster from fs atcc <dig>  o <dig> and o14- <dig> were identified in three wel gene clusters , and o <dig> and o <dig> have been identified in the wel gene cluster from wi ht-29- <dig> and hw ic-52- <dig>  the presence of o <dig> and o <dig> in the wel gene cluster from fs pcc <dig> was unable to be confirmed due to sequencing gaps in the oxygenase genes located at the 5’ end of the gene cluster. two oxygenase genes, o <dig> and o <dig>  proposed to encode a monooxygenase and a rieske-type oxygenase, were identified in the wel gene clusters from wi ht-29- <dig> and fm sag1427- <dig>  further biochemical investigation is required to determine the specific role of each oxygenase to their respective pathway.

genes containing a domain of unknown function
another common feature of the hpi/amb/wel gene clusters is the presence of duf genes.  <dig> duf genes were identified from all of the gene clusters  and each protein sequence was compared to each other and those with an identity greater than 90% were labelled with the same number . a total of eight different genes  were identified . although one duf gene was not found in all gene clusters, u <dig> was identified in all of the hpi and wel gene clusters. u1- <dig> were identified in both the hpi and amb gene clusters, and u <dig> was identified in the hpi gene cluster from fs pcc <dig> and the amb gene cluster. u <dig> was identified exclusively in the hpi gene cluster from fs atcc <dig>  u <dig> was identified only in the wel gene cluster from hw ic-52- <dig>  and u <dig> was identified in the wel gene clusters from hw ic-52- <dig>  wi ht-29- <dig> and fs pcc <dig>  however, as the function of these protein-encoding genes remains unknown, their involvement in the biosynthesis of the hapalindole, fischerindoles, ambiguines and welwitindolinones remains elusive.

methytransferase genes
the wel gene clusters identified in wi ht-29- <dig>  hw ic-52- <dig> and fs pcc <dig> contain three genes with homology to different methyltransferases  . only welm <dig> was identified in the wel gene cluster from fm sag1427- <dig>  although sequence downstream of the wel cluster in hw utexb <dig> is unable to establish the presence of welm <dig> and welm <dig>  we propose  that welm <dig> and welm <dig> would be conserved. hillwig et al. <cit>  have established that welm <dig> encodes the n-methyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of n-methyl-welwitindolinone c isonitrile via in vitro enzymology, confirming the wel gene cluster is responsible for welwitindolinone biosynthesis. m <dig> is proposed to encode a sam-dependent methyltransferase, whilst m <dig> is proposed to encode a histamine n-methyltransferase. the purpose of welm <dig> and welm <dig> remain unknown, as no other known compounds of the hapalindole family require an additional methylation reaction.

ambiguine biosynthesis
the aromatic prenyltransferase ambp <dig> was characterized, and shown to be responsible for catalyzing the prenylation of hapalindole g with dmapp to produce the ambiguines. we identified ambp <dig> only in the amb gene cluster from fa utex <dig>  thus confirming this is the only species within this study with the capability to produce ambiguines.

other genes
three response regulator-coding genes have been identified from the nine gene clusters analyzed in this study. welr <dig> is unique to the wel gene clusters. however, the two regulatory genes r <dig> and r <dig> were identified in all hpi/amb/wel gene clusters . the transporter genes e1- <dig> that were originally identified in the amb gene cluster have also been identified in the hpi gene cluster from fs pcc <dig>  e <dig>  proposed to encode a small multidrug resistance protein, was identified in three wel gene clusters identified in this study . c <dig> and c <dig> are proposed to encode proteins for which their function in hapalindole/ambiguine/welwitindolinone biosynthesis remains unknown.

CONCLUSIONS
the identification of the seven biosynthetic gene clusters in this study, along with the recently published amb and wel biosynthetic gene clusters, enabled bioinformatic comparisons to be performed. organization of the wel gene clusters is distinct from the hpi and amb gene clusters, which enables the prediction of which class of hapalindole-type natural products  may be biosynthesized from these clusters within genomes. phylogenetic analysis indicates organisms that contain the hpi/amb/wel gene clusters form a monophyletic clade and, thus, hapalindole biosynthesis is likely to be inherited vertically, rather than horizontally. though a conserved triad of genes  are present in all clusters, weli <dig> and weli <dig> are sufficient to catalyze the resulting formation of cis and trans geometrical isomers when using a cell lysate. this first report of the isolation of both cis and trans geometrical isomers for the indole-isonitrile from both enzymatic assays using weli <dig> and i <dig> from wi ht-29- <dig> and from metabolic extractions of two hapalindole-producing fischerella strains, implies the conservation of stereochemical integrity towards members of the ambiguine and welwitindolinone products, and opens new mechanistic possibilities to be studied.

this study reports new findings which are essential to the overall elucidation of the unusual mechanism of biosynthesis of the hapalindole family of compounds, however, several steps still remain elusive. at present, only a few group v cyanobacterial genomes are available. however, as more genomes are sequenced from cyanobacteria known to produce hapalindole-type natural products and further enzymology is performed, the full biosynthetic pathway to all the hapalindole-type natural products may be determined. a diverse range of oxygenases have been identified in the gene clusters reported in this study. the future enzymatic characterization of the oxygenases will most likely provide a foundation to elucidate the complex biosynthetic pathway of the hapalindole-type natural products.
