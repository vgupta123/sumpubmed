BACKGROUND
microarrays are widely used to study genome-wide gene expression levels. a frequently used type of microarray is the affymetrix genechip  <cit> . this technology uses multiple probes per gene  to measure the amount of mrna present . for reasons of specificity, probes are chosen to be complementary to a unique part of the target sequence. although all probes from a single probe set should measure the same amount of mrna, the hybridization signals of individual probes for a given mrna molecule may vary widely. this is believed to be caused by variations in molecular characteristics of the probe sequence, such as gc content and secondary structure, and corrections have been proposed to calculate true expression levels averaged over probe signals  <cit> . however, another reason for the variation in signal between probes could be misdesigned probes, that either do not match the target rna or can hybridize with other, non-target, rna molecules. for correct interpretation of the results of affymetrix genechip hybridizations, it is important to know which probes may cause variation in hybridization and for what reason. for example, in our large scale genetical genomics applications  <cit> , individual probe hybridizations are used to map regulatory regions in a genome. in such applications, it is important to be able to rule out potential false positive results due to misdesigned probes.

an earlier analysis of the probe sequences of the affymetrix mouse genome u74av <dig> array  <cit>  against the refseq database showed that for only 51% of the probe sets on the array all probes could be 'entirely verified', that is, corresponded without any mismatch to a refseq mrna sequence. a recent analysis at the individual probe level verified 73% of the individual probe sequences of the mg-u74av <dig> array against mrna sequences from entrez  <cit> . affymetrix supplies regular updates of probe set verifications using new releases of the refseq, genbank and ensembl databases  <cit> . in the july  <dig> release, 70% of the probe sets of the mg-u74av <dig> genechip are 'entirely verified'. these surprisingly low verification percentages suggest that a major part of the hybridization results of such an array should be regarded with caution. little information is available on the possibility of hybridization of individual mouse probes with non-target rna molecules  <cit> . here we present an extensive and generalized protocol for the verification of probe sequences on affymetrix arrays.

the protocol uses four databases: ncbi refseq, ncbi unigene unique, nia mouse gene index, and ucsc mouse genome. by incorporating these databases in the verification protocol, the number of sequence-verified probes of the affymetrix mouse arrays increases considerably. the same protocol applied to other mouse arrays, or a similar protocol  for human and rat arrays, yielded similar results. refined chip definition files , which include only verified probes, are provided online.

we conclude that with the corrections as proposed previously  <cit> , the accuracy and reliability of the affymetrix arrays is considerably higher than reported till now. our new data on probe verification and cross-hybridization are important for assessing unexpected behaviour of any given individual probe in a given experiment and will contribute to the more accurate assessment of expression data using affymetrix arrays.

RESULTS
quality of sequence databases
the verification protocol for mouse arrays makes use of three messenger databases , and one genome database . we first assessed their quality. assuming that the genome is the most accurate sequence with an error rate of less than  <dig> in  <dig>  bases  <cit> , we compared the sequence of  <dig> randomly selected genes, all occurring in each of the three messenger databases, to the genome . table  <dig> shows that there were no major quality differences between the messenger databases, except that the nia mouse gene index showed a lower mismatch frequency. the sequence differences that are observed may be due to sequencing errors, but also to genetic polymorphisms between mouse strains. this means that each database contains reliable information and can be used to verify probe sequences.

comparison with the genomic sequence of all entries of  <dig> randomly selected genes that each has an entry in each of the three messenger databases. the summed number of mismatches, gaps and nucleotides for these  <dig> genes is given.

the verification protocol
in the protocol for mouse arrays, we use the blast program to verify all probe sequences against the three messenger databases . using the terminology of mecham et al.  <cit> , for each probe set we determine per database whether it is

• 'entirely verified', meaning that all probes were identical to a messenger sequence;

• 'partially verified', meaning that only a subset of probes was identical to a messenger sequence;

• 'entirely unverified', meaning that none of the probes was identical to a messenger sequence.

only probe sets that could not be classified as 'entirely verified' against one of the three messenger databases, were verified against the genome . each probe set is assigned a verification score which is the best score over all databases, where 'entirely verified' is better than 'partially verified', and 'partially verified' is better than 'entirely unverified'. for the final verification score the order of the databases does not matter since each probe set is assigned the best possible score.

we included all mentioned databases in the protocol to obtain the greatest coverage. since the genome sequence database is much larger than the messenger databases and therefore the verification against the genome takes much longer, we have put the verification against the genome in the last position. this improves computational efficiency. the verification is not hampered by the lower accuracy of the messenger databases compared to the genome, since only  <dig> %  of the probe sets of the mg-u74av <dig>  array were 'entirely verified' against one of the messenger databases but 'entirely unverified' against the genome. we examined some of the probe sets that were 'entirely unverified' against the genome in more detail. these seem to represent contaminated non-mouse sequences, or the tiny fraction of genes that are still missing from the assembled genomes. because there are no major quality differences between the messenger databases, their order is in principle arbitrary. however, we have put refseq in the first position in the protocol since it contains the most intensively curated transcript sequence information and probe sets that are 'entirely verified' against this database exit the protocol with refseq gene identifiers .

verification of the u <dig> and  <dig> arrays
we here report the results of the application of the verification protocol to two mouse genechips, mg-u74av <dig> and  <dig>  <dig> , to which we will refer as 'u74' and '430', respectively. the percentages of 'entirely verified' probe sets are reported in a cumulative way, i.e. they grow with every database added; see figure  <dig> 

megablasting all probe sequences of the u <dig> array against the mouse ncbi refseq database 'entirely verified' only 53% of all probe sets; this confirms the 51% reported earlier  <cit>  with an older version of the refseq database. from the  <dig> array, only 46% of all probe sets could be 'entirely verified' . next, by including the unigene unique database we 'entirely verified' 59% and 56% of all probe sets in u <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. then, by including the nia mouse gene index, the percentages grow to 69% and 74%, respectively. at last, we verified the remaining probe sets that were not yet 'entirely verified' against the ucsc mouse genome database. this way, we finally 'entirely verified' 74% and 85% of all probe sets in u <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. more detailed numbers of the contribution of each of the databases to the final verification are given in additional file 1: 'verification scores for the affymetrix u <dig> array' and additional file 2: 'verification scores for the affymetrix  <dig> array'.

most 'partially verified' probe sets contain at most two bad probes
in this verification protocol, the class 'partially verified' is heterogeneous in nature. for a proper interpretation of the hybridization signals of a given probe set, it may be required to know how many and which probes of a particular set are not giving a perfect match with the mouse genome data available. in figure  <dig> we have plotted the number of perfectly matching probes for those probe sets that were categorized in the 'partially verified' class. this shows that mainly one or two probes per probe set give a less than perfect match. especially in case of the u <dig> array, where  <dig> probes per gene are present, the hybridization results of such non-perfect probes could be disregarded and the remaining probe set can be considered 'entirely verified'. in the supplementary material, the precise identification of these probes can be retrieved. by repeating the protocol and allowing one or two non-perfect probes per probe set, 80% and 94% of the probe sets of u <dig> and  <dig> were 'entirely verified', respectively.

allowing mismatches
laboratory experience has shown that often the hybridization conditions do not allow distinction between a perfect match and a mismatch probe  <cit> . in this context, it could be argued that the requirement for a perfect match in probe sequence verification is not necessary, especially when only pm signals are used for estimating the expression levels, as is the case for most modern probe summarization methods . moreover, messenger databases contain sequencing errors. for these two reasons, we have repeated the verification protocol as established above while allowing either one or two mismatches per probe sequence; 26% and 47% of the unverified probes had one or two mismatches between probe and target for u <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. figure  <dig> shows that the percentage of 'entirely verified' probe sets increases considerably, up to 77% for u <dig> and 91% for  <dig> in case of one mismatch and up to 79% for u <dig> and 93% for  <dig> for two mismatches. if we restrict ourselves to probe sets labeled by affymetrix with "_at" then 85% of the probe sets are 'entirely verified' for u <dig> and 92% for  <dig> in case of one mismatch, and 87% for u <dig> and 93% for  <dig> for two mismatches. if we allow for two mismatches and also drop one or two unverifiable probes then 84% and 97% of all probe sets of u <dig> and  <dig> were 'entirely verified'. the hybridization conditions of the individual laboratory will have to decide which validation scheme is most appropriate and which probes or probe sets have to be scrutinized with more care.

cross-hybridization
another issue of quality control is the specificity of probe sequences. a probe set may be 'entirely verified' with a given gene, yet an individual probe from such a set may be identical, or more similar than desired, to the sequence of another gene. this may cause cross-hybridization of different mrnas and give rise to a probe that yields a hybridization signal that differs markedly from the other probe sequences. for the u <dig> array, 17% of the probes in 'entirely verified' probe sets had more than one megablast hit against the refseq, unigene unique and/or nia databases; 23% of the verified probe sets had at least one such probe with multiple megablast hits. for the  <dig> array the percentages are 15% and 18% respectively. the numbers of cross-hybridizing probes per verified probe set are given in figure  <dig>  note that the genome has not been used to assess cross-hybridization, since probe selection regions were used and individual probes were not compared with the genome. in the majority of probe sets with cross-hybridizing probes, all probes are cross-hybridizing. this indicates different splicing variants or duplicated genes that have different identifiers but can not be distinguished by these probe sets. again, the individual laboratory will have to decide which probes or probe sets have to be scrutinized with more care.

verification of all available human, mouse and rat arrays confirms high probe accuracy
we applied the protocol to all other affymetrix mouse arrays and we developed a similar protocol consisting of the three databases refseq, unigene unique and ucsc genome for the analysis of all human and rat affymetrix arrays. table  <dig> shows the results; the most striking observation is that, except the human x3p array, the newer arrays show high accuracy of probe sequences. new chip definition files for these  <dig> arrays can be downloaded from  <cit> . one can choose cdf files with or without cross-hybridizing probes and allowing for  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> mismatches between sequence and probe.

 all probe sequences are sequence verified;  all probes, except at most two per probe set, are sequence verified;  all probes, except at most two per probe set, are sequence verified allowing for one or two mismatches between probe and target gene;  date of release of the array.

the impact of updated probe set definitions on expression data
microarrays are often used to find genes that are differentially expressed. to assess the impact of the updated probe set definitions on the assessment of differential gene expression, we reanalyzed an example dataset, the clinical prostate cancer behavior dataset , consisting of  <dig> prostate tumor rna samples and  <dig> non-diseased rna samples hybridized to the human hg-u95av <dig> array. using rankproducts , we calculated lists of differentially expressed genes, both using the original affymetrix cdf file and the new cdf file.  <dig> upregulated probe sets were detected with both cdf files,  <dig> probe sets were detected only with the new cdf file and  <dig> probe sets were detected only with the original cdf file .

this result only shows that there are differences between the two cdf files. to check if refining the probe set definition indeed improves the results, we performed additional testing. for this purpose we focused on those genes that are most strongly affected, i.e. those genes whose rank in the list created with the original cdf file and the rank in the list created with the new cdf file are most different. such genes will appear as differentially expressed in one list but not the other. if random probes are different between the two analyses, this difference can be both ways, with equal probability. however, we predict that improved probe sets will result in better detection of differential expression, as non-verifiable probes probably do not show differential expression and hence weaken the differential expression of the whole probe set. in that case, the genes that differ between the two lists should more often be detected as differentially expressed with the new cdf file compared to the original cdf file, than the other way around. focusing on the genes with the highest differences in ranks, a significant proportion  had a higher  rank in the list created with the new cdf file compared to the list created with the original cdf file , confirming our prediction. of the  <dig> probesets that showed the highest improvement in rank, 100% had been redefined. this indicates that a significant number of genes is picked up as differentially expressed with the new cdf file, while they remain undetected using the original cdf file.

two ranked lists of differentially expressed genes were calculated: one using affymetrix' original cdf file and one using our cdf file. genes were sorted in descending order according to their normalized difference in rank ). the top n genes are those which are most strongly affected by the probe set redefinition. the percentage of genes that obtained a higher rank using our refined cdf file compared to using the original cdf file is given. for random redefinitions, a percentage of  <dig> would be expected. separate analyses for up- and downregulated genes were done. it can be seen that among the most strongly affected probe sets the large majority shows improved differential expression results when analyzed using the refined cdf file.

to verify that this observed improvement of results is consistent in other datasets and platforms, we repeated this evaluation procedure for a dataset of  <dig> smoker vs.  <dig> non-smoker samples from intra-pulmonary airway epithelial cells hybridized to hg-u133a arrays and a dataset of  <dig> male vs.  <dig> female bwf <dig> lupus-prone mice spleen samples hybridized to mg-u74av <dig> arrays. we saw the same clear improvement, with high statistical significance . as outlined above, we expect that random changes in the probe set definition would lead to equal numbers of genes being affected in either direction. we calculated the difference of the observed amount of genes having a higher rank with the new cdf and the expected amount , for different values of n. we used the maximum excess as an estimate of the number of probe sets that are significantly improved by refining the cdf files. depending on the array, these numbers range between  <dig> and  <dig>  although these numbers are small compared to the total number of genes present on the array, they comprise a large fraction of the genes that are typically found to be differentially expressed in a microarray experiment.

discussion
in different studies  <cit>  affymetrix probe sequences were verified against mrna databases. in all of these studies, only one mrna database was considered. gautier et al.  <cit>  and zhang et al.  <cit>  verified human affymetrix arrays against mrna sequences from entrez and refseq. elo et al.  <cit>  investigated the reproducibility of the probe signals for different generations of affymetrix arrays. they compared the correlations of probe signals for original affymetrix probe sets and verified probe sets, which they defined as the subset of probes of the original probe sets that only match with the target transcript for which the probes were originally designed by affymetrix. they found that probe verification improved the correlations between generations of affymetrix arrays and also that probe verification improved the consistency of the measurements within an array. mecham et al.  <cit>  showed that probe verification results in increased precision in technical replicates; increased accuracy across complementary microarray platforms, increased accuracy translating data from oligonucleotide arrays to cdna microarrays, and increased diagnostic power of microarray technology.

a problem with the refseq and the unigene unique databases is that 3' utrs are often truncated by the way the sequences are assembled  <cit> , while affymetrix selects the probes from the  <dig> bases most proximal to the 3' end of each transcript  <cit> . we overcame this problem by incorporating the genome in the verification protocol, where all 3' utrs are available.

the fantom  <dig> project  provides an extensive characterization of the mouse transcriptome. we also tested the verification protocol with the fantom  <dig> transcripts included. since this did not increase our verification scores , we did not include this database in our protocol.

the mrna and genome databases currently available are mainly based on the c57bl/ <dig> mouse strain. also, the probes on the affymetrix arrays are mainly based on the c57bl/ <dig> mouse strain. when samples from c57bl/ <dig> mice are hybridized to the arrays, their transcripts are expected to perfectly match the probes. however, mice from genetically different strains or from recombinant inbred pedigrees, as in our genetical genomics applications  <cit> , may carry allelic snps compared to the c57bl/ <dig> genome. probes carrying allelic snps may hamper data interpretation as putative differential mrna expression can be confounded with differential hybridization  <cit> . when sequences of other mouse strains become available, the verification protocol here developed should be repeated for these newly sequenced strains to identify and, if so desired, eliminate probes carrying allelic snps.

the use of refined probe set definitions, that exclude unverified probes, will improve the interpretation of expression data, as non-hybridizing and mis-hybridizing probes add only noise to the data. our evaluation of expression data from the public domain shows that this is indeed the case.

CONCLUSIONS
by combining various verifications as described above, we show that 74% of the u <dig> probe sets and 85% of the  <dig> probe sets can be considered 'entirely verified' when based on perfect matches. when two mismatches are allowed, the percentages increase to 79% for u <dig> and 93% for  <dig>  when considering individual probes, 85% and 95% of the probes were verified for u <dig> and  <dig> respectively, and even 89% and 97% when allowing two mismatches. our extensive analyses of probe sequence data show that the inclusion of various databases, such as the genome sequence, indicate that the arrays are much more accurate than shown previously. existing data can be reanalyzed with our verified probe sets . we show that such a refined probe set definition has clear effects on the detection of differentially expressed genes and demonstrate for various experiments that the results are systematically improved by discarding unverified probes.
