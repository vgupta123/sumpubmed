BACKGROUND
population genomics analyses can provide insight into the evolutionary history of populations by providing rich, genome-wide measures of genetic variation and its related parameters including gene flow, population size and reproductive system  <cit> . population genomics studies can also identify genomic regions experiencing exceptional degrees of recombination or selection. coupled with annotations that come out of genome sequencing projects, it becomes possible to identify candidate genes within interesting hotspots that may underlie differences among populations that arise through selection for local adaptation.

recombination has an important effect on both genotypic diversity and evolutionary potential. the evolutionary potential reflects a pathogen’s response to control measures such as fungicide applications and deployment of resistant cultivars. both homothallic inbreeding and asexual reproduction can reduce the effective recombination rate relative to random outcrossing  <cit> , generating a non-random association among loci over the genome called linkage disequilibrium . the pattern of ld can provide insight into an organism’s evolutionary history  <cit> . different genomic regions within the same population can exhibit different ld patterns as a result of differences in selection or differences in recombination rates  <cit> . however the size of ld blocks will depend on the methods used for detection. recent advances in sequencing technology allowed a significant expansion in the number of loci used for ld measurements, which now include thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms  that cover the entire genome . a recent study on drosophila melanogaster reported an extremely rapid decay of ld within the surprisingly small distance of 10 bp  <cit> .

population genomic studies that search for associations between markers and quantitative traits require a large number of genetic markers  <cit> , often using hybridization approaches based on dense panels of snp markers that cover the genome. an alternative approach invented by baird et al.  <cit> , called restriction site associated dna sequencing , combines a high density of snp markers, with a high genome coverage at a relatively low cost  <cit> .

fusarium head blight  disease causes significant annual losses in cereal production around the world, in addition to frequent contamination of foodstuffs with harmful mycotoxins such as nivalenol, deoxynivalenol, and zearalenone. fhb is caused by different species related to the genus fusarium, including f. graminearum  petch) and f. culmorum. f. graminearum sensu stricto  is one of  <dig> cryptic species within the f. graminearum species complex  <cit> . fg ss is a homothallic fungus with a mixed reproductive system including inbreeding, outcrossing and asexual reproduction. sexual reproduction in this fungus is highly dependent on temperature, with an optimum of 25–28 °c . the pattern of ascospore release varies between regions and years  <cit>  depending on the temperature and relative humidity. hence, recombination rates may differ among pathogen populations as a result of differences in their local environments.

several studies of population genetic structure have been conducted in different countries  to better understand the connection between genetic variation and phenotypic variation at the population scale. most of the earlier population studies of fg included a limited number of isolates or a limited number of markers that were not equally distributed over the four fg chromosomes . our goals in this study were to use population genomics analyses to:  determine the genetic structure of field populations of fg ss to assess the reproductive system and the degree of population subdivision occurring over regional spatial scales;  determine the extent of linkage disequilibrium in the genome and conduct a genome-scale search for recombination hotspots;  search for evidence of selection hotspots that may contain candidate genes under strong selection.

RESULTS
genetic variance analysis
our analyses included thirteen field populations of fg ss coming from different geographical areas and environments across germany . the filtered radseq dataset included  <dig> snps with a maximum of  <dig>  % missing data per snp. partitioning of the genetic variance within and among field populations using amova revealed that  <dig>  % of the total genetic variance was within field populations and only  <dig>  % was among populations. the corresponding overall fixation index  was  <dig>  while pairwise differentiation between populations ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  . fst can range between  <dig> and  <dig> according to the degree of population differentiation, with  <dig> representing populations that are indistinguishable.table  <dig> the fusarium graminearum field populations analyzed in this experiment

genetic diversity and population structure
genetic dissimilarity between isolates based on modified rogers’ distance was used to conduct a principle coordinate analysis . though the first  <dig> coordinates were consistent with a continuous distribution, the second and third coordinates explained the highest overall amount of genetic variation . a small group of  <dig> isolates coming from different field populations was visible to the right side of the main cluster relative to coord.  <dig> . an additional group of seven isolates was located at an intermediate distance between the other two groups relative to coord.  <dig>  the structure analyses indicated a maximum of three subdivisions occurring among all isolates  with no geographical pattern evident.fig.  <dig> principal coordinate analysis. the two dimensions shown explain 74 % of the genetic diversity found among the  <dig> isolates included in the analysis. different colors and shapes identify the field population associated with each isolate



pattern of linkage disequilibrium
analyses of linkage disequilibrium  using a sliding window of  <dig> kbp revealed different patterns of ld on different chromosomes . the correlation between ld and physical distance was very low in an analysis that considered all isolates as a single combined population , whereas it ranged from − <dig>  to  <dig>  when analyzing each field population separately . the locally fitted regression showed a low average ld  across the four chromosomes. linked markers showing r <dig> values >  <dig>  dropped rapidly to r2 <  <dig>  within a physical distance ranging from  <dig> to 1000 bp on different chromosomes . the slowest ld decay was detected on chromosome  <dig> fig.  <dig> linkage disequilibrium . pairwise ld in a sliding window of  <dig> kbp along each chromosome in the combined population of  <dig> fusarium graminearum isolates sampled from  <dig> fields. each point represents the ld  between two snps among the  <dig> snps used in the analysis. the red line is the locally fitted regression of ld over physical distance

recombination rates
by analyzing the index of association  and its standardized form  for each population and each chromosome we found that all populations showed very low values of disequilibrium, on average, across all chromosomes. however, some field populations showed varying values of ia, including some with significant p-values, on different chromosomes within the same population. these differences may reflect variation in the degree of sexual recombination experienced by different populations and/or variation in frequencies of recombination among chromosomes . some populations  exhibit less recombination on some chromosomes even after bonferroni adjustment .

the high density of genetic markers allowed us to detect the recombination events found on each chromosome in each field population . the chromosome-wide recombination rate  ranged from  <dig>  × 10− <dig> to  <dig>  × 10− <dig> crossovers per bp per generation , but in the combined population it was  <dig>  × 10− <dig> crossovers/bp/generation over the four chromosomes . by analyzing snp markers on a finer scale, hotspots of recombination were revealed across the genome for the combined population . the recombination hotspots displayed a wide variation in recombination frequency, ranging from  <dig>  × 10− <dig> to  <dig>  × 10− <dig> crossovers/bp/generation across the genome. the number of base pairs found in a hotspot ranged from  <dig> to 640 bp for the combined population. the population recombination parameter  was highest on chr <dig> followed by chr <dig>  chr <dig> and was lowest on chr <dig> . different populations showed different distributions of recombination hotspots, though several hotspots were shared among some populations . significant enrichment for some domains was found within the recombination hotspots .fig.  <dig> pooler plot of genomic parameters. inner circle shows distribution of most extreme recombination hotspots  across the genome of  <dig> isolates sampled from  <dig> fields. tajima’s d values  were calculated and shown for all recombination hotspots. the outer circle shows the distribution of  <dig> snps in blue. chromosomes are shown in different colors with a scale of  <dig> mbp

neutral or non-neutral mutations
we used tajima’s d test to determine the type and strength of selection operating in genomic regions that were in recombination hotspots. measures of selection were based on departures of snp allele frequencies from neutral expectations  <cit> . a small number of regions had small positive values . the chromosome-wide tajima’s d values ranged from − <dig>   to − <dig>  . the selection hotspots in the combined population had d values ranging from − <dig>  to  <dig> . high negative values are consistent with selective sweeps while high positive values are consistent with balancing selection.

discussion
population differentiation
we used radseq to conduct the first population genomics study in fg ss. though geographical distances among the  <dig> field populations ranged from ~ <dig> to 540 km, the overall population differentiation in germany was very low , consistent with high gene flow across germany and indicating that the individual field populations are part of a single metapopulation. zeller et al.  <cit>  reported a similar genetic structure when comparing  <dig> isolates from two field populations in kansas and one in minnesota separated by ~70–900 km using  <dig> aflp markers. these findings stand in contrast to another study that included over  <dig> isolates of fg ss sampled over a spatial scale of ~330–1670 km, that found significant divergence among populations in the upper midwest of the usa for  <dig> polymorphic rflp probes  <cit> . significant population subdivision  was also found for chemotypes in the north american populations based on nine variable number of tandem repeat  markers using  <dig> isolates  <cit> .

in an earlier study using the same german isolates, we reported much higher fst values   <cit> . we believe that the different outcomes of the two studies reflect differences in the types and numbers of markers used  <cit>  and their distribution across the genome. the earlier study used  <dig> ssr markers that were unevenly distributed across the genome. the ssr alleles were separated using 3 % agarose gels, a method that is prone to scoring error due to imprecise binning of alleles. high fst values  were also reported by gale et al.  <cit>  in a population analysis that included  <dig> north american isolates using  <dig> pcr-rflp markers.

population structure
principle coordinate analysis  was shown to be a suitable tool to monitor structure in human populations  <cit> . our pcoa revealed a large cluster containing isolates from all  <dig> populations with respect to principle coordinates  <dig> and  <dig> . the pcoa also defined two smaller clusters; one consisting of  <dig> and the other containing  <dig> isolates. statistical analysis of population structure identified a maximum of three possible subdivisions . using a bayesian model of clustering, a specialized nivalenol-producing population was identified in southern louisiana  <cit> . the groups we identified by pcoa contained isolates originating from different field populations and contained different chemotypes. other studies of fg ss populations in europe identified three different chemotypes without any related clustering  <cit> . we speculate that the small clusters of isolates identified with the pcoa may represent the emergence of new sub-populations that are associated with higher aggressiveness or production of novel chemotypes. a novel chemotype called nx- <dig> was reported in  <dig>  % of 463 f. graminearum isolates analyzed in the usa, suggesting the presence of a distinct subpopulation  <cit> . we performed pcr-rflp  on  <dig> isolates representing all three pcoa clusters to determine if they carried new chemotypes, but found only wild-type alleles.

analyses of linkage disequilibrium reveal high recombination
the pattern of ld across a genome reflects a population’s history, including the effects of genetic drift, selection, recent population admixture and frequency of recombination  <cit> . the correlation between physical distance and linkage disequilibrium was low in sliding windows of  <dig> kbp . a rapid decay in ld to less than r2 =  <dig>  was found within a distance of ~600–1000 bp for different chromosomes. a similar rapid decay of ld was reported across a 10 bp scale on autosomes and across a 30 bp scale on the x chromosome of drosophila melanogaster  <cit>  and within ~ 600 bp in wild nematode populations  <cit> . in some human populations, the ld decays within a few kbp  <cit> . the rapid decay of ld we observed in field populations of f. graminearum is consistent with a high degree of recombination in these populations. similar findings of very low ld and frequent recombination were reported  for the close relative f. culmorum using multilocus sequence typing of  <dig> isolates from australia, west africa/north asia, and europe . fst was  <dig>  among these populations, similar to our results. in our dataset, some snps on chromosome  <dig> maintained moderate ld  despite being separated by long physical distances . this may result from epistatic selection acting on the sites in disequilibrium  or could result from inversions  <cit> .

evidence of sexual recombination
the importance of sexual recombination is cryptic for many homothallic fungi  <cit> , yet understanding a pathogen’s reproductive system can affect disease management strategies. the index of association  can provide insight into the relative contributions of sexual and asexual reproduction in a population  <cit> . a mixed reproductive system was hypothesized in fg populations from southern louisiana and the gulf coast based on analyzing  <dig> pcr-rflp loci in  <dig> isolates  <cit> . our results indicate varying degrees of recombination among the german field populations  and also among chromosomes within individual field populations . the combined population had a very small ia value of  <dig> , but this value was significant at p =  <dig> . a similar value of multilocus linkage disequilibrium  was reported in chinese populations  of fg ss using  <dig> vntr markers  <cit> . the individual german field populations showed an overall pattern consistent with recurring cycles of sexual recombination, with some populations at linkage equilibrium across all chromosomes , but others had significant disequilibrium on one or two chromosomes . though the overall value of rd was low , hoh <dig> exhibited significant disequilibrium across all chromosomes even after applying a bonferroni correction. we postulate that this reflects recent population admixture. hoh <dig> was sampled from naturally infected wheat within an experimental research station operated by university of hohenheim. the naturally infected field included in our analyses was located near an artificially infected field that was inoculated with strains from across germany, hence we expect that some ascospore movement among fields would introduce inoculated strains into our sampled field, generating a significant degree of population admixture. overall, we believe that most of the observed disequilibrium in the combined population as well as the individual field populations likely reflects admixture rather than a significant degree of asexual reproduction within the german field populations.

hot spots of recombination and selection
different degrees of recombination  were measured among chromosomes in different field populations . these findings are in agreement with previous work of gale et al.  <cit>  that reported differences in chromosome-wide recombination rates in different genomic regions based on an analysis of  <dig> fg ss progeny using  <dig> genetic markers. an analysis of  <dig>  snps between the two reference isolates of fg ss  also identified recombination hotspots  <cit> . the earlier analyses also found the highest recombination rate on chromosome  <dig>  in agreement with our findings , but our analyses provided much finer resolution of hotspots compared to the earlier studies by combining a large number of wild-type field strains with a large number of markers. we identified ~ <dig> recombination hotspots characterized by  <dig>  × 10− <dig> to  <dig>  × 10− <dig> crossovers/bp/generation. tsai et al.  <cit>  reported the persistence over evolutionary time of hotspots in yeast by comparing the hotspot positions in saccharomyces cerevisiae and s. paradoxus, finding shared recombination hotspots with 9–45 × 10− <dig> crossovers/bp. we detected several shared recombination hotspots among the individual field populations when they were analyzed individually .

analyses of nucleotide diversity can be used to infer processes affecting population evolution, based on deviations from the null hypothesis of neutral variation in an isolated population of constant size. we tested for departures from neutrality using tajima’s d test . generally, positive values of tajima’s d are interpreted to indicate balancing selection and/or decreasing population size, values near zero indicate neutrality, and negative values indicate an excess of rare alleles resulting from a selective sweep combined with recent population expansion or purifying selection  <cit> . significance thresholds for tajima’s d are usually chosen as values greater than + <dig> or lower than − <dig>  none of our d estimates reached this significance threshold, but this does not mean that selection is not operating in the genomic regions covered by our radseq dataset. in a recent radseq study on three malaria vectors , tajima’s d values ranged between − <dig>  and  <dig>  and a t-test was used to show that the region with the highest negative value had been affected by a selective sweep  <cit> . genome regions with high negative d values may be interesting candidates for resequencing studies to determine if genes in these regions have experienced recent selective sweeps as a result of local adaptation, for example as a response to fungicide applications, or changes in cultivars or crop rotations  <cit> . recombination hotspots can develop in important genomic regions carrying favorable mutations  <cit> . the recombination hotspots identified in our analysis were enriched  for genes encoding dna repair and membrane transport .

CONCLUSIONS
we found that field populations of fusarium graminearum in germany belong to a single, highly recombined meta-population. we identified ~ <dig> recombination hotspots in this german meta-population. the high recombination rate observed across the genome coupled with the high gene flow observed among populations may enable fg ss to adapt to a broad array of environmental stresses, including climate warming, deployment of resistant cultivars and fungicide applications. this study provides a baseline measure of recombination in natural field populations and a first indication of genomic regions that may be under selection. the low ld found over short physical distance coupled with a lack of population structure among these field populations of fg ss optimizes all the parameters needed to perform a genome wide association study using these isolates.
