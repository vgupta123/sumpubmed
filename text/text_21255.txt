BACKGROUND
reprogramming of adult somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem  cells by overexpression of a defined set of transcription factors represents a significant breakthrough in stem cell research  <cit> . one important prerequisite for scientific and therapeutic application of ips cells is that they can efficiently differentiate into specific functionally and molecularly intact cell lineages. initial studies have demonstrated that diverse types of mature cell derivatives of all three embryonic germ layers can be differentiated from ips cells  <cit> . among these differentiated cells, cardiomyocytes  represent the most intensively studied cell type  <cit> . detailed electrophysiological analyses of murine  <cit>  and human  <cit>  ips cell-derived cms  demonstrated that they are functionally intact and have similar properties to cms derived from conventional es cells .

although comparisons between ips cells and conventional es cells revealed that they have highly similar growth characteristics, gene expression profiles, epigenetic status and developmental potential  <cit> , recent comprehensive analyses of various undifferentiated es and ips cell lines showed that ips cells may not be perfectly identical to conventional es cells at the molecular level  <cit> . these studies demonstrated that ips cells are characterized by a unique gene and mirna expression signature as well as a cpg methylation pattern, which distinguish them from es cells. however, the comparison of global transcriptomes of mature cells differentiated from es and ips cells has not yet been performed, and it is not clear whether molecular differences between ips and es cells are retained upon their differentiation into mature cells.

full transcriptional profiles of human es-cms have been reported by several groups. synnergren and coworkers differentiated the human es cell line sa <dig> to cardiac lineage in an embryoid body  system and cms were enriched by mechanical dissection of spontaneously beating clusters   <cit> . the results of this study indicated that human es-bcs, despite being composed of different cell types, are highly enriched for cm-specific transcripts and display high similarities to human fetal heart tissue. cao and coworkers reported the transcriptional profile of percoll density gradient-enriched human h <dig> es-cms that were isolated by centrifugation to a purity of about 45%  <cit> , and most recently, microarray analyses were carried out with highly purified cms  that were generated by drug selection from the transgenic human es cell line hes <dig>  <cit>  and h <dig>  <cit> . these studies provide the first comprehensive characterization of the molecular signature of purified human es-cms revealing high similarities between expression profiles of es-cms and human native cms.

the purpose of this study was to determine the degree of molecular similarity between cms and other differentiated cell types present in microdissected bcs derived from human ips cells and conventional es cells. our data indicates that ips-bcs are transcriptionally highly similar to es-bcs. however, ips-bcs appear to share some somatic cell signature with undifferentiated ips cells and express higher levels of transcripts encoding for some extracellular matrix components and cell adhesion molecules than es-bcs. this expression profile may reflect either the differential cellular composition or activity in ips- and es-bcs, partial retention of genetic signature of somatic cells in differentiated ips cell-derivatives, or both. these findings emphasize the necessity for a careful assessment of the differentiation capacity of ips cells of various somatic cell origins and molecular profiles of specific mature ips and es cell-derivatives, so as to determine whether any alterations may exist that could affect their use for regenerative medicine and research.

RESULTS
cardiac differentiation of human ips and es cells
the human ips cell line derived from foreskin fibroblasts, clone  <dig> ,  <cit>  and the human es cell line hes- <dig> were differentiated to cms using the end <dig> co-culture system  <cit>  . upon inducing differentiation, spontaneously contracting clusters were first observed at day  <dig> in cultures of both cell lines. at day  <dig> of differentiation, the fraction of clusters that exhibited spontaneous contractions in ips and es cell cultures was  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, respectively , . with further cultivation no additional beating areas appeared. in bcs derived from ips and es cells the cms represented, respectively,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of all cells .

the contraction rates of these bcs were similar in ips and es cell cultures , . these data indicate that the ips cell line foreskin c <dig> differentiates to cms at rates comparable to the es cell line hes- <dig> and possesses similar beating characteristics.

expression of cardiospecific genes and sarcomeric proteins in bcs
to confirm the presence of cms in bcs isolated from differentiating ips and es cells we examined the expression of cardiospecific markers using qrt-pcr  and immunocytochemistry. the data on expression of the endogenous and viral pluripotency marker oct <dig> in undifferentiated and differentiated ips and es cells is discussed in additional file  <dig> . the expression of mrnas for transcription factors nkx <dig>  and gata <dig>  and the cardiac structural proteins myosin light chain  <dig> ventricular isoform , α-actinin  and α-myosin heavy chain  was undetectable or very low in undifferentiated cells . however, their expression was strongly upregulated in bcs at day  <dig> of differentiation . the specific marker of skeletal muscle, myosin heavy chain  <dig> , was not detectable in these aggregates . similar levels of the cardiac genes in microdissected bcs of both cell types indicate that they contain comparable amounts of cms, which is in agreement with the cm-counting data in the additional file  <dig>  figure s2b. immunocytochemical analyses revealed that cms in day  <dig> ips- and es-bcs stain positively for cardiac proteins α-actinin and troponin t  and display typical pattern of cross-striations indicative of sarcomeric organization in cms . the highly ordered striated pattern is highlighted in high resolution images and clearly recapitulates the normal architecture of the contractile apparatus in functional cms.

intact adrenergic and muscarinergic signaling in ips-cms
mea measurements were performed to verify the functional integrity of cms in microdissected bcs. in the absence of pharmacological stimulation, ips-cms and es-cms exhibited similar spontaneous electrical activity with the field potential  frequencies of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hz  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hz , respectively . application of β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol  significantly increased the basal fp frequency in both cell populations to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hz  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hz , whereas the treatment with the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol  led to its reduction in ips-bcs and es-bcs to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hz  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hz , respectively . these results suggest that ips-cms express functional β-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors and their associated signaling pathways in a manner indistinguishable from es-cms.

spontaneous ca2+ transients in ips-cms
to further characterize the functional properties of ips-cms, we have compared spontaneous ca2+ release in bcs of human es and ips origin using fluorometric ca2+ imaging with fura- <dig> am . both cell types showed rhythmic ca2+ transients with identical baseline and amplitude, maximum upstroke- and maximum decay velocity, time to peak, total transient time and time to half peak relaxation . simultaneous observation of contractions and ca2+ transients revealed that each ca2+ transient was accompanied by a single contraction of the examined ips- and es-bcs, being indicative of an intact cardiac excitation-contraction coupling . in order to determine whether functional ca2+ stores in the sarcoplasmic reticulum  are expressed in ips-cms we investigated the effects of caffeine on the cells. in all experiments increased beating frequency was observed due to the mechanical stimulation caused by the control tyrode perfusion with the 'puff'-device . upon caffeine application an additional short-term increase of the frequency of spontaneous ca2+-release occurred . concomitantly, the magnitude of the transients decreased and the basal ca2+ level increased . increased ca2+ levels in a transient response to caffeine indicate the presence of functional sr ca2+-stores in ips-cms.

comparative global transcriptome analysis
functional analyses presented above and those reported by others  <cit>  indicate that ips-cms are electrophysiologically highly similar to those of their es cell counterparts. to establish whether this functional similarity is mirrored at the molecular level, we compared the global gene expression profiles of undifferentiated es and ips cells and beating areas of differentiated ips and es cells microdissected at day  <dig> of differentiation. fetal  and adult human hearts  were included to serve as positive controls for cardiac transcripts. samples used for transcriptional analyses are described in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  all data have been deposited in ncbi's gene expression omnibus and are accessible through geo series accession number gse <dig> http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token=tzqzjeawkmamedu&acc=gse  <dig>  among expressed transcripts,  <dig> probe sets  were identified as variable across samples . principal component analysis  with this data set showed that samples cluster in four groups corresponding to a) undifferentiated es and ips cells, b) microdissected es- and ips-bcs, c) fetal heart and d) adult heart . hierarchical clustering also showed that undifferentiated ips cells cluster together with undifferentiated es cells and ips-bcs together with es-bcs . the transcriptional profiles of fh and ah were more related to those of ips-bcs and es-bcs than to those of their undifferentiated counterparts. furthermore, scatter-plot analysis of every probe set on the array further emphasized a close correlation of gene expression levels between ips and es cells  as well as between ips-bcs and es-bcs  . in contrast, correlation between ips cells and ips-bcs as well as between undifferentiated es cells and es-bcs was significantly lower . a closer look at differentially expressed genes  revealed that only  <dig> probe sets  significantly differ in their expression levels between es and ips cells and only  <dig> probe sets  were differentially expressed between es-bcs and ips-bcs . complete lists of up- and down-regulated genes in these comparisons are provided in additional file  <dig>  and additional file  <dig> .

genes commonly upregulated in ips cells and ips-bcs
in order to determine whether any of the  <dig> unique transcripts found to be overexpressed in ips cells in ips- versus es-cell comparison also remain overexpressed in ips-bcs compared to es-bcs we searched for overlapping genes in these two lists of overexpressed genes and found that among  <dig> unique ips cell-enriched transcripts  <dig>  were also present on the list of  <dig> ips-bc-enriched transcripts . using fisher's exact test we have determined that this overlap was highly statistically significant . moreover,  <dig>  of these overlapping transcripts remained expressed at similar levels in undifferentiated ips cells and differentiated ips-bcs . the gene ontology  analysis of ips cell-upregulated transcripts did not reveal significant enrichment for any go-term in this group of genes .

 <dig> genes with names depicted in bold are expressed at similar levels in ips cells and ips cell-derived beating clusters .

 <dig> the p-value of >  <dig>  indicates that the differences in gene expression levels in comparisons ips vs ips-bc and es vs es-bc was not statistically significant. for differentially expressed genes in these comparisons the exact p-value is indicated. all genes in this table were differentially expressed  in comparisons ips vs es and ips-bc vs es-bc.

 <dig> overlap with ips cell-specific genes reported by chin et al.  <cit>  and/or marchetto et al.  <cit>  is indicated. two genes  in this table were reported to be overexpressed in human ips cells by both groups. one gene  from our list was reported to be overexpressed in both early and late passage ips cells by chin et al. . the gene tmbim <dig> was found to be overexpressed only in late passage ips cells  by chin et al. . all other probe sets in this table were detected only in early passage ips cells  by chin et al. .

verification of these microarray data with quantitative pcr revealed that out of  <dig> genes selected from this list  <dig> genes  were expressed at very low levels or not at all in es cells and es-bcs, but were highly upregulated in ips cells and ips-bcs . interestingly, all of these  <dig> ips/ips-bc-enriched genes were also strongly expressed in fibroblasts used for reprogramming, their expression levels in fibroblasts being similar to those in ips cells and ips-bcs . these data suggest that this group of genes may belong to fibroblast specific-genes that could not be repressed in the process of reprogramming and still remain upregulated in ips cells. indeed, two recent studies demonstrated that ips cells are characterized by a unique gene expression signature, which distinguishes them from es cells  <cit> . by comparing these data with our list of  <dig> transcripts upregulated in ips cells and ips-bcs we found that  <dig> of these transcripts  were also detected in these previous studies to be specifically expressed in multiple human ips cell lines in comparison with various es cell lines . thus, ips cell-signature genes appear to be specifically expressed in ips-bcs but not es-bcs.

gene ontology analysis of genes upregulated in ips-bcs vs es-bcs
in order to determine which biological terms are enriched in ips-bcs compared to es-bcs, we have performed a functional annotation clustering analysis of  <dig> unique transcripts that were found to be upregulated in ips-bcs . considering only the significant go-terms with the p-value <  <dig>  this analysis revealed the overrepresentation in ips-bcs of functional categories related to collagen, extracellular matrix, cell adhesion and tissue development and morphogenesis . genes in these categories included various types of collagens  and other extracellular matrix components , cell surface proteins involved in cell-cell interactions  and a variety of transcription factors involved in tissue development and morphogenesis . these transcripts were increased in ips-bcs vs es-bcs in average by  <dig>  ±  <dig>  -fold . since these transcripts are expressed by specific cell types  or involved in specific biological processes , these findings indicate that transcriptional differences between ips-bcs and es-bcs may partially occur due to higher abundance  of specific non-cardiac cell types in these clusters.

go-terms that were significantly overrepresented  and genes included in each category are shown. the go-terms shown in this table all belong to the same annotation cluster with the enrichment score of  <dig> .

microarray analysis of human es cell- and cm-specific and enriched genes
we have further compared the expression levels of selected transcripts known to be specifically expressed or enriched in undifferentiated es cells or cms.  <dig> % of human es cell-specific or -enriched genes were expressed at similar levels in ips and es cells . furthermore,  <dig> % of  <dig> cardiac specific or enriched genes were expressed at similar levels in ips-bcs and es-bcs and out of  <dig> bc- or cm-associated genes identified in previous studies  <cit>   <dig>  were enriched to a similar extent in both ips-bcs and es-bcs in our study . further elaboration of these microarray data is given in the additional file  <dig>  supplementary results.

microarray data were validated by comparative qpcr analysis of undifferentiated ips and es cells with human embryonic stem cell  <dig> stellarray™ qpcr array . this analysis revealed that  <dig> genes  were detected with both methods as being expressed at undistinguishable levels in es and ips cells  .

comparison of transcriptional profiles between undifferentiated and differentiated ips and es cells
while transcriptomes of bcs derived from ips and es cells were highly similar, as many as  <dig>  and  <dig> probe sets  were differentially expressed between undifferentiated ips cells and ips-bcs and between undifferentiated es cells and es-bcs, respectively . among the most upregulated genes in ips-bcs and es-bcs were known cardiac genes and the most downregulated genes in both types of bcs belonged to pluripotency markers. more extensive discussion on this subject is provided in the supplementary results  and the lists of differentially expressed genes can be found in additional file  <dig>  tables s16-s <dig>  functional annotation analysis was performed in david to identify the most important biological processes that are significantly enriched in ips- and es-bcs compared to their undifferentiated counterparts. taking into account only the go-terms that had more than  <dig> genes and p-value <  <dig>  this analysis revealed that in categories biological process, molecular function, cellular component and kegg pathway the overlap between terms enriched in ips-bcs and es-bcs was highly significant as determined by fisher's exact test . among the most enriched go-terms related to cardiomyocytes were heart development, blood vessel and muscle tissue development, myofibril assembly, muscle contraction, ecm structural constituent, calcium ion binding, actin binding, contractile fiber, myofibril, sarcomere, actin cytoskeleton, collagen, z disc, i band and a band, focal adhesion, dilated, hyperthrophic and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, and alk pathway in cardiac myocytes . however, a number of go-terms were differentially enriched between ips-bcs and es-bcs. for example, in the category biological process the ips-bcs but not es-bcs were enriched for go-terms such as kidney development, mesenchyme development, angiogenesis, neural crest cell development, central nervous system development and others, while es-bcs were enriched, among others, for go-terms sarcomere organization, muscle thin filament assembly, heart septum morphogenesis and skeletal myofibril assembly . although these differences may reflect a certain degree of heterogeneity in cellular composition of ips- and es-bcs, most categories were enriched in both ips-bcs and es-bcs to the same extent, suggesting that they are very similar.

discussion
in this study we show that global gene expression profiles of functionally intact cms and other differentiated cell types enriched in microdissected ips-bcs and es-bcs are highly similar. cardiac specific genes identified in previous reports using enriched  <cit>  or highly purified human es-cm-preparations  <cit>  were similarly expressed in both ips-bcs and es-bcs and only a few percent of transcripts classified as present among all samples were differentially expressed between these two cell populations. the small difference in transcriptomes between ips-bcs and es-bcs was not significantly greater than the difference between undifferentiated ips and es cells or between different es cell or different ips cell lines as reported by others  <cit> .

of interest is the observation that  <dig> % of transcripts  that were upregulated in ips cells compared to es cells also remained upregulated in ips-bcs compared to es-bcs. statistical analysis revealed that this overlap is unlikely to occur by chance. many of these genes were expressed at very high levels in ips cells and ips-bcs but were absent from both undifferentiated es cells and es-bcs. we could not identify these genes on the list of  <dig> genes reported to be upregulated in microdissected bcs derived from human es cell line sa <dig> by synnergren and coworkers  <cit> . however, the significant fraction of these genes  has been found by other groups to be specifically expressed in various human ips cell lines compared to es cell lines  <cit> . in one another comparison, one third of our  <dig> genes was also found to be overexpressed in at least five different undifferentiated ips cell lines when compared to several independently derived human es cell lines . thus, these genes may belong to a unique gene expression signature of ips cells  <cit> . interestingly, many of these  <dig> genes have been found to be expressed in foreskin fibroblasts  <cit>  and this was also confirmed by qrt-pcr in our study for  <dig> randomly selected genes. thus, this subset of genes may represent fibroblast-associated genes that are expressed in ips cells because they are refractory to epigenetic silencing during reprogramming, as suggested previously  <cit> . recent meta-analysis of multiple transcriptional data sets derived from human fibroblasts, es and ips cells also revealed that ips cells share four-times more genes in common with fibroblasts from which they were derived than es cells and fibroblasts  <cit> .

while the retention of epigenetic memory of somatic cells in undifferentiated ips cells may explain a subset of differentially expressed genes in ips vs es cell comparison, it is more difficult to discern the mechanism behind the highly significant overlap between genes upregulated in ips vs es cells and those upregulated in ips-bc vs es-bcs. it is unlikely that differential expression of these genes resulted from differential amounts of contaminating murine feeder cells in bcs derived from two types of stem cells, because ips and es cells were maintained and differentiated under the same conditions for all three respective biological replicates. differential contamination of bcs with pluripotent stem cells is also unlikely, because qrt-pcr analyses demonstrated that the expression of endogenous oct <dig> decreased to a similar extent upon differentiation of both es and ips cells, and sox <dig> could not even be detected in both types of bcs. we have also excluded the possibility that some of the common ips cell- and ips-bc-enriched genes are upregulated as a consequence of ectopic reactivation of lentiviral oct <dig> gene in ips-bcs, because these genes had not been reported to be the oct <dig> targets in previous studies  <cit> . instead, our analyses indicate that transcriptional differences between ips-bcs and es-bcs may, at least partially, be caused by differential cellular composition in these clusters. as revealed by gene ontology analysis, biological terms related to collagen, extracellular matrix, cell adhesion and tissue development were enriched in ips-bcs compared to es-bcs by about 3-fold. it remains to be determined whether higher content of fibroblasts in ips-bcs  is due to specific properties of the ips cell line used in this study or due to inherently better capability of different ips cell lines to differentiate towards cells of their somatic origin. just recently, two studies using murine ips cell lines derived from different somatic cell types demonstrated that ips cells retain some dna methylation signature characteristic of their somatic tissue of origin and that their cellular origin influences the in vitro differentiation propensity of ips cells  <cit> .

the disadvantage of using microdissected beating clusters in our study, which contain cms and multiple other cell types, is that we are not able to provide a definitive answer to the question whether epigenetic memory of somatic cells may still be retained in some mature ips cell derivatives. to answer this question, transcriptional profiles of undifferentiated ips cells and highly purified differentiated cells derived from several ips cell lines should be compared. we have compared transcriptional profiles of highly purified cardiomyocytes generated by drug selection from a transgenic murine ips and es cell line, but could not find any evidence for retention of somatic cell signature in murine ips-cms . the same observation has been also recently reported for murine cardiac nkx <dig> -positive progenitor cells isolated by drug selection from several murine ips and es cell lines  <cit> . in this study, the variability in gene expression profiles that was seen between undifferentiated ips and es cell lines was even reduced in highly purified lineage-specific cardiac progenitors. thus, it is unlikely that cms present in ips-bcs express any of upregulated genes listed in our table  <dig>  however, we can not exclude the possibility that other cell types in ips-bcs still ectopically express some of the genes in this list as a consequence of retention of epigenetic memory of somatic cells. clearly, additional studies with different cell lines and purified differentiated cell populations will be required to discern between these various possibilities.

a significant progress made in the generation of genetically intact ips cells  <cit>  renders the investigation of consequences of transgene reactivation on the physiology of differentiated cells less relevant. the ips cell line used in our present report contain sequences of reprogramming transgenes stably integrated into their genome  <cit>  and this may have caused some of the differences in gene expression profiles detected between es and ips cells. this notion is supported by observation that ips cells generated by non-integrating reprogramming methods are transcriptionally more similar to es cells than those generated with stably integrating viral vectors  <cit> . therefore, genetically intact ips cell lines should be utilized in future studies. however, it is worth mentioning that the genetic integration of viral sequences and incomplete silencing of the lentiviral oct <dig> transgene in ips-bcs as observed in our study, and corroborated by zhang and coworkers  <cit> , apparently did not adversely affect the functional as well as molecular properties of ips-cms. this is in agreement with the observation that ectopic oct <dig> expression in the heart of adult mice did not lead to any detectable alterations of cell phenotype  <cit> . similarly,  <dig> transcripts differentially expressed between ips-bc and es-bcs did not appear to exert a measurable affect on functional properties of cms contained in ips-bcs in vitro.

CONCLUSIONS
transcriptional profiles of undifferentiated ips and es cells have been extensively analyzed in the past. in this study we provide molecular evidence that not only undifferentiated ips and es cells but also their differentiated derivatives contained in spontaneously beating areas have highly similar global transcriptional profiles. minor differences in gene expression that were identified between ips and es cells in undifferentiated and differentiated state did not appear to significantly affect the structural or functional properties of ips cell-derived cardiomyocytes. however, ips-bcs appear to retain some of the ips cell genetic signature partially due to enrichment of specific cell types  and thus may not be perfectly identical to es-bcs. these findings emphasize the necessity for detailed functional and molecular analyses of mature ips cell-derivatives so as to determine the consequences of their expression for the physiology and safety of ips cell-derivatives.
