BACKGROUND
cotton is a major source of natural fibers used in the textile industry. cotton fibers are single-celled trichomes that emerge from the ovule epidermal cells. about 25–30 % of the seed epidermal cells differentiate into spinnable fibers  <cit> . lint fibers of the economically important gossypium hirsutum generally grow about 35 mm in length. cotton fiber development consists of four distinct but overlapping stages, including fiber initiation, elongation, secondary cell wall  biosynthesis, and maturation  <cit> . fiber elongation starts on the day of anthesis and continues for about 3 weeks before the cells switch to intensive scw cellulose synthesis. during peak elongation fiber cells can increase in length at rates of 2 mm per day or more depending on environment and genotype . the rate and duration of each developmental stage are important to the quality attributes of the mature fiber. cell elongation is crucial for fiber length, whereas scw is important for fiber fineness and strength. understanding the molecular basis of fiber elongation would provide a means for cotton breeders and researchers to improve the fiber length while maintaining yield and other fiber characteristics.

genetic mutants are useful tools for studying the molecular mechanisms of fiber development. our laboratory uses two short fiber mutants, ligon lintless- <dig> and ligon lintless- <dig>  as a model system to study fiber elongation . both li <dig> and li <dig> are monogenic and dominant mutations, resulting in an extreme reduction in the length of lint fiber to approximately 6 mm on mature seeds  <cit> . both mutations are located in the dt subgenome of g. hirsutum: the li <dig> gene is on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , whereas the li <dig> gene is on chromosome  <dig> . cytological studies of cotton ovules did not reveal much difference between mutants and their near-isogenic wt lines during initiation and early elongation up to 3 days post anthesis   <cit> . in a fiber developmental study kohel and co-authors observed that the elongation pattern is similar and restricted in both, li <dig> and li <dig> fibers  <cit> . however, unlike the normal morphological growth of the li <dig> plants, the li <dig> mutant exhibits pleiotropy in the form of severely stunted and deformed plants in both the homozygous dominant and heterozygous state  <cit> . the near-isogenic lines  of li <dig> and li <dig> with the elite upland cotton variety dp <dig> previously used in our research  <cit>  provide an excellent model system to study mechanism of fiber elongation.

micro rnas  are a class of non-coding endogenous small rna that post transcriptionally regulate target genes expression  <cit> . plant mirnas range in size from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides. they negatively regulate gene expression by either mrna degradation or translation inhibition . mirnas play important roles in most biological processes such as development, cell proliferation, stress response and metabolism . recently, identification and characterization of mirna involved in fiber initiation and development have attracted much attention. for example, a recent study shows that mir <dig> and mir <dig> might regulate homeologous myb <dig>  gene functions in cotton fiber development  <cit> . another study revealed that mir156/ <dig> family plays an essential role in fiber elongation; suppressing expression of mir156/ <dig> resulted in the reduction of mature fiber length  <cit> . however, currently the mechanism underlying the mirna-mediated regulation of fiber development is largely unknown. therefore, using short fiber mutants for identification and analysis of new mirnas may provide a new insight in fiber development process.

in this work small rna libraries from developing fiber cells of short fiber mutants and wild type were sequenced. gossypium hirsutum tm- <dig> genome was used for mirna structural prediction. we identified  <dig> conservative and  <dig> novel families whose targets were confirmed through degradome sequencing. expression levels of  <dig> mirnas families were extensively tested through the fiber development time course in wild type and mutant plants. correlation analysis between expression levels of mirnas with fiber length of  <dig> diverse cotton cultivar revealed  <dig> mirnas that were significantly correlated with fiber length.

RESULTS

we identified and tested expression level of mirnas in rapidly elongating cotton fiber cells  of li <dig>  li <dig> mutants and wt. the time point  <dig> dpa was selected because our earlier research revealed significant transcript and metabolite changes between the short fiber mutants and their wt nil during this time of fiber development  <cit> . three small rna libraries were constructed and sequenced from developing fibers of li <dig>  li <dig> and wt. the small rna sequencing data were deposited into the national center for biotechnology information  with accession prjna <dig>  a total of  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> mappable reads  were obtained from wt, li <dig> and li <dig> fiber cells, respectively. figure  <dig> represents a flow chart of data processing to identify mirnas and their targets. mappable reads were run through mirplant software for identification of plant mirna from rnaseq data. gossypium hirsutum tm- <dig> genome was used for mapping reads and prediction of hairpin structure of precursor’s mirnas. a total of  <dig>  mirna sequences were predicted in three libraries .fig.  <dig> flow chart of data processing to identify mirnas and their targets in rapidly elongating cotton fiber cells transcriptome



identification of conserved, previously reported and candidate mirnas
we used the term “conserved” for mirnas present in multiple species throughout at least one major ancient clade of land plants. to identify conserved and previously reported mirnas, the  <dig>  predicted mirna sequences were blast searched against the mirna sequences deposited in the mirbase release  <dig>  <cit> . the criteria of the blast search required no more than two mismatches with the sequences in mirbase. in total,  <dig> predicted mirna sequences were identified as conserved or previously reported in mirbase release  <dig>  the  <dig> redundant sequences were clustered into  <dig> known mirna families . eight deeply conserved families were present across all land plants species;  <dig> families were present across vascular plants;  <dig> families were present across seed plants;  <dig> families were present across flowering plants; mir <dig> was detected in eudicots and  <dig> families were previously reported in cotton. six families, including mir <dig>  mir165/ <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  were the most abundant whose normalized expression levels were more than  <dig>  reads per million  across  <dig> libraries . after removing conserved and known mirnas, the remaining sequences were clustered into  <dig> candidate mirna families. additional file  <dig> provides information on loci of the candidate mirna sequences in the tm- <dig> genome of and count of reads in each library.fig.  <dig> deeply conserved and previously reported mirna families detected in small rna libraries from developing cotton fibers of wt, li

target identification with degradome and selection of novel mirnas
given the high false-positive rate of computational predicted targets experimental confirmation of these targets is an important step. degradome sequencing provides a high-throughput strategy for the global experimental identification of targets for mirnas . the degradome library was constructed from pooled rna samples isolated from developing fiber cells at  <dig> dpa of wt, li <dig> and li <dig>  the degradome reads were deposited into the ncbi with accession prjna <dig>  after removing low quality reads  <dig> , <dig> mappable reads were obtained. we used the automated plant-compatible pipeline software cleaveland <dig> to facilitate the interpretation of degradome data  <cit> . g. hirsutum tm- <dig> cdna sequences were used for mapping degradome data . only mirna targets with p-value ≤  <dig>  were used in further analyses. candidate mirna families whose cleaved targets were detected in degradome data were selected as novel mirnas in this study. there were  <dig> novel mirna families that met these requirements .

in total  <dig> non-redundant targets, including  <dig> targets of  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> targets of  <dig> novel mirna families, were identified with degradome . the target genes of known or predicted function were sorted into the  <dig> functional categories based on functional catalogues established for arabidopsis  <cit> . the distribution of the target genes into functional categories is represented in fig.  <dig>  the largest set of genes  was assigned to the transcription category. the most abundant transcription factors  were auxin responsive, ap <dig>  gras, and tcp . genes involved in protein biological processes and cell structure functional categories formed the second  and the third  largest groups . genes encoding structural constituent of cytoskeleton such as tubulin and actin were the most abundant  members of the cell structure functional category.fig.  <dig> a pie chart showing functional categories of the target genes detected in degradome of rapidly elongating fibers of wild type and short fiber mutants



expression profiling of differentially expressed mirnas in developing fibers of wt and short fiber mutants
expression levels of  <dig> conserved,  <dig> previously reported and  <dig> novel mirna were tested by rt-qpcr in cotton fiber cells at  <dig> developmental time points  of wt and short fiber mutants. the  <dig> mirnas for rt-qpcr analysis were randomly selected from the table  <dig>  expression profiles of mirnas significantly differentially expressed between wild type and both mutants at multiple time points are shown in fig.  <dig>  whereas additional file 4: figures s <dig> and additional file 5: figure s <dig> provide rt-qpcr data for the rest of tested mirnas. overall, the majority of tested mirnas exhibited higher expression levels during initiation  or transition to scw deposition  <dig> –  <dig> dpa developmental stages. however, two identified mirnas showed the elongation stage related pattern in short fiber mutants with transcript abundance decreasing at the beginning of the scw stage from  <dig> –  <dig> dpa. the transcript abundance of novel- <dig>  mirna was significantly increased  in li <dig> and  in li <dig> fiber cells at  <dig> –  <dig> dpa, consequently . the transcript level of mir <dig> was significantly increased  at  <dig> –  <dig> dpa, consequently, only in li <dig> fiber cells . the expression level of mir <dig> was significantly increased at  <dig> –  <dig> dpa in both mutants and at  <dig> –  <dig> dpa only in li <dig> developing fibers. n <dig> and n <dig> mirnas were up-regulated in mutants at the elongation  and the beginning of the scw stages.fig.  <dig> rt-qpcr expression analysis of mirnas and their potential targets in developing cotton fiber cells of wild type and mutants. each section represents expression profiles of mirna and its target. the relative expression level is shown on the left y-axis of each graph. asterisks indicate significant  difference in gene expression level between mutant and wild type. asterisks on x-axis represent significant difference in gene expression between wild type and both mutants, while asterisks on top of expression bars represent significant difference in gene expression between only one mutant line  and wild type. error bars indicate standard deviation from  <dig> biological replicates



expression of target genes
to assess the influence of the mirnas on their targets expression, we tested rnaseq expression of all target genes at peak of elongation , and evaluated by rt-qpcr the expression patterns of several selected target genes across different fiber developmental stages.

to test the expression level of target genes we used rnaseq data from  <dig> libraries previously reported  <cit> . rnaseq libraries were constructed from developing fibers at  <dig> dpa of li <dig>  li <dig> and wt in three biological replicates. normalized expression data for  <dig> target genes, including least squares means, log <dig> ratios of comparisons mutants vs. wild type and p-values are provided in the additional file  <dig>  of the  <dig> genes,  <dig> were significantly down regulated in li <dig> and  <dig> in li <dig> fiber cells and  <dig> were down regulated in both mutants . among the down-regulated genes in both mutant lines were plasma membrane intrinsic protein, 3-ketoacyl-coa synthase, two eukaryotic aspartyl proteases, and tubulin. among  <dig> down-regulated genes in li <dig> were six tubulin genes, two 3-ketoacyl-coa synthases, galactosyl transferase, and pectin lyase. among  <dig> genes down-regulated specifically in li <dig> were gras family tf and proline-rich cell wall protein. the number of genes significantly up-regulated in fibers of li <dig> and li <dig> were  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. two genes of unknown function were up-regulated in fibers of both mutant lines .fig.  <dig> venn diagrams of significantly down-regulated  and up-regulated  target genes in developing cotton fibers at  <dig> dpa of wild type and mutants. the total amount of down-regulated or up-regulated genes indicated in square brackets



the transcript patterns of target genes of  <dig> mirnas significantly up regulated in mutants fiber cells at multiple time points were evaluated by rt-qpcr . tfs myb <dig> , nac  and arf <dig>  were identified as targets of mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  respectively. plasma membrane intrinsic protein 2; <dig>  was identified as target of mirna n <dig>  whereas glycine-rich rna binding protein  and 3-ketoacyl-coa synthase  were identified as targets of mirnas n <dig> and n <dig>  respectively. all tested targets revealed a negative relationship with corresponding mirnas expression patterns . the most interesting correlation pattern was observed between mirna n <dig> and its target 3-ketoacyl-coa synthase. the highest increase in transcript abundance of mirna n <dig> was during peak of elongation , which corresponded to the lowest transcript abundance of 3-ketoacyl-coa synthase during the same time points in mutants’ fiber cells.

correlation analysis between mirna expression and fiber length
to investigate the affects of mirnas expression levels on cotton fiber properties, we conducted correlation analyses between mirnas transcript abundance and fiber lengths of  <dig> diverse upland cotton lines. fiber quality measurements were collected during 3 years  of growing plants in starkville, ms field. for this study we used only measurements of the fiber length . rna for rt-qpcr expression analysis was collected from plants growing in stoneville field in summer of  <dig>  twenty above-described known and novel mirnas identified in the study were used for correlation analyses. the correlation results, including pearson coefficients and p-values, are represented in fig. 6a. the expression patterns of  <dig> mirnas, including n <dig>  n <dig>  n <dig> and mir <dig> revealed significant  negative relationships with the fiber lengths of the  <dig> cotton lines. the transcript levels of targets of those  <dig> mirnas were evaluated in the  <dig> cotton lines. as shown in fig. 6b the transcript abundance profiles of targets revealed positive correlations with fiber length. the internal cleavage sites in the predicted targeted genes of n <dig>  n <dig>  n <dig> and mir <dig> mirnas were confirmed by rna ligase-mediated rapid amplification of 5’ and 3’ cdna ends . the sequencing result of ten independent race fragments matched the site predicted by degradome analysis .fig.  <dig> negative correlation between mirna expression level and fiber length of eleven diverse upland cotton lines. the length of cotton fiber is shown on the left axis of each graph, whereas relative expression level of mirnas  and corresponding target  is shown on the right axis of each graph. uhm, upper half mean length, the average length of the longer one half of the fibers sampled. error bars for fiber length represent standard deviation between mean values from 3 years  of fiber measurements. error bars for mirnas or target genes expression represent standard deviation between  <dig> biological replicates



discussion
the causative mutations of the cotton short fiber mutants li <dig> and li <dig> have yet to be identified. in this study we analyzed the small rna libraries constructed from developing fibers of the two short fiber mutants and their wt nil to examine possible regulation of genes by mirnas during fiber elongation. we identified  <dig> conservative and  <dig> novel mirna families in those small rna libraries. different phenotypic changes caused by the li <dig>  and the li <dig>  mutations suggested that mutated loci are different types of genes. expression profiles of a number of tested mirnas were different in short fiber mutants than in wt during fiber development . these results suggested that the mutations changed the regulation of mirnas expression during fiber development. further investigations of differentially expressed mirnas in the li <dig> – li <dig> mutants will contribute to better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of cotton fiber development.

mirnas negatively regulate gene expression by either mrna degradation or translation inhibition. previously, plant mirna targets have been studied via computational prediction, which is based on sequence complementarity between mirna and the target mrna. usually such predictions give high false-positive rates. recently, a new method called degradome sequencing has been successfully established to screen for mirna targets in plants. degradome sequencing provides a high-throughput strategy for the global identification of small rna-directed target cleavage by sequencing the 5’ ends of uncapped rnas . in this study we have described only targets detected by degradome sequencing.

a large proportion of detected targets were tfs , which was consistent with previous reports in cotton . an essential role in fiber elongation has been illustrated for mirna156/ <dig>  in gossypium barbadense  <cit> ; however, our results demonstrated no significant difference in transcript abundance of mir156/ <dig> in developing fibers of the short fiber mutants compared to wt fibers . therefore, mir156/ <dig> most likely is not involved in the truncated fiber elongation caused by li <dig> or li <dig> mutations. in arabidopsis, mir <dig> mediates cleavage of gamyb-like genes that encode r2r <dig> myb domain tfs that have been implicated in gibberellin signaling in anthers and germinating seeds  <cit> . our results revealed mir <dig> significantly induced in short fiber mutants during elongation and scw deposition stages , suggesting involvement of mir <dig> in regulation of elongation. previous studies in arabidopsis demonstrated that the mir <dig> family guide the mrna cleavage of five nac tf genes that are required for boundary establishment and maintenance, lateral root emergence, formation of vegetative and floral organs, and age-dependent cell death . in this study, nac domain tf  was among the predicted targets of mir <dig> . transcript level of mir <dig> was significantly up-regulated in the li <dig> and li <dig> fiber cells while its target nac tf was down-regulated in mutant fibers , suggesting the potential regulatory role of mir <dig> in fiber development.

there are very few studies that have performed a comparison of mirnas expression profiles among different cotton genotypes with the exception of stress-related studies  <cit> . so far only one report explored regulatory role of mirnas in genotype-dependent traits in cotton  <cit> . in that study, the authors demonstrated that mirnas have different expression patterns in different cotton varieties, which implicated their different phenotypic traits. in the current study we assessed whether mirnas expression may be involved in the regulation of fiber length. of the  <dig> tested mirnas,  <dig> of them including mir <dig>  n <dig>  n <dig> and n <dig> had significant negative correlations with fiber lengths of  <dig> diverse upland cotton lines . the majority of fiber mirna studies have focused on mirna identification and expression analysis as well as target prediction and validation . in addition to these observations the present study introduced correlation analysis with fiber lengths of commercially important cotton varieties that can be useful for plant molecular breeding. our data demonstrated these  <dig> mirna families were expressed more highly in the short fiber mutants at multiple time points of fiber development compared to the wt nils .

auxin response factors  were among the predicted targets of mir <dig>  these proteins bind to the auxin response elements in the promoter regions of numerous early auxin-inducible genes  <cit> . exogenous auxin is required to promote fiber cell development from unfertilized ovules in culture  <cit> . genetically engineered increase of auxin level in the epidermis of cotton ovules at the fiber initiation stage substantially increased the number of lint fibers and consequently fiber yield  <cit> . in arabidopsis mir <dig> controls arfs  <dig> and  <dig> expression patterns and affects the fertility of ovules and anthers  <cit> . transgenic tomato plants over-expressing mir <dig> exhibited reductions in leaf size and internode length as well as shortened petals, stamens, and styles  <cit>  that may cause infertility. in a comparative study of small rna abundance between the wild-type and fuzz/lintless mutant, the expression of mir <dig> was significantly up-regulated in mutant fibers compared to the wild type  <cit> . a critical role of mir <dig> in cotton fiber elongation was suggested in another study exploring small rna expression in developing fiber cells from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa  <cit> . our data demonstrated that mir <dig> was significantly up-regulated in the li <dig> and li <dig> fiber cells while its target, arf <dig> , was down-regulated in mutant fibers . also expression level of mir <dig> and its arf <dig> target correlated with the fiber length of  <dig> cotton varieties . this suggests that mir <dig> might be involved in regulation of fiber elongation.

using correlation analysis we detected  <dig> more novel mirnas which might regulate fiber length. plasma membrane intrinsic protein pip2; <dig>  was detected as a target of novel mirna n <dig> by degradome analysis . pips constitute a plasma-membrane specific subfamily of major intrinsic proteins or aquaporins which are associated with water transport and play important roles in fiber elongation. in our previous study, rnaseq analysis revealed that aquaporins were one of the most significantly over-represented gene families among down-regulated genes in li <dig> and li <dig> fibers  <cit> . the higher concentrations of inorganic ions detected in saps of fiber cells of li <dig> – li <dig> provided indirect evidence of reduced influx of water into fiber cells due to low expression of aquaporins and consequently a reduction in fiber cell elongation in mutants  <cit> . our data have shown that the target of n <dig> mirna gh_a01g <dig> is highly expressed during fiber elongation from  <dig> –  <dig> dpa in wild type fiber and exhibited greatly reduced expression in short fiber mutants . the gene product of gh_a01g <dig> has 95 % amino acid sequence identity to a previously characterized pip , and it was shown that suppression of pip2; <dig> expression by rna interference markedly slowed down fiber elongation  <cit> . therefore novel mirna n <dig> represents a good candidate gene for further investigation of its role in regulation of pip2; <dig> and fiber elongation.

the degradome detected target of novel mirna n <dig> was glycine-rich rna binding protein gh_d13g <dig>  this gene has not been characterized in cotton and shows 82 % amino acid identity to arabidopsis glycine-rich rna binding protein  <dig> . the atgrp <dig> protein is regulated by circadian clock  <cit> , involved in response to cold stress  <cit> , and pathogen defence  <cit> . transgenic arabidopsis plants ectopically expressing atgrp <dig> showed a dwarf phenotype due to distortions in gibberellin biosynthesis  <cit> . our data have demonstrated that mirna n <dig> transcript abundance was significantly higher in short fiber mutants during elongation – scw deposition . the transcript abundance of its target was significantly reduced during the same period of time in mutants . therefore the mirna n <dig> is another candidate for further investigations of its involvement in regulation of fiber elongation.

the novel mirna n <dig> showed the most significant correlation probability with fiber length among tested mirnas . the degradome detected target of mirna n <dig> was 3-ketoacyl-coa synthase . kcs catalyses the initial condensation reaction during fatty acid elongation using malonyl-coa and long-chain acyl-coa as substrates  <cit> . very long chain fatty acids significantly promoted cotton fiber cell elongation with several kcs genes highly up-regulated during cotton fiber development  <cit> . our data have shown that the expression pattern of mirna n <dig> revealed negative relationship with its target since the transcript abundance of kcs gh_d01g <dig> was highly increased during cotton fiber elongation  and significantly decreased in short fiber mutants . this suggests that mirna n <dig> might be involved in regulation of fiber elongation by targeting kcs.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified  <dig> conservative and  <dig> novel mirna families in small rna libraries isolated from fiber cells of the cotton short fiber mutants li <dig> and li <dig> and their respective wt near-isolines. fiber gene expression analysis of  <dig> selected mirnas revealed differences in the expression profiles of short fiber mutants compared to wt during fiber development, which might reflect different transcript regulation in mutant lines comparing to wt fiber cells. further investigations of these differentially expressed mirnas will contribute to better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of cotton fiber development. of the  <dig> selected mirnas, the expression patterns of  <dig> mirna families showed significant correlations with fiber length of  <dig> eleven diverse upland cotton lines. these mirnas represent good candidates for further investigations of mirna regulation of important genotype dependent fiber traits. the results of this study will contribute to further understanding of the role of mirnas in cotton fiber development and will provide a tool for plant molecular breeding.
