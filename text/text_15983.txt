BACKGROUND
photosynthesis is a central process in plant physiology, which involves the collection of solar energy via two types of light-harvesting complexes . lhc-ii is the most abundant of these complexes in thylakoid membranes, and consists of pigments  which are bound to chlorophyll-binding proteins . lhc proteins constitute a large family of proteins  <cit> , which includes chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins , fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c-binding proteins   <cit> , high light-induced proteins , early light-induced proteins , the psbs subunit of photosystem ii , and stress-enhanced proteins . cabs, as well as fcps , have been suggested to have emerged from cyanobacterial hlips as a result of two duplication events and the subsequent loss of one transmembrane helix  <cit> , but this evolutionary scenario has been recently challenged by engelken et al.  <cit> . cabs and fcps were frequently reported to be transcriptionally repressed in response to light stress  <cit> .

although cbps are classically considered as light-harvesting proteins, increasing amounts of data point to possible additional functions within this protein family. for example, a number of genes encoding fcps were observed to be down-regulated in a developmental mutant of the brown alga ectocarpus siliculosus  <cit> . moreover, several recent transcriptomic studies of stress response  <cit>  highlighted fcps that were up-regulated in response to heat-, salt-, oxidative-, or light stress in both brown algae and diatoms. within the green lineage, similar observations were made concerning cbps in chlamydomonas reinhardtii after high light treatment  <cit> . the up-regulated cbps were referred to as stress-induced cbps, li <dig> proteins, or lhcsr  <cit> . they were shown to constitute one of several distinct families of lhc proteins  <cit> , and can be found in a range of eukaryotic lineages.

a role of these proteins in light-harvesting seems improbable considering their expression profiles. functional analyses of both stress-induced cbps and closely related non stress-induced cbps carried out in a few model eukaryotes suggest that at least some of these proteins function in non-photochemical quenching , i.e. the dissipation of excess light energy. in c. reinhardtii, the li <dig> polypeptide, unlike other cbps, was shown to be only loosely embedded in the thylakoid membranes and to be localized in stroma-exposed regions  <cit> , and mutants of this protein were affected in their capacity to adapt to high light  <cit> . paralogs of li <dig> proteins in the moss physcomitrella patens , even though not stress-induced on a transcriptomic level, were also shown to be active in promoting npq and to contribute to photoprotection under high light conditions  <cit> . moreover, in the diatom cyclotella meneghiniana, proteins of this family have been suggested to bind diadinoxanthin and diatoxanthin  <cit> , and are important to quench fluorescence  <cit> . in another diatom, p. tricornutum, a li <dig> protein has been shown to be required for efficient light response and to influence natural variability in photoresponse  <cit> . similar suggestions have also been made for li <dig> proteins from the haptophyte emiliana huxlei  <cit> .

in addition to uncertainties about the function of these li <dig> and li818-like proteins, their evolutionary origin has not yet been finally resolved. neilson and durnford  <cit>  argued that, since li <dig> and li818-like proteins have been identified in diverse groups of photosynthetic organisms, they are likely to have been amongst the first eukaryotic light-harvesting proteins. on the other hand, several reports have suggested that these proteins have evolved within the green lineage and were transferred to the heterokonts and other chlorophyll a/c-containing algae during a cryptic primary endosymbiosis event, which involved the uptake of a green algal endosymbiont by an ancestral chromalveolate  <cit> . however, this latter theory, as well as the chromalveolate hypothesis in general, is highly debated  <cit> , particularly because the only genomic data on red algae come from an atypical alga with a reduced genome and without cell wall  <cit> .

the recent publication of the genome of the brown alga ectocarpus siliculosus  <cit>  represents an interesting opportunity to expand on previous work carried out on the origin and function of cbps. the ectocarpus genome codes for a total of  <dig> cbps belonging to different families  <cit> , several of which have already been shown to be induced in response to stress  <cit> . taking into consideration the new sequence data from e. siliculosus, we aimed to explore both the diversity and evolution of this large family of proteins, focusing our attention on stress-induced cbps. first, we examined the phylogenetic position of known stress-induced cbps from different organisms. we then sought to assess structural and evolutionary differences between cabs and the li <dig> family, the latter comprising most of the stress-induced cbps. to this means, homology modeling and structural superimposition of e. siliculosus and c. reinhardtii proteins belonging to the li <dig> clade with a previously crystallized spinach cab were performed. finally, several hypotheses on the origin of the li <dig> family were tested.

RESULTS
genomes of photosynthetic haptophytes and heterokonts code for high numbers of cbps and li <dig> family proteins
an extensive search for cbps in fully sequenced genomes revealed that, on average, heterokonts and haptophytes contain the highest total numbers of cbps , although, within the green lineage, volvox cateri and physcomitrella patens also possess numerous copies of these proteins. li <dig> family proteins are only scarcely represented within the green lineage. they were found in one to three copies in several green algae, in the genome of the moss p. patens, and in est libraries produced for gymnosperms, notably picea glauca  and picea sitchensis . incomplete copies were also found in the angiosperms medicago truncatula  and quercus robur . in the genome of the red alga cyanidioschyzon merolae and est libraries for chondrus crispus , porphyra yezoensis , and gracilaria changii , no gene encoding any li <dig> protein was identified; neither was any homolog found among the available sequences for the cryptophytes guillardia theta  and rhodomonas sp.  <cit> . in contrast, numerous proteins of this family were present in haptophytes and heterokonts, where  <dig> to  <dig> copies were found in the examined genomes. these data indicate the importance of cbps, and in particular of li <dig> proteins, in the marine environment and among haptophytes and heterokonts.

accession numbers for each of the proteins are given in additional file  <dig> 

cabs and fcps contain several subfamilies
in order to establish relationships between the e. siliculosus sequences and other lhc proteins identified in chlorophyll a/b-, chlorophyll a-, and chlorophyll a/c-containing organisms, phylogenetic analyses with cbps from a wide range of taxa were performed. the topology of the tree presented in figure  <dig> is similar to results previously published  <cit> . two groups are clearly distinguishable. a first one comprised sequences only from the green lineage and contained most of the cabs from terrestrial plants . it will not be further discussed here, because it was already considered in detail in previous articles  <cit> . the remaining part of the tree constitutes the second group, which can be split into several major divisions, each comprising sequences from photosynthetic heterokonts and haptophytes, and containing a certain number of subfamilies and taxon-specific subgroups.

the first division to consider was originally highlighted by koziol et al.  <cit>  and was composed of members from the cryptomonads, haptophytes, and chlorarachniophytes. it was named lhcz in absence of any indication on function or localization of this class of proteins. in our phylogeny, lhcz also contained one brown algal as well as several diatom sequences.

the second division corresponds to the li <dig> family , and contains most of the stress-induced cbps. it features three subgroups with moderate statistical support, which correspond to different taxonomic groups. one is formed almost exclusively by stress-induced genes from several species of diatoms, and contains the recently functionally characterized ptlhcx <dig>  <cit>  . another one comprises several e. siliculosus sequences, many of which were induced in response to abiotic stress conditions and most of them are likely to have been subject to concerted evolution and/or to result from recent duplications. effectively, proteins esi_ <dig> to esi_ <dig> are all highly similar and located in close proximity on supercontig  <dig> in linkage group  <dig> of the ectocarpus genome  <cit> . this group also contains one fucus sequence. the third subgroup is the most heterogeneous and comprises sequences belonging mainly to haptophytes and to organisms of the green lineage. this subgroup also contains the li <dig> proteins that have been recently functionally characterized in chlamydomonas and in physcomitrella, and which function in npq.

the remaining sequences were previously divided into two groups  <cit> : one named cryptomonad/red algal lhc clade  <cit> , lhcar  <cit> , and lhcr in diatoms  <cit> , and a second one named fcp or lhcf clade  <cit> . however, in this study as well as in the study of neilson and durnford  <cit> , statistical support for the separation of these two subgroups is insufficient . moreover, the position of these two sub-groups with respect to the li <dig> and lhcz divisions is poorly resolved in both studies  <cit> . we mention these divisions in our study because they correspond to current naming conventions, but the biological relevance of such a distinction is questionable. in contrast, among the lhcf sequences, we identified a well-supported subgroup of proteins containing sequences from several species of diatoms, three of which have been shown to be induced in response to light stress  <cit> , as well as a group of closely related ectocarpus sequences.

stress-induced chlorophyll-binding proteins
one of the questions we attempted to answer in this study was whether all stress-induced cbps, both in ectocarpus and in other photosynthetic organisms, fall into the same clade. figure  <dig> clearly demonstrates that most of the stress-induced cbps from most examined organisms  belong to the li <dig> clade. this is in agreement with the supposed function of these proteins in npq  <cit> . nevertheless, not all li <dig> proteins have been shown to be transcriptionally induced in response to stress. this can be seen for example in the case of the moss p. patens, where neither of the two known li <dig> proteins  were up-regulated in response to osmotic-, salt-, drought, and uv-b stress in two independent studies  <cit> . another recent study in p. tricornutum  <cit>  has shown the protein lhcx <dig> to be induced at a protein level in response to high light, although no changes were observed on the mrna level.

in addition to non stress-induced li <dig> proteins, we also found two cases of stress-induced cbps from other clades. the first of these cases are high light-induced cbps from p. tricornutum. while four of them clearly fell into the li <dig> clade, forming a subgroup with other diatom sequences, three others fell into the lhcf group and are part of a strongly supported group of diatom proteins with a sister group of e. siliculosus proteins. the second case is the red algal protein ccr_ <dig>  which fell into the lhcar clade and which was strongly induced in response to different abiotic stresses: 87-fold induced in high temperature, 21-fold in high light, and  <dig> -fold in low salinity   <cit> . this finding is particularly interesting considering that in public red algal est databases or in the  genome of cyanidioschyzon, we were not able to find either li <dig> or psbs proteins. should the absence of these proteins be confirmed by the ongoing chondrus and porphyra genome projects, ccr_ <dig> could be an excellent candidate for an npq-regulating protein in red algae. in any case, the discovery of stress-induced cbps in different families supports the hypothesis that functions other than light-harvesting may have evolved independently in different cbp clades and in different organisms.

modeling of li <dig> family proteins from chlamydomonas reinhardtii and ectocarpus siliculosus
after having observed that most of the stress-induced cbps belong to the li <dig> family, we attempted to assess the structural and evolutionary changes that have occurred in li <dig> proteins compared to cabs by homology modeling of two sequences of this subfamily, one representative for the "brown" lineage  and another for the "green" lineage . the n- and c-terminal ends of cre_ <dig> and esi_ <dig> were not included in the models because they are too divergent, and only the residues corresponding to residues pro  <dig> to asp  <dig> of the spinach cab were considered. the modeled cbps from c. reinhardtii and e. siliculosus display 58% and 60% sequence similarity, respectively, with the spinach cab, for which the three-dimensional structure has been solved  <cit> . this similarity level was sufficient to generate a reliable 3d model for cre_ <dig> and esi_ <dig> 

the α-helices α <dig>  α <dig> and α <dig> and most of the β-turns are well conserved for these proteins , which was confirmed by the multiple sequence alignment of the li818-like proteins . in these regions, li818-like proteins feature key residues strictly conserved with the spinach cab: asp <dig> , glu <dig> , his <dig> , glu <dig> , arg <dig>  and gln <dig> . the lysine  <dig> is also well conserved or replaced by polar glutamine. almost all of these residues are involved in direct binding of chlorophyll a molecules . the arginine  <dig> stabilizes glu <dig> through an ionic interaction, which coordinates the magnesium ion of chla  <dig>  <cit> .

the main difference in the secondary structure is observed in the loop connecting the helices α <dig> and α <dig> and in the helix α <dig> itself. this region is shorter in the li <dig> proteins  and the sequence composition is completely different , resulting in a significant displacement of the helix α <dig> in the models of cre_ <dig> and esi_ <dig> . all li <dig> proteins feature a conserved signature g-p-a-x-x- in this region. the n-terminal end of this loop is more divergent and the sequences can be grouped according to three types of sequence patterns . these three groups roughly correspond to several subfamilies that could be distinguished within the li <dig> clades . the group including all li <dig> proteins from e. siliculosus also comprises some cbps from green algae  and from moss . in the spinach cab, the helix α <dig> is involved in the binding of two chlorophyll b molecules  and one lutein molecule   <cit> . as shown in our 3d models and in the alignment, the location of helix α <dig> in li818-like proteins is completely different and cannot provide similar binding interactions for these chlorophyll b and lutein molecules. moreover, li <dig> proteins possess a conserved glutamate residue  instead of an alanine at this position in the spinach cab . such a substitution would result in a steric clash with the chlb  <dig>  suggesting that this molecule is likely absent in li <dig> proteins. these structural predictions are consistent with the fact that cbps from heterokonts and haptophytes do not bind chlorophyll b but bind chlorophyll c. similarly, brown algal lhcs contain fucoxanthin, instead of lutein. in the spinach cab, one end of the lutein is bound to asp <dig>  while the opposite end interacts with trp <dig>  which is localized in helix α <dig>  in the li818-like proteins, asp <dig> is strictly conserved, but trp <dig> is missing, since the equivalent region is completely altered . in addition, fucoxanthin is a shorter carotenoid than lutein, suggesting that one end of a fucoxanthin molecule could interact with asp <dig> , but that the recognition of the other end differs from the spinach protein structure. in the cre_ <dig> model, the helix α <dig> adopts a conformation similar to the esi_ <dig> helix α <dig> , as predicted by the conservation of the signature g-p-a-x-x- . this signature is also conserved in other green algal proteins  and in the protein ppa_ <dig> from p. patens. therefore, the "green" li <dig> proteins cannot recognize chlorophyll b and lutein in the same way that the spinach cab binds these molecules  <cit> .

altogether, these analyses support the conservation of the chlorophyll a binding sites in li <dig> proteins. however, these proteins can probably not recognize chlorophyll b and lutein molecules as observed in the spinach cab structure  <cit> , due to the large displacement of helix α <dig> . these structural features raise questions about the nature of the pigments bound in the conserved helix α <dig> region of the li <dig> proteins. in heterokont cbps, these changes in topology could be related to the potential binding of chlorophyll c and fucoxanthin molecules, easily explaining the differences with the spinach cab; in contrast, this hypothesis is not relevant for "green" li <dig> cbps, which are expected to bind chlorophyll b and lutein molecules. in addition, this alteration of helix α <dig> is similar in "brown" and "green" li <dig> proteins, supporting that these proteins have diverged from a close, common ancestor. this suggests that green li <dig> proteins may have evolved in an ancestral chlorophyll c/fucoxanthin-containing organism and were possibly acquired by green algae later.

the origin of li <dig> proteins in different lineages
this latter observation prompted us to reexamine the origin of li <dig> proteins in greater detail. the absence of cbp proteins in cyanobacteria and in an extensive est library of the glaucophyte cyanophora paradoxa  <cit>  indicates that ancestral cbps evolved after the separation of glaucophytes from red algae and green plants . the presence of red-, haptophyte-, and heterokont cbps within the same group is in agreement with the hypothesis that these proteins originate from a photosynthetic organism from the red lineage, and were transferred during secondary endosymbiosis. this event, however, cannot explain the presence of green li <dig> proteins in a branch of the tree  otherwise comprising purely red- and chlorophyll a/c-containing algae. interestingly, very similar observations were previously made for another group of proteins: frommelt et al.  <cit>  found that  <dig> of  <dig> protein sequences from heterokonts, haptophytes, and cryptophytes involved in carotenoid synthesis were closest to prasinophytes and not to red algal sequences. although genes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis and chlorophyll-binding proteins are not related, they are both involved in photosynthesis. notably, the enzymes violaxanthin de-epoxidase and zeaxanthin epoxidase, both of which were closest to the green linage in the study of frommelt et al.  <cit> , are part of the xanthophyll cycle, and thus an important actor in the regulation of npq, just as it has been suggested for li <dig> proteins  <cit> .

to go deeper in the analysis, we tested four different hypotheses regarding the phylogenetic position of the li <dig> proteins by manually rearranging trees and performing statistical analyses. the first hypothesis assumes independent but convergent evolution of li <dig> proteins in the "green" and the "brown" lineages. our results show this scenario to be highly unlikely . while our model cannot account for environmental factors that might favor such a scenario, the aforementioned structural data provide additional strong arguments against this hypothesis. the second possibility was that li <dig> proteins may be ancestral cbps that have evolved in a common ancestor of the red and green lineage  <cit>  and have subsequently been lost in many embryophytes and probably also in red algae . in this case the position of the green li <dig> proteins in our phylogenetic tree should be in reality at the root of the green branch. the fact that li <dig> proteins were not found in red algae or cryptophytes could be explained either by insufficient sequence data for these organisms or by a secondary loss of these proteins. based on the statistical analysis of a tree manually rearranged to fit this hypothesis, this option cannot be clearly ruled out .

a third hypothesis was previously proposed by peers et al.  <cit>  and consists in a horizontal transfer of green li <dig> genes to a common ancestor of heterokonts and haptophytes during a cryptic primary endosymbiosis event. such an event is believed to have taken place before secondary endosymbiosis  <cit> , and could explain the absence of li <dig> proteins in red algae but not in cryptophytes. under the assumption that li <dig> proteins were transferred during this event, we would expect li <dig> proteins to branch early from the green lineage. a tree manually rearranged to fit this hypothesis received p-values <  <dig>  in both au and wsh tests . hence, based on our analysis, this option seems highly unlikely. in addition, several studies have recently provided independent evidence against the "chromalveolate hypothesis"  <cit> , favoring distinct rhodobiont endosymbioses in chlorophyll a/c-containing algae  <cit> . under this evolutionary scenario, it seems unlikely that a cryptic green algal endosymbiosis could have preceded the plastidic secondary endosymbiosis in each lineage of chlorophyll a/c-containing algae.

the last hypothesis, which was prompted by our examination of the structure of li <dig> proteins, was that the first members of this family could have evolved in a chlorophyll a/c-containing organism after secondary endosymbiosis, and that a horizontal gene transfer could have taken place to an early green organism . based on the close proximity of green and haptophyte li <dig> proteins in figure  <dig>  such a transfer could have involved an ancestral haptophyte. molecular clock studies date the split of the red- and green lineage to the late mesoproterozoic, over  <dig> million years ago   <cit> , and secondary plastid endosymbiosis is assumed to have occurred shortly thereafter  <cit> . the same studies date diversification of the green lineage to approximately  <dig> to  <dig> mya, respectively, leaving a time-frame of about  <dig> million years during the early neoproterozoic for such an event to have taken place. this hypothesis does not assume any losses of li <dig> proteins except in parts of the green lineage, and best fits our phylogenetic tree because all li <dig> proteins constitute a subfamily within the group of chlorophyll a/c-containing and red algal proteins . in accordance with this, the phylogenetic trees obtained for enzymes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis  <cit>  could also be interpreted in the same sense, since, just as for cbps, several proteins from green algae  branched within a group of haptophyte and/or heterokont sequences, and not as a sister group. gene acquisition by green algae is not unprecedented. the genomic analysis of micromonas unraveled the transfer of bacterial genes involved in biosynthesis of peptidoglycan  <cit> , and this alga has also acquired several brown algal genes responsible for mannitol synthesis  <cit> .

although the evidence presented in this study is not strong enough to definitely reject hypothesis  <dig> , our findings provide a strong indication against the putative transfer of li <dig> proteins during a cryptic green algal endosymbiosis event preceding red algal secondary endosymbiosis , and favor a scenario with a transfer in the other direction .

CONCLUSIONS
this study shows that e. siliculosus contains a wide variety of cbps from different divisions and with potentially different functions. in all of the examined species, most of the cbps known to be stress-induced belong to the li <dig> family, which is particularly well represented among haptophytes and heterokonts, but also present in several organisms of the green lineage. according to our analyses, the possibility that li <dig> proteins may be ancestral cbps, which have evolved before the separation of the red and the green lineage, remains viable. however, structural alignments and three-dimensional modeling illustrated several elements common to li <dig> proteins, which are likely to interfere with their capacity to bind certain chlorophyll b molecules, but may enable the binding of chlorophyll c and/or fucoxanthin. this finding, together with the statistical analysis of our phylogenetic tree, point to a new possibility not dealt with in previous studies, i.e. that li <dig> proteins may have originated in an ancient chlorophyll a/c-containing organism and could have been later transferred to the green linage. understanding the evolutionary history of cbps may also increase our understanding of the evolution of the different eukaryotic lineages as a whole. if our hypothesis is correct, li <dig> proteins will not be found in red algae. we thus anticipate that ongoing genome projects such as those of the red algae chondrus and porphyra will confirm this prediction.
