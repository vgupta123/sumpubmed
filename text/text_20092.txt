BACKGROUND
disease control and health is central to the production of salmon in aquaculture and more knowledge of the immune system in fish might help prevent infectious disease outbreaks. salmon inhabit a temperate environment and their adaptive immune system is not as rapid as in mammals. therefore, they rely to a greater degree on the innate immune system to combat pathogens  <cit> . a wide range of activating and inhibitory receptors play a role in the innate immune system, of which many are expressed on neutrophils, macrophages and natural killer  cells. these receptors recognise conserved pathogen associated molecular patterns  released from or found on the surface of pathogens  <cit> , and result in the activation of responsive cells. many of these cell-surface receptors contain immunoglobulin-like  domains  <cit>  and several genes have been found in clusters such as the leukocyte receptor complex   <cit>  and the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells  cluster  <cit>  in mammals. the lrc is a very gene dense region, spanning  <dig> mb, which includes the killer cell ig-like receptors , leukocyte ig-like receptors  and the natural cytotoxicity receptor  nkp <dig>  <cit> . the trem cluster on human chromosome  <dig> harbours genes such as trem <dig> and  <dig>  as well as the ncr named nkp <dig>  <cit> . trem receptors are involved in the amplification and attenuation of the inflammatory response  <cit> , while the nkp <dig> receptor activates nk cells  <cit> . all these receptors are type i transmembrane proteins characterised by the presence of a variable number of extra-cellular ig domains of either the c2-type or the novel v-type  <cit> . the ig domains are usually followed by a connecting peptide, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail. some inhibitory receptors have a long cytoplasmic region containing one or more immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs   <cit> , which block nk cell-mediated cytotoxicity  <cit> . the cytoplasmic regions of activating receptors are short and associate with adaptor molecules such as dap <dig>  cd3ζ or fcεriγ via a positively charged residue  in their transmembrane region. these adaptor proteins contain a negatively charged residue in their transmembrane region and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activating motif  in their cytoplasmic region  <cit> .

in several species of teleost fish, receptors belonging to the ig super family  have been reported. these include the novel immune-type receptors  reported in southern pufferfish  <cit> , zebrafish  <cit> , channel catfish  <cit> , rainbow trout  <cit> , japanese flounder  <cit>  and sea bass  <cit> , and the novel immunoglobulin-like transcript  genes described in carp  <cit>  and rainbow trout  <cit> . most nitrs possess a v-type ig domain and most of them also have a second ig domain of the v/c2-type followed by a transmembrane and cytoplasmic region. the majority of nitrs contain an itim, whereas a few contain an itam instead.

nilt receptors have either one or two extracellular ig domains, a connecting peptide, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic region containing the signalling motifs, and are expressed mainly in lymphoid tissues  <cit> . homology modelling has indicated that these receptors have an extra-cellular ig domain structurally similar to the v-type ig domain of human nkp <dig>  in carp, the nilt genes were shown to belong to a multigene family and analysis of the nilt ig-encoding sequences revealed extensive haplotypic and allelic polymorphism  <cit> . several nilt genes have been characterized in rainbow trout  <cit>  suggesting the multigene status of nilt in salmonids. these observations prompted us to investigate the genomic organization and structure of nilt genes in atlantic salmon using a bacterial artificial chromosome  library. this paper describes the first study on nilt in atlantic salmon and reveals the genomic organization of several nilt genes in a single bac clone sequence. in addition, the analysis shows that these nilt genes are tightly clustered in atlantic salmon, with ig domains structurally related to the novel v-type ig domain of nkp <dig> and containing inhibitory signalling motifs.

RESULTS
identification and gene organization of nilts in atlantic salmon
two partial nilt sequences   <cit> , from atlantic salmon were used to design a 40-mer oligonucleotide probe located in the ig domain. the probe hybridised to several bac clones located within contig  <dig> in the physical map of the atlantic salmon genome generated based on hindiii fingerprinting   <cit> , http://www.asalbase.org, of which one  was selected for shotgun sequencing. a continuous sequence of  <dig>  bp was obtained after shotgun sequencing, contig assembling and gap closing using specific primers located in the contig ends . examination of this region  identified four full-length nilt genes  and one partial nilt gene . in the neighbouring contig  <dig>  the putative 5'end of ssa-nilt <dig> was identified as well as a predicted ssa-nilt <dig>  the nilt genes are orientated in both 3' and 5' directions in the bac clone sequence . the open reading frames  of the genes containing one ig domain are; ssa-nilt <dig> , ssa-nilt <dig> , ssa-nilt <dig> , ssa-nilt <dig>  and ssa-nilt <dig>  with each gene consisting of six exons and five introns. the ig domain, connecting peptide and transmembrane region are encoded in exons  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. exon  <dig> also contains part of the cytoplasmic region, while the remainder of the cytoplasmic region and the 3' untranslated region are encoded in exons  <dig>  and  <dig> . introns 1- <dig> are in phase  <dig>  whereas intron  <dig> is in phase  <dig> . the ssa-nilt <dig>  gene encodes the only nilt discovered so far in atlantic salmon to have two ig domains, and containing an additional intron in phase  <dig>  the phases of the introns are highly conserved.

the ig domains of all the ssa-nilts are of the v-type and contain the characteristic cysteines at positions  <dig> and  <dig> responsible for disulphide bridge formation . additional cysteines separated by three amino acids  are present in the ig domains of ssa-nilt <dig>  ssa-nilt <dig>  ssa-nilt <dig>  ssa-nilt <dig> and ssa-nilt <dig> whereas they are separated by six amino acids  in the ig <dig> domain of ssa-nilt <dig>  in the second ig domain of ssa-nilt <dig> they are separated by seven amino acids . these cysteines may form a second disulphide bridge. the connecting peptide of ssa-nilt <dig> contains a high number of serine/threonine residues, 29/ <dig> respectively. twenty-three serine residues were identified using the netphos server  <dig>  http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/netphos/ in the connecting peptide of ssa-nilt <dig> to be potential phophorylation sites . this high proportion of serine and threonine residues is also observed in the connecting peptide of ssa-nilt2- <dig> with 22/ <dig>  15/ <dig>  36/ <dig>  22/ <dig> and 20/ <dig> residues, respectively . in addition, the shannon entropy  was calculated for the ssa-nilt sequences. positions with h values above  <dig>  are considered to be variable, while those with h values smaller than  <dig>  are identified as conserved. the shannon plot revealed that amino acid positions in the ig domain and in the connecting peptide of the deduced nilt proteins could be considered as variable . the cytoplasmic regions of nilts in atlantic salmon range in size from  <dig> to  <dig> residues and the percentage of identity between the nilts varies from 63% to 84% at the amino acid level. the nilts have either four or five inhibitory motifs in the cytoplasmic region, which adhere to the consensus of itims  . these correspond to the nilts found in rainbow trout, which also contain several inhibitory signalling motifs  <cit> . ssa-nilt <dig>  ssa-nilt <dig>  ssa-nilt <dig>  and ssa-nilt <dig> were all confirmed to be expressed either by their presence in est databases http://web.uvic.ca/grasp  or rt-pcr  using cdna as template and primers listed in table  <dig>  we were not able amplify a specific product representing ssa-nilt <dig>  while a product for ssa-nilt <dig> was amplified using genomic dna as template. however, the primers used for amplifying a specific product representing ssa-nilt <dig> were very difficult to design due to high similarity between nilt genes in the bac sequence.

a pseudogene, ssa-niltp <dig>  was identified between nucleotide position  <dig> and  <dig> in the bac clone sequence , comprising a leader peptide, two putative ig domains, a connecting peptide, a transmembrane region and part of the cytoplasmic region . the pseudo gene contained a stop codon at nucleotide position  <dig> in the ig <dig> domain immediately after the last cysteine. another pseudogene, ssa-niltp <dig>  orientated in the reverse direction was identified between nucleotide position  <dig> and  <dig> in the same contig. ssa-niltp <dig> consists of a leader peptide and one ig domain followed by the initial part of a second ig domain, a transmembrane region and the cytoplasmic tail. an exon coding for the connecting peptide was not identified suggesting that it may not function as a true nilt. two additional ig domains, nucleotide position  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> were also discovered in contig  <dig>  both of them containing either a stop codon or a nucleotide deletion interrupting the reading frame.

intron  <dig> from ssa-nilt <dig> is large  and contained a conserved domain belonging to the reverse transcriptase  superfamily. genscan predictions  <cit>  and blastn  <cit>  searches of the non-redundant nucleotide database using the bac clone sequence as query predicted seven transposable elements  two of which belong to the piggybac-like dna transposon family and one belongs to the tc1-like transposon family  <cit> . the remaining four transposable elements contained conserved domains belonging to the rt superfamily.

a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the amino acid sequence of the ig domains of nilts from atlantic salmon, rainbow trout, carp and zebrafish together with human ig receptors . it shows a clear division of ig <dig> and ig <dig> domains as well as clustering of salmonids and cyprinids.

nilt repertoire in atlantic salmon
genomic dna was extracted from a single individual and used as template in ten independent pcrs in order to amplify a specific part of the ig domain. ten clones from each pcr were sequenced and only nilt sequences observed more than once were included in the analysis of the repertoire. eighty one clones were found positive for nilt resulting in seven different sequences and  <dig> singletons at the amino acid level. despite using degenerate oligonucleotide primers designed to amplify ig domains containing either cx3c or cx6c motifs  only ig domains containing cx3c motifs were observed.

of the seven different sequences retrieved, four were identical to either ssa-nilt <dig>  ssa-nilt <dig>  ssa-nilt <dig> or ssa-nilt <dig> at the nucleotide level, leaving three novel ig domains of nilts ssa-nilt7- <dig>  multiple alignment of the amino acid sequences and subsequent phylogenetic analysis revealed a division of nilt ig domains into two different types . group  <dig>  comprising ssa-nilt <dig>  ssa-nilt <dig>  and ssa-nilt <dig>  have ig domains containing a cx3c motif as well as a histidine residue at position  <dig>  a slyy motif located at positions  <dig> to  <dig> , and a leucine residue at position  <dig>  group  <dig>  comprising ssa-nilt <dig>  ssa-nilt <dig>  ssa-nilt <dig>  ssa-nilt <dig>  and ssa-nilt <dig>  have ig domains also containing a cx3c motif, but having a glutamine residue at position  <dig>  a vn motif located from position  <dig> to  <dig>  and an isoleucine residue at position  <dig>  in the ig <dig> domain of ssa-nilt <dig>  which contains a cx6c motif, there was a characteristic glutamine residue at position  <dig> and the isoleucine residue in position  <dig>  the ig <dig> domain, containing a cx7c motif, is significantly different and was included in the phylogenetic tree as an out-group.

discussion
pattern recognition receptor  genes encoding the tertiary structure of an ig domain belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily. these ig containing receptors are found throughout the animal kingdom and several clusters have been identified in mammals  <cit> . a classic example is the leukocyte receptor complex, which contains several gene families encoding prrs having single or multiple ig domains  <cit> . it is hypothesised that they have evolved through duplication to give a wide array of ig-containing prrs within the innate immune system of vertebrates in order to recognise potential pathogenic organisms. in this paper we describe for the first time the characterisation and genomic organisation of the ig-containing receptor termed novel immunoglobulin-like transcript  in the atlantic salmon.

six nilt genes, equally distributed within a bac sequence , were identified. in addition, two pseudogenes as well as two single pseudo ig domains and seven transposable elements were identified. comparison of the genomic organisation revealed a similar structure for the nilt genes, with the exception of ssa-nilt <dig>  which contains an additional ig domain  encoded by exon 2a followed by a long intron 2a of  <dig> kbp . the occurrence of a nilt with two ig domains was also present in rainbow trout  <cit> , in which the intron following the ig <dig> encoding exon in omy-nilt <dig> has a size of  <dig>  kb   <cit> . however, when examining the equivalent intron in dre-nilt <dig> predicted from zebrafish, it was shown to be only  <dig> bp long  <cit>  indicating a more compact gene structure of nilt genes in cyprinids compared to salmonids. intron  <dig> in all atlantic salmon nilts, except for ssa-nilt <dig>  has the exact same size of  <dig> nucleotides and showed >96% identity. the remaining introns differ in length, however, intron  <dig> and  <dig> from ssa-nilt <dig> and ssa-nilt <dig> also revealed a high percentage of identity . between different teleost species the sizes of introns and exons are generally highly conserved , implying a close relationship of nilt genes across species. comparison of the amino acid sequences of the ig encoding exons from ssa-nilt <dig> and ssa-nilt <dig> revealed a strikingly high percentage of identity  . in contrast, the percent identity between the cytoplasmic region encoded by exon  <dig> and  <dig> of ssa-nilt <dig> and ssa-nilt <dig> was only 67%. the lowest percent of identity between atlantic salmon ig domains was seen when comparing ig <dig> and ig <dig> in ssa-nilt <dig> , which might indicate that nilt receptors with two ig domains have a larger repertoire of binding specificities than nilt receptors with one ig domain. so far no ligands for the nilt receptor have been identified, but future work will determine if there is any resemblance to the highly polymorphic kirs in humans, which bind another highly polymorphic ligand, namely major histocompatibility complex  class i  <cit> .

number and type of putative signalling motifs in each nilt are indicated.



the table shows comparison of % amino acid identity and similarity.

two pseudogenes, ssa-niltp <dig> and ssa-niltp <dig>  were identified in the bac clone sequence as well as two separate pseudogenes each encoding a single ig domain. the two pseudogenes have many features in common with ssa-nilt1- <dig>  but ssa-niltp <dig> contains a stop codon in the ig <dig> domain and exon  <dig> was absent. ssa-niltp <dig> contains an ig <dig> domain highly similar to the ig <dig> domain of ssa-nilt <dig> . the initial part of a second ig domain was also identified. however, immediately after the first cysteine in the ig <dig> domain encoding exon, a nucleotide deletion results in a shift of reading frame. in addition, exon  <dig> encoding the connecting peptide was absent.

all nilts identified in the bac clone sequence contain several itim signalling motifs in the cytoplasmic region encoded by exon  <dig>  exons bearing itim sequences are always in phase  <dig>  i.e. the intron-exon boundary does not interrupt a codon  <cit> . in addition, many genes belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily have exons encoding the ig domain that are in phase  <dig>  <cit> , which is also observed in the nilt genes from the atlantic salmon . having an itim-containing exon in phase  <dig> implies that the signalling properties of the ssa-nilt receptors are functional and phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues in the itim motif leading to inhibition is most likely to occur.

the bac clone analysis resulted in the identification of several nilts, which suggests the presence of more than six nilts in atlantic salmon. we carried out a study using genomic dna and primers located in conserved regions of the ig domain. by using this approach we obtained three novel nilt ig sequences  and  <dig> singletons at the amino acid level out of  <dig> clones. this implies that nilt genes in atlantic salmon are a multigene family of related genes. interestingly, none of the  <dig> clones contained the cx6c motif, which suggests that a higher number of genes encoding ig domains containing the cx3c motif may be present in the genome. multiple alignment and phylogenetic analysis divided the cx3c sequences into two groups, having different motifs located immediately after the third cysteine . group  <dig> molecules contained sequences with a slyy motif and a histidine and leucine residue at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. in contrast, group  <dig> molecules contained sequences with a vn motif and a glutamine and isoleucine at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the four residue motifs are located in a loop region between beta-strands c and c', when comparing the amino acid sequence to the sequence of nkp <dig>  <cit> . this observation corresponds to the theory that most variation is detected in loop-regions. future studies will determine if these motifs, as well as the general allelic polymorphism of nilt genes seen in a single individual may contribute to different binding specificities for an as yet unknown ligand. until now only a few ligands have been identified for non-rearranging receptors with the most investigated being the interaction of classical and non-classical mhc class i molecules to kirs  <cit> . nilts have not been identified in any vertebrates other then teleost to date suggesting that this multigene family of receptors are involved in the control of immune responses in fish only and may represent an ancient type of receptor that has expanded in the fish lineage.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this report reveals a tightly clustered, multigene family of novel immunoglobulin-like transcripts  in atlantic salmon. by screening a highly redundant atlantic salmon bac library we have identified and characterised the genomic organisation of six genes encoding nilt receptors. the genes show similar characteristics to nilts previously identified in rainbow trout  <cit>  having highly conserved cysteines in the ig domain and several inhibitory signalling motifs in the cytoplasmic region. in a single individual, three additional and nilt sequences were discovered at the genomic dna level, and allowed division of nilts into two different groups based on a four residue motif after the third cysteine in the ig domain. together with the nilts from the bac clone sequence we now know that multiple nilt genes exist in teleost fish and it will be interesting to discover if and how they differ functionally.
