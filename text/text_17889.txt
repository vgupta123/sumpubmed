BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small  non-coding rnas that have emerged as key players in post-transcriptional gene regulation in plants. they are generated from single-strand rna precursors that are folded into stem-loop structures, and their abilities to bind to complementary sequences of target mrnas results in cleavage or degradation of the target mrnas or suppression of their translation  <cit> . many studies have revealed important roles of mirnas in development  <cit> , adaptation to biotic and abiotic stresses and resistance to pathogen infection  <cit> . many mirnas are also specifically expressed during different stages of plant development and in specific plant organs or tissues  <cit> . for example, mir <dig> regulates transcription factors of the tcp family, which regulate multiple biological pathways, including hormone biosynthesis and signalling for cell proliferation and differentiation  <cit> ; a set of mirnas that affect plant hormone homeostasis and starch accumulation during grain filling in rice has also been identified  <cit> .

starch is an insoluble polymer of glucose residues produced by the majority of higher plant species, and is a major storage product of many of the seeds and storage organs produced agriculturally and used for human consumption  <cit> . several studies reported that the targets of mirna involved in the metabolism of carbon, sucrose, starch, lipid, etc. in switch grass  <cit> , potato  <cit>  and rice  <cit> . for example, mirn45-5p targeted sps  gene, mir <dig> and mir <dig> targeted ss  gene in rice. cassava , a woody shrub of the euphorbiaceae, is one of the most important food crops in the world. it is remarkably productive in terms of its capacity to accumulate biomass and starch, and exhibits extraordinary environmental adaptability. although about  <dig> mirnas and  <dig> mirna families have been predicted and characterised in cassava by both a computational approach  <cit>  and small rna sequencing  <cit> , their potential roles in the production of biomass and starch have never been reported.

we are interested in identifying mirnas and understanding mirna functions in photosynthesis and starch accumulation in leaves and storage roots of cassava. here, we addressed the issues of variation at the level of gene  expression and regulation of expressed genes by mirna in two plant organs . the two cassava cultivars  and their wild progenitor , which was deposited in chinese cassava germplasm garden and used in this study, have contrasting phenotypes in terms of photosynthetic capacity, starch accumulation and yield of storage roots .table  <dig>

RESULTS
identification of mirnas in cultivars and their wild progenitor species
six small rna samples from leaves and storage roots of wild progenitor w <dig> and cultivars ku <dig> and arg <dig> were sequenced using an illumina hi-seq <dig> instrument. new mirnas were identified in cassava in our recent studies. we identified mirnas that did not have greater than 70% homology with any other mirnas in any of the searchable databases, and designated these as new mirnas. briefly, we incorporated the sequencing data to conduct a genome-wide search for putative loci with mirna signatures , and the expression of the mirnas detected was quantified based on the genome sequence of am <dig>  <cit> , as well as annotation in mirbase . a total of  <dig> mirna families were detected, including  <dig> previously reported ones  <cit>  . among these  <dig> mirna families, the presence/absence of members in  <dig> families was conserved across the three genotypes. ten new families, i.e., new- <dig>  − <dig>  − <dig>  − <dig> to − <dig>  − <dig> and − <dig>  were expressed in two cultivars but not in w <dig>  the majority of the detected mirnas were transcriptionally active in all of the three genotypes, as determined by a normalised number of reads . for example, new- <dig> had more than one thousands of reads in all sequencing libraries. in total,  <dig> conserved mirnas belonging to  <dig> annotated families and  <dig> new mirnas from  <dig> families had detectable expression on the basis of the sequencing data . moreover, to confirm the above findings, the expression levels of  <dig> mirna families  were validated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction .table  <dig>

whereas “0” indicates that no mirna is detected in the corresponding genotype/organ, a number from “1” to “11” indicates the number of detected members of the mirna family; new mirnas have names in the format of “new-#”, for example, new- <dig> 

those mirnas with names that are underlined were previously reported by zeng et al.  <cit> .



targets of cassava mirnas
to get insight into or predict the functions of conserved and new mirnas, a mirna target search was performed to identify their putative targets . a total of  <dig> loci on cassava unigenes were predicted to be targets of  <dig> conserved and  <dig> new mirna families , and the remaining  <dig> mirna families had no predicted target. the number of targets of each mirna family ranged from one to  <dig>  for conserved mirnas, and from one to seven  for new mirnas; the target number varied even within a mirna family. among conserved mirnas, mir <dig> had one target, whereas six mirna families  had more than  <dig> targets; among new mirnas, five mirna families  had one target and four mirna families  had more than five. eight genes were targeted by at least two mirnas; for example, myb <dig> and myb <dig> were targeted by mir <dig> and mir <dig>  and spl <dig> and spl13b were targeted by mir <dig> and mir <dig>  many of these targets encode transcription factors; for example, they include the spl , myb , ham <dig> , nac , arf , tcp , grf  and sigma  genes. other mirna targets that are functional genes included genes that encode the agpase large subunit  <dig> , an f-box protein , rd <dig> , a member of the zinc finger family , irx <dig>  and two disease resistance proteins .

most mirnas were highly expressed in the leaves and storage roots of cultivars
the nnr for each mirna should be no less than  <dig>  and if the nnr of a mirna is less than  <dig> then it is considered to be silent . whereas  <dig> mirnas  displayed a two-fold difference in their expression level between the cultivars and w <dig> ,  <dig> mirnas  were highly expressed in the leaves of cultivars, including mir169e, mir <dig>  mir319cd, mir <dig>  mir393ab, mir394abc, mir395abcd, mir399d, mir535b, new- <dig>  new-6ab, new- <dig>  new- <dig>  new- <dig>  new- <dig>  new- <dig>  new- <dig> and new- <dig>  on the other hand, six mirna families were more highly expressed in leaves of w <dig> than in cultivars, including mir156ijk, mir396c, mir477e, new- <dig>  new- <dig> and new- <dig> table  <dig>

furthermore, a total of  <dig> mirnas  were differentially expressed in storage roots between cultivars and the wild progenitor. thirteen mirna families were highly expressed in storage root of cultivars; these included mir156ijk, mir167acdef, mir169e, mir2111ab, mir <dig>  mir399d, mir477cd, new-6ab, new- <dig>  new- <dig>  new- <dig>  new- <dig> and new- <dig>  meanwhile, ten mirna families were more highly expressed in the storage roots of wild progenitor w14; these included mir <dig>  mir171abcdefghi, mir <dig>  mir393ab, mir396c, new- <dig>  new- <dig>  new- <dig> and new- <dig> .

confirmation of mirna:target pairs by rlm-race
binding of a mirna to the complementary sequence in target mrna leads to mrna cleavage. the cleavage sites located at its complementary region  are direct evidence of rna-induced silencing complex -mediated slicing of the target mrna. fifteen mirna:target pairs were selected for slicing analysis using rna ligase-mediated rapid amplification of the 5’ cdna ends technique . of these, nine mirnas  exhibited differential expression between the cultivars and w <dig>  the corresponding primer sets are listed in additional file  <dig>  cloning and sequencing of the pcr amplicons of remnant mrnas enabled determination of the nucleotide position when a slicing event occurred. finally, slicing events occurred in  <dig> of  <dig> mirna:target pairs. the cleavage sites of eight pairs were at the 10th, 11th and 12th nucleotides in the cr . mir <dig> sliced two targets at different sites with different efficiencies: two slicing events at the 10th nucleotide in the cr and seven events downstream of the cr for f-box mrna; there were also four slicing events at the 2nd and 14th nucleotides in cr and  <dig> slicing events upstream or downstream of cr occurred for adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase large subunit  <dig>  mrna.table  <dig>

similarly, other mirnas sliced their targets at the cr. for instance, mir <dig> sliced arf <dig>  with ten cleavage sites at the 11th nucleotide in the cr, and mir <dig> sliced nf-ya <dig>  with six cleavage events at the cr. in addition, mir <dig> cleaved its target grf <dig> at the classic 11th site. for the remaining five pairs, cleavage sites could not be detected at the cr region, whereas they were detected up/downstream of this region. the cleavage sites of mir398:dir-like and mir477:clb were at the +8th and +37th nucleotides upstream of the cr, respectively. finally, the cleavage sites of mir166:gh <dig> and new-12:edr <dig> were all downstream of their crs. taken together, these findings indicated that many cleavage sites were not positioned at the cr or were even far away from it. accordingly, these remnant mrnas might have been randomly degraded mrnas.

co-expression analysis of the mirnas and their targets in leaf and storage root of cassava cultivars and their wild progenitor
to further study the relationship between mirnas and their targets, rna-seq transcription profiling was performed to assay the expression of targets in leaf and storage root among these three manihot genotypes. co-expression analysis involved  <dig> mirna families highly expressed in leaf or root  and their  <dig> corresponding targets. in general, the expression levels of  <dig> targets were negatively correlated with that of their corresponding mirnas, which included  <dig> transcription factors, three plant hormone-related genes and one sut. however,  <dig> targets showed a positive correlation with their corresponding mirnas, including eight transcription factors, four plant hormone-related genes, one apl <dig> and one ctt . in total, there were  <dig> transcription factors and plant hormone-related genes, and three starch biosynthesis- and sugar transport-related genes among these target genes, this might be explained by translation suppression or feedback regulation. surprisingly, some of the mirnas slicing their targets were confirmed, but being positively correlated with the targets; these mirna:target pairs included mir156:spl13b, mir169:nf-ya <dig> and mir394:apl2/f-box.figure  <dig> 
correlations of the levels of expression of mirnas and their corresponding targets in leaf and storage root between cultivars and their wild progenitor. heat mapping was performed based on the log2- normalized expression ratio of cultivar/wild progenitor.



on the basis of the mirna:target pair confirmation and the co-expression analysis,  <dig> mirna:target pairs were chosen for further assays of their regulatory relationship by quantitative real time pcr  in arg <dig> storage roots at different growth stages; the corresponding primers are listed in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  from the results, eight mirnas and their corresponding targets had obvious negative correlations, except for mir160b; most of these mirnas were expressed during the later stage of growth of the arg <dig> root . for example, mir <dig> targets both cassava <dig> _021267m  and cassava <dig> _000867m , which are involved in starch biosynthesis. apl <dig> showed low expression from  <dig> dap  to  <dig> dap, increased from  <dig> dap and reached a peak at  <dig> dap; it then fell close to its minimum at  <dig> dap. in contrast, an increase in levels of mir <dig> at  <dig> dap, followed by a sustained increase from  <dig> dap to  <dig> dap, suggested that apl <dig> was negatively regulated by mir <dig> at a later stage. the second target, sps2f, maintained a relatively stable expression level at the early stage, but then fell close to zero from  <dig> dap to  <dig> dap; this suggested that mir <dig> also negatively regulated sps2f . however, given that there was no negative/positive correlation between mir <dig> and apl <dig> on the basis of the rna-seq data in roots among the three manihot genotypes, the regulation might only have existed in a specific growth stage of cassava storage root.figure  <dig> 
expression correlations of mirnas and their targets in storage root of cultivar arg <dig>  quantification of the relative expression of mirnas and their targets was carried out using the △△ct method, with the u <dig> gene and beta-actin gene as references for mirnas and targeted genes, respectively, and arg <dig> 120d as the control; arg <dig> 120d indicated that the storage root of arg <dig> was sampled  <dig> days after planting, the other samples were labeled accordingly; the y-axis means the times at which the levels of expression of mirnas and their targets in other samples were comparable to those in arg <dig> 120d. a-i: means different mirnas and their targets.



discussion
the initial findings about mirna in cassava were obtained with the aid of the castor bean genome information; specifically,  <dig> conserved mirna families were reported  <cit> , and then  <dig> conserved mirna families were predicted in cassava by using arabidopsis mature mirnas as seed sequences  <cit> . recently,  <dig> potential conserved mirnas in cassava were identified by a computational approach, and  <dig> mirnas  were discovered by small rna sequencing  <cit> . in this study, we discovered  <dig> conserved mirnas  and  <dig> new mirnas  by small rna sequencing, and  <dig> of these families were detected again by rt-pcr. by mirna transcriptome profiling, we identified  <dig> conserved mirnas  and  <dig> new mirnas  that showed differential expression between the cultivars and their wild progenitor. recently, xia et al. also reported  <dig> cassava new mirnas, and part of them responded to chilling stress  <cit> .

we predicted that  <dig> cassava unigenes were targeted by  <dig> conserved and  <dig> new mirna families, and that  <dig> of them  encode transcription factors; several similar results have already been reported in cassava  <cit>  and other species  <cit> . several mirnas are involved in starch accumulation in rice  <cit> , and five of them  also had the same targets in cassava. in addition, two other mirnas  targeted apl <dig> and three sugar and carbohydrate metabolism-related genes , which have not been reported in other species. these mirnas might be key regulators of starch biosynthesis in cassava.

a previous study reported that mir <dig> regulated myb mrnas, and mir <dig> predominantly acted on tcp mrnas in arabidopsis  <cit> . both mir <dig> and mir <dig> shared sequence identity at  <dig> of  <dig> nucleotides, and the expression level of mir <dig> was far greater than that of mir <dig> in two cultivars and the wild progenitor. therefore, similar to the case in arabidopsis, myb transcription factors were mainly regulated by mir <dig> in cassava. myb could function as a transcriptional activator in aba-inducible gene expression in arabidopsis  <cit> , and high concentrations of aba could suppress the expression of starch synthesis genes in maize and rice  <cit> . it was inferred that mir <dig> could directly or indirectly affect starch biosynthesis in cassava.

mir <dig> targeted  <dig> cassava unigenes, including five grf transcription factors. megrf <dig>  was verified to be sliced by mir <dig> in cassava. previous studies reported that high expression level of mir <dig> in root tips might result in reduced expression of six mtgrf genes  <cit> , and that the mir396-grf1/grf <dig> regulatory module acted as a developmental regulator in the reprogramming of root cells during cyst nematode infection in arabidopsis  <cit> . these findings suggested that mir <dig> might regulate root development in cassava.

mir <dig> targeted nf-ya family genes, and over-expression of nf-ya <dig> and nf-ya <dig> or down-regulation of mir <dig> might enhance drought stress tolerance in arabidopsis and soybean  <cit> . menf-ya <dig> was negatively regulated by mir <dig>  and the expression level of mir <dig> in the wild progenitor was lower than that in cultivars, and the evidence was that the wild progenitor had stronger drought tolerance than the cultivars usually.

mir <dig> targeted the mrna of a disease resistance-responsive family protein  in cassava, but the cleavage sites of the mir398:dir-like pair were not positioned within the cr: ten cleavage sites were all at the 8th nucleotide upstream of the cr. given that the mirna-guided cleavage occurred quite precisely at the 10th or 11th nucleotide from the 5’ end of the mirna in cr  <cit> , this might be a surprising phenomenon that is difficult to explain.

CONCLUSIONS
using next-generation sequencing technology, we carried out mirna transcriptome and transcriptome profiling of two cultivated cassava and their wild progenitor. a total of  <dig> conserved mirnas  and  <dig> new mirnas  were identified, and most mirnas were highly expressed in the cultivars. of the  <dig> unigenes predicted to be the targets of  <dig> cassava mirna families,  <dig> unigenes were confirmed. in addition, co-expression analysis between mirnas and their targets was performed on the basis of the mirna transcriptome and transcriptome profiling of leaves and storage roots; the expression levels of  <dig> targets were negatively correlated with that of their corresponding mirnas. in conclusion, the differential expression of mirnas between cultivars and their wild progenitor, together with our analysis of go annotation and confirmation of mirna:target pairs, might provide insight into how the wild progenitor was domesticated to cultivated cassava.
