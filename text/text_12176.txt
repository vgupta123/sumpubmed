BACKGROUND
α--d-glucan phosphorylases  promote degradation of glycogen, starch or maltodextrins by catalyzing glucosyl transfer from the non-reducing end of the glucosidic substrate to orthophosphate. they often serve a physiological function in fuelling the energy metabolism of the cell with α-d-glucose 1-phosphate   <cit> . although categorized as glycosyltransferases  <cit> , glgps are special among enzymes of this class in that their activity is absolutely dependent on a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate  cofactor  <cit> . the plp forms a schiff-base linkage with ε-nh <dig> of an invariant lys in the active site. the 5'-phosphate moiety is the cofactor group participating in catalysis  <cit> . all known glgp enzymes are naturally active as dimers of two identical plp-containing subunits  <cit> . dimeric structure formation results in marked stabilization of the otherwise chemically labile protein-cofactor bond such that plp is not detectably dissociable from native phosphorylase dimers  <cit> . glgp enzymes in which activity is under control of covalent phosphorylation and/or allosteric effectors respond to regulatory signals through extensive rearrangements of their intersubunit contacts  <cit> . the dimer interface therefore is a key element of glgp structure and function. while the overall pattern of subunit-subunit interactions is conserved in glgps, the molecular details vary among individual enzymes  <cit> .

corynebacterium callunae starch phosphorylase  differs from related glgp enzymes in that its dimer structure is highly susceptible to dissociative denaturation in the absence of external orthophosphate  <cit> . we interpreted evidence from detailed biochemical studies of the wild-type phosphorylase in terms of orthophosphate binding at a protein site  distinct from the catalytic site. occupancy of the p-site was thought to result in substantially stabilized intersubunit contacts. results of mutagenesis experiments located residues responsible for orthophosphate-dependent stability in the region of the so-called tower helix, a conserved secondary structural element of the dimer interface in glgp enzymes  <cit> . the crystal structure of ccglgp at  <dig>  Å resolution  now reveals that not one but three orthophosphate sites are dispersed across the dimer contact region of the enzyme. the predicted p-site involving tower helix residues arg <dig> and arg <dig> is seen to bind orthophosphate in the structure. analogous residues from neighbouring subunits in the ccglgp dimer form a symmetrical, highly positively charged interfacial binding site where arg <dig> and arg <dig> are co-ordinating and intersubunit contacts are established through a bound orthophosphate ion . the two other, entirely novel binding sites for orthophosphate are located in the so-called cap region of the dimer interface . dimerisation via the cap helix  is a common structural feature among glgp enzymes  <cit> . although the cap sites for orthophosphate binding in ccglgp show less positive charge density than the p-site, their occupancy with ligand would be expected to also result in substantially strengthened dimer contacts. strikingly, orthophosphate binding at the cap sites occurs near to where regulated glgp enzymes become phosphorylated or bind the phosphate group of allosteric effectors like amp or d-glucose 6-phosphate  <cit> . we thus speculated that orthophosphate binding at the cap sites might be a novel mechanism by which ccglgp regulates or finely tunes its activity. however, the cap sites of ccglgp appear to be structurally unrelated to known allosteric sites for orthophosphate in glgp enzymes.

extensive use of intersubunit binding of orthophosphate to stabilize the native dimer in ccglgp has not been described for other glgp enzymes and appears to generally lack precedence in oligomeric proteins. we therefore used mutational analysis to determine the role of individual phosphate site residues for orthophosphate-dependent stability and activity in ccglgp.

methods
unless mentioned otherwise, all materials used were described in previous papers  <cit> .

site-directed mutagenesis, enzyme production and purification
the plasmid pqe 30-glgp harbouring the gene encoding wild-type ccglgp fused to an n-terminal metal affinity peptide   <cit>  was used as template for site-directed mutagenesis. mutations were introduced by employing a modified two-stage pcr protocol  <cit>  in which the following pairs of oligonucleotide primers  were used with mismatched codons underlined. t28a: 5'-acctcgctgctgatcgcaag-3' , 5'-agaacttgcgatcagcagcgag-3' ; k31a: 5'-ctactgatcgcgcgttctggactg-3' , 5'-cagtccagaacgcgcgatcagtag-3' ; r141a: 5'-tggtctgctctacgccttcggtc-3' , 5'- agaccgaaggcgta-gagcagacc-3' ; s174a: 5'-tcgtgcagccgaccagttg-3' , 5'-tggtcggctgcacgacgaatag-3' . plasmid vectors harbouring sequence-proven inserts  were transformed into e. coli jm <dig>  and recipient strains were grown for recombinant protein production as reported previously  <cit> . protein purification followed a published protocol  <cit>  except that no heat treatment was used. purity of the obtained protein preparations was assessed by sds page. isolated enzymes were stored at 4°c at a concentration of  <dig>  -  <dig> mg/ml in  <dig> mm potassium phosphate buffer, ph  <dig> .

biochemical characterization of mutated ccglgp
phosphorylase activity was measured with a continuous coupled enzyme assay described elsewhere  <cit> . the bio-rad dye binding assay referenced against bsa was used for determination of protein concentrations. the plp content of isolated protein preparations was quantitated using a reported colorimetric method  <cit> .

orthophosphate-dependent stability
activity loss at elevated temperature. protein solutions  were prepared in  <dig> mm triethanolamine buffer, ph  <dig>  or  <dig> , containing  <dig> mm kcl,  <dig>  mm or  <dig> mm k2hpo <dig>  incubations were carried out in  <dig>  ml tubes at 45°c. samples  were taken after  <dig> sec and then in regular intervals, depending on the stability of the enzyme used. they were diluted immediately into the continuous coupled assay of phosphorylase activity. test for reversibility of inactivation involved cooling of the sample to room temperature followed by a  <dig> h-long incubation in the presence of  <dig> mm potassium phosphate, ph  <dig> , and then activity measurement.

inactivation by imidazole. a buffer  containing  <dig>  m imidazole and  <dig>  m l-cysteine hydrochloride was used. k2hpo <dig> or 2so <dig> was optionally added in a concentration of  <dig>  mm. the protein was diluted to a final concentration of  <dig> -  <dig> μg/ml in the above-described buffer, and incubations were carried out at 30°c. samples were taken at the times indicated and residual activity was measured using the continuous assay. restoration of activity in partially imidazole-denatured preparations of the wild-type enzyme was examined in the presence of  <dig> mm k2hpo <dig>  and  <dig> μm plp.

gel filtration analysis
size exclusion chromatography was performed using a biologic duo-flow system  equipped with a hiload 16/ <dig> superdex  <dig> prep grade column . the column was equilibrated with  <dig> mm potassium phosphate buffer, ph  <dig> , containing  <dig>  m nacl. it was operated with the same buffer using a flow rate of  <dig> ml/min. gel filtration standard from bio-rad was employed for calibration. the applied sample  typically contained =  <dig>  mg of native or partially denatured protein.

effect of sulphate on α-glucan-synthesizing activity of wild-type and mutated forms of ccglgp
initial rate measurements were performed in the direction of α--d-glucan synthesis at 30°c using a concentration of  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> nm for the respective enzyme subunit. reactions were carried out in  <dig> mm triethanolamine buffer, ph  <dig> , with and without  <dig>  -  <dig> mm 2so <dig> present. maltodextrin de <dig>  or soluble starch was used as acceptor substrate . the concentration of orthophosphate  released from g1p  was measured in a minimum of three samples taken after  <dig> to  <dig> min using an assay described elsewhere  <cit> . the rate was calculated from the linear relationship of  against time.

RESULTS
selection of residues for site-directed substitution and properties of mutated enzymes
considering results of previous studies delineating the disruptive effect of individual site-directed substitutions of arg <dig> and arg <dig> by ala  on orthophosphate-dependent stability of ccglgp  <cit> , we here selected arg <dig> from the p-site for mutational analysis. figure 1a shows that arg <dig> has indirect interactions with orthophosphate via the co-ordinating glu <dig>  because biochemical data for r242a clearly underscore the importance of the glu235/arg <dig> couple for stabilization by orthophosphate  <cit> , the glu <dig> was not further pursued here. thr <dig>  lys <dig>  and ser <dig> whose side chains co-ordinate orthophosphate at the cap site  were replaced by ala. purified preparations of the mutated enzymes migrated as single protein bands in sds-page, each showing the expected molecular mass of ~ <dig> kda . isolated phosphorylases contained ≥  <dig>  mol plp per each mol of protein subunit. their turnover numbers in the direction of phosphorolysis of maltodextrin  were similar. table  <dig> summarizes the data.

activities were measured at 30°c at ph  <dig>  in a continuous coupled enzyme assay in the presence of  <dig> mm pi and  <dig> g/l maltodextrin . the kcat value was calculated from the specific activity  assuming a molecular mass of  <dig>  kda for the enzyme subunit. plp values have s.d. of < 20%  while activity values have s.d. of < 10% .

orthophosphate-dependent stability at elevated temperature
incubation of purified phosphorylases at 45°c caused a time-dependent loss of enzyme activity that was kinetically first-order  and not detectably reversible under the conditions used. previously reported data for wild-type enzyme and p-site mutants r234a and r242a have delineated a formal kinetic mechanism of denaturation at elevated temperature and indicated that loss of the native dimer structure due to subunit dissociation determines the observable rate of irreversible inactivation  <cit> . note, however, that the phosphorylase monomer is not stable due to release of the plp cofactor into solution, further unfolding and irreversible aggregation under conditions of temperature-induced denaturation  <cit> . measurement of formation of phosphorylase monomer was therefore not considered in our experiments. it was also shown in prior studies of the wild-type enzyme and selected mutants thereof  <cit>  that cd and fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy can be used to portray the structural stabilization of ccglgp by orthophosphate. however, because evidence obtained through the spectroscopic techniques essentially confirmed the results of activity measurements  <cit> , we decided to use enzyme activity as the most sensitive and also convenient reporter of phosphorylase denaturation by subunit dissociation.

half-life times  for wild-type and mutated phosphorylases were determined from linear fits of data recorded in the absence and presence of orthophosphate . they are summarized in table  <dig>  under conditions in which orthophosphate was lacking, wild-type and mutated enzymes showed relatively similar stabilities . we note, however, that t28a was about  <dig> times less stable than the wild-type enzyme. the t1/ <dig> of k31a was slightly enhanced compared to t1/ <dig> of wild-type phosphorylase. interestingly, therefore, the more than 100-fold enhancement of t1/ <dig> that was caused by  <dig>  mm pi in the wild-type enzyme was partly lost in k31a , more so in s174a , and essentially eliminated in t28a and r141a .

the experiments were carried out in  <dig> mm triethanolamine buffer, ph  <dig> . values from linear regression analysis have s.d. of < 10%. representative data were used for calculation of t1/ <dig> 

decreased affinity for orthophosphate binding or intrinsically lowered stability of the protein-orthophosphate complex could explain the loss in orthophosphate-dependent stability of the ccglgp mutants. to distinguish between these possibilities, we determined t1/2for wild-type and mutated phosphorylases in the presence of  <dig> mm pi . t28a and r141a were stabilized by a factor of  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, as compared to the corresponding t1/ <dig> determined at  <dig>  mm pi. enhancement of t1/ <dig> resulting from the increase in pi concentration was 21- and 30-fold in k31a and s174a, respectively, and can be compared to a 13-fold effect on t1/2for the wild-type phosphorylase. because differences in stability among the individual phosphorylases seen at  <dig>  mm pi were, to a very substantial extent, removed at  <dig> mm pi, we believe that it was mainly the pi binding affinity of the respective site  that was influenced by the chosen single point mutations. we did not test higher concentrations of orthophosphate than  <dig> mm because under these conditions, it is exceedingly difficult to distinguish the stabilization resulting from specific binding at a defined phosphate site from another stabilization due to non-specific protein-orthophosphate interactions  <cit> . part of the enhancement of t1/ <dig> for the wild-type phosphorylase upon increasing the orthophosphate concentration from  <dig>  to  <dig> mm could already reflect non-specific stabilization.

the results in table  <dig> show that structural modification of either phosphate site  can result in a nearly complete loss of orthophosphate-dependent stability at  <dig>  mm pi. this finding suggests that the cap-sites  and the p-site  do not function independently one from another, be it that orthophosphate binding at the two sites is truly cooperative or occupancy of both sites is a critical requirement for dimer stability. in the case that orthophosphate binding at each binding site made an independent contribution to the kinetic stability of ccglgp , one would expect that site-directed mutagenesis of one binding site causes only partial disruption of orthophosphate-dependent stability, which is contrary to observations for t28a and r141a.

orthophosphate-dependent stability in the presence of imidazole
assay conditions were used which in the wild-type phosphorylase lead to formation of a stable, monomeric apo-enzyme  <cit> . the presence of the his-tag does not alter the denaturation behaviour of the native ccglgp in the presence of imidazole. loss of enzyme activity in the assay reflects dissociation of the protein subunits and is partly reversible upon addition of external plp  <cit> . results of time course experiments comparing wild-type enzyme and the various mutants revealed that the process of inactivation in each enzyme was kinetically first-order , and table  <dig> summarizes t1/ <dig> values for denaturation by imidazole in the absence and presence of  <dig>  mm orthophosphate. the stability of the wild-type enzyme was slightly lower than reported previously which is explicable on account of a 6-fold lower protein concentration used in the experiments described herein, as compared to literature  <cit> . it was confirmed that addition of plp restored activity in partly inactivated enzyme preparations, and time-dependent conversion of the native r141a dimer into an inactive monomer was demonstrated by using size exclusion chromatography .

with the exception that all mutated phosphorylases, however especially t28a, were less stable than the wild-type enzyme under conditions where  <dig>  mm orthophosphate was lacking, data confirm the overall trend seen in inactivation experiments at 45°c that the mutations decreased the stabilizing effect of orthophosphate in the wild-type enzyme. generally, orthophosphate was much less stabilizing to denaturation by imidazole than denaturation by heat . however, we must consider that, while both methods of denaturation promote dissociation of subunits in the phosphorylase dimer  <cit> , their effects on the protein structure are probably not identical. the disruptive effect of the mutations on orthophosphate-dependent stability was smaller when using imidazole as compared to 45°c as trigger of denaturation.

allosteric effect of orthophosphate binding on enzyme activity?
initial rates of α--glucan synthesis  catalyzed by native ccglgp were recorded in the absence and presence of 2so <dig>  previous work has shown that sulphate is similarly efficient as orthophosphate in stabilizing the dimer structure of ccglgp  <cit> , validating the use of sulphate as an orthophosphate surrogate in kinetic experiments. note the added orthophosphate would have interfered with the assay applied for determination of vs.

we observed a significant enhancement of vs in dependence of the sulphate concentration. figure 4a shows the degree of "activation" of the enzyme relative to the control lacking sulphate. using a saturating concentration of g1p  in the assay, stimulation of vs was a maximum  at around  <dig> mm sulphate and remained constant as the oxyanion concentration was further increased. inhibition by high concentrations of sulphate under conditions where a non-saturating level of αg1p  was employed, is plausibly explained by competition between substrate and oxyanion for binding to the active site. the extent to which sulphate stimulated vs decreased as the protein concentration in the assay was increased, suggesting that the observed "activation" by sulphate was apparent and likely reflected stabilization of the functional ccglgp dimer at the low protein concentrations used in the assay. the dissociative mechanism of denaturation of ccglgp which applies to a wide range of conditions including room temperature  <cit>  implies that the enzyme is more stable at high protein concentrations.

CONCLUSIONS
the cap- and p-sites for orthophosphate binding at the subunit-subunit interface of ccglgp appear to be cooperatively functional in conferring extra kinetic stability to the native dimer structure of the active enzyme. the molecular strategy exploited for quaternary structure stabilization is to our knowledge novel among dimeric proteins. it can be distinguished clearly from the co-solute effect of orthophosphate on protein thermostability resulting from  interactions of the ligand with protein surface residues, often lysines  <cit> . however, treponema denticola cystalisin is an interesting example of a plp-containing enzyme that utilizes hydrogen bonding between the 5'-phosphate of the cofactor and a tyrosine from the respective other subunit to stabilize the functional protein homodimer  <cit> . we have shown here that thr <dig> at the cap site of ccglgp is of key importance for orthophosphate-dependent stability of the enzyme. therefore, although an allosteric effect of oxyanion binding on enzyme activity was not clearly supported by the data, it was nevertheless interesting that an unregulated phosphorylase has accommodated a functional phosphate site in a protein region where the principle of phosphate group recognition was exploited by nature to evolve the regulatory sites in today's eukaryotic α--d-glucan phosphorylases.
