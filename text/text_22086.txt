BACKGROUND
quantitative real-time pcr  has become a widely used method for both quantitative and qualitative determination of molecular targets. reliable quantitative expression measurements depend on controlling several parameters . usually, these parameters are normalized by means of one or more reference gene , whose expression is supposed to remain stable in all the tissues and cells or along the different conditions under investigation. however, since the expression of some if not all rgs varies depending on biological samples  <cit>  the use of rgs is controversial. lee and co-workers  <cit>  proposed that all genes are differentially expressed in at least one biological context, so the expression of every gene would be context dependent. therefore, following the indications proposed by the miqe  guidelines  <cit>  the utility of chosen reference genes must be confirmed by each research group for every experimental setup  <cit> .

the use of proper mathematical methods to estimate the expression stability of genes under specific conditions is one of the most critical points in the search of rgs. in the last years, some efforts have been made to determine the best way to estimate expression stability of candidate reference genes. concerning the former, the pair-wise comparison method employed by genorm  <cit> , the most used software in the establishment of rgs, considers that all the samples belong to one group , and conversely the estimate of the expression stability ignores differences in gene expression level and gene expression variability across groups. on the other hand, andersen et al.  <cit>  proposed a model-based approach to identify rgs, by means of the normfinder visual basic application for microsoft excel. this method estimates the intra- and inter-group variances for each gene and calculates a stability value by combining both sources of variation. another model-based procedure is the method proposed by szabo et al.  <cit>  which also uses the intra- and inter-gene variation across groups but in a more solid statistical framework. in this case, the stability criterion is the mean square error , a measure of variability around an intended value, the overall expression level of a gene. abruzzo et al  <cit>  compared several models including the fixed effect models used in  <cit>  and  <cit>  and models with random effects, showing preference for a model with random gene by group interaction. a model based procedure using mixed models and optimal statistical methods, such as maximum likelihood, to estimate inter- and intra-group variances would then be desirable.

our biological example is the case of the heat-stress response in the ovine species. variations in the environmental temperature usually stress the organism and may result in the evolution of adaptative genetic mechanisms to cope with extreme temperatures. at cellular level, heat-shock lead to changes in gene expression in most  cells as well in a variety of organs and tissues associated with the acclimation response. there are some studies about gene expression under heat stress situations in species such as dinoflagellates  <cit> , shrimps  <cit>  and honey bees  <cit>  in which cal, rp-s <dig>  sam and tub; rps18; and rp <dig> have been used as rgs, respectively. de boer et al.  <cit>  developed a study to detect rgs for various stress conditions in soil arthropods. they found sdha, ywhaz and actb among the most stable genes under heat stress conditions. however, the suitability of genes for qpcr normalization in the field of adaptation to different thermal conditions in mammals, and particularly in the ovine species, remains unsolved.

in this study, we propose a maximum likelihood  mixed model based approach to estimate the expression stability of  <dig> candidate rgs taking the heat stress response in the ovine species as example. a comparison with other classical approaches widely used in qpcr experiments was also performed. to test the impact of using alternative methods, normalization factors were calculated with the delta ct method for the reference genes selected with each approach and used to normalize some target genes.

RESULTS
gene expression and qpcr efficiencies
qpcr efficiencies  of the candidate rgs are shown in table  <dig>  due to technical difficulties, cyp1a <dig> efficiency could not be estimated and its value  was taken from the literature  <cit> . amplification e ranged from 74% to 98%. higher e were found for candidate genes included in the sheep genorm kit , since primers and the pcr conditions must be designed to amplify sequences with e close to  <dig>  genes from lampo et al.  <cit>  showed lower e  probably because their pcr amplification conditions are different from the standard ones of the kit. most qpcr studies use the log <dig> transformed cycle threshold or crossing point , as the expression rate variable, assuming that the e is maximum  and therefore e =  <dig> for all genes. however, tichopad et al.  <cit>  pointed out that e evaluation is an essential marker in real-time quantification procedure and therefore corrected models by this parameter are highly recommended.

maximum likelihood-mixed model approach
goodness of fit criteria , aic  and bic ) and predictive ability  values of the alternative mixed models tested are shown in table  <dig>  full models including the three main effects  and all first order interactions showed both, better goodness of fit and lower pd than models that do not considers any of the interactions. this indicates that such interactions were relevant in fitting and predicting expression data obtained from different samples and treatments. model  <dig> which considered heteroskedastic residual variance linked to the txg effect , showed the best goodness of fit  and higher pd  than models  <dig> and  <dig>  still model  <dig> showed lower pd than the reduced models . model  <dig>  which only differed from model  <dig> in the residual variance definition , yielded also good fit and predictive parameters . on the other hand, model  <dig>  with homoskedatic residual variance, had the worst goodness of fit  and was similar to model  <dig> in pd . model  <dig>  which mimics the approach proposed by andersen et al.  <cit>  showed good behavior in fitting data  but very large predicting ability .

mid = model identification, -2logl = - <dig> log of the likelihood function , aic = akaike information criterion , bic = bayes information criterion , bic = percentage of fit , pd = predictive ability criterion , pd = percentage of predictive ability loss 

in the model column the fixed effects were t = treatment  and g = gene ; the random effects were a = sample , tg = interaction treatment × gene , ta = interaction treatment × sample , ga = interaction gene × sample , and e = residual. residual variances: σ2e = homoskedastic residuals and σ2ej = heteroskedastic residual for the gene effect ; σ2eij = heteroskedastic residual for the treatment × gene effect . model  <dig> was proposed by andersen et al  <cit> , where txg y txa interactions are treated as fixed effects.

mid - model identification

considering these results, models  <dig> and  <dig> were selected to estimate the stability value  of the  <dig> candidate rgs. for each gene, two mse values, one for each treatment, were calculated. table  <dig> shows estimates of bias, variances and mse of the candidate rgs obtained with mixed model  <dig>  since results from models  <dig> and  <dig> were similar, only those from model  <dig> are shown. rps <dig> and b2m showed the lowest bias,  which is indicative of the stability of these genes under heat stress conditions. on the contrary, loc <dig>  rpl <dig> and atp5g <dig>  showed the highest bias values. although some genes  showed higher variances in the control than in the stressed samples, or in the other way around , the overall variances of gene expression under both control and heat-stress were small, as expected for candidate rgs.

bias of the control samples. estimates of bias of the heat-stress samples were the same as for control but with opposite sign.

to rank genes on the basis of their stability, the minimax mse criterion of szabo et al.  <cit>  was applied. briefly, the gene with the minimum mse value was selected as the most stable. the mse value for each gene was the largest of the two mse values for each treatment. overall, rps <dig> was the most stable gene and rpl13a the least.

comparison with genorm and normfinder
normfinder and mixed model  <dig> are further compared in figure  <dig>  where inter- and intra-group variabilities are presented for both procedures. with the exception of ywhab and rpl13a, inter-group differences  estimated following both procedures were similar for most of the genes. those genes which were over-expressed in heat stress  conditions, showed negative inter-group differences. conversely, those genes that were down-regulated in heat stress  showed positive inter-group differences. it is important to highlight that the simultaneous use of genes with positive and negative values would yield lower mse and normfinder stability values than sets involving genes with the same sign, due to compensating effects.

optimal set of rgs
best pairs of stable genes for all approaches are shown in the first line of table  <dig>  in the genorm approach, stability value of the best pair of genes corresponded to that obtained after several steps of stepwise exclusion of the least stable gene until only two genes from the whole set of sixteen remain. these pairs were different in every approach, rps26/sdha for mixed model  <dig>  rps26/ywhab for normfinder and actb/rpl13a for genorm. under mixed model  <dig>  average mse for all possible combinations of genes from  <dig> to  <dig>  were explored to determine the best set of stable genes to be used as normalizers. table  <dig> shows the average mse of the best combinations of sets from  <dig> to  <dig> genes and also for the set including all genes. the rps18/rps26/sdha set had the lowest average mse , revealing the best combination of normalizers. similarly, rps26/sdha and rps18/sdha pairs had average mse values of  <dig> . additional file  <dig> shows the optimal number of control genes for normalization estimated by the genorm. genorm authors  <cit>  recommend a cut-off value of  <dig> , thus, the group of two genes  was the best combination .

discussion
ml-mixed model approach
the stability ranking generated by mixed model  <dig>  placed rps <dig>  rps <dig>  sdha, b2m and actb in the top five positions. however, as previously mentioned, the selection of rgs has to be based not only on the estimated stability of gene expression, but also on biological and functional criteria. for instance, despite the fact that rps <dig> showed a high stability, some works indicate that it is not a good control gene  <cit>  because its transcription is carried out by rna polymerase i, and for accurate quantification by qpcr the use of rgs following the same type of transcription pathways is important. rps <dig> encodes the 40s ribosomal protein s <dig>  s <dig> mrna half-life is more than  <dig> hours and was found to be expressed at high and comparable levels in various adult human tissues  <cit> . however, rps <dig> has multiple processed pseudogenes dispersed through the genome  <cit> . primers are usually designed to overlap two or more exons in order to distinguish pcr products derived from genomic dna and rna. if some of these pseudogenes are expressed either constitutively or under particular circumstances, several sequences from different genes could be co-amplified leading to wrong results.

sdha encodes the succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit a flavoprotein which converts succinate to fumarate as part of the citric acid cycle. under mixed model  <dig> this gene showed similar and small variances in control  and heat stressed  samples, appearing in the 3rd position of the stability ranking. this result is in agreement with other studies which have pointed out sdha as a good rg to be used in different circumstances, including heat stress in several species,  <cit> . beta- <dig> microglobulin is a component of mhc class i molecules gene and is encoded by b2m, which has been extensively used as endogenous control in many publications. however, its expression varies considerably under different experimental conditions and therefore its use for normalization is limited. under mixed model  <dig>  b2m showed higher variance in heat stress conditions  than under mild temperatures . however since its bias was among the lowest , it can be considered as a good rg to study heat stress in ovine blood samples.

actb is another commonly used rg in qpcr assays. its expression has been shown to vary in a tissue-specific and time-dependent manner  <cit> . however, our results are in line with other studies reporting stable expression of actb under temperature stress in orchesella cincta  <cit> . although under our ml-mixed model approach actb is placed among the top five stable genes, this was not the case when comparing sets of two or three genes.

conversely, mdh <dig> took the 6th place in the mixed model  <dig> stability ranking, but appeared among the genes constituting the most stable sets. mdh <dig> encodes the cytosolic malate dehydrogenase which catalyzes the reversible oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate, utilizing the nad/nadh cofactor system in the citric acid cycle. cellular localization studies indicate that mdh <dig> mrna expression has a strong tissue-specific distribution, being expressed primarily in cardiac and skeletal muscle and in the brain, at intermediate levels in the spleen, kidney, intestine, liver and testes and at low levels in lung and bone marrow  <cit> . this study demonstrated that mdh <dig> expression was stable under different temperature conditions in ovine whole blood samples, and points toward this gene as a suitable rg to be used in expression studies addressing the heat stress response in sheep.

comparison of methods
the top five positions of the stability rankings obtained with the mixed model  <dig>  normfinder and genorm approaches  contained the rps <dig>  sdha and b2m candidates. this shows the accordance of the three methods to identify highly stable genes even when different calculation methods are used. however, for the remaining genes there were many larger differences among the three rankings.

model based procedures such as the ones proposed by andersen et al.  <cit>  and abruzzo et al.  <cit>  are appealing. they provide a solid statistical framework which allows accounting for different sources of variation  in the estimation of the genes stability. the goal is to achieve a prediction of gene stability invariant to a variety of effects, making the set of selected rgs more generally applicable. in our case, a model including sample and its interactions with treatment and gene was deemed more plausible for the data analyzed  and for data not used in the analysis . accounting for those factors when estimating the parameters of interest  removes noise and provides estimates free of the effects of the specific animals sampled for this experiment. the model underlying the normfinder application  <cit>  does not consider the interaction between sample and treatment and showed a worse predictive ability, illustrating the interest of adjusting for noise to obtain estimates of gene stability applicable to future samples.

within the model based methods, several alternatives have been proposed to obtain the stability measure. in normfinder  <cit> , inter-group variation is computed as the least square estimate of the group by gene interaction and intra-group variability is obtained following the method of moments approach. those two components are closely linked to the bias and variance components of the mse calculation of szabo et al.  <cit> , followed in our study. figure  <dig> shows inter-group variation  and bias  for all genes, together with the intra-group standard deviations from normfinder and from our procedure represented by error bars. except for rplp <dig> and ywhab, the inter-group variability estimate obtained by the two procedures was similar for all genes . however, the intra-group variability was more dissimilar . this may be explained by the different estimation methods followed in both procedures . maximum likelihood estimates have well known asymptotically optimal properties in terms of bias and variance while unbiasedness is the only optimal property of methods of moments. andersen et al.  <cit>  argued that using reml to obtain estimates of intra-group variances yielded similar results in their data set to the method of moments proposed, but, this result cannot be generalized. another difference between the stability value obtained by normfinder and the mse stability value  <cit>  used in our study is how the inter- and intra-group variation are combined. in normfinder, those two components are combined by adding estimates of the mean and standard deviation of the posterior distribution  of the deviation of the observed group mean for each gene from the overall expected value for the log-transformed measure of the gene expression. the mean and variance of the distribution of that deviation depends on inter- and intra-group variation, respectively. this results in a stability value where inter- and intra-group variability do not have the same weight. this is in contrast with the mse situation, where these two components are equally weighted. nevertheless, when intra-group variability is close to zero, the weights on both components are equal. in our data set, the estimated intra-group variances for all genes are small . we obtained a stability measure by adding the inter-group variation and the average of the square root of the intra-group variations provided in the extended output of normfinder which was similar to the overall stability value provided by that software .

the use of a more solid statistical framework such as our ml-mixed approach allows for statistical testing of the differences in gene expression across different conditions. this is an alternative way and a double check through statistical validation procedures for the selection of stable genes, as recently recommended setiawan and lokman  <cit> . in our case, a t-test on the estimated gene by treatment effects provided by the sas mixed models procedure  indicated that differences in expression between the two treatments were only significant  for rpl <dig> and atp5g <dig> which were positioned by the three procedures among the five most instable genes and considered together with acaca, among the worst. this shows consistency between stability values and statistical validation approaches.

the difference between our procedure and the one followed by szabo et al.  <cit>  is that the gene by group interaction is treated as a random effect instead of as a fixed factor. random effects represent random deviations from the expected value of each data due to that effect. in our case, the random treatment by gene interaction can therefore be used as a direct measure of the so called bias in  <cit> .

compared to model based procedures, the pair-wise comparison approach used in genorm  <cit>  is easier to apply and does not require normality assumptions . furthermore, it has shown more robust behavior than normfinder with small sample sizes  <cit> . nevertheless, genorm has the tendency to top rank genes with correlated expression profiles rather than with minimal variation  <cit>  and does not accommodate the existence of different groups of measures in the calculation of the stability value. when different groups of samples exist, independent analyses for each set of data have to be carried out, often yielding different optimal sets of rgs in each group. we have run genorm for each set of data  separately . ranking of rgs differed between treatments, but, two genes, sdha and b2m were shared among the top five of both groups. a better agreement was found for the least stable genes , which were located in both treatments in the last five positions. alternatively, the procedures proposed by andersen et al.  <cit>  and our ml-mixed model approach can also provide within group stability values. ranking differences were also observed for these procedures between treatments. here the differences were also bigger among the most stable genes than among those genes estimated as the less stable ones. results from the different methods were more similar in the control  than in the heat stress environment. notice that within groups, differences in stability among genes are only associated to changes in intra-group variances. genes such as b2m and sdha, which were classified by our ml-mixed model approach within the top five stable genes, both globally and in the control group, showed larger variability under heat stress, and were classified as the less stable ones under heat conditions. since in many situations the goal is to use a given set of rgs in the normalization of the expression of target genes across different conditions, an essential requirement for the rgs is stability of their transcriptional levels across those conditions. the within group stability will only be relevant when target genes are compared under the same experimental conditions.

finally, one constraint of the genorm and normfinder softwares come from the fact that they are implemented for the microsoft excel application which involves some restriction regarding the number of samples, treatments and genes that can be analyzed simultaneously. furthermore, the genorm application, does not allow empty cells, therefore, those samples in which the amplification of one or more genes fails must be eliminated from the analysis.

best set of rgs
there is no consensus about the amount of rgs that should be used in expression studies  <cit> , although in all cases the common objective is to find the best alternative regarding accuracy and technical constraints. we have analyzed in this work all possible sets of genes considering, both stability and biological criteria. as explained above, rps <dig> and rps <dig> have been discarded from the analysis for functional reasons. with the ml-mixed model  <dig> the best set of two genes was sdha/mdh <dig>  and the best one of three genes was rpl19/actb/sdha , after discarding these genes. these values were very close to those of the best pair rps26/sdha  obtained under our ml-mixed model  <dig> approach when all candidates were included. however, pairs constituted by sdha/b2m and sdha/actb had larger mse values . for the genorm approach the best pair of genes was the same, actb/rpl13a, as the one obtained when including all candidates. however, normfinder selected a different pair of genes b2m/sdha. one again, ml-mixed model  <dig> and normfinder approaches identify the same gene  for the best set of two genes.

normalization factors and normalized targets
normalization factors were calculated by means of the delta ct method  <cit>  for the best pair of reference genes selected with each statistical approach, actb/rpl13a, b2m/sdha and sdha/mdh <dig> for genorm, normfinder and ml-mixed model, respectively . two of the less stable genes cyp1a <dig> and acaca were used as targets to study the impact of using different nornalizers. pearson and spearman correlations estimates among normalized values of targets ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for genorm-normfinder, from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for genorm-ml- mixed model and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for normfinder-ml mixed model. model based methods, normfinder and ml-mixed model showed the highest correlations indicating statistical similarities underlying the estimation of genes stability under both methods. although correlations among results obtained under all approaches were high, small differences among the normalized expression rates of targets might be critical when the aim is to detect differential expression among samples from different treatments, tissues, cell types or genotypes.

CONCLUSIONS
a ml-mixed model approach has been presented here as a suitable method to select stable genes to be used as rgs in gene expression studies. optimal statistical properties of ml estimation together with the flexibility of the mixed model allows estimation of gene expression stability under many different situations without constraints in the amount of data, number of genes and number of treatments or tissues tested. a model selection step can also be performed to choose the optimal model to estimate stability values. the use of goodness of fit and predictive ability criteria is recommended because they measure different quality criteria and can provide unequal model rankings.

although in the present study we have tested several mixed models according to our experimental needs, many other possibilities can be considered to take into account for new biological situations. for instance, in situations such as drug competition in which interaction between treatments must be fitted, or experiments of sequential gene expression along a period of time where the existence of correlation between successive samples needs to be considered by fitting some structure among residuals.

comparison with two other procedures currently used showed differences in genes ranking according to their stability values, which were mainly explained by the difference in estimates for the within treatment variability. also differences in normalized expression values of targets were found among the three methods tested. nevertheless, some genes were selected by the three approaches. rps <dig>  sdha and b2m were ranked in the first five positions by the three methods. on the last positions, acaca, atp5g <dig> and rpl <dig> were the least stable genes under the three approaches.

in this work, the pair of genes sdha/mdh <dig> is recommended to normalize target genes expression in peripheral whole blood in studies of the heat-stress response in sheep.
