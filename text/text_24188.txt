BACKGROUND
the hypothetical multistep model of carcinogenesis indicates that breast cancer develops via a series of intermediate hyperplastic lesions through in situ to invasive carcinomas, with the risk of developing carcinoma increasing at each stage  <cit> . epidemiological studies demonstrated an increased risk of developing breast cancer associated with proliferative breast lesions. hyperplasia of usual type  is a common proliferative lesion associated with a slightly elevated risk for subsequent development of breast cancer   <cit> . hut is not necessarily a direct precursor of invasive breast carcinoma but may identify individuals whose breast tissue has acquired a molecular alteration that can facilitate the eventual development of this disease  <cit> .

the defective function of regulatory cell cycle elements, like estrogen and progesterone receptors, ki- <dig>  p <dig>  p21waf <dig> and p <dig> leads toward increased proliferation and, in addition, expansion of genome damaged cells. cell cycle-related markers would be helpful to determine the putative role of these markers in the process of mammary carcinogenesis  <cit> .

many studies evaluated cell cycle-related proteins in invasive breast carcinomas, but there are few studies evaluating these proteins in hut  <cit> . some molecular alterations may already be present in the earliest stages of breast cancer development. detection of these alterations may be important for understanding the pathogenesis and also for risk assessment of premalignant breast lesions.

incidental cancers or precursor lesions are rare in specimens of cosmetic mammaplasty compared to reduction mammaplasty specimens performed for symmetry of contralateral breast in women with breast cancer undergoing mastectomy or conservative surgery. our hypothesis is that the expression of cell cycle related proteins would be different in hut lesions from women at higher risk of breast cancer or with breast cancer, compared to those hut from women without breast cancer. the aim of this study is to analyze the expression pattern of cell cycle related proteins er, pr, p <dig>  p21waf <dig>  p <dig>  and ki- <dig> in hyperplasia of usual type  of breast specimens of patients with and without breast cancer, and compare this expression with neoplastic cells of invasive carcinomas.

RESULTS
the age of patients submitted to arm ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> years , of patients with imc ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> years , and age of patients submitted to mcc ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> years . patients were divided according to the menopausal status into pre-menopausal patients  and post-menopausal patients . the mean age of patients with imc and submitted to mcc was significantly greater  than patients submitted to arm . there was no statistically significant difference between mean age of patients from imc and mcc groups.

the histologic review showed that hut was associated with other benign breast lesions in the majority of the cases. histologic findings were varied in arm, mcc, and imc specimens. usually, the strongest er staining was noted at the periphery of the hyperplastic foci . the majority of the epithelial cells of hut in all specimens showed positive staining for er, pr, and ki- <dig> . the er immunostaining was localized in the nuclei and showed some variability in intensity even in individual lesions of the same case.

** ki- <dig> expressed as: l-low, i-intermediate, and h-high proliferative index

the p <dig> expression was detected in the majority of the myoepithelial cell nuclei in normal lobules and in hut. p63-positive cells around hut foci occurred as a discontinuous layer in  <dig> % in arm, in  <dig> % in mcc, and in  <dig> % of myoepithelial cells surrounding hut adjacent to imc . the p <dig> expression was continuous in myoepithelial cells of normal lobules and ducts. there was no difference in the percentage of positive cells for er, pr, p21waf <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  and ki- <dig> in hut of arm, mcc and imc . the mean percentage of er+, pr+, ki-67+ in epithelial cells and, p63+ in myoepithelial cells of hut from all groups was significantly higher than positivity in neoplastic cell of imc .

usually, neoplastic cells of imc showed intermediate to high proliferative index of ki- <dig> positivity  compared to positive cells of hut from arm specimens , mcc specimens  and hut-imc , . no significant difference was observed between ki- <dig> expression in cells of hut-arm and hut-imc. all proliferative cells of hut of the three different groups were negative for p <dig> 

the p <dig> expression in imc was predominantly nuclear . cytoplasmatic staining was seen in neoplastic cells in  <dig> % of cases . nuclear staining was detected in cells of hut-mcc in  <dig> cases  and  <dig> cases showed cytoplasmatic staining in hyperplastic cells .

discussion
the aim of this study was to determine alterations in the expression of proteins involved in proliferation and cell cycle in hut cells of patients with and without invasive breast cancer. our analysis showed no difference in the cell cycle related proteins immunoexpression in hut from the three different groups, in spite of age and menopausal status. similar results were obtained by gobbi et al.  <cit>  evaluating er expression in usual hyperplasia without atypia of patients who developed breast cancer compared with patients who did not.

in our study, we found that er and pr immunoexpression was significantly higher in hut cells than in neoplastic cells of imc specimens. even in all  <dig> cases of er-negative tumors the epithelial cells of hut were positive for er. our results are in agreement with other investigators who found higher levels of er expression in benign breast epithelium of patients who developed breast cancer compared to controls  <cit> . the presence of positive er staining in normal lobules increases the breast cancer risk and the likelihood of progression to cancer  <cit> . it occurs through the increase of the rate of cell proliferation by both recruiting non-cycling cells into the cell cycle and by shortening the overall cell cycle time due to a reduction in the length of g <dig> phase  <cit> .

previous comparison between normal and precancerous breast biopsies has shown that er expression is relatively low in normal epithelium and slightly increased in hut  <cit> . recent studies indicate that hut is a heterogeneous entity containing subgroups identified according to the criterion of er-α  proliferating cells and this fact could explain the different biologic behavior of hut  <cit> . in our study, the er positive cells were more often found at the periphery of hyperplastic lesions. similar pattern of er positivity was previously described by gobbi et al <cit> . it is possible that the er+ epithelial cells at the periphery of hut represent the most proliferative group of cells, in spite of low positivity for ki- <dig> in sequential sections of the same lesion. the estrogen exposure may stimulate a clonal proliferation of some er+ cells or may increase the chance of spontaneous mutations  <cit> .

in normal breast, there is a negative association between expression of er and ki- <dig>  indicating either that er+ cells are non-dividing or that the receptor is down-regulated as cells enter cycle  <cit> . this important correlation breaks down in many er+ cancers, where the receptor is often detected in proliferating cells  <cit> . however, cells co-expressing er-α and ki- <dig> have been found in precancerous lesions and correlate positively with the level of risk of developing breast cancer  <cit> . in our series, we found higher er and ki- <dig> immunoexpression in hut areas compared to the immunopositivity for these markers in adjacent normal lobules. our results are similar to those described by schmitt   <cit>  who found the existence of a positive correlation between er status and proliferation in hyperplasic epithelium and a progressive inversion of this relationship in lesions evolving towards malignancy. the observation of higher rates of proliferation in er positive benign proliferative breast lesions fits with the concept of an initial hormone-dependent status in breast carcinogenesis  <cit> . in addition, hut with higher expression of er and ki- <dig> could represent a subset of hyperplastic lesions with increased risk of subsequent breast cancer development.

some previous studies suggest that at least some huts are clonal  <cit> . nevertheless, it remains unclear whether the dysregulation of er has arisen prior to clonal expansion of the hut, since cells with apparently abnormal regulation of er during cell division are scattered randomly throughout the hut in a non-contiguous pattern in some cases. the variable number of er+ cells might indicate that in hut the dysregulation of er expression is incomplete and may be absent in some lesions, or apparent under certain conditions  <cit> .

we detected p <dig> and p <dig> positivity in neoplastic cells of imc, especially in high grade carcinomas. mutations in tumor suppressor gene tp <dig>  which mediates g <dig> arrest and apoptosis leads to an increased half-life and accumulation of the p <dig> protein  <cit> . a way to investigate the functional status of tp <dig> is to evaluate some of its downstream effectors such as p <dig> gene whose product acts by blocking cyclin-dependent kinases  <cit> . in our study, we found a positive association between expression of p <dig> and p <dig> in neoplastic cells, which is in agreement with the studies of bankfalvi et al  <cit>  and pelikainen et al  <cit> .

high expression of p <dig> would result in decreased cell proliferation subsequent to inhibition of cyclin/cdk activity  <cit> . however, in our study p <dig> expression in neoplastic cells was related to higher proliferative index. our results are in agreement with the theory of p <dig> independent pathways of p <dig> regulation in breast cancer  <cit> . high amounts of p <dig> in high proliferating cells may reflect an unsuccessful effort to halt proliferation. this may result from the presence of other cell cycle regulatory pathways, which bypass the p <dig> mediated cell cycle block, such as c-myc or b-myb  <cit>  or due to mutant non-functional forms of p <dig> which posses prolonged half lives  <cit> . in addition, p <dig> expression can indeed be up-regulated by epidermal growth factor receptor and transforming growth factor β <dig>  <cit>  which are associated with higher tumor grade and disease progression in breast carcinoma  <cit> .

in our study, cytoplasmic expression of p <dig> was found in  <dig> % of benign hyperplastic cells and in  <dig> % of neoplastic cells of imc. previous studies have reported exclusive nuclear localization of p <dig> in neoplastic cells of breast carcinomas  <cit> , and in epithelial cells of hut  <cit>  however, other authors reported p <dig> immunoexpression in the cytoplasm of breast and ovarian tumors and it was considered critical for promoting cell transformation  <cit> . there is no other data in current literature concerning cytoplasmatic p <dig> expression in hut similar to our findings. it remains unclear how the elevated cytoplasmic p <dig> expression might contribute to tumorigenesis. one possibility is that p <dig> is sequestered away from the nucleus thereby preventing it from binding to nuclear cyclin/cdk complexes, thus allowing sufficient cyclin/cdk activity for cell cycle progression  <cit> . alternately, relocalization of p <dig> to the cytoplasm may target cytoplasmic molecules such as apoptosis signal-regulating kinase  <dig>  thereby promoting cell survival  <cit> .

in our study, p <dig> was exclusively expressed in myoepithelial cells of normal breast lobules and ducts, partially expressed around the hut cells, and rarely expressed in invasive breast carcinoma. we observed that p <dig> staining was discontinuous in  <dig> % in hut-arm, in  <dig> % in hut-mcc, and in  <dig> % in hut-imc. the discontinuous p <dig> expression pattern in hut was different from continuous expression in normal lobules and could suggest that there is loss of p <dig> expression in the progression to invasive carcinoma. our data is similar to the findings of wang et al  <cit>  that demonstrate non-continuous expression of p <dig> in usual ductal hyperplasia. p <dig> expression has been useful to differentiate dcis from microinvasive and invasive carcinomas based on lack of myoepithelial cells in invasive tumors without continuous distribution  <cit> . although p <dig> is the most specific marker for myoepithelial cells, limitations exist because discontinuous myoepithelial layer seen in benign lesions, such as in our study may potentially cause diagnostic problems in clinical practice  <cit> .

although our data and genetic studies failed to demonstrate molecular changes in hut, that are present in columnar cell lesions, adh cells and in neoplastic cells of dcis and imc  <cit>  the argument that hut may be an early precursor is still supported by consistent data from epidemiological studies  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our findings and previously published data  <cit>  demonstrate that the imunoprofile of hut is different from other accepted precursor lesions, since they are composed of a mixed population of cells types with variable proportions of cell-cycle related protein expression, and some alterations could be present in the latest stages of breast cancer development.
