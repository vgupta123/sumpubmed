BACKGROUND
cells and tissues respond to low oxygen levels by stabilizing the hif- <dig> transcription factor, which controls the expression of over  <dig> different genes that are involved in adaptation and survival  <cit> . these include genes involved in erythropoiesis , vasculogenesis , glucose metabolism , and fibrogenesis. hif- <dig> is a heterodimeric dna-binding protein composed of an oxygen-sensitive hif-1α subunit and a constitutively expressed hif-1β subunit   <cit> . in the presence of oxygen, hif-1α is hydroxylated by a prolyl hydroxylase  <cit> . this triggers its interaction with the pvhl protein, which targets hif-1α for degradation by the 26s proteosome  <cit> . in the absence of oxygen, prolyl hydroxylase activity is inhibited. this results in the stabilization of hif-1α and the subsequent translocation of the hif-1α subunit into the nucleus where it binds hif-1β and forms transcriptionally active hif- <dig>  hif- <dig> regulates gene expression by interacting with sequence-specific hypoxia-responsive elements  found in either the 5'-flanking, 3'-flanking, or intronic regions of hif-responsive genes. the hre was first identified as a 256-bp sequence in the 3'-flanking region of the human epo gene  <cit> .

the cited  proteins belong to a family of transcriptional cofactors that is characterized by a conserved ed-rich domain at the c-terminus. the biological properties of cited proteins include modulating a variety of cellular and developmental processes  <cit>  and responding to diverse biological  <cit>  and environmental stimuli  <cit> . to date, four different cited homologs have been reported in vertebrates. cited <dig>  which can function as an activator and a repressor depending on the tissue, is the most extensively studied of the four. in the initial description, cited <dig> was shown to function as a repressor of hypoxia-inducible factor- <dig>  through competition for binding to the ch <dig> domain of cbp/p <dig>  <cit> . the lpxl  motifs in both cited <dig> and hif-1α interact with overlapping binding sites on the ch <dig> domain of p <dig>  <cit> . cited <dig> has been reported to bind this same region with 33-fold greater affinity than hif-1α  <cit> . genetic evidence indicates that loss of cited <dig> is associated with increased activation of hif- <dig> target genes  <cit> , supporting the hypothesis that cited <dig> is a negative regulator of hif-1α. conversely, cited <dig> functions as a co-activator for several transcription factors, such as ap- <dig>  <cit> , ppar-α, and ppar-γ  <cit> , by linking them to cbp/p <dig>  cellular responses to tgf-β are largely mediated by the smad proteins, which serve as both transcription factors and transcriptional co-regulators. cited <dig> is an important regulator of tgf-β signaling through direct association with smad <dig> and smad <dig>  <cit> . members of the cited protein family may also play an important role in the regulation of reproductive functions. studies have shown that cited <dig> interacts with the lim domain of the lhx <dig> transcription factor to enhance transcription of the glycoprotein α-subunit gene  <cit> . furthermore, cited <dig> has been shown to bind to the estrogen receptor er-α and enhance the transcription of estrogen-inducible genes such as tgf-α  <cit> .

cited <dig> is the least studied member of the cited family. previous studies have shown that it is highly expressed during the early stages of embryonic development in the mesonephric tubules and eye in the chicken  <cit> , the pronephros and eye in the frog  <cit> , and the kidney of adult grass carp  <cit> . while much is known about the distribution and regulation of the cited proteins in mammals, very little is known about these proteins in fish. fish are ideal models to study molecular and cellular adaptation to hypoxia, as fluctuations in environmental oxygen availability have played an important role in the evolution of these animals  <cit> . the expression patterns and functions of the cited proteins remain largely unknown in cyprinids. our group has previously reported the presence of a hypoxia-responsive cited <dig> cdna in grass carp  <cit> . in an attempt to gain broader insights into the evolution and possible functions of the different cited genes in fish, this study describes our findings on two closely-related but distinct cited <dig> homologs - gccited3a and gccited3b - from the hypoxia-tolerant grass carp. we present evidence for a differential role of these two gccited <dig> genes for adaptation to hypoxia in grass carp based on their in vivo mrna expression and response pattern to short- and long-term hypoxia, as well as in vitro gene transactivation studies.

RESULTS
identification of two cited <dig> genes in grass carp
we have previously described a full-length cited <dig> cdna from grass carp that shows high similarity to chicken and xenopus cited <dig>  <cit> . in this study, degenerate primers, targeting consensus sequences derived from a multiple alignment of the cited <dig> open reading frames  of grass carp , zebrafish , chicken  and xenopus , were used for rt-pcr on total rna extracted from the kidney of a grass carp that was exposed to hypoxia for  <dig> h. a distinct cdna fragment, cix <dig> , with a partial orf that shared high sequence identity with the grass carp cited <dig> orf was identified. using 5'- and 3'-race pcr, a 3032-bp full-length cdna, cix <dig>  was obtained. dna sequencing showed that cix <dig> contains 5'- and 3'-untranslated  regions of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, respectively, and an orf  that specifies a protein of  <dig> amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of  <dig>  kda. in agreement with this finding, a single mrna transcript of approximately  <dig>  kb was detected by northern blot . a pairwise sequence comparison demonstrated that cix <dig> shares particularly high similarity with the cited <dig> proteins of grass carp ; zebrafish ; and chicken , but only moderate similarity  with the cited <dig> protein, and low similarity  with the cited <dig> and cited <dig> proteins from different vertebrate species. moreover, the primary structure of the cix <dig> and grass carp gccited <dig>  proteins contain the characteristic cr <dig>  cr <dig>  and cr <dig> domains that are highly similar to the homologous domains present in the chicken and xenopus cited <dig> proteins . taken together, these data strongly suggest that cix <dig> is a novel cited3-like homolog. we refer to this gene as gccited3b, and the previously described gccited <dig> as gccited3a  <cit> . this designation was chosen since the primary sequences and structures of these two homologs are most similar to known cited <dig> proteins. the nucleotide sequence data of gccited3a and gccited3b have been deposited in the genbank database as genbank: ay <dig> and genbank: eu <dig>  respectively.

characteristics of the deduced gccited3a and gccited3b proteins
sequence alignment of the grass carp gccited3a and gccited3b proteins with homologs from pufferfish , zebrafish , japanese medaka , marine medaka  and fugu  indicated extensive sequence similarity in the cr <dig>  cr <dig>  and cr <dig> domains . cr <dig> is the characteristic domain of the cited protein family and is present in all known cited proteins. notably, a particularly high degree of sequence conservation is observed in the core cr <dig> motif, which is known to interact with the ch <dig> domain of the p300/cbp co-transactivator  <cit> . importantly, a glutamine and histidine-rich  region  is found only in the cited3a and cited3b homologs in fish but is absent in the chicken and xenopus cited <dig> , and mammalian cited <dig>  cited <dig>  and cited <dig> proteins . in addition, a leucine-rich nuclear-export signal , which presumably contributes to the sub-cellular localization of the cited proteins  <cit> , is also conserved within the cr <dig> domain of all the fish cited3a and cited3b proteins.

phylogeny of fish cited3a and cited3b proteins
in silico screens of the zebrafish, japanese medaka, fugu genome and/or est and ncbi genbank databases identified a number of fish homologs that share substantial sequence similarity with the gccited3a and gccited3b proteins. similar screens of various mammalian databases with cited <dig>  cited3a, or cited3b failed to identify any cited3-like sequences, suggesting that these genes are absent in mammals. the phylogenetic relationship between different cited <dig> proteins was analyzed by the neighbor-joining method using fish cited <dig> proteins as the outgroup . as shown in figure  <dig>  cited <dig> proteins are separated with high bootstrap support into three different sub-clades: fish-specific cited3a and cited3b, and avian/xenopus cited <dig>

in vivo mrna expression and response patterns of gccited3a and gccited3b to short- and long-term hypoxia
to examine the in vivo expression pattern of gccited3a and gccited3b in response to hypoxia, grass carp  were exposed to normoxia  and hypoxia  for  <dig> h and  <dig> h. total rna was isolated from six different tissues  of each fish at each time point for northern blot analysis. overall, the normoxic mrna expression and hypoxic induction pattern of the gccited3a and gccited3b genes in different grass carp tissues were consistent between all three replicate blots, and a representative autoradiogram is shown in figure  <dig>  under normoxic conditions, gccited3a  expression was detected in all tissues examined except muscle. after  <dig> h of hypoxia, a significant induction of gccited3a was observed in the kidney, and a mild induction was identified in the gill and liver. the brain, heart, and muscle tissues showed no change in the expression of gccited3a. after  <dig> h of hypoxia, a marked induction of expression was observed in the kidney and liver, a modest induction was detected in the heart, and no change in gccited3a expression was observed in the brain, gill, or muscle.

under normoxic conditions, gccited3b mrna expression was also detected in all tissues examined except the muscle, and the highest level was detected in the kidney and liver. after  <dig> h of hypoxia, gccited3b mrna expression was induced in all tissues except the muscle. the highest induction was observed in the kidney and liver. after  <dig> h of hypoxia, the induction of gccited3b expression was detected in the brain, gill, heart, and kidney.

in all replicates of each hypoxic tissue, the mrna expression level of gccited3a and gccited3b was normalized against the 28s rrna and compared to their normoxic counterparts. if the expression level following hypoxia was equal to the normoxia control group, the hypoxia:normoxia expression ratio should be equal to one. in contrast, this ratio is expected to be significantly greater than one in the case of hypoxic induction of the genes. the  <dig> h and  <dig> h datasets for each tissue were combined and a non-parametric χ <dig> test was performed to examine the significance of the induction. the analysis indicated that the expression of both gccited3a and gccited3b was significantly different in the kidney and liver following hypoxia compared to the normoxic controls .

activation of gccited3a and gccited3b promoter activity by gchif- <dig> in cho cells
to investigate whether gchif- <dig> regulates the gccited3a and gccited3b gene promoters, chinese hamster ovary  cells were transiently transfected with the pcited3a or pcited3b luciferase construct, together with pbk-cmv-gchif1α  <cit> , or the empty pbk-cmv expression vector. as shown in figure  <dig>  luciferase activity was strongly activated in cho cells co-transfected with pcited3a and the pbk-cmv-gchif-1α , while cells similarly transfected with pcited3b exhibited an even greater hif-1-induction , when compared to control cells transfected with the empty pgl3-basic vector . interestingly, promoter sequence analysis revealed the presence of a single core hre  at position -59/- <dig> of the 5'-flanking region of the gccited3a gene , while two putative hres in the reverse dna strand  were detected at -629/- <dig> and -510/- <dig> of the gccited3b gene .

at the time of the study, no functional hre had been reported in fish, and the binding of the hif- <dig> transcription factor to consensus and non-consensus hres had only been speculated  <cit> . in order to determine whether the gchif <dig> binds to the gccited3a and gccited3b promoters in vivo, chip assays were performed on grass carp kidney and liver tissues using pcr primer sets that spanned four overlapping regions  within the 5'-flanking sequences of the gccited3a and gccited3b genes. under normoxic conditions, gchif- <dig> did not bind to the gccited3a promoter; however gchif- <dig> binding was detected in region  <dig>  of the gccited3a promoter  in kidney and liver tissues of fish exposed to  <dig> h of hypoxia . these data demonstrate that gchif- <dig> formed a specific complex at the gccited3a promoter in vivo. in contrast, three different gchif- <dig> binding patterns were observed at the gccited3b promoter following chip: specific gchif- <dig> binding was detected at nucleotide positions -1731/- <dig>  and -1257/- <dig> , neither of which contain a consensus or core hre sequence, in the kidney of hypoxic fish, but not in normoxic kidney . additionally, gchif- <dig> binding was detected in region  <dig> of gccited3b in the liver of both normoxic and hypoxic fish. finally, gchif- <dig> binding was specifically detected at nucleotide position -760/- <dig>  in the liver of hypoxic fish.

inhibition of gchif- <dig> transactivation of hre-luciferase activity by gccited3a and gccited3b
previous work has demonstrated that the human cited <dig> and cited <dig> proteins are capable of competing with hif- <dig> for specific binding to the ch <dig> domain of cbp/p <dig> and repressing the transcription of hif- <dig> regulated genes  <cit> . to test whether gccited3a and gccited3b could also inhibit the transactivation activity of gchif- <dig>  cho cells were co-transfected with pbk-cmv-gchif1α and pbk-cmv-gcarnt2b, with or without pcmv-gccited3a or pcmv-gccited3b, together with the luciferase reporter construct psv40-epohre-luc, which contains four copies of the hre from the human epo gene  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  the gchif-1-mediated transactivation of hre-luciferase activity in cho cells was reduced significantly  in the presence of gccited3a or gccited3b . the cr <dig> domains of cited <dig> and cited <dig> have been shown to be involved in the inhibition of hif- <dig> transcriptional activity in humans  <cit> . to determine whether the cr <dig> domain of gccited3a/gccited3b is required for the inhibition of gchif- <dig> activity, cho cells were transfected with pbk-cmv-gchif1α and pbk-cmv-gcarnt2b, together with pcmv-gccited3aΔcr <dig> or pcmv-gccited3bΔcr <dig>  expression vectors. no significant reduction in gchif- <dig> transactivation of hre-luciferase activity was observed in the presence of either of these two cr2-deletion derivatives , indicating that the negative regulatory effect of gccited3a and gccited3b on gchif- <dig> is dependent upon the cr <dig> domain of these proteins. next, to determine whether the inhibition of the gchif-1-mediated transactivation of hre-luciferase activity may be due to reduced synthesis of gchif-1α caused by ectopic expression of gccited3a or gccited3b, western blot analysis was performed using an anti-gchif-1α antibody  <cit> . cho cells transfected with pbk-cmv-gchif-1α alone or co-transfected with pcmv-gccited3a or pcmv-gccited3b contained comparable levels of the gchif-1α protein , which indicated that the decrease in gchif- <dig> transcriptional activity in the presence of gccited3a/gccited3b is not due to reduced gchif- <dig> synthesis.

gccited3a and gccited3b physically interact with cbp/p300
since gccited3a and gccited3b have been shown to repress the transcriptional activity of gchif- <dig> , we used immunoprecipitation and gst pull-down assays to determine whether these proteins can directly interact with cbp/p <dig>  cho cells were transfected with pgfp-gccited3a, pgfp-cited3b, pgfp-gccited3aΔcr <dig> or pgfp-cited3bΔcr <dig>  and whole cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with an anti-cbp antibody . western blot analysis of the anti-cbp immunoprecipitates using an anti-gfp antibody   demonstrated that both gccited3a and gccited3b co-immunoprecipitate with the endogenous cbp/p <dig> proteins in the cho cells. this result suggests that both proteins are capable of physically interacting with cbp/p <dig>  since the interaction of human cited <dig> and cited <dig> with cbp/p <dig> has been shown to be dependent on the cr <dig> domain  <cit> , we deleted this domain in gccited3a and gccited3b. interestingly, co-immunoprecipitation was also observed between the mutant gfp-gccited3aΔcr <dig> and gfp-gccited3bΔcr <dig> proteins and cbp/p <dig>  while gfp alone did not show any interaction. taken together, these results indicate that, unlike hcited <dig> and hcited <dig>  the cr <dig> domain in gccited3a and gccited3b is not required for physical interaction of the proteins with cbp/p <dig> 

using gst-pull down assays, we next determined whether gccited3a and gccited3b physically bind to the ch <dig> domain of the grass carp p <dig> protein. the ch <dig> domain of grass carp p <dig>   was amplified using degenerate primers and subcloned into the pgex-5x- <dig> vector . gst and gst-gc-p300/ch <dig> fusion proteins were incubated with in-vitro-transcribed and -translated  methionine-labeled gccited proteins, followed by fractionation on sds-page. as shown in figure 7b, only the wild-type gccited3a and gccited3b proteins, but not the gccited3aΔcr <dig> or gccited3bΔcr <dig> deletion derivatives, were pulled down by the gst-gc-p300/ch <dig> fusion protein, demonstrating that the cr <dig> domain facilitates specific binding of both gccited3a and gccited3b to the ch <dig> domain of cbp/p <dig> 

discussion
cited <dig> is the least studied member of the cited family, and the molecular targets and specific mechanisms underlying the action of cited <dig> have not yet been clearly identified. in this study, we have characterized two closely-related cited <dig> genes - gccited3a and gccited3b - in the hypoxia-tolerant grass carp, and in silico analyses demonstrated that these two cited homologs are present only in the genomes of fish and are absent in mammals. whilst we were able to recently identify cited <dig> cdnas from zebrafish and grass carp , bioinformatic searches of all available fish genomes with various mammalian cited <dig> proteins failed to turn up any cited4-like sequences, which suggested that cited <dig> genes are likely absent in fish. interestingly, parsimony analysis of cited proteins from diverse animal species has previously indicated that fish cited <dig> proteins are most closely related to the mammalian cited <dig>  <cit> . this raises the possibility that cited <dig> and cited <dig> are likely orthologous proteins that may have arisen subsequent to lineage divergence between mammalian and non-mammalian vertebrates, and that cited3a and cited3b have descended from a gene duplication event in fish from an ancestral cited <dig> gene.

we have shown that the gccited3a and gccited3b genes are transcriptionally up-regulated by the gchif- <dig> transcription factor , and the gene products, in turn, repress gchif- <dig> transcriptional activity at the molecular level . as gccited3a and gccited3b are differentially activated transcriptionally by hypoxia in certain fish tissues , our results suggest that gccited3a/gccited3b may serve to auto-regulate the hif transcriptional response in hypoxic cells of the corresponding tissues. interestingly, gene transfection studies demonstrated that gchif- <dig> transcriptional activity was inhibited by ectopic expression of the wild-type gccited3a/gccited3b, but not the mutant gccited3aΔcr <dig> or gccited3bΔcr <dig> proteins, which provided compelling evidence that the observed inhibition of hif- <dig> activity is mediated by the cr <dig> domains of gccited3a and gccited3b. while gst pull-down assays demonstrated that the cr <dig> domains of gccited3a and gccited3b are indeed required for specific binding of the proteins to the ch <dig> domain of the cbp/p <dig> co-transactivator , co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that gccited3a, gccited3b, and the corresponding Δcr <dig> mutant proteins could all physically interact with the endogenous cbp/p <dig> in cho cells . these results are consistent with the notion that both gccited3a and gccited3b can physically interact with cbp/p <dig> at multiple sites apart from the respective cr <dig> and ch <dig> domains of these proteins, and the functional implications of which await further investigations. to our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating physical interaction of cited <dig> proteins with p <dig>  and that cited <dig> can negatively regulate hif- <dig> transcriptional activity in a manner similar to the mammalian cited <dig> and cited <dig> proteins  <cit> , which require their cr <dig> domains to exert this function.

in vivo regulation of the gccited3a and gccited3b genes by hif- <dig> in the kidney and liver tissues of hypoxic fish was confirmed by chip-pcr assays, which revealed that endogenous gchif-1α is recruited to the gccited3a promoter at region  <dig>  . in contrast, three different chip patterns were observed with the gccited3b promoter. most notably, gchif- <dig> binding was detected in gccited3b in the kidney of hypoxic fish  at regions  <dig>  and  <dig> ; neither of which contains any consensus hre sequence . these observations are not surprising as it has been previously shown that hif- <dig> is expressed in many organs in mammals  <cit>  and fish  <cit> , albeit at varying levels, under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. what was surprising, however, was the binding of gchif- <dig> to two hre-less regions in gccited3b. a closer inspection of the chip-positive regions of the gccited3a and gccited3b promoters also failed to identify any sequence motifs that resemble the non-canonical hre sequence  recently reported in killifish  <cit> . indeed, the binding of hifs to gene promoters that lack the consensus hre motif  have been reported recently for human hif- <dig> and hif- <dig> using chip  <cit> , whereby the binding of transcription factors to promoter regions lacking the consensus recognition sequence may be attributed to the formation of higher order dna/protein complexes  <cit> .

experiments are currently underway in our lab to further explore the selectivity of hif- <dig> binding to dna that lacks the consensus hre motif, 5'-rcgtg-3'. notwithstanding, our findings in this study indicate that the gccited3a and gccited3b genes interact differentially under normoxia and hypoxia with gchif- <dig> in kidney and liver tissues, presumably via different sets of distal enhancer binding proteins to achieve differential gene expression.

northern blot analysis revealed that both gccited3a and gccited3b are ubiquitously expressed in all fish tissues examined, except muscle . although they share a similar overall mrna expression pattern, the predominant expression sites of gccited3a and gccited3b are the kidney and liver, respectively. this raises the question of whether these two genes have independent or partially redundant functions in these tissues. the major structural difference of these two homologs with other cited subtypes is the presence of a qh-rich domain in both gccited3a and gccited3b, which may contribute to functional differences. in addition to their known involvement in the regulation of hif- <dig> signaling, a growing body of evidence indicates that the cited proteins can interact with a variety of signaling molecules, suggesting that these proteins may have a role in diverse cellular processes. for example, while cited <dig> is able to activate smad4-dependent transcription, it has also been shown to repress the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which regulates early nephronic patterning in vertebrates  <cit> . cited <dig>  on the other hand, interacts with smad <dig> and smad <dig> to induce expression of the matrix metalloproteinase  <dig> gene in tgf-β-mediated tumor cell invasion  <cit> . in addition, cited <dig> and cited <dig>  along with some isoforms of the transcription factor ap <dig>  have been shown to activate genes that may be involved in neural crest, neural tube, and cardiac development  <cit> . moreover, cited <dig> and cited <dig> were shown to interact with er-α and ppar-α, respectively, to activate the transcription of target genes  <cit> . overall, based on the phenotypes of their gene knockouts and their interactions with many different and important developmental signaling pathways, it appears that members of the cited family are versatile transcriptional cofactors or effector molecules. these genes likely engage in diverse cellular and developmental processes/functions and serve to fine-tune a number of signaling pathways to mediate their ultimate biological functions.

all known interactions between cited proteins and various other transcription factors are bridged by the common transcriptional cofactor cbp/p <dig>  this cofactor is required to mediate either the transcriptional gene activation or repression mechanisms of the cited proteins. during gene activation, cited proteins interact with cbp/p <dig> via the cr <dig> domain to form a transcription complex along with other transcription factors, such as smad <dig>  smad <dig>  or ap2a, b, or c  <cit> . this complex induces the transcription of specific target genes. conversely, during gene repression, cited proteins may compete with specific transcription factors, such as hif-1α or β-catenin  <cit> , for a common binding site on the cbp/p <dig> protein. this binding diminishes the transactivation activity of the latter transcription factors. based on the studies of mammalian cited genes, with which the grass carp cited proteins share significant sequence homology , and the ability to bind cbp/p <dig>  it is likely that the gccited proteins may interact with the equivalent transcription factors described in mammalian systems to regulate similar cellular processes in fish.

both the gccited3a and gccited3b genes can be transactivated by subjecting fish to both short- and long-term exposure to low oxygen tension. long-term exposure led to a dramatic over-expression of both gccited3a and gccited3b in specific tissues, suggesting that certain processes in these tissues require gccited3a or gccited3b or that the cited3a or cited3b proteins directly alleviate the effect of hypoxia. the gene responses to hypoxia by other members of the cited family, and their roles in development, indicate that these proteins may be responsible for controlling gene transcription during tissue development, which may be driven by slight hypoxia in the developing tissues  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, gccited3a and gccited3b genes are differentially expressed and regulated in different fish organs in response to hypoxic stress. both genes are activated by gchif- <dig> in gene transfection studies, and chip assays comparing normal and hypoxic conditions reveal differential in vivo binding of gchif- <dig> to both gene promoters in kidney and liver tissues. hre-luciferase reporter assays showed that both gccited3a and gccited3b proteins inhibit gchif- <dig> transcriptional activity, presumably by binding specifically to the ch <dig> domain of the grass carp p <dig> protein as confirmed by gst pull-down assays.
