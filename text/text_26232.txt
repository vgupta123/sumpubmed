BACKGROUND
the ecological success of scleractinian corals arises from their mutualistic symbiosis with the dinoflagellate alga symbiodinium. energy-rich compounds provided by the phototrophic endosymbiont enhance coral growth and enable reef development in nutrient-poor tropical oceans . the symbiodinium genus constitutes a genetically diverse assemblage  <cit> , with several clades and sub-clades  showing different physiological and ecological characteristics  <cit> . of particular relevance, differences in symbiont thermal optima are conferred to the host in the form of resistance or susceptibility to coral bleaching  <cit> , a condition responsible for several large-scale episodes of coral mortality  <cit> . surviving colonies may acclimatize to warming conditions by replacing thermally-sensitive symbionts with more robust types . however the modified consortium may be unstable  <cit>  and less mutualistic  <cit> . furthermore, host-symbiont coevolution fosters strong fidelity between symbiotic partners  <cit>  and hence this strategy appears to be confined to a subset of ‘symbiont flexible’ coral taxa  <cit> . finally, symbiont shuffling appears to offer a maximum increase in thermal tolerance of around 1– <dig> °c  <cit> . given that recent model simulations predict a  <dig> -3°c increase by the year  <dig>  <cit> , adaptive bleaching will unlikely mitigate the environmental stress that corals are expected to face in the near future. as such, the ‘macro-evolutionary’ potential of the coral symbiosis will likely play a defining role in determining the future of coral reef ecosystems in a warming climate.

adaptation may occur in symbiodinium through selection acting on both existing genetic variation  <cit>  and new genetic variation arising through somatic mutations  <cit>  and/or genetic recombination. symbiodinium is generally considered a predominantly asexual, permanent haploid lineage that diversifies through host-specialization and geographic isolation  <cit> ; however several lines of molecular evidence suggest that cryptic meiotic recombination occurs in this genus. incongruence between isoenzyme phylogenies and those constructed from both rapd  <cit>  and its <dig> sequence variation  <cit>  implicate allelic recombination, consistent with criteria outlined to distinguish between clonal and sexual eukaryote populations  <cit> . more recently, meiotic recombination has been inferred from linkage disequilibrium between microsatellite loci  <cit> , indicating that extensive shuffling of alleles has occurred within several symbiodinium lineages. additionally, a recent meta-genomic analysis revealed the presence of six meiosis-specific and  <dig> meiosis-related functional genes in published symbiodinium genomes  <cit> , providing further evidence that the loss of sexual reproduction has not occurred in this genus.

morphological similarities among symbiotic dinoflagellates highlight the need to use appropriate genetic tools when addressing the incidence of recombination in this group. several population- and ‘species’-level markers are currently available, including polymorphic microsatellite loci , low-copy nuclear genes such as actin , and mitochondrial and chloroplast sequences . yet each of these has drawbacks, such as low taxonomic resolution or a lack of universal primer-binding sequences. the internal transcribed spacer  <dig>  region of nuclear ribosomal dna  is currently the most well-characterised and commonly-used marker in symbiodinium systematics  <cit> . this is primarily due to its high taxonomic resolution  <cit>  and ease of pcr amplification . recent genome-wide pyrosequencing has confirmed the taxonomic utility of the its <dig> region, with the dominant sequence variant offering 97% discrimination efficiency across a range of taxa, and rare intra-genomic variants further aiding species identification  <cit> . emerging patterns of its <dig> secondary structure promise even higher taxonomic resolving power  <cit> , leading some authors to support its candidacy as a barcode marker for delineating species boundaries in plants and algae  <cit> . unlike alternative mitochondrial- and chloroplast-encoded sequences and single-copy nuclear genes, the its <dig> region is also bi-parentally inherited, and hence the intra-genomic coexistence of polymorphic sequence variants can reveal the occurrence of recombination  <cit> . however, the multiple-copy nature of rdna renders it subject to intra-genomic variation arising from a variety of other processes, including the generation of paralogous somatic mutations and the degeneration of functional genes into pseudo-genes  <cit> . establishing whether a given ribotype is taxonomically meaningful requires the analysis of individuals rather than multi-genomic samples, necessitating a single-cell approach for unicellular dinoflagellates  <cit> . despite its obvious advantage in distinguishing between intra- and inter-genomic sequence variation  <cit> , single-cell pcr  has not been widely used in symbiodinium systematics. this is primarily due to its time-consuming nature, and the difficult task of disrupting the recalcitrant cell wall to extract the nucleic acids. a lack of suitable methodology for isolating, extracting and sequencing dna from individual symbiodinium cells has meant that intra-genomic variation in this genus has remained virtually unexplored  <cit> . fluorogenic-probe based qpcr analysis now offers sufficient sensitivity to quantify its <dig> variants at the sub-clade level, and has been used to quantify polymorphic ribotypes within the individual dinoflagellate genome through the use of a pcr pre-amplification step .

in this study, we developed:  a single-cell isolation and dna extraction protocol for symbiodinium;  a single-cell pcr-dgge method to screen for symbiodinium individuals with additive its <dig> repeats;  a nested pcr-qpcr assay to quantify intra-genomic its <dig> sequence polymorphisms within individual cells; and  a statistical framework to identify admixture in symbiodinium populations based on proportions of its <dig> sequence variants within the genome. the model selection criterion developed in  was then employed to test whether the p. damicornis symbiont consortium consists of a single clonal population of symbionts featuring a non-diagnostic polymorphism ; two populations of divergent, homogeneous symbionts; or a mixture of genetically homogeneous symbionts and heterogeneous cells, representing putative inter-lineage recombinants.

methods
study species and location
this study was carried out at the world’s southernmost coral reef at lord howe island . this isolated  <dig>  km <dig> volcanic remnant is located around 600 km east of the australian mainland, and some 200 km to the south of the elizabeth and middleton reefs marine national park reserve. the lhi reef hosts at least  <dig> species of scleractinian coral, , and a correspondingly diverse and endemic symbiodinium assemblage  <cit> . the host species investigated was the widely-distributed coral pocillopora damicornis, a thermally-sensitive but fast-growing coral that forms a dominant component of many indo-pacific reefs . p. damicornis is hermaphroditic and shows an unusual dual-reproductive mode, with the majority of offspring consisting of brooded asexual larvae, complimented by the cryptic simultaneous broadcast-spawning of sexual gametes  <cit> . this species shows a predominantly sexual reproductive mode at lhi, where it occasionally undergoes intergeneric hybridization with stylophora pistillata  <cit> . this may arise from suboptimal abiotic conditions selecting for ‘extreme’ hybrid phenotypes and/or a low availability of conspecific gametes  <cit> . p. damicornis transmits symbionts vertically from parent to offspring, and can form a symbiosis with a wide range of genetically and physiologically distinct symbiodinium taxa. in australian waters alone, p. damicornis is found in association with s. goreauii, s. glynni, s. trenchii, and numerous other types lacking formal species description including c1b, c1c, c1c-ff, c1h, c1j, c <dig>  c33a, c <dig>  c42a, c42b, c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  <cit> . of these, p. damicornis colonies have been reported as hosting symbiodinium c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> at lhi  <cit> .

sample collection and dna isolation
coral sampling was carried out in march  <dig> at north bay  and ned’s beach , lord howe island, australia. three p. damicornis colonies were sampled from each site by divers either snorkelling  or using scuba . three small branch tips  were taken from each colony using diagonal pliers, and preserved in dmso preservation buffer . coral samples were stored at −20°c prior to dna analysis. a  <dig>  cm <dig> area of tissue was removed from the skeleton in  <dig>  ml of  <dig>  μm filtered seawater , delivered at high velocity through a circular stencil. a 10 μl sub-sample was taken and centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for 5 min to pellet the symbiodinium fraction. the supernatant was discarded and the pellet re-suspended in 100 μl dna buffer . individual cells  were hand-picked under a light microscope using a heat-elongated glass micro-pipette. each cell was washed three times in 2 μl dnab, transferred to a  <dig>  ml micro-centrifuge tube with 50 mg acid-washed glass beads , and milled for 1 min at 50 hz  to disrupt the cell wall and release the nucleic acids. te buffer  was then added to a final volume of 20 μl. for each colony, the extraction process was carried out with the symbiont cell omitted , to ensure that only intracellular dna contributed to the pcr amplification signal.

end-point pcr, dgge and dna sequencing
single-cell dna template solutions generally contained insufficient dna for direct pcr-dgge and qpcr analysis. the partial nr <dig> s, its <dig> and partial nr28s regions were therefore pre-amplified using a shortened end-point pcr protocol, with the outer primers itsintfor <dig>  <cit>  and its2rev <dig>  <cit> . thermal cycling included an initial denaturation step of 3 min at 95°c followed by 24 cycles of 15 seconds at 95°c, 15 seconds at 56°c and 10 seconds at 72°c . each reaction contained 10 μl of dna template solution, 1× mytaq pcr reaction mix ,  <dig> pmol each primer, and deionised sterile water to a total volume of 25 μl. a template-free control reaction was included with each run.

pre-amplified pcr products were diluted 1: <dig>  or 1: <dig>  in deionised sterile water prior to pcr-dgge and qpcr analysis . pcr amplification for dgge was carried out using the primers itsintfor <dig> and its2clamp  <cit> . cycling conditions were as described above, except that an additional  <dig> thermal cycles were run . pcr products  were loaded on  <dig> ×  <dig> ×  <dig>  mm, 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels , and run in  <dig> × tae at 150 v for 7 h at 60°c  alongside known its <dig> sequences of symbiodinium c <dig> and c <dig>  following electrophoresis, gels were stained with ethidium bromide and viewed on a uv trans-illuminator . five representative bands at each position were excised, milled for 1 min at 50 hz with 50 mg glass beads and 200 μl te buffer, and re-amplified with both clamped and non-clamped primers  <cit> . dgge was carried out on clamped pcr products to ensure a single band migrated to the identical position from where it was excised. corresponding non-clamped products were cleaned with exosap-it , and sequenced by the macrogen sequencing service . sequences were manually checked and aligned in geneious v  <dig>   and a blast search was carried out against symbiodinium its <dig> sequences available in genbank. novel sequences were assigned alphanumeric its <dig> nomenclature  and deposited into the genbank database. the un-rooted statistical parsimony network of symbiodinium its <dig> phylotypes found within pocilloporid corals at lhi  <cit>  was updated in tcs v  <dig>  .

qpcr analysis of symbiodinium its <dig> ratios
for qpcr analysis, the universal primers cinnerfor  and cinnerrev  were developed, in addition to the custom taqman fluorogenic probes c100+ and c100− . the probe c100+ was designed to quantify the number of its <dig> sequences of type c <dig> in a given sample , while the c100− probe was developed to quantify the copy-number of all clade c its <dig> sequences other than type c <dig>  all primers and probes were initially checked for specificity by conducting a blast search against sequences deposited in genbank  <cit> . to obtain purified dna sequences for qpcr calibration, pcr products  were cloned using the topo ta kit . plasmid colonies were incubated overnight on selective lb agar plates containing ampicillin, iptg and xgal . dna was extracted from positive transformants, purified using a plasmid mini-prep kit , and sequenced as above with the m <dig> primer set. plasmid dna template concentrations were estimated using a pearl nanophotometer , diluted to approximately 10−3 ng μl− <dig>  and five log <dig> serial dilutions were constructed to generate standard curves and test the accuracy and precision of the assay. all qpcr reactions were carried out in triplicate  or duplicate  on an applied biosystems stepone instrument , alongside a template-free control reaction. each taqman qpcr reaction contained 4 μl template, 1× taqman universal mastermix ii , 1× taqman fluorogenic probe ,  <dig> pmol each primer, and deionised sterile water to a total volume of 20 μl. thermal cycling conditions involved an initial 10 min, 95°c denaturation step followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°c and 1 min at 60°c. cycle threshold  values were determined as the cycle at which the change in fluorescence was significantly different to the background level . ct values below the standard curve intercept  and featuring sufficiently low standard deviations  were included in the analysis.

to ensure that the taqman assays c100+ and c100− detected all symbiodinium clade c sequences present within each sample, the total its <dig> copy number  in each symbiodinium cell from the north bay colonies was also estimated using sybr qpcr analysis. reactions were carried out as above, except power sybr green mastermix  was used in place of taqman universal mastermix ii, fluorogenic probes were omitted, and ct values were generated using the Δrn threshold value of  <dig> . a melt curve  was included at the end of each run to ensure that only target sequences were amplified. template solutions yielding ct values below the standard curve intercept and melting temperatures  within 1°c of plasmid tm values were included in the analysis. the its <dig> copy number within each cell  was compared to the sum of those given by the c100+ and c100− taqman assays using linear regression . finally, a mixture test was carried out to assess the ability of the taqman qpcr assay to predict the proportion of total symbiodinium clade c its <dig> copies that were of type c <dig> . eight mixtures were constructed from plasmid c <dig> and c <dig> dna template solutions  and qpcr reactions were carried out in duplicate as above. the ability of the combined taqman assay to predict ctotal and cc100:ctotal was assessed using linear regression .

statistical analysis
to assess the relationship between the total its <dig> copy number and the proportion of copies that were of type c <dig>  a non-linear regression curve  was fitted to the bivariate cc100:ctotalversus ctotal data in sigmaplot v <dig>  . values of cc100:ctotal were arcsin transformed and compared between colonies  and between branches within colonies ) using nested anova . three competing hypotheses were evaluated to explain the its <dig> sequence variation within and between the symbionts of p. damicornis:  colonies host a single population of genetically heterogeneous symbionts, versus  colonies host two populations of genetically distinct, homogeneous symbionts, versus  colonies host distinct populations of genetically homogeneous and heterogeneous symbionts, consistent with the occurrence of recombination . the proportion of each its <dig> type in the genome of a heterogeneous cell may deviate from codominance  if recombinants backcross to one or both parental populations . the frequency distribution of cc100:ctotal within a coral colony  is expressed in model form as:figure  <dig>

where α and β are the shape parameters of the beta function, and π denotes the proportion of symbionts belonging to each component of the mixture model. mixed beta functions were fitted to the cc100:ctotal frequency distributions of each coral colony, and maximum likelihood parameter values were solved using the optim function in r . a range of starting parameter values was used at each optimization stage to ensure that a universal log-likelihood maximum was reached. hypothesis evaluation was based on weighted aicc values , with those above  <dig>  considered to provide unambiguous support for a candidate model  <cit> .

RESULTS
dgge and dna sequencing
the excision and sequencing of dgge bands revealed that all six p. damicornis colonies hosted symbiodinium its <dig> types c <dig>  and c <dig> . no other symbiodinium sequences were detected, including the rare types c <dig> and c <dig> previously identified from p. damicornis at lhi  <cit> . while the low resolution and sensitivity of dgge may have simply precluded their detection, this is unlikely given that this was the same method used in  <cit> . alternatively, the absence of c <dig> and c <dig> may be explained by differences in host-identification between studies. for example, two ambiguous colonies omitted from the present study that appeared to be the p. damicornis × stylophora pistillata hybrids described in  <cit>  were later found to exclusively host symbiodinium c <dig> . although two divergent its <dig> sequences were retrieved, three distinct dgge band profiles were observed among the  <dig> individual cells analysed. these corresponded to symbiodinium cells featuring a homogeneous c <dig> array, those featuring a near-homogeneous c <dig> array , and those with a co-dominant mixture of both its <dig> types . four of the six colonies analysed hosted a consortium of symbiodinium cells that included all three profiles , while the remaining two colonies hosted only homogeneous c <dig> symbionts and those producing the heterogeneous band-pattern . no amplification signal was detected from template-free controls or the extractions with symbiont cells omitted, indicating an absence of extracellular dna contamination.figure  <dig>

qpcr estimation of intra-genomic its <dig> ratios
the universal primers cinnerfor and cinnerrev were identically matched to conserved regions within the its <dig> of symbiodinium c <dig> and c <dig>  these primers also share identical sequences or single-base pair mismatches with nearly all clade c sequences currently available in the genbank database, including those found within the corals of lhi  <cit> . a sequence blast analysis of the target probe c100+ revealed a high specificity for symbiodinium c <dig>  with at least two nucleotide substitutions differentiating it from the majority of other clade c sequences in genbank . the cytosine at the 5’ end of the probe c100− is mismatched to c <dig>  c <dig> and the majority of other clade c symbiodinium types . this mismatch had no effect on the reaction efficiency when tested on its <dig> types c <dig> and c <dig> ; however it served to prevent cross-hybridization with the c <dig> sequence. with this exception, c100− shared an identical sequence to most clade c symbiodinium types available in genbank, including the ancestral types c <dig>  c <dig> and all derived types found in association with p. damicornis at lhi  <cit> . standard curve analysis of both taqman assays revealed acceptable reaction efficiencies when matched to their respective target sequences . qpcr analysis of known plasmid dna mixtures yielded high accuracy and precision in estimating cc100:ctotal  and an absence of cross-hybridization. taqman qpcr-generated ctotal values within each symbiodinium cell were highly correlated with, and not significantly different from those obtained from the sybr qpcr assay , indicating a negligible incidence of clade c its <dig> types other than those detected by c100+ and c100−. sybr qpcr melt curve analysis showed no tm differences between plasmid c <dig> and c <dig>  and all single-cell templates yielded single tm peaks within 1°c of the plasmid-generated values.

within-cell its <dig> copy numbers  ranged from less than  <dig> to over  <dig> , and cc100:ctotal ratios ranged between  <dig> and  <dig>  . the remaining its <dig> copies appeared to be primarily of type c <dig>  since this was the only other sequence detected in the dgge analysis. dgge band intensities generally reflected qpcr-generated ctotal values, and in cases where both c100- and c109-diagnostic bands were present, their relative intensity gave a qualitative indication of cc100:ctotal. however, the c <dig> band was generally very faint in cells featuring cc100:ctotal ratios greater than  <dig> , and universally undetectable in those above  <dig>  . a significant nonlinear correlation between cc100:ctotal and ctotal revealed that its <dig> copy numbers were higher on average in genetically homogeneous c <dig> cells than in either the heterogeneous c100/c <dig> cells or the homogeneous c <dig> cells . within-cell cc100:ctotal ratios did not differ between branches within colonies, but varied between colonies  and colony effects, respectively; table 1).figure  <dig>

discussion
assessing the incidence of recombination between divergent symbiodinium lineages is made difficult by their apparent haplontic life cycle, a lack of amenability to culture in many types , and the paucity of high-resolution single-copy genetic markers. this study attempts to circumvent these obstacles by developing protocols to isolate and extract dna from individual symbiodinium cells, establish and quantify the dominant ribotype within each genome, and test competing hypotheses explaining the observed pattern of intra-genomic variation. using these techniques, a population of putative inter-lineage recombinants is identified inhabiting the reef building coral pocillopora damicornis at the isolated, high-latitude reef of lord howe island, australia.

method development
the single-cell isolation and extraction method described here facilitated the rapid preparation of individual symbiodinium cells prior to pcr , with the potential to be further improved with the application of flow-cytometry and fluorescence activated cell sorting . the protocol also showed good efficiency, with around 85% of isolated cells undergoing successful pcr amplification. the downstream application of dgge and dna sequencing successfully revealed the dominant ribotype within individual cells, providing a reliable assessment of inter-genomic its <dig> diversity within the p. damicornis symbiont consortium. used in conjunction with plasmid cloning, this method could be used to evaluate levels of intra-genomic variation in other genetic markers, providing an important assessment of their phylogenetic utility.

the qpcr assay developed in this study offers sufficient sensitivity to quantify its <dig> ratios at the sub-clade level. this represents a significant improvement in resolution from earlier clade-level assays  <cit> , since the sub-clade presents a more ecologically-relevant taxonomic unit  <cit> . this assay is also the first to quantify polymorphic rdna sequences within individual symbiodinium cells, and the second to do so in dinoflagellates . this provides an important insight into the level of its <dig> variation within the symbiodinium genome, underscoring concerns about its utility in establishing diversity estimates  <cit> , and its suitability for quantifying the dynamics of mixed infections  <cit> . in particular, substantial differences in rdna copy numbers observed between symbiodinium types c <dig> and c <dig> highlight the perils of using its2-qpcr to estimate abundance ratios of coexisting symbionts without single-cell validation. finally, the statistical methodology developed here can identify potential admixture in symbiont populations based on intra-genomic its <dig> ratios. conflicting hypotheses of one, two and three coexisting populations were formulated, corresponding to the existence of a single symbiont clone harbouring a non-diagnostic polymorphism , the coexistence of two ‘pure’  ribotypes, and mixed populations of genetically homogeneous and heterogeneous symbiodinium cells, respectively. the model consistent with the latter hypothesis received unambiguous statistical support in all six p. damicornis colonies analysed. however, the model selection approach relies on forming a set of candidate models that are representative of the biological processes under investigation  <cit> . while the mixture model representing h <dig> is consistent with a population of recombinant genotypes coexisting with parental populations , it cannot explicitly prove this scenario. this is because a similar pattern could arise from the incomplete concerted evolution of ancestral polymorphisms .

recombination or incomplete concerted evolution of ancestral polymorphisms?
the existence of both c <dig> and c <dig> ribotypes in the homogeneous condition affirms their status as diagnostic of separate symbiodinium sub-clades . furthermore, these two ribotypes differ at five variable nucleotide sites in the its <dig> region , while ndps typically feature a single nucleotide substitution or insertion/deletion  that distinguishes them from the dominant sequence variant  <cit> . however, if both ribotypes were present within the genome of the most recent common ancestor of symbiodinium c <dig> and c <dig>  processes of concerted evolution may not have had sufficient time to homogenize the rdna arrays of both taxa. hence copies of the ribotype that is now diagnostic of the sister taxon may remain in the genome of one or both lineages. the symbiodinium genome routinely hosts a diverse assemblage of its <dig> sequences  <cit> , and several putative cases of iceap appear in the literature. for example, the its <dig> sequence diagnostic of symbiodinium glynni  also occurs within the genome of s. trenchii , with the incomplete displacement of a vestigial polymorphism invoked to explain their intra-genomic coexistence  <cit> . however, several features of the data presented here suggest that an alternative explanation of recombination is feasible. first, the c <dig> and c <dig> sequences coalesce at the ancestral type c <dig>  as opposed to either representing an intermediate evolutionary step toward the other . if concerted evolution has not had sufficient time to homogenize all c <dig> rdna repeats in the c <dig> genome, then vestigial copies of the intermediate c <dig> sequence would also likely persist as a non-dominant intra-genomic variant. rather, the c <dig> sequence was not detected in any of the cells analysed, despite its characteristic dgge band pattern . second, concerted evolutionary processes rapidly homogenize intra-genomic co-dominance, either completely displacing a non-dominant polymorphism or leaving only background traces  <cit> . this is inconsistent with the similar proportional abundance of its <dig> polymorphisms within many of the genetically heterogeneous cells observed here, with more than a third of all symbionts featuring cc100:ctotal ratios of between  <dig>  and  <dig> . finally, frequency ‘dips’ along the cc100:ctotal spectrum depict a degree of genetic isolation between genetically heterogeneous symbiodinium cells and either of the ‘pure’ genotypes , consistent with the substantial fitness loss often experienced by f <dig> and later-generation backcross genotypes .

while recombination represents a plausible explanation for the intra-genomic codominance of the c <dig> and c <dig> ribotypes, there remains a possibility that this pattern resulted from iceap. addressing this question will likely require a significant investment of resources, including the development of a suite of single-copy markers, the generation of isoclonal cultures or the application of whole genome amplification , and/or continued attempts to induce the sexual life cycle, both within and between cultured symbiodinium lineages. another area requiring investigation is the morphological, physiological and ecological characterization of putative symbiodinium recombinants. concerted evolution operates via a series of stochastic processes that occur independently of natural selection  <cit> . by contrast, recombination between lineages is often accompanied by drastic changes in morphology, performance and fitness  <cit> , even involving diversification into new habitats  <cit> . investigating the form, function, distribution and ecology of genetically heterogeneous symbiodinium cells may therefore provide further insight into the incidence and potential evolutionary effects of recombination within and between symbiodinium lineages.

background symbiont populations
the results of this study indicate that at least three its <dig> genotypes can coexist within the symbiont consortium of p. damicornis . while homogeneous symbiodinium c <dig> cells were only ever detected at background levels , the biological relevance of this population may extend well beyond providing a presumably minor contribution to the overall productivity of the symbiosis. genetically heterogeneous symbiodinium cells outnumbered ‘pure’ genotypes in more than half of the colonies sampled, suggesting that rare sexual reproduction events between c <dig> and c <dig> may facilitate asexual proliferation of the f <dig> generation, with potentially important functional implications for the coral colony. the evolutionary contribution of rare symbiodinium types may be more important still, if recombinants create a ‘bridge’ for the migration of genetic material to the dominant lineage . a small number of genetically heterogeneous symbionts featured cc100:ctotal ratios near  <dig> , and thus potentially represent f1 × c <dig> backcross genotypes. however, this pattern could equally have arisen from iceap, differential rdna inheritance in the f <dig> generation , or even concerted evolution acting to homogenize rdna variability in the recombinant genome . establishing the incidence of introgression would initially require the identification of individual f1- and backcross classes. this in turn requires the genotyping of a large number of individuals, and the analysis of at least 13– <dig> ancestry-informative loci per individual  <cit> . this study was not sufficiently resourced to carry out such a comprehensive task; however it does serve to highlight the perils of dismissing symbionts that persist in low abundance as biologically-irrelevant or simply representing surface contamination.

CONCLUSIONS
while the results presented in this study do not provide unequivocal evidence of recombination between divergent symbiodinium lineages, they provide an initial ‘proof of principle’ for its occurrence. in doing so, this study draws attention to the important evolutionary implications that may accompany the generation of new genetic diversity in symbiodinium, including the potential for rapid symbiont adaptation through introgression. progress in this area has been hindered by a lack of available methodology, an obstacle that is addressed here through the development of new molecular and statistical methods focused on the individual symbiodinium cell. additional development of this research may help to characterize and predict the evolutionary response of the coral-algal symbiosis to the many anthropogenic impacts currently threatening the world’s coral reefs.
