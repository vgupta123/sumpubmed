BACKGROUND
xenopus laevis is a model system widely used to study vertebrate development. much of our understanding of early embryo patterning and tissue induction has come from this model, and xenopus has provided many important insights into neuronal development. however, many of the molecules involved in neuronal differentiation also play crucial roles in early development  <cit> . therefore, the classical approach of injecting blastomeres with dna/mrna or antisense oligonucleotides  is of limited use for studying axon guidance as it interferes with gene function during early development and frequently leads to abnormal embryogenesis. in some cases, this problem can be circumvented by the use of inducible or tissue specific promoters  <cit>  but selective expression during a specific time-window in selected populations of cells remains difficult and levels of expression often decrease with time due to plasmid dilution during cell division  <cit> . ideally, to test the function of a specific molecule in axon guidance, its function should be disrupted exclusively during the period of axonogenesis. to this end, lipofection has proven useful to introduce dna in the developing eye and brain of stage 19– <dig> xenopus embryos  <cit>  and viral infection using vaccina virus has also been used in stage 40– <dig> xenopus embryos  <cit> . however, each of these techniques has drawbacks, such as the low efficiency of transfection of lipofection and the low expression level and reproducibility of vaccinia viral infection  <cit> . electroporation does not suffer from these limitations. indeed, its ease of use combined with efficient and accurate spatio-temporal targeting quickly established electroporation as superior to most other methods of genetic manipulations in chick embryos  <cit> .

in addition to dna and rna, electroporation can be used to deliver dsrna, rnai, antisense morpholinos , dyes and proteins  <cit> . this large repertoire and the ability to introduce several types of molecules at the same time have provided new paradigms for monitoring gene expression, cell morphology, movements and lineage, as well as efficient means for interfering with protein and microrna function  <cit> . as a result, chick electroporation has made major contributions to the understanding of gene regulation, cell proliferation, migration and differentiation, and more generally of the underlying mechanism of nervous system patterning and neuronal wiring  <cit> . electroporation methods have now been adapted for use in many animal models including mouse  <cit> , rat  <cit> , zebrafish  <cit> , ascidian  <cit> , hydra  <cit>  and drosophila  <cit> . in xenopus, electroporation has been successfully used to introduce dna into the brains of late tadpole embryos   <cit>  and rna into the cns of early neurula embryos   <cit> . although a previous study reports that stage 25–29/ <dig> embryos can be successfully electropermeablized  <cit> , electroporation has only been used during this developmental window to enhance lipofection  <cit> . thus, no electroporation protocol has been described for the intermediate developmental ages  that span the critical  <dig> h window of brain wiring, when most of the major axon tracts are formed in the xenopus cns  <cit> .

we describe here a detailed electroporation procedure to introduce efficiently both dna and mos to restricted regions of the brain and eye between stages  <dig> and 35/ <dig>  this protocol relies on the design of "electroporation chambers", tailored to individual embryonic stages, which allows reproducible and efficient large or targeted electroporation of different regions of the cns. we demonstrate that projection neurons and their targets, both intermediate and final, can be selectively manipulated by multiple targeted electroporations or a combination of electroporation and lipofection. as such, electroporation can be a reliable and efficient tool to examine gene function during cns differentiation. finally, we provide evidence of the potential benefits of electroporation for the study of axonogenesis in vitro.

RESULTS
electroporation chambers enable reproducible and efficient electroporation
efficient and reproducible electroporation relies primarily on the precision of the injection of dna. to control injection accuracy, stage 21–35/ <dig> embryos must be held in the desired position and submerged in a drop of medium, as they easily deform and are highly sensitive to drying. previously published electroporation procedures could not be used because they do not permit accurate orientation of the embryos  <cit>  nor take into account the soft-tissue vulnerability or morphology of the targeted stages  <cit> . therefore, we developed electroporation chambers tailored individually to the size and morphology of embryos from stages  <dig> to 35/ <dig>  the basic design of the chambers consists of two channels carved perpendicular to one another in sylgard in the shape of a cross . the embryo is held in the longitudinal channel while the electrodes are placed in the transverse channel. the size and geometry of the longitudinal channel was optimized for each embryonic stage to provide a "snug fit" for the embryo and full immersion in medium. the position of the transverse channel insures reproducible placement of the electrodes along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo and its depth controls the amount of electrode surface in contact with the medium, and thus the dorso-ventral extent of the embryo exposed to the electric field. the length of the transverse channel is designed so that when electrodes are placed at each end, electroporation efficiency is maximized while damage to the embryo is minimized. in addition, the spacing and immobilization of the electrodes in the transverse channel enable accurate positioning prior to injection. this allows the electric field to be applied immediately after dna injection which is critical for minimizing diffusion and backflow of the injected solution through the opening made by the capillary  <cit> .

electroporation leads to efficient transfection in xenopus
to determine the optimal conditions for xenopus electroporation, voltage, frequency and duration of electrical pulses were systematically varied using the experimental set-up illustrated in figure 1a . 93% of the embryos  injected at stage 26– <dig> into the third ventricle with a solution containing  <dig> μg/μl of green fluorescent protein  encoding plasmids exhibited bright gfp expression  <dig> h after being exposed to  <dig> square-pulses of  <dig> v  <dig> ms applied every second  . efficient transfection required a high conductivity electroporation medium as the success rate dropped  <dig> -fold  when  <dig> × modified barth's saline  was used instead of 1× mbs or 1× modified modified ringer's  . the high conductance of the medium surrounding the low conducting embryo could enhance electroporation by preventing the decrease of electric field inside the embryo as shown on cellular spheroids  <cit> . as summarized in figure 1d , a series of  <dig> or more 15– <dig> v pulses with a duration of 25– <dig> ms each led to >60% electroporation success rate. electroporation efficiency consistently increased in proportion to pulse number, voltage and duration . a decrease in voltage or pulse duration could be partially compensated for by increasing the number of pulses.

to further characterize the efficiency of electroporation, nucleus-targeted gfp  was transfected to quantify the fraction of gfp-expressing versus non-expressing cells on transverse brain sections counterstained with a nuclear stain .  <dig> h after electroporation , the average fraction of cells expressing gfp per section was  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in the transfected region . transfected cells were scattered along 50–70% of the dorso-ventral axis and throughout the whole neuroepithelium. at this stage, the brain comprises a proliferative region adjacent to the ventricle lumen  surrounded by layers of migrating and differentiating neurons .  <dig> h post-electroporation, transfected cells were present in both regions. gfp-expressing cells residing in the superficial third of the brain, populated by differentiated neurons, represented  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of total labeled cells . however, the fraction of transfected cells in the superficial half of the brain increased with pulse duration . to check the morphology of transfected cells and further characterize their cell types, we transfected membrane-targeted gfp or rfp . as expected, the gfp signal was found from the ventricle to the neuropil . cells lining the ventricle could be seen extending radial process towards the pia, typical of dividing cells . transfected neurons appeared to differentiate normally as they expressed the neuronal marker acetylated tubulin, and sent long processes into the neuropil . furthermore, several axon tracts could be recognized in a whole-mount view of the brain .

finally, we assayed the potential adverse side effects of electroporation. electroporation did not increase either the embryo death rate or the occurrence of morphological abnormalities, provided the pulse voltage remained under  <dig> v and the pulse duration under  <dig> ms . the anatomy of the embryos and their brains appeared normal on transverse sections at all time points after electroporation tested . some pyknotic nuclei were observed in highly transfected embryos in the first  <dig> h post-electroporation. therefore, tunel staining was used to assess cell death on sections.  <dig> h after exposure to  <dig> v/ <dig> ms/ <dig> s/ <dig> x and  <dig> v/ <dig> ms/ <dig> s/ <dig> x, the average number of tunel positive cells per section was  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and  <dig>  ±  <dig>   respectively . this compares favorably with an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cells/section  in control embryos and indicates that the electric pulses are relatively harmless per se. however, other parameters such as dna purity, embryo quality, manipulation and injection are critical for minimizing cell death. thus, electroporation of ventricular injected dna led to efficient transfection of both the dividing ventricular region and differentiated neurons without increasing cell death or affecting their morphological differentiation.

electroporation at different stages produces rapid and long-lasting transgene expression
neuronal differentiation and initial establishment of the major axonal projections progress rapidly from stage  <dig> to  <dig> and, during this period, the neuroepithelium undergoes major reorganization with post-mitotic neurons migrating away from the ventricular surface to the superficial layers. to achieve fine temporal resolution, the electroporation procedure should be similarly efficient across different time-windows. therefore, we compared the efficiency of the electroporation protocol over different stages.

embryos were electroporated following intraventricular pcs2gfp-dna injection at stages ranging from  <dig> to 35/ <dig> in chambers specially adapted to their morphology. external inspection of embryos under the fluorescent strereomicroscope showed that the fraction of embryos exhibiting bright gfp expression  <dig> h after electroporation was >70%, regardless of the stage at which the electroporation was performed. despite these similar levels at a gross level, analysis of the gfp positive cell fraction  on transverse sections revealed that a sharp decrease in efficiency occurs at stage  <dig> . in addition, the gfp-expressing cells from late  electroporations were distributed unevenly in the neuroepithelium. first, there was a marked decline in the number of transfected cells in the ventral brain. indeed, the dorsal shift of the gfp-expression center of mass  significantly increased  <dig> -fold between stages  <dig> and  <dig>  secondly,  <dig> h after electroporation, fewer gfp-positive cells can be found in the superficial region of the neuroepithelium closest to the pia . several factors may contribute to the observed changes. as the brain develops, the ventricle lumen expands and post-mitotic cells migrate away from the ventricular surface to differentiate in superficial layers. consequently, many cells are distant to the injection site, making them less likely to be transfected. in addition, a larger ventricle means a lower intraventricular concentration of injected dna, which will restrict the transfection to cells lining the ventricle and decrease the electroporation efficiency overall. in agreement with this, doubling the injection volume enhances the electroporation success rate by  <dig>  . however, if the local dna concentration was the only factor involved, a stage-dependent distribution of gfp positive cells would be expected shortly after electroporation. in fact,  <dig> h after electroporation the fraction of gfp positive cells located in the superficial half of the brain was similar in embryos electroporated at stage  <dig> and  <dig> . the delayed onset of the stage-dependent difference in deep-superficial distribution suggests that it results at least partly from developmental changes in patterns of cell proliferation and migration that occur after electroporation.

in order to gain access to the cells situated close to the pia, we delivered dna to the pial surface by injecting under the skin epidermis instead of intraventricularly . subcutaneous injections, followed immediately by electroporation, efficiently and selectively transfected cells in superficial layers of the brain .

overall, gfp expression in embryos electroporated between stages  <dig> to 35/ <dig> displayed similar kinetics. in whole embryos, the gfp signal can first be detected 5– <dig> h after electroporation. this signal progressively intensifies and spreads over the subsequent  <dig> h, and remains high for several days. nuclear gfp was used to quantify the gfp expression at different time points on transverse sections of embryos electroporated at stage 29/ <dig>  a progressive increase in both the fraction and the average intensity of the gfp positive cells was observed between  <dig> and  <dig> h post-electroporation . the sigmoid shape of gfp kinetics likely reflects the requirement for a progressive accumulation of the gfp signal in the transfected cells to reach the detection threshold, combined with proliferation of transfected progenitors. interestingly,  <dig> h after intraventricular injection/electroporation  of stage 29/ <dig> embryos,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the gfp positive cells were found in the superficial half of the brain, suggesting that electroporation efficiently targets both proliferating and differentiated cells. the wide range of stages amenable to electroporation, combined with the quick onset of transgene expression, demonstrates that this technique provides precise temporal control.

controlling spatial targeting to study axon guidance: the retino-tectal projection
the spatial selectivity allowed by electroporation has proven useful for axon guidance studies  <cit> . thus, using the well-characterized retinotectal projection system, we next asked if our procedure could enable selective transfection of retinal ganglion cells  and/or the regions through which their axons travel. normally, axons from rgcs exit the eye, travel along the optic nerve to enter the brain at the ventral diencephalon. after crossing the midline at the optic chiasm, they extend dorsally through the optic tract in the diencephalon before turning caudally to reach the optic tectum, where they arborize and form synapses.

since only the region lying between the two electrodes is efficiently electroporated, different areas can be selectively electroporated by sliding the embryo forward or backward in the main channel to expose the rostral or caudal part of the head . this configuration gives rise to large transfected areas, extending rostro-caudally over  <dig> ±  <dig>  μm . taking advantage of the insulating property of sylgard, the electroporated region can be restricted by narrowing the transverse channel , making specific electroporation of the embryonic tectum or diencephalon feasible . in addition, the relative orientation of embryos to the electrodes can be changed to drive dna towards different regions. using modified chambers, the ventral-most regions of the brain, which are usually difficult to electroporate, can be targeted, allowing electroporation of the optic chiasm region .

to specifically electroporate the eye, embryos were placed belly up so that the eye, but not the brain, was aligned with the electrodes . this avoided non-targeted electroporation of the brain, which is important as the lumen of the eye vesicle, where the dna injection is made, communicates directly with the brain ventricles at early stages . eye specific electroporation was successfully performed over a range of stages from  <dig> to 35/ <dig> without affecting eye development . the success rate, evaluated  <dig> h after electroporation, was over 80%.  <dig> h after electroporation, all layers of the retina were transfected and cellular morphology within the retina appeared normal . interestingly, when eyes were electroporated at stage  <dig>  gfp-positive cells were widely distributed in early stage 33/ <dig> retina only  <dig> h after transfection . eye-targeted electroporation yielded high levels of transgene co-expression when pcs2gfp and pcs2gap-rfp plasmids were injected in a 1: <dig> ratio.  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the gfp positive cells were rfp positive and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the rfp expressing cells were also gfp positive . more importantly, the co-electroporation efficiency remained high even if different types of plasmids were mixed . co-electroporation enables multiple perturbations as well as easy monitoring of the transfected cells. indeed, rgc axons can be easily analyzed both in transverse sections  and in the whole brain  after gap-gfp electroporation. in addition, gap-gfp transfection enables powerful time-lapse analysis of extending retinal axons and growth cone dynamics to be performed in vivo   <cit> . fixed sample analysis as well as live monitoring of gap-gfp expressing rgc axons show that electroporation does not perturb axonal growth, navigation or branching. thus, electroporation is suitable for manipulating and monitoring rgc axons at stages when lipofection has proven to be difficult.

finally, we asked if both the eye and the pathway where retinal axons grow  could be manipulated separately within the same embryo. we electroporated eyes at stage  <dig> with gap-rfp and brains  <dig> h later at stage  <dig> with gap-gfp. we found that dual-electroporation produced specific expression both within the eye and pathway. importantly, dual electroporation did not decrease embryo viability or cause abnormal development , and did not affect brain anatomy . furthermore, eye-specific electroporation can be combined with either large or area-specific brain electroporation . similarly, brain electroporation was successfully performed on eye-lipofected embryos . thus, dual-electroporation provides a way to separately control transgene expression in the retinal axons versus the substrate pathway enabling in vivo analysis of axon-target and axon-pathway interactions.

targeted loading of antisense morpholinos by electroporation
in addition to dna transfection, intracellular delivery of antisense morpholinos  was tested. mos are an effective tool to knock-down protein expression in xenopus through blastomere injection  <cit>  but their inability to be taken up through the plasma membrane has limited their use at late stages. standard mos are uncharged and, therefore, cannot be electroporated. however, mos can be fluorescently tagged for visualization and, fortuitously, the tag introduces a charge making them amenable to electroporation  <cit> . electroporation of mos in chick has been used to study nervous system development, and single cell electroporation in the brain of late-stage xenopus embryos has been reported  <cit> .

lissamine-tagged mos were electroporated into both the brains and the eyes of stage  <dig> to 33/ <dig> embryos with a success rate of over 80% with all four settings used . in transverse sections, mo-loaded cells were evenly distributed throughout the width of the electroporated side of neuroepithelium, and along most of its dorso-ventral axis . with eye-targeted electroporation, mo-positive cells were found in all of the cellular layers of the retina . in all conditions tested, mo fluorescence was still detectable  <dig> h after electroporation.

plasmids were also successfully co-electroporated with negatively charged mos  . for example,  <dig> h after eye-targeted electroporation ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the gfp expressing cells were mo positive . however, in this condition the mo positive domain was slightly larger than the gfp-expressing domain , resulting in  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mo-loaded cells expressing the gfp . finally, as gfp accumulates progressively the degree of co-localization will change slightly with time and should be taken into consideration.

at a cellular level, electroporated mos seem to diffuse evenly around the cytosol and into the nucleus. although short neuronal processes could be visualized with the mo fluorescence, longer processes were usually so weakly labeled that they were difficult to follow. however, co-transfection with gap-gfp highlighted axons emanating from the electroporated rgcs, making monitoring of axons from mo-loaded cells feasible .

finally, we took advantage of the high co-electroporation efficiency to test the ability of the loaded mo to down-regulate translation of its target mrna. a pcs <dig> plasmid encoding gfp was electroporated with or without a mo designed to block gfp expression  <cit> . using this mo directed against the pcs2+ and cytoplasmic gfp sequences flanking the gfp start codon, we observed a 4-fold decrease of the gfp signal both in the eye and the brain when the mo against gfp was co-electroporated with pcs2gfp . however, this decrease could be due to biased electroporation and/or nonspecific effects of the anti-gfp mo . to rule out such problems, the experiments were performed on the targetable  and non-targetable gfp  in the presence of a control tagged mo to assess the electroporation efficiency. co-electroporation of the gfp mo only decreased the expression of the targetable plasmid . the decrease of the fluorescent ratio of the gfp over gap-rfp signal in the gfp mo electroporated eyes further supports a specific effect of the mo on the gfp . in conclusion, our electroporation procedure enables efficient loading of mos without impairing their activity in vivo. this suggests that, similar to chick, controlled spatio-temporal mo knock-down approaches could be achieved by electroporation in early tadpole xenopus embryos. furthermore, electroporation allows sequential modifications of gene function when used in combination with other techniques such as lipofection .

in vivo electroporation provides source of transfected/mo-loaded neurons for in vitro studies
the embryonic xenopus brain is extremely small, posing challenges for obtaining a sufficiently large number of cells to perform dissociated cell electroporation protocols  <cit>  and alternative transfection methods have low efficiencies  <cit> . for example, mo uptake by xenopus retinal cultures is inefficient even when specific transmembrane trafficking molecules, such as endo-porter  are used . thus, most xenopus transfected or mo-loaded cells used in culture have been obtained from embryos injected at early blastomere stages  <cit> . however, premature death or abnormalities of injected embryos limit the spectrum of mos or constructs that can be used to analyze later events in vitro. therefore, we cultured explants or dissociated cells from different parts of brains electroporated with gap-gfp dna and/or fluorescently tagged control mos . as shown in figure 6n–q, both mo-loaded and dna transfected cells can be successfully cultured and up to 40% of the cultured cells showed expression. moreover, the positive-expressing explants and dissociated cells were readily detected, even at low magnifications suggesting that intracellular levels of the mo and the dna were high. in culture, mos could be readily seen in axons and growth cones , and could still be detected after  <dig> days in vitro. this makes in vivo electroporation a potent source of transfected cells for in vitro approaches.

CONCLUSIONS
we describe here an optimized procedure to electroporate different brain regions and the eye from stage  <dig> to 35/ <dig> xenopus embryos. both mos and dna were delivered with high efficiency and with limited side effects. electroporation enables both over-expression and knock-down studies to be performed in a spatiotemporally controlled manner. furthermore, the high co-electroporation  efficiency makes perturbation of several genes feasible and could be useful for identifying and monitoring events in the mo or dna electroporated cells such as pathfinding or axon branching analysis. in addition, mo-dna co-electroporation enables "rescue" experiments to be performed. finally, using different electroporation protocols or dna concentrations, expression levels can be kept low enough to avoid mis-localization and/or toxicity of over-expressed markers, or maximized to reach efficient concentration of dominant-negative proteins.

the electroporation chambers we designed confer several advantages. first, they enable a large number of embryos to be electroporated rapidly in a reproducible way . chambers can be readily made to fit embryos of different ages, and appropriate placement of the embryo within the chamber allows different parts of the developing nervous system to be targeted. furthermore, chambers can also be made to accommodate zebrafish embryos for which electroporation protocols have been recently developed   <cit> . thus, our method has a wide range of prospective applications, both in xenopus and in other organisms. indeed, targeting of various other regions of interest for axon guidance  and double brain-targeted electroporations were successfully performed .

one main advantage of our protocol is that electroporation can be controlled spatiotemporally, which means that secondary defects arising from early gene manipulations can be avoided. indeed, the present protocol provides the degree of targeting precision  required to selectively electroporate eye or brain regions in xenopus embryos. as electroporation efficiency remained high at all the stages tested, the described parameters can be used to investigate gene function at a critical time for nervous system development. electroporation also leads to quicker detectable expression of the dna than most available techniques  <cit> . this rapid onset of transgene expression is particularly useful since in many cases only several hours are needed for an axon to complete its growth. as rna can be successfully electroporated , the delay between electroporation and protein expression could be further shortened. finally, spatiotemporal control of expression could be further refined by using specific promoters  <cit> .

lastly, electroporation of previously electroporated or lipofected embryos enables sequential modification of the same region, or a combination of specific modifications of both neurons and the environment through which their axons navigate. the ability to genetically manipulate both the presynaptic neurons and the pathway/targets of their axons in the same embryo will provide a valuable new experimental paradigm for investigating axon-pathway and axon-target interactions in vivo and in vitro. for instance, co-electroporation of suitable makers in double transfected embryos may provide unique insights into the cellular interaction in vivo between axons and the environment, or between axon terminals and their synaptic partners.
