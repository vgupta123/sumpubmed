BACKGROUND
as reported by connor and colleagues  <cit> : "the mammary gland is a complex organ of various tissue and cell types that will undergo multiple stages of growth, differentiation, secretory activity, and involution during the lifetime of a female mammal". among the "various tissues" the parenchyma , which is, in lactating mammary gland, the tissue that synthesizes and secretes milk, and the fat pad , which is a matrix of connective and adipose tissue surrounding the par  <cit> , are considered the most crucial during post-natal development.

interactions between par and mfp during bovine mammary development are still not fully understood. it has been postulated that during mammary development the mfp surrounding par exerts proliferative effects on the par through secretion of local modulators of growth induced by the impacts of selected systemic hormones   <cit>  or growth factors   <cit> . it is believed that such an effect occurs because the epithelial tissue that is in direct contact with the mfp has a greater degree of proliferation compared with the more central epithelial tissue  <cit> .

local interaction between par and mfp could occur in both directions, i.e., mfp acts on par and par acts on surrounding mfp  <cit> . how these tissues could communicate through locally-produced modulators has not yet been studied in the pre-weaning prepubertal bovine mammary gland. hovey and colleagues  <cit> , using prepubertal ewes, showed that igf <dig> mrna expression was greater in mfp cells adjacent to par than in mfp cells with no par contact, which indicated the existence of a local "diffusible factor" secreted by par that could increase the expression of igf isoform in mfp. based on those findings, a potential crosstalk between the two tissues was suggested. it was proposed that mfp stimulates par and par then exerts a positive feedback on the mfp during development  <cit> .

mammary gland development and tissue interactions have been previously studied using gene expression analysis. for example, in a serial slaughter study  <cit>  it was observed that peak expression of igf <dig> in mfp and estrogen receptor-α  in par from  <dig> kg body weight holstein heifers coincided with peak mammary epithelial cell proliferation  <cit> . expression of both genes decreased in mammary tissue in older animals. regarding tissue interaction, thorn and colleagues  <cit>  hypothesized that the mfp could impact par through inflammation-related proteins, such as tnfα, il- <dig>  and il-1β. they showed in vitro the inhibitory effect on proliferation of tnfα, but not il- <dig> or il-1β, on epithelial cell proliferation.

li and colleagues  <cit>  conducted a microarray study exploring the interaction between mfp and par in response to estrogen treatment in prepubertal heifers. results indicated that mfp might affect par cell proliferation via the secretion of paracrine stimulators such as the stem cell growth factor precursor c-type lectin domain family  <dig> member a  and igf- <dig>  despite work conducted to date, there is still uncertainty regarding how par and mfp tissues interact during mammary development in prepubertal heifers prior to weaning.

in the present study, mammary glands of pre-weaned holstein heifer calves were harvested at  <dig> d of age to extract total rna for microarray analysis. extensive bioinformatics analysis of microarray data was performed to  characterize differences in transcript profiles between mammary par and mfp, with the specific aim of uncovering predominant transcriptomic signatures, and  uncover predominant signaling molecules  in one tissue relative to the other. the latter would allow for the identification of potential targets among genes that are more highly expressed in the other tissue in order to discover novel inter-tissue signaling networks.

1fold-difference between tissues 

functional analysis of deg between par and mfp
the ipa analysis results using all deg with ≥ <dig> -fold between par and mfp are reported in detail in additional file  <dig>  briefly, cell movement, cell death, cell growth and proliferation, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, and tissue development were the top  <dig> functions among deg with ≥ <dig> -fold expression difference. among canonical pathways, the top  <dig> were aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling, metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome p <dig>  propanoate metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, lps/il- <dig> inhibition of rxr function, xenobiotic metabolism signaling, α-adrenergic signaling, p <dig> signaling, and acute phase response signaling. interestingly, all of the mentioned pathways were primarily, if not completely, enhanced by genes that were more highly-expressed in mfp vs. par. the exception was p <dig> signaling, which was mostly enriched by genes more highly-expressed in par vs. mfp 

results of the most-enriched biological processes from the gene ontology  analysis that considered all deg with ≥  <dig> -fold between the two tissues are reported in figure  <dig> and in more detail in additiona file  <dig>  cell signaling and development were among the most enriched biological processes. among signaling-associated go biological process categories  more highly expressed among deg in par relative to mfp, those associated with the protein kinase cascade and cell activation were most predominant. the same types of molecules were enriched in most of development-associated categories. other functions enriched among deg with ≥  <dig> -fold in par vs. mfp were associated with cell death, cell organization and biogenesis, metabolism and homeostasis, and localization and transport . biological process categories enriched among deg ≥  <dig> -fold in mfp vs. par were related to wound healing, catabolic processes, and regulation of localization and transport.

functions overrepresented in deg ≥  <dig> -fold in par vs. mfp
the main results from the functional analysis with ipa are reported in table  <dig>  complete details of the analysis and associated genes are reported in additional file  <dig>  among  <dig> significantly-enriched functions , most pertained to functions related to cell development and structure, which became more evident when compared to the functional analysis of deg more highly expressed in mfp vs. par . for example, the most-enriched functions among deg more highly expressed in par vs. mfp  were cell death, cell growth and proliferation, cellular development, cellular movement, and cell morphology. enrichment of these opposing processes likely reflects the different cell types within par to accommodate the remodeling. detailed functional analysis of deg that were more highly-expressed in par vs. mfp suggested a greater degree of apoptosis, proliferation/growth/development, movement and adhesion of cells, and morphogenesis/shaping of cells in par vs. mfp . overall, angiogenesis, dna metabolism, and survival of mammals functions were enriched  in par when compared to mfp. however, detailed analysis of deg did not indicate induction of gene expression associated with these specific functions.

the most-enriched biological processes from go analysis within deg with ≥  <dig> -fold higher expression in par vs. mfp were associated with cell organization , development, differentiation, cell cycle, negative regulation of nucleotide metabolism, negative regulation of transcription, response to dna damage, and antigen presentation and inhibition of immune system process . among molecular functions, the most enriched related to binding, particularly protein  and nucleotide binding . also, functions related to transcription, and particularly repression of transcription, zinc binding, kinases, and cytokine activity were significantly enriched . the most-enriched cellular components in par were of cytosolic origin, particularly components associated with cytoskeleton and intracellular non-membrane-bound organelles. components related to the nucleus, particularly chromosome allocation were also noted .

functions overrepresented in deg with ≥  <dig> -fold expression in mfp vs. par
the most-abundant functions among deg that were more highly-expressed in mfp vs. par are reported in table  <dig>  complete details of the functional analysis and associated genes are reported in the additional file  <dig>  metabolic functions related to transport and lipid synthesis and oxidation were among the most significantly-enriched. in addition, ipa analysis of genes more highly expressed in mfp vs. par suggested that mfp compared with par had a greater degree of cell migration, carbohydrate metabolism, activation of cells, and a lower cellular growth and proliferation .

the go analysis indicated that deg more highly-expressed in mfp vs. par enriched significantly metabolism, particularly lipid biosynthesis, catabolism, and oxidation . a more important role of signaling in mfp compared with par was suggested by the significant enrichment of signaling response-related genes, particularly for response to insulin and cytokines . among cellular functions, the overall analysis indicated a large enrichment of enzyme activity and transport, with the former related to phosphate metabolism and oxidoreductase activity and the latter related to ion  and carbohydrate transport with a large enrichment of passive transport-related molecules . the only significantly-enriched cellular component in mfp was the mitochondria and its related membranes .

main canonical pathways overrepresented among deg with ≥  <dig> -fold between par and mfp
in par, the main canonical pathway overrepresented was actin cytoskeleton signaling. this pathway was significantly enriched with an fdr ≤  <dig>  and appeared that it was enhanced among deg with >  <dig> -fold expression in par vs. mfp . other pathways appeared to be enriched  at a lower level of significance . most of those are related to signaling  and cell cycle . detailed visualization of the pathways  suggested an autocrine effect on actin cytoskeleton signaling elicited by fgf , pdgf , and fn <dig> , all molecules that were more highly-expressed in par vs. mfp . among the canonical pathways enriched with a non-corrected p-value ≤  <dig> , a detailed analysis of wnt/β-catenin and pi3k/akt signaling revealed a potentially crucial role for these in increasing cell cycle activity  and apoptosis as well as increasing protein synthesis through mtor .

1reported also are the pathways with benjamini-hochberg fdr ≤  <dig> .

the deg more highly-expressed in mfp vs. par had a significant  enrichment of  <dig> canonical pathways with a large presence of metabolic pathways . most of the significantly-enriched canonical pathways were involved in energy utilization, especially utilization of glucose, fatty acids, and several amino acids as sources of energy. among signaling pathways, most pertained to immune response  and stress/catabolic response . the overall analysis of canonical pathways suggested an increase in oxidation of organic compounds as also suggested by functional ipa and go analyses . the canonical pathway analysis also indicated an inherently-greater predisposition of mfp to mount an immune response compared with par.

one noteworthy canonical pathway highlighted by the analysis was igf- <dig> signaling, which was enriched at an uncorrected p-value ≤  <dig>  . the lack of significant enrichment potentially suggests a lower importance of this pathway, but due to the known importance of igf- <dig> in mammary development and the likely existence of crosstalk between par and mfp  <cit>  we have reported details related to this pathway. detailed analysis revealed an enrichment of several genes that are downstream  effectors of igf- <dig> and its signaling, which overall seems to suggest an increase in cell growth and survival . however, a number of upstream effectors  also were enriched in mfp. the above agree with results from daniels et al.  <cit>  using the same tissues as in the present study. due to the indication by the functional analysis  of an apparent decrease in overall cell proliferation, it could be possible that the igfbps exerted some level of control on igf- <dig> availability to mfp in these animals

transcription factors potentially controlling deg with ≥  <dig> -fold expression between par and mfp
long-term transcriptomic adaptations of tissues are driven by transcription factors , which sense external stimuli and allow cellular functions to adapt to the specific stimulus. among deg more highly-expressed in par vs. mfp, ipa identified  <dig> transcriptional regulators and  <dig> ligand-dependent nuclear receptors . twenty-nine tf are potentially able to affect the expression of the other  <dig> deg more highly expressed in par vs. mfp, based on the ipa knowledge base . most of the genes in the transcriptional networks  are involved in cell cycle and proliferation   and tp53). interestingly, several genes encoding cytokines and growth factors  were present in the transcriptional networks, particularly as potential targets of myc, tp <dig>  and catenin beta  <dig>  .

reported in bold font are cytokines and growth factors differentially expressed in one of the two tissues which can potentially interact with highly-expressed deg in the other tissue as shown in networks reported in figure  <dig> and  <dig>

 <dig> cytokines  and growth factor 

 <dig> fold difference  in gene expression between tissues

among deg highly-expressed in mfp vs. par, we uncovered  <dig> tf and  <dig> ligand-dependent nuclear receptors . rxrg  and pparg  had the largest differences in expression in mfp vs. par . ipa transcriptional networks indicated that  <dig> of those tf could potentially affect the expression of  <dig> more highly expressed genes in mfp vs. par . pparg, hepatic nuclear factor  <dig> alpha , kruppel-like factor  <dig>  , early growth response  <dig> , and v-fos fbj murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog  had potentially larger effects on transcription of genes with greater expression in mfp vs. par . pparg controls the expression of several enzymes involved in triacylglycerol synthesis and also expression of adipokines, such as adiponectin  and leptin . the major functions of the transcriptional networks among more highly expressed deg in mfp vs. par were lipid metabolism  and cellular movement.

cytokines and growth factors among deg with ≥  <dig> -fold expression between par and mfp
a total of  <dig> genes classified as growth factors and  <dig> genes classified as cytokines had ≥  <dig> -fold greater expression in par vs. mfp . among these were osteopontin  and chemokine  ligand  <dig> , which were 22- and  <dig> -fold greater in par vs. mfp . there were  <dig> genes classified as growth factors and  <dig> classified as cytokines with greater expression in mfp vs. par . among these were adipoq and fgf <dig>  which were 42- and  <dig> -fold greater in mfp vs. par.

gene network analysis revealed that most of the signaling molecules identified can potentially elicit effects on  <dig> -fold deg between par and mfp . among these is interleukin  <dig> beta , which had greater expression in par vs. mfp in qpcr analysis , and had the largest number of connections with deg that were highly-expressed in mfp vs. par . among the various actions of il1b, it can affect the expression of several tf, some of which were highly expressed in mfp vs. par: pparg and thrsp expression, crucial for lipid synthesis, is inhibited by il1b, whereas endothelial pas domain protein  <dig>  and nr1d <dig> expression is increased by the same cytokine . il1b also appears to control the expression of several cytokines and growth factors potentially more actively secreted by mfp compared with par , including inhibition of lep and fgf <dig>  and activation of il1a .

other signaling molecules that are likely secreted in greater amounts by par than mfp include fgf <dig> and neuregulin  <dig> . based on ipa annotations, fgf <dig> decreases the expression of stearoyl-coa desaturase  while it increases the expression of fatty acid synthase ; whereas, nrg <dig> appears to regulate the expression of several tf such as fos and egr <dig> . these two molecules could potentially control the expression of several genes that were more highly-expressed in mfp vs. par . in addition, il <dig> and chemokine  ligand  <dig> , potentially released by par, may have determined the greater expression of il <dig> in mfp vs. par .

among cytokines and growth factors potentially released to a greater extent from mfp compared with par, il <dig>  fgf <dig>  il1a, and lep had the largest number of potential interactions with deg that had greater expression in par vs. mfp . fgf <dig> may affect a number of biological events through increasing the expression of il1b and pdgfa, decreasing the expression of ccl <dig>  and decreasing the activation of tp <dig> in par. the transcription factor tp <dig> might control the expression of many genes in par . il <dig> also might control the expression of several of the same cytokines and growth factors controlled by fgf <dig> . lep might increase expression of several enzymes involved in metabolism  as well as decrease the expression of esr <dig>  which seems to have a central role in regulating expression of several other transcription factors  as well as the prolactin receptor  in par . lastly, it is noteworthy to highlight the cytokine il1a for its effects on increasing expression of myc, one of the most studied cytokines with a demonstrated role in many functions, chiefly growth and development  <cit> .

integrative model of potential interactions between mfp and par
results from the functional and gene networks analyses of microarray data were used to develop an integrative model of putative interactions between mfp and par . the model highlights growth factors and cytokines that seem to be preferentially expressed in one tissue versus the other. based on our analysis, which relied on data within the ipa knowledge base, it appears that many of these molecules could interact with genes preferentially expressed in the other tissue and affect a wide range of molecular and cellular functions .

microarray data verification through qpcr
twenty-four out of  <dig> genes selected were verified via qpcr . these genes were chosen based on their level of expression between tissues as well as their associated biological function. in contrast with microarray data, il1b had greater expression in par vs. mfp which was probably due to presence of unspecific binding of the labeled cdna probe to the oligo on the microarray. genes confirmed to have greater expression in par vs. mfp were ltf, tnc, spp <dig>  prlr, csn <dig>  esr <dig>  a2m, actb, cdh <dig>  myc, ctnnb <dig>  and tp <dig> .

discussion
general considerations
the potential crosstalk between mfp and par during bovine mammary development has been recognized for some time . in addition to ovarian steroids  <cit>  and other mammogenic hormones  <cit> , it is believed that various proteins secreted by the mfp  act as local regulators of mammary gland growth and morphogenesis  <cit> . in this regard, greater expression of igf <dig> in mfp and esr <dig> in par tissue has been associated with greater rates of cell proliferation in mammary gland of early prepubertal animals  than older animals   <cit> . in support of this, regardless of nutritional management during the pre-weaning period, ellis and capuco  <cit>  demonstrated that there was more epithelial cell proliferation at  <dig> mo than at  <dig> or  <dig> mo age. those data indicated that mammary gland development and growth is substantial during the pre-weaning period.

despite the large volume of research regarding development of mammary gland, the functional characterization of mammary par and mfp including the underlying gene networks and pathways, as well as putative interactions between both tissues during early development remain to be fully elucidated. the use of transcriptomics analysis via microarrays in combination with bioinformatics analysis can lead to an explosion of biological findings and help uncover potential crosstalk between the par and mfp which might affect long-term development of the mammary gland. only a few studies have attempted to use transcriptomics to study par and mfp. for example, li and colleagues  <cit>  have characterized the transcriptome of mfp and par tissue in  <dig> mo old ovariectomized dairy heifers treated with estrogen and they indentified several genes, most novel, thought to be regulated by estrogen in mfp and par, underscoring a crucial role for estrogen in mammary development at this post-weaning stage. we are not aware of similar transcriptomics characterizations in pre-weaned heifers.

in the present study, we have attempted to provide a molecular signature of par and mfp using microarrays to uncover genes more highly expressed in one tissue vs. the other. we have corroborated those data through bioinformatics analysis in order to uncover potential molecules involved in the putative crosstalk between par and mfp in pre-weaned heifers. our approach is novel but has the "limitation" common to most bioinformatics tools, as well as transcript annotation, in that the results are based on human and rodent data, as opposed to bovine. however, the large evolutionary similarity between mammalian species  provides reasonable confidence that most of the results in the present study will be suitable for future hypothesis-driven molecular biology experiments.

mechanisms of tissue development inferred from functional genomics and pathway analysis
the majority of genes that could be classified as preferentially-expressed in mfp or par were associated with cellular growth and proliferation, cellular or tissue development, metabolism, and cellular movement . it was evident from ipa analysis, however, that functional findings encompassed cells other than epithelial cells or adipocytes, e.g., immune and blood/endothelial cells, and fibroblasts . these responses are not entirely unexpected given our tissue collection protocol, i.e., non-homogeneous cell types within par and mfp.

overall, it was noteworthy that deg more highly expressed in par vs. mfp were enriched significantly and in a greater number  in the above categories. furthermore, proliferation and cell cycle were enriched in go analysis of deg that were more highly-expressed in par vs. mfp . the evidently larger growth and proliferation of par relative to mfp uncovered by transcriptomics agrees with findings by meyer and colleagues  <cit>  who showed that par dna  was affected more by age than weight of the animal; whereas, the mfp was more affected by nutrition than age. in addition, even though it was not discussed by those authors, calculation of data reported by meyer and colleagues  <cit>  indicated a greater relative increase  in par than mfp weight and also greater relative increase in mg par dna than mfp dna.

in support of greater relative growth in par vs. mfp, which is by definition an increase in size or number, the top signaling pathways in deg more highly expressed in par vs. mfp  were all related to cell cycle progression . among those, calcium signaling through pi3k has been associated with cell proliferation and stimulation of quiescent cells to re-enter the cell cycle, thus, initiating mitosis  <cit> . in addition, the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has been related to control of cell proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . besides cell growth and proliferation, significantly-enriched functions among the genes with greater expression in par vs. mfp were related to apoptosis, cell adhesion, cell organization and biogenesis, and development . those data clearly indicated that besides growth in number and dimension of cells, the mammary par underwent a larger degree of re-organization, both within each cell and between cells to form a highly-organized tissue compared to mfp, which is consistent with greater differentiation in par compared to mfp . the larger degree of organization to support growth in par vs. mfp also is supported by the significant enrichment and, apparently, induced actin cytoskeleton signaling .

the deg more highly expressed in mfp vs. par indicated that mfp had a more predominant "metabolism-associated" deg profile compared with par, i.e., lipid metabolism, molecular transport , and carbohydrate metabolism were among the most-enriched functions . furthermore, lxr/rxr and tr/rxr activation were among enriched signaling pathways . to some extent these findings are not unexpected and could partly be explained by the fact that this tissue is mainly composed of adipocytes, a feature reflected by the higher level of expression of rxrg , pparg , nr1d <dig> , and klf <dig>  all of which belong to classical pro-adipogenic pathways   <cit> .

when we considered the effect on function among deg more highly expressed in mfp vs. par, the large enrichment of tissue development  indicated morphological remodeling. although the same analysis appeared to suggest that overall cellular growth and proliferation was lower in mfp vs. par, it should be noted that several pro-adipogenic factors  were substantially enriched in mfp vs. par, some of those known to be associated with continued/sustained mitotic clonal expansion  of committed pre-adipocytes as well as terminal differentiation, maturation, and hypertrophy of adipocytes   <cit> . because this entire process also is regulated by hormones such as insulin, it is likely that nutritional intervention at this early age leading to altered insulin profiles over the long-term could alter the extent of adipogenesis. this point also is supported by the significant enrichment of response to insulin stimulus in the go analysis of deg more highly expressed in mfp vs. par .

the enrichment of morphological remodeling in deg more highly expressed in mfp over par was probably due to the increase in size of the cells by accumulation of triacylglycerol, as suggested both by the enrichment of functions related to synthesis and transport of lipid as well as synthesis of acyl-coa and carbohydrate utilization and also the mfp composition data reported by daniels et al. for the same heifers  <cit>  . in the present experiment, the weight of mfp of the selected heifers at slaughter averaged  <dig> g and represented ca. 95% of total mammary gland weight  <cit> , thus, indicating that a large proportion of the mammary tissue in these animals was fat pad. sinha and tucker  <cit>  reported a considerable enlargement of the mfp during the pre-weaning phase , and more recent work showed similar results  <cit> . more recently, meyer and colleagues  <cit>  reported that the increase in mfp weight was more related to enhanced hypertrophy than proliferation, as also evidenced by ratio g of tissue/mg dna from  <dig> to  <dig> kg body weight which was very similar for par but increased ca. 3-fold in mfp between  <dig> kg and  <dig> kg heifers. our results suggesting that mfp development was partly related to adipocyte hypertrophy and remodeling appear to be supported by previous findings.

more highly-expressed genes in mfp vs. par were preferentially associated with cellular movement  and cell-to-cell signaling , functions that are closely related to the immune system . in addition, top signaling pathways among deg more highly expressed in mfp vs. par were primarily related to response to stimuli, e.g., acute phase response, complement system, lps/il- <dig> mediated inhibition of rxr function, il- <dig> signaling, and oxidative stress response . these data suggest that a significant amount of the deg more highly expressed in mfp vs. par are immune-related genes or that the mfp vs. par compartment is more enriched with immune cells  as it has been observed previously in adipose tissue from rodents and humans  <cit> . our network analysis , and previous heifer mammary proteomics data  <cit> , provide evidence that these immune-related pathways in mfp vs. par might be biologically relevant in the context of mammary gland development.

we observed a more significant enrichment of igf- <dig> signaling among deg more highly expressed in mfp vs. par than vice versa . this pathway was previously related to estrogen and its receptor in  <dig> mo-old heifers, where increased igf <dig> expression was observed after estrogen treatment  <cit> . in heifers and rodents  <cit> , circulating estrogen seems to act through its receptor and induces mfp cells to secrete igf- <dig>  which will then act in a paracrine fashion on par cells. at least in mice, such a mitogenic effect is observed in spite of low plasma levels of igf- <dig>  <cit> . our findings, however, do not support an induction of igf- <dig> via stimulation of estrogen in mfp compared with par. instead, data suggest that par was probably more sensitive to estrogen due to the greater mrna abundance of esr <dig> which agrees with a previous study  <cit>  where mrna expression of esr <dig> was more predominant  in par than mfp. furthermore, no difference in igf <dig> expression was detected by the microarray analysis or qpcr  <cit>  between the two tissues.

pathway analysis underscored a more prominent role of igf- <dig> signaling in mfp than par, which suggests greater sensitivity of mfp to igf- <dig> signaling. this is supported by the detailed visualization of the pathway  which indicates that several key factors in the igf- <dig> signaling cascade had greater expression in mfp compared with par . because both igfbp <dig> and  <dig> were more abundant in mfp vs. par , it could be possible that igf <dig> activity was reduced  <cit> . a similar result was found for igfbp <dig> and  <dig> via qpcr in the study of daniels et al.  <cit> . as mentioned above, par is thought to be affected by local stimulators  derived from mfp but in our study it appeared that igf- <dig> was not a major player in this tissue as it was not among the significantly-enriched pathways . our findings leave open the possibility that other paracrine factors secreted by par cells, which can be released in response to circulating estrogen  <cit> , or by the mfp can play a more prominent role during this stage of development in bovine mammary gland.

transcriptional network analysis reveals a central role for several transcription regulators in par and mfp development
mammary parenchyma
gene network analysis among deg that were more highly-expressed in par vs. mfp  revealed that the transcription regulators myc  and tp <dig>  could play central roles. myc has been detected in prepubertal  <cit>  and lactating bovine mammary tissue  <cit> . expression of myc mrna is increased by igf- <dig>  <cit> , and a primary response of myc is to enhance epithelial cell proliferation. recent evidence showed that myc is essential in mediating wnt-signaling and subsequent cell proliferation and growth and it also appears to control protein expression through mrna translation  <cit> , all of which can be considered important in par development.

tp <dig> can induce cell apoptosis or cell cycle arrest in response to different types of stress, i.e., it is considered to be a central control point of cell transformation and tumorigenesis  <cit> . tp <dig> activation can induce a transient  or a permanent block of cell proliferation , or can induce the activation of cell death pathways in response to genotoxic stress  <cit> . a classical feature of tp <dig> activation in response to physiological stress  leading to dna damage is the activation of signaling cascades leading to dna repair, recombination, and the control of dna replication ultimately protecting cells from endogenous dna damage  <cit> . therefore, on one hand our functional analysis  does not support low cell cycle activity in par but, rather, a larger cell cycle activity compared with mfp. on the other hand the more highly expressed deg in par vs. mfp were enriched significantly in functions associated with dna replication, recombination, and repair . in addition to myc and tp <dig>  ctnnb <dig> also may have potentially controlled expression of several genes that were more highly expressed in par vs. mfp . the biological significance of ctnnb <dig> in the present experiment is not apparent, but this protein is known to have a pivotal role in alveologenesis during pubertal mammary development in mice  <cit> .

mammary fat pad
transcriptional gene networks generated among deg with ≥  <dig> -fold expression in mfp vs. par  encompassed a large number of metabolism-related genes, revealing a pattern that would be expected in a classical adipocyte network  <cit> , i.e., several stages of adipogenesis were revealed by some of the overexpressed genes. for example, expression  of nr1d <dig> and klf <dig> was suggestive of pre-adipocytes undergoing mitotic clonal expansion; whereas, expression of pparg and its putative targets fasn, acetyl-coenzyme a carboxylase alpha , mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase , elongation of very long chain fatty acids-like  <dig> , lpl, cd <dig> molecule  , fabp <dig>  acyl-coa synthetase long-chain family member  <dig> , and scd was indicative of lipid filling that is more characteristic of a mature adipocyte  <cit> . not surprisingly, network analysis showed that pparg is a central transcription factor among genes more highly expressed in mfp vs. par, and its expression at this stage of development could be essential for adipogenesis and lipid filling in mfp compared with par  <cit>  but also for the production of adipokines such as adipoq and lep both of which could exert control over tissue inflammation .

pparg interacts closely with rxrg, rxrb, and potentially with lipin  <dig>   <cit> . rxr transcription factors participate in the regulation of cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism by interacting with other transcription regulators such as pparg   <cit> . lpin <dig> is one of  <dig> isoforms that is associated with triacylglycerol synthesis in rodent adipose tissue  <cit>  and fatty acid oxidation in rodent liver  <cit> . all lipin isoforms were more expressed in mfp vs. par , with lpin <dig> being the only one having > <dig> -fold larger mrna abundance in mfp vs. par. several other genes in addition to those discussed are considered to play central roles in adipose tissue, including dgat <dig> . although not present in the network shown in figure  <dig>  dgat <dig> is considered to be a pparg-target gene in non-ruminants and is related to triglyceride synthesis  <cit> . thrsp  is a lipogenic transcription factor and it is synergistically regulated by thyroid hormone and insulin  <cit>  as well as long-term via the transcription regulator carbohydrate responsive element binding protein .

other central transcription factors uncovered by ipa analysis among genes more highly-expressed in mfp vs. par were fos, hnf4a, epas <dig>  klf <dig>  and egr <dig> . fos has been previously associated with eukaryotic cell proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . however, the overall transcriptomics functional analysis of deg more expressed in mfp vs. par indicated a lower degree of proliferation/differentiation in mfp vs. par . transcription of fos is induced with different potency by epidermal growth factor, pdgf, transforming growth factor beta , tumor necrosis factor, fgf, il- <dig>  camp, estrogen, and other growth factors that have diverse roles in the cell  <cit> . thus, in developing bovine mammary tissue this transcription regulator might be essential for mfp development and would provide a functional link with par-derived cytokines/growth factors such as il1b . a recent study in mouse mammary cells showed that tgfb regulates the expression of hnf4a, which in turn could control cell proliferation  <cit> . interestingly, mfp expressed greater mrna of tgfb <dig> compared with par , which might indicate that, at the moment of harvesting, the influence of par-derived tgfb was not relevant for mfp. klf <dig>  was among the tf which potentially could have controlled expression of several deg more expressed in mfp vs. par . the klf <dig> protein is an embryonic stem cell-related factor which appears to control pluripotency driven by myc  <cit> .

also noteworthy was the higher expression of epas <dig> in mfp vs. par. epas <dig> is preferentially expressed in vascular endothelial cells and plays a pivotal role in the formation of mature vascular tissue  <cit> . as indicated by functional analysis, angiogenesis was highly-enriched among deg with ≥  <dig> -fold greater expression in mfp vs. par ; however, the functional analysis did not indicate a greater degree of angiogenesis in mfp compared with par. the mfp is essential for ductal morphogenesis in developing mammary tissue, but also it is subject to marked angiogenesis upon stimulation by some factors released from par  <cit> . to our knowledge, egr <dig> has not been studied in the context of mammary gland development. our results suggest that this protein influenced the expression of several genes more highly-expressed in mfp vs. par . among those putative targets, egr <dig> could have control over the expression of growth hormone receptor  . the greater expression of ghr in mfp vs. par agrees with qpcr data from daniels and colleagues  <cit> .

bidirectional crosstalk between tissues inferred from network analysis
the potential effects of mfp-derived growth factors on the developing mammary par have been previously studied by several groups with different species  <cit> . similarly, an effect of paracrine factors from par on mfp has been suggested from studies of normal mammary epithelial cells  <cit>  and breast tumor epithelial cells  <cit> . these types of interactions could occur in prepubertal mammary tissue, for example, through growth factors and cytokines such as molecules from the egf and fgf families  <cit> , which if secreted by either tissue could then act in a paracrine fashion. thus, to uncover additional factors that could play a role in par and mfp development, we evaluated the presence of cytokines and growth factors that might be secreted preferentially by one tissue or the other. the criteria for this analysis was implemented using ipa and was based on the principle that the cytokines and growth factors more highly-expressed in one tissue and, very likely, secreted by it, could potentially affect those deg that are more highly-expressed in the other tissue  via effects at the level of mrna expression, functional activation, protein modification, protein-protein interaction, protein-rna interaction, protein phosphorylation, and protein translocation . the multitude of relationships, mostly from rodent and human studies, underscores the importance of these molecules on mammary development.

model of putative tissue interactions
gene network and pathway analysis using ipa allowed us to develop a putative model that would allow both mammary compartments to interact and elicit large-scale changes in the transcriptome and, potentially, tissue function via the synthesis of cytokines and growth factors, many of which have not been studied previously in the context of bovine mammary development. although our study deals with mrna expression only, it is assumed that higher expression of cytokines and growth factors in one tissue likely results in greater amount of protein synthesized and very likely more protein secreted. the effect of those signaling molecules can be both at the paracrine, autocrine, as well as endocrine levels. the molecules uncovered by our analysis as being preferentially expressed in par compared with mfp or vice versa could represent paracrine factors which allow for crosstalk between the two tissues and play important roles in proliferation and development of both epithelial and mfp cells . more importantly, these could be considered an important starting point for future detailed molecular studies of the interaction between par and mfp.

signaling molecules likely released in greater amounts by par compared with mfp, through more mrna abundance in mfp vs. par and vice versa, and potentially acting on mfp appear to affect, in both tissues, similar functions including cell movement, development, growth and proliferation, cell-mediated immune response, and cell-to-cell signaling and interactions. however, those signaling molecules likely released in greater amounts by par compared with mfp can potentially affect cell death in mfp cells; whereas, those released in greater amounts by mfp compared with par can potentially affect dna metabolism in par . the potential effects of cytokines and growth factors on cellular growth, development, proliferation, and cell signaling in mammary tissue have been reported for both tissues in a recent review of the literature  <cit> .

four signaling pathways could have been potentially stimulated reciprocally between the two tissues . among those were signaling pathways related to acute phase response, axonal guidance, glucocorticoid receptor, and igf- <dig> response. the biological significance of the first two is not apparent. also for the glucocorticod receptor signaling a biological significance is not apparent in our study, nonetheless this pathway has been previously associated with mammary development. in fact, glucocorticoid receptor signaling was associated with the normal development of the virgin mouse mammary gland through stimulation of ductal epithelial cell proliferation  <cit>  and with regulating lobuloalveolar development during pregnancy  <cit> .

the importance of igf- <dig> signaling in par and mfp development has been discussed above and in previous papers/reviews . interestingly, our data suggested that mfp likely affected igf- <dig> signaling in par not through higher synthesis of igf- <dig> but rather by modulating the down-stream signaling. more importantly, our data suggested an active role of par in affecting igf- <dig> signaling in mfp and based on the number of genes affected and the fact that igf <dig> signaling was more significantly enriched in deg with greater expression in mfp vs. par, the stimulation of this pathway appears to be as strong or stronger in mfp than par .

several canonical pathways were uniquely affected in one tissue by signaling molecules released in greater amounts from the other tissue . the cytokines and growth factors preferentially released from par compared with mfp seem to influence several nuclear receptors related to lipid metabolism , but also maintenance of pluripotency and immune-related pathways  in mfp. the signaling molecules preferentially released from mfp vs. par seem to influence par signaling pathways with distinctive roles during this stage of development, e.g., actin cytoskeletal signaling .

additional pathways not found to be highly-significant when all deg were analyzed  also seemed to be affected by signaling molecules likely released in greater amounts by mfp compared with par, including erk/mapk signaling, fgf signaling, and pdgf signaling . erk/mapk signaling is related to a broad range of intracellular functions  <cit>  and its role in developing mammary gland is not apparent. fgf signaling is related to the induction of potent mitogenic and angiogenic cellular processes and it is involved in embryonic  <cit>  and postnatal mammary development  <cit>  as well as with tumors of diverse origin, including mammary tumors  <cit> . pdgf signaling promotes mammary cancer progression and can induce apoptosis of human and murine mammary carcinoma cells when inhibited  <cit> , suggesting a fundamental role in normal mammary differentiation and development. in this regard, orr urtreger and lonai  <cit>  revealed a possible interaction during organogenesis between epithelial and mesenchymal tissue in mice, i.e., pdgfa was expressed in mammary epithelial tissue and its receptor in the surrounding mesenchymal tissue. we are not aware of research in the prepubertal mammary gland of heifer calves that studied these signaling pathways.

CONCLUSIONS
we uncovered specific transcriptomic signatures characterizing genes with large difference in expression between mfp and par tissues. not surprisingly, most of the genes that were more highly expressed in mfp vs. par were characteristic of adipose tissue, and those more expressed in par vs. mfp were characteristic of an epithelial tissue undergoing expansion and remodeling. overall, our analyses suggested a large degree of interaction between the two tissues and allowed envisaging a reciprocal influence between the two tissues during this stage of development. this was indicated by the potential effect that the signaling molecules preferentially expressed in par vs. mfp and, likely released, have on lipid metabolism-related functions/pathways, which from our data was what distinguished the most those genes more highly expressed in mfp compared with par. similarly, the cytokines and growth factors more highly expressed in mfp compared with par potentially affected the functions/pathways related to cell cycle, development, and proliferation in par, which our data highlighted as the main functions represented among the genes more highly-expressed in par vs. mfp.

recent efforts have largely focused on mfp as a source of paracrine factors but our study clearly showed that par cells could play the same role. based on the current analysis, the number of cytokines and growth factors that potentially are secreted in greater amounts by each tissue and affect molecules in the other underscores the concept of crosstalk already postulated by several investigators  <cit> . ultimately, these bidirectional interactions might be required to coordinate mammary tissue development under normal circumstances or in response to environmental stimuli, such as nutrition.

overall, the model generated based on the results from the present experiment predicts a large degree of crosstalk between mfp and par with a reciprocal regulation. the main factors at play appear to encompass several cytokines and growth factors preferentially released by par including spp <dig>  cxcl <dig>  pdgfa, dff <dig>  and nrg <dig> which are probably slowing down the proliferation of mfp and increasing its lipid accumulation. concomitantly, cytokines and growth factors released preferentially by mfp such as adipoq, fgf <dig>  grp, and nov are probably inducing major re-organization and proliferation of the par.
