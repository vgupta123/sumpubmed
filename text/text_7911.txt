BACKGROUND
microarray technology has become one of the most important approaches to globally reveal gene expression changes to identify genes associated with biological processes of interests. at present, several different microarray platforms are commercially available. the different platforms often have diverse types and various numbers of gene probes. even for the probes corresponding to the same genes, there are usually various levels of binding affinity and specificity in different platforms. therefore, questions are raised on whether the different microarray platforms can generate similar gene expression results  <cit> . to answer the questions, the microarray quality control  project compared gene expression data generated from different microarray platforms for a set of common samples and found certain consistencies among the different platforms for the differentially expressed genes   <cit> .

microarray methods are commonly used for examining thousands of genes simultaneously to reveal biological functional differences between examined samples. therefore, biological functions should be considered as the ultimate endpoints for comparison of consistency across different microarray platforms. if different microarray platforms result in different degs but the same biological functions, we should acknowledge that these platforms are indeed comparable and reproducible because they tell us the same results. although degs can be diverse when the experiments are performed at various times, in different laboratories or using dissimilar platforms, if most of the degs are true discoveries and enough of them are filled into distinct biological functional pathways, the altered biological functions can be identified. therefore, it is logically hypothesized that high cross-platform concordance can be reached at biological function level.

in this study, we used the maqc project data generated from kidney samples of rats treated with aristolochic acid   <cit> . aa is an active component of herbal drugs, but it is a nephrotoxin and carcinogen. a high prevalence of urothelial carcinoma was found in patients that developed nephropathy due to aa exposure  <cit> . animal models also demonstrated that aa treatment resulted in renal failure in rodents  <cit> , and tumors in the kidney, forestomach, and other tissues of rats and mice  <cit> . aa was identified among the most potent 2% of the carcinogens  <cit> . the international agency for research on cancer  has classified products containing aa as human carcinogens  <cit> . our previous studies have demonstrated that aa exposure produced dna adducts and mutations in rat kidney  <cit>  and induced carcinogenesis revealed by gene expression analysis of the same kidney samples  <cit> . if different microarray platforms are comparable for biologically functional analysis, we would expect these toxicological processes or functions to appear on the top functions altered in the aa treatment in each testing platform.

RESULTS
significant gene lists and common degs in different platforms
unlike the maqc study  <cit>  in which the common genes across all platforms were used as a starting point for platform comparison, we used all genes in each platform microarray to independently select degs. genes with q <  <dig>  were considered as significantly changed. aa treatment of rats resulted in a number of degs in rat kidney, a carcinogenic target tissue of the carcinogen. the  <dig> degs from affymetrix test site  <dig> ,  <dig> in affymetrix test site  <dig> ,  <dig> in applied biosystems site ,  <dig> in agilent , and  <dig> in ge health  were selected from  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> unique genes in each platform, respectively . figure  <dig> is a heat map to compare the common degs from the different test sites. there are  <dig> degs common to all the five test sites,  <dig> degs common to four sites,  <dig> degs common to three sites,  <dig> degs common to two sites and  <dig> present in only one site. the percentage of common degs in any two platforms is shown in table  <dig>  the percentages of common degs are low, ranging from 9% to 34%, except for the percentage between afx_ <dig> and afx_ <dig>  the low percentages of common degs among the different platforms mainly resulted from the different gene probes in different platforms. there are only  <dig> genes common to all the  <dig> platforms.

intra-platform comparison of biological processes
to compare the consistency of intra-platform microarray studies, two sets of data generated from two test sites for affymetrix  were used. the two deg lists were imported to ingenuity pathway analysis system  to identify the functions that were altered by aa treatment. the altered function processes are listed in additional file  <dig>  the two sets of function processes corresponding to the two deg lists were compared and the percentages of common functions at a given number of functions are displayed in figure  <dig>  these two function lists exhibit high levels of overlap, whereas the control function lists from randomly chosen genes show much lower percentages of overlapping functions. the percentage of overlapping functions for the first  <dig> ranks are over 80%, and remains stable at about 70%. the control function lists, however, show very low concordance. there are no common functions between the control function lists for the top  <dig> functions, and the percentage of overlapping functions increases slightly when more functions are considered. table  <dig> is a snapshot of the overlapping at the top  <dig> functions from figures  <dig> and  <dig>  the percentage of common functions between afx_ <dig> and afx_ <dig> is the highest  among the comparisons, indicating that the intra-platform reproducibility for gene expression is better than inter-platform reproducibility in terms of biological functions.

note: the numbers inside brackets represent the overlapping percentages of the top  <dig> functions from the control function lists.

inter-platform comparison of biological processes
functional processes from the four platforms, abi, ag <dig>  geh and afx  were analyzed and compared. the percentages of overlapping aa-altered functions between any pair of two platforms vs. certain number of top functions are graphed and displayed in figure  <dig>  the patterns for the changes of common function ratio with number of top function are very similar in the six comparisons between the different platform microarrays. the highest concordance between platforms appear around top  <dig> functions, indicating that the major functional changes induced by aa treatment in rat kidney were commonly discovered by microarray analysis of gene expression from different platforms. the percentages of common functions at around top  <dig> of functions reach to the lowest and then slowly increase with function numbers in all of the comparisons. the percentages of common functions between the different platforms are from  <dig> to 70% while those between the control function lists are very low, from  <dig> to 10% .

a comparison across all of the  <dig> platforms also shows high concordance for the top  <dig> functions , considering that only 4% degs  are common in the gene lists from the different platforms . in contrast, the percentage of common functions among the  <dig> platforms in the randomly selected controls is close to  <dig> when up to  <dig> of top functions are selected .

major biological processes changed by aa exposure in rat kidney
to examine whether each platform/site could reveal similar ongoing biological processes in rat kidneys exposed to aa, we compared the top  <dig> functions identified by ipa from the different platforms . since the major functions changed by a treatment normally appear to be the most significant, the top functions should reflect aa's carcinogenic characters in rat kidney. as expected, the major functions from all  <dig> platform/sites were carcinogenesis-related, such as cancer, tumor, neoplasm and tumorigenesis. other functions like inflammatory disorder might reveal other toxicities of aa in rat kidney. when the top  <dig> functions were examined, carcinogenesis-related functions still remained as the main subject across all of the platforms . in contrast, the top  <dig> functions derived from the control gene lists were diverse and inconsistent across the platforms/sites, and primarily were not cancer-related .

discussion
the main purpose of gene expression studies using microarrays is to reveal the underlying biological differences between the two groups of samples. for example, examination of the lists of degs between controls and chemical-treated samples could reveal whether the chemical is toxic or not. deg lists may change depending on the experiment, laboratory and platforms due to experimental variability, sample size, dissimilar probes in microarrays, different binding sites of probes for genes, and diverse methods for data normalization and selection. therefore, deg lists generated from identical rna preparations could be considerably divergent if the microarray experiments are performed in different sites or with dissimilar microarray platforms  <cit> . the different deg lists from various sites/platforms, however, still can be considered comparable if they reveal the same biological truth between the two groups of samples. it should also be pointed out that the higher percentage of overlapping functions compared to overlapping genes may be attributed to the fact that each function contains many genes.

in our analysis, the deg lists identified from the platforms are very different because we did not use the common set of genes in the platforms for their selection. only about 4% degs are common in all of the lists  and 9â€“34% degs are common between any two of the platforms . in contrast, ipa analysis of these different lists resulted in high concordances of biological functions within one platform, between any two platforms and among all the platforms, especially for the top functions. the reproducibility of aa-altered functions for intra-platform is very high. this result is not unexpected because the microarrays tested in the different sites have the same gene probes and chemistries and the deg lists from the two test sites are also similar. although the percentages of common functions among the different platforms are a little bit lower than that for intra-platform, the concordances are still pretty high.

it is not unexpected to find the high concordance among the different platforms in terms of biological functions. although false positive genes generally exist in a deg list, most genes identified by microarrays are true degs when a high threshold method is used for the selection. when a biological process or function is changed, it normally results from the common effects of many genes. therefore, even when dissimilar degs are present in platform analyses, they may be still involved in the same functions. tan et al. compared the results from three commercial platforms and found that only  <dig> of the  <dig> unique genes were universal whereas the common top function, cell cycle, was identified by analysis of the top  <dig> genes from the different platforms  <cit> . this function reflects the differences in their samples, panc- <dig> cells grown in serum-rich and serum-free media.

in this study, the rats were treated with aa using a similar protocol shown to result in the development of tumors in the rat kidney  <cit> . six-week-old rats were treated with  <dig> mg aa/kg body weight five times a week for  <dig> weeks. the animals were sacrificed one day after the last treatment so that the gene expression could reflect the carcinogenicity and toxicity induced by aa in rat kidney. although adenomas and adenocarcinomas in the renal cortex and papillomas in the renal pelvis were observed three months after the aa treatment in the carcinogenic study, atypical cells with gigantic nuclei and enlarged basophilic nucleoli in the tubular epiththelium of the renal cortex and multifocal dedifferentiation of the renal tubular epithelium and hyperplasia of the transitional epithelium in the renal pelvis were found immediately after the  <dig> month's treatment with  <dig> mg/kg aa. therefore, the true biological differences between aa-treated and control samples are known. if a microarray analysis of these samples is reliable, it should reflect the pathogenesis exerted by aa treatment. the biological functions identified by the different sites or platforms reflect the biological effects of aa treatment . the carcinogenesis-related functions appear in the top list in every laboratory site or platforms. this concordance suggests that data generated on different microarray platforms are comparable in terms of biological responses.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we analyzed and compared microarray data generated by the maqc project on aa-treated and control rat kidney samples from a biological function viewpoint. our data demonstrated that there are high concordances of biological functions in intra- and inter-platform comparisons. also, importantly, data from all the platforms or sites revealed the ongoing biological processes, carcinogenesis, in the kidneys of rats exposed to aa, a known carcinogen. these results suggest that highly consistent biological functions can be revealed when data from different microarray platforms are analyzed separately without restricting the analysis on a common set of genes found on all the platforms.
