BACKGROUND
c. sativus is an economically important monocotyledonous crop producing saffron, the world’s highest priced spice  <cit> . in addition, the stigmas are used all over the world to treat different diseases  <cit> . over the past 5000 years, farmers have selected c. sativus for its stigmas characterized by the accumulation of apocarotenoids  <cit> . c. sativus is a triploid perennial sterile plant, adapted to overcome a dry dormant period in the form of an underground corm. corms remain dormant from the beginning of the dry season , when the leaves senesce and wither, to the beginning of summer , characterized by the formation of leaf primordia  <cit> . shortly afterwards, flower morphogenesis takes place and all the flower is already differentiated by the end of august  <cit> . with the onset of sprouting at the end of october, the corm turns into a source organ supporting growth of the developing corm. the importance of adequate corm production is self-evident in the sterile taxon saffron, which has been reproduced vegetatively for millennia by annually replacing corms. since almost every sprouting bud produces a corm, factors affecting sprouting are highly important for corm and flower production. only one to three corms per mother corm are produced in one growing season through conventional methods  <cit> . it would take 9– <dig> years to produce corms required to sow one hectare from an initial corm  <cit> . hence, low multiplication rates and fungal infestation of corms reduce the productivity and quality, thereby restraining the availability of planting material. a corm survives for only one season, reproducing via division into cormlets that eventually give rise to new plants, and therefore corms are indispensable for saffron propagation.

despite its importance, the sprouting process in saffron has not been characterized precisely. as in other plants, it is thought that this process should be orchestrated by a complex interplay of phytohormone and sugar signals  <cit> . abscisic acid  has been associated with the onset and maintenance of corm dormancy  <cit> . gibberellins  seem to be involved in apical sprout growth after dormancy cessation, but not in dormancy maintenance  <cit> . so far, there is no data regarding the involvement of other hormones neither in the sprouting process nor on apical dominance in saffron. in addition, it is not known whether the corm behaves as the stem of other higher plants and follows the same behaviour regarding apical dominance. in higher plants not all of the axillary buds develop, and each bud is subjected to a decision to continue growth or to become dormant  <cit> . plant hormones are major players in the control of axillary bud outgrowth. it has been known for a long time that two hormones in particular, auxin and cytokinin, are involved in this control. auxin, which is supplied from the apical bud, indirectly suppresses axillary bud outgrowth, while cytokinins directly induce branching  <cit> . during the past two decades, genetic and physiological analyses in pea, arabidopsis rice, and petunia have predicted the involvement of an additional, novel hormone in the control of shoot branching: the sls that act as second messengers to inhibit axillary bud outgrowth  <cit> . the interactions between auxin and sls in regulation of lateral branching are complex. sls may act by dampening auxin transport  <cit> , act downstream of auxin  <cit> , or be independent from the status of stem auxin  <cit>  to regulate lateral branching.

sls are long known for their role as germination stimulants for root parasitic plants  <cit>  and pre-symbiotic branching factors for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi  <cit> . in flowering plants, sls have also been implicated in development  <cit>  as new hormonal players in the suppression of the outgrowth of preformed axillary buds  <cit> , in root system architecture, adventitious rooting, secondary growth and reproductive development  <cit> . they have been also associated with plant responses to both abiotic and biotic stresses  <cit> . however, it is on their effects on shoot branching that some of the biosynthesis and responsive genes in the sl pathway were first identified  <cit> .

several lines of evidence demonstrate that sls are derived from apocarotenoids, and a putative biosynthetic pathway has been proposed  <cit> . two carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases, ccd <dig> and ccd <dig>  are involved in sl biosynthesis. ccd <dig> catalyses the  <dig>  cleavage of 9-cis-β-carotene to produce 10′-apo-β-carotenal and β-ionone. then, the 10′-apo-β-carotenal is cleaved by ccd <dig> to produce c18-ketone β-apo-13-carotenone. this compound is immediately converted by ccd <dig> to carlactone, through a series of different reactions  <cit> . carlactone presumably serves as substrate for max <dig> enzymes which catalyze the production of the different forms of sls found in nature  <cit> .

orthologues of ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> have been characterized in plants such as arabidopsis, pea, petunia, rice, chrysanthemum, kiwi, and tomato  <cit> . in addition, a ccd <dig> orthologue has been isolated from the moss physcomitrella patens <cit> .the saffron corm is a stem-derived organ formed by shortened nodes and internodes. mature saffron corms usually show one to three apical dominant buds which will sprout in the following season plus many axillary dormant buds . each axillary bud has the same developmental potential as the primary shoot apical meristem in that it can produce a growing shoot axis. however, axillary buds enter a dormant state after forming only a few leaves. the large number of axillary buds in the corm system allows the plant to recover quickly from damage and to adjust its growth according to environmental inputs. apical dominance acts as a plant survival mechanism by providing a reservoir of meristems that can replace the damaged primary shoot. this mechanism works when the primary shoot is damaged or removed through disease, herbivore grazing, or pruning. in some plants, apical dominance can also be released depending on developmental programs. dormant axillary buds start their outgrowth after the primary bud differentiates into the determinate organ, such as a flower. these additional shoots are important for increasing the total number of leaves or flowers to be more fruitful. however, this is not the case of saffron, where no activation of additional axillary buds is induced.

in view of the importance of sprouting in saffron and the potential impact of apical dominance on the number of corms produced, it was considered timely to investigate the role of sls in this process, including the control of axillary branching, which can be extended to other plants propagated by corms. in this study we have identified two saffron genes required for sl biosynthesis as well as the involvement of key growth regulators in this process.

RESULTS
characterization of axillary bud sprouting in saffron
axillary buds are usually dormant, and are inhibited by auxin produced by the apical meristem. we checked whether the saffron corm exhibited classical stem-like behaviour and also investigated the role of bud apical dominance in determining lateral bud dormancy release and sprouting. decapitation of the apical bud of the corm induced a loss of apical dominance and after 15 days, all axillary buds were sprouted . we determined the number of axillary buds sprouted in each node and the number of axillary buds that remained quiescent 35 days after decapitation of the main bud . the first node was set as the one that was occupied by the basal plate. the total number of axillary buds per node was increased from the bottom to the apical meristem, reaching the maximum at node  <dig> . in the first and second nodes the percentage of sprouted buds was  <dig>  and 38%, respectively. the roots were formed in the third node in 98% of the analysed corms, and in this node the percentage of sprouted axillary buds was  <dig> %. from this node onward, the pattern of sprouting changes, with an increasing number of sprouted buds in comparison with the buds that remain quiescent in each node, from 62% in the fourth node up to  <dig> % in the eighth node . practically all these sprouted axillary buds will form a new replacement corm, resulting in an increase in the number of corms . to characterize this process in depth, the corms were subjected to the following treatments:  decapitation of the apical bud;  full removal of the apical complex;  full removal of secondary quiescent buds;  full removal of the basal complex with or without apical bud removal; and  full removal of the adventitious roots with or without apical bud removal. the sprouting was followed for 30 days. decapitation of the apical bud induced accelerated loss of apical dominance, affecting axillary bud growth. after 15 days, all axillary buds were sprouting . the same pattern was observed when the apical complex  was removed. as expected, when auxin was applied to the decapitated apex, axillary bud sprouting was suppressed . interestingly, the removal of the basal plate inhibited the growth of the apical and axillary buds. the same results were obtained when the adventitious roots were removed . however, in this case, when corms were transferred to a humid surface allowing the regeneration of the roots, the growth of the apical bud was restarted and secondary buds sprouted in the corms when the apical bud was removed. these experiments emphasize the importance of apical bud presence and viability in the control of axillary bud growth but also the involvement of the roots on bud sprouting. roots have been considered to be the source of cytokinins, and cytokinins induced the fast growth of axillaries buds in decapitated corms .

several works have pointed out that after decapitation, the axillary bud needed to form a vascular connection before it could grow. we investigated whether a vascular connection is already present in the axillary buds of saffron. axillary buds in saffron are covered by a few leaves, thus these axillary buds might initiate a few leaves and then become developmentally arrested or dormant because the terminal bud inhibits their growth. these dormant axillary buds need to develop a vascular connection previously to be able to grow, and this process is relatively slow  in comparison with other systems studied  <cit> . quiescent axillary buds in saffron have not developed the vascular connections with mother corm , but once the sprouting of these axillary buds is induced, the development of that vasculature begins .

hormones in saffron buds
apical dominance was one of the first developmental phenomenon shown to be regulated by plant hormones. auxin, derived from the apical bud, moves basipetally in the stem through the polar auxin transport stream and inhibits the growth of axillary buds, whereas cytokinin derived mainly from the roots, promotes the outgrowth  <cit> . in order to characterize the hormonal regulation of axillary bud sprouting in saffron corms, the level of auxin and several other hormones were measured in the different parts of the corm . high levels of auxins were detected in the apical buds, while auxins were not detected in the other tissues tested, including axillary buds . interestingly, a significant increase in auxin content was detected in axillary buds after removal of the apical meristem , suggesting a reorganization of the dominance after decapitation. by contrast, the highest level of jasmonic acid  was detected in the quiescent axillary buds, decreasing ten days after decapitation of the apical bud . the highest level of salycilic acid  was detected in apical and axillary buds followed by the basal plate .

sls in saffron corms
to assess the presence of sls in saffron, several parts were dissected and tested for the induction of germination of phelipanche ramosa seeds . apical buds, axillary latent buds and sprouted axillary buds, external cover , roots, basal plate, and vascular tissue from apical buds, decapitated buds and axillary bud extracts were applied to p. ramosa seeds, and germination was scored after  <dig> d. the extracts of the main vascular tissue from the apical buds induced  <dig> % germination, whereas germination was not induced using extracts from the other tissues. the synthetic sl gr <dig>  was used as a positive control and induced 58% and 34% germination, respectively, whereas water  induced no germination .

identification of the first saffron ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> genes
sls are a new class of plant hormones that have been shown to be involved in the regulation of the outgrowth of preformed axillary buds. in order to study the relationship between apical dominance and sls in saffron, the ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> genes were isolated using a combination of degenerate primer pcr and gene walking. saffron ccd <dig>  hereafter designated as csccd <dig>  contains five introns , and the 1912 bp of the coding sequence encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids with a predicted pi of  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda . the chlorop  <dig>  program predicted a 50-amino acid, n-terminal transit peptide, consistent with plastid localization of ccd <dig>  <cit> . csccd <dig> showed the highest homology with solanum lycopersicum ccd <dig> protein . in the case of the ccd <dig>  two .1pt?>different genes were isolated from saffron, designated as csccd8a and csccd8b, which differ in the sequence of the first exon and intron. csccd8a was predicted to have six exons ,  <dig> nucleotides and a coding sequence of  <dig> nucleotides encoding a protein of  <dig> amino acids with a predicted pi of  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda . csccd8b was predicted to also have six exons,  <dig> nucleotides and a coding sequence of  <dig> nucleotides encoding a protein of  <dig> amino acids with a predicted pi of  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda . both csccd <dig> proteins showed 83% identity with dad <dig>  and 76% to d <dig> , and were predicted to be localized in plastids using the chlorop  <dig>  program, consistent with plastid localization of ccd <dig>  <cit> .

as part of the characterization of csccd <dig>  csccd8a and csccd8b, amino acid sequence alignments were carried out, in order to build a phylogenetic tree using the ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> protein sequences from a variety of plant species . this analysis showed that csccd <dig> was closer to the eudicot sequences than to the grass sequences  while csccd8a and csccd8b were in a cluster separate from the eudicots .

gene expression of csccd7and csccd8
to determine where csccd <dig> and csccd <dig> were expressed, the pattern of csccd <dig> and csccd <dig> transcript abundance was determined in different tissues using quantitative real-time rt-pcr . csccd <dig> expression was readily detected in all the analyzed tissues, but showing different expression levels. at the level of buds, the highest expression was detected in the axillary buds 24 h after removal of the apical bud, followed by the levels of expression in the apical bud . the levels in the vascular tissue from the apical buds or from the sprouted axillary buds were similar . interestingly, high expression levels were observed in the orange stigma in contrast with the low levels detected in the senescent stigma. the expression levels were also low in leaves and adventitious roots . the combined levels of both csccd <dig> transcripts in mrna extracted from different tissues were examined using primers that do not discriminate between the two different copies/alleles. the highest levels were detected in the quiescent axillary buds . however, these levels were drastically reduced in the axillary buds 24 h after removal of the apical bud. the expression levels in the apical bud were much reduced in comparison with the expression levels in the quiescent axillary buds, suggesting that the levels of csccd <dig> are reduced during the sprouting process . the expression of csccd <dig> in the vascular tissue from the apical buds was lower than that in the newly developed vascular tissue of the sprouted axillary buds, but higher than that observed in adventitious roots . similarly to csccd <dig>  a relatively high expression of csccd <dig> was detected in orange stigma, while this expression was reduced in senescent stigma .

discussion
almost all bulbous plant species are monocots, including economically important plants such as saffron, tulip, onion, garlic and lily. their vegetative propagation constitutes the most relevant process for agronomical improvements to markedly increase the potential number of bulblets, while the control of dormancy is crucial to solve many problems associated with the storage and distribution of these crops. sls play a key role in both processes, development of new buds and sprouting inhibition by inhibition of bud outgrowth  <cit>  and several genes involved in the biosynthesis and signalling of sls have been identified from a diverse range of species  <cit> , although excluding bulbous plants. in this paper, we describe and analyse the sprouting process in saffron induced by decapitation, as well as the involvement of sls in this process through the isolation and characterization of two key genes in sl biosynthesis, csccd <dig> and csccd <dig> 

isolation of the saffron ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> genes
the genes so far identified that control branching are frequently conserved between species. in particular, two carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase genes, ccd <dig>  and ccd <dig> , involved in sls biosynthesis, appear to be well conserved among the plant species studied. to characterize the sl pathway in saffron, the saffron orthologues of ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> were isolated, and their orthology was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. analyses of the genomes of several plants species showed that ccd <dig> is a single copy gene, which also seems to be the case in saffron, analysed in this study. however, in most of the analysed genomes ccd <dig> is present as a multicopy gene  <cit>  . in saffron, our results suggest that there are at least two loci encoding ccd <dig> 

despite the high functional conservation of the ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> genes between species, there are interesting differences in the expression patterns. csccd <dig> and csccd <dig> were expressed in all tissues and organs examined, with very low expression levels in adventitious roots. in arabidopsis <cit> , petunia  <cit> , pea  <cit> , kiwi  <cit>  and tomato  <cit> , root expression of ccd <dig> is at least  <dig> times higher than that in the shoot. by contrast, in rice  <cit>  and chrysanthemum, shoot expression exceeds root expression  <cit> , whereas in rose no expression is detected in roots  <cit> . in arabidopsis, ccd <dig> expression was high in roots,  <cit>  although recently, the highest expression has been detected in seeds and in the stem vascular tissue  <cit> . in rice ccd <dig> is expressed in both shoot and root tissues being mainly expressed in vascular bundle tissues throughout the plant  <cit> . in petunia, its expression is higher in nodes and internodes  <cit>  and in tomato, ccd <dig> expression in green tissue is far less than that detected in the stem and in the roots  <cit> . these differences may reflect different contributions of the root and shoot in the sl-regulation of shoot branching in different species.

apical dominance in saffron in relation with the hormone content and the positional effect of axillary bud sprouting
apical dominance is thought to result from the developmental arrest of lateral buds caused by auxin, which is basipetally transported from the shoot apical meristem  <cit> . this notion is supported by the fact that apical dominance is maintained if an excised apex is replaced by an exogenous source of auxin. auxin derived from the shoot apex might control lateral bud outgrowth by the action of sls, relaying the inhibitory signal from the main stem into the buds  <cit> . this process has not previously been studied in depth in saffron. as observed in other plant systems, apical dominance in saffron was released by excision of the apical bud, which was the main source of auxin among the tested organs and tissues, and conversely, apical dominance was maintained by the application of auxin to the cut surface of the decapitated corm.

in addition, the importance of roots has been shown, possibly as a source of cytokinin for sprouting of apical and secondary buds, in the latter, when apical dominance has been lost .

the buds more closely located to the apical bud were more active, in terms of sprouting, than those distant from the apical bud, suggesting that the outgrowth potential of each axillary bud is related to its position in the corm. the decision of which buds activate first depends on the local bud competitiveness, which is probably determined by the local environment and developmental state of the bud  <cit> . on the other hand, a perception of altered light quality, in particular a decreased ratio of red light to far-red light  perceived by the phytochrome b has a key role in this process, inducing an inhibition of bud outgrowth  <cit> . however, on our experimental system, considering the corms as an underground organ it is not clear whether the buds nearer the apex are exposed to some sunlight. however, this positional effect has been observed in other plants such as pea, where only one bud per axil is released at the upper nodes when branching is promoted by decapitation  <cit> , and appears to be determined by a balance between several hormones  <cit> .

we also measured the levels of ja in several tissues of saffron. ja and its derivatives have been implicated in stress-induced responses and have also been shown to inhibit plant growth and mitosis  <cit> . the highest levels of ja were detected in quiescent axillary buds, but such levels were reduced after the decapitation of the apical bud and were undetectable in apical buds. these data suggest that ja could play a prominent role in bud dormancy in saffron. similarly, ja has recently been shown to be involved in bud dormancy in apricot  <cit>  and orchids  <cit> . the observed pattern of ja was opposite to the one observed for auxin. cell elongation and meristem activity required for plant growth are regulated by auxins. interestingly, ja shows extensive crosstalk with auxin and down-regulates pin <dig> and pin <dig> protein levels  <cit> , suggesting a possible role of this hormone in pin protein trafficking and auxin transport, as suggested for sls  <cit> . in agreement with this observation, it was shown that a gain in function mutation in iaa <dig> induced more lateral branches and decreased shoot apical dominance by reducing ja levels  <cit> .

endogenous cytokinins  can enter axillary buds and promote their outgrowth by promoting the cell cycle. cks are synthesized throughout the plant, but the origin of cks in bud regulation is still under debate  <cit> . it has been shown that cks produced in the roots are transported through the xylem  <cit>  and exert their action on different tissues. removal of roots in saffron interrupts bud outgrowth and the development of new roots restart the sprouting process. due to the involvement of cks in outgrowth bud promotion , it is likely that cks produced in the roots are responsible for this process in saffron as shown in other plant systems  <cit> .

sa levels have been shown to change between dormant and waking saffron corms  <cit> , suggesting its ability to break dormancy. therefore, we determined the levels of sa in apical buds, axillary buds and in axillary buds  <dig> d after removal of the apical bud. however, we did not detect significant differences among the samples, suggesting that endogenous level of sa in buds is not involved in the control of paradormancy.

sls in saffron corms and the roles of csccd <dig> and csccd7in sprouting and vascular tissue formation
another major player in the control of shoot branching are the sls  <cit> , originally identified as germination stimulants for root parasitic plants  <cit> . sls, together with auxin, have been shown to have an inhibitory role on shoot branching  <cit> . the auxin transport auto-inhibition hypothesis  <cit>  proposed that organs remain dormant because they are not able to export their own auxin into the stem polar auxin flow. once axillary bud dormancy is broken, bud outgrowth may depend on the establishment of auxin transport from the bud via a process involving canalization, which is controlled by the strength of the polar auxin transport stream and or may require an auxin-regulated second messenger  <cit> . the sls were proposed to act as regulators of auxin transport by reducing the expression and/or plasma membrane localization of auxin transporters  <cit> .

in the present work, the germination stimulatory activity of p. ramosa seeds of different extracts was tested, and the stimulatory activity, albeit low, was only detected in the fractions from vascular tissue developed from the apical bud indicating the presence of sls in this tissue. the absence of activity in the extracts from other tissues is most probably due to the presence of sls at extremely low levels. grafting studies performed in several species showed that a wild-type rootstock grafted to either a ccd <dig> or ccd <dig> mutant scion was able to restore wild-type branching patterns, indicating that sl was produced in the roots  <cit> . however, wild-type shoots on mutant roostocks also have near-wild-type branching patterns  <cit> . in addition, wild-type epicotyl interstock grafts into rms <dig> and hypocotyl grafts into arabidopsis max <dig> are also able to reduce branching  <cit> , indicating that biosynthesis of sls is not limited to the root system. further, the expression of csccd <dig> and csccd <dig> in the vascular tissues connecting sprouting buds with the mother corm, suggested that sls are also synthesized in the stem vascular system in saffron. in addition, the sl profile found in tomato root exudates is different from that found in xylem sap  <cit> , suggesting that different sls could be produced in different tissues in which they have different biological functionalities.

the expression patterns of csccd <dig> and csccd <dig> were analysed in apical and in axillary buds at two different developmental stages, quiescent and 24 h after elimination of the main apical bud. for both genes expression in apical buds was higher than in roots or leaves. however, in axillary buds the expression patterns of both genes were clearly different. although csccd <dig> showed the highest levels of expression in the quiescent axillary buds, the expression levels of csccd <dig> were very low in this tissue. in arabidopsis, expression of ccd <dig> has also been reported to be relatively high in nodal tissue close to the buds, while in rice, ccd <dig> was mainly found at the node of the stem where the axillary meristem initiates  <cit> . in fact, the csccd <dig> transcript levels in the axillary buds were rapidly down regulated by decapitation of the apical bud, although the expression of csccd <dig> was up regulated, as has been observed in potato  <cit> . previous data on ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> expression patterns in other plant systems revealed that decapitation results in decreased expression of these genes in the stem and in the axillary bud  <cit> . even though this was the case for csccd <dig>  csccd <dig> showed the opposite behaviour. this result suggests that sl production related to bud dormancy is most probably controlled at csccd <dig> level.

moreover, bud auxin export is also a prerequisite for the formation of vascular connections to the stem vasculature in inhibited buds  <cit> . in the quiescent axillary buds of saffron the vasculature is not well developed, and the sprouting process is accompanied by the development of this system. the leaf primordia of these quiescent axillary buds are not a source of auxins. however, once the bud start to grow, buds synthesize auxin, as observed in other plants  <cit> , and its export may enhance vascular connections and nutrient flow to further stimulate the growing bud. interestingly, it is in the vasculature of the axillary buds where the csccd <dig> expression levels were enhanced, compared with the vasculature of apical buds, although csccd <dig> levels remained practically unchanged, but high. recently  <cit> , it has been provide evidence that sls positively regulate cambial activity. the expression pattern of the studied genes suggests that most probably sl or carlactone production in this vascular tissue is controlled at the level of csccd <dig> but not csccd <dig>  in agreement with this, several reports point out to the involvement of ccd <dig> in the formation of other apocarotenoids  <cit> . both ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> are currently candidates to deliver c <dig> intermediates for ccd <dig>  which has been suggested to act preferentially over apocarotenoids  <cit> . consistent with this additional role for ccd <dig>  strongly elevated levels of ccd <dig> can be found in green tomato fruits, from which sls have not been detected  <cit>  and in panicles of rice  <cit> . interestingly, expression of d <dig>  a β-carotene isomerase that converts all-trans-β-carotene into 9-cis-β-carotene, which is cleaved by ccd <dig>  is also high in panicle, but low in roots  <cit> .

involvement of csccd <dig> and csccd <dig> in stigma development
unexpectedly, csccd <dig> and csccd <dig> transcripts were detected at relatively high levels in the stigma tissue. the abundance of both transcripts in immature orange stigmas exceeded that seen in vascular tissues, leaves and roots. csccd <dig> and csccd <dig> expression in the developing stigma suggests potentially interesting novel function for these enzymes and of sls. the female organs of c. sativus consist of a trilocular ovary, a very long style, and  <dig> red stylar branches forming the stigmas folded to give a trumpet-like structure  <cit> . this structure is already present in the earlier developmental stages of the stigma, which is approximately 2 mm in length  <cit> , and the cells continuously elongate until the stigma is fully developed reaching a final length of 30 mm  <cit> . auxins participated in the elongation of the floral tube in crocus <cit>  and they are probably involved in the style elongation. concomitant with cell elongation, the development of the vasculature of the stigma takes place, and sls could be actively participating in this process, explaining the expression of csccd <dig> and csccd <dig> during the development of the stigma. once the stigma is developed, the expression of both genes and probably the production of sls drops in the senescent stigma. a putative function for sls in flower development was already expected as the petunia ccd8/dad <dig> mutant was reported to have smaller flowers  <cit>  while in slccd <dig> knock-down lines sepals, petals and anthers were smaller than in wild-type plants  <cit> , suggesting that sl deficiency affects flower development.

CONCLUSIONS
the molecular and hormonal regulations on bud sprouting in bulbous plant species are largely unknown, but are fundamental for their propagation. we have determined that the corm behaves as the stem of other higher plants and follows the same behaviour regarding apical dominance. in this study, jasmonic acid, auxin and sls are associated with the negative regulation of axillary bud outgrowth in saffron, while cytokinins positively regulates bud outgrowth after decapitation. two key genes in sls biosynthesis, ccd <dig> and ccd <dig>  were cloned from saffron. csccd <dig> may play an important role in the control of apical dominance but also in the control of vascular and stigma development. as the perception and signalling mechanisms for sls pathway are becoming understood in other plant species, more work needs to be done to understand the mechanism of regulation of the sprouting process in saffron.
