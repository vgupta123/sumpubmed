BACKGROUND
dysferlinopathies are muscular dystrophies caused by mutations in dysferlin, a 230 kda membrane protein, mainly localized in the sarcolemma  <cit>  and the t-tubule system  <cit> . it is accepted that dysferlin participates in membrane resealing after damage  <cit> . this protein is weakly expressed in myoblasts , but highly expressed in adult skeletal muscle  <cit> . clinically, dysferlinopathies manifest between the second and third decade of life in previously asymptomatic patients. at onset, most patients refer weakness in the lower extremities, difficulty in running or climbing stairs, sometimes accompanied with pain  <cit> . regarding the alterations produced by dysferlin mutations in muscle, prior reports have detected the presence of inflammation ; disruption of the t-tubule structure, which in turn was ameliorated by reduction of external  or blocking of l-type ca2+ channels with diltiazem  <cit> , suggesting that a deregulated entry of external ca2+ may underlie damage in dysferlin null myofibers. in addition, an altered permeability to dyes such as evans blue has been reported in skeletal muscles from dysf-/- mice   <cit> , and previous reports have demonstrated that evans blue crosses the cell membrane through cx hc  <cit> . hence, these results strongly suggest the presence of connexin based hemichannels  in the sarcolemma of myofibers from the animal model. as we previously reported, the de novo expression of cx hcs has been observed in similar pathologies, where they mediate myofiber atrophy induced by denervation  <cit> . interestingly, only a mild muscular atrophy was observed after denervation in cx <dig> and cx <dig> ko mice  <cit> . since cx hc are non-selective channels permeable to ions  and small compounds, including signaling molecules such as atp and nad+ and dyes including ethidium  and evans blue  <cit> , the altered membrane permeability caused by the cx hc expression could contribute to the development of the muscular atrophy. indeed, the de novo expression of cx hcs promotes the increase of oxidative stress in pathological conditions such as muscle denervation  <cit>  and they constitute a mechanism of atp release in several muscle pathologies  <cit> .

to date there is no effective treatment to arrest or even reduce the symptomatology of the patients affected with dysferlinopathies. nevertheless, the introduction of a mini-dysferlin in animal models of the disease  results in the recovery of membrane resealing function. however, the progressive degeneration, ascertained from muscle histology studies, remains unabated  <cit> . the aforementioned evidence points to the existence of an additional pathological mechanism, triggered by the absence of dysferlin. in the present work we evaluated whether myotubes of patients suffering from dysferlinopathies, as well as in other in vitro models of dysferlin deficiency, express cx hcs and whether the expression of these types of channels alters the sarcolemma permeability, and increases intracellular free ca2+ in these cells.

RESULTS
human muscles bearing dysferlin mutations express connexins  <dig> ,  <dig> and 45
we analyzed the presence of connexin proteins by immnunofluorescent microscopy in human muscles biopsies from patients bearing dysferlin mutations , the absence of dysferlin was confirmed by immunohistochemistry assays . as shown in fig.  <dig>  connexins  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  were detected in biopsies from patients with dysferlinopathy but not in biopsies of control subjects . these proteins colocalized with the plasma membrane protein spectrin   <cit> , indicating that all three connexins are present in the sarcolemma. using immunofluoresence, we next evaluated the presence of the purinergic receptor p2x <dig> and the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily v member  <dig> , which have been previously associated with muscular atrophy  <cit> . p2x <dig> receptors were detected in one of the two patients evaluated, whereas trpv <dig> was found in the biopsies of both patients . conversely, in control patients  both receptors were absent .fig.  <dig> connexins  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> are present in human biopsies from dysferlinopathy patients. connexin  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> were detected by immunofluorescence assay using specific antibodies in muscular biopsies obtained from five dysferlinopathy patients at the university of chile clinical hospital, and from a patient that not bear a muscular pathology . cell nuclei were stained with dapi . scale bar: 50 μm

because ca2+ influx is reportedly increased in human muscles bearing dysferlin mutations  <cit> , we evaluated the presence, in human dysferlin-mutated myotubes  , of different ca2+ channels; connexin-based hemichannels, transient potential receptor trpv <dig> and p2x <dig>  all of which have been previously linked in muscular pathologies  <cit> . we observed the presence of cxs  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> in all hdmm, although they have different dysferlin mutations , they were absent in normal myotubes . on the other hand, trpv <dig> channels and p2x <dig> receptors were only present in  <dig> and  <dig>  derived myotubes . trpv <dig> channels were functional in  <dig> myotubes, as evidenced by their response to stimulation with 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate , a selective trpv <dig> agonist  <cit> , which induces a sustained increase in ca2+ levels .fig.  <dig> human dysferlin-mutated myotubes present connexins  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  human dysferlin-mutated myotubes were obtained by differentiation of dysferlin-mutated myoblast lines named  <dig>   <dig>  ab <dig> and er, each one bearing different dysferlin mutations. connexins  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> were detected by immunofluorescence studies using specific antibodies. all cell lines showed positive reactivity to cxs  compared with control myotubes , where cxs reactivity was not detected. p2x <dig> receptor and trpv <dig> channel were also detected by immunofluorescence studies using specific antibodies. only  <dig> and  <dig> myotubes expressed p2x <dig> receptors and trpv <dig> channels. nuclei were stained with dapi . scale bar: 30 μm. n =  <dig> cell cultures for each cell line



absence of dysferlin in control rcmh myotubes mimics the dysferlin mutation effect
to demonstrate that the absence of dysferlin, regardless of the type of mutation, can induce the expression of connexins in normal human myotubes, we knocked-down expression of dysferlin in rcmh cells by transfecting a small hairpin rna specific for dysferlin, and transfected cells were subsequently differentiated to myotubes . in the absence of dysferlin, rcmh cells express connexins  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> , which were in control myotubes  that express dysferlin .fig.  <dig> silencing of dysferlin induces the presence of connexin  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> in human myotubes. control rcmh myoblasts were transfected with small hairpin rna to decrease dysferlin expression, to be later differentiated to myotubes by culturing in differentiation medium for 14 days. once myotubes were obtained, the presence of connexin  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>  and dysferlin  was analyzed by immunofluorescence assay using specific antibodies and compared with that of control rcmh myotubes . the three connexins, but not dysferlin, were detected in rcmh-sh dysferlin myotubes, whereas control rcmh myotubes present dysferlin  but not cxs. the nuclei were stained with dapi . scale bar: 50 μm. n =  <dig> cell cultures for each cell line



human dysferlin-mutated myotubes express functional connexin based hemichannels
because cx proteins are present in dysferlin-mutated myotubes , we analyzed whether these proteins were indeed forming functional hemichannels  in these cells. hemichannel activity was evaluated by ethidium  uptake assays  <cit> , which revealed that hdmm demonstrated elevated etd+ uptake compared with control myotubes . we detected a 4-fold increment in the  <dig> and  <dig> cell lines, compared with rcmh, whereas ab <dig> and er  showed an increment of 2-fold compared to rcmh. etd+ uptake was successfully inhibited with external application of 50 μm carbenoxolone , a cx hc inhibitor  <cit> . in addition, we observed that different dysferlin mutations exhibit different cx hc activity. indeed, cell lines  <dig> and  <dig> presented the highest cx hc activity . in addition, rcmh myotubes where dysferlin was silenced via specific small hairpin rna resulted in the expression of functional cx hcs to levels comparable to  <dig> and  <dig> myotubes .fig.  <dig> absence of dysferlin promotes elevated connexin-based hemichannel activity in human myotubes. human dysferlin-mutated myotubes and control myotubes transfected with small hairpin rna against dysferlin  were used to evaluate connexin hemichannel activity using the ethidium  uptake assay. briefly, a representative curve of etd+ uptake in myotubes differentiated from  <dig> myoblast cell line. notice the enhanced uptake after incubation in a divalent cation free solution , condition that induces opening of cx hcs. the signals were inhibited by 50 μm carbenoxolone, a cx hc blocker. b graph showing the fold variation between the dcfs-induced slope versus basal slope . * p <  <dig> ; **p <  <dig> ; ***p <  <dig> . n =  <dig> cell cultures for each cell line



inhibition of connexin-based hemichannels reduces elevated intracellular basal ca2+ signals
considering that ca2+ influx is reportedly increased in human muscles bearing dysferlin mutations  <cit> , and that human dysferlin-mutated myotubes express functional cx hcs , which in turn are non-selective permeable ca2+channels  <cit> , we analyzed basal cytosolic ca2+ levels in the dysferlin-deficient and control lines using fura 2-am assays. dysferlin-mutated myotubes showed significantly elevated ca2+ levels compared to control myotubes , a finding consistent with the increased cx hc activity observed in the four cell lines evaluated herein. since cx hcs were present and the basal intracellular ca2+ level was elevated in dysferlin-mutated myotubes, we then investigated whether the inhibition of cx hcs could prevent this phenomenon. therefore, human dysferlin-mutated myotubes were treated daily for 7 days with  <dig> nm d <dig>  a selective cx hc blocker that does not inhibit gap junction channels, thus allowing the fusion of myoblasts to form myotubes where gap junction channels are relevant  <cit> . incubation with d <dig> significantly reverted the intracellular basal ca2+ signals to values comparable to those of control cells , suggesting that these channels are responsible of this response.fig.  <dig> elevated intracellular basal ca2+ signal in dysferlin-mutated myotubes is reduced by cx hc inhibitor. four different dysferlin-mutated myotubes  were used, which were differentiated to myotubes with differentiation medium . the ca2+ signal was evaluated using the fura-2 am dye in a fluorescence microscope. signals were compared to those obtained in control myotubes . molecule d <dig> , a selective connexin hemichannels  inhibitor, was used. during the last 7 days  before the ca2+ measurement was performed, d <dig> was applied to prevent the increase of intracellular basal ca2+ signal in human dysferlin mutated myotubes. the data represent as mean ± sem. anova test with dunn post test. *p <  <dig> . n =  <dig> cell cultures for each cell line



discussion
in the present report, we have demonstrated that muscles from patients diagnosed with dysferlinopathy express cxs  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> at the plasma membrane. additionally, four immortalized muscle cell lines generated from muscle samples of dysferlinopathy patients also expressed these cxs, which in turn, formed functional cx-based hemichannels. this phenomenon was also induced in control myotubes , after decreasing dysferlin expression through the transfection  of a specific small hairpin rna against dysferlin. moreover, human dysferlin-mutated  <dig> and  <dig> myotubes expressed two additionals ca2+ permeable channels, the trpv <dig> channel and p2x <dig> receptor. these myotubes also exhibited greater cx hc activity, and such an elevated cx hc activity could explain the presence of these channels in the myotubes, which in turn could also contribute to the elevated intracellular ca2+ signal previously reported in dysferlin ko skeletal muscle fibers  <cit>  and confirmed here in our model. anyway, it seems that the presence of cx hcs is sufficient to explain the elevated basal intracellular ca2+ levels in dysferlin-deficient myocytes, especially if we consider that the specific inhibition of these channels with a selective blocker , was enough to reduce the elevated basal ca2+ concentration to levels similar to those of control cells. the mechanisms regulating ca2+ in myotubes, such as the na+/ca2+ exchanger, ca2+ binding proteins and most importantly the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum ca2+ atpases , are extremely efficient in controlling the cytosolic levels of this cation  <cit> . even so, integration of cx hemichannels into the plasma membrane increased the basal ca2+ concentration by ~8 %, which may be enough to alter cellular homeostasis of myocytes. this increment in ca2+ levels could be enough to alter the cellular homeostasis of the myocytes. indeed, an altered cytosolic ca2+ level could induce several changes in the myotubes, including an increased proteolytic activity  <cit> , which occurs in muscles from patients bearing dysferlin mutations  <cit> . the latter could then drive atrophy in affected muscles, and also to cause the degeneration of muscles by apoptosis or necrosis  <cit> . these findings have been previously observed in duchenne muscular dystrophy were resting ca2+ levels in human dmd myotubes were increased compared with normal myotubes  <cit> .

therefore, in addition to the deficit in membrane repair mechanism found in dysferlin-mutated myofibers  <cit> , we propose herein a second pathological mechanism as a consequence of dysferlin mutations, which involves cx hcs. these non-selective channels could explain several of the reported features in dysferlin-deficient muscles, including the increased membrane permeability  <cit> , higher proteasome activity  <cit> , activation of inflammation signals  and muscle degeneration  <cit> . the latter interpretation is supported by prior reports showing the role of cx hc in altered membrane permeability and atrophy of skeletal muscles induced by denervation  <cit> . although the mechanism responsible of the induction of connexins by the absence of dysferlin still remains to be elucidated, the fact that the knock-down of dysferlin induces the de novo expression of functional connexin-based hemichannels suggests a direct relation between the absence of dysferlin and the presence of connexin. however, it has been demonstrated that some conditions such as inflammation induces the expression of functional connexin-based hemichannels in skeletal muscles through proinflammatory cytokines and the transcription factor nfκb  <cit> . inflammation has been described as a key feature in dysferlin-mutated skeletal muscles  <cit> . whether the induction of cx hc involves an activation of nfκb still needs to be investigated.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have demonstrated the presence of connexins  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> in muscular biopsies of patients with different dysferlin mutations. this was confirmed in myotubes derived from cell lines of human dysferlinopathy patients, as well as in normal myotubes where dysferlin was knocked down. the cxs expressed formed functional connexin based hemichannels, that are responsible of elevated basal intracellular ca2+ levels in human myotubes. the presence of these channels may represent a novel pathological mechanism in dysferlinopathies, as well as a most attractive therapeutical target, considering their localization at the membrane level.
