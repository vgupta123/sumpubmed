BACKGROUND
cell-cell recognition is critical to a wide range of problems in biology and medicine  <cit> . the development of experimental approaches associated with cell-cell recognition has promoted advances in understanding these effects, e.g., biochemical assays for protein binding and transcription,. however, less attention has been focused on developing algorithms for the detection of cell-cell recognition from the structure and spatial distribution of cells. such methods would offer complimentary benefits to biochemical assays, due to the relative ease of collecting microscopy data from cell cultures and tissues. this would be useful also in combinatorial and high-throughput screening of cell-cell and cell-material interactions  <cit> . in adhesion dependent cells, cell-cell recognition is known to be a crucial step in initiating contact inhibition  of cell migration <cit>  and proliferation <cit> . ci plays an important role in the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of cancer cells,  <cit>  cardiovascular tissue homeostasis and development,  <cit>  embryonic development,  <cit>  and wound healing,  <cit>  among many other biological phenomena. conversely, it has also been shown that under certain conditions cell-cell contact can promote cell proliferation, known as "density-dependent" contact stimulation of cell proliferation <cit> . the investigation of mechanisms relating cell contact, cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation, in which cell adhesion molecules play a major role, is a rich area of research. cadherins, e.g., ve-cadherin,  <cit>  e-cadherin <cit>  and n-cadherin,  <cit>  and notch proteins <cit>  have been shown to mediate contact-dependent phenomena in a wide variety of cell types.

here, ci of proliferation, a known cell-cell recognition phenomenon, is used as a model system for developing algorithms for the analysis of cell-cell recognition from microscopy data. usually, the effects of cell density on proliferation are studied as relationships between global descriptions, such as average cell density, proliferation rate, and protein expression level <cit> . however, as we demonstrate below, these summary-statistic descriptions are only sensitive to the effects of very large changes in cell density. as a result, global metrics do not illuminate all of the information available from image data for cell contact phenomena. this is because cell-cell contacts are local interactions and are very sensitive to short-range cell-to-cell distance. when global metrics are used, such as cell density in a set of images, all cell-to-cell distances are treated equally. critical information pertaining to nearest-neighbor cell-to-cell distances is "diluted" by the many other cell-to-cell distances in the data set, which is observed as noise in the data. furthermore, the stochastic characteristics of cell behavior add to the noise so that only major trends of the responses of cells to neighbors is distinguishable over very large changes in cell density <cit> . to address this "dilution" effect, nelson and chen studied contact stimulation effects on the growth of a single pair of cells by using specially-designed surfaces to decouple the effects of cell-cell contact from others <cit> .

in this paper, we introduce a complementary approach that allows focused analysis on nearest-neighbor cells, but permits sampling from cultures with high cell densities and use of any type of surface. we had previously applied this technique to screen large image databases from cell cultures on combinatorial libraries of biomaterials <cit> . here, we outline the details of this method and discuss it's generalization to bayesian modelling. the method is based upon defining local cell metrics , which are histograms of cell properties. the use of these local variables expands the sample space considerably and allows separation of arbitrarily-defined short- and long-range effects. we show how the local cell metrics are then incorporated into a bayesian model. the new method and model are examined quantitatively and compared with traditional summary approaches in a study of contact inhibition of osteoblast proliferation.

methods
experimental
surface preparation
poly   and poly   were obtained from sigma aldrich, st louis, mo. plga and pcl, respectively, were dissolved in chloroform to 8% and 5% mass and spin coated on silicon chips . to provide adhesion of these polymers to the silicon during cell culture, the silicon was pretreated with a piranha etch  followed by  <dig> min in a hf acid bath and a final rinse in di water .

cell culture
established from newborn mouse calvaria,  <cit>  the mc3t3-e <dig> cell line has been shown capable of differentiating into osteoblast and osteocytes in vitro <cit> . mc3t3-e <dig> cells have been shown to exhibit specific bone related protein expression patterns, under different developmental stages, similar to primary mouse calvaria cells <cit> . this cell line is thus a suitable in vitro model for investigating cell behaviors, regulations of such behaviors, and underlying mechanisms in different osteoblast maturation stages <cit> . since the original mc3t3-e <dig> cell line has been found phenotypically heterogeneous with regard to cell differentiation, more homogeneous subclones have been established <cit> . in this work, mc3t3-e <dig> subclone  <dig> , which shows homogenous capabilities of osteogenesis both in vitro and in vivo,  <cit>  was chosen in order to minimize variations due to phenotypical heterogeneities.

cell proliferation was assayed by brdu immunohistochemistry. briefly, plga- and pcl-coated wafers were mounted into costar® 6-well tc-treated microplates . the tissue culture treated polystyrene  surfaces of the microplate wells were used as controls. after sterilization , mc3t3-e <dig> cells  were seeded onto the coated wafers at  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/cm <dig>  this relatively high seeding density was selected to highlight the effects of contact inhibition of cell growth and other space-sensitive cell-to-cell interactions. after seeding, microplates were shaken for  <dig> min on a shaker  to obtain uniform seeding. cells were cultured in dmem  with 10% fetal bovine serum , l-glutamine and streptomycin at 37°c in a humidified 5% co <dig> atmosphere. at  <dig> h post seeding, surfaces were washed with dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline  to remove non-attached cells, and fresh culture medium was then added. at  <dig> h post seeding,  <dig> mm brdu  in pbs was added to the culture medium to reach a final concentration of  <dig> μm. after  <dig> h of brdu incorporation, cells were fixed with  <dig> % paraformaldehyde and brdu incorporation was assayed by immunohistochemistry .

low calcium concentration suppresses contact inhibition of cell growth by deactivating calcium-dependent cadherins <cit> . this phenomenon was used in this study to validate the local cell metrics, and at the same time the dependency of contact inhibition on calcium was quantitatively studied. in order to investigate the role of ca++ on cell spreading and proliferation, brdu incorporation experiments in low ca++ medium were performed on tcps surfaces. fifteen minutes before the introduction of brdu, cells were rinsed twice with dpbs  and afterword cultured in the low ca++ medium  <cit> . the rest of the protocol was the same as previously described.

image acquisition
cell locations and proliferation were quantified using fluorescent microscopy . a robotic translation stage was used to image predetermined locations on each culture surface using a microfire™ monochromic digital camera . the image locations were fixed on a  <dig> ×  <dig> grid with horizontal and vertical spacing of  <dig> μm and vertical spacing of  <dig> μm. for each location a  <dig> ×  <dig> μm <dig> brdu staining image and hoechst counter staining image were acquired at a resolution of  <dig> ×  <dig> pixels <dig>  all images and contextual information were organized and stored in an oracle®  <dig> g  database for further image processing and data analysis.

image processing
the image processing toolbox of matlab™ r <dig>  was employed for image processing. due to the volume of image data dynamic, self-adapting algorithms were developed for automated image processing. binary images of both surface lateral patterns of cell nuclei counter staining were obtained from raw grayscale microscopic images by a variation-adjusted iterative selection method , which was modified from the original iterative selection method  <cit>  .

binary images of cell nuclei were segmented by the marker-controlled watershed method <cit>  to separate images of closely-spaced cell nuclei. this process was critical because the nuclei of a pair of recently-proliferated cells were often too close to be distinguished with thresholding alone. resultant black-and-white cell nuclei images were used as masks by overlaying them with corresponding brdu staining images to determine the fluorescence intensity of incorporated brdu. the histogram of brdu staining intensity per nucleus  is composed of two major peaks: the low intensity peak  represents cells at rest, while the high intensity peak  indicates proliferating cells. the optimal threshold between these two peaks was determined automatically by vais. briefly, starting at an initial threshold ti =  <dig> , the histogram was divided into resting  and proliferating  parts. means and standard deviations of the foreground and background, respectively denoted as mbi, mfi, σbi, and σfi, were determined by fitting each peak to a gaussian curve. a new threshold was calculated as ti+ <dig> = / and was repeated until convergence on a stable threshold. compared with more common iterative selection methods, which use a simple mean intensity, the modified vais procedure is more robust when background and foreground intensities have different variances. indeed, the variance of the brdu signal intensity from non-proliferating cells was significantly greater than that of the proliferating cells . during image processing, data washing in the form of median filtering was performed to remove noise below a certain threshold. image processing was supervised in order to assure the performance of self-adaptive algorithms and images of poor quality not permitting quantification were occasionally discarded. proliferation behaviors were determined for every cell and stored in the database along with the cell location on the surfaces.

methodologies of data analysis
global metrics
cell density and proliferation were described with summary statistics such as number of resting and proliferated cells computed for each image. this provides a set of global metrics for features in each image. as indicated in figure 1a, global metrics are most naturally understood in terms of conventional summary-statistics, exploratory data analysis, and well-known methods for estimating confidence and significance levels based on an assumed probability distribution. the ability to detect contact inhibition of cell proliferation, a known phenomenon, was used as an indicator of the effectiveness of the global metrics cell density and proliferation averages.

definition of local cell metrics
source codes that implement the algorithms presented in this section have been made available by the authors.  consider that the collection of all cells  is composed of either proliferated  or resting cells , such that a = p + r. the symbol a represents any cell chosen at random, regardless of proliferative status. the proliferating-resting cell distance, pr, is used here to illustrate the definition and properties of local cell metrics, as indicated in figure 1b. the definitions below are generalizable to any type of cell-cell distance, or any other spatial or temporal metric of cells. assume that in the kth image the number of p-class and r-class cells is npk and nrk, the distance prijk between the centroids of the nuclei of the ith p-cell and the jth r-cell can be calculated readily from the results of image analysis. in the kth image, the set of all such distances, prk is defined as   

and for all images an overall set pr can be defined as   

a set of n+ <dig> distance bins is defined as   

where d <dig>  d <dig>  ..., dn is a user-defined distance scale over which analysis is to be performed. the centroid of each interval in bindist is defined as   

and the resultant centroid set for bindist is   

the bindist is used to sort set pr into an n-bin histogram   

where  is the number of pr distances that fall in the interval [di- <dig>  di), which is centered at .

the total number of elements in set pr is   

after normalizing by npr, the frequency function lcm is   

and  represents the r-type cell environment of the p-type cells observed over distances . frequency functions, denoted as , , , and , may also calculated for cell-to-cell distances pp, aa, rr, and pa in similar manner.

lcm normalization
normalization is necessary to interpret lcms in a meaningful manner and to compare the probability of cell responses under different cell environments. one method of normalization is to relate observed occurrences to random occurrences. given the finite image size and generally non-overlapping nature of cultured cells, the distribution of random cell occurrences is not gaussian. the random distribution for cell-cell distance, fstd, was calculated as the any cell-any cell distribution  of 1×  <dig> randomly-chosen nuclei positions on a simulated image  <dig> pixels by  <dig> pixels. the normalized lcm  is   

other lcms  are normalized similarly, which allows direct comparisons of different types of cell distances on different surfaces.

in addition to normalizing by the standard distribution, fstd, direct ratios between lcms are used also in our analysis, in which case fstd cancels, as indicated in the next equation.   

the ratio rpr|pa highlights the specific effects of non-proliferated cells on the central proliferating cell relative to the effects of any given cell. thus, the probability of cell responses under different cell environments can be compared meaningfully. furthermore, each set of cell-to-cell distances can be decomposed into subsets, which allows investigation of the contribution of each subset to the overall effect. therefore, ratios of cell backgrounds may be constructed and used as classifiers for screening and identifying significant cell environment patterns. these ratios also define posterior odds  of observing certain proliferation behaviors. for example, consider , and using the subscript i to signify the evaluation at a certain distance , the ratio is calculated as   

where      

applying equations  and  to equation ,   

thus,  is a posterior odds that quantifies how the probability of cell proliferation is changed by the presence of a second cell located at distance , relative to the average proliferation for all cell-cell distances. computationally, to promote the efficiency of the codes, we defined ak = {pk, rk}={p1k, p2k, ..., pnpk, r1k, r2k, ..., rnrk}, and removed self-to-self cell pairs  and identical cell pairs  from pa.

lcm decomposition
furthermore, each set of cell-to-cell distances can be decomposed into subsets, which allows isolation of each subset's contribution. for example, consider rpr|pa defined above. as described graphically in figure  <dig>  since the denominator pa = pp ∪ pr  and pp ∩ pr = ∅ , one may remove the pr component from pa, and the denominator becomes pp. the result is that the ratio rpr|pa is transformed into rpr|pp. by removing the shared, or overlapping, component pr from the denominator, rpr|pp has higher "contrast" for observing effects of r-cells on p-cells than rpr|pa.

connection of lcms to bayesian statistics
local cell metrics are naturally connected to bayesian analysis, which is a powerful statistical method used for classification <cit> . specifically for the pr distance, the bayesian approach allows one to quantify the local environment of p cells, as the conditional probability of finding an r cell a certain distance pr from a p cell. based on the definition of fpr in equation , a naïve bayes model can be established as follows. consider a "test" cell chosen at random. it is desired to predict the possibility this cell will be in proliferating status, based upon the local environment of non-proliferating cells, which is given by the following conditional probability function   

where  represents the probability of finding a non-proliferating cell at a distance of  from the central, randomly chosen, test cell. using bayes's theorem,   

in the above function, the components p() and p are constants that can be determined from their frequency in the data. the only non-constant component, the class-conditional probability, is given by   

assuming the occurrence probabilities around the non-proliferating cell distances  are conditionally independent , then  where i ≠ j . hence, equation  reduces to   

a key development is to notice that , which means that under the naïve bayes assumption the lcm is in fact a class-conditional probability function. the term p() represents the probability of locating the r cells at distances () from any cell, which is . hence, the bayes conditional probability function from equation  becomes   

the naïve bayes model allows prediction of the probability of proliferation as a function of the lcms,  and , which are easily computed from a training data set, as is p. the evaluation of this modeling approach will be the subject of forthcoming work.

RESULTS
traditional metrics
to provide a benchmark for establishing the effectiveness of local metrics, contact inhibition of cell proliferation was studied using global analysis first. for each image in the database, the overall cell proliferation is plotted versus cell density, shown in figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  although a trend towards lower proliferation at higher cell density is somewhat apparent in figure  <dig>  global analysis, does not allow for quantitative detection of ci effects on cell proliferation at a statistically-significant level. the linear regression  yields in an adjusted r <dig> of  <dig>   or  <dig>  , indicating that the contact inhibition effect masked by "noise" in the data. furthermore, it is obvious that in figure  <dig>  no regression function can be fit satisfactorily to the global statistics, since the noise is too high relative to the ci effects. the use of a larger range may allow the global analysis to distinguish contact effects from natural variance in cell properties. this has been demonstrated in repeated experiments on plga, pcl, and tcps surfaces. . however, there are drawbacks to the use of larger ranges, such as the introduction of seeding-density effects that mask or alter the cell-cell interactions.

local cell based metrics
the noise level inherent to proliferation measurements, which are normally carried out over a small seeding density range, make contact inhibition a robust test-case for comparing local vs. global metrics. a contact phenomenon is detected when a relevant metric changes significantly relative to the data sampling noise. for global statistics, the assumed distribution  provides the random noise reference. for local metrics, the random cell-cell distance frequency distribution was calculated using a monte-carlo approach, termed the standard frequency distribution, fstd. the reference fstd is shown in figure  <dig> together with the experimental faa for mc3t3-e <dig> osteoblasts on plga. the profile of fstd is similar to a beta- or chi-distribution with asymmetry due to the non-overlapping nature of the nuclei centers at close distances. the computed fstd distribution is nearly identical to the experimental faa distribution at large distances . this is expected since faa indicates the likelihood of finding any two cells  separated by a given distance, which should in principle be random. figure  <dig> also shows the distance distribution fpa, which is the likelihood of finding a proliferated cell a certain distance from any cell. if cell-cell distance has any relation to proliferative status then fpa and faa should differ from one another and from fstd, but only at close distances where cell-cell contact is likely to occur.

figures  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  which show the normalized distributions fpa/fstd, faa/fstd and fpp/fstd at close distances, indicate the non-random effects of contact inhibition when the values become less than one. specifically, ci occurs when the distance between cell nuclei becomes less than about  <dig> μm. the typical mean cell area was around  <dig> μm <dig>  resulting in a mean diameter of  <dig> μm, which corresponds closely to the onset of ci. representative images of cultured mc3t3-e <dig> cells on these surfaces have been presented in previous work <cit> . in addition, local fine structure in the contact inhibition region is observed as a local maximum peak between  <dig> and  <dig> μm. this peak indicates enhanced local proliferation at very close distance, even when overall proliferation is being inhibited. interestingly the local peak magnitudes at  <dig> to  <dig> μm always follow the order fpp >faa >fpa on each of the three surfaces examined, tcps, plga and pcl. we hypothesize that the local enhancement peak is due to two daughter cells  that are very close, which have not had enough time to migrate away during the brdu staining time period. if so, then this cell division peak should appear on the fpp curve but not the fpr curve, which was observed comparing figures  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  to figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . in addition, in the monte carlo simulation of random cell positions , with no proliferation, this local peak is absent.)

direct ratios between experimentally-determined distributions can be chosen specifically to illuminate the ci phenomena of interest. specifically, common components in the numerator and denominator not related to ci phenomena may be removed, thus isolating the phenomena of interest. this process is examined in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  figure  <dig> shows the rpa|aa profile, which is classified into two regions: the proliferation suppressed region  where cell proliferation was suppressed up to  <dig> fold  and the null region  where cell proliferation was not noticeably affected by the contact of other cells. based on the discussion for figure  <dig>  the ratio rpa|aa does not fully decouple the division and daughter-cell migration phenomena  from the proliferation phenomena , since pp ⊂ pa. we illustrate how separation of the pp and pr components enhances the detection of contact inhibition of proliferation. by definition the various distances are related as follows   

with   

where ∅ is the empty set. the two shared components of aa and pa are pp and pr. the pp distance component represents distances between cells that have both proliferated, i.e., proliferation in those pairs was not contact inhibited. removal of the common pp component from the numerator and denominator of rpa|aa leads to rpr|rr, shown in figures  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> for the plga, pcl, and tcps surfaces, respectively. by definition rpr|rr should be more sensitive to ci of proliferation, because non contact inhibited cell pairs have been removed. in figure  <dig>  the rpr|rr ratio is classified into two regions: the nan region  where few pairs occur, and the contact inhibition region . in the contact inhibition region, a clear trend of decreasing probability of finding a neighboring cell is seen as the distance between cells decreases. a minimum is observed at dmin =  <dig> μm, where contact inhibition effects are maximized. to our knowledge, this is the first time both the magnitude and the range of contact inhibition of cell proliferation have been determined quantitatively in a single function.

the physical meaning of the lcm ratio rpr|rr can be can be illustrated by recognizing that it is the posterior odds  of proliferation as a function of cell-cell distance. consider two cells that are well-separated at  <dig> μm, and another two cells that are at a close distance of  <dig> μm, where the extreme in contact inhibition behavior is found . the po that one of the closely-spaced cells has proliferated is popr/rr = rpr|rr /rpr|rr  = 1/ <dig>  this means there is a  <dig> fold lower chance of proliferation at  <dig> μm than at a distance of  <dig> μm.

the profiles of rpr/rr from the other polymer surfaces are shown in figure  <dig>  and figure  <dig> . the ratios are similar in shape but have different magnitudes for the minimum point as a function of the surface. table  <dig> summarizes the variation of rpr|rr, min and dmin on the different surfaces. the different location and strength of contact inhibition might be due to surface features such as roughness, crystallinity, hydrophobicity, surface charge, or protein adsorption, factors which are known to influence osteoblast proliferation <cit> . for example, the surface roughness increases in the order tcps < plga < pcl, and at the same time the popp/pr is decreasing, and the dmin is increasing. we illustrate this point, however, not to make a definite mechanistic argument about surface effects on proliferation, which is certainly more complicated than roughness alone. rather, the point made is that the lcm method is capable of sensitive detection of differences in proliferation for cells cultured on different surfaces.

the effect of calcium depletion on lcms is presented in figure  <dig>  the  distribution of the control  was significantly lower than the low calcium  case. in addition, the 'calcium -' curve stays close to unity except at very close distances, less than  <dig> μm, whereas the 'calcium +' curve falls below unity at  <dig> μm. hence, the lcm  detects the expected result: that low calcium should inhibit the cell-cell self-avoidance and contact inhibition <cit> . this effect is seen more clearly in examining the ratio rpr/rr, in figure  <dig>  contact inhibition was very strong within a cell-to-cell distance of  <dig> μm when cells were cultured under physiological calcium concentration . however, contact inhibition disappeared when calcium was depleted .

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that global summary statistics are not adequate metrics for detecting local cell interactions, due to noise and non-local effects inherent to cell-cell contact phenomena. a novel data analysis strategy, local cell metrics, has been introduced in this paper. lcms, which are cell-cell distance histograms, describe cell environments from the "point of view" of individual cells. these metrics allow focusing of analysis onto arbitrarily-defined close distances. in addition, lcms can be 'tuned' to be sensitive to specific contact phenomena by decomposing the distributions into specific cell-types  and removing unwanted components. local metrics as defined herein are not limited to proliferation analysis, nor to cell-cell interactions alone. the metrics are generic and can be, in principle, applied to any type of quantifiable cell assay, and can be applied to cell-biomaterial and cell-tissue interactions as well. we have also shown how lcms are related to the naïve bayes model, which makes them useful for data mining and classification 

we have demonstrated the new local metrics by considering the contact inhibition of proliferation of the osteoblast cell line mc3t3-e <dig>  a quantitative and probabilistic description of the contact inhibition effect as a function of cell-cell distance has been achieved. in fact, the probability of proliferation is shown to be strongly dependent on the distance to, and proliferative state of, neighboring cells. the lcms were also sensitive to effects of the culture surface, and of calcium composition in the culture media, on proliferation.
