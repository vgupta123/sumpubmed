BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus is a versatile pathogenic bacterium capable of rapidly developing or acquiring multiple antibiotic resistances, and is now recognized as a worldwide health problem  <cit> . s. aureus is responsible for a wide spectrum of human and animal diseases, ranging from benign skin infections to severe diseases, such as arthritis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis or fatal sepsis  <cit> . acute infections are related to the organisms' capacity to secrete a plethora of exotoxins  <cit>  and catabolic enzymes  <cit> , as documented previously in different experimental models of acute infections  <cit> . s. aureus is also responsible for chronic diseases such as osteomyelitis  <cit> , rhinosinusitis  <cit> , or otitis  <cit> . these infections are difficult to eradicate and often relapse even after prolonged and adapted antibiotic therapy  <cit> , suggesting that s. aureus has developed specific strategies for intracellular persistence. in addition, anti-infective agents commonly used for the treatment of s. aureus infections could enhance selection of invasive intracellular strains  <cit> .

in contrast to other persistent human pathogens, s. aureus is not traditionally considered as an intracellular pathogen  <cit> . nevertheless, substantial evidence strongly supports that s. aureus can be internalized and survive in a variety of non-professional phagocytic cells in vitro  <cit>  and in vivo  <cit> . the endocytic uptake of s. aureus by non-myeloid cells involves active cellular processes that depend upon f-actin polymerization and is similar in many respects to that observed in professional phagocytes  <cit> . whereas entero-invasive pathogens utilize secretion systems to actively induce their own uptake by the host cell, internalization of s. aureus by non-professional phagocytes shows similar efficiency in vitro with live or killed bacteria  <cit> . the mechanism relies on an interaction between fibronectin binding protein and host-cell α5β <dig> integrins  <cit> . the role of other bacterial surface proteins like clumping-factor a or host cell src kinase also appears important in the mediation of s. aureus uptake and intracellular persistence  <cit> . after internalization, the behavior of the bacterium varies according to cell-line or bacterial strain. for example, some authors reported active intracellular bacterial replication within vacuoles  <cit>  or rapid bacterial escape from vacuole and induction of cellular apoptosis  <cit> , while others described persistence for several days before induction of escape processes  <cit> . the production of α-toxin appears correlated with the induction of apoptosis  <cit> . regulation of α-toxin expression is complex and involves multiple regulators that include agr, sara homologues, or svra  <cit> .

molecular details that govern s. aureus extended persistence are largely unknown. metabolic alterations leading to small colony variant  microorganisms are one possibility that has been described  <cit> . such s. aureus variants were recently shown to efficiently invade endothelial cells in vitro and display a markedly higher content in fibronectin-binding proteins than the parental strain  <cit> . scvs display a major alteration in their ability to produce or export exotoxins  <cit>  and reveal extensive changes in their global regulatory network  <cit> . overall this persistent behavior, possibly related to alteration of regulatory networks, appears compatible with the property of s. aureus to generate relapsing infections even years after a first episode was apparently cured  <cit> .

several studies have examined details of cellular responses after s. aureus internalization in either phagocytic or non-phagocytic cells  <cit> . however, little is known about bacterial gene expression upon cellular internalization. recent efforts in high throughput sequencing have contributed to the elucidation of numerous bacterial genomes. to date, eight fully annotated s. aureus genomes are publicly available  <cit>  allowing the design of dna microarrays to probe the bacterial transcriptome  <cit> , or to catalogue and type variation among clinical isolates  <cit> .

in this study, we describe an in vitro model where s. aureus is able to persist for up to two weeks in the absence of either cellular death or emergence of small colony variants. s. aureus gene expression changes between adherent bacteria and those arising  <dig> h and  <dig> h after cellular internalization were compared using a custom-designed and validated s. aureus oligoarray  <cit> . profound shut-down of gene expression was observed shortly after internalization for bacterial metabolic functions and transport. this period was followed by resumption of transcriptional activity for metabolic and energy production functions correlating with moderate bacterial multiplication. these findings suggest that s. aureus extensively reprograms its transcriptome to adjust to the intracellular environment. detailed study of these changes may help understanding the molecular mechanisms governing establishment and maintenance of persistent s. aureus infections and potentially helpful for the design of new antibacterial drugs.

RESULTS
infection model and bacterial rna isolation
we developed a model system that displayed protective survival of s. aureus  <dig> within human lung epithelial cells a <dig>  control experiments were performed to examine infection parameters and determine the saturation of internalization. figure 1a shows bacterial internalization as a function of the multiplicity of infection . the profile describes a linear dose-response until saturation for m.o.i higher than  <dig> s. aureus per cell. we next examined the intracellular survival of strain  <dig> as a function of time using the lysostaphin/gentamicin protection assay, as shown figure 1b. we observed substantial intracellular survival during the first  <dig> hour post-internalization. notably, we observed a 3-fold increase in viable bacteria recovered at  <dig> hours post internalization compared with  <dig> hours indicating most probably that bacterial replication, or completion of cell division, had occurred. viable bacterial counts diminished slightly in the 6– <dig> h interval. a  <dig> log decrease in recovered bacteria was observed in the interval from 1– <dig> days post-infection indicating substantial infection clearance. nevertheless, viable bacteria could be recovered in this model system up to  <dig> weeks post infection. strain  <dig> produces strong α-toxin amounts as revealed on blood agar plates as well as in strains recovered from the intracellular survival assay . we observed no emergence of scv at any time point in the assay. we conclude that the model reflects both a window of bacterial survival and replication as well as persistent infection and we focused in early time-points  for subsequent detailed study. microscopic observations with trypan blue revealed no significant cytotoxicity as well as the absence of any cellular morphologic alteration during the first  <dig> days of co-incubation . subsequent viability assays were performed at a sub-saturating m.o.i. of 100: <dig> using strains  <dig> or atcc <dig>  previously described as cytotoxic in other cell lines  <cit> . control jurkat t cells revealed altered cellular viability in the presence of any of the two bacterial strains or by contact with pro-apoptotic compounds . in contrast, a total absence of cellular toxicity was observed in a <dig> cells in the presence of either  <dig> or atcc strains. similarly to previously published observation  <cit> , anti-cd <dig> failed also to affect a <dig> viability whereas etoposide showed a significant impact on a <dig> viability .

purification of bacterial rna from intracellular bacteria proved difficult due to significant excess of eukaryotic material. after protocol optimizations, the extraction and amplification procedures showed appreciable reproducibility  with pearson correlation value of  <dig> – <dig> , an important parameter in microarray experiments  <cit> . nevertheless, bacterial rna preparations contained detectable contaminating rna traces from host-cell. absence of detectable cross-hybridization on the microarray with cellular rna demonstrates the high specificity of the microarray for bacterial messengers resulting from the design strategy .

analysis of gene expression changes in extracellular and adherent bacteria
we first performed several microarray experiments to evaluate the impact of cell culture medium, presence of cells, presence of cytochalasin d, and bacterial attachment to cells, on the bacterial transcriptome expression. the experimental design and pairwise comparisons performed are depicted in figure 2a. the following conditions were tested: i) bacteria propagated in invasive medium alone, ii) non-adherent bacteria cultivated in the presence of cells, iii) non-adherent bacteria recovered from infections in the presence of cytochalasin d, and iv) cell-adherent bacteria in the presence of cytochalasin d. no significant changes in gene regulation were recorded from all possible pair-wise comparisons. we conclude from this analysis that exposure of bacteria to our experimental parameters prior to cellular internalization does not result in detectable alteration of bacterial transcriptome. we then compared expression values obtained at time  <dig> in the culture medium against those obtained after  <dig> or  <dig> hours of internalization.

analysis of intracellular bacterial gene expression changes
previous studies performed in our laboratory indicated that bacterial uptake by both a <dig> and mrc <dig> lung epithelial cells is a rapid process   <cit> . from this result, as well as those presented in figure 1b, we reasoned that  <dig> and  <dig> hour time points would reveal new information about bacterial transcriptomic program required for early essential adaptation to the intracellular environment. we therefore evaluated the transcriptome of s. aureus after  <dig> and  <dig> h post-internalization.

comparison of gene expression between control  and  <dig> h or  <dig> h post-infection conditions revealed extensive modifications in bacterial gene regulation. the complete raw data set as imported from the array scanner as well as the  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and functional group cluster is available online  <cit> .

statistically significant changes in gene expression were found for  <dig> and  <dig> genes after  <dig> h or  <dig> h of infection, respectively . after  <dig> h of infection,  <dig> genes were up-regulated whereas  <dig> were down-regulated, while  <dig> genes were found up-regulated and  <dig> genes down-regulated  <dig> h post-infection . the numbers of genes showing differential expression levels only for one of the two time-points were  <dig> and  <dig> for  <dig> or  <dig> h, respectively. since all tested control conditions did not result in significant changes in gene expression, we conclude that these massive alterations in transcription profiles are triggered upon bacterial internalization.

clustering and functional group assignment
differentially expressed genes were clustered by functional group categories according to the cog classification  <cit>  . an additional category consisting in documented virulence factors was added , according to established criteria  <cit> . overall, the general trend revealed a substantial down-regulation of genes involved in metabolic functions . for example, among the  <dig> orfs encoding for ribosomal proteins, >  <dig> were found down-regulated at  <dig> h, or  <dig> h. this reduction concerned also the totality of the atp operon  responsible for atp synthesis and genes involved in nucleotide and amino acid metabolism. note however that the majority of these genes were up-regulated between  <dig> and  <dig> hours. similar responses were also observed for numerous genes involved in sugar metabolism and energy production. a more balanced picture was observed among signal transduction and transcription regulators . changes in gene expression of hypothetical reading frames were observed to be equally distributed between down- and up-regulated genes. among genes that were up-regulated, we noted a significant number of targets involved in iron metabolism and other inorganic ions  contributing to oxidative stress protection. among the most significantly up-regulated genes, we observed defense genes, such as soda, ahp and also transcription regulators of virulence factors , rnaiii, sars  and svra  which are known to modulate the expression of the agr locus  <cit> . another category showing important changes in gene expression was transporters . more than  <dig> genes were found significantly differentially regulated including transporters of iron, sugars, nucleotides and amino-acids. importantly, expression of toxic virulence factors and α-hemolysin were found either down-regulated, or unchanged, compared to the control conditions . finally, the number of genes involved in biosynthesis or degradation of bacterial envelopes showed contrasted levels of expression after internalization as compared to extracellular control bacteria . whereas cell-wall metabolism enzymes  showed drastic up-regulation, transpeptidase, acid techoic synthesis genes, the mur operon and several cap genes showed massive down-regulation after internalization .

based on the time-points studied, two major regulation profiles were found composed of genes showing: i) large down-regulation after  <dig> h, then a slight increase at  <dig> h, and ii) up-regulation at  <dig> h then only marginal change at  <dig> h. these two categories are presented in figure 4a in the upper-right and lower-left corners, respectively. grouping by functional category revealed that the first expression profile is mainly composed of mobile elements, transporters, regulators and iron metabolism . the other categories were mainly composed of genes involved in nutrient transport, general and nucleotide metabolism, and ribosomal proteins, but also in dna replication and carbohydrate metabolism .

analysis of gene expression changes in the interval  <dig> h- <dig> h post-infection. to examine gene expression changes occurring during its intracellular passage, we extracted a list of genes that were differentially expressed  between times  <dig> h and  <dig> h after internalization. a striking up-regulation of gene expression was observed at  <dig> h post-infection in most functional categories, consistent with bacteria readapting their energy production, intermediary metabolism, protein synthesis, and nucleotide biosynthesis. this finding is consistent with metabolic restart necessary for the observed bacterial doublings in the 2– <dig> h time interval .

qpcr validation of array data for selected genes
as an independent measure of differential gene expression, we examined the relative levels of  <dig> genes selected from different functional categories by quantitative real-time pcr showing up- or down-regulation or unchanged level of expression. as previously established in other studies, the absolute magnitudes of normalized signals reflects the broader dynamic range of the qpcr method compared to microarray measurements  <cit> . the results are shown in figure  <dig> and are correlated in terms of up- or down-regulation with microarray determinations. notably, the data confirms the observed down-regulation of agr expression correlated with the absence of hla transcription. congruent changes were observed for lytm, sars and soda that showed up-regulation of their expression as previously recorded using microarrays .

discussion
recent efforts in the field of high-throughput sequencing contributed to the public release of numerous bacterial genomes of medical importance. this information allowed the development of microarrays able to monitor gene expression changes at the genome scale. we report here the utilization of a microarray covering the whole genome of staphylococcus aureus to evaluate the behavior of the bacterium upon cellular internalization, a phenomenon potentially contributing to bacterial protection against host defenses, and important in the context of chronic infections. our overall findings are in agreement with previous studies utilizing experimental cellular models of bacterial internalization, using either intracellular or facultative intracellular pathogens. if the ability of s. aureus to persist in different in vitro models is widely accepted, the capacity of s. aureus to escape from host-defenses and persist intracellularly in vivo is still debated  <cit> . in this respect, the call to document "the presence of staphylococci within non-professional phagocytes at sites of infection in clinicopathological tissues"  <cit>  has been recently demonstrated by clément and colleagues, who identified s. aureus residing in human nasal epithelial cells in vivo, a probable cause of recurrent rhinosinusitis infection  <cit> . this in vivo survival capacity was further documented in the same population and shown to constitute a significant risk factor for recurrent episodes of rhinosinusitis refractory to antimicrobial and surgical therapy  <cit> . similar behavior was also observed in an experimental model of mastitis  <cit> .

in our model, the presence of cells or the attachment of bacteria to a <dig> cells  showed limited impact on bacterial transcriptome. this observation is in accordance with previous reports from our group showing that no active bacterial process is require for internalization  <cit> . with respect to bacterial pathogenesis, this observation suggests that s. aureus internalization is probably not rare as it requires only a minimal number of bacterial factors  <cit> . in contrast to other microorganisms known to invade eukaryotic cells and rapidly divert cellular compounds and energy to actively multiply  <cit> , our study indicates that upon cellular internalization, s. aureus transiently shuts down most of its metabolic functions and adopts an apparent "dormant state" without extensively initiating classic starvation or stress process. these profound changes in the bacterial transcriptome affect approximately 40% of all putative orfs identified in the genomic sequence of the bacterium and appear related to an extensive adaptation to the new environment constituted by the intracellular compartment. the majority of genes involved in energy production  were drastically reduced after  <dig> h internalization. consequently, > 75% of s. aureus ribosomal proteins showed a significant down-regulation, which constitutes a common trait with streptococcal exposition to endothelial cell  <cit> , another gram positive pathogen able to invade non-phagocytic cells before inducing apoptosis  <cit> . for these  <dig> pathogens, metabolic and cellular division machineries appear strongly down-regulated rapidly after internalization  <cit> . this situation is markedly different from that observed in invasive intracellular pathogens such as salmonella  <cit> , shigella  <cit> , or pasteurella  <cit> , which show up-regulation of most cellular processes upon internalization and are able to multiply actively before disseminating to other cells  <cit> . in our model, a significant increase in colony forming unit counts was observed between  <dig> and  <dig> h of intracellular persistence. this cellular multiplication parallels up-regulation of lytm, as well as that of numerous amidases involved in cell-wall processing  <cit> . concurrently, a slight up-regulation of cell-wall and techoic acid synthesis genes was observed between these time points, suggesting evidence of intracellular replication or completion of cell division, as observed in the context of s. aureus phagocytosis by neutrophils  <cit> . this metabolic evolution was paralleled by a massive up-regulation of numerous transporters. in our study, more than  <dig> transporters, involved in inorganic ions, nucleotides or peptides, or urea were found significantly up-regulated. transporters involved in metabolic pathways contribute to the direct rerouting of cellular resources by the internalized bacterium. illustrative examples are the up-regulation of uhpt , allowing glucose-6-phosphate acquisition, as observed during internalization of other bacterial species  <cit>  or during in vitro  <cit>  or intracellular exposition of s. aureus to acidic environments  <cit> . s. aureus genome contains  <dig> putative iron transporters  <cit>  that are important mediators of bacterial virulence. iron transporters are typically up-regulated in various internalized invasive pathogens  <cit> . in our study, isdf, sa <dig> and particularly bitc, were drastically up-regulated in s. aureus, thus providing probably sufficient amounts of iron from the intracellular medium, whereas all genes composing the fhu operon, encoding ferric hydroxamate assimilation proteins were down-regulated, in accordance with their function of iron transporters under specific environmental conditions  <cit> .

intracellular survival can potentially expose the bacterium to cellular defense mechanisms such as oxygen radicals. in our study, the number of up-regulated genes involved in stress protection or bacterial defense revealed surprisingly low. except for soda and cysm, whose products protect bacterial cell against oxidative stress  <cit> , a majority of genes involved in oxidative stress response appeared down-regulated. this finding is markedly different than the behavior of shigella  <cit> , but consistent with previous reports about s. pneumoniae  <cit> . note however that experiments performed in a <dig> cells failed to detect production of reactive oxygen species upon bacterial uptake . internalized s. aureus appeared to solicit protective functions but in a different context than that requiring preservation of the cellular machinery integrity as described by voyish in the context of resistance to neutrophil phagocytosis  <cit> . in non-phagocytic cells, the expression of capsule operon, clp proteases family and chaperones, as well as their known regulators ctsr and sigb  <cit> , potentially conferring survival against toxic cellular metabolites was drastically down-regulated.

the expression of numerous bacterial virulence factors is modulated through complex networks of regulatory molecules including two-component systems and global regulators such as agr or sar. multiple regulatory pathways contributed not only to the rapid adaptation of the bacteria to environmental changes but also to the regulation of toxins or cell-surface components expression during bacterial growth-phases  <cit> . in our system, upon contact with cell monolayers, strain  <dig> was in early exponential phase of growth where agr activity is limited. following internalization and metabolic restart, general metabolic functions appeared up-regulated in the absence of agr induction. in addition, internalized bacteria showed an increase in expression of sars and svra simultaneously to a marked down-regulation of saers genes, which are important compounds known to modulate agr expression  <cit> . in parallel to a moderately increased expression of rnaiii, a compound known to induce agr expression in vitro, this regulation pattern results in the reduced expression of hla that potentially mediates apoptosis induction in some systems  <cit> . this uncoupling between agr and rnaiii expression has been previously observed in vivo in an experimental model of endocarditis  <cit> . the restricted level of hla expression suggests a different regulation behavior under these experimental conditions or the action of another unknown regulator. the latter hypothesis is further supported by the results of goerke  <cit> , who showed that mutation in agr and sar had no consequence for hla expression in vivo. this unknown target is probably not sigb, a regulator found drastically down-regulated upon internalization as well as the totality of related rsb partners in our model. sigb has been recently suggested as a potential partner involved in the persistence of scvs recovered from cystic fibrosis  <cit> . in our study, we failed to detect such scvs as s. aureus recovered after  <dig> weeks of internalization yielded significant hemolysis when plated on blood agar. however, this observation does not rule out the emergence of scvs in our model as this phenotype appears able to revert spontaneously  <cit> . these observations are directly related to the absence of cytotoxicity on a <dig> cells even after two weeks of infection, an observation common between our study and previous work using scvs  <cit> .

in contrast to the behavior of internalized scvs, bantel and colleagues reported 6850-evoked induction of apoptosis using jurkat t cells  <cit> , which is consistent with our control assays confirming that strain  <dig> was able of provoking cytotoxic effects. in addition, qazi and colleagues reported the induction of agr and bacterial escape from endosomal vesicles rapidly after internalization using s. aureus rn <dig> and mac-t  <cit> . on the contrary, kahl reported that i) rifampicin-treated bacteria failed to induce apoptosis and that ii) cowan i -a strain that failed to multiply in epithelial cells- does not show appreciable cytotoxic effects  <cit> . these observations are important concerning s. aureus pathogenicity and suggest that certain combinations of host cells and bacteria can result in different biological outcomes. altogether, results obtained with different models strongly suggest that the internalization of s. aureus is a key factor in chronic infections, as intracellular survival occurs in cells showing a long lifespan such as fibroblasts or epithelial cells. s. aureus intracellular survival appears related to its capability to adopt a discrete behavior instead of actively duplicating. s. aureus then benefits from natural or programmed cell death to re-emerge and trigger another episode of infection, leading to chronicity.

CONCLUSIONS
internalization of s. aureus in non-phagocytic cells explaining its resistance properties against cellular or humoral host defenses is an attractive hypothesis relying on its particular ability to generate chronic diseases. in our model of cellular persistence, s. aureus strain  <dig> is able to reside intracellularly for prolonged period of time. microarray experiments provide a global picture of genes possibly involved in s. aureus pathogenesis, and in particular, the capacity of the bacterium to diminish most of its metabolic functions, despite soliciting numerous transporters allowing maintenance of vital functions but limiting its multiplication. limited bacterial growth and expression of regulators of virulence factors leads to a finely controlled expression of cell-active toxins insuring intracellular bacterial survival. global bacterial responses upon internalization appears complex but in accordance with the capacity of the bacterium to reside intracellularly. finally, the study has uncovered dozens of potential targets for anti-infective therapeutics.
