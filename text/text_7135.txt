BACKGROUND
dna is the conduit for the transmission of genetic information between generations of a species  <cit> . the linear sequence of dna is labile and can be altered by both intracellular and extracellular sources in a variety of ways. for example, within a cell errors by replication machinery can lead to point mutations while the physical stresses of replication can fracture strands of dna. external sources can mutate dna by alkylating single strands, causing interstrand crosslinks, or even breaking strands apart, resulting in the loss of some bases upon ligation  <cit> .

one of a cell's most crucial tasks is maintaining the integrity of genetic information from one generation to the next  <cit> . although some mutations are beneficial in the long term by allowing for adaptation to changing environments via natural selection, most mutations are detrimental and can lead to consequences as serious as cell death or transformation; the correlation between mutagenic activity and carcinogenic activity is approximately 90%  <cit> . this high correlation has increased interest in identifying causes of dna damage and the effects of this damage on the cellular environment with the hopes of both preventing cancer and developing better chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of existing cancerous cells  <cit> .

saccharomyces cerevisiae is commonly used as a model organism for studying the dna damage response because its genome is well-annotated and the cells are easily cultured and genetically manipulated. furthermore, because yeasts are eukaryotic, the gene regulation and biochemical pathways involved in responding to dna damage are expected to be similar to, although perhaps simpler than, those of higher organisms. indeed, the basic cellular responses to dna damage have been shown to be similar in yeast and humans  <cit> . many dna damage sensory and repair mechanisms in humans have been identified from their homology to similar mechanisms in yeast  <cit> .

the study of the dna damage response in yeast has uncovered a broad variety of mechanisms used by the cells to sense and repair the damage. when cells sense a defect in their dna, several signal transduction pathways are induced which in turn activate various checkpoints that cause cell-cycle arrest at the g <dig>  s, or g <dig> phases until the defect can be repaired  <cit> . these signal transduction pathways regulate genome-wide expression patterns, causing hundreds of genes to be induced or repressed in direct response to the perceived damage  <cit> . many of the induced genes are also upregulated in response to cell cycle arrest in stationary phase or in response to general cell stresses, indicating that dna damage response pathways in yeast overlap with other cell cycle pathways  <cit> . once cell division is arrested, repairs can be made in a variety of ways depending on the type of damage which has occurred. single-strand lesions can be repaired by base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, or mismatch repair using the non-altered strand as a template, while double-strand breaks are repaired by homologous recombination or non-homologous end joining  <cit> .

to better define the cellular pathways involved in the recognition and repair of dna damage, it is important to identify the global set of genes induced or repressed in response to the damage. these genes have been identified in a number of ways. traditionally, pools of mutants were screened for sensitivity to various dna damaging agents, enabling the proposal of epistasis groups based on common responses  <cit> . in the last  <dig> years, the proliferation of spotted and oligonucleotide microarrays have enabled genome-wide profiling in response to multiple dna damaging agents  <cit> . these types of studies identified hundreds of genes not previously known to be modulated in response to dna damage. recently the two approaches have been combined by culture of gene deletion mutant strains tagged with unique identification sequences in the presence of a variety of dna damaging agents, followed by pcr amplification and microarray hybridization of the identification sequences to assess the relative fitness level of each strain as a result of the exposure  <cit> . with each new study, genes not previously known to be regulated by dna damage are identified, suggesting that there are additional genes and pathways whose control is crucial in dna damage response yet to be distinguished.

in this study, we identified genes involved in the transcriptional response to dna damage based on variation in expression upon exposure to two representative dna damaging agents, methylmethane sulfonate  and ionizing gamma radiation , over three orders of magnitude of agent dose. mms is a dna alkylating agent known to methylate guanine residues at the n- <dig> position  <cit> . while this methylation is often tolerable to the cells, mms can also methylate guanine at the o- <dig> position or adenine at the n- <dig> site  <cit> . these latter lesions inhibit dna synthesis and must be repaired for replication to properly occur  <cit> . ionizing radiation induces multiple types of dna damage, but double strand breaks are considered to be the most lethal  <cit> . mms generally produces single-strand lesions which inhibit dna replication at the s phase checkpoint, while double-strand breaks caused by γ-ray inhibit the g2/m checkpoint  <cit> . using spotted microarrays, gasch et al. performed studies where s. cerevisiae cells were cultured in the presence of  <dig> % mms and the transcriptional response was assessed at multiple timepoints up to  <dig> min  <cit> . jelinsky et al. performed a similar work using oligonucleotide arrays to monitor the transcriptional response of s. cerevisiae to  <dig> % mms at three timepoints up to  <dig> min  <cit> . both groups identified clusters of genes co-regulated temporally in response to mms.

collectively, studies of the s. cerevisiae transcriptional response to mms have reported results for multiple mms doses. jelinsky et al. reported that  <dig> genes showed a significant transcriptional modulation in response to  <dig> % mms for one hr  <cit> , while gasch et al. reported that more than  <dig> genes showed a significant change in transcription levels when exposed to  <dig> % mms for two hr  <cit> . more recently, using oligonucleotide arrays, caba et al. identified  <dig>  genes with a significant transcriptional response to  <dig> % mms for two hr  <cit> . these results suggest a dose-dependent element to the transcriptional response of s. cerevisiae to mms, although yeast strains and culture conditions varied in these studies. jelinsky et al. did examine multiple doses and reported a total of  <dig>  genes responding to at least one of three doses; however, these doses varied by less than one order of magnitude  <cit> .

similarly, jelinsky et al. observed  <dig> genes with a significant transcriptional response to  <dig> gy of gamma irradiation  <cit> . gasch et al. reported over  <dig> genes whose expression changed as a result of exposure to  <dig> gy of gamma irradiation  <cit> . de sanctis et al. used spotted microarrays to compare the global transcriptional responses of wild-type and rad <dig> strains to ionizing radiation administered in doses of  <dig>  gy,  <dig> gy,  <dig> gy,  <dig> gy, and  <dig> gy  <cit> . they observed  <dig> genes with a 2-fold or more change in transcription level in response to  <dig> gy  and  <dig> genes with a 2-fold or more change in transcription level in response to  <dig> gy. recently, mercier et al. used spotted microarrays to identify approximately  <dig> genes with a significant change in transcription level after exposure to  <dig> gy of ionizing radiation  <cit> . in this work, we used oligonucleotide microarrays to quantify the transcriptional response of s. cerevisiae cells to multiple doses, varying over three orders of magnitude, of mms and γ-ray to show how the global response varies with dose and to identify sets of genes that respond similarly to dose changes.

RESULTS
hierarchical clustering of array data
hierarchical clustering illustrating the transcriptional response of s. cerevisiae to mms and γ-ray is shown in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  figure  <dig> shows all of the genes with a significant response to at least one dose of mms and/or γ-ray, and figure  <dig> shows a venn diagram containing the number of genes regulated by each type and dose of genotoxicity. figure  <dig> highlights four clusters found in figure  <dig> that have notable responses to both mms and γ-ray. figure  <dig> illustrates a subset of genes that responded to only one dose of γ-ray. figure 5-a contains only those genes with a significant transcriptional response to at least one dose of mms , and figure 5-b contains genes with a significant response to at least one dose of γ-ray. figure  <dig> contains clusters from figure  <dig> in which a dose-dependent response to either mms or γ-ray was observed.

global transcriptional response to mms and γ-ray
for further clarity, a venn diagram  is presented to illustrate the number of genes modulated by at least  3-fold to each dna damaging agent , each dose of mms , and each dose of γ-ray .

clusters responsive to mms and γ-ray
in addition to merely identifying genes that were modulated in response to mms and/or γ-ray, we sought to identify clusters of genes that exhibited similar or opposite dose dependent responses to both mms and γ-ray. clustering diagrams of four clusters  highlighted in figure  <dig> are shown in figure  <dig> 

cluster 3-a contains  <dig> genes, all of which have been shown to play a role in mother-daughter cell separation and all of which were down-regulated in response to all doses of mms and γ-ray. one of these genes is cts <dig>  a chitinase required for cell separation after mitosis, whose transcription is induced during the late m and early g <dig> stages of the cell cycle  <cit> . microarray analysis of s. cerevisiae exposed to 5-fluorocytosine, an inhibitor of dna synthesis, also identified down-regulation of cts <dig>  <cit> . dse <dig> is involved in the separation of daughter cells from mother cells by degrading the cell wall from the daughter side  <cit> . ash <dig> localizes in daughter cells during mitosis and inhibits the transcription of ho, preventing the daughter cells from changing mating types  <cit> . the fact that the transcription factor ash <dig> was downregulated after dna damage exposure correlates well with observations of workman et al. that ash1p binds more genes in the absence of mms than when mms is present  <cit> . the co-regulation of these  <dig> genes implies that the cell may be actively trying to stop transmission of damaged dna to daughter cells by inhibiting cell division.

cluster 3-b contains  <dig> genes repressed in response to mms and induced by γ-ray exposure. fas <dig> is involved in the synthesis of fatty acids  <cit> . a third gene with similar behavior but excluded from this cluster due to higher than acceptable fdr values, hmg <dig>  catalyzes the rate-limiting step in sterol biosynthesis  <cit> . gasch et al. observed the repression of genes responsible for ergosterol synthesis in response to mms  <cit> , while de sanctis et al. noted many of these same genes were induced in response to low doses of ionizing radiation, approximately  <dig> gy or less  <cit> .

cluster 3-c contains  <dig> genes induced in response to mms and repressed in response to γ-ray. one of the genes in this cluster, ydl016c, is a hypothetical orf. the other gene, cha <dig>  is a transcription factor for cha <dig>  in the presence of serine or threonine as the sole nitrogen source, cha <dig> is actively transcribed, but its expression is not detectable when cells are grown in the presence of other nitrogen sources such as ammonium  <cit> . a recent study by yang et al. suggests cha <dig> may play a role in cell-cycle regulation  <cit>  as one of four putative interaction partners of the two forkhead transcription factors, fkh <dig> and fkh <dig>  which are involved in cell-cycle regulation and mitotic exit and seem to play a role in yeast dimorphism  <cit> . this is particularly interesting since  <dig> of the genes clustered in figure  <dig>  play a role in regulating pseudohyphal growth in s. cerevisiae.

the cluster highlighted in figure 3-d is composed of  <dig> genes whose transcription is induced upon exposure to all doses of mms and γ-ray used in this study. several of the genes in this cluster are known to be involved in cellular responses to stress or dna damage. gad <dig> has been shown to mediate resistance to oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide and diamide  <cit> , and ntg <dig> has also been identified as crucial in repairing oxidative stress in dna  <cit> . rad <dig> is part of the nuclear excision repair pathway and has been shown to be involved in double-strand break repair in the fission yeast, schizosaccharomyces pombe, suggesting an explanation for its induction in response to γ-ray  <cit> . nej <dig> is involved in the regulation of non-homologous end joining repair in response to double-strand breaks  <cit> . a potential reason for nej <dig> induction by mms may involve creation of single-strand breaks following excision repair of methylated bases. when the replication fork confronts these breaks, double-strand breaks can be caused by the forces of replication  <cit> , which could elicit a partial transcriptional response in genes responsible for repairing double-strand breaks. this could also address induction of rad <dig>  known to be crucial in homologous recombination for the repair of double-strand breaks  <cit> , in response to mms. the genes shown in this cluster suggest there is some overlap of dna-damage repair pathways in sensing and responding to damage induced by mms and γ-ray, as members of the base excision repair pathway, nucleotide excision repair pathway, non-homologous end joining pathway, and homologous recombination pathway were all induced.

to gain additional insight into the coregulation of cluster 3-d, the meme system was used to identify highly conserved motifs within the regions  <dig> base pairs upstream from all of the genes in the cluster  <cit> . thirty seven of the genes contained a  <dig> bp region with an e-value of  <dig>  . to our knowledge, this sequence  has not been shown to be a transcription factor binding site in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . although these  <dig> genes are involved in a wide variety of biological processes, it is possible that this conserved motif comprises or contains a site to which a transcription factor induced by dna-damage can bind and simultaneously regulate several genes induced by both mms and γ-ray, but clearly further experiments are required to prove this notion. a comparison of this putative transcription factor binding site with the jaspar database showed closest homology with a mouse pancreatic development transcriptional repressor   <cit>  and a human nuclear receptor ligand activated transcription factor   <cit> .

genes modulated by only one dose of γ-ray
during analysis of the dose dependent transcriptional response to mms and γ-ray, we sought to identify genes whose transcription was only modulated in response to a single dose of damaging agent. while all of the genes found to respond to only one dose of mms responded only to the highest dose,  <dig> genes responded to only one of the γ-ray doses tested and interestingly some responded only to the lowest or to the intermediate dose .

expression of  <dig> genes was induced by a single γ-ray dose, with perhaps the most interesting being uga <dig>  uga <dig> is a γ-aminobutyrate transaminase that along with gad <dig>  discussed earlier, helps regulate the tolerance of cells to oxidative stresses  <cit> . its induction at the low dose of  <dig> gy indicates the sensitivity of this particular stress response in s. cerevisiae. many more genes,  <dig>  were repressed at only one dose of γ-ray. at the lowest dose tested,  <dig> genes were repressed, including  <dig> involved in protein synthesis regulation . this down-regulation is consistent with features of the environmental stress response in yeast  <cit> . another interesting gene in this cluster is eco <dig>  which is required for cohesion of sister chromatids during dna replication, a necessity for repair of double-strand breaks caused by replication  <cit> . the fact that  <dig> genes were induced or repressed at only one dose of mms or γ-ray illustrates one benefit of analyzing genome-wide transcriptional changes to external stresses at multiple doses.

the meme system was used to identify conserved motifs within the clusters shown in figure  <dig>  all  <dig> of the genes induced by  <dig> gy of γ-ray conserved a similar  <dig> bp sequence  with an e-value of  <dig> . this motif contains a reported binding site of azf1p, tttttctt  <cit> . azf1p is a transcription factor shown to regulate cell cycle genes in response to dna damage caused by mms  <cit> . while azf1p is not known to regulate all of the genes in this cluster, it is possible that azf1p is involved in regulating these genes in response to dna damage caused by γ-ray, but further experimentation is necessary to test this relationship. a comparison of this putative transcription factor binding site with the jaspar database showed closest homology with a human   <cit>  and a rat  forkhead transcription factor  <cit> .

global transcriptional response to either mms or γ-ray
to identify genes that were coregulated at all doses of either mms or γ-ray, the genes were reclustered such that mms and γ-ray exposure were considered separately  . all of the genes in each cluster in figure  <dig> had at least one transcriptional fold change of  <dig> or more. one of the most visually evident differences between figure 5-a and 5-b is the relative number of genes induced or repressed by mms and γ-ray. of the  <dig> genes modulated by mms ,  <dig>  are induced . of the  <dig> genes induced or repressed by γ-ray,  <dig>  are induced. this suggests that cells modulate entire cellular processes differently based on the type of damage occurring. for example, mms causes an increased repression of cellular transport and metabolism genes, while γ-ray causes an increased repression of protein regulation and translation genes .

comparing genes with roles in dna replication/repair and cell-cycle progression and how they were differentially modulated by mms and γ-ray provides insight into cell responses to these agents. in the cluster shown in figure  <dig>  a total of  <dig> genes fell into the dna replication/repair and cell-cycle progression category,  <dig> of which are nucleotide excision repair pathway genes. in the mms cluster , a total of  <dig> genes fell into this category, and all  <dig> nucleotide excision repair pathway genes are present. in the γ-ray cluster ,  <dig> genes fell into the dna replication/repair and cell-cycle progression category, but only one of the nucleotide excision repair genes, rad <dig>  was significantly modulated. this variation suggests that, as would be expected, the nucleotide excision repair pathway is much more active in response to mms than γ-ray.

an interesting subset of the genes involved in cellular metabolic processes includes  <dig> genes involved in ergosterol synthesis – erg <dig>  erg <dig>  erg <dig>  erg <dig>  erg <dig>  erg <dig>  erg <dig>  and mvd <dig>  these genes all appear in the mms and γ-ray cluster  and all  <dig> also appear in the mms cluster , but none are present in the γ-ray cluster , suggesting a link between the mms response and ergosterol synthesis. gasch et al. previously noted four of these eight genes  were down-regulated in response to  <dig> % mms  <cit> . they attributed this regulation to the fact that many of these genes are regulated by hap1p and suggested that hap1p could be methylated by mms. jelinsky and samson reported the repression of erg <dig>  a sterol desaturase, and sur <dig>  a sterol isomerase, upon exposure to  <dig> % mms  <cit> .

considering the role of dap <dig> offers additional insight into the link between ergosterol synthesis and the mms response. hand et al. found that dap <dig> strains were extremely sensitive to mms, but still underwent cell cycle arrest similar to wild type cells  <cit> . they proposed that dap <dig> is involved in the response to mms, but not in triggering cell-cycle arrest. dap <dig> is also required for normal ergosterol levels in s. cerevisiae; however dap <dig> strains did not possess increased membrane permeability despite lower levels of ergosterol  <cit> . this demonstrated that the mms sensitivity of dap <dig> was not due to a compromised membrane allowing more mms inside the cell, but rather some other pathway interactions within the cell. the down-regulation of ergosterol synthesis genes in response to mms may allow cells to divert energy from normal ergosterol synthesis levels to fighting the effects of mms. an alternative explanation could be that the lack of cell division due to cell-cycle arrest has lessened the need for ergosterol. neither of these explanations, however, explains why these genes are down regulated in response to mms but not γ-ray.

clusters with dose-dependent responses to mms or γ-ray
to illustrate the dose-dependent response of certain genes to either mms or γ-ray, six smaller clusters from figure  <dig> in which one of three specific dose-dependent responses was observed: monotonically increasing, monotonically decreasing, or biphasic  were identified and are presented in figure  <dig> 

cluster 6-a contains  <dig> genes which exhibit monotonically increasing expression in response to mms: the genes are induced at all doses of mms tested and the level of induction increases with mms dose. four of the genes in this cluster are directly involved in sensing or repairing dna damage – mag <dig>  hsm <dig>  yim <dig>  and ddr <dig>  hsm <dig> is involved in dna mismatch repair in slowly dividing cells  <cit> , yim <dig> is believed to be involved in the cellular response to dna-damaging agents  <cit> , and ddr <dig> is induced in response to heat shock or dna-lesion producing treatments  <cit> . additionally, ten other genes  involved in stress response were also monotonically induced by escalating mms concentrations. yap <dig> is particularly intriguing because it is considered to be the primary regulator of the oxidative stress response  <cit> , and it serves as a transcription factor for multiple genes and other transcription factors during the mms response  <cit> . pre <dig> has recently been shown to be modulated in response to mms by the transcription factor swi6p  <cit> . another interesting feature of cluster a is that  <dig> of the genes are involved in protein ubiquitination and/or catabolism. mms induction of protein degradation has been observed in yeast and higher organisms  <cit>  and may be related to the degradation of methylated proteins.

cluster 6-b contains  <dig> genes which exhibit monotonically decreasing repression with increasing mms concentration. the largest subset within this cluster is a group of  <dig> genes  involved in protein synthesis or transport. ptr <dig> has been shown to be down-regulated as part of the stress response initiated by mms exposure  <cit> . this correlates well with the observation stated earlier: in response to environmental stress, many genes involved in protein synthesis and metabolism in s. cerevisiae are repressed  <cit> .

the meme system was used to identify conserved motifs within cluster 6-b. thirteen of the genes in this cluster conserved a  <dig> bp region  with an e-value of  <dig>  e- <dig>  within this motif is a highly conserved  <dig> bp region proposed to be a binding site for cha4p   <cit> . however, to date cha4p has not been shown to regulate any of the genes in this cluster  <cit> , and cha <dig> expression is upregulated at all mms doses tested in this study . a comparison of this putative transcription factor binding site with the jaspar database showed closest homology with a mouse pancreatic development transcriptional repressor  <cit>  and a human zinc finger transcription factor involved in the differentiation response to ras in human carcinomas   <cit> .

cluster 6-c, a group of four genes with a biphasic induction in response to mms treatment, is very intriguing. all of the genes in this cluster are involved in the mec1p kinase pathway known to respond to dna damage caused by mms. ribonucleotide reductase is an enzyme that consists of four subunits, two large  and two small , and catalyzes the rate-limiting step of dntp synthesis  <cit> . an increase in dntp levels is often associated with dna damage and is considered necessary for dna repair and resumption of normal transcription  <cit> . when a cell senses genotoxicity or a stalled replication fork, the signal is transduced through the kinase checkpoint mec1p, leading to the activation of the kinases rad53p and dun1p  <cit> . dun1p plays a role in the phosphorylation and eventual degradation of sml1p, an inhibitor of rnr gene transcription  <cit> . when sml1p is destroyed, rnr genes are transcribed and cellular dntp levels rise, leading to a resumption of dna synthesis. hug <dig>  also transcribed in a kinase checkpoint dependent manner, is downstream from dun <dig> and thought to play a role in the recovery from the transcriptional response to dna damage and cell-cycle arrest  <cit> . the biphasic induction of dun <dig>  rnr <dig>  rnr <dig>  and hug <dig> was unexpected and may suggest that the mec1p pathway is eventually scaled back or even shut off at high doses of mms. rnr <dig> and rnr <dig> were also biphasically induced in response to mms but were excluded from clustering analyses because of prohibitive fdr analysis results.

there are several possibilities for the decreased induction of genes involved in the mec1p pathway at the highest mms doses. first, there may be alternative cellular responses to different mms doses. gasch et al. reported that mec <dig> mutants show an induction of rnr <dig>  rnr <dig>  and dun <dig> in response to dna damage, although the response is muted, indicating there may be other mechanisms to derepress the rnr genes  <cit> . more recently, dubacq and coworkers described a snf1p kinase directed pathway activated in response to three dna-damaging agents that cause stalled replication forks independently of and in parallel to the mec <dig> pathway  <cit> . they described snf <dig> mutants that were sensitive to hydroxyurea, mms , and cadmium ions but not to uv radiation, γ-ray, hydrogen peroxide, camptothecin, and phleomycin. based on these results, the activity of the snf1p kinase mediated pathway in response to higher doses of mms warrants further study.

a second possibility addressing the biphasic response is that mms may methylate a member of the mec1p pathway, leading to its inactivation or destruction. in our experiments, rad <dig> showed a monotonically increasing induction in response to mms treatments above  <dig> %, although it was excluded from our clustering analysis as a result of fdr filtering. this fact in conjunction with the cluster shown in figure 6-c suggests the possibility of a failure in the mec1p pathway between rad <dig> and dun <dig>  this could have been caused by methylation of a protein with susceptibility to mms at high doses that was degraded in response to its alkylation by mms effectively creating a roadblock in the dna-damage response.

a final possibility, though perhaps less likely, it that the rnr enzyme itself is methylated by mms, leading to its inability to catalyze dntp synthesis. although mms has been shown to increase dntp levels at low doses  <cit> , it is possible that rnr is alkylated at higher doses since rnr has an active cysteine residue that is involved in the catalysis of dntp synthesis  <cit> . once a minimum mms concentration threshold is passed, rnr could be rendered incapable of catalyzing dntp synthesis and dntp levels in the cell would drop. this drop in dntp concentration could be sensed by the cell and mistakenly interpreted as a completion of dna synthesis, thus inactivating the mec1p kinase pathway.

cluster 6-d contains  <dig> genes that are induced in a monotonically increasing manner in response to γ-ray. prm <dig> has been shown to be induced in response to compromised cell wall integrity  <cit> . the responses of rnr <dig>  rnr <dig>  and hug <dig> shown in this cluster are very interesting. all of these genes were induced at all doses of γ-ray, with the highest induction coming at the highest dose. rnr <dig> and rnr <dig> are also achieve maximum induction by γ-ray at the highest dose, but were excluded from this clustering analysis by statistical filtering. this behavior offers an interesting contrast to the biphasic response these genes exhibited upon mms exposure.

the final two clusters shown in figure  <dig>  both show a biphasic response to γ-ray. the three genes in 6-e are repressed, while the five genes in cluster 6-f are biphasically induced by γ-ray. an interesting member of this cluster is rad <dig>  which functions in the repair of double strand breaks that lack overlapping end sequences  <cit> .

to analyze the types of genes modulated in response to the induced stresses, genes were divided into categories according to the go annotation  <cit>  of the biological processes in which they are known to be involved . figure 7-a contains all  <dig> genes induced or repressed in response to mms or γ-ray. figure 7-b and 7-c contain the  <dig> genes responsive to at least one dose of mms and  <dig> genes responsive to at least one dose of γ-ray, respectively. a comparison of the three panels illustrates how the transcriptional response of s. cerevisiae apparently varies with the source of dna damage.

approximately 25% of genes responding to either mms or γ-ray were classified as biological process unknown . this number is reasonable considering 34% of s. cerevisiae predicted orfs are currently unverified  <cit> . within this category, 67% of the modulated genes were upregulated.

a second group of genes in figure 7-a, approximately 9%, was composed of genes involved in dna synthesis and repair or cell-cycle progression. sixty-five percent of these genes were upregulated in response to dna damage. of the  <dig> genes classified as dna synthesis and repair or cell-cycle progression genes,  <dig> are specifically involved in dna damage repair, including mag <dig> which was highly induced in response to mms and is known to be a member of the base excision repair pathway involved in the repair of n7-alkylguanines, among the deleterious alkylations caused by mms  <cit> . rad <dig> and rad <dig>  which encode two parts of a heterotrimeric complex that removes damaged oligonucleotides during nucleotide excision repair  <cit> , were also induced in response to mms. rnr <dig> and rnr <dig> were highly induced in response to γ-ray; these genes have been shown to be transcriptionally induced in response to hydroxyurea and ionizing radiation  <cit> . a second subset of the dna synthesis and repair or cell-cycle progression genes includes  <dig> genes  that function in cell-cycle checkpoints, such as cdc <dig>  hrt <dig>  and ptk <dig>  all involved in the g1/s transition of the cell cycle. this regulation presumably halts cell cycle progression, preventing the synthesis of damaged dna.

a third major category of genes whose expression changes upon mms or γ-ray exposure includes those involved in rna regulation and transcription. of the  <dig> genes in this category,  <dig> were induced and  <dig> were repressed. many of these genes are involved in mrna catabolism, export from the nucleus, or polyadenylation. for example, hrp <dig> and clp <dig>  both induced in response to mms, are subunits of cleavage factor i, required for the cleavage and polyadenylation of 3' mrna ends  <cit> . other rna regulation and transcription genes modulated in response to mms and γ-ray include those involved in the positive and negative rna polymerase ii promoter regulators, spliceosome activity, and ribosome synthesis. the modulation of these genes correlates well with the observation that the transcriptional response of genes involved in cell growth-related processes are regulated by the environmental stress response  <cit> .

another category of genes modulated by mms and γ-ray includes genes involved in protein regulation and translation, accounting for 21% of the genes in figure 7-a. seventy-three percent of the genes in this category were induced. in response to environmental stress, expression many genes involved in protein synthesis and metabolism in s. cerevisiae changes, presumably to allow the cell to conserve energy  <cit> .

finally, a group of  <dig> genes involved in the response to various general cell stresses are modulated upon exposure to mms and/or γ-ray.  <dig> of these genes were induced by more than  <dig> fold upon exposure to dna damage. this group includes genes that respond to drugs, osmotic stress, various metal ions, and oxidative stress, indicating the regulation of many genes involved in general stress response pathways.

CONCLUSIONS
the global transcriptional response of s. cerevisiae as a function of dose of dna-damaging agent was measured by exposing s. cerevisiae cells to multiple concentrations, varying over  <dig> orders of magnitude, of two representative dna-damaging agents, mms and γ-ray, and hybridizing their crna to oligonucleotide microarrays containing over  <dig>  hypothetical and known s. cerevisiae orfs. hierarchical clustering of genes with a statistically significant change in transcription enabled the identification of several clusters of coregulated genes whose responses varied with dna damaging agent dose. our study showed many genes involved in sensing and repairing dna damage are regulated by both mms and γ-ray exposure and suggests interconnection between the pathways that respond to various types of dna damage. there were differences in the responses as well. for example,  <dig> genes involved in the ergosterol synthesis pathway were down-regulated in response to mms, but not significantly modulated by γ-ray exposure, verifying earlier observations  <cit> . furthermore, we identified  <dig> genes which responded to only one dose of γ-ray, highlighting one benefit of measuring the transcriptional response to external stresses over multiple doses. meme analysis identified conserved motifs upstream of multiple genes in these clusters, potentially signifying common regulatory elements.

further analysis revealed  <dig> clusters of genes with a dose-dependent response to either mms or γ-ray. clusters were identified based on their mode of response, either monotonically increasing, monotonically decreasing, or biphasic . analyzing genome-wide transcriptional changes to multiple doses of external stresses enables the identification of cellular responses that are modulated by extent of damage, providing new insights into how a cell deals with genotoxicity. perhaps the most interesting example of this was a cluster that contained  <dig> genes  that are members of the mec1p kinase pathway known to respond to mms induced damage, presumably due to stalled dna replication forks. these genes showed a biphasic induction in response to mms treatment, while many of the same genes, rnr <dig>  rnr <dig>  and hug <dig>  were monotonically increasingly induced by γ-ray.
