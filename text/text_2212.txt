BACKGROUND
the availability of an increasing number of sequenced genomes has generated the need for the development of efficient methods that will enable functional analysis of newly identified genes. the construction of knockout mutants by gene replacement has traditionally been a time consuming process because it requires several subcloning steps. a more time efficient mutagenesis method that does not require cloning was developed recently and has been used in various bacteria and fungi  <cit> . the methodology was first described in e. coli  <cit>  and aspergillus nidulans  <cit> ; and subsequently applied successfully to yersinia  <cit> , salmonella  <cit> , shigella  <cit>  and serratia  <cit> .

the procedure involves the deletion of chromosomal genes via homologous recombination between the chromosomal region of interest and a polymerase chain reaction -product that contains an antibiotic cassette flanked by a region of homology with the target dna. in e. coli, a linear dna is obtained in a 1-step pcr using primers that contain a region that is homologous with a 36-nucleotide  region of the target gene. an efficient recombination between the pcr product and the chromosome is achieved by induction of the lambda phage red operon. the red operon encodes the nuclease inhibitor redγ and the site specific recombinases redα and redβ, which mediate homologous recombination  <cit> . although molecular biology techniques used in e. coli are often applicable to other bacteria, adaptations are frequently required. for example in yersinia pseudotuberculosis, 55-nt homology extensions were generally not sufficient to allow recombination, while y. pseudotuberculosis pcr products with extensions of approximately 500-nt, generated using a 3-step pcr procedure, could trigger reproducibly gene disruption  <cit> .

here we describe an adaptation of the lambda red-based methodology for use with p. aeruginosa, in which chromosomal single gene deletions were generated using a 3-step pcr product containing 600- to 400-nt flanking regions that are homologous to the target sequence. we further examined the feasibility of using 1-step pcr product with only 100-nt homology extension for obtaining mutants. finally we tested the ability of this method to delete large chromosomal regions.

RESULTS
gene disruption using a 3-step pcr product
the mutagenesis was carried out by electroporating a polymerase chain reaction -product that contains an antibiotic cassette flanked by sequences homologous to the targeted dna into a strain expressing the lambda red operon. the presence of the specific pcr product promotes the deletion of the chromosomally located targeted region via homologous recombination between the genomic region and the flanking sequences of the pcr product. in order to use this system in p. aeruginosa, we first cloned the lambda red operon into the pucp <dig> vector. we also cloned the sacb gene into this vector to enable a rapid cure of the plasmid following mutagenesis. the generated vector is called pucp18-reds  . initially, the pqsc gene was selected for knockout because the mutant phenotype can be differentiated from the wild-type strain by its inability to produce the pseudomonas aeruginosa blue pigmented phenazine, pyocyanin, lack of which results in a yellowish culture . we used a 3-step pcr procedure to generate a fragment containing the kanamycin resistance cassette flanked by regions surrounding the pqsc gene . in the first step, p. aeruginosa genomic dna was used to amplify the upstream and downstream regions of the target sequence with primers fuppqsc/ruppqsc-kan and fdownpqsc-kan/rdownpqsc . in each pair, one primer contains at its 5' end a  <dig> bp-region homologous to the kanamycin cassette. simultaneously, the puc4k plasmid was used to amplify the kanamycin resistance gene. in the second step, the three fragments and primers fuppqsc/rdownpqsc were mixed and a product containing the upstream, kan and downstream regions was obtained. the third step is performed with primers fuppqsc/rdownpqsc to obtain a large quantity of pcr product.

we first assessed whether flanking regions of ~600-nt were sufficient to enable homologous recombination between the target gene and the pcr product, as this is generally sufficient when a typical suicide vector is used. primers fuppqsc/ruppqsc-kan and fdownpqsc-kan/rdownpqsc were designed to amplify regions 651-nt upstream and 610-nt downstream of pqsc, and to leave intact the 5' and 3' ends of the gene in the resulting recombinant mutant . the  <dig>  kb pcr fragment obtained was electroporated into pa14/pucp18-reds previously induced by arabinose for the expression of the lambda red proteins. aliquots of  <dig> or  <dig> μg of electroporated dna allowed the selection of 10– <dig> kmr recombinants; that colony yield was approximately doubled when  <dig> μg of dna was used. all kmr colonies obtained were analyzed by assessing their ability to produce pyocyanin. approximately 80% of the colonies potentially carried the insertion, as revealed by their inability to produce pyocyanin . the correct integration of the kanamycin cassette was then confirmed by pcr in five independent colonies. figure 3a shows results obtained for one representative Δpqsc recombinant. a pcr product of  <dig> bp was obtained using primers fupout-pqsc/rinkan  and the mutant genomic dna as template, while no pcr product was obtained when the wild type genomic dna was used. in addition when the wild type and Δpqsc genomic dna were used as template, primers fupout-pqsc/rdownout-pqsc  amplified a product of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp  respectively . the correct and unique insertion of the kanamycin resistance cassette was verified by southern. hindiii-digested genomic dna of three independent colonies was hybridized with the 5' end of the kanamycin cassette, and only one band of  <dig> bp was obtained confirming that the cassette was inserted into pqsc . finally, to ensure inclusion of proper borders in the inserted kanamycin cassette, 700-bp regions upstream and downstream of the cassette were sequenced. the sequences indicated proper insertion of the cassette and that no mutations were incorporated during the 3-step pcr procedure as the flanking sequences were identical to the original.

using 3-step pcr, we also successfully obtained two supplementary mutants: Δlasr and Δkynbu. the Δlasr mutant was generated using 490-nt upstream and 445-nt downstream flanking homologous regions resulting in the replacement of  <dig> bp of lasr by the kanamycin cassette. as expected the lasr mutant generated was defected in pyocyanin production . five independent colonies were analyzed and the correct insertion was confirmed in all five colonies using primers fupout-lasr/rinkan and fupout-lasr/rdownout-lasr . the Δkynbu mutant was generated in both wild type and trpe-phnab- backgrounds using 471-nt upstream and 419-nt downstream flanking homologous regions. in these mutants  <dig> bp region of kynbu was replaced by the  <dig> bp in length kanamycin cassette. the trpe-phnab-Δkynbu mutants were functionally validated also using pyocyanin as readout. in fact, p. aeruginosa is unable to produce pyocyanin if the bacterium is impaired in its capacity to synthesize 4-hydroxyl-quinolines . recently it was reported that two distinct pathways supply anthranilate as the precursor of haqs  <cit> . anthranilate can be either derived from the conversion of chorismate to anthranilate by an anthranilate synthase: trpeg and phnab; or produced by the degradation of tryptophan through the kynurenine pathway: kynbu. while kynbu and trpe-phnab- mutants were still able to produce pyocyanin in rich medium  due to the fact that the anthranilate or kynurenine pathways supplied anthranilate respectively, no trace of pyocyanin was present in any trpephnab-Δkynbu recombinants tested . also, dna amplification was performed in five independent Δkynbu and trpephnab-Δkynbu colonies using primer pairs fupout-kynbu/rinkan and fupout-kynbu/rdownout-kynbu  and confirmed the insertion of the kanamycin cassette in all five Δkynbu and trpephnab-Δkynbu recombinants . note that pcr products of similar size were obtained with primers fupout-kynbu/rdownout-kynbu when wild type or mutant genomic dna was used as templates, as  <dig> bp of kynbu were replaced by  <dig> bp of kanamycin cassette. altogether these results demonstrate that the lambda red technique is an efficient system for generating mutants in p. aeruginosa.

gene disruption using a 1-step pcr product
the mutagenesis process could be simplified by using a pcr fragment with a shorter region of homology to the target gene. this would enable the product to be obtained in a 1-step pcr using long primers that are homologous to the kanamycin resistance cassette at their 3' ends and homologous to the target gene at their 5' ends. thus in order to reduce the length of homologous extension necessary to select for p. aeruginosa recombinants, the following four sets of primers were designed to amplify the pqsc::kan locus: f-pqsc600/r-pqsc <dig>  f-pqsc300/r-pqsc <dig>  f-pqsc150/r-pqsc <dig> and f-pqsc100/r-pqsc <dig> . the pcr products generated contained the antibiotic cassette flanked with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or 100-nt homologous regions to the pqsc-surrounding region; when  <dig> μg of each product was electroporated,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> kmr colonies were obtained, respectively, and out of those  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> positive recombinants were identified based on their inability to produce pyocyanin, which corresponds to a 83–92% positive rate. five recombinants from each transformation event were analyzed by pcr and the expected products were obtained systematically using primers fupout-pqsc/rinkan and fupout-pqsc/rdownout-pqsc . these results show that in the case of pqsc mutagenesis the number of positive recombinants was not dependent on the length of the homologous region used and that a 100-nt homologous sequence was sufficient to allow recombination.

to further test the feasibility of 1-step pcr for this application, we designed and purchased primers  that contain at their 5' extremity 100-nt homology to the flanking regions of kynbu  or lasr  and at their 3' extremity 22– <dig> nt homology to the kanamycin resistance cassette . the kanamycin resistance cassette was amplified using puc4k as the template and a mixture of two sets of primers: f100-kan/r100-kan and fup/rdown . the resultant pcr product was used for electroporation. Δkynbu recombinants, but not Δlasr mutants, were obtained using  <dig> μg of pcr product and confirmed by pcr as described above. our inability to obtain the Δlasr mutant with this protocol indicates that the 1-step pcr method cannot be considered highly reliable and that  <dig> nt is likely close to the minimal length of homology needed.

transfer of deletion to other mutant backgrounds
the lambda red methodology was combined with 1-step pcr to transfer a knockout mutation from the original strain in which it was generated to other strains. we amplified the lasr::kan locus using the dna of the previously obtained mutant as the template and the primer pair f-lasr/r-lasr. the amplification generated a pcr product containing 490-nt and 445-nt upstream and downstream flanking target regions. eight-microgram aliquots of pcr product were electroporated into three pa <dig> isogenic mutants , and all three strains successfully acquired the mutated locus, which was demonstrated by dna amplification using primer pairs fupout-lasr/rinkan and fupout-lasr/rdownout-lasr.

a comprehensive non-redundant pa <dig> transposition mutant library was recently constructed by random insertion of the mar2xt <dig> transposon which confers gentamycin-resistance  <cit> . we tested whether the lambda red methodology would allow the transfer of loci where the mar2xt <dig> transposon has been randomly inserted. the gentamycin cassette that had been inserted into pqsc was amplified using primers f-pqsc600/r-pqsc <dig> to generate a product with 379-nt upstream and 471-nt downstream pqsc-surrounding regions. similar to the deletion experiments above,  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> μg samples of dna were electroporated into pa14/pucp18-reds and yielded  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> gmr recombinants, respectively. five recombinants were tested for the inability to produce pyocyanin in cultures and the presence of the mar2xt <dig> transposon was checked by pcr amplification using primers f-pqsc600/r-pqsc <dig>  respectively . these results demonstrate that the lambda red technique can be used in conjunction with a mutant library to achieve rapid transfer of mutated genes into various pa <dig> isogenic mutants and thereby enable the creation of multi-locus knockout mutants.

deletion of a large dna region using the lambda red system
lambda red-based methodology has the potential of enabling large regions of chromosomal dna, including large gene clusters and operons and pathogenicity islands, to be deleted. we examined whether the lambda red system could be also used to delete the entire p. aeruginosa hsi-ii locus  <cit> , an approximately  <dig> kb genomic region encoding a putative type vi secretion system located between pa14_ <dig> and pa14_ <dig> genes. the pcr procedure followed to obtain the pcr product necessary to delete the hsi-ii locus is presented in fig 1c. first, genomic dna of mutants of the pa <dig> non-redundant transposon library: pa14_43100::mar2xt <dig> and pa14_42880::mar2xt <dig> were used as template to generate the pcr fragment containing the gentamycin cassette flanked by the hsi-ii locus-borders. primers fup-pa14_43100/rup-mar2xt <dig> were designed to amplify mar2xt <dig> and the  <dig> nt upstream sequence when inserted into pa14_43100; while fdown-mar2xt7/rdown-pa14_ <dig> were used to amplify mar2xt <dig> and the  <dig> nt downstream sequence when inserted into pa14_ <dig> . in a second pcr-step, the resulting upstream and downstream fragments were mixed with the primers fup-pa14_ <dig> and rdown-pa14_ <dig> and a pcr product containing mar2xt <dig> flanked by the borders of the hsi-ii locus obtained. pcr product aliquots of  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> μg were electroporated into pa14/pucp18-reds, and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> recombinants were selected on gentamycin, respectively. all mutants tested were producing pyocyanin . dna amplification using primers fup-pa14_43100/rup-mar2xt <dig> and fup-pa14_43100/rdown-pa14_ <dig> confirmed deletion of the target region in  <dig> independent colonies; fig 4b shows the pcr products obtained for one representative recombinant. while no dna amplification with the primers fup-pa14_43100/rdown-pa14_ <dig> flanking the hsi-ii locus was obtained when wild type genomic dna was used as a template, a fragment of  <dig> bp was amplified when mutant genomic dna was used .

discussion
the principal advantage of lambda red-based mutagenesis is its rapidity. the technique can be performed in less than a week if the 3-step pcr procedure is used, and in less than three days if just the transfer of an existing mutated locus is needed. the protocol has been also further simplified by the use of choi et al's method for preparing electrocompetent cells  <cit> .

our results demonstrated that 100-nt homology between the pcr product and the target gene is sufficient in some cases to produce recombination. nevertheless to maximize the chances of obtaining mutants, the 3-step pcr technique should be used to generate a product with 600- to 400-nt homology extension to the target gene. also, note that fragments of the same length may have different efficiency of recombination rates due to differing sequence contexts.

the technique has yet never failed; however further experiments should be conducted to additionally test the ability of this methodology to transfer genes marked with an antibiotic cassette from pa <dig> to various non-isogenic p. aeruginosa strains.

to simplify the process, transposon mutants in the pa <dig> transposon mutant library can serve as templates for amplification of genes of interest already interrupted by an inserted mar2xt <dig> transposon carrying the gentamycin cassette. we routinely use this method to produce multi-locus knockout mutants. moreover, pa <dig> transposon mutant library can also serve for the rapid deletion of large chromosomal regions. the pao <dig> tetr transposon mutant library is an additional useful resource  <cit> . thus both libraries together with any mutant that carries a selective marker can be used to generate easily and rapidly multiple-mutation strains. to allow the construction of multiple mutations in the same chromosome, this method can be used in conjunction with previously described methods for marker excision   <cit> , which would allow recycling of the same selection marker in the same strain.

CONCLUSIONS
the lambda red-based technique can be used efficiently and rapidly to generate mutants in p. aeruginosa. chromosomal single gene deletions were generated using pcr product containing flanking regions that are homologous to the target sequence. to maximize the efficiency of mutants' generation, pcr products with 600- to 400-nt homology extension to the target gene should be used. this technique, in conjunction with previously generated p. aeruginosa transposon libraries, can also serve to delete large chromosomal regions.
