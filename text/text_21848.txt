BACKGROUND
the zelazny most surface waste management system is the largest mineral waste repository in europe and one of the largest in the world. it is located in the lubin-glogow copper district in southwest poland and covers an area of  <dig>  km <dig>  polymetallic organic-rich copper ore is currently mined underground in this area. this ore is characterized by its neutral or slightly alkaline ph  and its high salinity.

zelazny most reservoir was built in  <dig> to collect flotation tailings from three local copper-ore enrichment facilities, for the storage of groundwater from the lubin-glogow mines, and to be used to facilitate flotation of sulfides during ore processing and transport of the gangue. the total volumes of wastes and water present in zelazny most are estimated to be  <dig> mln m <dig> and  <dig>  mln m <dig>  respectively. the annual deposition of flotation tailings varies from  <dig> to  <dig> million tons
 <cit> .

the deposits in zelazny most have an alkaline ph  and are highly contaminated with heavy metals  and various organic compounds, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  such as anthracene, biphenyl, dibenzofurane, dibenzothiophene, chrysene, fluoranthene, fluorene, naphthalene, methylnaphthalene, methylphenanthrene, phenanthrene and pyrene . zelazny most is located in a seismically active area; however the seismicity is not a natural phenomenon, but is induced by the mining works in the nearby underground copper mines. this seismic activity could lead to the release of the contents of zelazny most to the environment, which would have devastating consequences
 <cit> .

the water stored in zelazny most is of the cl-so4-na-ca type with mineralization levels of up to  <dig>  mg l- <dig>  the respective concentrations of sodium  and chlorine  ions are up to  <dig> mg l- <dig> and around  <dig> mg l- <dig>  which makes this environment extremely salty
 <cit> . saline environments are inhabited by specialized microorganisms, typically halophilic archaea  and bacteria .

the family halomonadaceae  currently is comprised of  <dig> genera. these are chemoorganoheterotrophic, aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria, most of which are halophilic or halotolerant. the genus halomonas  contains over forty named species. members of the halomonas genus have a respiratory-type metabolism with oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor, although some can use nitrate as an alternative acceptor under anaerobic growth conditions. these bacteria are prototrophs able to utilize a large range of organic compounds as their sole carbon and energy source . the majority of them require na+ ions for growth  and all can grow in a broad range of nacl concentrations 
 <cit> . halomonads may be isolated from various saline environments, regardless of their geographical location . four species were isolated from the rhizosphere of xerophytic plants
 <cit> .

extreme halophiles, including halomonads, are sources of a variety of bioproducts that can function under conditions of high salt:  compatible solutes that have a stabilizing and protective effect on biomolecules, cell structures and whole cells,  extracellular enzymes adapted to saline stress,  biosurfactants,  extracellular polysaccharides and  poly-β-hydroxyalcanoates. the use of halophiles in the production of these compounds can significantly lower the cost of fermentation and recovery processes, since high salt concentrations reduce the possibility of contamination by non-halophilic microorganisms, thus, the energy requirement for sterilization can be significantly decreased
 <cit> .

in recent years, several halomonas spp. genomic projects were initiated, but so far only the genome of the ectoine producer halomonas elongata dsm  <dig> has been completed
 <cit> . current knowledge of mobile genetic elements  of halomonads is also very poor. several halomonas spp. plasmids have been described, but only the narrow-host-range , mobilizable, cryptic plasmid phe <dig>  of the moderately halophilic bacterium h. elongata atcc  <dig> has been characterized in detail
 <cit> . in addition, a temperate phage phihap- <dig>  which possesses a linear plasmid-like prophage genome, was isolated from halomonas aquamarina and sequenced
 <cit> .

in this study, we have analyzed strain halomonas sp. zm <dig>  isolated from zelazny most during the bioshale project 
 <cit> . we have performed complex structural and functional analyses of mobile genetic elements of this strain, specifically plasmid pzm3h <dig>  responsible for adaptation of the host strain to the harsh environment and two insertion sequences  captured using the trap plasmid pmat <dig>  to our knowledge this is the first description of functional transposable elements in halomonads.

methods

the following plasmid vectors were used:  pabw <dig> 
 <cit> ,  pbbr1-mcs <dig> 
 <cit>  and  pmat <dig> 
 <cit> . plasmids constructed in this work were:  pabw-zm3h <dig>  – mobilizable e. coli-halomonas spp. shuttle plasmid constructed by insertion of an ecorv restriction fragment of pzm3h <dig>  into the bamhi site of pabw <dig> , and  pbbr-zm3czcmer  – ecori-nhei restriction fragment of pzm3h <dig>  containing resistance determinants, inserted between the smai and ecori sites of pbbr1mcs- <dig> .

bacterial strains were grown in lb  medium
 <cit>  or mineral basal salts  medium
 <cit>  at 37°c  or 30°c . where necessary, the medium was supplemented with kanamycin , rifampin  and sucrose .

temperature, ph and salinity tolerance analyses
the temperature, ph and salinity tolerance of halomonas sp. zm <dig> were analyzed by monitoring changes in optical density  during incubation of cultures in titration plates, with the aid of an automated microplate reader . overnight cultures were diluted in fresh lb media with adjustments for the separate assays:  ph  <dig>  for the temperature tolerance analysis,  ph  <dig> - <dig>  for the ph tolerance analysis, or  supplemented with nacl to final concentrations of  <dig> %, 3%, 6%, 9%, 12% or 15%. in each case, the initial optical density at  <dig> nm  was  <dig> . the microplates were then incubated with shaking at 30°c  or 4°c, 15°c, 22°c, 25°c, 30°c, 37°c, 42°c or 50°c  for  <dig> hours.

utilization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
to test the ability of bacterial strains to utilize anthracene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene, fluorene and pyrene, the modified pah plate assay was employed
 <cit> . a volume of  <dig> μl of each overnight culture was spotted onto the surface of an mbs agar plate and allowed to soak in. bacterial cultures were pre-grown for  <dig> hours and then flooded with  <dig> ml of a 1%  solution of each pah dissolved in acetone. after evaporating the acetone, the plates were incubated at 30°c for up to  <dig> weeks and inspected daily for the presence of a clear zone surrounding the area of growth .

heavy metal and metalloid ion resistance
analytical grade heavy metal salts  were used to prepare  <dig>  m,  <dig>  m and  <dig> m stock solutions in water. each solution was filter-sterilized and added to lb medium to produce a range of final concentrations  of between  <dig>  mm and  <dig> mm of the metal ion. minimum inhibitory concentrations  for all analyzed strains were defined on titration plates using a broth dilution method in which changes in the optical density of cultures were measured in comparison with non-inoculated controls. each microplate was monitored for growth using an automated microplate reader at 24-hour intervals for three days.

the heavy metal resistance phenotype was assessed from the ability to grow in the presence of   <dig> mm as ,   <dig> mm each of as, cd, co, cu, ni, zn and cr, and   <dig>  mm hg
 <cit> .

beta-lactams resistance
the mics of antibiotics representing three classes of beta-lactams were determined by epsilometer tests  using a gradient of the appropriate antibiotic: ampicillin , ceftazidime  and meropenem . each e-test strip was placed on lawns of the bacteria on agar plates and the pattern of growth was recorded after  <dig> hours incubation at 30°c or 37°c. the lowest concentration of the antibiotic that prevented growth was considered the mic.

siderophore detection
the ability to produce siderophores was examined using the modified chrome azurol s  agar plate method
 <cit> . plates were incubated at 30°c for  <dig> hours in the dark and the formation of halos around colonies was recorded.

plasmid dna isolation, genetic manipulations, pcr conditions and introduction of plasmid dna into bacterial cells
the isolation of plasmids, southern hybridization analysis and common dna manipulation methods were performed as described by sambrook and russell
 <cit> . pcr was performed in a mastercycler  using hifi polymerase , dntp mixture and total dna of halomonas sp. zm <dig> with appropriate primer pairs:  lisphsp <dig>  and risphsp <dig>  – specific to ishsp1;  lisphsp <dig>  and risphsp <dig>  – specific to ishsp2;  lczczm <dig>  and rczczm <dig>  – specific to the cobalt, zinc, cadmium  resistance module  of plasmid pzm3h1; and  lmerzm <dig>  and rmerzm <dig>  – specific to the mercury  resistance module  of pzm3h <dig>  the sacb-specific primers used to identify the target site of transposition, were previously described by szuplewska and bartosik
 <cit> . a colony pcr method for the amplification of 16s rrna genes
 <cit> , used primers 27f and 1492r
 <cit> . the transformation of e. coli strains was performed according to the method of kushner
 <cit> . triparental mating was performed as described previously
 <cit> .

identification and analysis of a pool of tes
trap plasmid pmat1
 <cit> , containing sacb of bacillus subtilis, was introduced into halomonas sp. zm3r. overnight cultures of the kanamycin and rifampin resistant transconjugants were spread on plates of solidified lb medium supplemented with sucrose. the sacb gene encodes levansucrase, an enzyme whose activity  leads to accumulation of toxic compounds in the bacterial cell
 <cit> . therefore, cultivation of cells carrying the functional sacb gene in medium containing sucrose results in cell lysis. this allows direct selection of sacb mutants  , whose growth is not affected under these conditions. the plasmids of  <dig> sucr clones were analyzed for the presence of inserted tes.

dna sequencing
the complete nucleotide sequence of plasmid pzm3h <dig> was determined by the dna sequencing and oligonucleotide synthesis laboratory  at the institute of biochemistry and biophysics, polish academy of sciences. high-throughput sequencing of the mid-tagged shotgun plasmid-library was performed using an flx titanium genome sequencer . newbler de novo assembler software  was used for the sequence assembly. final gap closure and sequence polishing were performed by capillary sequencing of pcr products using an abi3730xl dna analyzer .

nucleotide sequences of the insertion sequences were obtained using the primer walking approach with a dye terminator sequencing kit and an automated sequencer .

bioinformatics
plasmid nucleotide sequences were analyzed using clone manager  and artemis software
 <cit> . similarity searches were performed using the blast programs
 <cit>  provided by the national center for biotechnology information   and the priam tool
 <cit> . comparison searches of insertion sequences were performed with isfinder
 <cit> . helix-turn-helix motifs were predicted using the helix-turn-helix motif prediction program
 <cit> . phylogenetic analyses were performed using the phylogeny inference package – phylip v <dig> 
 <cit> , applying the neighbor-joining  algorithm with kimura corrected distances and  <dig> bootstrap replicates. dna sequence alignments obtained with clustalw
 <cit>  were manually refined using the t-coffee multiple sequence alignment program
 <cit> . highly variable portions of the alignments were eliminated by the use of g-blocks
 <cit> . the tree was rendered with treeview version  <dig> . <dig> 
 <cit> .

nucleotide sequence accession numbers
the 16s rdna sequence of halomonas sp. zm <dig> has been deposited in the ncbi database with the accession number . the nucleotide sequences of plasmid pzm3h <dig> and insertion sequences ishsp <dig> and ishsp <dig> have been annotated and deposited with the accession numbers ,  and , respectively.

RESULTS
physiological characterization of the strain zm3
a comparative analysis of the partial 16s rdna sequence  of strain zm <dig> revealed a high level of similarity to the corresponding sequences of several environmental isolates of halomonas spp.  and halomonas variabilis dsm 3051t  isolated from the great salt lake 
 <cit> . based on this sequence homology, the strain zm <dig> was classified in the genus halomonas.

to identify specific features of halomonas sp. zm <dig> that have enabled its adaptation to the extreme environment of zelazny most, a complex physiological characterization of the strain was performed, including analyses of  temperature, ph and salinity tolerance,  siderophore production,  resistance to heavy metal ions, and  pah utilization ability. the obtained results revealed that strain zm <dig> can grow in lb medium at temperatures ranging from  <dig> to 37°c , but within a relatively narrow ph range of between  <dig> and  <dig> . moreover, it can tolerate high salinity  and the presence of high concentrations of inorganic arsenic species  and as of  <dig> mm and  <dig> mm, respectively). a low level of resistance to copper, mercury and nickel was also observed . analysis of the pattern of pah utilization  revealed that strain zm <dig> uses phenanthrene as the sole source of carbon. application of the universal chrome azurol s  agar plate assay demonstrated that the zm <dig> strain produces high levels of iron-chelating siderophores .

mics considered to represent the resistance phenotype shown in bold.

the results of these physiological tests revealed that halomonas sp. zm <dig> is well adapted to inhabit the zelazny most mineral waste reservoir. since many features of adaptive value are frequently determined by mobile genetic elements , we analyzed the extrachromosomal dna of this strain.

general features of plasmid pzm3h1
halomonas sp. zm <dig> carries only one extrachromosomal replicon, designated pzm3h <dig>  dna sequencing demonstrated that pzm3h <dig> is a circular plasmid  with a mean g+c content  of  <dig> % . more detailed in silico analyses revealed that pzm3h <dig> carries  <dig> putative open reading frames  . three of them  have no homologs in public databases, while  <dig> have homologs of unknown function. the functions of the remaining orfs were predicted from their similarities to known protein coding sequences. features of these orfs, including their position, transcriptional orientation, the size of the encoded proteins, and their closest known homologs, are summarized in additional file
1: table s1).

further analysis of pzm3h <dig> revealed its modular structure. within the plasmid genome it was possible to distinguish putative genetic modules responsible for  plasmid maintenance – replication  and stabilization,  mobilization for conjugal transfer ,  resistance to heavy metals, and  other accessory genetic information .

characterization of the conserved backbone of plasmid pzm3h1
the backbone of pzm3h <dig> is composed of  a rep module ,  a mob module  and two types of stabilization module, namely  par , encoding a partitioning system responsible for the correct distribution of plasmid molecules into daughter cells upon cell division, and  ta , encoding a toxin and antitoxin involved in postsegregational elimination of plasmid-less cells .

the rep module of pzm3h <dig> carries a single orf  encoding a predicted protein with similarities to the repa replication initiation proteins of several bacterial plasmids, including two well characterized members of the incu incompatibility group: plasmid ra <dig> of aeromonas hydrophila <cit>  and rms <dig> of pseudomonas aeruginosa <cit> . the predicted repa of pzm3h <dig>  contains a putative helix-turn-helix  motif  located within the c-terminal part of the protein.

the putative repa gene  is bordered on both sides by stretches of a+t-rich sequence . analysis of the upstream region revealed the presence of two identical direct repeat sequences  separated by a spacer of  <dig> bp. the downstream region contains two long , nearly identical  direct repeats  separated by an 87-bp spacer . it is noteworthy that the four 5′-terminal residues of dr <dig> are located within the repa coding sequence. moreover, a shorter sequence was identified  <dig> bp upstream of dr <dig> , that perfectly matches the core region of the dr <dig> and dr <dig> repeats .

such repeated sequences, placed downstream and upstream of the repa gene, were also identified within the rep region of the related plasmid ra <dig>  it was demonstrated that the downstream repeats are crucial for the initiation of ra <dig> replication
 <cit> . based on the overall similarities of the rep regions, we assume that the origin of replication of pzm3h <dig>  is placed analogously to that of ra <dig>  and contains the dr <dig>  dr <dig> and dr <dig> repeats .

the putative par module of pzm3h <dig> is composed of two non-overlapping orfs  and a centromere-like site. the orf <dig> encodes a putative 214-aa protein, showing significant similarity to atpases involved in chromosome partitioning, assigned to cog <dig> . this similarity includes the sequence kggvgks , which matches the highly conserved canonical deviant walker a motif kgggkt of para-type proteins
 <cit> . this predicted para also contains an n-terminally located putative hth motif . the orf <dig> encodes an 80-aa polypeptide with sequence similarity to several hypothetical proteins, whose genes are usually located downstream from predicted para genes . this strongly suggests that orf <dig> encodes a parb-type protein: another important component of plasmid partitioning systems. careful inspection of the nucleotide sequence revealed the presence of several 7-bp imperfect inverted repeats, located close to the promoter region of the predicted par operon, which may constitute a plasmid centromere-like site  .

ta stabilization modules usually encode two components: a toxin which recognizes a specific cellular target and an antitoxin, which counteracts the toxin. the predicted ta module of pzm3h <dig> fits with this scheme, since it is composed of two short non-overlapping orfs  separated by a 9-bp spacer. one of the orfs  encodes a putative protein with significant sequence homology to a large family of proteins assigned to cog <dig> . these proteins, referred to as phage-related , were shown to be the toxic components  of a number of ta systems
 <cit> . the downstream gene  encodes a putative protein with substantial similarity to antitoxins classified to cog <dig> and cog <dig>  the predicted antitoxin contains a hth domain typical for members of the xre/cro protein family. pairs of genes homologous to orf29-orf <dig> are conserved and widely distributed in bacterial genomes, including the tad-ata locus of plasmid pami <dig> of paracoccus aminophilus jcm  <dig> – the archetype of this group of ta systems
 <cit> .

the next component of the pzm3h <dig> backbone, the mob module, encodes a single mobilization protein  sharing a low, but significant level of amino acid  sequence homology with the mob relaxases of pocegk <dig> from oceanimonas sp. gk <dig>  and broad-host-range plasmid pbbr <dig> of bordetella bronchiseptica s <dig>  . detailed comparative sequence analysis of the potential orf32/moba relaxase revealed the presence of several conserved motifs, which permits classification of the protein into the mobv <dig> group within the mobv family
 <cit> . upstream of the putative moba  gene, an imperfect  10-bp inverted repeat sequence was identified , whose location and structure is typical for the origin of conjugal transfer  of mob systems encoding mobv type relaxases .

analysis of the host range of pzm3h1
to analyze the host range of the halomonas sp. zm <dig> plasmid, a mobilizable shuttle replicon pabw-zm3h <dig> was constructed, containing the rep module of pzm3h <dig> and an e. coli-specific pmb <dig>  replication system . the obtained plasmid was introduced via conjugation into strains representing three classes of proteobacteria:  alpha- ,  beta- , and  gammaproteobacteria . the plasmid was also introduced by transformation into e. coli br <dig> . since the e. coli-specific system is not functional in any of the strains listed above , the functions required for replication of the plasmid in the tested hosts must be provided by the rep module of pzm3h <dig>  this analysis demonstrated that pabw-zm3h <dig> could replicate exclusively in two pseudomonas strains , which indicates a relatively narrow host range.

characterization of the resistance modules
comparative sequence analysis revealed that a large dna segment of pzm3h <dig>  is highly conserved  in the genome of congregibacter litoralis kt <dig> . as shown in figure 
 <dig>  the homologous c. litoralis region differs slightly, since it contains two additional orfs  that are absent in pzm3h <dig> . further in silico sequence analysis revealed that this region of the c. litoralis genome represents part of a putative tn <dig> family transposon  , related to tn <dig> identified in plasmid pww <dig> of pseudomonas putida <cit> . plasmid pzm3h <dig> carries a large portion of this c. litoralis transposon , although it lacks the  <dig>  -kbterminal region of the element, which contains three genes coding for a putative nadp-specific glutamate dehydrogenase, a conserved membrane protein and a transposase . this truncated transposon contains  two heavy metal resistance cassettes – a co/zn/cd efflux system  and mercury resistance determinants ,  an orf encoding a protein of the metallo-beta-lactamase family ,  a site-specific resolution system  homologous to the mrs system of tn <dig> <cit> , as well as  four orfs encoding hypothetical proteins with unknown functions  .

the putative efflux system  encodes a predicted czcd metal transport membrane protein , which mediates cobalt , zinc  and cadmium  resistance . the mercury resistance module  contains  <dig> orfs  with significant levels of homology to the merrtpabde genes, responsible for enzymatic detoxification of hg2+ ions to the less toxic form hg <dig> <cit> . the key enzymes in this mercury resistance system are  organomercurial lyase  – effectively performs hydrolysis of stable mercury-carbon bonds, and  mercuric reductase  – reduces hg2+ to hg <dig>  in a process that involves hydride transfer from the electron carrier nadph to flavin. three other important components are  two transcriptional regulatory proteins ,  two mercury ion transport proteins , and  an accessory membrane protein 
 <cit>  .

to investigate whether the analyzed resistance cassettes are functional, plasmid pbbr-zm3czcmer was constructed by inserting the orf11-orf <dig> gene cluster of pzm3h <dig>  into broad-host-range  mobilizable vector pbbr-mcs <dig> . since we were unable to remove  plasmid pzm3h <dig> from its natural host , the obtained plasmid pbbr-zm3czcmer was introduced  into pseudomonas spp. lm7r and lm12r  and e. coli tg <dig> , as well as a. tumefaciens lba <dig> . the resistance phenotypes of the obtained transconjugants and the wild-type strains were then tested by determination of the minimum inhibitory concentrations  of cd, co, zn and hg salts in liquid culture .

this analysis revealed that introduction of pbbr-zm3czcmer into strain lm7r resulted in a significant increase in the mics of cobalt  and zinc , which indicates resistance. in contrast, the level of tolerance to mercury was not changed . different results were obtained with the transconjugants of strains lm12r and lba <dig>  which exhibited resistance to mercury , but not to cobalt or zinc. interestingly, none of the tested strains was resistant to cadmium. introduction of the plasmid pbbr-zm3czcmer into e. coli tg <dig> did not result in cobalt or mercury resistance; however, an unexpected increase in sensitivity to zinc was observed .

besides the czc and mer modules, plasmid pbbr-zm3czcmer also carries orf <dig> encoding a protein related to metallo-beta-lactamases, many of which confer resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, e.g.
 <cit> . therefore, we tested whether the pbbr-zm3czcmer-containing strains  acquired resistance to antibiotics representing three classes of beta-lactams:  ampicillin ,  ceftazidime  and  meropenem . the mics, determined by epsilometer tests, revealed no resistance phenotype, indicating that orf <dig> protein does not exhibit beta-lactamase activity in these strains.

identification and characterization of transposable elements 
for the identification of functional tes of halomonas sp. zm <dig> we employed the mobilizable bhr trap plasmid pmat <dig>  carrying the sacb cassette, which enables positive selection of transposition events
 <cit> . a pool of putative transposition mutants was collected and analyzed as described in methods. from this set of mutants, two classes of pmat <dig> derivatives were identified, containing inserted elements of respective sizes  <dig> kb and  <dig>  kb, which is typical for the majority of insertion sequences . dna sequencing and comparison of the obtained nucleotide sequences  revealed that the identified elements were novel insertion sequences, designated ishsp <dig> and ishsp <dig> 

ishsp <dig> carries identical terminal inverted repeat sequences  of  <dig> bp at both ends . transposition of the element into the sacb cassette of pmat <dig> resulted in duplication of a short  target sequence  to form direct repeats  . within the 1518-bp-long sequence of ishsp <dig>  only one orf was identified , encoding a putative protein  with 93% sequence identity to the transposase of ismaq <dig> of marinobacter aquaeolei vt <dig> . both elements  also show high overall similarity  of their nucleotide sequences.

the predicted transposase of ishsp <dig> contains n <dig>  n <dig> and c <dig> regions, including three acidic residues , that are highly conserved in the catalytic domains of transposases of bacterial tes and retrovirus integrases
 <cit> . as shown in figure 
 <dig>  the sequence of this motif is in relatively good agreement with the dde consensus for transposases of the is <dig> group of the is <dig> family; however, the distance between the n <dig> and c <dig> regions  is significantly longer than that of the consensus sequence .

the other captured element, ishsp <dig> , contains non-identical terminal irs of  <dig> bp  and two non-overlapping orfs , encoding putative proteins of  <dig> aa  and  <dig> aa , respectively . within orf <dig> , a putative − <dig> frameshift motif was identified  in the loop of a predicted mrna stem-loop structure. this motif most probably promotes a programmed translational frameshift, which leads to the formation of a functional fusion  transposase . the putative proteins encoded by the individual orfs of ishsp <dig> carry a potential hth dna-binding motif  and a complete dde motif  – typical for the is <dig> family. both motifs are also present within the predicted trans-frame transposase  generated by translational slippage. the fusion transposase shows the highest level of aa sequence similarity  with the fusion transposase of isvsa <dig> – an element present in  <dig> copies in chromosomes i and ii of aliivibrio salmonicida lfi1238
 <cit> .

based on the results of the comparative analysis, ishsp <dig> and ishsp <dig> have been classified as novel members of the is <dig>  and is <dig> families, respectively.

copy number of selected genes of the identified mges
to determine the copy number of the identified iss, as well as the czc and mer modules of pzm3h <dig> in the halomonas sp. zm <dig> genome, dna hybridization analysis was performed. pcr-amplified digoxygenin-labeled internal fragments of the mera gene , czcd gene , ishsp <dig> and ishsp <dig>  were used to probe southern blots of total halomonas sp. zm <dig> dna digested with restriction enzymes . using this method, single copies of the czc and mer modules were identified in the zm <dig> genome , while four and two copies of the insertion sequences ishsp <dig> and ishsp <dig> were detected, respectively .

discussion
groundwater from the lubin-glogow mines , that has various uses including the flotation of sulfides during ore processing, contains sodium and chlorine ions at high concentrations, which results in elevated salinity of the deposits in the zelazny most waste reservoir. these conditions favor the expansion of halophilic microorganisms, one of which  was analyzed in this study. strain zm <dig> is well adapted to the harsh environment of zelazny most, since it is hyper-resistant to inorganic arsenic species as and as, and shows elevated resistance to highly toxic ions of copper, mercury and nickel. moreover, it is able to utilize phenanthrene , which makes it a good candidate for bioremediation of pah-contaminated hypersaline environments. the strain zm <dig> is also an efficient siderophore producer. such metal chelating compounds have been shown to complex iron and other metals, and also mobilize chemical elements from minerals , and so may play a significant role in the redistribution of elements in the zelazny most environment.

the present study was focused on mobile genetic elements  of halomonas sp. zm <dig>  our analysis revealed that the zm <dig> strain carries only one extrachromosomal replicon , whose replication system shows similarity to the rep modules of several plasmids classified within the incu incompatibility group. although this group contains several broad-host-range conjugative plasmids responsible for the dissemination of antibiotic resistance determinants , there is a dearth of knowledge about incu replicons. to better define this group, we performed comprehensive blast searches of the ncbi database, which identified  <dig> replicons encoding homologous rep proteins  with amino acid sequence similarity levels of ≥27%.

phylogenetic analysis of the incu plasmids  revealed the presence of two subgroups, comprised of  <dig> and  <dig> replicons, which clearly correspond to the gram-negative  and gram-positive  hosts, respectively. as shown in figure 
 <dig>  the phylogenetic distance of the pzm3h <dig> rep reflects its weak relationship with rep proteins of gram-negative bacteria. this suggests that the replication system of pzm3h <dig> may be considered as an archetype of a novel subgroup of incu-like replicons .

the divergence of the rep module may be reflected by the relatively narrow host range  of pzm3h <dig>  besides the native strain zm <dig>  this plasmid was shown to replicate in only two  strains of pseudomonas . many of the analyzed strains lack their own plasmids, so the failure to obtain transconjugants did not result from incompatibility between the incoming and residing replicons. therefore, it may be hypothesized that the initiation of pzm3h <dig> replication requires specific cellular factors present only in some strains or species of the genus pseudomonas or halomonas.

plasmid pzm3h <dig> contains a predicted mob module, which suggests that it may be mobilized for conjugal transfer. it has recently been demonstrated that the host range of mob systems can be wider than the replication systems of the plasmids they carry. thus, nhr mobilizable plasmids may be considered as efficient carrier molecules, which act as natural suicide vectors promoting the spread of diverse genetic information  among evolutionarily-distinct bacterial species
 <cit> . plasmid pzm3h <dig>  despite its narrow host range, may therefore play an important role in horizontal dissemination of genetic modules conferring heavy metal resistance phenotypes.

the resistance cassette of pzm3h <dig>  composed of mer and czc genetic modules, is part of a large truncated tn <dig> family transposon. it is well known that mer operons mediate detoxification of mercury compounds, while czcd genes mediate low level zn2+, co2+ and cd2+ resistance 
 <cit> . both modules are widely disseminated in bacterial genomes and frequently occur on plasmids and transposons .

unexpectedly, the introduction of these resistance modules into two pseudomonas spp. strains  produced completely different phenotypes. strain lm7r  gained resistance to zinc and cobalt, but not mercury, whereas lm12r acquired only mercury resistance . moreover, neither of the strains was resistant to cadmium. this finding demonstrated that the phenotype determined by plasmid pzm3h <dig> is highly dependent on the host strain. the host specificity of resistance phenotypes generated by two related czcd modules of staphylococcus aureus and thermus thermophilus was also described by nies
 <cit> . the results revealed that the former is involved in zinc and cobalt resistance, while the latter mediates zinc and cadmium  resistance.

in another strand of the present study, the trap plasmid pmat <dig> was employed to identify functional transposable elements of halomonas sp. zm <dig>  using the sacb positive selection strategy, we were unable to “capture” any resistance transposons. the only identified elements were two insertion sequences: ishsp <dig>  and ishsp <dig> . both elements are present in more than one copy in the zm <dig> genome, and so they may potentially form composite transposons.

ishsp <dig> is most closely related to ismaq <dig> of m. aquaeolei vt <dig> . members of the genera marinobacter and halomonas are widely distributed in many environments. these bacteria are usually isolated from the same habitats, including oceans and seas, saline soils, marine snow, hot springs and volcanic basalts
 <cit> , which may favor horizontal gene transfer between them .

the second “captured” element, ishsp <dig>  was classified within the is630/tc <dig> superfamily, which is comprised of promiscuous tes found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes
 <cit> . ishsp <dig> carries two orfs encoding the n- and c-terminal parts of the transposase, respectively. therefore, generation of the complete functional enzyme requires ribosomal frame-shifting: a phenomenon that plays an important role in regulating the frequency of transposition of some iss . the fusion transposase of ishsp <dig> exhibits only a moderate level of amino acid sequence homology to transposases of the is <dig> family. moreover, transposition of the is generates 4-bp-long drs , while other related elements duplicate only the 5′-ta-3′ dinucleotide. these divergent features indicate that ishsp <dig> represents a distinct member of the is <dig> family.

CONCLUSIONS
bacteria of the genus halomonas are “opportunitrophic” microbes, since they are generalists that employ a strategy of acquiring and maintaining a broad and diverse metabolic potential in order to exploit changeable environmental resources
 <cit> . such strains may find application in biotechnology and bioremediation, so it is extremely important to characterize their metabolic potential, as well as their mobile genetic elements, which facilitate horizontal gene transfer and increase the fitness of their hosts in extreme environments.

the overall characterization of halomonas sp. zm <dig> has provided information concerning genus- , as well as strain-specific physiological features , that enable the survival of zm <dig> in the highly contaminated environment of zelazny most.

special attention was given to plasmid pzm3h <dig>  carrying heavy metal resistance determinants. this plasmid is unique among the elements identified in this genus , which suggests its relatively recent acquisition.

characterization of the zm <dig> plasmid as well as two novel transposable elements increase current knowledge concerning the diversity of mobile dna of bacteria of the family halomonadaceae. moreover, the identified elements and their individual genetic modules may be used to construct specific tools for the genetic analysis of halomonas spp.
