BACKGROUND
juvenile dermatomyositis, a systemic vasculopathy, is the most common of the inflammatory myopathies in children and is characterized by symmetrical proximal muscle weakness, and a pathognomonic rash, which includes a heliotrope discoloration about the eyes, dilated capillaries at the nailbeds and eyelid margins, and thickened erythema over the knuckles . the three other diagnostic criteria are: serum elevation of muscle derived enzymes, a muscle biopsy with specific histological features that include mononuclear cell infiltrates as well as perifasicular atrophy with evidence of an occlusive vasculopathy, and a positive electromyogram documenting inflammation  <cit> .

there is little information describing the critical variables that influence the development and course of this often devastating illness. over  <dig>  cases/million children/year are diagnosed, with a  <dig>  girl to  <dig> boy ratio  <cit> . at the time of their first symptom, rash or weakness, the mean age of the patient population is  <dig>  years, while 25% of the children are age  <dig> or younger. it usually takes  <dig> months or more for the children to be diagnosed with jdm, when the muscle biopsy is obtained  <cit> . at diagnosis, the extent and severity of the skin and muscle inflammatory response can be assessed using validated disease activity scores  for skin and muscle involvement  <cit> .

children with jdm often have a family history of autoimmune disease. the frequencies of the hla antigens dqa1* <dig>  dqa1* <dig>  and drb <dig> have been reported to be higher in the jdm population than control populations suggesting a genetic contribution to this disorder, which may be additionally influenced by the tnf-α- <dig> allelic polymorphisms  <cit> .

the precise stimulus initiating the inflammatory process is not known. however, there is evidence that newly diagnosed children with jdm have a history of infection, often respiratory or gastrointestinal in nature, within three months prior to the appearance of rash or muscle weakness  <cit> . in addition, gene expression profile data from mri directed diagnostic biopsies of muscle from untreated children with active symptoms of jdm identified up-regulation of many type i interferon-  inducible genes  <cit> . these findings support the interpretation that the inflammatory milieu in jdm is similar to that seen in anti-microbial responses. in that investigation we also found a marked down-regulation of genes associated with protein synthesis; both observations were subsequently confirmed in studies of muscle from adults with dm  <cit> .

untreated chronic inflammation in children with jdm is associated with the development of pathological calcifications  <cit> . the phenotype of the children who present in clinic early in their disease course differs from those diagnosed later, both with respect to height and weight, and specific jdm symptoms. children diagnosed early in the disease course are much weaker than those who have a longer time to diagnosis  <cit> . however, the extent and severity of skin involvement appears to be stable over time  <cit> .

with respect to diagnostic laboratory testing, serum levels of muscle enzymes, generally used to evaluate muscle inflammation, are more likely to be in the normal range when blood is collected 2– <dig>  months after the child's first symptom , making it more difficult to establish a diagnosis of definite jdm  <cit> . the purpose of the present study was to examine the impact of the duration of untreated chronic inflammation on gene expression in diagnostic muscle biopsies obtained from a large group of untreated girls with clinical symptoms of active jdm in order to identify genes and biological processes associated with disease progression in jdm.

RESULTS
demographics
all diagnostic biopsies studied were from untreated girls who had not been given any nonsteroidal or immunosuppressive therapy, and for whom a disease activity score  was obtained at the time of biopsy . the short disease duration group  was compared with the long duration group . their ages at disease onset date were similar:  <dig>  ±  <dig>  years for the short duration group compared with  <dig>  ±  <dig>  years for long duration group. they were similar in disease activity scores. total das for the short duration group was  <dig>  ±  <dig>   compared with the total das for the long disease duration group of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . microarray analysis did not identify any gene significantly differentially expressed among different genotypes . the second group of girls tested for confirmation of the gene expression changes by immunohistochemistry or rt-pcr,  <dig> patients each of long and short duration of untreated disease were also similar with respect to age at onset, race, and das scores .

comparison of muscle biopsy gene profiles based on disease duration
as noted above, duration of disease, measured as more than  <dig> months of symptoms is a critical variable, influencing both clinical and laboratory data  <cit> . since changes at the molecular level occur prior to phenotypic changes, we used  <dig> months  as the grouping cut-off in the present study. in order to control for gender effects, this study was limited to girls. we identified  <dig> genes represented by  <dig> affymetrix probe sets differentially expressed in the muscle samples. all genes reached statistical significance  after multiple testing correction with the false positive rate at 5%. in addition, in order to "bracket" the optimal cut-off time we compared data from patients with disease duration of  <dig> months or less with greater than  <dig> months, and also compared  <dig> months or less with greater than  <dig> months. there was no significant difference in expressed genes when the  <dig> month cut-off was used, and only  <dig> genes were differentially expressed when the  <dig> month cut-off was used.

for an overview of the changes in relation to the baseline generated using the control samples from age-matched healthy girls undergoing cleft palate repair, we used hierarchical clustering analysis to visualize changes of gene expression patterns associated with the three groups  . six clusters were identified by visualizing the gene tree in figure  <dig>  among the  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes were expressed at a lower level in the group with active disease greater than  <dig> months vs. shorter than  <dig> months , while  <dig> genes were expressed at a higher level in the group .

cluster a represents genes up-regulated only in jdm patients with short duration of active disease. cluster b represents genes significantly down-regulated only in jdm patients with long duration of active jdm. many genes in these two clusters are involved in protein turn over and stress responses . most genes in cluster e are either encoding enzymes or proteins with unknown functions. these genes were highly up-regulated in patients with short duration of active disease but not in the other groups suggesting that they are activated at the acute phase of the disease.

for genes up-regulated in patients with longer duration of active disease , genes in cluster c and d were up-regulated in both groups when compared to healthy controls. however, the changes were significantly higher in the patients with long duration of active disease. interestingly, most of the immune response genes identified in this study were grouped into these two clusters . while genes in cluster f were expressed at higher level in the group with long duration, most of the genes in this cluster were down-regulated compared to the baseline . in cluster f, most genes are associated with functions of vasculature remodelling. in this report, we will focus on genes in cluster c, d and f , while the complete gene list of each cluster is reported in additional file  <dig> 

affymetrix accession
in a previous profiling study, we identified a list of immune response genes differentially expressed in jdm patients, in which many of the genes were induced by type i interferon   <cit> . although many probe sets on the u133a microarry are different from those on the affymetrix fl microarray, the changes identified previously were verified using the new microarray. however we found no differential expression of those ifn inducible genes in the short and long disease duration group, suggesting the expression of these inflammatory response genes is independent of disease chronicity.

infiltration of mature dendritic cells in the patients with longer duration of active symptoms
to interpret the changes of genes involved in immune responses in cluster c and d , we first searched for genes that were highly expressed in specific immune cell types. although most of the genes were not specifically expressed by a single cell type, hla-dr and glycoprotein nmb have been shown to be highly expressed in dendritic cells compared to b cells, monocytes and t cells  <cit> . this pattern of up-regulation of the genes suggested that there might be a higher number of dendritic cells in the muscle of children with a longer duration of active disease.

using qrt-pcr, we first verified the expression changes hla-dqa <dig> which could be either directly involved in antigen presentation or a surrogate marker of an active site. because supply of diagnostic muscle biopsy tissue was limited, we tested a different group of  <dig> girls with short duration of disease, less than  <dig> months and a different group of  <dig> girls with disease duration greater or equal to  <dig> months, plus  <dig> girls from the original long disease duration group, which had been gene profiled in this study .

the expression level of hla-dqa <dig> was  <dig>  fold  up-regulated in patients with longer duration of active disease, which verified our array data  . we then performed immunohistochemistry, using an antibody directed against a dendritic cell maturation marker, dc-lamp to localize the cells in the muscle tissues . long disease duration jdm patients displayed a greater overall presence of mature dendritic cells  compared to short disease duration jdm patients . greater concentrations of mature dendritic cells were found in perivascular regions compared with the endomesium, in addition, many mature dendritic cells were bdca <dig> positive suggesting a plasmacytoid origin. no significant differences were found in the distribution of the bdca <dig> positive plasmacytoid dendritic cells in jdm of either long or short disease duration . muscle from healthy children displayed an absence of mature dendritic cells , but a similar display of bdca <dig> positive cells  compared with jdm.

vasculature remodelling in jdm patients
based on the array data, genes involved in vasculature remodelling, including the structural gene, smmhc , and regulatory factors, tenomodulin , prostaglandin e receptor  <dig> , plexin d <dig> , akt- <dig> , clusterin , and lpgds   <cit> , were significantly differentially expressed between patients with long and short duration of active disease, suggesting the involvement of vasculature remodelling during this period of time . in addition, matrix metalloproteinase  <dig>  and collagen viα <dig>  were also up-regulated indicating extracellular matrix remodelling, which is part of angiogenesis  <cit> . interestingly, most of these genes belonged to cluster f, in which genes were down-regulated more in patients with short duration of active disease when comparing to the baseline , suggesting that the expression changes of these specific genes were preferentially misregulated in the earlier stage of the inflammatory disease process.

using qrt-pcr, we confirmed the higher expression of  <dig> genes related to vascular remodelling in muscle biopsies of girls with longer disease duration compared with disease of short duration. the expression level of smooth muscle heavy chain myosin was elevated  <dig>  fold , clusterin was  <dig>  fold increased ; the level of plexin d <dig> was increased in the long duration group by  <dig>  fold , and tenomodulin was increased by  <dig>  fold,  .

a regression analysis was performed of  <dig> genes and  <dig> genes  were identified that had a statistically significant linear relationship between the level of gene expression and duration of active disease . both probe sets representing smmhc showed linear relationships, suggesting that the gene expression changes are dependent on the duration of the chronic inflammation of active disease.

discussion
impact of duration of untreated inflammation on clinical and laboratory findings in children with jdm
previous studies have confirmed the observation that prolonged duration of untreated symptoms in children with jdm are highly associated with the development of pathologic calcifications, one of the most debilitating complications of jdm  <cit> . untreated children with a longer duration of chronic symptoms had a higher frequency of loss of nailfold capillary end row loops  <cit> , which persisted after  <dig> months of therapy  <cit> . the chronic inflammation associated with nailfold capillary loss was accompanied by impaired absorption of orally administered corticosteroids  <cit> . in addition, chronic untreated inflammation at diagnosis of jdm was associated with severe bone loss and an abnormal osteoprotegerin: rankl ratio  <cit> . a study of  <dig> previously untreated children with jdm enrolled in a large national niams jdm research registry showed that the clinical presentation of the children with shorter duration of active jdm was quite different from those who came to diagnosis later in their disease course. children diagnosed early in the disease course were more likely to be weaker than later on, and muscle enzymes were more likely to be in the normal range 2– <dig>  months after the child's first symptom   <cit>  which may be associated with differential utilization of the trail apoptotic pathway  <cit> . in this study we used a  <dig> month cut-off and identified  <dig> genes differentially expressed in patients with short  and long  duration of active disease by expression profiling. identifying these changes provide insight concerning the observed differences in clinical phenotypes at the molecular level over time.

down regulation of genes involved in protein turnover and metabolism
down-regulation of protein turnover and stress response genes in skeletal muscles has been associated with muscular dystrophies and conditions associated with muscle atrophy  <cit> . in this study, genes involved in both protein turnover and stress responses were down-regulated significantly in patients with longer duration of active disease . the genes encoding heat shock proteins  and genes involved in proteasome functions  showed slight upregulation in the short duration group compared to controls, but approached the baseline in the long duration group, reflecting the acute phase of the disease. in contrast, genes involved in protein synthesis  were mildly downregulated in the short duration group and achieve significant down-regulation in the long duration group, suggesting continuous suppression of protein synthesis commonly associated with muscle atrophy. the changes at the molecular level support the observation of ongoing muscle loss in untreated patients with jdm. gene involved in er stress response have been previously reported to be differentially expressed in adults with inflammatory myopathies  <cit> . in our study, we did not observe significant differences between the groups, based on the duration of untreated disease.

dendritic cell infiltration
the presence of dendritic cells in the muscle of patients with dermatomyositis was previously reported  <cit> . recent investigation presented data showing that the localization and maturation of resident plasmacytoid dendritic cells in situ in the perivascular areas was essential to the initiation and perpetuation of muscle inflammation in juvenile dm  <cit> . the present study confirms that the typical pattern of dendritic cell infiltration  in jdm is a progressive process associated with persistent inflammation without focal infiltration in muscle of patients with short duration of active disease. many dc-lamp positive dendritic cells were positive for bdca <dig>  again confirming that they were of plasmacytoid dendritic cell lineage as recently reported  <cit> . dendritic cells are well characterized for efficient antigen presentation to t cells and are speculated to affect both tolerance and t cell activation  <cit> . models of autoimmunity through activated dendritic cells in rheumatoid arthritis and in systemic lupus erythematosus  associated with a type  <dig> ifn-α/β initiated response have been proposed by other investigators  <cit> . in addition, increased expression of ifnα/β induced genes have been identified in peripheral blood of children with sle, systemic onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and in jdm  <cit> . in this study, we found large number of dendritic cells in perivascular areas with dense mononuclear infiltrates in biopsies from children with longer duration of active disease, which suggested that dendritic cells might be actively involved in the progression of the disease by modulating t cells function in the muscle vasculature.

vasculature remodelling
vascular smooth muscle cells  are highly plastic capable of profound alterations in phenotype in response to changes in local environmental cues  <cit> . vascular injury initiates a transition in the phenotype of vascular smcs whereby "contractile"  smcs are capable of undergoing transient modification to a highly "synthetic"  state. these synthetic vascular smcs are migratory, highly proliferative, and play a critical role in repair of the vascular injury. upon resolution of the injury, smcs reacquire their contractile phenotype and associated markers, which include smooth muscle isoforms of contractile apparatus proteins such as smmhc  <cit> . in this study, we found clusterin, tenomodulin and prostaglandin e receptor  <dig> were down-regulated in jdm patients with short disease duration. in contrast, for children with longer duration of active disease, expression of these genes approached the baseline, and additional genes involved in vasculature remodelling were up-regulated, . these genes are associated with contractile  vascular smcs. these data suggest that early in the course of jdm, a relatively high proportion of vascular smcs at the site of inflammation are in a synthetic  state; conversely, as time passes and the inflammation becomes chronic, vascular smcs further differentiate. the linear regression relationship between the duration of active disease and the smmhc expression suggests that the vasculature remodelling in the muscles is a progressive process associated with disease chronicity and the duration of active disease. this is consistent with the documentation of evidence of cardiovascular compromise in older patients who had jdm in childhood  <cit> . among the genes involved in vasculature remodelling, plexin d <dig> and prostaglandin e receptor  <dig>  are two potent angiogenic factors  <cit> . plexin d <dig> is expressed in vascular endothelial cells of developing blood vessels. signalling between semaphorin 3e and its receptor plexin d <dig> controls endothelial cell positioning and the patterning of the vasculature during embryonic development, and can negatively regulate angiogenesis as well as activate t cells  <cit> . because the hallmark of jdm is occlusion and obliteration of capillaries and arterioles, it is not surprising that expression of tenomodulin is increased, for it is overexpressed in hypovascular connective tissue. the up-regulation of these genes might underlie the molecular mechanisms of the vasculature loss and remodelling we observed in the patients' muscles.

in summary, the findings from this study support the clinical observation that identification of the duration of the inflammatory process is a critical component in children with jdm, influencing both the gene expression and the pathophysiology of the immune responses in children with active symptoms. recognition of this variable, which identifies the chronicity of the process, is important in dissecting out factors involved in immune progression and response.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the duration of the chronic inflammatory process in untreated jdm alters mrna expression patterns, including both dendritic cell maturation and vascular remodelling with increased expression of anti-angiogenic factors. we propose that the duration of the inflammatory process must be considered when interpreting gene profiling data as well as clinical and laboratory findings in children with jdm in order to gain insight into potential modes of intervention. we speculate that interventions that diminish the antiangiogenic remodelling present in children with jdm who have a longer duration of untreated disease may be of benefit.
