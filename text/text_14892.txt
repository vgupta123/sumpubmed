BACKGROUND
in eukaryotic cells, the membrane compartments that constitute of the exocytic pathway are traversed by a constant flow of lipids and proteins. this is particularly true for the endoplasmic reticulum , the main "gateway of the secretory pathway"  <cit> , where biosynthesis of sterols, lipids, membrane-bound and soluble proteins, and glycoproteins occurs. maintenance of the resident proteins in this compartment implies they have to be distinguished from the secretory cargo. to this end, they must possess specific er localization determinants to prevent their exit from the er, and/or to interact with receptors responsible for their retrieval from the golgi apparatus. the tetrapeptide h/kdel is the best characterized signal contributing to the accumulation of most soluble protein in the er lumen  <cit> . specific recognition of this tetrapeptide sequence by the erd2-like receptor, in post-er compartments, initiates the formation of copi-coated vesicles, which transport the h/kdel-containing soluble proteins selectively from the golgi back to the er  <cit> .

retrieval mechanisms from the golgi to the er are also responsible for er location of some type i and ii transmembrane proteins, in animals cells by interaction with subunits of the copi machinery  <cit>  . indeed, sorting of er membrane residents depends on the specific interaction of motifs mainly located in their cytoplasmic tails. for instance, many type i membrane proteins located in the er bear a di-lysine motif kxx) in their c-terminal cytosolic tail  <cit> . in addition, the efficiency of a di-lysine motif for er localisation of transmembrane proteins in cells has also been described in mammals, yeasts and plants  <cit> , suggesting a conservation of the machinery. the di-lysine motifs can either act as direct retention signals or through a retrieval mechanism from the golgi often associated with the acquisition of golgi-specific carbohydrate modifications  <cit> . some sequence flexibility can be observed concerning the dibasic motif  <cit> , in particular, lysine residues within non-type i membrane proteins are sometimes substituted by arginine  <cit> . moreover, the amino acids  flanking the di-lysine motif are important; since serine or alanine residues generally favor efficient retention while the proximity of glycine or proline residues completely disrupts er retention capacity  <cit> . finally, di-lysine er-retention/retrieval signals require a strict spacing relative to the c-terminus  <cit> .

on the other hand, some er-resident membrane proteins contain a di-arginine motif acting as a retention/retrieval signal in animal cells. this motif is made of either two consecutive arginine residues located at position 2- <dig>  3- <dig>  4- <dig> with respect to the n-terminus of the protein or of arginine residues separated by an amino acid and located at position 2- <dig>  3- <dig>  this motif was first described in yeast for signal-mediated retrieval of type ii membrane proteins from the golgi to the er  <cit> . it is now generally admitted that di-arginine motifs are much more frequent than di-lysine motifs. they are found in a variety of cytosolic positions, including loops, at the c- and n- terminal end of type i and ii membrane proteins respectively  <cit> . like the di-lysine motif, the di-arginine motif efficiency is influenced by surrounding residues  <cit> . structural analysis of n-linked glycans revealed a golgi-to-er retrograde transport mechanism for er membrane glycoproteins containing a di-arginine motif indicating they act as er retrieval signals as described for most di-lysine motifs  <cit> .

several other motifs have occasionally been described for er retention of membrane proteins in eukaryotic cells. for instance the diphenylalanine  motif, present in type i proteins of the p <dig> family, is essential for copi coat protein interactions triggering golgi to er retrograde transport  <cit> . similarly, cosson et al.  <cit>  identified a new copi-binding motif containing a critical aromatic residue involved in er retrieval.

in addition to retrieval mechanisms, the strict retention of er-resident proteins has also been investigated. it was shown for sec12p , that the tmd is responsible for recycling whereas the cytosolic tail is involved in strict retention  <cit> . er residency by direct retention can be also accomplished by oligomerization of protein subunits into large complexes, via their transmembrane and/or the luminal domains  <cit> . it is important to note that both mechanisms, retention and retrieval, are not exclusive and can function either in parallel or in combination  <cit> .

in plants, few molecular signals responsible for protein residency in the er have been described  <cit> . for soluble proteins, k/hdel is largely predominant  <cit> . for type i membrane proteins, signals include c-terminal di-lysine motifs  <cit> , the aromatic aa-enriched er retrieval signal  <cit>  and the length of the tmd  <cit> . to our knowledge, so far, no information is available concerning signals responsible for type ii membrane protein residency in the plant er.

alpha-glucosidase i is the first enzyme involved in the n-glycan maturation. this glycosidase removes the distal α- <dig> -linked glucose residue from the oligosaccharide precursor, just after its transfer "en bloc" on the nascent protein. the function and consequently the location of this type ii membrane protein in the er is essential for plant development  <cit> .

in a previous study, we have shown that a. thaliana glucosidase i  is located exclusively in the er  <cit> . this localization is consistent with a trimming of the first glucose residue from the precursor oligosaccharide. here, the analysis of the n-terminus of this glycosidase has allowed the identification of two independent types of signals conferring er residency to a type ii membrane protein. thus, di-arginine-based motifs initially located in the cytosolic face of atgcsi are sufficient to confer er residency of a membrane reporter protein. as the presence of a second type of signal in the luminal part of atgcsi is also sufficient for er retention, we propose that the arginine-based motifs may act as salvage signals to localize the full-length protein in this compartment.

RESULTS
the cytosolic tail of atgcsi contains er targeting information
the cytosolic region of many membrane proteins residing in the mammalian and yeast er contains signals which facilitate either their strict retention in the er  <cit>  or their retrieval from the golgi to the er  <cit> . in plants, only very few studies refer to the characterization of cytosolic motifs responsible for membrane protein retention in the er  <cit> .

with the aim to identify a conserved er targeting motif in the cytosolic tails of the different gcsi cloned so far, we aligned their sequences . the size of gcsi cytosolic tail is very different from one species to another varying from  <dig> aa in neurospora crassa to  <dig> aa in oriza sativa. however, in each case, the cytosolic tail is very polar, arginine and lysine residues being largely represented. in particular, arginine blocks near the n-terminal end are identified in six out of twelve gcsi sequences. this block was shown to contain er trafficking information in human gcsi  <cit> .

atgcsi is an er type ii membrane protein, composed of a  <dig> aa cytosolic tail , a  <dig> aa transmembrane domain  and a large  <dig> aa c-terminal domain  oriented in the lumen of the er and containing the catalytic site  <cit>  . as illustrated , we have shown in a previous work that the first  <dig> aa  located at the n-terminal end of the atgcsi, are sufficient to retain a reporter protein in the er  <cit> . the atgcsi cytosolic domain of  <dig> aa contains six arginine residues including four arginines located at position  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and a doublet at the position  <dig>  relative to the n-terminal end.

to define more precisely the sequence in the cytosolic tail of atgcsi containing er location information, the first  <dig> aa located at the n-terminal end of gcs <dig> were deleted and the resulting chimeric protein was named Δ13gcs <dig> . this truncation removed potential dibasic motifs rr or rxr that might function in er localization  <cit> , while others  remained in the cytosolic tail of this fusion protein. when expressed in tobacco by- <dig> cells or leaf epidermal cells, Δ13gcs <dig> was found into bright spots  that colocalized with the golgi marker st-mrfp   <cit>  but no longer localized with the mrfp-hdel er marker . these results indicate that the first  <dig> aa of atgcsi are required for gcs <dig> accumulation in the er.

in order to determine whether this  <dig> aa peptide sequence affects the targeting a golgi-resident membrane protein, it was fused to the golgi marker xylt <dig> to give gcs13-xylt <dig> . as illustrated in figure 3d-f, xylt <dig> resides exclusively in the golgi apparatus and it was previously shown to preferentially accumulate in the medial golgi  <cit> . in contrast, gcs13-xylt <dig> was found as a bright network  that colocalized with the mrfp-hdel er marker  and was very similar to the pattern observed for gcs <dig> . in addition to this strong er labeling, a few bright spots were also occasionally observed when gcs13-xylt <dig> was expressed . these spots proved to be dynamic and colocalized partially with the late golgi marker st-mrfp  indicating location in the early golgi ,  <cit> .

in conclusions, we show here that the first  <dig> aa of atgcsi are necessary to retain the gcs <dig> fusion protein in the er and sufficient to relocate a medial golgi marker mainly to the er and to a lesser extent the early-golgi.

a cytosolic arginine-rich sequence is an er targeting signal in plants
in order to further investigate whether another arginine-rich sequence could replace the  <dig> n-terminal aa of atgcsi responsible for er retention, this peptide was replaced by the first  <dig> amino-terminal residues of human gcsi and the resulting fusion was named hs10Δ13gcs <dig> . after transient expression in tobacco leaf epidermal cells, hs10Δ13gcs <dig> localized in the er , thus demonstrating that the n-terminal arginine-rich cytosolic sequence of human gcsi is functional in plants. similarly, the c-terminal arginine-rich cytosolic tail of arabidopsis calnexin, a type i membrane protein changed the localization of the type ii Δ13gcs <dig> from the golgi to the er 

arginine residues in the cytosolic tail of atgcsi contain er localization information
in order to define whether arginine residues within the first  <dig> aa of gcs <dig> play a key role in er targeting, these residues were first replaced by either leucine or alanine residues using site-directed mutagenesis  and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in tobacco cells.

gcs <dig> is exclusively located in the er  and perfectly co-localizes with the er marker mrfp-hdel , but not with the late golgi marker st-mrfp . when arginine residues, in position  <dig>   <dig>  <dig> and  <dig>  were all replaced by alanine residues, gcs <dig> mutant  was found to accumulate exclusively in the golgi apparatus as illustrated from its co-localization with st-mrfp . the same effects on sub-cellular localization were observed for r/l gcs <dig> after substitution of the four arginine residues by leucines, . these observations indicate that four arginines in position 6-7- <dig> and  <dig> present in the cytosolic tail of atgcsi encode information necessary for er residency of membrane reporter protein.

to further dissect this cytosolic signal, an exhaustive pair-wise leucine scanning mutagenesis of all four arginine residues was performed and results related to the location of the mutants in tobacco leaf epidermal cells are summarized in table  <dig>  all mutations affected the localization of gcs <dig>  thus, r/l6-7gcs <dig> and r/l10-12gsc <dig> were found in the er  and in additional punctate structures  that appear distinct from golgi stacks . similar results were obtained for r/l6-12gcs <dig> . remarkably, the mrfp-hdel soluble and the gsc90-mrfp membrane er markers were excluded from these punctate structures . finally, constructs in which mutated arginine residues were distant by more than two aa  all displayed a strict golgi  or a dual golgi-er pattern . these findings indicate that a cytosolic rr or rxr or rxxr motif is sufficient to confer er residency to a membrane reporter protein.

towards the characterization of punctate structures labeled after arginine substitution
considering that fusion proteins harboring only one di-arginine motif: rr, rxr or rxxr accumulate in the er and in punctate structures associated with the golgi, the next challenge was to identify the nature of these fluorescent punctate structures from which the er markers are excluded. coexpression of r/l10-12gcs <dig> with an er and a golgi marker simultaneously, revealed that the punctate structures are closely associated but nevertheless distinct and smaller than golgi stacks . interestingly, units formed by association of one dictyosome and one punctate structure move together along the er and never dissociate . considering these observations, we propose that punctate structures are small intermediate domains located between the er and the golgi, from which er resident soluble or membrane proteins are excluded .

based on the observation that punctate structures are strongly associated with the golgi and move together with the golgi stacks along the er cortical network, we speculated first that they could correspond to er-exit-sites  initially described by dasilva et al.  <cit> .

it was previously shown that a gtp-locked form of sar1p accumulates to eres  <cit>  and exerts a dominant negative effect on protein secretion  <cit> . when sar1p-mrfp or sar1p-gtp-mrfp were expressed alone, they were both located to the cytoplasm and to the er  but the er morphology was different. indeed, sar1p gtp blocking er exit, r/lgcs <dig> was found in the er and in the golgi when expressed together with the gtp-locked form of sar1p , and, as a consequence, the er membranes turned into a lamellar sheet. in addition, sar1p-gtp-mrfp and gcs <dig> perfectly co-localised . to test if the small punctate structures were sensitive to an er exit blockage, r/l6-7gcs <dig> and r/l10-12gcs <dig> were co-expressed with sar1p-gtp-mrfp . interestingly, no punctate structures were observed showing that the presence of punctate structures depends on active copii machinery.

the drug bfa blocks copi-mediated retrograde transport. thus, if the punctate structures were sensitive to bfa, this would suggest they are likely to be involved in retrograde golgi to er traffic. to test this hypothesis, cells co-expressing r/l6-7gcs <dig> or r/l10-12gcs <dig> and mrfp-hdel were incubated for  <dig> h in the presence of bfa . in both cases, the er turned into a lamellar pattern and the punctate structures disappeared . as a control, we have observed bfa-induced redistribution of r/lgcs <dig> in the er . together, these results indicate that inhibition of copi-mediated retrograde transport by bfa abolishes the formation of punctate structures.

in conclusion, different gcs <dig> mutants harboring only one rr, rxr or rxxr motif accumulate in the er and in punctate structures that do not contain er soluble or membrane resident proteins, move together with the golgi, but are not formed in the presence of sar1p-gtp and disappear in the presence of bfa. based on these results, our hypothesis is that these punctate structures could be involved in golgi to er retrograde transport.

a luminal sequence in atgcsi also contains er retention information
we have shown above that cytosolic arginine-motifs are sufficient to confer er-residency to a golgi reporter protein and their removal changes the localization of gcs <dig> from the er to the golgi. however, we observed that the deletion of the first n-terminal  <dig> aa from the full-length sequence of atgcsi , does not modify the location of the atgcsi. the accumulation of Δ13gcsi in the er shows that the arginine motifs are not necessary for er residency of the full-length atgcsi protein and suggests that other er retention signals must exist.

after successive deletion at the c-terminal end of Δ13gcsi, we have shown that, in contrast with the golgi location of Δ13gcs <dig>  the Δ13gsc <dig> containing the first  <dig> aa of at gcsi minus the first  <dig> aa  is detected exclusively in the er . in order to identify the sequence responsible for er localisation of Δ13gcsi, the first  <dig> aa of the gcs <dig> were deleted and the resulting fusion protein  was expressed in n. tabacum leaf epidermal cells, where it was found exclusively in the er , and perfectly co-localized with mrfp-hdel . in contrast, in the same conditions, Δ13gcs <dig> was detected exclusively in the golgi apparatus . er-specific targeting information is therefore contained within the atgcsi luminal domain, between the pro  <dig> and cys <dig> 

to further investigate the er targeting capacity of its luminal domain, an  <dig> aa long peptide corresponding to the n-terminal part of atgcsi luminal domain  was fused at the c-terminal end of the medial-golgi marker xylt <dig> . a shorter  <dig> aa peptide corresponding to the luminal domain of atgcsi from pro <dig> to cys <dig>  was fused to xylt <dig> to generate xylt35-gcslum <dig> . both fusions were expressed in tobacco leaf epidermal cells. in agreement with its medial-golgi localization, xylt <dig> accumulated specifically in the golgi , whereas both xylt35-gcslum <dig> and xylt35-gcslum <dig>  where detected in the er . therefore, in addition to arginine-based motifs in its cytosolic tail, atgcsi contains additional information in its luminal domain from residues pro <dig> and cys  <dig> that is sufficient to confer er localization.

discussion
introduction of soluble or type i membrane proteins in the er, is mediated by a cleavable n-terminal signal peptide. then, er protein localization is governed by different signals and mechanisms. it is well documented that soluble er-resident proteins bear at their c-terminal end a h/kdel tetrapeptide that ensure their retrieval from the golgi apparatus to the er when they escape to this organelle  <cit> via the binding to a receptor named erd2-like  <cit>  located throughout golgi and in the er  <cit> . in contrast, molecular signals responsible for the targeting of type i membrane proteins in the er are not so well understood, especially in plant cells. for instance, a  <dig> aa tmd derived from human lysosomal protein lamp <dig> was shown to mediate retention of gfp in the er  <cit> . in addition, c-terminal dilysine motifs confer er localization to type i membrane proteins  <cit> . finally, a c-terminal Φxxk/r/d/eΦ motif  is necessary and sufficient for the localization of type iii membrane Δ <dig> oleate desaturase fad <dig> to the er  <cit> .

for type ii membrane proteins, the tmd acts as a non-cleavable signal sequence  and we have recently shown that in plant cell, the  <dig> aa tmd of soybean mannosidase i  is sufficient to retain gfp in the er and the cis-golgi whereas the  <dig> aa tmd of atgcsi is not responsible for the residency of this glucosidase in the er  <cit> . here we investigated the signals that mediate er localization of atgcsi, a type ii membrane enzyme playing a key role in seed development, as shown by characterization of the gcsi arabidopsis mutant which produces shrunken seeds where embryo development is blocked at the heart stage  <cit> .

a cytosolic di-arginine motifs is sufficient for er residency of a type ii membrane protein
based on the demonstration that the  <dig> first n-terminal aa of atgcs <dig> cytosolic sequence contain er targeting information , we have substituted the four arginine residues in the sequence mtagasrrsargri- with alanine or leucine residues. this mutation completely abolishes the er retention capacity of this sequence, as r/lgcs <dig> and r/agcs <dig> were found in the golgi, thus demonstrating the key role of arginine residues. in addition, this  <dig> aa peptide was sufficient to relocalize, the medial golgi marker xylt <dig> to the er when fused at its n-terminal end. a competition between the di-arginine motifs mediating er localization and the tmd length of xylt <dig> , more consistent with a golgi location, could explain why part of gcs13-xylt <dig> is also detected in the golgi apparatus.

in order to identify the minimal requirement for the er targeting motif, the four arginine residues were mutated in pairs and it was found that two arginine residues organized as rr, rxr or rxxr motif were sufficient to confer er residency. consequently, three distinct di-arginine motifs sufficient for er retention co-exist in the cytosolic tail of gcsi. in mammalian cells, n-terminal arginine residues were also shown to serve as er signals for some type ii membrane proteins  <cit> . for instance, the first  <dig> aa of human iip <dig>  target not only iip <dig> but also other type ii membrane proteins to the er and the minimal requirement for efficiency of this sequence is the presence of a diarginine rr or rxr motif  <cit> . on the other hand, in the first  <dig> aa of human gcsi , a triple arginine  carries er accumulation information  <cit> . finally, a comparison of the gcsi sequences available has shown that di-arginine motifs at the n-terminal end of these er resident proteins are highly conserved   <cit> .

in mammals, arginine-rich or di-lysine er-localization signals require a strict spacing relative to the n/c terminus and from the membrane.  <cit> . this could also explain why, too close to the transmembrane domain of atgcsi, the rr motif at position  <dig>  does not confer er localization . a similar situation was described when a deleted version of a. thaliana mannosidase ii  containing a  <dig> aa cytosolic tail  was targeted to the golgi only, despite an rxr motif in the sequence  <cit> . these examples suggest that position of the di-arginine motif relative to the n-terminal end and/or the tmd is certainly important to consider in plants too.

interestingly, in mammalian cells, in contrast to kk-signals, functional arginine-rich signals are found in a variety of cytosolic positions, including intracellular loops and the n- and c- termini in type ii and type i membrane proteins, respectively  <cit> . here, we have identified a sequence similar to the gcsi arginine-rich sequence, in the c-terminal cysosolic tail of the type i membrane protein a. thaliana calnexin   <cit>  and we have shown that this sequence has the capacity to relocate a type ii golgi protein to the er. these results are consistent with previous data showing that the last  <dig> c-terminal aa of calnexin, including a  <dig> aa ct, a  <dig> aa tmd and  <dig> aa in the lumen, were sufficient to target gfp to the er  <cit> . all together these results suggest that cytosolic arginine-rich motifs might have a similar role for residency of type ii and some type i er membrane proteins in the er of plant cells.

the luminal domain of atgcsi also contains er targeting information
while performing successive deletions in order to identify a minimal er targeting sequence in atgcsi, we have observed that when the  <dig> n-terminal aa were removed from the full length protein, Δ13gcsi was still located in the er. this result clearly shows that the arginine-rich cytosolic tail is not the only er determinant in atgcsi. a series of deletions at the c-terminal end of Δ13gcsi led us to identify a luminal sequence containing er targeting information. when fused to xylt <dig>  a  <dig> aa luminal sequence from pro <dig> to cys <dig> of atgcsi is able to almost perfectly relocate this medial golgi marker into the er. this is the first time that an er localization signal is shown to be contained in the luminal domain of a plant membrane protein. as mentioned above, the golgi labeling occasionally observed with this fusion protein might be due to a competition between the er localization sequence from atgcsi and the tmd length of xylt <dig> more adapted to golgi than er location.

as shown here for atgcsi, some mammalian and yeast membrane proteins also contain two er retention/retrieval signals  <cit> . for instance, in human gcsi, the ct bears a triple-arginine er-targeting motif and the luminal domain contains an er retention domain which is yet to be characterized  <cit> . in conclusion, at least for er resident membrane proteins, the presence of several sequences containing er targeting information seems to be common. interestingly, different motifs also probably suggest a hierarchy of these signals and different targeting mechanisms and the importance for those proteins to be kept securely in the er.

several mechanisms participate to atgcsi retention in the er
in mammalian cells, studies have shown that both retrieval and retention mechanisms govern the localization of er membrane proteins  <cit> . of these two mechanisms, retrieval is better understood, and retrieval signals have been identified in the cytosolic tails of type i and type ii er resident membrane proteins  <cit> . in plants, very few data are available on retrieval of er membrane proteins. contreras et al.  <cit>  have shown that a kk motif in the c-terminal cytoplasmic tail of type i p <dig> protein is able to interact with components of the copi machinery and to recruit arf <dig> in vitro. mccartney et al.  <cit>  have highlighted a dominant negative mutant of arf <dig> affect the transient localisation in the golgi of a chimera protein containing a -ynnkl motif in its cytoplasmic tail. however, mechanisms by which membrane proteins containing an arginine motif are targeted to the er remain to be investigated. gcs <dig> and derivated constructs appear as excellent tools to study these mechanisms in plant cell.

the situation is complicated by the fact that retrieval mediated by arginine or lysine-motifs involves distinct machinery. for instance, a mammalian α-copi isoform interacts with the kkxx motif but not with the rxr motif  <cit>  and there is also evidence suggesting a copi-independent er retrieval pathway  <cit> . on the other hand, some membrane proteins, such as the type ii membrane protein sec12p are retrieved by interaction of their tmd with the receptor rer1p  <cit> . thus, the questions concerning distinct protein sorting machineries and/or mechanisms for the different er retrieval motifs remain to be addressed.

in addition to retrieval, a mechanism of retention sensu stricto has been described, especially for soluble er residents. indeed, it is now generally accepted that soluble reticuloplasmins are retained in the er lumen of mammalian cells mainly by a mechanism of strict retention. however, when they escape this first mechanism, the er resident proteins are retrotransported from the golgi back to the er by a second mechanism involving a h/kdel c-terminal sequence and a membrane receptor named erd <dig>  some data are also in favor of the presence of these two mechanisms to explain retention of reticuloplasmins in the plant er  <cit> .

although one could argue that er retention is due to the absence of positive signals required for an efficient er exit  <cit> , it is likely that specific retention signals or features are also necessary to prevent massive access of er-resident membrane proteins into forward carriers  <cit> .

er retention of type i and type ii membrane proteins can be accomplished by direct association of protein subunits to give large oligomeric complexes via their tmd and/or luminal domain, as previously described in the kin-recognition model for golgi-located membrane proteins  <cit> . this type of mechanism may be functional in the er retention of subunit components of the hetero-oligomeric oligosaccharyltransferase complex  <cit> . when expressed in cos cells, er targeting information in the luminal domain of human gcsi appears to direct er localization by retention rather than by retrieval. evidence includes the fact that n-linked man9-glcnac <dig> is the major glycan released from the recombinant enzyme  <cit> . on the other hand, the co-purification of α-glucosidase i from either bovine mammary glands or calf liver with a large 320- <dig> kda protein complex is consistent with homotetramer formation responsible for er retention  <cit> .

although there is now evidence that both protein retrieval and retention mechanisms operate at the er-golgi interface, the question concerning the relative roles played by these different mechanisms in determining the residency of er membrane proteins is still largely unresolved. the following targeting model could be put forward for atgcsi. we have shown that, at least, two er localization signals are present in atgcsi and we propose that these signals correspond to different targeting mechanisms. as illustrated figure  <dig>  atgcsi would form homo- or heterooligomers  that are excluded from er domains where eres are formed. when atgcsi monomers escaping these large complexes, are transported by default simultaneously with membrane proteins containing export signals to the golgi via a copii-mediated transport, atgcsi molecules arriving in the cis-golgi interact with putative di-arginine specific receptors mediating their copi-dependent retrotransport to the er. the presence of punctate structures in some of the gcsi mutants is also in favor of an arginine-based retrieval.

preliminary evidence for golgi-er exit sites 
in contrast to mammalian cells, transport of proteins in plants between the er and the golgi does not rely on the cytoskeleton but nevertheless requires energy and is regulated by various proteins such as the gtpases sar <dig> and arf <dig>  <cit> . forward transport of proteins is initiated in specific regions of the er membrane called eres  that were visualized using fluorescent protein fusions to plant homologues of the proteins involved in the copii-coat formation in mammalian cells, for instance sar <dig>  <cit> , sec <dig>  <cit> , sec <dig>  <cit>  and sec <dig>  <cit> . very recently, eres were shown to be induced not only by membrane cargo but also by specific exit sequences  <cit> . regarding atgcsi, when one out of the three di-arginine motifs is present in the cytosolic tail of a gcs <dig>  fluorescence is detected not only in the er but also in punctate structures close to- and moving with the golgi stacks along er tracks. both soluble and membrane er markers are excluded from these punctate structures. we propose that they correspond to a golgi/er intermediate compartment. interestingly, we have shown that punctate structures do not colocalize with sar <dig> wt and are not observed in the presence of sar1p-gtp. however, as expected, sar1p-gtp-mrfp exerts a dominant negative effect on protein secretion and retains the golgi construct r/lgcs <dig> in the er, showing that er exit of r/lgcs <dig> is copii-regulated, as it was previously shown for many other membrane or soluble proteins  <cit> . moreover, in our expression system, punctate structures disappeared in the presence of bfa. in the same way, bfa prevented cargo-induced recruitment of sar1p-yfp at the eres   <cit> . it remains to be elucidated whether is due to the loss of golgi stacks or blockage of er exit sites, the fact that punctate structures could not be seen after bfa treatment. however, these results strongly support that the punctate structures are involved in golgi to er traffic, therefore we propose that those structures that do not colocalize with sar <dig> as described for eres, could well be golgi-er export sites .

CONCLUSIONS
arabidopsis alpha glucosidase i  is the first enzyme involved in the n-glycan maturation. we have previously shown that the function and consequently the location of this type ii membrane protein in the er is essential for arabidopsis development  <cit> .

as illustrated figure  <dig>  we have identified two independent types of signals conferring er residency in the atgcsi sequence. three distinct di-arginine motifs co-existing in the cytosolic tail of atgcsi and a  <dig> aa luminal sequence are independently sufficient for er retention. interestingly, the presence of these different types of signals suggests that both retrieval and retention mechanisms govern the localization of atgcsi in the er membrane. when only one out of the three di-arginine motifs is present, atgcsi accumulates not only in the er but also in punctate structures not yet characterised at the er/golgi interface and tentatively named geres. we hypothesised that geres correspond to golgi to er export sites involved at least in arginine-based retrieval mechanisms from the golgi back to the er.
