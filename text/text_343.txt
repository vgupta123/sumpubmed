BACKGROUND
podoplanin represents a type i integral membrane protein of the mucin-type family. its  <dig> aa protein core is extensively o-glycosylated, which results in a doubling of the molecular weight up to  <dig> kda. the podoplanin mrna was identified for the first time in the murine osteoblastic cell line mc3t3-e <dig>  <cit> , and later it was found to be expressed in murine colon carcinoma and melanoma cells  <cit> , in the stromal cells of peripheral lymphoid tissue  <cit> , in skeletal muscle, heart, placenta, lung, skin, bone and brain  <cit> . podoplanin has also been detected in the ciliary epithelium of the eye  <cit> , in transformed epidermal keratinocytes and fibroblasts  <cit>  and in the choroid plexus and neuronal cells of the cns  <cit> . in our lab, podoplanin has been discovered as a membrane protein of glomerular epithelial cells, which was found to be downregulated in puromycin nephrosis and caused a flattening of podocytes, hence its designation "podoplanin"  <cit> . moreover, podoplanin has been found in endothelia of lymphatic vessels  <cit>  and has been established as a discrimination marker between lymphatic  and blood endothelial cells   <cit> . the widespread localization of podoplanin has lead to a multiplicity of synonyms for its expression forms of human, murine and rat origin: murine ots- <dig>  <cit> , gp <dig>  <cit> , t1α  <cit> , pa <dig>  antigen  <cit> , randam- <dig>  <cit>  or aggrus  <cit> , rat e <dig> antigen  <cit>  or rti <dig>  <cit> , and human gp <dig>  <cit> .

the exact biological function of podoplanin remains controversial and seems to be versatile. though its highly abundant expression in a multiplicity of tissues, distinct cell-specificities and functions have been described. in the lung, podoplanin has been shown to be restricted to type i lung alveolar cells  <cit> , where it also functions as the main receptor for influenza c virus  <cit> . also quite early, podoplanin has been described as a platelet aggregating factor in murine and human colon carcinoma  <cit>  and murine melanoma  <cit> . podoplanin/t1α deficiency in mice lead to disruption of normal lymphatic vasculature formation and development of lymphedema  <cit> . moreover, podoplanin has been demonstrated to bind chemokines in the lymphatic vessels of renal transplants  <cit>  and to promote cell motility by downregulating e-cadherin expression in oral squamous cell carcinomas  <cit> . recent studies, therefore, have focussed on its potential role as a key player in tumour vessel formation  <cit>  and as a tumour progression factor in skin  <cit>  and germ line carcinomas  <cit> . podoplanin becomes upregulated in cells of the invasive cancer front, where it induces filopodia formation and promotes tumour cell migration  <cit> .

rat podoplanin/e <dig> has been reported to be a marker for late steps in the differentiation pathway of the osteoblastic lineage, being expressed by mature osteoblasts and newly formed osteocytes  <cit> . the human osteosarcoma cell lines mg <dig> and saos- <dig> used in this study represent differentiated late stage osteoblasts, nonetheless showing different degrees of maturation. whereas mg <dig> cells exhibit a premature fibroblast-like state, saos- <dig> cells display an epithelial phenotype and appear more rounded  <cit> . podoplanin/e <dig> was detected in a restricted subset of osteoblastic cells which is in direct contact with bone matrix, suggesting a functional role as an anti-adherent molecule according to its high sialic acid content. nevertheless, the function of podoplanin in the bone is unknown.

despite considerable progress that has been made in describing the expression pattern of podoplanin under normal and various pathological conditions, little is known about the mechanisms leading to the widespread gene activity of podoplanin. due to its certain specificities and potential role in tumour progression, the regulation of pdpn gene expression is of high interest. in an early study, podoplanin/ots- <dig> could be induced by phorbolester in the mouse osteoblastic cells mc3t3-e <dig>  <cit> , and therefore it was defined as a target gene for early response proteins. however, the molecular mechanism underlying podoplanin expression in osteoblasts remains largely unclear. in rat alveolar type i cells, sp <dig> elements and a thyroid transcription  factor site have been identified as essential for transcriptional activation of podoplanin/t1α  <cit> . in lymphatic endothelial cells, podoplanin/t1α is an early responder to the lymphatic-specific master regulator prox- <dig>  <cit> , and recently, podoplanin expression was shown to be under control of endogenously produced il- <dig> in human lymphatic endothelial precursor cells  <cit> . however, no direct cis- and trans-acting regulatory elements involved in cell-specific upregulation of human podoplanin have been elucidated so far.

in this study, we demonstrate a cell-specific difference between mg <dig> and saos- <dig> cells in the binding of nuclear proteins to sequences immediately adjacent and more distal to the transcription start site of the pdpn promoter. we identify four sp1/sp <dig> binding-sites inside a  <dig> bp element upstream of the pdpn gene and establish that two of them mediate basal transcription in mg <dig> cells, whereas saos- <dig> cells seem to lack sufficient amounts of nuclear sp1/sp <dig> for pdpn promoter activation. we show that these two functional sp-binding sites may involve further activator elements. moreover, we assess the functional hierarchy of another regulatory system, the chromatin modification, which is strongly altered in mg <dig> versus saos- <dig> cells distal of the core promoter and leads to enhanced expression of podoplanin.

RESULTS
podoplanin mrna expression in the human osteoblastic cell lines mg <dig> and saos-2
to identify cell lines which are positive for podoplanin expression, reverse transcription pcrs were performed with a series of human cell lines of different origin . the osteoblastic osteosarcoma cell line mg <dig> exhibited a strong rt-pcr signal, whereas saos- <dig> osteosarcoma cells lacked it. this result was confirmed by real-time pcr analyses showing that mg <dig> cells contained three logs more podoplanin mrna transcripts than saos- <dig> cells. while in mg <dig> cells the podoplanin mrna population represented approximately 3% of gapdh mrna population, it made up just  <dig> % in saos- <dig> cells . a northern blot analysis revealed the presence of two podoplanin transcript variants in mg <dig> cells . a  <dig>  kb transcript corresponding to the full length mrna was seen, and a shorter species was detected at  <dig>  kb. as determined by 3' race analysis using mg63-derived cdna, this short mrna species represented a transcriptional variant ending after a cryptic polya-signal at bp  <dig> of the  <dig> bp 3'-utr .

reverse transcription pcr applying a series of nine ascending 5' primers suggested that in mg <dig> cells, podoplanin mrna was initiated at multiple sites mostly located between bp - <dig> and + <dig> of the 5'-flanking region . in 5' race experiments using mg63-derived cdna, the 5'-length of mrna transcripts and their frequency of occurrence was determined. the positions and frequencies of cdna variants derived from 5' race analysis are summarized in fig. 1e. the major transcription start site of podoplanin mrna was allocated to the position designated + <dig> .

isolation and structural analysis of the human pdpn promoter
the human pdpn gene 5' flanking region was isolated by pcr amplifications from a genomic bac clone and subsequent staggered cloning. when comparing the isolated promoter sequence with the human chromosome  <dig> sequence, sequence identity was confirmed despite a single base difference at bp - <dig> . dna sequence analysis using the transfac database showed that the 5' flanking region lacked a consensus tata box, whereas a gata box  was localized  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the main mrna transcription initiation site . the pdpn gene 5'-flanking region was characterized by a high gc content and revealed the existence of several potential sp <dig> transcription factor sites. moreover, putative binding sites for the basic transcription factors ap- <dig>  ap- <dig>  c/ebp, and nf- <dig>  but not for osteoblast-specific factors were detected along the isolated pdpn promoter sequence .

the pdpn promoter is transcriptionally regulated in mg <dig> and saos- <dig> cells
genomic dna sequencing of the promoter sequence in saos- <dig> cells confirmed that lack of pdpn transcription was not due to deletion mutations . thus, mg <dig> and saos- <dig> cells proved to be a suitable cell system for investigation of transcriptional podoplanin regulation. to assess which portions of the promoter were involved in regulation of podoplanin expression, reporter plasmids harboring progressive deletions from the 5' end of the bp -1885/+ <dig> pdpn flanking region were set according to putative binding sites of transcription factors . the sixteen promoter fragments were inserted upstream of a luciferase reporter gene  and were evaluated in transient expression analyses. luciferase transcription was consistently  <dig> times more active in mg <dig> than in saos- <dig> cells . in mg <dig> cells, bp -1104/+ <dig> construct provided highest promoter activity , whereas saos- <dig> cells exhibited highest normalized luciferase activity with bp -498/+ <dig> construct . transcriptional activity diminished progressively with further deletion of the 5' region, showing three activity minima with the constructs bp -666/+ <dig>  -261/+ <dig> and -76/+ <dig> in mg <dig> cells, and with constructs bp -186/+ <dig> and -76/+ <dig> in saos- <dig> cells, which indicated the loss of positive regulatory elements . the low promoter activity of the smallest bp -26/+ <dig> construct in both cell lines suggested that the  <dig> bp spanning 5'-utr of podoplanin mrna was not involved in upregulation of promoter activity. these data showed that the  <dig> bp 5' region contained motifs providing basic pdpn promoter activity, whereas rather silencing motifs bound to the more upstream bp -1885/- <dig> region.

nuclear proteins of mg <dig> and saos- <dig> cells bind to the pdpn promoter
to more precisely define cis-acting dna sequences responsible for cell-type specific pdpn transcription, seven overlapping dna probes encompassing bp - <dig> to + <dig> of the pdpn promoter  were used for in vitro dnasei footprinting assays. with mg <dig> nuclear extracts, eight protected regions, fp <dig> – fp <dig>  were identified with five probes , while probes eb and sb exhibited no differential dnasei digestion pattern . complexes fp <dig>  fp <dig> and fp <dig> were detected on both the coding and the noncoding dna strand , and footprinting region fp <dig> became also visible with saos- <dig> nuclear extracts . moreover, digestional modified regions flanking the protected regions emerged along the probes , additionally indicating the presence of dna-binding proteins.

to determine whether the detected elements indeed bound nuclear proteins, gel shift assays were performed using eight double stranded dna oligonucleotides spanning the dnase i footprint regions . probes alone produced no shifted bands . probes fp <dig>  fp <dig>  fp <dig> and fp <dig> produced a similar pattern of low-mobility dna-protein binding  when adding nuclear extract of mg <dig> cells . the same bands became faintly visible with saos- <dig> extracts except for probe fp <dig>  which did not show complexes i and ii. consistent with the footprints, oligos fp <dig> and fp <dig> bound nuclear proteins strongly from mg <dig>  but weak from saos- <dig> cells . although covering a broad footprint region, probe fp <dig> only yielded a binding pattern of several rapidly migrating proteins, and fp <dig> and fp <dig> did not reveal significant dna-protein complexes .

specificity of the gel shifted bands was demonstrated by competition assays in which nuclear extracts were preincubated with a 100-molar excess of unlabeled specific  or unrelated probe  as competitor. as all bands of the gel shifts were eliminated or attenuated by excess of unlabeled probe, these moieties may bind the respective oligos in a manner requiring concomitant association. a computer analysis revealed consensus motifs for transcription factors nf- <dig> , c/ebp-α , hnf- <dig> , oct- <dig>  and ap- <dig>  in the applied probes. however, a panel of antibodies against these factors did not interfere with the observed low molecular weight dna-protein complexes in supershift assays . nonetheless, these data suggested the presence of several sequence-specific proteins bound to the proximal pdpn promoter in mg <dig> cells.

sp proteins bind to fp <dig>  fp <dig>  fp <dig> and fp1in the pdpn promoter
probes fp <dig>  fp <dig>  fp <dig> and fp <dig> contained gc-rich regions exhibiting high homology to the consensus sp1-binding motif. to test the binding of sp-proteins to these elements, supershift analyses with anti-sp <dig> and anti-sp <dig> antibodies were performed. when anti-sp <dig> antibody was added, complex i disappeared in favor of a supershifted band, which showed the predominant contribution of sp <dig> . addition of anti-sp <dig> antibody blocked protein-dna binding, which resulted in loss of complex ii, whereas no supershifted complex appeared . when used together, sp <dig> and sp <dig> antibodies supershifted or inhibited both complexes . to further test whether the core sp <dig> sequence was required for binding of nuclear proteins, gel shift assays with the same oligonucleotide probes, but mutated at residues known to be critical for sp-binding , were performed with nuclear extracts of mg <dig> cells. the mutant oligos failed to form the observed complexes, indicating that the chosen mutations were sufficient to eliminate the binding capacities of these sites . these studies demonstrated that four elements within the pdpn promoter, herewith designated sp. <dig> – sp. <dig>  bound sp1/sp <dig> proteins from mg <dig> and also weakly from saos- <dig> cells. the results furthermore indicated that sp <dig> and sp <dig> were not bound coordinately to the dna stretches, since the anti-sp <dig> antibody did not shift sp3-dna complexes and vice versa. this suggested that sp <dig> and sp <dig> occupied the same or overlapping sites of the pdpn promoter.

gc boxes sp. <dig> and sp. <dig> are essential for pdpn promoter activity
to assess the functional role of sp binding elements sp. <dig> – sp. <dig>  pcr-directed mutagenesis was performed at the same residues that had blocked sp1/sp <dig> binding in gel shift assays and were tested for their reporter activity. the four sp binding sites were altered individually and in combination , and mutations were introduced into the promoter luciferase variant -857/+ <dig> that supported basal pdpn transcription. the transactivation pattern was similar for mg <dig> and saos- <dig> cells, indicating that sp1/sp <dig> promotion took place through the same elements in both cell lines . the utmost relevance was seen for sp-binding site sp. <dig> at bp -100/- <dig>  showing an activity reduction by 73% in mg <dig> and by 52% in saos- <dig> cells upon mutation. deletion of sp-binding site sp. <dig> at bp -700/- <dig> decreased luciferase activity by 57% in mg <dig> and by 16% in saos- <dig> cells, whereas mutation of sp-binding site sp. <dig>  did not alter luciferase activity substantially. mutation of site sp. <dig>  lead to a slight activating trend, while combined mutation of all four sites reduced activity to more than 80% in both cell lines. taken together, these data suggested that sp-binding sites sp. <dig> and sp. <dig> alone, but especially in concert, were central regulatory elements necessary for constitutive pdpn promoter activity in both mg <dig> and saos- <dig> cells, whereas sp. <dig> and sp. <dig> provided no single activating importance.

stimulatory sp <dig> and repressive sp <dig> coordinatively activate the pdpn promoter
to directly confirm the effect of sp <dig> and sp <dig> on pdpn promoter activation, bp -857/+ <dig> wild-type promoter luciferase construct was cotransfected with increasing amounts of cmv-promoter driven sp <dig> and sp <dig> expression plasmids alone and in combination into mg <dig> and saos- <dig> cells . in both cell types, sp <dig> overexpression resulted in a weak but dose dependent stimulation of luciferase activity with  <dig> -fold induction in mg <dig> and  <dig> -fold induction in saos- <dig> cells relative to sp <dig> mock-transfected cells. similarly, sp <dig> overexpression lead to a  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold induction in mg <dig> and saos- <dig> cells, respectively. when both factors were coexpressed, no further activation above  <dig> -fold promoter activity was seen. in contrast, luciferase activity of the combined mutational variant sp.4-1mut was not altered in these experiments. these results suggested that sp <dig> and sp <dig> were able to stimulate pdpn transcription through sp1/sp <dig> binding sites in the proximal promoter region independently.

to confirm the effect of sp <dig> and sp <dig> on the activity of endogenous pdpn gene expression in mg <dig> and saos- <dig> cells, real-time pcr was performed after transfection with sp1- and sp3-expression plasmids. the results corresponded to the observed potency of the respective factors to stimulate promoter activity. podoplanin mrna contents were clearly increased by overexpressed sp <dig> and sp <dig> . overexpression of both, sp <dig> and sp <dig>  did not further change mrna levels in mg <dig> cells but strongly increased them in saos- <dig> cells. these results showed that sp <dig> and sp <dig> indeed were able to upregulate podoplanin expression.

the roles of sp1/sp <dig> function on the pdpn promoter were more clearly established in drosophila sl <dig> cells, which lack endogenous sp-proteins. drosophila-specific ppac-sp <dig> and ppac-sp <dig> expression plasmids were cotransfected with the wild-type and sp-site mutant promoter variant sp.4-1mut  and fold promoter activation versus ppac-empty transfections was evaluated. cotransfection of sp <dig> lead to a 16-fold luciferase activity increase of the wild-type promoter. in contrast to the results seen with mg <dig> and saos- <dig> cells, overexpression of sp <dig> reduced promoter activity 8-fold, which discovered a strong repressive action of solely present sp <dig>  nevertheless, coexpression of both, sp <dig> and sp <dig>  further increased promoter activity up to 21-fold. since sp <dig> activity was not decreased in the presence of ppac-sp <dig>  sp <dig> seemingly did not compete with sp <dig> for binding to the same site. the same effects were visible on a reduced level with mutant variant sp.4-1mut and pgl3-basic, indicating background activity of these constructs. basically, these results suggested opposed action of single sp <dig> or sp <dig> on the pdpn promoter, while presence of both factors caused a concerted activation.

mutation of site sp. <dig> at bp -48/- <dig>  showed a slight increase in promoter activity , which corresponded to lowered activity of bp -76/+ <dig> versus bp -38/+ <dig> deletion construct . in order to explore a potential repressive role of sp <dig> on this site, reporter constructs bp -76/+ <dig> and -38/+ <dig> were cotransfected with sp <dig> and sp <dig> expression plasmids and the multiple of promoter activation was determined . consistently with luciferase reporter assays , construct -38/+ <dig> conferred a roughly 2-fold higher promoter activity than -76/+ <dig> in both cell lines . sp <dig> activated both constructs up to  <dig> -fold in both cell lines. consistent with the overexpression studies shown in fig. 6a, sp <dig> overexpression did not exert repressive effects on the bp -76/+ <dig> construct. in mg <dig> cells, activity of the bp -76/+ <dig> construct was not altered by additional sp3-overexpression, while it even increased in saos- <dig> cells. therefore, we were not able to demonstrate a repressive sp <dig> action on site sp. <dig>  we rather suggest a suppressive interaction of sp-proteins bound to sp. <dig> in combination with another yet unknown factor located more downstream from bp - <dig>  which is abolished through shortening of the promoter or by deletion mutation of site sp. <dig>  a more detailed analysis of this site will be of future interest.

conclusively, these results clearly demonstrated the pivotal importance of sp <dig> and the auxiliary importance of sp <dig> for basal transactivation of the pdpn promoter.

saos- <dig> cells exhibit reduced nuclear sp protein levels and low sp protein amounts bound to the pdpn promoter in vivo
to further clarify the transcriptional difference between mg <dig> and saos- <dig> cells, we focussed on the observation that nuclear extracts of saos- <dig> cells produced weak sp1/sp <dig> emsa signals compared to those derived with mg <dig> extracts . a comparative western blot analysis showed little difference in overall sp1/sp <dig> protein contents between mg <dig> and saos- <dig> cells , whereas nuclear sp <dig> and sp <dig> amounts were lowered about  <dig> and 88%, respectively, in saos- <dig> versus mg <dig> cells .

in order to assess whether sp proteins bound to the identified dna stretches in vivo, chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed using antibodies against sp <dig> and sp <dig> and crosslinked chromatin from mg <dig> and saos- <dig> cells . after immunoprecipitation with anti-sp <dig> antibody, extensive pcr amplifications from the sp-binding sites relative to control input dna were seen with mg <dig> derived chromatin . in contrast, saos- <dig> cells exhibited weak amplification levels versus input dna , which indicated low sp <dig> occupation of these positions. pcrs from anti-sp <dig> antibody precipitated chromatin resulted in overall weaker amplification results , which corresponded to the low dna-bound sp <dig> amounts seen in emsas . site sp. <dig> was stronger occupied by sp <dig> in mg <dig> than in saos- <dig> cells, while in both cell types site sp. <dig> was scarcely occupied by sp <dig>  sites sp. <dig> and sp. <dig> were acquainted with sp <dig> to an equal, yet moderate extent in both cell lines. these data raised the possibility that drastically reduced nuclear sp protein concentrations were responsible for weak pdpn promoter activity in saos- <dig> compared to mg <dig> cells.

the pdpn promoter is strongly methylated in mg <dig> but not in saos- <dig> cells
to further unravel the transcriptional difference between podoplanin expression in mg <dig> and saos- <dig> cells, epigenetic effects were considered. the pdpn promoter contained a high cg content which provided putative methylation sites. correspondingly, two cpg islands were detected  <cit> , one encompassing bp -183/+ <dig> that spanned the core promoter, and the other stretching from bp + <dig> to + <dig>  including exon  <dig>  plus  <dig> bp of intron  <dig> . a psti genomic dna-fragment that covered bp - <dig> to + <dig> of the pdpn promoter and gene was used to analyze a potential methylation-sensitive restriction pattern. the fragment contained  <dig> palindromic cpg dinucleotides, sixteen of which represented isoschizomeric hpaii/mspi restriction sites accumulating in three clusters. five southern blotting probes were situated beside and between these clusters . digestion of genomic dna with psti alone produced the anticipated  <dig> bp fragment , and double-digestion with psti plus methylation-insensitive enzyme mspi yielded the smallest possible fragments  . when using psti together with methylation-sensitive hpaii, complete digested bands were observed with saos- <dig> derived genomic dna, while in mg <dig> cells the distal probes p/b and f2/k mainly detected undigested  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb bands besides small portions of complete digested fragments . moreover, with probe f5/bs only the digestion resistant  <dig>  kb fragment was visible. these results indicated strong methylation of region bp -2799/- <dig> in mg <dig> cells, while it was totally unmethylated in saos- <dig> cells.

to clarify the pdpn promoter methylation status in mg <dig> cells in detail, genomic dna was analyzed by bisulfite sequencing. genomic dna was treated with sodium bisulfite under conditions where cytosines are converted to uracils, while methylated cytosines remain unmodified  <cit> . three pcr reactions were set to inspect the methylation level of the hpaii/mspi restriction site clusters . when pcr <dig>  was considered, the methylation level was found to be less than 5%. with pcr <dig> , except cpg sites  <dig> and  <dig> that were methylated to 25% and 50%, respectively, all cpg sites were fully methylated. pcr <dig>  comprised three cpg sites, which were highly  or fully  methylated. the observed methylation pattern corresponded to the fragmentation results seen in southern blotting and identified a highly methylated dna status of the pdpn promoter upstream of bp - <dig> in mg <dig> cells.

methylation of gc boxes sp. <dig> and sp. <dig> does not affect sp-protein binding
in mg <dig> cells, the heavy methylation pattern stretched accross functional sp1/sp <dig> binding site sp. <dig> , whereas binding site sp. <dig> was situated in the virtually unmethylated proximal promoter region . to test whether this situation gave rise to modulatory binding of sp-proteins, we compared the capabilities of respective oligos fp <dig>  and fp <dig>  to inhibit the formation of sp1-/sp3-dna complexes with nuclear extracts of mg <dig> cells in methylated as well as unmethylated form. as shown in fig. 9a, protein-dna complexes were competed by increasing concentrations of both, methylated and unmethylated forms of probes fp <dig> and fp <dig> to an equal extent. these data suggested that sp binding sites sp. <dig> and sp. <dig> were able to interact with sp1/sp <dig> even when methylated.

distal promoter methylation enhances pdpn promoter activity
to further test the role of dna methylation and histone acetylation for control of podoplanin expression in vivo, mg <dig> and saos- <dig> cells were treated with methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine  and histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin a . cell viability was tested by increasing concentrations of the agents over a cultivation period of  <dig> days to exclude mrna downregulation effects upon apoptosis. then, cells were treated either with 5-azacdr and tsa alone or with 5-azacdr followed by tsa, and podoplanin mrna amounts were analyzed by quantitative northern blot analysis. in saos- <dig> cells, the drugs were not able to initiate de novo synthesis of podoplanin mrna , which demonstrated that lack of pdpn transcription was not under epigenetic control. in mg <dig> cells, variations of both podoplanin mrna bands seen in northern blot were evaluated . 5-azacdr treatment did not change pdpn transcription levels when compared to untreated cells, while  <dig>  μm tsa lead to a respective 28% and 48% reduction of pdpn transcription. moreover, a combination of  <dig> μm 5-azacdr and  <dig>  μm tsa decreased pdpn transcription by 50% and 57%, respectively. these data indicated that in mg <dig> cells, in vivo modification of the promoter chromatin structure through combined demethylation and histone hyperacetylation rather repressed than enhanced pdpn transcription.

to investigate whether methylation of the distal pdpn promoter portion indeed assisted activation of gene transcription, further luciferase reporter gene assays were performed . complete in vitro methylation of the promoter plasmids pgl <dig> and pgl <dig> lead to more than 90% loss of promoter activity in mg <dig> and saos- <dig> cells, indicating that the vectors were susceptible to inhibition by methylation. to further assess promoter activity upon selective methylation of defined promoter regions, fragments bp -1885/+ <dig> and -857/+ <dig>  or fragments bp -1885/- <dig> and -825/- <dig>  which comprised the region that wasmethylated in vivo in mg <dig> cells, were generated by restriction digest with saci/xhoi or saci/apai, respectively . the four fragments were methylated by sssi methylase or mock-methylated, religated into the unmethylated reporter plasmid backbone and transfected into mg <dig> and saos- <dig> cells. in vitro methylation of all promoter cpgs until bp + <dig> revealed a weak trend towards transcriptional deactivation being more pronounced in saos- <dig> than in mg <dig> cells . this result supported the observation that methylation of site sp <dig>  did not affect sp1/sp <dig> binding . conversely, selective methylation of cpg sites upstream of bp - <dig> containing  <dig> or  <dig> cpg sites, respectively, led to considerable promoter activity increase versus mock methylated constructs, which added up to more than 40% and 30% in mg <dig> and to more than 25% and 60% in saos- <dig> cells. these data indicated that a putative methylation-dependent enhancement mechanism, possibly efficiently altering chromatin structure, was able to act on pdpn transcription.

discussion
the present study provides a comprehensive analysis of the pdpn gene promoter region in human osteoblast-like cell lines. it was our aim to clarify which mechanisms account for cell type-specific expression of podoplanin in mg <dig> versus saos- <dig> cells, as direct regulators of pdpn transcription in human systems have not been elucidated yet. we show that pdpn transcription was initiated from several start sites within  <dig> bp, the most 3' located transcript of which corresponded to the major initiation site in the murine and rat gene  <cit> . generally, the pdpn promoter seems to belong to the group of regulative genomic entities which are characterized by the absence of a consensus tata and caat box, by a high gc content and multiple potential binding sites for the transcription factor sp <dig>  such genes are usually either ubiquitously expressed  or are growth related, as for instance dihydrofolate reductase  <cit> . nonetheless, genes possessing these features have been identified to be expressed in tissue-specific manner, e.g. rage  <cit>  or thioredoxin reductase  <dig>  <cit> . the chosen promoter fragments indeed conferred intense transcriptional activity in mg <dig> but not in saos- <dig> cells, indicating the presence of differentially bound positive regulators.

functional analyses of the proximal pdpn promoter revealed four potential sp1/sp3-binding sites and the key roles of two of these at bp -700/- <dig>  and bp -100/- <dig> bp  for constitutive activation in both, mg <dig> as well as saos- <dig> cells. sp <dig> has been the first mammalian transcription factor to be cloned  <cit>  and invariably activates transcription  <cit> , whereas sp <dig>  dependent on the position of the element within the intact promoter and the number of sp binding sites  <cit> , is able to either enhance or suppress transcription. sp <dig> and sp <dig> have been described to be involved in the regulation of osteoblast-specific genes like beta  <dig> integrin  <cit> , osteocalcin  <cit> , or alpha <dig>  collagen   <cit>  yet. the role of the more distal site sp. <dig>  which was conserved in the rat promoter, has not been described elsewhere, whereas site sp. <dig> was not conserved. binding site sp. <dig> was conserved between human, rodent and bos tauris pdpn sequence, and its activating role has previously been demonstrated in rat type i alveolar cells  <cit> . also binding site sp. <dig> was conserved between humans and rodents.

the effect of sp protein transactivation on the pdpn promoter was seen pronounced in drosophila sl <dig> cells. interestingly, sp <dig> and sp <dig> seemed to regulate pdpn transcription in a contrarious, yet overall cooperative manner. the results demonstrated a strong positive effect of sp <dig> on the pdpn promoter, whereas sp <dig> acted as repressor. in mg <dig> and saos- <dig> cells, a repressive effect of sp <dig> was not observed, which, however, may be masked by concurring sp1-binding through endogenously present sp <dig>  on the other hand, sp protein overexpression effects were not very pronounced in these cells, presumably by the same reason of intrinsic sp protein background. one could argue that sp <dig> or sp <dig> were not essentially important to control pdpn promoter activity, but when considering the generally low transfection rates of less than 10% in mg <dig> cells, an overall  <dig> -fold promoter activation corresponded to a 12-fold induction of promoter activity if all cells were transfected. sp <dig> stimulated the pdpn promoter in saos- <dig> cells stronger than in mg <dig> cells, which can be explained through a more potent effect due to the lowered nuclear sp <dig> amounts as seen from western blotting. additionally, this effect might have resulted from generally better transfection efficiencies in saos- <dig> cells. real-time pcr analyses then convincingly demonstrated the effect of sp-proteins on endogenous pdpn gene expression in both cell lines. we therefore assume that a balance between cooperatively bound sp <dig> and sp <dig> tightly regulates activity of the pdpn promoter in these osteoblastic cell lines.

sp1/sp <dig> site emsa analyses suggested that they were occupied by regulators mainly present in mg <dig>  but not in saos- <dig> cells. the faint sp1/sp3-dna interactions of saos- <dig> nuclear extracts may be due to several reasons: firstly, nuclear sp-proteins can be inactivated by dephosphorylation  <cit> , or sp-proteins may be present in the nuclei, but in very low concentrations. indeed, western blotting experiments pointed out that nuclear sp1/sp <dig> protein amounts were distinctively lower in saos- <dig> than in mg <dig> cells, and chromatin immunoprecipitations confirmed the low in vivo occupancy of sp binding sites in saos- <dig> cells. hence, these low sp-protein concentrations might be insufficient to drive pdpn transcription and strikingly would explain the lack of podoplanin mrna in saos- <dig> cells. in mg <dig> cells, nuclear sp1/sp <dig> quantities were highly abundant, which could rely on increased nuclear sp protein translocation and/or a decreased efflux of sp proteins out of the nuclei  <cit> . consistent with our results, hyperoxia treatment of murine lung epithelial cells caused an increased nuclear abundance of sp <dig> that lead to enhanced expression of podoplanin/t1α  <cit> .

besides control through nuclear concentration thresholds, sp-mediated transcriptional changes can be mediated by interactions with additional transcription factors, such as camp  <cit>  or nfκb  <cit> . when reducing the pdpn promoter stretch from bp -1104/+ <dig> to bp -854/+ <dig>  transcriptional activity decreased about more than 50%. in dnasei footprintings, however, no protected region could be detected in this region. proteins attaching to this region might need concurrent binding of sp1/sp <dig> or of other factors more downstream. such interaction mode without direct dna contact could also explain the divergent results of dnasei footprints and emsa analyses at regions fp <dig>  fp <dig>  fp <dig> and fp <dig>  in contrast to the reproducible footprinting results, nuclear proteins binding directly to the same motifs could not be detected in emsas. this result may either be explained by the presence of low affinity factors that rapidly dissociate from the dna during the assay, or the attachment of proteins to these sites may depend on adjacent bound sp1/sp3-proteins and consequently could not be grasped due to the restricted length of the applied dna probes. consecutively, in saos- <dig> cells accessory assembly of the same activating factors would be impossible due to lack of sp allocation.

moreover, despite its conservation between humans and rodents, we could not clearly prove functionality of binding site sp. <dig> through repressive sp <dig>  surprisingly, the higher promoter activity of the bp -38/+ <dig> versus bp -76/+ <dig> variant, as well as of the mutational sp. <dig> variant rather seemed to result from additional interactions to a factor located more downstream than through repressive sp <dig>  possibly, this mechanism may be a regulative to suppress extensive pdpn transcription. for example, interaction of sp <dig> with e2f has been shown to control growth related gene transcription  <cit> . studies are ongoing that shall clarify the presence and identity of factors that are physically associated with sp1/sp <dig> bound to sites fp <dig>  fp <dig> and fp <dig> 

sp7/osterix respresents an interesting sp protein family candidate relevant for activation of osteoblast-specific genes. it is essential for osteoblast differentiation and bone formation  <cit> , and its expression has been detected in mg <dig>  <cit>  as well as saos- <dig> cells  <cit> . its potential role for pdpn promoter activation may be of interest and shall be clarified in future studies. as in murine and human osteosarcoma cells, on the other hand, sp7/osterix expression has been detected to be reduced versus normal osteoblasts  <cit> , we presume that sp7/osterix contents might also be lowered in mg <dig> and saos- <dig> osteosarcoma cells and therefore would exert a minor effect on pdpn promoter activation.

to unravel the transcriptional difference between mg <dig> and saos- <dig> cells more thoroughly, potential dna methylation of the pdpn promoter was examined. we identified complete promoter demethylation in saos- <dig> cells, although no pdpn transcription took place. by contrast, in mg <dig> cells the distal promoter part was strongly methylated, while the pdpn gene was efficiently transcribed. this dna modification affected the functional sp protein binding site sp. <dig>  but in vitro competition data proved that sp-protein binding to this site was possible even when it was methylated. our data therefore strongly support studies demonstrating that cpg methylation has no effect on attachment of sp <dig>  <cit> , whereas others have found that it diminished sp1/sp <dig> binding  <cit> .

chromatin modification by cpg methylation and/or histone deacetylation has been linked inevitably with transcriptional repression  <cit> . however, our data provide evidence for a positive correlation between dna methylation/histone modification and pdpn transcription in mg <dig> cells, as in our hands, induction of this classical "active chromatin state" rather conferred deactivation of gene activity. more importantly, site-specific dna methylation by no means lead to down-modulation of promoter activity. the theoretical possibility of a repressor binding to the promoter and being competed by dna methylation in mg <dig> cells has to be excluded, because demethylated pdpn promoter  was highly active in mg <dig> cells. in agreement with that, no repressor-dna interactions could be identified in saos- <dig> cells. the mechanistic principle underlying the observed phenomenon could be diverse: when treating mg <dig> cells with 5-azacdr in combination with tsa, consecutive conformational changes of chromatin may hinder sp-protein binding and lead to downregulation of pdpn transcription. secondly, it is tempting to hypothesize that methylation-dependent protein-dna interactions being able to stimulate transcription may exist . for example, the zinc finger protein kaiso has been found to bind to both, methylated and sequence-specific recognition sites, fulfilling repressive  <cit>  or activating functions  <cit> . here, we identify a completely different methylation scenario than has been observed in brain and lung alveolar type i cells of the rat  <cit> . in these cells, dna methylation was detected at key site sp. <dig> under podoplanin/t1α non-expressing conditions, whereas its transcription could be initiated by addition of methyltransferase-inhibitor. these findings may indicate that the switch between transcriptional silencing and expression of podoplanin in different tissues/organs could depend on varying epigenetic phenomena, apparently driven by basal sp1/sp <dig> activation at conserved promoter sites. studies using additional cell lines that constitutively or upon stimulation express podoplanin are ongoing to better understand the effect of methylation on this type of promoter. preliminary data are pointing at again different methylation patterns in other cell lines. moreover, altered histone modification patterns of the pdpn promoter chromatin have to be considered, as this process is intimately connected with dna methylation  <cit> . presumably, diverse regulatory pathways are mediating these epigenetic patterns in different cell types or even species.

to our knowledge, this investigation is only the second one reporting on a certain protein exhibiting increased transcription levels upon methylation  <cit> . unlike podoplanin, this report describes increased transcription of an imprinted gene  upon enhanced intragenic methylation, whereas in our study the 5' regulatory region was affected. similar to our findings, some studies have shown a positive effect on gene expression when methylation downstream of the transcriptional start site had occurred  <cit> , and hypermethylation of cpg islands has been detected in actively transcribed regions of cancer cells  <cit> . on the other hand, hypermethylated gene promoters, generally, have been associated with inappropriate gene silencing as an effect of selection during neoplasia  <cit> , which follows a primary leakiness of the cellular repression machinery  <cit> . a further unexpected finding of our study is hypomethylation of an inactive promoter. in accordance with this, 1–2% of genes of murine fibroblast cultures observed in an array study were downregulated through genomic demethylation  <cit> . moreover, hypomethylated inactive dna has been detected throughout large areas of the inactive female x chromosome and in gene-poor genomic regions of tumour cells  <cit> . recapitulatory, changes in dna methylation patterns play a fundamental role in cancer and may regard to losses or increases of epigenetic patterns  <cit> . the epigenetic event observed in our study may have provided a selection advantage to mg <dig> osteosarcoma cells and further clonal selection, considering that podoplanin recently has been assessed to contribute to tumour progression by circumventing epithelial-mesenchymal transition  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
conclusively, we studied the cell-type specific regulation of podoplanin expression in human mg <dig> versus saos- <dig> osteoblast-like osteosarcoma cells. the results are summarized in the proposed activation model depicted in figure  <dig> 

our findings indicate that sp1/sp <dig> members constitutively bind at least to three responsive elements of the pdpn promoter in mg <dig> cells in vivo, and that the activity of the promoter primarily depends on the integrity of two of these sites. increased nuclear sp1/sp <dig> levels were shown to be responsible for activation of the promoter in mg <dig> versus saos- <dig> cells. additional transcription factor complexes located even more upstream seem to up-regulate pdpn gene expression strongly in mg <dig> versus saos- <dig> cells. analysis of the human pdpn promoter sequence undertaken here did not detect high score binding sites for osteoblast-specific transcription factors. however, the possibility that such factors participate in pdpn transcriptional regulation cannot be excluded, either by representing coactivators without direct dna interaction, or by binding to far more upstream or downstream regulatory regions. a highly methylated chromatin conformation present in the distal promoter in mg <dig>  but not in saos- <dig> cells, leads to auxiliary enhancement of transcriptional activity of the pdpn gene. our data are conflictive with previous findings supporting a negative correlation between methylation status and transcriptional activity of a promoter. studies are under way to further dissect the mechanistic principle of regulation provided by this type of promoter in other podoplanin expressing cell lines.
