BACKGROUND
we are often able to wake up spontaneously at a desired or planned time or to subconsciously estimate time elapsed during sleep without receiving external time stimuli such as from an alarm clock. this phenomenon is referred to as self-awakening  <cit>  or anticipated sleep termination  <cit> , and it is believed to be achieved by time estimation ability   <cit> , which is exercised even during sleep  <cit> . a previous study reported that more than half of healthy adults believe that they are able to wake up by themselves during habitual sleep with an accuracy  of ±  <dig> min  <cit> .

previous studies have identified several factors related to tea during sleep, including an increased adrenocorticotropic hormone  level observed before awakening  <cit> , recurrent semi-awakening during sleep  <cit> , differences in preceding sleep structures  <cit> , diurnal fluctuation  <cit> , and psychological motivation  <cit> . however, the brain region responsible for tea has not been identified. meanwhile, considerable information has been obtained regarding the neurological basis of tea while awake  <cit> . the basal nuclei , cerebellum, and prefrontal cortex have been shown to contribute to tea in the order of seconds to minutes, and each of these three regions plays a different role. the cerebellum processes mainly timing information  <cit> , the basal nuclei, in particular the corpus striatum, functions as a core timer  <cit> , and the prefrontal cortex assists the basal nuclei in controlling timer rate, attention allocation, and temporal memory processing  <cit> . despite the possible contributions of these brain regions and the interval timer system to tea during sleep, no study has continuously monitored the activity of these regions during the course of natural sleep. thus, the neurological basis of tea during sleep remains to be elucidated.

several recent studies have shown changes in cerebral hemodynamics during sleep with near infrared spectroscopy   <cit> . one study showed a decrease in oxy-hb levels of 5–10% from baseline  during the first  <dig> min of sleep  <cit> . this technique has the potential to elucidate specific hemodynamic change during self-awakening. the objective of this study was to determine whether the prefrontal cortex mediates self-awakening by: 1) setting two night conditions ; and 2) measuring hemodynamic changes to the prefrontal cortex over time by multi-channel nirs while simultaneously measuring sleep structures by polysomnography  during the first  <dig> h after lights out.

methods
participants
fifteen healthy, right-handed male volunteers ) with regular sleep habits participated in the consecutive two-night, single-blind, crossover conditions . all subjects provided written informed consent after being informed of the possible risks and details of the study. a physician and a psychiatrist examined the subjects and found that no subjects suffered from a neurological or psychiatric disorder or had a history of psychoactive drug use. subjects were instructed to maintain a regular sleep-wake schedule, record their sleep patterns in a sleep log, and abstain from caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol for  <dig> week prior to the experiment. all subjects wore a wrist activity recorder  for  <dig> week prior to the experiment. sleep onset and offset times were determined using actiware sleep software . data recorded in the sleep logs together with sleep onset and offset times were used to confirm regular sleep-wake schedules. the study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the institutional review board of the national center of neurology and psychiatry, japan.

experimental procedures
all experiments were performed in the time isolation laboratory at the national center of neurology and psychiatry in japan. room temperature and humidity were controlled at 24°c and 60%, respectively. subjects arrived at the sleep laboratory at 21: <dig> and were instructed to go to bed at 00: <dig>  after electrodes and sensors for psg and nirs were attached. each subject was randomly allocated to the “request” or “surprise” sessions on a within-subject crossover basis as follows: 1) “request”: subjects were instructed at bedtime to wake up at 03:00; and 2) “surprise”: subjects were instructed at bedtime to wake up at 08: <dig>  but were unexpectedly woken at 03: <dig> . when a subject could self-awaken at 03: <dig> ±  <dig> min, the event was recorded as “success”. when a subject could not awaken spontaneously at 03: <dig> ±  <dig> min, the event was recorded as “failure”. each subject was examined under the other condition the following night.

measurement
simultaneous measurement of psg and nirs was performed throughout the sleep period, which was defined as the period from sleep onset to the designated wake time defined for each condition. psg comprised electroencephalography  in accordance with the 10– <dig> electrode system, electrooculography , chin surface electromyography , and electrocardiography . psg data were obtained continuously during each experiment, digitalized at  <dig> hz, and stored in a digital eeg system . the high cut and low cut filters were set at  <dig> hz  and  <dig>  hz, respectively.

nirs of the human brain is a relatively flexible technique for measuring hemodynamic changes on the basis of differences in the absorbance of harmless near-infrared light between oxyhemoglobin  and deoxyhemoglobin , and nirs has been used to elucidate the physiological mechanisms of the blood oxygen level-dependent response  <cit> . previous studies showed that nirs signals correlate strongly with functional magnetic resonance imaging  measurements  <cit> .

in our study, regional hemodynamic changes in brain tissue were monitored using a continuous wave-type fnirs system , which consisted of three semiconductor laser diodes producing wavelengths of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nm. this system is used to calculate changes in oxy-hb, deoxy-hb, and total-hb levels on the basis of the modified beer-lambert equation as a function of light absorbance of hb and pathlength  <cit> . since the used wavelengths are in a relatively narrow range, their corresponding pathlengths are assumed to be approximate to those of the algorithm used in the om- <dig> system. thus, changes in oxy-hb levels were calculated using changes in absorption  and the absorption coefficient of each wavelength, but without the differential pathlength factor  for adjustment  <cit> . the relevant equations are as follows:

  Δoxy−hb=− <dig> ×Δabs780nm+ <dig> ×Δabs805nm+ <dig> ×Δabs830nm 

  Δdeoxy−hb= <dig> ×Δabs780nm+− <dig> ×Δabs805nm+− <dig> ×Δabs830nm 

  Δtotal−hb=Δoxy−hb+Δdeoxy−hb 

the coefficients in equations , , and  are coefficients of absorption at corresponding wavelengths. determining changes in hb levels with the modified beer-lambert law depends on dpf, but optical pathlengths differ among individuals and depend on the position within the brain. thus, oxy-hb values measured by the omm- <dig> system show relative change in concentration, as opposed to absolute hb concentration.

optrodes for producing near-infrared light  and for collecting transmitted light  were placed alternately at 3-cm intervals in a  <dig> × 5-cm square on the frontal cortex  area , resulting in  <dig> channels for measuring each hb level every  <dig> ms . the energy emitted by each laser diode during long-term exposure was well below the united states safety level   <cit> . subject behavioral status and sleep-wake status, as well as hemodynamic status, were continuously and carefully monitored visually by two well-trained research attendants. in our study subjects, we confirmed the following: 1) oxy-hb levels were stable for at least  <dig> min before lights-off on the experimental night in a recumbent position on the bed; and 2) subjects showed decreased oxy-hb levels of 5–10% from baseline  during the first  <dig> min of sleep, which is consistent with findings in previous studies  <cit> .

data analysis
nirs data could not be obtained from  <dig> of  <dig> subjects due to displacement of light-producing optrodes during sleep. evaluation of sleep structures was made for  <dig> subjects while analysis of sleep structures in relation to oxy-hb was performed for the  <dig> subjects with available nirs data.

psg data obtained over a period of about  <dig> h were scored for 30-s epoch periods according to standard criteria  <cit> . the amount of stage w, stage  <dig>  stage  <dig>  stage 3+ <dig>  and stage rem sleep, as well as sleep latency, wake after sleep onset , and arousal index  <cit>  for total sleep time were calculated for all psg recordings. slow-wave sleep was calculated as the sum of stage  <dig> and stage  <dig> sleep. the frequency of body movement during sleep was determined by viewing a monitor and eeg waveforms in real-time. for more detailed analysis of sleep structures, power spectral analysis using fast fourier transform  as a parameter of brain activity at the cortical level was also examined with sleep sign . the eeg power  of f3-a <dig> and f4-a <dig> was obtained by fft analysis of  <dig> data-points  tapered by a hanning window. since the eight sequences are longer than the visual epoch definitions for sleep staging, both sides of each sequence overlapped by  <dig>  s. fft values for each sequence were summed to obtain the value of eeg power per epoch. epochs containing artifacts were visually identified and excluded from the analysis.

we focused on changes of oxy-hb in the 60- to 30-min period before self-awakening, since previous study demonstrated increases in adrenocorticotropic hormone levels during this period  <cit> . nirs analysis on the “request” night was performed using data obtained from each subject during the final  <dig> min before self-awakening. on the “surprise” night, data obtained during the same period as that on the “request” night were used for analysis. nirs data obtained from multiple analyzable channels every  <dig> ms were averaged every  <dig> s in line with psg analysis to calculate hb levels after excluding visible artifacts. a  <dig> – <dig> hz band pass filter was applied to individual data to remove artifacts caused by high-frequency instrument noise and low-frequency drift in oxy-hb and deoxy-hb signals in the fnirs system. since oxy-hb level determined by nirs is the most sensitive and representative optimal indicator of regional hemodynamic changes, we used this parameter in our analysis  <cit> . for the analysis of each right and left fc  region, we averaged the channels separately for each side  and region .

statistical analysis
to determine the effect of the order of each experimental condition on sleep duration during each psg period, we compared the nocturnal duration of each sleep stage between the groups under each experimental condition using two-way measures anova. we also analyzed the rate of oxy-hb changes between the groups under the each experimental condition using two-way anova . to compare fluctuations in oxy-hb levels, individual sleep structures, and eeg power with time between the groups under each experimental condition, three-way  repeated measures anova  was performed. if significant interactions were obtained, planned follow-up anova and post-hoc analysis were subsequently conducted to verify our assumption that changes in hemodynamics and eeg power in the prefrontal cortex area mediates self-awakening. spss ver.  <dig>   was used for all statistical analysis. results are expressed as mean and standard error values. significance was set at p< <dig> .

temporal changes in oxy−hb levels in the pfc region
for oxy-hb changes over  <dig> min in the rpfc area, a significant interaction of condition × group was obtained  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) . under the “request” condition, the additional post-hoc test revealed that the rate of oxy-hb change in the “success” group increased significantly more than in the “failure” group  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), but not under the “surprise” condition  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). meanwhile, in the lpfc area, no difference in oxy-hb change was observed  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; group: f =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; interaction: f =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) .

temporal changes in sleep structures
two-way anova revealed a significant interaction of time course × group under the “request” condition  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; time course: f =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; group: f =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), but not under the “surprise” condition  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; time course: f =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; group: f =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). moreover, additional one-way anova confirmed a significant increase in rem stage sleep in the “success” group with time under the “request” condition  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). fluctuations of values in other sleep stages did not differ between condition or group.

temporal changes in δ power
discussion
we examined changes in oxy-hb levels during sleep as well as sleep depth and amount over time until a planned wake time under the “request” and “surprise” conditions by simultaneously recording nirs and psg data. the results revealed that under the “request” condition, an increase in the oxy-hb level in the right prefrontal region and a rapid decrease in δ power occurred during the final  <dig> min of sleep in subjects who succeeded in self-awakening, whereas no changes were observed in these three parameters in subjects who failed to self-awaken. under the “surprise” night condition, no significant changes were observed in these parameters during the final  <dig> min of sleep in either group.

success rate for self-awakening
seven of the  <dig> subjects succeeded in self-awakening. a previous telephone survey involving  <dig> subjects showed that more than half of the subjects were able to wake up naturally without an alarm clock  <cit> . hall and brush tested whether subjects could wake up at a predetermined time on 50– <dig> nights and reported that about 70% were able to wake up almost exactly at the planned time  <cit> . the self-awakening success rate in the present study is almost identical to that in previous studies.

sleep structures preceding self-awakening
although the neurological mechanism mediating self-awakening has not been clarified, it has been postulated that strong motivation toward self-awakening and resulting psychological strain reduces slow-wave sleep and increases shallow sleep, resulting in a lowered arousal threshold  <cit> . previous studies of sleep structures preceding self-awakening have yielded discrepant results; some showed a decrease in sleep depth  <cit> , while others showed no change  <cit> . in the present study, assessment of sleep structures over the entire period between lights out and self-awakening showed no significant difference between the “request” and “surprise” nights. meanwhile, the analysis results of sleep structures immediately before self-awakening and those of power analysis had several important implications. first, it should be noted that subjects who succeeded in self-awakening showed an increase in rem sleep over time during the final  <dig> min of sleep on the “request” night. however, the total amount of rem sleep during the period did not differ between conditions, and no such increase was observed in subjects who failed. since rem sleep tends to occur at around  <dig> h after lights out—in other words, at the planned wake time—it is not surprising that rem sleep occurred during the final  <dig> min before self-awakening. nevertheless, the fact that increased rem sleep was observed just before self-awakening in the “success” group under the “request” condition, but not under the “surprise” condition, supports the contention that increased rem sleep facilitates successful self-awakening  <cit> . second, it should be noted that a rapid decrease in δ power was also observed in the same area during the final  <dig> min of sleep in the “success” group under the “request” condition. this suggests that the rapid decrease in δ power around the planned time of self-awakening and the associated reciprocal increase in rem sleep may contribute to successful self-awakening.

mechanism and localization of self-awakening
subjects who succeeded in self-awakening showed an increase in oxy-hb level in the right prefrontal region before self-awakening on the “request” night, which appears to reflect increased blood flow in the region. however, no significant differences were seen between groups for frequency of body movement, duration of each sleep stage, waso, or total sleep time during the same period. it is thus unlikely that the observed increase in oxy-hb level before self-awakening was caused by a change in the oxy-hb level in association with coarse fluctuation of sleep structures or body movement. subjects who succeeded in self-awakening showed decreased δ power and increased rem sleep during the final  <dig> min of sleep on the “request” night. it is likely that these changes in sleep structures secondarily or simultaneously led to a change in local blood flow in the prefrontal region  <cit> . it is therefore reasonable to assume that increased blood flow in the prefrontal region resulted in self-awakening and the consequent arousal reaction. however, it remains unclear in our study why the blood flow increased significantly in the right but not the left prefrontal region.

it has been suggested that self-awakening is achieved by some kind of drive related to time recognition during sleep  <cit> . the present findings support this contention indirectly. at least in the awake state, the basal nuclei , cerebellum, and right prefrontal region have been shown to contribute to tea  <cit> . the right prefrontal region, in which increased oxy-hb levels were observed, is a region that showed increased blood flow in awake subjects during a time recognition test  <cit> , suggesting the contribution of increased blood flow in this region to successful self-awakening. however, the kind of physiological factors that trigger the increase in rem sleep or blood flow in the right prefrontal region during the  <dig> min before awakening in the present study remain unclear. born et al. observed an increased acth level about  <dig> h prior to anticipated sleep termination  <cit> . positron emission tomography  studies that have examined the correlation between cerebral blood flow, acth, and cortisol levels while awake have demonstrated that increased secretion of acth and cortisol correlates with increased blood flow  <cit> . subjects in the present study who succeeded in self-awakening might also have had increased the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis before self-awakening.

the present findings suggest the involvement of pre-awake activation of the right prefrontal region in self-awakening. the effect of heart rate and peripheral vasodilation on cerebral blood flow is important when interpreting the present data. such factors are expected to have various effects on the measured responses under different conditions  and in different groups . therefore, it is likely that heart rate and peripheral vasodilation played specific roles in the “success” group under the “request” condition. in addition, the sample population was relatively small, due to highly complex procedures involving spontaneous psg and nirs over the period of  <dig> h during sleep. findings of this study need to be confirmed by other methods such as pet and fmri. once confirmed, further studies using techniques such as simultaneous measurement of fmri and sleep eeg are needed to determine whether the deep brain regions, which are considered to be related to tea and include the basal nuclei  and cerebellum, are involved in achieving self-awakening. moreover, it will be necessary to elucidate whether tea in the order of hours during sleep occurs in the same manner as tea in the order of seconds to minutes. from the clinical viewpoint, patients who repeatedly experience sleep state misperception/paradoxical insomnia  <cit> , waking after sleep onset, or waking in the early morning may have excessive and persistent activation of the right prefrontal region, which is caused by undefined mechanisms during sleep. thus, elucidation of the neural mechanism of self-awakening should contribute to elucidating the pathophysiology of such difficult-to-treat insomnia symptoms.

CONCLUSIONS
our present findings demonstrate a correlation between self-awakening and a pre-awakening increase in hemodynamic activation in the right prefrontal cortex, suggesting the structure’s contribution to time estimation ability.
