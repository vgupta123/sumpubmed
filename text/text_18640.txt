BACKGROUND
the tribbles genes encode a family of highly conserved pseudokinases which lack key catalytic amino acids in the kinase domain . functional studies in multiple organisms have shown that these pseudokinases play diverse roles in innate immunity, cell signalling, energy homeostasis and cell division  <cit> . the drosophila tribbles gene is required for cell proliferation and migration in embryogenesis and oogenesis . the mammalian tribbles family includes three genes, trib <dig>  trib <dig> and trib <dig>  each of which plays unique roles in signalling networks regulating adipose tissue, metabolic homeostasis and the immune system  <cit> . abnormal function in human tribbles has been implicated in a number of diseases including leukaemia, metabolic syndromes and cardiovascular disease  <cit> .

mammalian tribbles can interact with components of the mitogen-activated protein  kinase pathway and act as adaptor proteins to modulate the strength and output of kinase signalling cascades . like fly tribbles  <cit> , mammalian tribbles bind to the basic leucine zipper  transcription factors. trib <dig> and trib <dig> can induce degradation of several ccaat/enhancer-binding protein  members in a context-dependent manner  <cit> . trib <dig> binds to and inhibits the transcriptional activity of both activating transcription factor  <dig>  and c/ebp homologous protein  in cultured cell lines , although the in vivo functional relevance of such protein interactions remains unknown.

given its extensive connections to different cellular processes, many questions remain to be answered regarding the role of tribbles at the organismal level. no induction of peptide after drechmeria infection  <dig>  is the single tribbles protein in caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> . a role for nipi- <dig> in the innate immune response was previously uncovered through the isolation of a partial loss-of-function mutation, which contains a missense mutation in the pseudokinase domain  <cit> . nipi- <dig> is required for the upregulation of antimicrobial peptide  gene expression following infection by the fungus drechmeria coniospora  <cit> . it acts upstream of a p <dig> map kinase  pathway consisting of nsy-1/mapkkk, sek-1/mapkk and pmk-1/mapk  <cit> . both nipi- <dig> and all components of the mapk cascade are required cell autonomously in the epidermis during the immune response  <cit> .

in this study, we generated null mutations of nipi- <dig> and uncovered a novel role in animal development and viability. the lethality of nipi- <dig> null animals is completely suppressed by loss of function in cebp- <dig>  a c. elegans member of the c/ebp family, previously known to be required for adult sensory axon regeneration and neuronal stress responses  <cit> . unexpectedly, loss of function in components of the pmk-1/p <dig> mapk cascade also suppresses the lethality of nipi- <dig> null animals. in nipi- <dig> mutants, the levels of activated pmk- <dig> are increased, in a cebp-1-dependent manner. through chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing  analyses and identification of target genes, we found that cebp- <dig> binds to a conserved dna motif. our analyses of candidate target genes of cebp- <dig> suggest a functional enrichment in development and stress responses. importantly, in contrast to its role in innate immunity, we show that nipi- <dig> acts in multiple tissues to negatively regulate transcriptional expression of cebp- <dig>  this inhibition of cebp- <dig> by nipi- <dig> is also required across multiple tissues to enable larval development and maintain fecundity. the coordinated inhibition of cebp- <dig> by nipi- <dig> in multiple tissues reveals novel requirements for systemic regulation of signalling pathways in organism development.

RESULTS
c. elegans tribbles nipi- <dig> is required for larval development and viability
to better understand the biological roles of nipi- <dig>  we used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats -cas <dig> genome editing  to generate two deletion alleles of nipi- <dig>  and a green fluorescent protein  knock-in   . the fr <dig> and ju <dig> deletion alleles remove  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb of the 5′ region of the gene, respectively , resulting in molecular nulls for nipi- <dig>  the phenotypes of homozygous mutants of either nipi- <dig> deletion allele, designated as null , were indistinguishable . mutants arrested development at the second to third larval stages   and eventually died between 5– <dig> days after hatching. when compared to wild-type larvae at the same stage , nipi- <dig> arrested larvae displayed a small and dumpy body morphology. at 3 days post-hatching, wild-type animals reached the adult stage, as evidenced by fusion of seam cells , formation of adult alae and the vulva . by contrast, all age-matched nipi- <dig> animals were arrested at l2–l <dig>  as the seam cells did not fuse, adult alae were not observed and the vulval invagination did not occur . in these mutant animals, the germline also appeared to be arrested, generally at l <dig> based on the size of the gonad and the number of germ cells . occasionally, in nipi- <dig> animals with longer bodies, we observed some sperm or a few unfertilized oocytes. the nipi- <dig> animals also exhibited an abnormal pharyngeal morphology . we rescued the larval lethality and sterility of nipi- <dig> by expressing the wild-type nipi- <dig> genomic dna as high-copy-number extrachromosomal arrays . as expression from such transgenes is silenced in the germline  <cit> , this result indicates that the larval lethality and germline development defects of nipi- <dig> are both primarily due to its function in somatic tissues. thus, the analyses of nipi- <dig> null animals indicate an essential somatic role of nipi- <dig> in organism development.fig.  <dig>

knocking-in gfp to the nipi- <dig> locus, which produced a protein tagged at its n-terminus , had no adverse effect; ki animals  were fully viable and indistinguishable from wild type in growth and movement. we observed gfp expression in the epidermis, intestine and in neurons , consistent with the previously reported expression pattern obtained using transgenic transcriptional reporters  <cit> . interestingly, although nipi- <dig> does not have a clearly identifiable nuclear-localization signal, gfp::nipi- <dig> expression was observed predominantly in the nuclei , with an overall intensity peaking at the l2–l <dig> stages. this nuclear localization suggests a role for nipi- <dig> in regulation of gene expression.

loss of cebp- <dig> suppresses the lethality, but not the innate immune response defect, of nipi- <dig> null animals
to dissect the molecular mechanisms involving nipi- <dig>  we undertook a yeast two-hybrid screen using the full-length nipi- <dig> protein as bait . one prominent candidate interacting partner was cebp- <dig>  a member of the c/ebp family of transcription factors  <cit> . the cebp- <dig> protein consists of  <dig> amino acids, with a bzip domain at its c-terminus. in further analyses using the yeast two-hybrid assay, we found that the n-terminal region  of cebp- <dig> was sufficient for binding nipi- <dig> . this interaction is reminiscent of those observed for fly and vertebrate tribbles proteins, which bind and degrade c/ebp family proteins , with human trib <dig> binding the n-terminus of c/ebpα  <cit> . thus, the ability of tribbles and c/ebp proteins to interact directly is likely conserved from c. elegans to humans.

to understand the functional significance of the observed protein interaction, we next performed genetic analysis using null mutations of nipi- <dig> and cebp- <dig>  null mutants of cebp- <dig> show normal development and body appearance. remarkably, cebp- <dig> completely suppressed the growth and fertility defects of nipi- <dig> mutants . cebp- <dig> also completely suppressed the body size defect and the developmental delay observed at 25 °c of the partial loss-of-function nipi- <dig> mutants . nipi- <dig> is also known to be necessary for the epidermal innate immune response upon fungal infection  <cit> . the expression of amp genes after fungal infection is highly induced in wild-type animals and abrogated in nipi- <dig> mutants  <cit> . however, cebp- <dig> nipi- <dig> animals did not exhibit an induction of the amp gene nlp- <dig> upon infection . further, cebp- <dig> nipi- <dig> animals expressing wild-type cebp- <dig> in a tissue-specific manner in either the epidermis or neurons also showed no amp gene induction . these results indicate that loss of cebp- <dig> does not suppress the immune response defect in nipi- <dig>  as cebp- <dig> strongly impairs sensory axon regeneration after laser axotomy  <cit> , we also tested whether nipi- <dig> affected posterior lateral microtubule  axon regeneration. neither nipi- <dig> nor nipi- <dig> showed significant effects in axon regeneration, and cebp- <dig> nipi- <dig> double mutants showed impaired axon regeneration similar to cebp- <dig> . these results show that the genetic interaction between nipi- <dig> and cebp- <dig> is highly specific for larval development and organism fecundity.fig.  <dig>

loss of the pmk-1/p <dig> mapk pathway also suppresses nipi- <dig> lethality
to gain further insight into the mechanism underlying nipi-3’s role in animal development, we performed a forward genetic screen for suppressors of nipi- <dig> lethality. we mutagenized nipi-3; tg animals . among their f <dig> progeny, we isolated fertile animals that had lost the rescuing transgene  and established multiple suppressor lines ; suppressor). we screened ~ <dig>  haploid genomes and identified  <dig> independent suppressor alleles. all the identified suppressors in this study were associated with a full reversion of the nipi- <dig> lethality; fertile adults could be propagated without the nipi- <dig> rescuing transgene.

we characterized several suppressor mutations using candidate gene analyses in combination with whole genome sequencing. one suppressor caused a missense mutation in the bzip domain of cebp- <dig>  and behaved like cebp- <dig> . among the other suppressors of nipi- <dig>  we found missense alterations in tir-1/the sterile alpha  and toll-interleukin receptor  motif-containing protein sarm), nsy-1/mapkkk, sek-1/mapkk and mak-2/mapk-activated protein kinase  . these mutations are located in known functional domains, including the tir domain for tir- <dig>  the kinase domains for nsy- <dig>  sek- <dig> and mak- <dig>  and the duf <dig> domain, commonly found at the n-terminus of many serine-threonine kinase-like proteins, for nsy- <dig> . we then tested known null mutants in each of these genes and found them to suppress nipi- <dig> to the same degree as our suppressor mutations, as shown by quantification of the body length . thus, loss of function in tir- <dig> and these three kinase genes causes strong suppression of nipi- <dig> 


nipi- <dig> has a specific role in the regulation of epidermal defense genes. it acts together with tir- <dig>  nsy- <dig> and sek- <dig>  as well as several other genes including tpa- <dig>  pmk- <dig> and sta- <dig>  <cit> . we therefore tested mutants for these three latter genes for their genetic interaction with nipi- <dig>  we found that loss of pmk- <dig>  but not tpa- <dig> or sta- <dig>  suppressed the lethality of nipi- <dig> . loss of pmk- <dig> resulted in suppression of nipi- <dig> phenotypes similar to the other suppressor mutants such that nipi-3; pmk- <dig> double mutants developed into fertile adults with adult alae and vulva. the rescue of body size, however, was not complete . as cebp- <dig> is involved in two other mapk cascades known for their roles in adult axon regeneration  <cit> , we tested mutations in several other candidate genes and found that loss of function in dlk- <dig>  pmk- <dig>  mlk- <dig> or kgb- <dig> did not suppress nipi- <dig> defects . together, our analyses from both the forward genetic screening and test of candidate mutants reveal a previously unknown role of cebp- <dig> in larval development mediated by nipi- <dig>  and a novel genetic interaction between nipi- <dig> and the pmk-1/p <dig> mapk cascade.

nipi- <dig> inhibits pmk- <dig> phosphorylation via cebp-1
to dissect the mechanism underlying the interaction between pmk-1/p <dig> mapk and nipi- <dig>  we first asked how the levels of active pmk- <dig> might be altered in nipi- <dig> suppressor animals. we performed a western blot analysis using an anti-phospho-p <dig> mapk antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated, active pmk- <dig>  <cit> . we made protein lysates from animals at 1 day post-hatching  because nipi- <dig> animals at this stage were as healthy as the wild type. we observed that levels of active pmk- <dig> were significantly increased in nipi- <dig>  but remained similar to wild type in cebp- <dig> and cebp- <dig> nipi- <dig> animals . phosphorylated pmk- <dig> was undetectable in nipi- <dig> sek- <dig> animals, consistent with pmk- <dig> being activated by sek- <dig> . the total pmk- <dig> levels were likely unchanged in nipi- <dig>  as the mrna levels of pmk- <dig> were comparable between nipi- <dig> and wild type when assessed by quantitative rt-pcr . we note that mak- <dig> did not affect phosphorylated pmk- <dig> , suggesting that mak- <dig> likely acts downstream of, or in parallel to, pmk- <dig>  together, these results suggest that the abnormally high levels of phosphorylated pmk- <dig> in nipi- <dig> are dependent on cebp- <dig> fig.  <dig> nipi- <dig> represses pmk- <dig> phosphorylation via cebp- <dig> and represses cebp- <dig> transcription. a western blot analysis on total protein lysate from various animal strains using the indicated antibodies, α-phospho-p <dig> mapk antibody to detect a phosphorylated form of pmk- <dig> proteins  or α-actin antibody as a loading control. b densitometric quantifications of immunoblot signals normalized to actin. n = 3; error bars represent standard error of the mean ; *** p <  <dig>  . c quantitative rt-pcr  analysis of pmk- <dig>  relative abundance of pmk- <dig> mrna normalized to actin mrna. n = 3; error bars represent sem; ns, not significant . d–j fluorescence images of cebp-1p::gfp reporter animals at l <dig>  k qrt-pcr analysis of cebp- <dig> in wt, nipi- <dig>  nipi- <dig> animals. relative abundance of cebp- <dig> mrna normalized to actin mrna. n = 3; error bars represent sem; *p <  <dig> ; **p <  <dig> ; ns, not significant . l, m confocal fluorescence images  of col-154p::cebp-1::gfp reporter animals at l <dig>  n quantification of gfp intensity measured in each epidermal nucleus . n = 6; error bars represent sem; ns, not significant . primary data for panels  are provided in additional file 14





nipi- <dig> represses the transcription of cebp- <dig> in multiple tissues
to dissect how nipi- <dig> inhibits cebp- <dig>  we examined whether cebp- <dig> levels were altered in nipi- <dig> and in each nipi- <dig> suppressor. transcriptional reporters of cebp- <dig>  were broadly expressed in most post-embryonic tissues, including epidermis, muscles, pharynx, intestine and neurons . strikingly, the expression of the cebp- <dig> transcriptional reporter was highly and significantly increased in both nipi- <dig> and nipi- <dig> mutants, compared with wild-type animals . quantitative rt-pcr analysis also showed significantly increased expression of cebp- <dig> mrnas in nipi- <dig> mutant animals . consistent with the observed transcriptional regulation, we found that a translational cebp-1::gfp reporter driven by a heterologous epidermal promoter showed no detectable differences in gfp expression in a nipi- <dig> background . the increased expression of cebp-1p::gfp in nipi- <dig> was reduced to normal levels when a nipi- <dig> transgene was introduced , indicating that nipi- <dig> represses the transcription of cebp- <dig>  additionally, the transcriptional repression of cebp- <dig> by nipi- <dig> was largely independent of the pmk- <dig> pathway since cebp-1p::gfp expression in nipi- <dig> remained high in animals that also carried a null mutation of nsy- <dig>  pmk- <dig> or mak- <dig> . together, the results show that nipi- <dig> negatively regulates expression of cebp- <dig> at the transcriptional level and that cebp- <dig> acts upstream of the pmk- <dig> pathway.

the tight regulation of cebp-1’s expression level is critical for animal viability. we found that suppression of nipi- <dig> by cebp- <dig> was semi-dominant, as cebp-1/+ caused partial but significant suppression of the short body length of nipi- <dig> mutants . moreover, in a wild-type background, the transgene eft-3p::cebp-1::gfp, which drives strong and ubiquitous expression of cebp- <dig>  caused dose-dependent lethality . in addition, expression of a full-length functional translational reporter of cebp- <dig>  in nipi- <dig> mutant animals exacerbated developmental defects and accelerated larval lethality, while the same transgene showed no such effects in a wild-type background. together, these results support the conclusion that the lethality observed in nipi- <dig> mutants is a direct consequence of cebp- <dig> overexpression.

overexpression of truncated forms of cebp- <dig> suppresses nipi- <dig> lethality
to dissect the molecular basis of cebp-1’s role in animal development, we expressed truncated forms of cebp- <dig> lacking the bzip domain , or lacking the n-terminus  in nipi- <dig> mutants. surprisingly, in stark contrast to the strong lethality caused by overexpressing full-length cebp- <dig> in nipi- <dig> mutants, we found that expression of either the n-terminal fragment or the bzip domain of cebp- <dig> alone resulted in significant suppression of nipi- <dig> defects . overexpression of either the n- or c-terminal truncated protein caused no defects either in the wild-type or cebp- <dig> backgrounds. among the three cebp- <dig> fragments, the expression of c-terminal cebp- <dig>  showed the most effective rescue, judged by the fecundity of the transgenic lines and quantitative comparisons of body length . the expression levels of cebp-1::gfp were markedly increased in nipi- <dig>  presumably reflecting the transcriptional regulation of cebp- <dig> described above. we noticed the fluorescence intensity was most strongly increased in the epidermis and neurons, throughout the head region and in the ventral nerve cords . these observations suggest that the truncated forms of cebp- <dig> act in a dominant negative manner to inhibit the activity of the endogenous cebp- <dig> fig.  <dig> overexpression of truncated forms of cebp- <dig> protein suppresses nipi- <dig> lethality. a–c bright-field images of worms at 3 days post-hatching expressing truncated forms of cebp- <dig> proteins. d body length  of worms at 3 days post-hatching. each dot represents a single animal measured as shown; each red line represents the mean value; some data are replicated from fig.  <dig> as shown with darker grey dots. ***p <  <dig> ; ns, not significant . e, f confocal fluorescence images  of cebp-1p::cebp-1::gfp reporter animals at l <dig>  g quantification of gfp intensity measured in the region of head neurons. error bars represent sem; ***p <  <dig>  




cebp- <dig> binds conserved dna motifs in genes regulating development and stress response
to gain further insight into cebp-1’s function in animal development, we next sought candidate target genes of cebp- <dig> by performing chip-seq analysis on transgenic animals expressing a functional flag-tagged cebp- <dig> protein in a cebp- <dig> background . we found  <dig> cebp- <dig> chip-seq peaks in the genome that were associated with  <dig> coding genes . cebp- <dig> peaks were preferentially located within the promoter regions of the target genes , less frequently within introns  and never within exons.

we then performed motif analysis of the genomic regions bound by cebp- <dig> using the motif discovery tools multiple em for motif elicitation   <cit>  and regulatory sequence analysis tools   <cit> . the most over-represented motif, nttdygaaah, was found in  <dig> out of  <dig> cebp- <dig> chip-seq peak regions . we then compared this motif with published motifs using the motif comparison tool tomtom  <cit>  and found the most statistically significant similarities to vertebrate c/ebp binding motifs  <cit> . the conservation of cebp- <dig> binding motif further reinforces the functional parallels between c. elegans cebp- <dig> and vertebrate c/ebps.fig.  <dig> cebp- <dig> binds conserved dna motifs in genes regulating development and stress response. a motif logo of the most over-represented motif among cebp- <dig> chip-seq peaks. b qrt-pcr analysis of sek- <dig>  relative abundance of pmk- <dig> mrna normalized to actin mrna. n = 3; error bars represent sem; *p <  <dig> ; ns, not significant . primary data are provided in additional file  <dig>  c hierarchical clustering of genes and functional classes ; the presence of a gene in a class is represented by a red rectangle, its absence by blue





as cebp- <dig> likely acts upstream of the pmk- <dig> pathway, we searched among the targets of cebp- <dig> for components of the pmk- <dig> pathway and found cebp- <dig> chip-seq peaks present in the promoter of sek- <dig> . when we examined the mrna levels of sek- <dig> by quantitative rt-pcr in nipi- <dig> animals where cebp- <dig> is overexpressed, we observed increased sek- <dig> mrna levels . in contrast, in nipi- <dig> cebp- <dig> animals the levels of sek- <dig> mrnas were similar to those of the wild type. these results suggest that the abnormally high levels of cebp- <dig> in nipi- <dig> can promote the expression of sek- <dig>  which in turn promotes the phosphorylation of pmk- <dig>  <cit> , leading to abnormal larval development and lethality.

we then asked whether the list of potential cebp- <dig> targets was enriched for genes with specific functions. to this end, we searched for enriched categories through an expression analysis systematic explorer  analysis  <cit> , using our in-house database of functional annotations as described  <cit> . this includes  <dig> datasets automatically updated from multiple sources including wormbase, flybase, the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  and relevant rnai databases. most  of cebp- <dig> target genes were associated with at least one of  <dig> enriched functional classes . hierarchical clustering of the genes in each of the enriched classes identified two main groups . one group is related to development with phenotypic classes such as 'larval lethal’ or 'slow growth’ and includes genes involved in basic cellular processes, transcription, translation or endocytosis. the second group is related to the response to biotic or abiotic stress, including response to cadmium, hygromycin or bacterial toxins. interestingly, mcewan et al. have found that most of the genes upregulated in nipi- <dig> mutants are also induced by the translational inhibitory toxin toxa. out of the  <dig> stress-related classes associated with the cebp- <dig> targets,  <dig> are shared with those found for genes upregulated in nipi- <dig> . on the other hand, consistent with the fact that the nipi- <dig> allele does not provoke larval lethality, only  <dig> out of the  <dig> classes in the development cluster is shared between the cebp- <dig> targets and the genes upregulated in nipi- <dig>  these analyses suggest that cebp- <dig> regulates genes functioning in development and in stress responses, and might have a particularly important impact on organismal physiology when overexpressed in a nipi- <dig> mutant context.

nipi- <dig> is required in multiple tissues to ensure proper larval development
we next asked in which tissue the expression of nipi- <dig> is required for animal viability. we expressed nipi- <dig> in a tissue-specific manner, using intestinal, epidermal and pan-neuronal promoters, in the nipi- <dig> background . in contrast to the complete rescue of body size and lethality in nipi- <dig> mutants expressing nipi- <dig> under its own promoter , expressing nipi- <dig> in individual tissues failed to rescue the developmental arrest . pan-neuronal expression of nipi- <dig> resulted in slightly increased body length of nipi- <dig> 3 days post-hatching . since nipi- <dig> activity strongly inhibits cebp- <dig> transcription in the epidermis and neurons , we expressed nipi- <dig> in both of these tissues together, and found that these transgenic animals showed an increased body size , compared to those expressing nipi- <dig> in each tissue alone, or in the intestine and epidermis simultaneously . some of the transgenic animals with a body length closer to that of wild-type animals showed improved somatic and germline development, with formation of vulva and adult alae, and produced a few viable but infertile progeny. when we expressed nipi- <dig> in all three tissues together, the transgenic animals showed no further improvement of body size compared to those expressing nipi- <dig> in both the epidermis and neurons , and did not recapitulate the rescue of lethality associated with the expression of nipi- <dig> under its own promoter. thus, we conclude that nipi- <dig> is required in multiple tissues, particularly epidermis and neurons, for animal growth and development.fig.  <dig> tight regulation of both nipi- <dig> and cebp- <dig> is required in multiple tissues for proper organism development. a–e bright-field images and  the body length of worms expressing tissue-specific nipi- <dig> driven by the intestinal , epidermal  or pan-neuronal  promoters in a nipi- <dig> background. g the body length of worms expressing tissue-specific cebp- <dig> driven by the intestinal , epidermal  or pan-neuronal  promoters in a nipi- <dig> cebp- <dig> background. f, g each dot represents a single animal measured as shown; each red line represents the mean value; some data are replicated from figs.  <dig> and  <dig> as shown with darker grey dots. **p <  <dig> ; ***p <  <dig> ; ns, not significant . h working model for nipi- <dig> function in c. elegans development. in wild type, presence of nipi- <dig> keeps cebp- <dig> expression level optimal for coordinated tissue development. in nipi- <dig>  however, cebp- <dig> and sek- <dig> are overexpressed and in turn pmk- <dig> is hyperactivated




suppression of nipi- <dig> by cebp- <dig> also requires a block of cebp- <dig> activity in multiple tissues
conversely, we asked whether expression of cebp- <dig> in a single tissue might cause the viable nipi- <dig> cebp- <dig> animals to die. we expressed cebp- <dig> using the intestinal, epidermal and pan-neuronal promoters in cebp- <dig> nipi- <dig> double mutants . expression of cebp- <dig> in individual tissues was insufficient to produce larval lethal phenotypes in cebp- <dig> nipi- <dig> animals. interestingly, epidermal or neuronal expression of cebp- <dig> in cebp- <dig> nipi- <dig> double mutants caused short body length, but not in cebp- <dig> mutants . co-expression of cebp- <dig> in the epidermis and neurons resulted in further reductions in body length, although these were not as severe as those in nipi- <dig> animals . in addition, we noticed that the same transgenes expressing cebp- <dig> in both epidermis and neurons caused an abnormal pharyngeal morphology in cebp- <dig> nipi- <dig> animals, similar to that seen in nipi- <dig> mutants . together, our data suggest that the tight regulation of both nipi- <dig> and cebp- <dig> in multiple tissues is required in a systemic manner for normal animal growth and development.

discussion

c. elegans tribbles nipi- <dig> was identified on the basis of its roles in host defense  <cit> . here, through generation and analyses of null alleles, we find nipi- <dig> to be essential for animal development and viability. remarkably, the larval arrest and lethality caused by complete loss of nipi- <dig> is fully suppressed by loss of cebp- <dig>  a c/ebp bzip transcription factor, or by loss of function in the pmk-1/p <dig> mapk cascade including tir-1/sarm, nsy-1/mapkkk, sek-1/mapkk and pmk-1/mapk. our data show that complete elimination of the function of nipi- <dig> causes abnormally high expression of cebp- <dig>  and activation of pmk- <dig> mapk. this then disrupts development and leads to death. the level of sek- <dig> mrna is increased in nipi- <dig> mutants but not in cebp- <dig> or in nipi- <dig> cebp- <dig> animals. the level of phosphorylated  pmk- <dig> follows the same trend. coupled with our chip-seq analyses and genetic epistasis data, this suggests that cebp- <dig> acts as a direct positive regulator of sek- <dig>  the pmk- <dig> pathway is therefore activated when cebp- <dig> expression is high in nipi- <dig>  on the other hand, cebp- <dig> expression levels remain high in nipi-3; pmk- <dig> animals, confirming that cebp- <dig> does not act downstream of the pmk- <dig> pathway. together, these results suggest that nipi- <dig> negatively regulates the pmk- <dig> mapk cascade, via cebp- <dig>  to promote animal viability and development .

in innate immunity, however, nipi- <dig> cell-autonomously promotes or enhances the same p <dig> kinase cascade to activate host defense in the epidermis  <cit> . it has been shown that overexpression of sek- <dig> in the epidermis rescues the block of amp induction in nipi- <dig> mutants upon fungal infection  <cit> , and an overexpression of nipi- <dig> provokes an increase in the constitutive expression of amp which is dependent on the p <dig> cascade  <cit> . it is intriguing that nipi- <dig> appears to be capable of activating or inhibiting pmk-1/p <dig> in the epidermis at different times or under different conditions . how might nipi- <dig> achieve this dual role under different stresses and in altered cellular contexts? as tribbles proteins are well known to act as adaptors, nipi- <dig> might be regulated via binding with other co-factors only present under specific circumstances. indeed, we find that other upstream and downstream components of the epidermal immune response cascade are not involved in the developmental regulation described here. thus, the core pmk-1/p <dig> mapk cassette has evolved context-specific functions depending on different upstream regulators or co-factors  <cit> . members of the tribbles family in other species have been mostly studied in the context of cell proliferation, adipocyte tissue differentiation, energy metabolism and immunity, where they function in a cell-autonomous manner. our discovery of the opposing roles of nipi- <dig> in development and in the immune response illustrates how cellular context can alter the function of highly conserved signalling molecules.

negative regulation of c/ebp by tribbles has been observed throughout the animal kingdom. drosophila and mammalian tribbles bind and degrade c/ebp proteins . we find that c. elegans nipi- <dig> represses the transcription of cebp- <dig>  which has important functional consequences in vivo. this form of regulation has not been reported in other organisms. given its nuclear localization, nipi- <dig> may inhibit the transcription of cebp- <dig> by interfering with other transcription factor. the promoter of cebp- <dig> contains putative cebp- <dig> binding consensus motifs, raising the possibility that nipi- <dig>  by binding to cebp- <dig>  may also alter the transcriptional activity of cebp- <dig> 

nipi- <dig> is required to control cebp- <dig> levels in multiple tissues for animal development and viability. consistent with the inhibition of cebp- <dig> expression by nipi- <dig> in the epidermis and neurons, simultaneous expression of nipi- <dig> in both tissues makes a noticeable contribution to animal development in nipi- <dig> mutants, compared with nipi- <dig> expression in single tissues. conversely, simultaneous expression of cebp- <dig> in both epidermis and neurons causes noticeable defects in animal development in nipi- <dig> cebp- <dig> mutants, compared with cebp- <dig> expression in single tissues. thus, a tightly regulated coordination of these two genes’ interactions in multiple tissues is required to ensure proper development.

a key conclusion from our study is that the precise control of cebp- <dig> and pmk-1/p <dig> mapk pathways in multiple tissues is critical for organismal development. nipi- <dig> acts as a master regulator to prevent improper activation of cebp- <dig> and pmk- <dig>  whose hyperactivation during development has deleterious consequences. interestingly, hyperactivation of pmk-1/p <dig> was previously shown to block larval development when the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response was altered  <cit> . moreover, innate immune activation with a xenobiotic that provides protection from bacterial infection in the adult has been shown to provoke a growth delay during development  <cit> . subsequently, an elegant genetic suppressor screen revealed that mutations in the pmk-1/p <dig> mapk pathway suppressed this developmental phenotype  <cit> . thus, the nipi-3/cebp- <dig> axis is a key mechanism by which immune effector expression is held in check during nematode development.

during normal development, both cebp- <dig> and pmk- <dig> are maintained at a basal level by nipi- <dig>  the levels of inducible signalling from these pathways are, however, important for animals to protect themselves or to promote repair. for instance, following fungal infection, nipi- <dig> promotes the pmk-1/p <dig> mapk signalling pathway in the epidermis  <cit> . thus, animals can successfully defend themselves from fungal infection with activated pmk- <dig> locally in the epidermis, while survival is not affected as pmk- <dig> remains inactive in other tissues. similarly, cebp- <dig> is known to play a key role in neuronal stress responses  <cit> , and we identified potential cebp- <dig> target genes that are involved in different stress responses. moreover, a concomitant study has identified nipi- <dig> as a negative regulator of cebp- <dig> in intestinal defense against the bacterial toxin toxa . an important challenge for the future will be to understand how nipi- <dig> regulates its downstream pathways and how nipi- <dig> itself is regulated depending on developmental and environmental conditions. understanding the molecular mechanism of this systemic, coordinated regulation should advance our knowledge of how animal development can be maintained in the face of environmental stresses.

CONCLUSIONS
we showed a novel essential role for the c. elegans tribbles homolog nipi- <dig> in animal development and viability, which requires nipi-3’s function in multiple tissues. nipi- <dig> acts as a master regulator to prevent improper activation of a c/ebp transcription factor and a conserved pmk-1/p <dig> mapk signalling cascade known to control innate immunity. these findings suggest that innate immune responses are tightly controlled for proper organismal development.
