BACKGROUND
the neonatal heart possesses a temporary robust regeneration potential . the partial apex resection made in the hearts of  <dig> day-old, but not in 7-day-old murine neonates, were shown to heal completely within  <dig> days  <cit> . the observed regeneration process is driven by the division of pre-existing cardiomyocytes  <cit> , though the stem cells have been reported to contribute to heart regeneration to some extent  <cit> . unfortunately, the rate at which cardiomyocytes divide is very low and it is gradually reduced with age  <cit> . the mechanisms that restrict cardiomyocytes ability to divide in response to injury shortly after birth are poorly understood. one of the triggers that contribute to the cardiomyocyte cell cycle arrest is the transfer from the hypoxic to normal oxygen conditions  <cit> . the cell cycle arrest has also been linked with the up-regulation of multiple members of the mir- <dig> family of microrna, that regulate a number of cell cycle genes  <cit> .

another important heart regeneration regulator is the meis <dig> homeodomain transcription factor which targets several cycline-dependent kinase inhibitors  <cit> . additionally, the neonatal heart regeneration capacity has been connected with the yap protein, a hippo signalling pathway transcriptional co-factor, that is essential for proper heart development as it regulates insulin growth factor and wnt signalling pathways  <cit> . moreover, the changes in heart regeneration capacity have been associated with the maturation of immune system, in particular, with a macrophage population existing in the heart of neonatal mice  <cit> .

exploring the mechanisms involved in heart development appears to be crucial in designing a scheme for the successful stimulation of heart regeneration. among the gene regulation mechanisms, dna methylation re-patterning plays an essential role in development, tissue differentiation, and cell specialisation. in vertebrates, dna methylation is primarily observed as a mechanism in which a methyl group is added to cytosines within cpg dinucleotides by dna methyltranferases. dna methylation and demethylation processes together with histone modification affect chromatin condensation and accessibility of transcription factor binding sites, thus either blocking or enabling transcriptional activation. dna methylation at promoter regions is typically associated with transcriptional repression, while that of gene bodies is considered to promote gene expression  <cit> . in this study, the focus is on dna methylation changes that occur in the murine neonatal heart within the first week of life, between the first day of life when the heart is able to regenerate and the seventh day after birth, when this ability to regenerate is lost.

RESULTS
differentially methylated regions
in order to identify the genomic regions that change their dna methylation status in murine hearts shortly after birth, we used the methylated dna immunoprecipitation  approach followed by hybridization with the promoter microarray platform . this platform interrogates  <dig>  cpg islands and  <dig>  promoter regions corresponding to  <dig>  transcripts.

dna methylation profiles in the whole hearts of 1-day  neonates were obtained and compared with those of 7-day , 2-week  and 8-week  old mice. approximately  <dig> differentially methylated genomic regions  were determined  and mapped to  <dig> genes.fig.  <dig> the numbers of differentially methylated dna regions  in murine neonatal hearts. a the numbers of dmrs between d <dig> and d <dig>  w <dig> and w <dig>  b the distribution of the dmrs’ sizes



this number of dmrs includes  <dig> genomic regions where significant changes in dna methylation levels were found between d <dig> and d <dig>  which is to say, before and after the loss of transient regenerative capacity in the neonatal murine heart.  <dig> of these regions corresponding to  <dig> genes were found to show an increase in dna methylation at d <dig> .

sixty of these regions corresponding to  <dig> genes retained an altered dna methylation status until adulthood  . forty two of these genes showed an increase of dna methylation following d <dig>  the complete lists of identified dmrs with their chromosome localisations and mapped annotations are included in additional file 1: f <dig> table  <dig> dna methylation changes in murine hearts following day  <dig> after birth and retained till adulthood

the majority of changes we found within the first week of life involved the gains of dna methylation, while for those identified between d <dig> and w <dig>  as well as, d <dig> and w <dig>  the loss in dna methylation is more prevalent . furthermore, multiple genomic regions showed a transient gain and loss of dna methylation. this indicates the dynamism of epigenetic reprograming in the murine heart within two weeks after birth. the majority of the identified dmrs are between  <dig> and  <dig> bp in length  and they are located more than  <dig> bp upstream of their transcription start sites . the distributions of dmr locations largely correspond to array design . as the majority of hybridization probes in the array correspond to the nucleotide sequences in the vicinity of transcription start sites, a prevailing number of dmrs were mapped to promoter regions .fig.  <dig> genome distribution of differentially methylated regions along the development of murine hearts. a genome distribution of the dmrs: proximal - +500: - <dig> bp from tss, distal - + <dig> : + <dig> bp from tss; intragenic - associated with a cpg island located within a primary transcript; intergenic - located over  <dig> bp upstream and over  <dig> bp downstream of any of primary transcripts in the analysis; b probe distribution on the microarray



gene ontology analysis for genes mapped to differentially methylated regions
a gene ontology analysis, performed with cluego, showed a significant overrepresentation of genes associated with heart development for the regions that gain dna methylation at d <dig>  w <dig> and w <dig> relative to d <dig> . what is more, for the genes associated with the dmrs between d <dig> and w <dig>  the significant functional categories include the regulation of wnt and bmp signalling, as well as the maintenance of somatic stem cells. with regard to revealing potential regulators associated with the epigenetic transition, a prediction of transcriptional factors targeting the differentially methylated genes was carried out . the functional terms connected with the dna methylation increase between d <dig> and d <dig> were clustered into three main categories: cardiovascular system development, anterior/posterior patterns formation, and regulation of rna metabolic process .fig.  <dig> ontology analysis of genes mapped to genomic regions differentially methylated during development of murine heart. a ontological terms associated with the genes overrepresented among the genes mapped to the dmrs between d <dig> and d <dig> , d <dig> and w <dig> , and d <dig> and w <dig> . gene set enrichment analyses were performed and gene ontology annotations were found with cluego. the results are presented as -log. all presented p-values were lower than  <dig> . the numbers of corresponding dmrs are shown in the inset. b transcription factor binding sites enriched for the genes associated with the dmrs between d <dig> and d <dig> , d <dig> and w <dig> , and d <dig> and w <dig> . the analysis was carried out with iregulon. the results are presented as normalized enrichment scores . the numbers of genes associated with the listed terms/transcription factors are shown in parentheses

differentially expressed genes
with a view to investigating the alterations in transcriptome profiles which accompany those of methylome, genome-wide gene expression profiling in the neonatal and adult murine heart tissues was performed using mouse gene expression 12x135k microarray. the array interrogates  <dig>  transcripts corresponding to over  <dig>  genes. additionally, transcriptome profiling of embryonic heart tissues was performed in order to identify the genes which show similar expression profiles in embryos and d <dig> neonates and that are greatly up- or down-regulated in the further phases of development and in adults.

we singled out the genes showing at least a two-fold change in expression between d <dig> and d <dig> and between w <dig> and w8; these genes are further referred to as “differentially expressed”. an ontology analysis performed with cluego shows that a significant group of genes differentially expressed between d <dig> and d <dig> are associated with the regulation of cell morphogenesis  and glucose metabolism , while among those displaying a two-fold change between d <dig> and w <dig>  as well as between d <dig> and w <dig>  there are distinguishing groups connected with the regulation of mitosis and heart development . the genes that show at least a two-fold change in expression observed in the first week of life and are retained until adulthood are shown in table  <dig>  the prediction of transcription factors targeting the differentially expressed genes is presented in fig. 5b.fig.  <dig> ontology analysis of genes differentially expressed during development of murine heart. a the ontological terms were revealed by gene set enrichment analysis for the genes showing at least a two-fold change in expression at d <dig> , w <dig>  and w <dig>  in comparison to d <dig>  gene set enrichment analyses were performed and gene ontology annotations were found with cluego. the results are presented as -log. the numbers of differentially regulated genes are shown in the inset. b transcription factor binding sites enriched for the differentially regulated genes between d <dig> and d <dig> , d <dig> and w <dig> , and d <dig> and w <dig> . the analysis was carried out with iregulon. the results are presented as normalized enrichment scores . the numbers of genes associated with the listed terms/transcription factors are shown in parentheses

changes in dna methylation and gene expression
as a rule, increased dna methylation of promoter regions is correlated with a decrease in the level of gene expression. however, an increase of dna methylation within gene bodies may promote transcription  <cit> . in order to investigate as to whether the alterations of gene methylation profiles in murine hearts observed after birth are reflected in gene expression, we carried out a search for the correlations between the dna methylation and gene expression changes. in this purpose, we paired the genes changing expression by at least  <dig> -fold with their corresponding dmrs. as the result, we identified  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes for which the change of expression can be associated with the dmrs between d <dig> and d <dig>  d <dig> and w <dig>  and d <dig> and w <dig> hearts, respectively . the relationships between dna methylation and gene expression changes are demonstrated using coordinate plots, where the dots in the 1st and the 3rd quadrants represent the positive correlations, while those in the 2nd and the 4th quadrants, the inverse ones . apart from the expected inverse correlations between dna methylation and gene expression, we identified comparable numbers of the positive ones. there are, however, a relatively small fraction of genes in the analysis that displayed correlations, either positive or negative, between dna methylation and gene expression changes, as shown by the venn diagrams in figs.  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  the genes showing transcriptional down-regulation at d <dig> vs. d <dig> accompanied by a gain in dna methylation were significantly enriched in those involved in heart development. no significant ontological categories were determined for the genes displaying transcriptional up-regulation correlated with a decreased dna methylation at d <dig> vs. d <dig>  surprisingly, several developmental genes reported to participate in heart functions, showed an increase in dna methylation and expression at d <dig> vs. d <dig> .table  <dig> numbers and vectors of dna methylation and gene expression changes in murine hearts after birth

validation of microarray results by using quantitative-pcr
the dna methylation and gene expression microarray results were validated for a selection of transcripts and dmrs using qpcr as a reference method. dna methylation levels were estimated by dna digestion with a cpg methylation dependent mcrbc enzyme followed by qpcr quantitation. gene expression levels were determined by using qpcr with primers targeting the transcript regions corresponding to the microarray probes. representative examples of qpcr validations are shown in fig.  <dig> and the complete results are collected in additional file 2: f <dig>  the qpcr quantitation confirmed the microarray results.fig.  <dig> qpcr validation of microarray results for remarkable genes showing significant changes in dna methylation and transcript levels between d <dig> and d <dig> in neonatal murine hearts. the left panels show dna methylation and gene expression microarray results represented by red bars and black markers, respectively; dna methylation is expressed as medip enrichment and gene expression levels as normalized microarray signals. the black markers preceding that indicating the neonatal d <dig> represent gene expression levels in embryonic hearts e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  the middle panels present cpg methylation estimated with methylation dependent restriction digestion followed by quantitative pcr  where the dna methylation levels correspond to the amounts of dna undigested by cpg methylation dependent mcrbc enzyme . the right panels demonstrate transcript levels determined with qpcr as the ratios to the reference transcript of the tbp gene . the microarray results were determined for pooled samples of  <dig> mice. the qpcr results represent average values obtained for three individuals for each developmental time-point. the statistical significance has been determined with two-tailed heteroscedastic student’s t-test. the complete results of qpcr validation are collected in additional file 2: f2



disscussion
it has been recently shown that murine hearts undergo dynamic dna methylation reprogramming after birth, with waves of global dna demethylation and methylation. it has been reported that 5-azacytidine treatment increases cardiomyocyte proliferation in the neonatal heart and it affects cardiomyocyte binucleation  <cit> . what is more, the epigenetic pattern in the cardiomyocytes from the adult injured heart changes to become similar to that in neonates  <cit> . the transcriptional analysis of neonatal ventricles after injury showed a reversion of cardiomyocyte transcription profiles towards a less differentiated state  <cit> .

the study by sim et al.  <cit>  compares global dna methylation profiles of heart left ventricles obtained by the enrichment of methylated dna with methyl-cpg-binding domain followed by dna sequencing  between 1-day- and 2-week-old mice. the article by gilsbach et al.  <cit>  reports the examination of dna methylation profiles in isolated cardiomyocytes from neonatal  and adult  mice performed by genome bisulphite sequencing.

in our study, the changes in the postnatal global dna methylation profiles in the whole murine hearts were examined by using methylated dna immunoprecipitation  followed by microarray analysis targeting promoter regions. we compared dna methylation profiles in the hearts of 1-day-old newborns with those of 7-day-, 2-week-, and 8-week-old mice. since the neonatal heart loses its regeneration capacity within the first week of life, we focused the analysis on dna methylation changes that occur between the days  <dig> and  <dig> 

the number of dna methylation gains exceeds that of losses at d <dig> relative to d <dig>  while the proportion is reversed for the comparison between d <dig> and w <dig> and that between d <dig> and w <dig>  a significant number of genes among those associated with the genomic regions showing an increase in dna methylation from d <dig> to d <dig> are known to participate in heart development. as indicated by bioinformatics tools, the genes exhibiting an increased methylation in the 7-day-old relative to 1-day-old neonates are enriched in the targets of several transcriptional regulators: mef2c, nr2f <dig>  tead <dig>  meis <dig>  and mfsd6l. the first three factors are known for their roles in heart functions and defects. the cardiac specific muscle enhancer factor mef2c together with gata <dig> and tbx <dig>  has been reported to reprogram neonatal fibroblast into cardiomyocyte-like cells  <cit> . the nuclear receptor subfamily  <dig>  group f, member  <dig>  nr2f <dig>  has been associated with congenital heart defects  <cit>  and tetralogy of fallot  <cit>  in humans. the tea domain family member  <dig>  tead <dig> has been demonstrated to induce hypertrophy of rat cardiomyocytes through α1-adrenergic receptor stimulation  <cit>  and to up-regulate hif1α, thus stimulating vascular development and heart recovery after ischemia  <cit> . meis <dig> and mfsd6l have not been reported in the context of heart development to date but, as indicated by the above mentioned bioinformatics prediction, they are likely to target  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, of  <dig> genes mapped to the dmrs hypomethylated at d <dig> relative to d <dig>  nevertheless, the predicted transcriptional factors targeting the differentially methylated and those targeting the differentially expressed genes largely do not overlap . however, we were able to select several genes targeted by the transcriptional regulators mef2c, nr2f <dig>  tead <dig>  meis <dig>  and mfsd6l that display a decrease in expression correlated with a gain in dna methylation at d <dig> as compared to d <dig> .

a number of differentially methylated genes show inverse correlations between the changes in dna methylation and transcription levels observed from d <dig> to d <dig> . the group includes the klf <dig> and bmp <dig> genes, which encode regulatory factors, and myh <dig>  that encodes the heavy subunit of cardiac myosin . it has been reported that cardiomyocyte-specific klf <dig> knock-out mice display an exaggerated expression of cardiac foetal genes after induced cardiac hyperthrophy  <cit>  and the endothelial klf <dig> is up-regulated after the loss of cerebral cavernous malformation signalling, which results in heart failure  <cit> . bmp <dig> together with bmp <dig> play a role in the formation of cardiac cushions  <cit> . bmp <dig> inhibits endothelial-mesenchymal transition, as well as cardiac fibrosis after heart injury  <cit> .

multiple other genes show inverse correlations between promoter dna methylation and transcript levels changes in the course of heart development . representative examples of such genes include: neat <dig>  zbtb <dig>  tnni <dig>  and fzd <dig>  neat <dig> and zbtb <dig> show an increase in expression correlated with a decrease in dna methylation along the development . neat <dig> is a gene of long non-coding rna which acts as a core structural component of nuclear paraspeckles. neat <dig> is expressed in various tissues and it has been reported to protect the heart from pathological hypertrophy  <cit> . zbtb <dig> encodes a transcription factor associated with cell cycle progression. tnni <dig> and fzd <dig> display decreasing expression connected with increasing dna methylation within heart development . tnni <dig> is a gene of a foetal muscle troponin  <cit> . fzd <dig> encodes a receptor of wnt signalling, which plays an important role in heart development and in heart tissue remodelling under pathological conditions  <cit> .

we found that a number of genes exhibited positive correlations between dna methylation and gene expression changes between d <dig> and d <dig> . we observed an increase in promoter dna methylation and expression for a remarkable group of genes participating in heart functions and development such as myh7b and bmp <dig> . this observation could be explained by cell specialisation in the growing hearts.

it is also important to stress that in this research dna and rna were extracted from whole hearts, therefore the observed differences pertain to mixed cell populations including cardiomyocytes, fibroblast and endothelial cells. the limited ability of cardiomyocytes to proliferate shifts the focus of heart regeneration studies on this type of cells. however, the involvement of cardiac fibroblasts is also worth exploring as the secretory functions of fibroblasts and their role in scar formation should be taken into consideration.

CONCLUSIONS
this may be considered the first report to show the changes in dna methylation profiles in the neonatal murine hearts between day  <dig> and day  <dig> points in time which delineate the transient regenerative ability of neonatal murine hearts. the results indicate a number of differentially methylated regions between day  <dig> and day  <dig>  most of them increasing dna methylation at day  <dig>  the dmrs are significantly enriched in genes associated with muscle development and embryonic morphogenesis that are also critical for proper heart maturation. the results of this study indicate a group of transcriptional regulators which target the genes displaying decreased methylation at day  <dig> vs. day  <dig>  three of them mef2c, nr2f <dig>  tead <dig> are known to participate in heart development and functions, thus suggesting their involvement in the regenerative repair in neonatal hearts. two other regulators: mfsd6l and meis <dig>  are not known to have been reported in the context of the heart. our findings show that dna methylation changes, largely an increase in gene methylation, is accompanied by a decrease of heart regenerative ability in the first week of life in neonatal mice. in addition, the results indicate candidate genes and transcription factors involved in the process.
