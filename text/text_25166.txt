BACKGROUND
the adipose tissue plays a central role in maintaining whole body lipid and glucose homeostasis as well as insulin sensitivity  <cit> . adipocytes are derived from fibroblastic precursors in the adipose tissue through a tightly regulated differentiation process. the molecular basis for the regulation of adipogenesis has been studied extensively in vitro using a variety of preadipocyte cell culture models. in particular, studies of the 3t3-l <dig> cell line derived from mouse embryo fibroblasts  <cit>  have been valuable for gaining insight into the ordered cascade of molecular events required for adipogenesis  <cit> . more recently, human cell culture models have become available including the sgbs cell line derived from preadipocytes from a patient with simpson-golabi-behmel syndrome  <cit> .

the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor  is a key regulator of adipogenesis, required for in vitro as well as in vivo differentiation of adipocytes  <cit> . in addition to pparγ, a number of other important transcriptional regulators of adipocyte differentiation have been identified  <cit> , including members of the ccaat/enhancer binding protein  family  <cit> . c/ebpα is induced late in adipocyte differentiation and is known to cooperate with pparγ in induction of at least a subset of adipocyte-specific genes. in addition, these two factors induce the expression of each other  <cit> . two other members of the c/ebp family, c/ebpβ and -δ, are directly involved in the transcriptional induction of pparγ and c/ebpα  <cit> .

we recently used chromatin immunoprecipitation  combined with deep sequencing  to generate genome-wide maps of the binding sites of pparγ and its heterodimerization partner retinoid × receptor  during differentiation of 3t3-l <dig> adipocytes  <cit> . in addition, we profiled rna polymerase ii  occupancy to measure active transcription at different time points during differentiation. this study revealed that pparγ:rxr binding was highly enriched in the vicinity of genes upregulated during adipogenesis. in fact, the majority  of all highly up-regulated genes have pparγ:rxr binding in the immediate vicinity  <cit> . similarly, lazar and colleagues  <cit>  and others  <cit>  used chip in combination with hybridization to genomic tiling microarrays  or cloning followed by sequencing  to map pparγ binding sites in 3t3-l <dig> adipocytes . intriguingly, these studies have revealed that the c/ebpα consensus site is highly over-represented under the binding regions of pparγ. lazar and colleagues profiled c/ebpα binding sites in mature 3t3-l <dig> adipocytes and found a remarkable overlap between c/ebpα and pparγ binding  on a genome-wide scale  <cit> . importantly, 60% of the genes induced during adipogenesis have both c/ebpα and pparγ binding sites within  <dig> kb of a transcription start site , and knockdown studies indicated that both c/ebpα and pparγ are required for robust gene expression of a few selected adipocyte specific target genes. cumulatively, these results indicate that both pparγ and c/ebpα are directly involved in the activation of the majority of adipocyte-specific genes and that they cooperate through binding to adjacent sites on dna.

genome-wide profiling has also made it possible to study the evolution of gene regulation by mapping the sites for the same transcription factors in different species. this is typically done by aligning genomes of the two species and tabulating the number of detected sites in one species that are in the corresponding region in the other species. this means that a genomic region might be highly conserved in terms of nucleotides but may or may not bind the transcription factor in question in both species. to distinguish between genome sequence conservation and transcription factor binding site conservation, we will use the word "retention" to describe binding sites that are present in both species in the corresponding genomic region.

notably, whereas the functional gene targets of a particular transcription factor are generally well conserved between species, it has been shown that the majority of binding sites for all transcription factors investigated to date are species-specific  <cit> , reviewed in  <cit> . this is surprising given that sequence conservation has been successfully used to enhance regulatory site prediction in proximal promoters   <cit> ; however, this might reflect that these older studies were focused on limited sets of sites often located in tissue-specific promoters, while genome-wide methods, such as chip-seq, are independent of previous annotations. consistent with the species specificity of transcription factor binding sites, rosen and colleagues recently compared pparγ binding in 3t3-l <dig> adipocytes and in vitro differentiated primary human adipose stromal cells , and found that only  <dig> % of the murine binding sites were retained in human adipocytes. by contrast, the association of pparγ with adipocyte gene regulation appeared to be better retained than the specific binding sites, and the overall gene expression profiles were well conserved  <cit> . rosen and colleagues also showed that genes associated with a conserved pparγ binding site are more likely to be upregulated during adipogenesis than genes associated with a species specific site  <cit> , indicating that retention of pparγ binding is increased near upregulated genes.

while previous reports agree that retention of transcription factor binding sites is limited, systematic analysis of the biological features determining whether a site is retained or not has not been performed. in particular, the interdependence between retention of the transcription factor binding sites of two transcription factors has not been investigated. here, we used chip-seq to generate genome-wide binding profiles of c/ebpα and pparγ in human sgbs adipocytes, compared these to previously published profiles in mouse 3t3-l <dig> adipocytes  <cit> , and systematically studied what features affect whether a binding site is retained between species or not.

we find that pparγ binding sites have higher retention near genes upregulated during adipogenesis, and that regions bound by both factors are even more likely to be retained. interestingly, pparγ binding site retention in these co-bound regions is increased by the presence of a c/ebpα consensus site, suggesting that c/ebpα may facilitate pparγ binding to dna. at the same time, and independent of c/ebpα and pparγ sequence patterns, sequence conservation in the larger region surrounding the actual binding sites has a positive impact on retention of both c/ebpα and pparγ binding sites, indicating that other dna sequence patterns also affect binding of these two factors to dna.

RESULTS
genome-wide mapping of c/ebpα and pparγ binding in human sgbs adipocytes
to compare c/ebpα and pparγ binding in mouse and human adipocytes, we used chip-seq to generate genome-wide profiles of c/ebpα and pparγ binding in human sgbs adipocytes. mapped chip tags were analyzed using peak finder methods, which identify regions enriched for chip tags. for simplicity, we will refer to such regions as "sites", but it is important to notice that these regions are typically 100- <dig> nt wide  and thus several magnitudes larger than the actual binding site . we used the macs peak finder  <cit>  to identify regions consistently bound by c/ebpα and pparγ in two biologically independent experiments. we detected  <dig>  c/ebpα and  <dig>  pparγ binding sites in human sgbs adipocytes, and in accordance with previous findings in mouse  <cit> , we found that  <dig> % of pparγ binding sites are also bound by c/ebpα. the number of pparγ sites is comparable to the  <dig>  sites recently reported by rosen and colleagues for in vitro differentiated hascs  <cit> . however, the numbers are notably higher than the corresponding numbers in 3t3-l <dig> cells, where  <dig>   <cit>  and  <dig>   c/ebpα sites and  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig>  <cit>  pparγ sites were reported. it remains to be investigated whether this represents a true species-specific difference, or whether this is more related to technical issues such as antibody specificity or cell culture conditions.

we have previously reported that binding profiles of pparγ in 3t3-l <dig> s vary significantly between individual experiments and laboratories  <cit> . similarly, when comparing the pparγ sites of our own chip-seq study  <cit> , the chip-seq study of rosen and colleagues  <cit> , and the chip-chip study by lazar and colleagues  <cit>  only approximately 50% of the detected peaks were shared between  <dig> experiments, and only  <dig> of a total of  <dig>  peaks  were shared between all  <dig> experiments . to infer high confidence binding sites occupied by c/ebpα and pparγ in mouse adipocytes, we used only the  <dig> c/ebpα and  <dig> pparγ binding sites from our chip-seq analysis that overlap with the previously published chip-chip sites  <cit> . the inferred high confidence c/ebpα and pparγ binding sites have a smaller overlap of 36% , compared with the previously reported >60%  <cit> . possible explanations may be the higher resolution of the chip-seq data as well as the fact that the number of high confidence sites used is lower.

correlating binding sites with gene expression patterns during adipogenesis
we previously identified  <dig> genes which were differentially expressed during 3t3-l <dig> adipogenesis as assessed by rnapii association to the respective genes  <cit> . in that study, these genes were clustered in  <dig> different expression clusters depending on their relative expression profile during differentiation. for the purpose of this study we combined the two clusters containing genes downregulated during 3t3-l <dig> adipogenesis. this resulted in four new clusters: downregulated , transiently upregulated , moderately upregulated , and highly upregulated  . for each gene belonging to a particular cluster, we divided the genomic region at +/-  <dig> kb around tss into  <dig> kb intervals  and counted the number of mouse pparγ binding sites within each such intervals. the pparγ binding sites are enriched in the vicinity of all regulated genes compared to randomly selected regions . moreover and consistent with previous findings  <cit> , pparγ binding sites in mouse adipocytes are highly enriched in the vicinity of genes moderately  and highly  upregulated during adipogenesis . similarly, pparγ binding sites are also enriched in the vicinity of the human gene orthologs of the genes in these clusters , consistent with a role for pparγ in the regulation of these genes in sgbs adipocytes.

measuring retention of mouse binding sites in human
to study the retention of c/ebpα and pparγ binding sites between mouse and human adipocytes, we used human-mouse genome alignments  <cit>  to identify human genome regions orthologous to c/ebpα and pparγ sites in mouse . to make sure that the sites were orthologous at genome sequence level, a mouse site had to map to a single location in the human genome, which in turn had to map back to the original site in mouse. we did not address site loss or gain due to large deletions or insertions in one species. this resulted in  <dig> pparγ and  <dig> c/ebpα mouse sites that could be mapped to the human genome .

we defined a mouse binding site as retained when its corresponding human coordinates overlapped a human binding site . a potential problem with this approach is that it will be dependent on the thresholds used in peak finding, and it also models average transcription factor binding in a cell population as on-off events, which is a large simplification. since the relative number of chip'ed sequence tags in a region will indicate the average "strength" of the binding, i.e. average occupancy time, we also measured retention in a complementary way. thus, in a human genomic region corresponding to a mouse binding site, we counted the number of chip'ed tags from the transcription factor in question and calculated a log enrichment relative to the genomic background in human . the advantage of this approach compared to the above method is that the retention of sites will not be on-off  events but a continuous measure, and weaker cases of retention may be discovered. we will refer to these two methods to measure the amount of site retention as the binary and enrichment method, respectively.

using the binary method, we find that most binding sites are species specific; only  <dig> % of c/ebpα and  <dig> % of pparγ binding sites in mouse adipocytes are retained in human adipocytes . the enrichment analysis supports the binary analysis in that most of the enrichment values for both factors are located around  <dig>  which is expected by random, and in that many of the mouse sites map to human regions that are totally devoid of chip-seq tags  .

conversely, there are sites that we with high confidence can label as retained between species. we noticed that there are larger genomic regions in which the majority of c/ebpα and pparγ binding are retained as exemplified by the pparg <dig> locus . given the crucial role of pparγ in adipocyte differentiation, it is tempting to suggest that the reason that these particular sites are retained is their importance for the overall regulatory regime, since they likely regulate a key transcription factor. prompted by this observation, we proceeded to systematically identify biological features that are positively correlated with increased retention of pparγ and c/ebpα sites, with the hope of increasing our understanding of adipocyte gene regulation.

retention of pparγ binding sites is increased in the vicinity of genes up-regulated during 3t3-l <dig> adipogenesis
several studies have reported that retention of binding sites is generally higher in the vicinity of putative key target genes  <cit> . however, species-specific binding sites are also enriched in these regions, and no studies have addressed whether the relative retention of binding sites  is increased in the vicinity of putative target genes of the transcription factor. the assignment of target genes for binding sites is not trivial. most studies agree that sites proximal to a gene are more likely to regulate the gene in question but this is not an absolute truth. in light of this, we used a combination of distance and gene expression to associate genes and binding sites. thus, to systematically investigate how binding site retention is affected by the vicinity to putative target genes, we labeled sites in the following way. first, for each binding site, we located the closest gene tss. if this tss was closer than  <dig> kb, and the gene was within one of the pre-defined expression clusters shown in figure  <dig> , the site was labeled with the corresponding cluster number . sites where the closest tss was closer than  <dig> kb but the gene was not part of any expression cluster  were defined to belong to a new cluster, cluster  <dig> . finally, all sites with no gene tss within  <dig> kb were defined to belong to a new cluster: cluster  <dig> . there are obviously many ways to assign binding sites to putative target genes. however, the overall results described below are not specific to the cluster assignment method used. for instance, assigning sites to expression clusters only based on the identity of the closest gene gave very similar results .

we then measured the fraction of mouse c/ebpα and pparγ binding sites that was retained and lost in human. the fraction of retained pparγ binding sites is significantly higher in the vicinity of genes that are moderately or highly upregulated  compared to all other binding sites . conversely, retention of c/ebpα sites appears to be slightly increased in the vicinity of highly upregulated genes  compared to all other binding sites, but the difference is not statistically significant  . this is also true if assessing retention by the enrichment method  . further analysis of the enrichment values showed that also mouse c/ebpα and pparγ binding sites associated with moderately and highly upregulated genes  have on average more chip tags  than other sites  . thus, target sites in the vicinity of cluster  <dig> genes are on average bound more strongly by c/ebpα and pparγ than sites in the vicinity of other genes . this raised the question whether the binding strength in mouse, as measured by the number of chip tags, is indicative of binding site retention in human. therefore, we divided mouse binding sites into quartiles according to binding strength and analyzed retention of c/ebpα and pparγ binding in these subgroups . indeed, mouse sites that are strongly bound by either factor are more likely to be retained in human.

turnover of pparγ binding is increased in the vicinity of genes upregulated during 3t3-l <dig> adipogenesis
as discussed above, most mouse sites are not retained in human. however, gene regulation may be retained, if a lost site is replaced by another species-specific site in human nearby the "original" mouse site  <cit> . we will refer to this scenario as site turnover. here we defined turnover as a case where a mouse binding site is lost at the corresponding region in human, but compensated by a human-specific site within  <dig> kb of the location of the lost site in human. employing these criteria, we analyzed turnover of c/ebpα and pparγ binding sites assigned to the different gene expression clusters. interestingly, the turnover of pparγ binding sites is highly increased for sites close to moderately or highly upregulated genes   . in particular, >60% of pparγ binding sites in the vicinity of highly upregulated genes in mouse adipocytes are either retained or undergo turnover in human adipocytes. moreover, the highly upregulated genes are much more likely than genes in other clusters to gain multiple human specific pparγ binding sites in human adipocytes . by contrast, human-specific c/ebpα sites are found more evenly distributed in the different clusters .

retention of c/ebpα and pparγ binding is increased at regions bound by both c/ebpα and pparγ
as discussed above, a large fraction of pparγ binding sites  are also bound by c/ebpα. to assess the importance of this overlap, we compared the retention of mouse sites that consist of either: i) overlapping pparγ and c/ebpα sites, ii) a single pparγ site or iii) a single c/ebpα site . we will refer to these cases as 'overlapping sites' and pparγ- or c/ebpα-only sites, respectively. the sites in the overlapping group are retained to a higher degree than the other two categories using the binary method  ; and this is also true if the enrichment method is used  . interestingly, the overlapping sites are primarily retained as overlapping sites in human, whereas pparγ-only and c/ebpα-only sites are primarily retained as such . however, a few percent of pparγ and c/ebpα-only sites in mouse are detected as overlapping sites in human. we cannot exclude that some of these could be the result of threshold issues in the mouse dataset.

since we now established that both the expression pattern of nearby genes and co-binding of pparγ and c/ebpα have an impact on retention of sites, we proceeded to see how these two associations are depending on one another. about 20% of c/ebpα-only sites are retained in human, regardless of expression pattern of nearby genes , but c/ebpα binding sites overlapping pparγ sites have a significantly higher retention if they are in the vicinity of moderately or highly upregulated genes  . thus, the increased retention of c/ebpα binding in the vicinity of highly upregulated genes , originates from increased retention of the binding sites that overlap with pparγ binding.

for pparγ-only sites there are large differences in the amount of retention depending on which gene expression cluster the sites are assigned to, with sites close to highly upregulated genes most likely to be retained . by contrast, retention of pparγ sites overlapping with c/ebpα is less affected by proximity to highly upregulated genes  . interestingly, retention of pparγ sites near highly upregulated genes is not affected by overlap with c/ebpα . overall these findings are supported by the enrichment analysis , although in this case, the enrichment of c/ebpα sites that overlap with pparγ sites near moderately and highly upregulated genes is only close to significant , and the enrichment of pparγ sites that overlap with c/ebpα sites near highly upregulated genes is now significantly higher than for other pparγ sites overlapping c/ebpα .

c/ebpα sequence patterns are indicative of pparγ retention in human but not vice versa
to further investigate the interdependence of retention of c/ebpα and pparγ binding at overlapping sites, we wanted to assess whether the presence of predicted binding sites  for the respective factors in human were indicative of retention of mouse binding sites in human. we scanned each of the human regions orthologous to mouse pparγ and c/ebpα binding sites with position weight matrices   describing the dna binding preference of c/ebpα and pparγ. we used thresholds defined by simulation studies , and noted whether each binding site had one or more consensus sites for the respective factor. for this analysis, it is important to consider that the consensus site for c/ebpα is similar to that of most other members of the c/ebp family. as expected, pparγ-binding sites in mouse are more likely to be retained in human if the corresponding human region has a pparγ consensus site, and mouse c/ebpα binding sites are also more likely to be retained if their corresponding human regions have a c/ebp consensus sites  .

interestingly, we found that pparγ binding sites overlapping c/ebpα sites in mouse are more likely to be retained as pparγ binding sites in human if they have a c/ebp consensus site . we noticed the same tendency for pparγ binding sites not overlapping c/ebpα sites in mouse, although this trend is not strong enough to be statistically significant . however, the opposite is not true, i.e. pparγ consensus sites have no impact on the retention of mouse c/ebpα binding sites in human  .

one way to interpret this is that for regions bound by both factors, the c/ebp consensus site is being selected for over evolution rather than the pparγ consensus site, which would indicate that pparγ binding is dependent on sequence-specific c/ebp binding. there are several mechanisms that could explain this, including pparγ binding to suboptimal sites with the help of c/ebpα, indirect binding by tethering to c/ebpα, and indirect binding via long range chromosomal loops  <cit> .

it is likely that in addition to c/ebpα, several other transcription factors cooperate with pparγ in the transactivation of nearby genes, and some of these factors may also cooperate with pparγ in dna binding. such cooperativity would be expected to contribute to the retention of pparγ sites. we investigated how the evolutionary constraint on the overall dna sequence within the binding region of each mouse pparγ and c/ebpα binding site affects retention of these binding sites in human. we found that regions with high mouse-human dna sequence identity have higher retention of both c/ebpα and pparγ binding . interestingly, the "high identity quartile" is not enriched for regions containing c/ebpα and pparγ consensus sites , indicating that other sequence patterns/transcription factors are also important for retention of c/ebpα and pparγ binding.

discussion
in this study, we used chip-seq to generate genome-wide profiles of the binding sites of the major adipogenic transcription factors, c/ebpα and pparγ, in mature human sgbs adipocytes. we identified  <dig>  c/ebpα and  <dig>  pparγ binding sites, and consistent with previous studies in mouse adipocytes  <cit>  we found that pparγ binding sites are highly enriched in the vicinity of genes upregulated during adipogenesis. furthermore, and also consistent with what has been reported for mouse adipocytes  <cit> , a high percentage  of the pparγ binding sites overlap with c/ebpα binding sites. thus, these data indicate conservation of the overall regulatory regime of c/ebpα and pparγ between mouse and human adipocytes, including their potential direct cooperativity through binding to adjacent sites. however, despite the conservation of the overall regulatory regime and putative target genes between mouse and human adipocytes the retention of mouse binding sites in human is limited, i.e. most sites are species-specific. similar results demonstrating limited retention of binding sites despite extensive conservation of association with putative functional targets have previously been reported for other transcription factors  <cit> , and was recently also reported by rosen and colleagues when comparing pparγ binding sites in primary human in vitro differentiated adipocytes with the binding sites identified in murine 3t3-l <dig> cells  <cit> .

despite the fact that most binding sites of pparγ and c/ebpα are species-specific, there are some sites that we can confidently classify as retained between human and mouse. there are also larger genomic regions, like the pparg <dig> locus, where most sites are retained . this observation prompted us to systematically investigate what biological features determine whether a site is retained or not. thus, we have systematically investigated several biological features that could affect the retention of mouse c/ebpα and pparγ binding sites, using two complementary methods with different advantages, i.e. a binary approach where overlaps of sites are counted, and an enrichment approach where the signal strength of human chip reads is assessed. the binary approach has the advantage of being conservative , and it is easier to interpret the outcomes as sites can be either lost or retained. conversely, the enrichment method can take weaker sites into account and is not dependent on specific thresholds in peak finding; however, this method will not clearly define what sites are retained and lost, as it imposes no thresholds on the data.

regardless of method, we find that there is a significantly increased retention as well as turn-over of pparγ binding sites in the vicinity of genes upregulated during adipogenesis compared with binding sites more distant from such genes. by contrast, retention of c/ebpα binding is only slightly increased in the vicinity of genes that are highly upregulated. the difference indicates that there is a higher evolutionary pressure to maintain specific pparγ binding sites compared with specific c/ebpα binding sites for the regulation of adipocyte differentiation and function. this may reflect the higher importance of pparγ over c/ebpα in adipocyte differentiation, as most clearly demonstrated by spiegelmann and colleagues, who showed that that ectopic expression of pparγ in c/ebpα -/- mouse embryo fibroblasts   <cit> , but not c/ebpα in pparγ -/- mefs  <cit> , can induce adipogenesis. in addition, since there are more c/ebpα binding sites than pparγ binding sites there may be less evolutionary constraint on the individual c/ebpα sites. this could reflect the lower binding specificity of c/ebpα, since it is easier to create a new site if the factor can bind to many different sequences.

we also observed that mouse sites that are strongly bound by either factor are more likely to be retained, but the causality is unclear. stronger binding sites could be under higher selective pressure, since they are more likely to have a vital function. in addition, stronger binding sites could be harder to erode over time, as these are likely to represent sites where multiple factors such as co-binding transcription factors and chromatin accessibility contribute to a high occupancy of the site. thus, strongly bound sites in a common ancestor between two species might require more evolutionary changes to be reduced to a fully inactive site in one species.

the remarkable overlap between pparγ and c/ebpα binding reported previously  <cit>  indicates cooperativity between the two transcription factors. in support of this, we find that retention of both c/ebpα and pparγ binding is increased, when the binding sites overlap with a binding site of the other factor, suggesting that a potential synergy between these two factors is of such significance that selective pressure on these overlapping sites is increased. interestingly, while retention of c/ebpα-only sites is not affected by vicinity to regulated genes, the c/ebpα sites that overlap with pparγ sites display increased retention in the vicinity of upregulated genes, further indicating an importance of c/ebpα co-binding with pparγ in adipocyte gene regulation.

we also analyzed the sequence of human genomic regions corresponding to overlapping pparγ and c/ebpα binding sites in mouse adipocytes. these analyses revealed that presence of the c/ebp consensus sequence in the human sequence not only predicts the retention of c/ebpα binding but, surprisingly, also retention of pparγ binding at sites that overlap with c/ebpα binding sites in mouse. by contrast, the ppar consensus sequence in the human sequence only predicts retention of pparγ binding, not retention of c/ebpα binding at sites overlapping with pparγ binding sites. this indicates that at these overlapping sites, the c/ebp consensus sequence in the binding region is being selected for over evolution to a higher degree than the ppar consensus site, suggesting that pparγ binding is directed by c/ebpα binding. by analogy, differential binding of nuclear factor κb  in  <dig> human individuals correlates with changes in a consensus sites of a reported cooperating transcription factor, signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig>   <cit> , and similar results have been found in studies in yeast  <cit>  and fungi  <cit> .

possible mechanisms explaining the interdependence between observed c/ebp consensus site conservation and pparγ retention include c/ebp-assisted binding of pparγ to an adjacent consensus site as well as indirect binding of pparγ to dna by tethering to c/ebpα or by long range intrachromosomal loops  <cit> . lazar and colleagues have previously investigated the interdependence of c/ebpα and pparγ binding in mature 3t3-l <dig> adipocytes and failed to see an effect of c/ebpα knockdown on pparγ binding to selected target sites in mature 3t3-l <dig> adipocytes  <cit> . however, since only a few sites were investigated it is difficult to conclude on the general importance. furthermore, it is possible that other members of the c/ebp family, which all share the same consensus sequence, play a role in the establishment of the pparγ transcriptional complex during adipogenesis and a more limited role once the complex is established. intriguingly, recent data from our laboratory indicate that c/ebpβ, which is expressed early in differentiation, may play a role in early chromatin remodeling of pparγ binding sites ).

odom and colleagues have previously shown that the transcription factor binding regions that were retained between multiple species had higher sequence constraint than species specific binding regions  <cit> , however the interdependence between conservation of the region around the bound site and the retention of the consensus site was not addressed. interestingly, we show here that the high identity quartile of binding sites  displayed increased retention of c/ebpα and pparγ binding independent of conservation of their respective consensus sites. this strongly indicates that additional sequence patterns are important for c/ebpα and pparγ binding. such sequence patterns could among others be directing binding of cooperating transcription factors.

CONCLUSIONS
here we have performed a comprehensive and systematic analysis to investigate what parameters affect the retention of transcription factors binding between the mouse and human genome. we show that retention of pparγ and c/ebpα binding between mouse and human adipocytes is interdependent, which strongly indicates that these transcription factors cooperate at the level of gaining access to their target sites in the genome. in addition, our data show that overall sequence conservation of the binding region contributes to retention, suggesting that other sequence patterns contribute to retention. future experimental analyses will be required to dissect the interdependence of pparγ and c/ebpα and possibly other transcription factors at a molecular level.
