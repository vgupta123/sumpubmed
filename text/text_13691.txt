BACKGROUND
natural vitamin b <dig> consists of six interconvertible compounds, pyridoxine, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine and their phosphorylated derivatives, pyridoxine 5'-phosphate, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate  <cit> . most bacteria, fungi and plants possess vitamin b <dig> biosynthesis pathways, but mammals must acquire the vitamin in their diet. in plants, the de novo pathway of vitamin b <dig> biosynthesis relies on two proteins, pdx <dig> and pdx <dig>  which function as a glutamine amidotransferase and produce pyridoxal-phosphate from intermediates of glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway  <cit> . pdx <dig> and pdx <dig> work together, with the latter protein as the glutaminase and the former as the synthase domain.

vitamin b <dig> plays essential roles as a cofactor in a wide range of biochemical reactions, predominantly in amino acid metabolism  <cit> . recently, besides their classical role as coenzymes, a new function has emerged for the various vitamin b <dig> compounds in cellular antioxidant defense. a link between vitamin b <dig> and oxidative stress was originally established in the phytopathogenic fungus cercospora nicotianae. mutant strains were identified that were particularly vulnerable to their own toxin cercosporin, a photosensitizer that produces singlet oxygen  in the light  <cit> . unexpectedly, cloning of the mutant genes in c. nicotianae revealed that the mutated fungi were affected in a gene of the vitamin b <dig> biosynthesis pathway  <cit> . subsequently, it was shown in vitro that vitamin b <dig> is able to quench 1o <dig> with a high efficiency  <cit> . additional analyses revealed that vitamin b <dig> is also able to quench superoxide  <cit> . the antioxidant capacities of vitamin b <dig> were confirmed in yeast or animal cell cultures supplied with exogenous vitamin b <dig> compounds and exposed to different oxidative treatments  <cit> . similarly, exogenously applied vitamin b <dig> was found to protect plant protoplasts against 1o2-induced cell death  <cit> . these in vitro results indicate that vitamin b <dig> is a potential antioxidant and raise the question as to whether plants employ vitamin b <dig> to protect themselves against reactive oxygen species , particularly 1o <dig>  several mutants of arabidopsis thaliana defective in vitamin b <dig> biosynthesis have been recently isolated which could help answering this question. a knock out of the single pdx <dig> gene is lethal for arabidopsis  <cit> . there are  <dig> homologues of pdx <dig> in arabidopsis, pdx <dig> , pdx <dig>  and pdx <dig> . two of these  have been shown to be functional in vitamin b <dig> synthesis  <cit> . while disruption of both genes causes lethality, the single mutants pdx <dig>  and pdx <dig>  are viable, indicating that one gene can compensate, at least partially, for the lack of the other. however, pdx <dig>  is more highly expressed than pdx <dig> , and a pdx <dig>  knockout accumulates less vitamin b <dig> --about 30-40% of the wild type  level) and has a more severe mutant phenotype in sterile medium  <cit> . thus, pdx <dig>  appears to be more important for vitamin b <dig> synthesis than pdx <dig> .

when grown in sterile medium in the absence of vitamin b <dig>  seedlings of the pdx <dig>  mutant are strongly reduced in shoot growth and primary root growth  <cit> . under these conditions, mutant seedlings were also found to be more sensitive to the 1o2-generating dye rose bengal, to salt stress and to uv radiation relative to wt seedlings  <cit> . although this is consistent with the idea that vitamin b <dig> could play a role in planta as an antioxidant, it is difficult to draw a definite conclusion because of the rather severe phenotype of the mutant in sterile culture. interestingly, when grown on soil, the mutant phenotype of the pdx <dig>  mutant was much less pronounced. the reason for the less severe phenotype in soil is unknown. it has been suggested that there is a source of the vitamin in the soil  <cit> . however, the vitamin b <dig> concentration in the leaves of pdx <dig>  mutant plants grown on soil remains very low compared to wt  <cit> . alternatively, it is possible that growth in sterile medium in a petri dish represents a form of stress to which plants with low levels of vitamin b <dig> are more sensitive. in this study, we took advantage of the nearly normal development of the vitamin b6-deficient pdx <dig>  arabidopsis mutant grown on soil to explore in detail the possibility that this vitamin functions as a photoprotector and an antioxidant in plants. we show that vitamin b <dig> acts as a new class of 1o <dig> quencher, thereby protecting plants against photooxidative stress.

RESULTS
growth and leaf chlorophyll content of pdx <dig> plants
vitamin b6-deficient pdx <dig>  plants grown on soil  looked similar to wt plants, except that young leaves in the center of the rosette were paler  as previously reported  <cit> . this was due to a decrease in photosynthetic pigments : both chlorophylls  and carotenoids were reduced by about 15-20%, and this was accompanied by a significant increase in the chl a/b ratio. this reduction of the pigment content tended to disappear in mature, well developed mutant leaves. we also measured the concentration of various chl precursors in young leaves . no significant change was observed in protochlorophyllide  and chlorophyllide  levels between wt and mutant leaves. in contrast, a decrease in the geranylgeranylated forms of chl, namely geranylgeranyl chl , dihydrogeranylgeranyl chl  and tetrahydrogeranylgeranyl chl  was found in young leaves of the pdx <dig> mutant. it is known from studies of etiolated seedlings that gg-chl is formed through a preferential esterification of chlide by geranylgeranyl disphosphate catalyzed by the enzyme chl synthase  <cit> . gg-chl is then reduced stepwise to chl via dhgg-chl and thgg-chl by geranylgeranyl reductase  <cit> . therefore, the marked decrease in gg-chl and other geranylgeranylated intermediates in leaves of the pdx <dig> mutant suggests that the chl synthase activity is somehow affected by the pdx <dig> mutation, ultimately leading to a reduction in chl concentration in the leaves. therefore, it is likely that either the catalytic activity of chl synthase itself is inhibited or that levels of the substrate geranylgeranyl diphosphate are more limiting. however, the unchanged level of tocopherols in the pdx <dig> mutant  would suggest that levels of geranylgeranyl phosphate are not limiting. moreover, a rice mutant with impaired chlide esterification by chl synthase has a phenotype that strongly resembles pdx <dig> mutants: decreased chl levels were associated with an increased chl a/b ratio in young plants, and these effects progressively disappeared as leaves matured  <cit> . we also found that the change in chl content of leaves of the pdx <dig> mutant relative to wt leaves was strongly dependent on light intensity : the difference in chl concentration and in the chl a/b ratio between wt and pdx <dig> was strongly attenuated when plants were grown in low light  and was enhanced when plants were grown in high light .

the decrease in photosynthetic pigments in leaves of the pdx <dig> mutant was not associated with substantial changes in photosynthetic electron transport. the quantum yield of linear electron transport measured by chl fluorometry was comparable in wt and pdx <dig> leaves . similarly, the rate of o <dig> evolution measured with a clark electrode did not appear to be affected by the pdx <dig> mutation . also, neither shoot growth or root growth were significantly affected by inactivation of the pdx <dig>  gene . normal development of vitamin b6-deficient shoot grown on soil was previously reported  <cit> . clearly this was also the case for root development in soil.

we observed a difference in nonphotochemical energy quenching  between wt leaves and leaves of the pdx <dig> mutant, with npq being enhanced in the latter leaves, particularly at high photon flux densities  above  <dig> Î¼mol photons m- <dig> s- <dig> . npq is a photoprotective mechanism that requires a transthylakoid ph gradient and the synthesis of zeaxanthin from violaxanthin in the light-harvesting antennae of psii  <cit> . the increased npq in the pdx <dig> mutant is thus consistent with the increased rate of photoconversion of violaxanthin to zeaxanthin: zeaxanthin synthesis in high light was faster, and the final extent of conversion was increased in the pdx <dig> mutant relative to wt .

in vitro sensitivity of vitamin b6-deficient leaves to ros
leaf discs were exposed to eosin, a xanthene dye that generates 1o <dig> in the light  <cit> . illuminating leaf discs floating on a solution  of eosin has been previously shown to cause leaf photooxidation and lipid peroxidation  <cit> . we visualized the effect of eosin by autoluminescence imaging. this technique measures the faint light emitted by triplet carbonyls and 1o <dig>  the by-products of the slow and spontaneous decomposition of lipid hydroperoxides and endoperoxides  <cit> . deactivation of excited carbonyls and 1o <dig> produces photons  which can be recorded with a high-sensitivity, cooled ccd  camera  <cit> . this technique has been used to map lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress in various biological materials including detached leaves  <cit> , whole plants  <cit> , animals  <cit>  and humans  <cit> . as shown in fig. 4a, 1o2-induced lipid peroxidation was associated with a marked enhancement of leaf disc autoluminescence, as expected. interestingly, the increase in autoluminescence was more pronounced in discs punched out from pdx <dig> leaves than in wt discs . we quantified the autoluminescence intensity, and we found a 50%-increase in the pdx <dig> mutant relative to wt . thus, the pdx <dig> mutant appeared to be more sensitive to 1o <dig> toxicity than wt. this was confirmed by thermoluminescence analyses of lipid peroxidation . thermal decomposition of lipid hydroperoxides is associated with photon emission in the 120-140Â°c range  <cit> . the amplitude of the thermoluminescence band peaking at ~135Â°c has been correlated in previous studies with the extent of lipid peroxidation as measured biochemically  <cit> . the 135Â°c band amplitude was noticeably higher in eosin treated leaf discs taken from pdx <dig> than from the wt. using hplc, we also found that the level of malondialdehyde, a 3-carbon aldehyde produced during lipid peroxidation, was 29% higher in pdx <dig> leaf discs than in wt discs after the eosin treatment . together these results show that eosin treatment results in significantly increased lipid peroxidation in the mutant.

in contrast to 1o <dig>  other ros such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide did not induce different amounts of photooxidation between mutant and wt leaf discs . although exposure of leaf discs to both ros enhanced autoluminescence, this effect was similar in wt and pdx <dig>  similarly, the 135Â°c thermoluminescence band of pdx <dig> and wt leaf discs after h2o <dig> and superoxide treatment were indistinguishable .

vitamin b6-deficient plants are more sensitive to 1o2-mediated lipid peroxidation than wt leaves
1o <dig> was recently shown to be the major ros involved in photooxidative damage to leaves  <cit> . a combination of low temperature and high light is known to be particularly favorable for inducing photooxidative stress in higher-plant leaves  <cit> . therefore, we exposed leaf discs to a high photon flux density  of  <dig> Î¼mol photons m- <dig> s- <dig> at low temperature . this treatment induced lipid peroxidation, as measured by autoluminescence  and thermoluminescence . leaf discs from the pdx <dig> mutant were clearly more sensitive to the high light treatment than wt discs: both signals were enhanced in the mutant compared to wt. when leaf discs taken from the pdx <dig> mutant were infiltrated with vitamin b <dig> before the light treatment, the increased thermoluminescence relative to wt was lost, confirming that exogenous vitamin b <dig> can function as an antioxidant  <cit> .

the high photosensitivity of vitamin b6-deficient leaf discs prompted us to investigate the responses of whole plants to photooxidative stress conditions. figure  <dig> shows the effect of 2-d exposure of arabidopsis plants to photooxidative stress induced by very high light  at low temperature  on lipid peroxidation. again, autoluminescence emission was much higher in pdx <dig> than in wt after this treatment . this was particularly visible in the external leaves, in agreement with previous studies that have emphasized the higher sensitivity of mature leaves to oxidative stress relative to young, developing leaves . this observation indicates that the increased sensitivity of pdx <dig> to photooxidative stress is not directly attributable to the low-chl phenotype of pdx <dig> which was visible mainly in the young leaves.

the differential sensitivity of the pdx <dig> mutant and wt to light stress was confirmed by thermoluminescence measurements  and also by hplc analyses of lipid hydroperoxide concentrations . the level of hote , the product of the oxidation of linolenic acid  doubled in wt plants after light stress. in pdx <dig> the hote concentration increased by a factor of  <dig>  figure 6d shows the relative proportions of the different hote isomers during lipid peroxidation induced by high light stress. isomers specific to 1o <dig>  were present in high amounts, and their level relative to the isomers 9-hote and 16-hote, which are produced by all ros  was typical of 1o <dig> attack on polyunsatured fatty acids . thus, one can conclude that pdx <dig> plants are more sensitive to endogenous 1o <dig> production than wt plants.

1o <dig> levels during illumination are enhanced in the pdx <dig> mutant
singlet oxygen sensor green  reagent is a fluorescein derivative compound that is selective to 1o <dig> with no appreciable response to superoxide and hydroxyl radical  <cit> . in the presence of 1o <dig>  it emits a green fluorescence that peaks at  <dig> nm. however, this fluorescent probe has a relatively low stability in the light, so that the use of this probe to measure 1o <dig> production should be restricted to short illumination only. figure 7a shows the fluorescence spectrum of arabidopsis leaves infiltrated under pressure with sosg and illuminated for  <dig> min at a pfd of  <dig> Î¼mol photons m- <dig> s- <dig>  sosg fluorescence at  <dig> nm was well visible in the fluorescence emission spectrum of the illuminated leaves. this fluorescence was enhanced in pdx <dig> relative to wt, indicating an increased level of 1o <dig> in the former plants. figure 7b shows the fluorescence emission at  <dig> nm  normalized to the fluorescence of chlorophylls at  <dig> nm  in leaves infiltrated with sosg, with vitamin b <dig> or with both. the only condition that caused a significant increase in the f525/f <dig> ratio, indicative of an increased production of 1o <dig>  was the illumination of sosg-infiltrated leaves of the pdx <dig> mutant. interestingly, the photoinduced increase in the f525/f <dig> ratio of pdx <dig> leaves was lost when leaves were infiltrated with vitamin b <dig> in addition to sosg. this loss of sosg fluorescence indicates that exogenous vitamin b <dig> can quench 1o <dig> in vivo, thus confirming in vitro data  <cit> .

the pdx <dig> mutation enhances the photosensitivity of the vte <dig> npq <dig> mutant
the vte <dig> npq <dig> double mutant is deficient in two major 1o <dig> quenchers, vitamin e  and the carotenoid zeaxanthin  <cit> . vte <dig> npq <dig> is photosensitive, exhibiting oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in high light  <cit> . this is illustrated in fig.  <dig> where vte <dig> npq <dig> plants were exposed to a rather moderate light stress . this treatment brought about leaf bleaching  and increased autoluminescence . on the contrary, both wt and pdx <dig> plants appeared to be resistant to this treatment. similarly, the single mutants vte <dig> and npq <dig> did not display symptoms of photooxidative damage under these conditions . the vte <dig> npq <dig> mutant was crossed with the pdx <dig> single mutant to generate a triple mutant  deficient in vitamins e and b <dig> and in zeaxanthin. the triple mutant exhibited an extreme sensitivity to high light: most leaves bleached  and leaf autoluminescence increased markedly . we also measured the hote concentration in leaves , which was higher in the triple mutant than in the double or single mutants. thus, removing vitamin b <dig> in the vte <dig> npq <dig> background led to a highly photosensitive phenotype. analysis of the lipid peroxidation signature indicated that lipid peroxidation in the triple mutant was mediated by 1o <dig> . the high photosensitivity of leaves of the vte <dig> npq <dig> pdx <dig> triple mutant compared to leaves of the vte <dig> npq <dig> and pdx <dig> mutants suggests that there is some overlap in the functions of vitamin b <dig> and the zeaxanthin-vitamin e duo.

protective mechanisms against 1o <dig> in leaves of the pdx <dig> mutant
psii antenna size is decreased in leaves of the pdx <dig> mutant
the decreased chl levels and increased chl a/b ratio of pxd <dig> mutants  suggest that there is a differential adjustment of the photosynthetic complexes to the light environment in mutant compared to wt plants. therefore, we analyzed the relative abundance of chl-containing photosynthetic complexes in thylakoids prepared from wt and pdx <dig>  the pigmented protein complexes of thylakoids were solubilized in  <dig> % Î±-dodecylmaltoside and were separated by ultracentrifugation on sucrose gradient . as expected, acclimation of wt leaves to high light  brought about a substantial decrease in the psii antenna system  relative to the psii reaction center . the psi-lhci supercomplex  was also reduced during photoacclimation. rather surprisingly the profile of thylakoids isolated from young leaves of low light-grown pdx <dig> plants was very similar to the profile of high light-grown wt plants. high light-grown pdx <dig> leaves showed a rather extreme situation: the psii antennae were strongly reduced compared to the psii core and the abundance of psi-lhci supercomplexes was extremely low. long-term acclimation of pdx <dig> to high light was also associated with an increased level of free carotenoids . thus, the enhancement of the carotenoid/chl ratio in leaves of the pdx <dig> mutant seems to be largely due to unbound carotenoids. however, the quality of the separation of the photosynthetic complexes of thylakoids prepared from high light-acclimated leaves of pdx <dig> was poor in  <dig> % Î±-dodecylmaltoside, presumably because of a high lipid/protein ratio. consequently, a higher Î±-dodecylmaltoside concentration  was used to improve solubilization of thylakoids prepared from pdx <dig> leaves after acclimation to high light . by comparison with low light-grown pdx <dig> plants, the profile obtained with high-light treated pdx <dig> at this detergent concentration confirmed that the effects of high light were drastic in the mutant, with a strong decrease in psi-lhci and psii antenna size and an increase in the level of free pigments .

a global reduction of the psii antenna system  could explain the increase in the chl a/b ratio in the pdx <dig> mutant. however, the absorption spectra of the b <dig> and b <dig> bands showed that the light-harvesting complexes of psii themselves contain less chl b , suggesting that the composition of these bands was modified. this prompted us to analyze the protein composition of the different bands by sds-page. two different buffer systems were used: tricine  and laemmli-urea . the former system allows a good separation of the lhcb polypeptides whereas the latter system is more appropriate for separating the lhca proteins. in wt, acclimation to high light resulted in the decreased relative abundance of several psii antennae  and the increased relative abundance of cp <dig>  with respect to control conditions. the abundance of cp <dig>  was little affected . low-light grown pdx <dig> plants showed similar changes in the relative abundances of lhcb1- <dig>  cp <dig> and cp <dig> indicating that even under low light this mutant suffers light stress comparable to that of the wt at a pfd of  <dig> Î¼mol m- <dig> s- <dig>  these changes were strongly amplified when pdx <dig> was exposed to high light. since cp <dig> and cp <dig> have a higher chl a/b ratio than other lhcb antennae  <cit> , the relative enhancement of these antennae might help contribute to the increased chl a/b ratio in pdx <dig>  the chl a/b ratio of band b <dig> was particularly high  in pdx <dig> plants grown under high light. band b <dig> consists of a mixture of different monomeric antennae that usually have chl a/b ratios between  <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> . therefore the high chl a/b ratio of the b <dig> band pdx <dig> plants cannot simply be explained by a decrease in the abundance of the chl b-rich monomers. instead there must be an increased chl a/b ratio within the lhcb complex itself. this could be explained by either a reduced chl b availability as a result of stress that results in chl a-rich folding of the lhc complexes, or else by the preferential accumulation of specific lhcb isoforms that are rich in chl a, as previously suggested for maize  <cit> . we also observed a higher abundance of atpase relative to antenna proteins under high light . however a precise quantification is not possible from these gels since atpase fragments into several subcomplexes during gradient centrifugation, with the most intact complex migrating in b <dig> together with psi. however, we were able to further confirm the higher abundance of atpase relative to chl-binding complexes by sds-page separation of total thylakoid proteins .

changes in the relative proportions of the lhca proteins in response to high light and/or in pdx <dig> were much less pronounced than those occurring in the psii antenna system . nevertheless, a relative increase in psad and possibly lhca <dig> abundance seemed to occur in pdx <dig> plants that had been acclimatised to high light .

together, the data of figs.  <dig> and  <dig> suggest that vitamin b6-deficient leaves sensed a higher level of light stress at a given pfd and over-reacted to increasing pfd compared to wt leaves. incidentally, the smaller antenna system of pdx <dig> was not associated with substantial changes in photosynthetic electron transport efficiency . this is consistent with previous studies of psii antenna mutants of arabidopsis which have shown that rather strong reductions of the antenna system do not necessarily affect the photochemical activity of leaves .

vitamin b <dig> accumulation during high light acclimation
the expression of the pdx <dig> and pdx <dig> genes is up-regulated by several stress conditions, including high light  <cit> . however, so far the vitamin b <dig> concentration in plant tissues has not been measured under those conditions. using hplc, we were able to measure the non-phosphorylated forms of vitamin b <dig>  figure  <dig> shows the effect of high light  on the concentration of nonphosphorylated vitamin b <dig> components of arabidopsis leaves. pyridoxine and pyridoxamine were the major vitamin b <dig> constituents measured in leaves, with pyridoxal being present in low amounts only. pyridoxine and pyridoxal noticeably increased in high light while pyridoxamine did not change, so that the total  vitamin b <dig> level increased by about 70%.

discussion
vitamin b <dig> deficiency leads to 1o2-mediated photodamage
vitamin b6-deficient arabidopsis leaves were more sensitive to treatments with the 1o <dig> generator eosin than wt leaves, and exogenous application of vitamin b <dig> reduced 1o <dig> level and mitigated lipid peroxidation in leaf discs exposed to high light. the protective role of vitamin b <dig> observed in vitro was confirmed in vivo in arabidopsis plants challenged with endogenous 1o <dig> production induced by high light stress. exposure of arabidopsis plants to high light led to a rise in 1o2concentration and an accumulation of oxidized lipids, which were higher in pdx <dig> than in wt. the increased level of lipid peroxidation in mutant leaves was attributable to a 1o <dig> mediated attack on lipids. those results show that vitamin b <dig> has a function in the protection of plants against 1o <dig> toxicity and photooxidative stress. this confirms in vivo the antioxidant capacity of vitamin b <dig> previously inferred from in vitro studies  <cit> . the role of vitamin b <dig> in the response of plants to light stress was further supported by our observation that the concentration of this vitamin is increased in arabidopsis leaves exposed to high light intensity. this finding is in line with previous studies that have shown an increased expression of genes of the vitamin b <dig> biosynthesis pathway  by abiotic stresses  <cit> . illumination of pdx <dig> seedlings grown under sterile conditions has been reported to provoke degradation of the d <dig> protein of the psii reaction center and to exacerbate the associated photoinhibition of psii  <cit> . the latter phenomenon is attributed to 1o <dig> attack on the d <dig> protein itself, triggering structural changes in the psii centre that initiate proteolytic degradation of the protein  <cit> . these data add further support to our conclusions that reduced levels of vitamin b <dig> in pdx <dig> leads to enhanced accumulation of 1o <dig> 

direct versus indirect effect of vitamin b <dig> in photoprotection
the photoprotective role of vitamin b <dig> could be direct or indirect. a direct role would mean that vitamin b <dig> quenches 1o <dig> produced by light in the chloroplasts. this is plausible because this vitamin is able to quench 1o <dig> in vitro with a rather high efficiency  <cit> . the 1o2quenching rate constant of vitamin b <dig> is comparable to that of ascorbate and tocopherol  <cit> . however, because of the high reactivity of 1o <dig>  this supposes that vitamin b <dig> is present in planta in the vicinity of the 1o <dig> production sites, namely the psii reaction center and the chlorophyll antenna system in the chloroplasts  <cit> . vitamin b <dig> levels in arabidopsis leaves are relatively high , in the same range of concentrations as glutathione  <cit> , but its sub-cellular distribution is unknown. to check if chloroplasts constitute a site of vitamin b <dig> accumulation in plant leaves, we prepared intact chloroplasts and we titrated vitamin b <dig> by hplc . because our hplc method requires large amounts of material , it was difficult to prepare sufficient amounts of intact chloroplasts from arabidopsis leaves, and consequently we measured vitamin b <dig> in another plant species, tobacco, that is more suitable for purifying intact chloroplasts by ultracentrifugation on percoll gradient. both pyridoxine and pyridoxamine were detected in intact tobacco chloroplasts . when normalized to the chl content, the  vitamin b <dig> content of chloroplasts  was approximately  <dig> times lower than the concentration in leaves. considering that the chloroplast volume represents about 25% of the total cellular volume  <cit>  and that chl is localized exclusively in the chloroplasts, this suggests that there is a uniform distribution of vitamin b <dig> between the chloroplast and the rest of the cell. however, one cannot exclude that the level of vitamin b <dig> in chloroplasts was underestimated due to vitamin export during the chloroplast isolation. the occurrence of vitamin b <dig> in chloroplasts, as reported here, is consistent with a number of previous observations. first, the n-terminal amino acids of one of the enzymes of the vitamin b <dig> pathway, pyridoxine  5'-phosphate oxidase, have been identified as a chloroplast transit peptide  <cit> , suggesting a chloroplastic localization for this protein. both components of the pyridoxal synthase complex, pdx <dig> and pdx <dig>  have been shown to be attached to membranes, including chloroplastic membranes  <cit> . furthermore, the present study has shown that vitamin b <dig> deficiency impacts the activity of chl synthase, a plastid-localized protein. since vitamin b <dig> is an efficient quencher of 1o <dig> in vitro, it is easy to speculate that the presence of a vitamin b <dig> pool in the chloroplast would reduce 1o <dig> levels. however, under conditions of severe light stress, 1o <dig> has been reported to leave thylakoid membranes and to migrate to the cytoplasm  <cit> . therefore, since the light stress conditions used in this work to induce photooxidative damage were rather drastic , a leakage of 1o <dig> from the chloroplast to the cytosol cannot be excluded and therefore an action of vitamin b <dig> within the cytosol is also possible.

hydroperoxides and endoperoxides generated in lipid peroxidation are known to undergo fragmentation to produce a broad range of reactive intermediates called reactive electrophile species  <cit> . reactive electrophiles are harmful to macromolecules by reacting with nucleophilic groups, resulting in a variety of adducts and irreversible modifications. compared to ros, reactive electrophile species are stable and, due to their non-charged structure, some of them can migrate through hydrophobic membranes and hydrophilic media, so that they are able to propagate oxidative stress far from their site of formation  <cit> . interestingly, pyridoxamine has been shown to trap lipid-derived carbonyl intermediates in vitro  <cit> , and pyridoxamine adducts to lipid peroxidation products have been detected in the urine of pyridoxamine--treated animals  <cit> . in humans, pyridoxamine and pyridoxine are considered to be promising drug candidates for treatment of chronic conditions in which carbonyl compounds confer pathogenecity, such as diabetes  <cit> . a similar function as scavenger of intermediates in lipid peroxidation could be envisaged for vitamin b <dig> in plant cells. however, this mechanism does not explain the selective sensitivity of leaf discs to 1o <dig>  since free radical-induced lipid peroxidation also generates reactive carbonyl species. moreover, we administrated 4-hydroxynonenal, one of the most toxic carbonyl compounds produced from lipid peroxides  <cit> , to detached arabidopsis leaves, using the procedure described by mano et al.  <cit> . as expected, necrosis developed concentrically from the application site of the hydroxynonenal solution on the leaf, but the extent of necrosis was similar in wt leaves and leaves of the pdx <dig> mutant . thus, vitamin b <dig> deficiency does not seem to enhance the sensitivity to reactive carbonyls, and an indirect function of vitamin b <dig> as scavenger of oxidized lipid derivatives seems unlikely.

one can also exclude the possibility that the increased level of 1o <dig> in leaves of the pdx <dig> mutant relative to wt leaves after illumination was due to an increased production of 1o2by the photosystems rather than a decreased quenching activity. in plants, 1o <dig> is produced mainly from chlorophyll triplet states, which are formed when the balance between light absorption by the photosystems and light utilization by the photosynthetic processes is upset in favor of the former process. this can be excluded in leaves of the pdx <dig> mutant since photosynthetic electron transport was not affected significantly relative to wt. moreover, the total chl concentration in pdx <dig> was lowered by ca. 20%, at least in young leaves, and this would be expected to reduce 1o <dig> production  <cit> . 1o <dig> can also be produced by chl precursors such as pchlide, as it is the case in the flu arabidopsis mutant  <cit> . based on our analyses of chl biosynthesis intermediates, we can exclude this phenomenon in pdx <dig>  the fact that exogenously applied 1o <dig> was more toxic to pdx <dig> than to wt is another indication that a change in 1o <dig> production by the photosystems cannot be the sole factor involved in the increased sensibility to 1o <dig> damage in pdx <dig>  in this context, it is important to mention a recent work of lytovchenko et al.  <cit>  who showed that the profile of lipophilic compounds was not substantially affected in shoots of vitamin b6-deficient arabidopsis plants. therefore, we consider that the management of 1o2was less efficient in arabidopsis leaves when vitamin b <dig> concentration was abnormally low.

the most efficient biological quenchers of 1o <dig> are thought to be the carotenoids and the vitamins c and e. neither vitamin c  nor vitamin e  levels were reduced in pdx <dig>  although the total carotenoid content  was lowered, the carotenoid concentration normalized to the chl content was enhanced in pdx <dig>  among carotenoids, the xanthophyll zeaxanthin is known to play a crucial role in photoprotection  <cit> . zeaxanthin synthesis and the associated npq were found to be stimulated in pdx <dig>  and during long-term exposure to high light, the steady-state level of zeaxanthin was higher in pdx <dig> than in wt. thus, the major antioxidant mechanisms involved in 1o <dig> elimination in leaves did not appear to be reduced in pdx <dig>  supporting the notion that the reduced capacity of 1o <dig> quenching was directly related to the low concentration of vitamin b <dig>  rather than to a secondary effect of vitamin b <dig> deficiency on the level of other antioxidant mechanisms. in sterile growth conditions, roots of arabidopsis seedlings deficient in vitamin b <dig> displayed significant changes in lipid constituent content, such as a strong increase in Î±-tocopherol, supporting the idea that oxidative stress is involved in the inhibition of root growth  <cit> .

vitamin b <dig> deficiency induces chronic light stress in leaves
acclimation of wt arabidopsis to high light induced marked changes in the protein composition of thylakoids. as previously reported , the most obvious modification was a decrease in the psii antenna size, leading to a higher chl a/chl b ratio. the abundance of all lhcb proteins, except cp <dig> and to a lesser extent cp <dig>  was decreased in high light. cp <dig> is supposed to constitute with cp <dig> an inner part of the antenna system that undergoes limited modifications with environmental conditions  <cit> . interestingly, the loss of psii antennae was observed in low light when thylakoids prepared from leaves of pdx <dig> were compared with wt thylakoids and was strongly exacerbated when pdx <dig> was exposed to high light . the gradient profile and characteristics of the photosynthetic complexes from low-light-grown pdx <dig> were very similar to that of high-light-acclimated wt thylakoids. consistent with these observations the decreased chl levels in pdx <dig> versus wt was strongly dependent on light intensity: in very low light , wt leaves and mutant leaves had very similar chl a/b ratio and total chlorophyll content whereas the chl a/b value differed drastically in high light. thus, comparison of the photosynthetic complexes between pdx <dig> and wt suggests that, for a given pfd, the mutant senses a higher level of light stress than wt. since the 1o <dig> level induced by light in pdx <dig> was enhanced relative to wt, it is possible that the loss of chl antennae represents a response to 1o <dig> stress in the mutant. although long-term acclimation of vascular plants to 1o2has not yet been investigated, 1o <dig> is known to induce changes in gene expression. particularly, the gene coding for the psii antenna lhcb <dig> has been shown to be strongly and specifically downregulated by 1o <dig> <cit> . in the green alga chlamydomonas, the early phases of 1o2-mediated photooxidative stress were associated with the repression of the lhcbm <dig> and lhcbm <dig> genes at the rna level  <cit> . uv-b radiation, which is know to induce the production of ros including 1o <dig>  has been shown to downregulate expression of several lhcb genes  <cit> . interestingly, these conditions also up-regulated the expression of a pdx <dig> homologue, pyroa  <cit> . alternatively, the loss of psii antennae could also result from the inhibition of chl synthesis in the pdx <dig> mutant. however, previous work on different transgenic plants have shown that a decreased availability of chl induces a decrease in the amount of photosynthetic complexes embedded in the thylakoid membranes, but it does not change the psii antenna size  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the potential function of the vitamin b <dig> constituents as antioxidants has been reported in several in vitro studies in which yeast or animal cells were treated with different ros  <cit> . there are also a few preliminary studies performed in vitro, that support the idea that vitamin b <dig> could fulfill a similar role in plant cells  <cit> . the present study of whole arabidopsis plants provides the first evidences for an active and specific antioxidant role of vitamin b <dig> in planta. vitamin b <dig> deficiency was associated with a marked decrease in the tolerance to photooxidative stress, which manifested itself as an increase in the 1o <dig> level in high light and a marked enhancement in 1o2-mediated lipid peroxidation. on the other hand, it is known that there are some redundancies between the antioxidant systems in chloroplasts, so that removing one antioxidant mechanism is generally compensated, at least partially, by an increase in other protections. this has been established in arabidopsis and cyanobacteria for two classes of 1o <dig> quenchers, the carotenoids and the tocopherols  <cit> . similarly, removal of vitamin b <dig> from an arabidopsis mutant deficient in both carotenoids and tocopherols resulted in an extreme sensitivity to high light stress. these result indicate that vitamin b <dig> may play a specific role in antioxidant defense that is not completey fulfilled by carotenoids or tocopherols. consequently, vitamin b <dig> can be considered as a new member of the network of protective compounds involved in the management of 1o <dig> in plants.
