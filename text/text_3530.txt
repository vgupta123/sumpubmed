BACKGROUND
a variety of distinct chloride channel activities have been described that carry out many essential roles in organismal physiology  <cit> . disruption or disregulation of chloride conductances are central to several well-described disease processes, perhaps most notably, cystic fibrosis  <cit> . although the proteins responsible for some chloride conductances have been described, there are still multiple physiologically important chloride channel activities for which the molecular basis is not yet understood. identification of the proteins responsible for these "orphan" channel activities will be an important step in more fully understanding ion transport physiology in health and disease.

clics are a closely related family of chloride channel proteins  <cit> . in mammals, the family consists of six genes named clics one through six. the clic family is defined by a conserved, approximately  <dig> amino acid core sequence which comprises the c-termini of all known clics. sequences amino-terminal to the core region are divergent both in sequence and in size. the highly conserved clic domain has no homology to other known chloride channel proteins; however it does show low but significant homology to the family of glutathione-s-transferases  <cit> .

evidence that clics are chloride channels comes from a variety of experiments and systems. exogenous expression of clic <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> have all been reported to result in the appearance of novel chloride channel activity using a variety of expression and assay systems  <cit> . conclusive proof that a purified clic can function as a channel was first presented for clic <dig>  expression of clic <dig> in bacteria followed by purification to apparent homogeneity was shown to yield a distinct channel activity when reconstituted in phospholipid membranes, demonstrating unequivocally that clic <dig> alone, without any other subunits or regulatory proteins, functions as an anion-selective channel  <cit> .

clic proteins have biochemical properties which are quite unusual for ion channels. unlike most other ion channels, clic proteins exist in cells both as integral membrane proteins and as soluble, cytoplasmic proteins. in vitro, soluble aqueous clic <dig> has been shown to insert directly into pre-formed phospholipid membranes, with this spontaneous insertion leading to active channels  <cit> .

to date, papers from three independent research groups have reported observations of channel activity associated with purified recombinant clic <dig>  <cit> . while each group finds channels that can be inhibited by iaa- <dig>  there is little consensus regarding single channel properties including single channel conductance, ion selectivity, lipid dependence, and effects of oxidation. in particular, tulk et al.  <cit>  report a single channel conductance of more than twice the magnitude of that reported by others  <cit> . furthermore, estimates of the ratio of chloride to potassium permeabilities ranges from very high  <cit>  through intermediate  <cit>  to very low  <cit> . each group used somewhat different methods, but the basis for these discrepancies in observed fundamental properties of the protein remains unexplained.

although clic <dig> clearly can function as a channel in vitro, the role of clic <dig> in normal physiology remains uncertain and the membrane fraction in which it primarily resides has not been clearly identified. based on a staining pattern in cho cells, it was initially proposed that clic <dig> is a channel of the nuclear membrane  <cit> . our initial studies in cultured human cells revealed a pattern of punctate staining throughout the cytoplasm with little nuclear localization, leading us to propose that clic <dig> could be a channel of intracellular cytoplasmic organelles  <cit> . subsequently, single channels consistent with clic <dig> have been reported on the plasma membrane of cells and the correlation of expression with cell cycle stage has led to the proposal that clic <dig> may be involved in cell cycle regulation  <cit> . one significant problem confounding prior studies of subcellular distribution of clic <dig> is the observation that clics are present in cells both as a membrane-inserted, integral membrane protein, and as a soluble, apparently cytoplasmic protein. in some cell types, the soluble clic <dig> is significantly more abundant than the membrane-associated form. thus, cell staining techniques which do not distinguish between soluble and membrane-associated clic may lead to erroneous conclusions.

an important clue to the role of a protein is its distribution in normal cells and tissues. clic <dig> had previously been shown to be abundant in apical membranes of renal proximal tubule cells  <cit> , in a cytoplasmic distribution in placental trophoblast epithelium  <cit> , and in the acrosomal region of mature spermatozoa  <cit> . in order to address this question further, we have explored the distribution of expression of endogenous clic <dig> in a variety of mouse tissues using immunohistochemical techniques. in this paper, we show that clic <dig> is expressed in the apical domain of a variety of simple columnar epithelia as well as in a non-polarized distribution in the basal cell layer of some stratified squamous epithelia, and is present diffusely throughout skeletal muscle fibers. we further investigated subcellular localization of clic <dig> in three distinct cell lines using dual-label confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. to distinguish between membrane associated and cytoplasmic clic <dig>  we used digitonin extraction prior to fixation to selectively solubilize cytoplasmic proteins  <cit> . in panc <dig> cells, a relatively undifferentiated non-polarized cell line which expresses abundant clic <dig>  we find that the characteristic intracellular punctate staining pattern previously reported is due to digitonin-extractable, presumably cytoplasmic, clic <dig>  while the majority of the digitonin-resistant clic <dig> colocalizes with plasma membrane markers. in t <dig> cells, a highly polarized colonic epithelial cell line, clic <dig> expression is polarized to the apical domain of the cell, reproducing the polarized expression observed in normal tissues. the extent of apical polarization is enhanced in response to stimulation of the cells with forskolin, which activates transepithelial chloride transport in these cells via a cftr-mediated mechanism  <cit> . unlike in panc <dig> cells, the pattern of distribution in t <dig> cells is not significantly altered by extraction with digitonin. double label experiments indicate that the mass of the digitonin-resistant clic <dig> does not precisely colocalize with the apical plasma membrane but is immediately below it. in mptc, an immortalized mouse kidney proximal tubule cell line, the distribution of clic <dig> intersects with that of both megalin and napi <dig>  markers of the apical membrane endocytic/recycling compartment  <cit> .

we conclude that clic <dig> is widely expressed in a specific set of epithelial and non-epithelial cell types where it shows tissue- and cell-specific patterns of subcellular localization. the data suggest clic <dig> may play different roles in various cells, one of which may be to contribute to endocytosis and/or recycling of the apical plasma membrane in certain polarized epithelial cells.

RESULTS
characterization of antibodies raised against clic1
the affinity-purified  <dig> antisera, ap <dig>  and the mouse monoclonal antibody, 9f <dig>  were used to probe western blots of bacterial cell lysates expressing glutathione-s-transferase  or gst fusion proteins containing full length human clic <dig>  clic <dig>  and clic5a . a fusion protein of the predicted size is the most abundant protein in each lane and is easily seen on a coomassie blue stained gel . both ap <dig>  and 9f <dig>  only recognize the clic <dig> fusion protein. in protein preparations from mouse kidney, panc <dig> cells or hela cells, ap <dig> recognizes a single band with apparent molecular weight of  <dig>  . overexpression of human clic <dig> in hela cells using a vaccinia-driven expression system leads to this band becoming more prominent without the appearance of any other band . similarly, the monoclonal antibody 9f <dig> recognizes a single protein with apparent molecular weight of  <dig>  in panc <dig>  t <dig>  and mouse kidney proteins . of note, both clic <dig>  and clic5b  are expected to be present in mouse kidney and are not recognized by the antibody while clic <dig> is robustly detected. finally, ap <dig> and 9f <dig> give identical patterns when used to stain panc <dig> cells either without or with digitonin extraction . thus, we conclude that both ap <dig> and monoclonal 9f <dig> are specific for clic <dig> 

immunolocalization of clic- <dig> in mouse tissues
mouse esophagus, forestomach, glandular stomach, small intestine, colon, submandibular gland, lung, liver, gall bladder, spleen, pancreas, heart, skeletal muscle, skin, adrenal, testis, and epididymis were each stained with ap <dig>  representative images from tissues in which staining was observed are shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  in each figure, the left column presents a low power view of a section stained with the control antibody and the middle column presents a comparable image from a section stained with ap <dig>  the right column is a high power view of the same tissue. the horseradish peroxidase reaction product indicating antibody binding is brown while the hematoxalyin counterstain, primarily labeling nuclei, is blue.

the esophagus and forestomach of the mouse are lined by a stratified squamous epithelium surrounded by smooth muscle. images of esophageal sections are shown in figure 2a–c. low power views of sections stained with control antibody  or with ap <dig>  show intense clic <dig> staining of the basal epithelial layer. in addition, there is background reaction product associated with the most superficial layer of squamous epithelial cells which is no different between control and clic1-stained section. a higher power view is presented in figure 2c, showing the intensely stained basal layer separating the underlying smooth muscle in the upper left from the stratified squamous epithelial layers on the lower right. the pattern of forestomach staining was identical .

glandular stomach is lined with a simple columnar epithelium. the surface epithelium is composed of a uniform layer of mucous-secreting cells while the underlying glands consist of a mixture of enzyme-secreting chief cells, acid-secreting parietal cells, mucin-secreting goblet cells, and gastrin-secreting g cells. staining of glandular stomach is shown in figures 2d–g. low power images  show clear staining of both surface and glandular epithelial cells above background without appreciable staining of underlying connective tissue or muscle. a higher power view of surface epithelium  shows homogeneous staining of all the cells of the epithelium with marked apical polarization. a higher power view of glands  reveals a quite different staining pattern with homogeneous staining throughout the cytoplasm of a subset of the gland cells.

images of small intestine  and colon  show selective staining of the simple columnar epithelium with marked apical polarization and without appreciable staining of underlying connective tissue, muscle, or, in the colon, subepithelial glands.

staining of liver is shown in figures 2n–p. low power images in 2n-o show a central vein at the top with a intrahepatic bile duct immediately below it, surrounded by hepatocytes. the hepatocytes show no detectable staining, but there is clear staining of intrahepatic bile ducts. 2p is a higher power image of the bile duct shown in 2o. the staining is concentrated in the apical pole of the bile duct epithelial cells. the gall bladder epithelium, like the intrahepatic bile ducts, stained for clic <dig> in an apical distribution .

the pancreas showed intense staining of the branches of the pancreatic ducts with no apparent staining of the exocrine acini or other structures . low power images in 3a-b show a vein, artery, and pancreatic duct surrounded by pancreatic acini. a higher power image of the duct  reveals that clic <dig> is most prominent in the apical pole of the ductal epithelium. the islets do not appreciably stain for clic <dig> .

low power images of the lung  show an airway on the left with alveoli on the right. there is intense staining for clic <dig> in the airway epithelium with no appreciable staining of alveoli or vascular structures in the lung. a high power image of the airway epithelium  shows marked apical polarization of clic <dig> staining.

the epididymal epithelium is a transitional epithelium with both basal cells along the basement membrane and columnar epithelial cells lining the lumen. there are structural and functional differences between the head and the tail portions of the organ, and these two portions showed distinct patterns of clic <dig> staining. images from the head of the epididymis  show sperm within the lumen surrounded by the epithelium consisting of tall columnar cells and underlying basal cells. only the basal epithelial cells stain for clic <dig>  a high power image  shows stained basal cells underlying columnar cells to the lower right. as in the upper gi tract, the staining of the basal cells does not appear to be polarized. in the tail  both the basal cells and the columnar epithelial cells stain intensely with the distribution of clic <dig> in the columnar epithelial cells showing a marked apical polarization of distribution. a high power image from the tail of the epididymis  shows staining of both basal cells to the right, and the apical domain of columnar cells which lies immediately below the luminal sperm on the left.

skeletal muscle showed clear staining for clic <dig> above control . the signal is diffusely distributed throughout the skeletal muscle cells without apparent specific localization.

submandibular gland, heart, spleen, skin, adrenal gland, and testis all showed no staining with ap <dig> .

distribution of clic <dig> in panc <dig> cells
panc <dig> cells were grown on cover slips, fixed, permeabilized and stained for clic <dig>  cells fixed directly with plp and stained with the ap <dig> antibody  showed the typical intracellular punctuate staining pattern that we had reported previously using a different clic <dig> antibody  <cit> . there is negative staining of the nucleus in most cells, indicating that staining of the cytoplasm is more intense than staining of the nucleus. to characterize the staining patterns further, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained simultaneously with both the polyclonal rabbit ap <dig> and the monoclonal mouse 9f <dig> . the two antibodies give essential identical staining patterns with nearly perfect colocalization. double staining for clic <dig> with ap <dig> and with monoclonal antibodies specific for markers of the endoplasmic reticulum , the golgi apparatus , lysosomes , and trans-golgi network  all failed to show any significant colocalization .

the staining pattern of clic <dig> must result from superimposed distribution of the soluble and membrane-inserted fractions of the protein. we were concerned that the distribution of the abundant cytoplasmic clic <dig> might be obscuring the distribution of the less abundant membrane-inserted form of the protein. the non-ionic detergent, digitonin, has been reported to solubilize selectively cytoplasmic proteins while leaving membrane-inserted proteins in place  <cit> . to determine whether we could use digitonin to remove selectively non-membrane-associated clic <dig> from cells, panc <dig> cells were grown on plastic culture dishes and extracted with  <dig> %  digitonin at room temperature for two minutes. soluble and membrane fractions were then prepared from the cells by centrifugation. two micrograms of soluble protein or  <dig>  μg of membrane protein were blotted and probed for clic <dig> . clearly, digitonin extraction removes the soluble clic <dig> from these cells without significantly removing the membrane-associated clic <dig> 

since digitonin selectively removes soluble clic <dig> from cultured cells, digitonin extraction prior to fixation and immunostaining should reveal the true subcellular distribution of membrane-inserted clic <dig>  panc <dig> cells on coverslips were subjected to a two minute extraction with  <dig> %  digitonin prior to fixation with plp and staining for clic <dig> . the resulting staining pattern is weaker than with non-digitonin extracted cells, requiring more sensitive detection settings to obtain an image. however, the staining pattern is markedly greater than and different from matched preparations stained with control antibody . after digitonin extraction, the prominent intracellular punctate staining pattern has disappeared, leaving a fainter wispy peripheral localization of the residual staining, plus some staining of a circular structure suggestive of the nucleus. digitonin-extracted cells were also double stained with both anti-clic <dig> antibodies . both the polyclonal rabbit and monoclonal mouse antibodies give essentially identical staining patterns with loss of the intracellular punctuate pattern leaving peripheral staining at the edge of the cells.

double staining for clic <dig> with ap <dig> and with monoclonal antibodies specific for markers of the plasma membrane or the nuclear membrane of panc <dig> cells that had been extracted with  <dig> %  digitonin are shown in figure  <dig>  the peripheral stain clearly colocalizes with the plasma membrane markers integrin α <dig>  and annexin ii , with the intensity and extent of plasma membrane clic <dig> staining varying significantly from cell to cell and between different regions within individual cells. the nuclear envelope marker, nucleoporin p <dig> , confirms that there is residual staining of clic <dig> within the nucleus following digitonin extraction and this staining is distinct from the nuclear envelope itself.

the behavior of cytoskeletal proteins during digitonin extraction has not been well described, but one might expect cytoskeleton to be left largely intact by a mild detergent like digitonin. thus digitonin-resistant clic <dig> could conceivably represent cytoskeletal rather than membrane distribution. in contrast to digitonin, triton x- <dig> has been reported to solubilize both cytoplasmic and membrane protein while leaving the cytoskeleton intact  <cit> . to distinguish whether the digitonin-resistant clic <dig> represents membrane or cytoskeletal association, we compared the distribution of clic <dig> in cells which had been extracted with digitonin with that in cells which had been extracted with triton x- <dig>  panc <dig> cells were grown on coverslips and subjected to a two minute extraction with  <dig> %  digitonin or a five minute extraction with  <dig> %  triton x- <dig>  the cells were then fixed and processed as usual and stained with the ap <dig> antibody for clic <dig> and with a monoclonal pan-anti-cytokeratin antibody to label the intermediate-filament cytoskeleton. results are shown in figure  <dig>  clearly both the digitonin and triton x- <dig> extractions leave the cytoskeleton intact while the triton x- <dig> extraction completely eliminates the peripheral plasma membrane clic <dig> staining seen in the digitonin extracted cells. we conclude that the peripheral clic <dig> staining represents clic <dig> in the plasma membrane and not associated with the cytoskeleton. of note, some of the punctuate intranuclear staining is triton x- <dig> resistant, suggesting it may be associated with nuclear skeletal elements.

distribution of clic <dig> in t <dig> cells
we also examined the distribution of clic <dig> in t <dig> cells, a well-differentiated human colon cancer cell line. on permeable supports, t <dig> cells form a columnar epithelium which demonstrates cftr-dependent, camp-activated chloride secretion . a t <dig> monolayer was stained with ap <dig>  confocal images from several focal planes are shown in figure  <dig> as well as a vertical section created from a narrow slice through the stack of horizontal images. clic <dig> stains punctate structures which are most abundant in the apical pole of the cell. as with the panc <dig> cells, the clic <dig> in t <dig> cells failed to colocalize with markers of endoplasmic reticulum, golgi, lysosomes, or trans-golgi network .

to determine whether activation of chloride transport alters the distribution of clic <dig>  cell monolayers were fixed and imaged either in a control state or after stimulation with forskolin to increase intracellular camp. reconstructed vertical sections through representative regions are shown in figure  <dig>  the apical polarization of clic <dig> distribution is clearly enhanced following forskolin treatment.

as with the panc <dig> cells, we wished to distinguish the distribution of membrane-inserted clic <dig> from the soluble cytoplasmic fraction of the protein. to determine whether digitonin extraction would remove soluble clic <dig> from t <dig> cells, t <dig> monolayers were extracted with  <dig> %  digitonin, fractionated into soluble and membrane fractions, and probed for clic <dig> as described above. as shown in figure 5b, digitonin extraction greatly reduced the soluble clic <dig> without appreciably changing membrane-associated clic <dig>  the removal of soluble clic <dig> was not as complete with t <dig> cells as with panc <dig>  but a large majority of the soluble clic <dig> was clearly removed.

we then compared the staining pattern of clic <dig> in t <dig> cells with or without extraction with  <dig> %  digitonin. to mark the apical plasma membrane, the cells were labeled with fitc-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin  prior to permeabilization and staining for clic <dig>  a stack of images at  <dig>  μm steps were taken through each cell monolayer. results are shown in figure  <dig>  two images from a representative field are shown from both the control  and digitonin-extracted  cultures. the upper image of each pair is an en face view of the clic <dig> distribution in the focal plane with the most intense clic <dig> staining , which for both samples was near the apical surface of the cell monolayer. the lower image of each pair is a z-section generated from the stack of images, showing the distribution of both clic <dig>  and the apical membrane marker fitc-wga . following digitonin extraction, overall staining intensity for clic <dig> was lower, but the distribution did not appear remarkably different from that of unextracted cells. clic <dig> was still present in punctate structures that were more abundant in the apical pole of the cell. digitonin extraction did appear to decrease the diffuse faint staining between the more intensely stained discreet structures. although there was clearly some colocalization, the level of the most intense staining for clic <dig> either with or without digitonin extraction was slightly below the most intense staining level for wga, suggesting that the bulk of the digitonin-insoluble clic <dig> is not in the plasma membrane itself, but congregated immediately below it.

we examined the distribution of digitonin-insoluble clic <dig> in response to forskolin. confluent t <dig> cell monolayers were exposed to hepes-buffered saline , or hbs with  <dig> μm forskolin for  <dig> minutes at 37°c, then chilled and their apical surface labeled with fitc-wga. the cells were then subjected to extraction with  <dig> %  digitonin followed by fixation, permeabilization and staining for clic <dig>  stacks of confocal images covering square  <dig> ×  <dig> μm fields were collected at  <dig>  μm vertical intervals. fluorescence intensity in each channel was summed from each focal plane. the peak of intensity of the fitc-wga staining was taken as the apical surface of the cell and the stacks of images were aligned to this reference point. intensities were averaged from aligned stacks of images collected from  <dig> separate fields from each cell monolayer. the fluorescence intensities were normalized to the maximum and minimum recorded intensity in each channel and were plotted as a function of distance in the vertical dimension as shown in figure  <dig>  in both control and forskolin-treated cells, the wga distribution is sharp, indicating the apical membrane lies within a narrow band in these image stacks. in the control cell layer, the peak of the clic <dig> staining lies  <dig>  μm below the peak of wga staining and the distribution of clic <dig> appears rather broad. following forskolin treatment, the peak clic <dig> staining lies  <dig>  μm below the peak wga stain and the distribution of the clic <dig> is narrower.

these results indicate that clic <dig> in t <dig> cells resides in a membrane compartment lying immediately below the apical plasma membrane and that forskolin causes the distribution of membrane-inserted clic <dig> to become more apically polarized. however, even after forskolin, the bulk of the clic <dig> is not in the plasma membrane itself but is immediately below it.

distribution of clic <dig> in immortalized mouse proximal tubule cells
the distribution of clic <dig> in t <dig> cells suggests it is present in subapical intracellular vesicles. we have been unable to identify this compartment further in t <dig> cells, but it is clear that many polarized epithelial cells have abundant subapical vesicles which are involved in endocytosis and recycling. to investigate whether clic <dig> may be in this compartment, we studied a mouse kidney proximal tubule cell line, mptc  <cit> . kidney proximal tubule cells are well suited for this purpose since several well characterized proteins are known to transit through the endocytic/recycling compartment in these cells. megalin, a multi-specific scavenging receptor for many components of the glomerular filtrate  <cit> , and napi-ii  <cit> , the sodium-phosphate co-transporter, are two proteins which are known undergo endocytosis and, in the case of megalin, recycling to the plasma membrane in kidney proximal tubule cells. we grew mptc cells on permeable supports under conditions to maximize differentiation. as in proximal tubule cells in intact kidney, these cells express abundant clic <dig> which shows a strongly apically polarized distribution . cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with rabbit polyclonal antisera to megalin or napi-ii and costained with the 9f <dig> monoclonal antibody to clic <dig>  confocal images were collected from regions below the apical pole of the cells and are shown in figure  <dig>  clearly many of the punctuate structures that stain for megalin or napi-ii also stain for clic <dig>  however, there certainly are structures that stain for either megalin or napi-ii but not for clic <dig>  and structures that stain for clic <dig> but not for megalin or napi-ii. thus we conclude the clic <dig> compartment overlaps with the endocytic/recycling compartment, but is not identical to it.

discussion
in this paper, we have described the distribution of clic <dig> in normal adult mouse tissues and characterized the subcellular distribution of the protein in three distinctly different cell lines. our data sheds new light on possible roles for clic <dig> in different tissues and cell types.

prior northern blot data indicated that clic <dig> is widely expressed throughout the body, with particularly strong signals in muscle, liver, and kidney. however, northern blot data only reflect the presence of mrna and do not necessarily perfectly correlate with the steady state level of encoded protein. furthermore, northern blots using rna isolated from whole organs are necessarily silent regarding heterogeneity of expression among the cells of a given organ or subcellular location within individual cells. thus, the data presented here represents a significant new contribution to knowledge of clic <dig> expression patterns.

we found clic <dig> expressed in three distinct patterns. first, in several simple columnar epithelia, clic <dig> is expressed in an apically polarized pattern. tissues showing this pattern include the epithelia of airways, intrahepatic biliary ducts, gall bladder, pancreatic duct, surface epithelia of the glandular stomach, small intestine and colon, in addition to the previously described renal proximal tubule  <cit> . a second pattern of staining is demonstrated by non-keratinizing stratified epithelia of the esophagus, and forestomach. in these tissues, the basal layer of cells express clic <dig> abundantly without clear subcellular specificity, although the prominence of staining of the periphery of the cells suggest clic <dig> may be present in plasma membrane. the epididymis, which is comprised of both columnar epithelial cells and basal cells, shows both patterns of staining. the basal cells stain throughout the organ, while only the tail of the epididymis exhibits staining of columnar cells. the third pattern of expression is found in the muscle cells of skeletal muscle. here, clic <dig> is present throughout the cytoplasm.

numerous tissues and cell types failed to stain for clic <dig>  these cells may indeed express no clic <dig> at all, or they may express it at levels below the detection threshold of our staining method. these tissues include acinar secretory epithelia such as pancreatic acinar cells, subepithelial glands of lung and colon, and the submandibular salivary gland. endocrine cells of the adrenal and the pancreatic islets failed to stain. connective tissues surrounding each of the organs studied were consistently negative. skin, spleen, smooth muscle of the gut, and the heart were all without significant staining for clic <dig> 

these observations defy simple generalizations about clic <dig> expression. for example, the abundant expression in the rapidly dividing basal layer of the upper gastointestinal tract would be consistent with a role in cell cycle as previously proposed  <cit> , but its absence from the equally rapidly dividing basal layer in skin epithelium or in generative nodules in spleen, rule out a generally required role in this process. likewise, clic <dig> is abundant in skeletal muscle, but its absence in smooth and cardiac muscle rules out an absolute requirement for this protein in a muscle-specific function. the existence of other closely related clic family members complicates the analysis. there may indeed be a necessary function played by a clic in these processes, but a family member other than clic <dig> may carry out the role in tissues where clic <dig> is not prominently expressed. a consistent common thread does run through the epithelia which demonstrate apically polarized expression: these are all columnar epithelia which carry out transepithelial transport of salt and water and which have abundant apical membrane trafficking. thus it is possible that clic <dig> may be functioning as a chloride channel in the apical plasma membrane or subapical intracellular vesicles in these cells.

immunohistochemistry can be very useful for identifying cells and tissues expressing a particular antigen, but the limited resolution makes detailed subcellular localization difficult to determine. to define the membrane compartments in which clic <dig> may reside more precisely, we used immuofluorescence studies of three distinct cell lines: panc <dig> cells, a poorly differentiated, non-polarized cell line derived from a human pancreatic cancer; t <dig> cells, a well-differentiated, highly polarized cell line derived from human colon cancer; and mptc cells, an immortalized kidney proximal tubule cell line derived from a mouse transgenic for temperature-sensitive sv <dig> large t antigen. all three of these cell types express clic <dig> abundantly.

in the non-polarized cell line, plp fixation followed by staining for clic <dig> reveals abundant clic <dig> in the cytoplasm in a punctate pattern. however, the bulk of the clic <dig> is soluble and not membrane-associated, as reflected both by differential centrifugation and digitonin extraction. digitonin extraction removes the punctate cytoplasmic staining, indicating that this pattern was due to the abundant soluble clic <dig>  much of the digitonin-resistant clic <dig> colocalizes with plasma membrane markers, indicating that the primary site of membrane-inserted clic <dig> in these cells is the plasma membrane. the observation that the peripheral digitonin-resistant clic <dig> is solubilized by triton x- <dig> supports the interpretation that clic <dig> in this distribution is present as a membrane protein and not as a component of the cytoskeleton. the variability of staining intensity among cells in culture is consistent with the variation with cell cycle of plasma membrane activity attributed to clic <dig> as previously reported  <cit> . some of the digitonin-resistant clic <dig> colocalizes with the nucleus. however, it appears to be within the nucleus, not inserted into the nuclear envelope where one would expect clic <dig> if it were functioning as a nuclear membrane channel. since the low concentration of digitonin used in these studies is not expected to permeabilize the nucleus  <cit> , it remains possible that the residual nuclear clic <dig> observed following digitonin extraction is soluble rather than membrane-associated.

t <dig> cells showed a pattern of clic <dig> distribution quite different from that of panc <dig> cells. these cells express clic <dig> in a distinctly apically polarized distribution, and this polarized expression is exaggerated following exposure to forskolin. in comparison to panc <dig> cells, a larger fraction of clic <dig> is membrane-associated, both by differential centrifugation and by resistance to digitonin extraction. furthermore, digitonin extraction does not dramatically alter the staining pattern of clic <dig> in t <dig> cells. double-labeling experiments using a marker of the apical plasma membrane confirm that the polarized distribution of membrane-inserted clic <dig> is enhanced by treatment with forskolin and that the digitonin-resistent clic <dig> is not in the apical plasma membrane itself, but is concentrated immediately below it. the data indicate that the bulk of membrane inserted clic <dig> in t <dig> cells is in subapical membrane vesicles.

mptc cells also show apically polarized distribution of clic <dig> which mirrors the distribution of clic <dig> in proximal tubule cells in intact kidneys. in these cells, the distribution of clic <dig> intersects with that of both megalin and napi-ii, identifying at least a portion of the clic1-positive vesicles as components of the apical endocytic/recycling compartment. endocytic and recycling vesicles are known to contain a chloride conductance which plays an important role in vesicular acidification which in turn is critical for orderly membrane traffic  <cit> . a different chloride channel, clc <dig>  has been implicated as a chloride channel of endocytic vesicles in proximal tubule  <cit> . whether clic <dig> also plays a role as a chloride channel in this pathway remains to be determined. however, it does at least appear to be physically present in a fraction of the vesicles along this pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
clic <dig> expression exhibits tissue- and cell type-specific patterns, both in the extent of expression and in subcellular distribution. in non-polarized cells such as basal epithelial cells of upper gastrointestinal tract, skeletal muscle, and cultured panc <dig> cells, clic <dig> is expressed in a non-polarized distribution that appears to be throughout the cytoplasm. in the cultured cell model of non-polarized cells, the majority of the clic <dig> is present in a soluble form in the cytoplasm, while the membrane-inserted fraction of clic <dig> is primarily in the plasma membrane. in contrast, in some polarized epithelial cells, the expression of clic <dig> is strongly polarized to the apical domain. using the cultured cells as a model, a larger fraction of the total clic <dig> is membrane-inserted; the membrane-inserted form of the protein is not primarily in the plasma membrane, but in subapical membranes vesicles which do not colocalize with markers of the endoplasmic reticulum, golgi, or trans-golgi network, but which do partially colocalize in with a subset of the apical endocytic/recycling compartment. whether clic <dig> contributes to the chloride conductance and regulation of acidification of vesicles along this pathway remains to be determined.
