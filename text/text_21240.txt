BACKGROUND
traditional methods for studying signal transduction cascades have been based solely on biochemical analysis of whole cell populations and homogenized tissues . in addition, in vitro studies have required the use of radioactive isotopes for biochemical characterization of kinases. these methods are time consuming, produce large quantities of radioactive waste, and do not allow for the study of real-time kinase dynamics.

recently, sensors for studying signal molecules in vitro, as well as cascade dynamics in single cells, have been developed utilizing fluorescent proteins and the phenomenon of fluorescence resonance energy transfer . fret is a phenomenon by which energy is transferred from one fluorescent molecule to another by way of dipole-dipole interactions during excitation of the donor molecule. fret efficiency is given by the equation:



where r is the donor-acceptor radius and ro is the radius at which fret efficiency is 50% . small changes in r  and small orientation changes between the donor and acceptor fluorophores can dramatically affect the efficiency of fret, making very small changes in structure easily detectable. the limitation, however, is that fret is effective only between 10–100Å, and therefore the donor and acceptor must be maintained in close proximity. genetically encoded fluorescent proteins fused by linker peptide sequences have been utilized to address proximity limitations, as well as facilitate the delivery of the sensor into live cells.

some of the earliest work done with these sensors includes genetically encoded sensors of caspase activity, in which caspase- <dig> and caspase- <dig> sensitive linker peptides were fused between the different variants of enhanced green fluorescent protein   <cit> . these studies allowed the characterization of apoptosis in single living cells with spatio-temporal resolution. other types of fret signaling sensors have since evolved, including sensors for calcium signaling  <cit> , receptor tyrosine kinases  <cit> , intracellular kinases  <cit> , and histone methylation  <cit> . these sensors have been shown to be useful in in vitro assays, as well as allow the study of signaling events in a single cell, in real time  <cit> .

the ras/erk cascade controls differentiation and proliferation in many different cell types and organisms. in this signal transduction pathway, activated ras  binds directly to raf- <dig> and recruits it to the membrane where raf becomes activated. raf then phosphorylates and activates mek- <dig> and mek- <dig> , which in turn phosphorylate the mapks erk- <dig> and erk- <dig>  activated erks translocate to the nucleus and directly phosphorylate transcriptional regulatory proteins  . kinetics and in vivo dynamics of erk map kinase activity are not completely understood. traditionally, the level of erk activation has been thought to be relative to the strength of the upstream signal. some data suggest, however, that erk activation is "switch-like," requiring a threshold of activation, above which all erk molecules within the cell become activated  <cit> . computational models of mapk signaling mechanisms can fit both possibilities  <cit> . therefore, the development of new tools to study these dynamics is essential to determine the biochemical nature of erk signaling.

in this manuscript, we describe the development of several fret-based sensors of map kinase activity which we have called erk activity sensors . peptide linker sequences taken from the ets family transcription family members ets <dig> and elk <dig>  both erk targets, were fused between cyan and yellow variants of egfp . several of our constructs respond to phosphorylation by activated erk with changes in fret, and at least one of them, eas- <dig>  is specific for active extracellular regulated kinase  as opposed to two other map kinases, p <dig> and sapk/jnk. therefore, eas- <dig> is a viable, non-radioactive sensor of erk mapk activity in vitro.

RESULTS
design and model of eas
eas was designed to have a short peptide linker sequence sensitive to phosphorylation by erk fused between ecfp and eyfp. ecfp and eyfp were chosen as a fret pair because of the good spectral overlap between the emission of ecfp and the excitation of eyfp. we hypothesized that phosphorylation would result in changes in secondary structure of the linker peptide that would alter fret efficiency for the protein . since it was unclear which factors would contribute to forming a suitable fret sensor, we prepared several different constructs with peptide linker sequences containing erk phosphorylation sites taken from ets <dig> and elk <dig> transcription factors, which are physiological substrates of the erk mapks . eas- <dig>  derived from mouse ets <dig>  has a rather large linker peptide, due to the discovery that the map kinase binding site  is approximately  <dig> amino acids downstream of the target serine  <cit> . the linker sequences for eas 3– <dig> were taken from human elk <dig>  which has been shown to have the def domain , a known mapk binding site, near the c-terminus. these peptides also contain two serine-proline  motifs  corresponding to serines  <dig> and  <dig> of elk <dig>  which have been shown to be targets of map kinases. phosphorylation of these serines has also been shown to be directed specifically by the def domain  <cit> . eas-neg is a negative control construct with a short peptide linker derived from ets <dig>  containing a consensus mapk phosphorylation site, but no mapk binding site.

eas fret changes in the presence of active erk2
we expected a change in energy transfer between ecfp and eyfp upon incubation with active erk <dig>  for eas to be effective as a real time sensor. this would indicate that a phosphorylation event had affected the distance and orientation between the two fluorophores. each eas construct was incubated with perk <dig> in a fluorimeter  and readings were taken prior to addition of atp. upon the addition of atp, all eas constructs, with the exception of eas-neg, showed a decrease of energy transfer indicated by an increase in donor  emission  with a concomitant decrease in acceptor  emission  after  <dig> minutes . therefore, a decrease in fret efficiency correlates with phosphorylation of eas by perk <dig>  the resultant change in ecfp/eyfp emission ratio is comparable to or exceeds that of similar fret-based signal transduction sensors  <cit> . under the same conditions, eas-neg showed no change in fret over the course of  <dig> minutes, confirming the specificity of erk <dig> for eas 2– <dig> and the requirement of a phosphorylation event to induce a change in fret. figure 2b shows the absolute change in ecfp/eyfp ratio over a  <dig> minute time course for each construct. eas- <dig> and eas- <dig> show the greatest absolute decrease in eyfp/ecfp emission ratio, with eas- <dig> having an intermediate change in emission ratio. eas- <dig> showed very little change in fret. phosphorylation was also confirmed by an in vitro kinase 32p phosphorylation assay using recombinant perk <dig> . eas 2– <dig> sensors were efficiently phosphorylated as compared to the non-specific control, eas-neg, and myelin basic protein , a common target of activated mapks for in vitro studies. based on the robust fret signal change and radioassay results, further studies focused on eas- <dig> 

eas changes in fret in response to perk <dig> require phosphorylation and the erk binding site
mutants of eas- <dig> were utilized to validate the structural features of eas essential for decreased fret efficiency upon incubation with perk <dig>  we refined eas- <dig> by replacing the bulky n-terminal gst-purification tag  with a histidine- <dig> tag on the c-terminus. this reduced the possibility that the large purification tag would interfere with fret efficiency changes. in addition, we mutated alanine  <dig> and alanine  <dig> to lysine. as previously reported, this prevents egfp dimerization  <cit> . this latter modification reduced co-purification of truncation products with full-length eas .

to further characterize eas- <dig>  we generated different constructs targeting critical residues, and analyzed their ability to serve as substrates for perk <dig>  mutants eas3-s286a, eas3-s292a, and the double mutant eas3-sa eliminated consensus phosphorylation sites . the dead binding domain mutant  eliminated the def domain by replacing the two key phenylalanines with alanines, creating an axap motif . as figure 3b demonstrates, all five mutants have decreased phosphorylation compared to the wild type sensor. as expected, the eas3-sa mutant had the lowest level of phosphate incorporation due to absence of both serine-proline consensus phosphorylation sites required by map kinases. a decrease in phosphorylation of eas-dbd iss also consistent with the requirement of mapks to bind targets for efficient phosphorylation . differences between wild-type eas- <dig> and mutants are also reflected in change of fret efficiency when treated with perk <dig> in fluorimeter experiments . these relative changes in fret efficiency are consistent with the radioassay data.

eas- <dig> is not phosphorylated by psapk or pp38
distinguishing the activation of different map kinases within the cell is essential since each mapk pathway is activated by multiple mitogens and external environmental factors to varying degrees . furthermore, there is extensive cross-talk between the different map kinase pathways. detection methods must effectively isolate the signal of the target kinase from other family members to elucidate the contributions of these different pathways to a given cellular process.

the target peptide linkers were designed to impart specificity for erk. elk <dig> and ets <dig> were chosen because of their seemingly specific interaction with erk relative to p <dig> or sapk/jnk . to determine whether eas- <dig> acted as a specific substrate for erk we performed in vitro phosphorylation assays to quantify the ability of perk <dig>  pp <dig>  and psapk/jnk to phosphorylate eas- <dig> . as shown in figure 4a, eas- <dig> is an approximately 2000-fold more specific target for perk <dig> than pp <dig>  and 50-fold more specific for perk <dig> than psapk/jnk. activities of perk <dig>  pp <dig> and psapk/jnk were confirmed by using known substrates specific for each kinase . mbp was used in conjuction with perk <dig>  gst-atf <dig> with pp <dig>  and gst-c-jun with psapk/jnk. specificity of these kinases for eas- <dig> was also confirmed by fret in a fluorimeter . it is clear that the change in fret was dramatic when eas- <dig> was incubated with perk <dig>  but showed little or no response when incubated with pp <dig> or psapk/jnk. this is consistent with the results found in 4a. given the similarity of these kinases, this also suggests that eas- <dig> would be specifically acted upon by perk <dig> even in the presence of other activated intracellular kinases.

the demonstrated specificity of perk <dig> for eas- <dig> phosphorylation suggests that this sensor is a candidate for in vivo studies of erk signaling. however, our preliminary experiments in nih-3t <dig> cells indicated that eas- <dig> was susceptible to intracellular phosphatase activity . we surmise that this is due to the absence of a protective phospho-specific binding domain within the eas- <dig> construct. such binding domains have been crucial in the development of other fret-based signaling sensors of kinase activity  <cit> . these binding domains, however, are taken from naturally occurring domains that are specific for each target sequence. unfortunately, no known phospho-specific binding domain exists for elk <dig> in the region of ser383/ <dig>  therefore, we are using a semi-rational approach to develop a phospho-specific binding domain that acts to protect the phosphorylated eas- <dig> linker from intracellular phosphatases. this will enable us to adapt the eas- <dig> sensor for use in live cells.

CONCLUSIONS
these results show that our novel erk activity sensors provide real-time in vitro detection of map kinase activity. this method can be applied to studying kinetics of erk activity in real time, as well as detection of erk activity in unknown cell lysate fractions. there is also the potential to use these sensors for high-throughput screening of erk kinase activity with fluorescence plate readers. this method is more direct and convenient to monitor erk activation in vitro than conventional assays that either use radioactivity for detection or rely on indirect detection using phospho-specific antibodies for mapk targets.
