BACKGROUND
predicting protein inter-residue contacts is an important 2d structure prediction problem  <cit> . contact prediction can help improve analogous fold recognition  <cit>  and ab initio 3d structure prediction  <cit> . several algorithms for reconstructing 3d structure from contacts have been developed in both the structure prediction and determination  literature  <cit> . contact map prediction is also useful for inferring protein folding rates and pathways  <cit> .

due to its importance, contact prediction has received considerable attention over the last decade. for instance, contact prediction methods have been evaluated in the fifth, sixth, and seventh editions of the critical assessment of techniques for protein structure prediction  experiment  <cit> . a number of different methods for predicting contacts have been developed. these methods can be classified roughly into two non-exclusive categories:  statistical correlated mutations approaches  <cit> ; and  machine learning approaches  <cit> . the former uses correlated mutations of residues to predict contacts. the latter uses machine learning methods such as neural networks, self organizing map, hidden markov models, and support vector machines to predict 2d contacts from the primary sequence, as well as other 1d features such as relative solvent accessibility and secondary structure.

in spite of steady progress, contact map prediction remains however a largely unsolved challenge. here we describe a method that uses support vector machines together with a large set of informative features to improve contact map prediction. on the same data set, svmcon outperforms the latest version of the cmappro contact map predictor  <cit>  and is ranked as one of the top predictors in the blind and independent casp <dig> experiment.

RESULTS
we first compare svmcon with the latest version of cmappro on the same benchmark dataset. then we describe the performance of svmcon along with several other predictors during the casp <dig> experiment.

comparison with cmappro on the same benchmark
svmcon is trained to predict medium- to long-range contacts  as in  <cit> , which are not captured by local secondary structure. we train svmcon on the same dataset used to train cmappro  <cit>  and test both programs on the same test dataset. the training dataset contains  <dig> proteins and the test dataset contains  <dig> proteins. the sequence identity between the training and testing datasets is below 25%, a common threshold for ab initio prediction  <cit> .

we use sensitivity and specificity to evaluate the performance of svmcon and cmappro. sensitivity is the percentage of native contacts that are predicted to be contacts. specificity is the percentage of predicted contacts that are present in the native structure. the contact threshold is set at  <dig> Ã… between ca atoms. the sensitivity and specificity of a predictor depend also on the threshold used to separate 'contact' from 'non-contact' predictions. to compare svmcon and cmappro fairly, we choose to evaluate them at their break-even point, where sensitivity is equal to specificity as in  <cit> . at the break-even point, the sensitivity and specificity of svmcon is  <dig> %, 4% higher than cmappro. thus on the same benchmark dataset, svmcon yields a sizable improvement.

we also compare the accuracy of svmcon with the random uniform baseline algorithm consisting of random independent coin flips to decide whether each residue pair is in contact or not. since the medium-and long-range contacts account for  <dig> % of the total number of residue pairs with linear separation >=  <dig>  the probability for the coin to produce a contact is set to  <dig> %. as a result, the sensitivity and specificity of the random baseline algorithm is  <dig> % at the break-even point. thus svmcon yields a nine-fold improvement over the random baseline.

since the contact prediction accuracy varies significantly with individual proteins and their structure classes  <cit> , we calculate the contact prediction specificity  and sensitivity  for each test protein . for each one, we select up to l  predicted contacts ranked by svm scores because the total number of true contacts is approximately linear to the protein length  <cit> . the results show that in many cases , the prediction accuracy and coverage are > 30%.

however, for some proteins such as 1sknp, the prediction accuracy is pretty low. we observe that the contact prediction accuracy is related to the the quality of multiple sequence alignment, the prediction accuracy of secondary structure, and the proportion of beta-sheets. consistent with previous research  <cit> , the contacts within beta-sheets in beta, alpha+beta, and alpha/beta proteins are predicted with higher accuracy than the contacts between an alpha helix and a beta strand or between alpha helices. we think that the strong restraints between beta-strands such as hydrogen-bonding probably contribute to the improved accuracy.

column  <dig> lists the protein name . the chain id of a single-chain protein is denoted by "a" instead of "-". column  <dig> lists chain lengths, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  column  <dig> lists the scop structure class, alpha, beta, a+b, a/b, small, and coil-coil represent six scop protein classess , respectively. columns  <dig> and  <dig> report the prediction accuracy  and coverage  for each protein. accuracy is the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions. coverage is the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of true contacts. the raw number of correct preditions, all predictions, and true contacts are also reported in the brackets.

figures  <dig> and  <dig> show the native 3d structure and the predicted contact map of a good example , respectively. in this case, 2l  predicted contacts with sequence separation >=  <dig> are selected. the contact prediction accuracy and coverage are  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. it is shown that the predicted contact clusters  recall most native beta-sheet pairing patterns of the protein . and it is interesting to see most false positive contacts are also clustered around the true contacts. thus, these noise may not be very harmful during the process of reconstructing protein structure from the contacts.

furthermore, to investigate the relationship between the svm contact map predictions and the structure classes, we compute the average accuracy and coverage of contact predictions in the six scop  <cit>  structure classes . the contact prediction accuracy of proteins having beta-sheets  is higher than that of alpha helical proteins, which is consistent with previous observations  <cit> . according to table  <dig>  the average coverage is about 20% and the accuracy ranges from  <dig> to 37%. this level of accuracy is probably good enough  for constructing an ab initio low-resolution structure, since previous experiments show that only l/ <dig> or even less residues contacts are required to reconstruct a low resolution structure for a small protein  <cit> , taking into account the inherent physical restraints of protein structures. however, the challenge is to develop algorithms to reconstruct a protein structure from a noisy predicted contact map, where contact restraints are much less reliable than the experimental contacts determined by nmr techniques.

column  <dig> lists six structure classes. column  <dig> lists the number of proteins in each class. other columns reports the accuracy and coverage of contact predictions in each category. the statistics is computed for sequence separation >=  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. the last row reports the average performance on all  <dig> proteins. the accuracy of a+b and a/b is slightly higher than that of beta proteins, which is in turn higher than that of alpha proteins. the performance on small proteins  lies between proteins containing beta-sheets  and alpha helical proteins. there is only one coil-coil protein, which does not have native contacts with sequence separation >=  <dig> 

comparison with seven other predictors during casp7
svmcon participated in the casp <dig> experiment in  <dig> and was evaluated along with seven other contact map predictors. the casp <dig> evaluation procedure focuses on inter-residue contact predictions with linear sequence separation >=  <dig> and >=  <dig> respectively  <cit> . up to l/ <dig> of the top predicted contacts were assessed, where l is the length of the target protein. these evaluation metrics are also similar to those used in the past editions of the critical assessment of fully automated structure prediction methods  <cit>  and in the eva contact evaluation server  <cit> . we use the similar procedure to compute accuracy  and coverage  for all server predictors.

we compare svmcon with the other contact map predictors on the  <dig> out of  <dig> casp <dig> de novo domains whose structures have been released. the contact map predictors participating in casp <dig> include svmcon, betapro  <cit> , sam-t <dig>  <cit> , profcon  <cit> , gajdapairings, distill  <cit> , possum  <cit> , and gpcpred  <cit> . their contact predictions were downloaded from the casp <dig> website.

the eight contact map predictors are evaluated on the  <dig> de novo domains of casp <dig>  the  <dig> domains include . the experimental structures of the targets and the domain classification can be found at the casp <dig> web site (). the accuracy and coverage of contact predictions are evaluated at sequence separation >=  <dig> and >=  <dig>  respectively. it is worth noting that profcon only made predictions for  <dig> out of  <dig> domains. thus its performance can not be directly compared with other methods. here we includes its results for completeness.

another caveat is that the evaluation dataset and scheme we used may be slightly different from the official casp <dig> evaluation. thus, here we only try to evaluate the current state of the art of contact predictors instead of ranking them. for the offical contact evaluation scheme and results, readers are advised to check the assessment paper of the casp <dig> contact predictions published in the upcoming supplement issue of the journal proteins.

overall, these results on the casp <dig> dataset show that the accuracy and coverage of protein contact prediction are still low. however, these results are an important step towards reaching the milestone of an accuracy level of about 30%, required for deriving moderately accurate  3d protein structures from scratch  <cit>  . in particular, these predictors tend to predict different correct contacts. thus, a consensus combination of contact map predictors may yield more accurate contact map predictions, which in turn could significantly improve 3d structure reconstruction. since the stakes of contact map prediction are high, a community-wide effort for improving contact map prediction should be worthwhile .

it is also worth pointing out that the casp <dig> de novo dataset is too small to reliably estimate the accuracy of the predictors. so one should not over-interpret these results. indeed, when we use a larger casp de novo dataset of  <dig> domains classified by dr. dylan chivian from dr. david baker's group to evaluate the predictors , the accuracy of svmcon and betapro are very close for both sequence separations >=  <dig> and  <dig>  and both remain among the top predictors.

CONCLUSIONS
we have described a new contact map predictor  that uses support vector machines to integrate a large number of useful information including profiles, secondary structure, solvent accessibility, contact potentials, residue types, segment window information  <cit> , and protein-level information  <cit> . the method yields a 4% improvement over the state-of-the art contact map predictor cmappro. in the blind casp <dig> experiment, svmcon is ranked as one of the top contact predictors. the method represents an effort toward a good 2d structure prediction. it can be used to improve ab initio structure prediction  <cit>  and analogous fold recognition  <cit> . the web server, software, and source code are available at the svmcon website  <cit> .
