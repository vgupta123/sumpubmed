BACKGROUND
micrornas , a class of small non-coding rnas, have emerged as an important and abundant group of gene expression regulators in a wide range of species  <cit> . mature mirna sequences are approximately 20– <dig> nucleotides  long, and are formed from longer primary mirnas that contain hairpin stem-loop structures  <cit> . mirnas recognize the complementary 3’-untranslated regions  of mrnas to inhibit their expression . each mirna may have multiple gene targets, and each gene target may also be regulated by multiple mirnas  <cit> . mirnas are often expressed in a tissue-specific manner, and a large proportion of protein coding genes of animals are regulated by mirnas  <cit> . mirnas are key molecules in many biological processes, including apoptosis, cell proliferation and tissue development.

among teleosts, mirnas were first examined in zebrafish  <cit> . mirna catalogs of various tissues in other fish species were characterized more recently . currently,  <dig> mirnas have been identified in  <dig> teleost species, compared to  <dig> mirnas in human   <cit> , suggesting that more mirnas await characterization in fishes. next generation sequencing facilitates the profiling of both known and novel mirnas, especially those expressed in low abundance. data from such deep sequencing will help to characterize the structure of mirna molecules, and will provide quantitative measurement of their expression.

teleosts are the largest group of vertebrates and exhibit a remarkable variety of sexual systems  <cit> . genes, environmental factors, and even social interaction may contribute to sex determination and differentiation in a large number of fish species  <cit> . compared to other vertebrates, the molecular mechanisms of sex determination and differentiation in teleosts are quite diverse  <cit> . over the past few years, seven master sex-determining genes have been identified in teleosts, namely dmy/dmrt1by in oryzias latipes and o. curvinotus  <cit> , gsdfy in o. luzonensis  <cit> , sox <dig> in o. dancena  <cit> , amhy in odontesthes hatchery  <cit>  and oreochromis niloticus  <cit> , amhrii in takifugu rubripes  <cit> , gdf6y in nothobranchius furzeri  <cit>  and sdy in oncorhynchus mykiss and several other salmonids  <cit> . however, it is well-known that sex steroid hormones, especially estrogens, may influence early sex differentiation in fishes, in spite of variation in the master sex determining genes and the non-conserved subsequent genetic steps of sex differentiation  <cit> . previous studies have been focused mainly on the function of cyp19a1a, which encodes the key enzyme responsible for the conversion of androgens to estrogens . the expression of cyp19a1a in the gonads is mediated by both foxl <dig>  <cit>  and dmrt <dig>  <cit> .

several studies have explored the role of mirnas in regulating sex differentiation. let- <dig> and mir- <dig> have been shown to regulate development of rainbow trout eggs  <cit> . mirnas are also involved in oocyte development, hydration, and competence, indicating their importance in the regulation of oogenesis  <cit> . mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> have crucial functions in yellow catfish testis development and spermatogenesis  <cit> . different expression pattern of mirnas is observed between the embryos of females and males  <cit> , as well as the ovaries and testes in tilapia gonads at later stages  <cit> , indicating their regulatory roles during fish reproduction. let-7a, mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> are upregulated to induce testes differentiation in halibut  <cit> . therefore, mirnas may represent novel regulators of gonadal development and sexual differentiation. however, in these studies the small rna libraries were generated from whole embryos or from gonads at later developmental stages, which may mask important sex-biased mirnas in gonads at the critical stage of sex differentiation. importantly, the regulatory roles of mirnas during early sex differentiation of fishes have not been investigated extensively. functional prediction of mirnas solely based on computational mirna-mrna interactions bears a high number of false positive predictions  <cit> . thus, the joint investigation of mirna and mrna expression may help us to improve the quality of predicted interactions and understand the molecular mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation.

nile tilapia  is one of the most important farmed fish with a production exceeding  <dig>  million tons in  <dig> . the growth rate of males is significantly higher than that of females in tilapia. all-male stocks are preferred because they improve the efficiency of commercial production. it is therefore important to understand the molecular mechanism of sex determination in this species. thus, quantifying the expression of both mirnas and mrnas in the undifferentiated gonads at the critical stage of molecular sex determination  <cit> , approximately 5 days after hatching , might help to clarify the regulatory network during early sex differentiation and provide new information on the role of mirnas in gonadal function.

RESULTS
identification of conserved mirnas in the tilapia genome
the reference set of  <dig> known teleost pre-mirna sequences was used for a similarity search against the tilapia reference genome assembly. we manually checked the best hits to extract putative tilapia pre-mirnas and confirmed that they were able to fold into the secondary stem-loop structure necessary for mirna biogenesis. this resulted in the prediction of  <dig> distinct tilapia pre-mirna genes . pre-mirnas were non-randomly distributed in the tilapia genome . no pre-mirnas were observed on lg <dig>  while  <dig> were observed on lg <dig> . also, some pre-mirnas were encoded at a single chromosomal location , while others were encoded on multiple chromosomes . comparisons of the number of pre-mirnas identified in the tilapia genome with those reported in other fishes were shown in fig.  <dig> and additional file 2: figure s <dig>  the data suggested that most of the pre-mirnas identified in tilapia have homologs in other fishes. to further study the conservation and evolution of the known pre-mirnas in teleosts, sequence comparisons were also made with astatotilapia burtoni, neolamprologus brichardi, pundamilia nyererei, metriaclima zebra, oryzias latipes, gasterosteus aculeatus and danio rerio. based on these analyses, most of the pre-mirnas showed a high level of conservation among the various fish species .fig.  <dig> genomic distribution of identified pre-mirnas in tilapia

high-throughput sequencing of mirnas in tilapia gonads
deep sequencing of mirnas from tilapia xx and xy gonads at  <dig> dah was performed using the illumina hiseq  <dig> platform. approximately  <dig> million reads were obtained from each library. after filtering low-quality reads and empty adaptor sequences,  <dig> , <dig> sequences from the xx gonad and  <dig> , <dig> sequences from the xy gonad were mapped to the tilapia genome, amounting to  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the total mirna libraries, respectively . a total of  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig>  reads were mapped to mirbase entries, representing a total of  <dig> mirnas . in both xx and xy gonads, the majority of mirnas were in the range of  <dig> to  <dig> nts, accounting for  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the total mappable reads . the average length of the mature mirnas in the xx and xy gonad were  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp, respectively.table  <dig> number of high-throughput reads generated from mirna libraries of tilapia xx and xy gonads at  <dig> dah

to profile the chromosomal distribution of active mirnas detected, the read counts for each chromosome from both xx and xy gonads were consolidated and the percentage of transcribed mirna reads per chromosome was computed. approximately 40 % of the mature mirnas were localized to lg  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . only a few reads were mapped to lg <dig>  which is large and known to be highly repetitive. the identified mirnas in tilapia covered a large proportion of reported mirnas in fishes, such as d. rerio, t. nigroviridis, t. rubripes, o. latipes . most of the previously reported cichlid mirnas  <cit>  exhibited orthology to the identified mirnas in the present study .fig.  <dig> circos circular visualization of the mirna reads coverage on tilapia genome



the top  <dig> most abundant mirnas in tilapia gonads included mir-10a-5p, mir-10b, mir-10c-5p, mir-10d, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir-181a-5p and accounted for  <dig>  %  of the  <dig> , <dig>  reads mapped to mirbase. sequence analysis indicated that the relative abundance of mirnas from one mirna family varied greatly in the tilapia gonads, suggesting possible functional divergence among different members within the mirna family. for example, abundance of different members of the mir- <dig> family varied from  <dig> reads  to  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig>  in tilapia xx and xy gonads, respectively.

identification of novel sex-biased mirnas in tilapia gonads
from the reads mapped to tilapia genome, we identified potentially novel mirnas that were not matched to any sequences in the mirbase. based on analyzing the surrounding sequences  for the ability to form hairpin structures,  <dig> novel mirnas displayed sex-biased expression . these putative mirnas showed sequences variations at the 5’ or 3’ terminus compared with known mirnas in mirbase. of the  <dig> novel mirnas,  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas were identified uniquely in xx and xy gonads, respectively. a greater proportion of the novel mirnas were sex-biased than were the set of known mirnas.

identification of mirnas uniquely expressed in tilapia xx and xy gonads
among the  <dig> mature mirnas identified in the two libraries,  <dig> mirnas were expressed in both libraries. we next directed our attention to the mirnas that were identified exclusively from either xx or xy gonads.  <dig> mirnas including mir-34c-5p, mir-153-5p, mir- <dig>  and mir-2187-5p were expressed exclusively in xx gonads, while  <dig> mirnas including mir-1306-5p, mir-132b and mir-18c were expressed exclusively in xy gonads. however, no mirnas appeared exclusively in either sex with more than  <dig> reads.

identification of mirnas differentially expressed in tilapia gonads
we then compared the transcription level of differentially expressed mirnas between xx and xy libraries to define mirnas related to early ovary or testis differentiation.  <dig> mirnas showed higher expression levels in xx gonads, whereas  <dig> were more highly expressed in xy gonads . mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-217a, and mir- <dig> showed greater expression in ovaries. the mirnas upregulated in xy gonads included mir-27d, mir-29b, mir-92b, mir-140-3p, mir-144-5p, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  some abundantly expressed mirnas also showed sex-biased expression with ~ <dig>  fold change, including mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir-200b.fig.  <dig> comparison of expression levels of mirnas in xx and xy gonads. the x axis and y axis show expression level of mirnas in the two samples, respectively. red points represent mirnas with ratio > 2; green points represent mirnas with 1/2 < ratio ≤ 2; blue points represent mirnas with ratio ≤ 1/ <dig>  ratio = normalized expression of xx gonad/normalized expression of xy gonad



identification of mirnas involved in steroidogenic pathways and early sex differentiation
a total of  <dig>  target genes were predicted for the  <dig> mirnas by miranda and targetscan. the predicted modes of action for the predominant mirnas in gonad included: 1) a single mirna targeting a single or multiple position in the 3’ utr; 2) multiple mirnas targeting different positions in the 3’ utr of the same gene. the expression of target genes was quantified by mrna sequencing at  <dig> dah. sequencing of the mrna libraries yielded ~ <dig> million reads for female and male pool. in order to identify major mirnas with possible role in early sex differentiation, we looked for target genes which showed inverse expression patterns compared to female and male upregulated mirnas . on average, miranda and targetscan predictions suggested about  <dig> targets per mirna compared to integrative analysis of mirna and mrna expression data which suggested about  <dig> target predictions per mirna.

subsequently, we examined the expression of key genes known to be involved in the steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway  <cit>  and those that participate in vertebrate sex differentiation  <cit> . cyp19a1a, foxl <dig>  cyp11a <dig>  hsd3b and amh showed female upregulated expression, while dmrt <dig> and hsd11b showed up-regulation in males at  <dig> dah. nine micrornas  were predicted to regulate the expression of cyp19a1a. among these  <dig> micrornas, all members of mir- <dig> family showed down-regulation in females, though the difference was not a 2-fold decrease. dmrt <dig> was predicted to be the target of mir-9-3p, mir-22-5p, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-212-3p and mir- <dig>  and the expression of mir-212-3p was downregulated in males. mir-203a, 203-3p, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> were predicted to target foxl <dig>  and the expression of mir- <dig> was downregulated in the xx gonad . interestingly, some mirnas targeted two or more genes in the regulatory network of tilapia gonadal differentiation: mir- <dig> targeted both amh and hsd3b, while mir- <dig> targeted both star <dig> and hsd11b. other mirnas targeting key genes in the pathway for sex steroids synthesis and early sex differentiation, including gsdf and star <dig>  were listed in additional file 11: table s <dig> fig.  <dig> mirna-gene network in the steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway  <cit>  and regulatory network in early sex differentiation of nile tilapia. the genes in boxes are differentially expressed in the mrna-seq and were validated by previous transcriptomic analyses  <cit> . blue box nodes represent upregulated genes in xy gonads, red box nodes represent upregulated genes in xx gonads, and black box nodes represent genes with no significant difference between xx and xy. mirnas in the ellipses potentially regulated the corresponding gene expression. blue ellipses represent downregulated mirnas in xx gonads; red ellipses represent downregulated mirnas in xy gonads



discussion
mirnas regulate a vast number of genes  <cit> , which makes them likely to play a critical role in programming the ovary and testis. in the present study, both in silico prediction of conserved pre-mirnas and an integrated analysis of deep sequencing of mirna and mrna from xx and xy gonads at the critical stage of sex determination were performed to identify conserved mirnas in fish and sex-associated mirnas in tilapia.

previous bioinformatic studies identified  <dig> conserved mirnas and  <dig> pre-mirnas in cichlid fishes, using est, gss and partial genomic sequences  <cit> . the present study identified a total of  <dig> conserved pre-mirnas, by comparing the published tilapia genome to pre-mirnas deposited in mirbase  <dig> . the increase can be attributed to the submission of additional fish mirnas to mirbase, and to an improved assembly of the tilapia genome.

the number of mirna precursors varied significantly among chromosomes. the smallest number of mirnas was identified on lg <dig> by both in silico prediction and mirna reads mapping, even though it is the longest chromosome in the karyotype. lg <dig> carries a higher number of mirna genes, suggesting an important role for this chromosome in regulating tilapia tissue development and differentiation as in human  <cit> . mirnas are also reported to be non-randomly distributed in the human and mouse genomes . in addition, the multiple locations of the same mirna on different lgs, such as pre-mir- <dig> and pre-mir- <dig>  suggest the possibility that transcription of the same mirna from different sites may regulate the expression of target genes in different tissues or at different development stages  <cit> .

in fish, the mirna distribution in organs of the reproductive axis  has recently been reported in mature stages of the atlantic halibut  <cit> , yellow catfish  <cit> , and nile tilapia  <cit> . however, to date there is little data on mirnas that have a possible role in early sex differentiation, especially in fish gonads. only one previous study identified  <dig> sexually differentially expressed mirnas in early developing tilapia embryos  <cit> . thus, we performed mirna and mrna illumina sequencing on the same gonadal sample to identify the complete set of known and novel mirnas, as well as explore their possible roles in early sex differentiation.

the mirna libraries of xx and xy gonads displayed similar read length distribution after filtering high quality sequencing. the most abundant mirnas in both libraries were  <dig> and 22 nt, followed by 23 nt, representing the typical size of dicer-derived products, and is consistent with the length distribution of mirna in mouse  <cit> . ovary and testis at the mature stages in zebrafish and tilapia show significant pirna expression with another peak at 26–28 nt due to the abundant expression of piwi-interacting rnas   <cit> . in the present study, there were more mirnas with length of  <dig> and 22 nt in xx gonads, whereas in xy gonads there were more mirnas with length of 23 nt, which has also been observed in a previous study of gonadal mirnas in tilapia  <cit> .

in tilapia gonads at  <dig> dah, the most abundant mirnas were mir-10a-5p, mir-10b, mir-10c-5p, mir-10d, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir-181a-5p, each with more than several thousand reads. as in human, members of mir- <dig> family dominate the mirna population in both ovary and testis, consistent with a relationship of members of mir- <dig> with sex hormones  <cit> . expression of mir- <dig> increases substantially following the induction of differentiation, suggesting its important roles in stem cell differentiation  <cit>  and endocrine regulation  <cit> . mir- <dig> is also highly expressed in mature ovaries and testes of yellow catfish  <cit> , indicating its possible involvement in gonadal development. the mir-181a family is abundantly expressed in the gonads of tilapia  <cit> , mouse  <cit> , and human  <cit> , which suggests that this family also may play a crucial role in sex determination and differentiation. the most abundantly expressed mirnas in tilapia xx and xy gonads at  <dig> dah are functionally conserved with other vertebrates, indicating that these mirnas may play conserved role in gonadal development and differentiation. however, we also identified  <dig> novel sex-biased mirnas that were not similar to any known conserved mirnas in mirbase. these novel mirnas with overall low abundance may be newly evolved in tilapia, or may have been overlooked in other species. the preferential expression of one of the duplexes  of mature mirna  has also been reported from different tissues of mouse  <cit> . these results indicate that different duplexes within one mirna can have clearly different expression levels, mostly due to tissue or developmental stage-specific expression.

no sex-specific mirnas with reads higher than  <dig> were identified in tilapia gonads, a result that is consistent with the previous study where the expression levels of the tissue-specific expressed mirnas were low in holstein cattle   <cit> . more mirnas were significantly upregulated in ovaries, which is also observed in adult nile tilapia  <cit> , medaka  <cit>  and holstein cattle  <cit> . among these upregulated mirnas, some have been reported to be very important in ovarian development in various species, such as mir- <dig> in regulating ovary differentiation in embryonic chicken gonads  <cit> , mir- <dig> in ovarian development with the putative target wt <dig> and gata <dig>  <cit> . our results  are in agreement with previous studies. for example, mir-140-3p is also abundantly expressed in sertoli cells of the developing mouse testis  <cit> . mir- <dig> has been suggested to play an important role in testicular differentiation in xenopus  <cit> . as in tilapia, mir- <dig> is also a dominant mirna in swine, indicating its involvement in testicular development  <cit> . mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are also upregulated in tilapia ovary, while mir-27d, mir-29b, mir-92b, mir-144-5p and mir- <dig> show the same pattern of greater expression in testes at later stage  <cit> , suggesting they might play crucial roles in tilapia sex differentiation. however, the function of most other sex-biased mirnas was previously unknown. more studies are needed to uncover the regulatory roles of these mirnas.

by applying integrated mirna and mrna analysis together with target prediction, we reduced the complexity of predicted mirna-mrna relations on average by more than 50-fold compared to pure in silico prediction. thus, we were able to explore the functional details of sex-biased mirnas in early sex differentiation with the combined data. the transcriptomic data collected in the current work and a previous study  <cit>  further confirmed the critical role of estrogen in sex determination and differentiation. the differentially expressed mirnas targeted multiple genes, including those genes encoding key enzymes in the steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway   <cit>  and key factors involved in early sex differentiation   <cit> . cyp19a1a encodes the key enzyme responsible for estrogen synthesis. xx gonads with higher expression of cyp19a1a exhibited lower expression of mir- <dig>  which suggests a critical role of the mir- <dig> family in early sex differentiation via ovarian cell steroidogenesis as in human  <cit> . however, how the ovary is differentiated through cyp19a1a expression being regulated by the mir- <dig> family remains to be investigated. furthermore, foxl <dig> and dmrt <dig> play antagonistic roles in sex differentiation in nile tilapia via regulation of cyp19a1a expression and estrogen production  <cit> . elevated expression of foxl <dig> and decreased expression of mir- <dig> in tilapia xx gonads indicates the possible role of mir- <dig> in early sex differentiation. the higher expression of mir- <dig>  which may repress the expression of dmrt <dig> in the xx gonad, suggests its possible role as a post-transcriptional regulator in the differentiation of granulosa cells, as demonstrated in mouse  <cit> . interestingly, some mirnas  target multiple genes involved in steroid synthesis, suggesting the complex regulatory network in fish sex determination and differentiation. hence, these results suggest a role for mirnas in regulating the biosynthesis of steroid hormones during tilapia early sex differentiation.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study is the first to examine the mirna and mrna expression profile of tilapia xx and xy gonads in early sex differentiation. we identified  <dig> known mirnas that were differentially expressed between the xx and xy gonads. the predicted targets of these sex-biased mirnas included genes encoding key enzymes in steroidogenic pathways and key molecules involved in vertebrate sex differentiation. these genes also showed sex-biased expression in tilapia gonads at  <dig> dah based on transcriptomic analysis. some mirna  targeted multiple genes involved in steroid synthesis, indicating the complex regulatory network in fish early sex differentiation. an additional  <dig> novel mirnas with differential expression in the xx and xy gonad were also identified. these mirnas are an interesting starting point for future research to understand mirna-mrna interaction in early sex differentiation of teleosts. the availability of mono-sex fish and genome editing in tilapia makes it an attractive model system for study of mirna function during sex determination and differentiation.
