BACKGROUND
although ancestors of mammals are believed to have been small carnivores, primarily feeding on invertebrates or other vertebrates
 <cit> , dietary shifts into herbivorous niches may have been critical for the massive expansion of mammals
 <cit> . the symbiotic relationship of gut microbiota to provide metabolic activities lacking in the host was undoubtedly a great success in mammalian evolution
 <cit> . each animal operates as a “super-organism”, which consists of gene functions from its own genome, as well as those of the gut microbiome
 <cit> . although the latter enable the host to exploit new dietary niches, the paucity of well characterized model systems has limited understanding of the diversity of gut microbial ecosystems and interactions among components of the “super-organism.” in particular, a complex gut microbiota would be expected in highly folivorous animals, since this specific foraging habit was presumably facilitated by adaptive evolution to extract energy from fibrous leaves.

the diet of giant flying squirrels , which are adapted to a leaf-eating niche in forest trees in the montane areas of taiwan, primarily consists of leaf parts  of diverse tree species
 <cit> . that those leaves supply less energy per unit weight relative to other plant parts  poses special difficulties for folivores
 <cit> . furthermore, the giant flying squirrel weighs no more than  <dig>  kg, making it one of the smallest mammals sustained by a strictly folivorous diet
 <cit> . compared to large herbivores , small herbivores have a relatively high energy demand, but low absolute gut capacity
 <cit> . therefore, giant flying squirrels are expected to have complex digestive strategies, including a well-adapted gut microbiota.

metagenomics, which uses efficient sequencing techniques to provide enormous datasets for phylogenetic and functional analyses, is well suited to investigating gut microbiota engaged in complex metabolic interactions
 <cit> . in the present study, a fosmid library was used for reconstructing partial genomes of novel uncultured bacteria expected to be involved in plant biomass degradation. furthermore, a 16s rrna gene survey and metagenomic approaches were used to investigate genetic diversity and functional capability of the cecal microbiota in the folivorous flying squirrel .

our data clearly elucidated the functional signature of this mammalian "super-organism" adapted to a particular ecological environment. during the transition to a specific foliage diet, extensive changes due to adaptive evolution on flying squirrels and their gut microbiota were manifested in the entire system, rather than a single species or gene. we inferred that the limited energy provided by a leaf diet was allocated and circulated among numerous microbial species and the host, apparently resulting in mutually beneficial interactions. the metagenomic datasets generated advanced our understanding regarding the complex processes of supplying the energy needed for small mammalian folivores; furthermore, they may provide insights into energy transfer in forest ecosystems.

RESULTS
anatomical confirmation of the cecum as a fermentation chamber
it is generally accepted that small mammalian herbivores have substantial cecal microbial fermentation
 <cit> . we sought to verify if this was the case in the flying squirrel. we examined  <dig> white-faced flying squirrels, each with a full gastrointestinal  tract. for all  <dig> squirrels, the average length of the entire gi tract was 411 ±  <dig> cm ,  <dig> times the body length . this gi tract to body length ratio was similar to those of other cecum-fermenter mammals
 <cit> , such as rabbits  and lemurs 
 <cit> . the weight/length ratio including food  was used as an indicator of the digesta-retaining capacity of the small intestine, cecum, and large intestine. an extremely distended cecum, containing nearly 50% of the gut contents by weight, was the most salient feature . moreover, the weight/length ratio for the cecum was 6– <dig> times greater than that of the small or large intestines.

phylogenetic profiles of cecal microbiota, based on 16s rrna gene sequences
to characterize the bacterial community of the cecum, 16s rrna gene libraries were constructed from  <dig> individuals . after elimination of short, low-quality, and chimera sequences, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> sequences were obtained for fs <dig> and fs <dig>  respectively. based on a 97% sequence identity threshold, the  <dig> libraries respectively contained  <dig>  and  <dig>  phylotypes or otus , with  <dig>  and  <dig>  estimated species diversity  of cecal microbiota .

the 16s rrna sequences from the  <dig> flying squirrels were classified into  <dig> phyla of bacteria, with <1% unclassified bacterial sequences . two microbial communities were both extremely dominated by firmicutes, with sequence abundances of  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively . the remainder of the sequences belonged to actinobacteria , proteobacteria , and verrucomicrobia .

“flying squirrel” represented combined data for cecal mircrobiota of  <dig> flying squirrels . "mouse" represents combined data for cecal microbiota of  <dig> lean mice
 <cit> . "cattle" represents combined data for rumen microbiota of  <dig> cattle
 <cit> . numbers of phylotypes  for each phylum were given for analyses of 16s rrna gene libraries. numbers in parentheses for “flying squirrel” were relative abundances estimated by fosmid end-sequences from  <dig> flying squirrel .

data from the present study were compared to published data from fecal samples of  <dig> mammalian species
 <cit> , and from the fermentation chambers of lean laboratory mice 
 <cit>  and cattle 
 <cit> , using the principal coordinates analysis  of the unifrac metric matrix . this analysis summarized variation in sampled communities, based on phylogenetic differences in bacterial members, and generated plots that separated individual communities. the flying squirrels were near to other herbivores, but not clustered with the omnivorous prevost's squirrel, although they are phylogenetic kin . as expected, mice were similar to other omnivores, whereas cattle were far from most foregut herbivores, as were banteng, a close relative of cattle, which may reflect domestication of these two ruminant species.
 <cit> . the scores for the first  <dig> dimensions  are plotted. data for the cattle and mice were derived from
 <cit>  and
 <cit> , respectively.

to gain more insight into fermentation chambers , we further compared our data to those from the mouse cecum
 <cit>  and the cattle rumen
 <cit>  . a total of  <dig> bacterial phyla/groups were identified by 16s rrna gene sequences obtained from the  <dig> host species , of which microbial communities differed in the proportions of microbial groups . it was noteworthy that  <dig> communities were all dominated by firmicutes . further, bacteroidetes was absent from the flying squirrel, but was well represented in both the mouse  and cattle . when the 16s rdna sequence variation and relative abundances of phylotypes were considered, the  <dig> species, which each formed a tight cluster, were well separated by pcoa , based on the weighted unifrac metric matrix .

phylogenetic profile of microbiota based on fosmid end-sequences
based on analysis of ~ <dig> mb of metagenomic sequences ,  <dig>  open reading frames  were predicted from the fosmid end-sequences and treated as gene tags . up to 65% of the gene tags were classified into taxonomic ranks, based on matches in the seed database. according to the annotation, the majority of the microbiota belonged to bacteria , with the remainder attributed to archaea , eukaryota , and viruses .

the annotation allowed an additional assessment of microbial diversity from a third individual  in the present study. for bacteria, the most abundant phylum was firmicutes , followed by proteobacteria , verrucomicobia , actinobacteria ,bacteroidetes , chloroflexi , spirochaetes , cyanobacteria , with an additional  <dig> phyla/groups each constituting < 1% . in general, predominant phylogenetic groups represented by the fosmid end-sequences were similar to those identified in the 16s rrna gene survey, but the pattern, based on fosmid end-sequences, differed from that based on 16s rrna sequences , as 16s probing could only detect bacterial phyla and more bacterial phyla were detected by fosmid end-sequences , including those that were likely missed due to primer bias resulting from the 16s rrna gene survey. additionally, fosmid end-sequences detected non-bacterial phyla and viruses.

one hundred and sixteen sequences were assigned to archaea, namely euryarchaeota  and crenarchaeota ; the majority belonged to methanogens . sixteen eukaryotic sequences were also identified in the cecal microbiome, belonging to multicellular metazoan , fungi, and viridiplantae . finally,  <dig> viral sequences were identified; all were assigned to double-stranded dna viruses  which only infect bacteria.

functional profile of the microbiota, based on fosmid end-sequences
the gene functions of the cecal microbiota were analyzed by searching similarity against several databases. based on the mg-rast results,  <dig>  of the  <dig>  gene tags were assigned to  <dig> of the seed subsystems, in which genes are annotated according to biochemical pathways and their specific functional roles
 <cit> . on the basis of seed subsystem hierarchy  <dig>  hits were attributed to  <dig> functional groups . the “clustering-based subsystems” was the largest group, representing ~13% of hits. genes in this category are functionally coupled, since they usually cluster together in genomic regions, although their activities are poorly understood. the next  <dig> most prominent groups were involved in protein metabolism , amino acids and derivatives , carbohydrate metabolism , and synthesis of cofactors / vitamins . collectively, these  <dig> dominant groups accounted for almost 50% of the hits.

protein metabolism was the second most prominent functional category and was dominated by the subcategory of biosynthesis , followed by folding , secretion , and degradation . within the protein biosynthesis subcategory, most genes were involved in trna aminoacylation . in addition, bacterial ribosomal proteins  were also abundant in this subcategory. in the protein folding subcategory,  <dig> chaperone proteins  were identified. proteins involved in the secretory pathway, e.g. preprotein translocase subunits  and protein-export membrane proteins , were also detected.

the third most prominent functional category contained genes involved in production and recycling of amino acids. in addition to those involved in a variety of biosynthetic pathways, genes related to urea hydrolysis, including genes coding for the alpha, beta, and gamma subunits of urease, and for urease accessory protein ured / ureg, were also detected.

the fourth most prominent category, carbohydrate metabolism, was dominated by central carbohydrate metabolism , including enzymes involved in the tca cycle, pyruvate metabolism, and  <dig> pathways for glucose degradation to pyruvate . in addition, the subcategories of monosaccharides  and di- and oligosaccharides  were also abundant. both sugar-degrading enzymes  and sugar-transporters  were detected.

following the carbohydrate metabolism category was a group of genes involved in synthesis of cofactors / vitamins, of which folate biosynthesis  was the most abundant subsystem. in addition, syntheses of tetrapyrroles, coenzyme a, and quinone cofactors were well-represented . genes associated with biosynthesis of b vitamins, such as thiamine , riboflavin , niacin , pantothenic acid , pyridoxine , biotin , folic acid , and cobalamin , were also detected.

similar to results obtained from the seed subsystems, functional categories identified using the cog  and kegg  databases showed that genes involved in amino acid metabolism , carbohydrate metabolism , and metabolism of cofactors and vitamins  were common within the cecal metagenome. comparing the proportion of major metabolic categories based on the seed and kegg databases, carbohydrate metabolism was as dominant as amino acid metabolism, whereas based on cog, amino acid metabolism was twice as well represented as carbohydrate metabolism. in addition, although seed and cog showed that genes involved in metabolism of cofactors and vitamins were more abundant than those in nucleotide metabolism, kegg showed the opposite trend. some apparent discrepancies may be due to differences  in naming and assigning differences. according to the cog and kegg classifications, genes involved in energy metabolism  were abundant. those genes were classified into seed subsystems of respiration , sulfur metabolism , and nitrogen metabolism . otherwise, genes in protein metabolism of seed were categorized into information processing groups such as translation of cog and kegg databases.

to focus on carbohydrate-active enzymes related to degradation of polysaccharides, sequences were annotated using information from the cazy database
 <cit> . thirty-three polysaccharide-degrading enzymes belonging to  <dig> glycoside hydrolase  families and  <dig> carbohydrate esterase  family were detected in the fosmid end-sequence dataset;  <dig> carbohydrate-binding modules  associated with detected ghs were also identified . these enzymes included cellulases  and hemicellulases . the amino acid identity between the fosmid end-sequences and the reference sequences ranged from  <dig> to 91%.

gene contents of fosmid inserts containing carbohydrate-associated genes
sequences from  <dig> fosmid inserts were characterized to provide a survey of large contiguous genomic fragments. a total of  <dig> mb of pyrosequencing paired-end reads was assembled into  <dig> scaffolds, comprising  <dig>  kb genomic fragments. the average scaffold length was  <dig> kb . in this dataset,  <dig> large scaffolds , each containing at least  <dig> carbohydrate-active enzymes, were chosen for further analysis. the assembled sequences for these  <dig> fosmid inserts were  <dig>  bp  and  <dig>  bp  and contained  <dig> and  <dig> orfs, respectively . on average, 89% of the sequences were protein-coding regions. the functional and taxonomic assignments of these orfs were annotated according to the ncbi-nr and the cog databases .
 <dig> 

based on taxonomic assignments, these  <dig> genomic fragments were of bacterial origin and were likely derived from firmicutes species, since approximately 90% of the orfs were assigned to this phylum . of the  <dig> orfs in the  <dig> scaffolds,  <dig> had ≦ 60% identity with any known gene, whereas only  <dig> had ≧ 80% identity. we inferred that scaffold_ <dig> and scaffold_ <dig> represented segments of hitherto uncharacterized bacterial genomes. based on the cog functional categories ,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> orfs were classified into the g , l , and k  categories, respectively, with other categories containing ≦  <dig> orfs each.

as regards carbohydrate-active enzymes,  <dig> putative ghs were encoded by orfs- <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of scaffold_ <dig> and orfs- <dig> and 28– <dig> of scaffold_ <dig> . with the exception of orf- <dig> in scaffold_ <dig>  which coded for a gh <dig> enzyme, all of these orfs coded for members of the gh <dig> family. the identified gh <dig> contained a catalytic domain  and a sugar-binding domain  with potential activities as a beta-galactosidase, beta-mannosidase, or beta-glucuronidase. the orf- <dig> and orf- <dig> in scaffold_ <dig> coded for a polypeptide homologous to the c-terminal domain  or n-terminal domain  of a gh <dig> enzyme, respectively, whereas orf- <dig> and orf- <dig> in scaffold_ <dig> and orf- <dig> and orf- <dig> in scaffold_ <dig> each coded for both the n-terminal and c-terminal domains of gh <dig> enzymes with known activities, e.g. beta-glucosidase and beta-xylosidase.

the protein sequences of the ghs and their homologs from databases were used to construct a gene dendrogram . the gh <dig> sequences were located at the root and were separated from the gh <dig> sequences. three gh <dig> orfs  were clustered with homologs from various fibrolytic bacteria. the other  <dig> gh <dig> enzymes  were identified as bgl3d and bgl3e , because they clustered with bgl3d and bgl3e of butyrivibrio proteoclasticus b <dig> and ruminococcaceae bacterium d <dig>  in addition, both had homologs in marvinbryantia formatexigens dsm <dig> and ruminococcus gnavus atcc <dig>  it was noteworthy that bgl3d and bgl3e in the reference genomes were encoded by  <dig> adjacent genes, bgl3d and bgl3e, as were our  <dig> gh <dig> enzymes encoded by adjoining orfs.

other identified carbohydrate-associated genes included those coding for  <dig> sugar transporters , a sugar isomerase  and a sugar kinase  . all  <dig> sugar transporters were suger-cation symporters which catalyze the uptake of simple sugars, including galactosides, pentosides, and hexuronides, in conjunction with a monovalent cation . according to the blast results, the isomerase and kinase were probably associated with utilization of l-arabinose and/or d-xylose, and participated in pentose and glucuronate interconversions. furthermore,  <dig> genes that encoded transcriptional regulators  may be involved in regulation of gene expression associated with carbohydrate utilization, due to their proximity to carbohydrate metabolism genes.

discussion
based on the metagenomic profile of cecal microbiota, the giant flying squirrel underwent profound changes to adapt it to a diet of high-fiber, low-quality leaves. as reported for other small herbivores
 <cit> , the prominent cecum of the giant flying squirrel is apparently an anaerobic chamber for microbial breakdown of plant materials, consistent with an important role for cecal microbiota. it is noteworthy that cecal microbiota of the flying squirrel differed from their functional counterpart  of cattle . furthermore, the microbiota of the flying squirrel were also different from those of the prevost's squirrel and laboratory mice, although they are close relatives. in the case of the flying squirrel and cattle, we concluded that independent evolutionary routes lead to similar functions. however, in the case of the flying squirrel and two omnivorous rodents , the influence of diet apparently confounded the phylogeny. in particular, the present study, based on wild-caught mammals, represented gut microbial communities under natural conditions and contributed important new knowledge regarding intricate mechanisms and interactions of the mammalian "super-organism". moreover, most studies on gut microbes have been based on fecal samples  that may not reflect the actual reactions and processes involved in digestion of foods . if the digestive tract is regarded as a “production line”, the present study of cecal microbiota could elucidate the true “power house” for liberation of energy from a diet that is generally resistant to digestion, and thus offer insights into processes shaped by evolution for use of novel energy sources.

based on a comparison of gut microbiota of flying squirrels  and cattle , these  <dig> animals have distinct bacterial compositions, although both rely on the microbiota for the conversion of plant materials into nutrients. they had different phylotypes within firmicutes, actinobacteria, proteobacteria, and verrucomicrobia. these differences might be driven by diet , gut physiology , and co-evolution within  <dig> host lineages . also, the gut microbiota of the mouse and flying squirrel were compared, since both species are phylogenetic kins . on the basis of observations in mouse models
 <cit> , the relative abundance of firmicutes and bacteroidetes was associated with the capacity to harvest energy. compared with lean mice, obese mice had a relatively high fermentative capability, which was associated with an increased number of firmicutes <cit> . since the cecal microbiota of the flying squirrel contained a high percentage of firmicutes and harbored many genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, we inferred that this system might be efficient at extracting energy from dietary polysaccharides, as reported in obese mice
 <cit> .

in addition to the host digestive system, microbial genomes encoding proteins with metabolic functions are responsible for conversion of dietary substances into absorbable nutrients
 <cit> . the present sequence-based study provided a comprehensive method to reconstruct the primary metabolic profile of the cecal microbiota which enables the flying squirrel to survive on a leaf-based diet. according to the metagenomic data, the  <dig> main aspects of this complex degradation system are: 1) plant polysaccharides are broken down into monosaccharides and disaccharides by various microbial glycoside hydrolases, and these simple sugars are transported into bacterial cells and fermented into short-chain fatty acids , which provide energy for the gut epithelium and other tissues
 <cit> . 2) genes involved in protein biosynthesis were much more abundant than those in protein degradation, consistent with other herbivorous microbiomes
 <cit> . due to the low protein content of a leaf-based diet, the cecal microbiota of the flying squirrel require specialized mechanism to derive nitrogen from limited sources. in that regard, the cecal microbiome contained genes related to hydrolysis of urea  into ammonia for synthesis of amino acids and derivatives. 3) the cecal microbiota synthesizes several vitamins, especially b-complex vitamins, which may meet the host’s need for these compounds
 <cit> .

although several studies have focused on polysaccharide utilization by gut microbiota
 <cit> , there is a paucity of knowledge regarding gut microbial constituents and their functional interactions with the host, especially in wild animals. according to the cazy database, multiple enzymes with the ability to catabolize dietary carbohydrates were detected in the cecal microbiome of the flying squirrel. presumably metagenomic studies on the microbiota of wild herbivores that consume a wide range of plants will provide further insights regarding conversion of plant polysaccharides into monosaccharides. based on the distribution of cazy families detected in our fosmid library, we inferred that enzymes for plant oligosaccharide degradation  may be more vital than those for degradation of crystalline cellulose  in the cecum, because the digesta has already been substantially degraded by physical and chemical digestion before it reaches the cecum. furthermore, based on functional annotations, it appeared that firmicutes has an important role in hydrolyzing indigestible dietary polysaccharides, such as components of plant cell walls  and undigested starch, consistent with previous reports
 <cit> .

in general, metagenomic samples from environments with a stable input and turnover of complex plant biomass have a higher abundance of ghs than those from other samples
 <cit> . the gh homologs in our dataset accounted for approximately  <dig> % of the total predicted genes, a similar to that reported in gut metagenomes from the termite, human, and mouse
 <cit> . in addition, the present fosmid library contained more than  <dig> gh families that were highly diverse; this diversity was comparable to that in other cellulolytic bacterial genomes and metagenome datasets
 <cit> . in general, sequence-based searches are more efficient than function-based screening in prospecting for novel enzymes, since target genes can be directly discovered from metagenomic datasets using bioinformatics tools
 <cit> . although metagenomic approaches were used to quickly annotate various carbohydrate-active enzymes, functional assays will be required for confirmation, since sequence homology does not guarantee functional identity. considerable additional studies are required to further elucidate and characterize the diverse plant biomass-degrading genes of the cecal microbiome.

high-throughput sequencing has been used to generate numerous gene candidates for biocatalysts; thereafter, their enzymatic activities have been characterized, with a substantial proportion of putative ghs having predicted enzyme activities
 <cit> . however, most sequence-based metagenomic studies have limitations for downstream cloning and expression of genes, since the coverage is not enough to assemble full-length orfs, due to the high microbial complexity of most environmental samples
 <cit> . we therefore constructed a fosmid library, in which each clone contained an insert of ~ <dig> kb of genomic sequence, long enough to reveal the cluster of genes in a genome, thereby improving characterization of the cecal microbiome. in this study,  <dig> fosmid inserts representing a total of  <dig> orfs were identified as genomic fragments of firmicutes, the most abundant and diverse phylum among the mammalian indigenous microbial communities
 <cit> . these  <dig> inserts contained large gene clusters associated with plant polysaccharide utilization, including transcriptional regulators, glycoside hydrolases, sugar transporters, and downstream genes. the genomic arrangement of these  <dig> fragments verified that genes of associated metabolic pathways typically clustered together
 <cit> . in prokaryotes, functionally related genes tend to form operons; conservation of neighboring genes suggested co-regulation and co-expression
 <cit> . based on sequence comparison, our results confirmed co-occurrence of bgl3d and bgl3e in several bacterial genomes, consistent with a functional interaction between this pair of gh <dig> enzymes.

CONCLUSIONS
we characterized cecal microbiota of the flying squirrel, a small wild rodent with unique dietary preferences. on the basis of functional profiles, we inferred that microbial metabolism greatly contributed to intestinal functions, including degradation of carbohydrates, metabolism of proteins, and synthesis of vitamins. furthermore, since  <dig> polysaccharide-degrading enzymes and  <dig> large genomic fragments containing a series of carbohydrate-associated genes were identified, we concluded that cecal microbiota have great metabolic potential for converting diverse plant materials into absorbable nutrients. although the present study was based on metagenomic analysis of a limited number of samples, these findings are a valuable first-step exploration of cecal microbial diversity and functions in wild-caught flying squirrels. further screening of novel enzymes degrading plant polysaccharides and metatranscriptomic analysis could enhance our knowledge of how plant biomass is processed by wild folivorous animals, in association with their symbiotic microbial community.
