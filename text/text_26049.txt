BACKGROUND
mosquitoes are vectors of several human diseases representing a major burden for public health worldwide  <cit> . half of the world’s population is exposed to malaria while dengue fever represents a burden in over  <dig> countries with  <dig>  billion people at risk  <cit> . since the 1950s, chemical insecticides have been massively used for controlling mosquito populations but their efficacy is now threatened by resistance mechanisms developed by insects. in absence of efficient alternatives, characterizing molecular mechanisms underlying resistance is a key step for improving resistance management strategies.

resistance to insecticides can be the consequence of different mechanisms, such as a mutation of the proteins targeted by the insecticide , a lower penetration of the insecticide, its sequestration, or its biodegradation   <cit> . target-site insensitivity and metabolic resistance are known as the two main resistance mechanisms in mosquitoes  <cit> . mutations causing target-site insensitivity are well-characterized in mosquitoes and molecular tests detecting these mutations are available for species of public health importance  <cit> . metabolic resistance has been reported worldwide and usually involves detoxification enzymes such as cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases , carboxy/cholinesterases , glutathione s-transferases  and udp glucosyl-transferases   <cit> . however, due to the large number of mosquito genes encoding detoxification enzymes  <cit>  pinpointing those responsible for resistance remains challenging  <cit> . metabolic resistance has been mostly associated with an increased level of detoxification enzymes in resistant populations and multiple candidate genes have been identified by microarray screenings  <cit> . in contrast, polymorphism variations potentially affecting the functionality of detoxification enzymes have been hardly studied in mosquitoes despite evidences suggesting that this phenomenon may play a role in insecticide resistance  <cit> . recently, polymorphism of a p <dig> gene has been associated with pyrethroid resistance in the mosquito culex pipiens <cit>  and a reduction of sequence diversity in two p <dig> genes conferring resistance to pyrethroids has been observed in anopheles funestus <cit> . this suggests that a deep analysis of the polymorphism associated with resistance can improve our understanding of mechanisms developed by mosquitoes to resist insecticides. today, such knowledge gap can be overcome by high throughput sequencing approaches such as mrna sequencing , which can generates concomitantly gene expression and polymorphism data over the whole transcriptome from a single experiment  <cit> .

in this context, the aim of the present study was to use rna-seq for investigating transcription level and polymorphism variations associated with adaptation to three insecticides from distinct chemical families in the mosquito aedes aegypti. a susceptible strain was selected with the pyrethroid permethrin, the neonicotinoid imidacloprid or the carbamate propoxur, to produce three resistant strains. after ten generations of selection, the constitutive resistance level of each resistant strain was measured and the transcriptome of each strain was deep sequenced. after mapping cdna reads to the genome, gene expression and polymorphism variations linked to insecticide selection were identified and compared across strains. results are discussed in regards of known and new putative adaptive mechanisms conferring insecticide resistance in mosquitoes.

RESULTS
insecticide resistance levels
after ten generations of larval selection with the insecticides permethrin , imidacloprid  or propoxur , bioassays revealed a constitutive increased resistance of each selected strain to its respective insecticide as compared to the parental susceptible strain . resistance levels of the perm-r and imida-r strains were moderate but significant . although significant, the resistance level of the propo-r strain to propoxur was considerably lower .

sequencing, read mapping and genome re-annotation
more than  <dig> million 75 bp cdna reads were sequenced across all samples . each mosquito strain was represented by two cdna libraries with an average of  <dig>  million reads per library. more than 80% of reads were successfully mapped on the ae. aegypti genome. filtering on sequence quality and mapping score retained more than  <dig> million reads . for each strain, rpkms  obtained from the two cdna library replicates were well correlated , indicating moderate variations between technical replicates. in consequence, reads from technical replicates were pooled for further analyses.

a transcription signal was detected for 85% of known ae. aegypti genes. comparing transcript coverage between strains revealed similar distributions with rpkms spanning more than  <dig> logs and a median transcript coverage of  <dig>  rpkm  . comparing genome annotation with the distribution and coverage of reads suggested incorrect gene boundary annotations for more than  <dig> transcripts and identified more than  <dig> isolated novel transcription events  based on their transcription signal, structure and high distance to known transcripts . distribution of mapped reads across the whole ae. aegypti genome can be accessed at http://vectorbase.org using the ‘configure this page’ and ‘rnaseq alignments’ options of the genome browser .

differential transcription in insecticide-selected strains
differential transcription analysis was performed on the  <dig> transcripts showing a transcription signal higher than  <dig>  rpkm in all strains. a total of  <dig> transcripts  including  <dig> known transcripts and  <dig> ntes were considered differentially transcribed in any insecticide-selected strain as compared to the susceptible strain . such threshold appeared biologically relevant as less than 2% of transcription ratios belonging to  <dig> housekeeping genes  were found differentially transcribed as compared to the parental strain. cross-comparison of transcription ratios  obtained from rna-seq and dna microarray was performed for the imida-r strain from the same biological samples . this comparison revealed a good correlation between the two techniques .

the balance between over- and under transcription was contrasted between each strain . the imida-r strain showed the widest response to insecticide selection with  <dig> transcripts specifically over transcribed as compared to the susceptible strain. in contrast, fewer transcripts were affected in perm-r and propo-r strains with the majority of them being under transcribed. a total of  <dig> transcripts were found differentially expressed in multiple strains including  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts over- and under transcribed in all strains respectively.

a clustering analysis based on trs as compared to the susceptible strain was performed on the  <dig> known transcripts differentially transcribed in any insecticide-selected strain . this analysis confirmed the specific over transcription of several genes in the imida-r strain and identified nine main transcript clusters based on their expression profile across strains. assigning known transcripts to biological categories and comparing their frequency to all detected transcripts revealed protein families or biological functions enriched in the different clusters . when considering all clusters as a whole, a significant enrichment of transcripts related to immunity and cuticular proteins was observed. cluster  <dig>  representing transcripts strongly over transcribed in perm-r strain included  <dig> hexamerins associated to cellular trafficking. these hexamerins showed very high trs in the perm-r strain  but were also over transcribed in other insecticide-selected strains . cluster  <dig>  representing transcripts over transcribed in all insecticide-selected strains, showed a significant enrichment in detoxification enzymes. cluster  <dig>  representing transcripts strongly under transcribed in the perm-r strain but not in others, was significantly enriched in cuticle proteins. clusters  <dig> and  <dig> were characterized by transcripts showing a strong over transcription in the imida-r strain and were significantly enriched in cuticular proteins. a significant enrichment in proteins potentially involved in immunity was also observed for cluster  <dig> 

polymorphism variations in insecticide-selected strains
a total of  <dig>  snp loci were identified between any strain and the ae. aegypti reference genome. as expected in populations under selection and experiencing recurrent bottlenecks, a notable lower variability in insecticide-selected strains was observed as compared to the parental susceptible strain . comparative polymorphism analysis identified several alleles differentially represented between insecticide-selected strains and the parental susceptible strain . the perm-r strain showed more differential snps  as compared to other insecticide-selected strains . predicted genic effects of these variations were equally distributed among insecticide-selected strains with ~  <dig> % of them located in 5′utrs, ~ 9% in 3′utrs, ~ 60% within transcript coding sequences, ~ 5% in introns and ~ 20% within 1 kb of gene boundaries . no significant correlation was observed between transcripts differentially transcribed and the presence of differential snps in their 5′ or 3′ utrs . more than  <dig> transcripts were affected by differential snps in at least one insecticide-selected strain . up to  <dig> differential snps per transcript were observed, with  <dig> transcripts affected by >  <dig> differential snps. the perm-r strain showed a higher number of transcripts affected by differential snps as compared to other strains . only  <dig> transcripts were affected by differential snps in all insecticide-selected strains. no differential snp was found in transcripts encoding known insecticide target proteins such as the para-type voltage-gated sodium channel , the acetylcholinesterase  or the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor .

*consequences of allelic changes are only indicated for differential snps . these consequences were computed based on genome annotation.

more than  <dig> differential snps were detected within coding regions . clustering analysis based on allele frequency variations between each insecticide-selected strain and the parental strain evidenced the differential response of each strain to insecticide selection. the perm-r strain showed larger allele frequency variations as compared to other strains . when comparing all detected transcripts with those affected by differential snps , a significant enrichment of transcripts encoding detoxification enzymes was detected. such enrichment was also observed when considering variations predicted as non-synonymous only. when considering each cluster independently, clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  representing differential snps specific to the imida-r strain, did not show any significant enrichment in any biological category. clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were composed of differential snps specific to the perm-r strain and revealed a significant enrichment in transcripts encoding detoxification enzymes, with multiple cytochrome p450s affected. as observed for transcription level variations, several transcripts encoding hexamerins were affected by large polymorphism variations in the perm-r strain . clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  representing differential snps found in the imida-r and propo-r strains, also showed an enrichment in detoxification enzymes, as well as an enrichment in transcripts involved in immune response.

gene ontology terms enrichment analyses
gene ontology  term enrichment analyses were performed independently on transcripts significantly over- or under transcribed or affected by differential snps in their coding region . these analyses confirmed the distinct response of each strain to insecticide selection. among go terms representing genes over transcribed in insecticide-selected strains, terms related to cuticle proteins were strongly enriched in the imida-r strain. terms related to oxygen transport or to hexamerins were enriched in both the perm-r and imida-r strains, together with those related to iron homeostasis and iron binding. among go terms represented by under transcribed genes, multiple terms related to immune response were enriched in insecticide-selected strains. when considering transcripts affected by differential snps, no go term was enriched in the imida-r strain while only ‘dehydrogenase activity’ was enriched in the propo-r strain. in contrast, the perm-r strain revealed an enrichment of all terms related to cytochrome p450s such as ‘monooxygenases activity', ‘electron carrier activity', ‘tetrapyrrole binding', ‘heme binding’ and ‘iron ion binding’. terms related to hexamerins were also enriched in perm-r together with terms related to various enzyme families.

focus on transcripts potentially involved in insecticide detoxification
focusing on cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases  revealed that few cyps showed significant transcription level variations, with none being over transcribed in the perm-r strain and only four cyps  being over transcribed in the imida-r and propo-r strains. four cyps were under transcribed in the perm-r strain . this cyp12f was also under transcribed in the two other strains. when considering differential snps, the perm-r strain carried a much higher number of differential snps affecting p450s as compared to other strains. the  <dig> cyp genes specifically affected by permethrin selection included  <dig> cyp6s belonging to a dense p <dig> cluster located on supercontig  <dig>  composed of six cyp6ns, five cyp6ms, four cyp6zs, cyp6s <dig> and cyp6y <dig> . in contrast, only  <dig> and  <dig> cyps were affected by differential snps in the imida-r and propo-r strains respectively. several cyps were affected by variations predicted as non-synonymous  while  <dig> variations affecting  <dig> genes where located within substrate recognition site regions , potentially affecting the active site of these p450s.

when considering other transcripts potentially involved in resistance , the strong response of the imida-r strain to insecticide selection through transcription level modifications was confirmed, with several detoxification enzymes being over expressed including the glutathione s-transferase gstd <dig>  one glycosyltransferase together with multiple oxidases, peroxidases and dehydrogenases. several kinases were also specifically over-transcribed in the imida-r strain. fewer transcripts were affected in the perm-r and propo-r strains, including one aldo-keto reductase, one glycosyltransferase, one aldehyde oxidase and one alcohol dehydrogenase. as opposed to cyp genes, differential snps affecting other detoxification genes were well-balanced between strains with  <dig> variations affecting  <dig> distinct genes. among them, ten variations were predicted as non-synonymous. in the perm-r strain, ten genes were specifically affected, including two short-chain dehydrogenases, two heme peroxidases, two prophenoloxydases, one alcohol dehydrogenase, the glutathione s-transferase gste <dig> and one abc transporter. ten variations affecting seven genes including the gstd <dig>  three glycosyltransferases, one aldehyde oxidase, one abc transporter and one oxidase/peroxidase were specific to the imida-r strain. finally,  <dig> variations affecting seven genes including the gstd <dig>  one glycosyltransferase, one heme peroxidase, one carboxylesterase, two abc transporters and one oxidase/peroxidase were specific to the propo-r strain.

discussion
characterizing resistance mechanisms is essential for improving resistance management. although target site modifications play a major role in resistance  <cit> , other mechanisms such as insecticide biodegradation, altered transport, sequestration and modification of the insect cuticle also account for a significant part of resistance  <cit> . however, the intricacy of these mechanisms makes challenging the identification of candidate genes for functional validation  <cit> . gene expression microarrays are mostly used for identifying genes differentially transcribed in resistant populations but suffer from technical biases  <cit> . in contrast rna-seq generates transcription data with a higher resolution, better dynamic range and lower technical variation  <cit> . in addition, rna-seq produces polymorphism data and useful information to re-annotate gene models  <cit> . despite recent studies pointing out the role of polymorphism variations in insecticide resistance  <cit> , such aspect has never been investigated at the transcriptome level in mosquitoes. indeed, the only study using rna-seq to investigate insecticide resistance in mosquitoes did not consider polymorphism variations  <cit> . in this regard, the present study represents the first attempt to use rna-seq for examining concomitantly quantitative and qualitative transcriptome changes associated with resistance to different insecticides in mosquitoes.

insecticide selection and resistance levels
after  <dig> generations of selection, bioassays revealed a constitutive increased resistance of each selected strain to its respective insecticide compared to the susceptible parental strain. although resistance levels were low as compared to what can be observed in natura, they were significant regarding the few generations of selection, the full susceptibility of the parental strain and the absence of target-site resistance alleles. the rapid rise of resistance suggests that alleles conferring a better fitness in presence of insecticides are already present in susceptible populations and can be promptly selected under a constant selection pressure. although laboratory selection does not fully mimic adaptive processes occurring in natura , selecting all resistant strains from a single susceptible strain allowed minimizing variations related to different genetic backgrounds. using a fully susceptible parental strain also allowed focusing on non-target site resistance mechanisms .

rna-seq as a tool for studying insecticide resistance in mosquitoes
a total of  <dig> million cdna reads were sequenced across all samples and 80% of them were successfully mapped to ae. aegypti reference genome. such mapping efficiency appeared acceptable considering polymorphism variations occurring between the reference genome  and the parental strain used in our study . the high correlation of expression data obtained from cdna library replicates confirmed the robustness of cdna library construction and sequencing procedures. by applying high-stringency sequence quality and transcript coverage filtering, high fidelity transcription data were recovered for more than  <dig> transcripts. such detection level was comparable to those obtained with dna microarrays at the same life stage  <cit> . more than  <dig> differential snps linked to insecticide selection were identified. although our experimental design did not control for stochastic effects  and the presence of false positives is likely, transcripts affected by these differential snps represent strong candidates for further functional validation studies. little overlap was found between transcripts differentially transcribed in selected strains and those affected by differential snps. this was expected as rna-seq data are restricted to transcripts and did not cover regulatory regions often located outside transcript boundaries. challenging reads distribution with genome annotation identified >  <dig> transcripts incorrectly annotated with most of them showing wrong utr boundaries or modification of exon/intron structure. in addition, more than  <dig> lonely genomic regions showing high transcription signals and realistic exon/intron structures were identified. further analyses are now required for assigning them to new exons of known transcripts, novel transcripts, pseudogenes or non-coding rnas.

transcriptome changes associated with insecticide selection
overall, our study revealed diverse response patterns depending on the insecticide used for selection. the imida-r strain selected with the neonicotinoid imidacloprid showed the highest resistance level together with the strongest differential transcription response with numerous genes being over transcribed. in contrast, the perm-r strain selected with the pyrethroid permethrin revealed a moderate differential transcription response but a lot of polymorphism variations following insecticide selection. the propo-r strain selected with the carbamate propoxur showed an intermediate pattern. these dissimilar quantitative and qualitative transcriptome changes may reflect different adaptive strategies driven by costs and benefits associated with resistance mechanisms to each insecticide.

insecticide resistance and immunity
multiple transcripts related to immune response were affected by insecticide selection with several of them under transcribed in all resistant strains  and others affected by differential snps . mosquito humoral response is involved in their capacity to host and transmit viruses  <cit>  or parasites  <cit> . as mentioned in alout et al.  <cit> , our results support an association between insecticide resistance and the capacity of mosquitoes to host and transmit pathogens, which may affect the control of mosquito-borne diseases  <cit> .

altered insecticide transport and sequestration
multiple transcripts encoding cuticular proteins were over transcribed in the imida-r strain while most of them were under transcribed in the perm-r strain and not affected in the propo-r strain. such strong effect in the imida-r strain was not associated to changes in the polymorphism of these transcripts, suggesting that insecticide selection is affecting their regulation rather than their conformation. cuticle plays a crucial role in protecting insects from their environment. the vast majority of chemical insecticides are active by contact and changes in cuticle thickness or conformation have been suggested to contribute to resistance in mosquitoes  <cit> . our data support previous studies suggesting a significant role of cuticle in the adaptation to neonicotinoid insecticides  <cit> . the role of cuticle in response to imidacloprid selection was supported by the specific over transcription of the multi-copper oxidase aael <dig> in the imida-r strain as its an. gambiae orthologue is involved in cuticle and egg shell tanning  <cit> . numerous protein families are involved in cuticle biosynthesis and homeostasis including enzymes, transporters and transcription factors and further studies are now required for pinpointing those controlling cuticular resistance in mosquitoes.

several kinases were specifically over-transcribed in the imida-r strain. kinases are involved in multiple regulatory mechanisms and their involvement in the response of insects to insecticides is likely. indeed, recent studies showed that the phosphorylation state of acetylcholine nicotinic receptors can modulate the efficacy of neonicotinoid insecticides  <cit> .

five transcripts encoding hexamerins were strongly over transcribed in the perm-r strain and in a lesser extend in other resistant strains. these transcripts, located on different supercontigs, were also affected by differential snps suggesting a selection imprint on these proteins. insect hexamerins may be involved in hormone transport, energy and amino acid storage, cuticle biosynthesis and immune defense  <cit> . hexamerins of the lepidopteran heliothis zea have been shown to bind insecticides, suggesting a direct role in resistance by sequestration or altered transport  <cit> . deciphering if hexamerins are impacted by insecticide selection because of their ability to bind insecticides, their interaction with cuticle homeostasis or their role in resources re-allocation associated to fitness costs remains unclear.

finally, atp-binding cassette transporters  can play a role in adaptation to xenobiotics  <cit>  and have been associated to insecticide resistance in mosquitoes  <cit> . in our study, the response of abc transporters to insecticide selection was marginal. indeed, only one abc transporter  was found differentially transcribed in response to insecticide selection and this gene was down regulated in all resistant strains. four others were affected by differential snps but their allele frequency variations in resistance strains were low.

insecticide biodegradation
detoxification enzymes play a major role in insecticide resistance  <cit> . as expected, these enzymes were well represented in our data set but showed distinct patterns depending on the nature of the insecticide used for selection.

response to selection with the neonicotinoid imidacloprid  was characterized by the over transcription of multiple p450s, oxidases, transferases and one alcohol dehydrogenase, supporting the involvement of multiple enzymes in imidacloprid biodegradation pathways. among them, the p <dig> cyp6bb <dig> was recently pointed out as a solid candidate for imidacloprid metabolism based on gene expression data and substrate binding predictions  <cit> . the aldehyde oxidase aael <dig> was over transcribed and affected by polymorphism variations in the imida-r strain. a recent study confirmed that aldehyde oxidases can contribute to neonicotinoid metabolism through nitro-reduction  <cit> .

several p450s over transcribed in the imida-r strain were also found over transcribed in response to propoxur selection. cross resistance between these two insecticides was identified  <cit>  and the potency of particular p450s to confer resistance to multiple insecticides has been shown. for example, an. gambiae cyp6z <dig> metabolizes the organochlorine ddt and the carbamate carbaryl  <cit>  while cyp6m <dig> metabolizes both ddt and pyrethroids  <cit> .

metabolic resistance of mosquitoes to pyrethroids has been mainly associated with an over expression of p450s able to metabolize them. among the multiple candidates identified by microarray screenings, an. gambiae cyp6m <dig> and cyp6p <dig>  an. funestus cyp6p <dig>  ae. aegypti cyp9j <dig>  cyp9j <dig>  cyp9j <dig>  and cx quinquefasciatus cyp6m <dig> and cyp4h <dig> have been validated as pyrethroid metabolizers . cyp6zs and cyp6ms have also been associated with pyrethroid resistance by qtl in an. funestus where resistance mainly relies on metabolic mechanisms  <cit> . recently, the central role of mosquito cyp6zs in pyrethroid degradation pathway was revealed  <cit> . in the present study few p450s were found over transcribed in the perm-r strain. among them, cyp6bb <dig> was also found strongly over transcribed in pyrethroid resistant populations from cuba and cayman islands  <cit> . unexpectedly, known ae. aegypti pyrethroid metabolizers or paralogs of those validated from other mosquito species were not found over transcribed in the perm-r strain. however, a strong selection imprint was detected in the perm-r strain in a p <dig> cluster in supercontig  <dig> containing strong candidates cyp6ms, cyp6ns and cyp6zs, suggesting that the selection of particular p <dig> variants can contribute to pyrethroid resistance. in mammals, it is well known that p <dig> variants can display different substrate specificity  <cit> . to date, such variations have been neglected in mosquitoes with only few studies pointing out p <dig> alleles associated with insecticide resistance  <cit> . finally, the strong selection imprint observed in these p450s might explain their unexpected under transcription in the perm-r strain. indeed, the apparent under expression of transcripts affected by differential snps might be the consequence of a mapping bias due to a higher divergence from the reference genome or an enrichment in low-expressed alleles  <cit> . although further analyses are required for investigating the role of allele-specific expression in resistance, our data supports the selection of particular detoxification enzyme variants by insecticides.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study primarily aimed at assessing the usefulness of rna-seq to investigate insecticide resistance mechanisms in mosquitoes. results confirmed that this technique produces high-quality gene expression data together with solid polymorphism data. distinct responses to selection with insecticides from different chemical families were observed with a balance between gene expression and polymorphism variations. polymorphism variations of p <dig> enzymes were strongly linked to pyrethroid selection. although additional analyses are required to validate variants linked to resistance, such finding highlights the necessity to consider both gene expression and polymorphism variations for identifying candidate genes potentially involved in insecticide resistance. as sequencing costs are decreasing and new sequencing strategies and bioinformatics pipelines are developed, obtaining gene expression and polymorphism data from the same samples using high-throughput sequencing should now be considered as a valuable alternative to microarrays.
