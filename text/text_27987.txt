BACKGROUND
plants respond to pathogen infection using their innate immunity system, which includes two layers, pathogen/microbe-associated molecular pattern -triggered immunity  and effector-triggered immunity   <cit> . pti, also known as the plant basal defense, is mediated by plant pattern recognition receptors  through recognizing the conserved microbial features pamps/mamps  <cit> . compared to eti, pti mediates a relatively weaker immune response with broad-spectrum defense against pathogens. there are some typical downstream responses in this pathway, including the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases , rapid production of reactive oxygen species  and the induction of pathogenesis-related  genes  <cit> . when pathogens develop specific effectors to suppress pti, plants evolve corresponding resistance proteins to recognize these effectors and lead to eti, a much more rapid and robust immune response  <cit> . besides the signaling process present in pti, hypersensitive response , a form of localized programmed cell death  at the infection sites of plant to prevent the spread of pathogens, is usually accompanied with eti  <cit> . some plant mutants develop spontaneous cell death lesions similar to hr cell death in the absence of pathogen infection and such mutants are called lesion mimic mutants  <cit> . there are a lot of overlaps in the signal pathways of lesion mimic pcd and plant innate immunity, suggesting the existence of signaling crosstalk between them  <cit> .

protein degradation mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system  plays critical roles in plant immunity. ups is used for selectively degrading proteins through a process of polyubiquitination in eukaryotic organisms. ubiquitination of a target protein is carried out by attaching ubiquitin molecules to the target through a sequential action of ubiquitin-activating enzyme , ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme  and ubiquitin protein ligase . the protein conjugated with a poly-ubiquitin chain is then targeted to the 26s proteasome for degradation  <cit> . among the ups components, e <dig> ligases are the most diverse members as they determine the substrate specificity  <cit> . e <dig> ligases can be classified into different groups based on the presence of specific hect, ring, or u-box domains  <cit> . the u-box domain is a modified ring domain consisting of ~ <dig> conserved amino acids  <cit> . in both rice  and arabidopsis thaliana, the largest group of predicted plant u-box proteins  contains varying repeats of c-terminal armadillo  motif which are involved in the protein-protein interactions  <cit> . many plant u-box/arm repeat proteins have been identified as active e <dig> ligases with important roles in diverse biological processes, such as self-incompatibility  <cit> , plant hormone responses  <cit> , abiotic stresses  <cit> , flowering time  <cit> , plant cell death and defense responses  <cit> .

rice blast disease, caused by the fungus of magnaporthe oryzae , is one of the most destructive diseases of rice worldwide  <cit> . to date, more than two dozens of rice blast resistance genes have been cloned and characterized, but the immediate downstream signaling events mediated by these resistance genes are largely unknown. the rice blast resistance gene pid <dig> encodes a transmembrane b-lectin receptor-like kinase  <cit> . to identify the interaction partners of pid <dig>  we formerly used the intracellular kinase domain of pid <dig> as bait to screen a rice cdna library via yeast two-hybrid approach and obtained some binding proteins  <cit> . among them, a protein encoded by loc_os08g <dig> was previously reported as a u-box/arm repeat protein called ospub <dig>  <cit> .

here, we report that ospub <dig> is able to interact directly with the kinase domain of pid <dig> in vitro and in vivo. our study also reveals that ospub <dig> could be phosphorylated by pid2k in an arm-dependent manner and the phosphorylated ospub <dig> exhibits e <dig> ligase activity. furthermore, overexpression of ospub <dig> in rice leads to a spontaneous cell death phenotype and a constitutive activation of plant basal defense response. these findings demonstrate that ospub <dig> plays critical roles in plant cell death and innate immunity.

RESULTS
ospub <dig> is a u-box/arm repeat protein
the previous study identified ospub <dig> as one of the pid2k-interacting proteins through yeast two-hybrid screening  <cit> . according to the rice genome annotation database , ospub <dig> is annotated as a putative arm  repeat family protein composed of  <dig> amino acids with a molecular mass of approximate  <dig> kd. the smart  database shows that ospub <dig> contains a conserved u-box domain spanning the amino acid residues  <dig> to  <dig> and five tandem repeats of arm motifs in its c terminus . phylogenetic analysis on the arm repeat-containing pubs revealed that ospub <dig> was most closely related to ntpub <dig>  and atpub <dig> . ntpub <dig> was reported to interact directly with the receptor-like kinase chrk <dig> and it was predicted to be involved in modulating the plant developmental signaling pathway mediated by chrk <dig>  <cit> . atpub <dig> was identified to influence male fertility through impacting growth and degeneration of tapetal cells of arabidopsis  <cit> . in rice, ospub <dig> was grouped into cluster i of the rice u-box/arm repeat protein subfamily  <cit>  and it was found to share the highest sequence similarity  with ospub <dig>  an uncharacterized pid2k-interacting protein  <cit> .figure  <dig>

the arm repeat domain of ospub <dig> is required for directly interacting with pid2k
to confirm the interaction between ospub <dig> and pid2k detected from the yeast-two-hybrid system, we performed in vitro pull down assays. for these assays, pid2k was expressed in frame with glutathione s transferase  in yeast and ospub <dig> was expressed as a his-tagged fusion protein in escherichia coli , respectively. the expressed gst-pid2k was then purified with glutathione sepharose 4b beads and incubated with the purified his-ospub <dig>  following extensive washings, the proteins bound to the beads were separated by sds-page and immunoblotted with anti-ospub <dig> and anti-gst antibodies, respectively. we found that the anti-ospub <dig> antibody was able to specifically detect a clear band about  <dig> kd as the size of ospub <dig> from the components pulled down by gst-pid2k  whereas no band was detected from those pulled down by gst alone . this result reveals that ospub <dig> is able to interact with pid2k directly, which is consistent with the result obtained from yeast-two-hybrid.figure  <dig>

in vitro binding analysis of ospub <dig> and its truncated variants to the pid <dig> kinase domain. the purified his-fusion proteins were separately mixed with equal quantities of resin bound gst-pid2k and then pulled down by the resin. after extensive washings, the pull-down products were immunoblotted with anti-ospub <dig>  or anti-gst  antibody. one-tenth of the input of purified his fusions, his-ospub <dig> , his-ospub15c  and his-ospub15n , were loaded as controls.  subcellular localization of ospub <dig> and pid2k, respectively. rice protoplasts were co-transformed with the nuclear marker mcherry-vird2nls  accompanied with gfp alone  or gfp fused proteins  driven by 35s promoter, respectively. the panels from left to right are confocal micrographs of gfp signal , mcherry signal , bright-field images and the resultant overlaid images, respectively. bars =  <dig> μm.  bifc analysis of in vivo interaction between pid2k and ospub <dig> or its variants. pid2k and the ospub <dig> variants were respectively fused to the inactive n-terminal  or the c-terminal  part of eyfp, and the pairs of indicated recombinant proteins were transiently expressed in rice protoplasts along with mcherry-vird2nls , a nuclear marker. the fluorescence signals were monitored by confocal microscopy. the panel shows fluorescence images of the eyfp signal , the mcherry signal , the bright-field illumination of protoplasts and the overlaid images, respectively. bars =  <dig> μm. the above experiments were repeated three times with similar results.



in order to determine the fragment of ospub <dig> which is essential for its interaction with pid2k, two ospub <dig> variants, ospub15c  and ospub15n  were separately expressed as his-fused proteins and the purified his-ospub15c and his-ospub15n were respectively introduced into gst pull-down assays. we found that the anti-ospub <dig> antibody was able to detect a positive band from the pulled down components of gst-pid2k post incubation with his-ospub15c  rather than with his-ospub15n , whereas no band was detected from the pulled down components of gst post incubation with his-ospub15c or his-ospub15n . these results suggest that the c-terminal fragment containing the entire arm repeat domain of ospub <dig> is essential and sufficient for the interaction between ospub <dig> and pid2k.

to further verify the interaction between ospub <dig> and pid2k, we performed bimolecular fluorescence complementation  assays. before this analysis, we firstly determined the subcellular localization of ospub <dig> and pid2k, individually. we fused the coding region of ospub <dig> and pid2k to the n-terminus of green fluorescent protein , respectively, to produce the ospub15-gfp and pid2k-gfp fusion proteins. each of these fusion proteins under the control of camv 35s promoter was co-expressed with the nuclear marker mcherry-vird2nls in rice protoplasts, respectively. we found that the fluorescence signals were present at cytosol when the protoplast cells were transformed with ospub15-gfp, whereas the fluorescence signals were present at cytosol and nucleus when the protoplast cells were transformed with pid2k-gfp . these results suggest that ospub <dig> is located in cytosol while pid2k, the separated intracellular part of pid <dig>  distributes in both the nucleus and the cytosol of rice cells.

to further determine the domain required for ospub <dig> to interact with pid2k in vivo, we created another variant called ospub15n- <dig> , which is longer than ospub15n, and applied it to the following bifc assays. pid2k and the variants of ospub <dig> were respectively fused to the split n-terminal  and c-terminal  fragments of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein  to generate the constructs, pid2k-neyfp, ospub15-ceyfp, ospub15c-ceyfp and ospub15n-1-ceyfp. the pairs, pid2k-neyfp/ospub15-ceyfp, pid2k-neyfp/ospub15c-ceyfp and pid2k-neyfp/ospub15n-1-ceyfp, were respectively co-transformed with mcherry-vird2nls into rice protoplasts. we detected the fluorescence signals in cytosol when the pair of pid2k-neyfp/ospub15-ceyfp was co-transformed into protoplasts , suggesting that ospub <dig> did interact with pid2k. this result is consistent with the cytosolic co-localization of both pid2k and ospub <dig> . moreover, the fluorescence signals were also appeared in the cytosol of the protoplasts transformed with pid2k-neyfp/ospub15c-ceyfp, but not in the protoplasts transformed with pid2k-neyfp/ospub15n-1-ceyfp , suggesting that the variant, ospub15c but not ospub15n- <dig> interacts with pid2k. together with the sequences and structures of ospub15c and ospub15n- <dig> , these results also suggest that the arm domain of ospub <dig> is essential for the interaction of ospub <dig> with pid2k in vivo.

ospub <dig> is transphosphorylated by pid2k in an arm-dependent manner
since pid2k is the putative kinase domain of pid <dig>  <cit> , we were interested in determining whether pid2k really possessed kinase activity. for this purpose, we performed in vitro phosphorylation assay on the purified protein gst-pid2k and found that the pid2k was capable of autophosphorylation . this result suggests that pid <dig> is an active kinase. as ospub <dig> could interact with pid2k directly, we wondered whether pid2k was capable of phosphorylating ospub <dig>  we then performed a similar kinase activity analysis on gst-pid2k co-incubated with the purified his-ospub <dig>  we found that not only gst-pid2k but also his-ospub <dig> was phosphorylated, whereas, his-ospub <dig> was not phosphorylated when it was incubated in the absence of gst-pid2k . our results indicate that pid2k is able to transphosphorylate ospub <dig> and thus ospub <dig> is a substrate of the active kinase pid2k.figure  <dig> 
the arm repeat domain is required for ospub <dig> to be phosphorylated by pid2k.
in vitro phosphorylation analysis of ospub <dig> , ospub15n , ospub15c- <dig>  or ospub15c- <dig>  by the kinase domain of pid <dig>  the purified his fusion proteins were incubated with purified gst-pid2k in the presence of  atp. gst-pid2k was used as a positive control. samples were separated with sds-page followed by coommassie brilliant blue staining  and autoradiography , respectively. similar results were obtained from three independent experiments.



to examine whether the phosphorylation sites of ospub <dig> are in the arm repeat domain as it is responsible for interacting with pid2k, we conducted additional phosphorylation assays using the ospub <dig> variants as substrates. to avoid the potential confusion likely caused by the same molecular weight  of his-ospub15c and gst-pid2k, his-ospub15c- <dig> , with different molecular weight, was created and used in the assays. we found that his-ospub15c- <dig> could be efficiently phosphorylated by gst-pid2k , whereas his-ospub15n was not . furthermore, we also found that the variant ospub15c- <dig>  containing only four arm motifs was sufficient for ospub <dig> to be phosphorylated by pid2k . these results suggest that the pid2k-phosphorylated residues are mainly distributed in the arm repeat domain of ospub <dig> 

phosphorylation is required for ospub <dig> to exhibit its e <dig> ligase activity
as u-box proteins usually possess e <dig> ubiquitin ligase activity  <cit> , we presumed that ospub <dig> might function as an e <dig> ligase. to test this hypothesis, we performed in vitro self-ubiquitination assay on bacterially expressed his-ospub <dig>  however, no e <dig> ligase activity was detected for the purified his-ospub <dig> in the presence of wheat e <dig>  human e <dig>  and his-tagged ubiquitin as well as in the reactions lacking of e <dig>  e <dig> or his-ospub <dig>  while the positive control sdir <dig> showed strong self-ubiquitination activity evidenced by detection of high-molecular-weight bands with an antibody to ubiquitin . we then performed additional ubiqutination assays on the purified his-ospub <dig> using ten different arabidopsis e2s, ats <dig>  ats <dig>  ats <dig>  ats <dig>  ats <dig>  ats <dig>  ats <dig>  ats <dig>  ubc <dig> and ubc <dig>  respectively, and found that his-ospub <dig> did not show any detectable e <dig> ligase activity when incubated with any of these e2s .

considering that post translational modification might be required for the e <dig> ligase activity of ospub <dig>  we pre-incubated the purified his-ospub <dig> with the total protein extracts of rice and used such pre-incubated his-ospub <dig> for the in vitro ubiquitination assay. the result showed that such pre-treated his-ospub <dig> displayed e <dig> ligase activity in the presence of e <dig>  e <dig>  and ubiquitin . by contrast, no protein ubiquitination was detected on untreated his-ospub <dig>  as well as in the reactions lacking of e <dig>  e <dig>  or his-ospub <dig> . these findings suggest that post translational modification is essential for ospub <dig> to exhibit its e <dig> ligase activity.figure  <dig> 
the pre-treated ospub <dig> possesses e <dig> ligase activity.  e <dig> ligase activity analysis of pre-incubated his-ospub <dig>  the purified his-ospub <dig> was incubated with total protein extracts of rice for one hour, and then was put into self-ubiquitination assays in the presence of wheat e <dig>  human e <dig>  and 6xhis tag ubiquitin  or in the absence of e <dig>  e <dig> or his-ospub <dig> . as a control, the un-pre-incubated his-ospub <dig> was included in the assays . after the reactions, samples were separated by 12% sds-page and immunoblotted with anti-ub  or anti-ospub <dig>  antibody.  e <dig> ligase activity analysis of pid2k-phosphorylated his-ospub <dig>  the untreated his-ospub <dig>  and the pid2k-phosphorylated his-ospub <dig>  were assayed for ubiquitination activity, respectively. the reaction products were immunoblotted with anti-ub  or anti-ospub <dig>  antibody. these experiments were repeated three times with similar results obtained.



as ospub <dig> could be phosphorylated by pid2k, it was attractive for us to figure out whether the phosphorylation modification was required for ospub <dig> to be an active e <dig> ligase. for this purpose, we carried out self-ubiquitination assay on the his-ospub <dig> pre-phosphorylated by gst-pid2k. as expected, the results showed that the phosphorylated form of his-ospub <dig> indeed exhibited ubiquitination activity in the presence of e <dig>  e <dig>  and ubiquitin , whereas no ubiquitination activity was detected on unphosphorylated his-ospub <dig> or in the reactions lacking of e <dig>  e <dig>  or his-ospub <dig> . these results suggest that the phosphorylation modification by pid2k is required for ospub <dig> to release its e <dig> ligase activity.

ospub <dig> is constitutively expressed in rice plants
to reveal the expression profile of ospub <dig>  we performed northern analysis on the rna samples prepared from diverse tissues, including root, stem, leaf, young panicle and mature panicle of the two rice cultivars, taipei <dig>  and digu, using the cdna of ospub <dig> as the probe. the result shows that ospub <dig> is ubiquitously expressed in the tested tissues of both rice cultivars, with relatively higher expression level in the leaf of tp <dig> and in the leaf, young panicle and mature panicle of digu as well .figure  <dig>

because pid <dig> confers resistance to m. oryzae isolate zb <dig>  <cit>  and ospub <dig> physically interacts with pid2k, we wondered whether the expression of ospub <dig> was affected by inoculation with zb <dig>  to address this question, we carried out quantitative real-time pcr  analysis to examine the expression level of ospub <dig> in the resistant rice cultivar digu and the susceptible cultivar tp <dig>  respectively, post inoculation with zb <dig>  we found no obvious changes in the expression level of ospub <dig> in both rice cultivars, which were well but differently responsive to the inoculation as expected . this is consistent with the previous result that the expression level of pid <dig> was not affected by inoculation with zb <dig> either in susceptible or resistant rice varieties  <cit> .

overexpression of ospub <dig> leads to plant cell death accompanied with excessive accumulation of ros
to investigate the biological function of ospub <dig> in rice, we subcloned the coding region of ospub <dig> into the binary vector ptck <dig> under the control of maize ubiquitin promoter to generate the ospub <dig> overexpression construct . we then introduced the construct and the empty vector into the calli derived from tp <dig>  respectively, by agrobacterium-mediated transformation. we obtained more than  <dig> independent transgenic plants over-expressing ospub <dig>  in total. a few days after the regenerated transgenic rice plants produced, some brown lesions appeared spontaneously on the early-emerged old leaves of all the ospub15ox plants and the lesions spread over the whole seedlings quickly resulting in plants death within one month even under sterile conditions. by contrast, no morphological abnormalities were observed on the control transgenic plants expressing the empty vector . quantitative rt-pcr analysis showed that the expression of ospub <dig> in randomly selected ospub15ox rice lines were up-regulated compared with that in control plants . these results indicate that overexpression of ospub <dig> leads to rice plants death as a result of uncontrolled propagation of spontaneous lesions.figure  <dig>

to explore the biochemical mechanisms underlying the development of aggressive lesions in ospub15ox seedlings, we evaluated the expression of several histochemical markers in ospub15ox plants and control transgenic plants. when stained with trypan blue, an indicator of irreversible membrane damage or cell death, cells at the lesion sites of ospub15ox leaves exhibited deep blue in color whereas the cells in the leaves of control transgenic plants did not . moreover, the dab  and nbt  staining analyses revealed that the accumulation of reactive oxygen species , such as h2o <dig> and o2−, were closely correlated with lesion formation in ospub15ox leaves. on the contrary, no ros production was detected in leaves of the control transgenic plants . these results reveal that the development of cell death in ospub15ox plants is likely resulted from excessive accumulation of ros.

overexpression of ospub <dig> activates rice defense responses constitutively
in most cases, the presence of lesion mimic cell death in plant is correlated with elevated expression of pathogen-related  genes and enhanced resistance to pathogens  <cit> . thus, we measured the transcript levels of four pr genes, pr1a, pr1b, pr <dig> and pbz <dig>  by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  analysis. we found that the expression of all these genes were up regulated in the ospub15ox plants both before and after lesion appearance .

to test whether over-expression of ospub <dig> enhances plant resistance to blast disease, we inoculated the ospub15ox plants and the control plants with seven m. oryzae isolates, zhong-10-8- <dig>  zb <dig>  zb <dig>  ch <dig>  99-26- <dig>  99-26- <dig> and 97-27- <dig>  respectively. we found that, compared to the control transgenic plants, the ospub15ox plants confer enhanced resistance to all of the tested blast isolates . taken together, these findings suggest that overexpression of ospub <dig> constitutively activates the basal defense responses against diverse isolates of m. oryzae in rice.

discussion
rice blast, caused by the most devastating rice pathogen, is a severe threat to global rice production  <cit> . more than  <dig> rice blast resistance genes have been cloned in the past years. however, only a few rice blast resistance genes, such as pita, pb <dig> and pit, have been well studied with the immediate downstream components identified  <cit> . in this study, we characterized the rice u-box/arm repeat protein ospub <dig>  an interacting component of rice blast resistance protein pid <dig>  we found that the kinase domain of pid <dig> was able to interact directly with and transphosphorylate ospub <dig>  we also found that the phosphorylation by pid2k was required for ospub <dig> to function as an active e <dig> ligase under our experimental conditions. moreover, the fact that the ospub15ox plants exhibited spontaneous cell death phenotype and conferred enhanced basal defense suggest that ospub <dig> regulates plant pcd and innate immunity.

ospub <dig> is a key factor involved in plant cell death and defense responses
plant u-box/arm repeat proteins have been studied extensively in connection with plant defense responses and cell death. spl <dig> was the first characterized pub e <dig> ligase involved in cell death and defense in rice. the spl <dig> mutant developed spontaneous cell death in leaves and conferred enhanced resistance to multiple fungal and bacterial pathogens, suggesting that spl <dig> might serve as a negative regulator of plant pcd and pathogenic defense  <cit> . as the closest arabidopsis ortholog of rice spl <dig>  the atpub <dig> was also found to be involved in the regulation of cell death and plant defense  <cit> . the u-box e <dig> ligases cmpg <dig> and acre <dig> were characterized as positive regulators of hypersensitive response in tobacco  <cit> . in addition, the arabidopsis pub17-knockout mutants conferred compromised resistance to avirulent pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato  <cit> . on the contrary, the arabidopsis triple mutant pub22/pub23/pub <dig> was reported to display enhanced resistance to diverse pathogens, accompanied with oxidative burst and plant cell death  <cit> . moreover, it is reported that the homozygous pub44/pub <dig> mutant exhibited a seedling lethal phenotype resulting from widespread cell death lesions  <cit> .

we investigated the biological function of ospub <dig> using transgenic approach. the plants over-expressing ospub <dig> exhibited cell death phenotype and conferred enhanced resistance to many m. oryzae isolates . interestingly, the excessive accumulation of ros was observed in the lesion leaves of the ospub15ox plants . it is likely that the high level of ros in transgenic plants induces the abnormal phenotype and increases the resistance to pathogens, as rapid generation of ros is a well-known process involved in plant pcd and innate immunity  <cit> . however, we failed to obtain transgenic rice lines with significantly decreased expression of ospub <dig> by trying to introduce two ospub15-rnai constructs  individually into pid <dig> rice calli or tp <dig> calli, respectively. it is likely that the potential regenerated plant or positive rice calli with drastically reduced expression of ospub <dig>  could not survive. this explanation is also supported by the findings that the homozygous t-dna insertion mutant of ospub <dig> in the rice variety dongjin exhibits a seedling lethal phenotype  <cit> . interestingly, the ros accumulation and its impact on plant cell death were also found in the ospub15-knockout mutants  <cit> . collectively, these results indicate that both up- and down- regulated expression of ospub <dig> is able to induce accumulation of ros and ultimately leading rice plants to death at seedling stage. thus, we believe that the steady-state expression of ospub <dig> is essential for plant survival and normal development. additionally, ospub <dig> is also involved in the responses against abiotic stresses as the expression of ospub <dig> was up-regulated upon salt or drought stresses . taken together, our study reveals that ospub <dig> works as a key regulator for various ros-related signaling pathways, including plant innate immunity, pcd and abiotic stresses.

ospub <dig> is a substrate of the receptor-like kinase pid2
the rice u-box/arm repeat protein ospub <dig> was previously isolated as one of the pid2k-interacting proteins through a yeast two-hybrid screening strategy  <cit> . by using the gst pull-down and bifc approaches, we confirmed the interaction between ospub <dig> and pid2k in vitro and in vivo . furthermore, we found that the arm repeat domain of ospub <dig> is essential for such interaction , which is well consistent with the defined protein-protein interaction function of this domain  <cit> .

the previous study has shown that pid <dig> is a transmembrane receptor-like kinase  containing a putative intracellular serine/threonine kinase domain  <cit> . many rlks with such cytosolic kinase domains, such as xa <dig>  <cit> , osserk <dig>  <cit> , bri <dig>  <cit> , bak <dig>  <cit> , efr  <cit>  and fls <dig>  <cit> , have been reported to possess kinase activity. similarly, our present work reveals that pid2k is an active kinase . moreover, we also found that pid2k is able to transphosphorylate ospub <dig> in vitro . the results that pid2k interacts directly with and transphosphorylates ospub <dig> support the notion that ospub <dig> is a substrate of pid <dig> 

e <dig> ligase activity of ospub <dig> relies on its phosphorylation
as is known, whether the e <dig> ligase activity of a protein could be successfully detected in vitro relies on the specific e <dig> enzyme used for the ubiquitination assay. for example, the polyubiquitination of the e <dig> ligase ospub <dig> could be detected in the presence of the arabidopsis e <dig> enzyme atubc <dig> or atubc <dig> rather than atubc <dig>  <cit> . moreover, the u-box/ring proteins h-goliath and avrptob were able to exhibit strong ubiquitination activity when respectively incubated with the human e <dig> ubch5c whereas they failed to display detectable ubiquitination activity when incubated with ubch5b  <cit> . in addition, park et al. found that out of the four e2s used , only ubch5c  is effective in testing the e <dig> ligase activity of ospub <dig>  <cit> . unfortunately, ubch5c is not available for the ospub <dig> ubiquitination assay in our study. it seems that such e <dig> preference in ubiquitination assay may explain why we failed to detect the e <dig> ligase activity of bacterially expressed ospub <dig> even though a total of  <dig> e2s were used. interestingly, after pre-incubating the bacterially expressed ospub <dig> with total protein extracts of rice or pre-phosphorylated by pid2k , we successfully detected the e <dig> ligase activity of ospub <dig>  our results suggest that the e <dig> ligase activity of ospub <dig> depends on its phosphorylation under our experimental conditions. in addition, we believe that the pre-incubation strategy used in this study would be adaptable to other prokaryotically expressed plant proteins for their in-vitro ubiquitination assays, especially when the most suitable e2s are not available or the post-translational modification is required.

the mechanism for ospub <dig> to regulate plant cell death and defense responses
in this study, we extensively characterized the interaction between pid2k and ospub <dig> . we also found that pid2k is able to form homo-dimers in rice protoplast cells . however, unlike pid2k, which lacks of the transmembrane and extra-cellular domain, the full-length pid <dig>  is not able to form homo-dimers or interact with either ospub <dig> or ospub15c . this indicates that the binding ability of pid2k with its partners is abolished in the native status of fl-pid <dig>  we deduced that the binding sites of the native protein fl-pid <dig> in its kinase domain might not be well exposed and binding with a specific ligand  would be required for its conformational change enabling pid <dig> to homodimerize and/or to interact with its substrate, such as ospub <dig> 

many previous studies have revealed that homo-dimerization is required for some rlks to be auto-phosphorylated in order to activate their full kinase activity, and in turn, the downstream signaling pathways in animals and plants  <cit> . according to this notion, we deduced that the homodimerization and autophosphorylation of pid <dig> might be required for the activation of pid2-mediated immune signaling. collectively, we propose a model to summarize these results . in the absence of a corresponding ligand, the immune receptor pid <dig> is in a stable inactive state. the perception of the ligand by its extracellular b-lectin domain activates pid <dig> and promotes its homodimerization and autophosphorylation, as well as the recruitment and phosphorylation of cytosolic ospub <dig>  after that, the phosphorylated ospub <dig> release e <dig> ligase activity to mediate the ubiquitination and degradation of its substrate, which might be -involved in regulating rice immune responses. unfortunately, we could not provide genetic evidences to support this model as we failed to obtain the pid <dig> plants silenced for ospub <dig>  in future study, it will be interesting to determine the biological functions of ospub <dig> in pid2-mediated immunity using alternative genetic approaches.figure  <dig> 
a proposed model for ospub <dig> to regulate pid2-mediated signaling. the unknown ligand from pathogen is likely able to activate the immune receptor pid <dig> by changing its conformation, which leads directly to the homodimerization and autophosphorylation of pid <dig>  such phosphorylated form of pid <dig> then recruits and transphosphorylates ospub <dig>  the phosphorylated ospub <dig> serves as an active e <dig> ligase to mediate the degradation of unknown substrate, which is/are likely involved in pid2-mediated immune responses.



previous studies indicated that pid <dig> belonged to the non-rd subclass of rlks  <cit> , which is characterized by carrying an uncharged residue  in place of the conserved arginine  located just before the catalytic aspartate  residue with known roles in regulation of innate immunity in both animals and plants  <cit> . besides pid <dig>  the well-characterized immune receptors, xa <dig> and fls <dig>  also belong to non-rd kinases  <cit> . interestingly, both xa <dig> and fls <dig> also interact directly with their respective plant e <dig> ligases to regulate plant defense responses  <cit> . thus, we suggest that the signal pathway mediated by interactions between non-rd kinases and e <dig> ligases responsible for regulating innate immunity might broadly exist in plant kingdoms.

more interestingly, the transgenic plants over-expressing ospub <dig> but lacking of functional pid <dig> constitutively exhibit enhanced disease resistance to blast pathogens, accompanied with typical immune responses, such as rapid production of ros and up-regulated expression of pr genes . these findings suggest that ospub <dig> also regulates plant basal defense responses in a pid2-independent manner. together with its involvement in plant cell death, salt and drought stresses, our study reveals that ospub <dig> functions in many biological processes in rice, including plant growth, biotic and abiotic stresses.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we confirmed that ospub <dig>  a u-box/arm repeat e <dig> ligase, was a binding partner of rice blast resistance protein pid <dig>  in addition, we found that the kinase domain of pid <dig> was an active kinase capable of phosphorylating ospub <dig> and ospub <dig> was a substrate of pid <dig>  we also found that rice plants over-expressing ospub <dig> displayed spontaneous cell death, excessive accumulation of ros, increased expression of pathogenesis-related genes and enhanced resistance to different blast strains. taken together, our study demonstrates that ospub <dig> interacts with pid <dig> and plays significant roles in plant cell death and defense responses.
