BACKGROUND
invertases , widely distributed among plants and microorganisms, catalyse the hydrolysis of sucrose to equimolar amounts of d-fructose and d-glucose  <cit> . at saturated  sucrose concentrations, many β-fructofuranosidases – especially those of fungal origin – display varying degrees of fructosyltransferase activity by cleaving the β- linkage, releasing glucose, and transferring the fructose moiety onto an acceptor molecule other than water. these acceptor molecules are initially usually unhydrolysed sucrose  which generates 1-kestose , whereafter another fructose moiety can be transferred onto 1-kestose to produce 1-nystose . this fructosyltransferase reaction can continue onto 1-nystose to produce 1f-fructofuranosylnystose   <cit> .

collectively known as short-chain fructooligosaccharides , mixtures of gf2-gf <dig> are considered as health-promoting food ingredients  <cit> . scfos have a lower sweetness intensity than sucrose making it suitable as a diabetic-friendly sweetener with low caloric and non-cariogenic properties. more importantly, scfos function as prebiotic compounds that selectively stimulate beneficial colonic bifidobacteria and lactobacilli  <cit> . as a dietary additive they exert an array of beneficial effects on human health ranging from protection against the development of colon cancer and inflammatory bowel disease, improved calcium absorption, reduction of serum lipids and diminishing adverse effects of intestinal pathogens  <cit> .

furthermore, β-fructofuranosidases are currently also being investigated as potential biosensors for the detection of various biologically and medically relevant compounds  <cit> . in general, this application relies on the target-induced release of a β-fructofuranosidase moiety from a functional dna-enzyme conjugate. β-fructofuranosidases are preferred above other types of enzymes due to the relatively inexpensive substrate, easily detectable end-products and high catalytic activities of many fungal β-fructofuranosidases. for this reason it is desirable to produce high levels of β-fructofuranosidases in pure form.

β-fructofuranosidases belong to the glycoside hydrolase family  <dig>  of the sequence-based classification of carbohydrate-active enzymes  <cit> . this family of enzymes also includes enzymes that exhibit activity on fructan-based carbohydrates like inulinases , levanase , exo-inulinase , transfructosidases like sucrose:sucrose 1-fructosyltransferase  and fructan:fructan 1-fructosyltransferase . members of the gh <dig> enzyme family retain the anomeric configuration of the anomeric carbon by operating through a double displacement mechanism. in all β-fructofuranosidases, the catalytic amino acid residues are conserved in that an aspartic acid  residue conducts the nucleophilic attack and a glutamic acid  residue acts as the general catalytic acid/base. these two bases are often located within conserved regions known as the wmndpng and ec motifs, respectively. another aspartic acid residue within a conserved rdp motif has been identified as the transition state stabilizer and forms part of what is known as the catalytic triad with the other two residues  <cit> .

based on the 3d-stuctures that have been resolved for gh <dig> enzymes, the n-terminal catalytic domains exhibit a β-propeller configuration, a feature shared with family gh <dig>  and together these two families form the gh-j clan  <cit> . the gh <dig> enzymes that have been described have bimodular arrangements and usually also have a c-terminal β-sandwich domain, which seems to maintain structural stability and may have a role in protein oligomerization  <cit> .

a growing demand for scfos as food and pharmaceutical ingredient combined with the inherent limitations of available enzymes used in the commercial production of scfos from sucrose have been the driving force behind extensive research efforts to develop cost-effective production and application of β-fructofuranosidases  <cit> . here we describe the molecular, phylogenetic, and biochemical characterization of the first extracellular β-fructofuranosidase, cminv, from the fungus ceratocystis moniliformis  recombinantly produced at high levels in an invertase-negative strain of s. cerevisiae.

RESULTS
cloning of cminv and fopa genes
the primers designed in this study correctly amplified the cminv gene from genomic dna of c. moniliformis. for heterologous expression of the cminv gene, no cdna isolation of the gene was required as the gene contained no predicted introns. functionality of the cminv gene was confirmed in s. cerevisiae by <dig> as the gene complemented the suc <dig> gene knock-out that prohibits the strain from growing on sucrose as sole carbohydrate source. the synthetically-made fopa gene also complemented the suc <dig> gene knock-out when expressed in s. cerevisiae by <dig>  as reported previously  <cit> .

in silico translation of the cminv reading frame obtained revealed a corresponding  <dig> amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of  <dig>  kda. the first  <dig> residues of the translated sequence comprised a eukaryotic secretion signal. in addition, the sequence of the mature protein had a predicted pi of  <dig>  and seven putative n-glycosylation sites were also identified on the mature sequence.

alignment and phylogeny
alignment of the cminv amino acid sequence with known invertases revealed that the cminv gene encodes a product with the expected conserved motifs reported for other invertases and members of the glycoside hydrolase family  <dig> . based on these alignments, the residues d <dig>  d <dig> and e <dig> of the translated protein sequence, were identified as the nucleophile, transition-state stabilizer and general acid/base catalyst, respectively. the wmndpng conserved region which includes the nucleophilic residue differs slightly in that the last two residues are ca instead of ng. however, the cminv sequence has more homology to this region than other β-fructofuranosidases with known strong fructosyltransferase activities like fopa, suc <dig> from a. niger <cit>  and f <dig> from aspergillus oryzae <cit> . within the existing phylogenetic framework for the gh <dig> family  <cit> , the cminv protein sequence was grouped in a well-supported clade which was previously designated as the group  <dig> intracellular invertase subfamily . the closest related protein  to cminv that has been characterized previously is the intracellular β-fructofuranosidase, sucb, of aspergillus niger <cit> .

purification of cminv and kinetic parameters
following size-exclusion chromatography of the crude yeast supernatant, electrophoretically homogenous β-fructofuranosidase-positive fractions were used for further characterization . initial rate enzyme reactions of cminv with increasing sucrose concentrations led to typical michaelis-menten-like kinetics with the apparent michaelis constant  and maximal reaction velocity  parameters calculated to be  <dig>  mm and 986 μmol/min/mg protein, respectively.

influence of temperature and ph on cminv hydrolytic activity
purified cminv was assayed for five minutes at various temperature and ph conditions simultaneously. the highest hydrolytic activity was recorded at a temperature of  <dig> °c and a ph of  <dig>  . although cminv hydrolytic activity could be detected at all the temperatures tested, no activity could be detected below ph  <dig> . for thermostability analyses, the purified enzyme was preincubated at different temperatures for up to 24 hours before a five minute assay at 60°c was performed to generate a thermostability profile of the purified cminv . cminv did not retain any activity after 24 hours of incubation at temperatures over 40°c. of note is that activity of the enzyme was already lost after 30 minutes of incubation at 60°c, which is just under its optimal temperature.

influence of ions on cminv hydrolytic activity
the addition of li+, fe3+ and co2+ ions at a concentration of 5 mm slightly increased cminv hydrolytic activity . however, a 186% increase in cminv hydrolytic activity was observed in the presence of 50 mm li+ ions. in all other cases, the treatments with ions led to a reduction in cminv hydrolytic activity. the addition of 50 mm nh4+, zn+ and mg2+ completely inactivated the enzyme.

*
*standard five minute assays were conducted at  <dig> °c and ph  <dig> using two different ion concentrations.

scfos production
crude cminv was capable of producing both 1-kestose and traces of 1-nystose from 10% sucrose under the experimental conditions . its ut/uh ratio i.e. fructosyltransferase to hydrolase activity was calculated to be  <dig> . this was less than the ut/uh ratio of  <dig>  of fopa under the same conditions.

electrophoresis and zymogram analyses
sds-page of s. cerevisiae by <dig> supernatant showed a distinct band larger than 200 kda . this band showed invertase activity when the same sample was subjected to zymogram analysis. de-n-glycosylation of the supernatant revealed a protein band  corresponding to the predicted molecular size of the mature protein of  <dig>  kda. despite several alterations to the protocol, the de-n-glycosylated version of cminv showed no activity upon zymogram analysis.

small-scale recombinant production of cminv and fopa enzymes
supernatants of s. cerevisiae by <dig> cultivated in 50 ml of sc media in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks for two days were calculated to produce 197 ± 6 iu of cminv enzyme when assayed for five minutes at 60°c. in comparison, only  <dig>  ±  <dig>  iu of enzyme of s. cerevisiae by <dig> was produced under the same cultivation conditions by the yeast.

discussion
the bioconversion of sucrose by β-fructofuranosidases from aspergillus niger or aureobasidium pullulans is one of the current methods used in commercial scfos production  <cit> . with the increasing demand for scfos in food and pharmaceutical products, efforts to find alternative β-fructofuranosidases from other microbial sources or to increase enzyme production efficiency by known β-fructofuranosidase producers have been a major research thrust to lower scfos production costs  <cit> .

the recent availability of the complete genome sequence  of c. moniliformis cmw  <dig> facilitated the identification the cminv gene, which encodes a β-fructofuranosidase. phylogenetic analysis of this protein revealed that it forms part of a clade  containing other known and putative β-fructofuranosidases  <cit> . within group  <dig>  cminv is closely related to the β-fructofuranosidase sucb of a. niger, although the members of group  <dig> are thought to represent intracellular invertases because of their apparent lack of signal peptide cleavage sites  <cit> . like the commercially-used proteins fopa from a. niger and suc <dig> from s. cerevisiae, cminv harbours a signal peptide cleavage site between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig>  supporting the fact that it is a secreted enzyme. experimental data substantiate this claim, as β-fructofuranosidase activity was detected in the supernatant of s. cerevisiae. however, suc <dig> and fopa respectively form part of groups  <dig> and  <dig> that both include other extracellular fungal invertases  <cit> . these data thus suggest that, in the case of the gh <dig> family, phylogenetic affinity alone has little predictive value regarding subcellular localization.

since non-sucrolytic strains of s. cerevisiae have previously been shown to be ideal expression hosts for β-fructofuranosidase genes  <cit> , s. cerevisiae by4742∆suc <dig> was used for the heterologous expression of the cminv gene for ease of characterization of the protein. cminv was purified from the supernatant of the recombinant yeast with size-exclusion chromatography. since s. cerevisiae produces few extracellular proteins and the cminv protein appeared electrophoretically homogenous on a silver-stained page-gel, additional purification was not necessary for subsequent characterization of the protein. cminv acts as a β-fructofuranosidase, which is able to hydrolyse the glucose-fructose glycosidic linkage in sucrose. cminv appears to have a relatively high affinity for sucrose with an experimentally determined the km value of the purified cminv for sucrose  lower than what has been reported for the widely-used industrial invertase of s. cerevisiae, suc <dig>  <cit> ; lafraya et al.  <cit>  recently reported the km of 38 mm for suc <dig>  although varying km values for suc <dig> ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mm have been reported. the  of cminv for sucrose as substrate was 986 μmol/min/mg which is about  <dig> times higher than that for its closest characterized relative i.e. the sucb of a. niger with a vmax of  <dig>  μmol/min/mg  <cit> . calculation of the turnover rate  of the enzyme was not done due to the high level of recombinant glycosylation of cminv, making accurate molecular weight determination misleading.

cminv retained 75% of its hydrolytic activity observed under optimal ph and temperature conditions at ph levels of  <dig> - <dig>  and temperatures of 50-65°c. although its closest characterized relative, the intracellular sucb of a. niger, possesses a similar ph optima profile, its temperature optima was only recorded at 37-40°c  <cit> . a characteristic that cminv shares with suc <dig> is its weak thermostability after prolonged exposure to higher-than-ambient temperatures  <cit> . a more thermostable version of an enzyme is highly desirable as it would increase the productivity of enzyme conversion  <cit> . one way to improve the thermostability of cminv could be to add bifunctional cross-linkers as had been done to improve the thermostability of suc <dig>  <cit> . immobilizing invertases on several hydrophilic matrices have also been shown in many cases to improve the general stability of the enzyme  <cit> .

this study showed that cminv produce significant amounts of scfos from sucrose. however, based on the experimental conditions, the fructosyltransferase to hydrolysis ratio was found not to be as high as the commercially-used fopa enzyme. optimization of the experimental conditions could improve the fructosyltransferase reaction of the cminv enzyme and subsequent scfos yields. since there is a noticeable difference in homology between the conserved region which contains the nucleophilic aspartic acid of cminv and fopa, mutations within this region might be key if improvement of the fructosyltransferase capability is desired. this strategy was employed with s. cerevisiae’s suc <dig> where most enhanced fructosyltransferase activity was observed when mutations were introduced within this conserved region  <cit> .

most of the metal ion additions to the enzyme reactions, with the exception of li+, behaved predictably since most treatments had either a marginal improvement or negative impact  <cit> . to our knowledge, incorporating li+ ions to any invertase reaction has not yet been reported and it is still unclear why the large increase in activity was observed. no particular pattern could be observed with regards to the ionic radius of li+ relative to the other ions tested as the sizes of ionic radii of ions have been reported to have a varying effect on many enzymatic reactions  <cit> . monovalent salts such as licl generally modifies the ionic strength of a solution which, depending on the charge distribution of the enzyme, have either a stabilizing or destabilizing impact on the enzyme conformation  <cit> . although ca2+, mg+ and na+ additions were shown to enhance invertase activity previously  <cit> , the opposite was found for cminv. na+ additions were not conducted as the enzyme was already resuspended in na+-containing pbs-buffer. although ion additions clearly affect invertase activity, the results obtained from this study as well as from many previous reports indicate that no clear pattern exists to predict which ion will lead to a dramatic improvement or reduction in invertase activity.

despite numerous theories, to predict at what levels a recombinant protein will be produced in its recombinant host is impossible  <cit> . this is mainly due to the complex interactions of all the factors that are involved in the successful production of any protein regardless whether it is foreign or not. here, we show that the cminv protein with its unmodified gene sequence can be produced at relatively high levels in s. cerevisiae. this is exemplified when compared to the fopa enzyme levels – functionally similar and expressed from a codon-optimized gene – that is produced at roughly 100-fold lower levels. this bodes well for possible large-scale application of cminv and could provide an alternative to other invertases being used in industry.

to our knowledge, no other gene product from c. moniliformis has been characterized to any extent. although the complete genome sequence of c. moniliformis cmw  <dig> is not currently publicly available, this work highlights how gene discovery is facilitated in the exciting era of next-generation sequencing and the vast amounts of genomic data associated with it. by making use of reverse genetics approaches such as the one used in this study, a plethora of industrially functional products await discovery, not only in ceratocystis but all of the thousands of fungi whose genomes are currently being sequenced .

CONCLUSIONS
we described here the β-fructofuranosidase gene  from c. moniliformis and the recombinant expression thereof in s. cerevisiae. the recombinant cminv showed high affinity towards sucrose and along with its notable high-level production and secretion by s. cerevisiae makes this protein an attractive option for large-scale applications.
