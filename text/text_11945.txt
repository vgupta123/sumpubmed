BACKGROUND
single nucleotide polymorphism  is a single nucleotide variation that occurs when a single nucleotide, such as an adenine , replaces one of the other three nucleotide letters: thymine , cytosine  or guanine , and it is an important variation for the diversity among individuals, as well as leading to phenotypes, traits, and diseases
 <cit> . snps usually occur in regions where natural selection is acting and fixating the allele of the snp that constitutes the most favorable genetic adaptation
 <cit> , and most snps  discovered by genome-wide association studies  over the last decade that appear to contribute to human disease risk are not located in protein-coding regions
 <cit> , suggesting that snps regulate gene transcription levels rather than alter the protein-coding sequence or protein structure
 <cit> . therefore, snps located in non-coding regions involved in regulation might be closely associated with disease.

mirnas  are small 20– <dig> nucleotide  non-coding rnas that normally negatively regulate messenger rnas  translation either via mrna degradation or repression of mrna translation
 <cit> . animal genomes harbour numerous small, non-coding mirnas which post-transcriptionally regulate many protein-coding genes to influence the processes ranging from metabolism, development and regulation of nervous and immune systems to the onset of cancer
 <cit> . to date, hundreds of mirnas have been identified in the human genome, and they play key roles in a broad range of physiologic and pathologic processes
 <cit> . indeed, the growing understanding of the regulatory properties and pleiotropic effects of mirnas on molecular and cellular mechanisms, suggests that alterations in the mirna/mrna interaction may contribute to phenotypic variation
 <cit> . snps in the mirnas might affect the expression of multiple target genes by disturbing translation or cleavage of the target mrnas
 <cit> , and exhibit more profound and broader biological effects than snps in mrnas
 <cit> . snps in mirnas affect gene regulation mainly in two ways: either impairing mirna/mrna interaction or disturbing mirna biogenesis, both of which finally result in gene dysregulation.

mirna/mrna interaction can be impaired by snps in mature mirnas. snps in mature mrnas could create, destroy, or modify the efficiency of mirna in binding to 3′-untranslated region  of target mrnas
 <cit> , hence they might cause post-transcriptional dysregulation due to the stringent recognition requirement in binding mature mirnas to 3′utrs of target mrnas in a sequence-specific manner
 <cit> .

mirna biogenesis can be blocked by snps in terminal loops and extension duplexes 
 <cit> . maturation of canonical mirnas is a two-step cleavage of primary mirna  by drosha and dicer
 <cit> , following which, pri-mirna is processed into ~22 nt double-stranded rna product . successful cleavage can produce mirna for mirna/mrna interaction, but some snps might inhibit cleavage, thus block mirna biogenesis including mirna processing, strand loading, and so forth
 <cit> . in the process of mirna maturation, compared to cleavage by dicer, cleavage by drosha is more important because dicer just cleaves double-stranded rna  at the site of ~22 nt from the cleavage sites of drosha
 <cit> . the big terminal loop and the stable double-strand of an rna hairpin are two main requirements for drosha to effectively cleave pri-mirna, and an snp which destroys the two requirements is supposed to block mirna biogenesis.
 <cit> . although either strand of the duplex may potentially act as a functional mirna, only the one strand which is incorporated into the rna-induced silencing complex  is termed as mature mirna.

case–control study is a main route for searching disease-related snps. by case–control study, some snps in genes associated with schizophrenia are revealed
 <cit> , some snps in pre-mirna  flanking regions are discovered to be associated with schizophrenia or breast cancer
 <cit> , and some snps in pre-mirnas or in mirna seeds are detected to cause coronary artery disease
 <cit> . in contrast to traditional case–control studies which specifically test one or a few genetic regions, gwas investigates the entire genome. for example, jing gong et al. performed a genome-wide scan for snps in human pre-mirnas, mirna flanking regions, and target mrnas, and designed a pipeline to predict the effects of them on mirna/mrna interaction
 <cit> ; keren oved et al. identified chl <dig> as a tentative selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors by genome-wide expression profiling of human lymphoblastoid cell lines 
 <cit> ; and jesse d. ziebarth et al. constructed a database, polymirts database  <dig> , which provided links between snps in mirna target sites and the results of gwas of human diseases
 <cit> . the studies above have discovered disease-related snps in mirnas, but the complicated steps including sample collection, biochemical assay and long-period observation become a limit of convenient and fast detection of disease-related snps in mirnas. moreover, the studies generally detect the snps whose rare frequency is more than 1%, so the rarer snps cannot be discovered.

among a multitude of complex diseases, schizophrenia might be closely associated with mirna mutation. different from many complex diseases with obvious changed expression of a few genes, schizophrenia follows many genes with small expression alteration
 <cit> . because no core genes with significant expression alternation contribute to a big risk of schizophrenia, we might hypothesize that dysregulation of genes could play a more important role in schizophrenia than altered expression genes themselves
 <cit> . as an important regulator of genes, a single mirna can regulate expression of multiple genes, an snp in schizophrenia-associated mirnas  can therefore change the expression of multiple genes even if the expression change of each gene is not significant. according to it, we believe that an snp in szmirnas has a high possibility to cause schizophrenia. moreover, schizophrenia is a severe disabling brain disease, and mirnas have been proved to be involved in brain development and function
 <cit> , therefore, snps in szmirnas, a main mutation of mirnas, are also supposed to be closely associated with schizophrenia. however, the association of snps in mirnas and schizophrenia is unexplored due to poor understanding of the pathophysiology and molecular mechanisms of schizophrenia even if there have been some recent researches focusing on the identification and analysis of snps in mirnas
 <cit> .

identification of schizophrenia-causal snps  is necessary for further study of schizophrenia. in this study, we propose a novel and simple computational method to detect sz-snps in szmirnas by detecting free energy change caused by the existence of an snp. using the method, the snps which can change free energy significantly are discovered, and  <dig> out of  <dig> known snps in szmirnas are supposed to be responsible for most cases of schizophrenia in population.

RESULTS
identified snps associated with schizophrenia
we collect  <dig> szmirnas, and add an snp into them by replacing every nucleotide with any one of the other three letters after dividing each szmirna into  <dig> segments: terminal loop, mature mirna duplex and extension duplex . there are separately  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> snps in the three segments of the szmirnas. by detecting free energy change of each segment,  <dig>  snps in terminal loops can decrease free energy, and  <dig>  snps in mature mirna duplexes and  <dig>  snps in extension duplexes can increase free energy. although the  <dig>  snps might be associated with schizophrenia more or less, many of them are not causal ones because some just change free energy very slightly. we sort the snps in terminal loops by the free energy change, and then compute  snps/sum of all free energy change) to find the inflection point of free energy change. the top  <dig> snps in terminal loops are supposed to be causal ones. similarly, the top  <dig> snps in extension duplexes and  <dig> snps in mature mirnas are identifies as sz-snps. from the sz-snps , we find that free energy is significantly decreased when nucleotides a and u are changed and free energy is significantly increased when nucleotides c and g are changed. this phenomenon comes from that there are three hydrogen bonds between a c-g base pair and two bonds between an a-u base pair, therefore, forming a new or destroying an available c-g pair can cause larger change in free energy than an a-u pair.

identification of snps responsible for most cases of schizophrenia
there are two groups of snps in our study: known snps which are those detected in former studies, and artificial snps which are never reported. by analyzing free energy change caused by snps , we find there seems no significant difference between the known and artificial sz-snps. the range of free energy increase caused by all the sz-snps in mature mirnas is from to  <dig>  to  <dig>  , and the range of free energy increase caused by the known sz-snps is from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the range of free energy increase caused by all the snps in extension duplexes is from to  <dig>  to  <dig> , and the range of free energy increase caused by the known sz-snps is from  <dig>  to  <dig> . we perform a t-test and prove that free energy change caused by the known sz-snps is not significantly different from that caused by the artificial sz-snps, but a known sz-snps have higher possibility to be causal for most cases of schizophrenia than an artificial one even if free energy change caused by them is same. people could have schizophrenia if they has any sz-snp, either known or artificial, but there could be few people if a sz-snp has very low minor allele frequency, therefore, the frequency of a snp has to be taken into account for identifying causal snps in most cases of schizophrenia in population. we think artificial snps have a lower minor allele frequency than known snps because they never been detected.

snps with changed free energy are those causing decrease in free energy of terminal loops and those causing increase in free energy of mature mirnas and extension duplexes.

according to the minor allele frequency of snps, we divide them into three categories: known snps with known frequency, known snps with unknown frequency, and artificial snps. we firstly estimate a random frequency in the known frequency range of the known snps for the known snps with unknown frequency, and estimate a random frequency between  <dig> and the smallest known frequency of the known snps for the artificial snps. we then compute  as a score for each snp, and sort the snps by the score. the process of frequency estimation, score computation and snp sorting is operated  <dig> times, the top snps accounting for 50% of sum of scores  with p-value <  <dig>  are supposed to be sz-snps responsible for most cases. among the sz-snps, there are  <dig> snps are discovered, and all of them are known .

one sz-snp  among six sz-snps responsible for most cases of schizophrenia has been detected to be associated with major depression and schizophrenia in reference
 <cit> , and three known sz-snps  were discovered in patient samples
 <cit> .

discussion
szmirnas without significant or known sz-snps
although all  <dig> szmirnas are reported to be associated with schizophrenia
 <cit> , snps in them do not have same close association with schizophrenia.

first, some szmirnas do not contain significant sz-snps. there are separately  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> unique szmirnas which contain significant sz-snps in terminal loops, mature mirna and extension duplexes. for the szmirnas which do not contain significant sz-snps, snps in mirnas might not be the main ways to be associated with schizophrenia. some szmirnas contain more significant sz-snps than others, so the snps in the mirnas are more likely to have a stronger association with schizophrenia. second, there are four szmirnas  could be largely responsible for most cases of schizophrenia caused by snps in mirnas.

as for the szmirnas which contain no sz-snps in some segments, they are still associated with schizophrenia. first, snps in other regions, such as schizophrenia-associated genes  or 1 k flanking regions of szmirnas, can cause abnormal expression of szgenes or szmirnas, thus are associated with schizophrenia. second, other mutation, such as copy number variation , or dna methylation, are also responsible for schizophrenia
 <cit> .

high frequency of known snps in szmirnas
the total length of  <dig> szmirnas is  <dig> bases, and in which there are  <dig> known snps, thus the frequency of known snps in the  <dig> szmirnas is  <dig> % which is much higher than the average estimate that snps occur  <dig> in  <dig> base pairs.

uneven distribution of snps in genome might account for the high frequency of snps in szmirnas. first, snps usually occur more frequently in non-coding regions than in coding regions
 <cit>  and mirnas are very important regulators in non-coding regions, so the frequency of snps in szmirnas should be higher than in coding regions. second, compared with genes, mirnas haven the more profound and broader influence on natural selection which is acting and fixating the allele of the snp that constitutes the most favorable genetic adaptation
 <cit> , thus having a higher frequency of snps. moreover, schizophrenia is likely caused by many genes which individually contribute a small risk
 <cit> . a single snp in szmirna can change expression of many szgenes by changing the szmirna/szgene interaction, so snps in szmirnas are more possible to cause schizophrenia than snps in other regions
 <cit> . high frequency of snps in szmirnas can also explain the important role of mirna in the etiology of schizophrenia.

uneven distribution of known snps in szmirna segments
the frequencies of the known snps in terminal loops, mature mirna and extension duplexes of szmirnas are  <dig>  snps/kb ,  <dig>  snps/kb  and  <dig>  snps/kb  separately, and frequencies of the known sz-snps responsible for most cases of schizophrenia in the  <dig> segments are  <dig> sz-snps/kb ,  <dig>  sz-snps/kb  and  <dig>  sz-snps/kb  separately. the frequencies of known snps in the  <dig> segments of szmirnas are listed in table 
 <dig>  from which, we find that the frequency of the known snps in extension duplexes is higher than that in terminal loops and mature mirna duplexes. the higher frequency of known snps and sz-snps in extension duplexes suggests that snps might be prone to occur in extension duplexes and unstable structure of extension duplexes might have profounder influence on mirna biogenesis than a small terminal loop.

none of known snps which can decrease free energy of terminal loops
none of the five known snps in terminal loops can decrease free energy, but we cannot draw the conclusion that the known snps in terminal loops of szmirnas are not associated with schizophrenia because the structure of a terminal loop predicated by software is not accurate. reference
 <cit>  indicates that a real mirna hairpin structure often holds a large  and unstructured terminal loop which is a good substrate for efficient cleavage by drosha, but the size of terminal loop predicted by software is usually small . for instance, using rnafold
 <cit>  , hsa-let-7 g, hsa-mir-7- <dig> and hsa-mir-9- <dig> are predicted to have a very small terminal loop with the size of 4 nt, and hsa-mir-29c is predicted to have a terminal loop with the size of 5 nt. therefore, the proposed method based on analysis of free energy for detecting sz-snps does not perform in terminal loops as well as in mature mirna and extension duplexes.

CONCLUSIONS
some snps in szmirnas can change the internal energy of mirnas by changing mirna secondary structure or mirna/mrna interaction, which can cause abnormal expression of szmirnas and szgenes, we therefore think that there is a causal link between snps in szmirnas and schizophrenia. moreover, it is feasible to discover causal snps by investigating free energy change because free energy is an indicator of structural stability. the proposed method based on free energy for identifying causal snps in szmirnas is not only convenient because biochemical assay or sample comparison between cases and controls are not necessary, but it also has high resolution for causal snps even if the snps never been reported because they are very rare in the population. in addition, the proposed method can be applied to discover the causal snps in mirnas associated with other diseases.
