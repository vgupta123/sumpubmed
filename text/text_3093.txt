BACKGROUND
nucleosomes play an essential role in the management of the eukaryotic genome by facilitating its packaging inside the nucleus. they also regulate basic genomic processes such as transcription, replication and recombination, either directly by controlling the physical access of regulators to dna or indirectly by modulating their binding through a complex repertoire of histone modifications  <cit> . in recent years, dna microarray and high-throughput sequencing technologies have enabled the mapping of nucleosomes at genome-wide scale in many organisms, including yeasts , drosophila <cit> , c. elegans <cit>  and mammalian cells  <cit> . in general, nucleosome profiles conform to a pattern where nucleosome-depleted regions  are present immediately upstream from the transcription start site  of most genes in the genome  <cit> . from these sites, regular nucleosome arrays are generated that extend into the transcribed regions. since most of these studies have focused on the aggregated nucleosome profiles at the 5′ end of genes and transcribed units, the distribution of nucleosomes along intergenic regions has been comparatively less studied.

recent analyses have revealed the extremely precise organization of nucleosomes at promoters to regulate the interaction between transcription factors and dna. for example, periodic expression of the cln <dig> and ho genes during the s. cerevisiae cell cycle depends on the binding of their regulators to ndr in their promoters. experimental manipulation of these promoters showed that when the binding sites were embedded in nucleosomes, transcription was still active but the cell cycle periodic expression was lost  <cit> . by contrast, other studies have shown that transcription factors such as rap <dig> and reb <dig> preferentially bind to their cognate sites on the surface of the nucleosome immediately upstream from the promoter ndr. the fact that the binding sites for rap <dig> face outwards on the surface of the − <dig> nucleosome further highlights the relevance of their positioning and of their rotational symmetry in the regulation of gene expression  <cit> .

how is this precise nucleosome organization generated and maintained? poly  tracts can exclude nucleosomes  <cit>  and ndrs in s. cerevisiae are enriched in these elements  <cit> . other sequences have also been selected to favour low nucleosome occupancy, such as those at the promoters of respiration genes, which are usually expressed in aerobic yeasts  <cit> . however, although some sequences favor nucleosome exclusion and others can promote nucleosome occupancy  <cit> , the dna sequence alone cannot specify the nucleosome profile observed in vivo at genome-wide scale  <cit> .

the statistical positioning model  <cit>  proposed that nucleosome stacking against a physical barrier would passively generate regular arrays with an internucleosomal spacing inversely proportional to nucleosome density. recent work has shown that nucleosome positioning in s. cerevisiae is an energy-dependent process, which in the presence of atp and a cell extract can recapitulate the in vivo profile emanating from the 5′ ndrs, even at low nucleosome density and in the absence of transcription  <cit> . the model still requires the existence of physical barriers to act as organizing centers or focal points to set the beginning and confer directionality to the array  <cit> .

nucleosome distribution in s. pombe has been comparatively much less studied than in s. cerevisiae. several studies have generated genome-wide nucleosome maps using tiling microarrays or next generation sequencing. some of these analyses have focused primarily on promoters and transcribed regions and have derived their conclusions from the aggregated nucleosome profiles of hundreds or thousands of genes  <cit> , while others have focused on the ndr profiles of replication origins and recombination hotspots  <cit> .

we have sequenced mononucleosomal dna to a depth that allows a precise description of nucleosome dynamics at the level of individual nucleosomes across the s. pombe genome during mitosis and meiosis. we show that the great majority of the genome is organized in a very stable pattern of positioned nucleosomes and that ndrs overlap precisely with clusters of binding sites for transcription factors, which, in turn, could contribute to maintaining a regular nucleosome pattern across the genome.

RESULTS
widespread nucleosome positioning in the s. pombe genome
we have generated nucleosome maps in s. pombe by sequencing mononucleosomal dna at a genome coverage ranging from 46- to 177-fold. this sequencing depth allows the high resolution mapping of individual nucleosomes by aligning sequence reads directly onto the reference genome followed by signal smoothing, with minimal mathematical modification of the raw data .

to monitor the general distribution of nucleosomes along the genome, we selected the approximately  <dig> genes where the transcription start site  has been annotated  <cit>  and we aligned their nucleosomal profiles relative to the midpoint of the + <dig> nucleosome, which is the closest one downstream from the tss . the resulting aggregated profile showed a maximum at +1 n that gradually declined towards the 3′ end of the transcribed regions . this type of representation is the one most often used in the literature and generates comparable profiles in organisms as diverse as s. cerevisiae <cit>  and mammals  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
nucleosome profile of transcribed and intergenic regions in
s. pombe. the nucleosome profile of approximately 4000 s. pombe genes was aligned relative to the midpoint position of the + <dig>  , - <dig>  , central   and terminal   nucleosomes of each transcription unit. genes are arranged by increasing size from top to bottom. blue diagrams represent the relative nucleosome occupancy of the aggregated nucleosome profiles in the panels below. the data shown are from exponential mitotic diploid pat <dig>  cells.



alignment to the midpoint position of +1 n generates sharper profiles than alignment to the tss since + <dig> nucleosomes from different genes are perfectly aligned. alignment to the tss is expected to generate comparable nucleosomal profiles but of lower resolution due to variations in the distance between the tss and the midpoint position of +1 n in different genes. this is reflected in the lower amplitude of the nucleosome peaks in the aggregated profiles. alignment to tss, however, is useful for establishing where transcription initiates relative to +1 n. comparative alignments to +1 n and to tss of s. pombe are shown in additional file 3: figure s3a.

the decline in the amplitude of the oscillations from the 5′ to the 3′ end of the genes in these profiles could result from the accumulative variation in the internucleosomal distances between genes and this would therefore not imply progressively lower nucleosome occupancy. this possibility was tested by using the nucleosome closest to the central position between the tss and the transcription termination site   as a reference for the alignment. the resulting symmetric profile  indicated that nucleosomes at the 5′ and 3′ halves of transcription units were equally positioned, which is consistent with the relatively homogeneous pattern of nucleosome distribution along individual genes .figure  <dig>

it has been reported that in s. pombe, unlike in s. cerevisiae, nucleosome positioning only occurs downstream from the 5′ ndrs  <cit> . however, figure 1a shows that alignment to nucleosome + <dig> generated a regular nucleosomal profile upstream from the ndr. the low amplitude of the peaks  could be due to the different size of individual ndrs, which would cause the − <dig> nucleosome  and those upstream from it to be out of phase between different genes. this possibility was confirmed by the finding that the alignment relative to -1 n generated a clear regular profile upstream from the ndr . alignment relative to -1 n was expected to blur the periodicity of nucleosomes downstream from the ndr generated when +1 n was used as a reference, as was indeed the case . to test whether positioning was maintained downstream from transcribed regions, we used the terminal nucleosome  as a reference for the alignment. figure 1d shows that the resulting profile was virtually symmetric on both sides of tn indicating that nucleosome positioning extended beyond the tts into the adjacent intergenic region. this symmetry, however, is not present in the nucleosomal profile of s. cerevisiae, due to the presence of a ndr at the 3′ end of many genes  <cit> . the comparative profiles generated by alignment to the tn or to the tts in both yeasts is shown in additional file 3: figure s3c. taken together, these results revealed a very high degree of genome-wide nucleosome positioning in s. pombe and indicated that aggregated nucleosome profiles vary depending on the reference used to align them and do not result from different properties of specific nucleosomes or gene regions.

nucleosome remodelling at meiosis-specific promoters
to address the point of how stable this pattern was under different transcriptional regimes, we searched for differences in the genomic distribution of nucleosomes in exponential vegetative cells and at different stages through meiosis. specifically, we compared the nucleosome profiles of asynchronous haploid and diploid cells during mitosis and of diploid cells arrested in g <dig>  and at  <dig> and 5 hours after synchronous entry into meiosis, when chromosomes are recombining , and when the four haploid nuclei have separated and start maturing into spores  . previous studies have shown that several hundred genes are differentially transcribed during these early, medium and late stages  . despite these differences, we found that the aggregated nucleosomal profile at these stages was indistinguishable from those seen during mitosis . in order to detect possible differences at the level of specific genes, we compared the nucleosomal profiles along the entire genome and found that the major differences between meiotic and vegetative cells were limited to  <dig> ndrs, which were present at  <dig>   <dig> or 5 h of meiosis but were absent in mitotic cells. we defined ndrs as regions spanning at least  <dig> nucleotides . as an example, figure 2a shows a 15-kb region where a nucleosome at the 5′ end of the dni <dig> gene in meiosis at 0 hours was absent while another occupied the ndr at the 5′ end of the divergently transcribed mcm <dig> and mlo <dig> genes in the 5-hour sample . by contrast, all the other nucleosomes displayed a pattern of sharp, regularly spaced peaks that remained virtually invariable despite the different physiological stages and the chromosomal processes undergone by the cells. since the average length of the  <dig> meiosis-specific ndrs was  <dig>  +/−  <dig>  nucleotides and the average distance between the mid-point of adjacent nucleosomes is 152 bp   <cit> , we estimated that these ndrs were generated by the eviction of around  <dig> nucleosomes. we have detected  <dig> nucleosome peaks of nucleosome occupancy above the average genome-wide number of reads. of these, we have considered  <dig> nucleosomes  as well positioned since their central coordinate was more than  <dig> nucleotides away from the nearest flanking peaks. these figures are consistent with the  <dig> estimated number of nucleosomes obtained by dividing the 11825 kb of the s. pombe genome in http://www.pombase.org that remain after excluding rdna, centromeric regions and constitutive ndrs by 152 bp. this means that nucleosome remodelling in the three meiotic samples that we analyzed relative to mitosis was limited to only  <dig> % of the approximately  <dig> nucleosomes in the s. pombe genome. the genomic position of the  <dig> constitutive,  <dig> meiosis-specific and  <dig> mitosis-specific ndrs is indicated in additional file 7: table s <dig> 

to monitor whether the meiosis-specific induced ndrs were associated with the differential transcription of the adjacent genes, we generated strand-specific transcription maps of exponential mitotic cells and of cells at  <dig>   <dig> and 5 hours during meiosis using tiling microarrays. the rna level at these stages for all the annotated s. pombe genes  is indicated in additional file 5: table s <dig>  figure 2b illustrates that the eviction or repositioning of the two nucleosomes in the region shown coincided with the up- or down-regulation of the promoters of the dni <dig> and mcm2/mlo <dig> genes at  <dig> and 5 hours during meiosis, respectively. the nucleosomal and transcriptional profiles for the entire genome can be visualized in a searchable genome browser at http://genomics.usal.es/cgi-bin/gb2/gbrowse/sp_nucdyn.

how widespread is the association between nucleosome remodelling and transcriptional regulation? altogether, of the  <dig> meiosis-specific ndrs,  <dig>  mapped to sites of transcription initiation. no transcripts were detected associated with the remaining  <dig> ndrs  possibly due to a very low level of transcription, as has recently been shown for many genes in s. pombe <cit> . alternatively, these ndrs could be generated independently of transcription. they do not seem to be dependent on replication initiation either since only 20% of them colocalize with sites of binding for the origin recognition complex   <cit> . out of the  <dig> ndrs that colocalized with tss,  <dig> were adjacent to genes overexpressed at least  <dig> -fold during meiosis relative to mitosis  .

to analyze the extent to which transcriptional activation was associated with promoter remodelling, we selected a total of  <dig> genes showing at least 4-fold differential expression during the following stages:  <dig> genes overexpressed in meiosis at 0 h relative to mitosis;  <dig> genes in meiosis at 3 h relative to 0 h; and  <dig> genes in meiosis at 5 h relative to 3 h  . comparison of the nucleosomal profiles at these stages revealed that in 58/ <dig> , 22/ <dig>  and 23/ <dig>  of the genes, differential expression was associated with the eviction of 1– <dig> nucleosomes from each promoter. this means that, altogether, a meiosis-specific ndr was generated in  <dig> out of the  <dig> promoters analyzed  while the other  <dig> remained virtually identical despite the meiosis-specific overexpression. of these  <dig>   <dig> did and  <dig> did not harbour constitutive ndrs. this indicates that the constant nucleosome profile present in the great majority of the genome is also maintained in approximately 70% of the promoters of meiosis-specific genes regardless of their differential activity.

nucleosome positioning along differentially expressed genes
our quantitative analysis of transcription in mitotic and meiotic cells revealed that the rna levels between different genes ranged from undetectable to over 300-fold above the background . to address whether nucleosome positioning might be altered under conditions of high expression levels, we compared the nucleosomal profile of four different sets of  <dig> genes of similar length  whose rna level during mitosis differed across a 50-fold range. figure 3a shows that genes expressed 4- and 16-fold relative to the background maintained an identical nucleosomal pattern. additional file 9: figure s <dig> shows some examples of how the same nucleosomal profiles are maintained on the same genes expressed at different levels. in the case of genes with an rna level 64-fold above the background, nucleosome positioning was slightly altered, as indicated by the small decrease in the height of the nucleosome peaks relative to genes with a lower level of expression. by contrast, nucleosome positioning was very much disturbed on genes expressed over 180-fold above the background. the rna analysis indicated that only  <dig>  of all the genes in the genome are expressed at this high level in mitosis  and hence their impact on the aggregated profiles of nucleosomes is negligible . ndrs, however, showed greater variability between the four different groups of genes since their average size increased with the level of expression . figure 3b illustrates the correlation between different rna levels and the nucleosome organization of individual genes. for example, nucleosomes are well positioned across the spac4h <dig>  and spac4h <dig>  genes , which are expressed  <dig> - and 32-fold above the background, but positioning is lost on the pyk <dig> gene, which is expressed 238-fold. positioning is also maintained along the itt <dig>  and pmc <dig>  genes , but not on the psu <dig> gene . the same applies to the dus <dig> , erg <dig>  and sks <dig>  genes . nucleosome delocalization on some genes showing high rna levels is probably due to a high rate of nucleosome repositioning as a result of the high density of rna polymerase ii molecules crossing the gene  <cit> . this possibility is supported by the strong correlation between genes expressed at a very high rate in exponential asynchronous cells, the loss of nucleosome positioning and a high level of rna polymerase ii occupancy in cells growing under the same conditions  <cit>  .figure  <dig>

clusters of binding sites for transcription factors at nucleosome-depleted regions of meiosis-specific genes
transcription factors have been implicated in the generation of ndrs through direct competition with nucleosomes for binding or, indirectly, through recruitment of chromatin remodellers  <cit> . to explore the link between the binding of transcription factors and the specification of ndrs, we used the meme algorithm   <cit>  to search for putative transcription factor binding sites  in the ndrs of the  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> meiosis-specific genes specifically transcribed at  <dig>   <dig> and 5 h mentioned above. by applying the same parameters and criteria as previously described  <cit>   we identified three overrepresented motifs. the first of them was aacaaaga, which is the binding site for the ste <dig> transcription factor  <cit> . ste <dig> activates the expression of cell type-specific genes  as well as genes expressed in both m and p cells after nitrogen starvation  <cit> . consistent with this, we identified  <dig> to  <dig> sites for ste <dig> in  <dig> out of the  <dig> ndrs present in the sample of meiosis at 0 h, which was collected after 14 hours of culture in minimal medium without nitrogen . by contrast, this motif was not enriched in the ndrs specific of 3 h and 5 h. additional file 10: figure s7a shows the overrepresentation of ste <dig> binding sites in the ndrs of genes expressed at meiosis 0 h relative to the ndrs of genes expressed at 3 h and 5 h. the second motif identified was gtaaacaaa, which is the binding site for the mei <dig> transcription factor. mei <dig> regulates the induction of middle genes during meiosis , and it is also essential for the repression of early genes and for the activation of genes encoding transcription factors that, in turn, activate the expression of late genes  <cit> . this motif was present in  <dig> to  <dig> copies in  <dig> out of the  <dig> ndrs present at 3 h, and in  <dig> out of the  <dig> ndrs at 5 h . contrary to the tfbs of ste <dig>  the binding sites for mei <dig> were not overrepresented in the ndrs of meiosis at 0 h . the third motif identified, ccccc, is the binding site for the transcription factor rsv <dig>  <cit> , and was present in  <dig> to  <dig> copies in  <dig> out of the  <dig> meiosis-specific ndrs, with no significant bias towards the 0 h, 3 h and 5 h samples . since the ste <dig>  mei <dig> and rsv <dig> genes are expressed specifically in meiosis  <cit> , these factors are likely candidates for being involved in the generation of ndrs harbouring clusters of binding sites for them.figure  <dig>

as indicated above,  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes overexpressed over 4-fold during meiosis were associated with meiosis-specific ndrs while  <dig> genes harboured constitutive ndrs. would binding sites for ste <dig> and mei <dig> also be overrepresented in such ndrs? meme sequence analysis did not reveal enrichment in sites for ste <dig> in any of them in the 0 h, 3 h and 5 h samples. the same analysis also showed that none of the genes overexpressed at 0 h relative to mitosis had any binding motifs for mei <dig>  however, 50% of the genes overexpressed at 3 h relative to 0 h had 1– <dig> motifs and  <dig> % of the genes overexpressed at 5 h relative to 3 h had 1– <dig> motifs for mei <dig>  these results are consistent with those presented in additional file 10: figure s <dig> and imply that this factor is likely to be also involved in the specific expression of the middle and late meiotic genes through the binding to those ndrs that are constitutively present at the 5′ end of some genes specifically expressed during meiosis.

clusters of binding sites for transcription factors at nucleosome-depleted regions of cell cycle and stress response genes
to address how general the colocalization of ndrs with clusters of tfbs for genes not specific for meiosis was, we took the reverse approach of testing whether previously identified clusters colocalized with ndrs. oliva et al.  <cit>  described  <dig> clusters of putative binding sites for  <dig> transcription factors including ace <dig>  fkh, mbf and dbl <dig>  upstream from s. pombe cell cycle-regulated genes. we overlapped the position of the tfbs with the nucleosome profile of mitotic cells and found that in  <dig> out of the  <dig> cases  the clusters showed a striking overlap with ndrs . the tfbs present in them were different from those identified in the meiosis-specific ndrs , indicating that ndrs of different functional classes of genes encompassed clusters of different tfbs. to further test this association, we selected the promoters of the  <dig> genes showing the highest overexpression under conditions of oxidative stress in s. pombe that contained an ndr in their promoters  <cit> . meme analysis revealed that  <dig> ndrs included  <dig> to  <dig> copies of the consensus cre element   and  <dig> ndrs had  <dig> to  <dig> copies of the cre variant element tgacatcat  <cit>  . these sequences are bound by proteins of the atf creb that play an important role in stress response and that in s. pombe are encoded by the atf <dig>  pcr <dig>  atf <dig> and atf <dig> genes . additional file 10: figure s7b shows the overrepresentation of these two sequence elements in the ndrs of the  <dig> stress response genes.figure  <dig> 
ndrs of cell cycle-regulated and stress response genes overlap with different clusters of binding sites for transcription factors.  the cdc <dig>  mik <dig> and spcc <dig>  genes are periodically expressed during the mitotic cell cycle. clusters of binding sites for six different transcription factors  <cit>  are indicated by vertical lines:  the mug <dig> and srk <dig> genes are overexpressed under oxidative stress. binding sites for two transcription factors are indicated . the nucleosome profile across the five regions in mitotic cells is shown on top of each diagram . the transcribed dna strand during mitosis in the absence of stress corresponding to the five genes described above is shown .



transcription factors contribute redundantly to maintaining ndrs
the precise colocalization of ndrs and clusters of tfbs suggested the possibility that combinations of different transcription factors could contribute to the generation or maintenance of ndrs. to address whether actual binding was required, we independently deleted the genes encoding the atf <dig> and pcr <dig> transcription factors and monitored the impact on the genome-wide pattern of ndrs by hybridizing mononucleosomal dna from the two mutant strains to genomic tiling microarrays. these two factors form a heterodimer that regulates the expression of the core environmental stress response genes and also of other genes, and we chose them for this analysis because their binding sites in the genome have been determined  <cit> . we overlapped their genomic distribution with the nucleosome profile of mitotic wild-type cells and found that of the  <dig> major sites of atf <dig> and pcr <dig> binding in the genome in the absence of stress,  <dig>  were located in ndrs. however, we also found that only  <dig> out of the  <dig>  ndrs disappeared in both mutant strains . in these  <dig> cases,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were over- and underexpressed, respectively . in some of the cases where the level of expression remained invariable, such as upstream from the spac22f <dig>   and spac <dig>  genes , the transcription start site was shifted approximately 500 bp upstream relative to wild-type cells. in the spac <dig>  gene, transcription initiated in a ndr that remained open in the mutant cells but that was not used for transcription initiation in wild-type cells.figure  <dig> 
transcription factors are required for the maintenance of ndrs. nucleosomal and ndr patterns generated by tiling microarrays of control cells  and of atf1Δ and pcr1Δ mutants are represented by black, red and blue lines, respectively. sites of atf <dig> and pcr <dig> binding mapped by chip/chip  <cit>  are indicated by red and blue arrowheads. black arrows indicate ndrs that disappear in the absence of atf <dig> or pcr <dig> and white arrows point to ndrs not bound by atf <dig> and pcr <dig> that remain invariable in the three strains. strand-specific transcription profiles for the three strains are shown in green. alternative transcription start sites of the spac22f <dig>   and spac <dig>   genes associated with the closing of ndrs dependent on atf <dig> and pcr <dig>  are indicated by brackets.



the other  <dig>  ndrs that remained unaltered in the atf1Δ and pcr1Δ mutants were probably maintained by other transcription factors that bind to the same ndrs, consistent with the presence of multiple binding sites for tfs in ndrs of meiosis-specific and cell cycle-regulated genes . a possible candidate to contribute to the maintenance of these ndrs could be the php <dig> ccaat-binding factor  <cit>  since analysis of the  <dig> ndrs bound by atf1/pcr <dig> showed that the ccaatca sequence was present in half of the  <dig> ndrs that remained unaffected but was absent in the  <dig> that dissappeared in atf1Δ and pcr1Δ cells. it is also possible that atf <dig> and atf <dig>  another two members of the atf creb family of transcription factors, could functionally replace atf <dig> and pcr <dig> in some promoters  <cit> . this is supported by the fact that of the  <dig> genes immediately downstream from the ndrs bound by atf <dig> and pcr <dig> in the genome, only  <dig> and  <dig> genes were overexpressed and  <dig> and  <dig> genes were underexpressed more than 2-fold in the atf1Δ and pcr1Δ mutants, respectively . the transcriptional profile for the entire s. pombe genome in wild-type, atf1Δ and pcr1Δ mutant cells is shown in the genome browser linked to this article.

discussion
nucleosome dynamics of the s. pombe genome
as a consequence of the high resolution of the maps generated by us here, our results regarding the nucleosomal organization in s. pombe differ in several aspects from previous studies. for example, it has been proposed that nucleosomal positioning would coincide with the length of the transcribed units and that it is absent in inactive genes, suggesting an active role for transcription in positioning  <cit> . however, we observed that nucleosomal positioning extended beyond the transcription termination site  and that it was also present at genes showing low or undetectable transcription levels . also, although previous analyses have failed to detect positioning upstream from the ndr at the 5′ position of the genes  <cit> , we found that nucleosomal arrays emanate bidirectionally from this ndr  in a fashion comparable to that in s. cerevisiae <cit> . a comparison between the nucleosomal profiles of s. pombe and s. cerevisiae using the same criteria shows that profiles downstream from +1 n were similar . however, nucleosome positioning upstream from the ndr was slightly higher in s. cerevisiae . to test whether this effect might be partially due to the fact that the size of ndrs is more homogeneous in s. cerevisiae <cit>  than in s. pombe <cit> , we also aligned the nucleosomal profiles to -1 n and obtained comparable results in both yeasts . in the two cases, positioning was stricter downstream  than upstream  from the ndr, probably due to the variable distance of other upstream ndrs and genes that set the nucleosomal arrays out of phase in the aggregated profiles.

it is possible that the regular nucleosome pattern upstream from the ndr in s. pombe was not detected earlier owing to the limited resolution of the microarray analyses and the lower sequencing depth of previous studies, which made it difficult to define the position of the − <dig> nucleosome  <cit> .

another contribution of our work is the possibility of a genome-wide quantitative assessment of nucleosome dynamics. we estimate that only  <dig> % of the approximately  <dig> nucleosomes in the genome are remodelled during the expression of the meiotic transcriptional programme. remodelling, however, is not always associated with transcriptional activation, as illustrated by the invariable nucleosome profile of 70% of the promoters of the  <dig> genes overexpressed more than 4-fold at specific stages of meiosis relative to mitosis . a lack of correlation between transcriptional activity and the presence of ndrs at promoters has also been observed in s. cerevisiae <cit> .

specification of genomic nucleosomal patterns
in s. cerevisiae, poly  elements are overrepresented in the ndrs associated with promoters  <cit> . by contrast, these elements are not particularly enriched in s. pombe and, in agreement with previous data  <cit> , we found that only  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the poly  elements  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides long, respectively, colocalized with constitutive ndrs. conversely, only 13% of these included poly  tracts  <dig> or  <dig> nucleotides long . these results suggest that the contribution of these elements to the generation of ndrs is much smaller than in s. cerevisiae.

the statistical positioning model proposes the existence of physical barriers from which regular nucleosomal arrays are generated  <cit>  and transcriptional regulatory complexes are obvious candidates for this role. these large complexes include transcription factors, coactivators, histone modifiers and chromatin remodellers  <cit>  and are targeted to promoters by transcription factors, which are their only components capable of recognizing specific sequences on dna. binding motifs for transcription factors are made up of degenerated sequences 6–10 bp long scattered across the genome, although only a small fraction of them are actually bound in vivo. for example, in s. cerevisiae the leu <dig> transcription factor binds only a subset of all potential binding sites in the chromosomes even though the protein binds to all of them with comparable affinity on naked dna. sites bound in vivo were strongly correlated with a low nucleosome occupancy, which was not dependent on the presence of the leu <dig> protein, suggesting an opportunistic use of accessible chromatin sites already available in the genome  <cit> . in s. pombe,  <dig>  out of the  <dig> tgacgt hexamers representing potential binding sites for atf1/pcr <dig> are detectably bound in the genome  <cit> . of these  <dig> sites,  <dig>  colocalized with ndrs, of which only  <dig> disappeared in the absence of the factors , pointing to the presence of redundant elements in their maintenance, as in the case of leu <dig>  this possibility is strongly supported by the recent finding that up to  <dig> proteins are involved in the maintenance of the ndr at the cln <dig> promoter in s. cerevisiae <cit> . along the same lines, ndrs at heterochromatic regions in s. pombe depend on the combinatorial contribution of at least  <dig> different proteins  <cit> . however, ndrs can also be generated as a consequence of the binding of a single transcription factor, as in the case of the m <dig> mutation in s. pombe, which generates a binding site for atf <dig>  <cit> . also, dna sequences refractory to bending such as poly   <cit> , poly g tracts  <cit>  and sequences at some promoters  <cit>  favour the exclusion of nucleosomes.

previous studies have found that the binding sites for transcription factors tend to cluster at promoters  <cit>  and our results show that these clusters overlap precisely with ndrs at the promoters of meiosis-specific , cell cycle-regulated genes, and stress-response genes . the complexity of the clusters of binding sites for tfs suggests that each ndr and each promoter is probably unique, making it very difficult to predict the effect that the removal of specific elements will have in its maintenance or on the expression of the adjacent genes. for example, while the lack of leu <dig> in s. cerevisiae <cit>  and of atf1/pcr <dig> in s. pombe  has a limited impact on ndrs genome-wide, deletion of the abf <dig> and reb <dig> transcription factors in s. cerevisiae negatively affects a larger number of ndrs  <cit> . similarly, the sap <dig> protein, which is involved in dna replication and mating-type switching and binds preferentially to ndrs, is required for the maintenance of a large number of them in s. pombe <cit> .

this collaborative strategy of tfs to assemble transcription complexes at promoters has several immediate advantages for genome regulation. the first is that it favours transcription initiation from the 5′ end of genes and reduces spurious initiation at single binding sites dispersed along the genome that are usually occluded by nucleosomes. second, the redundant contribution of several factors guarantees the maintenance of ndrs, regardless of fluctuations in their concentrations. altogether, we have identified  <dig> constitutive ndrs in mitotic and meiotic cells and  <dig> meiosis-specific ndrs. the constitutive presence of a large fraction of ndrs could facilitate the rapid transcriptional induction of, for example, stress response genes  <cit> , and could also contribute to other processes such as the specification of meiotic recombination hotspots  <cit> . a third function of ndrs and the complexes bound to them would be to act as barriers  <cit>  or organizing centers from where nucleosome arrays are generated  <cit> . the targeting of these complexes by transcription factors to the same specific sites in every genome and the relatively close proximity between promoters could explain why a virtually identical nucleosomal arrangement is maintained in all the cells in the population under very different physiological conditions. a stable nucleosomal pattern during mitosis and meiosis has also been observed in s. cerevisiae <cit> . this is compatible with an active turnover of nucleosomes as has been described in s. cerevisiae <cit>  and with variations in the epigenetic modifications of histones  <cit>  that could provide flexible regulatory signalling while maintaining a constant nucleosomal framework.

CONCLUSIONS
nucleosome dynamics in s. pombe genome is limited to a very small fraction of the genome that overlaps with regulatory regions. we have shown that ndrs encompass clusters of tfbs specific for different gene functions such as meiosis, cell-cycle regulation and stress response. sequence analysis of these narrow and well-defined regions should help to define genomic regulatory networks based on the combinatorial and collective contribution of regulatory elements shared by different promoters. on the other hand, the high degree of order at nucleosome level probably underlies the ordered structure of chromatin organization at higher levels, evidenced by the specific pattern of interactions between different chromosomes  <cit>  and by the global three-dimensional architecture of the nucleus, where each chromosome occupies a specific territory  <cit> . despite the many instances in which nucleosome remodelling at promoters is not associated with changes in transcriptional activity  <cit> , the maintenance of a highly organized nucleosomal pattern is likely to be important for genomic stability, as illustrated by the gross alterations in recombination  <cit> , and for preventing cryptic and unscheduled antisense transcription that results when the level of histones or the positioning of nucleosomes is altered .
