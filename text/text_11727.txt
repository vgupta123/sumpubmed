BACKGROUND
gene expression data are ever increasingly being used in the fields of medicine including categorization of cancers into different diagnostic subgroups, which often appear similar in routine histology  <cit> . we focus our attention on one such important problem, proper classification of various groups of childhood cancers, collectively known as small round blue cell tumors . the worldwide incidence rates of childhood cancers vary widely from as high as  <dig> per million persons in nigeria to  <dig> per million persons in the indian population of fiji. the incidence rate of childhood cancer in the usa is approximately  <dig> per million persons  <cit> . amongst the various childhood cancers, srbct is the third most frequently occurring type  and consists of neuroblastoma , non-hodgkin lymphoma , rhabdomyosarcoma , and ewing sarcoma   <cit> . these heterogeneous types of cancer present a similar histology of small blue tumor cell and thus often leads to misdiagnosis. accurate diagnosis of these subgroups is important as the treatment options, monitoring the response and prognosis may vary widely between these subgroups. development of cancer is a complex reorganization and remodeling of multiple cellular pathways affecting thousands of genes. thus the identification of global gene expression signatures rather than depending on a particular gene marker for a specific type of cancer may be ideally suited in categorizing various subgroups of srbcts. our objective here is to identify a small set of biomarkers to design useful diagnostic prediction systems for accurate classification of the four categories of srbcts.

typically gene expression data suffer from three problems :  limited number of available examples,  very high dimensional nature of the data, and  noisy characteristics of the data. moreover, for a given problem, usually a few genes are required. so we face two challenging tasks: finding a minimal set of genes that has an adequate discriminating power to categorize the subgroups and designing of a prediction system using the selected genes to accurately classify unseen examples. use of a minimal number of genes is consistent with the principal of minimum description length . systems designed keeping in mind mdl are likely to yield better generalization . moreover, with a small set of genes, it is easy to optimize the diagnostic system better. model selection can also be done using akaike information criterion . several attempts have been made to solve these problems. the different machine learning tools used by researchers include multilayer perceptron  networks  <cit> , self-organizing maps  <cit> , nearest centroid classifiers  <cit> , support vector machines   <cit> . similarly, many gene selection methods have also been used. the gene selection methods often ignore the learning machine used to design the prediction system. some methods, although, take into account the learning machines, they remove one  at a time in a stepwise manner. such a method cannot capture the subtle nonlinear interactions between different genes and consequently, one ends up with more genes than what is needed to solve the problem.

to overcome this problem, we use a neural network, which can pick up what is needed  when it learns the diagnostic classification task. this helps the network to honor possible nonlinear interactions between genes. the set of selected genes is further reduced with clustering of correlated genes based on fuzzy sets theory. we apply our method on the same srbct data set used by khan et al.  <cit>  and other researchers  <cit> . this data set consists of expression levels of  <dig>  genes, which were obtained from glass-slide cdna microarrays, prepared in accordance with the standard protocol of the national human genome research institute. we have identified only seven  genes that can do the diagnostic classification task with 100% accuracy both on the training data and the blind test data. this set of genes includes three novel genes, nab <dig>  ehd <dig>  and lsp <dig>  that are not identified by others as important. our method clearly outperforms other results because for the same data set, the number of marker genes reported by other researchers vary between  <dig> and  <dig>  moreover, we have demonstrated that these seven genes perform equally well with other machine learning tools like radial basis function network and support vector machines.

RESULTS
data set
khan et al.  <cit>  considered the  <dig> genes that passed a filter requiring a minimum expression level and all other processing was done on this set of  <dig> genes. we also use the same set of  <dig> genes. there are  <dig> samples of which  <dig>  samples are used for training. the remaining  <dig> includes five samples which are later detected to be of non-srbct types. hence for blind testing of the system we use  <dig>  samples. for this data set, other researchers also used this training-test partition. the five non-srbct samples include  <dig> normal muscle tissues  and  <dig> cell lines including an undifferentiated sarcoma , osteosarcoma  and a prostate carcinoma . the data set is available at  <cit> .

the predicted and the actual outputs of a typical run for the  <dig> blind test samples. these  <dig> also includes the  <dig> nonsrbct cases as marked in column  <dig> . all but sample no.  <dig> of the  <dig> srbct test samples, the support provided by the network for the correct class is almost  <dig> and for the other classes it is practically  <dig>  for sample no.  <dig>  the support for the correct class is  <dig>  but it is about  <dig> times stronger than the next high output value. hence, this is also a decision with high confidence. for sample no.  <dig>  although the network classified it correctly, the support for rms and ews are  <dig>  and  <dig>  suggesting further investigation . due to nonavailability of the patient's identity, this investigation could not be pursued further.

neural networks with online gene selection ability select good biomarkers
we have used a modified multilayered perceptron  network  <cit>  with online feature selection capability for identification of biomarkers. we call it feature selection mlp . conceptually, each input node  of the fsmlp has a gate associated with it. at the beginning of training, these gates are kept almost closed, and the learning algorithm opens the required gates  depending on the ability of genes to reduce the training error. this is our first stage. in this stage, we have selected only twenty genes based on the importance of genes as defined by the gate opening values . for the fsmlp network to reduce the chances of bad generalization, we have used just one hidden layer with  <dig> nodes. the set of selected twenty genes are listed in table  <dig>  these twenty genes have enough characteristic signatures to discriminate the four categories of tumors with 100% accuracy both in the training and test data sets. with these twenty genes, we have trained neural networks  <dig> times with different initializations, and in each case the system is found to achieve 100% accuracy on the training data as well as on the twenty blind test data.

we used a network with  <dig> input nodes,  <dig> hidden nodes and  <dig> output nodes. these twenty genes are selected based on the gate opening values. we made several runs of ordinary mlp using these twenty genes and in each case the network was able to correctly classify all training and blind test examples. in the second stage, the fsmlp network is used to select ten best genes from amongst the twenty genes selected in the first stage. these ten genes are marked by asterisks. this set of ten genes has adequate cancer specific signatures to categorize the four types of srbcts.

relational fuzzy clustering and neural networks together select only seven biomarkers
in order to further reduce the number of biomarkers, we have proceeded as follows: again we have used the fsmlp to select the best ten marker genes from among the selected twenty genes. we have ensured with repeated trials that these ten biomarkers {cdh <dig>  fgfr <dig>  ehd <dig>  lsp <dig>  fvt <dig>  fcgrt, nab <dig>  af1q, pms2l <dig>  hcls1} can do the intended job of classifying both training and blind test data with 100% accuracy. these ten genes are marked with asterisk in table  <dig>  we have then used the non-euclidean relational fuzzy c-means  clustering algorithm  <cit>  to cluster the twenty selected genes . we have not used euclidean distance to generate the dissimilarity relation for nerfcm because our objective is to eliminate positively correlated genes, if any, in the selected genes. note that, two highly correlated genes may have a higher distance than two uncorrelated genes. the dissimilarity relation, r, to be used for clustering is computed as a scaled version of pearson correlation coefficient matrix. the nerfcm algorithm is used to cluster this r into  <dig> clusters. the algorithm was run several times with different initializations. six subsets of genes are found to form consistently strong  of belonging to a cluster) clusters: {cdh <dig>  af1q, pms2l <dig>  the gene with image id 450152}, {est with image id  <dig>  hcls <dig>  ehd <dig>  hla-dqa1}, {lsp <dig>  igf <dig>  ccne1}, {nab <dig>  lgals3bp, bat <dig>  noe1}, {fgfr <dig>  sgca, est with image id 244618} and {fcgrt, fvt1}. this partition is found to be very consistent between different runs of the algorithm. we have also experimented with five clusters. typically, when nerfcm is used to find  <dig> clusters, the fourth and sixth clusters listed above are merged together. the following analysis reveals that with  <dig> clusters, the selection of genes becomes easy. for the first cluster the gene with image id  <dig> is not in the list of selected ten and the gene pms2l <dig> has the least gate opening in the list of ten genes, so we have removed both from the list. we have retained both cdh <dig> and af1q because their associated gates were significantly opened and the gate opening values were quite close. for the second cluster, the gene est with image id  <dig> and gene hla-dqa <dig> are not in the top ten and between hcls <dig> and ehd <dig>  gene hcls <dig> has a very low importance in terms of gate opening. so we have retained only ehd <dig>  from the third cluster we have retained only lsp <dig> because the other two genes, igf <dig>  ccne <dig>  are not in the list of top  <dig>  similarly, from the fourth cluster we have dropped three genes which are not in the list of top ten and we are left with only nab <dig>  from cluster five we have selected only gene fgfr <dig> as the other two are not in the list of top ten. the last cluster has two genes fcgrt, fvt <dig> both of which have made their positions in the top ten. although the gate opening values for both of them are high, their difference is also reasonably high. so, we have retained only gene fvt <dig> having the higher gate opening value. this brings the list of biomarkers to only  <dig> . these seven biomarkers can discriminate the four groups of tumors and we can design a neural network, which can categorize the training data as well as all blind test samples with 100% accuracy. the consistency of the selected genes has been further established through extensive experiments . through in-silico experiments, we have demonstrated that these seven genes form a necessary and sufficient set for accurate categorization. note that, because of the existence of correlated genes, this may not necessarily be the only possible such set. it is worth noting here that for the same data set, khan et al.  <cit>  reported  <dig> genes , while tibshirani et al.  <cit>  came up with  <dig> genes that are required for accurate categorization of the srbct groups. best result found in the literature suggests the need for at least  <dig> biomarkers  <cit> .

the nerfcm algorithm is used to find  <dig> clusters in the  <dig> genes selected in the first stage of the scheme. the partition obtained by the relational clustering and the results of stage two are combined to select just  <dig> marker genes.

the identified biomarkers are important in cancer biology
the set of seven genes that our system identified is involved in the biological process of cancer. for example, this set of seven genes includes an interesting gene nab <dig>  which neither khan et al.  <cit>  and nor fu & fu-liu  <cit>  had found important. typically, this gene is downregulated in various tumors. nab <dig> is a corepressor of egr  and its expression depends on tumor types and stages. for example, nab <dig> is often downregulated in prostate cancer but upregulated in malignant melanoma  <cit> . in our analysis we observed that nab <dig> is moderate to highly upregulated in ews and in a few cases of rms; while for the nhl and nb cases it is practically absent . interestingly, a search in geo profiles  also showed a moderate expression of nab <dig> in few cases of ewing sarcoma . thus, not only the involvement of nab <dig> in tumorigenesis but also its distinct signature in various types of tumors are singled out by our analysis.

eh domain containing  <dig>  is another novel gene in our list of biomarkers which others could not find important  <cit> . ehd <dig> protein is involved in endocytosis and trafficking of various membrane protein including mhc class proteins, insulin-growth factors and secretion of glucose transporter  <dig>   <cit> . although ehd <dig> has not been studied in the context of cancer biology, it seems to be highly expressed in metastatic colon cancer than in tumor of the colon as per the geo profiles . however, in ews , breast tumor  and in b-cell lymphoma  the gene expression is downregulated but slightly upregulated in rms . we observed that ehd <dig> upregulated in non-hodgkin lymphoma  and in a few cases of rms; while in a majority of rms and ews cases it is moderately expressed.

cdh <dig> belongs to the family of cell-cell adhesion molecules and mostly their reduced expression leads to tumor invasiveness  <cit> . loss of or impaired cell adhesion are important determinants in epithelial neoplasia  <cit> . in pancreatic cancer cdh <dig> expression is silenced  <cit> . we observed that cdh <dig> expression is practically absent in the ews and nhl groups of tumors, while for the nb class its expression varied from moderate to very high levels. for a few rms cases also it is found to be moderately expressed. this might be an indicator that plausibly cdh <dig> had either acquired mutation or protein truncation in rms. also a search in the geo profiles showed that cdh <dig> is largely downregulated in ews . therefore, it seems that cdh <dig> expression is tumor specific. and in case of srbct family of tumors cdh <dig> provides us a distinctive signature for categorizing the various tumor classes.

a fourth relevant gene inferred by our system to have class-specific signature is fibroblast growth factor receptor  <dig> . this tyrosine kinase receptor binds to fibroblast growth factor, a mitogenic ligand, and carry out the signal transduction to the intracellular environment in cellular proliferation, differentiation and migration  <cit> . in normal tissues, fgfr <dig> expression is hardly detectable. however, overexpression of fgfr <dig> has been shown in various cancers, including pituitary, prostate, thyroid  <cit> . in these cases either mutation in fgfr <dig>  or truncation in its protein was involved resulting in deregulated fgfr <dig> mediated signaling. however, in lung adenoarcinoma, fgfr <dig> is downregulated  <cit> . curation from geo profiles of ncbi also supports our observation that shows downregulation of fgfr <dig> in ews but moderate expression in rms . we observed that for the rms group, it is significantly upregulated but for nb, ews and nhl groups the fgfr <dig> expression is practically absent revealing a remarkable rms-specific signature.

the gene lsp <dig> is involved in transendothelial migration of neutrophil and actin cytoskeleton organization through mek <dig> and erk <dig> pathways  <cit> . we observed downregulation of lsp <dig> in ews, nhl and nb but reasonably higher expression in the rms group of tumors. interestingly, in diffuse large b-cell lymphoma  lsp <dig> is also very much downregulated . however, lsp <dig> expression has been found to increase in nhl class of b-cell lymphoma  <cit> . thus, lsp <dig> regulation is tumor class specific and useful for subcategorization of tumors.

the all1-fused gene from chromosome 1q  is known to play important roles in leukemia. in particular, it was detected as a mixed-lineage leukemia  fusion partner from infant acute myelomonocytic leukemia carrying the t translocation  <cit> . this mll fusion partner also plays an important role in acute myeloid leukemia . the expression level of af1q is shown to be correlated with the clinical outcome in pediatric patients with aml. the elevated expression of af1q is found to be an independent adverse prognostic factor in pediatric aml  <cit> . further af1q is found to be expressed in high metastatic potential breast cancer cells rather than low metastatic potential breast cancer cells and overexpression of af1q in the later cell renders it highly metastatic  <cit> . thus af1q plays important roles in different types of cancer. we found that af1q is very much downregulated for the nhl, ews and rms groups of tumors and is moderate to highly upregulated for the neuroblastoma group.

the gene fvt <dig> also an important one with cancer specific characteristic. its expression is practically absent for rms, nb and nhl groups of tumors, while for the ews group it is highly expressed signifying a very distinct tumor-specific signature.

the seven biomarkers can detect non-srbct samples
in the original srbct data set  <cit>  there were five non-srbct samples : two normal muscle tissues, three cell lines consisting of an undifferentiated sarcoma, an osteosarcoma, and a prostate carcinoma. it is surprising to note that for these five non-srbct examples almost all of the seven genes are downregulated . although, we did not use any non-srbct examples to decide on the biomarkers, our genes can detect non-srbct examples, at least for four samples in figure  <dig>  figure  <dig> has seven groups, each plotted using a different color. the seven groups correspond to seven selected genes { fgfr <dig>  af1q, nab <dig>  cdh <dig>  ehd <dig>  lsp <dig>  fvt1} in order. each group has five components one corresponding to each of the  <dig> non-srbct test cases. the test cases appear in this order : skeletal muscle tissue , prostate carcinoma , undifferentiated sarcoma , skeletal muscle tissue  and osteosarcoma . figure  <dig> shows that for the test case  <dig>  only nab <dig> is highly expressed. this example may be confused as ewing sarcoma. for the test case  <dig> , ehd <dig> is upregulated along with moderately expressed nab <dig>  this is not typical of the srbct classes. the upregulation of ehd <dig> and nab <dig> clearly reveals the cancer-specific characteristic signatures of the identified genes. this is also revealed by figure  <dig>  which displays the expression levels of different genes as an image for the five outliers.

simpler techniques may be used for easy diagnosis of srbcts with visual inspection
ews : moderate to high upregulation of nab <dig> or fvt <dig> and downregulation of other five genes.

nhl : very high upregulation of ehd <dig> and downregulation of other six genes.

nb : moderate to high upregulation of af1q and cdh <dig> and downregulation of fgfr <dig> and fvt <dig> 

rms : upregulation of fgfr  <dig> or lsp <dig> and downregulation of the fvt <dig> 

note that, in these  rules, the upregulation of a particular gene is associated with only one rule or group. this mutual exclusion further suggests that the set of identified biomarkers are essential.

another possibility would be to design specialized microarray chips. for example, one may design microarray chips only for these seven genes with replication. more specifically, chips with  <dig> × t probes, where each row will represent t probes for only one of the seven genes. thus, the expression level of each gene will be replicated t times in a row. this replication will make the visual assessment easy and will help to eliminate the effect of noise that is typically encountered in gene expression values. we think that  6– <dig> times replication of each probe would be enough for visual inspection because human eyes can easily perceive the contrast between lines with thickness of 6– <dig> pixels.

the identified biomarkers are universal in nature 
we want to emphasize that typically the discriminating ability of a feature or gene should be evaluated keeping in mind the machine learning tool that will be used to design the diagnostic system because the best set of genes for a neural network may not necessarily be the best for a decision tree or for nearest centroids classifiers. on the other hand, a set of good biomarkers should be able to do a good job of prediction using different machine learning tools. thus, if the selected set is essential and sufficient then it should have "universal" characteristics and hence should be able to do a good job with different tools. to assess this universal character, we evaluated the seven genes with rbf net  <cit> , support vector machines   <cit> , and the nearest centroid classifier. the rbf net with  <dig> gaussian nodes, each with a very low spread , can classify all  <dig> training examples as well as all  <dig> blind test examples correctly. note, that we did not optimize the net as each rbf node used the same spread. so, the set has an adequate discriminating power even for rbf network – this is a very desirable feature of good biomarkers. a rbf network even with just four nodes, one for each class, can classify all training examples correctly and makes two mistakes on the blind test data; while a rbf network with only five gaussian nodes, each with a very low spread of  <dig>   can classify all but one test example of the blind test data.

support vector machines finds a separating hyperplane between two classes either in the original input space or in some high dimensional projected feature space. for this four-class problem, we used one-vs-one  strategy which trains one classifier  for each pair of classes. then voting is used to decide the class label of a data point. use of gaussian  kernels with a very low spread for all svms results in zero error both on the training data as well as on the unseen test data. it is worth mentioning here that fu and fu-liu  <cit>  required nineteen  genes selected using and for svms to achieve zero training and test errors. this reconfirms the usefulness and universal characteristics of the identified biomarkers. note that, we use the word "essential and sufficient" with respect to a set as a whole and hence there could be other such sets. like any other data driven approach we assume that the training data set is representative of the four categories.

we have also analyzed the seven genes using unsupervised learning. in particular, we used the single linkage clustering algorithm to cluster the relation , where r is the pearson's correlation matrix between the samples, each sample is treated as a sequence and  <dig> is a  <dig> ×  <dig> matrix with each entry equal to unity . the four natural groups  found by single linkage algorithm match exactly with the four classes of the srbct .

discussion
we have identified a set of just seven genes using an online feature selection method based on neural networks and designed a diagnostic system that can classify both the training and unseen test examples with 100% accuracy. to establish that the selected marker genes indeed constitute a minimal set, we made  <dig> runs of for each possible subset of six genes from the set of selected genes. the networks are trained with the  <dig> training data points and tested with the same blind set of  <dig> examples. for each subset of six genes we report the maximum, minimum and the average number of misclassifications on the training as well as on the blind test data in table  <dig> 

the maximum, minimum and the average training and test errors obtained using mlp networks with all possible subsets of size six genes . with each combination of  <dig> genes, the network was trained  <dig> times with different initializations and the statistics are computed based on the results of these  <dig> trials

of the  <dig> trials, only in one run the error on the blind test data was zero. the average test error is quite high, the minimum value of the average test error rate is more than 20%. similarly, for the training data also the minimum value of the average training error is more than 10%. this suggests that if we remove any other gene from this set, we shall not be able to distinguish between the four categories of tumors.

to find how confident our network is in making decisions, we analyzed the output of a typical run of network for the blind test samples. for each example, each output node of the network produces a value between  <dig> and  <dig>  except for two blind test examples, the network produced almost crisp output . this signals that this case should be looked at more carefully, probably we should look for further information. due to nonavailability of the patient's identity, we could not make a follow up study on it. this test case is also one of the two cases that are confused by the nearest centroids classifier. a rbf network with just five gaussian nodes can yield zero training error and can classify correctly all but this example in the blind test set.

in order to make a fair comparison of performance of our method with other methods in the literature, we have used the same training-test partition as used by others and like others achieved 100% training and test accuracies. it may not always be possible to achieve such a high accuracy with classification of other types of cancer or even with new data sets for the same problem. in general, to avoid the dependency of the classifier on the particular training data set used , one should use multiple classifiers and then combine the outputs of the multiple classifiers. ensemble classification methods such as bagging  <cit> , boosting  <cit>  help us to reduce the classification error by reducing the variance.

khan et al.  <cit>  used pca and then used a single layer feed-forward network. they analyzed the sensitivity of the network output with respect to changes in the expression level  and used this information to rank the genes. they used  <dig> top ranked genes  because the training error was reduced to zero with  <dig> genes. we think, one of the reasons their method ended up having so many genes is that it used a single layer network that cannot capture nonlinear boundaries. the other reason may be that their gene selection method looked at one gene at a time and hence could not exploit possible subtle nonlinear interactions between genes. we have demonstrated that the same task can be done using the same tool with just seven marker genes. these seven genes are equally effective with other machine learning tools also. of these seven genes only four are included in the list identified by khan et al.

tibshirani et al.  <cit>  used a nearest centroid method with shrunken centroids. the nearest shrunken centroids method identifies subsets of genes that best characterize each class. this method shrinks the centroid of each class towards the overall centroid using the within-class standard deviation of each gene. a higher importance is given to a gene whose expression is stable within samples from the same class. as a result, many genes are effectively eliminated from the centroids. the shrunken centroid method yielded  <dig> genes that include only four of the genes identified by us.

ramaswamy et al.  <cit>  used support vector machine  for gene selection and multi-class cancer diagnosis. recently, fu and fu-liu  <cit>  applied the method of ramaswamy et al. on the srbct data set and could find a set of  <dig> genes that can yield zero training error but 90% accuracy on the blind test data.

then fu and fu-liu  <cit>  proposed a modified method based on svm for gene selection and classification. this method is also iterative in nature that finds the least important feature, eliminates it and reevaluates the rest. using the srbct data set, they came up with a set of nineteen  genes that can achieve 100% accuracy both on the training data and on the unseen test data samples. this list of  <dig> genes includes four of the marker genes identified by our method.

of the seven genes that we found, only four  are included in the set of genes identified by kahn et al.  <cit> , tibshirani et al.  <cit>  and fu and fu-liu  <cit> . the role of these four genes in cancer has been well demonstrated  <cit> . expressions of the remaining three genes  are either upregulated or downregulated in the various tumors and also in srbcts depending on the tumor subgroups  <cit> . it is worthwhile to discuss the role of these three genes in cancer biology. cancer is a sequential process, involving breaking off cells from the primary tumor sites, migration through bloodstream , and setting in new places of the organs. nab <dig> is a corepressor of transcription factor family egr  and inhibits cellular proliferation and growth. dysregulation of nab <dig> will involve unregulated activity of egr resulting in tumor growth  <cit> . the primary role of ehd <dig> is endocytosis and protein trafficking such as mhc class molecules that participate in antigen presentation and destruction of abnormal cells  <cit> . therefore, aberrant regulation of ehd <dig> likely would give rise to tumors. the gene lsp <dig>  on the other hand, plays an important part in transendothelial migration of tumor cells in the bloodstream and thus helps in cancer development  <cit> . it, therefore, appears that these three genes are involved in the tumor and cancer progression pathways. this does not necessarily mean that these genes will have the same discriminating power for all types of cancers. in order to find the best set of discriminating biomarkers for different cancers, one needs to use our scheme to analyze data on those types of cancer.

recently, lee et al.  <cit>  made an extensive study to compare three feature selection methods in conjunction with eleven classification schemes. these  <dig> methods include six classical methods like k-nearest neighbor, fisher's linear discriminant analysis and five tree methods such as cart, bagging, boosting. lee et al. used  <dig> top ranked genes to evaluate the performance of the  <dig> classifiers. the average accuracy on the test examples by the five classical methods varied between 11% to 37% while that for the tree methods varied between 1% to 37%. considering the performance of classifiers and the fact that authors used  <dig> genes, it is reasonable to conclude that all selected features were not biomarkers.

CONCLUSIONS
we proposed a computational intelligence based scheme for identification marker genes for distinguishing cancer subgroups and tested it on a well known data set on small round blue cell tumors. all methods that we have discussed identified between 19– <dig> biomarkers to classify the training and test data with 100% accuracy, while our method found only seven genes to do the same task with neural networks. these seven genes include three novel genes which are not found by other researchers. the main reason for this is that our method  looks at all genes together and picks up whatever is needed. the relational fuzzy clustering has helped to reduce the number of correlated genes. the genes identified by us are equally good with other tools like rbf network and svm, although they were identified keeping in view an mlp. even unsupervised clustering using these seven genes can discover the actual class structure. these seven genes bear distinct cancer specific attributes and as a group plays important roles in cancer biology. in this investigation although we have analyzed the srbcts, the proposed methodology can be used for knowledge discovery related to other diseases
