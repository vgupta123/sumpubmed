BACKGROUND
rabies is a viral zoonosis that causes fatal encephalitis in mammals. the lyssavirus genus includes  <dig> recognized species also referred to as genotypes: classical rabies virus , lagos bat virus , mokola virus , duvenhage virus , european bat lyssavirus type  <dig> , european bat lyssavirus type  <dig> , australian bat lyssavirus , irkut virus , west caucasian bat virus , khujand virus  and aravan virus   <cit> . shimoni bat virus  was recently ratified by the international committee on virus taxonomy  <cit> . furthermore, novel lyssaviruses have been detected in a natterer’s bat in germany, named as bokeloh bat lyssavirus   <cit> , which has subsequently also been found in france  <cit> , and ikoma lyssavirus  in an african civet   <cit> . a new tentative lyssavirus, lleida bat lyssavirus , was found in a bent-winged bat  in spain  <cit> .

since the first case of bat rabies in germany in  <dig>   <dig> cases of rabid bats have been reported in europe  <cit> . there have been about  <dig> cases of eblv- <dig>  which have occurred in five countries: switzerland  <cit> , the netherlands  <cit> , the uk  <cit> , germany  <cit>  and finland  <cit> . eblv- <dig> is typically detected in daubenton’s bat  and the pond bat , whereas the vast majority of eblv- <dig> detections have been from the serotine bat   <cit> . spill-over infections have been described for eblv- <dig> in a stone marten   <cit> , sheep  <cit>  and domestic cats  <cit> . selimov et al. reported a human case associated with a bat in russia in  <dig>  this virus was later shown to be eblv- <dig>  <cit> . two cases of eblv- <dig> infection in humans, both in individuals working with bats, have been confirmed: one in finland in  <dig>  <cit>  and one in the uk in  <dig>  <cit> .

in the uk, eblv- <dig> has been isolated from daubenton’s bats eight times  <cit> . in  <dig>  in a targeted surveillance of daubenton’s bats, a seroprevalence of  <dig> % to  <dig> % was detected. however, the virus was not detected from the  <dig> swabs tested  <cit> . a study from  <dig> to  <dig> revealed a seroprevalence of  <dig> % to  <dig> %  <cit> .

in switzerland, three out of  <dig> brains examined between  <dig> and  <dig> were found to be positive for eblv- <dig>  in targeted active surveillance in  <dig>  one oral swab from a daubenton’s bat out of  <dig> bats swabbed was positive for eblv- <dig> and three bats were seropositive  <cit> . in germany,  <dig> bats were tested between  <dig> and  <dig>  out of which  <dig> were daubenton’s bats and one a pond bat. eblv- <dig> was isolated in germany twice, first in  <dig>  <cit>  and then again in  <dig>  <cit> . in the netherlands,  <dig> suspected pond bats were analyzed and  <dig> were found to be positive for eblv- <dig>  resulting in a prevalence of  <dig> %  <cit> . . in the area of the former soviet union, more than  <dig> bats were analyzed for rabies during 1964– <dig> and five lyssavirus species were recorded  <cit> . virus-neutralizing antibodies have been found in a number of bat species in several european countries, but because of cross-reactivity, seropositivity cannot be linked to a specific lyssavirus  <cit> . eight daubenton’s bats sampled in  <dig> in southern sweden were seropositive when using eblv- <dig> as the antigen  <cit> . seropositive daubenton’s bats have also been found in the uk and switzerland  <cit> .

to date, thirteen species of bats have been recorded in finland out of  <dig> species present in europe  <cit> . all of them, apart from the northern bat , are at the northern-most limit of their range, and most of the species are restricted to southern and central finland. only five species are common in finland; the rest are either very rare or only a few individuals have been recorded so far   <cit> . the vast majority of the finnish bats are small, weighing c.  <dig> g, and insectivorous. despite an epidemiological study in finland in  <dig> of  <dig> bats,  <dig> of which were actively sampled and  <dig> dead, injured or abnormally behaving  <cit> , and subsequent passive rabies surveillance, rabies in bats was not detected in the country until a case in a daubenton’s bat was confirmed in autumn  <dig>  phylogenetic analysis revealed that the eblv- <dig> isolate from the human case in  <dig> and the isolate from the bat in  <dig> were genetically closely related, demonstrating that eblv- <dig> may have been circulating in finland for years  <cit> .

status categories for red list species are based on liukko et al. <cit> .

in this study we assessed the prevalence of eblvs in finnish bat populations in order to gain a better understanding of the public health risk that eblv-infected bats pose. in  <dig>  a targeted active surveillance project was initiated by the finnish food safety authority evira together with the university of turku and the finnish museum of natural history . the active sampling was focused on southwest finland, in the area where the eblv- <dig> positive bat was found in  <dig>  and on uusimaa, in the area where the deceased bat researcher had worked in  <dig> 

RESULTS
from the passive surveillance of  <dig> samples , all samples were negative, except for one positive daubenton’s bat in  <dig>  this positive case has been reported earlier  <cit> .

serum was analyzed from  <dig> bats of six species in  <dig> pools . blood samples were collected from  <dig> and  <dig> bats in  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. antibodies were detected from daubenton’s bats from two sampling sites in  <dig> in the city of turku  and in nauvo , and from one sampling site in  <dig> from the city of naantali . all the positive sites were from the same geographical area . the positive samples were from  <dig> to  <dig> individuals due to the pooling of samples. all seropositive bats were males. in the pool collected in  <dig> from turku, all individuals were adults and caught while flying. in the pool collected in nauvo, all bats were adults and they were caught in roosts. in the seropositive pool collected in  <dig> from naantali, one individual was an adult and two were juveniles, and they were caught while flying. altogether,  <dig> samples from daubenton’s bat were analyzed, resulting in a seroprevalence of  <dig> % to  <dig> %. a 95% confidence interval for the true prevalence of  <dig> –4% was calculated, as described by rogan and gladen  <cit> . no eblv rna was detected in any of the oropharyngeal swabs analyzed .

discussion
a working group of the european research consortium med-vet-net has established guidelines on passive and active bat rabies surveillance. this scheme was also adopted in eurobats resolution  <dig>  and in a scientific report submitted to the european food safety authority in  <dig>  <cit> . despite this, the surveillance of bat lyssaviruses varies considerably between european countries, as reviewed by schatz et al.  <cit> . in finland, an active surveillance project was initiated in order to complement passive surveillance after the first eblv- <dig> virus detection in a bat in  <dig>  we demonstrated that eblv- <dig> appears to be endemic in finland in the studied area.

passive surveillance of bat rabies might be a sufficient and relevant means for obtaining information on its occurrence in finland. however, the number of bats included in passive surveillance needs to be higher than during 1985– <dig>  and means to obtain more samples should be considered. in particular, more daubenton’s bat samples should be tested, as it has been shown that there is a significant correlation between the number of positive bats and the number of bats examined. thus, it appears that infected bats are more likely to be sampled  <cit> . daubenton’s bats do not usually roost in buildings, reducing the likelihood of property owners finding grounded bats. this might lead to lower passive sampling of this species. specimens of daubenton’s bats sent by the public to natural history museums and to laboratories are less numerous compared to species such as brandt’s bats  or northern bats , which commonly roost in house attics or other sheltered structures in buildings. it has been demonstrated that most positive samples are detected in the third quarter of the year  <cit> . in finland, passive surveillance samples are mostly sent between july and september.

active sampling of oral swabs has rarely resulted in positive findings, and our findings are consistent with this. over  <dig> samples have been tested in scotland and  <dig> samples in switzerland, with only one eblv- <dig> viral rna positive daubenton’s bat being found in each country. in spain,  <dig> e. isabellinus samples out of  <dig> samples analyzed were positive for eblv- <dig>  <cit> . new lyssaviruses have been found when many bats have been killed for surveillance purposes  <cit> , but invasive sampling is prohibited in europe according to council directive 92/43/eec on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora  and the agreement on the conservation of populations of european bats.

serological testing can be used as an indicator of past exposure to lyssavirus in bats. seropositive daubenton’s bats have been recorded in the uk, switzerland, sweden , and now in finland. results from our surveillance indicate that the seroprevalence of antibodies against bat lyssaviruses in the finnish bat population is low. all seropositive sampling sites exhibit high daubenton’s bat densities. the samples also represent individuals of the same large population, with high frequencies of gene flow between individuals of separate sampling sites  <cit> . the seroprevalence in bats of antibodies presumably against eblv- <dig> has been low, as in our study. however, the seroprevalence of antibodies against rabv in new world bats and against eblv- <dig> in spain have been relatively high . in an experimental infection, none of the daubenton’s bats infected with eblv- <dig> seroconverted  <cit> . on the other hand, in an experimental infection of north american big brown bats with eblv- <dig>  all bats seroconverted after intradermal infection. seroconversion appears to depend on the viral dose, bat species, route of exposure and the lyssavirus species infecting the bats  <cit> . the results of serosurveillance are not fully comparable because of differences in methods and antigens used, as well as in threshold values. using a reciprocal titer of  <dig> or more as a positive cut-off level may underestimate the actual number of eblv-seropositive bats, especially when samples have been pooled. furthermore, reducing the cut-off value of a serological assay results in an increase in sensitivity but a decrease in specificity.

the health risk to the general public, which has no contact with bats through work or leisure, is considered negligible. however, resident bat species in finland can be infected not only with eblv- <dig> but also with other lyssaviruses, including lyssaviruses that have not yet been identified. the most common bat species in finland is the northern bat , which has not been associated with lyssavirus infections. only a few observations of the species e. serotinus have so far been recorded in finland since the first specimen found in  <dig>  myotis dasycneme and m. nattereri are also very rare in finland. the distribution ranges of bats in finland are still poorly known due to the limited number of bat studies carried out in the country.

positive lyssavirus findings in finland are from daubenton’s bat. daubenton’s bat is a small, widespread and common eurasian bat species. it is considered a facultative seasonal migrant, covering middle-range distances between summer and winter roosts, often within a distance of 100– <dig> km  <cit> . studies have demonstrated that females, in particular, change their roost relatively often, usually after a few days  <cit> . factors that could enhance the maintenance of eblvs in bat populations include the mobility of many bat species, allowing a high level of gene flow. laine et al.  <cit>  observed no population structuring in a study of specimens from a broad geographical range in southern finland and the united kingdom, spain and switzerland. daubenton’s bats, like many other species of the myotis genus, live in fusion-fission colonies, where all the individual bats in the same roosting area form a loose colony, although no two individuals spend all their time together  <cit> . the fused colony is formed of a number of subgroups, because it is most likely that an entire colony is comprised of more bats than could fit into a single roost. fission occurs during roost switching, when subgroups break apart and mix, with the bats ending up in different roosts  <cit> . this allows bats to expand their social network and effectively increase their colony size without all colony members occupying the same roost. this has many ecological advantages, but also facilitates the effective spread of disease in an extended colony.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that bat lyssavirus infection appears to be endemic in the studied area in finland. passive surveillance of bat rabies might be a sufficient and relevant means for obtaining information on the occurrence of bat rabies in the country. results from our active surveillance in  <dig> and  <dig>  earlier active surveillance in  <dig> and ongoing passive surveillance indicate that the prevalence of eblv in the finnish bat population is low. the numbers of bats submitted in passive surveillance should, however, be higher, and means to obtain more samples should be considered. in finland, the health risk to the general public, which has no contact with bats through work or leisure, is still considered negligible.
