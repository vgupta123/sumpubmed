BACKGROUND
transposable elements  are dna sequences that have the ability to replicate within a genome using a variety of mechanisms  <cit> . they are present in almost all eukaryotic genomes, and they play an important role in genome evolution by creating genetic variation through their mobility  <cit> . although most new te insertions have a negative effect on the host's fitness, they significantly contribute to genome evolution  <cit> . tes can be divided into two classes based on their replication mechanism: retrotransposons  and dna transposons   <cit> . while retrotransposons use an rna intermediate for transposition, dna transposons use a dna intermediate. because of their replication mechanism retrotransposons are generally present in larger numbers than dna transposons, and can reach very high copy numbers. they also show a broader phylogenetic distribution  <cit> . retrotransposons can be further subdivided into two major classes based on whether they have long terminal repeat  sequences, i.e., ltr retrotransposons and non-ltr retrotransposons  <cit> . we here do not discuss non-ltr retrotransposons further.

ltr retrotransposons are similar to retroviruses  <cit>  and consist of a protein-coding region which is flanked by two ltr sequences. the ltr sequences regulate transcription and play important roles in the copying of the element's rna into dna. the protein coding region usually contains one or two open reading frames  which are similar to gag and pol genes from retroviruses. while the gag gene encodes proteins that form virus-like particles, the pol gene encodes various enzymatic activities like aspartic protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase. a small fraction of ltr elements additionally contains an env gene captured from retroviruses  <cit> , where this gene is important for the infectivity of the virus. in the few ltr elements where this gene occurs, it is usually non-functional  <cit> .

ltr retrotransposons can be further divided into four subclasses based on their sequence similarity and various structural features: ty1/copia, ty3/gypsy, bel/pao  and dirs  <cit> . most of the known ltr elements belong to the two large ty1/copia and ty3/gypsy subclasses. elements from these subclasses are present in almost all eukaryotic genomes and are already intensely studied. in contrast, the other two subclasses contain fewer elements and were identified only recently  <cit> . while elements from the ty1/copia, ty3/gypsy and dirs subclasses are widespread in eukaryotic genomes, bel/pao elements are only present in metazoan genomes, suggesting that they arose later in eukaryote evolution or that they have been lost  in several major eukaryotic lineages. even in animal genomes they do not show a continuous distribution. for example, no elements have been identified in mammals so far.

the evolutionary history of the bel/pao subclass is not well understood. more and more bel/pao elements are being reported in different genomes, which raises the question if the bel/pao subclass is really as small as previously assumed  <cit> . around  <dig> different bel/pao families in approximately  <dig> species have been reported and the number is still growing  <cit> . bel/pao elements are usually between  <dig> - <dig> kb long. they are flanked by ltr sequences that are  <dig> - <dig>  kb long  <cit> . bel/pao elements show the same domain arrangement as elements of the ty3/gypsy subclass and few bel/pao elements contain an env gene  <cit> .

contradictory evolutionary relationships for elements within the bel/pao subclass and for the relationship of the bel/pao subclass to the other three subclasses have been reported  <cit> . current research focuses mainly on the identification of new bel/pao elements in one genome of interest. for studying the evolutionary history of these elements, just a few elements from other organisms are typically added as outgroups  <cit> . the most comprehensive phylogenetic analysis thus far was carried out by copeland et al. , who analyzed the phylogenetic relationship of  <dig> different bel/pao elements. although these authors identified five distinct bel/pao lineages in insects, nematodes and vertebrates, namely tas, bel, pao, sinbad, and suzu  <cit> , no exhaustive analysis of the bel/pao subclass of ltr elements is available. here, we search for bel/pao elements in  <dig> non-mammalian metazoan and in  <dig> mammalian genomes. we use a de novo search approach to identify all bel/pao elements in this set of genomes. after separating the elements into families, we study the phylogenetic relationship between these families, and extend the current classification of bel/pao elements. an origin in very early metazoan evolution is often assumed for bel/pao elements, but no conclusive evidence exists. alternatively, bel/pao elements might have evolved later, only in a subset of metazoan genomes, and were then transmitted to other metazoan phyla by horizontal transfer. this might explain why, for example, no bel/pao elements are present in mammalian genomes. our sequence data allows us to address this possibility in a preliminary fashion.

RESULTS
element occurences
the majority of species whose genomes we analyzed belong to one of the three eumetazoan phyla nematoda, arthropoda and chordata. in all of these three phyla bel/pao elements had been identified previously. in contrast to previous work, we also had access to species from new superphyla and from the subkingdom parazoa. this allowed us to identify elements in these new metazoan clades as well. for example, no bel/pao element has been identified thus far in the subkingdom parazoa. we identified  <dig> bel/pao elements in the sponge amphimedon queenslandica, a member of this subkingdom. in addition, we identified new bel/pao elements in the cnidarian, echinoderm, and hemichordate phyla.

in total, we identified  <dig>  bel/pao elements in  <dig> of our  <dig> genomes, including  <dig> species where no bel/pao elements have been identified before. these elements include full length elements and fragments with a minimum length of  <dig>  base pairs. previous studies reported around  <dig> bel/pao families, but in most genomes the copy number of these families has not been reported  <cit> . our analysis thus is the first to determine the abundance of bel/pao elements in multiple genomes. the nucleotide sequences of all bel/pao elements are listed in additional file  <dig> 

variable abundance of elements
the abundance of bel/pao elements is highly variable between different species. nine of our  <dig> studied genomes do not contain any bel/pao elements, and  <dig> further species contain no more than ten elements. the relative majority of species  contain between eleven and  <dig> elements, and  <dig> species contain between  <dig> and  <dig> elements. only one species, the yellow fever mosquito aedes aegypti, harbors more than  <dig> elements . the number of bel/pao elements in each species' genome is listed in additional file  <dig> and in figure  <dig>  previous results reported that no bel/pao elements are present in mammalian genomes  <cit> . we could confirm this finding using eleven mammalian genomes which we analyzed in addition to the  <dig> genomes we just discussed .

because genome size can influence the abundance of elements in a species  <cit> , we compared the number of bel/pao elements per mega base pair  between species. additional file 3a shows a histogram of this ltr element density for the species we studied. the number of bel/pao copies ranges from less than  <dig>  copies per mbp in  <dig> species to  <dig>  copies per mbp in the fruit fly drosophila ananassae. most genomes contain fewer than one bel/pao element per mbp. only the mosquito and fruit fly genomes contain more. five species have between one to two copies per mbp. these are  the mosquito anopheles gambiae , the fruit flies drosophila virilis , drosophila melanogaster , the mosquito aedes aegypti , and the fruit fly drosophila yakuba . two fruit fly species have between two and three copies per mbps  and d. persimilis ). the species with the highest overall copy number  is not the species with the highest density of bel/pao elements. this observation can be explained by the fact that a. aegypti has, with  <dig>  gb, a more than  <dig> times larger genome than the mosquito and fruit fly genomes  <cit> . additional file 3b shows that the total copy number per species and the number of copies per mbps show a statistically significant association for the genomes we analyzed .

bel/pao elements are the second most abundant subclass of ltr retrotransposons
to evaluate how important bel/pao elements are as a genome constituent, we compared their abundance to that of the other three ltr element subclasses. figure  <dig> shows for each genome containing bel/pao elements the fraction of ltr elements that our de novo search identified, and that we were able to classify into one of the four ltr classes. bel/pao, ty1/copia, ty3/gypsy and dirs elements are represented by different shades of grey in the figure. ty1/copia and ty3/gypsy are commonly considered the most abundant ltr elements, but our analysis invalidates that pattern. although ty3/gypsy elements still are the most abundant class of ltr elements, they are followed by bel/pao elements, with ty1/copia a distant third. specifically, while ty3/gypsy elements constitute an average of  <dig>  percent of classifiable elements in a genome, bel/pao comprise  <dig>  percent, and ty1/copia elements contribute an average of  <dig>  percent. dirs elements are a distant fourth with  <dig>  percent, and they occur only in  <dig> genomes. in terms of absolute numbers, we identified  <dig>  ty3/gypsy elements,  <dig> bel/pao elements,  <dig> ty1/copia elements and  <dig> dirs elements. the roundworm brugia malayi is the only organism in which we only identified bel/pao elements  and no elements belonging to the other three classes. because our identification procedure of transposable elements purposedly excludes small element fragments, we cannot exclude that this organism may have contained elements from other families in the past. we also note that b. malayi is not the sole species containing only elements from one ltr subclass. for example, there are also  <dig> species which do not contain any bel/pao elements .

many different families
we next wished to group our identified bel elements into families based on their sequence similarity on the nucleotide level. to this end, we pursued a graph-based approach. the nodes in the graph we studied are bel/pao elements. edges represent sequence similarity between elements. the approach we pursued clusters the elements in the graph into families, using a fast and scalable unsupervised markov cluster algorithm  for graphs, which is based on the simulation of stochastic flow on graphs  <cit>  .

to validate the accuracy of our clustering approach, we first clustered only the bel/pao elements from the especially well-studied genome of d. melanogaster. we then compared our classification of the  <dig> d. melanogaster elements with  the annotation of elements in the genome sequence of d. melanogaster, and  the d. melanogaster elements in repbase update  <cit> . our approach resulted in the family classification shown in figure  <dig>  where the  <dig> bel/pao elements we identified form ten families labeled from a) to j). in this figure, each node represents an element and different node colors indicate different families. in the figure, we labeled elements in each family with the established names from the genome sequence , and with the name of the most similar repbase update element . our classification is identical to the previous classification of these elements, with the exception of one family. this family ) contains two elements belonging to the previously described ninja-dsim-like family, and one belonging to the aurora family. the other three elements in this family were not previously annotated. additionally, we find three more ninja-dsim-like elements that belong to the family in panel h) in our classification. in sum, the method we use classifies only one out of  <dig>  d. melanogaster bel/pao elements in a different family than previous annotations and divides one family. this low incidence of misclassification motivated us to apply the method to larger sets of elements.

we next applied our method to all  <dig>  bel/pao elements we had identified. this resulted in  <dig> families with at least two elements and  <dig> singletons. we assigned a unique identifier to each family, which we report in additional file  <dig>  most  families have ten or fewer member elements. only three families have more than  <dig> copies. one of these families is present in the fruit flies of the melanogaster subgroup . this family corresponds to the roo family which has been described earlier to have a high copy number in d. melanogaster  <cit> . the family with the second highest copy number  is present in the fruit fly d. ananassae, and that with the highest copy number  in the carolina anole anolis carolinensis, an arboreal lizard. these two families, however, do not share any similarity to families of known elements. table  <dig> shows the ten families with the highest copy number.

only  <dig> of the families  we identified are not restricted to one genome, but contain elements from different genomes. most  of these families occur in the drosophila melanogaster and obscura groups. four families have elements in two mosquito genomes and three families are distributed in the three nasonia wasps. all these families are therefore restricted to closely related species. in addition to the family classification we just described, which clusters elements regardless of which genome they occur in, we carried out an analogous classification, but separately for elements within each genome. the two classifications do not differ dramatically. additional file  <dig> describes the results of the species-specific classification.

phylogenetic relationship among bel/pao families
we next wanted to use our large data set to validate the existing classification of bel/pao elements into the previously identified superfamilies bel, tas, suzu, sinbad and pao. to this end, we used the protease, reverse transcriptase and integrase domains of each element. we constructed a consensus sequence for each domain in each of our element families or used the domain sequences themselves for elements that were singletons . we then used these  sequences to construct a multiple alignment of each of the domains using mafft  <cit>  . subsequently, we concatenated these alignments and constructed a phylogenetic tree from them using phyml_alrt  <cit> , a version of phyml  <cit>  that incorporates an approximate likelihood ratio test to estimate the statistical support of the tree topology. in this tree reconstruction, we included as outgroups the domains of the canonical sequence from the gypsy and copia elements from d. melanogaster, as given by repbase update  <cit> . the consensus sequences for each of the families and domains we identified are listed in additional file  <dig>  additionally, we provide the relevant alignments in additional file  <dig>  we defined superfamilies in this tree as major, deep-branching clades, which are easily identifiable based on the tree structure, and further discussed below. the complete phylogenetic tree is shown in figure 4a, and in additional file  <dig> with partly collapsed clades, and representative species names assigned to branches. figure 4b shows an additional version of the tree with collapsed major clades. in figure 4b the triangles represent the divergence between the elements within each major clade, with long triangles indicating great divergence. numbers next to tree branches indicate the statistical support for a clade ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . figure 4c shows the same tree for the purpose of comparing it to previously proposed phylogenetic trees of bel/pao elements. for clarity, this panel does not show the divergence within each major clade, and the order of the branches is reorganized to ease the comparison to these previous phylogenetic trees   <cit> . to avoid confusion, we note that if we refer to bel/pao elements below, we mean the entire subclass of ltr elements we studied. if we refer to only bel or pao elements, we mean the bel and pao superfamilies, respectively.

previous studies identified five different superfamilies of bel/pao elements which are named after the first identified element in the subclade: bel  <cit> , tas  <cit> , suzu  <cit> , sinbad  <cit>  and pao  <cit> . two previous phylogenetic studies both found that bel and tas elements formed one clade and sinbad and pao another one. in both studies, suzu elements alone formed a third clade  <cit> . however, the trees that emerged from these two studies differ in one major way. copeland et al. identified elements belonging to the suzu superfamily as more distantly related to the other four clades than these clades are to each other   <cit> . in contrast, the study by llorens et al. grouped the suzu superfamily with the pao/sinbad clade   <cit> .

two new superfamilies of bel/pao elements
our phylogenetic analysis shows some similarities to the previous studies. for example, we find that pao and sinbad form part of the same clade as do bel and tas. similar to what copeland et al.   <cit>  reported, the elements from the suzu family are more distantly related to the other clades than these clades to each other. however, there are two major differences. first, we found that the pao superfamily groups into two separate clades . we kept the name pao for the larger of these clades, because it contains the original pao element identified in bombyx mori  <cit> . we propose the new name dan for the second, smaller clade, because we have identified it in the zebrafish danio rerio, and it currently only contains elements from this organism. second, we identified a new superfamily , for which we propose the name flow. table  <dig> shows the number of families and elements per superfamily and additional file  <dig> the minimal, maximal, and median element and ltr sequence lengths for each superfamily. we note that we could have classified our data into many more superfamilies, but our aim was not to proliferate the number of superfamilies unnecessarily, while preserving previous classifications as much as possible. fortunately, the clear partitioning of our family tree into few major clades made this task easy and unambiguous. we also note that our phylogenetic analysis is based on more than  <dig> times more sequence data than previous analyses.

distribution of superfamilies
the number of species and phyla covered by each superfamily is shown in table  <dig> and a list of phyla covered by each superfamily can be seen in additional file  <dig>  some superfamilies are restricted to one phylum. the dan and pao superfamilies have the most restricted host range and occur only in the fish danio rerio and in arthropods, respectively. pao elements occur mainly in the different drosophila and mosquito genomes, with the exception of a few elements that are present in the parasitoid wasp nasonia vitripennis.

other superfamilies are present in different phyla and in a wider range of host organisms. an example is the tas superfamily, which is present in cnidaria, nematoda, arthropoda, hemichordata, and porifera. it also occurs in different host organisms within all phyla, e.g., in almost all our nematode genomes . some superfamilies are present in a wide range of phyla but all species are restricted to a certain habitat type, such as aquatic habitats for the suzu superfamily.

we note that our study is the first to identify elements of the bel/pao subclass in the subkingdom parazoa. these elements fall into the bel and tas superfamilies.

elements of the flow superfamily
the five families belonging to the new superfamily we discovered are all present in lower animals that live in aquatic habitats, hence the name flow. one of flow's families occurs in the starlet sea anemone nematostella vectensis , and two families occur in the fresh water hydra hydra magnipapillata . both species belong to the phylum cnidaria. we found the other two families in the planarian schmidtea mediterranea , phylum platyhelminthes. the elements are between  <dig> to  <dig> base pairs long with an average of  <dig> base pairs.

the five families of the flow superfamily are not highly similar to one another. specifically, the amino acid similarity ranges from  <dig>  percent between the consensus sequence of n. vectensis and one of the consensus sequences from s. mediterranea, to  <dig>  percent between the two consensus sequences from s. mediterranea. the average similarity is with  <dig>  the second lowest similarity within a superfamily. the average similarity to the other bel/pao superfamilies varies from  <dig>  percent  to  <dig>  percent .

highly similar elements in closely related species
we used blastn <cit>  to compare each bel/pao element against all other  <dig>  elements to search for possible signs of horizontal transfer of bel/pao elements between our studied species. if an element is only transferred vertically from parent to offspring, we expect to find no high similarity between elements from distantly related species. in contrast, highly similar elements occurring in very distantly related species might indicate horizontal transfer of an element between these species. in this analysis, we required an identity of at least  <dig> percent over at least  <dig> percent of the length of an element, but at least over  <dig> bp. this criterion is a liberal threshold for recent transfer events and allows for some divergence of sequence since the transfer. using this criterion, we found no signs of similar sequences in very different species. the only similar sequences in different species occurred in closely related species within the same genus, i.e., in fruit flies of the genus drosophila, in parasitoid wasps of the genus nasonia, and in roundworms of the genus meloidogyne.

previous work had identified a horizontal transfer of a bel element between the fly drosophila ananassae and the endosymbiont wolbachia  <cit> . motivated by this observation, we attempted to identify further possible horizontal transfers to endosymbiont genomes and viruses through a blast search  <cit>  of our consensus sequences for the concatenated protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase domains for each of the seven superfamilies against the non-redundant protein and nucleotide databases of genbank. the bel element in the endosymbiont wolbachia was the only one we found, suggesting that such horizontal transfer is not widespread for bel/pao elements.

discussion
many bel/pao elements in metazoan genomes
we identified  <dig>  bel/pao elements in  <dig> out of our set of  <dig> non-mammalian metazoan genomes. this is the first time genome-wide abundances of bel/pao elements are reported. previous studies identified around  <dig> families of bel/pao elements but in most cases the copy number of a family was not reported. the genomes we studied span a wider range of species than previously analyzed for bel/pao elements, and so does the distribution of bel/pao elements we identified. for example, we were able to identify  <dig> bel/pao elements in the sponge amphimedon queenslandica, a species belonging to the metazoan subkingdom parazoa. all previous bel/pao elements had only been identified in the subkingdom eumetazoa. previous studies reported the lack of bel/pao elements in mammalian genomes  <cit> . we screened eleven mammalian genomes for bel/pao elements but did not identify any elements. this observation supports the view that bel/pao elements are not present in mammalian genomes. this might be explained by stochastic loss of bel/pao elements in early mammalian evolution. alternatively, the bel/pao subclass might only have originated after the origin of the mammalian clade. however, the presence of bel/pao elements in species belonging to both metazoan subkingdoms makes this unlikely. most previous studies identified bel/pao elements in the three phyla nematoda, arthropoda and chordata. most of our elements also come from these three phyla because  <dig> of our  <dig> sequenced genomes belong to these phyla. we identified bel/pao elements in  <dig> of these genomes , including  <dig> genomes where, to our knowledge, no bel/pao elements had been identified so far. this shows that bel/pao elements are more abundant than previously thought. we found bel/pao elements in seven of the remaining nine genomes, which do not belong to either of the three phyla nematoda, arthropoda and chordata. in two of these seven species no bel/pao elements had been identified so far. the wide distribution of bel/pao in different metazoan phyla and the occurrence in both metazoan subkingdoms makes it likely that bel/pao elements evolved during early metazoan evolution.

the number of bel/pao elements we identified in different species varies from zero to more than  <dig>  copies in a. aegypti. the high number in a. aegypti is not surprising because the genome of this species is with  <dig>  gb our largest studied non-mammalian genome, and it has been previously reported that more than  <dig> percent of the a. aegypti genome consists of transposable elements  <cit> . more generally, transposable elements in a. aegypti are a major factor for its genome size increase compared to related mosquito and fruit fly species  <cit> . the reason why we find such a big difference in the abundance of bel/pao elements in some species remains unknown .

several factors may influence variation in te numbers. they include stochastic loss of transposable elements  <cit> , transposition bursts in response to environmental stressors  <cit> , and differences in effective population sizes that render selection against the deleterious effects of transposable elements more or less effective  <cit> . additionally, we note that our transposable element identification approach might only give a lower bound for the number of bel/pao elements in a genome. the reason is that genome sequences differ in their quality. many genomes are represented by many small sequence contigs instead of one sequence per chromosome. this might prevent the identification of some elements at the end of a sequence contig. however, we note that this cannot be the only cause for the differences we find. for example, the genome sequences of a. aegypti and d. melanogaster are available as contigs with a median length of  <dig> kb and  <dig>  kb, respectively. even though the genome of d. melanogaster has longer contigs than a. aegypti, it contains fewer bel/pao elements .

overall, bel/pao elements are the second most abundant class of ltr retrotransposons in the genomes we studied, a pattern that also holds for most of our study genomes individually. only elements belonging to the ty3/gypsy class are, on average, more abundant. by comparison, ty1/copia and dirs elements account for only a small fraction of ltr retrotransposons . only some genomes, such as that of brugia malayi and the two nasonia species, show a different distribution of ltr element classes. b. malayi, a causative agent of the tropical disease lymphatic filariasis, contains only bel/pao elements and no elements from the other classes. the nasonia species on the other hand, harbor all four classes and bel/pao elements are only the third most abundant class . our observations are broadly consistent with previous studies. for example, one study in a. gambiae  <cit>  and one in b. mori  <cit>  report the ty3/gypsy class to be the most abundant ltr class in these two organisms, followed by bel/pao and ty1/copia. another study focused on ltr elements in c. elegans  <cit> , and it found the bel/pao class to be the most abundant, followed by the ty3/gypsy class. it did not identify any ty1/copia elements  <cit> . our results agree with this finding.

while previous studies concentrated on elements from one species, we analyzed elements from multiple species. however, our data set still only represents a small fraction of all metazoan species. the ncbi's genome sequencing project site lists  <dig> non-mammalian metazoan genomes as "in progress" http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/leuks.cgi. some of these species cover phyla which have not been studied so far with respect to bel/pao elements. therefore, the results of our study will likely be extended with every new genome release.

a ten-fold increase in family number
we clustered our bel/pao elements into  <dig>  families  which is more than a ten-fold increase in family number compared to the approximately  <dig> bel/pao families known so far. part of this increase can be explained by the  <dig> families identified in the  <dig> previously not analyzed genomes. however, the bulk of this increase in family number comes from newly identified families in previously studied species. for example, we identified two previously unknown families with a copy number of more than  <dig> elements.

one potential explanation for the high family number might be that our clustering approach divided the elements from one species into too many small families. however, our analysis of the well-studied and well-annotated fruit fly d. melanogaster genome argues against this possibility. this analysis finds that the ten families we identify are largely congruent with previous annotation. the only exception are elements belonging to the ninja-dsim-like family . our clustering approach divided this family into two families. additionally in one of the two ninja-dsim-like families, we find an element from the aurora family. however, this change in annotation affects only one in  <dig> elements . the aurora element is the only element of that family in d. melanogaster, raising the possibility that one of the ninja-dsim-like elements was falsely annotated as an aurora element. indeed, the alignment of all annotated ninja-dsim-like elements in d. melanogaster shows a high average sequence divergence  and the aurora element is very similar to large parts of some of the ninja-dsim-like elements.

overall, the comparison of our families to the previously annotated tes in d. melanogaster shows that our clustering does not separate the elements into too many small families. our approach correctly classified  <dig> out of  <dig> elements. we therefore believe that the high number of bel/pao families we identified is a faithful reflection of actual bel/pao element diversity.

major subclades separated early
previous studies, which were based on fewer than  <dig> bel/pao elements, identified five superfamilies of bel/pao elements: pao, sinbad, bel, tas and suzu  <cit> , named after the first element identified in each superfamily. our phylogenetic tree is based on  <dig> bel/pao families and it also identified these five known superfamilies. additionally we found one completely new superfamily , and a deep separation of the pao superfamily into the two highly divergent superfamilies pao and dan.

we separated the dan superfamily from the sinbad superfamily for two reasons. first, one element from the dan clade was previously annotated to belong to the pao superfamily. in contrast, we find that the dan clade is more closely related to the sinbad superfamily. the best way to resolve this conflict, in our view, is to propose dan as a second superfamily. second, because the sinbad superfamily also contains elements from danio rerio, the dan clade is not simply a subbranch of the sinbad superfamily that contains all elements from danio rerio. in sum, we think that the dan clade should be viewed as a separate superfamily. it is very likely that new elements of this superfamily will be identied in genomes that we did not study.

the superfamily tree topology we find differs somewhat from previously reported topologies  <cit> . we find a very high statistical support for our tree topology . this high support makes it unlikely that our tree topology is not correct, especially as it is also supported by many more sequences than any of the previous studies. additionally the average sequence similarity of elements within one superfamily almost always shows greater amino acid sequence similarity than elements in different superfamilies, which supports our classification into superfamilies.

most  of our families belong to the pao or bel superfamily. this is not surprising because these superfamilies are mainly restricted to arthropod genomes and  <dig> of our genome sequences  belong to this phylum. the other five superfamilies show a more diverse distribution of host genomes. here, the host genomes come from more than one phylum and, for the tas and bel superfamily, even from both metazoan subkingdoms.

the variation in the host species range that we observe has several candidate explanations that our data cannot resolve. on the one hand, bel/pao superfamilies might have been lost in some phyla. on the other hand, horizontal transfer of bel/pao elements between species belonging to different phyla might be at work. for example, if bel/pao elements originated in the eumetazoa, a horizontal transfer event to amphimedon queenslandica might explain the presence of bel/pao elements in the parazoa. we did not find any evidence of recent horizontal transfer between distantly related species, because no such species contain highly similar bel/pao elements. this, however, does not exclude the possibility of ancient horizontal transfer events. to identify such transfer events is beyond the scope of our study. but regardless of whether element loss or horizontal transfer explains the current bel/pao element distribution, bel/pao elements probably originated early in metazoan evolution. this is because bel/pao elements occur in both metazoan subkingdoms, and in a wide range of host species from different phyla.

flow, a new superfamily of bel/pao elements
we found a new bel/pao superfamily  which consists of five families and a total of  <dig> elements present in lower animals. we identified three of these families in two species belonging to the phylum cnidaria , and the other two families in a species belonging to the phylum platyhelminthes . in both phyla, cnidaria and platyhelminthes, only eleven and two bel/pao elements, respectively, had been identified before  <cit> . the five flow families are quite diverse . this is not surprising, because they occur in very distantly related species. the new superfamily supports and strengthens the view that bel/pao elements arose in early metazoan evolution, because none of its families are present in one of the three well studied phyla nematoda, arthropoda, and chordata.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified  <dig>  bel/pao elements in  <dig> metazoan genomes, making the bel/pao elements the second most abundant class of ltr retrotransposons in metazoan genomes. the elements we identified can be divided into  <dig>  families based on the similarity of their nucleotide sequence. our analysis increases the number of known bel/pao families by more than ten-fold. these families can be separated into seven superfamilies based on their phylogenetic relationship. five of these superfamilies have been known previously, one new superfamily emerges from a highly divergent existing superfamily, and one superfamily is completely new. bel/pao elements are present in both metazoan subkingdoms, which suggests that they arose during early metazoan evolution.
