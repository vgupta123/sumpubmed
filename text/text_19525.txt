BACKGROUND
chip-chip  and chip-seq are widely-used genomic methods that combine chromatin immunoprecipitation  with microarrays and deep sequencing, respectively, to map protein-dna interactions in vivo <cit> . the genome-wide binding profiles of hundreds of proteins have been mapped using chip-chip and chip-seq in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. chip-chip/chip-seq often identifies non-canonical target regions for dna-associated proteins, i.e. target regions that are inconsistent with our current understanding of the protein being studied. in many cases, these discoveries have provided new insight into the function of those proteins. in bacteria, many transcription factor  binding sites identified using chip-chip/chip-seq are located in “unexpected” genomic regions:  upstream of genes whose described function is seemingly unconnected to the described function of the tf  <cit> ,  upstream of genes whose expression does not change detectably when the tf-encoding gene is mutated  <cit> ,  inside genes  <cit> , and  far from any dna sequences that are close matches to the known consensus binding site  <cit> . in most cases, the significance of these observations is unclear, although they suggest that  gene annotations are often incomplete,  tfs often function redundantly, such that expression of the regulated gene does not change unless multiple tf-encoding genes are deleted,  tfs often regulate the expression of non-coding rnas that initiate within genes  <cit> , and  tfs often bind dna cooperatively such that the dna sequence requirements are altered or relaxed.

our published chip-chip study of σ <dig>  an alternative σ factor in e. coli, led to the identification of  <dig> putative σ <dig> binding sites within genes  <cit> . these represent ~25% of all the σ <dig> binding sites we identified. all but  <dig> of the gene-internal promoters are >300 bp from an annotated translation start codon. we proposed that rna polymerase  associated with σ <dig>  often binds to promoter elements within genes and initiates transcription of non-coding rnas in either the sense or antisense orientation. we confirmed this for three examples that we examined in more detail. furthermore, five of the σ <dig> binding sites within genes are immediately adjacent to genes identified in previous studies as being upregulated by σ <dig>  but for which no promoter could be identified in the upstream region  <cit> . our chip-chip data also permitted identification of  <dig> σ <dig> binding sites in intergenic regions,  <dig> of which are not associated with genes identified in either of two transcriptomic studies of σ <dig> <cit> . thus, many of the sites of σ <dig> association we identified are non-canonical.

in a recent study published in this journal, waldminghaus and skarstad describe modifications to the standard chip-chip procedure  <cit> . the key modifications are avoiding the use of spin-x filter columns during immunoprecipitation  wash steps, including an rnase treatment following the ip, and collecting reference material after the ip rather the traditional “input” starting chromatin. waldminghaus and skarstad propose that the standard chip-chip method results in identification of false positives that are eliminated when using the modified method. waldminghaus and skarstad demonstrated their modified chip-chip procedure by performing chip-chip of e. coli σ <dig>  they identified many fewer target regions for σ <dig> than our earlier study. we will refer to the  <dig> σ <dig> target regions identified in our previous study but not by waldminghaus and skarstad as “disputed σ <dig> targets” . dsts are enriched for non-canonical σ <dig> binding sites. specifically,  <dig> of the  <dig> dsts are located inside genes or between convergently transcribed genes, and  <dig> dsts are located in intergenic regions but are not associated with genes identified in transcriptomic studies of σ <dig> <cit> . we have reanalyzed our published chip-chip datasets and those of waldminghaus and skarstad. this reanalysis demonstrates low reproducibility in the datasets of waldminghaus and skarstad. we also used targeted chip/qpcr to directly compare the standard and modified chip methods. we demonstrate that non-canonical targets of σ <dig> are real and that the lower data quality and deficiencies in the modified chip method are sufficient to explain the absence of dsts in the list of σ <dig> targets generated by waldminghaus and skarstad.

RESULTS
existing evidence that dsts are genuine sites of σ <dig> association
waldminghaus and skarstad suggest that dsts are artifacts that result from non-specific ip of rna that is then amplified by klenow dna polymerase during sample preparation for chip-chip  <cit> . however, there are several features of dsts that are consistent with them being genuine sites of σ <dig> association and inconsistent with them being artifacts resulting from amplification from rna:

 nine of the dsts  are σ <dig> targets identified in independent studies that did not involve chip  <cit> . with the exception of the dsts inside yfjn and recf, these would all be considered canonical σ <dig> binding sites, i.e. located in an intergenic region upstream of a gene known from previous studies to be transcribed by σ <dig> <cit> .

 our previous study included validation of three non-canonical dsts  using chip/qpcr  <cit> . this method does not involve amplification of chip dna using klenow dna polymerase. furthermore, we demonstrated heat shock-dependent increases of σ <dig> association with all three regions  <cit> .

 although many dsts are located inside genes, there are significantly more dsts located in intergenic regions than expected by chance .

note that, for all the analyses described herein, we have excluded the two dsts that are located in repetitive sequence .

comparison of data quality between our data and those of waldminghaus and skarstad
the disparity between the σ <dig> targets identified in the two studies led us to compare the quality of the chip-chip data. for each dataset we used an established method to estimate the null distribution of chip-chip signals  <cit> . specifically, we determined the modal value and used the probes with scores at or below this value to fit a normal distribution. using this fitted normal distribution we determined the mean and standard deviation of the null distribution. this allowed us to calculate z-scores  for each microarray probe, thus providing a measure of dynamic range that is independent of the absolute chip-chip signals, which have arbitrary units. scatter plots of z-scores for the duplicate datasets from each study are shown in figure 1a-b. these scatter plots demonstrate several key features of the datasets from each study:

 the two replicate datasets for our study correlate very well  whereas those of waldminghaus and skarstad correlate less well .

 one of the datasets of waldminghaus and skarstad has a substantially lower dynamic range than the other. several of the targets identified in both studies have z-scores within the noise for this replicate.

 although the dynamic range of one waldminghaus and skarstad dataset is high, the vast majority  of the probes have z-scores lower than  <dig>  suggesting that these datasets are effective at identifying strong protein-dna interactions but not weaker interactions.

 although they were not called as targets, dsts have significantly higher z-scores for the datasets of waldminghaus and skarstad than expected by chance .

we conclude that our chip-chip data are of substantially higher quality with respect to both dynamic range and reproducibility. figure 1c-h shows normalized chip-chip data for replicate datasets from both studies for six selected genomic regions. these data further demonstrate the differences in reproducibility and dynamic range between the two studies. the genomic regions shown include dsts and non-canonical targets .

several factors likely contribute to the difference in data quality between the two studies. first, we used a tap-tagged derivative of σ <dig> whereas waldminghaus and skarstad used an antibody raised against the native protein. second, our heat shock conditions  were different to those of waldminghaus and skarstad . third, as described below, the modifications to the chip method reduce the sensitivity of the assay.

chip/qpcr validation of dsts
we used chip/qpcr with the standard and modified chip methods to measure association of σ <dig> with four dsts in cells before and after heat shock. as a positive control, we measured association of σ <dig> with the region upstream of dnak, a well-established σ <dig> target  <cit>  identified both in our study and that of waldminghaus and skarstad. we used cells expressing an n-terminally flag-tagged copy of σ <dig> expressed from its native locus . using the standard chip method, we observed significant association of σ <dig> with all regions tested and a significant increase in σ <dig> association with all regions tested following heat shock . previous chip-seq studies have revealed biases in the level of some genomic regions in input dna, the most common control sample for chip experiments  <cit> . in the case of chip-chip, this bias is likely to be due to nucleosomes, and is hence specific to eukaryotes  <cit> . nevertheless, we wished to rule out the possibility that dsts were identified as a result of input biases. therefore, we repeated the chip/qpcr using an untagged strain. we observed no significant chip/qpcr signal for any region tested . we conclude that all four dsts tested are genuine sites of σ <dig> binding.

we compared the standard chip method with the modified method proposed by waldminghaus and skarstad. importantly, chip with the modified method used the same sonicated, cross-linked cell extracts as the standard method. using the modified method, we detected significant σ <dig> association with the region upstream of dnak , and association increased significantly following heat shock . however, the absolute chip signal was substantially lower than that observed using the standard chip method . thus, the modified chip method has a decreased sensitivity relative to the standard method. using the modified chip method we detected significant association of σ <dig> following heat shock with three of the four dsts tested . we also observed a significant reduction in σ <dig> association in the absence of heat shock at two of these dsts . thus, even with the decreased sensitivity of the modified chip method, three of the four dsts tested were validated as genuine sites of σ <dig> association. we believe that we were unable to detect significant association of σ <dig> with the fourth dst, ybjx, due to the substantial decrease in sensitivity relative to the standard chip method. we note that the chip signal for ybjx was the lowest of all the regions tested using the standard method . we conclude that the reduced sensitivity of the modified chip method prevented waldminghaus and skarstad from identifying dsts as sites of σ <dig> association. this is consistent with the observation that dsts have above average chip-chip scores in the waldminghaus and skarstad datasets .

as an independent assessment of σ <dig> association with dsts, we measured association of core rnap  with dnak and the four dsts described above, with and without overexpression of σ <dig> from a plasmid. association of β with dnak and two dsts was significantly higher in cells overexpressing σ <dig> as compared to those with empty vector . this provides independent validation of the association of σ <dig> with these regions. two of the dsts tested showed no significant difference in the association of β between cells overexpressing σ <dig> and those with empty vector. in the case of ybjx, we propose that the lack of increase in rnap levels is due to the relatively low association of σ <dig> . thus, association of rnap:σ <dig> may not significantly increase the overall association of rnap in the presence of a relatively high level of rnap that is independent of σ <dig> . consistent with our chip/qpcr data, ybjx expression was not detectably increased by σ <dig> overexpression in two transcriptomic studies  <cit> . in the case of tdk/ychg, we propose that rnap:σ <dig> binds this region specifically during heat shock but not following σ <dig> over-expression without heat shock, perhaps due to the requirement for other heat shock-induced/activated proteins.

chip method comparison for arac
the comparison of the chip methodologies described above demonstrates that the modified chip method is less sensitive. there are multiple changes to the standard method, so it is unclear which specific change results in the decreased sensitivity. one significant change in the method described by waldminghaus and skarstad is the omission of spin-x columns during the ip wash steps. we directly assessed the importance of spin-x columns by measuring association of arac  with target regions in e. coli using chip/qpcr performed either with or without spin-x columns. the use of spin-x columns increased the chip/qpcr signal for all regions tested but qualitatively the data are the same for both methods . importantly, we detected association of arac with a non-canonical target within the dcp gene using both methods . this site of arac association is hundreds of base pairs from either end of the gene and there is no detectable change in transcription of dcp or association of rnap at this region following deletion of arac and/or addition of arabinose . thus, the spin-x column-free chip method detects association with non-canonical target regions, although association with all target regions is reduced relative to the standard chip method. in a control experiment using an untagged strain, we observed no significant chip/qpcr signal  for any region tested .

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that waldminghaus and skarstad failed to identify dsts not because of an improvement in the chip methodology, but because of lower data quality. consistent with this, the majority of dsts showed relatively low association of σ <dig> in our study: when ranked by the level of σ <dig> association,  <dig> of the bottom  <dig> targets are dsts   <cit> . furthermore, dsts have significantly higher signal in the waldminghaus and skarstad datasets than expected by chance , consistent with the idea that these regions represent true binding sites for σ <dig> but fall below the detection threshold of this analysis. we note that waldminghaus and skarstad did not present any σ <dig> chip data generated using the standard methodology, precluding direct comparison of our work, nor did they use chip/qpcr with their modified method to measure association of σ <dig> with specific target regions  <cit> . furthermore, waldminghaus and skarstad demonstrated a dramatic improvement in chip-chip data for seqa using the modified chip method  <cit> , but their data is very similar to that generated using the standard chip method by another group  <cit> .

our comparison of chip-chip datasets highlights the importance of data quality for correct identification of protein-dna interactions. guidelines for chip-chip and chip-seq experimental and analytical approaches have been described previously  <cit> . key components of these methods that are especially relevant to our own study are the comparison of replicates, the choice of control, and the importance of repetitive sequence. current guidelines for chip-seq recommend the use of only two independent biological replicates  <cit> , but also stress the importance of reproducibility. as shown in figure 1b, the poor reproducibility of the waldminghaus and skarstad datasets is likely to be a major cause of their failure to identify dsts as regions truly bound by σ <dig>  recommended controls are either input dna or chip-enriched dna from an untagged strain . waldminghaus and skarstad instead used dna left in the supernatant after the initial ip, acknowledging that this dna would be de-enriched for target regions. while this may increase the apparent signal, we caution against this approach as the chip-chip or chip-seq signals may not accurately reflect the actual level of binding. finally, waldminghaus and skarstad highlighted the importance of treating repetitive dna sequences with caution when interpreting chip-chip  datasets. in the case of σ <dig>  two of the chip peaks identified in our earlier study overlap repetitive regions. it is impossible to determine from chip-chip data alone whether σ <dig> associates with one or all of the repetitive regions. since this caveat applies to repetitive sequences in any chip-chip or chip-seq experiment, we echo the sentiment expressed by waldminghaus and skarstad and caution against analysis of sequences in these regions.

many chip-chip studies have revealed the existence of unexpected protein-dna interactions. for example, chip-chip studies in bacteria have demonstrated that transcription factors often bind to sites within genes, sites without a recognizable motif, and sites that are not associated with described regulation by the transcription factor  <cit> . this is one of the great strengths of chip-chip and chip-seq, since these non-canonical binding sites often cannot be identified using other genomic approaches such as transcription profiling. in the case of σ <dig>  our data provide strong evidence that rnap:σ <dig> initiates transcription of many rnas from within genes, and our original study described three such examples in greater detail  <cit> . the function of intragenic transcripts in bacteria is poorly understood, although several antisense transcripts have been shown previously to regulate expression of the overlapping mrna  <cit> . our own studies have revealed pervasive antisense transcription in e. coli <cit> , and this has since been observed in several other bacterial species  <cit> . intriguingly, many chip-chip studies of bacterial dna-binding tfs have revealed sites of association inside genes  <cit> , suggesting regulation of intragenic transcripts. similar phenomena have been observed in eukaryotes, including human cells  <cit> . other types of non-canonical transcription factor binding sites, i.e. sites without a recognizable motif and sites that are not associated with described regulation by the transcription factor, are also poorly understood. however, sites without a recognizable motif could be explained by indirect association with dna   <cit>  or cooperative interactions with other dna-binding proteins  <cit> . sites that are not associated with described regulation by the transcription factor could be explained by combinatorial regulation by multiple, redundant transcription factors. in the case of σ <dig>  our data suggest that many σ <dig> promoters are not associated with detectable regulation using transcriptomic approaches due to a high basal level of transcription, or a specific requirement for heat shock conditions.

it is important to note that waldminghaus and skarstad identified many non-canonical σ32-target regions in their study. specifically, waldminghaus and skarstad detected σ <dig> association upstream of four genes whose expression was not detectably upregulated by overexpression of σ <dig> in either of two transcriptomic studies   <cit> , and six sites of σ <dig> association within genes or between convergently transcribed genes   <cit> . waldminghaus and skarstad suggest that “surprising”, non-canonical protein-dna interactions are often artifacts. we caution against this dogmatic approach. artifacts can arise from chip-chip and chip-seq experiments; however, with the appropriate experimental and analytical methods, and with the appropriate controls, it is possible to identify protein-dna interactions with high confidence. atypical binding sites identified using these methods may indicate novel functions for well-studied proteins. these binding sites should not be dismissed, but rather should be the focus of additional studies.
