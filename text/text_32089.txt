BACKGROUND
trypanosome infection  is a disease of man, domestic livestock and wildlife. trypanosomosis is the most economically important disease constraint to livestock productivity in africa  <cit> . the major pathogenic trypanosomes transmitted by the tsetse fly include t. congolense, t. vivax, t. brucei, and t. evansi, which cause the disease either as single or multiple infections. the disease is characterized by anemia as evidenced by reduction in packed cell volume due to erythrophagocytosis) fever, weight loss, fatigue and heart failure  <cit> . this results in loss of production, and in more severe cases, death of the animal  <cit> . certain breeds of cattle show a remarkable resistance to the effects of trypanosomosis. this phenomenon is termed 'trypanotolerance' because the host tolerates the presence of the parasites, while not showing the severe anemia and production loss that characterize the infection in susceptible breeds  <cit> . selective breeding of livestock for trypanotolerant traits would provide a partial solution to livestock based agriculture in tsetse-infested areas  <cit> . recently, quantitative trait loci  associated with trypanotolerance traits in cattle were reported  <cit> .

parallel to qtl mapping in cattle, experimental studies in mice have also been used to map trypanotolerance qtl  <cit> . the mouse offers a powerful model for studying the genetics of disease resistance  <cit> . inbred strains of mice show different responses to trypanosomosis  <cit> , and different capacity of controlling anemia during infection  <cit> . in particular, the c57bl/6j strain of inbred mice presents a higher degree of resistance to t. congolense than the a/j and balb/cj mouse strains  <cit> . trypanotolerance in mice is related to early control of parasitemia  <cit> , a capacity that is associated with genes that are expressed early in the course of the infection. these early genes regulate parasite growth and determine how rapidly the immune response is triggered. susceptible mouse strains show sustained high levels of parasitemia after challenge by t. congolense whereas low levels are shown by the resistant strains  <cit> . thus, mapping qtl affecting trypanotolerance in mice provides an alternative approach to identifying the genes associated with trypanotolerance.

in previous studies of survival time following t. congolense challenge in f <dig> crosses between the susceptible a/j and balb/cj strains and the resistant c57bl/6j mice, three trypanosomosis resistance qtl  were identified and mapped to large genomic intervals on mouse chromosome mmu <dig>  mmu <dig> and mmu <dig> respectively  <cit> . tir <dig> represents the major trypanotolerance qtl with an additive effect of  <dig> days on survival time  <cit> . following the initial qtl mapping results, the advanced intercross lines  approach  <cit>  was exploited for further fine mapping of trypanotolerance qtl in mice  <cit> . using f <dig> c57bl/6j × a/j and c57bl/6j × balb/cj ail populations, tir <dig> was indeed mapped to a 95% confidence interval  of  <dig>  cm  on mmu <dig>  <cit> . in the same ail, however, tir <dig>  and tir <dig> were only mapped to much larger cis: tir <dig>  to a 95% ci of  <dig> cm , on mmu5; while tir <dig> resolved into three distinct peaks on mmu <dig>  each representing a different putative qtl . these three qtl mapped to 95% cis of  <dig> cm ,  <dig>  cm  and  <dig> cm  on mmu <dig>  respectively  <cit> . thus, high resolution mapping of tir <dig> and tir <dig> to a small genomic confidence interval, as required for positional cloning of genes underlying the qtl remained to be achieved.

here, we report further fine mapping of tir <dig> and tir <dig>  using an f <dig> ail fixed for the susceptible allele at tir <dig>  the underlying rationale is that fixing tir <dig> would reduce residual  variance and hence result in stronger relative effects of tir <dig> and tir <dig>  while the use of an f <dig> ail would increase recombination events facilitating fine mapping. to fully exploit the additional recombination events at the f <dig> ail, it was necessary to employ a denser set of markers than those used in f <dig> mapping. hence, selective genotyping  <cit>  was employed in order to reduce the associated genotyping load. this procedure has been shown to reduce genotyping load with little reduction in the power of qtl detection  <cit> .

RESULTS
line comparisons
the c57bl/6j  and the a/j  parental populations had mean survival times of  <dig> and  <dig> days, respectively; while mean survival times of d17rr  and d17ss f12-ail  were  <dig> and  <dig> days respectively . the range in survival time was about  <dig> days for c57bl/6j, and the two f <dig> lines, but somewhat less  for the a/j susceptible line. all differences between lines in mean survival time were statistically significant . both the comparison of parental c57bl/6j to a/j and of d17rr to d17ss confirm that the challenge protocol was effective in distinguishing between resistant and susceptible animals. note that the d17ss f12-ail is also the mapping population used in the present study. the difference of  <dig> days in mean survival time between d17ss and d17rr accords well with the estimated effect of this locus in the f <dig> and f <dig> experiments reported previously . the mean survival time of the d17ss line, which is homozygous for the susceptible allele at the strong tir <dig> qtl on mmu <dig>  was somewhat greater than that of the resistant c57bl/6j mice. this will be addressed in the discussion section.

threshold lod scores for significance based on permutation tests  <cit>  were  <dig>  for mmu <dig> and  <dig>  for mmu <dig>  figure  <dig> shows lod score plots for mmu <dig> and mmu <dig> obtained by the mapmaker qtl software. mmu <dig> presented a single very sharp lod score peak exceeding the significance threshold. this peak closely corresponds to the qtl tir <dig> identified in previous studies. mmu <dig> presented four lod score peaks that exceeded the significance threshold. however, only the three peaks designated a, b, and c in the figure, were declared significant by mapmaker qtl. these peaks are taken to correspond to the qtl tir3a, tir3b, and tir3c, identified in previous studies. the fourth peak  was not declared significant by mapmaker qtl . we attribute this to the absence of any significant single-marker test across the region of this peak, as defined by flanking markers d1mit <dig> and d1mit <dig> 

effects of the tir qtl
locations and confidence intervals of the tir qtl
tir <dig> mapped to a confidence interval of  <dig> cm in the present study, at  <dig> cm on mmu <dig>  this is comfortably within the region  <dig> -  <dig> cm with peak at  <dig> cm found in the previous f <dig> ail study  <cit>  so that the two experiments are almost certainly identifying the same qtl. the ci of  <dig> cm obtained in the present study is a distinct improvement on the ci of  <dig> cm obtained in the f <dig> study.

the f <dig> mapping results fully confirmed the complex tripartite substructure of tir <dig> as hinted at in the f <dig> mapping results and clearly expressed in the f <dig> ail  <cit> . however, correspondence of the f <dig> and f <dig> mapping results was not as close for the three tir <dig> loci as for tir <dig>  and the reduction in ci was for the most part marginal. for tir3a, the f <dig> ci  was distal to the corresponding f <dig> ci  and considerably larger . for tir3b, the f <dig> ci  corresponded closely to the tir3b f <dig> ci . however, improvement in ci was slight . for tir3c, f <dig> ci  was proximal to the f <dig> ci , but was considerably narrower . thus, tir3b which is the central qtl in this region mapped to the same location as in the f <dig>  while tir3a and tir3c both appear to have moved toward the center. we return to this in the discussion.

discussion
parental c57bl/6j mice had a  <dig> day higher mean survival time than parental a/j mice. this agrees with the purported higher resistance of the c57bl/6j compared to a/j mice. however, the absolute magnitude of the difference was much less than the  <dig> days previously reported  <cit> . we believe that this is best explained by factors associated with the source supplier of the parental lines. variation in the t. congolense clones might also be considered, but this would be expected to affect the estimated effects at the tir <dig> locus as well. this was not found; allele substitution effects at tir <dig> were similar in all three experiments.

in addition, in the original study of the f <dig> of a cross between these two lines  <cit>  the f <dig> was intermediate in resistance between the two parental lines; while in the present study the d17ss ail  was more resistant than the resistant c56bl/6j parent line. the f <dig> ail also displayed higher resistance than the c56bl/6j parent line . a genetic explanation for these results is not evident, and hence we believe they too should be attributed to some factor associated with the source supplier of the parental lines. a further possibility is an accumulated effect of environmental factors on the ail populations that improved their phenotypic response to the infection, especially considering that the ail population were developed during a period of three years at ilri in an open environment mouse facility. more speculatively, this increase might also be due to dissociation of suppressor factors linked to host resistant genes due to increase in the recombination events in ail generations. such a dissociation might lead to an increase in the expression of resistant phenotypes in these mouse populations.

thus, of the four tir qtl mapped in the f <dig> ail, higher map resolution was achieved for tir <dig> and tir3c, but not for tir3a or tir3b. however, tir3a had already been mapped to a narrow ci in the f <dig> ail. taken as a whole then, the ail approach successfully resolved the complex tir <dig> locus into three component loci, and together with tir <dig> and tir <dig> mapped four of the resultant five tir loci  to ci that are sufficiently narrow , to make positional cloning feasible. it is quite possible that combining the f <dig> and f <dig> data might yield higher resolution for tir3b as well.

as an alternative to the ail approach for high resolution mapping, it may have been possible to generate interval specific congenic lines  <cit>  for each of the tir qtl. these have been used successfully for high resolution of individual qtl, . however, in these cases, a single qtl was dissected. the present study involved five qtl; thus, five series of icsl lines would have had to be developed. logistically, the ail seems to have delivered about the same degree of map resolution with far less resources.

a number of candidate trypanotolerance genes within the fine mapped tir <dig> loci were identified from the public databases http://www.informatics.jax.org/. we have identified forty three genes mapped within the fine mapped intervals of tir <dig> qtl . of these, the most attractive candidate genes which may underly the qtl are toll-like receptor  <dig>  toll-like receptor  <dig>  both of which are well known to be associated innate immunity and host response to infection diseases and are important for the elimination of invading pathogens. toll-like receptors  are members of the pattern-recognition receptor  family and play a central role in initiation of innate cellular immune response and subsequently adaptive immune response to pathogens. tlrs can recognize diverse pathogen-associated molecular patters  make it an early warning system against invading pathogens. activation of trl signal initiates pathways, which leads to activation of variety of genes that function in host defense mechanism, including those of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and antigen presenting molecules. these genes are the most relevance for our studied phenotype and can be involved in clearance of trypanosma parasite from the infected mice.

for the tir <dig> region, attractive candidate genes include interleukin  <dig> and its regulator cypr <dig> gene on tir3a and b respectively, and various tumor necrosis factor ligand super-family members, interferon related segments, and toll like receptor  <dig> genes. these genes are involved in host response to various pathogenic infections hence may play a role in trypanotolerance.

CONCLUSIONS
the cumulative results of the mouse f <dig> and ail mapping studies provide essential mapping information for the identification of candidate trypanotolerance genes in mice, and may be useful for the identification of the homologous genes in livestock. further analysis of these and other candidate genes is vital in order to ascertain their role in trypanotolerance. in future studies, we plan to examine the candidate genes for suggestive polymorphisms, and perform expression assays for these and other candidate genes under control and challenge conditions as the next step to identify the actual genes involved in resistance.
