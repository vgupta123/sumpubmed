BACKGROUND
listeria monocytogenes is a gram-positive, motile, non-sporulating, rod shaped bacterium. it is the causative agent of listeriosis, a food-borne disease, which afflicts both humans and animals. there are only eight species in the entire genus, l. monocytogenesl. marthiil. innocual. seeligeril. welshimeril. ivanoviil. grayi and l. rocourtiae. l. monocytogenes and l. ivanovii are the pathogenic species while the others are apathogenic  <cit> . in the genus listeria, non-pathogenic species have been hypothesized to have evolved through genome reduction from pathogenic progenitor strains  <cit> . l. monocytogenes is able to invade and replicate in both phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells. the infectious life cycle has been elucidated in detail, and several virulence factors, essential for each stage of infection have been identified  <cit> . pathogenic listeriae encode several virulence factors that are localized in a virulence gene cluster  or steriapathogenicity island- <dig>  in the genome. however, a number of genes required for virulence are not localized in this cluster, including the two internalins inla and inlb. these encode proteins that are expressed on the surface of the bacterium and facilitate the entry of the bacterium into the eukaryotic cell and their incorporation into a membrane-bound vacuole  <cit> . further pathogenicity islands present in the genus listeria code for multiple internalins and additional hemolysin genes in species l. ivanovii   <cit>  and a subset of strains of lineage i   <cit> .

within the four lineages of l. monocytogenes, strains are generally classified by serotyping or mlst  <cit> , of which 1/2a, 1/2b and 4b are most commonly associated with human listerial infections  <cit> . the first outbreak of l. monocytogenes was described for the strain egd-e, a serotype 1/2a strain of lineage ii, following an epidemic in rabbits and guinea pigs in  <dig> by e.g.d. murray  <cit> . this strain has become a model listeria strain, and was the first listerial strain to be completely sequenced, along with the non-pathogenic listeria innocua 6a clip <dig>  <cit> . subsequently, the first genome of a 4b serotype strain  of lineage i was completely sequenced  <cit> . it was isolated from jalisco cheese during a listeriosis outbreak in california in  <dig> and mainly associated with pregnancy-related cases. however, it has been recently shown that this strain contains nonsense and frameshift mutations in several genes. owing to a frameshift in inlb, f <dig> is severely compromised in caco- <dig> invasion assays  <cit> .

here we report thus the genome sequence of a clinical isolate of the 4b serotype of lineage i, the l. monocytogenes 4b strain clip <dig> that was isolated in a clinical outbreak of listeriosis in france affecting  <dig> persons  <cit> . we also present the complete genome sequencing of l. monocytogenes strain 4a l <dig> of lineage iii. l <dig> was originally isolated from food by kampelmacher in 1950s in the netherlands. this strain is attenuated in its virulence properties and exhibits a restricted ability to grow within the liver and spleen of infected mice  <cit> . the availability of the complete genome of l. monocytogenes egd-e serotype 1/2a has permitted analysis of the intracellular gene expression profile of this strain  <cit> .

the genome sequences of strains 4a l <dig> and 4b clip <dig> presented in this work provide a unique opportunity to delineate specific adaptations of these lineage representives both at the genomic and at the transcriptional level.

RESULTS
general features of complete genomes of three lineages of l. monocytogenes
the overall features of the completely sequenced circular genomes of l. monocytogenes 4a l <dig>  l. monocytogenes 4b clip <dig>  l. monocytogenes 1/2a egd-e, l. monocytogenes 4b f <dig> and l. innocua 6a clip <dig> are given in table  <dig>  computational multi-virulence-locus sequence typing   <cit>  analysis showed that strain 4b clip <dig> belongs to epidemic clone ecii and strain 4b f <dig> to epidemic clone eci as previously reported by nelson and colleagues  <cit> , respectively. the l. monocytogenes genomes are remarkably syntenic: genome size, g + c content, percentage coding and average length of protein-coding genes are similar among all four strains   <cit> . all four l. monocytogenes genomes harbour  <dig> trna genes and contain six complete copies of rrna operons , of which two are located on the right and four on the left replichore. the chromosomes of 4a l <dig> and 4b clip <dig> are devoid of mobile genetic elements and harbour no plasmid.

core and specific genes were analyzed using orthologous pairs excluding prophage genes as described previously  <cit> .

we observed four different prophage regions in the genome of the 4a l <dig> and only one in the 4b clip <dig> strain . l. monocytogenes 4a l <dig> prophage i is located at position  <dig> bp , prophage ii at , prophage iii at  <dig> bp  and prophage iv at  <dig> bp . two prophage regions, i and iii, are located adjacent to trnas. prophage region i is flanked by trnalys and prophage region iii is inserted within the region between the gene for trnaarg and ydei compared to l. monocytogenes 1/2a egd-e. at this very chromosomal location in l. welshimeri 6b slcc <dig> there is an insertion of a prophage  <cit> , while l. ivanovii harbours the species-specific listeria pathogenicity island  <dig> , which contains a sphingomyelinase c  and also a cluster of internalin genes  <cit> . these findings confirm previous observations  <cit>  indicating that trnas represent genetic “anchoring elements” for the uptake of listerial prophage dna by transduction processes and thus contributing to evolutionary genome diversity of listeriae. pseudogenes were detected for both 4b f <dig>  and 4b clip <dig>  genomes respectively, which is a higher number compared to that seen in l. monocytogenes 1/2a egd-e , l. monocytogenes 4a l <dig>  and l. innocua .

when comparing the two l. monocytogenes 4b genomes   <dig> genes are specific for strain 4b clip <dig> with respect to strain 4b f <dig>  the dominant functions encoded by these genes are related to sugar metabolism as they comprise five pts systems and five sugar permeases or sugar transporters. furthermore, four transcriptional regulators and four surface anchored proteins are specific to 4b clip <dig> indicating differences in regulation, sugar metabolism and surface characteristics between the two strains. of the  <dig> genes found to be specific for strain 4b f <dig>  the majority were of unknown function, apart from a pts system and a specific surface protein. most interestingly, inlb although it is reported to be important for virulence of l. monocytogenes has a frameshift mutation in this strain  <cit> .

when comparing the genomes of different lineages at the nucleotide sequence level a number of genomic differences were revealed . surface proteins showed the highest number of single nucleotide polymorphisms . even in the comparison of the two closely related 4b genomes, two lpxtg-motif containing proteins were identified as encoding a large number of snps. one of these, lm4b_ <dig> shares substantial similarity to internalins. comparison of the 4a l <dig> and the 1/2a egd-e genomes reflected larger evolutionary divergence, but once again involved surface proteins, such as the lpxtg-motif containing protein lmo <dig>  internalin lmo <dig> , autolysin lmo <dig>  as well as proteins involved in surface antigen biosynthesis like lmo <dig>  and lmo <dig> . further analysis identified genes that are most divergent in the three lineages and classification of the most divergent orthologous gene groups was performed . thus, distribution of snps in listeria suggests considerable evolutionary adaptation among surface-associated genes.

comparison of the virulence genes cluster of lineage i, ii and iii
all genes of the virulence gene cluster are present in the four studied strains  <cit> . we performed a nucleotide sequence alignment of the entire virulence genes cluster, using the egd-e sequence as a reference. as shown in figure  <dig> we identified a truncation in the acta sequence of the 4b and the 4a genomes. in addition, a small truncation upstream the mpl gene and a truncation of a short repeat region distal to the prfa binding box of mpl was present in the 4a genome. however, the prfa binding site was not affected. moreover, the alignment identity decreased slightly in the latter half of the cluster, with differences most prominently visible in the regions containing lmo <dig> and lmo <dig>  lmo <dig> encodes a lipoprotein and was identified as one of the most divergent genes of the lipi- <dig> when comparing three lineages.

interestingly, both the l. monocytogenes 4b strains , and the l. monocytogenes 4a l <dig> strain, have an identical repeat truncation in the acta protein compared to acta of the 1/2a egd-e . such truncations in acta have been reported previously for strain 4a l <dig> and affect the speed of movement of intracellular bacteria  <cit> . we surveyed sequenced acta alleles present in genbank and discovered that the truncation in the acta protein is far more frequent in 1/2b and 4b strains  than in 1/2a strains .

loss of surface proteins in lineage iii
several genes encoding internalin-like proteins are absent in the l. monocytogenes 4a l <dig> genome in comparison to the 1/2a egd-e and the 4b strains  as previously reported for lineage iii strains  <cit> . the entire inlghe cluster  <cit>  is absent in the 4a l <dig> genome   <cit> . the corresponding loci in both 4b genomes are identical to each other, but different to strain 1/2a egd-e. another prfa-independent internalin  that has been shown to be specifically expressed only in vivo  <cit>  is also absent from the 4a l <dig> genome. similarly, internalin c  <cit> , involved in cell-to-cell spread and innate immune response in the vertebrate host  <cit> , is absent in 4a l <dig> but is conserved in both 4b strains and 1/2a egd-e. a comparable situation was identified for internalin f  <cit> , however deletion mutants have not been shown to be reduced in invasion into non-phagocytic cells  <cit> . apart from the absence of these characterized internalin genes, several other internalin-like genes  are present in the 1/2a egd-e and 4b genomes, but are absent from the 4a l <dig> genome. in addition, we analysed the repertoire of genes encoding surface proteins for recently published 4a genomes of strain hcc <dig>  <cit>  and m <dig>  <cit>  as well as 4c fsl j2- <dig>  . we confirmed by comparative genomics that these 4a genomes lack a similar number of surface proteins . these findings were independently verified by additional pcr analysis to confirm the absence of genes encoding surface proteins for four 4a strains and three 4c strains, respectively. half of the inspected chromosomal loci differed by pcr analysis among 4a and 4c genomes . some non-internalin like cell-wall proteins that have been shown to be important for invasion are also absent, e.g. auto a gw-motif containing , prfa-independent, surface autolysin. previous studies revealed an essential role for auto in the entry into non-phagocytic eukaryotic cells  <cit> . the vip gene product, a prfa-dependent lpxtg protein , described as a receptor for the eukaryotic gp <dig> surface protein and important for late stages of infection  <cit> , is also absent from the 4a l <dig> genome. in addition to these missing genes, inli is slightly truncated. however ami , an important listerial adhesion protein seems to be present in a shorter version in both 4b strains  <cit> , whereas the number of lipoproteins , lysm- and  nlpc/p60-motif containing proteins  was comparable among the four strains under study.

overall, in comparison to 1/2a egd-e and the two 4b genomes, 4a l <dig> strain has lost a number of crucial determinants required for listerial invasion. the selective loss of genes primarily responsible for the first steps of infection may contribute to the poor invasion ability and the attenuated nature of the 4a l <dig> strain.

decay of phage genes in the l. monocytogenes 4a l <dig> strain
the 1/2a egd-e genome contains  <dig> prophage genes in two different loci, the 4a l <dig> genome includes  <dig> phage genes at four loci, while the 4b genomes encode with  <dig>  for the smallest number of prophage genes limited to a single locus  at the same position in the chromosomes.

this monocin locus, a cryptic prophage region, is conserved in all l. monocytogenes lineages and includes the lma genes  <cit> . although previously thought to be specific to l. monocytogenes, it was shown that lmadcba is also present in several apathogenic l. innocua strains. however, not all genes of the operon are present in all l. monocytogenes strains. the 4a l <dig> genome lacks lmaa and lmab . the entire locus in 1/2a egd-e and the two 4b genomes has  <dig> genes, but only five of these genes are present in the 4a l <dig> genome. lmaa and lmab are absent in l. welshimeri. interestingly, the structure of this prophage locus in strain 4a l <dig> and other lineage iii strains is more similar to l. welshimeri than to other pathogenic listeriae .

the crispr system of listeria
the l. monocytogenes 4a l <dig> genome was found to contain two adjacent crispr loci  with crispr repeats . both loci contain sequences of length  <dig> bp separated by repeat sequences of length  <dig> bp. however, they differ considerably in the number of repeat copies . while locus i is highly conserved in the 4b strains, 1/2a egd-e and l. innocua, locus ii was exclusively present in 4a genomes of l <dig>  hcc <dig>  m <dig>  but not in another lineage iii genome of 4c fsl j2- <dig> . it is not known whether the crispr system is functional in the 4a l <dig> genome. however, by sequence similarity searches using the spacers to detect possible prophage dna traces, we were able to identify the psa prophage that is known to infect serotype  <dig> strains. assuming a functional crispr system in 4a l <dig> suggests a resistance to the psa bacteriophage .

gene duplications in the listeria genomes expand metabolic systems
we found substantial evidence for a minimum of  <dig> to a maximum of  <dig> gene duplications in the listeria genomes . it is evident that the majority of these duplications are ancient events as they are shared among all species and the number of gene pairs with a very high percentage identity is very low . functional classification of the duplicated genes revealed that many of these have important implications in metabolic pathways, like the pentose phosphate pathway, fructose and mannose metabolism, carbon fixation, glycolysis and pyruvate metabolism.

while several duplicated genes could be mapped to central metabolic pathways from the kegg database, this was not possible for horizontally transferred genes . however, not all duplicated genes seem to have arisen from true duplications, but some may have been transferred horizontally, like some pts system genes that are l. monocytogenes egd-e strain-specific genes. the number of genes classified into known metabolic pathways or systems was significantly higher for duplicated genes, while several horizontally transferred genes could not be mapped.

comparative intracellular transcriptomics of four l. monocytogenes strains of the three major lineages
comparative transcriptome analysis of listeria monocytogenes strains of the two major lineages revealed differences in virulence, cell wall, and stress response  <cit> . here we performed intracellular gene expression analyses using whole genome microarrays between four l. monocytogenes strains belonging to the three major lineages to investigate eventual differences. p388d <dig> murine macrophages were infected and total rna was isolated four hours post infection and hybridized to bioarrays.

in order to determine the core intracellular response of l. monocytogenes we created a dataset of core-syntenic homologous genes for all four genomes and the expression data for these genes were compared. we found that in all strains studied the entire virulence genes cluster,  was highly induced within the infected host cells. furthermore genes known to be important for bacterial survival, such as hpt, clpe, bilea and two lrr domain-containing proteins  were upregulated in all strains.

interestingly, three mannose transporting pts systems , two fructose specific systems , two galacitol specific systems , two beta-glucoside systems , and two cellobiose specific systems  were commonly upregulated in all strains. these possibly represent the most frequently used substrates of listeriae in the cytosol. only one mannose specific pts system,  is downregulated by all studied strains .

most surprisingly, all listeria strains studied expressed the genes of the lma operon and surrounding prophage genes of the monocin locus, including a conserved holin  during intracellular growth. however, the functions of several of these genes are not defined. the only locus that is conserved in all three lineages  is the monocin lma locus. the lmaa gene product has been shown to provoke a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction in mice immune to l. monocytogenes. it is also secreted at 20°c but much less  <cit>  at 37°c. the lma operon produces two transcripts, a  <dig> bp lmadcba transcript expressed both at 20°c and 37°c, and a  <dig> bp lmaba transcript induced at lower temperatures  <cit> . additional prophage genes were highly expressed in the individual strains . taken together, high intracellular prophage gene expression, despite several differences in prophage gene content, is one of the most striking observations across all listeria lineages.

all strains showed induction of the eut operon suggesting that ethanolamine may be used as a carbon and nitrogen source in intracellular conditions. the zinc transporters were also commonly upregulated indicating a role of zinc in intracellular survival as well as the spermidine/putrescine abc transporters . furthermore, the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway was utilized by all listeriae, possibly to generate nadph for countering oxidative stress in intracellular conditions. the upregulation of genes of the pentose phosphate pathway has been shown previously  <cit>  and it has been speculated that it is important for generation of erythrose-4-phosphate for aromatic amino acid biosynthesis or for generation of pentose sugars. accordingly; we observed a downregulation of several genes involved in pyrimidine and purine biosynthesis from pentose sugars .

downregulated genes included the agr locus  as demonstrated previously  <cit>  and several genes of the tryptophan biosynthesis operon , and some trna synthetase genes . diminished energy generation was indicated by decreased expression of the cytochrome genes cluster cytabcd. with respect to the pentose phosphate pathway, we detected downregulation of the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase  gene, which is required for the production of prpp  that links the pentose phosphate pathway to the biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines. while several genes of the glycolytic operon, and several individual genes were downregulated by 1/2a egd-e, 4b clip <dig> strain or 4a l <dig>  the 4b f <dig> strain showed increased expression .

differences in flagellin expression are the most prominent differences among strains
to address the observation that strain 4b clip <dig> grows more efficiently inside the host than strain 4b f <dig>  we performed a direct comparison of the transcriptome data derived from these two strains. most important differences were found in the regulation of flagellar genes. while intracellular bacteria of strain 4b f <dig> upregulated a substantial number of flagellar genes, including flis, flii, flha, flif, file, flgb, flgc, flgg, flid as well as the transcriptional regulator degu , in the 4b strain clip <dig> only flir was upregulated. when comparing the intracellular transcriptome of strain 4a l <dig> to the 1/2a and 4b strains the most striking difference was again the expression of the flagellar operon. we observed a strong induction of nearly all flagellar genes in the operon, including flagellin   in strain 4a l <dig>  strong expression of these genes is counterproductive within infected cells, because it probably enables the host to efficiently detect bacterial presence and the formation of an inflammasome.

apart from genes that are important for pathogen recognition mechanisms by the host, a concerted expression profile  involving genes of cell wall synthesis, host cell invasion, response to oxidative stress, utilization of host carbohydrates and propanediol, which are crucial for intracellular survival as well as virulence and surface proteins were identified.

differential growth of the three lineages and ∆lmab and ∆lmad isogenic mutants in a mouse infection and cell infection models
we observed a severe deficiency in entry of strain l <dig> in hela and caco- <dig> cells as well as poor cell-to-cell transmission with macrophages and l <dig> fibroblasts when compared to 1/2a egd-e . impaired invasion ability of host cells may be due to lack of several internalin genes in the genome of strain 4a l <dig>  it is likely that both, decreased invasive ability and strong intracellular expression of flagellar genes contribute towards the rapid clearance of the 4a l <dig> strain in in vivo experiments in mice. upregulation of several dna repair genes was also seen in strain 4a l <dig> compared to the other strains, e.g. , suggesting genomic damage during the infection process.

to further assess the virulence potential of the three lineages, we performed mouse infection experiments with each of the four strains , and measured bacterial loads in spleens and livers at different time points . the 4a l <dig> strain was cleared rapidly from the mice and was not detectable after five days of infection, in accordance with previous results  <cit> , indicating that the 4a l <dig> strain is attenuated in its pathogenicity. however, the other three strains were able to survive in both spleens and livers of infected mice. interestingly, while they could comparably replicate in the spleen, the 1/2a egd-e and the 4b f <dig> bacterial loads in liver were significantly lower than the 4b clip <dig> strain whose counts remained significantly higher even on days five and eight post-infection. isogenic mutants of Δlmab and Δlmad showed similar counts in mice spleens and livers. however, both mutants have shown a significantly lower level of growth than 1/2a egd-e on days  <dig> and  <dig> post-infection .

discussion
we sequenced and analysed the genomes of representatives of three major lineages of species l. monocytogenes to correlate gene content with  its wide spectrum of pathogenic abilities,  its differing properties for survival in the hosts, and  its adaptive properties during growth under extracellular conditions.

decay of surface proteins in the virulence attenuated l. monocytogenes 4a strain
analysis of the 4a l <dig> genome revealed extensive loss of a large number of internalins, internalin-like proteins and other surface proteins important for invasive ability. for strain 4a l <dig>  which was isolated from contaminated food in the 1950’s, it might be possible that mutations have taken place over this lengthy time of storage under in vitro conditions. surprisingly, a previously known acta truncation in the 4a genomes of l <dig>  hcc <dig> and m <dig>  was also found in a higher number of lineages i strains compared to lineage ii, but not in the acta gene of another lineage iii strain of 4c fsl j2- <dig> indicating a serotype-specific heterogeneity of acta sequences within the genus listeria. the loss of this proline-repeat in acta is correlated with lowered actin-based motility in the cytosol. in addition, comparative nucleotide analysis indicated that the latter half of the lipi-i pathogenicity island in strain 4a l <dig> has diverged significantly from that of the 4b and 1/2a strain leading to a loss of the open reading frames lmo <dig> to lmo <dig>  loss of lmo <dig>  has been shown to confer a severe growth effect on survival in macrophages,  <cit>  while loss of lmo <dig> has a small effect on growth in macrophages and no data are presently available for lmo <dig> and lmo <dig> and their role in virulence.

differential regulation of intracellular flagella gene expression by strains of different lineages
highly sensitive and widely distributed host microbe-associated microbial pattern receptors  continuously patrol the cell surface, endosomes and the cytosol for signs of microbial presence by sensing cell wall components, bacterial dna, lipoproteins and flagellin. ligands may be shared between the surface and the cytosolic receptors, e.g. cell wall components and flagellin may be sensed both by tlrs and also by cytosolic receptors. we detected the intracellular expression of the flagellin gene in 1/2a egd-e  <cit> . recently, it has been shown that cytosolic flagellin, expressed by l. monocytogenes strain  <dig> s  is detected by multiple nod-like receptors, including ipaf and nalp <dig>  and also by a pathway involving the adaptor protein asc and the cytosolic dna sensor aim <dig>  which is required for the formation of the inflammasome  <cit> . detection of flagellin in the cytosol via these pathways leads to caspase- <dig> mediated cleavage of pro-il-1b and release of active il-1b. mice lacking caspase- <dig> or asc are unable to mount active il-1b response to intracellular pathogens such as shigella flexneri and francisella tularensis <cit> . all strains investigated in this study were found to express flagellar genes in the cytosol, except for strain 4b clip <dig>  the ability to successfully downregulate flagellar  gene expression is probably critical for evading host detection and promoting bacterial intracellular growth. in line with this observation, a 1/2a egd-e chromosomal deletion mutant of the gene displayed increased survival in mouse infection assays  <cit> .

in keeping with this finding, both strains 4b f <dig> and 4a l <dig> displayed strong induction of several flagellar genes during intracellular growth and were more readily cleared from the host. this suggests strain-specific differences in the ability to avoid host recognition can lead to large differences in virulence manifestation, despite several commonalities in the adaptations of the lineages to the intracellular lifestyle. although all the strains investigated in this study were able to induce all genes of the virulence genes cluster intracellularly, it is likely that there are a multitude of effects including differences in virulence gene expression, uptake of carbohydrates, membrane protein expression and flagellar biosynthesis, all of which contribute to the observed phenotypic properties.

effects of gene duplication events on metabolic adaptation and survival within the host
the processes of gene duplications, horizontal gene transfer and gene loss influence the short- and long-term evolution of prokaryotic genomes. the benefits of gene duplications in the short term can be seen clearly in conditions of antibiotic treatment  <cit> , toxin exposure  <cit> , heavy metal stress  <cit> , extreme temperatures  <cit> , nutrient limitation  <cit>  and even parasitic and symbiotic lifestyles  <cit> . duplications found in all listeria genomes seem to have been ancient i.e. precede species differentiation, with only the exception of the recent prophage duplication in l. innocua 6a clip <dig>  classification of duplicated genes revealed several paralogous genes in metabolic pathways, while very few horizontally transferred genes could be classified at all.

the highest numbers of gene duplications were identified in the following categories: abc transporters, pts systems, pentose phosphate pathway, starch and sucrose metabolism, fructose and mannose metabolism, and carbon fixation. surprisingly, we found a high number of duplicated gene paralogues involved in the regulation of the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway and in the generation of ribose-5-phospate from ribulose-5-phosphate. under conditions of intracellular growth, we observed differences in the ability of the lineages to express horizontally transferred genes. 1/2a egd-e was most successful in this regard , followed by 4a l <dig> , 4b f <dig>  and 4b clip <dig> . apart from the horizontally transferred genes, differences in the expression of strain-specific genes in the cytosol were apparent .

pts systems enable listeriae to utilize host carbohydrates, a mechanism that is essential for the intracellular survival. pts systems  for the utilization of fructose and beta-glucosides, mannose and cellobiose were most frequently observed in the investigated listeria genomes. although the numbers of pts systems are comparable among the investigated genomes , even a slight difference in presence/absence of a pts system available as an additional carbohydrate utilization mechanism may have dramatic effects on listerial survival inside the host cytosol  <cit> , specifically on the master regulator prfa  <cit> . for instance, the pentitol pts system in 1/2a egd-e is not present in either the 4b or the 4a l <dig> genomes. a transposon insertion mutant of this system  has been shown to have significantly attenuated growth in epithelial cells  <cit> . several partial pts systems are also present in the genome . these are independently expressed intracellularly, and represent broadly shared and commonly regulated systems. in accordance, the pathogenic strain 4b clip <dig> was found to upregulate more pts systems than strain 4b f <dig>  which may contribute to better intracellular survival of 4b clip <dig> 

in addition to phosphorylated sugars, there are other nitrogen and carbon sources available to intracellular bacteria, such as ethanolamine. ethanolamine is used as substrate and an energy supply by salmonella enterica grown under anaerobic conditions and is suggested to be used by other bacteria  <cit> . a locus homologous to that of the ethanolamine operon of s. enterica has also been described in listeria <cit> . the gene organization of the locus is not identical to the salmonella cluster, but all the genes of the cluster have homologous sequences in listeria . previous studies identified genes of the locus to be upregulated intracellularly during infection and were shown to play a critical role for intracellular survival  <cit> . our data support this observation and further demonstrate upregulation of several genes of this locus across all three pathogenic lineages of listeria, suggesting that the functions of the locus are conserved. however, since the locus is also present in the apathogenic l. innocua strain 6a clip <dig>  it may exemplify a general requirement of listeria to cope with nutrient rather than a specific virulence adaptation. furthermore, degradation of the phagosomal membrane that traps intracellular listeriae, results in the release of ethanolamine as a byproduct and may serve an energy source in the host cytosol.

not only the efficient recruitment of carbohydrate substrates, but also the differential channeling through different pathways represents an important adaption within the host cytosol. it has been shown that an essential mechanism to counteract oxidative stress is to reroute carbohydrate flux via the pentose phosphate pathway, which is required for the biosynthesis of reductive substrates rather than through glycolysis pathway  <cit> . indeed, we observed that all lineages prefer to channel carbohydrate flux via the pentose phosphate pathway, rather than glycolysis. in contrast to the other strains, only strain 4b f <dig> was unable to downregulate glycolysis, suggesting that the inability to route sugars efficiently via pentose phosphate contributes to the poor intracellular growth of this strain.

the crispr system in listeria reveals expansion and atrophy
a crispr  locus, associated with several cas genes was identified in the 4a l <dig> genome. crisprs are highly divergent loci found in genomes of all archaea and several bacteria  <cit> . a crispr system is composed of the cas  genes, a leader sequence and arrays of direct repeats separated by non-repetitive spacer sequences resulting in a rna-interference like innate phage-resistance mechanism  <cit> . a recent study in streptococcus thermophilus demonstrated how bacteria are able to integrate new spacer sequences derived from infecting phages, directly into the crispr arrays, and that this ability confers phage-resistance  <cit> . the mechanism of resistance has also been elucidated  <cit> . among the genomes compared in this study, only the 4a l <dig> genomes of l <dig>  hcc <dig> and m <dig> possesses cas genes and several crispr repeats. there are only two repeats in each 4b genome, five in 1/2a egd-e a single one in l. innocua 6a clip <dig>  but none of these strains harbour identifiable cas genes. in addition, a small srna rlib is located in the repeat region of 1/2a egd-e and contributes to virulence in mice  <cit> . we were also able to detect a dna sequence of a potential prophage  using the spacers from the 4a genome. as prophages evolve quite rapidly, it is likely that this acquisition is a recent event.

distinct role of intracellularly upregulated phage genes in virulence of listerial strains
the four l. monocytogenes strains have different numbers of prophage genes  distributed in different loci. regardless of location and lineage, all strains expressed several prophage genes within the infected host cell. however, only a single locus, the lma locus is conserved across the three lineages and is also induced during infection. the role of prophage genes in the virulence of listeria has not been examined in detail. we show that chromosomal deletion mutants of two genes in this locus  resulted in growth reduction of 1/2a egd-e in a murine infection model. although the underlying mechanisms leading to the attenuated phenotypes remain unclear, a recent study revealed that prophage diversification represents an essential mechanism for short-term genome evolution within the species l. monocytogenes <cit>  and is subject of further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
listeria monocytogenes is arguably one of the best characterized pathogens and has been established as an unparalleled model microorganism in infection biology. detailed understanding of differences in virulence of the three major lineages of listeria provides us with invaluable information about evolutionary adaptation of this pathogen. here we used comparative genomics and whole-genome based transcriptome analysis of strains from all lineages to obtain a comprehensive view as to how these strains have evolutionarily diverged. this approach suggests that  reductive evolution of strains of serotype 4a such as l <dig>  hcc <dig> and m <dig> is the major force driving the attenuated phenotype,  acquisition and adaptation of prophage genes and metabolic systems, respectively, identify novel virulence-associated factors of listeriae and  listeriae avoid detection and subsequent immune response of the host via downregulation of surface structures and by differences in intracellular expression of flagellar genes.
