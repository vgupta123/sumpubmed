BACKGROUND
polyphenol oxidase  is nearly ubiquitous in angiosperms and belongs to a class of copper-binding enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of phenolics to quinones. the subsequent non-enzymatic polymerization of the quinones leads to formation of brown pigments that are the cause of post-harvest deterioration and loss of quality in many economically important crops  <cit> . losses caused by the browning resulting from ppo catalyzed-oxidations probably account for 50% of the losses of industrial production of fruits and vegetables  <cit> . several reports have described reduced browning reaction in crops by suppression of ppo gene expression using transgenic transformation with ppo gene fragments in configurations such as sense, antisense or double-stranded rna  <cit> . those approaches functioned by establishing an rna silencing mechanism guided by a population of heterogeneous small interfering rnas   <cit> . inevitably, the whole ppo gene family in the transgenic hosts was targeted because ppo genes are members of a multi-gene family with highly conserved gene sequences  <cit> . because of this, it has been difficult to assess the contribution made by the individual ppo gene to the oxidative browning process in different tissues. in addition to the undesired browning activity, ppos appear to play important roles in signal transduction, stress and defense response throughout plant growth and development, but the specific ppo gene members involved in the different functions has not been elucidated. in potato , five ppo genes, namely potp <dig> , potp <dig> , pot <dig> , pot <dig>  and pot <dig> , were previously identified and characterized  <cit> . the nucleotide sequences of potp <dig> and potp <dig> are over 97% identical. potp1/p <dig>  pot <dig>  pot <dig> and pot <dig> share 70-82% nucleotide homology. a previous study based on rna northern blot analysis revealed that potp <dig> and potp <dig> genes were expressed mainly in potato leaves and flowers, pot <dig> and pot <dig> mrna were detected mainly in tubers with the pot <dig> being the major form throughout tuber development, and pot <dig> gene was mainly expressed in the roots  <cit> .

artificial microrna  technology is a newly developed approach for inducing loss of gene function in plants  <cit> . it utilizes microrna  gene backbones to express artificial small rnas that are usually  <dig> nucleotides  in length. the resultant amirnas join in rna silencing pathways and guide silencing of the gene of interest  <cit> . one of the advantages of amirna strategy is that it generates a single type of small rna population all with the same selective nucleic acid sequence. it provides a feasible method for either silencing an individual gene or simultaneously silencing or partially silencing a multi-gene family while at the same time minimizing the risk of unpredicted off-target effects  <cit> . the amirna strategy has been applied in functional genetics studies using model plants, such as arabidopsis and also agricultural crops, such as rice, alfalfa and tomato in recent years  <cit> . however, there were fewer reports of the targeting of closely related members of multi-gene families  <cit> .

here we reported suppression of the characterized members of the ppo gene family, i.e. potp1/p <dig>  pot <dig>  pot <dig> and pot <dig>  individually or in combination in potato using amirnas. this allowed us to investigate the contributions of the different ppo genes to the total ppo protein activity in potato tubers and to further understand the correlations between ppo protein level, ppo activity and tuber tissue browning potential. our results show that amirnas can be applied to suppress the expression of individual members of a highly conserved gene family. a series of browning phenotypes resulted from the suppression of different ppo gene isoforms in potato. our results also suggest a new strategy for developing low-browning or non-browning crops.

the ppo gene suppression research in this report started before the availability of the potato genome sequence data, but we recently surveyed the ppo gene family in the potato genome and discovered  <dig> ppo-like gene models. the ppo gene models are systematically named as stuppo <dig> to stuppo <dig> . potp1/p <dig>  pot <dig>  pot <dig> and pot <dig> are considered allelic to stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig>  respectively. for continuity in the systematic nomenclature in this report, we renamed potp1/p <dig>  pot <dig>  pot <dig> and pot <dig> to stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig> 

RESULTS
genome-wide survey of ppo-like gene models in solanum tuberosum
a genome-wide search of the recent s. tuberosum whole genome database in the us joint genome institute  reveals  <dig> ppo-like gene models, tentatively named stuppo <dig> to stuppo <dig> in this report . the stuppo <dig> to stuppo <dig> genes are aligned on chromosome  <dig>  and stuppo <dig> is located on chromosome  <dig>  stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig> are in close proximity to each other in a 47-kb region, while stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig> are clustered in tandem in a 144-kb region. the two regions are separated by a distance of  <dig> -kb on chromosome  <dig>  analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences of the major peptides encoded by the ppo-like genes suggests that the predicted proteins all contain three typical ppo protein domains: the tyrosinase domain , the ppo1_dwl domain  and the ppo1_kfdv domain   <cit> , but the tyrosinase domains with the putative stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig> peptides are shorter than the others and incomplete . stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig> are possibly allelic to the characterized potp1/p <dig>  pot <dig>  pot <dig> and pot <dig>  respectively, considering that the nucleotide sequences between the potential alleles are 95-99% identical . numerous ests were found from different developmental potato tissues for stuppo <dig> to stuppo <dig> . surprisingly, stuppo <dig> appears to be the only possible allele to the potp <dig> and potp <dig> genes, and no duplication of the stuppo <dig> locus was observed by searching the s. tuberosum genome sequence. stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig> are three novel ppo-like gene models predicted from this s. tuberosum genome sequence analysis. however, only few est fragments  that probably relate to the potential transcripts of these three genes were found, and the ests cover only fragmental regions of the putative transcripts . the low prevalence in est databases suggests that stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig> may be expressed at very low levels in s. tuberosum. stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig> are the only ppo-like gene models with introns. no est from s. tuberosum est databases was found for stuppo <dig>  suggesting that this gene sequence is normally not transcribed. stuppo <dig> is the only ppo-like gene model that is not clustered with the others on chromosome  <dig>  but is independently located on chromosome  <dig>  a number of ests were found for stuppo <dig>  but all of the ests were revealed in the cdna libraries from the tissues of in vitro cultured potato callus , abiotic stress treated leaf and root   <cit> , or pathogen-infected leaf and tuber    <cit> . the expression data of the supporting ests of stuppo <dig> were mostly not available because the gene model was not annotated previously and most reports focused on annotated genes. however, at least three of the stuppo <dig> related ests  were found to express differentially in the pathogen-infected potato tissues . for example, the expression level of the ck <dig> was induced 3- to 14-fold higher in potato  leaf tissue that was inoculated with fungus phytophthora infestans  leaf tissue infected with p. infestans at 24Â hours post-inoculation  and its expression level was over 17-fold higher at  <dig> hpi . the relative expression level of gt <dig> was about 3-fold higher in potato  tubers inoculated with fungus fusarium eumartii at  <dig> hpi . these data imply that stuppo <dig> is probably an inducible ppo gene expressed in response to disease defense and cell rescue  <cit> .

generation and selection of amirna-expressed transgenic potatoes
seven different amirnas were designed to target the characterized ppo genes, namely stuppo <dig> , stuppo <dig> , stuppo <dig>  and stuppo <dig>  in s. tuberosum <cit> , with amirna sequences complementary to either a specific gene or multiple targets by choosing the appropriate 21-bp region of the corresponding ppo genes . the amirna sequences were incorporated in an arabidopsis thaliana mir168a gene backbone built in a plant binary vector ,  <cit> . from transformation of thousands of explants,  <dig> to  <dig> transgenic potato lines for each amirna construct were selected and propagated for molecular genetic screening and analysis . significant down-regulation of the targeted gene expression was detected in a number of the resulting transgenic potato lines . based on the initial real-time quantitative reverse transcription pcr  assay of the in vitro cultured potato plants, the transcript levels of the stuppo <dig> genes were reduced by  <dig> to 98% in six amirppo <dig> series transgenic lines . the amirppo <dig> series expressed artificial mirna - amirppo <dig> designed to target the stuppo <dig> gene. similarly, one amirppo <dig> series line , two amirppo <dig> series lines , five amirppo <dig> series lines , two amirppo <dig> series lines , three amirppo234a series lines  and five amirppo <dig> series lines  showed substantial reduction of the target gene transcript level . mature amirnas were detected by reverse transcription pcr  in the selected amirppo <dig>  amirppo <dig>  amirppo <dig>  amirppo234a and amirppo <dig> series lines . however, no mature amirnas were revealed by rt-pcr in the  <dig> lines of the amirppo <dig> series nor the  <dig> clones of the amirppo <dig> series . the amirppo2- and amirppo234- transgenic lines were therefore excluded from further evaluations. in addition, small rna northern blots were previously done to detect amirna expression of the multiple transgenic lines listed in tableÂ  <dig>  including amirppo1- <dig> and â <dig> , amirppo2- <dig>  â <dig> , amirppo3- <dig> and â <dig>  and amirppo234- <dig> and â <dig>   <cit> .

in plants, mirna-guided rna silencing has been shown to occur mostly through complementary cleavage of the targeted mrna by argonaute proteins  <cit> . considering the highly complementary sequences between the designed amirnas and their target ppo genes, we used 5â²-race pcr to detect the possible cleavage of the ppo gene transcript. because of the multiple ppo gene members in potatoes, we developed a strategy for detecting all possible fragmented-mrna of the ppo genes but not the 5â²-capped mrna . as predicted, a 253-bp pcr product  was revealed by the nested pcr round- <dig> from the enriched poly+ rna of the young leaves of line amirppo1- <dig> . sequence analysis demonstrated the fragment included two nearly identical sequences differing by one nucleotide . both were highly related to the stuppo <dig> gene  . the first  <dig> nucleotides of the 5â²-end of the sequences were complementary to the 5â²-end of the designed amirppo <dig>  indicating the products were from cleavage of the target stuppo <dig> mrna and the cleavage site was between nucleotides  <dig> and  <dig> at the amirppo <dig> site . the presence of the cleaved stuppo <dig> mrna was also demonstrated by the specific nested pcr- <dig> . the results suggested that the expressed amirnas in the transgenic plants functioned as the small rnas that determined the silencing of the gene of interest. the following transgenic lines were selected and propagated for further biological analysis, amirppo1- <dig>  â <dig> and â <dig>  amirppo3- <dig> and â <dig>  amirppo23- <dig>  â <dig> and â <dig>  amirppo234a- <dig>  â <dig> and â <dig>  amirppo1234- <dig>  â <dig> and â <dig> .

ppo gene expressions in transgenic potatoes
no growth abnormities occurred in the amirna-expressed transgenic plants under greenhouse conditions. nor were the range of the tuber sizes and weights significantly different in either the transgenic or the wild types . relative transcript levels of stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig> genes in tuber tissues of the transgenic lines were assayed by qrt-pcr with the results illustrated in figureÂ  <dig>  for lines amirppo1- <dig>  â <dig> and â <dig>  the expression of the target stuppo <dig> gene was suppressed by  <dig> to 99%. the mrna levels of the non-targeted stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig> in lines amirppo1- <dig> and amirppo1- <dig> were similar to that of the non-transgenic, wild types âwtâ, potato controls, but the expression levels of the two genes  in line amirppo1- <dig> were unexpectedly reduced by 50% and 80%, respectively . for lines amirppo3- <dig> and â <dig>  the transcript of the target stuppo <dig> gene was reduced by over 75%. in addition, the non-targeted stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig> gene mrna levels also decreased by 50-60% in line amirppo3- <dig>  but the two gene transcripts  in line amirppo3- <dig> were close to the level observed in the wt. the non-targeted stuppo <dig> gene mrna was reduced by ~60% in line amirppo3- <dig> but the same gene mrna level in line amirppo3- <dig> was almost the same as the wt . for lines amirppo23- <dig>  â <dig> and â <dig>  the two targeted genes, stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig> were almost completely silenced  and the non-targeted stuppo <dig> gene was expressed at a level similar to the wt, but the stuppo <dig> gene mrna level was also generally 50-80% lower . for lines amirppo234a- <dig>  â <dig> and â <dig>  the mrna levels of all three targets, stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig> were 75-95% lower than the wt, but the expression of the non-targeted stuppo <dig> gene was also reduced by an average of 50% . for lines amirppo1234- <dig>  â <dig> and â <dig>  the mrna levels of the targeted stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig> genes were all suppressed by 85-99% .

ppo protein level
total ppo protein levels in the transgenic and non-transgenic potato tubers were analyzed using a semi-quantitative protein dot-blot assay. figureÂ 4a shows the values of the total ppo protein level in the transgenic potato tuber tissues relative to that in the non-transgenic wild types . the average rpr values for lines amirppo1- <dig>  â <dig> and â <dig> ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , indicating total ppo protein levels in these transgenic potato tuber tissues were on average about 23-30% lower than those in the wild type. lines amirppo3- <dig> and â <dig> showed a decline of 15-20% on average in their total ppo protein level, compared to the wild type. average reductions of 45-70% in total ppo protein level were detected in lines amirppo23- <dig>  â <dig> and â <dig>  amirppo234a- <dig>  â <dig> and â <dig>  based on their average rprs . the average rprs for lines amirppo1234- <dig>  â <dig> and â <dig> varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> , suggesting that total ppo protein concentrations in these transgenic tubers decreased on average by 73-80%, compared to the wild type .

ppo enzymatic activity
figureÂ 4b depicts the ppo enzymatic activities in the transgenic potato tuber tissues relative to those in the wild type . based on the rppos, the average ppo activity of lines amirppo1- <dig>  â <dig> and â <dig> was 25-35% lower than that of the wild type. a reduction of 15-25% in ppo activity was observed in lines amirppo3- <dig> and â <dig>  ppo activities in lines amirppo23- <dig>  â <dig> and â <dig>  amirppo234a- <dig>  â <dig> and â <dig>  amirppo1234- <dig>  â <dig> and â <dig> were in a similar range, about 75-95% less than those of the non-transgenic controls .

browning potential and browning phenotype
browning was used to measure the potential of phenolic oxidation after mechanical release of ppo proteins from their storage site in plastids  <cit> . browning potential of the transgenic potato tuber was compared to that of their non-transgenic wild types  and the results are shown in figureÂ 4c. the rbrs for lines amirppo1- <dig>  â <dig> and â <dig>  amirppo3- <dig> and â <dig> ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig> , suggesting that browning potentials of these transgenic lines were about 10-35% lower than those of the wt. browning potentials of lines amirppo23- <dig>  â <dig> and â <dig>  amirppo234a- <dig>  â <dig> and â <dig> were reduced by ~50-65% based on their rbr values of ~ <dig> - <dig> . the ranges of  <dig> - <dig>  in rbr for lines amirppo1234- <dig>  â <dig> and â <dig> indicated that the browning potential of these transgenic lines was about 65-75% lower than the comparable wild type . the browning potential results were relatively consistent with the series of visible browning phenotypes displayed after air-exposure of the freshly sectioned potato tubers at room temperature . browning or blackening tissues developed on the sectioned tuber surfaces, typically starting from the vascular ring region and advancing to the medulla with increased exposure time to oxygen in the air. the wild type tubers developed brown tissues more quickly, over a larger area and more severely than in the transgenic tubers. among the different transgenic types, the amirppo <dig> and amirppo <dig> series lines showed relatively stronger browning phenotype, followed by the amirppo <dig>  amirppo234a and amirppo <dig> series lines, based on the degree of dark color development that ranged from high to low .

statistical correlations
pearsonâs correlation coefficient  analysis indicated significantly strong and positive correlations between rpr, rppo and rbr.  in potato tuber tissues . among the potato ppo genes, the stuppo <dig> gene was highly correlated with rpr, rppo and rbr . both the stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig> genes were moderately associated with rpr, rppo and rbr , while the stuppo <dig> gene had a weak correlation with the three browning-related parameters, rpr, rppo and rbr  .

principal component analysis  generated only two principle components with eigenvalues exceeding  <dig>   . the two components explained 87% of the total variance. the first principle component  accounted for 71% of total variance and had approximately equal positive loading for the variables stuppo <dig> gene, stuppo <dig> gene, stuppo <dig> gene, rpr, rppo and rbr. each of the above variables contributed about 14-18% to the pc <dig>  suggesting their equivalent proportion in the different transgenic lines. in contrast, the variable stuppo <dig> gene also contributed positively to the pc <dig> but with a lower score . the second principle component  only accounted for 16% of the total variance and was mainly influenced by positive loading of stuppo <dig> gene  . the score plot of the pc <dig> and pc <dig> paralleled the distribution of the browning phenotypes . lines amirppo1- <dig>  â <dig> and â <dig>  amirppo3- <dig> and â <dig> and the wt, susceptible to browning were scattered on the right side of the plot. in contrast, lines amirppo23- <dig>  â <dig> and â <dig>  amirppo234a- <dig>  â <dig> and â <dig>  amirppo1234- <dig>  â <dig> and â <dig>  resistant to browning were separated to the left side of the plot. noticeably, lines amirppo1234- <dig>  â <dig> and â <dig>  which inhibited stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig> gene expressions and had the least browning potential, were grouped within the lower quadrant with negative factor scores in both pc <dig> and pc <dig>  and opposite the wt with positive factor scores in both pc <dig> and pc <dig> 

hierarchical clustering analysis of the transgenic lines on the variables rpr, rppo, rbr and ppo gene expression levels produced two major clusters, subcluster- <dig>  and subcluster- <dig>  . members in each of the subclusters displayed a similar pattern with regards to expression trends in the variables rpr, rppo and rbr. statistically, subcluster- <dig> expressed considerably higher values  of rpr, rppo and rbr than subcluster- <dig> . interestingly, subcluster- <dig> consisted the wt and the transgenic lines designed for targeting a single ppo gene , including lines amirppo1- <dig>  â <dig> and â <dig>  amirppo3- <dig> and â <dig>  whereas subcluster- <dig> included transgenic lines designed for targeting multiple ppo genes, namely, the lines amirppo23- <dig>  â <dig> and â <dig>  amirppo234a- <dig>  â <dig> and â <dig>  amirppo1234- <dig>  â <dig> and â <dig>  the transgenic lines were further divided into smaller sub-groups based on their different scores . for example, the group of lines amirppo1- <dig> and amirppo1- <dig> displayed similar level of stuppo <dig> gene suppression but showed almost normal gene transcript levels of stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig> . although the gene transcript levels of both stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig> in line amirppo3- <dig> were lower by ~70% than those of the wt , the two clustered together because the values of rpr, rppo and rbr in amirppo3- <dig> were closer to those in the wt than other transgenic lines . lines amirppo1- <dig> and amirppo3- <dig> grouped based on their similar gene expression levels of stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig>  and the generally similar values of rpr, rppo and rbr . the group of lines amirppo23- <dig> and amirppo23- <dig> showed strong down-regulation of both the stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig> genes, moderate down-regulation of the stuppo <dig> gene , as well as similar rppo and rbr values . three amirppo234a series lines  clustered together based on their similar down-regulated gene expression levels for stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig> , and their similar low values for rpr, rppo and rbr . the three amirppo234a lines further clustered with line amirppo23- <dig>  because the four lines performed similarly in almost all of the variables except that the stuppo <dig> mrna level in the amirppo23- <dig> was moderately higher than in the amirppo234a lines . three amirppo <dig> series lines  grouped closely because they had very similar expression trends in all of the  <dig> variables .

discussion
ppos are encoded by a gene family composed of multiple highly conserved gene members in many plant species  <cit> . the differential temporal and spatial expression patterns of ppo genes in potato, poplar and tomato indicate the functional diversities among the ppo gene members  <cit> . however, the lack of specific loss-of-function mutants of different ppo genes has impeded progress in understanding the diversified gene functions in the family. before the present report, several studies reported knockdown of ppo gene expression using sirna strategies by transformation with hundreds of base pairs of the ppo gene fragments  <cit> . the strategies proved successful in suppression of overall ppo activities and reduction of ppo-mediated browning reactions, but the methods were not able to identify the roles of the individual ppo gene members. the heterogeneous sirnas generated in the transformed plants did not target a specific ppo gene but affected others of the family as well because the ppo gene family shares high homology in nucleotide sequences among its members  <cit> . our data demonstrated that ppo gene isoforms can be suppressed individually or simultaneously using amirnas. in addition to significantly down-regulating the ppo genes of interest as predicted in our construct design, several exceptions were observed based on the qrt-pcr assay results . for example, an unexpected moderate to high reduction of the stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig> mrna levels in line amirppo1- <dig>  a stuppo <dig> gene knockdown transformant, and an unforeseen moderate decrease of the stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig> gene transcript copies in line amirppo3- <dig>  a stuppo <dig> gene knockdown mutant were detected although the analogue regions of the affected genes have 6â8Â bp mismatches to the targets of the designed amirnas . an 8-bp complementarity to the 5â² seed region   <cit>  of the amirppo <dig> in a stuppo <dig> gene sequence region might be related to an unanticipated moderate down-regulation of the non-targeted stuppo <dig> gene in line amirppo3- <dig> . apart from strong down-regulations of both stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig> genes in lines amirppo23- <dig>  â <dig> and â <dig>  stuppo <dig> gene mrna in these lines was at a moderate to low level, suggesting stuppo <dig> gene expression was also targeted by amirppo <dig> . the amirppo <dig> was initially designed to target both stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig> genes based on incomplete stuppo <dig> gene sequence data . later analysis of a stuppo <dig> gene related est sequence  found a region with only one mismatch to the target of amirppo <dig> . a previous study reported mismatches at position  <dig> were mirna admissible targets but reduced mirna-guided cleaving efficiency in vitro and phenotypic effects in vivo <cit> . although the possible target region of the stuppo <dig> gene has mismatches at two positions compared to the perfect target sequence of amirppo234a , the stuppo <dig> gene was moderately down-regulated in amirppo234a- <dig>  â <dig> and â <dig> lines, along with strong down-regulation of the stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig> genes . it is worth noting that g:u wobble pairing was introduced for targeting stuppo <dig> gene in amirppo234a and stuppo <dig> gene in amirppo <dig>   <cit> , and the corresponding target genes, stuppo <dig> gene in the amirppo234a series lines and stuppo <dig> gene in the amirppo <dig> series lines, were indeed down-regulated in both cases . we failed to detect the designed amirnas from any of the transgenic plants transformed with the constructs for amirppo <dig>  and amirppo <dig>  for unknown reasons . investigation of the principles and complexities between amirnas and target recognition was beyond the scope of this study. nonetheless, our data showed that amirnas are a potent regulator for modulating expression of potato ppo gene isoforms individually or in combination, and amirna targets are more predictable and detectable than the sirnaâs. however, not all designed amirnas were expressed with similar efficiency in the transgenic plants and off-target effects also occurred occasionally. appropriate detection methods are required for screening the desired transgenic traits in plants expressing amirnas.

individual or cumulative down-regulation of ppo genes did not usually cause up-regulation of the other ppo genes, except for transgenic line amirppo1- <dig> that showed a reduction of the targeted stuppo <dig> gene mrna level by about 90% but also an increase of approximately 40% of the non-targeted stuppo <dig> gene transcript . this implied that different ppo genes may be regulated independently reflecting their diversified functions in the potato plant. suppression of ppo gene expressions in our transgenic plants resulted in a reduced level of total ppo protein, but the reductions varied depending on the knockdown targets. for example, expression of stuppo <dig> was suppressed by  <dig> to 98% in lines amirppo1- <dig> and amirppo1- <dig> , and the total ppo protein level in these two transgenic lines was reduced by ~ <dig> to 30% . coincidentally, the transgenic lines amirppo23- <dig>  â <dig> and â <dig>  which simultaneously down-regulated the stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig> gene , had reduced total ppo protein level of about 70% . total ppo protein level was reduced by 15% on average in line amirppo3- <dig> that showed suppression of the stuppo <dig> gene  and stuppo <dig> gene  . these data indicated that stuppo <dig> protein probably contributed 55% or more to the total ppo protein levels in the non-transgenic potato tuber tissues. the failure to generate stuppo2-knockdown mutants made it difficult to evaluate the accuracy of the estimation. however, pearson correlation coefficient indicated that 70% of the variation in total ppo protein level in potato tuber tissue was explained by stuppo <dig> gene expression . analysis of ppo gene expression in the non-transgenic potato tubers by qrt-pcr found that the stuppo <dig> gene contributed 67% to the total ppo gene transcript level, followed by stuppo <dig>  28%, stuppo <dig>  4% and stuppo <dig>  less than  <dig> % . this also indicated that stuppo <dig> is a major contributor to the ppo protein content of the wt potato tubers. noticeably, stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig> genes were all down-regulated by 90% or more in transgenic amirppo1234- <dig>  â <dig> and â <dig> lines , but the total ppo protein level remained between  <dig> and 30% in their tuber tissues. an explanation for this is that the ppo proteins that accumulate in the plastid probably accumulated for a longer duration than the cytosol-produced ppo mrnas  <cit> .

a striking reduction of ppo-mediated browning has been described previously through suppression of overall ppo gene expression using sirna strategies  <cit> . here, we have shown that it requires that stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig> genes were all suppressed simultaneously to achieve optimal inhibition of ppo activity and non-browning phenotype in transgenic potato tuber tissue , a point not well known or understood previously. it was of particular interest that a series of low browning phenotypes were generated though suppression of the highly conserved ppo gene isoforms when suppressed both individually and in combination using this amirna strategy . analysis of these transgenic clones clearly demonstrated the positive correlations between ppo protein levels , ppo enzymatic activity  and browning potential  . for example, a ~20-30% reduction at ppo protein level in the tubers of lines amirppo1- <dig> and â <dig>  where the stuppo <dig> gene expression were down-regulated by over 90%, showed a parallel decrease of both ppo activity and browning potential in the tuber tissues. simultaneous down-regulation of stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig> genes in lines amirppo1234- <dig>  â <dig> and â <dig> resulted in 70-80% loss of tuber ppo protein. as a result of this, ppo enzymatic activity was reduced by ~90% and browning potential by 70-75%. browning potential correlated better with the ppo protein level than with ppo enzymatic activity. ppo enzymatic activity appeared to decrease relatively faster in our assays than browning reaction . the difference may have resulted from different sample preparation methods used for the two assays. ppo enzymatic activity was more temporally sensitive after the enzymes were mechanically isolated from the plastids, while browning potential recorded the accumulation of pigments in the samples during the time period of the assay. in spite of the small discrepancy between these two data sets, the trend was consistent among the ppo gene down-regulated transgenic plants; the lower the ppo protein level in the potato tuber tissues, the less the ppo activity and browning potential.

our survey of the recent s. tuberosum whole genome database  revealed  <dig> ppo-like gene models . stuppo <dig> to stuppo <dig> are clustered on chromosome  <dig> and only stuppo <dig> is located on chromosome  <dig>  stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig> are allelic to previously characterized potp1/p <dig>  pot <dig>  pot <dig> and pot <dig>  respectively, in this report, based on their 95-99% identities at nucleotide level  <cit> . the deduced peptides also show 95-98% identical positions between the corresponding alleles . surprisingly, stuppo <dig> is the only possible allele to the potp <dig> and the potp <dig> genes, and no duplication of the stuppo <dig> locus in the s. tuberosum genome was discovered. stuppo <dig> to stuppo <dig> are five novel ppo-like gene models predicted in the s. tuberosum genome . however, the low to no prevalence in the est databases for the stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig> implies these gene models may be under-transcribed in s. tuberosum . in addition, the important tyrosinase domains  for ppo enzymatic activity are incomplete in the peptides of the deduced translation of the stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig> gene models, suggesting that these two may not be functional like other ppo isoforms   <cit> . stuppo <dig> is probably a ppo-like gene involved in disease defense and cell rescue because the ests that support for this gene model were dominantly discovered in the tissues of in vitro cultured potato callus, abiotic stress treated leaf and root or pathogen-infected leaf and tuber, and several of the ests expressed at significantly higher levels in the pathogen-infected potato tissues   <cit> . taken together, the number of members of the potato ppo gene family are possibly larger than previously reported, but stuppo <dig> , stuppo <dig> , stuppo <dig>  and stuppo <dig>  are probably the major developmentally regulated ppo genes in s. tuberosum and they are subjected to the targets of the amirnas expressed in the transgenic lines. however, extensive experimental studies are required to investigate the existence and function of the potential stuppo <dig> to stuppo <dig> genes.

CONCLUSIONS
ppo-mediated browning damage is one of the main causes of quality loss in fresh fruit and processed food. it is of great importance and interest to produce crop varieties with low ppo activity for the food industry. our results have shown that stuppo <dig> , stuppo <dig> , stuppo <dig>  and stuppo <dig>  genes were the major contributors to the total ppo protein content but the effect of the individuals was not equal and that ppo activity in the tuber tissues paralleled the protein content data. suppression of expression of one or a few ppo genes did not cause overexpression of the others, but the greatest reduction of ppo activity and the most complete non-browning phenotypes required simultaneous suppression of the expression of stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig>  stuppo <dig> and stuppo <dig> genes. our demonstration that ppo gene expression in potato can be suppressed by introduction of 21-nt small rna regulators provides a new strategy for developing low- or non-browning crops. it also suggests that amirnas can be applied to silence closely related members of multi-gene family for functional genomics study in non-model plants. in addition, a series of ppo gene knockdown mutants predictably generated provide us important resources for future investigations of the role of ppo genes in functions such as plant development, stress and insect and fungal defense response.
