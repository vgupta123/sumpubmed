BACKGROUND
transposable elements  make up a large part of eukaryotic genomes. they represent a genomic fraction of 3% in baker's yeast  <cit> , ~20% in fruit fly  <cit> , 45% in human  <cit>  and over 80% in maize  <cit> . due to their repetitive nature and to the fact that they harbor regulatory signals, tes are responsible for chromosomal rearrangements  <cit> , fragmental gene movements  <cit>  and for the evolution of gene regulation and function  <cit> . hence, the activity of tes is currently considered to be one of the major processes in genome evolution.

in plants, long terminal repeat  retrotransposons are the most common type of te: they are ubiquitous in the plant kingdom  <cit>  and are the main constituents of large plant genomes  <cit> . moreover, these elements have been shown to be responsible for wide genome expansions  <cit>  and are considered to be major players in the remarkable variation of genome size observed in flowering plants  <cit> , along with polyploidy.

ltr retrotransposons are class i tes and thus replicate using a rna intermediate, through a "copy-and-paste" mechanism. they are related to retroviruses with which they share their structure: the complete copies consist of two ltrs that flank an internal region. ltr sequences contain the signals for transcription initiation and termination, while the internal region encodes the proteins that are necessary for the retrotransposition cycle. ltr retrotransposons are classified into two major families: the ty1/copia-like and ty3/gypsy-like elements.

plant ltr retrotransposons vary in size from  <dig> to  <dig> kb and harbor ltrs that vary in size from a few hundreds bases to several kilobases  <cit> . ltrs are terminated by a short inverted dinucleotide, usually 5'-tg-3' and 5'-ca-3'  <cit> . their well-defined structure, their role in genome size expansion, their prevalence and their repetitive nature make ltr retrotransposons good models to study genome evolution. in all plants analyzed, ltr retrotransposons appear to have undergone recent amplifications   <cit> . ltr retrotransposons are nevertheless present in all plant lineages and thus of ancient origin .

the distribution and structure of ltr retrotransposons have been studied in several species, in particular in the two model plants for which a nearly complete genomic sequence is available: arabidopsis thaliana  <cit>  and rice   <cit> . in rice, however, these studies have been based on either numerous ltr retrotransposon families but within a relatively small portion of the genome  <cit>  or small subsets of ltr retrotransposon families within approximately the entire genome  <cit> . in our study, a set of  <dig> ltr retrotransposon families was analyzed on the almost complete rice genome . this comprehensive structural analysis provides insights into both the amplification and the subsequent elimination of ltr retrotransposon sequences and reveals the highly dynamic nature of the rice genome.

RESULTS
global analysis of  <dig> ltr retrotransposon families: copy number, current genomic fraction and dna amount deleted since their insertion
we extracted the paralogous copies of  <dig> ltr retrotransposons families  from the rice genome sequence using blaster, a program suite based on the blast program  <cit>  and improved for the detection of transposable elements  <cit> . through this initial blaster search, we retrieved from the rice genome sequence more than  <dig>  ltr retrotransposon copies, with copy numbers per family ranging from a few copies to over  <dig> copies per haploid genome . because the total sequence of the  <dig> rice pseudomolecules analyzed represents only ~94%  of the rice genome, we believe, however, that the copy numbers of these families could possibly be higher.

the elements highlighted in bold correspond to the elements for which the ltr position was validated . ref.: reference; seq.: sequence; nb.:number; ins.: insertion; min.:minimum; q.:quartile; med.:median; max.:maximum

altogether, these elements represent  <dig> %  of the current rice genome. if all the copies mined correspond to real paralogous copies of the families and if their size upon insertion was similar to that of their corresponding reference copy, they represented  <dig>  mb upon insertion, suggesting that  <dig>  mb  of the dna conferred by their insertion has been removed.

the analysis of the mined copies revealed that some reference copies harbor insertions, most of them smaller than  <dig> bp, and a few larger than  <dig> bp. it also revealed that one family shares ltr with a large retrotransposon derivative . to correct for the possible detection of false paralogous copies, we therefore applied a filter discarding any fragment smaller than  <dig> bp, and did not take into account families with larger inserts or other problematic features . with this new filter, we estimate that  <dig> copies from  <dig> families, which represented  <dig>  mb upon insertion, remain today in the rice genome as  <dig>  mb, leading to a loss of  <dig>  mb .

we believe that the first data are an over-estimate and that the latter may be an under-estimate of the total percentage of dna eliminated from the rice genome. hence, we estimate that the percentage of dna that has been eliminated from the rice genome since the insertion of the detected copies is comprised between 61% and 78%.

to get an overview of the deletion process for each family, we computed the distribution of the copy size relative to the reference copy size . this analysis revealed that, for all families, most of the copies are highly truncated . in addition, since each genomic copy shows a high sequence identity with its corresponding reference copy , all the copies belonging to a given family also share high sequence identity. taken together, the high degree of deletion and the high level of identity between copies within a family suggest that ltr retrotransposon copies start being eliminated from the genome shortly after their insertion.

rice ltr retrotransposons amplify in burst-like patterns which differ among families
to provide a global overview of the ltr retrotransposon sequence turn-over process in the rice genome, we first wanted to estimate the insertion dates of the largest set of copies possible, for each family.

for copies with  <dig> ltrs, the best method to estimate insertion date is based on the divergence between the two ltrs of each copy  <cit> . for copies lacking one or two ltrs , the method currently used is based on pairwise nucleotide identity between elements that are closely related at the phylogenetic level or between genomic copies and a consensus of the element  <cit> . however, this method estimates the overall insertion date of the set of copies as a whole, and cannot estimate the insertion date for each individual genomic copy. moreover, consensus-based methods greatly depend on the quality of the consensus and thus on the selection of the copies used to build it.

to overcome these caveats, we designed a new method  to estimate the insertion date of the truncated copies. as we showed in a previous work on three rice gypsy-like ltr retrotransposons  <cit> , rice ltr retrotransposons amplify in bursts, leading to the insertion of many related copies in a short period of time. if this is true for all rice retrotransposons, it should be possible to find, for each truncated copy, a copy with two ltrs that originated from the same amplification burst, and has approximately the same age. the age of a given truncated copy can then be estimated using both the age of the most related copy with two ltrs, and the sequence identity existing between this complete copy and the truncated one .

by applying this method on the complete dataset of all genomic copies detected , we could analyze the amplification timing of  <dig> ltr retrotransposon families , for which an insertion date could be estimated for more than  <dig> copies. the histograms of these data, presented in figure  <dig>  show at least one peak per family, revealing that the  <dig> families have all undergone at least one burst of amplification. these bursts, however, vary in extent and age between families. some families such as hopi/osr <dig>  osr <dig>  houba/osr <dig> and osr <dig> have undergone very recent amplification , whereas that of other families, such as osr <dig>  osr <dig>  osr <dig>  osr <dig>  rire <dig>  is more ancient. some families, such as dagul or houba/osr <dig>  seem to have undergone several bursts of amplification, since several peaks are noticeable. the dates of these peaks vary between families from around  <dig>  and  <dig>  for dagul to  <dig>  and  <dig> – <dig>  for houba/osr <dig>  some of the older peaks, such as the second peak for dagul, could only be observed through the addition of the dated truncated copies, illustrating that estimating the insertion date of truncated copies is important to describe the amplification process ltr retrotransposons in rice as accurately as possible.

in terms of magnitude, some families, such as hopi/osr <dig>  osr <dig> or houba/osr <dig>  have undergone large bursts of amplification, involving over  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> copies per burst, respectively. interestingly, dagul, hopi/osr <dig> and houba/osr <dig>  which are among the  <dig> most recently amplified elements, were previously characterized by our team using the subtractive "representational difference analysis"  cloning technique between rice and foxtail millet  <cit> , and were subsequently shown to have inserted recently in the rice genome  <cit> . this suggests that the rda technique mainly allows the extraction of young highly repeated sequences. the new data concerning these three elements confirm those that we obtained for 30% of the rice genome  <cit> . in particular, they confirm that the amplification burst of hopi/osr <dig> was large and rapid, and took place in a very recent past  <cit>  or may still be actively transposing.

the elimination of ltr retrotransposon sequences is efficient in rice, with a half-life of 3– <dig> my
as shown above, we estimate the amount of ltr retrotransposon dna removed from the rice genome around 61–78%. considering that most of this removal occurred within the last  <dig> my , we estimate the half-life of a ltr retrotransposon sequence to be comprised between  <dig> my and  <dig> my. in a recent paper, ma and collaborators  <cit>  estimated the half-life of a retrotransposon sequence in the rice genome to be less than  <dig> my, using the pairwise comparison method for global insertion date estimation of the copies and a conservative substitution rate that is half as fast as ours . after adjusting their results with the substitution rate we used, our results on a large sample are in agreement with a half-life of  <dig> my. in both studies large deletions could not be taken into account in the elimination process. since such deletions could induce the elimination of one or more complete elements, we believe that the elimination of ltr retrotransposons sequences in the rice genome is even more efficient than a  <dig> my half-life.

to complete our analysis of the elimination process, we classified the copies according to their truncation level, into copies that harbored two ltrs, one ltr and the internal region, only one ltr, and only the internal region . results of this analysis, shown in table  <dig>  reveal that most of the copies are highly truncated. for all families except osr <dig> and osr <dig> , the copies harboring two ltrs represent less than 50% of the total number, with a median at  <dig> %.

frag.: fragment; ltr: long terminal repeat; ir: internal region.

using these data along with the timing data obtained for the families , we found that the percentage of truncated/complete copies is correlated with the age of the family, with the younger families having fewer truncated copies than the older ones. for instance, hopi/osr <dig>  which has amplified mainly within the last  <dig>  my  shows 40% of complete copies, whereas for osr <dig>  which has amplified around  <dig> – <dig> my ago , these copies represent only  <dig> %. these results are in agreement with previous studies, in which the same correlation was found  <cit> . this feature, however, cannot be viewed on figure  <dig>  because no insertion date could be estimated for most ancient copies.

in addition, the proportion of the different types of truncated copies over time scale increments of  <dig>  , presented in figure  <dig>  reveals very young truncated copies , revealing that the elimination of ltr retrotransposon sequences is very efficient in the rice genome.

processes of dna removal: solo ltrs and accumulation of deletion analysis
the global analysis of our data showed that the elimination of rice ltr retrotransposon sequences is efficient in rice . but what are the mechanisms responsible for the elimination of the copies? as shown in previous studies  <cit> , the elimination of ltr retrotransposon sequences in plants is the result of several cellular processes such as homologous recombination , and the accumulation of small deletions through illegitimate recombination. in our study, we believe that the "ltr" fragments have arisen from both homologous recombination and the accumulation of small deletions or larger rearrangements, and that the two other types of truncation  have arisen from the last two processes only. to study the formation of solo ltrs and other mechanisms, we analyzed separately the temporal dynamics of  the "ltr" fragments and  the "ltr-ir" and "ir" fragments.

solo ltr formation
our analysis of the "ltr" fragments per  <dig>  time scale increment  revealed that the different ltr retrotransposons harbor different amounts of "ltr" sequences. for instance, dagul, osr <dig> or osr <dig> display a large number of "ltrs" compared to the other types of truncated sequences, whereas houba/osr <dig> or osr <dig> do not show as many . the formation of solo ltrs has been proposed to occur through unequal homologous recombination  <cit>  and/or double-strand break repair  <cit> . in both cases, both the size of the internal region and the ltr size would impact the number of solo ltrs formed:  since these mechanisms are based on the physical closeness of the two ltrs, the number of solo ltrs is expected to decrease with the size of the internal region, and  since they are based on the presence of homology between the two ltrs, the number of solo ltrs is expected to increase with the size of ltr. because both internal region and ltr sizes vary through time in a given copy, these points can be made only when comparing elements that show similar insertion times, for instance hopi/osr <dig> vs.osr <dig> and osr <dig> vs. osr <dig>  hopiosr <dig> has a larger internal region , and a larger ltr  than osr <dig>  its ltr frequency is higher . osr <dig> and osr <dig> have similar internal region size, but osr <dig> has bigger ltrs  and its ltr frequency is higher . therefore, ltr size seems to have an impact on solo ltr formation, but not the size of the internal region, suggesting that formation of solo ltrs is a family-dependent process. more data are however needed to confirm this pattern.

accumulation of small deletions
the accumulation of small deletions has been proposed to occur through illegitimate recombination, as shown by the observation of small patches of micro-homology flanking the deleted sequences  <cit> . to better estimate the efficiency of this process, we analyzed the deletion rate and dna loss rate. since illegitimate recombination is supposed to be a general mechanism in the cell, it is expected to affect similarly all types of ltr retrotransposons and truncated sequences. therefore, under the assumption that the accumulation of deletion is similar in all families, and occurs continuously through time, we estimated the deletion rate and the deletion loss rate by combining the data obtained for  <dig> families using a method derived from one classically used in animals .

this half-life of  <dig> my is very different from the one we calculated based on the global size of the copies because it does not take into account selection against te insertions and has to be considered as a quasi-neutral deletion rate estimate. homologous recombination and selection will accelerate the elimination of tes and thus increase the global dna loss observed for these sequences. moreover, with this method, we detect only the accumulation of small deletions , and do not take into account larger rearrangements . in particular, because it is based on the analysis of the sequence pairs in the terminal tree forks, it takes into account only the newer deletions. if small deletions appear faster than large rearrangements in the rice genome, some large rearrangements may not have been taken into account by this method.

these results reveal that, even though the neutral accumulation of small deletions plays a role in ltr retrotransposons dna removal in rice, this force is not the predominant force shaping genome size.

power and limits of our analyis
any comprehensive analysis of the structure and evolution of ltr retrotransposons in a given species requires a large ltr retrotransposon database and a large genomic sequence as starting point. for our search to be as representative as possible of the whole genome, we analyzed  <dig> ltr retrotransposons families, including  <dig> gypsy-like and  <dig> copia-like families. as revealed by our study, these families are low, – middle- and high-copy number families . we thus believe that this sample is representative of ltr retrotransposons in rice. the use of such a large database, coupled with the analysis of a large amount of rice sequence  allows a particularly extensive characterization of the evolutionary dynamics of ltr retrotransposons in rice. to our knowledge, this is the first time that such an extensive study is made.

the second key point is the quality of the detection. in particular, estimating how fast copies are eliminated from a genome requires to accurately mine complete copies , as well as small fragments that have been highly truncated. the use of blaster, a program suite based on the blast program  <cit>  and improved for the detection of transposable elements  <cit> , is particularly powerful to mine such copies. along with the use of blaster, the use of a database containing sequences of both the triggered ltr retrotransposons and other rice repetitive elements , allows a powerful mining of copies fragmented by other insertions. moreover, the detection of very fragmented copies was enhanced by using the ltr retrotransposon database as subject and the genome as query in the blaster search.

because of these features, we believe that our method detects accurately both complete copies and truncated fragments. since an accurate detection and estimate of the copy size is a critical point in any study on ltr retrotransposons evolutionary dynamics, we analyzed the distribution of copy size for each family.

first, we expected that the longest copy detected and the reference copy would have the same size because insertions in genomic copies  were not taken into account in the computation of the copy size. results of the blaster output, presented in table  <dig>  reveal that this is true for most of the families . for  <dig> families , the slight difference in size between the longest copy and the reference copy  is due to the homogenization of the two ltrs in the reference copy . for four other families , however, the longest copy detected is more than 5% shorter than the reference copy, which suggests that this copy was not detected by our search. osr <dig>  osr <dig> and osr <dig> were originally characterized by searching part of the rice genome sequence  <cit> . since this sample does not completely overlap ours, it is likely that these reference copies were not included in our genomic sample. for rire <dig>  however, the reference copy could not be detected because this sequence is not derived from a genomic copy, but is a chimeric sequence that originated from the cloning of several genomic copies  <cit> .

second, we expected that some short copies could be false paralogous copies of our targeted families. mainly, we suspected that some of them could correspond to  uncharacterized repeated sequences inserted in the reference copy, and  fragments corresponding to coding regions of uncharacterized elements sharing a high sequence identity with the element analyzed . to check for these possibilities, we looked at the position of the mined copies on the reference copy, using the alignment that we had generated. this analysis revealed that some reference copies harbor insertions, most of them smaller than  <dig> bp, and a few larger than  <dig> bp. it also revealed that one family shares ltr with a lard element.

thus, we believe that such a verification step is essential to interpret the data. for instance, one may not want to perform a detailed analysis of a ltr retrotransposon that shares ltrs with a lard element, because this feature would artefactually increase the number of solitary ltrs detected. in order not to take into account possible false paralogous copies, we applied a filter discarding any fragment smaller than  <dig> bp, and did not analyze the deletion process in families with larger inserts or other problematic features . this conservative strategy had mainly two draw-backs: first, some real paralogous copies with a size below  <dig> bp would be missed due to the filter, leading to an under-estimate of copy number and total fraction of the genome occupied by these elements. however, since the raw data most probably over-estimate these numbers, we believe that the comparison of the two outputs  give a good estimate of these parameters. second, it decreased the number of families that could be used to perform a detailed analysis of the deletion process. however, by starting with a large number of  <dig> families, we could estimate the deletion process for  <dig> families, a large enough number to get an estimate that is representative of the genome.

finally, the use of a new method to date truncated copies allowed us to get a more detailed appreciation of the integration and elimination processes than with complete copies alone, and, therefore, a more accurate estimate of temporal parameters of the deletion processes. we showed in earlier studies  that three rice gypsy-like ltr retrotransposons amplify through burst of amplification. here, the use of complete copies harboring  <dig> ltrs revealed recent amplification bursts for several other families, suggesting that this is a general feature of rice ltr retrotransposons. therefore, we developed a method to date ltr retrotransposon fragments based on sequence identity between truncated fragments and a complete copy that comes for the same amplification burst. this method requires the conservation of at least one complete copy per burst. therefore, we did not expect to estimate the insertion date of all truncated copies, particularly for ancient ones, because copies of ancient burst were expected to be all truncated. it is thus possible that we missed some ancient bursts. however, this should not have any impact on the detection of the more recent bursts that we detect.

because old copies are more likely to be deleted than new ones, this technique revealed ancient amplification events, thus improving our characterization of the amplification process. moreover, the estimation of the insertion date for all types of copies allowed us to analyze the number of truncated copies per time period, leading to a more accurate characterization of the deletion process. however, due to the stringent parameters that we used to ensure a robust association between a truncated copy and a dated copy harboring two ltrs , the insertion date could not be estimated for all truncated copies .

finally, our method allows an extensive characterization of ltr retrotransposon copies in today's rice genome, as well as their temporal dynamics of insertion and deletion, leading to a comprehensive analysis of the processes involved in their evolutionary dynamics in the rice genome.

our results are based on the assumption that the copies extracted are derived from the insertion of complete copies. this assumes that the mechanism of retrotransposition do not lead to truncated copies upon integration. this mechanism has been well studied in retroviruses, and it is commonly accepted that it also applies to ltr retrotransposons. to our knowledge, insertion of truncated copies has not been described, meaning that if this is possible, it would occur rarely. consequently, we believe that the frequency of such events is low, and should not have a large impact on our results.

during our analysis, we revealed for hopi/osr <dig> and osr <dig> the presence of truncated copies sharing a deleted region compared to the reference copy. these two subsets of copies also share similar insertion times, suggesting that they correspond to the amplification of truncated copies. since this was observed for  <dig> elements only, we believe that this process does not affect tremendously our conclusions on the overall deletion process. moreover, since the formation of small deletions is a cellular process and should therefore affect similarly all types of elements, the conclusions drawn on the deletion rate are not affected by this observation.

CONCLUSIONS
through the analysis of  <dig> rice ltr retrotransposon families, and the use of a new method to estimate the insertion date of both truncated and complete copies, we could precisely describe the amplification and elimination of ltr retrotransposon sequences in the rice genome . we show that most of the copies were inserted within the last  <dig> my, and that the amplification process varies both in timing and extent between families. the copies are subsequently efficiently eliminated from the genome, through both solo ltr formation and accumulation of deletions. we estimate the half-life of ltr retrotransposon sequences in the rice genome to be less than  <dig> my. however, if only the neutral accumulation of small deletions is taken into account, this half-life would be close to  <dig> my, revealing that this process is not a major force of ltr retrotransposon removal in the rice genome. rather, negative selection of these sequences or larger rearrangements may be involved. altogether, these results reveal a high turn-over of ltr retrotransposon sequences in the rice genome and therefore provide an explanation for the rapid differentiation of intergenic regions in grass genomes. to our knowledge, our study is the first to analyze rice ltr retrotransposons in such an extensive way.
