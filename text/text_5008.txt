BACKGROUND
urodele amphibians, for example the axolotl, are well known for their incredible ability to regenerate appendages, such as the limb. however, axolotls are unable to regenerate the lens of the eye following its removal . in contrast, the anuran amphibian xenopus laevis, in which limb regeneration is subject to an ontogenic decline leading up to metamorphosis, is able to regenerate a new lens from the overlying central corneal cells . this process was first described by freeman in  <dig>  and involves a transdifferentiation of one cell type  to another   <cit> . it differs from the better-known wolffian regeneration in adult newts, where a new lens is formed from cells of the pigmented dorsal iris epithelium and is known as cornea to lens transdifferentiation, or clt  <cit> .

the trigger for clt in vivo is exposure of the outer corneal cells to an unidentified factor present in the vitreous of the eye, most likely originating from the neural retina  <cit> . in vitro, epithelial cells from any location within the lentogenic area, a region extending twice the diameter of the eye  <cit>  can respond to the vitreous factor and initiate clt, whereas cells outside this region are refractory to the trigger  <cit> . the limitation of lens forming ability to the lentogenic area correlates with pax <dig> expression, and ectopic pax <dig> in flank epidermis can confer competence to undergo clt  <cit> . as with other cases of regeneration in xenopus, there is an ontogenic decline in the ability to initiate clt in vivo  <cit> , however, this is thought to arise due to a mechanical barrier formed by the healing of the inner cornea rather than a loss of competence  <cit> . interestingly, the close relative xenopus tropicalis, which exhibits more rapid healing of the inner cornea following lentectomy, fails to initiate clt in vivo although reciprocal transplants show that the central corneal cells of x. tropicalis can respond to the vitreous factor  <cit> .

fifty years on from the discovery of clt, we still know little of the molecular mechanisms that drive the process. while it is generally believed that transdifferentiation occurs directly and not via proliferation of stem cells  <cit> , a direct demonstration of this is lacking. jon henry and colleagues have shown that several transcription factors known to be fundamental to lens development are re-expressed during the process of clt , suggesting that similar regulation of gene expression drives differentiation during both development and regeneration of the lens  <cit> . previous est analysis of corneal cells undergoing clt has identified several hundred transcripts from a library constructed from corneal tissue at 1- <dig> days after lens removal  <cit> .

despite the identification of multiple candidate pathways from these expression studies, functional analysis of potential transdifferentiation factors has so far been lacking. a single in vitro study demonstrated the ability of acidic fibroblast growth factor  to induce lens fibre formation in cultured outer corneas, although morphological organisation of the fibres does not occur  <cit> . in the current study, we have used a transgenic line of xenopus laevis to reveal a need for functional bmp signalling during the process of clt along with a microarray strategy to identify genes and pathways that are likely to be specifically involved in the process of transdifferentiation. the microarray strategy differs from previous library based approaches in that we can specifically compare expression in wounded, non-regenerating corneas to that in corneal tissue undergoing clt, with the aim of identifying genes associated with the regenerative process. analysis of this microarray data indicates an important role for wingless/int <dig>  pathway signalling in clt and suggests that, as with tail and limb regeneration in xenopus  <cit> , several morphogens may be acting to trigger the regenerative process of clt. we have identified several new candidates for clt, some of which are also involved in lens formation during development, and many of which are associated with lens pathology, particularly cataract development.

RESULTS
lens regeneration is dependent on bmp signalling
we have previously shown that overexpression of noggin, an inhibitor of bmp signalling, can prevent regeneration of tails and limbs in xenopus tadpoles  <cit> . the stable transgenic line, n <dig> contains a single insertion of the double transgene hsp70:noggin;γ-crystallin:gfp. the eyes of n <dig> tadpoles are marked by green fluorescent protein , which accumulates in the inner lens cells regardless of the temperature at which the animals are kept . when the gfp expressing lens is surgically removed and the cornea replaced, no green fluorescence can be detected. if lentectomised n <dig> tadpoles are raised at 24°c, gfp is first detected after 3- <dig> days, indicating that clt is underway and new lens cells are expressing γ-crystallin . in our hands, clt occurs in 60-70% of cases, and after two weeks, the new lens is morphologically indistinguishable from the original. however, if the n <dig> tadpoles are subjected to heat shock, by placing in water at 34°c for  <dig> minutes each day, clt usually fails, and no new expression of gfp is detected, suggesting that bmp signalling must be active for transdifferentiation to occur . the process of heat shocking itself did not adversely affect the regenerative potential of wild type sibling eyes or those carrying a γ-cry-rfp transgene .

we have previously shown that each daily heat shock generates a burst of noggin expression that is detectable for a day or two, but declines <cit> . heat shocks were applied at different times during post lentectomy recovery . heat shock at - <dig>  + <dig> and + <dig> hours, relative to surgical removal of the lens, resulted in only 9% of eyes regenerating detectable gfp positive lens cells , compared to non heat shocked transgenics of which 60% regenerated lens cells . this difference was found to be highly significant by chi squared analysis . tadpoles heat shocked twice, at either  <dig> and  <dig> hours or  <dig> and  <dig> hours, regenerated lens in 35%  and 33%  of cases respectively, and chi squared analysis compared to unheatshocked controls showed that this was close to significant . heat shock of tadpoles at - <dig> and  <dig> hours resulted in 50% regeneration , suggesting that bmp signalling needs to be sustained to inhibit lens regeneration fully. to investigate this further, we sectioned lentectomised eyes one, three, five and ten days after lentectomy and compared the histology of heat shocked n <dig> tadpoles to that or similarly treated wt sibling animals. heat shocks were applied before lentectomy and for the first two days afterwards  . freeman described five distinct phases of clt in xenopus laevis based on histological analysis  <cit> . at stage  <dig> , cells of the inner layer of the outer cornea have undergone a change from squamous to cuboidal epithelium. in both n <dig> and wt eyes one day after lentectomy, corresponding to stage  <dig>  the vitreous appeared collapsed and the cornea very thickened , with no obvious differences between the transgenic and wt eyes. cuboidal cells were consistently visible in both cases , suggesting that this initial stage of clt does not depend on bmp signalling. indeed, freeman observed that this stage occurs on wounding of the cornea even if the lens is not subsequently removed  <cit> . we observed a slightly thicker eosin stained extracellular matrix in some, but not all, n <dig> samples. in later stages, though, a clear difference in the histology of the wt and n <dig> eyes was observed. in n <dig> tadpoles, in which bmp signalling is attenuated, the cells of the thickened cornea appear to become hypertrophic . by ten days the cornea has thinned to its original state, with the cells once again appearing squamous, and the vitreous has partially reinflated despite the lack of a lens . of  <dig> ten day samples sectioned, one showed regeneration of a small lentoid.

in wt eyes fixed three days post lentectomy, in 5/ <dig> samples, the transdifferenting cornea had reached early freeman stage  <dig>  and a cluster of aggregated cells is beginning to invade the vitreous . a further 2/ <dig> had reached mid to late freeman stage  <dig> and no clt was observed in the remaining  <dig> samples. at this stage the connection to the cornea is very clear. by five days, the aggregate has detached from the cornea and become a lens vesicle and primary lens fibres have begun to form . by ten days, primary and secondary lens fibres have formed and the lens appears essentially complete . the cornea has returned to its original state and is once more composed of squamous epithelial cells.

microarray analysis of clt i: pattern matching based on crystallin expression 
microarray samples were prepared as shown in figure 3a. nine affymetrix xenopus laevis genechips were probed with triplicate biological replicates prepared either from stage  <dig> lens , corneas undergoing clt   and sham operated corneas undergoing healing . the normalised data were first sorted by performing pattern matching using tigr-mev with the instruction that r  is greater than any of the three s replicates. thus, the average intensity for a particular probeset from three biological replicate samples of clt tissue should be statistically higher than for any of the sham operated controls, in which wound healing but not clt is occurring. at the top of this list were several probesets representing members of the crystallin  family of structural lens proteins. however, between biological replicates, there was a pattern among the crystallins in the clt replicates whereby r <dig> and r <dig> were consistently seen to have higher expression than r <dig>  we took this to be an indication that, in the pool of corneas that made up the r <dig> sample, clt was either lagging behind or occurring in fewer of the corneas. we made an assumption that other genes being specifically switched on during clt might follow the same pattern, and so we selected  <dig> probesets representing seven different unigene sets of crystallins, and averaged the intensities for each sample . these average intensities were then used with tigr-mev pattern matching software to search for similar patterns across the  <dig> samples.  <dig> statistically significant  matches were obtained . the top  <dig> ranked matches were manually annotated and are shown in the heat map in figure 3c. the full cry list can be found in additional file  <dig> .

crystallins used in the pattern match are shown in figure 3b. three further crystallin genes, cryba <dig>  cryaa and a gene most similar to crybb <dig>  were detected by the match. prox <dig>  a known eye development gene, was also captured. the wnt family member wnt7a appeared twice  in the top  <dig>  along with the wnt receptor frz <dig>  which occurred a total of four times in the cry list. seven of the top  <dig> ranked genes could not be assigned to a protein family and are annotated as transcribed. interestingly, two homologues of a cug triplet repeat rna binding protein, cugbp <dig>  were also ranked highly in the match. these proteins, also known as eden-bp, are members of the bruno family and are involved in degradation of mrna through binding to instability sites  <cit> .

to obtain an unbiased overall view of the selected crystallin pattern matched data,  <dig> genes with a high probability match  were used to examine gene ontology. these formed the slightly shorter cry* list. tc numbers, with duplicates removed, were used to match probesets to specific go biological function categories. table  <dig> shows the go categories that were statistically over represented in the cry* dataset. genes associated with nuclear migration, microtubule polymerisation, development, wnt/planar cell polarity  signalling, eye development and visual perception were among the most over represented ontologies. the two genes in "eye development " correspond to the lens intrinsic membrane protein lim <dig> and a possible homologue, lim <dig>  lim <dig> encodes a lens specific protein probably involved in cell junctions, and mutations in humans are associated with congenital cataracts  <cit> . the inclusion of two categories involved with wnt/pcp signalling, "r3/r <dig> cell fate commitment" and "establishment of wing hair orientation" ontologies seems to be entirely due to one gene, frz <dig>  which has two tc numbers, and a total of  <dig> hits in the list. however, the "frizzled signalling pathway" ontology was also significantly overrepresented , creating a strong case for the involvement of wnt signalling in directing the lens fate. genes in this category included, as well as frz <dig>  a second receptor gene, frz <dig> , the ligand wnt5b transcription factors pitx <dig> and tcf <dig>  and the signalling components axin <dig> and the alpha subunit of ck <dig> 

tc numbers are tentative consensus numbers and each one represents a group of ests for one gene, as well as providing a way to link to gene ontology. total tc therefore shows the number of genes on the xenopus genechip which are linked to a particular ontology, and subset tc shows how many of these were found in the cry* list

several genes were validated using quantitative real time pcr , as shown in table  <dig>  after normalisation to the housekeeping gene odc, 11/ <dig> genes were confirmed as being expressed at higher levels in lens than in either corneas undergoing clt or sham operated corneas. of these, six were confirmed expressed at higher levels in corneas undergoing clt vs. sham operated corneas: five crystallins and fzd <dig>  two of the remaining genes  were found to be downregulated by q-rtpcr and unchanged in the array, glb <dig> was unchanged in either analysis, and cryaa was found to be upregulated by q-rtpcr but not on the array. the rna binding protein cugbp1b was not significantly up regulated by q-rtpcr although expression was confirmed as being higher in clt samples.

bold numbers indicate upregulation of more than  <dig>  fold, numbers in italics indicate down regulation and normal font indicates no significant change. * appears twice in cry list. l/s shows the relative  expression in lens when compared to sham operated corneas. likewise r/s shows relative expression in corneas undergoing clt when compared to sham operated control corneas.

seven genes from the cry list were then cloned and used to determine developmental expression patterns using in situ hybridisation . cryaa was expressed in central cells of the developing lens from stage  <dig>  corresponding to the primary lens fibres. cryba <dig> was expressed much earlier in lens development, and was first seen in punctate pattern across the whole lens placode at stage  <dig> . expression appeared to be in all lens cells at stage  <dig>  and this was maintained at stage  <dig> . crygb was first detected in the hindbrain in a single stripe at stage  <dig> . this expression was transient and was superceded by expression in the central two thirds of the lens cells by stage  <dig> . this expression was maintained at stage  <dig> . cugbp1b expression was first seen at stage  <dig>  specifically in lens cells . by stage  <dig>  expression had cleared from the central, cryaa expressing cells, but was maintained in peripheral lens cells corresponding to the secondary lens fibres . tsr <dig> transcripts were detected in epithelial cells and were not specific to the eye . two previously described eye genes also found in the cry list, prox <dig> and sox <dig>  were included here for comparison. prox <dig> transcripts were seen specifically in lens cells at stage  <dig> as previously described  <cit> . sox <dig>  expression was seen in optic cup and lens as well as in the forming lateral line, branchial arches and neural tube   <cit> .

microarray analysis of clt ii: identification of regeneration associated genes 
a second pattern match was devised to capture potential regeneration associated genes that were not highly expressed in lens . the parameters for this were set as low expression in lens, high in samples undergoing clt  and low in sham operated controls .  <dig> probesets passed this filter with a cut-off p value of <  <dig>  and the complete rag list can be found in additional file  <dig>  the top  <dig> ranked genes were re-annotated manually and their expression profile is shown in figure  <dig>  sixteen of the  <dig> genes could not be annotated and are listed as transcribed. the top ranking gene dbaf <dig> encodes the xenopus mhc class ii α chain, which could suggest a sustained immune response in clt. of particular interest is the third ranking gene, tcf <dig>  also known as tcf <dig> in xenopus. tcf <dig> is a hmg-box transcription factor that represses target gene expression in the absence of wnt signalling  <cit> .

also included in the rag list were the matrix metalloproteinases mmp <dig> and mmp <dig>  transcription factors pitx <dig>  pitx2a, six <dig>  pax <dig>  and the signalling proteins fgf8b and wnt <dig>  which both appear twice. tcf <dig>  which encodes a bhlh transcription factor unrelated to wnt signalling, appears three times on the list and a closely related gene that we have annotated as tcf4b  appears twice.

gene ontology of  <dig> unique tc numbers corresponding to high probability hits  from the rag list was analysed . statistically over-represented gene ontologies are shown in table  <dig>  strikingly, the most significantly over-represented ontology group was the wnt receptor signalling pathway. eight from a possible  <dig> genes assigned to this group were present in the rag* list. these genes included three members of the pitx family of transcription factors, pitx <dig>  pitx <dig> and pitx2a as well as wnt pathway components dvl <dig> and lrp <dig>  each of which is present twice in the rag list. also included in this group were the genes encoding the ligand wnt <dig>  the hmg group transcription factor tcf7l <dig>  and btrc, an f-box/wd- <dig> protein associated with ubiquitination. the ontology analysis is not exhaustive: wnt <dig> and wnt <dig> were also present in the rag list but had not been assigned a tc number, and were therefore not picked up by the ontology screen. as well as wnt signalling, two other gene ontology terms, "patterning of blood vessels" and "chromatin assembly or disassembly" were also highly significantly over-represented . the gene ontology term "patterning of blood vessels" scored highly because of inclusion of the pitx genes  <dig>   <dig> and 2a, which are also involved in this process. the genes in this category "chromatin assembly or disassembly" that were present in the analysis were unkempt <dig>  histone  <dig> ab and 2a, smarcc <dig>  mta <dig>  hsp90ab <dig> and cbx <dig> 

validation was performed for  <dig> genes with  <dig> confirmed as statistically increased in clt and two more showing the same trend as the array . five genes were examined for expression in developing lens. although none of these were found to be entirely lens specific at tailbud stages, the bmp target gene nipsnap <dig> was expressed only in the lens at stage  <dig>  with expression in branchial arches, otic vesicle and pronephros appearing around stage  <dig> . taf1b was expressed in the lens, branchial arches and otic vesicle from stage  <dig> . the wnt target gene and pathway-specific transcription factor tcf <dig> was also expressed in developing lens at stage  <dig> but was also seen in the choroid fissure of the eye cup, midbrain hindbrain boundary, otic vesicle, cement gland and pronephritic duct at stage  <dig> . pdik1l expression was restricted to the developing eye  and branchial arches, beginning at stage  <dig>   and the wnt pathway gene dvl <dig> was expressed almost ubiquitously .

bold numbers indicate upregulation of more than  <dig>  fold, numbers in italics indicate down regulation and normal font indicates no significant change. l/s shows the relative  expression in lens when compared to sham operated corneas. likewise r/s shows relative expression in corneas undergoing clt when compared to sham operated control corneas.

pluripotency genes are not upregulated in  <dig> day corneas undergoing clt
thirteen genes associated with pluripotency were present on the genechip array. these included klf <dig> , c-myc, sox <dig>  and four pou genes, oct <dig>  oct <dig>  oct <dig> and oct <dig>  which seem, in xenopus, to substitute for the pluripotency gene oct3/ <dig> of mammals  <cit> , dppa2/ <dig>  gdf <dig>  fut <dig> , lin <dig>  tert and zic <dig>  however, with the exception of sox <dig>  none of these were captured in our screen . sox <dig> was expressed at highest levels in the lens samples  but was not significantly elevated in corneas undergoing clt when compared to the same controls. sox <dig> then may be involved in lens differentiation but does not seem to be indicative of dedifferentiation in this case. another pluripotency associated gene, fut <dig>  was significantly upregulated in sham operated corneas when compared to corneas undergoing clt , with no expression in lens. since we only observed one time point, it is possible that we have missed a change in pluripotency gene expression. further analysis of earlier and later stages of clt will be needed to exclude this possibility.

discussion
bmp signalling is essential for clt
bmp signalling has not been previously linked to transdifferentiation of the cornea into lens. however, faber et al demonstrated that bmp signalling is required for mammalian primary lens cell differentiation both in vivo and in vitro  <cit> . furthermore, bmp <dig> is essential for lens development in mice and acts upstream of the transcription factor and early lens placode marker sox <dig>  <cit> , which in turn directly regulates crystallins  <cit> . finally, bmp <dig> is also expressed in the developing lens and regulates expression of pax <dig>  which also regulates crystallins  <cit> .

we have previously used the transgenic line n <dig>  in which noggin overexpression is controlled by the inducible hsp <dig> heat shock promoter, to demonstrate a requirement for functional bmp signalling in limb and tail regeneration in xenopus laevis  <cit> . both tail and limb regeneration involve epimorphic type regeneration, the regrowth of a patterned organ comprised of multiple tissues. here, we use the same line to show that a distinct type of regenerative process, that of transdifferentiation of cornea to lens, also depends on active bmp signalling. noggin overexpression, which blocks bmp signalling, appeared to have no effect on the early corneal thickening and cell shape changes associated with wound healing. however, prolonged inhibition of bmp signalling prevented the subsequent progression of cells to transdifferentiating aggregates that eventually form the new lens. instead, the extra cells seem to become hypertrophic and die. cellular hypertrophy was also observed in the aec of poorly regenerating xenopus limb buds  <cit> , suggesting that bmp may be a survival signal for cells during regeneration.

in support of this, we have shown that increased expression of nipsnap <dig>  a known direct bmp target gene  <cit> , is associated with clt. the expression of nipsnap <dig> in developing lens suggests that it may act downstream of bmps in specifying the lens fate. in another study of xenopus clt, malloch et al detected transcripts from a gene annotated as similar to bmp <dig>  <cit> . clt in xenopus differs from the better studied wolffian regeneration of the lens in newts, which takes place via dedifferentiation of the pigmented epithelial cells  of the dorsal iris rather than transdifferentiation from the more closely related cornea  <cit> . despite this difference, similar signals may be involved in the process. in a recent study, a large number of ests were generated from cynops pyrrhogaster dorsal iris pecs undergoing dedifferentiation after lentectomy  <cit> . in this dataset, crystallins were not identified, suggesting that the dedifferentiated pecs had not yet begun to transdifferentiate into lens cells. maki and colleagues detected multiple members of the bmp and tgfβ growth factor pathways but report that components of the wnt, fgf and hedgehog signalling pathways were not detected. in newts, however, bmp inhibition leads to enhanced regeneration, in conflict with our observations in xenopus. functional evidence showed that inhibition of bmp induces formation of a lens from the ventral iris, which does not normally regenerate  <cit> . this difference in the role of bmp may reflect inherent differences between wolffian regeneration in newts and clt in xenopus, possibly due to the requirement for dedifferentiation in the newt.

wnt signalling pathway components are upregulated during lens regeneration
wnt/β-catenin signalling  is known to be important in driving lens cell differentiation in mammals, with several wnt ligands, along with their receptors  and the lrp5/ <dig> co-receptors expressed during development of the lens  <cit> . reporter strains in mice have shown a period of tcf/lef activity in the lens epithelium as it develops  <cit> , and it is thought that canonical wnt signalling is required for initial formation of the lens epithelium. in contrast, the wnt/pcp pathway is thought to play a role in the later lens fibre differentiation from the lens epithelium  <cit> . regulation of wnt signalling via inhibition by secreted frizzled related proteins  also occurs in mammalian lens development  <cit> . sfrp <dig> expression under a lens specific crystallin promotor in mice led to cataract formation  <cit> .

here, we present evidence that the developmental role of canonical wnt signalling in mammalian anterior eye formation is recapitulated in lens regeneration from the cornea in xenopus. gene ontology analysis of our rag list demonstrated that regeneration of the lens in xenopus is accompanied by significantly increased expression of several components of the wnt signalling pathway. although the gene ontology for the cry list suggested involvement of wnt/pcp pathway, this result is entirely due to the expression of a single wnt receptor, frz <dig>  and there is therefore insufficient evidence to implicate wnt/pcp rather than canonical wnt signalling, in clt. the antagonist sfrp <dig> was also recovered from the cry list and was expressed at  <dig>  fold higher levels in regenerating clt corneas than in sham operated controls.

wnt signalling components were also recovered from an est collection generated from tissue undergoing the early stages of clt. wnt7b and two genes related to the wnt modulator sfrp <dig> were identified by malloch and colleagues  <cit> . furthermore, wolffian regeneration of the newt lens, while occurring from the neural crest derived pigmented epithelial cells of the dorsal iris rather than the cornea, may well employ some of the same mechanisms . experiments have demonstrated that if wnt is made available, the ventral iris can also regenerate a lens  <cit> .

pitx genes, which may be wnt targets, are upregulated during lens regeneration
three members of the bicoid related homeobox transcription factor pitx were captured in the rag list: pitx <dig>  pitx2a and pitx <dig>  a fourth, pitx <dig>  was captured in the cry list and was expressed in lens tissue as well as  <dig>  × higher in corneas undergoing clt than in control corneas. pitx factors have not previously been implicated in vertebrate regeneration although a recent report identified a role in asexual reproduction/regeneration of the ascidian botryllus schlosseri  <cit> . mutations in pitx genes in humans are known to cause eye developmental defects, particularly affecting the anterior eye structures: cornea, iris and lens. pitx <dig> mutations cause axenfeld-rieger syndrome type  <dig>  a congenital malformation syndrome affecting the anterior eye  <cit>  iridogoniodysgenesis type  <dig>   <cit> , peters' anomaly   <cit>  and ring dermoid of the cornea  <cit> . mutations in the related gene pitx <dig> are known to cause congenital cataracts  <cit> . pitx <dig> is induced by the canonical wnt signalling pathway directly via lef <dig>  <cit> . pitx genes may therefore act downstream of wnt signalling in lens regeneration in xenopus.

lens crystallins are markers of differentiation and are expressed during clt
eleven probesets representing seven unigenes belonging to the lens crystallin family were used to search for genes with similar patterns of expression across the nine datasets. searching our microarray data for similarly expressed genes uncovered three more crystallins: cryaa, cryba <dig> and crybb <dig> . of these, only cryba <dig> showed a significantly higher expression in corneas undergoing clt than in sham-operated corneas, i.e. a regenerative response. the expression of three selected crystallin genes was observed at different times during the process of embryonic lens formation . the α-crystallin cryaa was expressed late, between lens stage  <dig> and  <dig> according to mcdevitt and brahma  <cit> . the β-crystallin cryba <dig> was the earliest of the three to be expressed in the lens placode, beginning at lens stage 1- <dig> and the γ-crystallin crygb was expressed slightly later at lens stage 3- <dig>  this pattern of developmental expression is somewhat reflected in the corneas undergoing clt, with α-crystallins unchanged between regenerating and sham operated corneas and all identified β and γ-crystallins on the array being upregulated during clt. therefore we believe we have captured corneas in the act of transdifferentiating, just as the first crystallins become expressed. furthermore, we observe a correlation in timing of α, β and γ-crystallin expression that reflects that seen during lens development. however, others have reported that the timing of crystallin expression differs between regeneration and development  <cit> .

genes associated with congenital cataract formation have similar expression profiles to crystallins in our microarray data
formation of congenital cataract often results from mutation of genes involved in the formation of the anterior eye, which includes the lens. many cases of congenital cataract result from mutations in the crystallin genes discussed above. our search for regeneration specific gene upregulation revealed changes in several other genes known to be involved the formation of congenital cataracts. one such gene, pitx <dig>  is discussed earlier. the b-zip transcription factor l-maf ranks 31st in the cry list, and is 2-fold upregulated in corneas undergoing clt relative to sham operated controls . l-maf is expressed in the lens placode and later in fibre cells in xenopus, and directly activates the expression of several lens crystallins  <cit> . mutations in a human homologue of this gene cause a type of congenital cataract called cca <dig>   <cit> .

lens intrinsic membrane protein  <dig>  is ranked 17th on the cry list and a potential homologue, lim <dig> similar, is ranked 13th. lim <dig>  but not its homolgue, was upregulated in clt. lim <dig> protein is very abundant in the human lens, and mutations in lim <dig>  also known as mp <dig>  are associated with congenital or early onset cataract  <cit> . the forkhead transcription factor lens <dig>  was ranked 218th in the cry list and expression was  <dig>  fold higher in clt corneas than in sham operated controls. foxe <dig> is associated with ocular dysgenesis and cataracts in humans  <cit> .

cugbp <dig> is an rna binding protein targeting cug repeats. xenopus laevis appears to have two homolgues of this gene, cugbp1b was ranked 8th in the cry list and expression was  <dig>  fold higher in clt corneas relative to controls, and cugbp1a was ranked 14th with a  <dig>  fold higher relative expression. while cugbp <dig> is not directly linked to the formation of cataracts, expansion of ctg repeats in the 3'utr of the human dmpk gene cause myotonic dystrophy, a form of adult muscular dystrophy that is accompanied by cataract formation  <cit> . here, we have shown that cugbp1b is expressed specifically in the forming lens and is upregulated during clt, suggesting it could be involved in the pathology of myotonic dystrophy. however, the cugbp <dig> duplication appears to be unique to xenopus laevis and an eye developmental role has not yet been described for these cug binding proteins in other vertebrates.

genes associated with pluripotency are not upregulated in three day clt tissue but chromatin modification may occur
recent transcriptome analysis of wolffian regeneration of the newt lens identified several genes associated with reprogramming, such as histone deacetylases and the oncogene c-myc, highly suggestive of dedifferentiation  <cit> . furthermore, expression of a subset of pluripotency associated genes  was found to be increased during newt lens and limb regeneration  <cit> . in contrast, recent evidence has shown that pluripotency genes were not up regulated during zebrafish fin regeneration, although reduction of either oct <dig> or sox <dig> activity prevented fins from regenerating  <cit> . our microarray data, while limited to only one stage of the process, suggests that clt occurs without dedifferentiation in xenopus. thirteen genes associated with pluripotency were present on the genechip array. however, with the exception of sox <dig>  none of these were up regulated during clt . sox <dig> was expressed at highest levels in the lens samples but was not significantly elevated in corneas undergoing clt compared to sham operated corneas. sox <dig> then may be involved in lens differentiation but does not seem to be indicative of dedifferentiation in this case. similarly, sox <dig> expression was found in limbs and tails before amputation  <cit> . another pluripotency associated gene, fut <dig>  was significantly upregulated in sham operated corneas when compared to corneas undergoing clt , with no expression in lens. christen et al recently showed the same result in xenopus limb blastema vs. pseudoblastema, with what they call fut <dig>  being upregulated regardless of regenerative success  <cit> . while limited to a single timepoint in the regenerative process, our results show no evidence for pluripotency gene up regulation during clt and we therefore suggest that returning to a pluripotent state is not part of the clt process, unlike the lens regeneration from newt pecs. we do note, however, that genes associated with chromatin assembly and disassembly were statistically overrepresented in the rag list, suggesting that epigenetic changes may be taking place during clt.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown a functional role for bmp signalling in the process of lens regeneration from the cornea  in xenopus laevis tapoles, and identified a new role for nipsnap <dig>  a of bmp signalling, in the process of lens development. furthermore, we present strong evidence for the involvement of wnt signalling and pitx transcription factors in clt. our microarray analysis has identified many genes that are involved in lens pathology, in particular the development of congenital cataract. finally, we have shown that although there may be alterations to chromatin, there is no evidence for a return to pluripotency, or dedifferentiation, seen in  <dig> day corneas undergoing clt.
