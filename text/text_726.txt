BACKGROUND
extracellular nucleotides partake to excitatory neurotransmission and neuromodulation in the cns and are capable of intervening in a broad array of physiopathological functions acting on different p <dig> purinergic receptors  <cit> . because of their heterogeneous faculty of responding to several diverse nucleotides, interest is growing on discovering the exact localization of the various p <dig> receptor subunits in selected organs, tissues and cellular phenotypes  <cit> . to date, seven different ionotropic p2x   <cit>  and eight distinct metabotropic p2y   <cit>  receptors were cloned from mammalian species. in contrast to p2x ion channels, p2y proteins hold the general feature of g protein-coupled receptors with seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains. since activation of p2y subtypes leads to second messenger cascades, their response is slower than that mediated by p2x subunits  <cit> . among p2y receptors, an elevated expression particularly of the p2y <dig> subtype was detected in both human  <cit>  and rat brain  <cit> . in human tissue, expression of p2y <dig> protein is reported exclusively on neuronal cells in cerebral and cerebellar cortex, in hippocampus, caudate-putamen nuclei, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus and midbrain  <cit> . moreover, p2y <dig> protein appears associated to neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques in postmortem brain of alzheimer's disease patients  <cit> . on the contrary, p2y <dig> receptor in rat is detected not only on grey matter, particularly cerebellar, cortical and hippocampal neurons, but also on white matter of corpus callosum and optic nerve  <cit> .

many studies have already highlighted a general role for purinergic signaling in brain development  <cit>  and in neuron and/or glia function and communication  <cit> . for instance, activation particularly of p2y <dig> receptor is suggested to regulate oligodendrocyte progenitor functions  <cit> , whereas reduced levels of p2y <dig> protein apparently affect proliferation and migration, but not differentiation of neural progenitor cells during early cns development  <cit> . with the present work, we further study p2y <dig> receptor and compare protein distribution in juvenile versus neonatal rat cerebellum. we show that during postnatal growth, the phenotypic appearance of p2y <dig> protein undergoes a drastic switch from glial to neuronal localization, therefore suggesting this receptor as a novel marker of cerebellar development.

RESULTS
p2y <dig> receptor is present on tyrosine hydroxylase- and dopamine β-hydroxylase-positive neurons in juvenile rat cerebellum
we describe in this work the topographic cellular and subcellular in vivo distribution of p2y <dig> receptor protein in the cerebellum of juvenile rat at postnatal day  <dig> . we show by confocal microscopy that p2y <dig> protein immunoreactivity is uniformly distributed throughout specific zones of cerebellar cortex . confirming what was previously depicted by immunohistochemical observations  <cit> , our immunofluorescence studies indicate that p2y <dig> receptor is limited to purkinje cell  bodies and ramifications, to neuropil of molecular layer , and to axons of white matter irradiating into granule  and purkinje  layers . in addition, we show that specific p2y <dig> receptor staining is absent from neun-positive granule cell bodies, but present on the conspicuous array of fibers irradiating into the cerebellum and spreading out their projections to granular, purkinje and molecular layers . in sagital cerebellar sections, we see by confocal analysis that p2y <dig> receptor immunoreactivity colocalizes with thick, straight and bundled neurofilament light chain  fluorescence, specific for neuronal processes , with tyrosine hydroxylase , the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis , and with dopamine β-hydroxylase , specific for noradrenergic neurons . we find that, differently from nfl , nerve fibers immunoreactive for both th  or dβh  and p2y <dig> receptor can be much thinner , sparse, unbundled and winding and, moreover, display abundant varicosities and beaded appearance . although p2y <dig> receptor labeling is not uniformly distributed along the entire fiber, and not all dβh ramifications are p2y <dig> positive, p2y <dig> fibers are densely detected in the white matter of each cerebellar folium without distinction among lobules, sometimes in contact with perikarya . at higher magnification and by triple immunofluorescence confocal analysis, we observe that a blue calbindin-positive purkinje axon is surrounded by yellow colocalizing signals of red p2y <dig> receptor and green dβh . in this particular fiber, the p2y <dig> receptor is absent from the purkinje axon, but enriched on noradrenergic terminals on the same axon. moreover, the numerous and large varicosities  of th-positive fibers  <cit>  directly express p2y <dig> receptor  and are, therefore, likely responsible for the beaded appearance of p2y <dig> receptor immunostaining. by triple immunofluorescence and confocal analysis on histological sections, we further prove that the p2y1receptor-positive varicosities  are enriched in synaptophysin , and flotillin   <cit> , therefore providing a completely overlapping p2y1-synaptophysin-flotillin immunoreactive signal . the large oval/cuboid staining , as well as the fine punctate staining, further demonstrate the presence of synaptophysin and p2y <dig> receptor labeling on synaptic glomeruli.

on the other hand, p2y <dig> receptor does not colocalize with glial fibrillary acidic protein , therefore excluding its concurrent expression on astrocytes .

ultrastructural analysis indicates that p2y <dig> receptor is present on both axon terminals and dendrites
to further investigate the subcellular localization of p2y <dig> protein, we performed ultrastructural analysis by electron microscopy. we confirm the presence of p2y <dig> receptor immunoreactive profiles in all cortical layers of juvenile rat cerebellar cortex, although more abundantly in gl , rather than pl or ml . p2y <dig> receptor immunoreactivity is moreover present on both dendrites  and fine, beaded axons  that travel along the cerebellar cortical layers. p2y <dig> immunoreactive axons are un-myelinated and consist of p2y1-positive small axonal enlargements or varicosities  connected by narrower p2y1-positive inter-varicose segments . the varicosities are about 1– <dig> μm in diameter and filled with synaptic pleomorphic vesicles and mitochondria . intervaricose segments do not contain vesicles. the most remarkable feature of the electron microscopy analysis is the absence of visible synaptic specializations . the p2y <dig> receptor-positive varicosities are in fact adjacent to cerebellar elements like granule dendrites  and cell bodies , without formation of conventional synaptic junctions . in addition, specific immunolabelling is observed also in proximal dendrites of purkinje neurons , and very rarely in cell bodies of granule cells . no p2y <dig> receptor-immunolabelled glial cells are observed.

p2y <dig> receptor localizes in lipid rafts and synaptosomes
since fluorescence microscopy indicated a high degree of co-localization between p2y <dig> receptor and the lipid rafts marker flotillin- <dig>  we purified low buoyant density detergent-resistant membranes  from p <dig> rat cerebellum, in order to better dissect the localization of p2y <dig> protein. whereas in total cerebellar extracts the p2y <dig> receptor is recognized as a major protein band of approximately  <dig> kda and a minor band of about  <dig> kda  , the specific form recognized in the absence of the antigenic peptide by the p2y <dig> receptor antiserum in the low density fractions of the sucrose gradient  corresponds not to the monomeric, but to the oligomeric protein . this is not surprising, since sds-resistant oligomeric forms of this receptor are frequently reported, for instance in vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells, and suggested to be the functional forms  <cit> . consistently, when the receptor antiserum used to identify p2y <dig> protein is pre-incubated with the immunizing peptide, the reactivity not only to the monomeric, but also to the oligomeric band is completely abolished , therefore confirming the specificity of the antigen-antiserum interactions. this is further proved by the result that the p2y <dig> receptor polyclonal antiserum used in this study is able to efficiently immunoprecipitate the recombinant myc-p2y <dig> human receptor transiently transfected in sh-sy5y cells and detected by the anti-myc 9e <dig> antibody .

since fluorescence microscopy also demonstrated a high degree of co-localization between p2y <dig> receptor and synaptophysin , fractions were also prepared directly from cerebellar synaptosomes, in order to confirm the synaptic localization of lipid rafts-resident p2y <dig> receptor. our results again demonstrate that only the p2y <dig> receptor oligomer is present in synaptosomal lipid rafts-enriched fractions , together with the lipid rafts markers flotillin- <dig> and gm1ganglioside . neither monomer nor oligomer receptor is instead detected in the high density synaptosomal fractions  containing transferrin receptor, a protein known to be excluded from lipid rafts microdomains.

the phenotypic expression of p2y <dig> receptor switches during cerebellar development
we next investigated the expression of p2y <dig> receptor at postnatal day  <dig> , when the maturation of synapses is just taking place between granule neuron dendrites and fiber terminals  <cit> , and the internal granular layer  rapidly expands beneath the monocellular sheet of pc. with the only exception of calbindin-positive pc , we find that p2y <dig> receptor localization is completely different from that observed at p <dig> . at p <dig>  p2y <dig> receptor immunoreactivity is indeed absent from noradrenergic fibers of white matter, but predominantly shown: a) on fibers irradiating the thin ml  and the external granule  layers  ; b) on cell bodies aligned at the interface between the pc and ml ; c) on isolated cells located in the igl . p2y <dig> receptor immunostaining is thus totally absent from nfl-positive  and th- or dβh-positive fibers , which already span into the gl at this age of development. by means of distinctive morphology of cerebellar astrocytes and positive colocalization between p2y <dig> receptor and gfap , at p <dig> we do identify p2y <dig> receptor on both bergmann cell bodies/fibers and astroglial cells scattered among granule neurons. this is confirmed for postnatal day one , but is the opposite of what was shown at p <dig>  when p2y <dig> receptor is totally absent from gfap-positive structures  and present only on neuronal fibers . conversely, the enrichment of p2y <dig> receptor in lipid rafts, but not synaptosomal fractions, is confirmed also at p <dig> , therefore appearing as a conserved feature of this receptor.

it's well known that, during development, bergmann fibers are associated with migrating granule cells, from which is derived the concept of glia-guided neuronal migration  <cit> , and that dcx is a distinctive marker of granule cells only during the period of radial descent into the deep cerebellar layers, when it directs neuronal movement through the organization and stability of microtubules  <cit> . therefore, we used dcx immunoreactivity to observe the potential relationship between bergmann glia  and granule neurons. we find that at p <dig>  the dcx-positive signal appears as a diffuse labeling on both the entire igl and the thin ml enriched in radially migrating granule cells, but is excluded by the pre-migratory p2y1-expressing egl . given the high density, amoeboid shape and lack of defined neuronal contour of migrating granule cells at this neonatal age, the dcx-positive staining appears contiguous to p2y1-gfap fibers , providing an almost overlapping signal when observed at low magnification . nevertheless, at higher resolution it is possible to distinguish that dcx-positive granule cells are wrapped up and stretched along p2y1-gfap-positive bergmann fibers . on the opposite, when at p <dig> the egl almost disappears after complete proliferation and migration of granule neurons  <cit> , the dcx immunostaining is confined to a very narrow zone below the pc  and p2y <dig> receptor is no longer detected on bergmann glia .

discussion
the main goal of our study was to characterize the cellular and subcellular distribution and features of the purinergic metabotropic p2y <dig> receptor in the cerebellum, and to gain insights on its potential function during development of the cerebellar circuitry. to this purpose, we analyzed p2y <dig> receptor expression at p <dig>  when the major structural changes already took place in the developing cerebellum, and compared it with expression at p <dig>  when migration of granule neurons from the molecular to the granular layer is still occurring  <cit> , and when the neuronal bodies in the locus coeruleus of origin for the dorsal bundle of noradrenergic neurons innervating the cerebellum are spreading out their projections to the granular, purkinje and molecular layers  <cit> . in juvenile rat cerebellum we find that, in addition to purkinje cell bodies and ramifications  <cit> , p2y <dig> receptor is abundant on neuronal specializations identified as noradrenergic by anatomical , ultrastructural  and biochemical features   <cit> . moreover, we observe that p2y <dig> receptor is preferentially localized on synaptic varicosities of the noradrenergic fibers and synaptic glomeruli, which can be recognized by the presence of synaptophysin. the ultrastructural analysis confirms the localization of p2y <dig> receptor on varicosities of axon terminals, moreover showing features indicative of a particular modality of transmitter release. as generally reported for noradrenergic fibers  <cit> , the absence of conventional synaptic junctions led us to suppose that in the cerebellum also extracellular nucleotides might exert their modulatory action through paracrine release or simple diffusion in the extracellular space. this modality has the advantage to extend the potential effects of extracellular nucleotides, and neurotransmitters in general, to structures equipped with adequate receptors   <cit> , but distant from the source of release   <cit> . the enrichment in these p2y1-positive varicosities of both synaptophysin and the lipid rafts marker flotillin- <dig>  furthermore suggests that the role of p2y <dig> receptor is likely mediated by lipid microdomains. in this regard, it is already well-known that lipid rafts display a key part in the targeting and functional organization of proteins at both synapses and spines  <cit> .

since a further specification of the central noradrenergic system consists in the frequency of co-transmission phenomena, the presence in the cerebellum of p2y <dig> receptor on noradrenergic neurons in addition to purkinje cells might signify that extracellular nucleotides such as the natural agonists atp and adp could contribute in this brain region to the physiological role of noradrenaline  <cit> . in this regard, atp is already well known to be co-released with noradrenaline in various pns and cns neurons  <cit> . thus, if co-release and synergism occur at cerebellar synapses as well, nucleotide-dependent increase of cerebellar noradrenergic signaling could be achieved. homologous recombination techniques have shown that complete removal of either the enzymes responsible for noradrenaline metabolism or the vesicular monoamine transporter has deleterious consequences for foetal survival  <cit> . moreover, blockade of postsynaptic noradrenergic receptors decreases the rate of learning in several cerebellar-dependent motor tasks  <cit> . the possibility of integrating and complementing noradrenergic with purinergic mechanisms to increase the strength of synaptic connections through activation of both noradrenergic and p2y <dig> receptors might therefore constitute also a novel powerful approach against neuronal degeneration and/or malfunctioning in the cerebellum.

the presence of p2y <dig> receptor in postnatal rat cerebellum was then analyzed before the formation of noradrenergic synaptic connections takes place. surprisingly, we have shown here that p2y <dig> undergoes a drastic switch during development, with a phenotypic expression resembling that of bergmann glia at p <dig>  rather then noradrenergic neurons at p <dig>  in this regard, it is well established that a number of neuronal and glial receptor systems and/or diffusible factors act to induce and maintain bergmann glia process extension at an early stage of postnatal development  <cit> , when bergmann cells specialize in supporting the migration of granule neurons and migration of granule cells seems to be largely dependent on their interaction with glial processes  <cit> . in particular, the erbb <dig> tyrosine kinase receptor present on bergmann glia appears to have a distinct role in this process  <cit> , interacting with neoregulin expressed on migrating granule cells  <cit> . on the other hand, in vitro studies on the migration of granule neurons demonstrated that the glycoprotein astrotactin provides a neuronal receptor system for migration along glial processes  <cit> . thus, p2y <dig> receptor expression only on bergmann glia at an early stage of development might sustain a role for purinergic receptors in signaling events needed for interaction and migration of neurons. this is strongly supported by the result that adp, preferential ligand for p2y1receptor, induces ca2+ mobilization in bergman glia  <cit> . the factors produced by granule neurons to induce the glial scaffold might thus comprise the purinergic ligands atp and adp directly targeting p2y <dig> receptors. to support this hypothesis, we have both shown here that p2y <dig> receptor is localized at the interface between bergmann glia and dcx-positive migrating granule cells, and previously demonstrated that, at least in vitro, granule neurons can release atp, which is easily degraded to adp in the extracellular environment  <cit> . it is finally well known that, once migration across the glia scaffold is completed and cells change their repertoire of adhesive molecules and switch into a static asset: a) the bergmann glia loses the apposition with granule neurons; b) the granule cells are locked in position by the formation of new specific axon-target interactions  <cit> . in parallel, we have demonstrated here that in juvenile rat cerebellum: a) the bergmann glia lose p2y <dig> receptors; b) p2y <dig> receptors appear on purkinje and noradrenergic neurons forming new specific axon-target interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
since membrane components of the cell surface are largely known to mediate the close apposition between two cells during all phases of development, our results suggest a novel role for p2y <dig> receptor in the cns, specifically in cell junction/communication. this already occurs on platelets, where p2y <dig> receptor is well known to mediate cell contact and aggregation  <cit> . considering the glia-neuron switch of p2y <dig> receptor a novel biological mechanism of development, aim of further studies will be to investigate the potential impact of this receptor on bergman glia-guided migration of granule neurons; on alteration/reorganization of noradrenergic fibers in the cerebellar cortex in response to the degeneration of their major target, granule and purkinje neurons; and finally to investigate if the presence of purinergic ligands in the environment surrounding noradrenergic fibers can influence their anatomical integrity and development.
