BACKGROUND
equine herpesvirus  <dig>  is a slowly growing, cell-associated gamma-herpesvirus. this virus is widespread throughout the equine population and has been isolated from horses of different countries like united kingdom  <cit> , japan  <cit> , australia  <cit> , new zealand  <cit> , switzerland  <cit> , germany  <cit> , united states  <cit> , canada  <cit> , hungary  <cit>  and more recently, from poland  <cit> . although its role as a pathogen is controversial, some authors have reported its association with upper respiratory tract disease, inappetance, lymphadenopathy, immunosuppression, keratoconjunctivitis, general malaise and poor performance  <cit> .

equine influenza virus and equine herpesvirus  <dig>  are the most common viral agents related to respiratory disease in argentina . these and other respiratory viruses as adenovirus, equine herpesvirus  <dig> , arteritis virus and rhinovirus, are usually checked in the diagnostic routine of our laboratory but no records about ehv- <dig> isolation or frequency of sero-positive samples were available.

the purpose of the present study was to analyse the presence of ehv- <dig> in an argentinean horse population and to correlate its incidence with age and presence of respiratory symptoms.

RESULTS
sero-prevalence of ehv- <dig> was calculated on one hundred and fifty-three  thoroughbred racing horses by a neutralization test . cross reactivity with ehv- <dig> was not checked in this study. the percentage of sero-prevalence to ehv- <dig> was  <dig> % . sera samples were grouped according to the clinical status into animals with symptoms  or clinically healthy. again, each of these groups was divided according to the animal age in older or younger than  <dig> year old. the arithmetical mean of the antibody titres was calculated for each of these four groups. mean antibody titres between older and younger than  <dig> year old animals both, with and without clinical symptoms were statistically compared. mean values for the older horses  were significantly  higher than for the younger ones. these results agree with the observations of other authors  <cit>  about the increase in antibodies titre with age. within the older than 1-year group, the mean titre in the group with clinical symptoms was higher  though not significant. however, mean titre values were significantly  higher  in the group with clinical symptoms within the younger than  <dig> year group . this difference might be related to the early exposure to this agent.

our results suggest the virus is circulating with a high prevalence on the analysed equine population, in accordance with other sero-prevalence data  <cit> , and confirm previous reports  <cit>  about the acquisition of ehv- <dig> at earlier ages.

taking into account the relatively high percentage of sero-prevalence and the association of ehv- <dig> with respiratory disease  <cit> , the isolation of this viral agent from horses showing different respiratory symptomathology was carries out. twenty-two  nasal swabs from horses, aged between  <dig> months and  <dig> years old, displaying respiratory symptoms were checked for the respiratory viruses commonly analysed in the laboratory routine, and none of them resulted positive for these viruses. only two  nasal swab samples, named e <dig> and e <dig>  showed cpe after the third blind passage. some authors reported the presence of vacuoles in rk- <dig> cells infected with ehv- <dig> isolates  <cit>  while others described various cpe forms depending on the virus isolate and cell type  <cit> . in our isolate, cpe was characterized by rounded cells, syncytia and vacuolized cell aggregates with suited partial cell membrane fusion. the late development of cpe referred to a slow growing viral agent.

in order to identify these two isolates, two simple techniques like em and iifa were first used. the particle morphology observed by em showed a size corresponding to a typical herpesvirus . the iifa showed fluorescence signals on cells infected with ehv- <dig> reference strain lk, e <dig> and e <dig>  mock-infected cells were negative . as the polyclonal antiserum used for the staining could have cross reaction with ehv- <dig>  another member of the gamma-herpesvirinae subfamily that shows growth characteristics similar to ehv- <dig>  <cit> , a virus specific nested pcr and a restriction enzyme analysis  were performed.

nested pcr was carried out on e <dig> and e <dig> samples as described in methods. after the second round, both isolations showed a band of around  <dig> bp , as the one displayed by the positive control.

ehv- <dig> identity of the isolations was unequivocally excluded by rea. as shown in figure  <dig>  the patterns after digestion with hind iii and eco ri of the isolates and a control ehv- <dig> were completely different.

as it was specified by others authors  <cit> , ehv- <dig> was described as a virus with a high genomic variation. in our experiments, the restriction patterns of the isolates were different to those of t <dig> and lk <dig>  moreover, e <dig> and e <dig> resulted identical to each other and very similar to strain h <dig>  both, e <dig> and e <dig> belonged to the same stud farm and were probably epidemiologically related.

CONCLUSIONS
although ehv- <dig> has been reported in equine populations worldwide, no reports about its prevalence in argentina were available. in this study, serological data and virus isolation provided a clear evidence for the presence of this agent on the studied horse population. in horses younger than  <dig> year old but not in the older ones, serological data correlated with the presence of clinical symptoms. though viral agents associated with respiratory disease were discarded, no bacterial analysis was done in the studied samples. further studies are necessary to correlate ehv- <dig> with the respiratory disease. the ehv- <dig> identity of the isolated viruses was finally confirmed by the use of a nested pcr and a restriction enzyme assay. this is the first report of ehv- <dig> isolation in argentina and adds new data to the ehv- <dig> distribution map.
