BACKGROUND
microorganisms are able to communicate and cooperate to perform complex social behaviors once believed to be distinctive of multicellular organisms  <cit> . this includes formation of biofilms, foraging, spore dispersal and production of common goods. cooperative groups are vulnerable to exploitation by cheaters, individuals that benefit from the product of cooperation without contributing their fair share  <cit> . in pseudomonas aeruginosa <cit>  and myxococcus xanthus <cit> , for example, the release of siderophores and digestive enzymes, respectively, represent costly activities that could be exploited by non-producers. in both organisms, strains grown in liquid culture for a number of generations sometime evolve to lose the ability to cooperate and instead behave as cheaters.

dictyostelium discoideum displays cooperative behavior that provides a great model for the study of cheating. d. discoideum propagates as free-living unicellular amoebae feeding on bacteria associated with leaf litter, soil, and animal dung. in the past few decades, this social amoeba has been intensively studied because of its extraordinary development  <cit> , which is a form of cooperation. when starving, cells aggregate and eventually form a multicellular organism capable of movement towards light and heat and away from chemicals such as ammonia  <cit> . under the correct conditions, they develop into a fruiting body that represents the final stage of development  <cit> . about 20% of the cells differentiate into dead stalk cells that support the other 80%, which differentiate into viable spores. when spores are dispersed to a new source of food, they germinate to become amoebae and restart the vegetative stage of eating and dividing by binary fission. stalk cells have been described as altruistic, since their death is presumed to aid the dispersal of the spores that form the next generation  <cit> . if the population consists of cells that are genetically identical, or related, it is possible to compare these individuals to somatic cells in a multicellular organism, or to a social insect colony. but when cells are genetically different, a conflict may arise over which cells survive and which form the stalk and die. in this case, a strain that differentiates more than its proportional share of spores is called a cheater and the other is called a loser.

in several cases, reproductive competition among cells within a chimera has been reported, but the cheater strains often carry a fitness cost relative to non-cheaters even to the extent that they are incapable of sporulating efficiently on their own  <cit> . on the other hand, in d. discoideum several strains isolated from the wild are capable of cheating and of producing fruiting bodies independent of other clones  <cit> . a large number of knockout or reduced function mutations generated in the laboratory also show such facultative cheating behavior  <cit> . these mutants are capable of producing spores in pure populations, but preferentially become spores and not stalk cells when mixed with the ancestral strain.

in d. discoideum, many genes have been reported to be involved in the disruption of cooperation, but not much is known about the underlying genetic mechanisms. the analyses performed so far on cheater mutants showed that multiple mechanisms and pathways may be involved in cheating behavior, with cheater mutants showing diverse functions including gtpase regulatory activity, polyketide synthesis, nucleotide binding, and phosphoric ester hydrolase activity  <cit> . some of these pathways are involved in cell-cell communication, formation of secondary metabolites, or signal transduction. they can affect the communication pathway that regulates the proportion of spores and stalk cells  <cit> , or disrupt the ubiquitin-ligase pathway responsible for the breakdown of certain target proteins  <cit> . other mechanisms that can lead to cheating  <cit>  might be the expression of spore genes earlier than prestalk genes  <cit> ; premature entrance into development; presence of multinucleated cells that lead to more cell divisions during development; cannibalism, as is present in dictyostelium caveatum <cit> ; and production of a killer factor as reported in polysphondylium pallidum <cit> .

cheater strains in the dictyostelidae typically have a fitness cost or some deleterious pleiotropic effect that prevents the mutant from spreading, since otherwise a loss of function mutant would easily evolve. this is the case of mutants chta, dima, and csaa <cit> . in this work we characterize a mutant called chtb that can facultatively cheat when mixed with the parental strain, but does not suffer from an obvious fitness cost in the laboratory. when mixed with chtb, the parental strain produces fewer spores and expresses a lower level of the pre-spore gene cotb.

RESULTS
a mutant called chtb  was recovered at the end of a selection for mutants that preferentially produce spores rather than stalks in a mixed population  <cit> .

in the parental strain ax <dig>  the chtb transcript appears early in development and is completely absent in chtb mutant cells. this mutant produces a higher number of spores than ax <dig> in chimeras that are made with equal numbers of cells of the two strains. when it is plated clonally it shows a normal developmental phenotype, so it is not dependent on parental cells in a social stage chimera. the loss of function of the chtb gene also increases expression of cotb, a prespore marker, early in development, indicating the mechanism of action is early specialization as spore over the ancestral strain. on the other hand, parental cells reduce the expression of cotb and differentiate a lower number of spores in chimera. we tested chtb mutants to detect whether fitness costs were associated with its cheating ability. not only did we not detect any fitness cost, but we also found that the mutant presents the same sporulation efficiency and faster doubling time when grown in liquid, than ax <dig>  finally, the presence of chtb mutant cells in chimera with parental strain limits the expression of a pre-spore marker in the latter. as a consequence the parental strain is unable to produce its fair share of spores.

isolation of the chtb mutants
we isolated the chtb mutant during a selection for cheaters from a pool of  <dig>  mutants  <cit> . this pool of mutants was subjected to  <dig> rounds of growth, development, and spore germination in a mixed population so that cheaters that differentiate into spores with a higher efficiency would become enriched in the evolving population. at the end of the selection, chtb was one of the mutants that were randomly chosen to be tested for cheating properties. to confirm that chtb really increased its frequency during the selection, we used quantitative pcr  to obtain information about the abundance of the chtb allele. we extracted genomic dna from the entire population after the 1st, 10th, and 20th generations of the selection and used gene-specific primers to quantify the chtb allele. the mutant chtb increased  <dig>  fold at the 10th generation and  <dig>  fold at the 20th , thus supporting the hypothesis that this cheater increased in frequency during the selection.


the chtb gene
the mutant chtb was generated by insertional mutation of the pbsr <dig> plasmid  <cit>  in chromosome  <dig> at position  <dig> towards the 3’ end of the orf of the gene ddb_g <dig> . the predicted protein has not been studied before and it consists of a fnip repeat . we named the gene chtb because its social behavior resembles the previously described chta mutant  <cit> . to verify that the insertion was responsible for the mutant phenotype, the mutation was recapitulated by homologous recombination in the ax <dig> genetic background using the rescued plasmid as a knockout vector  <cit> . we confirmed the mutation by southern blot hybridization using a gene-specific probe and tested the strain for cheating.


rt-pcr analysis showed that the parental strain ax <dig> expressed the chtb mrna at  <dig> hours of development and mrna abundance was greatly increased at 4– <dig> hours . in the mutant cells, chtb mrna was not expressed at any time.


the chtb mutant cheats on the parental strain
to be defined as a cheater, the mutant chtb must produce significantly more than 50% of the spores in a pairwise mixing experiment with the parental strain, and this was the case. when mixed at equal proportions with ax <dig>  chtb differentiated  <dig> ± <dig> % of the total number of spores. this result differed significantly from the control chimera between ax <dig> and ax <dig>  .


analysis of fitness cost associated with cheating
chtb has no overt morphological defects
to test whether chtb shows any morphological difference relative to its ancestor, we observed cells of both strains at different stages of development. in both parent and knockout, we observed loose aggregates at about  <dig> hours, tight aggregates at  <dig> hours, fingers at  <dig> hours and mexican hats at  <dig> hours. between  <dig> and  <dig> hours both strains culminated, leading to the formation of well-proportioned fruiting bodies consisting of stalks cells and spores . we saw no noticeable differences between the phenotypes of ax <dig> and chtb developed on filters.


chtb differentiates a similar number of spores than ax <dig> in a pure population
a fitness cost for a cheater could be manifested as reduced sporulation when developing in a pure population. to test that possibility we developed chtb cells in a pure population or mixed with ax <dig> cells. the results  show that the sporulation efficiency of chtb  is not significantly different from ax <dig> , suggesting that the mutation does not have a sporulation-related fitness cost. the chimera sporulation efficiency was similar to both pure populations .

chtb spores are viable
we also tested whether a fitness cost may be associated with the spore germination efficiency. our results show that chtb was able to germinate a number of spores  comparable to ax <dig> . this result indicates that chtb does not produce fewer viable spores than its parent .

chtb grows faster in liquid medium
to compare the growth rates of the chtb mutant and its ancestor, we grew cultures of chtb and ax <dig> in liquid media starting at a cell density of 1x <dig> cells/ml. chtb reached log phase after about  <dig> hours, while ax <dig> took about  <dig> hours longer. when in logarithmic phase, chtb cells showed a doubling time of  <dig> ± <dig>  hours  while ax <dig> cells showed a doubling time of  <dig> ± <dig>  hours , showing that chtb has a faster doubling time than ax <dig> in liquid medium.


alteration of cell type proportioning as cheating mechanism
we assessed cell-type proportioning by measuring beta-galactosidase activity in cells that express the marker under the promoters of either cotb <cit>   or ecma <cit>  . we measured the overall enzyme activity in the population using an onpg-assay and the number of cells of each type using x-gal staining as described  <cit> . we compared the level of lacz expression in chimerae between the reporter strains and ax <dig> or chtb to determine the effect of chtb on prespore and prestalk differentiation in the ax <dig> victim.

prespore differentiation
onpg analysis of ax <dig>  showed that cotb is not expressed until  <dig> hours. then it starts increasing and reaches saturation at  <dig> hours . if ax <dig>  cells were mixed at a 1: <dig> ratio with ax <dig> cells that do not express lacz, the level of β-galactosidase activity is about half of that produced by ax <dig>  alone. when ax <dig>  cells were mixed at the same ratio with chtb cells, the β-galactosidase activity was significantly lower than in the mix with ax <dig> . these results show that in chimeras chtb is able to reduce the expression of cotb in the wild type cells and that ax <dig> cells are forced to form fewer prespore-cells than their fair share.


prestalk differentiation
to test whether the presence of chtb cells in chimeras affects prestalk cell formation in the victim, we performed a similar analysis using the strain ax <dig> alone and in pairwise mixes with ax <dig> and chtb . in this case, no significant differences were seen in the β-galactosidase activity when ax <dig> cells are mixed with ax <dig> or with chtb. we conclude that the presence of chtb cells in chimeras does not influence the expression of the prestalk marker ecma in the wild type cells.


developmental cell fate
the results obtained with onpg analysis show that the presence of chtb cells in a mix with ax <dig> reduces the promoter activity of the pre-spore gene cotb. this observation could be due to reduced cotb expression in all the wild type prespore cells, or to a reduction in the number of prespore cells in the wild type. we addressed this issue by counting the number of cells that expressed the marker gene. when ax <dig>  were mixed in equal proportions with chtb  they produced a significantly lower percentage of stained cells than when mixed with ax <dig> . therefore we conclude that, in chimera with wild type, chtb forces the parental cells to reduce the proportion of prespore cells and, as a consequence, to produce fewer spores. when the same test was performed using the ax <dig>  strain , there was no difference between the number of stained cells observed in mixes of ax <dig> with ax <dig> or chtb . we conclude that the presence of chtb in chimera did not affect the number of prestalk a cells produced by the victim strain, but could have made them become prestalk b  cells, which normally produces the basal disc of the fruiting body, or psto cells, which occupy the rear half of the prestalk region.


discussion
we isolated and characterized a mutant called chtb that cheats without overt fitness costs. chtb was isolated after a genetic selection for cheaters that were able to form fruiting bodies clonally  <cit> .

the mechanism by which chtb cheats in chimeras is novel. chtb reduced the expression of the prespore marker cotb in the wild type population as a consequence of the wild type strain forming fewer prespore cells than it does in control mixtures. one might expect then that these missing wild type prespore cells end up making stalk, but we found no evidence for this; chtb does not alter the wild type expression of the prestalk marker ecma. it is therefore unclear what happens to the wild type cells that would have produced spores.

to test whether the chtb mutation was associated with fitness costs, we tested the strain’s growth, developmental morphology, sporulation and germination efficiency and found no adverse effects compared to the ancestor ax <dig>  indeed there was some evidence of better performance by the mutant. the chtb mutant grows faster than the wild type in liquid medium. this finding cannot account for the increase in frequency of chtb during the original selection, because the selection was performed on agar plates, where chtb does not have a growth advantage  <cit> .

the behavior of the mutant raises both mechanistic and evolutionary questions. on the mechanistic side, we begin by asking whether its higher representation in spores is due to either fixed or facultative allocation strategies  <cit> . in the fixed allocation strategy, the cheater produces more spores than the loser when each are grown as pure clones. in this case, the cheater has not changed its behavior in chimera; its solitary strategy carried over to the chimeric setting gives it an advantage. in the facultative allocation strategy, the cheater produces more spores in chimeras than expected from its solitary production. the spore production of chtb is not significantly higher than that of ax <dig>  suggesting it is a facultative cheater. however the point estimate is higher, so it is worth considering whether, if that non-significant difference were real, it could explain cheating as a fixed strategy. in fact it cannot, as the  <dig> % representation observed in chimeras is significantly more than the expected fixed allocation of  <dig> % ). thus chtb appears to be a facultative cheater, indicating that an additional cheating mechanism is at play besides fixed higher spore production. several wild clones of dictyostelium discoideum <cit>  and many laboratory mutants  <cit>  are also cheaters that do not exhibit overt phenotypic abnormalities, but the previous studies did not explore possible costs that might be associated with the cheating behavior. cheater strains in a population can be viewed as parasites since they use common resources without paying the cost, which could lead to the collapse of the entire social machinery. several mechanisms have been suggested to explain why cheaters do not take over the entire population  <cit> . high relatedness is an important control of cheaters, because it means that like groups with like, so cheaters have reduced opportunity to exploit cooperators  <cit> . this explanation does not seem to apply to chtb because it does at least as well as wild type even when alone, so it would appear to be favored even at high relatedness, with an added boost from cheating in any chimeric mixtures.

with or without high relatedness, disadvantageous pleiotropic effects can also keep a mutant from spreading  <cit> . we detected no pleiotropic disadvantages of chtb. however, there are two important caveats. first, all the cheating experiments reported so far were performed in the laboratory under controlled environments. in the wild, however, factors like temperature, ph, and moisture could influence both cheating efficiency and pleiotropic effects. the chtb knockout behaves as a cheater under the conditions that we have used, but it may not be able to cheat in nature. likewise, inactivation of chtb had no apparent adverse consequences in the laboratory, but it must have a cost that would limit its propagation in nature, or the gene would have been lost. second, selective forces too small to effectively be detected in the laboratory could still be important in nature. one hypothesis that combines these two caveats is that chtb might suffer from reduced dispersal from shorter stalks. if chtb produces more spores, it may produce shorter stalks. we did not attempt stalk measurements because they are far less accurate and more variable than spore measurements. shorter stalks might reduce dispersal, presumably by animal vectors. another possibility is that the mechanism by which chtb knockouts achieve their success in chimera involves earlier fruiting. if this is the case, it could be that this is normally a disadvantage, keeping the mutant from spreading.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we describe a novel mechanism by which a d. discoideum cheater exploits parental strain cells by inhibiting them from producing spores. one way to understand how cooperative behaviours have evolved and are maintained is to identify the mechanisms cheaters use to exploit such cooperation. moreover, for the first time we concluded that under our experimental conditions there are no fitness costs associated with the cheater trait investigated, unlike the disadvantageous pleiotropic effects that are suggested mechanisms preventing cheaters from spreading in a population.
