BACKGROUND
thellungiella halophila  is used as a model system for understanding abiotic stress tolerance. it shows tolerance not only to extreme salinity stress, but also to chilling, freezing, and ozone stresses  <cit> . thellungiella is closely related to arabidopsis, with 90% cdna sequence identity between the two species, and it can be easily transformed by using the floral dipping method  <cit> . thellungiella has a number of other features useful for genetic research, such as small size, short life cycle, high seed number, and self-compatibility.

the arabidopsis genome sequence and other genetic resources, including collections of full-length cdnas, have provided powerful tools for comparative genomics to understand the biology and evolution of other plants  <cit> . in particular, highly accurate full-length cdna sequences that span the entire protein-coding region of a given gene can advance comparative, functional, and structural genome analyses. the accurate prediction of protein-coding regions in genome sequences is limited by the difficulty of finding islands of coding sequences within an ocean of noncoding dna, and by the complexity of individual genes that may code for multiple peptides through alternative splicing. the sequence data from full-length cdnas has contributed to the accuracy of annotation and to improving gene prediction in arabidopsis  <cit> . for these reasons, we have been working to collect similar data for thellungiella.

we previously reported construction of a full-length cdna library of thellungiella derived from various tissues and from whole seedlings subjected to environmental stress treatments, including high salinity, chilling, freezing, and abscisic acid . we obtained a total of  <dig>  <dig> sequences from  <dig>  <dig> clones, and named them riken thellungiella full-length  cdna clones. these sequences were assembled by using the cap <dig> method and were clustered into  <dig> nonredundant cdna groups  <cit> .

thellungiella has an effective system for suppressing na+ influx and for excreting na+  <cit> . it also exhibits high potassium/sodium selectivity, according to electrophysiological analysis of instantaneous current  <cit> . this implies that thellungiella has ion channels with specific features that lead to superior sodium/potassium homeostasis. membrane transporters have been shown to be important components of salt tolerance mechanisms in other species on account of their regulation of ion homeostasis. for example, the salt overly sensitive  pathway is a well-defined pathway in arabidopsis for the regulation of sodium ion homeostasis during plant growth under salinity stress  <cit> . in this pathway, a calcium-binding protein, sos <dig>  perceives a change in intracellular calcium concentration induced by salt stress and then binds to and activates sos <dig>  a serine/threonine protein kinase. the sos3-sos <dig> complex increases the expression and activity of sos <dig>  which encodes a plasma membrane na+/h+ exchanger   <cit> . activated sos <dig> transports cytosolic sodium out of the cell, reducing the cellular build-up of toxic levels of sodium  <cit> . the thellungiella sos <dig> gene, thsos <dig>  has a conserved amino acid sequence and protein structure with orthologous genes from arabidopsis and other plants  <cit> . transgenic thellungiella plants in which thsos <dig> transcript levels were reduced by rna interference  showed lower salt tolerance than wild-type plants, suggesting that sos <dig> is critical for salt tolerance in halophytic species as well as in glycophytic species such as arabidopsis  <cit> . recently, a 193-kb thellungiella bac clone containing the putative sos <dig> locus was sequenced, annotated, and compared with the sequence in the orthologous 146-kb region of the arabidopsis genome on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> .

here, we selected  <dig> cdnas for genes related to salt stress, transcription factors, transporters, and protein phosphatase 2cs from  <dig> individual rtfl clones, and determined the complete sequences. we then predicted the coding sequence , 5'-utr, and 3'-utr for each of the cdnas and compared them with the corresponding regions from the orthologous arabidopsis genes. we also compared the expression levels of thellungiella and arabidopsis na+-transport system genes by using full-length cdnas to probe northern blots under equal conditions of hybridization and detection.

RESULTS
selection and complete sequencing of  <dig> full-length cdnas
we selected  <dig> cdna clones representing salt-stress-related genes, transcription factors, and protein phosphatase 2cs for full-insert sequencing . the  <dig> cdna clones were completely sequenced, and the cds, 5'-utr, and 3'-utr were predicted for each . the distribution of 5'-utr, cds, and 3'-utr lengths is illustrated in figure 1; their average lengths were  <dig> ±  <dig> bp,  <dig> ±  <dig> bp, and  <dig> ±  <dig> bp, respectively. these results are comparable to the results obtained for cap-trapper full-length cdna collections from other plant species, including arabidopsis , maize , rice , and poplar .

comparison of cds, 5'-utr, and 3'-utr sequences between orthologous genes in thellungiella and arabidopsis
to assess the quality of the completely sequenced cdnas, we performed blast analysis using cds sequences against nucleotide or peptide sequences from the tair <dig> dataset  and identified arabidopsis orthologs of the  <dig> thellungiella genes. the average lengths of the arabidopsis orthologous cdss, 5'-utrs, and 3'-utrs were  <dig> ±  <dig> bp,  <dig> ±  <dig> bp, and  <dig> ±  <dig> bp, respectively. figure  <dig> compares lengths and identities between the cds, 5'-utr, and 3'-utr regions of the  <dig> thellungiella cdnas and those of the orthologous genes from arabidopsis. most cds pairs showed highly similar lengths, whereas the 5'- and 3'-utr pairs showed significant variation in length . the average nucleotide identity within homologous cds pairs was 87%, whereas the average identity within the 5'- and 3'-utr pairs was only 57% to 61% . a previous analysis of the transcriptional differences between thellungiella and arabidopsis showed that arabidopsis has a global defense strategy that requires bulk gene expression, while thellungiella induces expression of genes functioning in protein folding, posttranslational modification, and protein redistribution  <cit> . the sequence diversity in the 5'- and 3'-utr pairs may be involved in the posttranslational regulation of stress tolerance mechanisms in thellungiella.

comparison of structure of utr regions between thellungiella and arabidopsis
to compare the overall architecture of the utrs between thellungiella and arabidopsis, we randomly selected  <dig> orthologous pairs with 5'-utrs of least  <dig> bp in length from pp2cs, transcription factors and transporters, respectively. we identified motif families shared between the 5'-utrs of thellungiella and arabidopsis orthologs using the dragon motif builder system  <cit> . analyzing each of the orthologous pairs individually, we compared the order of the shared motifs between each pair . figure  <dig> shows the arrangement of the motifs in 5'-utr regions in nine orthologous gene pairs in thellungiella and arabidopsis. these motif sequences are shown in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  the members of each orthologous 5'-utr pair shared  <dig> to  <dig> motifs; however, positional rearrangements were found between the members of each pair. similar positional rearrangements of 5'-utr motifs were reported in a comparison of  <dig> pairs of orthologous sequences between common carp and zebrafish  <cit> . the presence of such shared motif families suggests the existence of regulatory components common to both species.

structural comparison of thsos <dig> and splicing variant thsos1s
only one clone was orthologous to arabidopsis sos <dig> among  <dig>  <dig> sequenced thellungiella cdnas  <cit> . the deduced protein was a splice variant of thsos <dig> . in the variant, an exon encoding  <dig> amino acid  residues  followed by a stop codon was inserted at the beginning of the 15th exon of thsos <dig> . we named the short variant thsos1s, for thellungiella halophila salt overly sensitive  <dig> short form. thsos <dig> comprises an n-terminal, integral membrane domain  and a c-terminal hydrophilic region. in contrast, the predicted thsos1s protein has the transmembrane domain of thsos <dig> but lacks the c-terminal hydrophilic region, because the stop codon occurs just after the sequence encoding the transmembrane domain .

the transmembrane portion of thsos1/thsos1s has sequence similarities with plasma membrane na+/h+ exchangers of animal, bacterial, and fungal cells  <cit> . in animal cells, na+/h+ exchanger  <dig>  functions as a na+/h+ antiporter to maintain ph homeostasis  <cit> . nhe <dig> has a c-terminal tail of ~ <dig> aa, which is important in regulating the na+/h+ antiporter activity through phosphorylation or binding of regulatory proteins  <cit> . the synechocystis na+/h+ antiporter synnhap also has a long hydrophilic c-terminal tail . in synnhap, the deletion of a 56-aa hydrophilic terminal region partially inhibited the antiporter activity, and replacement of the long c-terminal tail with the orthologous region from the halotolerant cyanobacterium aphanothece halophytica, apnhap, altered its ion specificity  <cit> . arabidopsis na+/h+ antiporter sos <dig> has  <dig> predicted transmembrane domains in the n-terminal region and a long cytoplasmic tail of ~ <dig> aa at the c-terminus  <cit> . the predicted cytoplasmic tail of sos <dig> interacts with radical-induced cell death  <dig> , a regulator of oxidative stress responses under salt or oxidative stress. like rcd <dig> mutants, sos <dig> mutants show an altered sensitivity to oxidative stresses  <cit> . these results suggest that the long c-terminal tail mediates not only the regulation of transport activity with a variety of intracellular regulatory proteins, but also the ion specificity and the cross-talk with other stress tolerance mechanisms.

the n-terminal transmembrane region of sos <dig> shows high similarity among various organisms , whereas there is no significant similarity among the c-terminal regions  <cit> . the c-terminal sequence variation may result in different functions for this region among different organisms. in particular, nhap, a na+/h+ antiporter of pseudomonas aeruginosa, is highly homologous to sos <dig>  nhe <dig>  synnhap, and apnha <dig> , but it does not have the c-terminal long tail  <cit> . thsos1s is similar to nhap in that it contains only a na+/h+-exchanger domain in the transmembrane domain. it is possible that thsos1s functions as an na+/h+ antiporter whereas thsos <dig> functions not only in salt stress response , but also in response to other abiotic stresses .

expression levels of thsos <dig> and thsos1s
we performed qrt-pcr analysis of thsos <dig> and thsos1s expression by using primers specific to each of these splice variants . we detected both transcripts, suggesting that thellungiella normally produces both forms . interestingly, the expression level of thsos1s under normal growth conditions was higher than that of thsos <dig>  the expression level of sos <dig> in thellungiella is higher than that in arabidopsis when full-length cdnas are used as probes, especially under normal growth conditions  <cit> . these data suggest that the high expression of thsos <dig> detected under normal growth conditions derive from the high expression level of thsos1s. to confirm the existence of such a similar splice variant in arabidopsis, rt-pcr was performed using primer sets that are able to detect the splice variants in thellungiella and arabidopsis. the short splice variant corresponding to thsos1s was not detected in arabidopsis, whereas both splice variants were detected in thellungiella . this result suggests that the short splice variant of sos <dig> is specific to thellungiella.

expression profiles of na+ transport genes of thellungiella and arabidopsis
the set of completely sequenced thellungiella cdna clones contains several genes that function in the na+ transport system, including sos <dig>  nhx <dig>  nhx <dig>  nhx <dig>  and high affinity k+ transporter  <dig> . we performed rna blot analysis of these genes in both thellungiella and arabidopsis using full-length cdnas as probes. in each case, rna blots of a given species were hybridized with probes derived from that same species, with conditions of probe radioactivity, hybridization, and exposure period normalized between the two species. the expression levels of sos <dig>  nhx <dig>  nhx <dig> and hkt <dig> in thellungiella were higher than those in arabidopsis under both normal and high-salinity conditions . sos <dig>  nhx <dig>  and hkt <dig> play essential roles in salt tolerance in arabidopsis  <cit> , and transgenic plants overexpressing either sos <dig> or nhx <dig> show higher tolerance to salt stress than do wild-type plants  <cit> . in particular, the expression level of nhx <dig> was very high in thellungiella under both normal- and high-salinity conditions, suggesting that the constitutively high expression of molecules functioning in na+ transport may partly account for the high salinity tolerance of thellungiella.

it is difficult to understand the relationship between hkt <dig> expression and salinity tolerance. on the one hand, the overexpression of athkt <dig> increased sensitivity to nacl  compared with wild-type plants  <cit> . on the other hand, the ectopic production of wheat hkt <dig> containing specific amino acid substitutions  enhanced nacl tolerance in yeast  <cit> . we compared the deduced amino acid sequences of hkt <dig> among arabidopsis, thellungiella, and wheat to search for point mutations inducing higher salt tolerance in thellungiella hkt <dig>  however, none of the mutations that gave high salt tolerance in the wheat hkt <dig> experiment was found in thellungiella hkt <dig> . it remains unknown whether other differences in the hkt <dig> sequences between thellungiella and arabidopsis confer salinity tolerance to thellungiella. arabidopsis hkt <dig> transports only na+, not k+, because in the k+ channel motif gyg, which is critical for k+ selectivity, the first glycine is replaced with serine   <cit> . the same position in the thellungiella hkt <dig> ortholog is also serine , suggesting that thellungiella hkt <dig> also transports only na+.

CONCLUSIONS
we sequenced  <dig> thellungiella cdnas and used this information to compare the responses of thellungiella and arabidopsis to high-salinity conditions. the full-length cdna sequences will contribute to annotation of the thellungiella genome and will improve gene predictions. moreover, these fully sequenced cdnas will enable finding splicing variants such as thsos1s. rna blot analysis indicated that the extreme salt tolerance of thellungiella might be attributable to the constitutively higher expression of genes functioning in the na+ transport system.
