BACKGROUND
brucella is a facultative intracellular pathogen that causes abortion in cattle, goats and sheep and a febrile illness  in humans. animal brucellosis is a serious problem worldwide and is endemic globally. in areas where it is endemic, human brucellosis is quite common but often not diagnosed. there are six recognized brucella species that differ in their preference for certain hosts. b. abortus preferentially infects cattle, b. melitensis infects sheep and goats, and b. suis infects pigs. all three of these species, as well as b. canis, can infect humans, and b. melitensis is associated with the most serious human infections  <cit> . the brucellae are grouped with the α-proteobacteria and are related to other cell-associated parasites of plants and animals. the classical brucella taxonomy is based on six species  characterized by their host preferences. later observations of high homology from dna-dna hybridization studies led many to adopt a monospecific system  <cit> . the subcommittee on the taxonomy of brucella also accepted this classification in  <dig>  along with the caveat that the classical species names should be used "to avoid confusion." most researchers still prefer to use the species system, which recently has been given more credence by detailed biochemical and genetic studies  <cit> .

macrophages are among the first targets of brucella invasion, and the bacteria can survive within this naturally hostile intracellular environment  <cit> . macrophages are important in transporting brucella to tissues throughout the host, where they can survive in a variety of cell types  <cit> . several studies have suggested that brucella delays phagolysosomal fusion as a survival mechanism in macrophages, while in non-professional phagocytes brucella appears to modulate the interior of the phagosome and evades intracellular degradation by avoiding the endocytic/phagocytic cascade  <cit> . it is not known definitively where brucella replicates within the vertebrate cell. observations have suggested that brucella replicates within the rough endoplasmic reticulum  in several cell types, including trophoblasts  <cit>  and vero cells  <cit> . it has been shown that lipid raft-associated molecules, such as glycophosphatidylinositol anchored molecules, play a role in determining the intracellular fate of brucella  <cit> . studies identifying er markers on brucella-containing compartments have also supported the theory of the er as the site of replication  <cit> . the detailed mechanism of brucella intracellular survival is not well understood and is assumed related to patterns of gene expression in both the pathogen and host. for example, most brucella spp. are smooth due to expression of o-side chain genes, replicate inside macrophages and are virulent. in contrast, b. canis is rough, yet still capable of macrophage survival and is also virulent  <cit> . in the interest of developing a dna microarray optimized for comparative study of the brucellae, we have carried out a three-way genome comparison of b. suis  <cit> , b. melitensis  <cit> , and draft b. abortus  <cit>  sequences, at both the nucleotide and predicted coding sequence  levels. b. melitensis, b. suis, and b. abortus each have approximately  <dig> mb of genomic dna, divided into a large chromosome of approximately  <dig> mb and a small chromosome of approximately  <dig> mb. we found that over  <dig> genes identified in b. suis or b. melitensis appear to have a homolog in both of these genomes and also in b. abortus. fewer than  <dig> genes were identified as present in only one or two of the three genomes, with an additional group of close to  <dig> genes having significant deletions in one or two of the genomes relative to the others. annotated or predicted genomic sequence features that appear to distinguish the three species were probed using pcr and rt-pcr, to verify their uniqueness and to test for transcription under in vitro growth conditions. pcr primers were then used to assay and classify several variant strains. differentiating genes will provide targets for rapid discrimination among brucella species, as probes on a diagnostic chip, and will also be useful for elucidation of differences in host preference and mechanism of virulence among these closely related species.

RESULTS
three-way genome comparison
the genomes of the three sequenced brucella biovars  were compared globally to identify the extent of similarity between these closely related bacterial species.

our results for comparison of b. suis to b. melitensis  were generally in agreement with those of paulsen et al.,  <dig>  <cit> . we further tried to pinpoint which of the potentially unique genes could also distinguish b. melitensis and b. suis from b. abortus, and would therefore be of interest as differentiating probes on an expression array, by including draft genome sequence from b. abortus in the comparison. subsequent results of comparisons to the finished b. abortus sequence by halling et al.  <cit> , are in reasonable agreement with our results, though some minor differences in feature identification arose from our use of a draft annotation. our computational and experimental analysis identified and confirmed a set of  <dig> orfs to be present in b. suis  <dig>  but not in b. melitensis  <dig> m or b. abortus 9- <dig>  and another  <dig> orfs found in both b. suis  <dig> and b. abortus 9- <dig>  but not in b. melitensis  <dig> m. these differentiating orfs extend a known set of  <dig> orfs, which have been shown experimentally to differ in expression between the brucella species in a b. melitensis  <dig> m based microarray experiment  <cit> . our three-way genomic comparison together with the genomic comparison performed by halling et al.  <cit> , demonstrates that b. suis  <dig> and b. abortus 9- <dig> both contain the orfs identical to bmei <dig>  bmeii <dig>  bmei  <dig>  and bmei <dig>  bmei1919- <dig>  bmei <dig>  bmeii <dig>  bmeii <dig>  and bmei <dig>  which were shown to be completely or partially missing from either b. suis s <dig> or b. abortus s <dig> or both respectively  <cit> .

supporting previous findings that the three genomes are highly similar, the majority  of annotated genes were found to share 98–100% sequence identity at the nucleotide level with their apparent homologues in each of the other genomes. the majority of differentiating genes identified are in large  regions, which partly account for differences in chromosome size. most of these genes have functional assignments in existing annotation. table  <dig> provides a detailed description of the differentiating genes identified in this study, organized according to their order in the b. suis genome, or in the b. melitensis genome in those cases where there was no b. suis sequence match. genes shown as present in b. suis and b. melitensis but absent in b. abortus mainly correspond to a large deletion in the genome sequence of b. abortus relative to the other genomes, which was previously identified by vizcaino and colleagues  <cit> , and identifiable in . the identities of these genes were confirmed by comparison of that record to the draft b. abortus sequence.

functional significance of genomic differences
we identified several multi-gene regions that contain the majority of differentiating genes . these six regions alone are sufficient to discriminate between the three brucella species. in a pairwise comparison, thirty-three regions were described as unique to either b. suis or b. melitensis  <cit> . in a three-way comparison that included the draft b. abortus sequence, we find that many of these differentiating features can no longer be considered unique for the purpose of discriminating among the three species. fewer single-species specific genes remain, twenty-two unique genes in b. suis and one in b. melitensis, which demonstrates the homogeneity of the genus. a complete list of differentiating coding regions is given in table  <dig>  and their possible significance is described below.

metabolism
several cdss homologous to components of an amino acid abc transport system were found in b. abortus and b. suis but were absent in b. melitensis. this may indicate that b. abortus and b. suis have the ability to utilize a nutrient that b. melitensis does not. different patterns of amino acid utilization are used to distinguish among the brucellae  <cit> , and variations in amino acid transporter content are consistent with the observation that each species has a distinct pattern of nutrient utilization. most of these genes are present on the differentiating region sa <dig> , suggesting that the acquisition or loss of this region could have been related to a change in environment or nutrient availability for the ancestral species. two abc transporter permeases  unique to b. suis were also identified. transcription of these genes in b. suis was detected by rt-pcr .

virulence
a detailed analysis of a  <dig> kb region  was performed to complement our general comparison of gene content. this  <dig> kb region resides on chromosome ii of each brucella species and may represent a composite transposon  <cit> . it is flanked with insertion sequences that suggest a foreign origin, although its g+c content  is close to the brucella average. although this island does not contain obvious virulence genes, it includes a large number of peptide abc transporter genes. in some pathogens, autotransporter proteins have been implicated as virulence determinants  <cit> ; whether this is the case for the brucellae has not been reported as yet.

comparison with b. suis shows that this region is also present in b. melitensis and b. abortus  but contains deletions in the dipeptide abc transporter permease protein gene, the 3-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydrogenase family protein gene, and a transcriptional regulator. each of these small deletions is in-frame, but result in missing amino acids and potentially in altered function, perhaps explaining significant metabolic differences between the three species.

a  <dig> kb region present only in b. suis and b. melitensis was revealed by three-way comparison to be a differentiating feature. this region, absent only in b. abortus , contains five glycosyl transferases  and a succinoglycan biosynthesis transport protein . however, no transcription of succinoglycan biosynthesis transport protein was detected by rt-pcr for either species. in b. melitensis, transcription of four out of five glycosyl transferases was detected by rt-pcr, while in b. suis transcription of only one of these genes was observed. these genes may be important in o-side chain biosynthesis – one of the known virulence determinants of brucella  <cit> . this region also contains several uncharacterized genes that may be novel virulence factors, including a putative outer membrane protein and several conserved hypothetical proteins. this region was shown to be present in b. melitensis, b. suis, b. ovis, b. canis, and b. neotomae, but not in b. abortus  <cit> . vizcaino et al. conjecture that this region is absent due to a deletion event before the differentiation of this species and its biovars, since none of the b. abortus biovars possess this region. the deletion of this island may have impacted the host range of b. abortus and pushed its divergence from the brucella ancestor.

a three-way comparison also reveals species-specific differences in two gene clusters of urease subunits present on chromosome ii of b. suis, b. abortus, and b. melitensis . some subunits of these clusters are conserved among other bacterial species, and ureases have been shown to be important to virulence in several animal models of bacterial infection  <cit> . b. melitensis has a  <dig> bp insertion in urea- <dig> , representing a potential frame shift. a  <dig> bp insertion in the ured- <dig>  gene of b. abortus was identified, within overlapping segments of a highly repetitive region of the gene. in the uree- <dig> gene  of b. abortus two separate single base deletions are present, possibly shifting the frame of translation. finally, the last  <dig> bp of uree- <dig>  were shown to be 100% identical in b. abortus and b. melitensis but significantly diverged in b. suis, including a  <dig> bp deletion. this variation within these urease gene clusters could prove to be significant to virulence differences.

secretion systems
our analysis revealed a cluster of transfer genes  unique to b. suis and potentially significant to secretion . transcription of all but one gene in this island was observed by rt-pcr. several genes in this region  are homologous to genes involved in mating pair formation described for escherichia coli plasmid rp <dig>  <cit> , to receptor complex formation in bacteriophage-host gene transfer systems  <cit> , and to genes of type iv secretion systems of other species of bacteria. agrobacterium contains both a virb type iv secretion system and a tra/trb bacterial conjugation system. these systems are homologous and share common ancestral origins, but they are functionally independent and physically separate  <cit> . brucella spp. lack a conjugation system, which suggests that the genes in this region play a role in type iv secretion, or are part of an uncharacterized macromolecule or gene transfer system. the organization of this unique s <dig> region suggests a pattern of co-transcription. the short intergenic regions between the cdss may indicate that these genes are organized as operons and are co-transcribed. in the case of the bra0372-bra <dig> operon, the start codon of bra <dig> lies within bra <dig> that may indicate a - <dig> or - <dig> frame shift mechanism for transcription of bra <dig>  examples of this type of gene/operon organization have primarily been identified in viruses  <cit> . it has also been identified in prokaryotes  <cit> , although in some cases it can be an artifact of annotation error  <cit> . additional study is needed to confirm the annotation in this case. type iii secretion systems are assembled from components of flagellar machinery  <cit> . although brucella does not normally produce flagella, our analysis reveals a flagellar gene  present in differentiating region ma <dig>  this gene is on chromosome i, instead of within one of three flagellar gene clusters on chromosome ii. it is also more than twice  the normal size  for this protein. in b. melitensis, all the structural genes for flagellum formation are present but genes for the chemotactic receptors or transducers are absent  <cit> . based on the presence of several flagellar genes and a homologue of the lcrd virulence superfamily in b. abortus, it has been suggested that brucella has the potential for motility and type iii secretion  <cit> . however, a recent study did not detect transcription by rt-pcr in b. melitensis grown in albimi broth of four flagellar genes  present in b. suis, b. abortus, and b. ovis  <cit> . our rt-pcr results revealed no transcription of the flagellar differential gene flgj in brucella grown in trypticase soy broth. transcription was detected in ten genes within the same region ma <dig> that are defined as hypothetical proteins  <cit> . recent studies suggest that a flagellar gene promoter  is induced when b. suis is replicating in macrophages; additional studies on flagellar gene expression have been performed  <cit> . it appears that at least b. melitensis can produce flagella transiently in-vitro in pure culture  <cit>  and fla genes are necessary for chronic infection in mice  <cit> . thus it is likely that flagellar gene expression occurs when brucella is replicating in an intracellular environment such as macrophages.

site-specific recombinases
an apparent recombinase homologue  was identified as the sole unique gene for b. melitensis, and our rt-pcr results indicated that it is transcribed. there are two resolvase family genes  in the b. melitensis annotation for chromosome i located in opposite orientations. these two genes share homology over a  <dig> bp consensus sequence. however, one putative recombinase  is much larger than the other . they may be considered paralogous, but bme <dig> contains more than  <dig> bp not present in any other species. in the b. suis annotation, there are two almost identical recombinases of equal size  present, in opposite orientations. these only have small matches to bme1661/bmei <dig> . however, both b. abortus and b. suis contain  <dig> copies of ~ <dig> bp homologous to bme1661/bmei <dig>  mostly within intergenic sequence. overall, a  <dig> bp consensus is present in two copies in all three species, but ~ <dig> bp of the bmei <dig> gene in b. melitensis is unique to this species. site-specific recombination has been shown to be involved with acquisition of drug resistance genes and alteration of gene expression  <cit> , suggesting that this unique gene may play a role in virulence.

evolutionary implications
our analysis reinforces the view that the brucellae are highly similar – much more identical to each other than are other groups of closely related bacteria. it has been suggested that the low rate of genetic exchange between brucella spp. and other species is due to their niches within cells as intracellular parasites  <cit> . however, several multi-gene differentiating islands identified in our comparison  contain atypical g+c contents that is consistent with gene acquisition via horizontal transfer. island ma <dig> exhibits a g+c content of 52% and contains a putative phage integrase family transposase at the end of the gene cluster in both b. abortus and b. melitensis. escherichia coli has a g+c content of  <dig> %, and has been demonstrated to transfer a broad host range plasmid to brucella under laboratory conditions  <cit> . other islands have base compositions close to the average brucella g+c content. island sm <dig> exhibits a g+c content of 58% in both b. melitensis and b. suis. the presence of phage genes suggests that lysogenic conversion may have occurred  <cit> . the island s <dig> that is unique to b. suis and containing  <dig> tra/trb genes has a g+c content of  <dig> % and is flanked by a phage integrase homologue. two phage gene homologues  are present within island sa <dig> and two phage gene homologues  flank the island. island sa <dig> contains a phage minor tail protein l homologue. this evidence is consistent with phage-mediated transduction and suggests that phages may have helped the brucellae adapt to their intracellular niches.

rt-pcr analysis of differentiating regions
reverse transcription  experiments were performed for all of the predicted coding sequences from the differentiating regions of b. suis, b. melitensis and b. abortus to determine whether they are transcribed in the species-specific pattern expected. when no amplicon was observed by rt-pcr, regular pcr reactions were performed to confirm the presence of differentiating sequences in genomic dna. a total of  <dig> primer pairs were designed, for rt-pcr reactions targeting a total of  <dig> genes. three of these were partial differentials – homologs that appeared to have significant insertions in one species relative to another in which a unique primer or probe could be placed to distinguish among species – and more than one primer pair was used in some of these cases.

differential targets identify variant strains
pcr and rt-pcr assays for predicted differential genes in the sequenced brucella biovars showed that these differentials do occur in the predicted patterns. they can be used to discriminate genomic dna from isolates of the three sequenced strains, although not all of the differentials are expressed in the late log phase. to test whether the differential sequences would be useful distinguishing the sequenced strains among a larger field of brucella biovars we assayed  <dig> biovars using  <dig> of the  <dig> primer pairs.

we found that ten of the pcr primer pairs tested could provide information about strain identification when other biovars were considered. the pcr results are summarized in a graphical panel on figure  <dig>  and the primer sequences and amplicon sizes are provided in table  <dig>  the presence of an amplicon from primer pair  <dig> is uniquely characteristic of the b. abortus strains  <cit> . this primer pair was screened against the entire genbank database and turned to be highly b. abortus specific. the presence of amplicons from pairs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> is characteristic of all b. suis strains except  <dig>  these sequences are also present in b. canis; additional identifying information is provided by the variable region amplified by probe pair one, as described below. primer pair  <dig> was originally selected to identify b. melitensis, but was found to occur in some b. suis strains. however, primer pair  <dig> was able to amplify a  <dig> bp unique fragment in b. melitensis. primer pair  <dig>  which was expected to amplify a unique region in b. suis  <dig>  produced a single band of varying size in every one of the  <dig> brucella biovars. this polymorphic region encoding for an immunoglobulin-binding protein has a potential diagnostic application.

the patterns we observed by pcr screening several brucella biovars can be used in a simple sequence of pcr assays, which differentiates between the classical brucella strains . the assay starts with an unknown bacterial culture, which is tested with a genus specific primer pair capable to amplify a dna fragment from any bacterial strain of genus brucella. the primer pair  <dig> is highly specific to b. abortus and amplifies a single band in the seven biovars that were tested. if the primer pair  <dig> fails to produce a fragment, the bacterial culture that we test belongs to b. canis, b. melitensis, b. neotomae, b. ovis or b. suis. the pcr primer pair  <dig> helps to rule out two of the brucella species by giving a substantially shorter fragment in all three b. melitensis biovars, and no amplicon in b. ovis  <dig>  primer pair  <dig>  separates b. neotomae 5k <dig>  the next step in the diagnostic assay is to separate b. canis from b. suis. although computational analysis identified the presence of large unique islands in brucella suis  <dig>  the pcr results revealed that these islands are absent from b. suis  <dig> and found in the evolutionary related b. canis rm and also b. neotomae 5k <dig> biovars. use of the primer pair  <dig>  can separate most of the b. suis biovars, but an additional pcr with the primer pair  <dig>  is necessary to separate b. suis  <dig> from b. canis rm. at every identification step additional pcr reactions may be set up to confirm the brucella species identity. the same differential regions can be used as the discriminatory features on a diagnostic microarray. the primers used in this assay have been screened against all sequences currently present in genbank. the primer pairs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and control revealed significant full length matches at the nucleotide sequence level only to brucella spp., when compared to the complete genbank database. primer pairs designed for these sequences were also found to be unique when compared to the complete genbank database with blastn in short nearly exact match mode. primer pairs were considered unique if both of the primers in a pair did not have a short nearly exact match hit in the same genome, or, if both did have a short hit in the same genome, the predicted amplicon was longer than  <dig> bp or the primer sequence hits were shorter than 14/ <dig> bp. we determined, using hyther  <cit> , that duplexes of  <dig> nt and below had melting temperatures below the annealing temperature used in the experiment. primer pairs described as unique to brucella spp. meet these criteria and, therefore, may be useful to verify the presence of brucella specific dna even in the presence of the host dna.

CONCLUSIONS
differentiating genes identified in a comprehensive whole-genome comparison among sequenced brucella biovars have been used successfully as targets to discriminate among brucella strains using a small number of strategically selected pcr assays. the successful differentiating targets have been placed as features on a discriminatory synthetic  <dig> mer oligonucleotide array for diagnosis of brucella infections, as well as a more comprehensive brucella array that will be used to examine differential gene expression during host-pathogen interactions. with these experiments, we hope to determine whether differences in virulence or host preferences between brucella spp. are due to unique genes or differences in transcription and expression. the information we can obtain from differential expression studies will complement recent research in comparative proteomics of brucella  <cit> . none of the differentiating genes for b. melitensis that we identified have yet been detected in the proteome in vitro; however, the above proteomics study resulted in annotation of only 6% of the predicted genes in b. melitensis. we anticipate that the answers to questions about host preference and virulence will lie in the results obtained from a combination of microarray and functional analyses of mutant strains suggested by genomic analysis and global gene expression approaches.
