BACKGROUND
obtaining a good method for reconstructing the phylogenetic topology of four taxa is one of the crucial goals in phylogenetics. the four-taxon trees, if correctly inferred, can be used as input of quartet-based methods in order to reconstruct larger trees. but due to the complexity of real data, the problem of reconstructing four-taxon trees is not so easy. most phylogenetic reconstruction methods assume simple evolutionary models that may not really fit real data, which leads to incorrect phylogenetic inference . for example, many of them rely on continuous-time markov processes with a constant instantaneous mutation rate matrix along the tree , and also assume time-reversibility . on the other hand, as pointed out in
 <cit> , in order to make quartet-based methods work it is extremely important to obtain 4-taxon tree reconstruction methods that are not affected by the presence of long-branch attraction
 <cit> .

most evolutionary models are described by a markov process over the tree, that is, conditional rates of change at two diverging sequences depend only on the current state and are independent of the previous sates . markov processes on trees are specified by a distribution at the root of the tree and a transition matrix at each branch and, in contrast to continuous-time models, the markov process on each branch is not assumed to be time-homogeneous
 <cit>  . these models directly consider as parameters the entries of the substitution matrices and the root distribution . barry and hartigan
 <cit>  considered such a general markov model , which does not assume any other constraints. in particular, it is locally and globally time nonhomogeneous  and it is neither time-reversible nor stationary. the only restriction underlying this model is that sites evolve independently and are identically distributed . considering this model and its submodels is one way of covering more general scenarios, in contrast to those phylogenetic methods that implement time-homogeneous and time-reversible continuous-time models  cf
 <cit> .

the gmm above accounts for  <dig> parameters per edge plus three parameters for the root distribution. when some symmetries on the transition matrices or on the root distribution are imposed, one obtains the substitution matrices of the corresponding jukes-cantor and kimura  models among others ,
 <cit> , see methods section). for instance, the markov version of the k <dig> model
 <cit>   deals with  <dig> parameters per edge  which makes a total of 3 ∗  parameters in unrooted trivalent trees with n leaves, whereas the usual time-homogeneous continuous-time version accounts for  <dig> parameters for a normalized instantaneous rate matrix constant over the tree plus one parameter per edge length  parameters on an unrooted trivalent tree). notice, however, that if one considers a time nonhomogeneous continuous-time kimura 3-parameter model, then the number of parameters is exactly the same as for k81*. in this case, the only difference between both models is that k81* does not even assume local homogeneity , while all time-continuous models do. the huge amount of parameters for nonhomogeneous models makes a maximum-likelihood approach unfeasible and unreliable for a whole tree on n taxa if n is large. nevertheless, there is some hope that these more general models lead to accurate methods on 4-taxon trees. in our setting, we only deal with substitutions of nucleotides  on 4-taxon trees and we will always assume the i.i.d. hypothesis .

in this paper we develop a maximum likelihood framework for inferring the best tree topology under  markov processes. our approach is based on the widely used expectation-maximization algorithm. the expectation-maximization algorithm , as introduced in
 <cit> , is an iterative algorithm for finding maximum likelihood estimates of parameters in statistical models that deal with unobserved data. we have adapted this algorithm to the case of phylogenetic 4-taxon trees in what we call emtree. em iteratively gives an expectation of the distribution of the nucleotide sequences at the interior nodes  and finds the parameters that maximize the likelihood for these data in the so-called m-step . the em algorithm has been applied to many other disciplines .

the use of the em algorithm to estimate the continuous parameters of a phylogenetic tree under a markov process  has been already discussed in
 <cit>  and
 <cit> . in this paper we focus on the use of emtree for estimating the tree topology for four taxa and test its performance in reconstructing the correct tree topology on simulated data. we shall see that, although it is a time consuming algorithm, it can lead to very accurate results.

first of all we test it as a 4-taxon tree reconstruction method by using the tree space proposed by huelsenbeck
 <cit>  on data simulated from a general markov process first and then restricting to a time-homogeneous  process. we compare emtree to neighbor-joining and to the usual  maximum likelihood approach under both global homogeneity and nonhomogeneity . as all models considered will be stationary , we will not be evaluating compositional heterogeneity but only the effect of the variation of substitution rates among lineages
 <cit> . afterwards, we use these three methods as input of two quartet-based methods: one weighted  and one unweighted ; and compare their performance on the 12-taxon trees proposed in
 <cit> . specially for largely divergent trees, we observe that emtree gives the best results and is less subject to long-branch attraction.

RESULTS
in this section we present the results of the topology reconstruction method emtree on simulated data evolving both under homogeneous and nonhomogeneous markov processes.

in figure
 <dig> we present the performance of three different topology reconstruction methods on the 4-taxon tree space proposed by huelsenbeck
 <cit>  : figure
 <dig> for the usual neighbor-joining  with the k <dig> distance,  <dig> for the usual maximum likelihood tree  assuming time-homogeneous continuous-time k <dig> model, and  <dig> emtree for k81* model. the huelsenbeck tree space covers a wide range of branch lengths for 4-taxon trees: parameters a and b denote branch lengths as indicated in figure
 <dig> and they were varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> . for each pair  we draw a black cell if the topology is correctly reconstructed on the  <dig> simulated alignments; a white cell denotes less than 33% success; and the gray scale used in between is shown in the figures. the alignments were generated following the k81* model  and had length  <dig>  and  <dig> bp .

the results show that nj has difficulties in the felsenstein zone where the long-branch attraction problem is present  and ml fails for largely divergent trees . the emtree algorithm seems to overcome these two difficulties and is clearly more accurate than nj and ml in this tree space. nevertheless, we need to point out that the data were simulated according to k81* model, which fits the assumptions of emtree but not of nj nor ml methods . this model misspecification for ml leads to in incorrect inference of parameters, which is even more extreme for long branches
 <cit>  ). to confront this situation, we also generated data under time-homogeneous continuous-time k <dig> model. the results are depicted in the left column of figure
 <dig> and clearly show a similar success of ml and emtree in this case.

in order to compare emtree to time nonhomogeneous but continuous-time ml, we generated data evolving under a continuous-time nonhomogeneous k <dig> model. this is a special case of k81* and therefore this model matches both approaches: emtree  and bppml <cit>  restricted to a nonhomogeneous continuous-time k <dig> model. on figure
 <dig>  we present the results of these two methods on nonhomogeneous k <dig> data to show that both methods perform similarly and outperform nj.

although emtree may give more accurate results on more general data, it is a time consuming algorithm. indeed, on 4-taxon trees, emtree is almost  <dig> times slower than nj and more than  <dig> times slower than ml. for example on  <dig> 4-taxon alignments of 600bp, the execution time on a intel core i5-4200u cpu @  <dig> ghz  was  <dig> s for emtree on k81*,  <dig> s for paml ml on homogeneous continuous-time k <dig>   <dig>  for bppml on nonhomogeneous k <dig> model, and  <dig> s for nj .

now we present the results that test the use of emtree, nj, and  ml as methods to obtain the input for the quartet-based methods quartetsuite and qfit on data generated under k81* model.

for the three topologies on twelve taxa studied here , we give the proportion of the  reconstructed trees whose robinson-foulds distance to the original topology is equal to  <dig> , <dig>  or > <dig>  for both quartetsuite and qfit, and for the three input methods under study. the results are displayed in figures
 <dig>  and
 <dig>  for simulated alignments of  <dig> bp and in figures a <dig> and a <dig> of the additional file
 <dig> for  <dig> bp. the figures for both alignment lengths are similar and present the same trends , so we let the results on  <dig> bp for the additional file
 <dig>  in figure
 <dig> we also present the performance of a global nj and a global ml .
 <cit> : cc , cd , dd ; b is the branch length parameter that varies in { <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> } along the paper.

in both quartet-based methods , the reconstruction of the cc topology presents the best results compared to the others, independently of the algorithm used as input quartets . the same tendency is shared by global ml and nj. conversely, the topology dd is never correctly reconstructed for any of the methods or branch lengths. it is worth noting that cc is the topology that would have the least long branch attraction and dd is the one that would have the most . therefore our results are consistent with the observation in
 <cit>  that the success of a quartet based method depends on the capacity of the input method to correctly reconstruct 4-taxon trees under the long-branch attraction problem.

in both figures
 <dig> and
 <dig> we observe that the performance of ml and emtree is quite similar in most cases, although ml never outperforms emtree. a detailed look at these figures reveals that for largely divergent trees , emtree is the best quartet input method among those considered here, as its results outperform nj and ml for both quartetsuite and qfit and in all tree topologies. we find the explanation of this result in the management of long-branch attraction by the different methods considered. long branches lead to similar sequences as a result of multiple substitutions and, as ml estimates have been computed on a wrong substitution model, this method is more influenced by long-branch attraction. emtree has also a better success than a global nj and a global ml on the trees cd and dd, but on the “easiest” tree cc, a global ml is more accurate. for the largely divergent cc tree, a global ml has better average performance than emtree , but it never succeeds in fully reconstructing the topology .

when considering the quartetsuite method, nj is clearly the worst quartet input method for all tree topologies and branch lengths. this is probably due to the fact that the willson method implemented in quartetsuite is intended for weighted quartets, whereas nj quartets are given only binary weights. on the contrary, for the unweighted method qfit, nj seems to be more accurate than ml and emtree for topologies cc and dd but only for low divergence .

we want to point out that, in general, qfit gives worse results than quartetsuite , reinforcing the idea that weighted methods are more reliable
 <cit> .

in tables
 <dig> and
 <dig> we display the mean of the robinson-foulds distance of the same study on the 12-taxon trees, and its variance in parentheses . results are presented for alignments of  <dig> bp and have to be interpreted as less mean, better approximation . for each tree topology and each choice of parameter b, the best method  is marked in bold print.

in these tables we observe that quartetsuite gives the lowest distance to the original tree in general and that the best results for largely divergent trees  are obtained by emtree . whenever the mean of robinson-foulds distance for  ml is lower than the mean for emtree, there is no significant difference. overall, emtree is the method that outperforms the other two quartet input methods in most cases. as far as global methods are concerned, it is worth pointing out the bad performance of a global nj on trees cd and dd , specially if one takes into account that the robinson-foulds distance for the  star tree is  <dig> 

when inspecting the variances, one sees that emtree is the only quartet input method that preserves low variances in all cases . conversely, the variances are extremely large for nj with quartetsuite in all different scenarios, and they are also huge for  ml when the trees are largely divergent . qfit presents low variances in all cases, for all input methods, probably because the input information is less “subject to vary” . it is worth pointing out that whenever quartet input nj outperforms ml and emtree , it does so with larger variance than the other two methods.

CONCLUSIONS
we tested the accuracy of the  method emtree as a method to infer 4-taxon topologies under  markov models, and compared it to nj and ml . when emtree and ml are tested on data satisfying the assumptions of both methods, they have a similar performance. nevertheless, emtree is based on time nonhomogeneous models , and hence outperforms the other methods when these assume homogeneity.

there are only few nonhomogeneous continuous-time models that could be fairly compared to general markov processes, and one expects that under more complex evolutionary scenarios , the success of usual ml or nj methods  will be poorer , confirming that an em approach based on general markov processes, could be more recommendable.

emtree is a time-consuming algorithm, however, and the user has to decide whether it is worth performing such an analysis .

we have also assessed emtree, nj, and ml as input for the quartet-based methods qfit and quartetsuite. to do so, we have considered three different topologies on twelve taxa evolving under tome nonhomogeneous processes, and a wide set of branch lengths values. emtree turns out to be the input method that performs best in most cases on this type of data. regardless of the quartet-based method chosen and the tree topology, emtree gives the best results for trees with large divergence among taxa .

summing up, an em approach on markov models provides an accurate 4-taxon tree reconstruction method suited for data not known to satisfy homogeneity and very useful as input of quartet-based methods, specially for largely divergent trees. however, the method presented here is not valid for data violating the i.i.d. hypotheses, such as data with variation across sites , or dependency among sites. the method should be strongly modified in order to accommodate these generalizations, and this might be an interesting future project.
