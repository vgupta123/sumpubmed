BACKGROUND
wheat  is a major staple crop for human diet. with the increase in global population, the shortage of food has become increasingly serious. therefore, improvement of wheat yield is vital for relieving food shortages. conventional breeding approaches via manipulation of genetic variation have been successful in improving the important agronomic traits of cereals; however, further wheat improvement requires deep understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control wheat growth and development  <cit> .

small rnas  have been found to control cellular metabolism, growth and differentiation, to maintain genome integrity, and to combat viruses and mobile genetics elements in eukaryotes  <cit> . according to the present knowledge, these regulatory srnas are classified into micrornas , short interfering rnas , and piwi-interacting rnas in metazoans. mirnas are produced from non-coding single-stranded rna precursors  that are transcribed by rna polymerase ii to generate an imperfect self-complementary, stem-loop secondary structure  <cit> . in higher plants, a pri-mirna is trimmed and spliced into an srna duplex consisting of an mirna and its complementary sequence  by dicer-like <dig>  with the help of the dsrna binding protein hyl <dig> and the dsrna methylase hen <dig>  <cit> . a mature mirna, which is typically  <dig> nt to  <dig> nt long, is incorporated in the rna-induced silencing complex to down-regulate the expression of its target genes in trans through a base pairing mechanism, whereas mirna* is assumed to be degraded  <cit> . mirnas display near-perfect complementarity to their target mrnas and interfere with target gene expression by mrna cleavage, which occurs at the 10th and 11th positions of mirnas, or by inhibition of translation in plants  <cit> . in plants, mirnas are the second most abundant srnas  <cit> , acting as powerful endogenous regulators. for example, many distinct mirnas target transcripts encoding for various transcription factors that control plant development and phase transition in arabidopsis <cit> , rice  <cit>  and maize  <cit> , whereas others are involved in biotic and abiotic stress responses  <cit> . the number of annotated mirnas in mirbase database has exponentially increased in recent years. to date,  <dig>  mirnas have been identified in the plant kingdom, and the information has been deposited in mirbase . however, most of these mirnas have been identified in plants whose whole genome sequences are available; some of these plants include oryza sativa , populus trichocarpa , arabidopsis thaliana , brachypodium distachyon  and zea mays . similar to many gene regulatory systems, mirnas are both conserved and diverse among plant lineages. some mirnas are conserved in angiosperms or even in embryophyta  <cit> , whereas others are species specific, reflecting their fast-evolving and functionally diverging nature  <cit> . recent studies have investigated the functions of mirnas in the seed development of various plants, such as arabidopsis <cit> , rice  <cit> , maize  <cit> , barley  <cit>  and wheat  <cit> . plants expressing the mir160-resistant auxin response factor  <dig>  may cause abnormal embryo symmetry  <cit> . mir <dig> regulates nac-domain target genes in arabidopsis, and perturbation of mir164-directed regulation causes developmental abnormalities in embryonic, vegetative and floral organs  <cit> . mirnas are involved in many regulatory pathways that control seed development in arabidopsis; therefore, loss-of-function mirna mutations may lead to developmental defects or death  <cit> . mir <dig> targets squamosa promoter-binding protein-like  <dig>  and spl <dig>  and the regulation of these targets prevents premature gene expression during early embryogenesis  <cit> . in barley, it was found that the regulatory functions of mirnas peak during the transition between the pre-storage and storage phases in seed development; mirnas regulate the development of cereal grain through phytohormone response pathways  <cit> . a recent study has found that mir <dig> overexpression improves rice yield by increasing grain size and promoting panicle branching  <cit> . therefore, understanding the involvement of mirnas in plant development is necessary to elucidate their functions in seed development and to promote yield improvement not only in rice but also in other cereal crops by manipulating related mirna genes.

to date, less than  <dig> mirnas have been identified in wheat,  <dig> of which have been registered in the mirbase/triticum aestivum   <cit> . considerable data are available on the mirnas involved in the development of rice, maize and barley. in contrast, little is known about the mirnas and their regulatory functions in the development of wheat. therefore, identification and functional analysis of mirnas in wheat are urgently needed.

wheat development is a complex event wherein the expansion and specialisation of different tissues are controlled by complicated interactions of signalling and gene regulation networks. the complex developmental events crucial to the development of a mature grain composed of the embryo, endosperm  and outside layer  take approximately 40 days-post-anthesis . grain development can be divided into three stages based on morphological changes and metabolite accumulation: pre-storage, storage  and desiccation  <cit> . the pre-storage phase corresponding to the first  <dig> dpa is featured by extensive mitotic activity in both embryo and endosperm. the transition to storage phase, characterised by dramatic transcriptional changes, occurs at  <dig> dpa to  <dig> dpa; this transition initiates the differentiation of tissues that will constitute the mature grain  <cit> . throughout the storage phase, which lasts up to approximately  <dig> dpa, aleurone and embryonic tissues acquire desiccation tolerance, whereas endosperm cells undergo endoreduplication and accumulate storage metabolites   <cit> . flag leaf is essential in wheat reproduction development because it contributes approximately 45% to 58% of the total photosynthetic activity  <cit>  and approximately 41% to 43% of the carbohydrates for grain filling  <cit> .

our long-term goal is to reveal the roles of mirnas in wheat development. the objective of this study is to systematically identify mirna species in wheat tissues during different developmental stages. to achieve this, we sequenced five srna libraries from wheat seedlings, flag leaves and immature seeds at  <dig> dpa ,  <dig> dpa  and  <dig> dpa , respectively, to identify the mirnas and understand their functions in wheat flag leaf and seed development. we identified known and novel mirnas based on the presence of their precursors in wheat est databases or wheat genome shotgun-sequence assemblies and their abundance as well as based on the detection of mirna*. we also predicated the potential targets for the identified mirnas and then analysed the expression of their profiles. this study is the first to provide useful information for uncovering the regulatory networks of mirnas in wheat flag leaves and developing seeds.

RESULTS
diverse srna population in different wheat tissues or developmental stages
all sequencing data were first processed by filtering adaptor sequences and removing low-quality reads, and reads with sequences larger than  <dig> nt and smaller than  <dig> nt using the soapnuke software  developed by bgia, and clean reads were generated for each srna library. identical reads were subsequently pooled to create a list of non-redundant sequences . a total of  <dig> , <dig> clean reads representing  <dig> , <dig> unique reads  <dig> nt to  <dig> nt long were obtained from deep sequencing of the five srna libraries . the number of unique reads increased in flag leaves and developing seeds of 5-d, 10-d and 20-d. this observation is consistent with a previous study, which found the increasing unique signatures in developing barley grain samples at  <dig> dpa to  <dig> dpa,  <dig> dpa to  <dig> dpa, and  <dig> dpa to  <dig> dpa  <cit> . these data suggest that wheat developing seeds have a more complex srna population than vegetative tissues.

only  <dig> , <dig> of the  <dig> , <dig> redundant reads  and  <dig> , <dig> of the  <dig> , <dig> unique reads  were matched perfectly to wheat genome shotgun-sequence assemblies  . the summary of srna sequencing in the five libraries or tissues is listed in additional file  <dig> 

we focused on the distribution of 18 nt to 26 nt reads in the five libraries or tissues because most of the srnas with known functions are 20 nt to 24 nt long. the size distribution patterns of the srna reads in the five wheat tissues suggest a distinct srna population in a particular wheat tissue or developmental stage . in the seedlings, the most abundant srna reads were 24 nt long , followed by reads of 21 nt long , the typical length of canonical mirnas . these results are consistent with previous findings in arabidopsis <cit> , rice  <cit> , soybean  <cit>  and apple  <cit> . however, srna reads from flag leaves were characterised with  <dig>   <dig> and 20 nt  as the major size classes . the distribution of srna reads from flag leaves is similar to what has been observed in a previous study  <cit> . srnas with different sizes perform different functions. for example, post-transcriptional gene silencing is usually mediated by 21 nt srnas, whereas gene silencing mediated by rna-dependent dna methylation and heterochromatin maintenance are usually performed by 24 nt srnas  <cit> .

the srna reads from the 5-d, 10-d and 20-d seeds shared similar size distribution patterns, with  <dig> nt as the dominant class of srnas . the frequencies of  <dig> reads decreased from the 5-d seeds to the 20-d seeds, while  <dig> nt increased. this result is in agreement with previous data on the early development of barley seed samples at  <dig> dpa to  <dig> dpa,  <dig> dpa to  <dig> dpa, and  <dig> dpa to  <dig> dpa  <cit> . however, if unique sequences are considered,  <dig> nt reads composed the predominant class of srnas  in all the five libraries or tissues, as compared with the  <dig> to  <dig> nt reads  . the five srna libraries shared less than  <dig> % of the  <dig> nt srnas and less than  <dig> % of the  <dig> nt srnas, indicating diverse srna populations in the tested tissues. overall, these results indicate that distinct pools of srna work in different wheat tissues or developmental stages.

characterization of highly to moderately conserved known mirnas
in this study, srna reads with sequence similarity above 90% to rrnas, trnas, snrnas and snornas were removed by blastn alignment against the data deposited in rfam  <dig>  , and unique srna sequences perfectly matched to wheat genome shotgun-sequence assemblies were aligned to known plant mirnas in mirbase . as a result,  <dig> known mirnas representing  <dig> mirna families were identified from  <dig> mirna loci in wheat . of these  <dig> known mirnas,  <dig>  have been registered in mirbase/triticum aestivum , and the remaining  <dig>  were first identified in wheat in the present study . among the  <dig> known mirnas ,  <dig> pairs are mirna/mirna*. in the present study, these known mirnas/families were sorted into two categories: highly conserved mirnas and moderately conserved mirnas. the former mirnas are conserved in all three dicots  and three monocots  whose genome sequences are available; the latter mirnas are only conserved in some of these plant species, but not in the all six plant species described above . of the  <dig> known mirna families ,  <dig>  are highly conserved and  <dig>  are moderately conserved .

the abundance of these known mirnas, as reflected in normalised reads , was further compared in this study. the highly conserved mirnas or families showed significant variation among the families in all the five tissues . the highest read abundance  was detected in the mir <dig> family and was  <dig>  to  <dig> times more abundant than the other mirna families, including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  whose abundance ranged from about  <dig>  rpm to  <dig>  rpm . although low expression  was observed for both mir <dig> and mir <dig> families, their expression level was still about  <dig> to  <dig> times greater than any of the  <dig> remaining highly conserved mirna families . similarly, the two moderately conserved mirna families exhibited great variation in abundance between the families . variation in expression levels of different mirna species was also found in other plant species, such as grapevine  <cit>  and apple  <cit> .

novel mirna species in wheat
srna reads with no sequence similarity to known mirnas were further analyzed for potential new mirna species. these unique sequences with  <dig> to  <dig> nt were analyzed against wheat est database  or wheat genome shotgun-sequence assemblies . the est sequences or the contigs from the wheat genome shotgun-sequence assemblies that matched to the srna reads were extracted from the databases and analyzed for the existence of pre-mirna sequences that can form a hairpin secondary structure using mirna prediction software mireap , the potential new mirnas predicted meeting the common criteria . then, novel mirnas were further identified based on both their abundance  and the detection of mirna*s, because accumulations of mirna*s are strong supporting evidence for the cleavage by dcls to produce functional mature mirnas during mirna biogenesis in plants  <cit> . a total of  <dig> novel mirnas corresponding to  <dig> precursors which can form qualified secondary structures were identified in the present study , and of which,  <dig> mature mirna sequences were previously described in wheat  <cit> . the detailed information of all the  <dig> novel mirnas, including the pre-mirna sequences and the structures, the loci of the mature mirna sequences and their mirna*s, and the alignments of all novel mirnas to their precursor sequences, were shown in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  while,  <dig> mirnas with abundance more than  <dig> rpm in at least one of the five tissues tested but without mirna*s detected were identified as candidate mirnas , their loci, pre-mirna sequences and structures, and reads in deep sequencing were also list in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  a recent review  <cit>  has reported that  <dig> % of the known mirnas in wheat begin with a 5′ uridine and that  <dig> % are  <dig> nt long; these properties are typical in mirnas from other species  <cit> . in the present study,  <dig> %  of the novel mirnas started with a u at their 5′-end, and that  <dig> %  are  <dig> nt long . as been found in arabidopsis and apple, new species-specific mirnas are young mirnas that have recently evolved and are often expressed at a lower level than conserved mirnas  <cit> . this observation is also true for most of the  <dig> novel mirnas identified in the present study .

target gene prediction for novel mirnas
to understand the functions of the novel mirnas identified, the putative targets of these mirnas were predicted by using a web-based psrna target program  with default parameters given in the methods section. thirty-seven of the  <dig> novel mirnas  had predicted targets that met the criteria . according to the data in mirbase,  <dig> of the  <dig>  wheat mirnas have predicted targets, which is a little more than our result. as shown in additional file  <dig>  the predicted targets included transcript factors, protein kinases, enzymes, cellular components, receptors and transporters involved in multiple cellular processes, indicating the extensive functions of mirnas in gene regulation networks. for example, seed-specific tae-mir1127b which were only present in developing seed  targeted riboflavin biosynthesis protein rib gene/amino acid permease gene, which function in seed development  <cit> . this result is consistent with its functions reported earlier. seed-specific tae-mir <dig> and tae-mir <dig> targeted zinc finger transcription factor-like protein and f-box domain containing protein, respectively . these genes have important functions throughout plant development  <cit> .

preferential expression of different mirna species in specific wheat tissues
knowledge about the temporal and spatial expression of mirnas might provide clues on where these mirnas function. in the present study, the availability of the five srna datasets from the seedlings, flag leaves, 5-d seeds, 10-d seeds and 20-d seeds of wheat provided an opportunity to compare the expression profiles of these mirnas in different tissues and developmental stages. the datasets from solexa sequencing indicated that the majority of the mirnas including the known and the novel mirnas showed different levels of tissue-biased expression with logarithm  of the fold changes of − <dig>  ~  <dig>  for the known mirnas and − <dig>  ~  <dig>  for the novel mirnas , whereas the fold change was the ratio of abundance of a mirna or family in flag leaves, 5-d seeds, 10-d seeds or 20-d seeds, to abundance of the same mirna or family in seedlings.

the expression levels of randomly selected representative mirna species in the five tissues were further determined through quantitative real-time rt-pcr  using ubq as the internal reference gene. the ubq gene was confirmed to be relatively stable in the tested wheat tissues . results showed that the relative abundance of almost all the mirnas determined by qpcr followed similar trends as the read numbers in the libraries . however, we also observed a discrepancy between the qpcr and the sequencing data for novel mirna tae-mir1127b , which was expressed at extremely low level in the tissues tested . this difference might be ascribed to biases introduced to the very low abundant mirna in some rna samples when polyadenylation and reverse-transcription were performed with poly  adapters into cdnas using an mirna cdna synthesis kit . thus, the mirnas’ cdnas used for qpcr contained biases. biases could have also been introduced in the sequences of some samples during library generation or sequencing. a contradiction between in vivo rna levels and sequencing results for mirnas was also reported in grapevine  <cit>  and apple  <cit> . further analysis showed that a very significant correlation exists between the sequencing and the qpcr data  , suggesting that the sequencing results are reliable.

therefore, the expression patterns of all the known and the novel mirnas identified were profiled based on their sequencing results. most of the known and the novel mirnas showed various degrees of tissue-biased expression in the flag leaves or developing seeds, with the logarithm of the fold changes between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . of the  <dig> known mirna families,  <dig>  were preferentially expressed in the developing seeds  . from  <dig> dpa to  <dig> dpa, mir <dig> and mir <dig> increased in abundance, whereas mir <dig> decreased . this result suggests that these mirnas might have coordinating functions in different developmental stages of wheat seed. the potential targets of these known mirnas were predicted . the expression patterns of these mirnas were closely related to their functions. mir <dig> and mir <dig> targeted auxin response factor  and nac transcription factor , respectively , which control key steps in plant development. auxin is crucial in seed development processes, including pattern formation, cell division and cell expansion  <cit> . plants expressing the mir160-resistant arf <dig> may cause abnormal embryo symmetry  <cit> . nac genes have important functions in developmental processes, such as auxin signalling and defence  <cit> . a recent research has revealed that nac genes that regulate senescence improve protein, zinc, and iron contents in wheat grain  <cit> . in the present study, the expression level of mir <dig> increased with wheat grain development, from  <dig> rpm in the 5-d seeds to more than  <dig> rpm in the 10-d and 20-d seeds . this result is consistent with the previously reported functions of mir <dig>  mir <dig> targets a ccaat-box transcription factor, which is involved in diverse processes, such as embryo development, flowering time control and root development  <cit> . the decreased abundance of mir <dig> from the 5-d seeds to the 20-d seeds was coordinated with its functions in seed development. of the  <dig> novel mirnas,  <dig> showed preferential expression in the different developmental stages of wheat seed , with the logarithm of the fold change of  <dig>  ~  <dig> , and half of these mirnas  were seed specific . this result suggests that these novel mirnas might participate in regulating wheat seed development and metabolism. the predicted targets for these seed-specific mirnas included transcript factors, enzymes, nucleosome/chromatin assembly factor, ribosome recycling factor and cellular components , indicating the extensive functions of mirnas in wheat seed development. for examples, tae-mir9657a, with an increasing abundance from the 5-d seeds to the 20-d seeds, targets a nucleosome/chromatin assembly factor which is essential for dna replication during cell proliferation. tae-mir1127b which increased in abundance from the 5-d seeds to the 20-d seeds targets an amino acid permease gene, which is important for early seed development and plays a crucial for the uptake of amino acids into the endosperm and supplying amino acids for the developing embryo during early embryogenesis  <cit> . while, tae-mir <dig>  with a decreasing expression pattern from the 5-d seeds to the 20-d seeds, targets a f-box domain containing protein in wheat . this result is in accordance with a previous report that f-box protein-encoding genes showed different transcript levels during seed development, suggesting the involvement of f-box proteins in rice seed development  <cit> .

of the  <dig> known mirna families,  <dig>  showed different levels of preferential expression in wheat flag leaves, with the logarithm of the fold changes ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  as well as more than those in the developing seeds . putative targets of these mirnas encode a wide range of proteins, including various transcription factors, enzymes and argonaute  protein , which are involved in diverse developmental and metabolic processes. of the  <dig> novel mirnas,  <dig> were characterised to have different degrees of flag leaf-biased expression, with the logarithm of the fold changes ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , whereas  <dig>  were detected only in flag leaves , suggesting that these novel mirnas might participate in regulating the development and metabolism in wheat flag leaves. fourteen of the  <dig> novel mirnas with flag leaf-biased expression had putative targets, including protein kinases, glycosyltransferase, functional proteins , and enzymes , all of which are important in plant signalling pathway and metabolism. the above results imply that the regulation networks of mirnas in wheat flag leaves are very complex. overall, all our data suggested that wheat flag leaves have more complicated regulatory networks of mirnas than developing seeds.

to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to identify mirnas with tissue-biased expression in wheat flag leaves or seeds of different developmental stage on a large scale. sufficient wheat genome sequence data are necessary to elucidate the functions of all mirnas preferentially expressed in wheat flag leaves or developing seeds and to reveal the involved regulatory networks.

mirna*s accumulation in specific wheat tissues
mirna:mirna* is excised by dcl <dig> to produce functional mature mirna, whereas mirna* is assumed to be gradually degraded during mirna biogenesis  <cit> . however, previous studies have also suggested that mirna*s can accumulate to a considerable level and down-regulate their target genes in both plants and animals  <cit> . evidence supporting mirna*-mediated mrna cleavage has been recently found in medicagotruncatula and maize  <cit> . in the present study,  <dig> mirna*s for known mature mirnas registered in the mirbase/tricum aestivum  were detected in at least one of the five libraries or tissues tested . about half of these mirna*s had relatively high tissue-biased accumulation in the developing seeds, flag leaves, or seedling. for examples, the reads of mir171b* in the 5-d, 10-d and 20-d seeds were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, which are considerably higher than those in the seedlings  and flag leaves  . the highest accumulation of mir1127* was observed in the flag leaves , followed by the 20-d seeds . only  <dig> and  <dig> reads were detected in the seedlings and 5-d seeds, respectively. the highest level of mir169* was observed in the seedlings , followed by the flag leaves . however, mature mirna sequences for mir171b*, mir1127* and mir169* were not found in any of the five tissues tested. these results suggested that mir171b*, mir1127* and mir169* might be de facto mirnas with important regulatory functions in specific tissues and developmental stages. among the  <dig> mirna*s detected,  <dig> had no mature mirna sequences detected in the five libraries .

the differential accumulation of mirnas and mirna*s in specific tissues may be attributed to the different activities of proteins involved in srna biogenesis. different ago proteins in arabidopsis harbour srnas with different 5′-terminal nucleotides; thus, mirnas and mirna*s are directed in different ago complexes  <cit> . a recent study revealed that different ago-coding genes in rice have different levels of tissue-biased expression  <cit> . in the present study, mir <dig>  which targets an ago-coding gene  and is the most abundant mirna or family in the five srna libraries, exhibited a tissue-preferential expression, with the highest read number in the flag leaves .

CONCLUSIONS
five srna libraries from wheat seedlings, flag leaves, 5-d, 10-d and 20-d seeds were sequenced in this study. twenty-four known mirnas belonging to  <dig> mirna families were identified from  <dig> mirna loci in wheat, including  <dig>  first identified in wheat in the present study,  <dig> mirna families  being highly conserved and  <dig>  moderately conserved. in addition, fifty-five novel mirnas were also identified. the potential target genes for  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas were predicted using strict criteria, and these target genes are involved in a wide range of biological functions. four of the  <dig> known mirna families, including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were preferentially expressed in the developing seeds with the logarithm of the fold changes of  <dig>  ~  <dig> . from  <dig> days post-anthesis to  <dig> days post-anthesis, mir <dig> and mir <dig> increased in abundance, whereas mir <dig> decreased, suggesting that these mirnas have coordinating functions in the different developmental stages of wheat seed. twenty-two of the  <dig> novel mirnas also preferentially expressed in the different developmental stages of wheat seed with the logarithm of the fold change of  <dig>  ~  <dig> , and half of them were seed-specific, suggesting that they participate in regulating wheat seed development and metabolism. eight known mirna families and  <dig> novel mirnas exhibited different levels of tissue-biased expression in wheat flag leaves, with the logarithm of the fold changes ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the potential targets of these mirnas were involved in a wide range of biological functions, suggesting the complexity of the regulatory networks in this tissue. our data also suggested that wheat flag leaves have more complicated regulatory networks of mirna than developing seeds.

sufficient wheat genome sequence annotation data are necessary to identify all mirnas and their regulatory functions. our dataset provides a useful source of information on mirna regulation in wheat flag leaves and developing seeds.
