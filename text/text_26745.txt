BACKGROUND
rhizospheric rhizobia are subjected to fluctuating osmotic, heat and drought stresses due to the succession of drought and rain periods, the exclusion of salts like nacl from root tissues, the release of plant exudates, or the production of exopolymers by plant roots and other rhizobacteria. in addition, rhizobia must also adapt to osmotic and oxidative stresses during the infection process and in a nodule exchanging nutrients with the host plant. on the other hand, drought stress is particularly important when rhizobia are used as inoculants for legumes, since it affects cell viability during storage in carrier-based  inoculants
 <cit> . therefore, besides symbiotic efficiency, improvement of survival of rhizobia under conditions of the above abiotic constraints may constitute a competitive trait for either native or inoculant rhizobia, to persist in soil and solid inoculant formulations, and to improve the colonization and/or infection process. the responses to osmotic, drought and heat stress in bacteria involve very complex adaptation mechanisms, but one common element of the three responses is the synthesis of protectant molecules named compatible solutes
 <cit> . indeed, the role of compatible solutes goes beyond osmotic adjustment alone to protection of cells and cell components from freezing, desiccation, high temperature, and oxygen radicals, as well as to serve as sources of carbon, energy and nitrogen
 <cit> .

trehalose  has been found as the main compatible solute in almost any rhizobial strain tested so far, and its accumulation has been detected in free-living cells, bacteroids, and nodules
 <cit> . trehalose accumulation by r. leguminosarum bv trifolii and sinorhizobium meliloti reaches its maximal levels at stationary phase of growth
 <cit> . out of the five different routes known for trehalose biosynthesis, three pathways have been found in rhizobia. first, the otsa-otsb route, which is very well conserved among insects, plants, fungi and bacteria, involves the transfer of glucose from udp-glucose to glucose-phosphate to form trehalose-6-phosphate by trehalose-6-phosphate synthase . then, a trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase  dephosphorylates this intermediate to produce trehalose
 <cit> . second, trehalose synthase , first described in mycobacteria
 <cit> , catalyzes the reversible conversion of maltose and trehalose. in the case of bradyrhizobium japonicum, trehalose is accumulated to a greater extent in a tres mutant, suggesting that tres is involved in trehalose degradation to maltose
 <cit> . a third pathway first discovered in rhizobium sp. m-11
 <cit>  and the archaeon sulfolobus acidocaldarius <cit> , converts the terminal unit of a linear maltodextrin  to trehalose via maltooligosyl trehalose synthase, encoded by trey, and maltooligosyl trehalose trehalohydrolase .

apart from stress protectant, trehalose also serves as a carbon and energy source for many bacteria, including rhizobia. in soil, trehalose originates from nodules during nodule senescence
 <cit>  and as an excretion product from fungi
 <cit> . there are several known pathways for trehalose catabolism in microorganisms. the major enzyme involved in the turnover of trehalose, trehalase , usually belongs to families  <dig> and  <dig> of glycoside hydrolases
 <cit> . in other cases, trehalose degradation involves a trehalose phosphorylase 
 <cit> . degradation of trehalose-6-phosphate can be mediated by a trehalose 6-phosphate hydrolase , belonging to family  <dig> of glycoside hydrolases
 <cit> , or a trehalose-6-phosphate phosphorylase 
 <cit> .trehalase, trehalose phosphorylase, and trehalose-6-phosphate hydrolase were detected in soybean nodules formed by b. japonicum <cit> , but orthologous genes for these enzymes were not found in the genome of s. meliloti <cit> . in the former species, two abc transport systems , and one major catabolic pathway  have been reported for trehalose
 <cit> .

in rhizobia, the effect of trehalose accumulation on tolerance to osmotic and drought stress, as well as symbiotic performance, appears to be dependent on the particular stress, the rhizobial species, and the host genotype. regarding osmotic stress, otsab seems to play a major role in trehalose accumulation under hyperosmotic conditions, and it is the main system involved in osmoadaptation of s. meliloti <cit>  and b. japonicum <cit> . in addition, accumulated trehalose seems to have a major role in protecting b. japonicum <cit>  and r. leguminosarum bv trifolii <cit>  against desiccation stress. with respect to symbiotic phenotype, in b. japonicum trehalose accumulation is involved in the development of symbiotic nitrogen-fixing root nodules on soybean plants
 <cit> . in contrast, in other rhizobia such as r. leguminosarum bv trifolii or s. meliloti, trehalose accumulation has been proposed to be important only for competitiveness
 <cit> . the role of trehalose as thermoprotectant has been established in yeast
 <cit>  and bacteria such as e. coli <cit> , salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium
 <cit>  or the halophilic bacterium chromohalobacter salexigens <cit> . however the role of trehalose in protection against heat stress in rhizobia has not yet been investigated.

common bean  is an important crop in the diet of people of latin america. in this region, it is mainly nodulated by r. etli <cit> . the complete genome sequence of r. etli cfn  <dig> has been reported 
 <cit> . it contains more replicons  than any other completely sequenced nitrogen-fixing bacterium, but several pieces of evidence suggest an exogenous origin for plasmids p42a and p42d

suarez and co-workers
 <cit>  reported an otsa mutant still capable of accumulating trehalose to a certain extent, which was nevertheless osmosensitive and displayed reduced nodulation and lower nitrogenase activity, and consequently reduced plan biomass. in contrast, an otsa overexpressing r. etli strain showed increased trehalose content and was more tolerant to osmotic stress than the wild-type. bean plants inoculated with the otsa overexpressing strain showed improved nodulation and nitrogen fixation, and increased drought tolerance. in addition, transcriptomic analysis of plant nodules in symbiosis with the otsa overexpressing strain revealed induction of several genes involved in stress tolerance, and carbon and nitrogen metabolism, suggesting that trehalose  plays a role as a signal molecule from rhizobia to the legume nodule
 <cit> .

whereas increased trehalose levels in r. etli inoculant strains seem to favor drought tolerance of the host legume, the involvement of trehalose in desiccation tolerance of r. etli free-living cells has not been investigated. in this work, we address the role of trehalose in heat and desiccation tolerance of this soil bacterium. based on genome analysis, we reconstructed the r. etli trehalose metabolism, and found evidence for a horizontal transfer origin of the otsa copy located in plasmid p42a. in addition, we showed that inactivation of the chromosomal copy of otsa  completely abolishes trehalose synthesis by r. etli in mannitol minimal medium. finally, we showed an important role for trehalose in thermoprotection and desiccation tolerance of r. etli free-living cells.

extraction and determination of intracellular trehalose content
trehalose determination was performed basically as described by blazquez et al.
 <cit>  by the following procedure. for free-living cells, pellets from  <dig> ml of early stationary phase cultures in b-medium were washed with isotonic carbon-free medium and resuspended in  <dig> ml of the same medium. cells were lysed by  <dig> min of incubation at 95°c and, after centrifugation, the supernatant was used to determine the trehalose content in a total volume reaction of  <dig> μl containing  <dig> μl of the supernatant,  <dig> μl of  <dig> mm sodium acetate buffer  and  <dig>  u of trehalase . for each sample, endogenous glucose was monitored by performing a parallel reaction in which trehalase was substituted by water. after overnight incubation at 37°c, the glucose released by trehalose hydrolysis was determined by adding  <dig> μl of the previous reaction to  <dig> μl of a mixture of  <dig>  mg ml-1aspergillus niger glucose oxidase ,  <dig>  mg ml- <dig> horseradish peroxidase in  <dig>  m phosphate buffer, ph  <dig>  , and  <dig> μl of  <dig>  mg ml- <dig> o-toluidine . after  <dig> min of incubation at 37°c,  <dig>  ml of water was added to the samples and absorption was measured at  <dig> nm in a perkin elmer lambda  <dig> uv/vis spectrophotometer. values were compared to those obtained from stock solutions of glucose standards in a concentration range of  <dig> to  <dig> μgml- <dig>  finally, trehalose content was calculated from the glucose content by performing a standard curve with commercial trehalose  ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> mm. trehalose concentration was expressed as μmol mg protein- <dig>  nodules were fractionated into bacteroids and nodule cytosol as described by delgado et al.
 <cit> . trehalose content was determined colorimetrically as described above.

determination of protein content
the same cultures were used for determination of both trehalose and protein content.  <dig> ml aliquots were taken at early stationary phase and cell protein content was determined in triplicate by using a bicinchoninic acid  proteinassay kit  as described by garcía-estepa et al.
 <cit> .

RESULTS
trehalose synthesis by r.etli is triggered mainly by salinity stress
heat stress induces accumulation of trehalose in yeasts
 <cit>  and bacteria such as e. coli <cit>  or salmonella typhi serovar typhimurium
 <cit> . in rhizobia, including r. etli <cit> , trehalose synthesis has been shown to be stimulated by salinity, but its role against heat stress has not been yet tested. in this study, we compared the influence of salinity and high temperature on growth and trehalose accumulation in r. etli. for this purpose, r. etli wild-type strain was grown up to early stationary phase in b-minimal medium alone or with  <dig>  m nacl, at 28°c and 35°c, and trehalose content was determined colorimetrically as described in materials and methods. as shown in figure
 <dig>  osmotic stress alone caused a delayed growth, but high temperature alone did not influence growth of r. etli. however, growth of cells subjected to both stresses was more impaired than that of cells grown under osmotic stress alone, showing an attenuated exponential phase, and reaching final o.d <dig> values below  <dig> . as shown in figure
 <dig>  under non stress conditions, trehalose levels in r. etli were below  <dig>  μmol/mg protein. to determine trehalose content in response to high temperature stress, we compared the accumulation of trehalose at 28°c and 35°c in cells grown without nacl added. under these conditions, trehalose accumulation by r. etli cells increased by  <dig> -fold, but trehalose levels remained very low. however, a pronounced response in trehalose accumulation was observed due to salinity stress at both temperatures. thus, trehalose levels in cells grown in minimal medium with  <dig>  m nacl at 28°c and 35°c were  <dig> - and  <dig> - higher, respectively, than trehalose levels in cells grown in minimal medium without nacl added. these data suggest that, although temperature stress alone induces some trehalose synthesis by r. etli, trehalose biosynthesis in this microorganism is mainly triggered by osmotic stress. 

genomic analysis of trehalose metabolism in r. etli
trehalose synthesis and catabolism have proven to be relevant for the symbiotic performance of rhizobia
 <cit> . to get an overview of the metabolism of trehalose in r. etli, we inspected its genome for genes involved in trehalose synthesis, transport and degradation. genes for trehalose metabolism were scattered among the chromosome and plasmids a, c, e, and f . as suggested by suarez et al.
 <cit>  putative genes encoding the three so far known trehalose synthesis pathways in rhizobia  are present in r. etli. first, genes encoding trehalose synthesis from glucose polymers were found in plasmid p42e , and the chromosome and plasmid p42f . second, two genes encoding a putative trehalose synthase  were found in the chromosome and plasmid p42f. the product of the chromosomal putative tres gene presented similar length and significant sequence identity to known trehalose synthases from bacteria, but the product of the plasmid f-borne tres-like gene carried an additional domain of unknown function .third, two genes were annotated as otsa, one located in the chromosome  and one in plasmid p42a . both products showed homology to trehalose 6-phosphate synthases from other rhizobia, but the identity was much higher for otsach. in addition, a gene annotated as otsb was located in plasmid c. as trehalose is synthesized by r. etli from mannitol , we searched for genes involved in mannitol transport and conversion into glucose. the genome of r. etli does not encode a specific mannitol phosphotransferase, suggesting that mannitol does not use this system to enter the cell. instead, we found smoefgk , mtlk , and xyla . since b- does not contain ammonium, the most plausible route for glutamate biosynthesis from mannitol is through the enzyme glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase, which converts d-fructose-6-phosphate and l-glutamine into d-glucosamine-6-phosphate and l-glutamate. two copies of the encoding gene  were found in r. etli chromosome . a previous study suggested that r. etli can degrade trehalose
 <cit> . therefore, we also looked for genes involved in uptake and degradation of trehalose. we did not find a trehalose phosphotransferase system  for the uptake of trehalose, but two putative abc uptake systems homologous to those operating in s. meliloti <cit>  were found that might be involved in the uptake of trehalose, sucrose, and/or maltose. these were encoded in plasmid p42f , and the chromosome . regarding trehalose degradation, neither e. coli trea- or tref- like genes for periplasmic or cytoplasmic trehalases, respectively, nor genes belonging to glycoside hydrolase family  <dig> trehalases
 <cit> , were found in the r. etli genome. however, orthologs to the thuab genes, which encode the major pathway for trehalose catabolism in s. meliloti <cit> , were found in the chromosome and plasmid p42f. in addition, three copies of trec, encoding putative trehalose-6-phosphate hydrolases, were identified in the chromosome. all three trec proteins belonged to the family  <dig> of glycoside hydrolases
 <cit> , but they did not cluster together . the metabolism of trehalose in r. etli inferred from its genome sequence is summarized in figure
 <dig>  

phylogenetic analysis of the two r. etli trehalose-6-phosphate synthases
as two copies of otsa  were encoded by the r. etli genome, we investigated their phylogenetic relationship. first we aligned the amino acid sequences of both r. etli otsa proteins with the sequences of characterized trehalose-6-p- synthases, and compared motifs involved in enzyme activity. all residues corresponding to the active site determined in the best studied e. coli trehalose-6-p synthase
 <cit>  were conserved in r. etli otsach and otsaa . however, the identity between both proteins was only of 48%, and the gene otsaa was flanked by putative insertion sequences in the r. etli genome. in addition, the otsach copy and r. etli genome had a similar codon use, whereas the otsaa copy showed a different preference for stop codon, and codons for amino acids as ala, arg, gln, ile,leu, phe, ser, thr, and val. these findings suggested that otsaa might have been acquired by horizontal transfer. to check this hypothesis, we constructed a phylogenetic tree with sequences of proteobacterial otsa proteins available in the data bases, including otsas from r. etli and other rhizobia like r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii <cit> , s.meliloti <cit> , and b. japonicum <cit> . as shown in figure
3b, the resulting phylogenetic tree showed four separated branches, with a generally homogeneous distribution of phylogenetic groups. the first branch was formed by otsa proteins from β- and γ -proteobacteria, including otsa from e. coli and salmonella enterica. the second cluster was mainly composed of otsa proteins from γ-proteobacteria, including some halophilic representatives such as c. salexigens and halorhodospira halophila. the third branch grouped otsas from α-proteobacteria, including the two r. etli otsa proteins. whereas r. etli otsach grouped with otsas from r. leguminosarum, s. meliloti, rhizobium sp. ngr <dig> and agrobacterium vitis, r. etli otsaa constituted a separated sub-group within the α-proteobacterial branch. the fourth branch was composed by otsa proteins from δ-protobacteria. some incongruences were found, as b. japonicum and mesorhizobium proteins did not clustered with otsa proteins from other rhizobia. in summary, this phylogenetic analysis supports the hypothesis that otsaa was transferred to r. etli or its ancestor from a related α-proteobacteria, which did not belong to the rhizobium/agrobacterium group. 

inactivation of r. etli otsach totally suppresses trehalose synthesis from mannitol
from the above phylogenetic analysis, otsach was chosen as the most promising candidate to encode a functional trehalose-6-p-synthase. to check this, the corresponding mutant  was constructed by insertion of an omega cassette within otsach , followed by double recombination in the chromosome of the wild-type strain. then, we used natural abundance 13c-nmr to determine the compatible solute pool of wild type and otsach cells grown at 28°c in  <dig>  m nacl b- medium up to early-stationary phase. as shown in figure
4a, the 13c-nmr spectrum of r. etli wild-type strain contained three sets of chemical shifts, which were assigned to trehalose , mannitol  and glutamate . although13c-nmr is only a semi-quantitative technique, it was evident that trehalose levels were much higher than those of mannitol and glutamate, suggesting that trehalose is the major compatible solute of r. etli under these conditions. mannitol was absent when glucose was used as a sole carbon source , indicating that it was accumulated by r. etli after its uptake from the external medium. chemical shifts corresponding to trehalose were not present in the spectrum of the r. etli otsach strain, where only signals corresponding to mannitol were detected . from these results, we conclude that the product encoded by otsach is involved in trehalose synthesis in r. etli. moreover, at least under the conditions tested, the otsaa copy does not seem to be functional.

trehalose synthesis mediated by otsach is essential for thermoprotection of r. etli
we investigated the effect of a mutation in otsach on r. etli heat tolerance. for this purpose, we compared the growth of wild-type and otsach strains in minimal medium b- under different combinations of osmotic  and heat  stresses. as previously described , at optimal temperature , the wild-type strain grew optimally without nacl added. at higher salinities , wild-type cells showed a delayed growth, but eventually they reached a stationary phase with absorbance values comparable to those of cultures without nacl .

interestingly, otsach cells grown at 28°c with mannitol showed a biphasic pattern, which was independent of the nacl concentration, although cells exposed to osmotic stress were more affected than cells grown without nacl. the first stage consisted of an attenuated exponential phase of  <dig> h  followed by  <dig> h of arrested growth with od <dig> values of around  <dig>  units. in the second one, growth was restarted, showing a second exponential phase during  <dig> h, followed by a second stationary phase with absorbance values comparable to those of the wild type strain . as in otsach cells collected at the beginning of the first stationary phase , trehalose was absent from extracts prepared from samples harvested at the entrance of this second stationary phase. instead, they contained large amounts of glutamate . however, when glucose and trehalose were used as the sole carbon source, this biphasic pattern of growth was not observed. growth of the otsach strain with both carbon sources was delayed with respect to the wild-type strain, even in the absence of osmotic stress .

at 35°c, r. etli wild-type strain was able to grow well in b- medium with nacl concentrations ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  m. as described above , growth of the wild type was impaired at 35°c with  <dig>  m nacl, showing absorbance values not exceeding  <dig>  unit of od <dig>  at this temperature, growth of the otsa mutant was severely affected, regardless of the salinity of the culture medium, with cultures showing od <dig> around  <dig>  od units. the above data suggest that trehalose is essential for growth of r. etli at high temperature.

osmotically induced trehalose synthesis improves desiccation tolerance in r. etli
involvement of trehalose in desiccation tolerance in rhizobia has been firmly established in r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii <cit> . on the other hand, in s. meliloti <cit>  or rhizobia nodulating acacia <cit> , desiccation tolerance was stimulated by osmotic and/or temperature pre-treatment. to check the influence of trehalose on desiccation tolerance of r. etli, wild type and otsach strains were grown at 28°c in minimal medium b-alone or additioned with  <dig>  m nacl, and harvested at early stationary phase. for cell drying, we used two variants of the protocol described by manzanera et al. for e. coli <cit> , a drying process  or a drying + high temperature process .

in the absence of osmotic stress, both wild type and otsach strains showed survival levels under  <dig> %, regardless of the drying protocol . in contrast, wild type cells osmotically pre-conditioned by the presence of  <dig>  m nacl showed ca. 35% survival levels after drying, although viability after  <dig> days storage dropped down to  <dig> % . compared to the drying treatment, the drying + high temperature protocol did not enhance wild type cell survival . the same drying experiments were performed with trehalose-deficient  cells harvested at early stationary phase. regardless of the protocol used, the otsach strain showed ca 3-fold lower survival levels than the wild type strain after the drying process, and a null viability after  <dig> days storage. these findings suggested  a beneficial effect of osmotic stress in r. etli tolerance to desiccation, and  a role of trehalose on desiccation tolerance in r. etli.

symbiotic phenotype of the r. etli otsach mutant
to analyze if the otsach mutation modifies the capacity of r. etli to fix nitrogen in symbiosis, common bean plants were inoculated with r. etli wild-type and the otsach strain. after inoculation, plants were grown under optimal  or water deficit conditions and were evaluated for nodulation, plant dry weight, total nitrogen content, nitrogenase activity, and leghaemoglobin content of the nodules. plant water status during the different treatments was monitored by measuring water potential  of the first fully expanded leaf. water potential in plants subjected to drought stress by holding irrigation for  <dig> days reached values of about −1 ±  <dig>  mpa . when irrigation was stop for  <dig> days, leaf Ψw reached values of about −2 ±  <dig>  mpa . the control plants maintained a leaf Ψw of −1 ±  <dig>  mpa. the effect of either moderate or severe drought stress in leaf Ψw of plants inoculated with the otsach mutant was similar to that of plants inoculated with the wild type .

independently of the plant treatment, no significant differences were observed in nodulation, plant growth parameters, and nitrogen fixation parameters among plants inoculated with any of the strains . a moderate drought did not affect nodules number , nodule dry weight , plant dry weight , and total nitrogen content  of plants inoculated with either the wild-type or the otsach strain . specific nitrogenase activity expressed as acetylene reduction activity  and leghaemoglobin  content of the nodules as an estimation of nodule functionality were also measured. regardless of the plant treatment, inoculation of plants with the otsach mutant did not affect significantly ara or lb content compared to those plants inoculated with the wild-type strain .

nodules number , nodule dry weight , plant dry weight , total nitrogen content , acetylene reduction activity ,leghaemoglobin , and trehalose  in bacteroids  and nodule cytosol   content in nodules and plants subjected or not  to moderate or severe drought conditions. values in a column followed by the same lower-case letter are not significantly different as determined by the tukey hsd test at p ≤  <dig>  .

nd. not detected.

as shown in table
 <dig>  nn and ndw per plant was negatively affected by a severe drought since a decrease of about 45% and 53% in those parameters was observed in plants inoculated with the wild-type strain compared to control plants. a similar decrease of nn  and ndw  was observed in plants subjected to a severe stress and inoculated with the otsach mutant compared to control plants . after a severe drought, a 53% and 49% reduction of pdw was observed in plants inoculated with the wild-type or the otsach mutant, respectively. plants inoculated with any of the strains and subjected to severe drought showed a similar reduction of about 30% in tn compared to control plants . plants inoculated with the wild-type strain and subjected to severe drought showed an inhibition of ara of about 36% compared to control plants. this activity was similarly dropped in nodules produced by the otsach mutant under severe drought  . a severe drought provoked a significant decline in lb content of about 35% in plants inoculated with the wild-type strain compared to control plants likewise, this parameter was also reduced of about 39% in plants inoculated with the otsach mutant and subjected to a severe drought . finally, trehalose content in bacteroids of the wild type and otsach strains was similar, regardless of the treatment, suggesting that under symbiotic conditions  other trehalose synthesis genes  may be operating. trehalose was not detected in the cytosol of nodules induced by either the wild type or the otsach strain under any condition tested, suggesting that trehalose in the r. etli-induced nodules is synthesized only by the microsymbiont.

discussion
trehalose in rhizobia is a key compound for signaling plant growth, yield and adaptation to abiotic stress, and its manipulation has a major agronomical impact on leguminous plant. in this work we reconstructed trehalose metabolism in r. etli, and investigated the role of trehalose in the response to high temperature and desiccation stress, as well as symbiotic performance. by using13c-nmr, we showed that besides trehalose as the major compatible solute, r. etli ce <dig> also amasses glutamate. in addition, it can accumulate mannitol if present in the external medium. the same compatible solute profile was recently reported for the strain r. etli 12a <dig>  isolated from p. vulgaris nodules in tunisian fields
 <cit> .

two successive genome-based metabolic reconstructions of r. etli have been reported, covering in total  <dig> reactions and  <dig>  genes
 <cit> . in this study, we reconstructed the metabolism of trehalose in r. etli, including trehalose uptake, degradation, and synthesis . our data suggest that uptake and catabolism of trehalose in r. etli uses the same pathways as in s. meliloti, since orthologs to the s. meliloti aglefgk/thuefgk abc trehalose/maltose/sucrose transporters
 <cit> , as well as the thuab catabolic route
 <cit> , were found in r. etli. in addition, r. etli genome accounts for up to  <dig> putative copies of the trehalose-6-phosphate hydrolase . only trec <dig> was in the same group as the characterized trec protein from e. coli, suggesting that the other copies might have a slightly different function. interestingly, trec <dig>  was located upstream of the aglefgk genes encoding the alpha-glucoside abc transporter. in s. meliloti, agla, encoding an alpha-glucosidase with homology to family  <dig> of glycosyl hydrolases, forms part of the aglefgak operon, suggesting a possible function in sucrose, maltose and/or trehalose catabolism. further work is necessary to elucidate the role of the different systems involved in trehalose transport and degradation in r. etli.

regarding trehalose synthesis, suarez et al.
 <cit>  already suggested the presence in r. etli of the three trehalose biosynthetic pathways so far known in rhizobia . in this work, we precisely located the corresponding genes, and proposed the most plausible route of glucose synthesis from mannitol, and subsequent otsab-mediated trehalose synthesis .

we found that genes for trehalose metabolism were scattered in the genome, and sometimes present in more than one copy . this high enzyme redundancy seems to be a general characteristic of r. etli cfn  <dig>  and was proposed to correlate with the different degrees of metabolic responses and alternative regulation necessary to cope with a challenging environment without compromising the integrity of the pathways
 <cit> . despite the active site residues were conserved in the p42a-encoded copy of otsa, our phylogenetic analysis, together with the presence of insertion sequences flanking the gene, and its different codon used , strongly suggests that otsaa was acquired by lateral transfer. all these findings agree with the proposal by gonzález et al.
 <cit>  about an exogenous origin for r etli p42a.

the role of trehalose in the osmostress response has been widely demonstrated in many bacteria, including s. meliloti <cit> , b. japonicum <cit>  and r. etli <cit> . in the former species, the involvement of trehalose in osmoadaptation was proposed based on three findings:  trehalose accumulation in the wild type was osmoregulated,  an otsa mutant was osmosensitive, and  overexpression of otsa led to an increased osmotolerance. our results confirm the previous result that trehalose biosynthesis in r. etli is triggered by osmotic stress. however, the otsach mutant reported in this work was much less affected by nacl stress than the otsa mutant described by suarez et al.
 <cit> . these authors tested osmosensitivity in a glycerol minimal medium with  <dig>  m nacl during  <dig> h. in contrast, we found that the r. etli wild type strain could not grow above  <dig>  m nacl in b- mannitol minimal medium. therefore, it is possible that the otsach mutant described here might show an increased osmosensitivity at higher salinities. on the other hand mannitol, which was accumulated as an osmoprotectant , might have partially restored the growth of the otsach strain when it was used as a carbon source.

notably, extracts of otsach cells grown with mannitol contained large amounts of glutamate, which was the predominant compatible solute . thus, glutamate seems to be important for the long term adaptation of r. etli to osmotic stress, at least in the otsach mutant strain describe here. very interestingly, growth of the otsach mutant was also affected in the absence of salinity stress , suggesting an important role of trehalose in r. etli physiology. trehalose has been described to be essential as cell wall and membrane precursor
 <cit> , as membrane stabilizer
 <cit> , or as antoxidant
 <cit> , to give some examples. this apparent essentiality of trehalose for normal growth of r. etli deserves further investigation.

a high level of trehalose accumulation is an important factor in the heat shock response in yeast
 <cit> . in addition, bacteria such as e. coli and s. enterica serovar typhimurium accumulate trehalose in response to heat stresses, and transcription of the otsab genes for trehalose synthesis is thermoregulated
 <cit> . in this work, we show the relevance of trehalose for r etli tolerance to high temperature. although, trehalose content in r. etli cells grown at high temperature was very low, these levels were apparently enough as to protect wild type cells against heat stress, as growth of the trehalose deficient otsach strain was impaired at high temperature. similarly in e. coli, stationary phase induced thermotolerance has been shown to depend upon the rpos regulated expression of the otsab genes for trehalose synthesis, but the levels of trehalose synthesized on entry into stationary phase were very much lower than in osmotically stressed cells
 <cit> . there is now a large body of evidence showing that the mechanisms for trehalose-mediated protection against heat and desiccation stress are different from those involved in osmoprotection, i.e., as a counteracting osmolyte. thus, studies in vitro have shown that trehalose preserves structure and function in biomolecules and molecular assemblages, such as membranes, during drying and heat stress
 <cit> .

strains of r. leguminosarum bv trifolii <cit>  and r. etli  deficient in trehalose synthesis are more sensitive to the effects of drying, and show impaired survival upon storage. thus, desiccation tolerance in r. etli cells was dependent of high trehalose production by osmotic pre-conditioned cells. indeed, desiccation stress is much more harmful than heat stress for microorganisms, as it produces the accumulation of salt and solutes, hyperosmotic stress, metabolism impairment, and damage to macromolecules upon removing the aqueous monolayer
 <cit> . this may explain why high trehalose content is necessary for survival of r. etli cells to drying, in order to cope with so many stresses. in agreement with this, e. coli <cit> , s. meliloti <cit> , and desert-isolated rhizobial strains nodulating acacia
 <cit>  that were osmotically induced to accumulate trehalose , showed increased tolerance to drying and storage. interestingly, transcriptomic analyses revealed that desiccation stress per se, if performed under controlled conditions, also induced trehalose synthesis by b. japonicum <cit> , the soil actinomycete rhodococcus jostii <cit>  and the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae <cit> .

it is worth mentioning that desiccation tolerance by r. etli was not improved by an increase in drying temperature. this lack of correlation has been also found in many other rhizobia
 <cit>  and could be attributed, at least in r. etli, to the low induction of trehalose synthesis under high temperature. on the other hand, the survival rate of r. etli wild type strain after the vacuum-drying treatments was below 40%, and rapidly decreased after  <dig> days storage . this differs from the high survival rates found for s. meliloti on nitrocellulose filters
 <cit>  or r. leguminosarum bv trifolii on glass beads
 <cit> . rather than intrinsic tolerance to desiccation, we suggest that these differences may be related to the experimental conditions used for drying.

in rhizobia, the relationship between inactivation of a given trehalose metabolic pathway  and the observed symbiotic performance, seems to vary among species . the r. etli otsa mutant reported by suarez et al.
 <cit>  was affected in its capacity to establish an efficient symbiosis with bean plants. however, bacteroids of the r. etli otsach mutant constructed in this work showed the same trehalose levels than those of the wild type, and were not affected in its symbiotic performance. the reasons for these differences remain to be elucidated, but it is plausible that under the conditions used in our symbiosis experiments other trehalose synthesis pathways were activated in the otsach strain, including the otsaa copy, that may compensate the lack of otsach. thus, our results do not preclude a role of trehalose in the r. etliphaseolus vulgaris symbiosis.

in its natural habitat, soil bacteria as r. etli are subjected to fluctuating osmotic, temperature and desiccation constrains. improving trehalose production in r etli has been shown to be a useful strategy to achieve drought tolerance of the bean plant host
 <cit> . in this work, we have shown that trehalose is essential for r. etli survival to high temperature and drying under free living conditions. thus, engineering trehalose accumulation promises to be useful to improve survival of r. etli-based inoculants during desiccation stress in storage, upon application to seeds, or once released in fields.

CONCLUSIONS
in bacteria, hyperosmotic, heat and drought stresses involve a number of multiple and complex responses, which in some cases are interrelated. desiccation tolerance is special, as any response against this stress should be sensed and elicited before the water activity is too low as to respond to. in b. japonicum, controlled desiccation conditions resulted in a significant induction of the otsa, otsb and tres genes for trehalose synthesis, as well as increased trehalose levels. however, in nature drying may be so rapid as to preclude any metabolic response. thus, it is reasonable to assume that desiccation tolerance may be either a constitutive trait or conditioned to the responses to other stresses such as high salinity, heat, or oxygen stress. in the example illustrated in this work, the disaccharide trehalose was involved in the r. etli response to the three stresses, suggesting that it is a common element of the general abiotic stress response of this microorganism. one of the most interesting findings of this study was that high temperature did not induce a dramatic accumulation of trehalose by r. etli, although trehalose levels were enough as to cope with high temperature. thus, our results suggest that selection of heat tolerant strains might not always ensure a concomitant enhanced drought tolerance, at least if the strategy is based upon a higher trehalose accumulation. on the other hand, desiccation seems to be the most deleterious stress for r. etli, and apparently demanded a higher, osmotic stress-dependent, trehalose production in order to survive.
