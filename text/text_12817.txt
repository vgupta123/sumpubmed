BACKGROUND
the evolutionary success of the maternally inherited α-proteobacteria wolbachia pipientis is partly due to its ability to manipulate host reproduction to favour vertical transmission from mother to offspring. wolbachia are also able to switch between hosts via horizontal transfer, which contributes to the impressive diversity and range of infected hosts  <cit> . these obligate endosymbionts are found in most filarial nematodes and are estimated to be present in ~60% of arthropod species  <cit> . in arthropods, wolbachia are considered to be sex-parasites because they alter compatibility between eggs and sperm, feminize or kill males, or induce parthenogenesis  <cit> . since wolbachia remain unculturable endosymbionts, comparative genomics and evolutionary approaches are particularly useful for identifying putative bacterial determinants involved in wolbachia-host interactions.

recent genome analyses of different wolbachia strains revealed a surprisingly high number of ankyrin domain-containing genes   <cit> . their presence is suggested to be the result of lateral gene transfer since they are mostly found in eukaryotes but in few bacterial and viral genomes  <cit> . the 33-residue ankyrin repeats  form tandem arrays that mediate specific protein-protein interactions and have diverse functions in transcription initiation, cell cycle regulation and signalling, cytoskeleton integrity, ion transport, inflammatory responses and development  <cit> . the two closely related intracellular bacteria anaplasma phagocytophilum and ehrlichia chaffeensis secrete ankyrin proteins  that bind to host dna and/or proteins  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that anka plays an important role in facilitating intracellular infection  <cit>  whereas p <dig> is thought to affect host cell gene transcription and promote the survival of the pathogen  <cit> . hence it has been suggested that ank genes encode wolbachia effectors that alter host biology  <cit> .

several studies have suggested that wolbachia ank proteins were implicated in the molecular basis of cytoplasmic incompatibility   <cit> . sequence divergence between closely related wolbachia strains causing distinct ci types in culex pipiens mosquito populations has been found in two ank genes , among a subset of phylogenetic markers  <cit> . thus, these polymorphic pk <dig> and pk <dig> ank genes, located within a so-called wo prophage region of wolbachia genome, are suggested to contribute to the ci phenotype. consistent with this argument, expression of the pk <dig> gene occurred specifically in female mosquitoes  <cit> . moreover, a premature stop codon was found in the pk <dig> gene of the wolbachia strain  that is unable to cause ci in d. simulans <cit> .

in this study, we aimed to determine whether the prophage pk <dig> and pk <dig> ankyrin genes were involved in the ci phenotype described in three wolbachia-infected species of terrestrial isopods. we also investigated whether these genes were conserved and expressed in wolbachia strains inducing feminization, the main wolbachia phenotype described for this group of hosts  <cit> . from the genome of the feminizing wvulc wolbachia strain that infects the isopod armadillidium vulgare , we annotated the pk <dig> and pk <dig> alleles among all ank genes identified from the wvulc contigs. we investigated the distribution, copy number and expression patterns of both genes in seven additional wolbachia strains that induce either ci or feminization in isopods. we identified a large copy number variation of the pk <dig> and pk <dig> genes among wolbachia strains, which is probably coupled to prophage evolution. surprisingly, our results also revealed that expression of one pk <dig> allele  is only detected in feminizing wolbachia strains and never in the three ci-inducing strains of isopods.

RESULTS
characterization and distribution of pk <dig> and pk <dig> genes
six copies of the pk <dig> gene and three copies of the pk <dig> gene were identified in the contig assembly of the wvulc genome . each of the six putative prophage regions of the assembly contains one pk <dig> allele and three of these prophages also harbour one pk <dig> allele . two wvulc pk <dig> alleles  and one pk <dig> allele  were each found in two identical copies. these results were confirmed by southern blotting  and are consistent with the sequencing of pcr products .

relationships between these alleles and all the published sequences of wolbachia pk <dig> and pk <dig> genes were assessed based on the dna sequences encoding ank-repeats. no evidence of recombination events has been detected in the alignments of pk <dig> and pk <dig> gene regions encoding ank motifs . in the pk <dig> sequences, the number of variable sites is  <dig> out of  <dig>  of which  <dig> are informative. similarly, there are  <dig> informative sites in the 292 bp-long pk <dig> sequence alignment. the resulting genetic networks show that pk <dig> and pk <dig> sequences group in two clusters . based on these relationships, we defined two different types of pk <dig> genes  and two different types of pk <dig> genes  . the wvulc genome contains a single copy of the pk1a type  and  <dig> copies belonging to the pk1b type: ank <dig>  ank46a/b and ank60a/b . the wvulc pk1a gene clusters together with the pk1a type gene of wmel  whereas it shares  <dig>  to  <dig>  % identity with the five wvulc pk1b type sequences. the region encoding ank repeats in the wvulc ank60a/b alleles is related to the pk <dig> sequence from the wcaub <dig> prophage . wvulc ank46a/b alleles are closely related to the pk <dig> gene from the wcaub <dig> prophage . ank <dig> seems somehow related to the pk <dig> gene from the wovita <dig> prophage . the wvulc genome also harbours three genes of the pk2b type, ank <dig> and ank40a/b, further called pk2b <dig> and pk2b <dig> alleles respectively. in contrast to the pk <dig> gene, all three wvulc pk <dig> alleles form a cluster in the gene network . their closest relative is the pk <dig> gene harboured by the wovita <dig> prophage of the wolbachia strain endosymbiont of nasonia vitripennis .

using the same primer set as for wvulc , the taxonomic distribution of pk <dig> and pk <dig> genes was extended by pcr to seven wolbachia strains that induce either ci or feminization in isopods. all these strains of isopods are known to belong to the b-supergroup of wolbachia whatever the phylogenetic marker used  <cit> . they do not form separate monophyletic clades according to the phenotype they induce in their hosts based on the wsp gene . we also investigated the copy number variation by southern blot analyses of ecori or bamhi digested dna using pk1apk1b and pk2b <dig> probes which, according to sequence identities, preferentially hybridized on pk1apk1b and pk2b types, respectively . in congruence with amplification and sequencing data, the pk1a and pk1b probes revealed two to six copies of the pk <dig> gene in the studied strains . by direct sequencing of the pcr products, we found that the pk1a gene of wolbachia strains of c. convexusp. pruinosusa. vulgare  and a. nasatum harboured  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ecori sites, respectively, explaining the discrepancy between the number of bands observed by southern blots, and the number of different sequences obtained . similarly, two pk1b alleles of the wolbachia strain of a. nasatum contained one bamhi restriction site. each of the two more intense southern blot signals  revealed the presence of two identical copies wvulc pk1b alleles, as confirmed by the analysis of contigs. furthermore, southern blots using a pk2b <dig> probe in combination with sequencing data revealed three copies of the pk <dig> gene in all strains tested except one . in the wolbachia strain of p. pruinosus, sequences of pcr products revealed two identical pk <dig> alleles, each containing one bamhi restriction site explaining the five signals obtained by southern blotting . moreover, no signal was obtained from digested and undigested dna of wolbachia-free ovaries of isopod , which confirmed the wolbachia origin of the pk <dig> and pk <dig> genes.

molecular evolution of pk <dig> and pk2genes
the gc content of wvulc pk <dig> alleles  is similar to that of the whole genome assembly  whereas the gc content of wvulc pk <dig> alleles  is significantly greater. similar results were obtained considering pk <dig> and pk <dig> genes of all wolbachia genomes   . interestingly, the gc content of pk <dig> and pk <dig> sequences is significantly different from the whole prophage sequences, which comprise an intermediate gc content of  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  . ank motif-encoding sequence analysis indicated no recombination and ka/ks  to the rate of synonymous substitutions ) of all positions was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for pk <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for pk <dig>  purifying selection is thus acting on these domain-encoding sequences and no sites are under positive selection.

all translated pk <dig> full-length sequences are predicted to harbour two transmembrane domains in their c-terminal region but a variable number of ank motifs ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> . in wvulc, ank46a/b and ank60a/b sequences  are shorter in their n-terminal region than the other pk <dig> translated sequences . one indel at position  <dig> of the dna sequence of wvulc ank46a/b is responsible for a frame shift, which splits the gene into two orfs homologous to the full-length pk <dig> of other strains. ank60a/b sequences are shortened by a transposase gene insertion in the 5′ region. in contrast, pk <dig> translated sequences are more conserved  among wolbachia strains than pk <dig>  all pk <dig> amino acid sequences harbour  <dig> ank motifs except in the wau strain  in which a premature stop codon disrupts the third motif .

comparative analysis of pk <dig> and pk <dig> mrna expression in ci and feminizing wolbachia strains
rt-pcr using allele-specific primers was performed to examine the expression patterns of pk <dig> and pk <dig> mrna in adult gonads of isopods harbouring ci-inducing or feminizing wolbachia strains . evidence of expression was observed for all copies of pk <dig> and pk <dig> genes except for one allele of the pk2b type . although the pk <dig> alleles were amplified by pcr using dna of all the three isopod ci-inducing wolbachia strains , rt-pcr did not yield any detectable products in these strains using the pk2b <dig> allele-specific primers . in contrast, the pk2b <dig> allele was clearly expressed in all the feminizing wolbachia strains . in hosts where both males and females are infected by ci-inducing or feminizing strains, no clear sex-specific differences were observed in pk <dig> and pk <dig> expression . we further examined the expression of pk2b <dig> and another prophage gene, orf <dig> which encodes the phage capsid, in several tissues of a. vulgare females harbouring the feminizing wvulc strain . while orf <dig> was expressed only in ovaries, the host tissue where the density of wolbachia is higher, transcription of pk2b <dig> was revealed in all tissues tested  .

discussion
in this study, we found that a large copy number variation of pk <dig> and pk <dig> genes exists among wolbachia strains, which is probably coupled to prophage dynamics and evolution. copy number divergence in the ankyrin pk <dig> and pk <dig> is consistent with the results of previous southern blotting analyses using the minor capsid orf <dig> phage gene  <cit> . four different orf <dig> paralogs had already been identified in the wvulc strain through cloning and sequencing of heterogeneous pcr products  <cit> . since multiple infections of wolbachia in a single individual have never been observed in isopods, we can conclude that the phage wo is likely to be present in several copies in each wolbachia strain. our observations of wolbachia strains of isopods suggest that dynamics of the prophage pk <dig> and pk <dig> genes is similar to that observed in the wri and wpip-pel genomes  <cit> . while the pk <dig> and pk <dig> ank genes are each found as a single copy within the wo-b prophage of the wmel genome  <cit> , sequencing of the ci-inducing wpip-pel, wri and wvita wolbachia prophages revealed a duplication of these genes together with the wo-b-like prophages  <cit> . for instance, in the wpip-pel genome, the three pk <dig> and the three pk <dig> genes are spread among the five different prophages which are closely related to the wo-b wmel prophage  <cit> . hence, the divergence in the pk <dig> and pk <dig> gene copy number between wolbachia strains may be explained by mechanisms related to bacterial genome organization and modulation of gene copy number  <cit> . as an example, two pseudogenes  out the four copies of the pk <dig> gene in wri, are spread in the worib prophage  and may have originally been a single pk <dig> gene further disrupted by an insertion sequence iswpi <dig>  on the other hand, the high gc content of pk <dig> supports the occurrence of recent lateral transfers of prophage fragments containing the pk <dig> gene but not necessarily pk <dig> in the wolbachia genomes. however, we cannot exclude the hypothesis that linkage disequilibrium occurs between pk <dig> and pk <dig> genes that are separated by at least  <dig>  kilobases, representing less than  <dig> % of the whole genome size. these results also highlight the genomic plasticity of the prophage region among wolbachia strains as part of the global plasticity observed in the wolbachia genomes  <cit> . maintenance of such “mobile elements” in wolbachia strains of arthropods may be due to the absence of, or a reduced efficiency of selection on the prophages. nevertheless, the purifying selection acting on these pk <dig> and pk <dig> genes suggest that maintenance of sequences confers an adaptive advantage.

besides identifying mosaic prophages, our results also reveal the differential expression of one pk <dig> ankyrin according to the wolbachia phenotype they induce . one allele  is only expressed in the feminizing strains and never in the three ci-inducing strains of isopods. in contrast to the observations for wpip  <cit> , expression pattern of pk2b <dig> suggests that this allele is not involved in ci in isopods. in two recent studies, it has been shown that expression of pk <dig> and pk <dig> genes from wmel was not correlated with the ci phenotype in d. melanogaster <cit> . our transcriptional result rather leads to the hypothesis that this pk2b <dig> allele is involved in the feminization of isopod hosts. this hypothesis is strengthened by the observation that the pk2b <dig> allele is expressed in all a. vulgare tissues  whereas another prophage gene  is only expressed in ovaries. furthermore, no differential expression of pk <dig> and pk <dig> genes was identified between sexes in isopods when either ci-inducing or feminizing wolbachia infects both males and females. this result differs from those of sinkins and colleagues who showed that in some ci-inducing wpip variants, the three pk <dig> genes  are highly expressed in females but never in males  <cit> .

our data do not enable us to explain why pk2b <dig> is only expressed in feminizing strains of wolbachia whereas its homologs, also found in ci-inducing strains, are associated with ci phenotype in mosquitoes  <cit> . first, one can suggest that this allele has been inactivated or importantly down regulated in the ci-inducing strains of isopods. change in regulatory element repertoire and divergence in patterns of expression may occur after small-scale duplication of the genome  <cit> . a corollary to a change in location, paralogous and homologous pk <dig> copies within and among wolbachia strains would have followed different evolutionary trajectories leading to such a phenotypic diversity. second, genomic imprinting, process by which genes are expressed from only one parental allele due to epigenetic mechanism, can be considered as a molecular mechanism underlying the diversity of phenotypes. recently, early changes in gene imprinting and aberrant expression of specific genes have been shown to be coupled to parthenogenesis in mice embryos  <cit> . third, one can suggest that genes in the pk <dig> family could have diverse functions. in this way, post-transcriptional modifications and dosage of wolbachia products, as well as genetic control by the host, cannot be dismissed. as previously suggested  <cit> , differences in wolbachia-induced feminization as well as the presence of the bacteria in o. asellus males, may simply result from differences in bacterial dosage or in host targets. the basic molecular mechanisms that mediate wolbachia feminization are also still unknown although it is unlikely that this effect is driven by only one gene. in a. vulgarewolbachia effectors may target the proteinaceous androgenic hormone or its receptor, or another major sex determinant, thereby inhibiting the androgenic gland differentiation and preventing the androgenic hormone from reaching the target tissues such as gonads and tegumental epithelium  <cit> . this hypothesis suggests a late action of feminizing wolbachia on host target during its development, as opposed to the very early action of other wolbachia strains that induce parthenogenesis, ci or male killing  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our results highlight a large copy number variation of both pk <dig> and pk <dig> genes among strains, likely linked to prophage diversity, and also the specific expression of one pk <dig> allele only in the feminizing wolbachia strains of isopods. this correlation supports the hypothesis that phenotype-related effectors or specific strain determinants in wolbachia are likely to be encoded by prophage genes, ankyrin-repeat encoding genes, and predicted genes of unknown function  <cit> . our results thus reveal the need to search for host molecules targeted by wolbachia ankyrins and their functions with respect to host sex manipulation by wolbachia.
