BACKGROUND
over the last decade, evidence for the impact of the bacterial genetic background on tb infection and disease has strongly increased  <cit> . a phylogeography of m. tuberculosis based on large sequence polymorphisms and confirmed by multi-locus sequence analysis could furthermore be established, showing an association between specific m. tuberculosis strains and a particular geographic region  <cit> . the different m. tuberculosis strains were grouped into  <dig> main lineages . various studies investigated the impact of different mtbc lineages on the clinical presentation of the disease. infection with lineage  <dig> has for example been found to be associated with faster progression to disease  <cit>  and drug resistance  <cit> . lineage  <dig> on the other hand, has been associated with pulmonary tb rather than extrapulmonary tb  <cit> . in addition, few studies have analysed the impact of the genetic background of both, humans and bacteria on disease development  <cit>  and found correlations between different human genetic polymorphisms with specific m. tuberculosis lineages. however, findings from studies investigating lineage specific associations have also reflected within lineage variability  <cit> . therefore, further discriminatory strain differentiation methods should be considered when investigating m. tuberculosis genetic diversity. nevertheless, the various findings support the idea of a longstanding host-pathogen co-evolution and the hypothesis that tb spread together with the human out-of-africa migration  <cit> . to investigate the m. tuberculosis genetic diversity within and between different populations could therefore give important insights into the dynamics of tb disease and might help to inform national tb programs to develop better control strategies.

papua new guinea  is a high tb burden country with an estimated tb incidence rate of 348/100’ <dig> in  <dig> and its proportion of multidrug resistance  estimated at  <dig> % in new cases is higher than the estimated global average of  <dig> %  <cit> . publications on drug resistant tb in png are rare, and previous data were mainly derived from patients from western province, diagnosed in australia  <cit> . gilpin et al. reported 25% mdr-tb among patients from western province diagnosed between  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . only two publications on dr data from other provinces exist: ballif et al. found that  <dig> % of tested isolates of adult patients from madang were mdr-tb  <cit> , and a recently published study from kikori in gulf province of png reported 9% of suspected mdr-tb  in the investigated population  <cit> .

png harbours a vast human genetic diversity and has been isolated from the outside world for a long time. png was populated through several waves of human migrations and people living in the highlands represent the oldest population from the first migration wave about  <dig>  years ago  <cit> . the highlands region has only been ‘discovered’ in the 1930s  <cit>  and was sparsely populated at the time. hence it would be expected that evolutionary ‘ancient’ lineages of m. tuberculosis , proposed to be adapted to low density populations  <cit> , would be found there, whilst the ‘modern’ lineages such as lineage  <dig> and lineage  <dig> would be expected at the highly populated coastal regions. however, there is limited information on the tb situation available in png. since various lineages have been found to differ in their prevalence between different regions of the same country  it is important to also identify the circulating strains in various communities in png. to our knowledge, apart from a previous study conducted in madang province  <cit> , another study where isolates from patients from western province were analysed  <cit>  and a very recent study from gulf province  <cit> , no other data on the m. tuberculosis population structure from png have been published.

the aim of the present study was to obtain baseline data on the level of drug resistance and the genotypic diversity of circulating m. tuberculosis in selected sites of three provinces of png  and to investigate the differences between these sites.

tb positivity peaked in the age group of  <dig> to 34 years, which is consistent with country wide data  <cit> . and  <dig> %  of patients clinically diagnosed with tb had no history of the disease indicating ongoing transmission. however, these data cannot be used to extrapolate for the whole country and further investigations are required to analyse the transmission dynamics of the disease in png.

figure  <dig> depicts the flow of all isolates collected. of samples sent for culture  <dig> %  could be recovered showing a positive correlation between initial diagnostic bacterial count and culture success . the reduced culture success might be likely due to the long distance transport of samples between laboratories that was experienced with samples from other studies.

genotyping
genotyping of mtbc could successfully be conducted of 147/ <dig>  samples. with a taqman real-time pcr assay  <cit>  three of seven worldwide reported mtbc lineages  <cit> , were detected in all three study sites. overall, lineage  <dig> was the most prevalent lineage with 75/ <dig> isolates , followed by lineage  <dig> with 67/ <dig> isolates , whilst lineage  <dig> was rare with 5/ <dig> isolates . this composition of circulating lineages was similar as previously described for madang  <cit>  and other parts of png  <cit>  and reflects the reduced mtbc diversity within png compared to other countries of the region, e.g. indonesia  <cit>  or new zealand  <cit>  where lineage  <dig> strains were also found. when lineage compositions  were compared between the study sites, statistically significant differences were observed between all three sites ). lineage  <dig> was generally rare in all three sites. lineage  <dig> was the most abundant lineage in madang  similar to what has previously been described  <cit> . in contrast, in alotau lineage  <dig> was the dominant lineage . in goroka, a trend towards a higher prevalence of lineage  <dig>  was found but was not as high as in alotau. however, it cannot be ruled out that the low proportion of lineage  <dig> in our cohort is due to the strain genetic background itself, e.g. exhibiting reduced transmissibility  <cit>  and a lower growth rate in macrophages compared to lineage  <dig> and lineage  <dig>  <cit>  potentially leading to a decreased culture recovery of lineage  <dig> figure  <dig>

we further performed spoligotyping, and the spoligotyping pattern with the corresponding families and frequencies are shown in figure  <dig>  thirty different spoligotyping patterns belonged to nine different families, including  <dig> orphans with  <dig> different spoligotyping patterns. orphans were strains with no matching entry in the sitvit database and are therefore considered as undefined. whether these strains represent png specific m. tuberculosis strains remains to be confirmed using other methods.figure  <dig> 
spoligotypes for the observed lineages . sit = shared international type.



one of the lineage  <dig> strains from goroka exhibits a special spoligotyping pattern with only spacers 40– <dig> being present . that spoligotyping pattern has been confirmed with in silico spoligotyping using kvarq  <cit> . per standard definition, this would define that strain as belonging to the beijing family of lineage  <dig>  <cit> . however, snp-typing assigned this strain to lineage  <dig>  therefore representing a ‘pseudo-beijing’ strain with convergent evolution leading to an independent deletion event in the direct repeat locus of mtbc, similar to what has already been described for strains of lineage  <dig>  <cit> .

all lineage  <dig> samples belonging to the lam spoligotyping family were exclusively found in madang, also reflecting the different m. tuberculosis lineage composition in the spoligotyping data. all lineage  <dig> samples belonged to the beijing family and were subsequently subtyped into three different monophyletic groups which are sublineages defined by the presence or absence of specific regions of difference   <cit> . over all three sites, one sample of  <dig> beijing strains belonged to sublineage  <dig>  here defined as having no deletion of rd <dig>  rd <dig> or rd <dig>  one sample belonged to sublineage  <dig> with rd <dig> deleted but rd <dig> and rd <dig> being present, but the majority of beijing strains , including all beijing strains from alotau, belonged to sublineage  <dig> with rd <dig> and rd <dig> deleted. none of the samples had a deletion for rd <dig>  sublineage  <dig> is usually rare, hence the high frequency in our sample is surprising. several studies have shown that sublineage  <dig> has rapidly spread in cape town, south africa during the last decade, probably because of a founder effect and/or adaptation to the local host-population  <cit> . due to the lack of longitudinal data, it is not possible to draw any conclusion about the time of introduction or the duration of spread of this subtype in png. however, except for two outliers, our subtyping data based on rds implies a single introduction of the beijing strain and a subsequent clonal expansion through png. starting with this observation, it would be important to follow the prevalence of this lineage in madang and in the country as a whole to monitor a potential increase of beijing strains in the future.

the reasons for the observed differences in lineage frequencies in the three study sites surveyed remain speculative. these sites differ in several aspects, e.g. goroka in the highlands had been much longer isolated from the outside world for much longer than the two coastal sites. the population in the highlands are believed to be descendants of the oldest human migration wave that populated the country  <cit> , however, no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of lineage  <dig> in goroka could be detected.

other factors might also influence the lineage distribution. goroka and madang are connected to the country through the highlands highway, whilst madang and alotau have direct access to the island of png and beyond. similarly, the host genetic background and environmental or circumstantial factors such as co-infections or age could well influence the m. tuberculosis lineage distribution. we therefore performed univariate and multivariate logistic regressions to test whether infection with a lineage  <dig> strain  was associated with other factors such as dr, hiv status, age and gender . samples not belonging to lineage  <dig> were pooled for the analysis, consisting of five samples of lineage  <dig> and  <dig> samples of lineage  <dig>  univariate logistic regression confirmed the differences in lineage distribution between the study sites. these differences remained significant also when correcting for possible confounders in a multivariate regression.table  <dig>

co-infection with hiv has several times been shown to be associated with infection with strains of the beijing type  <cit> . we also found a significant association between hiv positivity and infection with a lineage  <dig> strain , but due to sample size multivariate logistic regression could not be performed. however, hiv prevalence in png is still comparably low, in particular in alotau ,  <dig> % in eastern highlands province  and  <dig> % in madang province)  <cit>  and is therefore unlikely to play a major role in the distribution of lineages.

it is important to note that all differences are between the frequencies of lineage  <dig> and lineage  <dig>  whilst lineage  <dig> played no major role, although we would have expected more ancient lineages  in the highlands. lineage  <dig> and lineage  <dig> are not only the most prevalent m. tuberculosis lineages in png, but are also predominating globally  <cit> . thus, our findings could support the notion of hershberg and colleagues  <cit>  that the lineage distribution between and within countries might become homogenized with increasing migration. in other words, more virulent strains such as lineage  <dig> and lineage  <dig> might slowly replace the ancient lineages as has already been observed in cameroon  <cit>  and might have started in png.

drug resistance
in total 23/ <dig>  samples were resistant to at least one of the drugs tested. the details of the dr patterns and their frequency in each study site are shown in table  <dig>  with  <dig> %  the proportion of isolates resistant  to streptomycin  was the highest in our cohort. high str resistance in png is well known and has been found in previous studies  <cit> . in the past str has been used frequently as single drug to treat tb but also urinary tract and klebsiella infections  <cit>  which might have led to drug resistance. drug resistance of any type and mdr frequencies were highest in alotau with  <dig> % of mdr cases, but monoresistance was observed more often in goroka  and madang  compared to alotau . however, none of these differences were statistically significant .table  <dig>

in order to determine drug resistance mechanisms of  <dig> phenotypically drug resistant isolates for which dna could be obtained , we determined mutations in ten genes known to be associated with resistance. two pan-susceptible strains of patients with late sputum conversion were also included. sequence data were analysed and mutations observed are shown in figure  <dig> figure  <dig> 
overview of genes/gene regions sequenced and mutations observed. no mutations were found in ahpc, pnca and gyra. black squares: mutation detected at indicated position; white squares: no mutation found at indicated position; dotted squares: no mutation found at any of the indicated positions, which are the most commonly known sites of mutation for the detected phenotypic drug resistance patterns. all positions indicate the amino acid change at the codon position, except for rrs gene where nucleotide position and change is indicated.



streptomycin resistance has been shown to be associated with mutations in the rrs, rpsl or gidb gene  <cit> . for two str mono-resistant samples only a mutation in gidb was detected  or no mutation was found in any of the analysed genes, respectively . all observed mutations in that gene had also been observed in our previous study in madang. the sole observation of the synonymous mutation a205g and the non-synonymous mutation a92c in lineage  <dig> strains, suggests that these mutations might be lineage specific  <cit>  with no mutations occurring in lineage  <dig>  in three samples, all belonging to lineage  <dig>  we found the a10p mutation. in contrast to our previous study where the a10p mutation was absent from  <dig> pan-susceptible samples, we observed this mutation in one of the pan-susceptible samples , probably suggesting that this mutation plays no role in str resistance. whether the mutation v77g found here in one str resistant strain - and yet only described from png - is involved in str resistance  <cit>  remains to be determined.

ninety-five per cent of the rifampicin  resistance conferring mutations occur in an 81 bp core region of the so called rifampin resistance determining region   <cit> . we found only one rmp monoresistant sample  which had no mutation in the 849 bp  of the rpob gene we amplified, confirming that rmp resistant strains without a typical mutation in the rrdr are not more common in our sample. this is of crucial importance for the png dr surveillance being based on xpert® mtb/rif   <cit>  which determines rmp resistance only through detection of mutations in rrdr  <cit> . however,  <dig> %  of strains were isoniazid  monoresistant or inh/str polyresistant. inh resistance is a precursor to mdr-tb and is not detected by the xpert® mtb/rif, forming an additional challenge for the control of dr tb that should be addressed by the ntp in the future.

all low level inh resistant samples  of our study showed a mutation in the inha promoter region, whereas all high inh resistant samples  showed a mutation at codon  <dig> of katg, including all mdr samples and one of the polyresistant strains with inh and str resistance . no mutations were detected in the ahpc promoter region for any of the samples.

two mdr samples had no mutation in 850 bp of katg sequenced, none in the ahpc promoter or the inha promoter. one of these samples was also resistant to ethambutol   but had no mutation in the embb region including codon  <dig>  which is mutated in up to 68% of clinical emb resistant strains  <cit> . for that sample the whole genome sequence was available  and was used to screen for mutations outside the amplified regions of katg or embb. screening revealed a 14 bp deletion at position  <dig> to  <dig>  causing a truncation of katg through a frameshift, explaining the phenotypic high inh resistance of that sample. outside of the sequenced embb region the non-synonymous mutation g406s was found which had already been described in several other studies suggesting its role in emb resistance  <cit> . for the second mdr sample without a katg mutation, no sequence data was available and the inh resistance conferring mutation could not be determined. it remains unclear whether a deletion in katg or mutations in other genes associated with inh resistance, for example in kasa  <cit>  could be responsible for the inh resistance.

no mutation was found in the amplified regions of pnca for any of the genotyped isolates. however, since for the only sample with phenotypic pyrazinamide resistance  no dna could be obtained, genotyping of that isolate was not possible.

possible associations with known risk factors for dr were tested using univariate logistic regressions . risk of being infected with a dr strain was  <dig>  times higher for patients with a history of tb treatment and  <dig>  times higher for patients infected with an lineage  <dig> strain although the latter was not statistically significant . to correct for possible confounders multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted and the adjusted odds ratio  for risk of being infected with a dr strain with a history of tb treatment decreased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  but remained significant . this association highlights the importance of constant access to treatment and compliance for the control of dr tb. strengthening the dots strategy and increasing awareness of tb in the population is crucial also in png and needs to be maintained at a high level in order not to delay diagnosis and to prevent the possible spread of tb.table  <dig>

ballif et al. previously found a significant association between an infection with a lineage  <dig> strain and drug resistance in a previous study conducted in madang :  <dig>  -  <dig> )  <cit> . also in our current sample set from madang a significant association between lineage  <dig> strains and drug resistance was found, but only after correction for previous tb treatment :  <dig>  –  <dig> ), probably due to the limited sample size . to test whether the two sample sets from madang  differed significantly in the drug resistance data, we compared the results of the drug resistance and lineage  <dig> analyses from both sample sets by a χ <dig> test of ors, but no significant difference was found .

because of the small sample size we also only found a borderline significant association between multiple drug resistance and lineage  <dig> infection   <dig>  –  <dig> ; or = 8): there was an  <dig> times higher risk of being infected with a polyresistant  or mdr strain when infected with an lineage  <dig> strain compared to an infection with a strain of a different lineage .

CONCLUSIONS
the direct comparison of m tuberculosis population structures from distinct sites in png demonstrated a statistically significant difference between subpopulations. in madang lineage  <dig> was the dominating lineage, whereas lineage  <dig> was more frequently detected in alotau and goroka. although the reasons for the observed significant differences of the circulating m. tuberculosis strains between study sites are not yet understood, these differences might have a major impact on disease and transmission dynamics in different populations of png. different control strategies for places with a different m. tuberculosis lineage composition are not available yet, i.e. the same control strategies apply for all provinces in png, namely to detect cases and treat them accordingly. however, by knowing about the increased prevalence of the beijing type of m. tuberculosis in milne bay province, and with the known association between this lineage and drug resistance, monitoring of the latter should especially be scaled up in that province, as it could become a hot spot for drug resistance and mdr tb.

our data show that a significant number of drug resistant tb infections are present across the country and that mdr tb can already be detected in all three surveyed regions of png. nearly all phenotypical resistances were confirmed by sequence analysis.

no inferences can be made from this study for the whole country because of the small sample size and data being derived from only three major towns. nevertheless, our findings highlight the importance to monitor drug resistance in png, and for making it a high priority for the national tb control program.
