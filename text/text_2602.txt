BACKGROUND
guar, or clusterbean  taub), is a drought-tolerant annual legume, which originated in the india-pakistan area, and was introduced into the united states in  <dig>  <cit> . unlike the seeds of other legumes, guar seeds have a large endosperm, accounting for 42% of seed weight  <cit> . the predominant portion of the endosperm is mucilage or gum , which forms a viscous gel in cold water. approximately 80–85% of the gum is a galactomannan, consisting of a linear -β-linked d-mannan backbone with single-unit, -linked, α-d-galactopyranosyl side chains  <cit> . the galactomannan is in the form of non-ionic polydisperse rod-shaped polymers consisting of about  <dig>  residues, which accumulate in the primary cell walls of the endosperm  <cit> .

galactomannans from various leguminous species have different degrees of galactose substitution. low galactose galactomannans  are typical for the more distantly related caesalpinoideae sub-family of the leguminosae, whereas higher degrees of galactose substitution  are characteristic of the more closely related papilionoideae legume sub-family  <cit> . guar galactomannan has a mannose to galactose  ratio of  <dig>   <cit> . pure mannan without galactose is completely insoluble in water, and increasing galactose substitution increases the solubility of the polymer by allowing it to become extended  <cit> .

galactomannans are multifunctional, assisting in water imbibition and drought avoidance before and during germination, and as a source of storage carbohydrate for the developing seedling  <cit> . guar galactomannans form water dispersible hydrocolloids, which thicken when dissolved in water. guar gum is therefore used as an emulsifying, thickening or stabilizing agent in a wide range of processed foods; as a stabilizer in ice cream and cake; to bind meat; and as a thickener in salad dressings and beverages  <cit> . lower-grade guar gum has numerous industrial applications as a friction-reducing agent, for example in the manufacture of cloth and paper, in the petroleum industry, and in ore flotation.

guar is economically the most important of the four species in the genus cyamopsis  <cit> . many publications over the past  <dig> years have described the properties of galactomannans and the food benefits of guar gum. however, despite the importance of the species, only a single report exists of the development of genomic resources in guar  <cit> . in this report the guar mannan synthase gene was identified from an expressed sequence tag  collection derived from rna isolated from guar seeds at three different stages of development, although no further details were given of the other est sequences obtained. we here describe the features of an additional est dataset derived from single pass sequencing of cdnas of developing guar seeds. this should prove valuable for the understanding of seed-specific gene expression, by providing an extensive resource for the cloning of genes, development of markers for map-based cloning, and annotation of future genomic sequence information. the cloning of genes encoding enzymes of specific biochemical pathways by est sequencing has been a very successful strategy, particularly when the cdna libraries were prepared from specialized tissues with high activity for the respective enzymes  <cit> . ests and their accompanying cdnas also provide the means to construct inexpensive macroarrays or microarrays, which can be used to study the expression of genes on a genome-wide scale  <cit> . furthermore, within statistical limitations  <cit> , the abundance of a specific cdna in the est collection is a measure of gene expression level. using this premise, we present a preliminary evaluation of the expression patterns of sets of genes with different functional ontologies, particularly those potentially involved in storage polysaccharide and storage protein metabolism, during the development of guar seeds.

RESULTS
generation of cdna libraries
annotation and functional classification of guar ests
ests were annotated with reference to gene function using the results of blastx comparisons with the genbank non-redundant protein database . est sequences were grouped in three categories based on the "bit score" s'  <cit>  of the aligned sequence segment with the top database hit after blastx comparison. the "secure" assignment group contains  <dig>  unigenes  with the s' score value equal to or greater than 200; the "putative" assignment group contained  <dig>  unigenes  with the s' scores less than 200; the "no assignment" group contained  <dig>  unigenes  with no score. a blastx comparison of the  <dig>  unigenes with no score was made against the medicago truncatula genome v  <dig>   <cit> , which resulted in an additional  <dig> annotations. for sequences that did not have blastx scores, no protein similar to the translation product was present in the public databases at the time of analysis. we therefore assume that approximately 27% of the clones in the seed database encode previously undescribed proteins or may represent non-coding rna.

the largest group of ests fell into the "putative" assignment group. this group could reduce dramatically with additional efforts to improve the length of the sequencing reads and quality of the sequence data. for most of the analyses described, only the "secure" assignment group was considered for distributing genes into functional categories in order to gain a preliminary understanding of metabolic processes during guar seed development . however, both "secure" and "putative" assignment groups were used to identify candidate genes for specific biochemical pathways.

energy flow in developing guar seeds
seed development is genetically programmed and is associated with striking changes in metabolite levels. differentiation occurs successively, starting with the maternal and followed by the filial organs, which later become highly specialized storage tissues. a complex regulatory network triggers initiation of seed maturation and corresponding accumulation of storage products. this includes transcriptional and physiological reprogramming mediated by sugar and hormone-responsive pathways  <cit> .

galactomannan and seed storage proteins accumulate to high amounts in mature guar seeds, representing 26–32% and 23–31% of the seed dry weight, respectively  <cit> . the biosynthesis of carbohydrate and storage proteins in guar seeds is probably preceded by increased transcriptional activity for these processes. consistent with this hypothesis, the distribution of functional ontologies in the est database  revealed major contributions from genes annotated as encoding proteins involved in signal transduction , carbohydrate metabolism , chaperone and proteolytic processes , and translation and ribosomal structure  .

mature seeds have very low metabolic activity, reflected by the lower representation of specific est classes in library ii. genes annotated as involved in signal transduction were represented by four times as many ests, carbohydrate metabolism three times, chaperone and proteolytic activity  <dig>  times, and translation and ribosomal structure  <dig>  times, in library i compared to library ii . however, three functional categories were represented by higher numbers of ests in library ii. these include seed storage proteins , and hormonal and stress/pathogen induced genes. ssps accumulate to high levels during the late stages of seed development. among the "stress/pathogen response" group of genes, one highly induced contig  was represented by  <dig> ests in library ii. this gene showed 81% amino acid similarity to a ripening-related protein from soybean   which is activated in soybean-soybean cyst nematode interactions and contains a conserved domain for the pathogenesis-related protein bet v i family.

ug <dig>  in the hormone-inducible functional category, was represented by  <dig> ests in library ii. the encoded protein showed 85% amino acid similarity to an auxin down-regulated gene from soybean  <cit> , the function of which is yet to be determined. five and seven ests" in libraries i and ii, respectively, corresponded to genes involved in the biosynthesis of gibberellic acid  . synthesis of ga in developing seeds is necessary to promote cell expansion  <cit> .

galactomannan metabolism
biosynthesis – galactomannan is the major storage polysaccharide in guar seeds and accumulates in cell walls of the endosperm, accounting for up to 26–32% of the seed dry weight  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows an outline of galactomannan metabolism in guar, highlighting the importance of sucrose as a building block. in most plant species carbon is transported as sucrose. cleavage of the o-glycosidic bond between the glucose and fructose units of sucrose is catalyzed by invertase  and sucrose synthase   <cit> . invertase is a hydrolase, cleaving sucrose irreversibly into glucose and fructose, whereas sucrose synthase is a glycosyl transferase, converting sucrose in the presence of udp into udp-glucose and fructose. two ests corresponding to different invertase unigenes were detected only in library i. likewise, of the  <dig> unigenes corresponding to sucrose synthases, most were also represented by ests found in library i .

during seed development, entry of carbon from the maternal coat cells into the seed apoplasm is mediated by membrane-localized sugar transporters  <cit> . twelve unigenes annotated as sugar transporters were found in the guar seed cdna libraries . all ests, with the exception of ug <dig>  were detected in library i, suggesting that sugar transporters are actively transcribed, and presumably function, during early stages of guar seed development.

no hexokinase ests were detected in either of the cdna libraries. plant hexokinase  has been shown to be involved in sugar sensing and signalling, and is proposed to be a dual-function enzyme with both catalytic and regulatory functions  <cit> . for example, transgenic arabidopsis plants over-expressing athxk <dig> and athxk <dig> showed enhanced sensitivity to glucose containing medium  <cit> . overexpression of the arabidopsis athxk <dig> in transgenic tomato plants led to reduced photosynthetic activity  <cit> . hxk is presumably encoded by low abundance transcripts in developing guar seeds.

phosphomannoisomerase  converts fructose-6-phosphate  to mannose-6-phosphate . this enzyme also functions in the reverse direction in the utilization of mannose released by hydrolysis of galactomannan on germination, after it is phosphorylated to man-6-p  <cit> . no ests annotated as phosphomannoisomerase were detected in either of the libraries. however, two unigenes corresponding to phosphomannomutase , which reversibly converts d-mannose 6-phosphate to α-d-mannose 1-phosphate, were identified; four ests were found in library i and three ests in library ii.

the direct precursors for galactomannan biosynthesis, gdp-d-mannose and udp-d-galactose, are formed by the actions of gdp mannose phosphorylase  and udp-galactose 4-epimerase . in vitro experiments have shown that the relative concentrations of these precursors can affect the m:g ratio of the galactomannan polymer  <cit> . of the three ests corresponding to gdp mannose phosphorylase, one was found in library i and two in library ii. two ests corresponding to udp-galactose 4-epimerase were detected only in library i.

two tightly membrane-bound glycosyltransferases together catalyze the formation of galactomannans. gdp-mannose-dependent mannosyltransferase transfers mannose residues to the end of the growing linear  β-linked mannose backbone of the galactomannan polymer  <cit> . simultaneously, udp-galactose-dependent galactosyltransferase transfers a galactose residue through a  α-linkage to a mannose at or near the nonreducing end of the growing mannan chain  <cit> . importantly, galactose can not be transferred to preformed mannose chains  <cit> . the activities of the two transferases increase in parallel during the period of galactomannan synthesis, such that the m:g ratio in the polymer remains constant  <cit> . ug <dig>  represented as a single est in library i, was 100% identical to a recently described guar β-mannan synthase sequence  <cit> . rt-pcr analysis with rna from guar roots, leaves, stems, cotyledons and different development stages of seeds, revealed that this gene was only expressed in seeds, with maximum transcript accumulation at  <dig> daf . in a previous study  <cit>   <dig> ests corresponding to β-mannan synthase were found in a library derived from guar endosperm at  <dig> daf. the low frequency of β-mannan synthase ests in our work may be due to the fact that our libraries were constructed from whole seed tissues.

it is not known how many isoforms of β-mannan synthase and galactosyl transferase are involved in galactomannan biosynthesis in guar. to highlight additional candidate β-mannan synthase genes, we considered all ests which show similarity to glycosyl transferase family  <dig> members, which are able to transfer gdp-mannose to a range of substrates. by this criterion, four additional ests representing putative β-mannan synthase were found, three from library i and one from library ii .

udp-galactose-dependent galactosyltransferase belongs to glycosyl transferase family  <dig>  <cit> . two ests corresponding to galactosyltransferase were detected in our est database; ug <dig>  from library ii, showed 100% identity to a guar galactosyltransferase sequence available in genbank, whereas ug <dig>  also from library ii, showed 62% similarity to a galactosyltransferase from rice  . rt-pcr analysis of different guar tissues showed the presence of ug <dig> transcripts only in seeds, with maximal accumulation at  <dig> daf , consistent with an involvement of this gene in galactomannan biosynthesis.

hydrolysis – three enzymes are involved in the hydrolysis of galactomannans during seed germination: β-mannosidase, which hydrolyses the oligomannans released by prior endo β-mannanase activity; β-mannanase, which cleaves the mannan backbone; and α-galactosidase which concomitantly removes the galactose side-chain units  <cit> . galactomannan hydrolases were the most abundant class of ests involved in galactomannan metabolism in the seed est libraries. of the five genes annotated as β-mannanase, ug <dig> and ug <dig> were highly represented in library i, by  <dig> and  <dig> ests respectively. rt-pcr analysis showed the highest expression level for ug <dig> to be at 20– <dig> daf . thus, β-mannanases are actively transcribed during early seed development in guar. schroder et al  recently demonstrated that a tomato endo-β-mannanase can carry out a transglycosylation in the presence of mannan-derived oligosacchrides  <cit> . this observation may support our findings of high steady-state levels of β-mannanase transcripts in developing seeds.

of the three β-mannosidase genes detected only in library ii, ug <dig> was the most highly expressed, being represented by  <dig> ests. rt-pcr confirmed elevated transcript levels for this gene at 30– <dig> daf . α-galactosidase appeared to be less highly expressed; from four identified unigenes, only three ests were present in library i and one in library ii . early transcriptional activation of galactomannan hydrolyzing enzymes is consistent with seed biology. upon imbibition, pre-formed enzymes present in the aleurone layer are secreted to mobilize the stored reserves during seed germination  <cit> . nevertheless, it does raise the question of whether degradative enzymes are ever in proximity with galactomannan during its biosynthesis, such that overall chain length or composition is modified prior to storage.

seed storage proteins
seed storage proteins  are a set of proteins that accumulate to high levels in seeds during the late stages of development. during germination, ssps are degraded and the resulting amino acids are utilized by the developing seedlings as a nutritional source  <cit> . in mature guar seeds, protein accounts for 23–31% of seed dry weight  <cit> .

five classes of unigenes representing seed-specific proteins were identified in both guar libraries and showed similarities to oleosin, glycinin, conglutin, "seed specific protein," and legumin. all except glycinin did not pass the "secure" assignment threshold of s ≥  <dig> . usually, ssp sequences predominate in cdna libraries derived from seeds  <cit> . the ssps were not subtracted from the libraries described here. a single ssp, ug <dig>  represented the largest class of clones, with  <dig> ests in library ii and comprising  <dig> % of the total ests from both libraries. the predicted translation product of this gene contained  <dig> amino acids and showed 51% amino acid identity to the delta-conglutin seed storage protein precursor from lupinus albus. conglutin delta is related to the 2s super-family of storage proteins  <cit> . 2s storage proteins are widely distributed in dicot seeds, including the economically important genera brassica  <cit>  and pisum  <cit> , as well as the model plant arabidopsis  <cit> . the family is characterized by low molecular weight proteins that contain relatively high levels of cysteine and glutamine.

rt-pcr analysis of guar conglutin transcripts showed maximal expression level in seeds at  <dig> daf, and a low but detectable level of expression in cotyledons . amplification of conglutin from genomic dna showed the pcr product to be the same size as the cdna, indicating that the gene lacks introns . dna gel blot analysis of the conglutin, which contains a saci restriction site in its open reading frame, revealed a low copy number in guar genomic dna .

CONCLUSIONS
we present information on a large data set of ests from two developmental "windows" of guar seeds, and provide a preliminary analysis of this resource. based on our analysis, it is clear that widely differing sets of genes are activated at the "early" and "late" developmental stages. approximately 27% of the clones in the seed dataset correspond to novel proteins. the functional ontologies with the largest numbers of ests were signal transduction, carbohydrate metabolism, translation and protein processing. overall the "late" cdna library contained fewer genes in each functional category, except for storage proteins, hormonally-induced and pathogen-stress induced genes. two major products accumulate in mature guar seeds: galactomannan and protein representing 26–32% and 23–31% of the seed dry weight, respectively  <cit> . guar unigenes involved in galactomannan metabolism were identified. among the seed storage proteins the most abundant contig represented a conglutin.
