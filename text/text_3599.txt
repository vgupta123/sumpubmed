BACKGROUND
plants offer great potential as production systems for recombinant proteins. one approach to producing foreign proteins in plants is to generate stable transgenic plant lines. however this is a very time consuming and labor intensive process. an alternative to transgenic plants is the use of plant virus-based expression vectors. plant virus-based vectors allow for the rapid, high level, transient expression of proteins in whole plants . although many different plant viruses have been modified to function as expression vectors, tobacco mosaic virus -based vectors express the highest levels of foreign protein in plants . tmv's utility as an expression vector has already been well established; tmv vectors have been used to produce of many different kinds of proteins in plants including allergens  <cit> , antibodies  <cit>  or antibody fragments  <cit> , and vaccine candidates  <cit> .

tmv is an rna virus that expresses large amounts of coat protein from a viral subgenomic promoter. to convert tmv to an expression vector an additional, heterologous coat protein subgenomic promoter and restriction enzyme sites for cloning of foreign dna sequences were inserted into a t <dig> promoter driven cdna clone of tmv <cit> . in vitro transcription of this plasmid with t <dig> rna polymerase is needed to generate biologically active transcripts. transcripts are typically rub-inoculated by hand onto plants to initiate an infection  <cit> . the in vitro transcription and rub inoculation steps in particular, add significantly to the cost and complexity of using tmv vectors.

agroinfection  <cit>  is a less-expensive and more reproducible strategy for infecting plants with rna viruses. in agroinfection a plant-functional promoter and rna virus cdna are transferred as t-dna from agrobacterium tumefaciens into plant cells. the t-dna is transcribed in planta, to generate biologically active viral rnas that can initiate self-replication. although agroinfection has been used for several different plant rna viruses, it has not been routinely used with tmv-based vectors.

recently, an agroinfection-compatible tmv replicon was constructed with extensive modifications to the tmv cdna. these modifications included  the deletion of the tmv coat protein  gene,  generating nearly  <dig> point mutations to destroy cryptic introns in the viral cdna, and  inserting multiple  plant-gene introns into the tmv cdna sequences in a binary vector  <cit> .

the point mutations and inserted introns dramatically improved the infectivity of the tmv replicon delivered to plants by agroinfection. however, because of the deletion of the cp gene, this replicon cannot move systemically in plants. plants were therefore infected in a process called "magnifection"  <cit>  in which whole plants were submerged and infiltrated with a. tumefaciens cultures carrying intron-modified tmv sequences in a binary vector. while the magnifection process is very efficient, it is not easily adapted to a high throughput workflow. also, the increased size of the intron-modified vectors can make cloning into these vectors more challenging. in addition, it is not clear if the intron-modified vectors are absolutely required for efficient agroinfection of local and systemic infection of plant tissue with a tmv vector.

therefore, there is a need for tmv expression vectors with the following features: 1) contains convenient cloning sites for genes of interest 2) can be used to infect plants in an easy and cost-effective manner, and 3) leads to efficient local and systemic infection of inoculated plants. to address these needs, a 35s promoter driven version of a commonly used tmv expression vector   <cit>  was constructed in the t-dna region of the mini-binary vector pcb <dig>  <cit> . this plasmid was then modified to contain restriction endonuclease sites for standard restriction endonuclease based cloning approaches or two sapi  restriction endonuclease sites that are useful for a new, rapid, directional cloning strategy. in this new cloning strategy, referred to here as "sticky rice" for restriction enzyme-independent cohesive ends, pcr products were directly cloned into a tmv vector, without the need for digesting pcr products with restriction enzymes.

the various 35s promoter-driven tmv vectors constructed reliably infected nicotiana benthamiana plants via agroinfection. using gfp-expressing tmv vectors, it was determined that the agroinfection efficiency of 35s driven tmv clones was significantly increased by ectopic expression of a protein with rna silencing suppressor ability. this high-efficiency agroinfection procedure made it possible to express approximately  <dig> to  <dig> μg of recombinant gfp per gram of agroinfiltrated tissue, and to reliably obtain plants that expressed gfp in systemically infected tissue. these results significantly extend the utility of the tmv expression vector system. the cloning and/or agroinfection procedure modifications described here can be readily applied to other cloning and expression vector systems and are especially amenable to high-throughput cloning workflows. these improvements should make it easier and more cost effective to use tmv-based plant expression vectors in research and development.

RESULTS
infecting plants with tmv vectors by agroinfiltration
a series of plasmids containing camv 35s promoter  driven tmv vectors, as well as 35s driven versions of the green fluorescent protein  gene and the p <dig>  gene from tbsv were constructed for this experiment . one of the tmv vectors, pjl  <dig>  contained unique recognition sites for the restriction endonucleases paci , avrii  and noti . this vector was useful for standard restriction enzyme based cloning procedures . a second vector, pjl <dig>  had a multiple cloning site that contained two sapi restriction endonuclease sites. the gfp gene was cloned into sapi digested pjl <dig> using the 'sticky rice' procedure to generate plasmid pjl43:gfp. in this procedure 5' single stranded ends, complementary to the 5' single stranded ends on sapi digested pjl  <dig>  were generated by treating specially engineered pcr products with t <dig> dna polymerase in the presence of datp and dttp. the steps of the process are outlined in figure  <dig>  the sticky rice cloning reaction could be completed in  <dig> minutes and resulted in approximately 90% cloning efficiency;  <dig> out of  <dig> clones recovered contained the gfp insert .

bdetermined by restriction endonuclease screening of plasmids 

to test the infectivity of the 35s driven tmv vectors, cultures of the gv <dig> strain of a. tumefaciens  transformed with pjl43:gfp were prepared essentially as described in johansen and carrington  <cit>  and infiltrated into 2– <dig> week old n. benthamiana plants with a  <dig> ml syringe with no needle.

three days after infiltrating a.t./pjl43:gfp cells into n. benthamiana leaves gfp-expressing cells could be seen using a hand-held uv lamp . each gfp-positive cluster of cells represents a single incident of the gfp-expressing tmv vector rna being "launched" from the transcribed t-dna, and the tmv:gfp vector moving from the initially infected cell to adjacent cells. hundreds of gfp-positive spots were detected per  <dig> cm <dig> of infiltrated leaf .

because the agroinfection efficiency of a beet yellows virus based vector was significantly increased by rna silencing suppressor proteins  <cit>  we sought to determine if rna silencing suppressor proteins could increase the agroinfection efficiency of our tmv clones. to test this n. benthamiana plants were infiltrated with a 1: <dig> mixture of a.t./pjl3:p <dig> and a.t./pjl43:gfp cultures. when plants were infiltrated with the mixture of these two cultures a dramatic increase in the number of gfp-expressing cells was observed . by three dpi it appeared that nearly 100% of the cells in the infiltrated tissue were infected with tmv:gfp . to better demonstrate the effect of p <dig> on agroinfection efficiency, plants were infiltrated with a 50-fold dilution of a.t./pjl43:gfp cells , with and without co-infiltration of a a.t./pjl3:p <dig> cells. because a 50-fold dilution of a.t./pjl43:gfp co-infiltrated with a.t./pjl3:p <dig>  resulted in more than twice the number of gfp-positive foci per cm <dig> of infiltrated tissue than infiltration with undiluted a.t./pjl43:gfp alone  we estimated that ectopic expression of pjl3:p <dig> increased the agroinfectivity of our tmv expression vector construct by at least  <dig> fold. efforts to further quantitate the effect on infectivity were not made.

after the tmv vector is launched it begins to move cell-to-cell and systemically in the plant. by about  <dig> dpi non-infiltrated  leaves of the plant began to be infected by the viral vector. by about  <dig> dpi the systemic infection was well established, and very little non-gfp expressing systemic plant tissue was observed. the image in figure 3c represents a typical n. benthamiana plant in which one leaf was co-infiltrated with a.t./pjl43:gfp and a.t./pjl3:p <dig> cultures. the photo was taken  <dig> dpi under uv illumination. similar results were obtained with leaves infiltrated with a.t./pjl36:gfp cell suspensions . pjl36:gfp contains the gfp gene cloned into the paci and avrii sites of pjl <dig> 

temporal analysis of recombinant protein expression from a tmv vector
to better examine the kinetics of recombinant protein expression from the tmv vector we prepared total soluble protein extracts from a. tumefaciens/pjl43:gfp + a. tumefaciens/pjl3:p <dig> infiltrated tissue from 3– <dig> dpi. protein samples were also prepared from systemically infected plant tissue , to allow comparison of the amount of gfp produced in infiltrated vs. systemically infected plant tissue. protein extract samples were separated on sds page gels and stained with coomassie blue protein stain. results are shown in figure  <dig>  recombinant gfp expression in infiltrated tissue increased up to about 4– <dig> dpi. also the maximal gfp expression level observed in infiltrated tissue was comparable to the levels obtained in systemically infected leaves.

comparison of tmv expression vector with other transient expression systems
an 'enhanced' agrobacterium mediated transient expression system has been described in which a 35s promoter driven gene-of-interest is co-introduced into cells along with a 35s driven p <dig> gene from tbsv  <cit> . the ectopic expression of the rna silencing suppressor p <dig> dramatically enhanced the amount of recombinant protein produced from the 35s: gene-of-interest t-dna. as a result, this approach is perhaps the most common method for transiently expressing proteins in plants. therefore we sought to compare the relative expression efficiencies of this method with the tmv vector we constructed. a. tumefaciens cultures with plasmids pcb:gfp or pjl3:p <dig> were mixed and co-infiltrated into n. benthamiana leaves . other leaves were co-infiltrated with a mixture of a. tumefaciens cultures containing pjl3:p <dig> or pjl43:gfp plasmids . total soluble protein was extracted from infiltrated leaf tissue at  <dig> days post infiltration. the levels of gfp in extracts was determined by a plate-based fluorescence activity assay. the results revealed that the tmv based expression vector produced from  <dig> to  <dig> times more gfp than was expressed from 35s promoter driven gfp t-dna co-infiltrated with the 35s driven p <dig> gene .

discussion
recently it has been demonstrated that ectopic expression of proteins with rna silencing suppressor activity increased  the agroinfection rates of byv <cit>  and cmv  <cit>  vectors. here we describe the construction of a new tmv vector that can be delivered by agroinfection and demonstrate that the rna silencing suppressor protein p <dig> from tbsv can improve the agroinfectivity of tmv-based expression vectors. the agroinfection rate of the 35s driven tmv vector has been increased so much that coomassie blue stainable levels of tmv-expressed recombinant protein can be detected in crude protein extracts from agroinfiltrated tissue approximately  <dig> days post infiltration. this improvement eliminates the need for waiting for the tmv vector to move systemically in the inoculated plants.

because tmv is a rod-shaped virus, there is no theoretical limit on the size of the foreign gene that can be inserted into a tmv vector. however, in practice, when plant virus vectors containing foreign inserts move systemically in plants they can lose the foreign insert. the larger the insert the more likely that insert loss will be a problem  <cit> . the ability to purify recombinant proteins from infiltrated tissue rather than tissue systemically infected by a viral vector is expected allow larger proteins to be reliably expressed from tmv vectors without concerns about insert stability in the virus. furthermore we demonstrate that our a. tumefaciens delivered tmv vector, produced from  <dig> to  <dig> times more gfp than was obtained from the 'enhanced' agrobacterium transient expression system in which both gfp and p <dig> are co-expressed from 35s promoters  <cit> .

the efficiency of tmv vector agroinfection we have obtained  appears to be comparable to the tmv vector agroinfection efficiencies recently reported by others  <cit> . however, it is important to note their vector lacked the tmv cp gene, and was therefore not capable of moving systemically in plants. in their approach to improving tmv vector agroinfection rates, marillonnet et al  <cit>  both removed potential cryptic introns  and inserted introns into the viral cdna. their final optimized construct had multiple silent mutations and  <dig> introns inserted into the viral cdna  <cit> . in this paper we demonstrate that it is possible to dramatically improve agroinfection efficiency of a tmv vector without destroying cryptic introns or introducing foreign introns into the tmv cdna. it is interesting that these two different approaches could both be used to improve the agroinfectivity of a tmv vector. one explanation of this phenomenon is that these two approaches are mechanistically related, as discussed below.

in our current model we hypothesize that wild-type tmv rna generated from a t-dna in a plant nucleus is often spliced resulting in the removal of critical viral rna sequences from the genome. as a result tmv rnas that are not capable of self-replication are often exported to the plant cytoplasm where they are processed by the cells rna silencing machinery. rna silencing  is a well-reviewed topic . briefly, in plants small rnas of about  <dig> nts in length associate with a protein complex called risc  that has nuclease activity. the small rnas associated with risc serve to guide the nuclease to specific rna targets through base-pairing whereupon the target rna is cleaved. the small "guide" rnas are generated by cellular dicer-like enzymes, that cleave ds rnas into duplexes of about  <dig> nt. the tmv-derived rnas exported from the plant nucleus in our system may serve as dicer substrates either because they have regions of secondary structure, and/or the rnas are converted to dsrnas by the activity of cellular rna dependent rna polymerases  <cit> . regardless of the exact pathway our model proposes that short rnas  produced primarily from defective tmv rna sequences are used to program the cellular risc  to target tmv rnas for degradation. as a result when the occasional full-length tmv rna, which was fortuitously not spliced at cryptic introns, was exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm it was degraded by a tmv-specific risc.

when p <dig> is expressed in the plant cell the p <dig> protein binds  <dig> nt duplex rnas  <cit> , preventing them from being incorporated into riscs. as a result in these plant cells when the occasional full length tmv rna transcript does enter the cytoplasm it has a greater potential to be translated and initiate self-replication before it is degraded. it is proposed that this is why the p <dig> protein enhances agroinfection efficiency of a wild-type tmv cdna.

in contrast, the intron-modified tmv cdna generated by marillonet et al  <cit>  must have resulted in a higher percentage of replication-competent tmv rnas being exported into the cytoplasm. as a result tmv self-replication was often established with this vector before the tmv-targeted risc was generated in the plant. in this model these two approaches for enhancing the agroinfectivity of a tmv cdna are complementary. one would therefore predict that the two methods could be combined to obtain even higher agroinfection rates of the 35s-driven tmv clones. also this model would predict that agroinfection rates of 35s promoter driven tmv  cdnas would be higher in plants mutant for certain genes in the rna silencing pathway, and that the ectopic expression of multiple, different, rna silencing suppressor proteins may further increase agroinfectivity of these vectors.

CONCLUSIONS
a simple, cost effective, and efficient way to infect plants with tmv vectors via agroinfection was identified. recombinant protein expression levels of approximately  <dig> to  <dig> micrograms per gram of a. tumefaciens infiltrated plant tissue were obtained. recombinant protein can be recovered from both locally inoculated leaves or from systemically infected plant tissue. these improvements should enable researchers with little or no experience with plant virus vectors to easily utilize tmv expression vectors in their research. the vector improvements described here will be especially useful in high-throughput research projects.
