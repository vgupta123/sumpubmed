BACKGROUND
wheat yellow rust, also known as stripe rust, is one of the most devastating diseases of wheat worldwide. it is caused by the basidiomycete fungus puccinia striiformis westend. f. sp. tritici eriks. , an obligate pathogen that along with the stem  rust fungus puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici  threatens worldwide wheat production  <cit> . historically, the use of major race specific resistance  genes in wheat varieties has been an effective method for disease management. however, these approaches are hampered by the evolution of resistance-breaking races of pst. for example, the appearance of pst races that overcome widely deployed r genes  has led to destructive pandemics  <cit> . in recent years, concerns over yellow rust have increased with the emergence of new and more aggressive pst races that have expanded virulence profiles and are capable of adapting to warmer temperatures compared to most previous races  <cit> . combined with the intrinsic ability of pst for long distance spore dispersal  <cit> , these new races pose an increasing threat to global wheat production and food security  <cit> .

biotrophic plant pathogens such as rust pathogens secrete an array of proteins, known as effectors, to modulate plant innate immunity and enable parasitic infection  <cit> . some of these effectors translocate inside plant cells probably through specialized infection structures known as haustoria  <cit> . inside plant cells, effectors perturb host processes promoting pathogenesis. however, disease resistance genes in plants, known as r genes, encode immunoreceptors that recognize specific pathogen effector proteins. once effector proteins are recognized, plants initiate an immune response to block the development of disease, which typically results in a localized hypersensitive reaction and programmed cell death  <cit> . the identification and characterization of these effectors and their cognate r genes is an important first step to understanding the wheat-pst pathosystem and consequently, to our ability to develop sustainable and potentially more durable resistance breeding strategies.

recent availability of rust pathogen genome sequences has enabled the first steps towards wide-scale cataloguing of putative effector proteins. for instance, saunders et al.  <cit>  and duplessis et al.  <cit>  both implemented high throughput computational methods to characterize the effector complements from the fully sequenced rust fungi pgt and melampsora larici-populina. recently, cantu et al.  <cit>  used next-generation sequencing  to assemble a draft genome of pst isolate  <dig> , annotating  <dig>  putative coding sequences and classifying  <dig>  of these as predicted secreted proteins. in addition, resources such as cdna libraries generated from urediniospores and isolated haustoria  are publicly available. together, they provide the necessary tools to develop a framework for characterization of the putative effector repertoire of pst.

the rapid decrease in sequencing costs now makes it possible to re-sequence multiple pst isolates to further characterize its pathogenicity arsenal. for instance, comparative genome analyses of different isolates of magnaporthe oryzae, the rice blast pathogen, expanded the knowledge gained from the original reference genome considerably and helped to identify new effector genes with avirulence activity  <cit> . similarly, genomic analysis of an epidemic isolate of the potato blight pathogen phytophthora infestans provided insights into increased aggressiveness and virulence  <cit> .

in this study, we re-sequenced four pst isolates with different virulence profiles and from two distinct geographical regions . we identified hetero- and homokaryotic snps, providing a first glimpse into pst genetic diversity on a genome wide scale. we performed independent gene discovery and annotation across all isolates to produce a combined pst secretome and identified haustoria-enriched transcripts. we validated the expression of a subset of genes during an infection time course, and revealed distinct temporal expression patterns among them. this data was then integrated using a modified version of the in silico pipeline described in saunders et al.  <cit>  to classify the putative effector repertoire of pst. using this information, we identified putative secreted, haustoria-enriched proteins with non-synonymous polymorphisms specifically between the two uk isolates, which only differ in virulence to two known wheat differential varieties. this approach identified five effector candidates among  <dig>  predicted secreted proteins that are highly expressed in haustoria and are polymorphic between the uk isolates, pst-87/ <dig> and pst-08/ <dig>  these allelic variants are now a priority for functional validation as virulence/avirulence effectors in the corresponding wheat varieties.

RESULTS
selecting pst isolates with distinct virulence profiles
four pst isolates from different races with distinct virulence profiles and varied geographic origin were selected for genome sequencing . all isolates were initially identified on wheat plants, except pst- <dig>  this isolate was originally isolated from infected triticale plants, but was subsequently shown to be virulent on wheat plants carrying the yr <dig> resistance gene  <cit> . the virulence profiles of the two uk isolates  were examined on a set of european differential lines, complemented by a common set of avocet ‘s’ near isogenic lines, and compared to the previously reported profiles for the us isolates   <cit> . the two uk isolates differed in their virulence to wheat varieties robigus  and solstice , but had common virulence to ten yr genes.

genome sequencing, quality assessment, and gene prediction
we used an illumina whole-genome shotgun sequencing approach to sequence four pst isolates in addition to the recently sequenced isolate pst- <dig>  <cit> . after filtering , the total number of pst contigs assembled ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . to assess the completeness of the genome sequences, we aligned the reads to the previously assembled pst- <dig> contigs  <cit> . a large proportion of the reads from the newly sequenced pst isolates aligned to the assembled pst- <dig> contigs , suggesting that most of the pst genome is present in the pst- <dig> assembly and confirming previous estimates of pst genome size  <cit> . in addition, a large fraction of publically available pst expressed sequenced tags  mapped onto the assembled contigs, ranging from  <dig> % in pst-87/ <dig> to  <dig> % in pst- <dig>  further supporting a high degree of completeness of the genome assemblies. taken together, these data suggest the us and uk isolates include between  <dig> and 88% of the rust genome.

a previously sequenced isolate  <cit> .

as an independent estimate of the degree of completeness of the assembled gene space, we implemented cegma analysis  <cit> . this protocol maps a set of  <dig> low copy core eukaryotic genes  that are conserved across higher eukaryotes to the assemblies  <cit> . on average  <dig> %  of the cegs aligned as complete gene copies to the assembled contigs , compared to  <dig> %  that aligned as fragmented partial gene copies . these values are slightly lower than those of the whole genome sequence of p. graminis f.sp. tritici where  <dig> % of the cegs were mapped as complete copies and  <dig> % as fragmented genes . the levels of complete gene coverage were higher for all us isolates  and comparable to partial gene coverage , indicating that few core eukaryotic genes were split across contigs for these isolates. for the two uk isolates  complete gene coverage was reduced  compared to partial gene coverage , indicating slightly higher levels of fragmentation for these genomes, which is likely attributed to the lower level of genome coverage for these isolates.

to identify open reading frames in the five assembled pst genomes, we applied the maker pipeline which used ab initio and homology based predictions and was supported by cdna evidence generated in the course of this study . on average  <dig>   protein-coding genes were identified in the five isolates . over 90% of the extended cegma set, which includes  <dig>  ceg variants from six eukaryotic genomes, matched peptides predicted in each of the assemblies, with an average of  <dig> % of the protein length aligned . this provided an independent estimate of the completeness of the gene catalogue.

estimation of diversity between pst isolates
urediniospores constitute asexual dikaryotic spores that contain two independent nuclei. therefore, to assess genetic variation between the two nuclei in the sequenced pst urediniospores we aligned the sequence reads of a particular isolate to the assembled contigs of the same isolate. this global analysis identified an average single nucleotide polymorphism  frequency of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  snps/kb between the two nuclei within a single isolate, referred hereafter as intra-isolate snps .

in addition, we aligned the reads of each isolate to the assembled contigs of the other isolates . we classified these inter-isolate snps into two classes; heterokaryotic snps which refers to a variant position between the two nuclei within a single isolate that is homozygous in other isolates, and homokaryotic snps, which refer to homozygous variants that are polymorphic between two independent isolates . on average, heterokaryotic snps across isolates were more frequent  than homokaryotic snps . the highest levels of diversity were found when reads of isolates pst- <dig> and pst- <dig> were mapped onto the two uk isolates  and us pst- <dig>  here, we observed an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  snps/kb for heterokaryotic sites, whereas homokaryotic snps had a frequency of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  snps/kb. when the two uk isolates and pst- <dig> were compared, the heterokaryotic snp frequency was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  snps/kb, whereas the homokaryotic snp frequency was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  snps/kb . we performed a phylogenetic analysis using the homokaryotic snp data in both coding and non-coding regions. in the associated dendrograms, us isolate pst- <dig> clustered with the two uk isolates, pst-87/ <dig> and pst-08/ <dig> . pst <dig> was more closely related to pst <dig> than to the other three isolates, and both where equally distant to the pst-43/uk cluster.

observed genetic diversity may reflect origin of isolates
to further characterize the genetic diversity between the five sequenced isolates of pst, we assessed the number of homokaryotic snps within the gene space . using this snp data, we generated a set of four representative synthetic genes for each reference gene that incorporated the snp information independently for each isolate to enable downstream analysis of genetic diversity . pair-wise comparisons of non-synonymous mutations in these gene sets revealed that when genes representing us isolates pst- <dig> and pst- <dig> were compared against other isolates, polymorphisms were more apparent . for instance, when using the pst- <dig> genes as a reference, pst- <dig> showed between  <dig>  and  <dig>  polymorphic genes in pair-wise comparisons with all other isolates. similarly, pst- <dig> showed between  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  polymorphic genes in pair-wise comparisons with all other isolates, when using this same reference. in contrast, in pairwise comparisons between pst- <dig>  pst-87/ <dig> and pst-08/ <dig> less than  <dig> genes were shown to be polymorphic when using the pst- <dig> genes as the reference .

enrichment in non-synonymous mutations between genes encoding predicted secreted proteins and non-secreted proteins was assessed using the hypergeometric test. this analysis revealed enrichment in polymorphisms in secreted proteins for nine pairwise comparisons with eight originating from comparisons of pst- <dig> or pst- <dig> against other isolates . we also calculated rates of synonymous  and non-synonymous  substitutions for each pairwise comparison in each synthetic gene set . this analysis highlighted more genes with dn/ds >  <dig> when pst- <dig> and pst- <dig> were compared with all other isolates, mirroring the pattern shown in the sequence polymorphism analysis . for example, for protein pst21_ <dig> sequence polymorphisms and positive selection were identified between the uk isolates and us pst- <dig> when compared to the synthetic gene from us pst- <dig> . there was no evidence for enrichment in positive selection in genes encoding secreted proteins when compared to those encoding non-secreted proteins.

another measure of genetic diversity is to assess the number of absent genes in pair-wise comparisons between isolates. the total number of genes classified as absent with no reads aligned, was greater for alignments against the two us isolates pst- <dig>  and pst- <dig>  when compared to us pst- <dig>  uk pst-87/ <dig> and uk pst-08/ <dig>  less than  <dig> genes were shown to be absent in pst- <dig>  pst-87/ <dig> and pst-08/ <dig> when alignments between these isolates were considered . reciprocally, when pst- <dig> or pst- <dig> sequence reads were mapped against the genome assemblies of the other three isolates , a greater number of genes were noted as absent when compared to the alignment of the other three isolates . a similar pattern was also observed when genes encoding predicted secreted proteins were assessed .

this analysis confirmed our previous observation that us pst- <dig> and pst- <dig> appear more genetically diverse when compared to other isolates in this study, potentially reflecting different evolutionary origins for these isolates. the observed genetic diversity for us pst- <dig> may reflect adaptation to a different host, triticale, when compared to isolates in this study that were isolated specifically from wheat.

rna-seq analysis identified transcripts specifically enriched in haustoria
we performed rnaseq analysis of uk pst-08/ <dig> infected wheat leaves and isolated haustoria to identify haustoria-enriched transcripts . after filtering, we aligned reads to the pst-08/ <dig> assembly and also generated de novo assemblies that were used to support the gene prediction pipeline. we conducted differential expression analysis after normalization, using deseq to identify genes that were significantly up-regulated  in haustoria compared to infected tissue . within the subset of transcripts encoding for predicted secreted proteins , we identified  <dig> genes that were significantly enriched in haustoria , compared to  <dig>  that were significantly depleted . a much lower proportion of genes encoding for non-secreted proteins was identified as enriched  or depleted  using the same analysis . these results suggest that this approach is effective in selectively enriching for secreted proteins, which are likely to be haustorial-expressed transcripts.

defining and classifying the effector repertoire of pst
to identify and classify candidate effectors from pst, we implemented a modified version of the bioinformatics pipeline described in saunders et al.  <cit>  . the five pst proteomes were combined ,  <dig>  secreted proteins predicted, and redundancy in the combined secretome reduced . after consolidation, a total of  <dig>  predicted secreted proteins were selected representing the diversity of the five pst secretomes . to enable the identification of any potential conserved rust effectors, secreted proteins were also classified and incorporated in this study from the proteomes of puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici and melampsora larici-populina, comprising  <dig>  and  <dig>  secreted proteins, respectively. the three rust pathogen secretomes were combined and grouped into  <dig>  protein tribes based on sequence similarity using markov clustering  <cit> . the final filtering step of the bioinformatics pipeline reduced the total to  <dig>  tribes, each containing at least one pst secreted protein. proteins in the  <dig>  pst-containing tribes were then annotated with both known effector features from other pathosystems and pst-specific criteria . the later criteria focused on allelic variation between the five pst isolates and the expression of genes at the plant-pathogen interface as determined by the rna-seq analysis of pst-08/21-infected wheat leaves and isolated haustoria. expression of genes either during infection or specifically in haustoria was then added as criterion in the effector-mining pipeline .

identifying candidate effectors of high interest
to order and cluster protein tribes based on known effector features and pst-specific annotation we implemented the sorting module of the pipeline . this resulted in overall scores for each tribe that reflected their likelihood of containing potential effector proteins . the features associated with the top  <dig> ranked tribes are displayed in figure  <dig> 

to select proteins with a high likelihood as candidate effectors we focused on tribes that ranked highly based on our scoring system, are highly expressed and enriched in haustoria, and display sequence polymorphisms between isolates. for example, tribe  <dig> is ranked 10th in our scoring system and is a member of cluster vii, which reflects the fact that both members, pst21_ <dig> and pst21_ <dig>  are expressed highly in haustoria and are significantly enriched in haustoria with respect to infected tissue . this tribe represents two distinct proteins that are present in all isolates sequenced in this study. one protein was identified as polymorphic specifically between the us isolates, whereas the second protein was conserved across all isolates . the two proteins are encoded by genes within close proximity on a single contig in the sequenced genomes . this suggests that these genes could have arisen from a duplication event, which is further supported by sequence similarity between the two proteins within the n-terminus. this is consistent with the concept that pathogenicity factors may arise from gene duplication events followed by rapid diversification to evolve new functions  <cit> .

candidate effectors with sequence polymorphisms between the uk isolates pst-08/ <dig> and pst-87/7
we identified secreted proteins that displayed polymorphisms specifically between the two uk isolates pst-87/ <dig> and pst-08/ <dig>  which only differ in virulence to two wheat differential varieties robigus  and solstice . the properties of the  <dig> proteins identified are displayed in figure 5d. of these  <dig> proteins,  <dig> were members of tribes that ranked in the top  <dig> in our scoring system and five were encoded by genes which were significantly enriched and in the top 10% of expressed transcripts in both haustorial samples . for all five genes a single amino acid substitution was evident between the sequences for the two uk isolates. for example, for pst130_ <dig>  four amino acid substitutions were identified; one differential between the uk and us isolates, two between uk isolates and us pst- <dig> when compared to the other us isolates, and one specific substitution between the two uk isolates . focusing on proteins that display polymorphisms between these two isolates may facilitate the detection of avirulence and corresponding virulence effector proteins that are specifically differentially recognized by yrrob and yrsol.

transcript profiling reveals peaks in gene expression for candidate effectors during infection
to further characterize a subset of candidate effectors, we assessed their expression profiles using quantitative rt-pcr across different infection time points ) . twenty-two putative effectors representing nineteen tribes were selected based on their rank as likely effectors and their expression levels determined by mrnaseq analysis of isolated haustoria . the gene models of these effector candidates were further validated during the qrt-pcr analysis using primers that spanned the splice site junctions.

dpi, days post-inoculation.

three peaks in expression were observed for the candidate effectors using qrt-pcr, with eight more highly expressed at  <dig> dpi, four at  <dig> dpi and nine at  <dig> dpi . haustoria are already formed at  <dig> dpi  <cit>  suggesting that some of these candidate effectors might be involved in the very early stages of infection. two of the five haustoria-enriched polymorphic genes between the uk isolates were amongst those most highly expressed at  <dig> dpi , whereas one showed highest expression at  <dig> dpi . only one candidate effector  was stably expressed at all time-points assessed during infection. for tribes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the expression profiles of several members of each tribe were assessed. with the exception of one member of tribe  <dig> , members of the same tribe tended to peak in expression at the same time-point, indicating that they may be involved at similar stages during disease progression. these results are consistent with the concept of sequential waves of expression of different sets of effectors during the infection process  <cit> .

discussion
polymorphic secreted proteins as effector candidates
in this study, we re-sequenced four pst isolates to identify effector candidates and relate them to their distinct virulence profiles. once the complete effector complement was defined, we focused on highlighting polymorphic effector candidates that may reflect rapid adaptation to specific host targets, such as disease-resistance proteins amongst others. the list of effector candidates we developed here should prove useful to the rust research community to initiate functional screens for effector activity. one possible strategy would be the induction of hypersensitive cell death by potential avirulence proteins  on differential wheat lines using an effector delivery system as is routinely conducted in the potato-p. infestans pathosystem  <cit> .

the co-evolutionary arms race between pathogens and plants has led pathogens to respond by mutating or losing avr effector proteins  <cit> . a survey of six melampsora lini isolates identified diversifying selection acting on the avr <dig> locus, with substitutions identified in surface exposed residues that dictated host recognition  <cit> . likewise, yoshida et al.  <cit>  identified three novel avr genes that were absent from the m. oryzae genome sequence  but present in the re-sequenced avirulent isolate ina <dig>  in pst, we did not find evidence of large scale absence of genes or putative effectors on the scale identified in m. oryzae <cit> . even when comparing between the most distantly related isolates, we found less than  <dig> predicted secreted protein genes to be absent in any pairwise comparisons . although this is a first and limited sampling of the available pst diversity, it suggests that gene loss may not be the main driver for changes in virulence. therefore, assessing allelic variation in putative effectors between distinct pst isolates will likely be important to identify avirulence/virulence alleles.

uncovering the evolutionary origin of pst isolates
comparative genomic studies are powerful tools for assessing the evolutionary origin of particular races. in this study, the limited genetic diversity found between us isolate pst- <dig> and the two uk isolates, pst-87/ <dig> and pst-08/ <dig>  could be indicative of these isolates belonging to the same clonal lineage. this is supported by a diversity study based on  <dig> amplified fragment length polymorphism  fragments which showed that pst isolates collected before  <dig> in the us and europe clustered together  <cit> , thereby suggesting a common origin. interestingly, the two uk isolates used in this study were collected after  <dig> , yet still cluster with the older us race. this agrees with virulence data which suggests that despite the emergence of new highly aggressive isolates after  <dig> in some european countries , these have not yet appeared in uk fields . conversely, differences between races can reflect diverse evolutionary origins or host specificity. in this study, us isolates pst- <dig> and pst- <dig> appear more genetically diverse when compared to the other isolates we sequenced. this is supported by studies showing that us races isolated post- <dig>  such as pst- <dig>  may have a different origin than those isolated pre- <dig>  <cit>  and that pst- <dig> displays host specificity for triticale  <cit> . the data generated is not only valuable for addressing these evolutionary questions, but can also be used by the wider rust research community for development of more extensive polymorphic markers for large-scale screening of pst field populations and to complement the current set of dominant aflp markers.

utility of haustoria-enriched transcripts in effector mining
as biotrophic fungi and oomycetes secrete effectors from highly specialized structures, known as haustoria, we also undertook transcriptome analyses of infected tissues and isolated pst haustoria to identify potential avr genes. for example, sequencing ests from m. lini isolated haustoria led to the identification of three uncharacterized avr genes  <cit> , suggesting that haustorial expressed transcripts represent a rich source for avr effector identification. to identify haustoria enriched transcripts, we compared gene expression levels between infected material and isolated haustoria. although rnaseq analysis of infected material was limited to a single biological replicate, we used the deseq approach  <cit>  to assess enrichment as this package is suited for working with partial replicates  <cit> . this enabled us to estimate levels of variation in the infected material sample based on that observed in the replicated haustoria samples. despite the low power of detection with this approach we could identify haustoria enriched genes with sufficient confidence. these transcriptome results helped to further classify and prioritize the pst secretome. it also establishes a robust baseline from which to extend this analysis to other isolates.

improving existing pst gene models
an additional contribution of the expression studies was to generate more reliable pst gene models, which is critical to identify genes encoding for proteins with secretion signal peptide sequences. this was especially relevant for the downstream effector prediction pipeline since this constitutes the first criteria with which proteins are classified and filtered. we addressed this potential limitation by firstly complementing the homology based and ab initio prediction pipeline  <cit>  with the de novo transcript assemblies generated from the rnaseq data and secondly, by integrating independent gene predictions from all isolates. whilst assessing the independent gene sets obtained for the different isolates we noted that for many fragmented genes, a non-fragmented copy could be identified in at least one genome. therefore, it is anticipated that the gene catalog presented here will be a better representation of the pst gene complement, than the previous one which was based on genomic sequences alone  <cit> . the overall accuracy of the gene predictions herein were also supported by the identification of higher frequencies in nucleotide variants in the intronic regions than in the exons for both heterokaryotic and homokaryotic snps .

applying comparative genomics to effector mining
the recent release of draft genome sequences for several rust pathogens has provided the first step towards wide-scale cataloguing of putative effector proteins  <cit> . so far, these studies have been limited to secretome prediction and annotation from a single reference genome. here, we employed a comparative genomics approach to move beyond the single isolate-directed catalogue and utilise the distinct virulence profiles of the isolates sequenced to identify putative virulence/avirulence effectors. our aim was to integrate genomics, transcriptomics and effector-focused annotation to generate a rich source of information that could be utilized to identify effector candidates in pst. however, this raises the challenge of developing methods that can utilize the vast abundance of data to address clearly defined biological questions. the clustering and classification methods used here allowed us to organize the complexity of these large datasets. providing the data in an easily comprehensible format  will enhance accessibility and help the wider rust research community to rapidly access effector candidates. moreover, this method provides a logical framework to prioritize candidate effector genes for functional validation, an approach that will become increasingly powerful as additional races are re-sequenced, more mrnaseq data becomes available and the avirulence activity of candidate effectors is established.

the use of association analysis to identify candidate avirulence proteins has been successfully implemented in other pathosystems  <cit> . as a first step in this direction, we examined two uk isolates  that share common virulence for ten wheat yr genes , but differ in their ability to infect two uk varieties, robigus  and solstice . we found no evidence of gene loss between these isolates. however, focusing on polymorphic variants that were also highly expressed and enriched in haustoria  reduced the dataset from  <dig>  secreted proteins to just five polymorphic effector candidates. these genes and their allelic variants are now a priority for functional validation as virulence/avirulence effectors in the wheat varieties robigus and solstice.

the next challenge – functional validation of effector candidates
the next step will be to establish functional validation methods for rust effectors in wheat. this crucial phase is still in its infancy  <cit>  and will most likely be limited to testing a handful of candidate genes in the initial stages. several groups have attempted to modify existing heterologous expression systems from other pathosystems to establish a reliable method for testing rust avr effector candidates in wheat. this includes delivery of effector candidates directly into wheat cells by expressing them in bacterial pathogens for delivery by the type iii secretion system  <cit>  or through virus-mediated approaches  <cit> . alternatively, host-induced gene silencing could be utilized to transiently silence and test pst pathogenicity or virulence genes. recently, silencing of three endogenous genes in puccinia triticina, the wheat leaf rust pathogen, was reported using transient agrobacterium-mediated expression of corresponding rnai constructs in wheat  <cit> . if established as a large-scale functional assay system, transient expression could be utilized to enable high-throughput loss-of-function screening of a diverse array of pst effector candidates in wheat.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides valuable information including  an estimate of the distribution of genetic diversity within and among pst isolates,  characterization of the expression of pst genes in infected tissue and haustoria using rnaseq analysis,  a bioinformatics pipeline to organize and prioritize candidate effector genes for functional studies and  a list of candidate avirulence genes which display polymorphisms specifically between two uk isolates. as additional races and divergent isolates are re-sequenced, polymorphic effectors will be more easily distinguished from underlying genetic diversity between isolates, streamlining the cataloging of potential avirulence/virulence proteins for testing. the functional validation of these will ultimately lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the pst pathogenesis system, an important step towards developing more effective surveillance and management strategies for one of the most devastating pathogens of wheat.
