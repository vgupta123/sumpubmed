BACKGROUND
during the last decades, growth performance traits were the main driver for the genetic selection programs applied for broilers. this already underscores the importance of genetic factors contributing to this important economic trait for poultry production. more recently the knowledge that intestinal microbiota also play a key role in growth-related traits such as feed digestibility, feed uptake, protein fermentation, but also in health related traits such as immune competence and immune tolerance. for human and mice data have been described that suggest a role for early-life colonizing microbiota in host immune programming , yet for chicken such data are lacking. furthermore the impact of genotypic variation on early life microbial colonization in relation to the functional development of the gut is largely unknown. in fact, the gut microbiota is regarded a metabolic powerhouse that provides the functionally limited host with an extensive array of enzymes and substrates required for growth. it has been shown that gut microbiota can influence energy retention and can predispose to obesity  <cit> . additionally, they play a role in the renewal of gut epithelial cells and its barrier function  <cit> , the breakdown of toxins  <cit> , the exclusion of pathogens  <cit> , and the programming and development of the immune system  <cit> . the aim of this research was to investigate the impact of genetic background of these broiler lines on the microbial colonization and the development of the small intestine in early life.

in chickens, microbiota colonization occurs immediately after hatch, both microbiota from the egg shell and environment form the first inoculum of the chickens  <cit> . the characteristics of this first inoculum is of utmost importance because it impacts the further colonization of microbiota and simultaneously the functional development of the intestinal tissue in terms of barrier function and in terms of immune programming  <cit> . it has been shown that around day  <dig> of age a presumably more stable microbiota is not yet established  <cit> , however, immunological development in the small intestine has already occurred . around day  <dig>  intestinal segments have different functional properties and harbour distinctive microbiota compositions  <cit> .

in chickens, not much is known about the effect of host genetic background on microbial colonisation and microbiota composition. it has, however, been shown that high variation occurs in microbial composition between individual chickens and flocks of genetically closely related animals  <cit> . for mice it has been demonstrated that the host genetic background has impact on the microbiota composition in the gut  <cit> . however, it still difficult to disentangle the relationship between host genetic factors and the microbiota composition directly  <cit> . nevertheless, first attempts have been made in mice to search for quantitative trait loci  associated to the presence and/or abundance of specific bacterial species or taxa and evidence is provided that host genetic control occurs in shaping the microbiota composition  <cit> .

in poultry, not much is known about the effect of the genetic background on intestinal immune development. it is known that at hatch the innate and adaptive immune systems are immature and functional maturation occurs mainly the first 2 weeks of life in broilers  <cit> . the innate immunity is the first line of defence, which includes the barrier function , complement and coagulation cascade, phagocytes , natural killer cells, and dendritic cells. besides the role of the epithelial layer being the first line of defence against invading pathogens, these cells also play an important role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis by integration of microbial signals . the adaptive immune system is also described as the acquired immune system, in which memory cells are generated after the initial challenge with an antigen. these memory cells facilitate a more efficient and faster response upon subsequent challenges with the same antigen.

it has been shown that restricting microbial exposure of chicken during early life has impact on mucin production  <cit> . mucins are key components of epithelial layers, serving functions from lubrication to cell signalling to forming barriers to chemicals and pathogens. these observations already imply that bacterial colonization and critical aspects of gut  homeostasis and/or barrier functions are intertwined with each other. furthermore, studies on the effects of different pig rearing environments showed a negative effect of more ‘hygienic’ environments during early life on immune development  <cit> . similarly, early life use of antibiotics in piglets has been shown to alter microbiota colonization as well as immune development  <cit> . it is proposed that a proper immune development requires colonization with “natural” microbiota present in the future environment  <cit> .

the objective of this study was to investigate the impact of genetic background on both early microbial colonization of the gut in combination with functional development of intestinal tissue. to accomplish this, community-scale analysis of gut lumen microbiota and genome-wide transcriptome profiling of intestinal tissue was used. in this study we compared two genetically divergent chicken lines that differ from each other in health  related phenotypes, in particular in bacterial infections and the related pathology and severity of such induced diseases by differing in immune response against salmonella enteritidis, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and campylobacter jejuni . the justification for using these selected lines was that they had known differences in susceptibility towards bacterial infections and thus may differ as well in the basic level of immune competence. to identify similar and dissimilar functional processes in time between the two chicken lines, the temporal gene expression profiles were analysed in more detail.

RESULTS
performance data
body weight  and feed conversion ratio  were measured in time, in order to generate a representative view of the whole life of a broiler. no statistical significant differences were observed per time-period between lines x and y for both body weight and fcr. body weight increased from approximately  <dig> grams on day  <dig> to approximately  <dig>  kg on day  <dig>  the fcr was slightly higher in line x compared to line y at each time-point.fig.  <dig> boxplot of body weight in time for each chicken line. on the x-axis the lines x and y and the days are depicted and the y-axis shows the body weight in kilograms. the letters x and y stand for the chicken line and the numbers for the age in days



microbiota analyses
to investigate the differences between the two broiler lines regarding their microbiota, both redundancy  and diversity analyses  were performed. the redundancy analysis showed that the primary discriminant on the microbiota composition between the two genetically different broiler lines was the factor time, and secondary was the influence of genotype. an anova permutation test for rda under a reduced model, where terms were added sequentially  showed that age, line, and age:line were all significant, p-values  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively.fig.  <dig> redundancy analysis of jejunal microbiota composition  on day  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  each symbol represents a pool of  <dig> chickens and represents their average microbiota composition. the data are represented as follows, for line x day  <dig> , day  <dig> , day  <dig>  and for line y day  <dig> , day  <dig> , day  <dig>

in the diversity analysis, which was calculated by the shannon-index, we observed an increase in time of the microbiota diversity for each chicken line. however, no statistically significant differences were observed between the lines, in other words similar levels of diversity were observed between the two lines .

to investigate to what extent the relative abundance of specific bacterial species were different between the chicken lines, averages of microbial families and/or species were calculated for each time-point separately . at day  <dig> lines x and y have different abundance levels of the  <dig> to  <dig> most dominant bacterial genera, enterococci, escherichia and lactobacilli. day  <dig> after hatch shows that the abundance of bacterial genera are more closely together, and the highest abundance is of lactobacilli, 88 % average relative contribution  in line x and  <dig>  % arc in line y. also at day  <dig> similar arc abundance at the bacterial genera level were observed between lines x and y, however line y had two specific genera, enterococci and escherichia, which were markedly higher compared to line x. yet line x displayed overall higher arc in various bacterial genera.table  <dig> most abundant microbiotaa between lines x and y

transcriptome analyses
first an explorative principal component analysis  was performed, in which the different time-points and broiler lines could be separated . in this analysis only the first two components were taken into consideration, because the variance explained was already  <dig>  %. this pca shows a convergence in overall gene expression in time between the two lines. at day  <dig>  lines x and y are clearly separated on both principal component  <dig>  and pc <dig>  whereas on day  <dig> and  <dig> separation of the two lines was mainly on pc <dig> fig.  <dig> principal components analysis of jejunal transcriptomics data of chicken lines x and y. each symbol represents whole-genome gene expression data  of a pool of  <dig> chickens. the data are represented as follows, for line x  day  <dig> , day  <dig> , day  <dig>  and for line y  day  <dig> , day  <dig> , day  <dig> 



to get more insight into differentially expressed genes between the two lines on each time-point, statistical testing by limma was performed in which up- and down-regulation was also taken into account . subsequent to the limma analysis, functional annotation clustering  was performed to highlight particular processes that differ between lines x and y . all enrichment scores  above  <dig>  of a particular functional annotation cluster were taken into account for day  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> separately. each ‘enriched’ cluster was summarized manually into two-three representative keywords describing the generic term .table  <dig> differential expression between groups and corresponding functional annotation clustering

discussion
in this study two genetically different broiler lines were compared, which were known to differ in their immunological responses towards bacterial infections and the pathology and severity of the induced diseases . however, these broiler lines did not differ in any growth characteristics. thus these broiler lines may differ in the basic level of immune competence. currently it is not known on what level the two lines deviate from each other and what the underlying mechanisms are for their difference in immunological properties. it is known that programming of the innate as well as the adaptive immune system occurs mainly at young age and the microbial species in the gastro-intestinal tract play a major role in shaping the immune system and the development of the intestinal barrier functions  <cit> . compared to human and mice, in chicken not much is known about the impact of genotypic variation on early life microbial colonization in relation to the functional development of the gut. the objective of this study was to investigate the impact of the genetic variation between the two broiler lines on both microbial colonization of the gut and functional development of intestinal tissue. the microbial communities of the two lines  differ in composition, but have similar levels of diversity. also the intestinal gene expression patterns showed marked differences between the two broiler lines, especially at days  <dig> and  <dig> 

microbiota differences in two genetically different broiler lines
in this experiment both broiler lines were hatched at the same hatchery and before starting this experiment the chambers were disinfected with the same protocols. furthermore, both broiler lines were hatched and reared at the same time  and chickens were exposed to the same environment and nutrition this might explain the small differences observed in the diversity of microbiota, this in agreement with the concept that environmental microbiota are the first colonizers  <cit> . the composition of microbiota is dependent on the circumstances in the gut and therefore it seems logical to assume that host genetic factors have a bigger impact on microbiota composition than on microbiota diversity. therefore we hypothesize that the observed difference in microbiota composition over time is due to the fact that these broilers are genetically different. the importance of host genetic factors has already been observed in mice and humans  <cit> . since the differences between the lines x and y in microbiota composition are already demonstrable at the early life stage of the birds, this may have impact on immune programming and the activity of the immune system at later life stages. this hypothesis is in agreement with previous observation with these lines that their immunological responses upon challenge are quite different . these studies showed that line y was more immunological responsive and resistant against both gram-negative  and gram-positive bacteria , as well as parasitic protozoan . in recent work, they have proven that chickens with a higher phenotype of key pro-inflammatory mediators , and mip family cc chemokine ccli2) were naturally more resistant against salmonella  <cit> . the latter shows that it is possible to select for natural resistance against pathogens, here we want to understand the dynamics and kinetics in early development in more detail in order to improve the resistance against pathogens in chicken.

in order to understand the dynamics and kinetics of the colonization, we zoomed in on the major differences in microbiota composition between the lines included enterococci, lactobacilli, and escherichia species. enterococci belong to the lactic acid bacteria, members of the gastro-intestinal tract of hosts, due to the fact that they can colonize a range of hosts including caenorhabditis elegans, insects, reptiles, birds, and mammals  <cit> . enterococci faecalis and e. faecium are the two most abundant commensals in humans. however, these species are also potential pathogens and contain intrinsic  mechanisms for antibiotic resistance and virulence factors  and for this reason they are now labelled as important clinical pathogens. their specific contribution to the programming and shaping of the immune system is thus far not known.

escherichia, facultative anaerobe bacteria, are another genus that is dominant in early life of these broilers. in adult pigs they have shown that high numbers escherichia, mostly escherichia coli, appear in the gastro-intestinal tract, nonetheless the health status was not affected in these pigs  <cit> . although the role of commensal e. coli in the gastrointestinal tract is not yet fully understood, we need to acknowledge that e. coli is dominant in early life and could fulfil an important role in the development of the gut ecosystem.

lactobacilli are characterized as beneficial for health, mainly because they produce lactic acid which inhibits the growth of  pathogens. different lactobacillus strains are already identified that exclude other  bacteria by competitive exclusion or enhancing immunity. for example, lactobacillus salivarius prevents salmonella enteritidis colonization ctc <dig>  <cit> . it has also been shown that a cocktail of bacteria, including lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, bifido bacterium bifidium, and enterococcus faecium, enhances mucosal immunity against eimeria acervulina  <cit> . another example is the lactobacillus johnsonii fi <dig> bacteria which excludes bacterial pathogens  <cit> . however, lactobacilli can become pathobionts, but this is mostly in immuno-compromised or elderly people  <cit> . different strains of lactobacilli are also used as probiotics to improve the health status of humans  and chickens . this shows, that a higher abundance of  lactobacilli strains in the gut may affect health status beneficially , either by reducing the pathogen load and/or strengthening the immune defence against infections. in this research, the time factor is predominantly present throughout the data, i.e. the colonization of the lactobacilli from 0- <dig>  % arc at day  <dig> to 84-88 % arc at day  <dig>  this high relative contribution of lactobacilli over time may also be important for the immune development in the gut. only small differences between line x and y are observed, where line x has slightly higher abundance at day  <dig>  which could be associated to the high activity of immune genes.

different temporal gene expression patterns between broiler lines
the expression of many genes and processes in the intestinal tissue differed between the two broiler lines. the most dominant processes were related to cell cycle and proliferation. another cluster was associated to immunity, whereas other clusters could not be linked to immunity or barrier function, such as metabolic and transcriptional processes.

the link of genes being involved in cell cycle and proliferation is shown in several clusters . more specifically these clusters were associated to apoptosis, extracellular matrix, and mitochondrion. these results show that cell proliferation/apoptosis is a main difference between these lines, especially in early age, these processes may be directly linked to the barrier function of the gut. it has been estimated that every 3- <dig> days the gut is renewed  <cit> , tight regulation of cell death  and proliferation of epithelial cells is paramount to ensure structural integrity in the gut  <cit> . in chicken multiple interventions, including fasting, diet, thermal conditioning, and stress, already have been described that affect epithelial structure, growth, and function .

moreover, the intestinal barrier has an important role in maintaining homeostasis and when dysfunction of the intestinal barrier occurs this is associated to several gastrointestinal diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, food intolerance, and celiac disease . compared to line x, line y showed higher average expression of cell cycle and proliferation related processes which may contribute to the immune phenotype observed, higher resistance against bacterial infections. this data suggests that a heightened status of the barrier function in early life could lead to less mortality. this could also be reflected in the lower activity of immune genes at day  <dig> in line y, indicating that the immune programming might be delayed.

we were surprised to see limited effects on immune related processes. only one cluster differing between line x and y was associated with immunity, one could expect more because these lines differ in resistance against bacterial infection and showed deviating gene expression after an immune challenge . this immunity cluster only differed at day  <dig>  where line x showed higher expression compared to line y and from day  <dig> to  <dig> a similar expression pattern was observed. this immunological expression pattern in time was already observed in earlier work of our group and others . this suggests that overall immune development in these broiler lines were comparable except at early stage. thus, in order for chickens to survive the turbulent start of life which is accompanied with the microbial colonization and gut differentiation, chickens may either invest in the immune programming or the barrier function at an early stage.

CONCLUSIONS
both colonization of gut microbiota and functional processes are influenced by the genetic
