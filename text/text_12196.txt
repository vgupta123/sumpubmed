BACKGROUND
grasses are among the most important and widely cultivated plants on earth, with a total area of grassland estimated to be twice that of cropland. in europe, fifty percent of the farmed landscape is under grasses which accounts for a large proportion of the annual production of beef and milk with a total value of more than €  <dig> billion  <cit> . they are also used extensively for turf and amenity purposes, and play an important role in soil conservation and protection of environmental resources. among the cultivated grasses, ryegrasses  and fescues  predominate, especially in temperate climates  <cit> .

fescues and ryegrasses are closely related and belong to the poaceae. whereas lolium consists of only eight diploid species, festuca comprises nearly  <dig> species with ploidy levels ranging from diploid to dodecaploid. the two agronomically exploited fescues - f. pratensis and f. arundinacea - belong to the bovinae section, subgenus schedonorus  <cit> , but the systematics of lolium and festuca are still a subject for review. darbyshire  <cit>  proposed to merge festuca subgenus schedonorus with the lolium. however, clear differentiation of lolium and festuca into two separate taxa is supported based on morphological traits, isozymes  <cit> , rapd markers  <cit> , analysis of its and the chloroplast trn region  <cit> , as well as est-ssr markers  <cit> .

decades of breeding resulted in superior ryegrass and fescue cultivars outperforming their wild progenitors. however, there is a risk that some desirable alleles of the progenitors were lost during the breeding process. the analysis of genetic diversity in cultivars of dactylis glomerata and gossypium arboreum revealed lower levels of intraspecific variability as compared to the wild types  <cit> . similar trends were observed in f. pratensis  <cit>  and l. perenne  <cit> . investigations of genetic diversity of nordic f. pratensis cultivars and natural populations have shown that although the molecular genetic variation has not been reduced by breeding  <cit> , the phenotypic variation in important agronomic traits is lower in cultivars when compared to natural populations  <cit> . thus, the existing gene pool of wild accessions represents an invaluable source of alleles, which can be introduced into existing cultivars. the risk of erosion of species' gene pools calls for characterization of the natural genetic variability and its conservation in gene banks. an ideal system to describe genetic diversity should allow for parallel screening of thousands of genomic loci and quickly analyze many accessions at a low cost. such a method will allow more effective selection of material for breeding purposes.

a high-throughput genotyping system is also required to speed up the development of new cultivars with desirable attributes using marker assisted selection . for mas, the development of genetic markers and genetic linkage maps is required. several genetic maps were constructed for lolium spp. using isozymes, rflp, aflp, rapd, ssr, and est-derived caps markers  <cit> . markers associated with traits such as disease resistance  <cit> , winter hardiness  <cit> , quality parameters  <cit>  and fertility traits  <cit>  have been identified through the analysis of quantitative trait loci . within fescue species, genetic maps were generated for both agronomically important species - f. arundinacea and f. pratensis  <cit> . the identification of qtls for resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses as well as the application of genetic markers in cultivar development has been recently summarized by zhang et al.  <cit> .

in addition to breeding of fescue and ryegrass cultivars, some breeding programs have released cultivars originating from intergeneric crosses of festuca with lolium , thereby combining desirable agronomic characteristics of both genera  <cit> . the ryegrass species - l. multiflorum lam. and l. perenne l. are highly nutritious, palatable and digestible, and display numerous valuable characteristics for turf culture including deep green color, uniformity, and rapid establishment. fescues are known for their adaptation to abiotic stresses. in particular, f. arundinacea is well known for its drought tolerance, while f. pratensis carries genes for winter hardiness. until recently, the genomic constitution of commercial festulolium cultivars was mostly a matter of speculation and extrapolation from research stocks. kopecký et al.  <cit> , using genomic in situ hybridization , demonstrated that genomic composition of the commercial festulolium varied significantly, depending on the parents used for hybrid development and the breeding strategy employed. while gish is a very powerful and simple method for karyotypic studies in the lolium-festuca complex, it does have limited resolution. while this resolution limit has not yet been established in grasses, in wheat-rye hybrids it was found to be up to the mb level  <cit> . obviously, this limits the technique to identification of large genomic regions. low throughput is another bottleneck preventing its broader use in breeding. thus, a more sensitive and effective system is needed for genotyping in breeding of commercial festulolium cultivars.

the need for a high-throughput genotyping system led to the development of various dna arrays and chips . although they are based on different principles, all of them can be used to screen thousands or hundreds of thousands genomic loci in a single pass. however, most of them are based on scoring single nucleotide or single feature polymorphisms  and the development of such markers requires detailed knowledge of the dna sequence. therefore, it can only be used with some degree of success in species with at least some minimum level of dna sequencing completed. in contrast, diversity arrays technology  is a microarray hybridization based technique that permits simultaneous screening thousands of polymorphic loci without any prior sequence information  <cit> . dart is high-throughput, low-cost, quick and reproducible. it has been used for genotyping and genetic mapping of genomes in numerous species, such as arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , hordeum vulgare  <cit> , triticum aestivum  <cit> , cajanus cajan  <cit> , sorghum bicolor  <cit>  and many others. dart markers were also employed in the construction of a physical map of wheat chromosome 3b  <cit> .

in this study we report on the development of a dart array for five agronomically important species within the festuca-lolium complex. we demonstrate the utility of the approach for the estimation of intra- and interspecific genetic diversity. moreover, by combining the dart array with cytogenetic information in specific stocks of festulolium, we illustrate successful anchoring of sets of dart markers to individual chromosomes and chromosome bins.

RESULTS
development of dart array
we developed a dart array containing  <dig> probes derived from methyl-filtered  genomic representations. in the first marker discovery experiment performed with  <dig> genotypes from each of the species l. perenne, l. multiflorum, f. pratensis and f. arundinacea, and seven genotypes of f. glaucescens, we identified  <dig> polymorphic markers with standard dartsoft settings. this is the highest frequency of polymorphism  reported for dart arrays, consistent with a very high level of dna sequence variation in the fescue/ryegrass complex. such a high degree of polymorphism was not unexpected, because the array consists of five different species of two genera. most of these markers detected reliable polymorphisms across all accessions tested, while a subset of markers worked reliably only in a subset of diversity tested on the array.

in order to estimate the level of redundancy of markers on the array we used  <dig> festuloliums samples. it is important not to confuse the apparent redundancy  which is due to linkage disequilibrium  in the material analysed and probe sequence redundancy due to sampling the same  restriction fragment due to the random cloning process. the festuoliums lines we used for redundancy analysis were derived from various parents through interspecific hybridizations therefore they are expected to have very low level of ld. we applied correlation analysis of all possible pairs of  <dig> markers discovered in the analysis  and found a low level of redundancy: out of  <dig> unique score signatures we found  <dig> singletons,  <dig> bins with  <dig> markers,  <dig> bins with  <dig> markers,  <dig> bins with  <dig> markers,  <dig> bins with  <dig> markers and single bins with  <dig> and  <dig> markers, respectively. the detected level of redundancy  will be verified in the future through sequencing, but taking this preliminary estimate we can conclude that there are approximately  <dig> unique markers on the array .

analysis of genetic diversity using dart markers
of the  <dig> polymorphic markers identified on the array when polymorphic markers detected in each species were summed up only  <dig> markers gave unequivocal scores in the joint fuzzy c-means clustering-based classification of all five species . joint classification of signal on dart arrays was compromised for the remaining  <dig> markers by multiple alleles present in the same locus of the five species. different alleles present in targets, especially when dealing with different species, often result in different levels of relative signal intensity for a probe on the array, either due to sequence or fragment length difference. these different levels of signal intensity do not conform to bimodal distribution dartsoft requires for unambiguous 0/ <dig> binarisation .

using these  <dig> markers, we compiled a dendrogram including all  <dig> accessions of fescue and ryegrass. this differentiated two major groups, representing the fescue and ryegrass genera . both ryegrass species analyzed  were closely related, but divergent enough to form separate groups. fescue species formed two major groups. the first one included f. pratensis and, as the level of dart polymorphism among f. pratensis accessions was low, they formed a tight group in the dendrogram. the second group included f. arundinacea and f. glaucescens. this group included two subgroups, one representing f. arundinacea accessions and the second f. glaucescens accessions. f. arundinacea accession fa- <dig>  was placed distant from the main f. arundinacea cluster. similarly, one accession of f. glaucescens fg- <dig>  clustered with the subgroup of f. arundinacea. all plants of this accession tested had chromosome numbers 2n =  <dig>  indicating that this accession was probably a mislabeled f. arundinacea, and not of f. glaucescens origin. moreover, the number of markers that scored positive  in this accession  was higher than in any other accession of f. glaucescens  and was similar to those of f. arundinacea . another inconsistent accession, f. pratensis fp- <dig> , was located outside of all other species in the dendrogram probably due to contamination of its dna. both accessions  were excluded from further analyses.

the molecular genetic diversity analyses revealed several attributes characteristic for all species:

 ecotypes from one country were usually more closely related than those from different countries .

 cultivars released in one country usually displayed little polymorphism .

 ryegrasses displayed higher levels of polymorphism than fescues.

polymorphism between the parents of mapping populations
with the prospect of using the array for mapping various agronomically important traits, we evaluated the presence of polymorphisms among  parents of mapping populations, which were deliberately included in our set of genotypes in the marker discovery stage of the project. it is clear that the level of marker polymorphism among the parents of mapping populations depends primarily on the purpose for which any specific map was developed. where the purpose was to generate general genetic maps, the parents should be genetically as distant as possible, thus the number of polymorphic markers was expected to be high. this was the case for the l. perenne f <dig> mapping population vrna, where  <dig> dart markers were polymorphic between the grandparents ngb and veyo . on the other hand, when a mapping population was generated to target a few specific traits, the parents can be genetically similar except for the region harboring the gene of interest. for example, only  <dig> polymorphic markers were found between lts- <dig> and lts- <dig>  these two parental genotypes are both derived from similar gene pools, but designed to maximize heterozygosity for nitrogen use efficiency and cell wall digestibility, respectively.

genus- and species-specificity of dart markers
reliable discrimination of dna markers from both grass genera tested here, and possibly also from individual species, would greatly expand the utility of the dart array. as the dartfest array contained markers derived from both genera and all five species tested, our subsequent analysis focused on identifying genus- and species-specific markers. of  <dig> polymorphic dart markers identified, over  <dig>  markers detected a positive  allele in each species . the highest number of such markers "1" was in f. pratensis  and in l. multiflorum . lower numbers of markers were detected in f. arundinacea , in f. glaucescens  and in l. perenne . however, a large proportion of markers present in all five species tested reduced the numbers of species-specific markers. thus, only nine species-specific markers were detected in f. glaucescens. for the two other fescue species,  <dig> and  <dig> species-specific markers were identified in f. arundinacea and f, pratensis, respectively. the number of markers shared between the allopolyploid f. arundinacea and its progenitors - f. pratensis and f. glaucescens - was high. specifically, f. arundinacea shared  <dig> markers with only f. glaucescens and  <dig> markers exclusively with f. pratensis. in ryegrass,  <dig> markers specific for l. perenne and  <dig> markers specific for l. multiflorum were identified. another  <dig> markers were present in both ryegrass species and absent in fescues. the number of markers, which could be used to identify particular genomes in intra- and interspecific hybrids, is shown in figure  <dig>

based on the proportion of markers shared by pairs of species, genome relationships within this complex are as follow: fa-fg >> lm-lp >> fa-fp >> fp-lm > fp-fg > fg-lm > fa-lm > fa-lp > fg-lp > fp-lp. this correlates with the results of the cluster analysis.

mapping dart markers to f. pratensis chromosomes and chromosome bins
we used a complete set of festuca-lolium single chromosome substitution lines of f. pratensis into tetraploid l. multiflorum to allocate dart markers showing interspecific polymorphism to individual chromosomes of f. pratensis. in total,  <dig> dart markers were anchored this way with six to  <dig> dart markers anchored to a specific chromosome . this represents 56% of all markers present in f. pratensis but absent in l. multiflorum. the lowest numbers of chromosome-specific markers were found on chromosome  <dig>  and chromosome  <dig> . however, another  <dig> markers were shared by the two chromosomes. this was surprising, as any other pair of chromosomes shared up to four markers only.

chromosome number
number of the dart markers specific for individual chromosomes of f. pratensis

based on the analysis of  <dig> recombinant lines with different lengths of the introgressed f. pratensis segments of chromosome  <dig>  we were able to anchor  <dig> dart markers to seven bins of this chromosome . each bin contained between one and nine markers; nine markers were also shared with other chromosomes. the co-localization was found with all six remaining chromosomes with similar frequency.

discussion
the results of this study represent a major step toward the development of a high-throughput genotyping platform for important grass species from the genera festuca and lolium. both genera contain agronomically important species, and are frequently intercrossed to combine complementary species characteristics. the  <dig> dart markers on the array is by far the highest number of markers ever used in studies of diversity or for genetic mapping of lolium and festuca species  <cit> . our choice of the dart array was motivated by the relative ease of its development, a good chance for extensive marker polymorphism, and its low cost per data point for future applications.

the results obtained in a set of  <dig> accessions representing two genera and five species proved the usefulness of the array to analyze genetic diversity. intraspecific variability evaluated based on the detection of  <dig> dart markers was found to be higher in both ryegrass species as compared to the fescues. the lowest intraspecific variability was detected among the accessions of f. arundinacea. using rapd markers, kölliker et al.  <cit>  revealed much lower intraspecific variability in f. pratensis compared to l. perenne. fjellheim et al.  <cit>  found that the number of cpdna haplotypes in f. pratensis was only about 25% of that observed in l. perenne by balfourier et al.  <cit> , and suggested that f. pratensis in europe has been through a recent bottleneck. the higher intraspecific variability in ryegrasses compared with that in fescues was also noted based on screening of est-ssr markers  <cit>  and based on the observations of phenotypic traits . although it was outside of the immediate goal of this study, the bottleneck created by interspecific hybridization in the evolution of tall fescues seems a reasonable assumption.

the set of genotypes used in this study included parents from the b14/ <dig> × hf2/ <dig> mapping population of f. pratensis  <cit> . the genetic map of this population contains  <dig> loci from homologous and heterologous rflp, aflp, isozyme, and ssr markers, and has a total length of  <dig>  cm with an average marker density of  <dig>  cm/marker. the number of polymorphic dart markers between the parents of this mapping was  <dig>  thus, the number of dart markers released in this study could significantly increase the density of the genetic linkage map.

prior to this study, no high-throughput approach was available to study genomic constitutions of interspecific and intergeneric hybrids of festuca and lolium, nor in any other combination of frequently mated species/genera, such as wheat and rye. yet, such systems would enable characterization of unknown accessions as well as hybrid breeding materials and cultivars, and assist greatly in early characterization of all primary recombinants that have to be generated in large numbers whenever high precision of alien introgression is required  <cit> . our analyses indicate that the dart array is very useful for these purposes. for each of the analyzed species, a number of species-specific markers were identified. for two species of high interest in relation to production of festulolium cultivars, l. multiflorum and f. pratensis, over  <dig> species-specific markers were identified. such a high number of markers will facilitate detailed analyses of genomic constitution in wide hybrids. it should also be possible to establish genome profiles specific for individual genotypes , which could be useful in terms of legal protection of commercial cultivars.

in our previous work, we have shown that several hybrid festulolium cultivars do not contain complete parental chromosome sets  <cit> . the range of applications of the dartfest array to characterize genomic constitution in these cultivars would be greatly expanded, if dart markers were assigned to individual chromosomes. this was partially achieved in this study using festuca-lolium chromosome substitution lines and  <dig> markers were anchored to individual chromosomes of f. pratensis. the observation of  <dig> markers co-localizing on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> could be explained by ancestral or more recent duplication.

in addition to varying proportions of parental chromosome sets, festuca × lolium hybrids often contain recombined chromosomes resulting from meiotic crossing-over between homoeologous chromosomes  <cit> . to describe genomes of hybrids at the subchromosomal level using dart markers, these need to be assigned to specific chromosome regions via genetic mapping. however, as genetic linkage between genetic markers does not correspond to physical distances  <cit> , physical mapping seems a better choice. in this study, we assigned a set of dart markers to seven bins on chromosome  <dig> using  <dig> recombination lines of this chromosome. we developed about  <dig> such recombinant lines for each chromosome of f. pratensis and thus it will be possible to dissect the entire genome of f. pratensis into ca.  <dig> chromosomal bins. in a similar study, king et al.  <cit>  utilized a set of introgression lines of diploid l. perenne harboring chromosome segments of f. pratensis. the authors reported the establishment of  <dig> bins for chromosome  <dig> of f. pratensis and physical localization of  <dig> aflp markers. as dart markers are much more amenable to multiplexing than aflp markers  the throughput and cost advantage of the dart array is significant . this advantage can be further enhanced through planned array expansion that could easily double the number of markers per assay, thereby further reducing the cost per datapoint with a minimum increase in price per sample. in addition, dart markers are "sequence-ready", cloned genomic fragments, which offer important advantages over aflps for physical and genetic mapping. sequencing of dart markers identified in this study will enable in-silico comparisons of physical maps of fescue and ryegrass chromosomes with the sequenced grass genomes.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study suggest that the newly developed dartfest array will find numerous applications in grass genetics and breeding. it can be used to characterize genetic diversity as well as to develop genetic maps and identify markers linked with traits of interest. the ability to physically map dart marker using chromosome substitution and recombinant lines will support the development of integrated genetic and physical maps of fescue and ryegrass. we also envisage a great impact of the array on characterizing genomic constitution of interspecific an intergeneric hybrids at the chromosomal and subchromosomal level. this progress should provide tools to understand the behavior of hybrid genomes as well as to improve the breeding of grass cultivars.

the array data have been deposited on a publically available website . the website will be permanent and will be expanded by genetic and physical mapping data as they become available.
