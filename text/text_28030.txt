BACKGROUND
during the last decade significant progress has been made in citrus production throughout the world. however, world citrus industry is frequently confronted with risk of devastation by a variety of biotic or abiotic stresses. citrus canker disease, caused by xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri , is one of the most destructive biotic stresses threatening the citrus production globally  <cit> . the typical symptoms of canker caused by xac include water-soaked eruptions and pustule-like lesions on leaves, stems and fruits, which can lead to defoliation, dieback and fruit drop, yielding enormous loss of production and fruit quality. xac can attack a fairly wide spectrum of hosts with variable damage, including most citrus species and some related genera  <cit> . although a considerable effort has been tried, to breed a resistant cultivar using traditional breeding methods still remains a big challenge  <cit> . kumquat  has been suggested to be resistant to xac, however, it is not easy to transfer the resistance from kumquat to citrus via cross hybridization due to a series of natural barriers such as male/female sterility, long juvenile period, high degree of heterozygosity, and polyembryony. at present, the primary strategies for controlling canker disease depend upon an integrated approach including eradication program and use of antibiotics or bactericides  <cit> . however, it should be pointed out that these strategies are not the ultimate solutions considering the cost, safety to human and animals, consistency and stabilization, and impacts on the environment. breeding a cultivar resistant to xac provides the most effective and economical way to control this disease. genetic engineering paves the way for creating novel germplasms that are otherwise impossible via classic breeding strategy, and has been widely employed to produce disease-resistant materials without greatly altering existing genetic background  <cit> .

plants have developed mechanisms of physiological, biochemical and molecular responses to protect them against the pathogenic attack, apart from the structural barriers and pre-formed antimicrobial compounds  <cit> . among these, genetically programmed suicide of the cells at the infection sites, known as hypersensitive response , constitutes an important line of defense against pathogen invasion. previous studies suggested that presence or accumulation of hydrogen peroxide  played a central role in the orchestration of hr  <cit> . moreover, h2o <dig> serves as a substrate driving the cross-linking of cell wall structural proteins to retard microbial ingress  <cit> . a great amount of evidences has shown that h2o <dig> is also an important molecule to mediate signal transduction in the activation of defense-related genes  <cit> . therefore, manipulating h2o <dig> production to a higher but below the cytotoxic level might be an effective way to battle against the pathogen invasion, leading to enhanced disease tolerance.

the production of h2o <dig> in plants undergoing stresses experiences a two-phase process, the rapid and transient phase and the late and persistent phase, but more h2o <dig> is generated in the latter phase than in the former one  <cit> . although the precise role of h2o <dig> in each phase remains unclear, h2o <dig> produced in the latter phase has been suggested to be closely involved in plant defense response  <cit> . in addition, in this phase h2o <dig> was predominantly produced through the polyamine degradation mediated by either flavine-containing polyamine oxidases  or copper-containing amine oxidases   <cit> . polyamines, mainly diamine putrescine , triamine spermidine  and tetraamine spermine , are low-molecular-weight natural aliphatic polycations that are ubiquitously distributed in all living organisms. as an important source of h2o <dig> production, polyamines have been suggested to be involved in response to pathogen attack or to be responsible for enhanced disease resistance in higher plants  <cit>  based on the following lines of evidence, although the exact mode of action needs to be explicitly clarified. firstly, the polyamine levels were increased after attack by fungus  <cit> , virus  <cit>  and bacterium  <cit> , implying that polyamine accumulation may be a common event for plant response to various pathogens. secondly, augmentation of the polyamine level in a host plant through exogenous application of polyamines enhanced resistance to viral or bacterial pathogens  <cit> . it is suggested that the endogenous polyamines accumulating under these circumstances may serve as substrates for either pao or cuao, leading to production of sufficient h2o <dig> that functions in hr or signaling transduction  <cit> . this assumption may be plausible as pao/cuao-mediated polyamine degradation has been reported to be correlated with the induced tolerance to specific pathogens. for example, inhibition of cuao activity by an irreversible inhibitor reduced accumulation of h2o <dig> and led to a concurrent development of extended necrotic lesions in chickpea when inoculated with ascochyta rabiei  <cit> . in a recent study, tobacco plants overexpressing a pao gene yielded more h2o <dig> and exhibited preinduced disease tolerance to both bacteria and oomycetes, whereas repression of the pao by means of using an inhibitor, virus-induced gene silencing or antisense technology suppressed h2o <dig> production and then lost hr, coupled with an increase of bacterial growth  <cit> . all of these findings indicate that accumulation of polyamines and an ensuing degradation play a pivotal role in defense against the pathogens, in particular biotrophic ones  <cit> .

polyamine biosynthesis in higher plants has been well documented, in which five key biosynthetic enzymes are involved, arginine decarboxylase , ornithine decarboxylase , s-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase , spd synthase  and spm synthase . as cellular polyamine content can be regulated at the transcriptional level, it is possible to modulate the endogenous polyamine level via overexpression of the polyamine biosynthetic genes, as has been revealed elsewhere  <cit> . it is worth mentioning that although much effort has been invested to elucidate the role of polyamines in disease tolerance, the knowledge is still limited as the data are obtained from only few plant species. the raised question is whether promotion of polyamine biosynthesis/catabolism can be used as an approach to obtain transgenic plants with improved disease resistance in an economically important fruit crop like citrus. toward understanding this question, we first produced transgenic sweet orange  plants overexpressing mdspds <dig> isolated from apple  <cit> . then we showed that two transgenic lines  with varying mrna levels of the transgene were less susceptible to xac than the wild type plants , which might be correlated with production of h2o <dig> and/or up-regulation of transcription levels of defense-related genes. to our knowledge, this is the first report on improving disease resistance in a perennial fruit crop via transformation of a gene involved in polyamine biosynthesis, adding new insight into the functions of polyamines for engineering biotic stress tolerance.

RESULTS
transformation and regeneration of plants from embryogenic calluses
to obtain transgenic plants, the embryogenic calluses of 'anliucheng' sweet orange were infected with the agrobacterium tumefaciens strain lba <dig> containing pbi121::mdspds <dig> and a neomycin phosphotransferase gene . on the selection medium containing kanamycin, most of the infected calluses turned brown within  <dig> month, while the kanamycin-resistant calluses were still white . the kanamycin-resistant calluses were then cultured on the fresh selection medium for further selection and multiplication. at last, the surviving calluses after several rounds of selection were transferred to embryoid-inducing medium to induce embryogenesis . thereafter, mature cotyledonary embryoids were cultured on the shoot-inducing medium to regenerate shoots . when the shoots were  <dig>  cm in length, they were excised and moved to root-inducing medium to get rooting plantlets. two months after rooting, the plantlets were planted in the soil pots and kept in a growth chamber for further growth .

molecular confirmation of the regenerated plants
pcr using genomic dna as template was performed to verify the integration of mdspds <dig> in the regenerated plants. the amplification with specific primers showed that expected fragments with the same size as that of the plasmid were produced in all of the ten tested lines, but not in the wt , indicating that they were putative transformants. overexpression of the mdspds <dig> gene was further analyzed in two lines  by semi-quantitative rt-pcr. mrna levels of mdspds <dig> were detected in both tg <dig> and tg <dig>  but the level is higher in the latter line .

free and conjugated polyamine levels in the transgenic lines and wt under normal conditions
free polyamine levels of tg <dig>  tg <dig> and wt were determined with hplc . as compared with the wt, tg <dig> had significantly higher level of put , while put of tg <dig>  was slightly reduced. spd levels of tg <dig>  and tg <dig>  were significantly reduced and increased, respectively, in comparison to the wt . spm content in both lines  were significantly increased relative to the wt . conjugated put levels of tg <dig> and tg <dig> were significantly reduced compared with the wt, and the largest decrease was detected in tg <dig> . the conjugated spd of tg <dig> was slightly but insignificantly lower than the wt and tg <dig> that were close to each other, while the conjugated spm level of tg <dig> was significantly higher than that of wt and tg <dig> 

xac challenge of the transgenic plants and the wt
the accumulation of spd and spm, especially spm, led us to test the defense capacity of the transgenic plants against the xac pathogen as spm has been shown to be an endogenous inducer for defense-related genes  <cit> . to this end, tg <dig> and the wt were challenged with xac by pinprick inoculation under the same conditions, followed by comparison of timing of canker symptom, disease index  and lesion size between them. di of wt at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days post inoculation  was  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , about  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  times larger than that of tg <dig>  respectively . on  <dig> dpi, large white spongy pustules were formed at the inoculation sites in both abaxial and adaxial sides of the wt leaves, whereas tg <dig> showed the symptom only at fewer inoculation sites of the adaxial side . although white spongy pustules could be detected in both the wt and tg <dig> at  <dig> dpi, size of the lesions in the wt was about  <dig>  times bigger than that of tg <dig> on the abaxial side . similarly, on the adaxial side, the wt had bigger lesions  than tg <dig> . inoculation of tg <dig> and the wt in a different set of experiments also showed that tg <dig> was also less susceptible to citrus canker , although the timing of canker occurrence varied from that of tg <dig>  these data indicate that both tg <dig> and tg <dig> were more tolerant to canker disease than the wt. to dissect the potential mechanisms underlying the enhanced canker tolerance, we performed in-depth work using tg <dig> as it had higher expression level of mdspds <dig> and spd and spm level.

tg <dig> accumulated more h2o <dig> than the wt after xac inoculation
it is noted necrosis was observed at the inoculation sites of tg <dig> leaves when they were inoculated with xac, a sign of hr, which was otherwise absent in the wt , implying that the transgenic plant might experience rapid cell death upon xac infection. as h2o <dig> plays an essential role in the orchestration of hr, accumulation of h2o <dig> at the infection sites and in the neighboring regions was visually detected by dab and h2dcf-da, respectively. at  <dig> dpi of xac inoculation, both tg <dig> and the wt had brown spots at the infected sites. however, compared with the wt, tg <dig> showed deeper brown color than the wt. interestingly, a brown circle was viewed around the infected sites of tg <dig>  which was not detected in the wt . a similar staining pattern was noticed at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, suggesting that tg <dig> might accumulate higher h2o <dig> at the infection sites than the wt.

since dab staining was difficult to reveal the h2o <dig> accumulation in the regions near the inoculation sites, h2dcf-da staining was used to determine h2o <dig> therein using the samples collected at  <dig> dpi. as can be seen in figure 4c, tg <dig> leaves showed more abundant green fluorescence than the wt, indicating presence of higher h2o <dig> level in tg <dig> than in the wt.

tg <dig> had higher pao, sod and cat activity than the wt after xac attack
pao-mediated polyamine degradation is an important pathway for h2o <dig> production, efforts were thus made to investigate pao enzyme activity in the wt and tg <dig> leaves sampled at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi. measurement showed that pao activity of the wt did not vary greatly despite a negligible increase at  <dig> dpi, while that of tg <dig> was enhanced over inoculation time. as a result, pao activity of tg <dig> was significantly higher than that of the wt at the three time points .

antioxidant enzymes have been shown to be important for homeostasis of ros, so we also examined activities of two enzymes involved in h2o <dig> production and scavenging, superoxide dismutase  and catalase , in the wt and tg <dig> at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi. sod activity exhibited minor change upon xac infection, but it was higher in tg <dig> compared with the wt, particularly at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi . xac inoculation induced a progressive increase of the cat activity in both tg <dig> and the wt. however, they were statistically insignificantly different from each other at any time point .

changes of free polyamines after the xac infection
free polyamine levels were also evaluated after the xac infection in the present study. xac attack reduced free put level in the wt, whereas tg <dig> underwent slight change and the put content in tg <dig> was still significantly lower than that of the wt at any time point . free spd in the wt and tg <dig> was similar and showed slight alterations during the period . at  <dig> dpi, no differences in free spm level were observed between tg <dig> and the wt. although wt exhibited no change at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, the spm in tg <dig> presented an increase, leading to significantly higher levels in tg <dig> relative to wt at the last two time points .

treatment with a pao inhibitor enhanced xac susceptibility
the above data showed that pao activity in tg <dig> was increased after xac infection, consistent with the accumulation of h2o <dig>  in order to know if the pao-mediated h2o <dig> production was responsible for the canker tolerance, a pao inhibitor  was used to treat tg <dig> before xac inoculation. in a preliminary experiment, we showed that the inhibitor did not arrest the growth of xac bacteria . when the leaves were treated with the inhibitor, pao activity was reduced by  <dig> % at  <dig> dpi . interestingly, at this time h2o <dig> production of the inhibitor-treated samples was lower than that treated with water . in contrast, hr was more conspicuous at the inoculation sites of the leaves without inhibitor pretreatment . moreover, the inhibitor-treated leaves exhibited more serious canker symptom over a 9-d inoculation experiment when compared with the water-treated ones, as manifested by the higher di  and larger lesion size on the abaxial and adaxial sides . all of these data suggested that repression of pao by the inhibitor resulted in production of less h2o <dig> and a concomitant increase of sensitivity to xac attack.

expression analysis of defense-related genes before and after the xac inoculation
disease resistance is a complex process in which many defense-related genes are activated to play crucial roles. to elucidate whether or not mrna levels of defense-related genes are influenced in tg <dig> compared with the wt, transcript levels of genes encoding chitinase, cystatin-like protein, pathogenesis-related  protein 4a  and allene oxide synthase  were assessed by real-time quantitative rt-pcr. as shown in figure  <dig>  relative expression levels of all the tested genes were prominently enhanced in tg <dig> relative to the wt before or after xac inoculation, except aos gene at  <dig> dpi. these data suggest that the defense-related genes were constitutively activated in the transgenic plant.

discussion
citrus canker is a devastating disease afflicting citrus production worldwide. in order to create novel germplasms with reduced susceptibility to canker, genetic transformation of antibacterial peptides or r-genes has been tried before this work. for instance, barbosa-mendes et al.  <cit>  introduced a gene encoding harpin protein into 'hamlin' sweet orange and the resultant transgenic lines showed reduction in xac susceptibility. very recently, mendes et al.  <cit>  reported that transformation of rice xa <dig> gene into sweet orange gave rise to enhanced tolerance to canker. herein, we show that a polyamine biosynthetic gene is successfully introduced into sweet orange and the transgenic plants are less susceptible to citrus canker, which opens a new avenue for producing novel citrus germplasms resistant to a biotic stress. despite the fact that genetic transformation of polyamine biosynthetic genes has been shown to confer abiotic stress tolerance  <cit>  information is relatively scarce concerning application of this strategy to the biotic stress engineering. so far, only polyamine catabolic genes have been engineered to enhance resistance to pathogen challenge  <cit> . our work gains new insight into new function of the genes involved in polyamine biosynthesis.

although mdspds <dig> was overexpressed in tg <dig> and tg <dig>  the endogenous polyamine levels in these two lines differed from each other. the difference may be plausible since tg <dig> and tg <dig> arose from independent transformation events, suggesting polyamine biosynthesis might be variably modulated in the transgenic plants expressing the same gene. it is worth mentioning that variation of polyamine levels in the genetic transformants overexpressing polyamine biosynthetic genes has been reported in earlier studies  <cit> . our data and the data of earlier work demonstrate that there is a complex regulation of intracellular polyamine contents under these circumstances, which may vary among plant species, transgene type and physiological conditions. a striking finding herein is the extremely high level of free put level in tg <dig> relative to the wt and tg <dig>  it has been documented that endogenous cellular polyamine level is dependent upon several interconnected pathways, such as de novo synthesis, degradation and conjugation, but the exact contribution of an individual pathway is not yet identified. in tg <dig>  high level of free put was largely consistent with the low level of its conjugated counterpart, implying that in this line the conjugated put might have been enormously converted to free part. this sounds reasonable as the conjugated polyamines are of particular importance for the regulation of intracellular polyamine levels  <cit> . however, this scenario does not hold true for put level of tg <dig> and spd/spm level of both transgenic lines as the interrelationship between free and conjugated form was not established, indicating that relative proportion of the free and conjugated polyamines is diversified among different plants  <cit> . on the other hand, the possibility of back conversion from spd to put in tg <dig> might also partially explain the high put level  in this line. although we could not present evidence to support this presumption herein, such conversion has been previously reported in other plants  <cit> . as for tg <dig>  despite a substantial increase of the mdspds <dig> mrna, endogenous spd and spm levels were just slightly increased, which demonstrated that no direct correlation exists between the transcription level of a biosynthetic gene and the product of the protein activity  <cit> . in previous studies overexpression of the polyamine biosynthetic genes like samdc or spds has also been shown to bring about very limited accumulation of spd and/or spm, which may be ascribed to tight homeostatic regulation of these compounds at cellular level  <cit> . in addition, tg <dig> has lower level of free put compared with the wt despite presence of higher expression of the transgene. at this stage it is still ambiguous to unravel an exact reason for the observed phenomenon as the polyamine biosynthetic control is invested at multiple interdependent steps  <cit> . one possibility is the timely conversion into the downstream compounds  by spds due to overexpression of the gene, as evidenced by the slightly higher spd. however, other possibilities, such as repressed synthesis or stimulated degradation, could not be fully ruled out.

hr was observed at the inoculation sites in tg <dig>  whereas it was largely absent in the wt . plants possess an innate immune system to defend themselves against the pathogens, and hr serves as an important protective strategy to limit pathogen spread through suicidal death of the host cells  <cit> . interestingly, the induction of hr is concomitant with accumulation of higher h2o <dig> in tg <dig> when compared with the wt. it is known that activation of hr is relevant to the abundant production of reactive oxygen species , also referred to as oxidative burst, in which h2o <dig> plays a significant part  <cit> . therefore, it seems likely that tg <dig> accumulated more h2o <dig> than the wt, which effectively triggered the cell death at the inoculation sites, leading to an enhancement of canker disease resistance. dab staining of the inoculated sites supported this likelihood. the question then arises as to how tg <dig> produced more h2o <dig> than wt. as mentioned earlier, h2o <dig> generated by polyamine degradation plays an important role in plant defense response upon the pathogen invasion  <cit> . this scenario led us to focus our research efforts on the polyamine degradation via pao as this process has been suggested to be an important source of h2o <dig> production during pathogen infection  <cit> . it can be seen in figure 5a that after xac inoculation tg <dig> showed continuous increase in the pao activity, significantly higher than the wt at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi. our results support previous studies in which pao activity was induced upon exposure to pathogen challenge  <cit> . presence of the higher pao activity in tg <dig> agrees well with the accumulation of more copious h2o <dig>  indicating that pao-mediated polyamine oxidation might contribute to the accumulation of h2o <dig> after xac infection, which was further supported by the application of the pao inhibitor. in addition, it is noticed that use of the inhibitor alleviated hr, coupled with more prominent canker symptom, implying that pao-mediated polyamine oxidation, producing h2o <dig> that triggers hypersensitive cell death, is involved in xac tolerance in the transgenic line.

however, the interpretation of these results should be treated cautiously at this stage as other possibility of h2o <dig> production could not be exclusively precluded, at least via two other pathways. first, we still could not rule out the possibility of involvement of cuao in mediating the polyamine oxidation to produce h2o <dig> after the xac attack. although in the present study we had no data to elucidate the function of cuao in defense response to xac, this enzyme and its activity have been previously shown to be essential for the h2o <dig> production in protection against pathogens  <cit> . second, h2o <dig> accumulation might be also relevant to the antioxidant system, particularly sod that catalyzes the conversion of superoxide anion  into h2o <dig>  in our study, tg <dig> had higher sod activity compared with the wt, consistent with earlier work that endogenous sod activity was promoted when cellular polyamine contents increased  <cit> . it is conceivable that regardless of the transgenics, both the wt and tg <dig> might first accumulate o2- when exposed to xac. as tg <dig> had higher sod activity, the o2- produced in this line might be dismutated to generate h2o <dig> in a more efficient manner. as the cat activity was similar between wt and tg <dig> , the h2o <dig> in these two lines may be equivalently removed by cat. since tg <dig> had a better supply of h2o <dig> by the higher sod activity the outcome is that it accumulated more h2o <dig>  which was controlled by cat below the destructive concentration and in the meantime can function well in modulating the stress response.

after the xac inoculation, free put of tg <dig> was still lower than that of the wt throughout the experimentation. papadakis and roubelakis-angelakis  <cit>  have proposed that high concentration of put prevented cell death, which suggested that the lower put level in tg <dig> may create a favorable situation stimulating hypersensitive cell death. on the contrary, although tg <dig> and the wt exhibited no difference in free spd content, the former contained higher spm than the latter, particularly at the last two time points. induction of polyamines agrees with previous results in which various biotic stresses caused an increase of cellular polyamines  <cit> . an interesting finding in our work is that spm was accumulated along with higher pao activity in tg <dig> relative to the wt. it seems tempting to suggest that upon the xac infection spm was simultaneously synthesized and degraded, consistent with the accumulation of h2o <dig> mentioned above. this phenomenon has also been reported in an earlier study on tobacco treated with an elicitor derived from phytophthora cryptogea  <cit> . our data and those of others indicated that the polyamine synthesis is stimulated in plants upon pathogen attack, providing enough substrate pool, which sequentially initiates its exodus to the apoplast and triggers the polyamine catabolism  <cit> . this result also demonstrates that the pao-mediated catabolism does not cause a concurrent reduction of the corresponding polyamine, which may be ascribed to the fact that there is a feedback stimulation of the polyamine synthesis by the activated catabolism or that only a small fraction of free polyamine  is allocated for the catabolic branch.

spm has been proposed as a signaling molecule that can induce cellular signal transduction pathway  <cit> . apart from local hr, h2o <dig> serves as a diffusible signal to activate defense genes in the adjacent cells  <cit> . in this work, tg <dig> had higher spm and harbored more h2o <dig> after attack by the xac, which compelled us to investigate expression of several defense-related genes before or after xac inoculation so as to gain a further insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the disease response. the transcript levels of the tested genes were higher in tg <dig> than in the wt before xac infection, except the aos gene. upon xac challenge, all genes were induced to more intense extent in tg <dig> than in the wt, but the magnitude of induction varied among the genes. chitinase , cystatin-like protein  and pr4a  are pr proteins responsible for systemic acquired resistance  <cit> . pr proteins have been shown to be induced by exogenously applied spm and by h2o <dig>  <cit> , suggesting that tg <dig> might synthesize more abundant pr proteins to protect it against the pathogen infection, even in the absence of a biotic stress shock. aos is a cytochrome p <dig>  that catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid . ja has been suggested to play a pivotal role in the defense response and the mediation of induced systemic resistance  <cit> . induction of this gene after xac infection implies that ja synthesis may be involved in the resistance to xac. stronger activation of these stress-related genes in tg <dig>  particularly after xac infection, indicates that the transgenic plant might deploy more robust defense machinery against the invading pathogen . our present finding also demonstrates that an extensive transcriptional modification has taken place due to the ectopic expression of a polyamine biosynthetic gene, leading to a build-up of disease protection mechanisms in the transgenic plants, although the exact mode of action remains to be clarified.

taken together, overexpression of mdspds <dig> increased the endogenous cellular spm, which may serve as a signal to directly trigger expression of the defense-related genes under normal conditions. upon the xac attack, spm synthesis was elevated in the transgenic line and pao was accordingly more prominently activated through an as yet unidentified mechanism, generating a higher level of h2o <dig> that plays dual roles in either evoking the hypersensitive cell death or activating expression of the defense-related genes, which may function in concert or independently to reduce canker susceptibility. it has to be pointed out that production of more h2o <dig> might also contribute to the cell wall reinforcement or directly act as a microbicidal compound during the pathogen invasion. although we could not decipher the definite mechanism of action regarding h2o <dig> herein, our work, together with earlier ones using pao gene engineering  <cit> , demonstrates that polyamine synthesis and catabolism is an important player for modifying plant responses to diseases, which offers a new approach for engineering plant disease tolerance.

CONCLUSIONS
transgenic sweet orange plants over-expressing mdspds <dig> have been successfully regenerated, which are less susceptible to the canker disease caused by xac as compared with the untransformed plants.

using the transgenic line  with the highest transgene expression level we demonstrated that the reduced xac susceptibility might be ascribed to accumulation of h2o <dig> which was, at least partially, produced by pao-mediated polyamine catabolism. in addition, genes involved in disease defense were up-regulated to larger extent in the transgenic line relative to the untransformed plant.

to our knowledge, this is the first report on enhancing biotic stress tolerance via genetic manipulation of a polyamine biosynthetic gene in an economically important perennial crop.
